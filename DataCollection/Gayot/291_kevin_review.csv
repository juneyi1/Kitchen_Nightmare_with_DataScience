2008-02-25,4.0,"Wonderful ambiance and excellent service!  The meal was excellent, but I am a little bit disappointed that I went for a beef dish instead of fish (the fiancee was getting beef and its near impossible to get a bottle of wine that would work with both).  Not that the steak wasn't wonderful, I was just looking for something a little more unique.  As everyone else has remarked: the tuna tar tare was superb.  I'm not a huge wasabi fan, but the use of it in this dish was surprisingly subtle (which is a good thing because normally wasabi makes me feel as though my sinuses are on fire).  Excellent wine list, a great variety of types and prices.",0.9624,0.691,0.218,0.091,0.7805555555555556

2008-01-23,4.0,"I went here last night for a client dinner for the first time and was pleasantly surprised. While the name kind of turned me off at first, I quickly realized that the restuarant was much nicer than what I had pictured in my head.  There were about 15 of us at dinner, so i took full advantage of sampling the salad, asparagus and tuna tartare for starters - which were all very good. For the entree, i ordered the sea bass and garlic shrimp. It was delicious. While I'm often turned off at some of the entrees at similiar restuarants, this was really nice without being pretentious. Great for a downtown place to take your parents or for a date.  PS -  the table also ordered the chocolate cake and the presentation, and more so the taste, were awesome!",0.965,0.812,0.166,0.022,0.6258333333333335
2007-12-25,5.0,"I had a great dinner here.  First I'm a wine person and the wine menu was amazing, but more importantly the waiter knew his wines and was recommending what went well with our food.   He also bought us tastes of the wines by the glass because we got a glass of wine with the appetizer and then a bottle of red with dinner.I started with the Tuna Tartare which was a signature dish.  I enjoyed it but I don't think it was the best thing I had.  The other appetizer was ostrich which I had never had before but it was fabulous.  I was told it was beef without the guilt and let me tell you that was the truth. For dinner the group shared three of the entrees which was the way to go.  The Tuna main dish was amazing, it had a great flavor and was the lightest of the dishes we had.  We also had the duck and the veal.  The duck was probably my least favorite but it was still great.  The veal was amazing.  Everything was better then the next.   I would totally return.",0.9956,0.722,0.263,0.015,0.6070833333333334
2007-11-13,4.0,"I went to Kevin back in March 07 and really enjoyed the food.  Their Tuna Tartare is one of the items that is a ""signature dish"" for their restaurant and doesn't come off the menu, whereas most other items seem to rotate depending on what is in season. I thought the ambiance was very nice, romantic.  But also perfect for a business gathering or a nice dinner with the folks.  I would definitely go back again! Their desserts were great!  Shared the Pepper Creme Brulee and paired it with a scotch.  Wonderful combination!  Also had the lamb and venison - cooked to perfection.

2007-10-31,5.0,"I have dined at quite a few places in my time and currently Kevin is tops on my list.  My girlfriend took me out here for my birthday and the whole experience was absolutely fabulous!  She booked the reservations in advance and told them that it was my birthday and requested a romantic table.  When we got there they sat us in one of the best tables that they had overlooking most of the dining room.  How is that for service? The dining room and ambiance was a nice change from what I am used to in a Chicago dining establishment.  The experience at Kevin was focused on service and the food instead of the volume of diners that other establishments count on.  The dining room probably only sat 30 people compared to the 100+ in other establishments, the difference here is that you can actually have a conversation with the person you are dining with instead of having to shout to him or her.   Food here is fantastic!  We started out with the tuna tar-tare (which we were notified was Kevin's signature dish) and it was the best tuna tar-tare that I have ever had.  Presentation here was nice and simple and the dish itself was so light and fluffy to the tongue that it was almost as though it dissolved when it was in your mouth leaving just a hint of sesame.  In terms of entrees we choose the grouper and the roasted duck, both which were also fantastic.  The grouper was nice and flaky while the duck had to be the crowning dish.  Desert was also another party pleaser and the pastry chef had the thoughtfulness to write Happy Birthday to me in chocolate on the dish! In essence, I would highly recommend Kevin to anyone who has the palate to enjoy such wonderful creations in a cozy atmosphere.  I hope that this establishment stays in Chicago for many years to come.",0.9962,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.6073015873015873
2007-10-28,5.0,"Last night I took my boyfriend here for his birthday and everything was PERFECT.  I made reservations a few days in advance and told them that we were celebrating a special birthday and requested a romantic table.  When we arrived we were seated in a booth so that we could sit next to each other.  A great start to our night.  Kevin has an extensive wine list and the menu changes everyday.  The server was very polite and even offered suggestions.  We ordered one of their cheaper bottles of wine (still a good $45 though), and had the famous tuna tartare for an appetizer.  It was very good and I loved the side salads and greens that came along on the plate.  For entrees we had the Red Snapper and Roasted Duck.  I had the duck, and it was amazing.  It came with two duck potstickers (which were out of this world), cranberries, a potato pancake and a mushroom/celery salad.   We ordered dessert and espresso.  When the dessert came out the pastry chef wrote ""Happy Birthday"" on the plate in chocolate and sent out a candle with it.  A great presentation. The atmosphere is clean and minimal.  I really liked that the dining room was full and you could still talk at a normal level.  Overall, the service was perfect and they paid much attention to the small details and the food was fabulous.  I would recommend this place to anyone wanting to celebrate a special occasion.   Even though the prices may seem a little high, I think it was well worth the money for the experience and fine dining.",0.9964,0.774,0.226,0.0,0.5452310924369749

2007-07-31,4.0,"Love, love, love the appetizers.  The tuna tartare is amazing.  The potstickers are near orgasmic.  And the ostrich--- very tender, and I always get a kick out of eating ""exotic"" meats.  Next time I go to Kevin, I think I'm just going to order a bunch of appetizers.  I've tried two lunch entrees (the duck salad and the salmon) and both were excellent, but not up to the level of the appetizers either in terms of creativity or combinations of taste.   Great atmosphere, almost like a fancy-shmancy ski lodge, and the restaurant is always near-empty at lunch.

I have to confess I had a little bit of a hard time finding something to eat because while the options were several, the combinations were a bit too exotic for me. By no means I was hoping to have a hamburger there, but even in the most ellaborate menus, they still need to keep a few options simple and fine.  In the end I ate really well.

The food is stellar, we started with the ""double-secret"" appetizer, which was well a secret but intensly good. We were then brought out a small app. while our food was prepared.  My date ordered the halibut and I had the big eye tuna.  Both were incredibly fresh, and dare I say it - the best tuna thus far... We waited only a very short time for our food and the service was outstanding.  Our waiter was invisible to the meal - a clue that he had some idea what he was doing. We ordered a decadent chocolate desert, paid the tab, and left paying for the $10 valet.

(it includes Chinese Braised Pork Belly and Moo Shu of Pork, Peanuts, Ginger and Bana with Smoked Bhutanese Red Rice, Garlic and Scallions, and a banana dumpling) for $30.. The appeal is that they do change their menu daily, and they have creative asian infused flavors, but the entree selection may be a bit of a hit or miss.

2007-03-11,5.0,"French Asian Fusion  with a wine list that's as thick as a Harry Potter novel. This is a great spot for special occasions, a night out treating yourself, or taking a special certain someone for a great date. The atmosphere is wonderful, music not too loud, seating ample, and acoustics make it easy to have a conversation without having to hear over the others in the room. Our service was awesome!  From our entry into Kevin we were greeted and as we were early for our reservation (a reservation is recommended for this spot) were accommodated at the bar.  At the bar we were greeted by the bartender Tim who spent time with us walking us threw the extensive wine list to fine just the right one even letting us taste before we made our selection. A few moments later we were informed our table was ready and our drinks and tab were transfered to the table (love not having multiple tabs). At our table we were greeted by Chris our waiter who made us feel welcome and then gave us the run down on menu items.  He then left to give us a moment to make our decisions.  While we were doing that the amuse bouche of sweet corn won ton was presented to us. YUM! Chris returned and took our orders. The food was perfect.  And, when i say perfect i mean just that. I can not recall a better meal.  What we ordered: Appetizers Corn and Coconut Milk Chowder with Chili, Cilantro and Lime This was served with a perfectly cleaned and cooked prawn on top. Grilled Asparagus Salad in Walnut Oil Vinaigrette with Watercress, Mixed Greens and Celery Root in Citrus Dressing. This was so refreshing and delicious, the dressing was light and complemented everything on the plate. Entrees Roasted Beef Tenderloin in Red Wine Sauce with Mushrooms, Arugula, Cipollini Onion and Braised Oxtail Potstickers It was every bit as good as it sounds.  I will be dreaming about this dish. Roasted Organic Pork Loin, Chinese Braised Pork Belly and Moo Shu of Pork, Peanuts, Ginger and Banana Potstickers with Smoked Bhutanese Red Rice, Garlic and Scallions The best Pork Loin I have ever had.  Heaven. Dessert Orange Chocolate Creme Brulee Nearly got into a spoon fight over this. Now one thing to note about these menu items that i have listed here is that they may or may not be on the menu when you visit. Check the web site as they change their menu frequently and i could not be happier about this.  You see when i find a place like this with such high quality in service and food i keep coming back and an ever changing menu keeps things  fresh and exciting.

2007-01-25,1.0,"Kevin has very good food, but the last time I dined there, the service was so atrocious and rude that I will never go back. We ordered a bottle of Chateauneuf with our appetizers. We were instead brought out a different (and more expensive) bottle from Gigondas. I informed the server that the bottle was not the one that we ordered and he said that they must have been out of our selection and we should try this one. Giving them the benefit of the doubt, we let him pour the wine, which he did without the appropriate tasting pour, and left the table. We proceed to taste the wine, and can immediately tell the bottle is corked. When the waiter returns, we inform him the bottle is bad, at which point he goes to get a glass, pours himself some, drinks a small taste of it (without smelling it) and insists the wine is fine. I ask to speak to a manager, and the Sommelier comes out. He again pours some of the wine, makes a big show of his tasting routine, then explains how highly educated he is about wine and implies that I'm ignorant due to my age and that the wine is fine. I am forced to explain to him how people's palates differ in sensitivity and how tastebuds many times decline with age, so despite the high esteem that he holds himself in, he may not be able to pick up the sourness inherent in that wine (which we didn't even order!) Finally, after a 5 minute discussion with 2 people hovering over our table (while our appetizers get cold) he replies with a scoff, ""I guess it's a LITTLE off"" takes the bottle, and walks away in a huff.  By this point, my companion was quite upset as she had surprised me by booking a reservation at Kevin knowing that I had liked it previously, and was planning on treating me to a nice dinner. I proceeded to neglect the already tepid appetizers (what a waste of ostrich...) and spoke with Alan Shikami. I told him how I have had several positive experiences at Kevin, but recounted the story of what had just happened regarding the wine and pointed out how 1.) a restaurant should never push a more expensive wine on someone when their selection is out-of-stock (and preferrably should take the selection off the list) without giving them the chance to make an alternate selection themselves, 2.) if they do strongly suggest an alternate wine, stand behind that selection 3.) never argue with a patron if they say the wine is corked and 4.) never ever ever have a powwow at the table debating whether or not the customer is right and get into a tete-a-tete over who knows more about wine! Alan merely held the company line and said ""what do I want, the sommelier said it was a little off?"" He never apologized, he never offered to comp the apps that were wasted due to the affair.  Seeing that our attempt at coaxing good service, or at least an apology, out of the staff was in vain, I told them that we would not be staying for entrees and gave them my card and said to charge us for what was owed. They hurriedly rang up an undiscounted bill and dropped it rudely on the table.  Such a waste of a skilled chef.",-0.9346,0.843,0.071,0.086,0.47447963601024823
2006-12-01,4.0,I thought this place was great. I went there the first weekend I was living in Chicago and naturally got lost trying to find it (i.e. getting terribly confused re: the difference between upper and lower Michigan and how to get down to Hubbard from the Mag Mile). I had to call the restaurant a few times to tell them we were running late and ask for directions and hostess was very patient and polite with me over the phone.  Everything on the menu was delicious and nicely presented. The decor was beautiful as well - very sophisticated and perfect for a date or dinner with friends.
