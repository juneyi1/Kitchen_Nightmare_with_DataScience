2012-02-09,2.0,"China Grill is large Chinese/Japanese restaurant that serves a mixture of different types of cuisines.  The first impression that this restaurant gives is that of a fancy, upscale and trendy place, with good food and staff. My wife and I visited China Grill a short while ago, and we ordered the duck and some pasta.  Both of our dishes would be rated a 2/5 - there was a large quantity of food, but it wasn't as tasty as expected.  Because of the portion size, we brought our leftovers home with us, and it gave both of us a stomach ache when we ate it the next day. The best part about our experience at China Grill was the atmosphere.  The restaurant has an intimate, quiet setting.  The decorations are very beautiful and different from what you might find elsewhere.  Our waiter didn't check up on us as often as we would have liked, but he did a good job taking care of our order. In summary, for the price, I definitely expected more from the China Grill.  In the end, I consider this restaurant average and will probably not return.",0.9817,0.834,0.149,0.017,0.5012531328320802

2012-01-15,1.0,"In short, the decor was great, the the food was good, the service was the worst in my entire life, and I am not kidding or exaggerating.  We went to China Grill with my husband for our 5 year anniversary. We left in a horrible mood because the server had a very negative attitude the whole time, for no apparent reason, as though she hated us. I've never seen anything like this, and  I am pretty tolerant as I worked as a server myself before. Some of the examples from the night: When server brought the plates with food, she dropped a large piece of food from the plate. Not only she didn't apologize and replaced it, she didn't even bother to clean it up and left it the middle of the table.  When I spilled my sake by accident on the table - she just ignored, didn't help to clean it, nor asked me if I wanted to order another one, even though I had nothing left. For the appetizer, we asked if we could order a hand roll instead of a regular roll. She said that she doesn't think so. We asked that she at least asks the chef if he can do it. She brought us a regular roll on the table without any words, such as ""sorry, the chef couldn't do it"". Just dropped the plate and left.  But the worst thing was her attitude. This totally spoiled our evening, considering it was a big event for us. And China Grill is not a cheap restaurant - we were spending over $100 for 2 of us. There were only 4-5 tables in the whole restaurant on Saturday night at 6 pm (I wonder why). The manager of the restaurant instead of checking with the tables to make sure those few people in the restaurant were happy was hanging out by the bar the whole time chatting with the bartender and our horrible server. And I am pretty certain If they don't change the management, the restaurant will be out of business very soon - unfortunately.

We ordered way more than we could eat because there were so many amazing things on the menu. The portions are great for sharing and the lobster mashed potatoes are out of this world! And if you like a little heat I suggest you also try the wasabi mashed potatoes. It was a bit pricey but worth every penny in my opinion.

That however was not the case as more followed till we were full.  The only problem with the food was that everything was either sweet or bathed in soy sauce!

2011-08-25,3.0,"We came here for lunch on my last day in Chicago as a celebratory lunch.  It was recommended to me because it was close and I was craving sushi, and this place is Asian fusion.  I was not expecting too much from this place, seeing that it was a chain, and it did not even quite match my no-so-high expectations. We ordered two appetizers for the table, and then each of us ordered an entrée.  The calamari salad with miso lime dressing was solid; I especially loved the batter in which the calamari was fried in.  Light and crispy.  I liked convincing myself that it was totally ok and healthy to eat fried calamari because it was a salad--granted, a salad with too much dressing and an overpowering lime flavor. The sushi was absolutely terrible.  We ordered the dragon roll, which surprisingly did not have any eel--my favorite part (and the most expensive).  In fact, it was one of the less well executed sushi rolls I have ever had, with the rice extremely dense and barely seasoned.  The tobiko was tiny and of poor quality.  The shrimp tempura tasted like something my school cafeteria could make better. For entrees, we shared the Curry miso butter fish (sweet soy glazed Chinese broccoli & yuzu-miso butter) and Lobster pancakes with vegetable fried rice (stir fried with wild mushrooms, red chili, scallions & coconut milk) after the waiter said that it was his favorite dish at the restaurant.  While the food tasted good at first bite, it was  several magnitudes too heavy.  The wild mushrooms were too sweet.  The coconut milk sauce was too dense.  The butter fish went overboard with the yuzu miso.  And the so-called lobster pancake had too much butter and flour and not enough lobster to the point that I could barely taste the lobster in the dough.    Rich food does not always equal good food.  Rich food often tries to hide the lack of artistry of mastering the spices.  That was China Grill.  Add butter.  Erase artistry.  And you've got some overpriced, ordinary dishes.   Also, to me, there is something so genuine to the oil used in Chinese cooking to form that homey flavor.  When you substitute in a butter overload, it just becomes a big mess of confusion, just like the current hurricane winding down the coast.",0.9874,0.828,0.13,0.042,0.4465419501133786

Upon entering, I was very impressed with the interior, especially the wall of wine bottles and the glass panes. The hostess promptly seated us by the bar. I had the beef & scallion dumplings as appetizer, and the spicy tuna roll as the entree. The dumplings were fantastic -- 4 pieces of dim sum like dumplings with greens, dressed in a surprising mix of soy sauce, ginger, and a hint of wasabi. The spicy tuna roll that followed was a disappointment, however. It was not spicy at all, and it sat on top of some sweet teriyaki sauce. I guess it wasn't a spicy tuna roll that I would normally have at a sushi place. I order a spicy tuna roll when I want something spicy, that has a cooling cucumber or something else that complements the spice, and overally fresh and light in taste. Note to self, do not get sushi at a fusion place! I wish I tried a different dish, I may do so if I'm in the area again. Perhaps it's more suitable for a cocktail and small bites type of fare.

While it looked too cool for me, I finally decided to try it for a little take out today for lunch. I looked at the menu online and they had a Confucius Chicken Salad for $13. I called to place my order and as soon as I said 'order for take out,' I got hung up on, I'm sure just a coincidence, but I should have stopped there.  When I got there the same hostess handed me a nice large menu and told me that the chicken salad's dressing was heavier than the steak salad but the steak salad was smaller and $14, and I don't like tomatoes, so I chose the chicken. Went to the bar and ordered, total of $14.43.  A few minutes later it arrived, so that is a pro, but it's probably because the salad was so small and had nothing in it. Seriously, a bed of some shredded ice berg, maybe a few other leafy greens, but few, those crunchy translucent Chinese noodle things on top and cut up chicken chunks that were not marinated, seasoned or anything. I asked for dressing on the side, I'm glad I did because it was so heavy and had only one note, heavy sesame flavor.  I couldn't even finish the salad because the dressing was so heavy and the ingredients so lacking in originality. I am disappointed in this place, for trying to be cool it totally lacks good food. At least from my one sampling I would say that I would never go back, unless someone really pushed to go there for a drink after work.

The best part of my China Grill experience was the company for sure, a close second was the service, and a close third was the food! After our sweet start, we had a tri-fecta of salad, house Caesar, crispy noodle chicken, and a calamari themed fresh escape...  My favorite was the calamari salad for sure, perfectly cooked and spiced calamari complimented perfectly with fresh moments and a perfect light dressing...  The Caesar was surprisingly satisfying as well, with an unusual cashew coefficient that worked perfectly!  My least favorite was the chicken; frankly the breast chunks were rather dry and flavorless, I feel like it would have been better sans chicken... Two titillating appetizers followed our salads, lobster pancakes and beef dumplings, the showstopper here was the lobster pancakes for sure!  First the aroma was intoxicating, I mentioned it, my meal mate mentioned it, then even the staff mentioned it as they walked by, I mean this was for serious!  Fungi of different sorts, julienne onion and veggies with healthy little chunks of Lobster all wrapped in a perfect crepe like pancake and then immersed in a heavenly sauce...  The beef dumplings were good, but the lobster was out of this world!

The heat from the plate makes the shrimp move like they are still alive! Kinda freaky/interesting, but at the same time mediocre and not worth $50.  I was also here at dinner time on a Saturday night, and we where the ONLY people here. I Guess no one else wanted blow their money on mediocre food.",0.755,0.877,0.077,0.046,0.4908008658008658

The hostess and wait staff made me feel welcome and informed of my options for the evening. In fact, all went well with the process leading up to the meal. My Spicy Beef and Scallion Dumplings with soy ginger, for example, was tasty and a good start. The Sake Marinated Drunken Chicken, though, was choke-down dry and sent back ot the kitchen after eating off of a few of the medallions in the hope of finding something worth eating on the plate. Even this might have gone without much fuss on that particular evening, but when the waiter held a short argument with me that this was normal and appropriate and that the ""soy sauce was supposed to take care of it"" I had to take issue. Afterall, as my my friend Nancy later commented: ""soy sauce on saw dust is still sawdust."" Whether you agree or disagree about what is/isn't appropriate about the dryness of the meat being served, arguing with the customer about whether they like it or not is not appropriate.

When we walked in, we were seated promptly and given both the regular menu and the restaurant week menu. Our waiter gave us a few minutes to look over the wine list and gave us a great suggestion on a bottle that was actually cheaper than the one we were going to go with. It went perfectly with our meal.  Most restaurant week menus are 3 courses but this was a 4 course tasting menu so we got both options for each course. I was nervous that this would mean small portions of each but we did not leave hungry by any means! The first course was a portion of their Chinese chicken and calamari salads. Both were so good, I would come back just to eat those! I couldn't decide which one I liked more. Second course was a tempura sashimi tuna roll and some beef dumplings. Both were delicious. The main course was bbq salmon and soy ginger steak. The meal also came with a generous helping of veggies and your choice of the avocado fried rice or wasabi mashed. We went with the mashed and were not disappointed. The salmon was pretty good and that's saying a lot from someone who really hates salmon. The steak was amazing. Good flavor and very tender. Dessert was a chocolate mousse cake thing that we shared. Good thing as we were both stuffed by then!  Service was great throughout the entire meal. I was very impressed with the entire staff as my plate was never sitting empty too long before it was taken away and replaced with a new on and my water glass was never empty. In looking at the prices of the normal menu, it does seem a bit pricey. Don't know if I'd come back unless I was there for some sort of special or for a special occasion. But I do plan on going back.

A couple years ago our first trip here was horrible.  One of the people in our group has a bad garlic allergy so we asked them to make whatever they could without the use of garlic.  This was a huge mistake as it seemed like they replaced the garlic with copious amounts of salt.  The duck fried rice, my favorite in Vegas, was like eating a block of salt and the rice was undercooked.  Even with this experience we chalked it up to the garlic allergy as it doesn't seem fair to tell a Chinese restaurant not to use garlic.   Went back last night with friends to give it another try after yet another stellar experience in Vegas in the fall.  Started off great splitting the duck and calamari salads, both good choices.  Usually we go with appetizers however none of them have ever stuck out as excellent so we went the salad route for a change.   For entrees we were disappointed that they didn't have the pork belly but we powered forward with the rack of lamb, garlic shrimp, and braised short ribs.  The rack of lamb was excellent paired with little pieces of pear and cooked perfectly.  The garlic shrimp were huge and really came with a black linguine was a really nice sauce with a little sweetness.  The braised short ribs were a disaster.  This entree is a standby whenever we go here.  It is usually tender with a ton of flavor.  These were hard like a well done steak.  It was difficult to cut with the knife.  They were cold and obviously not braised unless it was done hours or days before and microwaved.  I'm really upset at myself for not sending it back as it's not usually my style.  We had the creme brulee sampler for desert and although good the filling was cold on two of them.   I've never been to a restaurant where the experience has been so different from one location to another.  Somebody from China Grill management needs to go the Chicago location and do some quality control.  They have a really good restaurant concept that is being really poorly executed in that one location.  It was Saturday night and the place was less than 50% full.  I'm not surprised considering the experiences I have had there.",0.9801,0.761,0.144,0.095,0.5775793650793652

My husband and I stopped in the bar one night this summer for drinks and 2 hours later found ourselves quite hungry. The smells wafting from the restaurant were deceivingly mouthwatering so we figured why not see if we could get a table? The fact that the popular hotel/Michigan Ave. spot was damn near a ghost town at 9:00 on a Friday night should have set off warning bells, but, when you're hungry and there's no waiting your judgement slips. We were seated immediately and about 10 minutes later our waiter, who seemed extremely flustered despite the lack of people, stopped by to ask us if we were ready to order. Umm, menus would help? Just a thought.  Oh.My. GOD. How ridiculously overpriced can a (lousy) restaurant be?? I have to make a disclaimer that I am not opposed to the occasional wallet emptying meal if the food, service, and experience are on point. I do, however, have a huge problem when the food is ass crap and the service is pathetic and sad. The appetizers ranged in price from $18-$36, and the entrees $22-$79 range. $79 for extremely mediocre food=ridiculous.  We started with the asian spiced spare ribs that were just, eh so-so. We decided on the waiter's passionate recommendation for an entree, the short ribs special that turned out to be A)nasty and B)basically pot roast with huge chunks of sweet potato. It made no sense and was all over the place. We also got the fried rice with the ""avocado salad"", which was nothing more than sliced avocado on top of average fried rice that could have come from Panda Express. Oh, and, the rice was cold in the middle.  So, yeah, um, I won't be going back.",-0.8287,0.761,0.105,0.134,0.5976587301587302

I have been to the ""sister"" restaurants to this one in LA , Miami and in Las Vegas.  All three times my experiences were great.  So maybe it was because those were for dinners and this was a lunch or maybe they were having an off day- but China Grill did not impress me as much as other brands in this chain or other locations of the same.

For our entree, we split the skirt steak which was just ok.  I had to have them re-do it as it came with some type of an orange teriaki sauce which I can't eat (allergic to oranges) but orange was no where on the menu when I looked back at it.    The best thing we had?  Hands down it was the lobster mashed potatoes.   These things were amazing and even though I was full- I kept eating them.   In addition, the restaurant had an odd smell to it- one that remained in my clothing for the remainder of the day.  Like frying oil that wasn't properly vented.  Not good.

2008-04-19,2.0,"Summary: A high-priced tourist-trap restaurant with good service but mediocre food. To start, this restaurant needs some serious work on the ventilation system. The first thing that struck us (literally) when we walked in the door was the heavy smell of grease. It was as though someone has frying, not grilling, beef and simply venting the kitchen into the dining area. As the meal progressed, we could clearly smell other menu items being fried. This was a clear indication that the heavy smell was not a one-time mistake. Not very appetizing. Next, we found the menu to be exceptionally overpriced. It was a apparent to us this is a tourist trap that is conveniently located next to the Hard Rock Hotel. The average price of an appetizer was $20. We had the brazed short ribs, they were tasty but way over-priced. The food here is very mediocre and worth half the cost at best. Even the chain-type Chinese restaurants in the area (Ben Pao, P.F. Changes, etc.) offer more authentic and reasonably priced faux-Chinese. Finally, we used a coupon from restaurant..com and were charged 18% gratuity for a party of two. The service was excellent and we normally tip 20% for the quality of service we received. We found it insulting that we be ""requested"" to pay 18%.

We started off with the Thai Shrimp Cakes which had cactus-mango salsa & black mole vinaigrette topped with a sour cream-esque dollop.

I ordered a large sparking Voss which was 10 bucks! Figures since the rest of their menu is overpriced.  We ordered the  Confucius Chicken Salad  which had a sesame oil vinaigrette, but it was made with ICEBERG lettuce. Blah...if you're going to charge me 15 bucks for a salad, then it better not be iceberg. Too bad it wasn't listed on the menu because I definitely would have gotten something else. The flavor wasn't too bad. Our entree was the cod with miso sauce. Imagine chop suey or chow mein. I've had this dish numerous times and this experience falls at the bottom rung. Every other time I've had this, my first correlation in my head is buttahhhhh. Not tonight, my friends. It was mediocre. The trio of creme brulee was worth it though! My fav was the ginger brulee and the accompanying cream-stuffed cookies. Yum. The espresso here was what topped off the night of mediocrity. I could have had the music toned down a few decibels.

All the food was executed very well.  We started with the tempura sashimi, wondering if cooked sashimi would taste like fish.  It was actually very good, with only a hint of cookness on the edge of the tuna.  It went well with the mustardy gingery sesame sauce and the contrast of the crunchy breading with the soft fish was nice.  Even the pile of bean sprouts in the middle were good.  Second on our list was the Calamari Firecracker Salad.  for fried squid on salad this was great.  The dressing really made the dish, and the squid were very tender.  Our main was the Korean kalbi steak.  OMG this was amazing.  It was like two steaks in one.  There were some rare pieces that were a little chewy but tasted great.  And then there were the well done edges which were the highlight, tender, full of flavor... NO wait, the pieces of fat on the ends were sublime.  I love when a nice well seasoned piece of fat melts in my mouth.  This was one of those cut every last morsel of meat off the bone steaks.  One of the gnaw on the bone while no one is looking kind.  The roasted roots that come with it were cooked well, but maybe didn't complement it as well as maybe some rice dish could have.  We still polished those off too though. Of course we had to have dessert.  We opted for the bread pudding with lemon sesame whatever sauce and sorbet.  While I thought the pineapple and lychee sorbets were just OK, the bread pudding was fabulous.  warm and rich.  There ware also some good pieces of dried candied pineapple on the plate.  I wish I had ordered an espresso for the dessert, i think it would have complimented it well. I like the semi open kitchen, but since it is a bit elevated, you really couldn't see what was going on in it, only the wait staff picking up dishes.  We didn't have any cocktails which are supposed to be good, but it was the night after new years eve, so you'll have to give me a break.",0.9989,0.751,0.223,0.026,0.5625252525252524
2007-12-27,5.0,"The interior of China Grill is dark and swanky, with red walls and black furniture and pillars.  There is a wall of bottles, which looks really cool at night.   We went on Christmas Eve, which was great since there was noone in the place as well as on the street driving in.  Since we were one of four tables occupying the place, we were treated to very good, attentive service.  Our hostess, waiter and even bus boy were all very pleasant and professional.  At one point, a woman who I took to be the manager, even came over to make sure we had everything we needed and were having a good time.  I hope this is how it always is in there and not just because it was a slow holiday night.         China Grill plates its food to encourage sharing and I was so glad we were told that up front as the entrees came out on huge platters.  Yes, it is very expensive in there, but the size, presentation and quality of the food was definitely worth the cost.   We started with the spicy beef & scallion dumplings, which were drizzled with this delicious sauce (I think ponzu?).  Anyway, we had barely finished cooing over how incredible they were when the sake marinated ""drunken"" chicken arrived.  Plump, insanely juicy and flavourful, this blew away any chicken I had ever tasted in the past.   Then the wasabi mashed potatoes and Szechuwan Beef dish BF ordered arrived.  The potatoes were silky and strongly laced with wasabi, which I definitely appreciated.  The beef came medium rare in slices, which  just melted in your mouth.  The tiny, frizzled fried string potatoes on top were the only thing I disliked, as I felt they were too greasy.   All in all, I felt we had made an excellent choice in selecting the China Grill as our fancy-pants Christmas Eve restaurant.  If you are downtown and want a great experience, I definitely recommend trying it out.",0.9957,0.791,0.195,0.014,0.6528956228956229

2007-10-09,2.0,"Yea this place is pretty fancy schmancy- but under all the caviar, quail eggs, and foie gras, there is a service staff who goes out of their way to make you feel quite uncomfortable. We were here on Valentine's Day over a year ago. We got there around 9ish and the place was about half full. From the moment our server approached us to take our wine order he had an absolutely condescending tone and attitude. He acted offended by my wine list questions, and never came to check on us other than the mandatory order-taking and dropping-off.  One of the pre fixed courses had foie gras, and being involved in animal rights issues, I asked for the foie gras to not be served on my plate. Can you guess what happened next? The server's assistant set the plate down with foie gras and took off, and no one was to be found again until the serving of the next course.  The restaurant was decorated beautifully and the food was elegant, yet none of that matters when your wait staff is arrogant, condescending, and inattentive.",-0.2024,0.864,0.064,0.073,0.5400462962962963

2007-08-08,4.0,"I'm still trying to figure out how it is that I've been a Chicagoan for this long, yet I had never been to China Grill.  For some reason, I feel like it flies a bit under most people's radar, which is unfortunate.  Chicago needs more places like this. The decor is really nice - swanky, but not in a trying-too-hard way; modern, but not cold; dark and a bit loud, but not offensively so.  And, the seating options are great because it's a mix of tables that are more out in the open, if you want to see and be seen, and cozy booths tucked into dark corners, if you're making an effort to have some privacy. Our server called the portions ""big,"" which was the understatement of the year.  My friend and I split two appetizers, and couldn't finish them.  I can't even imagine how the entrees are sized.  The calamari salad was good, but I was a little disappointed because it can't even hold a candle to the calamari salad they do at Asia de Cuba (owned by the same company as China Grill).  We also had the chicken satay with cold noodles, which was a shade too spicy for my taste, but different than, and must tastier, than your typical chicken satay skewers.  Cocktails seemed to be heavy on the sugar and fruity flavor, light on the alcohol.  However, the wine list isn't particularly extensive, but it happened to have a lot of things that I really like, so I was pleased about that.",0.9792,0.857,0.122,0.021,0.6071839080459768

Will definitely have to try it next time.  Curiously, for an upscale place, the portions are quite large and we had to ask for a doggie bag for the leftovers.",0.9626,0.82,0.171,0.009,0.611139455782313

The bar was very hip and trendy.  The drinks were a little over priced.  But the meal... The meal was probably one of the top 5 meals I have had in Chicago.  If you have the opportunity to dine here, do yourself a favor and order the ribeye medium or medium rare.  It was HEAVEN!!  We also had an appetizer that included three types of salad and we ordered the special of the night... pan seared scallops with crab mashed potatoes.   All in all, the meal was great from start to finish.  I can't talk enough about the ribeye steak, though.  It came on a recommendation from the manager, who stopped by to say 'hi'.  I've had many steaks in Chicago and have come to expect a certain quality with those steaks... but this was something i had never had before.  It was so different... yet so good.  It was a wonderful alternative to a Chicago Steakhouse steak.",0.9713,0.854,0.127,0.019,0.5793837535014006
2007-06-28,4.0,"I've known about this place for quite some time and have never sauntered in.  Finally, I convinced a pal to meet me there on a Wednesday evening.   The interior is very hip and modern, this place definitely can accommodate large groups and even small parties. The bar area is small, but it has a decent number of tables and chairs.  Drinks are a bit pricey at $12 a martini, sake or cocktail.  Note, the place is very loud.  I could barely hear my friend when we spoke.  The dinner was excellent.  The curry chicken satay is delicious - spicy chicken and sesame noodles.  The peking duck salad wasn't bad, but I thought the dressing could be a little tangier - it was also sparse, too.  Not much duck in the salad, by the way.  The blackened pork tenderloin was a little bit dry, but the breading was seasoned and had a nice, spicy flavor - the mandarin orange topping was a nice contrast.  The purple mashed potatoes tasted blah.  Needs garlic or something.    We skipped dessert, but they have key lime tart, fruit souffle, chocolate mousse, sorbet, etc. as well as a dessert wine menu. Remember, each dish is intended for more than one person.  So, each entree is at least for a minimum of 2-4 people, as are the sides and the salads.  We split a small salad, and I think it was enough for 3-4 people.  For just two people, I think you could get by with splitting one small salad and one entree or you could split two appetizers and a salad or a side.  Price range -- Appetizers ranged from $9-22, salads ranged from $10-24 (depending on size), and entrees were generally in the $30-35 range, although there was a tempting lobster dish that was simply ""market price.""  Check out the menu on the restaurant's website. Service was very good, but I felt that the server was pressuring us to order far more food than necessary.  Don't fall into this trap but look around you to see the portions that are being brought out to the other tables. Overall, a nice experience.  Not crowded at all.  We had reservations, but we could have done without reservations, too.  I think a lot of people overlook this place (it is a hotel restaurant after all --Hard Rock Hotel), but it is a nice find.",0.9899,0.862,0.115,0.023,0.6145054945054945
