I remember one summer finding a 1944 edition of the Mitchell's novel in one of my grandma's drawers and devouring the book. And watching the movie. 28 times. Or so. Wishing that Scarlett would somehow get her shit together, stop bitching around and hold on to that Rhett of hers that was quite the man. Oh - and Louisiana being remotely French I had vague ideas about New Orleans, the voodoo, the jambalaya and Mardi-Gras. Talk about a collection of cliches, right??! I live a few blocks away from this little gem of a place but never made the effort to put it on my to-go list. Big mistake. Especially since I am reading now that they are going to close down in a mere 10 days.....what a waste of time. C'est la vie - as they say. I guess we stopped by just in time to get a taste of what we have been missing out for two years. And believe me the kitchen part of Dixie delivers some serious food to its followers (not sure about the Bait Shop part - but feel free to ask to the next catfish you cross path with) We started with the most amazing crayfish and corn fritters imaginable...not too greasy, filled with big chunks of crayfish, crunchy, salty, delicious AND close to appetizer perfection with the amazing jalapeno jelly that comes with. Winner. Being in an indecisive mood we then shared the sampler - jambalaya, red beans/rice and gumbo. Simple but good and satisfying. Thumb up for the beans and rice. Then it was peach cobbler time................. I could easily eat two of these things in a record time. Warm, yummy, big slices of peach, not overly sweet....it is Georgia in your mouth.

Finding Dixie Kitchen is a total crap shot, but once you do get a radar on the location, parking is easy (there's a pay lot right out front that actually takes credit cards).  The inside of Dixie Kitchen couldn't be cuter. They specialize in Southern cooking, so the decor is full force Southern charm... mixed with bait shop tidbits. Dixie Kitchen is fairly small, so I would imagine that during peak hours, it can get pretty bumpin' in there, but I easily scored a table on a Monday for lunch. Oh yes... there were more than a few cops eating at Dixie Kitchen. Good sign.  My appetizer of crawfish, corn and jalapeno fritters were SO good. The cheesy, gooey insides totally complimented the crispy, bready exterior. With just the right punch of heat from the jalapenos and a nice seafood background from the crawfish, they are a party for your taste buds.  My catfish po'boy was on point, too. I was served an absolutely mammoth slab of fried catfish dressed with tartar sauce, lettuce, tomato and red onion. Hell yes. I didn't even touch my sides of cole slaw and corn because I wanted to completely focus on my po'boy. I'm sure they would have been lovely should I have actually eaten them.  Dessert? You know it. My girlfriends and I split a slice of sweet potato pie. I've never been a sweet potato kind of girl (I know, I know) but I was promised it tasted ""just like butterscotch."" And you know what?

Crawfish Etouffe - As a self proclaimed non-fan of crawfish, I was not expecting to enjoy the flavors, however once mixed, it was tasty and had a nice kick to it.  Again, not bad, but nothing I would crave to order again. Catfish Po' Boy - Now this was the clear winner in the items I tried.  Catfish was fried to a perfect golden, the bread was well... crisp yet bready and warm, and each bite was delicious.  In fact, the waiter tossed in an extra piece of catfish since he felt the first piece we received was too small.  Excellent service! Unfortunately, we chose to come here during Lent, so I do plan to make another trip to break into their Chicken Fried Steak and Pulled Pork (both avid fav meals of mine).

I am a patriotic citizen who loves his new president, so of course, I had to go.  Luckily, our new Chicago friends and guides Marc and Tina actually suggested this place (Tina had actually heard that that show was trying to re-run that now classic review), and as a Hyde Park native, she knew exactly where it was and where to park. OK, I'll try to keep this short:  Great, fun and funky decor, with all kinds of vintage signs, coffee cans, various odd bits of southern Americana on the walls and hanging from the ceiling.  Super friendly wait staff that are happy to walk some Yankees with lots of questions through the menu.

Oh, and we all shared some crunchy, salty, tart fried green tomatoes.   Yum.

2008-05-16,4.0,"I normally don't venture into Hyde Park, so I took the recommendation of Carolynne R and Xtie for this place. I must say I was definitely pleased with Dixie Kitchen. It's a little difficult to locate since the street winds around the place almost like a back alley. Best way to get in is from Lake Park Ave. and park in the coin-op lot across from the restaurant. Once inside, be ready to wait at least for a little while. Every table was taken and people kept coming to pick up food to go. A large family of both young and old took up about 3 tables in one part of the restaurant. Looking at them all and how they were dressed up, the older women wearing wigs, I could only think of Eddie Murphy movies and how he had a knack for impersonating these types of characters. The place hits you as a throwback to life in the South maybe 50-60 years ago. Right by the front entrance, there's an old gas pump that reads ""Ethyl"" on top. All around the restaurant, there's an assortment of old advertising plaques, fishing supplies, obscure beer or soda bottles, jugs, and other antique American kitsch. Every light fixture in the place has a shade that is either a converted kettle, popcorn tin, or bait bucket. The whole place has a decor to it that feels like you're eating at somebody's back porch. While a chain like Famous Dave's tries to capitalize on this type of feel, Dixie Kitchen does it naturally.  On to the food. Once you sit down, the waitress brings a platter of about 6 hot corn pancakes and honey butter! That's right, light, fluffy butter with a touch of real honey. Since my wife wasn't into pancakes at dinner time, I pretty much had a free run and ate all of them with some of that awesome butter. My wife kept dipping her knife into the butter and licking it off. It's so yummy that you can eat it straight! I ordered a pulled pork sandwich and my wife got the baby catfish. For an appetizer, we got fried green tomatoes. For sides, we had coleslaw, red beans & rice, and black-eyed peas. About the only negatives were the rather uninteresting black-eyed peas and the coleslaw could use more vinegar. I'm used to a more acidic variety. However, the red beans & rice were delicious together. The fried green tomatoes were tender-cooked and had just the right amount of spicy zip. I was impressed with the amount of meat in my pulled pork sandwich. The meat was mildly spicy, tasted a little like chili flavor. Definitely not dry like I've had at other places. The baby catfish was a whole fish, tail, fins and all, breaded and fried. It too was delicious. The bones separated easily from the fish by peeling off the top and tearing out the entire spine. Very tender and not fishy-tasting. Though not included with the fish, ask for the tartar sauce. It's also got a home-made quality to its flavor and texture. At the end, we were too stuffed for dessert. We took home a whole baby catfish left over. And I made sure I got to keep my little container of honey butter too.",0.9951,0.885,0.112,0.004,0.5074616185271923

Fortunately my sweetie had been there before and could explain that they are not pancakes but cornbread jonny cakes. Now I don't like cornbread but I tried these and they were pretty tasty. I had cajun chicken with a side of yummy greens and red beans and rice. These were pretty darn good. My honey ordered the gumbo and it was loaded with spicy goodness.

2008-04-08,3.0,"Dixie Kitchen is soul food in Chicago. Or soul food close to the University of Chicago. One of my worst culinary habits is to continually attempt suicide by way of disgustingly fatty fried foods. We had the fried oysters, which were very good, and we had the breaded crawfish and corn balls with jalapeno jelly, which was delicious. Then I made the mistake of ordering the chicken-fried steak. Why I do such hateful things to myself, I'll never know. It was just so disgustingly greasy. Big mistake. But the collard greens with the jalapeno vinegar on the side were delicious. Too bad the grease of the steak was overwhelming. In fact, it was so overwhelming I don't remember what anyone else had.",-0.9539,0.737,0.072,0.19,0.7038888888888888

2008-02-05,3.0,"I think this was another case of my expectations being too high, as I'd been salivating over the very thought of Dixie Kitchen & Bait Shop since long before we actually tried it out. I must say, the johnnycakes they bring you instead of bread ARE innovative. Still, I wanted them to be 5-star good and they were more like 3-star good. Maybe 3.5-star good.  That said, Steve had chicken fried steak, and he REALLY loved it. I mean, he doesn't get excited about many things, but he was EXCITED about his meal. I think he may have called it ""the best"" or ""one of the best"" or something like that, and apparently he knows his chicken fried steak. On the flip side, I got the pulled pork sandwich, and WHOA! WHOA NELLY! It was HOT! H-O-T hot super duper hot hot HOT levels of hot. Like, I took one bite and I was done for, I couldn't eat it. That kind of hot. Although, it must be mentioned that I AM sort of a wuss when it comes to these things. But Steve tried it and even he said, yeah, that's really hot. I just didn't feel like there was any sort of warning on the menu for how hot it was going to be. I wasn't prepared. But maybe I should have been able to figure it out myself if I knew a bit more about Southern food. The mashed sweet potatoes that I got on the side were yum, though. Steve's mashed regular potatoes were okay. I ate his corn, which was also okay, but I really only ate it because I wasn't eating my main dish and I was hungry. It was really sort of blah. I would have eaten his corn muffin, too, except it was also hot (jalapenos). Oh, but the peach tea is good, and our waiter was also HOT, but in an enjoyable, dreadlocked way, so that was nice!",0.996,0.781,0.192,0.026,0.6328760683760685
