For example, I told her my girlfriend food is not edible because there's too much fat in it. She persisted to tell me that there wasn't any fat in her food. So then I had to show her all the fat that was in her food. She tried to tell me that that wasn't fat that its normal for chicken to be chewy. I could see where this is going. Then another person comes out of the kitchen with raw chicken in a bowl and shoves it in my face. And says see there's no fat. At this point I felt like I was being pranked. Soon after that I asked for a check. Of course she charges for the whole thing, I don't really care!! I just wanted to go somewhere else to get something to eat. She asks us if we wanted A to go box for that food. I just said Can we just have a check so we can go please.",-0.8935,0.883,0.026,0.091,0.5991538461538461

She was still not satisfied, then she took out a calculator and showed me how much I needed to pay for tip! Since the waitress was from northeast China, where people are well known as rude, unreasonable, and collude with gangdom, I didn't think it's a good idea to argue with her, especially when there was no mobile network coverage in case I needed to call police.

By the time I was well rested it was pretty late, so my fiancee and I decided to have a late lunch in China town. We found Double Li on yelp and went with gut instinct. We had a hard time finding it due to the way its entrance is set up. Also due to the odd hour, we were the only ones there. The place looked pretty run down and not very appealing. Call it being hungry or adventurous, we decided to give it a shot! BEST DECISION EVER! We were in a mood for some dumplings and fish in chilli sauce, both of which did not disappoint! The food was delicious and everything we imagined. I wish we had more of an appetite to try something else. The hostess who seemed also like the owner was very warm. We had some fabulous fish in schezwan sauce in Boston, since then we have been craving and looking for that entree everywhere. I can happily say we found it in Chicago.

2012-07-27,4.0,"When I walked into this unassuming restaurant by chance a few days ago I knew I'd hit a home run. There were hand-writtten Specials in Chinese characters pasted to the wall, which indicated I would find some authentic Chinese food. All I had wanted to do was to  escape from the 105F heat after traipsing around with a 7 year old to buy a pink parasol to match her cheongsam.  Problem: The 7 year old only eats food that has no color or taste and my 20-something daughter, who was with us, doesn't like anything cooked with oil. I like spicy food, the more oil the better. What to do?  The menu choices and the cheerful willingness of the restaurant to accommodate everyone's wishes saved the day. From the menu we ordered a noodle soup (for the 7 year old), and a vegetable and tofu soup as a back up. The flavors of both were delicate but delicious and everyone loved them. The 7 year old gobbled up the noodles, of course, and even asked for more of the tasty broth.    My daughter asked if they could prepare for her a steamed vegetable dish with steamed chicken (not on the menu, for understandable reasons). It turned out to be a good call because the 7 year old surprised us both by woofing the broccoli and pea pods -- and they're not even white! I gave the steamed stuff a miss, but to please me we also ordered a spicy beef dish from the menu that was truly delicious. Even my daughter agreed. The 7 year old passed on that one.  I don't go to Chinatown very often because there are not many restaurants whose food tempts me back, but I'll certainly be going back to Double Li. In China I've eaten some great food, hard to find in most restaurants here, but that spicy beef dish was the real deal.",0.9922,0.815,0.157,0.028,0.4418027210884353

2012-03-30,5.0,"Needed some dinner with my fiance before seeing a movie on a Saturday night and the wait at Lao Sze Chuan was 40 minutes.  So I pulled up Yelp and tried to find something decent that wasn't going to take forever, and wasn't Phoenix since we eat there all the time and I was insisting on something new. We found Double Li tucked away in an unassuming area directly across from the arch that takes you into the main Chinatown strip. *** FOOD (5 stars) *** First off, their menu is huge.  Don't be overwhelmed. The Szechuan Dumplings are what I was hoping for, dumplings served in essentially a soup of sauce that you fish out on a spoon. The sauce was great, but the dumplings themselves were a little light on flavor. We also ordered a pork dish that I'm blanking on but was essentially julienned pork, celery, and bamboo with a nice sauce.  And my fiance got a shrimp dish with I think a black bean sauce that was also good. By far the best dish, and perhaps one of the best dishes of Chinese food I've ever eaten in my entire life (and I have eaten a lot) was their home-style chicken special.  Picture a metal pot brought to your table and filled with mushrooms, bamboo, tons of dried chiles, a million szechuan peppercorns, and bite-size chunks of chicken (some still on the bone) that is both crispy, and extremely juicy at the same time. My fiance HATES spicy food and I can't get enough.  She was brave enough to try this after she smelled how good it was, and because the peppercorns numb your tongue to the heat (and make your mouth tingle), she was able to eat this, and even she agreed it was unreal how good it was. If you go here, you MUST MUST MUST order this dish. I couldn't stop eating it, literally, and almost ate myself sick. *** Service (5 stars) *** Contrary to other reviews, our service was great.  We had a very nice waitress who explained everything to us, talked to us about the restaurant, the food, etc.  She even went into detail about how the home-style chicken is made because it is her favorite dish too. *** Atmosphere (3 stars) *** They aren't going to win any design contests.  However if you enjoy small and cozy hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurants with amazing food, this is where you go.  I personally enjoy that environment.",0.9956,0.795,0.159,0.046,0.5999953946762456

2012-03-11,5.0,"Double Li is tucked away in a less-traveled part of Chinatown, yet it is perhaps the best restaurant for the price in the neighborhood.  Double Li serves Sichuan/Szechuan food, which is quite spicy in its native form. If you come with a friend who is less into incendiary culinary delights, they have milder foods that are also quite good.  We went to Double Li last Sunday in the evening, and the restaurant was quite empty. A waitress asked us if we would like our groceries refrigerated, which we were very grateful for (grocery stores in Chinatown close earlier than the restaurants). We ordered dry spicy chicken, peapod sprouts, and pig feet with tofu (the latter were a special, listed on the wall). Dry spicy chicken and peapod sprouts are old favorites of ours. The peapod sprouts are quite pricey for being just a vegetable dish, but at $10 they are worth every penny. The chicken is crunchy and pleasant, spicy, but not overmuch so, with a nice complex flavor. The heat does not linger, which is a plus if you don't want to rip your face off in terrible pain after the meal (Yes, I am looking accusingly at you, Spicy Boiled Anything...). The pigfeet were a great gamble (O Piggy, O Piggy, how I have wrung my brain to name all your delicious parts!). The waiter was kind enough to describe the dishes on the wall, which all appear to be dishes catering to the Chinese clientele. So, if you are feeling adventurous (ie, you would not mind if your food has a beak or toe joints, or in any way resembles a real animal), go ahead and ask, unless you are Chinese. If you are Chinese, you probably don't need to be reading this anyway.  The cloven delights really merit their own paragraph, better yet, a novella. They came after the other food. According to the waiter, the special mega-soft tofu takes a long time to make. I speculate that the tofu was made from scratch on the spot. It was fantastic, ultra soft and smooth, and floating in delicious pork soup. The feet were a tale of three parts. The skin was fatty and slightly chewy, with tufts of hair decorating certain parts (oh man up, you weak willed Americans), the gooey inner foot jello was ultra tasty, filling, meaty, and super sticky, and the meat was the best pork I've ever had, no joke. Use a spoon, since the foot is basically a glue trap for your face and hands. The dish was very mild, and while not for everyone, you should try it if you can. Double Li has perennially served excellent food for the last six years of our combined patronage. If you are looking for servile servers, you are either David K, the most lacist reviewer on Yelp, or confused. The service is efficient, never hovering, and as quick as they can make it. If you come during a crowded time, be prepared to wait a while. If you come at an off-time, your food delivery speed is limited by physics only.  FYI, I am actually a cat, I can type in English for 60 secs after I take a huge rip, meow, meow meow.",0.9977,0.783,0.173,0.043,0.4713517665130568

The server yelled at me because they were short-staffed and all I asked was if I could come back in 1 hour for my table.  And she did this in front of all the customers.  I felt embarrassed since everyone was looking at me to see what was going on.  To make matters worse, she was speaking to me in Chinese and everyone probably thought I said something nasty to her.  I left the place immediately, but was definitely humiliated by the server.  Not a good way to treat your frequent customer.",0.8654,0.875,0.084,0.042,0.37027777777777776
2011-10-17,1.0,"I'd been here about a year and a half ago and really had a lot of different foods and had a great experience all around, well except for a few taste buds burnt to a crisp from the seasonings. Based on my memories of my other visit I decided to go back today and give myself a treat for lunch. I wish I'd have gone to McDonald's instead! The only reason I'm giving the Double Li 2 stars is because the restroom was very clean and smelled of bleach.  I started my lunch with pot stickers. The pot stickers themselves were a little overcooked and a couple of the 6 were downright crunchy. They had very little flavor, so it's hard to say if they were good or bad the taste was so faint.  As for the sauce that comes with the pot stickers it was OK. It wasn't the best or worst pot sticker sauce I've ever eaten.  For my main course I had sweet and sour shrimp that came with white rice. Maybe I'm just naturally a cheap person, but it seems to me that for $12 for a regular priced meal (as in NOT a $5 lunch special) I'd think it should come with a soup and an egg roll. At the time I was so disappointed in the 2 items I did get that I couldn't figure out what was missing until just now when typing this paragraph. OK, based on that I'm now bumping my review down to a 1 star rating.  The sweet and sour shrimp was totally absent of flavor. Neither the coating on the shrimp or the shrimp itself had any flavor whatsoever except for the oil it was cooked in. I got so desperate for some flavor that I was totally drowning it in sweet and sour sauce and even that was almost flavorless. Normally even in the worst Chinese restaurants the sweet and sour sauce has lots of flavor, but not here today.  As far as the rice goes apparently they are no longer serving good Asian rice and have gone to using the terrible flavorless American grown variety. If they're going to serve flavorless food the least they could do is serve a good rice with it.  I'm not exaggerating the least bit when I say I'd have enjoyed my lunch much more if I'd have stopped at McDonald's for a double cheeseburger and a coke. I'm not a big fan of McDonald's so that's a pretty good indication of how disappointing this lunch was. Oh, I guess I should give them credit the coke was from a can so it was good.  I went to Double Li's expecting to have a 4 or 5 star eating experience like I did last time I was there and walked away $20 plus a tip poorer. The server was friendly so I felt she earned her tip even if the kitchen staff had tried their best to make it almost impossible for her to have happy customers.  Shame on Double Li I will NOT be returning to this establishment in the future. In the last year and a half they've completely dropped their standards. There are to many other good to great restaurants in Chinatown for me to waste my money at this place again. P.S.  Unlike a previous diner I was given both a lunch menu and a regular menu when I sat down.  I was prepared to insist on it based on a previous review, but they at least did provide both to me.  So I guess the other reviewers experience is not necessarily the norm here which is good.",0.9858,0.774,0.139,0.088,0.45442125995697435

Also, I can report that the food was OK, but far inferior to Lao Sze Chuan, which is in the big mall two blocks away.  The dry chili chicken here was breaded, and the breading prevented the dish from being smoky and spicy as it is prepared at Lao Sze Chuan (and in China, as well).  Soup was standard, boring, nothing special.",-0.6172,0.852,0.062,0.085,0.47434715821812584

The decor was less than appealing but boasted hand written signs filled with elegant characters that can often be a sign of authenticity. Decor aside, I came to eat, so this was no issue for me. We decided to try the Yelp applauded Garlic beef tenderloin and szechuan eggplant. I also slurped a starter of hot and sour soup which was lacking heat (until I added chili oil) but certainly had that musty fungi flavor and not too salty taste I enjoy. The tenderloin came next, and it was tasty, yet as others have mentioned, overly salted and a bit to pungent on the garlic. Overall, I really enjoyed the dish, but I think it would be best split between 3+ people so as not to be overwhelmed by the powerful flavor. I did my fair share of sweating towards the end of the meal.

Appetizer:  green onion pancakes.  My kids have been missing east coast style scallion pancakes.  These weren't quite as good as the best there, but were delicious nonetheless.  Kids enjoyed them. Dishes: Salt and pepper soft shell crab:  excellent.  This is one of the better salt/pepper fried seafood dishes I've had as they added quite a bit of roasted garlic and diced onions to the mix.  There was just a hint of chili pepper.  It could have used more kick for me, but it did allow us to give our 5 year old a try (2 thumbs up). Black pepper garlic beef tenderloin: outstanding.  I see that several others have reviewed this dish.  The beef packs a mixture of intense flavors including chili, pepper, intense garlic, and sweetness wrapped into a fried crust.  It gives spicy lamb cumin dishes a run for their money in the flavor category. Beef with oyster sauce: we hit the ""standard fare"" for the kids as 1) they don't like spicy food and 2) they never fail to clean the plate.  Personally I'd give this an average rating, but then again I knew that it wouldn't be memorable when we ordered.  It was a bit greasy with thick sauce, but was actually quite tasty.  Overall it was a very good rendition. Extras:  some of the clay pots ordered by other tables gave off the most incredible aromas.  I eyed the hot pots jealously.  Also, the bathroom was reasonable.

I had a month where every other day I went to a different restaurant in Chinatown to eat lunch...needless to say I had not landed on anything that would inspire me to write a review. My search has finally led me to a place worthy of my time. Hands down this place has some of the tastiest Chinese food I've had in a while. Of course not all the things we ordered were mind blowing, but we had Kung Pao, Peppered Beef, Scallion Pancakes, and quite a few other items that I would put in the great category. Now the hot and sour soup was just like everywhere else...uneventful and well just o.k. And, the use entirely too much celery as a filler on the plates. Which is totally unnecessary because 8 of us ate there for about $100.00 including tip. They could totally just give you the same amount of the main course and ditch the fillers.  The service was a lot like other comments as things just arrived when they arrived. We were ready for it, and just served ourselves family style as it came out. The place is relatively small, and a bit dingy, but normal for a small establishment. The funniest thing was when we finally noticed that ""I heard it through the grapevine"" was on a short skip repeat for nearly 30 mins. It made it clear to us that service and ambiance are not as high on the priority list as the food..all said and done, I could live that just fine. My advice chill out and eat good food here.

I don't understand how one can visit a Szechuan restaurant and complain about the spiciness, but whatever, 'cause if you go to Double Li you'll be on a flavor rollercoaster ride to remember. (Ha. Ha. Ha.) Seriously, I have never been to China and I have absolutely no idea what real, honest-to-goodness Chinese food tastes like. Which is what makes my reviews of Chinese food important because I'm not bringing any purist, condescending, ""it's not authentic enough"" or ""it's too Americanized"" baggage to the metaphorical table.  All I have to say is: best. tofu. ever. I have had a lot of tofu in my time. I have made fresh tofu. I have eaten tofu straight out of the container. I have eaten it fried, baked, smoked, you name it. Double Li serves the best Kung Pao Tofu I have ever had, it's actually crispy. How many times have I gone to a restaurant and been served soggy tofu? Is Double Li the only restaurant in Chicago that can fry up a crispy tofu?  The szechuan peppercorns are a revelation. Seriously, I don't think I've ever actually had a szechuan peppercorn at a szechuan restaurant. Amazing.  I didn't really notice the service as I was too busy eating the tofu, but I will say that I dropped by in the late afternoon and there were only two other tables, so if you've had slow service here you might want to consider showing up early.

I'm giving them a bit of benefit of the doubt, because I know if we were eating our dishes family style, it would not have mattered. But we had to ask where the third dish was and never got an answer just an ""Oh.""

For a vegetable we ordered the yu xiang broccoli. I love yu xiang pork and yu xiang eggplant, and was prettty psyched to see it with Western broccoli. Alas, the Chinese description ""yu xiang leafy broccoli"" was nowhere to be seen on the plate. The English description (garlic sauce American broccoli) also wasn't accurate, as it was just steamed broccoli with overcooked soy sauce that showed up. We coudn't even finish it. We also tried the cong you bing, green onion pancakes, which were great. Maybe a touch oily and could use a bit more green onion, but I'd get them again in a heart beat.

The weird part came after the meal.  My husband asked for more rice to take home with our leftovers and the server refused.  This all went down in Chinese, and since he's a little rusty and the server might not be a native Mandarin speaker, he asked again when she returned to our table.  She said that rice is expensive these days, but we thought it was odd that she didn't just tell us it would cost an extra dollar or two, which we would've been happy to pay.

The dry chili chicken was amazingly delicious - I was picking around in the pile of papery peppers looking for that one last nugget because it is so goddamn amazing.  The chunks are way crispier than at Lao Szechuan!  I've also had the basil chicken and honey chicken, both of which are well-cooked and covered in delicious sauce.  The home-style (ma la) octopus and rabbit were delicious and spicy, but they definitely trick you with the serving spoon.  These treats were better off picked up with a chopstick and shaken (to remove clinging peppercorns and chilis) rather than forked up.  And the three chili peppers next to these on the menu are no joke at all; the spice and ma la pepper are amazing and strong.  The garlic pepper beef is delicious and tender, and I'll always scoop up the leftover pile of spices to eat with my rice because it's THAT good.  Twice-cooked duck is also delicious, but overshadowed by the other dishes and my dislike for the celery which accompanies the shredded duck. Pocket tofu comes in airy soft quenelles with a delicate flavor, perhaps a little out of place amongst all the spice, although the tofu and vegetables are a good respite from such strong flavors.  If I remember, it included wood ear mushrooms, peapods, a few tomato slices, and some other green vegetable - peapod shoots perhaps?  Eggplant is also delicious here; it's always properly cooked so it melts in your mouth with its delicious sauces and accompanying meat.  And the peapod shoots?  To die for.  Somehow Double Li makes them the most savory, tender, and juicy vegetables ever.  I just wish I could convince my friends to order the vegetables more, but it's hard to overcome the idea that vegetables are steamed/boiled chunks of tasteless nutrition. Dan dan mian is delicious and authentic - none of that peanut junk.  The scallion pancakes are delicious, but lacking the crisp that you get when the pancake is straight from a street vendor, but in lieu of traveling all the way to China, I'll take 'em.  My friend got egg drop soup - it was good, but not phenomenal compared to other offerings. The restaurant itself is a pretty quiet, unimposing place.  The waitresses are nice, but ordering works in Chinese or straight off the menu.   Make sure to bring as many people as possible so you can try a variety of dishes, family style.  As a rough approximation, meat dishes cost $10-15, vegetable dishes cost $7-10, appetizers are in the $4-6 range.  The amount of food works out such that each person can order a plate and end up full, though appetizers and other accompaniments are always worth it.  When a crappy all-you-can-eat faux-Chinese buffet costs $8-10 these days, it's definitely worth it to gather up all your friends and go out to chow down on authentic and delicious food instead.",0.9988,0.734,0.222,0.044,0.598965811965812

2009-03-09,5.0,"I think I've found my place in Chinatown.  Sure, I've eaten some great food, but nothing that's made me kick myself for not trying it earlier. My boyfriend had mentioned this place right after they opened, and we promptly forgot about it.  A couple weeks ago, he mentioned it again, and since I just got my tax return, I thought we could go have a nice dinner on Uncle Sam. Double Li is located on Cermak near Wentworth; there's some meter parking, and it's pretty close to the red line and the archer bus.  Anyway.  When you walk in, you have to walk to the back by where the kitchen and counter are to get seated. We got our table, and the server promptly brought us a pot of tea and the menus.   The menu is huge, and spans from the standard Ameri-Chinese to more authentic Sichuan delights.  Save the Ameri-Chinese for your neighborhood joint and stick to the Chef's recommendations on the first page of the menu and you'll be in good shape, because the chef, Ben Li (one of the two Li's) is a formally trained Sichuan chef.   Since there were only two of us, we tried not to over-order, and got the pocket tofu, the black pepper garlic beef tenderloin, and the baby octopus in spicy sauce.  Of course, this was too much food, but we like leftovers.   The pocket tofu came out about 15 minutes after we placed the order--this is a beautiful dish. Fresh snow peas, pea shoots, and wood ear mushrooms surrounded little ""quenelles"" of tofu. This was a delicately flavored dish, with the smooth and creamy tofu balanced by the fresh, lightly cooked veggies, and light white sauce. There was a definite chicken aroma to this dish, but we couldn't agree on whether the chicken was in the sauce (as broth) or in the quenelle itself.   We received the black pepper garlic beef next. Wow. This was unlike any beef I had ever tried before. It was super crispy, buttery, and peppery-but-not-hot. It was served with some lightly steamed broccoli to round out the plate. I could only eat a few bites of this as I found it to be too rich for my tastes, but my boyfriend declared it one of his favorites.   My choice, the baby octopus in a spicy sauce, came out last. Chef Li delivered this to our table himself. This was served in a pot, with lots of little baby octopuses in a fiery sauce. These were delightful. Spicy, with that kick from the Szechuan peppercorn--awesome. Little tiny mushrooms that soaked up all that oil and sauce at the bottom--awesome. I loved this.   Service was harried, as there was only one server working in the entire room of maybe 10-ish tables. But everything came out in a timely manner, and not only did the chef come out to deliver one of our dishes, he came back to check to see if we liked everything and answer some of our questions. So, overall, I thought the service was great.   A word of warning:  this food is not toned down for American tastes. It will be spicy. Sometimes there will be things that you don't recognize. But it will be delicious.   I'm so glad we tried this place, after probably at least a year of talking about it. There's so many things to try on the menu, I think we'll be back many, many times to try them all.",0.9982,0.828,0.151,0.021,0.5527713773681516
2009-02-21,5.0,"Holy moses. I haven't had food this good since I was actually in mainland China years back.  I was out with a dozen friends, to celebrate the return of a friend of ours who happened to live there teaching English at a school in Shanghai. So in celebration, we order at least ten plates of all different types of dishes - all Schezuan style. You could smell the dishes a million miles away. Hot, steaming, bubbling for some in their iron cast pots. Spicy tofu, lamb stew, beef with snow peas, chicken and black peppers, and so much more. And much to our surprise, it came in amazingly fast given the vast quantity of food we ordered. I'm talking no more than 30 minutes to serve a dozen very hungry individuals. And the best part? Or should I say, several. The bill, was very low all things considered. Two, we all wanted to die, but we would die exquisitely happy. Three, for some unknown reason, we kept grabbing more food from the plates even though we all knew we were past our limits. Four, our noses were at one point or another running with complete satisfaction. And finally? There was still an unbelievable amount of food left to eat. Bloody hell. I should remind you however, that at least half of what we ordered most certainly wasn't on the menu. Given that myself and our visiting friend knew some of the local delicacies served on the mainland, we sorta had a leg up on the situation. Especially when we tried to order in mandarin. But I digress. The restaurant doesn't look fancy or anything. It's a no frills, family owned establishment. It just so happens though, that they're not willing to alter or water down traditional recipes just so foreigners don't have to chug down a case of antacids or have a heart attack. And that's something you should always look for. Real, unadulterated, Chinese food. Schezuan style. And for the love of god. Vegetables with meat. If there's more, then eat more. There's a reason why asians have such a high life expectancy.",0.8478,0.823,0.103,0.074,0.4832436162870945
2009-01-30,4.0,"My friends talked me into having a group dinner at Double Li one short week after having had a terrible experience at Lao Szechuan across the street.  Long story short, my visit to Double Li redeemed the standing of Szechuan style Chinese food in my eyes after an angry week of being ""done"" with Lao Szechuan.  The five of us had three dishes I would recommend.  1) chili chicken  2) fish with tender tofu 3) garlic pea shoots. Chili pods in chili chicken would have benefited from stir frying whole, but the crispy, fried skin on chicken was tender and juicy. Very nicely seasoned. Fish with tender tofu was prepared in a style similar to MaPo Tofu. The dish features silken tofu and an abundance of Szechuan peppercorn -- it numbs the tongue and is a marker of authentic Szechuan cuisine. The pea shoots were not the best, or most tender I've had, but totally serviceable. Other stuff to know: the managers answered the phone in Chinese. My friends who called earlier (and asked in English) had difficulty figuring out if they are BYOB. I called and asked in Chinese -- they were quite nice -- and was told they are.  It's a bit of a hole in the wall, so it's not a great place for dates, but rather for groups of friends. Though my expectations were at a historical low my recent experience with Szechuan at Lao Szechuan) the food far, far surpassed them.",0.4837,0.828,0.092,0.08,0.47916666666666674
2009-01-27,3.0,"Maybe Double Li's flavors don't jive with what I want because I can appreciate what they are doing. I simply am not so excited about the tastes. We ordered the black pepper garlic beef, the bacon with peapods, and eggplant (we got cucumber). The beef was great and about as peppered as anything that I have eaten. The bacon dish was not to my liking. It was too wet. It may conventional in this cuisine to sauce everything, but to me it forced the bacon to be soggy and gave it an off flavor.  Given the vast praise, a second trip is in order. Maybe I need to adjust my order.",0.4657,0.846,0.09,0.064,0.4322751322751323

All in all, the broths were the star of the meal here.  They have a deliciously spicy broth side by side with an extremely flavorful clear broth.  The broths make the meal.  I was less impressed with the items that are available to dip.  These were probably better at Lao Szechuan.  I'm an advocate of the shitake mushrooms, the napa cabbage, and the vermicelli.  Most of the other stuff was pretty blah.",0.9864,0.772,0.209,0.019,0.6206140350877193
2008-11-05,5.0,"After finishing a stint in Shanghai this summer, I had to find a local place to find Authentic Chinese food. I did some searching around, and ran across Double Li restaurant in Chinatown. After eating there, I know I have found the place. I took a group of friends to this place, in hopes to show them what REAL chinese food was like. At this point, I wasn't sure how authentic it would be, but based on some info I read, I had high hopes and expectations. The restaurant itself is basically an unadorned, simple dining room tucked inside the lower floor of a larger building. Though plain, the dining room was clean, organized, and quiet.  A few key dishes I had to order included some roasted duck, Ma po Tofu, and a sichuan (szechwan) fish dish (shui zhu yu, or ""water boiled fish). This dish consists of a type of catfish, which is boiled in a light oil with various chilies and peppers. One of the peppers is called the sichuan peppercorn. It has an interesting numbing effect when eaten. Truly a unique sensation! We also ordered bitter melon, some garlic-flavored beef tenderloins, and a few others. Ordering was a bit difficult, since most of the items were written just in Chinese. But, the waitress was kind enough to help out without being impatient. I also got to use a bit of the Mandarin I picked up, but the staff understood English much better than what little I learned. The food was brought out as it was prepared, so we didn't wait for everything at once. Since everyone was sharing, that was not a problem. So, does Double Li meet my criteria for having authentic Chinese cuisine? Without a doubt! Save the bitter melon (a bit too bitter for my taste), everything was delicious. And, if you aren't quite ready to try some of the more interesting dishes, they do offer a selection of more familiar dishes. You won't regret this culinary voyage to the far east.",0.9806,0.752,0.162,0.086,0.4796862310815799
2008-07-31,5.0,"I had dinner at Double Li last night and am already looking forward to going back.   The dining room was nearly empty when we walked in, with only two or three tables occupied.  The room is small and sparsely decorated, but honestly, it's all about the food.  The menu is divided into the usual sections: appetizers, pork, chicken, seafood, beef, with a short list of dim sum items on the last page.  The extensive menu lists the most commonly found Chinese-American dishes along with what appears to be more traditional cuisine.  Previous reviews suggest that translation might have been necessary at one point, but the menu we saw last night listed all items in English and Chinese, as did the specials list at each table.     When we were placing our order, my dining companion tried to order Governor's chicken, but our waiter paused, then asked if he would like to try something different.  We were slightly surprised by the uninvited suggestion, but our waiter seemed genuinely motivated to steer us toward the best items on the menu.  Our waiter suggested the garlic-basil chicken, and was so effusive and polite in the way he went about it, that my dining companion agreed to it.  I had noticed the ""baby octopus szechuan style"" on the specials list, and not wanting to possibly miss something better, asked our waiter what his thoughts were.  He assured me that it was very good, and feeling confident in his approval, placed my order.   The chicken came out first in a cloud of warm garlic aroma.  It was very good, with an intense flavor, but not overwhelming.  Garlic-heavy dishes can easily become obnoxious, but this was very well-balanced.  When the chicken was served, we received a pot of tea as well.   Shortly after the chicken came to the table, a waitress presented a large glazed clay pot and removed the lid.  My dining companion's and my eyes opened wide as steam billowed up from a hissing, popping pool of oil tinted dark red from dried chilies that sent up malevolent fumes of deep, dark, unadulterated capsaicin.  Before I could lift my chopsticks, he said, ""Wait... just *smell* that...""  We must have looked comically awestruck.  Piled high in the pot were the tiniest octopus I've ever seen... heads intact and no more than an inch and a half long.  Nestled in among the octopus was the occasional mushroom, and what I believe was a bit of eggplant here and there, but for the most part, those red chilies.  It was delicious.  The octopus was very fresh, tender and hot like love.  Our entrees were served each with a small bowl of white rice, and as our waiter set them down, he told us that if we wanted more, to just ask him.   For a first visit, I couldn't have asked for a better experience.  The food was excellent, the prices are very reasonable, and the service was enthusiastic and sincere.  I know I'll be back soon.",0.998,0.811,0.169,0.02,0.5322994708994708
