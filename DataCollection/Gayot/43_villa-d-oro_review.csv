2008-08-18,5.0,"Outstanding. We moved back towards the lake, and this Italian gem is truly missed. Huge Portions of steaming Italian goodness--the service is unexceptional, but never rude, so no biggie there. If you are a fan of eggplant this is the place--never have had better then the Eggplant Siciliano. Ever. Great deal on pizza Monday-Thursday as well--large single topping and a pitcher for under $20.",0.9466,0.661,0.272,0.067,0.4265873015873016
2008-04-02,4.0,"You have to love that there are still the traditional mom and pop type restaurants like this doing good business in the city.  I love Villa D'oro for the atmosphere as well as the food.  People remember you when you come back - even if it's not for a while and the portions and pricing is always reasonable.  I wish I lived in the areaagain, just writing this!",0.9577,0.751,0.249,0.0,0.525
2007-07-10,3.0,"The first time I went here it didn't seem like they got any business at all. We were able to get a great table right away with hardly anyone else in the entire building, I've been there when it was full though. There are basically two rooms in the place. One of them has a small TV which I've only ever seen baseball games on, smokers section. The other is a slightly bigger room with more decoration, busts, lights, plants, it's actually really cute. They have a bar which I've never seen anyone behind all the time unless someone ordered a drink. There is also a sound system back by the bar playing music like Frank Sinatra and Tony Bennett, which really cements the mood. The food itself is super awesome, Italian food of course, they've got place mats that have a map of Italy and Sicily. The staff is friendly for the most part and the prices are average for Italian joints but for big group doings there aren't any special prices so it can be relatively expensive, not always worth it...Desserts too were really good. Not a lot of places you can go to observe the owner when it's slow eating, smoking and watching TV in the other room, not that it's bothersome, just kind of funny.",0.9365,0.863,0.102,0.035,0.5105699855699855
2005-09-10,4.0,I enjoy the pasta from here.  The prices were very reasonable and the server was attentive. The food and the decor are authentic Italian. It's very down to earth here so dress casual.,0.6461,0.85,0.15,0.0,0.596031746031746
