2011-02-06,3.0,"The whole experience was sort of ruined by The Guacamole Incident, but let me set that aside for a moment.  I came in on a Saturday evening, and while I was waiting for my dining pal, the bartender set me up with a couple of $5 mojitos.  And let me tell you, these were damn good mojitos, not just for $5, but in general.  They were also serving $4 glasses of sangria that night which we did not try. So we got a lovely table by the open front windows (this was back when it was warm...remember those days?) and ordered the calamares a la plancha--delicious.  My entree was the chicken fajitas.  Based on reviews, I expected a gigantic mound of awesomeness; what I got was a moderate serving of a-okay fajitas.  There was nothing wrong with them; they were just fajitas.  There were a couple of unorthodox vegetables such as broccoli, but that was fine. So what happened with the guacamole?  Well, here is a succinct version.  We order guacamole for an appetizer, and the waitress says, ""We don't have any guacamole tonight.  They delivered a big case of unripe avocados yesterday.""  Okay, major bummer.  Based on other reviews, my friend and I had both been looking forward to it all day.  Well, sometimes things happen, and I get over it. When the fajitas come, there are little cups of sour cream, salsa, cheese, and...guacamole.  Obviously we are both surprised.  When the waitress comes to check up, I say, ""So I guess they found a bag of avocados back there, huh?""  ""Oh...yeah, I guess so.  Is it any good?""  No apology, no explanation, no offer to get us the appetizer order that we had originally requested. After she walks away, I start looking around the dining room and observe several tables with the larger-sized portion of guacamole.  I take a little walk to the men's room and count four tables enjoying guacamole at that moment.  That's when I get really aggravated. So at that point, I decided to bypass the waitress and speak directly to the manager (after our meal was done).  I think that it may have been the owner.  In any case, she made a few apologies, a few excuses, and ultimately took care of it by giving me a chit for a free guacamole and an empanada.  The point that I made to her was that I wasn't bothered so much by the lack of guacamole as by the indifferent service.  Our waitress should have come out to our table as soon as she heard or saw that the kitchen was making guacamole, to ask if we wanted any at that point.  And when we asked her about it, she was almost snide, let alone helpful or apologetic. EPILOGUE: So how were the guacamole and empanada? Well, I never got to find out, because the restaurant closed before I could redeem them.  I wanted to return anonymously, so I waited a while and carried that card around for months.  I over-thinked myself out of a free meal.  And now you know...the rrrest of the story.",0.9874,0.833,0.113,0.054,0.4664285714285714

2010-01-05,2.0,"A resounding meh. My friends and I walked into this place last Saturday after our original restaurant was closed for some reason.  We found this place and figured we would give it a go, which is a real shame, since there are other places in the neighborhood that I would've liked to try. Ordered the calimari appetizer, which was fine, it's calimari, not a million ways to fuck it up.  Tried to order the beef croquets, but they were out of them, so instead I got the tequilla pulled pork.  Placed before me was a greasy pile of pork smothered in cheese (no cheese was mentioned on the menu, and even though this is a Mexican place, pointing that out might be helpful), with greasy and overly thick home made tortilla chips.  My roommate and I shared the seafood paella.  The flavor was ok, the rice was dry, and for $18 the portion was small.  Our other friend tried a fish dish, i forget what it was exactly, it came with a mole sauce that was ok, the fish was pretty obviously from a farm, and again, majorly expensive, $18 also, for something that just wasn't that good. Then there was the service.  OH BOY!  My friend asked whether her dish came with rice or potatoes, a fairly basic question, and the waitress had to walk to the kitchen to get an answer!  Nice girl I'm sure, bad waitress unfortunately.  It took probably 20-30 minutes for our entrees to come out after we got our appetizer, and the place was empty.  When a place is empty I guess I expect to be served quickly, but that wasn't the case here, be prepared to wait. This place is a boner.  Much better restaurants in the immediate area that you should check out first.  Ole Ole?  No way Jose!",0.9339,0.79,0.125,0.085,0.5135185185185185

Asscrackistan, or Flint, MI, etc.  Limited bar selection, a total of two wines, slow, timid service and bland everything else.  Threadbare fabrics that haven't been maintained since the grand opening complete the ambiance.  One star is because our server was nice, the other is because I feel sorry for her.  If this place is still in business in 12 mos., I'll print this review out and eat it.  (It'll probably taste like the nachos I had).",0.9273,0.779,0.149,0.072,0.5824603174603173

2009-07-22,4.0,"Brunchers, take note, I've got a deal for you! $15 for a brunch buffet , which includes one coffee or mimosa.  A buffet, you say?  Yes, like you, I was skeptical, as buffets usually spell gastronomical trouble.  This one steps away from what you might envision and brings to the table a touch of what Olé Olé can offer. First, there's a wide range of selections.  I mean wide.  That includes everything from your typical brunch fare, such as an omelette station, carving station, fresh fruit, and French toast, to chilaquiles and mac and cheese.  Plus, there's a meat fest of bacon and sausages.  Almost everything I ate was delicious, especially if you measure it by the ridiculous quantity I consumed.  I don't go into a food coma over just anything! Second, there's the coffee...oh, the coffee.  To quote my favorite Zen master, FBI Special Agent Dale Cooper, it was ""a damn fine cup of coffee"".  A word of warning: it comes with a price tag of $3, which seems a bit steep.  Though, for something strong in the morning with refills, it may be just what you're looking for. Since this is a fairly new thing, it seems as though they're still working out some of the kinks.  We walked in just after the brunch time started and the fruits, and desserts were still covered in plastic.  It wasn't clear that brunch was on, until a server finally came over and gave us the green light.  The plastic was never removed, so it was a little odd having to uncover things as you went through the line.  Also, it wasn't clearly spelled out what the drink deals are, if any.  Again, you get one mimosa or coffee with the brunch.  After that, the price tag becomes unknown.  A few minor bumps in an otherwise lovely brunch! For a small place that wasn't very busy, the service was a little sparse, though not terrible.  I get that I fill up my own plate.  I can't, however, fill up my own glass. On a seating note, a plus is sitting near the front of the restaurant when it's nice out and the windows are open.  You have a great vantage point of busy Clark Street, as well as a few less steps to the buffet.  The negative is sitting near the front of the restaurant, with a few less steps to the buffet.  As soon as more brunch-goers arrive, people will be crowding around behind you and filling their plates.  Sit there if it doesn't bother you. When I'm at a loss for a brunch spot in my neighborhood, this will likely be my answer.  Take a peek in if you walk by the window and see how my brunch baby is doing.  If I don't respond, the food coma has already set in.",0.9452,0.864,0.084,0.052,0.49566303193661676

My buddy and I are walking down Clark debating Sunday brunch, Ole Ole was not even on the short list, we stop out front mid discussion and look in, and suddenly we start talking a little bit quieter, about how it is only $15 and how bad could this all you can eat Sunday brunch be, and we both wanted to eat like yesterday so the idea of a buffet was surprisingly on point... We dove in! The place is not crazy busy and I get the feeling if it was they would need to change the logistics of this buffet, but for the level of business we have experienced; it is just right!  Since that first Sunday brunch I have been back with groups maybe 4 times...  Every time was just as good as the last! First you get a free mimosa or coffee with your buffet and all types of other free beverages to boot...  It varies but I have seen carrot juice, cranberry, mango, even milk it is all quite satisfying...  Did not even try it the first time, regret it now, the Mac and cheese is the best I have ever eaten, best I have ever eaten!!!!! The Ham is soo good!  The omelets are made to order...  The Beef selection is always good, and there are always wild cards like really good sweet and sour pork this last Sunday... The fresh fruit is unparalleled, fresh figs, blue berries, raspberries, all on a buffet I know right? crazy? The tiramisu is good enough to plate garnish and charge 8 dollars a slice, but there it sits in a big pan waiting for you! The service is so great! I love this place as long as it stays under-crowded and top quality I will find it hard to go anywhere else on a Sunday for brunch...

We started with mojitos all around which were very minty yet refreshing.  The Guacamole con Totopos were awesome!  Seriously some of the best guac I've had in a very long time and they were not stingy with it at all.  Easily the best part of the entire meal for me were the Empanadas.  We had both the spinach and sirloin and both were good, but the sirloin was my preference and I could easily have made a meal of these.  I wasn't crazy about the sauces that came with but really you don't even need them anyway.   This review is getting a tad long which I know is annoying so I'll wrap it up with a few other things we had.  There was a ceviche flight, fajitas, and the Pollo Relleno all of which were good.  Absolutely no complaints.  I should point out that the Pollo came with black beans on the side which my bf doesn't care for but was hesitant to ask about a sub.  The waiter noticed right away that he was hesitant about the beans and totally offered to sub any other side, no problem.  Nice.  At the end of the meal the owner came by our table and chatted with us for a bit.  She introduced herself, shook our hands, got our names, asked about our food, the service, and mentioned their brunch and asked us to come by again.  Great ending to a great meal.",0.9983,0.701,0.228,0.072,0.5888988095238095

2009-02-17,4.0,"Are you confused (like me) as to what exactly is Nuevo Latino Cuisine, other then being delicious!?! Well I asked around and pretty much got the same thing from everybody. Nuevo Latino Cuisine is contemporary Latin American and Latin fusion. It is unique interpretations based on classical recipes that go back centuries and covering ""Pan Latin"" (means everything Latin) regions, Argentina, Cuba, Brazil, and Puerto Rico to name a few.  Ole Ole was a great introduction into this new world!! First, they need more weekly business because on a Tuesday night from 5:30 to 7 we were the only couple in the entire place. Second, I can only say that others experiences may or may not be different during a full house. This review is based on the fact that we were spoiled by the staff and the chef.  When you walk in, the whole decor is very warm and inviting colors (dark reds, and rich browns). Seating by the front windows is nice (I'm guessing especially during the summer), some seating by the bar and then a set of stairs leading to a small second level full of booths and small tables. Just from walking by on the weekends this place gets packed. The service was outstanding but again we were by ourselves, any waiter that doesn't laugh at a guy who's face is full of guacamole is a very nice waiter.  As far as the food, if you like a plethora of textures, colors and flavors that are deep and rich, well then you'll like Ole Ole! Each bite was like something new, I only wish we tried more. I think I've found my new favorite guacamole place (And yes I did end up with a lot of it all over my face!!), the perfect blend of spices, cilantro, and chunky avocados. The fajitas were not only top notch but enough to feed 3 people. I don't know what kind of spice was on the chicken but it had a wonderful zing to it and the peppers were cooked perfectly.  The biggest shocker is that two people left with more then full bellies and leftovers for only $25.00, not bad at all. I'll be coming back.",0.9957,0.805,0.172,0.023,0.5772932717000512

2007-11-04,2.0,"I'll be upfront and say that I avoided going here for the longest time because I feared I would have to add yet another Spanish/Latin American/Mediterranean/Middle Eastern restaurant to my list of neighborhood restaurants to avoid. But Ole Ole seemed to be packing in the crowds for almost a year now, and the reviews on Yelp indicated a certain quality that I shouldn't be missing out on.  I had a good chance to study the decor while we waited around five minutes near the door for our presence to be acknowledged by an overworked waiter/host, who really had no idea how long a wait there would be for a table.  I can see what they're going for, and it's not too bad of an idea in terms of decoration. They're aiming at a fusion of modern and old world styles. The only parts of this that looks really nice are the iridescent red mosaic tiling near the bar and the mosaic lamps above it. The clean lines and metal of the modern chairs, tables, and counters are betrayed by the cheapness of their materials and construction. In a misguided attempt to make the space they're in look larger, they used glass paneling for a whole wall, making their modern emphasis look amusingly dated.  We sat at the bar while we waited for the table and another from our  party to arrive, and I was privy to one of the worst examples of gin and tonic I have ever had the privilege to not finish because it became nastier and nastier as time went on. Their was absolutely no love involved in its preparation, despite the relative calmness of the bar and the bored look in the bartender's eyes.  While it took quite some time for food and orders to happen, I'll chalk it up to being at the tail end of what surely (in the interest of charity) must have been a busy night. Our waitress was pleasant enough and really tried to thoroughly answer questions about items on the menu, and whenever food actually happened to be ready, it seems that she brought it out promptly.  Now I will talk about the food, which is the primary reason I will never come back here. As an appetizer I got the croquetas de jamon, which were quite possibly the worst croquetas I've ever had. I like croquetas and these were almost making me gag- even the frozen Goya ones are better. The breading was greasy on the outside, and besides containing too much of a spice that I couldn't really identify, the filling just tasted very strange.  The vegetable paella that I ordered was cooked pretty well, but it had absolutely no flavor outside of the oil. Just pointless, really. I can cook rice and throw vegetables in it, which is what this amounted to, but I would add spices.  Since everything here is a la carte, I also got a side of mashed yuca, which was also disappointing. It was dry, contained many tough bits, and only vaguely tasted like garlic. Hello- mashed yuca is essentially a garlic delivery system! Who are you trying to appeal to with that bland stuff? Have some integrity! Stand up for taste and flavor! I can only assume that the cooks/chef here have decided that cooking meats well can substitute for more subtle interplay of flavors you should be getting out of this sort of cuisine.  I really was prepared to give this place another shot, since the service can't be that bad all the time. But unless someone can convince me that the kitchen was also having an off night, or were exhausted from the previous hours, the food is just not nearly good enough to justify the fairly expensive a la carte prices attached each item.",0.9335,0.855,0.086,0.058,0.5117246157722348

2007-08-16,4.0,"I went here for dinner last Saturday and was pleasantly surprised. The Mosaic and fiery decor is nice and inviting. We had a couple of drinks at the bar and the bartender asked if we'd been there before and ran through the menu with us. The bar menu is basic with some imported beers, but still good and not watered down. The menu was better than basic and I had the pulpo carbon (it melted in my mouth - yes tentacles can melt (HAHA)) and tapas (empanadas, queso de cabra, and ceviche) which were all fantastic. If you like Octopus though, get it there, it is very good. For dinner we split a 12 oz tilapia with fruit and stuffing. It is not for the weak at heart. Had I have not had all of the tapas beforehand it would have been okay but at that point it was too rich (stuffed with crab and langosta and drizzled with a smoke marinade). However, we stayed and had many more drinks and talked to Carlos and enjoyed the relaxed atmosphere.

2007-08-04,3.0,"This place was better than I expected because I had never heard anyone talk about it, just seen it heading to other places in Andersonville, but I think I would probably go back and perhaps try some of the other more exotic dishes they have. There was a 30 minute wait on a Saturday night but fortunately there were a couple spots at the bar. Unlike some of the other reviewers complaining about watered down drinks, ours were very ""date friendly"" with tons of rum in the mojitos. Almost too much actually. We also had chips and pico - the pico was outstanding but you had to drop 4 bones for it. We were sat upstairs where the tables kind of feel like an afterthought. In a loud energized space like this, you want to feel a certain vibe and being upstairs by the kitchen and a wait station kind of ruins it. So if you can, ask for a table downstairs or better yet by the sidewalk where the entire front of the restaurant opens up to the street. But back to the food - we both had fajitas; i know i know, all the ""nuevo latino"" dishes all over the menu and we get f'ing fajitas - i guess we just wanted viejo latino.  The fajitas were good, they came with the usual complements of sides and some unremarkable corn tortillas which definitely were the same kind you get at the grocery store. Service was prompt and courteous but distant; just someone going through the motions.

2007-07-17,3.0,"3 stars from me. I went Friday night with my wife. The place was very full, so we were sat in the back of the restaurant. Normally, that isn't a big deal for me but they cram too many tables back there. The result is a very loud cacophony in what can be very tight quarters.  The food was good enough. We started with an appetizer (well it was really sort of pushed on us, but I'll get to that...) and drinks. Beer selection was decent. My wife found the Sangria to be lacking. The guacamole -- allegedly ""spicy"" -- was really quite bland, even for guacamole! My wife had the Tortilla Soup and  goat cheese & tomato sauce while I had the chicken borraccho.  We liked it all well enough.  Now, here's the problem... THE SERVICE. We were kind of pushed around by the server initially. After that we were kind of ignored. When he came back in the end, he noticed my wife hadn't really touched her food. She explained she wasn't feeling well. His concern seemed focused on whether she wasn't going to complain.  Server: ""The food was okay, though, right?"" Wife:  ""Well, like I said, I'm not feeling well. I don't have much of an appetite..."" Server: ""But it tasted okay?"" Wife: ""Well, being sick, I can't taste much of anything..."" Server: ""So nothing was wrong with then?"" Wife: ""Well, no. I guess."" Maybe he was distracted, dense or just plain dumb. I'll never know for sure. Regardless, it felt somehow typical of how he treated us. Everything felt a little off.   We'll give it another try. I liked my entree enough to go again.

They've packed too many tables in there to deal with their hipness, I suppose, and it's treacherous trying to move through the room.

2007-06-15,4.0,"At night, this restaurant is called ""Oleo,"" because the final ""l"" and ""e"" are burned out. C'mon folks, get on the ball. It's much nicer inside. Though you better like red, 'cause there's plenty of it! There's seating on two levels. The ground floor is brighter and more open, with direct access to the bar. The second level is raised a few steps and is more intimate. When I was in, no one was seated on the upper level, since the restaurant wasn't very busy. I imagine it can feel a bit like Siberia up there, but if you if you're looking to sneak away with your significant other, this would be a good choice. Ole Ole is a nice date place in general: it's a bit upscale, is beautifully decorated in rich colors with hanging lamps, and feels intimate. The food is ""Nuevo Latino,"" which pretty much means a little bit from everywhere. Ole Ole says it serves ""traditional"" Nuevo Latino cuisine, which seems a contradiction in terms. No matter. The food is very good, if not astonishing. There's a lot of seafood, some chicken and beef dishes, but not much in the vegetarian range. It's easy to make a full dinner out of the appetizers and tapas (the difference? not so sure), with a salad for good measure. Last time I was there, I had the octopus appetizer, which seemed more like calamari, but was still good. The ceviche is excellent -- very fresh. They also offer a ceviche flight, for those of you who don't like to mix your seafood. The salads and entrees are all good sized portions, so you can save a few bucks by doing some splitting. The food is not very spicy, so if that's what you expect, you may be disappointed. Service is good, but a little slow.
