He forgot water multiple times and forgot our food. On a not-so-busy night, he never put in our order for two four sliders and after 45 MINUTES, he came by to ask us if our food had ever come out. He was referring to the appetizers and tried to cover himself when he realized he had forgotten to put in our dinner order. So he lied and said they would be out soon and he went to put in the order. After another 15 minutes our food finally came.       So far our treatment was not good, but probably not warranting of a horrible yelp review. What makes it worthy was what he did with the bill. After hours of horrible service, he added 20% gratuity to a bill for a table of two!! My boyfriend and I are both servers and know very well how and when adding gratuity is appropriate and that was inexcusable. I have never once left a bad tip even if a server was a little forgetful and that night I blatantly ignored his assumption that we wouldn't review the bill and I left no tip at all.      Forget my food, fine. Add yourself a $12 tip- I'm leaving you nothing and never coming back.

2012-12-19,2.0,"Being in the neighborhood, I stopped in here on a lark one afternoon just to see what all the fuss was about.  Not that I've really heard anyone talk about the place so much, but I figured that a place that calls itself ""Hop Häus"" is trying to do a thing or two to advance craft beer.  I was wrong. First of all, adding an insipid, unnecessary and inaccurate umlaut to the German word Haus is insulting, and then, when you walk into a place whose name tries to hop (no pun intended) on to the craft beer craze, but only invested in four draft lines, you realize this all is just a joke. It was fairly early (around 3 pm), so I understand that the place was not heavily staffed...all told, about seven customers were in and out of the place while I was there.  At some point, the server and the bartender just disappeared, though, for about ten minutes.  The phone kept ringing and ringing, with no one answering. There is a definite lack of focus on attentiveness, which I would consider to be a major fault.  I had a couple sliders and some mac and cheese...sliders were all right, but the mini pretzel buns were dried out, which can be expected if you take such a tiny little thing and throw it on the broiler, even for twenty or so seconds.  The mac and cheese was craftless and dull.  When I left, the draft lineup was as follows: Heineken, Miller Lite, Sam Adams Winter Lager, Goose Island Green Line.  Give me a break. This place is either run by highly cynical, opportunistic people, total morons, or both.  Either way, where I might see potential points of improvement when visiting a place I don't care for, I really see no such thing here.  It might as well rename itself something sports-related and give up on trying to fool a hapless public.",-0.9902,0.811,0.035,0.153,0.5188940092165899

I chose to have 3 different sliders and I am not sure which one was worse. The lobster roll was alright since it came with a spicy mayo but I honestly do not even think this was lobster. It tasted like the imitation seafood you get in those plastic bags. I also chose to order the steak slider with blue cheese. I think there was one tiny crumb of blue cheese and the steak was so dry it was really difficult to swallow. Lastly I had the 'shroom' burger slider. It was very tasteless and the mushrooms were slimy. As my side I ordered mac and cheese with lobster and I was confused. There were two or three different types of noodles including lasagna noodles. It seemed like the kitchen ran out of elbow macaroni and just threw in whatever else they had on the shelf.  In addition to the poor quality of the food, the bathroom was about as awful as a truck stop outhouse. It was a relatively far walk down a cold hallway and was filthy.

Scrambled Eggs - Yes, even the eggs were bad.  They were undercooked, and tasted like maybe they were cooked in a pot that recently had something sweet in it.   Breakfast Potatoes - The potatoes were covered in a thick cheese sauce that was more of a cheese-flavored, heavy cream than anything.  There were also some random sliced red peppers on the potatoes, that helped distract from the awful sauce, but again, this was not something I imagine many people enjoying.

We ordered some beers and were pretty happy with the selection they had.  We almost got caught up in the games on the TV, and the guys working there were trying to pool money from everyone there to pay for the fight coming on.  I'm not really into that so I kindly reminded my man friend of the smell radiating from this place and he was nice enough to even help me finish my beer so we could get outta there.

Your small-town family doesn't want to go to Mercadito or Paris Club or Tavernita. They want to go somewhere that is just like where they came from. They want to go to Hop Haus.  And for good reason. The sports-themed walls and familiar enough tap beers offer a comfortable atmosphere that is relaxing and low maintenance, and lends itself well to showing up in whatever you and your loved ones happen to be wearing and chilling out without worrying that you won't fit in with the crowd. Just slide into a big booth and breath a sigh of relief that all the food will be palatable and that you won't have to answer concerned questions like ""oh, I don't about this, what is this now, 'ceviche'? Jenny, what IS that?! I don't think I can eat here, can we just find like an Applebee's or something?"" Oh, didn't you know? You ARE at Applebee's! So just relax and dig into your burger/wings/ nachos/calamari/fried ravioli/etc. Nothing to challenge your taste buds here! Just good old fashioned bar food that won't scare you back to Nowheresville. (To be fair, the calamari is pretty solid. And the burgers looked good.).  You can't totally avoid pitfalls, though.

2012-02-01,2.0,"I want to like Hop Haus. I REALLY do. It's like that awkward cousin that you avoid for fear of getting caught in odd conversation, but ends up earning your respect by carrying his weight in the bottle of old bourbon that grandma left out after Christmas dinner. However, at the end of the night, he's still awkward. The options are already desperately sad in that area and any place that has a fine beer list and potentially delicious food should jump right to the top of the list. Unfortunately, Hop Haus does not. When you first walk in you think, ""Ok, it's spacious, has a funny off-the-cuff decor featuring sports oddities and mishaps and even a pretty big bar area. This could be all right.""  While it is true that the beer list is satisfyingly crafty, that's about where the fun ends.  The menu has some interesting options (most notably the ostrich and boar sliders), but overall it's pretty basic bar food.  The most general description: it's a burger joint. The one (and possibly only thing) anyone should know about this place is the atrocious service. Seriously. Read the other reviews. Their service is awful. I honestly don't know how a restaurant can know full well that their response time to everything is sub-sub-par and defiantly refuse to change. I have to assume they are being defiant because some of these reviews are two years old. To put that in perspective, they still had slow service right around the time the iPhone 3GS was announced to the general public.  That's a long time in iYears. The Hop Haus earns some respect from me for attempting to bring a good craft beer list to the neighborhood, but just about everything else falls short.  If they fix the service issue, I would be inclined to give it a revisit.

The menu said it came with blue cheese.  It came to the table with no blue cheese and was the wrong size.  After 10 minutes of trying to track down our waitress, calling to her attention the lack of blue cheese, she apologized and took it back with the promise of blue cheese on the next order. 15 minutes later after my fiance is done his meal (his mac & cheese super dry might I add), the manager comes over with the right sized salad and also apologizes for the inconvenience and took it off our bill, which I appreciate.  That said, still no blue cheese.  The restaurant is not even close to being full. I swore I was not going back to this place but low and behold a night of drinking and no food in the stomach brought me back. Yes, nightclub music was pounding at the feet while I ate.

Something crazy, funny (in a bad way) or gross usually happens, but I always go with an open mind and chalk it up to a new experience. My experience at the Hop Haus, thankfully, was none of the adventure, all of the great food and service.  The Hop Haus is my best  restaurant.com  find to date. The servers gladly put up with all of our crazy requests like taking photos and shots and by the end of the meal we were all on a first name basis.  I am a serious food snob with a personal philosophy that life is too short to eat bad food. I wholeheartedly give the Hop Haus a two thumbs up for food. I had some of the more exotic sliders and they were absolutely fantastic. Great sauce, good bun, well seasoned meat, and sides. Great work chef!  It was a fantastic and fun outing for the girls before the show. Thanks again for everything.

BUT as for the atmosphere, they had a live jazz band in the side room but still played music in the main room.. coupled with the bass from Spybar, it was really distracting.  Three different tempos at the same time. I haven't had the specialty meat sliders they offer.  As a rule, if a place offers specialty items, if they can't get the basics right- like BBQ chicken pizza, then the other stuff isn't worth trying, so next time Mr. Ostrich, Mr. Wild Boar, you will be consumed.",0.9863,0.771,0.163,0.066,0.506734693877551

To give other resturants a fair chance when I compare this place to others, I stayed away from the ostrich and the bison and ordered the beef Huas Burger. Their name sake burger and also their most basic one. Beef, bacon, onions, lettuce, cheese, 1000 island, on a bun. Came to me at maybe a little too juicy medium rare, my fault for not getting medium, but it was delicious. The bun was a star and the other ingredients fit together just fine.

I've had a better burger in my life but the price really helped me feel I got my money's worth. But the real winner for me was the chicken wings I had before the burger. I got their traditional buffalo and then their garlic oregano. Crispy and almost delicate wings. The garlic oregano was my favorite and the only thing that would make it better was a better quailty blue cheese dressing for dipping and maybe a meatier size wing. But, still, very tasty wings.

2010-10-13,4.0,"Found this place on another food site using their slot machine widget to seek a new place for lunch.  I was drawn to Hop Haus because their usually outdated website listed a duck and ostrich mini burger. I'm a sucker for both and will try ostrich at just about any place that lists it. We've gone back many times since and the ostrich mini burger (or slider) is the clear favorite, with waffle fries. I ask them to cook it rare, as ostrich is probably the most red meat-like bird that a non-red meat eater can have. Hop Haus seasons this ground mini burger wonderfully, topping it with a slice of red onion and some sort of yummy cheese. This former Leona's location is now their take on a friendly sports bar and they've recently revamped their menu, simplifying it to concentrate on sliders.  There's a plethora of different wild game sliders including wild boar and some other interesting options such as lamb.. There's a lot of different chicken sliders, but they should reconsider adding so much sweet Teriyaki sauce on the better ones, which already comes with a thick and sweet pineapple ring. The turkey burger slider is like great sex in your mouth, as it's topped with slices of crispy turkey bacon, tomato and lettuce. The service is very friendly here and for those of you who also feel at home in Boystown, this place will have a few winks waiting for you in an otherwise drab and touristy part of the city. ;)",0.9893,0.843,0.148,0.008,0.5131628787878788

Tip #2:  DO NOT ORDER WINE.  I swear, it had to be sitting out for weeks.  It was so off.  It was awful.  I knew better, but someone on yelp had mentioned the wine so I assume and was optimistic...not so much. We finally ordered our food.  He got the Hat Trick (Smokehouse Burger, Black & Bleu Filet Mignon, Buffalo Burger) - this comes with fries or mac n cheese.  I basically wanted the same thing, but I wanted to trade the Buffalo Burger for the Boar Burger.  But since this was a ""supper"" deal, I could not do that.  I had to order my food ala carte, which did not include fries or mac n cheese.  I understand that they don't do substitutions, but really, how much do fries cost them...and the Buffalo Burger was in the same category as the Boar?  It's fine, no big deal - I don't need the extra calories.  Maybe I should thank them for that. Tip #3:  THE SUPPERS DO NOT TAKE SUBSTITUTIONS.   When we ordered, my husband ordered another beer.  He did not get it until after our food arrived...the particular beer he ordered when poured doesn't give much of a head in it.  The waitor was so impressed with himself however... And the food - it was alright.  Nothing special, it was so NOT worth the $5.95 for a slider.  The filet mignon was overcooked so it was chewy, and the fried onions were way too salty. The boar wasn't impressive and the bacon hung there limpy.  I did enjoy the smokehouse burger, but I have just had better.  I do like the fact that they used pretzel buns.

I'm going to have to head back to try the Kangaroo (which they were out when we went) and the Wild Boar.   I got waffle fries with my sandwich, but almost everybody else got mac n cheese for their side.  It's really good they said, but I still prefer some potatoes with my meat. The decor is typical sports bar.  It was a bit dark for my tastes, but they do have funny sports pictures on the walls.   I do wonder about accessibility.  You have to walk up about 5 steps to get into the restaurant off the street and I didn't see any other entrance.",0.9865,0.855,0.145,0.0,0.5204545454545454

Don't judge us. :-) Hop Haus was first on her list because she wanted a burger.  I have to tell you, we had the most, umm, ridiculous (?) waitress I have ever had. She was rushing us to order. Whenever we asked her a question, she gave a smart-assy remark like ""I KNOW."" No woman, we're asking YOU a question, you can't reply with ""I KNOW."" If she walked up to the table during a conversation, somehow she'd think someone was talking to her and again she'd have some semi-smart to say. I was highly annoyed.  Now, the food. I ordered a bacon guacamole burger MEDIUM-WELL. Imagine my surprise, when I bit into my burger and saw red. My burger wasn't cooked properly. So I send it back thinking they were gonna just sort of re-fix the original one, but instead I got a whole new platter back. That was very nice. The burger was good, the beer selection isn't all that I'd hoped for, but, eh, it's beer, I guess. A bigger party came in and we were asked to move, we were offered free shots or dessert to do so. Shots it was! And those were awful.  I've had burgers of similar or better taste from Whole Foods. Burgers aren't science, guys. But I did enjoy being able to watch the Cavs game while I ate.

Susie's, Hop Haus and Five Guys in that particular order. The fries I speak of particularly are of the Bleu Cheese persuasion which are completely delicious. They have other flavors but this one whispers to me in my dreams. My last visit, I ventured out and ordered a Hop Haus Burger, which by all accounts, surpassed my expectations. The bacon was a perfect crispiness and the Thousand Island dressing was subtle but extremely complementary. I ordered it medium well and that's exactly what I got - a juicy delicious burger. The service is suspect, as noted by the other reviewers but the food is a distinguishable cut above other bar and grill establishments (see Logan Bar and Grill).

It only got worse.  The waitress took just as long to get to us (there weren't many seated tables).  Then food came out, and some of it was cold.  Once everyone had food, the waitress disappeared.  I asked for a simple glass of water 5 times and never got it.  No drink refills, no checkups on the food, nothing.  I asked multiple times (both after chasing down the waitress, and the rude bartender) for one TV to be switched to a game (rather than the infomercial that was airing); it never happened.  Every employee seemed to find things to do OTHER than tending to customers. No surprise that 18% gratuity was added to our check.  If it were up to me, I would have left 2%. I was a waiter for years in earlier years.  I know what good service is, I know what bad service is.  I know what is the kitchen/house's fault, and I know what is pure incompetence and/or laziness by waiters.  Either this place does not staff enough people (though there seemed to be more than one waiter on hand), or it does not train them or ensure that they are competent.  One way or the other, it is absolutely unacceptable.

On two occasions I made the mistake of eating here, once I had the chili, same as dad made, too many beans, too many tomatoes, shitty ground beef, bad!   Pops wouldn't have dared charge me over five bucks for this slop.  I can't recall the other meal, what would it matter.   The room is decent looking, a lofty space with big windows, pretty much the same as when Tuttoposto opened in 1992, except no more open kitchen.  Now there are 6 TV's in a row, great for sensory overload, or to distract you from your food or drink, this place is the quintessential tourist trap.  A huge mural of Chicago sports icons, big TV's, lame pop music blaring, just insert credit card wielding tourists and who's to complain.  Just me",-0.9329,0.769,0.091,0.14,0.5399425287356321

2009-09-27,2.0,"Went there the previous evening for my buddy's bday dinner. We were looking for a place that has a unique menu, laid back, has a standout beer selection, and no fuss to get in and out for a Saturday evening. For those four pieces of criteria the Hop Haus hit on adequately, except I found it extremely hard to believe that they only had five beers on tap - not the 'Hop Haus' that I expected going into the transaction. The food was good and interesting as I don't know many places where you can get game burgers except for maybe Kumas. I got the Bistro burger with Havarti and Butterkase cheese with added sun dried tomatoes. It came on a pretzel roll and was quite tasty. The waffle fries and homemade cole slaw on the side wasn't something that I usually experience on the side of my burger escapades.  Where this place loses its stars are for the ambiance and service. I don't know what dingbat designed the interior but it reminds me of a suburban Applebee's inside with red checkered table cloths and murals of cartoon people having a huge party in the restaurant. There were also a couple of big college football games in the evening but sitting in the bar area, the placement of the flat screens seems to defy any logic. All of these seem like simple switches any manager would obviously notice and fix. As for our server, she started out great then went to a slow decline to one of my all time arch enemies. Since the place was devoid of any patrons on a Saturday evening, she wouldn't leave us alone and constantly bothered us for more drink orders even though she could clearly see we had full beers. Sooner or later, we started to ignore her whenever she stopped by the table. This didn't bode to well in her mind apparently considering before we finished our meals she slapped the bill on the table as if we were at a around the clock diner.",0.8578,0.865,0.079,0.055,0.3946825396825397
2009-09-27,3.0,"I really wanted to like the Hop Haus as a beer bistro and a restaurant, but the name led me astray. The beer menu was varied, but only about 6 of the typical American draughts were available, and then about 16 other beers were available in bottles ranging from $5-11 apiece. For dinner, I started with the Chipotle Cheese Ravioli appetizer, which was not quite as spicy as I thought it would be (it was hot temperature-wise, but not flavor-wise). The same thing happened when I ordered the Three Alarm Burger. The burger itself was tasty, thought the bun was a little strange (flavored like it was made from pretzel dough--not necessarily bad, but unexpected). The burger had the menu-designated jalapeños (served on the side instead of already on the burger), chipotle sauce (the same from the appetizer above), and supposedly a spicy pepperjack cheese. This was one of the blandest combinations of ""hot"" items I've ever had. It was not very flavorful, except for the burger itself. So, I guess the hint is, if you're looking for hot and spicy and flavorful, don't look for it at The Hop Haus. The burgers are juicy and dripping with deliciousness, but choose your toppings wisely. If I go again, I'll definitely try the game burgers...those sound a bit interesting. Service was really slow for a Saturday evening with almost no one in the restaurant (only about 16 other, and 4 of those were at the bar).

2009-09-02,3.0,"I came here for a burger and I wasn't disappointed. The burger was properly cooked to order, had a good char on the outside, appropriately seasoned, and the meat was proportional to the toppings on my Bistro burger. The pretzel roll did a good job of holding together while soaking up the excess juices. The bread/meat ratio was a tad high but that goes with the territory when you're serving a pretzel roll. If the meat patty had been smaller it would have gotten lost in the bread.  I skipped the fries and got the green bean salad as a side item. The salad, while it was a good portion and tasted OK, had like 5 green beans in it. A much greater proportion of the salad was broccoli and cucumbers. I'm fine with that but I would have preferred that the salad be called something else because (in my portion anyway) green beans were most definitely NOT the main ingredient. I would have called it a vegetable bleu cheese salad.  Judged on the merits of the burger alone the Hop Haus deserves 4 stars. Unfortunately when an establishment is called ""Hop Haus"" I tend to enter with an expectation of excellence in the field of beer. This is where I was very disappointed. They have 4 beers on draft. Four. One of these beers is Miller Lite and two are Goose Island. I like Goose Island but I can get that anywhere. Their bottled beer list does indeed include many uncommon selections but it's limited to 20-something beers. When you eliminate common beers such as Blue Moon and Duvel and then you consider that 5 of the beers are higher ABV selections at $9 (something I tend to avoid when I'm out on a Tuesday night) or above you end up with a relatively small list for a place that's seemingly selling itself as a beer bar. Jerry's on Division is a Beer Bar. Hop Haus isn't.  I hope they can beef up their selection of draft beers because I really do want to come back for the burgers. In the meantime when I'm in a beer+burger mood other places where I can get something better on draft will tend to be chosen over the Hop Haus.",0.9846,0.835,0.122,0.043,0.4398845598845598

Being preferential about things; you may call it ""being a snob"" 2. Never stepping foot inside a sports bar or any place that associates itself with sports Even though I have been living 1.5 blocks from Hop Haus for almost a year, I never bothered to check it out because A) it is a sports bar B) I wouldn't be caught dead in a sports bar C) I don't drink beer and this place seems focused heavily on beer. The in-laws were in the mood for burgers and beer last night. We were pretty tired from taking them all around town and decided to eat close to home.

After perusing the menu the husband and I hoped for the food to be awful so we would never come here again. You see, there are so many enticing varieties of burgers here. That means we would have to come again, eat all of them, and be fatty patties. No, we cannot do that. We are homos after all, we are not ALLOWED to be fat (stereotypical homo).

I was trying to be somewhat healthy and ordered grilled chicken tenders with a sweet and spicy orange ginger sauce. All burgers were excellent. My chicken was just average, a tad overcooked.... and the sauce was neither sweet nor spicy. I should have ordered the burgers, too. I ate from the rest of the three plates. Father-in-law ordered mac&cheese as a side and it was sinfully delicious. I am not a beer drinker, I shouldn't comment  about beer at all... but, I drank two bottles of Ebel's Weiss.

2009-06-02,3.0,"Hop Haus is a place with enormous potential.  Sadly the execution is mediocre at best, leaving a disappointing taste in my mouth at this supposed burger haven. Starting with the good: the beer selection is fantastic.  There are enough different choices that the average beer enthusiast will be presented with a number of esoteric options he knows he likes, and a bunch more that he's never had before.  They recommend beer-burger pairings, but I think I prefer to make my own decisions. Unfortunately, that's about all Hop Haus has going for it.  They really want you to think their burgers are up there with the likes of your favorite burger joint in the city.  They dress the burger up with a big fluffy bun, all kinds of toppings and garnishes (which are delicious and well executed - the pickle slaw is a great touch).  Sadly, when you get down to the heart of it, it's just a frozen burger patty (ground beef and turkey both) cooked to medium well regardless of your order. Finally, the service was abhorrent the last time I was there.  On a Friday night the restaurant was no more than 30% full but we still managed to spend plenty of time waiting inbetween beverages.  I'm not sure if I can blame the kitchen for the fact that our burgers were less than hot when they arrived.

2009-05-06,4.0,"Hop Haus is a study in contrasts no matter how you look at it. From the outside- I thought I was entering a sports bar- as the signs all lead you to that conclusion. But the valet service out front didn't quite fit with my sports bar expectation.  Upon walking in- we were greeted at the door and asked where we wanted to sit. Again- not a typical sports bar ambiance. It was fairly early on a Friday night (9pm) so we pretty much had our choice and since we weren't eating, we grabbed the last couple of seats at the bar. They have over 32 varieties of beer and a pretty good wine list. Again a surprise given this place markets itself as a place for sports.  Since the beer list had my interest, I asked to see a menu as the guys sitting next to me were eating burgers that looked and smelled delicious. What a surprise! There were over 20 different types of burgers on the menu- or if you are feeling adventurous- you can create your own (just like the pizza list on the back of the menu)  Looking for something a little more adventurous than beef in your burger? They have ostrich, wild boar, kangaroo, lamb and probably several more that I cannot remember. Certainly not your average sports bar!  The drinks were perfectly poured, the bartender affable and efficient and the clientele diverse and interesting.  As the evening wore on- the Hop Haus goes through yet another transition around midnight, turning into an ""oontz oontz"" club with a DJ spinning tunes and people demonstrating their moves (or lack there of ) on the dance floor. This bar seems to pick up the spill over from the nearby Spy Bar and Sound bar which are located next door and across the street respectively. We knew when a line began forming outside the door that it was time for us to leave as the crowd goes through a dramatic shift around 1am (this is a 4 am bar) Yet another contrast with the quiet couples sitting at the bar and the ""clubbers"" piling in and heading like lemmings to the dance floor. My advice- go early. Have a bite to eat and enjoy one of their many beers and the relative peace and quiet of the place.

2009-04-30,3.0,"Hop Haus has at least two trademarks that I can think of offhand.  The first trademark is their gamey-mini burger menu. In addition to their already extensive burger menu, you can get mini versions of kangaroo, boar, lamb (and a couple other) burgers. Their burgers, in general, are pretty good and I would go so far as to say that they may have the best burgers in River North, which is saying something (especially when you're going up against the Rockit Burger), but ultimately their varieties has to push it over the top in my opinion.  The second trademark is the maze you must travel through to find the bathroom. Just follow the signs and you'll get there eventually.  My favorite thing on the menu, by far, is the Bruchetta. I'm telling you right now: order this when you come here. They also have a lot of brews, which is never a bad thing.

If a place has flat screens all over the place, I expect more than one employee to know how to actually change the channels on a given tv. As for the food, not that special.

For entrees, I ordered the trio sampler of burgers, and got the ostrich, kangaroo, and wild boar. Although tasty, the numerous toppings masked most of the unique flavors of the meat that I was hoping for. Instead of burgers, my friends opted for chicken entrees that neither seemed to enjoy that much. As previous noted, this place only has four beers on tap, which to me is unacceptable for a place claiming to be all about beer.

The beer selection is vast, albeit somewhat overpriced, and the ambiance mimics that of a sports bar rather than a traditional dine in restaurant - this can be good or bad news depending on your preference.  Personally, I like a little sports action on the LCD's when I'm eating dinner.   Solid place to eat, and parking is free on weeknights after 530(?) and weekends until 11pm.",0.9529,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.5154166666666666

We arrived for some late night food and a few drinks around 11pm and after sitting down at a back table the 8 of us ordered some apps and drinks. I headed for the bathroom and upon returning was told i was cut off by our waitress with no explanation. Every one at the table was quite confused as everyone agreed I, or anyone at the table for that matter, was far from being even slightly close to over served.  Let me take you back: On my trip to the bathroom I had mentioned to another person in passing that ""this is quite the maze to find the john."" Little did i know the person i mentioned this incriminating dialogue to was the restaurant manager and he did not feel this type of statement warranted me to continue to drink in his establishment.  Remaining calm, i requested to this same manager that if you will not take my money for beverages, i do not wish to give this restaurant any money for food and to please cancel our food order. Without any rebuttal or without notifying me, the manager proceeded to call the Chicago Police to handle this customer service issue; An issue you would think any competent manager in the restaurant bizz could handle without the authorities.  Needless to say, the 7 Chicago Police officers who arrived on the scene were slightly confused to find a group of rational, coherent, well dressed 25 year olds politely trying to diffuse the irrational proceedings of the bar manager. We shared a few laughs with each of the officers, who each offered up somewhat whimsical remarks as it became rather apparent to them the most problematic individual in this scenario was not me or any member of our group, but the manager. I offered to pay for the food to expedite our departure and I shook a few of the officers hands before they headed out and apologized for our poor choice of where to drink and dine. The officers couldnt have been more supportive to our group and one mentioned the idea of posting a review to share our displeasures, which i am doing. Another officer mentioned, "" well where you choose not to spend your money is also a pretty powerful vehicle for criticism and i certainly wouldnt spend mine here.""

Second, you used to be able to customize either a beef burger OR a turkey burger.  Now, the only turkey burger option is a set menu option that comes with bacon and RANCH DRESSING?  The make-your-own-turkey-burger was one of the best things about the old menu--you could get a great, customizable burger, but be a little healthier.  Now?  Sorry--if you don't eat red meat or want to avoid red meat on a given night, you are out of luck unless you also don't mind bacon and ranch dressing.  You're out of luck at the Hop Haus.

If you can find a chef's creation on the menu, I'd suggest opting for that on your first visit. Save creating your own for subsequent visits. This is not the place to get a plain ol' cheeseburger. If you're wary about trying kangaroo, try the wild boar on your first outing. I think it's a little more accessible, at least in my mind. Don't pass on the big selection of international brews either. Most of the waitstaff is well versed in the different types so use their knowledge, or track down a favorite. It's fun to try different beers too, so don't feel like you need to limit yourself to multiple beers of the same brand.

Served on a pretzel roll that also somehow totally sucked: no flavor and weak texture. If you've ever been to Kuma's you will laugh out loud with disdain when you take a bite of this bun. I had the Three Alarm burger, and while I understand there are up to Five Alarms when it comes to fires, this one was more of a false alarm. No heat at all. Everything is weak here. I feel like more of a pansy for being there. I guess some people might like it though. If you're the type of guy who keeps the neckline on his hair-do trimmed real tight, parts it the same way as he did in elementary school, and is forced to admit that he is the lamest dude in the room basically anytime he looks around- take your underweight, fellow outcast, weak sauce college friends over there and have a great time with your shirts tucked in. Also, how can you have only 12 beers (all but 4 bottled) on your menu?

The beer selection was impressive and I teetered on ordering a few of the sweeter beers that I'd discussed with my server before realizing that I probably should have stopped drinking hours ago.  I was more eager to try the different meats on the menu and I enjoyed that each could be made a mini burger to allow variety and prevent being stuck with an entire burger I may not have liked. I ordered the lamb, boar, and cow (so I had a basis of comparison) and enjoyed each immensely. They each had a different flavor and toppings to complement the distinctive taste. I wasn't able to finish all three, but I took a few bites of each and it was like heaven to my starved, slightly impaired palate.   The service was great even though we were there long enough to see the sun rise at 5am. I'd imagine being above SpyBar lends Hop Haus to a lot of late night drinkers looking for a good meal. As much as I enjoy a good greasy spoon, it was nice to change things up a bit. The setup as a whole is a laid back sports bar with some sort of trivia game that could be played at each table.

But I did wait for an entire year...probably because of the less than stellar reviews I read right after their opening.  I gave them about a year to work out their kinks until last night when my husband said he wanted a break from the joys of packing (we're moving this week...ugh) and was in the mood for a good burger.  When you've got more crap than the rest of Chicago combined (me, me!) you can't take too much of a break from packing so we decided to place an order for carry out rather than dine in.   I placed an order for a guacamole bacon burger for my husband, which I have to admit even sounds good to this burger hater. And for me I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with the request that they grill it instead of fry it. Before digging into my chicken sandwich I of course went straight for the fries! These are thick steak fries and I typically like my fries thin and crispy, but I have to admit these were pretty delicious! I promised myself I'd only eat a few, but of course that didn't happen and I ate them all. And the sandwich was pretty decent as well- juicy chicken smothered in buffalo sauce and blue cheese. YUM!

I was seated in front of a large HD flat screen to wait for my friends.  Although I was 99.99999% the game was on ABC, I was assured it was on ESPN.  After 10 minutes of boxing, they finally listened to me....hrmm, who was right?! Me, of course... ; )  The TV was a little blurry, but since I'm not an HD junkie, I was just happy to be able to see my team play. Hop Haus only has 4 beers on tap, 2 goose islands and some German beer I'd never heard of before.  However, they have a large assortment of various beers in the bottle, including popular domestics.  I was happy as they had the Great Lakes White Moses, and coincidentally we were watching the Cavs beat up on the Celtics.  My friend didn't like her ""Frosty Strawberry"" drink and insisted the aftertaste resembled mouthwash, however, the rest of us tasted coconut.   We didn't partake in the apparently famous burgers, but we had the ""kickin chicken"" bufffalo style and the spinach artichoke dip.  Both were decent bar food, but we didn't have enough dip to go around for all the dip!  We also got a turtle sundae (they only have 3 desserts on the menu, all sundaes) which was pretty darn delicious, but hey, I have a sweet tooth!  Weirdly, it came with a frozen chocolate covered banana on a popsicle stick - this was weirdly out of place...

Again, frustrating but I brushed it off. (But really, why would you show the Bulls game on only 1 TV in the first place?) Okay on to the food. As we learned the hard way, the Hop Haus menu is full of lies. Lies! If you order a German burger that is supposed to come with brown mustard, and the restaurant doesn't actually have brown mustard, shouldn't that be crossed off on the menu description, or perhaps the waitstaff should point it out if you are ordering said burger? Italian burger, also missing ingredients. Our waitress was nice, though, and sympathetic to our situation. But still...kangaroo burger, overcooked. My Smokehouse burger was pretty good, but nothing spectacular. Also be aware that some of the prices in the drink menu are different than the prices listed on the full food/beer menu, which also makes no sense. The ""fries"" (really potato wedges) were tasty, I did enjoy those.  I didn't even get a beer because they were like $8 and the burger was $10, but they did have a pretty interesting list to choose from.  The bottom line is that you end up spending $20 for a burger and beer, and the burgers are so gigantic that you probably won't be able to finish the whole thing, and reheated burgers are kinda gross anyway so it's not like you'll be excited to take it home for leftovers.  Earlier in the day, I had spent $20 to pre-order Flight of the Conchords, Season 1 DVDs on Amazon dot com.

Then to top it off, there's a club (Spy Bar) located DIRECTLY below the table we were sitting at, so once it hit like 9:00, all you could hear and feel was the reverb from the bass downstairs.

2007-09-07,3.0,"After hearing about an event here that my girlfriend and I couldn't make, we decided to try it for some after-work drinks and a good burger. Picturing a whole-in-the-wall German bar, we were completely surprised to see that the place was like a Buffalo Wild Wings w/ a side of Applebee's in decor.  There were tacky electric signs everywhere and the tablecloths were checkered-the lights were stained glass-similar to something you'd see at my grandma's house. This was not the atmosphere we were expecting. They did have an extensive burger menu, although none of the combinations appealed to me. I decided to do the ""make your own"" type thing. The burger was actually the best part of the whole experience. My favorite part was that the bun was pretzel bread. I did not like the fries at all- they were very thick cut chip style-basically potato slices- with not much flavor. I didn't mind this but my friend got really pissed that they didn't have Heinz ketchup. The beer list was extensive as well and I did enjoy my beer. There were plenty of TV's so if you're going to watch a game, I guess this place would be OK.

Your beer list is impressive. You carry Jever and that makes me want to come back, especially at lunchtime. But Jever is not an ale. Sort of like how Samuel Smith's Oatmeal Stout is not a lager, except that one says so in the name. There are truly atrocious mistakes on your drink menu. They're so bad and so many that the bartender and I stopped laughing and just sort of looked at each other uncomfortably after a while. However, I would understand it perfectly if the person writing that menu had been blinded and stunned by the four gigantic televisions over your bar. They are truly disgusting.

The beer list was definitely overhyped.  I should've seen it coming when I read a review in some magazine saying that they had beers on tap ""from Harp to Stella Artois.""  Which, are pretty much the same thing: bland, overpriced lagers.  While the beer list didn't completely disappoint, it didn't help that the first 3 bottles I ordered weren't in stock.  Beer prices were all over the map.  The bottle of Sinebrychoff Porter I ended up with was the same price as a bottle of Sierra Nevada.  So the ""great"" beer list definitely wasn't going to distract me from the flaws here. And the burgers.  Now, the burgers weren't bad per se.  Just like the beer list, though, they completely missed the mark that they were going for here.  I was really intrigued when I read that they would have lots of exotic-meat-burgers, but every single one of them was a completely arbitrary selection of meat, cheese, and topping, on a bland bun.  None of the ingredients really meshed, and on several occasions they outright clashed.  It was like they just took a dartboard and randomly picked things.  Like that scene in Blankman, with the guy in the wheelchair.  (Did I just reference Blankman?  Wow.)

I had the french burger which was topped with brie, carmelized onions and dash of grey poupon/dijon mustard.  The brie was finely melt but the carmelized onion was sorely lacking.  The onions were slightly undercooked and the amount was barely enough to cover the burger.  The burger was cooked just right as ordered and it was big and juicy.  I must warn that it is quite gamey so expect it when you bite into it.

The skull in the top had on the label brought me back to my skankin' days in high school. Oi! Oi! Oi! Nice to see the ""punk"" beer amongst all the jock memorabilia on the walls. Kelpie Seaweed Ale.

The lamb burger was really juicy and good, but I was expecting more of a ""baaaah"" flavor, instead I got more of a beefy taste. Oh well. Meat's meat. I got the string bean salad instead of the fries which was actually pretty good...again feta and olives, tomatoes, string beans...went well w/ my burger.

2007-05-09,3.0,"I went last week with some of my buddies from college. We hadn't seen each other in a while, and the place wasn't crowded, so catching up wasn't a hard thing to do.  I was impressed by the beer list. There were a lot of selections that I was familiar with as well as a number of new options. Most of the beers that I had not tried before were from Scotland. I guess I'm more prone to drinking Scottish Whiskey than Scottish beer, but the ones that I tried were good. The bartender was knowledgeable about the beers, and offered appropriate descriptions or comparisons when asked. I also had the buffalo burger which was just alright; the barbecue sauce was disappointing. Compared to buffalo burgers that I had in Wyoming and Colorado, this was nothing to write home about. The buns were very generic too, and didn't add a single thing to the burger. I don't think it was even toasted because by the time I was done eating my burger the bun was all soggy and falling apart. Overall I like the place because it had a decent beer list if you're in the mood for some new beers, but it also has some good staples if you just want a good draft. The service will need improvement as well as the A/V setup (60% of the televisions share the same tuner, which means that they can only show 3 different programs which will SUCK during football season).  Overall, I'll go back, but it's not going to become a regular spot.",0.9581,0.834,0.125,0.041,0.43901198801198793
2007-05-02,1.0,"Really bummed about this spot. I was hoping for a great beer joint close to work but Hop Haus couldn't deliver. The burgers weren't stellar--and for $12 they should be better. The sides were all good--some pickle slaw, veggie slaw, and fries.  The beer was okay. It wasn't all that creative of a list. It was served a tad bit too warm.  The service BLOWS. Our server was missing for huge chunks of time--we coincidentally spent way less because we couldn't get the extra round or two that we wanted.  On the way out, we found out why she was missing. She was very busy entertaining and giggling at the cute bartender.",0.978,0.683,0.253,0.063,0.4566666666666666
2007-05-01,3.0,Hop Haus might be much better at 3 AM when I don't give a damn and need something real greasy.  There are so many other places that I would rather eat at during lunch or for dinner.  The Game burgers are good but not extraordinary and for 13 bucks it should give me a feel feeling of getting laid by a hot chick and not rear ended by a prison inmate!  I had heart burn from the burger for most of the day!  Not even McDonald's does that to me!   The service was slow and the place is so dark.  I did enjoy reading the sports book that was at the table...it helped to pass the time and was a good read!  Hop Haus...Tried it and it failed ... I will try again but only after a night of drinking and while I'm still wasted!   It gets the extra star for being open till 4am,-0.3702,0.816,0.103,0.08,0.4902777777777778
2007-04-27,2.0,"For what it is, the food is pretty good. I love game and love burgers, and Hop Haus mixes the two very well. Same goes for the fries and honey lemonade. However, the rest of the experience leaves much to be desired, err, sucks.  The service is clueless, from the old lady hostess in stretch pants and some weird ass colorful sweater, to the bus boys using our napkins to picking up lettuce (and not bringing spares), not to mention grasping for unfinished wine glasses as if they were the holy grail. The bar is poorly designed, with wine being stored between two huge windows, directly above the main order entry screen. Watching the bartenders mosh with each other to poor overheated wine was rather amusing.",0.8908,0.751,0.16,0.089,0.5070175438596491
2007-04-26,3.0,"The kangaroo burger was great, but I'll agree with other posters that the hype is way over the top on this place; and I too dont trust them to not cut their game meat with pork fat or something similar (lard or worse even...).  Beer selection was decent, but a lot of the food items mentioned on reviews all over the city were missing and really, besides some fancy cheese, there were only 4 or 5 unique burgers.",-0.3142,0.764,0.117,0.12,0.5401515151515152
2007-04-22,2.0,"Ok, I knew I knew better than to go to a restaurant within 2 weeks of opening, but I thought I would give it a try.  We got seated right away which for a Sat night was a bonus, especially after leaving our first choice restaurant after being told it was an 1:45 wait.  The service was really bad. Too long of a wait for drink order, not knowledgable about the differences in the meat and did not even mention that there were beers selected to go ""perfectly"" with each burger nor why they were selected. A few of the burgers were cooked wrong and inedible and after i persisted and actually got the beer that went with my burger it didn't enhance the experience. Probably won't be going back, but I do think that much of this can be attributed to new kitchen and waitstaff and they will probably work out some of the kinks. They just seemed pretty clueless over all.",-0.2475,0.85,0.075,0.075,0.5126839826839826
2007-04-21,2.0,"I had lunch one Sunday at the Hop Haus, looking forward to the 'exotic burgers' and beers.  It was my failure to not have known this was a re-branded Leona's restaurant; although I knew it the moment I walked in, as much of the old restaurant environment remains.  The beer selection is broad and varied; our waiter was tireless.  Unfortunately, that's all that I can say that's positive.  We ate a bruchetta appetizer that was mostly red onions and inedible -- although creatively served on triangle cut flat bread.  My friend's wine was completely flat, and his 'very well done, please, this is very important' burger was unfortunately served rare, which turned him off the meal entirely.    My burger -- medium rare -- was quite rare as well, but I solidered on.  Smoky chilpote something... but I tasted no heat, no smoke, and bearly cheese.  Unfortunately both burgers were served luke warm; certainly not hot.  Both were stacked high with 'chunk cut' tomatoes which made eating quite a mess.  Again, great beer selection, and I liked the beer-burger pairings they had on the (fairly short) menu.  To the restaurant's credit, our debacle meal was comped.   This might all be opening fine-tuning: I hold out hope for a great burger joint in River North.",0.9591,0.745,0.163,0.092,0.5999242424242425
2007-04-20,3.0,"This new restaurant in River North doesn't know what it wants to be.  One one hand, it specializes in gourmet burgers and boutique beers; on the other hand the design elements feel like a generic sports bar.   I went for lunch the first week that they opened, and I was unimpressed.  They tried to seat us, a party of 3, on some ottomans in the ""lounge area"" instead of at a regular table.  Even though the signs brag a burger in 12 minutes, it took us 45 minutes to be served.  Our waiter wasn't very attentive. The wild boar burger was pretty tasty, if somewhat overwhelmed by the toppings.  The french fries were giant wedges of potatoes and done very well, and there was a pickle salad that I thought was interesting in a good way.  Overall the food was good enough that I'll try again in a month or two; hopefully my experience next time will be better. One thing I couldn't figure out was the decor.  I know the space used to be a Leona's, but it seems like they should have updated the look more.  The plates and glasses are contemporary, but there are tacky (in the sense that they are sticky and ugly) plaid plastic tablecloths on all the tables.   Just that one change would have made the whole place feel more upscale.",0.9489,0.881,0.107,0.012,0.4294361888111888
2007-04-20,1.0,"First off I ordered a Lucifer to drink. The waitress brings me a Delirium Tremens. I'm all WTF so I call her back over. The ""head"" bartender tells her that that's what they are serving in it's place, and that it's the exact same thing. Um, no, no it's not.  Then their menu was a lot more limited than I expected, given all the hype. The food was mediocre, as it is at anything touched by the Leona's family.",-0.8786,0.861,0.0,0.139,0.4167989417989417
2007-04-13,3.0,"Anyone who reads Metromix or Time Out had probably heard of Hop Haus in the months leading up to its opening. And I have to admit they had me at ""24 burgers."" I have this thing for meat on a bun. So i had to check it out.  I left very ambivalent about the experience. Something was lacking overall that prevented the Haus from being great. I think it may have been unfulfilled potential. The idea is great, but they missed on the delivery. It's not that I didn't enjoy the Bistro burger (one of 20 on the menu - conspicuously absent was the PBJ burger I had read so much about) with bacon, pepper jack, onion, another unknown cheese, lettuce and tomato. It was solid. I think they could have done more. Every burger comes on the same type of bun and only differs in the cheese, sauce, and maybe a topping. So many unexplored places to add flavor. Maybe this will change. In any case, the burger was tasty. I will be back, if only to try one of the myriad options. The gamey options (duck, ostrich, boar) were enticing but I wanted to try the basic first. The manager sent over appetizers after our large party waited about 30-40 minutes for a table which won me over. The beer and wine list is extensive and reasonably priced. Could be a great place to watch the game with all the flat screen TVs, too. On the downside, the bathrooms were disgusting. Worse, the french fries were underwhelming. While seasoned nicely, they were a bit soggy and limp. The service was also a bit slow but I chalk that up to newness. High upside - I'm curious to come back and see how it evolves.",0.9498,0.837,0.112,0.051,0.46206582633053217
