It was not the location I'd expect to find this sort of food, but that's what makes this place so special. I split the Kafta Kabob and Schwarma with my friends. Both were huge portions and tasted great.  Special thanks to the manager at the time for putting up with our drunk asses. We came here after a beach outing, because my friend who was in town from Boston was craving Lebanese and this was the closest place we could find within cabbing distance. We had a party of eight and were chugging cheap sparkling wine all night (BYOB, baby!). Place was also packed.  However, the second time I came in, the place was dead and the food tasted a little more bland; hence only four stars, not five.  Always nice to see something different amongst the pretentionsness and overpriced, overrated upscale sports bars that dominate River North.",0.98,0.726,0.204,0.071,0.5886591478696742
2015-02-16,3.0,"I went to Kan Zaman with a group of 12 people. It was a big party and it a snow storm was headed for Chicago. It was supposed to be a party of 20 but many people left town to beat the snow storm. The person who called to confirm our reservation was very nice about accommodating our shrinking-by-the-hour party and our table was available upon arrival to the restaurant without any problems.  But service once we sat down at our table was another story. Our waiter was brusque and short with us, which I didn't mind at first because he was waiting on a large party and I know that can be stressful. Once our food had been delivered, however, he never came back to refill drinks or ask if we needed anything. After waiting around for the bill, we finally had to seek him out and ask him for it.  Here's the deal: I don't mind a surly waiter every now and then as long as he's an attentive waiter. Strangely enough, sometimes surly can be charming, which he had the potential to be. But the way it looked to me and my party was that he decided since his gratuity was already included, he was just going to dismiss us and work for his other tables. Maybe I'm wrong about that, but that's certainly the way it appeared.  The food was good and my party enjoyed each other's company. It was not a traumatic dining experience by any means, just a tad disappointing.  In the span of the few days after our meal here, many said what a great dinner was and then punctuated it with, ""If only the service had been better.""",0.9886,0.792,0.159,0.049,0.5436507936507936

The vegetable moussake was delicious, all the vegetables tasted fresh, not canned, but the portion was only one fourth of the plate and the three quarters of the plate was bulgar rice which was delicious but just a tad too salty.  This bulgar rice is not red  but white and very good however they could leave out the salt a little.  The lentil soup is one of the first soups I've had in the city where it is not spicy.  I do like thick lentil soup, and this is not very thick, I'd say in the middle, but very tasty. The hummus appetizer  was thick , but not really enough for 2 people to share.  They could of filled up the plate with more.  The grilled chicken was extremely tasty and portions were adequate to share.  All in all, I was very satisfied with the quality of ingredients.  I've been to middle eastern restaurants before where the vegetables taste like they came right out of a can. This is not the case here. The sauce on the vegetables was very good too.  I would have liked refills on water and tea, but noone asked and still a little larger portion on the veg moussake and less bulgar rice.  Still, everyone in our group said they will be back again to try new things.

However, there is a certain charm to a restaurant that provides not just authentic food but authentic service. The owner and servers tried to enforce a strict one-entree-per-person rule on our group, which irritated me because the restaurant representatives assumed ahead of time that I, as its customer, was attempting to give it the raw end of the deal by taking up space and not spending enough money per head. This is not a particularly friendly way of doing business. Even though our original plan was to order about 4 entrees and 6 appetizers for a group of 8, the way that the owner pressed the rule on me pissed me off enough that I considered canceling the reservation all together or ordering less food. Ultimately, we ordered 7 entrees and 2 appetizers for 8 people and had just a little food left over. The restaurant is very accommodating with its BYOB policy, and honestly, everyone just raved over the food. In true middle eastern fashion, our server first pushed us to order as quickly as possible and then abruptly ignored us, leaving guests in want of water, cutlery, serving utensils, and later, the check.

I waited almost 30 minutes into our meal before I got the Sprite I had requested when we were seated. The food itself was very good. (I highly recommend the chicken schawarma!) Everyone enjoyed their dishes. The belly dancer was also great. Too bad we kind of ended on a sour note. We got the bill, and were in the middle of splitting it all up when the server came over and snatched it from us. He said he needed to add a corkage fee. Corkage fees are pretty standard, but not everyone in our group had brought a drink in. They charged us $3 per person. It seemed like there were a couple other miscellaneous items on the bill as well. They also told us there could only be a maximum of 5 credit cards per table, and that since three of our party had paid and left earlier we could only use two more cards.

A friend and myself were on our way to Portillo's before enjoying an evening of music at Millenium Park when she stopped dead in her tracks and gasped saying, ""OMIGOD! Kan Zaman!  WE'RE GOING THERE!""  Apparently, there was a restaurant by the same name on Haight Street (my friend is originally from San Francisco) and it had been her favorite restaurant in the city before it closed.  She thought that maybe this Kan Zaman was associated with the other.  We quickly found out it wasn't but no big deal.  We both thoroughly enjoy Middle Eastern cuisine and we would take any chance to sit on throw pillows and rugs with no shoes at a restaurant.   We decided to basically make our own pita platter.  We each ordered falafel, and then got baba ganouj, hummus, meat kibbeh, and Jerusalem salad.  She also ordered Arabian coffee.  She let me try a sip and it was so hot and strong.  Really delicious.   The food was AMAZING.  I lived in Israel for nearly a year so I've had my fair share of authentic falafel and this was some of the best I've ever had.  Really crunchy on the outside and soft and hot on the inside.  Perfect.  and the Hummus was great as was the baba ganouj and Jerusalem salad.  My friend let our server know that their kibbeh was the best she's ever had and I have to agree.  So delicious. I feel the service was really excellent.  Granted, we were one of maybe 3 tables the entire time we were there (we came at that weird in between lunch and dinner hours around 4:00) but our water glasses were always full and my coca cola as well.  They let us know about their belly dancing nights and my friend and I agreed we must come back for that kind of entertainment. All in all, I had a very pleasant experience.  I really liked the décor and music and thought the service and vibe was great.  Everyone was very accommodating and polite.  I would absolutely go back and recommend it to anyone.  Thanks!",0.9989,0.72,0.257,0.023,0.5401322751322751

The good: the falafels, bulgar, the belly dancer The bad: the quail, the hygiene, the service, the magic ingredient  Similar to another review I read here, we too unearthed the magic ingredient that is part of their cooking. Hair. Black, long hair. More on that below.  The server we had was having a bad day at best, and clinically bipolar at worst. She made our table feel like we were not ordering enough food since the time we placed an order for a couple large appetizers to start with... on a 5 ppl table.  I've got 99 problems but not eating/ordering enough food isn't typically one of them. Whatever.  The place is a little dingy. With their napkins and the general surroundings not the cleanest.  I do usually like quail and I ordered it. The server asked how we want it cooked and I said well done. In retrospect, I should've said well prepared. Stick to the standard fare - shawarma, kabobs, etcetera.  The shrimp sauté seemed promising. Except for the strand of long black hair that accompanied it. We decided not to eat it, or much else, when the server felt it was essential to be in denial that this could have happened by any fault of the restaurants. We didn't care to even contest it till the time she claimed we may have been the ones responsible for that hair somehow. My boy Stevo who was eating the shrimp has not a single strand of hair longer than a quarter of an inch. Except for some chest hair at the table that might've uncurled to a foot long. Possible? Maybe. Sorry about that visual.  I'm ending my most detailed review yet. But, this place deserves a miss.

We said we will try and see how we like it and then order more if we wanted. Have you seen the size of that thing?  It was huge, we couldn't even finish it! When it was time to order our meals the server told us that because they're not charging corkage fee there was a minimum of one entree per person. All the time she was rude and giving us crazy attitude. We weren't drinking alcohol and didn't understand why we had to order an entree per person. When we asked her why there was a minimum she gave us nonsense like ""this is a restaurant"" like I might confuse it for a barn. Apparently it was their policy. We scoured the menu for the FinePrint saying so. There was none! After a few minutes of mind-boggled arguing, and wanting to scream ""it's a free country"", our orders were taken and served.  Wish it ended here.. But no! There was a piece of hair in the food!!! We told our server - she ostensibly took it inside, and then is like ""no one inside has long black hair- it must one of yours!""

2014-01-21,2.0,"I've been to Kan Zaman several times over the last two years and observed it devolve from a top BYOB restaurant for group dinners in the River North area to a place I will reluctantly go if someone else sets up the reservation.  I'm frankly not surprised that the restaurant was half empty on a recent Friday night.  The food is pretty good, but the service leaves a rotten aftertaste. The restaurant has a lot to offer: BYOB, family-style platters for sharing among groups, belly dancers as entertainment.  However, to compensate for being a BYOB, I get the impression that Kan Zaman is increasingly trying to ""hit you up"" for money in shady ways.  For example, the corkage fee increases every time I go and currently stands at $5, which they apply to any alcoholic beverage you open: liquor, wine or beer.  Second, the waiter my friends and I had last week (a 50 year old Middle Eastern man) tried to sell us, in the style that would make a used car salesman blush, a ""good deal"" for family-style platters at a whopping $30 per person!  I couldn't find this price on the menu anywhere - but he said he would make sure we were treated well.  When we questioned the price and the value of what we would get, he got defensive and started antagonizing my friends for not spending enough on food to ""help the restaurant"" since it was a BYOB place.  ""We don't have the liquor,"" he reminded us over and over.  Sorry buddy, but as a patron of the restaurant this isn't my problem.  Finally, while the belly dancer performance is nice, I don't like how she came around our table multiple times clearly soliciting tips.  Several men at the table next to us put $1 bills in her elastic armband.  I felt like I was at a strip club. I can't say I won't eat at Kan Zaman again.  I might turn to them for a takeout order.  But they have clearly fallen off of my short list for restaurants suitable for fun BYOB group dinners.  There are far too many other options in Chicago.

The second great thing is that they are BYOB! A perfect complement to their fairly priced fare.  We ordered dishes we both traditionally like. I had their Falafel Entree and my date had the Shawarma Entrée. Neither of our dishes came with pita or hummus. I asked if I could exchange the rice for pitas as I do not enjoy rice and unfortunately they were strict on not allowing any substitutions. We decided to order sides of both, as no Mediterranean meal is complete without either of those traditional *complimentary* components. Yes, we found it unusual these did not come with our $11 and $15 dollar entrees. They were accompanied by Lebanese Salad or Lentil Soup.  I chose the Lentil Soup to start which was EXTREMELY bland! My dates Lebanese Salad was the same, which he was very unhappy about because he loves the tradition lemon forward dressing. My falafel, rice and the hummus were right along the same tones of under seasoned. My date loved his shawarma however, expressing it had great flavor and tenderness.

2013-03-24,1.0,"Worst Experience Ever! Let me start off by saying that I have worked in the food industry before and understand the list of complications that may arise on a busy Saturday night. However, our experience was not only terrible but, the staff did nothing to remedy the situation other than bold face lie or blame shift. Recap: It was a friends B-day dinner in which she made reservations for 8pm two weeks prior. (8 guests total). Two of us arrived at 7:30 in which we were seated immediately and asked how we were doing. The server then asked if she could get us anything to drink and a friend ordered an iced tea which was brought out to him rather promptly. We eventually had to flag someone down to get sugar as it was not offered at the time we ordered. A few minutes later before the rest of the party arrived, we also ordered a coke and fruit smoothie which never came out until we had to remind the server half way into the meal.  The server steered the group to the family style menu which includes appetizers, salad and 3 proteins. Mind you, this choice includes a 18% gratuity on your bill which I normally would be fine with paying as I understand how they are paid but, I think she used it as a crutch to provide awful service because she knew she would ultimately be making 18% no matter what. The entire meal took over 3 hours because ""the kitchen was slammed"" even though we saw tables enter an hour after us, eat and leave before we even received our main entree. The server was completely inattentive, plates were left uncleared from our table, drinks were no refilled, food took forever to be deliver. Our appetizers came out relatively quickly but we then waited over 45 minutes after we were finished to have a salad delivered. Every time I needed a refill I had to flag someone down in which my request was often forgotten. Finally 2 hours after our original seating our main entree arrives and once we finish no one returns to the table to ask if we are finished, if everything was OK, if we ready for the check, literally no staff interaction whatsoever. We looked around and watched the place clear out at 11pm with us still waiting for someone to come by and get us out. After once again, flagging someone down we receive our check with errors on it. They charged us a corking fee for 9 people, even though there was only 8 at the table with only 5 of us actually drinking. Once I was able to get that corrected I mentioned that our experience was actually pretty horrible and asked to speak to a manager. The manager, server and I got into a heated argument in which they made excuse after excuse while the server bold face lied about the type of service we received. When I asked her why we were still waiting for her to box our food, bring us the bill after the ""kitchen was slammed"" excuse she had nothing to say.  First off, there is no way to justify a 3 hour meal when others around you are coming in after and leaving before. There is no way to justify plates not being cleared, 45 minutes in between and app and salad course, no refills, not being delivered a check etc. Instead of owning any of the issues, she denied or blame shifted while the manager backed her up. I made the point to mention that it seemed as though the 18% mandatory gratuity gave her the freedom to not make our table a priority because she would be making money regardless. After voicing all of my valid concerned for 10 minutes, they took the check back to deliver it back to the table 15 minutes later with nothing else removed, no comp and the promise that if we returned again it would not be like this. By this point we all wanted to leave because it was 11:30. This place has no care or concern for their customers and they truly don't understand the importance of correcting a poor experience. I will never give this place another chance as they have lost me as a customer. Good food or not, service is terrible and management even worse. I've never argued with a customer in my life nor have I then lied about mistakes that have been made during an experience. I could have respected honesty but, to flat out lie shows what kind of people work here and their morals. To take a check back and make us wait another 15 minutes while you ""figure something out"" to deliver it back with nothing removed due to awful service proves that lack of care they have for their customers.

2013-03-21,1.0,"Date of Patronage: March 20, 2013 Table/Occasion: 5 Women Celebrating a Friend's Birthday Chief Complaint: Terrible, disrespectful service that killed our mood and made us feel like a burden to the restaurant. I have been dining at Kan Zaman for several years - and have visited the restaurant at least 10 times and carried out several times more.  It's usually a great place for large groups (have had great experiences with groups as large as 18): takes reservations and is BYO which makes it relatively inexpensive compared to other River North establishments.  The food is amazing, the quality of meat and vegetables is top notch, and they have the best falafels in the area.  It's pricier than other restaurants serving the same food, but until now the convenience and ambiance outweighed that cost differential for me. This review is about the awful service my party received during our last visit.  When we sat down at 8:30pm, we were told that the kitchen closes at 9:30pm and the restaurant closes at 10pm...we felt rushed and felt as if we were burdening them by our presence. We were treated decently through the ordering of appetizers, our server even suggested the platter and we ordered that gladly.  Then came time for ordering main entrees--we were a table for 5 women and we wanted to share a couple main dishes along with our appetizers...that was all we could eat given how large the portions are.  That was when our experience turned for the worse: --Server tells us not to reserve on OpenTable because the restaurant is charged for those reservations --Then he tells us that since they're BYO they rely on food orders to make their money --When we asked him what he's trying to say, he says ""You didn't order enough food."" --He proceeds to tell us that there is a sharing charge but he won't charge it to us because it's a weekday (there were 5-6 tables occupied), but if we come on the weekend it will be a different story--we proceed to say then charge us the sharing fee, we'd gladly pay it, to which he replies, ""don't make a big deal about it""... I am a child of non-native English speakers and am very sensitive to miscommunication that can occur in these types of circumstances.  This was beyond that.  It was disrespectful, unnecessary and just poor customer service bordering on mean.  I have dined at this restaurant so many times and am appalled that this is how we were received and treated.   Kan Zaman, -If you don't want OpenTable to charge you for reservations, stop your partnership with them.  Diners get rewards on our end...we're not going to stop using OpenTable because you tell us to.  We will just stop coming to Kan Zaman -If you have a sharing plate policy, the proper etiquette of communicating that is:  ""Please note that we have an $8 sharing fee per plate indicated on the menu, is that ok with you guys?"" -Don't make your customers feel like a burden, ever.  You never know who plans large, profitable group dinners at your restaurant and who will veto those in the future if your name comes up (I know we all will). I feel very let down by the restaurant's service and hope they react/change, but the food is still fantastic...",0.9554,0.823,0.103,0.074,0.47287918871252205

However that didn't stop the waitress from seating us and then leaving us for a good ten minutes before she came back to take our order. She was nice enough but terribly slow for no reason. [[I should also note that the kitchen staff decided to take their lunch when we walked in. Our waitress spent most of her time catering to them instead of us, which I thought was pretty stupid as were the paying customers.]] I can honestly say I regret choosing this restaurant to eat in. I ordered the chicken shawarma with rice and my bf some sort of beef kebab. The chicken was so bland that the only flavor that it had came from the white sauce they served with it. My bf's kebabs were completely raw, something he did not order. He actually had to stop eating his food and switch to mine, it was that bad. Still, the two of us together couldn't finish my dish. We left this restaurant hungry, unfulfilled, and very annoyed. Pros: Nice decor Nice waitress Cons: Slow service Bland food Raw food Honestly, I would go elsewhere for lunch. Maybe we just had a bad day here but I can say with confidence that we will never be returning here nor will we be recommending this place to any of our friends in the area. I would rather go to Mezza in the Merchandise Mart (not too far from here) if I feel like eating Middle Eastern food.",0.2909,0.767,0.122,0.112,0.6028846153846151
2013-03-05,3.0,"Came here to celebrate  a special occasion. My favorite thing about this place is their unconventional seating -- where you're seated on an elevated floor around a small table. Because there were so many of us, this was not a particularly comfortable arrangement as the tables are very small. What kind of ruined the experience for me is their ridiculous rules about splitting a plate. It costs extra $8 (or even more now ) to split a plate. I mean it's kind of insane to pay $8 to split a $13 dish. Why should I stuff myself or carry a take-out box around with me, or worse yet throw food out? So other than that I would give it a higher rating. Also, we were there on a Saturday and they had belly dancers who were pretty cool and not feely touchy as they usually are. Change your rules about food and I'll be back! Oh, I also didn't like the limit on using credit cards in our group.

The falafel and tabbouleh were the stars of round 1 by far; the grape leaves left a little to be desired, as is common when served cold (in my opinion).

We ordered a family style meal with a mix of Lebanese appetizers and meats. The food was good if not great, but served its purpose for framing our evening of semi-debauchery in honor of our bachelor. The football-shaped kibbeh appetizers were the tastiest part of the meal, probably followed in taste by the kefta meat in the mixed grill.  After stuffing out collective faces, we were enchanted by our belly dancer Angelica. The manager had mentioned that the performance would last about 35 minutes, but on my unofficial watch she performed, twirled, shimmied, and sweated for an eye-popping 50 minutes. I'd say everyone in the house was impressed by the talent and beauty of this woman.

On the menu i recommend the kafta, all types of kabobs, the labna and fatayer and baklava w coffee for dessert..

We were there for twenty minutes and weren't even offered menus.  I had to go up to the counter to both ask for them and ask for a server.  NOBODY had been our way.  That seemed to wake them up a bit as service (sort of) steadily improved, but I'd never give it more than a 5 out of ten.   As a few people here have sort of alluded to, they really seem to turn their nose up to and roll their eyes towards large groups on a busy night.  Our server even hurried us to order insisting that the food would take over an hour if we didn't order right then.  Look, Any Restaurant in the World, if you don't want big groups then don't take the reservation.   (Speaking of reservations, after reading some of these reviews I'm glad we even had a table when we got there.  Yeesh.) The food itself was only OK. It was definitely fresh but, again, it was nothing mind blowing.   No, I take that back.  My meal was mind blowing.  $13.95 for a ""Chicken Shawarma Dinner.""  Now I've had shawarma at many different places and I've always been under the impression that what makes shawarma ""shawarma"" is the fact that it's shaved meat.  I did some googling to confirm my thoughts and I found nothing to say otherwise.  So why did I get a plate of PULLED chicken and rice?  It was like a Lean Cuisine but with an actual amount of food. OK, I will say that the chicken was tasty but it just wasn't shawarma.  And it CERTAINLY wasn't worth fourteen dollars.   In the end, I was OK with spending what I spent there because it was a big birthday event.  You mentally prepare yourself for these things, you know?  And plus one star for the environment (the belly dancer really woke up the room).  But if I ever took a date there and experienced that sort of rude and ignorant service and then paid fourteen bucks for the simplest meal on the planet, I'd certainly never return.

To get the positives out of the way, the food was good, not to pricey and the belly dancer was a lot of fun....... On to the heart of the matter, when I made my reservation I specifically requested the authentic booths along the the wall with the lovely cushions. When I called to confirm my reservation a week later, I again made sure there would be a booth for me. When my party arrived at the restaurant, I was told we would be sitting in the back in a corner at a table, and that all the booths had been reserved by other parties. NEVER MIND that I had requested said booth 2 weeks earlier and had been told twice that it would be available. No one bothered to apologize or seemed sorry that my booth was gone. Their suggestion was to split my party up between two smaller booths and thus have a mini divider between us. Waiting to enjoy my birthday dinner, I sat at the table.  Once at the table the service was subpar. After taking our order and bringing the food we never saw our waiter again until it was time for cake. Thankfully the poor bus boy refilled our water or we would have been completly neglected. When it came time to cut the cake, we bummed a lighter from an individual at the table next to us, and when we asked for take out boxes to take the cake home the waiter wanted to know ""where was the box the cake came in"". They did not offer to take it away and cut it for us, nor did they offer to box the cake.  After all this, the food wasnt really worth it.

This place has ethnic flavor and atmosphere and yet it is completely accessible to its American customer base in downtown Chicago.

We made a reservation because of the size of our group, but it seems that if you do dinner before 8ish, you won't have a problem getting a table (but you will miss the belly dancing which starts at 9). I was the first to arrive and brought a bottle of wine with me. They were quick with bringing wine glasses and offering to open the bottle which was great, but I was a little surprised at the $3 per person corkage fee.  We started with the vegetarian combo platter, which was delicious. We were not very familiar with middle eastern/mediterranean food, so this was a great way to try a few things at once. Our group ordered beef kebabs, lamb kebabs, falafel, and the hummus chicken. We had a group member with celiac, and they were very helpful with telling us what was in each of the dishes we asked about and offered to make something special if she needed. It's nice that the entrees all come with a choice of soup or salad, so you don't necessarily need to order an appetizer. The food was so yummy! My one complaint is that I ordered the lamb medium and it came out medium-well. It still had great flavor, though, so not a huge problem.  The belly-dancer came out as we were finishing dinner. We were worried that they would rush us out, as the restaurant was starting to get busy and we were done eating, but they offered to open our last bottle of wine for us while we watched and chatted. The belly dancer probably isn't the best dancer out there, but she was certainly entertaining. She got people to join her dancing and got everyone clapping along.

The vegetarian appetizer platter made a perfect light dinner for two - featuring all the usual suspects that were perfectly palatable. Was it a step up from the somewhat ubiquitous take-out shops or the more recent crop of Middle Eastern fast food? - -- not so much. My biggest issue with Kan Zaman is the general decor. Maybe the intent was to go for rustic, I think the interpretation results in a rather jaded, have-seen-better-days look. The authenticity of the floor seating experience was marred by having to brush off quite a few left over bread crumbs and the  likes from the couches - not quite the self service one expects or wants to be put through in a sit down restaraunt in a prime River North location.

First of all, we were not offered menus. We were told we could have menus if we weren't going to go with the family style option. They STRONGLY recommended we do family style. Personally, I love family style and wanted to go that route, I just didn't appreciate their heavy handed behavior. They never volunteered a price for the family style meal (and they wouldn't give us a menu, remember) so eventually we just had to ask.  Throughout the course of the night they continued to do really bizarre, annoying things. At one point, we were asked to hurry up and finish eating because they needed our table. They had yet to bring out our main course! We politely declined because we were in the middle of our meal and felt that it was inappropriate to even ask of us at that point.  Then our meal finally came out, and it was only one small platter of food for a group of 10 people. We saw them bring out to plates of food to tables of 5 - 6 people, so we knew they were trying to cheat us. Another member of my party spoke to them and asked for the additional platter we were owed. We recieved several different excuses (including, you only get one, we forgot and the orders were mixed up?!?!) We requested they bring us the extra platter and after 20 min of waiting they finally did. We were pretty much ready to leave at that point though.  Bellydancer: Ok, so I am probably biased on this point because I belly dance myself and have seen some AMAZING shows here in Chicago but I wouldn't even call what she did belly dancing. It was more gyrating, similar to a nightclub dancer. Ok, fine, but not very inspiring. And really annoying when she kept trying to get you to tuck dollar bills in her clothes like a stripper. Most real belly dancers I know pass a basket at the end because they are artists and not strippers.  Food: It was medicore. Maybe the family style meal gets less effort or something, but all of the food was dry. Very well seasoned but dry. The appetizers were very bland. Overall, nothing to complain about but nothing to write home about either.  So all in all I felt like I spent $40 to eat mediocre food served by people who didn't want me there.

I walked into a nearly empty restaurant (only 1 table occupied), and approached the host stand.  The gentleman at the stand (presumably the same person who took my order) was talking on the phone, and I patiently waited for him to finish.  After he finished on the phone, he stood there completely ignoring me (remember...empty restaurant) and continued to do who knows what.  A couple minutes pass and he still hasn't acknowledged that I'm standing there, then he goes back to the kitchen and brings out my order without saying a word. A women walks up to the register tells me the total is $18.80, so I hand her $19 and also ask for a side of hot sauce (I like my falafel spicy!).  She glares at me with a look of disapproval, and asks the man to go get the hot sauce.  He comes back and puts the hot sauce in the bag, and the women tells me they've given me everything I need and I can go.   I ask her for the change, she barks back that its only $0.20 cents and proceeds to point out that she didn't charge me for the 0.5 oz of hot sauce I got on the side.  Clearly its not about the $0.20, but that was completely lost on her.   Needless to say, I won't be inconveniencing them with my business in the future.  Especially when I can just go to ""Old Jerusalem"" about a mile up Wells St.  It is a shame to, because the food I ordered was actually quite good and I could have seen myself ordering from here often.

I probably could have done without it. I probably would have preferred one of the meat appetizers. It wasn't bad- just not my taste. I'm not even a big hummus person. Yes I am strange.

I had this kaftka kabob-  blend of ground beef and lamb, parsley, onions, and seasonings, served with charred onions, green peppers and tomatoes. It was such an interesting, unique flavor! I really really enjoyed it. My friend got the lamb shis kabob which was FANTISTIC! Better than some steaks I've had. Cooked medium rare- it was succulant and juicy and amazing!

2010-04-19,3.0,"I don't think we knew it was BYOB. In fact I'm certain and this is why: they serve Lebanese wine. It is, according to the extremely friendly waiter who rather unnecessarily wrote his name on the tablecloth and spelt it very s-l-o-w-l-y out loud (we hadn't even had the wine yet), 'the best'. Funny that, since it's the only wine you have.... Normally, this would prompt me to dart across the street and buy something - anything - else. But alas, I was out with work and that wasn't an option. Nor was darting anywhere, at that stage.  So - the wine is truly atrocious. So BYOB. Just a tip.  Aside from this, the food was ok. Very good falafal, and very good dolma, tasty sauage, and reasonable baba ganoush, with generous starter portions. I'd stick with these though, and have yourself a little meze, rather than move onto entrees. I had a beef shish kebab, and although the meat was incredibly tender, the rice was overcooked and bland, and the salad was a bit of a waste of time. All in all, the flavour promised by the starters was sadly lacking thereafter.... this didn't matter too much as I'd eaten rather too much hummus so I was full, but I'd be gutted if I'd paid full price. God bless expense accounts.  The server was over-enthusiastic - which riles me because I'm a miserable Brit, and really, I can spell. Sorry. Not my thing. He said everything was 'the best', which is not helpful when you're trying to pick a dish.  Also, when I went to the ladies', a bloke - presumably a chef - walked out. Bad form. Left the seat up. Worse form.  Having said that, we were a party of 8, late on a Thursday, and half of us were on the tipsier side, so the staff did well to look after us.

I was hesitant at first since I had never heard of this strange Lebanese establishment but I'm a sucker for middle eastern food so I jumped in with both feet. I indulged in hummus, babaganoush, fresh warm pita bread, and our BYOB wine to start. Dinner was served family style with large heaping plates of chicken, lamb, beef, rice, and grilled vegetables. We were worried we wouldn't have enough food with only 2 platter for 10 people but we were left with extras. For dessert we all shared some sort of flaming cheese dish and baklava (and more wine after we had to make a trip to store to buy 3 bottles of Cabernet!).

This is like eating at your Lebanese aunt's house. Or, in my case, my Moroccan, Algerian, and Libyan peeps' homes. Sitting around a big circular plate and sharing a meal with family members (I was the only non-family member at such dinners). Ah, the joy of growing up in North Africa.

I, on the other hand, have incredibly flexible legs due to my whorish past (and present). My legs automatically assumed the lotus pose upon sitting. Started with the vegetarian combo for an appetizer:  a sampling of hummus, tabouleh, baba ghannouj, falafel, dolma, feta cheese and olives. The portion size was big enough to be a dinner entree.  Everything was well prepared - silky hummus, salty feta, tangy tabbouleh, and crunchy falafel. We were full from just eating the appetizer. A 5 star item. I got the lamb special, the husband ordered chicken shawarma. My lamb was absolutely perfect - shank of lamb slow cooked to perfection. I didn't have to use my knife to get the meat off the bone. It fell off as soon as I put my fork on it, and melted in my mouth. Definitely a 5 star dish. The husband's shawarma was good. Did not get dessert because all they have is baklava. Not a fan of sweets. I hear they have hookah, but I am a non-smoker, so I wouldn't know anything about it.  Do it, get the floor style seating, be transported into the middle east.

And it can get a little rowdy, depending on how many/big groups there are (especially during the belly dancing).  but then the same rowdiness/energy coming from all these groups can be a little distracting/intimidating as well, as every group continually checks each other out and it becomes a big BYOB/cheers/bday singing competition. the belly dancing portion of the night probably lasts a bit too long; a straight hour of one dancer and blasting music. the first 30 min is probably long enough to enjoy the novelty, the last 30 min is probably unnecessary and a little awkward... especially after seeing the dancer get out as quick as possible after she's done, like a belly dancer version walk of shame also, i guess there's a ""per-bottle"" BYOB corkage fee. this means bring a couple huge bottles of alcohol/wine instead of a lot of regular ones. anyhow, a solid choice for Mediterranean food and large groups. just get ready to get rowdy",0.9451,0.85,0.112,0.038,0.4956210456210456

The food was good - solid, nothing flashy.  I had the lentil dinner, and have had the spinach also, and enjoyed it...again, nothing all that exciting, but food is food...I guess.  The other people I was with got a range - most got the chicken cabob - and all had food remaining when the meal was over.  The appetizer platter was some of the best - but that tends to be my favorite part of the meal anyway. :) Great hummus, feta, etc.  Very fresh. So I have two other comments about this place - one that gives it a plus, and another that was somewhat uncomfortable. Plus side: It's BYO.  Great, great byo place...reasonably priced food, good for groups, etc. Negative: So they have belly dancers...yah.  The music that was played was so loud that my fellow diners (not a demanding crew) asked if it could be turned down somewhat b/c we couldn't hear each other talk across the table...our request was denied.  Pair that frustration with the odd fact that some tables occupied by creepy guys who were clearly there only for the show, and oggled you each time you had to walk by to go to the bathroom.  I appreciate the attempt to bring some culture to the experience, but this perhaps is a great example of the difference between an idea that's good in theory but fails in practice...

The plating is pretty bad, just some chunks of meat on a bed of white rice. No color, no other flavors, nothing.

You can't go wrong with any of the sandwiches or wraps, although I find the pickled turnip they supply as a side to be really gross, but it's possible someone might like it.",0.6211,0.817,0.121,0.063,0.6005952380952381

2007-04-30,3.0,"Overall, the food was great, but there are many additional costs it seems the waiters do not want you to know about.  Our waiter came to our table and suggested we get a sample of appetizers to start, since were were a group, all which tasted amazing (the hummus is the best I have ever had), but they kept coming out and we were full once we finally finished the appetizers.  We had to ask for menus (they were never given to us), which is where we learned that there is a $7/person split charge and a corkage fee.  Because we were full from all the appetizers, we only wanted to split two entrees, which we were charged $7 per person to split the two entrees.   We manged to talk to the waiter and get some of the split charges off because we only ordered two entrees, but we had to argue for a bit to get some of the charges off.   So overall, beware of the split charges and corkage fees, and demand to see a menu before you order instead of letting them just bring you appetizers and entrees.",0.2998,0.853,0.066,0.08,0.5954545454545455

2007-04-02,4.0,"While there were several *bad* things that happened to us while my party and I were here, overall the experience was great. I went with a large group for a friend's birthday, and I am thinking Kan Zaman is the type of place for large groups, and large groups only. The loudness escalates as the night progresses, and the belly dancer would be odd if you wanted to have a romantic evening out. However, for the group setting, the belly dancing was awesome! The belly dancer is personable and will help you learn some moves, if you are so inclined, or will shimmy next to you if you are into that kind of thing. The waiter simply asked if we would like appetizers, then walked away only to return with lots of plates of food such as hummus, falafel, feta and olives, and a weird sausage (in oil- not good). Most of the appetizers were good, but we had no option to order what we wanted so it seemed. Upon getting full from the plethora of appetizers, we decided to order three entrees and split. One was chicken sharma, then another chicken dish, and something with beef. All were served with rice. They were delicious, seasoned perfectly. Since it was a friends bday, we let the waitstaff know and they brought us 4 baklava and a piece of chocolate cake. While the baklava was amazing (I didn't have the cake), we were charged for it! We simply said it was her birthday, but didn't know we were going to be charged $12 for a birthday extraveganza. We also didn't know about the $3 per bottle charge for corkage. That was a surprise. Since our bill amounted to $32 a person (we split evenly), no one truly cared. Plus, given the fact we had a great time and didn't mind spending cash on a good friend, we were not about to argue over the bill (also, slurring words and arguing is not attractive).  Kan Zaman is a great location for a group dinner because it provides entertainment and stays on the cheap, while you feel like you are having a very nice, authentic lebanese meal. Just be leary of the odd price additions they suspect no one will care about due to factors such as overall price and group drunkeness. I believe that BYOB is dangerous. I personally feel the need to finish the bottle of wine (can't take it with you...), which leads to me drinking quite a few glasses.",0.9956,0.765,0.173,0.062,0.591468253968254

I first discovered it for a girls night out two year ago.  We read reviews on Metromix and thought we give it a shot and was in for a pleasant experience.  Since then, I've returned many times bringing new people with me.   The service was amazing...these people are genuinely nice.  One night, we wanted to sit at the Hookah tables, but was full.  So the host said he would call us once a table is open while we grabbed a drink nearby.  The wait staff was honest with their recommendations. Excellent food.  My favorite: shish taouk, marinated chicken breast with onion, tomato and green peppers, served along rice and a healthy lime juice salad.   Decor is mediocre...not that it was intended to be fancy anyway...it's just perfect with the family-style size and floor-level Hookah booths.  It leaves you with a cozy feeling. Price is definitely reasonable and affordable.   Only drawback is that it closes somewhat early, but still a must go.",0.9865,0.823,0.177,0.0,0.6502272727272728
