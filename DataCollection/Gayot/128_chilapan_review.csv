2014-12-10,5.0,I love the food here!!  Olga has always been very pleasant every time we've dined in... Because the place is small they ask if you can keep your visit to a 2 hour maximum- which I was advised at the time of making the reservation... I've learned that ppl are emotional when they feel attacked.. In their defense they let you know the rules of the house before hand.. Give them a try.. I like food here better than Rick bayless restaurants.  Maybe they need to change how they approach the guests that dine there.. But the food is great!! I like to see small businesses thrive. I wish them well!!,0.9796,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.6142857142857142
2014-08-01,4.0,"This places far exceeded my expectations.  Our server was very nice, knowledgeable and attentive for our table of six.  I got the salmon, which had just the right amount of heat and perfectly crispy skin balanced by the sweetness from the potato.  The sangria that they made was fantastic and the margaritas were good.  I think the guys were a little hot because the AC was a little light, but I was very comfortable. Will definitely go back again.",0.9573,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.7296703296703295
2014-07-08,2.0,"My friend made a reservation so we all trekked over to Logan Square.  I thought the food was good but very overpriced for what it was.  No entree is below $18.  The flan was great though.  Our waiter was just kind of off, trying a little too hard.  I had the volcano, which was interesting.  There was cactus in there which was good, but the only other vegetables were whole onions.  Kind of gross having to pick them out.  Would probably not order it again but then again I don't think I will go back.   The two stars are really for the decor / atmosphere.  It was empty inside and it felt like they had taken discarded lawn furniture and used that as some of the chairs, tables, etc.  Felt a little grungy.   Everything just felt a little strange / off / odd.",0.6811,0.757,0.13,0.113,0.47333333333333333
2014-07-04,4.0,"Really interesting menu! I was a little bummed about the ""no substitutions"" policy for large groups (more than 6, I believe?). Everything we ordered was super delicious, especially the chorizo black beans side dish on my plate. There were some issues with the electricity that night (oops!), and air circulation was a problem! Prepare to sweat while you're there, but you're sure to have a great meal. I hope they work out some of those kinks; it was frustrating to have to wait and wait and wait for all of us to get our food in order to eat. (Yes, we follow etiquette rules that say you have to wait to eat until everyone is served.) And so we did. But my warm-ish food was still good.",0.9563,0.78,0.168,0.051,0.6806216931216932
2014-06-30,5.0,"I'm a huge fan of Chilapan.  We went with a large group for dinner and everyone left very happy.  The food is absolutely delicious, and the BYOB (with mixers available) is an added bonus.  The entree prices are on the high side, but the BYOB makes up for it.",0.8197,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.6097959183673468
2014-06-29,5.0,"A truly delicious dinner. They change their menu every now and then, but I think certain menu items are permanent (like the guacamole). I had the Volcano which is basically your choice of meat cooked in a molchajete(sic) with vegetables and cheese. It comes with a side of beans. The place is BYOB which makes it more awesome.",0.9192,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.7678571428571428
2014-06-02,2.0,"If you have a very long wait at 90 Miles Cuban Cafe, & decide that you are too hungry to wait, DO NOT GO TO this place.  I assure that you will be unbelievably disappointed by the slow service, lack of drink selection, & extremely overpriced menu options. Every entrée was at least $18, & they were definitely not worth the price.  Stay at 90 Miles, the wait is worth it! It may be close by, but you will spend way too much money for nothing & leave feeling ripped off.",-0.3793,0.854,0.053,0.093,0.43375
2014-05-31,1.0,"This restaurant needs a class or two on etiquette,  customer service, and customer appreciation.  I was celebrating my birthday today May 31, 2014, food and service was good but beware with the chilapan witch aka the owner. I have to admit this lady/owner is the most rude, unprofessional , delusional thing I've encountered.  After being told that we'd over stayed our reservation and that the restaurant had lost millions of dollars lol, my party of 11 and I decided 90 miles is only a walk away.  If your looking for a place with great food and service CHILAPAN is NOT the place to go, save your time, appetite, and money.  Att: The 12 paisas you kicked out.",0.8535,0.703,0.185,0.111,0.6916666666666668
2014-05-31,1.0,Very disappointed at this spot! Went there for a friends birthday party and was confronted by the owner before I finished my meal about not leaving on time for the next party saying we had over staid our welcome and that the place was loosing money because of us being there when the place was EMPTY!!! I didn't even finish my food.,0.7133,0.718,0.175,0.107,0.59375
2014-04-20,3.0,"I remembered about this place from a couple years back (when I went for a friend's bday at its original location almost across the street). This new and expanded location, while still small, is a big improvement and is able to accomodate the crowd Chilapan draws. Ambiance: very colorful, warm, authentic Mexican art and overall decor. Crowd: very lively, happy vibe. Laid back. Big groups capitalizing on the BYOB. Dinner dates. Service: Pretty good. Our waiter was trying really hard but he was a little creepy. Not sure why, since he was a normal-looking young guy, but he just kept smiling this weird little smile and was kind of spacey...I dunno. Weird. Food: Overall very solid and I am happy I came back for a second try. But not AS good as I remembered. Here is what we had: - Guac. NOTE: order the mild unless you like VERY VERY spicy guac. I typically get medium but their medium almost charred my tongue off. So you've been warned. However, once we excahnged for the mild it was awesome guac. - Chile con queso (was dope) - Chicken enchiladas (huge, delish portion) - Desserts: can't remember but they weren't good. This was unfortunate because one of the most memorable items from my first visit was a dessert.  I would recommend this place for a solid, authentic Mexican dinner with little fuss.",0.9902,0.74,0.21,0.05,0.5204882154882154
