2010-12-20,3.0,"Holiday party time!! I'm lucky that my husband's work tends to pick some good places for the party. His company or their party planner has an affinity for swankier, trendier places in River North and the Viagra Triangle. No complaints here since it's an excuse to dress up and mingle with his coworkers and their spouses.  Entering this club felt like a time warp into my younger days of hitting the clubs. The coat check bottled up with many, already intoxicated coworkers ready to have some fun, so that brought me back. Once in the club, I ordered my drink, their signature gingerbread cocktail. The drink itself was disappointing, not very ginger-y and heavy on the lemon. I hoped for something sweeter to the point that it just tasted like gingerbread. I switched to Diet Coke & vanilla vodka for the rest of the night. They served beverages in hard plastic cups. It disappointed a whiskey bourbon drinking coworker alot. Also, I'm really not fond of bathroom attendants especially pushy ones or ones that lord over the bathroom with lock & key and dole you out one napkin to wash your hands with. Even sadder, the bathroom attendant was a ""red hat society"" member in a swank club. Just didn't add up to me.   Since we're a corporate party, we were served some food!! It's especially helpful when a majority of the staff have been drinking since the early afternoon and endured a charter bus ride without libations in hand. They served as salad, risotto, cut asparagus, pork, and chicken. The pork and chicken were horribly dry and tasteless. I really only liked the sides of asparagus and the risotto. The risotto was doted with wild mushrooms and was very delicious. The salad was alright until I had a minor allergic reaction to nuts in it. From the outset, the salad looked safe for me to eat. Please advertise that you have nuts in your food to prevent me from having a less than stellar time at the party. After the entree, they served some petite desserts. The desserts and the risotto were the best part of the night.  Overall, I had a wonderful time at my husband's holiday party. The setting was perfect for his workplace, but as a whole, the venue didn't deliver much beyond risotto, sweets, and decent pours.",0.9735,0.807,0.132,0.061,0.5139583333333333
2010-11-27,1.0,"This place is pretty awful. Granted, I'm not a big nightclub-goer (I go clubbing maybe once every other month), but I can honestly say this is the worst club I've ever been to.  Le Passage is in the basement in some building downtown. Because it's in the basement, the ceilings are really low, which made me feel kind of claustrophobic. The club's floors are painted concrete, which is pretty dangerous when you're wearing high-heels and drinks have been spilled on the floor. The only positive thing I can say about the Le Passage's decor are the circular support columns, which are covered with iridescent glass tiles. They were very sparkly and pretty. Other than that, its decor was rather lackluster. It looks like they were trying to go for a sort of ""Aladdin"" theme with colorful drapery and velvety benches, but I just don't think they pulled it off. When it's all said and done, you're still in a damp basement.  The service at Le Passage is also poor. You'd think if you had a group of people who were dropping a couple hundred dollars for table service, you would treat them with a little respect.  The crowd at this club is also a little older, like mid- to late 30s. Maybe if you're in that age bracket, you would like this club more than someone like me who's 27. But overall, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone, regardless of age.",0.9726,0.76,0.162,0.078,0.5837995337995339
2010-10-19,2.0,Le Passage disappointed me. I agree the place is big but the approach to the club downstairs is kinda of weird. I didn't quite like the kind of music they were playing. Drinks are very steeply priced and are not at all strong enough to give you a kick. Would give it a miss since there are a couple of good options on Viagra Triangle.,-0.5148,0.723,0.108,0.169,0.6104166666666666
2010-10-14,2.0,"As a clubber of sorts, I have stopped here many of times only to remain disappointed.  I have come here at all times of the night, (open late), and I always leave feeling icky.  I would only recommend coming here if you are on the guest list, or invited to a birthday party.  It is really not a place you go out of your way to come to.  Here is my breakdown: One thing Le Passage does well is their guest list / door bouncing.  Who ever manages the front door, you do it well.  The bouncer is not an a* hole, the guest list girl is always nice and the big bouncer is not very intimating.  The process to get in is a breeze.  I do not recommend coming here on a Thursday or Friday, the clientele is questionable per say.  Maybe the door needs a little harsher bouncing.   So once you make your way in, be prepared to walk on a cobble bumped, hole filled path to the front door.  DANGEROUS.  Le Passage, please repave!  It is a death trap!  I will say, the bouncer who is the in between guy from the ropes to the door makes me feel a lot safer when the questionables come in.  He looks pretty tough.  Now as you enter you need to prepare your self for two things.   An extremely packed club where getting a drink / dancing is impossible or an empty club, where 5 people are bumping and grinding on each other like no ones watching (because no one is ... the place is empty).   Let's explore the impossibly packed club.  Generally it's filled with sweaty first time club goers - which is fine.  I think Le Passage is a great starter club / lounge for those a like.  The music is okay, some times they play way too many throw backs.  The lounge area is usually filled with people who are first time bottle service buyers and clears out pretty quick.  I just don't like the space it self.  It never looks clean.  There is also a quasi private back bar, that usually caterers to whomever pops in, though the people back there act like they are in VIP.  UH hello?  It looks like a freaking kitchen!  The smoking section is accessible, and is usually good for dipping out unexpected as it is connected to the entry way through a different set of stairs rather than the ones you walked in from.   The reason I leave feeling icky, because the men that go there are just gross.  They are just not good looking. So girls this place is safe to bring a potential boyfriend to, as you will not be wanting to get any guys numbers from here!    Drink prices are moderate, and they do pour strong shots.  Bartenders range from nice to moody which is typical.   Walking in when this place is empty, is REAL horrifying.  It makes your stomach sink.  It is best to peak around the corner when you walk down stairs and if you don't see any one back up and leave!  It looks like a dead zone of cougars and zombies.",0.9812,0.767,0.141,0.092,0.6017056530214425
2010-10-06,4.0,"I personally am a pretty big fan of Le Passage. This place is open until 5 am so even if you go to a different club and leave there at 2, you can hit up Le Passage and keep drinking until 5. I've never had a bad experience here. Ok. I lie, I actually passed out in here standing up next to a pillar in the corner of the club, got kicked out, and as I was waiting outside trying to figure out what just happened, the same bouncer who kicked me out, came back out, apologized to me and walked me back inside to my table. I guess when you're VIP and have a couple bottles of Goose and bottles of champagne at the table, this is what happens. So it really wasn't a bad experience. Just a story worthy experience. All the girls I've encountered here have been pretty hot. I've met some unbelievably phenomenal girls. And yes, I was smashed when I met them but when you look at the pictures the next day or wake up and roll over and see her in your bed, ya, not bad at all. Anyways, the waitresses are also really good looking and really cool. Most of them come over to us and actually hung out with us sometimes. I've had a couple friends get their numbers and meet up with them on other days so all I can say is that they are not stuck up hot girls. Well. A bottle of Goose and Belvedere is $325. The cheapest vodka that they have is Stoli and Effin which are $275. Champagne will run you at least $300. Yes. The bottles here are a little more expensive than other places but to be honest.

2010-05-30,2.0,"A resounding ""meh"" definitely describes my experience. If you read my review of Sound-Bar, you know that I'm not a club person. It seems to be the trend that most Yelp reviewers are in the same boat as me, too. After the tapas dinner, the B'Day parade continued to Le Passage. I was excited because I've never been here before. It's another one of those Chicago ultra clubs that everybody goes to. And I don't understand why. Actually, I do. It seems that clubs like this or Enclave are inhabited by suburbanites and tourists, not homegrown Chicago stompers. I hate sounding like a snob, I really do. We arrived at the alley entrance, guys had to drop $20, girls got in free. I get it, but still extremely annoying. We got there at about 11PM so the place was beginning to fill up. I was a little shocked to see that the club skewed a little older. Not a bad thing, just interesting. I got my vodka and we started dancing a little bit. I was extremely turned off by the DJ. For being such an ""upscale nightclub,"" it was weird that the DJ was spinning like he was at Barleycorn in Wrigleyville. No thank you. We hung out for about two hours, saw a lot of interesting people, but just wasn't feeling it.

Other than that, I cannot for the life of me fathom why anyone would wait in line to get in here, much less pay a COVER to get in here.  It's overpriced, it smells funny, the crowd is a bit on the dodgy side, and the staff can get a tad snippy.  I'd rather drink in my basement.  If I burned $200, sexually harassed myself, lost my coat, played super loud house music and stumbled around in the dark trying to find a bathroom it would essentially be the same thing but at least I wouldn't have to try and get a cab home.",0.9378,0.774,0.145,0.08,0.6111388888888888

Le Passage is a decadent wonderland for people who think they are too cool.  And yes, I was there, so sometimes I think I'm too cool.  But it was a birthday party for a friend and I of course needed to make my cameo... Needless to say, I had a blast, i guess it's a matter of who you're with that makes the party, we had the front area reserved with a private bartender and cocktailers with drinks on the house, so.. what more can you ask.  There were balloons everywhere and a nice mix of yuppies and hipsters. The downfall of the night was the ""other"" people.  The crowd was okay, the music had a lot to be said for and the dance floor was not at all being danced on.  But I will say, that it probaby has a nice little vibe in the corner with your own group..  I'd go back for a large group gathering.. Champagne, strawberries, favorite people and deep ambient decadence is always on my list. xoxo",0.9843,0.804,0.196,0.0,0.6174107142857144

2007-12-27,1.0,I hate this place. I know that is a strong statement but that is the way I feel. First I can't justify paying $20 at the door just to get in. And here is why... - I walk in and the space is too small in my opinion to be a dance club. It gets too crowded that you can't even dance.  - The drinks are okay and the price is what you would except in downtown Chicago.  - The ambience in there is not at all worth the money you spend to have a decent time. They should spend more time finding way to improve this club then remodeling to look and feel like a NY club. I'm in Chicago for a reason.  I don't mind spending some money but damn at least make it worth wild. I have been there once and I know I will never go again.,0.4023,0.854,0.079,0.067,0.4575757575757576

Its completely a different set up! The back was a VIP area and they gave their friends/investors/vips these poker chips to get in...It was a good idea...I honestly wonder if they still do the tiki  style drinks in a huge bowl that looks like a coconut...Sounds like Trader Vics in San Francisco! And that was the theme they were going over... Like everything its morphed into something else...And I think that after being open so long its hard to keep up trends...So its more crowded now, the VIP area is in a completely different area...Bottles are served instead of signature drinks..(Actually I really have to lookinto that!)
