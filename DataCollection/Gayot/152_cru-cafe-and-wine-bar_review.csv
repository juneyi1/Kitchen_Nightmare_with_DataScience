2007-03-14,5.0,"Cru!  Thank goodness you're back!  I've missed you so much!  I was always a fan of the old Cru, but the new Cru is even better.  I think they expanded their menu and the food is tasty!  Their cheese plates are a bit more tame and to my liking (see my review of Bin Wine Cafe).  The location is great and its a very comfortable place - I'd come here instead of going to Pops again.  And there's something about those half bottles... its just the perfect amount of wine to warm you up.",0.9853,0.7,0.286,0.014,0.46565656565656566
2007-03-12,5.0,"We went here to eat on a Saturday night before we saw Wicked - it was perfect.  The small rooms, the lighting, and the seating were all romantic.  The place wasn't too busy because in part we were early (around 6) and we were in an enclosed room.  We had the one of our best meals in Chicago here - I had the French Cheese flight, Sparkling Wine flight, and Cru Club.  Hands down all were great - but by far the Club is the best best sandwich I've ever had.  A surf and turf club - Lobster and Tenderloin Filet slices with avocado and chili mayo - so so good.  Boyfriend had the Oysters, Sake flight, and Steak with Fries.  He had no complaints.  Service was helpful and accomodating.  Bathrooms were clean and nicely designed.",0.9868,0.702,0.244,0.054,0.5159259259259259
2007-03-04,3.0,"I used to go to the old Cru because it was never packed, had good couches, good wine, and some good desserts. Their service used to be horrible, as well as the music. The inside layout of Cru has completely changed - whereas before it was a wide open room, now it has several smaller rooms and a main room with the bar. I sat at a table by the bar, and there wasn't much space. I guess having the small back room with couches would be cool with friends. The focus isn't on comfort seating anymore, as a majority of the space comprises of  tables instead of comfy chairs and couches. But it still doesn't feel like a typical bar, more like a sitting table type bar. The many chandeliers are more discrete, since you can't see all of them across a wide open space anymore. The music and service have improved. The food changed a little, and as for drinks they still have a good wine list which includes Moscato D'Asti (awesome!) which goes great with their bread pudding. One horrible thing about the new Cru - the bar now attracts the creepy Viagra Triangle crowd. The mafia and serial killer type creepy 40-something men that will approach any and all females and will not let you walk by without them blocking you and forcing conversation (maybe they actually left Tavern on Rush and are camping out here now). We spent the whole time there uncomfortable because of the creepy guys openly staring at us with that creepy look in their eye. I know it's not the fault of the bar, but it will definitely affect  you if you are walking through the bar or within sight of these people.  I'd go there with a couple of friends for a chill night at a non-overcrowded bar where you can sit and have a few cocktails. I wouldn't go there without a man, though, to ward off the creepy 40-something male crowd.",0.669,0.87,0.069,0.061,0.5321969696969697
2007-01-07,3.0,"Very different from the old Cru! It's much larger and nicer as well. It looks like the perfect spot for a date, but I experienced it with a bunch of other girls.   Our waitress was awful (seemed to be the theme of last night) and ignored our table, but when she finally did show up I ordered the Riesling. I wasn't such a fan of the wine, but fortunately there are many other options for me to choose from next time.",-0.623,0.797,0.089,0.114,0.564047619047619

2006-12-24,4.0,"I spent many nights at the old Cru.  It was a very popular date spot and I always got a good laugh when guys thought they were being oh so original by taking me to Cru.  I was a fan of the extensive wine menu and loved getting their cheese platter (I  have a thing for cheese).  Besides the cheese platter there wasn't really much on the menu to choose from. Last night my boyfriend and I checked out the new and improved Cru.  It's much more spacious, just as many wines as before (if not more), and a large menu to choose from (although rather expensive).  We weren't very hungry after devouring popcorn and twizzlers at the movies earlier so we went the wine and cheese route.  I was happy with the French cheese flights, but then again put any cheese in front of me and I'm happy.   The service was just OK (not overly impressed) and it was absolutely freezing in there- I did ask them to turn off the fans (who has fans the week of Christmas), but my request seemed to be ignored. My boyfriend said the new Cru is definitely a 3 star place, but I do love wine bars so I'm giving them 4 stars in the spirit of Christmas (and hoping that the service gets better to make this a 4 star establishment).",0.9913,0.786,0.194,0.02,0.5168159426780117
2006-12-18,3.0,"I like this wine bar, it's glam - on the Gold Coast! I always seem to get the sparkling wine, and really love it. The food is delish too, but they could pump up the portion size just a bit. Love the decor - it does get busy on weekends, perfect place for an ""after shopping"" drink! That said, sometimes the service can be really bad. I don't think they have enough bartenders for when it gets busy.",0.907,0.744,0.198,0.058,0.5666666666666667
2006-11-18,5.0,"Yay! The newly remodeled Cru Cafe has reopened! I went here last night for a post dinner drink and was impressed by the new digs. They maintained a similar decor to what they had before, but the space overall is so large! There are still cushy couches to sit in while you enjoy your wine. We opted to sit at the bar, which was much bigger than before as well. The crowd was great, definitely more business professionals and lots of out of towners here on business. The wine list appears to be the same, which is great because I always found something yummy here.",0.9867,0.747,0.253,0.0,0.494952071737786
2006-11-17,3.0,"We stopped in last night for a late snack/meal after an event at LUMA. Having visited before the renovation and really enjoying the experience, my girlfriend and I were really looking forward to the new location.  Unfortunately, it was not as enjoyable as anticipated. The renovations have taken a larger area and created smaller seating areas that allow more patrons whilst also making each group's experience more intimate.  The dark earth tones and warm lighting is very nice, though at times makes it difficult to read the menu. On our last trip, we ordered a cheese plate to munch on while contemplating our full meal.  After partaking of the cheese, we were satisfied by the ample cheese, breads, crackers, fruits and nuts; we didn't even need an entree.  On this visit, we kept that in mind and ordered a glass of wine each and the French cheese plate.  Unfortunately, the cheese plate was not nearly as big as last time.  The crackers were completely gone and the bread was not nearly sufficient.  Not only was there less food, there was no explanation of the cheeses.  We were able to quickly identify the bleu, but the other two soft cheeses (Brie and something I have since forgotten) were hard to distinguish by appearance.  When you have multiple cheeses on one plate, how can you not explain which is which?  That was poor. We enjoyed our experience but it couldn't hold a candle to our last trip.  The food was good, but the portion size seems to have dropped and the service wasn't quite what you'd hope for in a place like this.  Otherwise it was a good time.  It certainly was intimate and a nice atmosphere for a date.",0.9728,0.823,0.121,0.056,0.5097798542920496
2006-08-25,4.0,"OK. I can't decide if I like the re-opened Cru.  I love the selection and the knowledgable staff.  However, I just don't think its as comfy as it was before.  Definitely a great casual date spot, but it's become a little ""corporate.""   I think I'm going to have to come back a few times to feel it out some more.  Can anyone comment on their menu?",0.779,0.813,0.162,0.024,0.4240740740740741
