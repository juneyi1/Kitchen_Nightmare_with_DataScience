2009-03-05,3.0,"... More like 3.5. My firm took us here to celebrate the end of our summer asociateship. We went during lunch and it was pretty close to empty. We had a private room right up front. The service was excellent from the get go- but I'd probably chalk that up to the waitstaff's lack of anything else to do.  The first thing you notice is that the place is HUGE. It's like a whole city block. It's called Powerhouse because it's located in a .... wait for it... former power station.  I had an heirloom tomato salad to begin and it was above average. I had salmon for my entree (I think- the menu has changed since I ate here and it was a while ago). The fish was also good, if slightly forgettable. For desert I had something else really good... but I forget what that one was too.  This review is admittedly a little vague, but I think the fact that I can't really remember what I had is actually a little revealing of the overall quality of Primehouse. Nothing was bad, it's just that nothing was good enough to really remember. Oh well.",0.884,0.791,0.129,0.08,0.4724285714285713
2009-02-16,1.0,"I just had my worst dining experience ever, and the unfortunate part is that it was Valentine's Day. The day that every restaurant should put their best foot forward on.  To start, we had an 8:45pm reservation. We arrived on time and were told they were a little behind schedule and that we could wait at the bar. After waiting to order a drink for 10 minutes, we got our order in. After waiting another 10 mins, I had to remind the 1 bartender working that night that he forgot our order.  After waiting at the bar for 50 minutes, we were finally seated at a table. We thought that after this insane wait (considering we had reservations), that everything would go smoothly.  Once at our table, we waited another 10 minutes for our waiter. We placed our order for everything at that time- wine, starters and steaks. It took about 10 minutes to get the wine. After this we sat waiting for soup & salad for an hour. By the time it came, we had to order another bottle of wine, because our 1st one was already gone. After the starters came, it took another 30-40 minutes for the steaks. By this time the service was such a joke, that everyone sitting at neighboring tables had made friends and together we all commiserated about our situation. Even the servers were very apologetic and had to laugh about the situation. We were asked if we'd like desert, and on all nights we had to say no because I couldn't handle the thought of being stuck in that place another hour.  I have no idea what went wrong this past Saturday, but the &*^% hit the fan, and this place is in no way worth being put through that kind of misery. My husband and I would have been much happier ordering a pizza and staying home.",-0.4122,0.876,0.058,0.066,0.578125
2009-02-08,3.0,"Eh.  It's lovely to look at, but I wasn't totally taken by Powerhouse. I made reservations for dinner there last week with my mom and we were lukewarm about it. The hostess was fine, the service was fine, but the food just wasn't that great. We ordered the crab cake to start and the hummus, too. The hummus was *way* too big for even a couple people. It was a trough of hummus. Good hummus, sure, but too much and too many mushrooms on top of it. The crab cake was good but not memorable -- maybe it's my fault for wanting a crab cake outside of, like, Maine, to be memorable.  Entrees were similarly okay, though I know some haters will think we played it too safe and don't deserve a good meal or something... Mom had chicken (sue her, she likes chicken) and I had the crab ravioli YES after having the crab cake to start. A rare thing for me to do, I know, but I was the one who ordered the hummus, anyway.  The ravioli was sorta gummy and the crab was not terribly flavorful. The sauce masked some of this, but I was too sleuthy for it. I could tell I was not dealing with a terrific dish. Mom's wine was paired nicely, though, and her chicken was tasty.  We ordered the cheese platter for dessert. I was so excited for the cheese! The waiter arrived and told us that there was no cheese, however. No cheese left. None whatsoever. So he comped us the sweet potato doughnuts which kicked much ass. But I was surprised that a place like that would just be *out* of cheese. Just *out* of all cheese. Out.  Powerhouse is fine. I really liked the room itself and the businessy folks around us seemed to be enjoying themselves. But for the money, it's just not there for the likes of me or my mom. And we're all right.",0.9944,0.725,0.207,0.068,0.6297505668934239
2008-12-30,1.0,"I seriously have to wonder if this place is planning on staying in business.  We went there tonight for my husband's birthday. We were seated and then waited 10 minutes before a waiter showed up to hand us our menus and 10 minutes before he asked us for our order. And thus began the great and futile quest for a bottle of wine. First off let me say that the wine list was ridiculous. It was no more than 10 wines in the red category. Which wouldn't be a big deal --except that they started at $50 a bottle and topped out at $200. First off - that's an excessive mark up. Second of all, we would have accepted it -- except that we ordered a bottle of wine for $50. And we were told that they weren't sure that they had it -- but they did have another bottle -- THAT WAS $175 a bottle.   When I asked them to check if the $50 bottle was in stock, the server then disappeared for 25 minutes. During that time, the appetizers we ordered appeared. The oysters were . . . disgusting and almost cost me a trip to the dentist. They were filled with shells. I'm still sore from the one I ate.  The fresh mozerella tasted more like a blue cheese and the tomatoes were tasteless.  The only bright spot was the crab cake. Which would have encouraged me to keep trying and have a decent meal at this place. Except that during this time the waiter finally came back to tell me that the only wine that they had in more than one bottle was a $200 a bottle shiraz. They had run out of the house wine that they were pouring by the glass -- which they simply had referred to as a cab. How do you not know what wine you're pouring? And how do you run out of booze the day before NEW YEAR's EVE?? The waiter told us that he would talk to the owner to see if he could do something about the $200 a bottle price tag. And then he disappeared for 20 more minutes. He only came back when we asked the bus boy for the check -- and then it was to inform us that he had talked to the owner and the owner was willing to go out an buy some wine so that we could have something to drink. The waiter said this with a bottle of wine in his hand for another table. That's just weird. Honestly, I have a lot of patience. But it wasn't until I got home that I realize just how stupid this whole thing was. We had to wait another 15 minutes for the bill for the appetizers -- which put us out $45.  (Plus valet.) But the kicker is that while we were waiting for the bill, the management was canceling our reservation on open table, the online reservation site that we used to get our reservation. If the restaurant cancels the reservation then you can't review your experience. So, instead of trying to keep our tab, they were busy making sure that we wouldn't be able to report our experience to an online community.  i used to be a restaurant reviewer and  theater critic and I always had a reputation of being fair. I get how hard this business is. But people are putting their hard earned cash AND their special, memory making occasions in your hands. The least you could do is give me a little consideration and not try to up-sell me with a bottle of wine that is marked-up 600 %. I had spent days dreaming about the menu -- which was created by a Trotters and North Pond alum. Sadly, that never even came into the equation. No one ever bothered to ask us what we'd like for dinner. They were too busy try to sell us $200 bottles of wine they didn't have. In case you couldn't tell -- I'm seriously disappointed. We ended up going to our old neighborhood stand-by -- Ignotz's.  And when we told Roger, the owner, our woes of the evening -- he bought us a drink for our troubles. And that  is the sign of a great dining experience.",-0.8568,0.856,0.062,0.082,0.59338455988456
2008-12-24,1.0,"We attended lunch at Powerhouse last Monday, as it is in proximity to my office and a vendor was treating. Notwithstanding the fact that we had a reservation and the restaurant was fairly empty, we were stuck in a tiny table in the corner. We were never provided with bread, despite the fact that all the other tables in the restaurant had bread. We had to ask specifically for a wine list also. When we ordered our wine, we were told 10 minutes later that the by-the-glass sauvignon blanc was not available. We were provided with an alternative without the opportunity to choose from the list, even though we asked to see the list again. When we ordered our meal, the restaurant was OUT of red meat. This place is a STEAKHOUSE and they had no red meat. We were there at noon, not at the end of the night. There was no excuse for this. Also, the chicken entree I ordered came with no accoutrement...no vegetable, no starch. Additionally, there were no side dishes to order.  I asked for any kind of vegetable and was told that the restaurant only had a la carte salads, but no cooked vegetables. I thought they were joking until I saw the waiter sweating and looking nervously at me. The chicken/mushroom entree tasted good, but it was two pieces of chicken and sauce with a sprig of rosemary on the whole plate. Also, it tasted nothing like the prime rib I had initially ordered. Desserts were blah. We had the chocolate duo, and the espresso cake was all right but the truffle tasted like a stale brownie.  Overall, all I can say is that we were fed. We received no discount for the inconvenience, and this was not a cheap meal. I must note that this review in no way reflects the efforts of our waiter...it was his first day and he tried hard. It was not his fault that the STEAKHOUSE had NO RED MEAT. I have specifically contacted the restaurant, demanding satisfaction, and will see what happens. When and if I receive a response, I will update my review; until then, ONE STAR.",-0.9502,0.855,0.038,0.107,0.4044513457556936

Other than that snafu, our waiter was very nice, almost painfully so- he seemed a bit shy and soft spoken. He asked if we would like suggestions, and then proceeded to describe every single item on the menu. . . okay.  Other waiters seemed to be a bit more. . . together. The table across from us received the wine list upon sitting down, had the bread basket explained to them. . . we were kind of on our own for the most part. But we all know what's really important- the food. The food is very, very good. To start we each had soup- mine was a sweet onion with pickled pearl onions, Gruyere and baguette.  I was expecting a traditional French onion soup, and this was a nice twist. The soup was a very finely strained puree, dark and rich with a slight tang from the pickling.  The boyfriend's soup was a similar puree of cannelini beans with rosemary, which was also delicious.  And they do a tableside soup service, which I'm a total sucker for. For entrees, he had the 18 oz ribeye, which was cooked to perfection with a nice charred crust.  I took the waiter's advice and went with the braised short ribs, which were served over a creamy polenta.  I had never had short ribs before, and they were fantastic.  However, the boyfriend attempted to eat the leftover piece last night, and said that it was basically just a giant piece of fat.  The piece I ate had no fat, and was tender and wonderful.  I could have done without the mountain of parsley, though. We wound up getting 2 desserts, because everything on the menu sounded so good.  I'd have to say it was disappointing.  He had the chocolate pecan pie which was seriously lacking in chocolate, and served with a chicory ice cream.  I had the 'banana and peanut butter' which was essentially a banana mouse on top of a peanut butter- feulletine spread. The presentation was nice, but the flavors just weren't really there. And had we known that we would each receive a tray of menardies with the check- pate de fruit, a tiny cookie, and a truffle- we probably would have just passed on dessert entirely. This place isn't cheap, but it's worth it for a nice night out. The bill came to about $140 for 2 apps, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 1 glass of wine and 1 coffee. Fortunately we had a $100 gift certificate.  I think we'll go back at some point, but while it's a little out of our price range for now, I would definitely recommend it to those with the budget to handle it!",0.9969,0.79,0.16,0.05,0.5958308531746033
2008-01-07,2.0,"Very comfortable, decor a bit sterile service was excellent. Wine by the glass list reasonably priced, appetizers very good - why 2 stars? Main course pork chop dry. Main course cod was so heavily salted the fish probably came from the Dead Sea. Vegetables with main courses good.

2008-01-02,3.0,"I don't know what they could do other than a redesign to liven this place up - but the menu could possibly have potential.  My fiance had found this place in his search for restaurants he wanted to try on his short stint back from Italy and it's history in an old powerhouse (thus the name).  We arrived a little earlier than the rest of the people joining us and made our way to the bar.  While the bartenders were very nice and knowledgeable, we couldn't get over the fact that they ""renovated"" this beautiful old building by putting in a generic drop ceiling and bland tables with maroon vinyl table covers making it look more like a Holiday Inn bar than that of an upscale Chicago restaurant.  The dining room was more elegant but very small.  It was surprising that for its size and emptiness it took awhile for a server to even greet us.  The menu is small (although they do have another menu in the bar which they don't serve in the main dining area) and without a lot of variety.  The lobster risotto that I had for an appetizer was good, but not really any size appropriate to share with more than one person - unfortunate since it was $20.  The venison that I had for dinner was also good - which is more than I can say for everyone else - the pork chop came out overcooked and the ny strip was lacking any wow factor.  I would use the word ""fine"" if someone asked me what I thought about the restaurant.  Very pricey overall with little to back it up.",0.9888,0.818,0.147,0.035,0.5109595959595961
2007-12-31,2.0,"First off, this place is disappointingly sterile.  My fiance and I showed up about 30 minutes early and sat at the bar.  The Bartender where really nice and accommodating.  The mixed together a special drink for me which I have grown to love in Italy.  We were surprised to see they had a separate bar menu that they wouldn't server in the regular room to give us more app options. Once we sat down it did take awhile to get some service and the place was hardly full (on a Friday night).  The service was slow, I'm fine and appreciate a slower pace but this was too long.  The server did make a great recommendation on the wine (wish I could remember it, a pinot that started with an S). We started with the lobster risotto (OK) and some seafood tartare (also OK).  The moved onto the onion soup (very good) and the romaine hearts salad (good). For dinner most of us ordered the pork chop, which surprising they wouldn't take a temp on. (the chef cooks it perfectly they said).  Well the chef cooked it all the way through med-well at best.  The Chop wasn't dry and still had some good juice to it but I couldn't help but think it would have been much better had it been cooked med-rare.  It was still a very good chop. Overall it was such a sterile place with good but not great food.  The service needs to be improved also.  I wouldn't go back.",0.9951,0.775,0.208,0.017,0.519108299108299
2007-12-20,5.0,"Wow. I went here for a birthday with my family because my dad is friends with Jimmy Alexander. But next time, I will be back for the food and atmosphere!  Jimmy had us wait a bit to get the best table in the house and it was truly magnificent. Beautiful round booths are both cozy and comfortable. The place is in an historic building that used to be the power house for the el so feel of the place is classic. The dining room was designed to mimic a Pullman dining car and features red drapes sectioning off areas and sliding doors to private dining rooms.  As for the food, everything was absolutely delicious. We started with the Lobster Risotto and Romaine Hearts salad with Alexander's famous garlic dressing. Fantastic! We were a little unsure if the two would satisfy 4 hungry people but the portions were perfect. Any more and I wouldn't have been able to finish my dinner.  For dinner, everyone at my table but me had steaks and all raved about them. I had the Pheasant and found it delicious. It had a moist sage dressing accompanying it and the cutest roasted carrot with a marshmellow brulee on top. It sounds strange but tasted incredible.  For dessert, Jimmy took care of us and brought us 4 differnet desserts. The best was for the birthday boy, an individual pecan pie in mini pot with Happy Birthday written out in chocolate on the plate. A nice touch! I have to say that we devoured all the desserts even though we were all full. Even my dad, who never eats sweets was raving and finishing off each bite. We had a trip of gelatos, one of which was blood orange and the best gelato flavor I've had, some kind of pudding type dish which tasted like cheesecake and sweet potato mini donuts which were absolutely divine.  All in all, the evening was spectacular and the birthday boy was so pleased and felt very special. We are planning on going back as soon as possible. I'd also like to try the bar food as it's a different menu and the sneak peeks we had of others' food looked great.",0.9983,0.757,0.227,0.016,0.6214880952380952
2007-12-18,3.0,"Powerhouse has been open for about 3 weeks.  That is probably why it was such a mixed bag when we ate there last night.  The headlines?  The food was great, and I mean absolutely delicious, but the service really missed it's mark. Powerhouse is located in the old Beaux Arts style building which used to be the powerhouse for the Chicago Railroad (thus the name).  I wish that they had not sterilized the interior so much because the decor inside is very ""Room and Board"" and being an old building person,  I would have liked to see some detail from this building other than the beautiful arched windows.  The bar area does a little better as it kept the tile window surrounds intact- the chips and imperfections adding interest to the more predictable drop ceiling and cookie cutter tables. We ordered a couple of appetizers (scallops and pork belly) along with a couple of salads(spinach and pomegranate, and pear and cheese) and finally the entrees (braised ribs, tenderloin and strip steak).   We also split an entree sized lobster risotto which was sweet and creamy. The food was delicious and done to perfection. I even had a ""picky"" friend with me and she was raving about the food which is rare.  Thus the three star rating However, the food is only half of the experience with the service bringing it together and this is where things fell apart.  The server never brought us any bread until we asked, yet all the tables around us had some (BTW- it was great bread, some all nutty and crunchy and some soft and white) The appetizers never showed up at all and when we asked about them- the server said he forgot to order them but he would and then comp them for us.  Well at that point we already had our entrees so we said no thanks.     Our server totally disappeared for 25 minutes at a time.  People around us were trying to flag someone, anyone, down to pay so that they could leave.  We had no less than 5 different people waiting on us including the owner at one point (the owner showed up when I flagged him as we were waiting with empty cocktail glasses on our table trying to order some wine).   When I talked to the other owner on the way out about our experience- he said that they were having trouble finding good help given it is a busy time in the industry and finding good help is hard. Both of the owners know what service is.  One came from Charlie Trotters where service is king and the other came from Pegasus- where I've never had an issue with service.  They know what needs to be done to make their new venture a success. So- will I go back?  Sure.  But not for a while to give them a chance to get their service up to the level of their food.",0.9965,0.799,0.152,0.049,0.47969977553310894
2007-12-08,4.0,"Powerhouse is new to my area and I'm glad I checked it out.. Originally thinking it was a gym (I think there is one above it), it is actually a small bar, nestled into a quiet and inconspicuous street near the train stations. The food is supposed to be excellent, sadly I didn't try any when I went. I did get a chance to talk to the owner and he was very friendly and even comp'ed us a round of drinks as a Metromix photographer snapped away for their review.  I will definitely go back here, it is a little more upscale than other places around the area, but not as high-brow as N9NE. It seems good for a casual drinks-after-work kinda place...",0.9021,0.851,0.133,0.016,0.5487967914438503
2007-12-02,3.0,"I just had dinner there tonight and I have to say I was disappointed, not sure if most of the other  reviews are from the ""friends and family"" night ...but for the price we paid for 3 people over $150 (without tip) and I only had 1 drink and even the drink was not that great.   The gumbo could have had a bit more rice and maybe some other fixings, it was like half a sausage, cut up into small chunks, it was good but on the small side.  The drinks are expensive, not sure if that's because they don't give you a choice - they automatically used Kettle One but in a Cosmo I think its OK to use a cheaper brand - I actually couldn't even taste any of the usually fruity flavors as the drink was heavy on the alcohol and I just lost interest in it as it was a Sunday night and I had to drive.  I just wanted a fun drink, I'm a wimp OK! The Shrimp poorboy was a mass of deep fried shrimp and it was mostly batter, I was having a hard time finding the little guys and the plate included homemade chips which were good but too salty.  The Oysters on the half shell were very good, but I really disliked the braised calamari, which was very small and really bland for the price and portion.   We did have desserts and the Pumpkin bread with the marscpone and walnuts were really good and great for $6 but I have had better Churos filled with chocolate by the Mexican vendors around town, this was a strange dessert for an up scale place and nothing special, even though the waitress swore that it was the house favorite and raved about it.   I don't  think I would go back if I have to pay myself, but I suppose if somebody wants to take me there and pay for me, I could give it another try.",0.9281,0.783,0.119,0.097,0.5089384920634921
2007-11-23,5.0,"I went yesterday for Thanksgiving, which was their first official day of being open to the public.  It was a pre-fixed, four course menu (which is to be expected on Thanksgiving) and it was not disappointing. I decided on two entrees; the beef tenderloin, which was cooked to perfection, as well as the turkey with sage stuffing which was equally as great.  (we ordered the turkey entree for the table...)  The portion size was perfect--not too big or small. Our waiter, who was not pushy what-so-ever,  was helpful about which wine to order and my lemon drop martini was cold, prefect and came with an optional sugar rim.  (such a bonus)   I really liked the vibe, especially because we were seated in a big plush booth which was comfortable and semi-private.   I liked this place a lot and look forward to seeing how the menu will evolve.",0.973,0.81,0.169,0.021,0.55
