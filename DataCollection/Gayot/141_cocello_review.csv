2015-05-30,4.0,"I live closeby and have loved watching this venue and menu evolve, from Dillmans Jewish deli to Cocello's first slightly confused menu, to the menu that now (brilliantly) includes gourmet pizzas, due to much demand. The latest menu, with pizza, pasta, meat dishes, and salads, has finally hit the sweet spot after months of fine tuning and slight misses. Before, you could come with two people, spend $100-150, and still leave slightly hungry.  Now, thanks to the menu composition, there's a better balance of big salads, small pastas (they are all delicious but with the exception of the huge meatball and spaghetti to share, childs portions) recommended: the Alfredo, the simple greens salad (exquisite and HUGE) the complimentary fennel bread, and the margarita pizza.  Advice: Get a salad to start, a pizza and a pasta or meat dish if you come with two people. Well done, Cocellos. Looking forward to seeing how you specialize further with the opening of the Hamptons across the street this summer as well.",0.9711,0.81,0.16,0.029,0.5459523809523811

I'm sure I'll be back in the fall when it returns. Then we had the egg yolk raviolo, and the octopus with caper berries and potatoes.  Both were outstanding.  Its a great place to share dishes and they encourage it.  Besides who can eat the raviolo on their own?  Its quite rich! For dessert they surprised us with the olive oil cake which I would have never ordered so I'm glad we got it. Once again our waiter make great picks!  It was heavenly.  Slightly warm with a hint of orange, and whipped marscarpone on the side.

Their menu is very European - limited appetizers but the pasta, fish and meat dishes can be an entree or shared among the table.  To start, we ordered the cheese/meat tower which was very good.  The bread they served was amazing - next time I would just order the cheese and bread and cocktails and I'd be totally satisfied.   The food was good - nothing outstanding or memorable, in fact we went there a few weeks ago and I can't even remember what I had for my main course.  A few of the guests at the table ordered the grilled octopus based on yelp reviews and didn't like it - the chili spices it was cooked with were too overpowering.  Our server was very accommodating and took them off the bill - in fact the service the whole evening was great from the hostess who greeted us to the buss staff that kept our table cleared.   Of the six people at our table, I think I enjoyed our experience at Cocello the most but I'm not sure I'd recommend it to others considering the many other great dining options in this area.",0.9908,0.765,0.182,0.053,0.516026455026455

That didn't stop there, my Italian friend asked him a simple question about a dish and he looked at her like she was stupid and said, ""Excuse me? I don't understand.""

The bread was tough and there was cheese on EVERYTHING and ALOT of it.  My friend and I shared the Avocado & Crab salad, which was really the only tasty part.  Then we shared 2 pastas - the Pasta all'Amatriciana, which was oily and not very flavorful as well as the Egg Yolk Raviolo, which I also thought had too much cheese on it.  It was extremely rich and not very balanced.  I would maybe give the restaurant one more shot, purely on previous reviews of my friend.",0.9806,0.802,0.17,0.027,0.47721626199887074

2014-12-21,4.0,"We celebrated our many years anniversary here. They indeed honored our request for a nice table. We were seated in a lovely corner booth overlooking the restaurant. We were near a faux fireplace, appointed with real-life lit candle sticks. And the bookshelves had lit candles throughout, and actual old books on the shelves. The point is...the ambiance is fantastic! Dark, candlelit, romatic, speakeasy-ish vibe. Now to the food. We concur w-the masses...the single ravioli appetizer is delicious. It would have been good to have been advised of the size of the plates though. We only realized it after our dinner. If you come appropriately hungry, you'll want to order one item from each section as the portions are quite teeny. I had the ravioli, the polenta, and the langostines (large head-on shrimp) as an entrée, but it wasn't enough with only five shrimp. It was delicious, but I could have eaten 2 orders. My husband ordered the bibb lettuce salad and the linguine and clams and that was also delicious, but a teeny portion. Again, we weren't advised as to how to order or asked about how hungry we were. We suggest ordering a salad, an appetizer, an item from the pasta or middle course, and then a main entrée. Trust me, you'll leave hungry otherwise.  The portions are sized to have several courses as they typically are in Italy. It's not a typical Chicago-sized portion, which is totally cool, if you know that up front. Cocktails were lovely, and the wine selection was good. THE OLIVE CAKE WAS was absolutely divine. The capuccino was very good.  Would we go back? I don't think so. Maybe? 'If I was in the neighborhood, yes!  No pics this time. Didn't want to be annoying.",0.9943,0.796,0.181,0.023,0.58568356374808

I informed the host and he said it would not be a problem and to go to the bar and try a drink. Turns out she was a half hour late but they still honored our reservation on a super busy night. Before she got there I offered to give up our table and sit at the bar since she was running so late and the host told me ""You're really nice, we won't do that, just let me know when she gets here."" I can't think of too many restaurants, especially ones this popular that would do that. Then we sat down and our server John was a great waiter. He walked us through the menu, told us about the dishes and drinks and was courteous and helpful without being annoying which is really had to do. That's just the service. The food is incredible. We ordered the lightly dressed salad, polenta, and day boat scallops to start. My fiancee said it was the best polenta she ever had and she orders polenta everywhere. Then I destroyed the scallops. It's very hard to cook bay scallops since they're so small but all 8 that came in my dish were cooked perfectly. There is a corn puree underneath with brown butter that makes it even better. We then ordered the cacio e pepe and the amatriciana. I'm very picky about cacio e pepe and I have to say they have the best in the city. I used to think Davanti was the best but their cacio evenly balances the cheese and oil which is so hard to do. The amatriciana was a little salty, but I really enjoyed it. Pieces of pork cheek in there mak it even better.  Overall, just like all Sodikoff restaurants, they know how to serve great food with impeccable service.

I went last night with a couple of girlfriends and we were seated in a cozy banquette and served by a very nice, helpful, and attentive (and, to be honest, really hot) guy. Unfortunately I can't remember his name,  our receipt says Stacy but that doesn't seem right.    We tried a few of their very creative cocktails and we're happy with all of them.  The vodka fizz in particular was good. We shared four dishes for the three of us, which was perfect.  Note: they will recommend you get two each, and unless you have an enormous appetite it will be way too much.  The fritta, the cacio e pepe, the raviolo and the ribeye. The fritta was heaven, the cacio good if a bit watery, the raviolo was loved by two of us and hated by the third, who isn't a fan of ricotta, and there is a ton of ricotta in it, and the ribeye was the best steak I've had in memory.   We finished the meal with amari and were too full for dessert. I wish they had limoncello on the menu, too. I would be very happy to go back and likely will.",0.9953,0.703,0.256,0.04,0.656878306878307

2014-11-17,3.0,"I was fond of Dillman's, Brendan Sodikoff's original concept of this spot; but apparently not many shared my view, and so Sodikoff has reconcepted the space as a casual Italian restaurant. The decor--carried over from Dillman's--will appeal to those who like Gilt Bar, Bavette's, and the like. Dim lighting, dark wood panelling, tin ceilings, tufted leather.  The menu is relatively straightforward. Some antipasti and a handful each of pasta, seafood, and meat dishes. We were't particular hungry the night we dined there, so I can only comment on a handful of the dishes. The burrata was terrific: great flavor and well seasoned with pepper, olive oil and, balsamic, with no extraneous accompaniments. The truffle risotto was cooked slightly al dente and had plenty of fresh black truffle. The egg yolk raviolo was carefully prepared--the pasta was nearly translucent and the brown butter sauce was applied in moderation--but the dish was almost too rich. The primary ingredient in the stuffing is ricotta, and their is quite a lot of it. The egg yolk just added to the richness. What the dish needed was a contrasting ingredient to cut the creaminess. Dessert was tiramisu. It was perfectly fine, with good espresso flavor, except that it was crowned with four or five inches or meringue. It is nearly impossible to find the tiramisu unless you eat through this enormous mass of meringue. We quickly gave up, stole a bread plate from an unoccupied table nearby (the server did not bring any plates with dessert and was not to be found), and toppled the meringue tower with a knife. Those issues aside, Cocello adheres the basic formula that has made Sodikoff's restaurants a success: rich, flavorful dishes, comfortable but stylish surroundings, and reasonable prices. Perhaps not worth a special trip, given the surfeit of Italian places in the city, but a good choice for those in the neighborhood.",0.9956,0.775,0.189,0.036,0.544747899159664

2014-11-14,5.0,"Sodikoff wins again! Cocello is the bomb, and I'm already dreaming of going back! In fact, it might just inch out Gilt Bar in my book.  From start to finish, this meal was actually perfect. I'll start off by saying that I absolutely adore Sodikoff's style of food and restaurant. This place matches his others-- rich food, and really warm, old school interior. The front of the restaurant is a candle-lit bar area, with a mix of some high tops and some round tables with big red velvet arm chairs. Very cozy. In the back is the formal dining area, which kind of reminds me of an old library. There's an area in the center of the backroom where all the fresh bread is coming out of the oven and they cut it in front of you-- very nice touch. The restaurant is spacious-- tables are spread out and leave plenty of room for you and your date/friend/etc to have a nice intimate meal. I really appreciate this, as a lot of restaurants are squeezing tables in these days, or doing communal style dining. We started off with two whiskey cocktails: the Improved Whiskey Cocktail and the Old Fashioned. Something I love that you can find lots of the same drinks on Sodikoff's menus, and the old fashioned is always the same recipe. My favorite.  We started with the Bib Lettuce Salad and the Octopus, followed by their famous Egg Yolk Raviolo, the Pasta Amatriciana, and finished with the Short Rib Marsala. Every dish was as tasty and unique as the next (there were no flops here). I'll give a special shout out to the Egg Yolk Raviolo, stuffed with egg and ricotta, along with the Short Rib Marsala, for being truly special and full of flavor.  I'll also mention that service was incredible. I've seen some reviews that gripe on service here, and we were completely wow'ed by our waiter. His suggestions were right up our alley, and he came by at all the right times without being overbearing in the slightest.

Their were only 10 little guys but they were delicious; cooked perfectly and the presentation was superb. I'm not a foodie and normally meh about plating but serving them in white seashells was beautiful. Not a ton of food with this option but given the bread and apps, I left satisfied.

2014-10-02,5.0,"I was in town on a business trip and went to Gilt Bar with my coworkers. We enjoyed it so much, we made sure to tell our server how delicious everything was. He made a recommendation that we check out the owners other restaurants as well, which is how we found out about Cocello. We'd already discussed the idea of Italian food for our last night in Chicago, so choosing Cocello was a no-brainer. Back home a few days later, we are all still raving about it.  I ordered the egg yolk raviolo to start and it lived up to the hype. It was spectacular. Egg yolk, delicate pasta, creamy ricotta and brown butter. You cannot go there without trying this dish. But maybe share it with another person if you order it as a starter as it is incredibly rich.  I also indulged in the short rib which was to die for. Perfectly cooked, it just fell apart and melted in my mouth. The Marsala sauce was the richest I've ever tasted and the vegetables that accompanied it were tender and fresh. The portion was large, although if I hadn't ordered the raviolo, I might have been able to finish it.  Service was excellent and the ambiance is very laid back. We arrived with 5 people, as opposed to the 4 I'd put for my reservation, but the host was gracious and accommodating despite the last-minute change.  Our server knew the menu inside and out and made excellent recommendations.  One other item to note is the fennel focaccia. Be careful not to fill up on it, but that will be a challenge because it is amazing bread! So soft and fluffy on the inside, with a crispy crust.

Our server came over and took our drink orders. One friends drink came right away, the other's.....well, we waited, and waited, but it finally appeared. You would think that after us waiting all that time (and having menus that whole time), our server would have asked if we were ready to order when she finally delivered the drink-- but, no, she immediately turned and ran off. Ok fine, she eventually reappeared, and we placed our entire order at that time and asked for some bread. The first course came fairly quickly, as did the bread, and were great. We ordered the burrata and the artichoke, and both were fantastic. So, we finish that course, and are sitting around talking......no food comes for a while, but we are having lovely conservation and don't care. Our waitress appears and apologizes for the wait on our next course, which we weren't expecting, because it hadn't seemed that long and we hadn't complained. Another server drops off our second course, and includes a second pasta dish-- on the house, she says-- which we presume is for the wait. OK, that's very nice of them, and the orecchiette (which we hadn't ordered) and raviolo were both AMAZING! so delicious and beautifully presented. Great dishes, which we eat up quickly. The other servers come and clean up the table and give us new plates, and.......we wait. and wait. My girfriends' drinks are gone, but our server is nowhere to be found. By now it is like 8:45, and we are still waiting for our next course. So it finally arrives-- we split the salmon, which was fantastic (although-- ""herb salad"" is a pile of parsley.....really?) and our other friend got the spaghetti and meatballs-- which was huge and she really liked, and we shared a side of kale, which was also good. Great food, and we are stuffed. Our our server comes over and gives us the dessert menu to look at-- we are all too full. But then she disappears for 10 minutes. When she comes back, we ask for the check.....and she disappears again for 10 minutes. We finally ask the hostess for our check, which she brings over, and the ""on the house"" dish, is on the bill......so now we have to wait for our server to reappear, and show her the error, which she promises to fix.....and then disappears again for 10 minutes......and this keeps happening.....she goes god-knows-where with our credit cards for another 10 minutes before the whole ordeal is over, and we weren't done until about 9:45. The food was amazing, but we were all so frustrated by the service by the end of the night, it left a bad taste in my mouth. I appreciate not being rushed through my meal, but this was too much. So I guess if time is no issue, then this is a fine place to go, but given the price, I really expected better service.

You're probably wondering why I only gave it 3 stars if it was absolutely delicious and I can answer that in one word: the service. My friend and I had reservations for 8:15. We grabbed a drink at the bar and at about 8:40 we looked around wondering why we hadn't been seated. There were quite a few empty tables. We nudged the host and he seated us. We got our starter order in fairly quickly but sat there for about 15 minutes with empty drinks before our waitress took the orders for our main courses and second round of drinks. It was truly unacceptable for a restaurant at this level and I was really disappointed.  Now. Onto the good stuff. The food which is holy cow AMAZING. We started out with the artichokes and the burrata. Let me start by saying do not coming here without getting the artichokes. They are perfectly cooked, unbelievably flavorful, and all around awesome. The burrata was also very good and came with some of the best tomatoes I've had all summer. I generally like some bread with my burrata so we requested some and were given some amazing rye bread with some crazy good butter. The only thing I'll say is that rye bread and burrata do not mix. Keep your bread with your butter and your tomatoes with your burrata at Cocello. It's also worth noting that their starters come in really large portions and are great for sharing.  We each decided to go with a pasta for our main course and then split a side of the kale. The kale was unbelievable. The roast chicken that's a hallmark of the Sodikoff establishments has an amazing gravy that comes with it that is incorporated into their kale along with some bacon and it is a crazy good combination. It almost made me wish I'd ordered the roast chicken until I tried the orechiette I ordered for my meal.  The orechiette was perfectly cooked and was served with a spicy fennel sausage and kale. It was yet another amazing flavor combination and I cannot say how much I loved the spiciness of the sausage combined with the rest of the dish. It was a great way to end the meal. My friend ordered the egg yolk ravioli which seems to be one of their hallmark dishes and loved it. It is worth noting that the pasta servings are a little smaller than the appetizers, but I felt it was plenty and I was content with my portion. All in all I hope to come back to Cocello but I hope the service is much better next time around.

2014-08-07,3.0,"Oh Cocello.  I wanted to love you.  But my experience this past Tuesday night left me feeling just a bit flat.  My friend and I had no problems being seated for our 8:00 reservation as the restaurant was relatively empty.  The atmosphere is very classy - kind of a dark and relaxed vibe with a pretty hopping patio. We were greeted by our server and asked for her opinions on cocktails before placing our orders: I went with an old fashioned and my friend chose the Cocello punch.  I very rarely comment on service and very very rarely deduct stars due to service, but I have to say our experience was definitely dampened by the mediocre service and really long waiting periods.  When asking for opinions on cocktails and food items, our server basically did nothing but just recite whatever the ingredients the menu listed.  She was unable to offer any comments on the flavor of the food or recommendations on various dishes.  And that's fine...after all, that's what yelp is for.  But it was the long periods of absences on a relatively slow night that were most frustrating. It took nearly 20 minutes before our server returned with our drinks and then before we had a chance to order our food, she plopped the drinks down and disappeared.  The old fashioned was excellent - not too sweet, not too strong, just perfect.  The Cocello punch was very unique - a bit tart and a bit sweet with a smooth white rum.  Highly recommend for a warm day. After another 10 minutes or so (after making eye contact multiple times while she wandered by) we flagged her down to take our order.  Again, there was no helpful advice when we were debating between items, other than just reciting the menu descriptions.  Since we were pretty much starving by this point, we asked for bread (noticing that everyone else had already gotten bread upon being seated) and a gentleman did bring that out just a couple minutes later.  The bread is excellent - fennel seeds give it a great flavor and it's just warm enough. We decided to share a few plates and picked the salmon tartare, shaved broccoli salad, eggplant agrodolce, pasta pomodoro, and cacio e pepe.  The salmon tartare and shaved broccoli came out pretty quickly.  But then there was another 15-20 minutes of nothing.  Then the eggplant dish arrived.  But then another 20 minutes passed and we sat awkwardly waiting.  Since the dishes are served by other people, we had not seen our server in about 30-40 minutes.  She finally came by to check on us and I asked for a couple serving spoons (so we wouldn't have to keep using our own silverware to serve items).  I got a very nasty glare for this request but she came back with 2 spoons.  The last two pastas finally arrived and our server arrived with a smirk and a platter of serving spoons for me to choose from to make some sort of statement.  The food itself was pretty great overall: Salmon tartare - probably the most disappointing item.  The salmon freshness was average and it was flavored very bland.  Don't recommend. Shave Broccoli Salad - one of my favorite items.  My friend found the dressing too tart, but if you like a bit of lemon flavor to your greens you'll love this.  Very fresh ingredients, a medley of flavors, and just overall fantastic.  Highly recommend. Eggplant Agrodolce - a very good item. The raisins were a nice contrasting sweetness and the pine nuts added a great crunch. Recommend. Cacio e Pepe - the black pepper pasta.  A little more bland than I was expecting.  I had anticipated more of a pepper flavor. The pecorino was great, and the pasta was fresh and cooked to perfection.  Recommend. Pasta Pomodoro - my favorite dish of the night. Simple but delicious and full of flavor.  Very fresh tomatoes, perfect angel hair noodles.  Highly recommend. Portions are pretty large for the price and I was easily full after the first 3 items (and we left more than half the tartare).  For 2 people, I'd say 4 small items will be plenty. I'd like to come back and try a few other dishes and give the service another try.  Given how awesome the other restaurants are in this family, I have to assume this was a one-time deal and not the norm.",0.9993,0.731,0.218,0.051,0.5725268558601891

We had Polenta Fritta and Salmon Tartare as the appetizer. The salmon tartare is fine but I would say that the Polenta Fritta is soooo good with truffles! The egg was poached to perfection that the yolk flows out on the plates and melts into the polenta. For Entree we had scallops and egg yolk ravioli! They are both very delicious.  The Tiramisu is a must try for dessert! I would say that their food portion was small compared to other restaurant but the pricing for those menu items makes sense tho.

There's plenty of good people watching, but the traffic on that part of Hubbard isn't crazy.  Everything is small plates to share, and they suggest 4-6 dishes for dinner for two people.

The pasta was so fresh and perfectly cooked. I'm salivating writing this review, and I literally just finished eating and am stuffed to the gills.  For dessert we had the panna cotta, and it was so creamy and delicious with a lovely vanilla scent to it.

The atmosphere is relaxing and comfortable, the cocktails are impeccably made and completely delicious. Fresh house-made fennel bread starts your meal on the right foot (and soaks up some of the alcohol from pre-dinner drinks). The grilled octopus starter is probably the best octopus I've had anywhere in the city. The braised pork shank was enormous- rich, flavorful and fell cleanly away from the bone, just like it should.

I started with the abano smash (luxardo abano, gingerbeer, mint, lemon) and the drink was reasonably good and refreshing.  We shared the polenta fritta, and it kind of tasted like French toast which is not a bad thing.  The ricotta gnocchi, on the other hand, was a big letdown.  When I eat gnocchi, I expect it to be light and pillow-y.  In this case, the ricotta weighed it down and made the dish feel heavy without adding anything beneficial to the flavor profile.  The porchetta was good, and I enjoyed it though perhaps not as much as a similar dish that I ate at Bite Café.  When my friend ordered the bay scallops, the waiter subtly suggested that she add a side dish.  That's because the portion size was extremely small - just an FYI.

Perhaps he's opened so many restaurants, there no longer remains any good help left in the city. While I've normally gotten great service at his other places, here the bartenders were surly, and the waitress was distracted and cold. The host was fine, except we had to wait 30 minutes for our 8:30 reservation on a Tuesday night. Which I would understand if it was a busy Friday night, but the restaurant was half empty. Why are we waiting again?  The fennel bread and butter was very good, and the cocktails were great, but otherwise, the food was also a little disappointing. The pastas were fine, but nothing I couldn't get at a million other Italian restaurants. The beef carpapccio was also fine, but extremely overpriced at $17 for a very small portion of thinly sliced beef. The porchetta was good, but tasted almost identical to the lamb dish I had at Bavette's a few weeks ago -- and that's because it had the same demi-glace, the same rosemary, the same presentation, and the same roasted garlic cloves.

2014-06-07,5.0,"I visited Cocello with a few friends for an intimate guys birthday dinner and was extremely pleased by everything from the moment I walked in. We had a group of 5 so we were seated at a beautiful half circle old style booth. If you've ever visited Bavette's down the street, this place carries the same level of attention to detail in making the experience thoroughly authentic, very effectively turning dinner at just another cool spot to a scene to be remembered. The restaurant has an awesome old time speakeasy style fashion to it that I really loved. There's tons of these places popping up in Chicago but I have to say Mr. Brendan Sodikoff, you are the master! I didn't think Bavette's could be beat but it makes sense that a place that meets that level of thematic mastery was born from the same purveyor! When I called to reserve a table, the waitress was super energetic and I got a great vibe about the place right away! That same enthusiasm carried throughout the meal with our servers checking on us just the right amount of times with a smile on their faces and an investment in our contentment. Even the busboys were great, they promptly replaced our starter plates and silverware with care. A big pat on the back to the house on the service! First, we jumped straight into drinks with myself and a friend who appreciates great whiskeys both ordering old fashioneds. The old fashioneds and other drinks came out and I have to say it's one of the best, hands down, in the city! It was somehow different, almost had some sort of carbonated texture to it or something I can't describe but it was perfectly balanced and a pleasure to drink! We then shared orders of the Arrosto di Polpo (octopus) and the Polenta Fritta. Since last year I've fallen in love with octopus, and this just made me fall deeper. It comes out in small pieces that are slightly charred and a little salty/tangy, really good! It came with something that looked and felt like okra but I believe it was a caper of some sort, it was pickled and a great pairing with the octopus. The polenta had a poached egg on top, which I being the birthday boy, ceremoniously proceeded to carve into to release the yolk over a brick of polenta. It was a nice creamy dish that was easy to share and enjoyed by all of us. For the main course, I had my eye on the Orecchiette which had come recommended by a friend who had dined there the prior evening. The dish consists of little clam shaped pasta shells and some kale covering an accompaniment of a delicious fennel sausage, which I really enjoyed because it seemed to have a variety of texture with some pieces being straightforwardly savory and some adding accent with a little crunch and char. Additionally, a friend adding a ""Spring Vegetables"" salad. I'm not normally huge on salad with dinner or as a side, but this salad was amazing and I highly recommend if you're like me just ignore your brain and order it! When you dig  into this pleasant surprise, you find it bursting with upbeat fresh spring type flavor from the fava beans and peas, and then it's taken to another level when the ricotta finishes the taste with a nice creaminess. After we wrapped up, my friends pulled a fast one and had them bring out a little birthday dessert with a candle in it. The desert was in an almost milkshake type cup that we shared out of. It was rich and delicious and the thing I loved most about it was the expresso/coffee component of it, well done!

We got the orecchiette and scallops (with a polenta side) for the main courses. We ended up waiting a very long time for these dishes. Our server was very nice about checking in and we were given an eggplant starter for free (we did not ask for it--it was just brought out). It was a nice gesture, and the restaurant didn't have to do anything for us so they obviously care about service (although we had already gotten so much food that we would have appreciated it much more if one of the dishes that was late was comped instead of us getting more food we couldn't finish).

I actually didn't mind as I ordered the Toronto (which I had before), which is whiskey, fernet, with a bit of sugar (demerara, to be exact) to ""balance"" it.  I find it hard to believe that a bit of sugar can balance out two hard liquors, but hey it worked. It was great. The bread was awesome. I hate to mention bread, but really it deserves it's own Brodikoff concept. I have high hopes for his pizza place with the way he works magic on dough and water.  Seriously, you may regret filling up on bread, but I didn't! Since it's small plates, we had some pastas along with beef and fish from the main menu, or ""pesce y carne"".  The linguine with clams was the table's favorite.

The bread basket is a loaf of bread, so be careful not to overeat. We were recommended 3-5 dishes to order for the 'sharing' menu but my husband and I don't ever overfill on dinner so he ordered a pasta dish and i ordered the chicken.

The real reason for this mediocre review and why I might not go back, is here because of the staff.  The hostesses were really rude to our friends and our waiter was too aloof to really notice us.  Everyone was pretty snooty for working in a quickly turned over restaurant that has competition with a million other new Italian places.  Get over yourself, you weren't full on a Friday night!",0.9698,0.793,0.177,0.03,0.5127525252525253

The evening started well with cocktails in the bar however the atmosphere and service changed when we went to the table.  The water offered was full of chlorine so much so we had to request bottled water. Appetisers were slow to arrive and only one arrived for a table of 4 by the time the last appetiser came the gnocchi was burnt and had to be sent back - at this point there was no apology. The mains arrived seconds after the starter was cleared (too fast) and everything was extremely salty, scallops were tiny $21 for 4 and Luke warm. We addressed our concerns firstly with the waitress who told us next time to request less salt (as if it was our issue) and then secondly with the manager who again did not seem bothered. We eventually ended up with $35 discount which was pointed out to us (as if we should be great full from a $300 bill!)

2014-05-18,2.0,"I live in the neighborhood and have been disappointed on my two attempts to eat at Cocello.  Most recently, I stopped in on a Saturday night, May 17th at about 9:00PM. I was eating solo and realize that a new place with no reservation can be tough.   I didn't have a reservation but was ready to eat at the bar or whatever they had.  As I walked up, all the outdoor seating was open.....open as in empty tables.  It was a cool night but I was fine eating outside.   The gentleman seating people would probably be better served selling t-shirts at the Gap.  He told me it would be a 40 minute wait.  I asked about outside and he said it was still 40 minutes.  I pointed out that the 7 outside tables were completely empty.  He walked away several times trying to figure out how to sit me outside.  Nobody was choosing to eat outside because it was cool.  There were a few empty tables inside, so they weren't filled to capacity. When he finally came back, he tried talking me into eating at the bar, which would be a 30 minute wait.  I explained to him that the task to sit me outside seems to be too difficult for him, and that I'd dine elsewhere.   He thanked me for dining elsewhere.

2014-05-10,4.0,"Another Italian place in River North!? I impulsively stopped by this place alone on the Thursday night of their soft opening (woohoo 40% off). Already had an early dinner, so I wasn't looking to eat a lot. This place was further west than I thought, so location wise it's not as good as the other italian places in Chicago. The ambient was classier than I expected. Romantic dim lighting with a fitting playlist on the background, very Sodikoff-esque. The ambient alone gets this place at least a 3*** in my book.  On to the food, I got the "" black pepper, parmesan, aged pecorino"" pasta. The print point was surprisingly more reasonable than I expected ($11-16ish). Portion was not big, but it's not insultingly small, so it was perfect for my late night snack. How was it? pretty damn good, but not quite orgasmic yet. Got some desserts to go with that, but honestly I don't remember much about it. It was good but I guess not memorable.  Overall, how does this place compare to the other great italian places in river north? they're about the same level. BUT I do like the interior much better than other places though (i.e. davantis, sienna tavern, etc), so I'll give Cocello a slight edge based on the ambient alone.",0.9723,0.771,0.152,0.077,0.45000000000000007

2014-05-03,3.0,"The night started out a bit clumsy with a slight misunderstanding with the hostess. She forgot for a second I was the client. But the evening recovered.  We loved the food at Dilmans and we really like the transformation into this eclectic Italian style bistro. The food at the new Cocello was very good as you would expect from Brendan Sodikoff.  We started at the bar, and the hand cut ice, swirled in the bourbon was a cool twist. A fun and comfortable bar scene.  The restaurant has a cool feel, with old fashioned red leather semi booths and funky furniture all over. I liked the ambiance but felt we should be at a steakhouse by how it felt. Transformation three? The waitstaff was very nice, did a good job, but at times stayed away a bit to long. Good service, but not great. My sea bass was amazing. The quality, preparation, and flavor of the sauce, hollandaise style I believe, all fit perfectly. Others had the pasta dishes and they enjoyed their dishes although the portions being small were filling. One of the group thought that there was a little too much salt. Parmesan cheese was not offered and since we could not get any staff, they just decided to consume without.  The wine list was very good, had a nice cab/sang blend, a 2008. Desert was very good the gelato did not disappoint and the gelato/expresso/choc sauce was a winner. I am undecided if we will go back. I love his restaurants and food, maybe we just caught them on a bad night or it's just a getting the kinks out period.

2014-05-02,4.0,"We came.  We saw.  We ate.  And ate big at that! After their soft opening, we got a table on their first ""real"" night of business.  We arrived on time for our reservation but they were gracious and accommodating when we asked to sit at the bar before being seated as it wasn't that busy yet. They have an interesting drink menu with so many choices it was hard to pick.  But the bartender was great , asking what we liked and then crafting something for each one in our party.  Interesting spin on negronis as well with different alcohols playing a role. We were seated at a round table off to the side that had these comfy, upholstered chairs clustered about.  Let me pause for a moment on the decor as it it one of the things I love about restaurants owned by Brendan Sodikoff (Gilt bar, Bavettes, Maudes, etc) It is warm and cozy with exposed brick walls, dark woods, upholstered chairs which all together added up to the perfect place for a wonderful dinner. The music that was playing was also an interesting mix of old time classics which made you feel as if you had stepped back into time.  Everyone in our party commented on how great the ambiance is, right down to the fireplaces that anchored the room and the large area out front for dining al fresco.. As for ordering- as we do with any new place- we ordered a wide range off the the menu, and while everything was good, some were outstanding! For our first course- we had the citrus salad, the red snapper crudo and the beef carpaccio.  All excellent and beautifully plated. As for our pasta course- they all sounded good but someone had steered me toward the raviolio which was one large ravioli filled with an egg and ricotta cheese with crown butter sauce.  A winner with our table as was the gnocchi with peas and ham.  We also had the risotto which while it sounded amazing with Gorgonzola cheese and bacon, it was a little flat after the other two. For our entrees- we had the osso bucco, the porchetta and the scallops.  Each were quite good although I loved the porchetta which was stuffed pork belly with rosemary and garlic.  The osso bucco was a close runner up as the meat fell off the bone and was so tender and flavorful. I honestly think I left in a food coma as I know I had dessert, but for the life of me I cannot remember what it was, maybe a bread pudding?    One of their 4 flavors of gelato?  Whatever it was- I'm sure it was delicious as was everything we had during our visit. Service was a little off as they are obviously still finding their way as new restaurants often do.  It started off strong, but our server was MIA many times throughout the night when we needed more coffee, water or even just to get the bill. I am sure this will get better as they find their cadence. If you drive- valet parking is available out front for about $14. What a lovely new spot to go and catch up with friends.  Sodikoff has done it again!",0.9993,0.767,0.222,0.011,0.540505539658082

The eggplant was lovely, the artichokes were not what I expected. Others at the table commented that it had a potato-like texture. But otherwise it was enjoyable - crispy on the outside and soft inside. Risotto was nice & rich and linguini was very light & refreshing. My orecchiette were very undercooked, but the sauce was decent. The donuts were delightfully light & fluffy, and I'd happily order them again (even though I don't like donuts).

We also ordered the beef carpaccio, linguini & clams, bay scallops, and bistecca di manzo.  The beef carpaccio was flavorful and light.  However, I would not recommend the linguini & clams as it didn't have flavor and we couldn't find the clams! Also, we would have liked bread to dip in the clam sauce to get some of the flavor.  The scallops were a little salty for my liking, but the steak was done perfectly (ordered medium rare) and had a tasty seasoning.   Overall good, cozy experience, but I wouldn't say it knocked my socks off.",0.9678,0.838,0.153,0.01,0.7

(lookin at you Au Cheval and Doughnut Vault)     We visited this place when it was Dillmans, not bad.. but it just seemed to big and not the right fit for a deli/brunch spot. Enter Cocello!  Brilliant idea! The space is more suited to an Italian restaurant.  As this new concept, the place feels warm, cozy, friendly and inviting.  As the old Dillmans it felt big and empty.  The decor , the furniture just work better now. Came in on a Tuesday night about 830pm and it was packed!   Drinks:  Plenty to choose from.  The Rye Negroni was just right.   Food:  i was a bit disappointed when i found out that they had run out of the gnocchi and the polenta fritta.  To be honest, i really didnt want anything else but I ended up settling for the Fettucine, my boyfriend ordered the orecchiette and we shared the braised kale.  Pastas were cooked al dente and full of flavor.  Maybe a little too much flavor (??)  That's just personal preference however, i have a very sensitive palate to salt.  Although we did both agree that the kale was definitely a little too salty.  Both pastas were good but Fettucine trumped the orecchiette.   We wanted to try dessert but unfortunately were short on time. However, from what i saw at other tables they looked delicious!   Bottom line:  Definitely will be back .. must try the gnocchi and a dessert.  If not for the food i'd stop in for a drink.",0.9902,0.76,0.181,0.059,0.5175694919115972

Of those dishes i would return for the Egg Yolk Raviolo (runny egg yolk inside just lovely), Little gem salad (romaine lettuce with lemon and parmesan delishishness), Porcetta (so perfectly crispy on the outside and tender porky fatty moist goodness on the inside) and Crispy Polenta (which had soft boiled egg on top of perfectly crispy light polenta cake ....happiness!!).  These dishes were a stand out.  The others were just ""meh"".  Was disappointed with the fact that they ran out of the Hamachi and Red Snapper crudo by 7pm!
