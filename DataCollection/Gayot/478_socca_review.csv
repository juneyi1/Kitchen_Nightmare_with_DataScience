2013-03-06,4.0,"I came to Socca for their  ""Last Tuesday"" lobster night, where you get a whole Maine lobster for $10! Yes, you read that right. Now, I was a little scared as I had never had a full lobster before. Sure, I've had lobster mac & cheese and lobster this-and-that, that have contained lobster chunks, but I wasn't sure how I would feel about breaking, squeezing and scooping out lobster guts to eat it for dinner. Thankfully, I never had to go through any of that. I asked the waiter at Socca if they could chop it up a bit and they did. To my disappointment, the lobster was just kinda blah and I wasn't too crazy about it. This problem can be due to my lack of experience consuming lobster without being IN something, so this shouldn't really reflect on the restaurant, instead as more of a personal issue. We also got the promme frites that comes with truffle fundue (you'll need to reoder this, I'm sure of it) and ate it all up. We had a couple drinks and enjoyed the outdoor seating on a warm night.  The restaurant is normally a little pricey for mostly meat dishes I don't eat (I'm a pescatarian) and since (I know now) I'm not a huge whole lobster fan, I don't think I'll be going back. Again, this is more of my personal issue with lobster than the establishment itself. I was seated promptly (with reservations made through opentable) and the waiter was really accommodating to my weird requests.

2012-08-16,5.0,"I have been dining at Socca at least three times per month for the past several months, so I figured it was time to update my review. Chicago is a mecca for great restaurants  and Socca is one of the hidden gems. IMHO it is the best restaurant in Lakeview and one of the top venues in all of Chicago at it's price point.  There is lots to love about Socca. Chicago has so many outstanding restaurants that great food alone is not enough. From our first time dining here we were thrilled with the friendliness of the staff. Sam (our regular server) is one of the best in the business, the Chef/Owner (Roger Herring) is extremely visible and often mingles with patrons, the bartenders (Paige and Gina) are outstanding and the general manager (Mike) is really nice as well. While we were treated great on our very first visit, Socca has a nice neighborhood vibe and it is such a pleasant and comfortable venue to dine at regularly.  Another amazing aspect of Socca is the diversity of their menu. Their regular menu changes with the seasons which adds both variety as well as enhances the quality of the food by utilizing fresh ingredients. Much of the food is locally sourced. The menu is large enough that there is something for everybody but small enough to be focused. Additionally every night there is often three specials including one featuring house made pasta, an Allen Brother's prime steak and a fish. Even though I have dined here well over a dozen times, I have never repeated an entree as there is so many awesome foods to try! The desserts are delicious here as well. My favorite on the current menu is a deconstructed PB&J featuring croissant bread pudding, grape sorbet as the jelly, peanut butter gelato drizzled with some local honey from Green Acres Farm.    In addition to their regular menu and nightly specials, Socca also offers lots of fun events. On Wednesdays Chef Roger offers a Market Dinner where he has a special three course prix fixe utilizing items he selects that day at the Green City Market (tonight the entree was a sweet corn risotto with large chunks of Maine lobster, heirloom tomatoes and jalapeno bacon;' it was phenomenal) ! Once a month they do a special $10 entree night such as Maine lobsters that they fly in live. On Monday nights you are permitted to BYOB for no corkage. Weeknights at the bar you can enjoy $5 pizettes from 5pm-7pm and these are outstanding! I love the one that has spigarello, bacon and truffled Parmesan cheese. The food is always perfectly prepared, portions are generous, nice accompaniments and service is consistently friendly and attentive.  Socca also has a great ambiance. It is both elegant and relaxed. It is very versatile in that you can have a romantic date night here, dinner with a group of friends or simply opt to have a great dinner on the spur of the moment. There is a nice little outdoor patio for the evenings where the Chicago weather cooperates and large windows for nice people watching if you dine indoors. The bar area is very comfortable if you just want some cocktails and bites, or you can order off the full menu there as well if you are in the mood for a more casual meal. I highly recommend Socca; we have brought numerous friends and family members here with a broad range of culinary tastes (including a very picky mother-in-law) and everybody has raved about their experience. Socca truly deserves Bib Gourmand recognition from Michelin this November! Update: Chef Roger has parted ways with Socca recently; as he was so talented, friendly and such an integral part of Socca (cooking, menu creation, sourcing food, bringing on board quality staff, having fun special events and running the restaurant) this is a huge loss. Hopefully Socca will move on and remain a great venue, but this is no doubt a game changer.",0.9996,0.72,0.264,0.017,0.5436886648150383
2012-08-16,5.0,"I run by Socca a couple times a week on my little 3 mile running route down Aldine to the lakefront. Each time I pass it now, I can't help but think of the great meals I've had there, especially the last time I ate there on June 15, 2012 the night before my wedding.  My wife & I spent countless hours reading through reviews on wedding sites and calling countless restaurants trying to find a place that could: 1. Accommodate up to 85 people that we invited to our rehearsal dinner 2. Serve quality food that could represent the great Chicago food scene. 3. Would let us hang out for a couple of hours on a Friday night in the middle of summer 4. And not cost us more than our Honeymoon.  I'm so grateful we called Socca on a flier, even though we initially thought would be way too expensive based on the quality of what similar places had quoted to us.   We worked with both Michael & Sam setting the event up, and both were prompt in their replies to our emails and professional, yet friendly, in our discussions from beginning to end.  As with most weddings, the wine tasting portion of our experience at Socca was a favorite in the wedding planning process.  I was very pleasantly surprised with the value of their wine selection. The variety and quality we got (for what I thought was a bargain basement drink package price) was outstanding. I think we went through at least a couple of full bottles while we were there, and we were the ones that actually had to cut them off once we found the winners for our selections. We went with a Gavi & Malbec, and our guests loved them both. Along with a nice wine selection, they had some great beers on tap (including Daisy Cutter & Oberon) included in our drink package. With many of my friends being beer snobs from Chicago & Michigan, it made me proud to offer, like, a 'best of' happy summer beers from each region.  About a week after our wine tasting, we brought her family in for dinner to decide on the menu and give their blessing on our selection of venues. We had about a dozen people at dinner that night and they handled the table amazingly well. Glasses stayed full, everyone stayed fed & happy, dishes were cleared, and the interaction by the staff was great for the night. We held the table for a while as we discussed which of the excellent items that night we'd choose for our rehearsal dinner (the decision of if we'd chosen the perfect venue was obvious) and they never balked at our loitering, despite having a pretty good crowd that night. They have great food for those with less adventurous tastes, but also had really good dishes made from some more fun stuff. Eventually, we decided on a menu of: -Funghi Pizzzette (This item wasn't on their menu at the time, but they went above and beyond getting it to us on request since I LOVE it when they do have it) -Fresh Mozz Pizzette -Goat Cheese Pizzette   -Hydro Bibb Salad   -Rabbit Risotto -Tortellini -Hanger Steak w/ Pomme Frites Each of the items was loved by our whole table at the unofficial tasting dinner, and on the actual event date each dish came off flawlessly. The family style portions all had the same quality, excellent preparation, and presentation that you'd expect from any of Chicago's best restaurants on a great date night. For dessert, we initially figured we would go with something boring and safe, like a nice vanilla ice cream. However, the night of our wine tasting, Sam convinced us to have one more thing before we left, which blew us away. The serve a lot of local stuff, including Black Dog Gelato. They had their Caramel Goat-cheese Gelato, and it was amazing. I honestly don't care if our guests liked that one, because it was phenoms to me.  So, the food here is great. The beverages are good and a really good value. What I can't say enough about, though, is the service. They worked like a well oiled machine getting the pizzas out at the right time, moving between courses efficiently without rushing anyone, keeping our unlimited beverages full (with Sam often making sure my drink was full, since I think he noticed I had my share of pre-wedding out of town family stress), discretely keeping me apprised of how we were doing on time when I asked, and setting up the main room so it was perfect for our group.  If anyone is looking for an affordable place for a rehearsal dinner or similar event, I wouldn't hesitate to recommend these guys. At the end of the dinner, when I got the bill (and they quickly and graciously agreed to resolve a small non-negotiated bill discrepancy) I couldn't believe that we had the event we did for the cost they provided it at.

But the restaurant has stayed open and we finally went back a couple of months ago to give it another try.  We had the burrata appetizer, the beet salad, the spigarello flatbread, and the english pea ravioli.  Everything was actually quite tasty - much better than the dog food risotto from years past.  So I'm upgrading my rating to 3 stars because while we haven't forgotten the dog food dish, we are happy that the menu seems to have been revamped.",0.8986,0.871,0.107,0.023,0.43260073260073256

2012-08-06,2.0,"My first and only experience with Socca was last week during their $10 lobster night. They had a limited food menu-- just lobster for the entree and a list of sides. This was why I left feeling underfed and underwhelmed. Lobster in itself is a paltry entree. You'd have to get 2 for there to be a substantial amount to eat. We ordered 5 sides for 6 people. We originally planned on ordering more, but based on the waiter's comment that 4 should be enough because the sides are large, we held back. Maybe we are a group of heifers, because the sides were way too small to share and we all left wanting more food. The bill for our food (and each person got a beer or wine) came out to be $30 per person. Meh. For less than $30, I could have gotten AYCE sushi at Sushi Para. The food tasted ok at Socca. The ravioli was good, but there were 3 pieces for  $12. Frites were also good. Everything else was average and below average (mashed potatoes, Socca, clams). If Socca had allowed me to order a regular entree, I could have gotten something more filling and order a lobster as an addition to that dish. I think that would have improved my experience. But the entree was barely anything, the sides were small, and I ended up stopping by a taco place two blocks from home.  Service was fine, considering it was a busy night. Ambience is nice, so I guess that's what you're paying for.",0.9631,0.872,0.1,0.028,0.387116089039166

2012-07-12,2.0,"There are times when your expectations are driven by critics and you just expect be romanced by the flavor and texture of the food. When the experience is less than completely elating, you feel deflated. This was the case with Socca. The meal was by no means terrible, but aspects of the food and service were deflating.  I chose Socca due to a review given by Art Smith. Art stated that the shrimp pizzette was ""the best thing he has ever eaten"". The atmosphere was pleasant overall. Distressed bureaus set against brick walls. Antique kitchen supplies paired with sophomoric paintings. I wasn't expecting the Seagram Mural Project, but something a little more developed- of course, if the food was excellent, they could have a Damien Hirst next to me, and I would be transported all the same.  Upon first glance of the menu, I was a bit disappointed. I noticed Socca became a victim to a trend: the overuse of truffles and bacon. I found truffles, when overused on a menu, is there for pretention. Bacon in excess is there to serve some pseudo-culinary rebelliousness. Bacon if used as a spice occasionally can enhance flavors. If added to tiramisu - it is just obnoxious, and is present for a reaction. I ordered the tasting menu. I asked to replace the bacon pizzette with the shrimp pizzette. The kitchen was parsimonious with shrimp, but the pizzette was tasty. It wasn't the ""best thing I have ever eaten""; however, they simply replaced the bacon with shrimp so the illustrious pizzette I was after wasn't in the cards.  The restaurant wasn't busy at all, so I'm convinced the kitchen and wait-staff were locked into an intriguing game of Mahjong; the waiter was nowhere to be found, and second course took a while to be presented. I'm used to European dining, but this was beyond relaxed dining. After finishing Atlas Strugged, the second course arrived. One of the guests with me was presented with a steak covered in bacon - which wasn't disclosed in the description of the meal. We should have assumed bacon would be in the dish as it was in the tap water, floor boards, cocktails and woven into the napkins as post-consumer fiber.  My second course was a fish similar to a red snapper, and an arugula salad with raw onions, and cherry tomatoes. The salad was excellent - even for someone that avoids raw onions as they tend to overpower dishes. The fish was littered with bones. When I complained, the waiter stated that they fillet the fish in house. I wasn't sure what to do with that comment. If I built a deck for someone, it collapsed and they complained my first response wouldn't be ""Well, I built it with my hammer."" The pieces around the bones were good.  The dessert was a peach gelato with berries. This was quite good. The gelato had just a hint of peach and the bottom of the ramekin was filled with a berry sauce.  As I stated with the intro, not a terrible meal, but my experience may have been a result of a bad night in the kitchen and on the floor.",0.6731,0.839,0.079,0.082,0.3966851270422699

What was interesting was that all of our food came out at room temperature or right below and yet the restaurant had about 15 people there. So specifically, my friend and I ordered, keep in mind everything came with potatoes:  (1) Grilled Shrimp & Grits: This was a somewhat bland dish. The grilled chicken had some sort of sauce on it, but all I could taste was the ""blackened"" (re: burnt) parts of the shrimp and it was a tad overdone. The jalapeno grits were just that. Grits that had bits of jalapenos with it. (2) Chicken Socca Hash: This was somewhat of a bummer as well. It was like potatoes mixed with a bit of chicken, eggs your way on the side. I wanted this dish to be soo much more than what it was.. but unfortunately, it was a let down. (3) Berries & cream socca toast: Now the toast was actually pretty tasty. It is not toast per se. It's a croissant filled with marscapone and ricotta topped with berries. This was a perfect dish to SPLIT. It would have been to rich for one person to order. Considering the less than glam experience, we mimosa'd up.. so that's always good for brunch. Not sure the standalone cost of this option. Service was decent.

Socca doesn't seem to be super busy during the brunching hours.  Good to know there's a spot with amazing food where you won't have to wait for a table.  I like having these restaurants in my back pocket for emergent situations. After our party was seated, we were offered coffee and beverages.  They weren't served to us very quickly.  This is where Socca loses that 1/2 star.  I'm a firm believer that brunch service requires IMMEDIATE coffee and my cup must be kept full at all times, water and some kind of alcohol.  I want it fast, too.  Most brunchers haven't had their coffee or are in dire need of a hair of the dog.  Sometimes both.  In order to have a great brunch experience, beverages need to be served with the utmost priority. //end rant.// Aside from the initial beverage misstep, everything else was fantastic.  I was wavering between the brunch burger (sinful) and the mushroom and spinach hash with no hollandaise sauce (not sinful).  I even asked our server if the burger was as awesome as I thought it would be and he said yes.  But alas my pants are fitting better these days and I want to continue in that direction so I went with the veggie hash.   Actually, without the hollandaise sauce, it's really more of just a scramble and I'm good with that.  The mushrooms were nice and thick and the flavor of the eggs were great.  I was very satisfied with my order.  Someone else at our table got that breakfast burger, though, and it looked AMAZING.  I'd be lying if I didn't admit to a heavy case of food envy, but in the end I felt a lot better eating on the lighter side.

I haven't been to Mia Francesca in a while either, but because both serve Italian, I think it's fair to make a few comparisons. Beyond being pricier, Socca also has a fancier menu, better-spaced tables, and a less hectic seating system. (Sidenote: Come to think of it, I have not been back to Mia Francesca since three years ago when I waited more than half an hour for my reservation). As an example of its more upscale fare, I had the day's special lobster ravioli, Aaron had a paparadelle with bolognese sauce, and we shared the shrimp pizzette, which I can only describe as a small, flatbread-style pizza. I thought the pizzette and paparadelle were delicious. The shrimp, while small, were juicy and were nicely complemented by the chiles and cherry tomatoes. The paparadelle was soft and airy, and the bolognese sauce slightly sweet. But, the cream sauce that accompanied the lobster ravioli I felt was a little salty, and diminished the dish. This dish was also a bit smaller than the other entrees, and as someone with a big appetite, this alone made me regret ordering this.

Risotto was a complete disappointment (should have gotten a burger!) - I think this dish should be worked on from presentation to flavors and textures.  Bread pudding was yum!

2012-02-15,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went to Socca last night for dinner and the food was excellent. The place was very crowded for Valentines Day, but the tables were spaced out well and it wasn't too loud. There was a huge painting of a Cub (for the Cubs) behind us, which was kinda cool. In terms of the food, we had the following: Goat Cheese Pizza- I saw their pizza on the Food Network, so I figured it would probably be good, which it was. The crust was crispy enough, and there was a good amount of pesto and goat cheese in each bite. Socca Burger- I always compare burgers I have to Kuma's Corner, which is probably unfair, but I thought this burger was really well done. The combination of ingredients went well together, and the pomme frites kicked ass. Braised Short Rib- My girlfriend got this dish, and I wish I did. It was by far one of the better short rib dishes I've tasted. Cooked perfectly and went well with the cabbage and broussel sprouts. They also gave us a $15 gift card for dining there on V-Day, which was very nice of them. The waiter (I forgot his name) was really great as well.  I'll definitely be going back soon.",0.9942,0.727,0.238,0.036,0.5803030303030303

2012-02-12,3.0,"My sweet husband planned an early surprise Valentine's dinner for me!  I was thrilled.  The standout for sure here was the short rib grilled cheese...four cheeses with house pickles, horseradish cream.  Holy crap.  Actually, I give that 5 stars.  The bread is fresh and tender, maybe even a tad sweet.  Toasted, nice portion of short ribs and cheeses.... um, um, good. Their homemade pickles were an excellent accompaniment to the app.  Next we shared the arugula salad with apple, pear, crispy goat cheese, candied walnuts and a vinaigrette -- oh wait, the walnuts were not candied and the dressing was bland, as actually was the salad.  Snooze-ola.  The cheese was deep fried and served in small balls on the side.  Meh.  I need either better flavor or more creative ingredients.  I chose the gnocchi as my entree which came with pulled chicken, butternut squash, parmesan, fig, sage brownp butter .  The pasta is advertised as being made fresh daily.  I was disappointed.  The gnocchi was also pan-fried, which to me, made it slightly over-cooked.  I like my gnocci melt in your mouth.  The best part of the dish was the fig.  Nice perk up to the dish.  Chicken was overcooked.  I actually thought the butternut squash was going to be incorporated into the gnocchi but it was not.  It was in small squares in the dish.  Overall the dish was average and nothing I would recommend.  My husband had the pappardelle with a bolognese sauce.  He loved it.  They  also have pizzettes - wood fire pizzas which seem to be pretty popular.  We ended the evening by splitting the chocolate hazelnut crostada wtih espresso icecream, drizzled with chocolate sauce.  Of course we ate every bite, as it was rich, dense and chocolatey.  The chocolate and crust was ok but the best part of the dessert was the expresso ice cream or maybe it was gelato.",0.9917,0.8,0.168,0.031,0.5458689458689459
2012-02-02,5.0,"If I had only one word to describe the cuisine at Socca it would simply be, ""DELICIOUS"" above many more compliments and adjectives.  Although, with all honesty I'm the type of person who doesn't get flattered to eat mixed cuisines, for Socca mixes Italian and French influenced tastes.  I believe that what makes a restaurant's essence in food is their focus on their specific cuisine.  That being said my husband and I came in hoping for the best and with open minds, since we both enjoy one-type cuisine restaurants. We came in during sinner service around 6-7p.m.   My thought of everything changed to pleasantness from the moment I ordered their one of their salads, (their Chopped Salad)  I'm definitely a salad type of person and this definitely topped off the beginning of my courses; the flavors of the gorgonzola cheese and the cherry tomatoes with a fennel Parmesan vinaigrette above the rest was what sparked the flavors in my palate. Such a mouth watering exquisite salad. As an entree I had the BEST risotto ever!  Their ""Risotto ala Cacciatore"", was the most phenomenal risotto by far. It's a rabbit risotto, though it tastes just like chicken,(seriously does).  I've had plenty at other Italian restaurants, but none compares to Socca's risotto. My husband gave me a bite of his Meatball pasta, which was also very tasty.   He too liked it a lot. The presentation of the plate also looked tasty, maybe because their meatballs were the size of baseballs.  Yes, very fulfilling. At last we both had their ""chocolate hazelnut crunch crostata"".  The chocolate was just delightful and not too strong, and the hazelnut was very sturdy and at the same time crunchy; yummy.   It was a great dessert to end such a great entree. I love Socca.  My husband and I keep coming here all the time.  It's not our neighborhood restaurant but it's well worth the 10-15 minute drive.  I recommend it a lot. *** Although, I wish for one of the male server there to straighten his server standards.   Other than that, it's always a pleasure to come in with my husband.  We love the ambiance, the food.  It's such a great place to come in with your special someone. :) The complete essence is great.",0.9982,0.766,0.222,0.012,0.4760317460317462

We had made reservations weeks before for a larger group, because we added 2 to our party they split our tables. We understood why but unfortunately the tables were barely by each other. As we were all waiting to just order drinks after 20 minutes we realized that our second table had all their drinks and appetizers. We mention to the host that our server hadnt even come by and he was very casual about it. Then the server came by and told us to hold while he took care of his other table. Finally when he decided it was convenient for him he came to our table. I told him he has our full attention to tell us about specials, and then he STARED us down and walked away!  Since it had been 45 min by this point and not one food order  I asked the host to switch servers  before he truly ruined our night. Eventually the host came by and said he would send help for him. Without one word of apology from the server or management, or even a dessert to say we are sorry for the delay the bill was sent with 20% EXTRA for tip. Even in the finest restaurants they charge 18% for larger parties. Maybe because he thought he was going to make a big tip no matter what the server and restaurant did not care. It is a shame that they would provide such poor service and management.

Your weather has made me miss flight connections, soaked through my unprepared little tuchus with rain storms, and prevented me from bicycling your streets because of frigid hurricane-like winds. And believe me, living in Michigan now, I have not gone soft! You truly are brutal. And this time? You turned a five-hour drive into EIGHT HOURS. My ass is numb. My blood sugar is lower than Cookie Monster in rehab. And my stomach is eating itself. I know, I know. First world problems. Still, for the record, ONE STAR for your weather. Right. So Socca (before I lose myself in the diatribe). Improvisational saving-grace-of-dinner-time. Chosen more for its proximity to our hotel than anything else. Well, and the mention of gnocchi in the reviews.  In these desperate times of hunger pains, the mere word makes me salivate and the decision is made without further discussion. Mmmmm... little potato pillows of perfection. I could drown in my own saliva if I didn't sport rubber duckie floaties around my biceps at all times.  On the gnocchi, Socca came through. Chicken dried out a bit by the end of the meal and the fig pieces were maybe a little too big. But that's why -od made knives. The sauce and the sweet potatoes were amazing. Also had that night's special: grass-fed filet mignon with risotto. Great cut of meat, tender cook. The risotto didn't blow me away. The individual flavors didn't sing. Then the mascarpone cheesecake. Tasty. Not too heavy but creamy - just sweet enough. The touilles were throw-aways though (ouch. I know). Service was great, from the head waiter to the supporting actors. Efficient, helpful, smooth. They got many a' laugh out of me and I love feeling jovial when eating a great meal.  Also, watching little kids slip and slide and fall on the snowy sidewalk made me guffaw. That sounds cruel. I assure you they were having fun.

Socca is absolutely everything I hoped it to be! I went for my fiance and I's 2 year anniversary Sunday night and we were not disappointed! I had the Hanger Steak Frites and he had the 16 oz Bone-In Rib Eye. TO DIE FOR. Even the bread rolls were beyond deelish (although I had hoped they would give us more than one each, but I guess all we had to do was ask!). My Hanger Steak Frites was juicy, tender (about as tender as you can get a hanger steak!), and the pommes frites are quite possibly the best I've tasted in Chicago. His steak (they use Allen Brothers Steaks, which is a MAJOR +) had carmelized onions on top, yukon gold potatoes, and a port red wine reduction sauce. He said it was happiness with every bite. We inhaled the entire meal! Then for dessert we had the blueberry tart. YUM. It was juicy, sweet, and the ricotta gelato tasted like cheesecake, not at all like frozen cheese (which I was scared about!).  Sure it's pricey ($45 for that Rib Eye!!!), but it's so worth it! Especially for the area which is more bar food than fne dining. It's a great casual to fancy spot. We both wore jeans (him in a button down and sneakers, me in wedges and a nice cotton top), and didn't feel out of place one bit.

Our server was so apologetic, and not only did he no-charge the pizza, but he offered me a free dessert.  Which also of course was amazing (the chocolate torte which was somewhere between a fudgey brownie/cake with hazelnuts and fresh ice cream).

Upon paying the bill we put two credit cards in the bill and she took it, didn't bother to ask how the bill was supposed to be done, and split it.   Service can be forgivable. Every place gets a bad server here and there. But the level of disregard for food quality and lack of a functional manager is ridiculous. Brunch here was comically awful.

Yeah, said that too.  You get a beautifully done sunnyside up egg on top also.  I'm blissing out all over again.  They also make a mean burger, on a pretzel roll (my new favorite thing!).   But, perhaps you're wondering, is this a place where I can get $15.00 endless mimosas?  Nope.  But you want your palate to be able to enjoy every layer of flavor that Socca has to offer you.  This is not to say that Socca doesn't offer adult beverages that will satisfy you.  Try their bloody mary, along with the lovely additions of caper, fresh mozzarella, pepperoni, etc. you get a sidecar of beer.  Super refreshing and mellows out the spicy of the bloody.

(I should mention the hostess that day was very nice. I called to make a reservation that day and she was very phone-friendly.) And this place was not busy. I'm talking not even half full.

2011-06-06,3.0,"Thanks to social networking, word-of-mouth, and the abundance of deal sites I have subscribed to I am able to hear about great restaurants and never be at a loss for finding a new place to dine out.  After living in or close to Lakeview for almost 5 years and walking this strip numerous times it took a free dinner reservation through  villagevines.com  and their 30% off deal to finally get me into Socca. So for date night, after looking through the list of 25+ restaurants available on the site, we settled on Socca, which, according to my co-worker, ""rivals Mia Francesca and is a great French twist on Italian."" Socca almost never happened, though.  I unknowingly scheduled this reservation on the night of the American Idol finale and, after hearing that Lauren Alaina had laryngitis and may not have been able to sing and Chicagoland-native Haley Reinhart (my favorite) might be taking her place in the finale, we had reservations about going to our reservation.  Lauren got better, Haley was out, and we walked up to the restaurant. We were seated right away by the friendly host and our waitress was at our table shortly thereafter.  I had a glass of the #25 Petit Verdot and the date had the Cabernet #26.  We put in an order of the Pommes Frites and asked for recommendations for the other menu items.  I chose the gnocchi (sans onion) and the date went with the grande polpetta.  A mound of piping hot french fries came out mid-glass of wine and we dug in.  Obviously they were amazing and the truffle cheese fondue was awesome (I could have drank it); I am glad we chose it over the baked fontina. The timing was perfect because our entrees arrived just after we finished eating the appetizer.  My gnocchi looked amazing - little yellow balls covered in chicken, peas, goat cheese, butter, and crispy little prosciutto bites from the heavens.  It tasted just as delicious as it looked!  However, as a big eater, I will say that the overall meal itself was not nearly as large as what you would expect from a comparable restaurant.  I was easily able to finish my entire meal and secretly lusted after the grande polpetta across from me.  This may be the first time in history that I have not taken at least half of my gnocchi (or pasta) dish home with me after dinner out.   We skipped dessert so we could get home quickly, watch Idol on DVR, and start voting away.  I threw my credit card in the book, handed it off to the waitress, and booked it down Clark St.  Had I been paying attention I would have noticed that our VillageVines credit was not on the bill and I ended up footing the entire non-discounted bill.  I guess I should have said something before I left, but my mind was in another place.  Note to self:  go over bill before you indiscriminately throw down your Visa. Socca is definitely a viable candidate because of its great food and atmosphere, but I am not completely sold on it like my co-worker is.  Also, for foodies or people who enjoy doing ""dinner clubs"" but do not have the dedicated group to do so, they have group dinners at a fixed price and (I am assuming) a fixed menu.  Who doesn't love making new friends to eat with?!",0.9912,0.885,0.099,0.016,0.49396038305129203

The space is open and airy with nice large windows but tables are a bit too close to each other.

2011-02-15,3.0,"Rounded up the score to 3 stars. This place would be a solid 3-star if the food tasted as good as it looked. Don't get me wrong, the food is definitely good, but there is always something missing or ""off"" with each dish.  For example, the rib eye with risotto was just a tad too fatty, and the flavor was a bit too filling & empowering...however, the steak was perfectly cooked. Next, the pan-roasted sea scallops - the scallops were perfectly seared, but the combo with a polenta bedding is a bit odd (but acceptable). The thing that got the most points docked is the dessert. The chocolate souffle was hard and tasted like a brownie, the gelato came off more like a yogurt or ice creme.  This place does have a great, quiet atmosphere and a knowledgeable and accommodating staff, so despite the food being just a tad bit off, it's worth visiting again.",0.981,0.752,0.205,0.043,0.4765625

2011-02-15,4.0,"Ahhh, Valentine's Day.  Simple equation: card, flowers, candy, dinner, wine, lover (sometimes present, sometimes not.) Those are the main ingredients that make up a good V-day, IMO.  What could make it better? Rabbit Risotto. Yes, Bunny stew, if you will.  Question: Where? Answer: Socca! By doing simple math, you can assume that I spent my V-day at Socca, ordering and devouring the rabbit risotto. You would be correct with that assumption, but there's more to the equation (mainly parts mentioned before.) The V-day crowd was at high capacity at Socca. Luckily, the beau had mad reservations about 3 days in advance--shocking, I know. A rose was given to each lady of the table as we were seated in a warm and romantic setting that reeked of love...and probably some lust, too. There were a few specials, but the rabbit risotto was quickly pointed out to me (as bunnies are my favorite animal, to pet or to eat apparently.)  We started with the meat and cheese board which was huge. Everything was pretty great, except the one fluffy cheese that had no taste. Absolute fluff. Perhaps it was the fluff from the bunny tail? Who knows. Anyways, my valentine ordered the burger and I eagerly awaited my Risotto alla Cacciatore. It was worth it. It was really creamy and tender and the seasoning was perfect. Tomato and asiago topped it off. I would highly recommend it. As for everything else, there were a few pastas that were nicely priced--think $13-$17 and most dishes ran from $13 for burgers and chicken, to $22-$34 for some meats or fish. There were some good options for appetizers as well as pizettes priced around $9. I would def. hit Socca again for a quiet and romantic night out.

2011-01-26,4.0,"I have been to Socca twice--once a long time ago, once a couple of days ago.  The previous visit, I was with my now-husband and we split a couple of entrees--a pan-roasted salmon dish and another that I think was a frutti di mare with paste.  I say ""I think"" because I don't remember because the salmon was cooked so incredibly perfectly.  It was salmon nirvana, where the skin was perfectly crisp and the meat was medium rare.  I don't even remember what else was in the dish!  Nothing could compare to the salmon.   This time, I went with a good friend on a Monday for their $25 prix fixe--salad, entree or pasta, and dessert.  We both had the spinach and arugula salad with a mini goat cheese souffle.  The salad was good, but oddly missing the arugula!  That was a slight bummer, since we both love that peppery flavor.  But hey, I don't send food back unless it's really bad.  Hate wasting!  The goat cheese souffle was cute and creative, but I think the dish might have worked better with a piece of fried goat cheese or maybe just the plain old crumbled version.  I think the souffle was just lacking a little bit in the texture department.  But still, nothing to really complain about. For my main course I had sea scallops with crispy polenta and baby spinach.  I thought it was really solidly done--the scallops were massive and cooked well, and the polenta really was crispy even beneath the tomato sauce.  As a spinach lover, I enjoyed the fresh baby spinach beneath.  All in all, it was a very satisfying dish.  I would have ordered salmon to see if I could again reach nirvana, but this version included bacon, so I decided against it.   Dessert was next--I decided on the apple tarte tatin, and my friend had the chocolate souffle.  The tarte tatin was a little strange--the apples were more like a puree, rather than pieces.  They tasted good, but it was just unexpected.  The crust was the biggest disappointment because it wasn't crispy.  The dessert must have been reheated since it was a wedge of a bigger tart.  Maybe it would be better baked in individual servings.  The vanilla gelato that accompanied it was delicious. My friend's chocolate souffle was good and very large.  Not the best chocolate souffle I've ever had, but good nonetheless.  It was also served with the tasty vanilla gelato. The service was friendly, though I found it strange that I had to ask the server about the prix fixe deal, as it wasn't listed anywhere and he didn't mention it the first couple of times he came to our table.  But that wouldn't stop me from coming back. This is a nice, intimate place for well-done food, maybe a nice glass of wine, and good company.  It's not life-altering, but it's comfortable and a great neighborhood place.",0.9982,0.742,0.208,0.05,0.5440709617180206

2010-12-13,4.0,"Socca was an easy choice for dinner, in large part for its proximity to the Underground Lounge, where we had tickets to see a show. The fact that the food is great was an added bonus. We were here on Saturday night and despite a somewhat rushed experience, we thoroughly enjoyed ourselves. We each started with a glass of Malbec in the bar before we sat in the dining room. The bar area is cozy and separated from the dining room. We sat in the window and got to people watch. Apparently, there was a pub crawl in W'Ville called TBOX and it was quite a spectacle watching drunk twenty-somethings in ""Cat in the Hat"" striped socks and flannel onesies stumbling around. We had a hard time tearing ourselves away from the ensuing hilarity but moved to the dining room for dinner. The dining room is beautiful, and fairly large, but it was still cozy and inviting. We sat against the back wall facing the dining room; it was a perfect table as we were able to carry on a conversation without having to shout at each other to be heard. The appetizers all sounded delicious; we chose to share the escargot, which had a little too much Pernod, but otherwise it was really good. The snails were not at all chewy and the whole thing was topped with puff pastry, which I've never seen on escargot before. For our entreés, we had the double-cut pork chop and crispy chicken marsala. The pork chop was one of the biggest I've seen, and could easily feed two people. It was topped with a bacon-thyme sugo and served with sauteed spinach and a mustard potato cake. The potato cake was more like a croquette and I detected no mustard, but it was tasty nonetheless. The bacon-thyme sugo added a lot of flavor to the pork, which was nice and juicy and not at all overcooked. I've only had chicken marsala that was pan sautéed, and this was more like a chicken milanese, so it made it a little more unique than garden variety chicken marsala. It was served with mushrooms, but it was a little light on the marsala flavor. Still a very good dish though. Our server did a great job of pacing everything so we could make our show. Sadly, we didn't have enough time to try dessert, but I've got my eye on the bread pudding that's been raved about, so I'll definitely go back and get that, as well as some of the other items that we didn't get to try.",0.9957,0.84,0.14,0.02,0.6617619047619048

He asked it to be prepared/cooked according to the chef's preference, which was medium rare, but when he started to cut into the chop I noticed he was sawing A LOT to get through the piece of meat. We both looked at each other perplexed and thought maybe it was just the end piece since the chop was so thick. He cut through the middle and it was cooked all the way through and very dry. Our waitress was phenomenal and admitted that they had been having a problem with cooking the meat properly and offered to get him something else off the menu. He agreed and ordered the special, which was a sea bass, with fresh pasta, clams and scallops. This meal was considerably smaller than his last meal, but was definitely very good.

2010-10-06,4.0,"Came to Socca for the first time last night for a special 5 course dinner paired with beer from Half Acre. We started out with a pizzzette reception paired with the Gossamer. I tried a few different pizzettes: the sausage & mushroom, goat cheese & roasted tomatoes and also the prosciutto & arugula. All were fantastic and the crust was especially good, SO crispy and light. I really wanted to try the shrimp one I saw on ""Best Thing I Ever Ate"" but unfortunately, they didn't bring that out. Also once we were seated they brought out a caesar salad pizzette. Guess caesear dressing is another one of those things that's good on everything! The 1st course was a fried oyster arugula salad: the oyster was HUGE. Maybe a delicious mutant of the sea? The second course  was a large squash ravioli with sausage and bacon on top in a very savory and delicious sauce. That was paired with the Bairn ale which will NEVER be made again! The third course was what I was looking forward to the most but actually the only disappointing dish. Braised short ribs w/ veggies over polenta. The short ribs were overcooked and kind of stringy. The polenta seemed like it was sitting out for too long so it got kind of hard and plastic-like. And for dessert...probably the best desert I've ever enjoyed!  A super warm and gooey brownie on top of fresh caramel with some sea salt and a crunchy wafer! Ii wish I wasn't so full so I could've finished eating the whole thing but there was just soo much good food! Overall the event was planned very well. They had 3 half acre employees sitting amongst the guests and could answer all questions. I got to try some beers that they will never make again but I really hope they'll reconsider. I'd definitely go back to Socca and visit for a regular dinner. The service was great as was the quality an dquantity of the food!",0.9972,0.762,0.213,0.025,0.4812465902891436

2010-09-18,3.0,"We took our family to Socca, at the request of my daughter who had a performance and had to leave at 9:15.  We arrived at 7:45 and the valet parked our SUV. Thank God for that because the whole area was crowded for the Dave Matthews concert at Wrigley Field and there were people and traffic EVERYWHERE.  We had a reservation for five (which helped because we had a nice round table by the window.) We sat for twenty minutes before the waiter came, brought us some delicious bread and said he would be back in a minute.  That minute took twenty more minutes.  My daughter's boyfriend went up to the hostess and told her we had to be waited on and be out by 9:15 and it was already after 8:30.   The waiter came over and apologized, that he was also working the outdoor dining.  OKAAAA.  My husband proceeded to order the appetizers, wine and dinner, all at once. The appetizer we ordered were the pomm frites with a cheese, truffel oil dip and it was delicious. However, this may be a little biased for a review because by then, we were starving!   This came within five minutes of ordering, The salads were up to par:  the wedge of lettuce with blue cheese and bacon, the Caesar Salad was also good, but the lettuce was all shredded finely and I am not used to that kind of a Caesar Salad but the dressing was perfect and not over done.  My husband ordered the gorgonzola, walnut and bleu cheese salad with pear and it appeared delicious but nothing out of the ordinary. When dinner arrived (at 9:00!) my girls and I ordered the pizzettes.   Supposedly, ""The Best Thing I Ever Ate"" from Food Network Television had someone rave about the shrimp pizzette, which I had ordered. My daughters ordered the proscuitto pizzette with arugula.  Both were hot and delicious but I could not find the shrimp and it looked nothing like the posted photo on Yelp! with all that cheese.  However, no time to complain, looking at our time frame.  My husband ordered the white fish, which I should have ordered because it looked delicious and he said it was one of the best he has had. (He compared it to better than in Michigan!).  My daughter's boyfriend ordered the special Allan Bros. steak and frites and it was definitely the best meal at the table.  So, there you have it!  No time for dessert, unfortunately, but the Pinot Noir wine from Oregon was wonderful and we ended up ordering two bottles for the table.  We had enough time, anyways! Recommendations:  1)Reservations 2) Go before 7pm or after 9pm. Order one of the desserts.  Weather permitting it had lovely outdoor dining, too. It was very noisy inside.  Nice looking bar area and there were people taking out, too.  I would have rated four stars but the portions were small and the service was below par.  Otherwise, a nice mix of French, Mediterranean bistro feel.  I WILL give it another try soon!",0.9967,0.819,0.143,0.038,0.607983193277311
2010-09-13,4.0,"I first must say that Socca has amongst the best trained staff I've seen. Extremely knowledgeable given the variety of specialty dishes and ample wine selection. They were very attentive through out the meal. The atmosphere is not what you expect of an Italian restaurant. No Frank Sinatra. No goofy, old-world Italian paraphernalia on the walls. This place had a modern and contemporary feel with a large, corner bay window that overlooked Clark and Aldine. For an appetizer, we had the Calamari. This was different because it was boiled, I believe, instead of fried. This was a different approach to calamari than I'm used to, but it was ok.  I had the goat cheese pizza for an entrée, which was very good and priced under $8.00. Not bad for a moderately priced restaurant in Chicago. My wife had the filet mignon. This was the best filet mignon I've ever had. Finding an Italian restaurant with good steaks is a rarity.

Cons: - The food is competent, but not spectacular.  I had the hazelnut crunch crostata dessert, expected to be blown away (I mean--hazelnut crunch!) but felt like I'd had better brownies (see, e.g., Molly's Cupcakes--the brownies there are AMAZING).  There just wasn't much depth of flavor.  I felt the same away about my sausage and mushroom pizzette--I was lured in b/c the Food Network tells me that Art Smith loves the pizzette, but I wasn't super impressed.  Of course, Artie likes the shrimp and I got the sausage, but I thought the crust was just okay, and the flavor was far too blue cheesy.  On the other hand, I had their mussels, and they were quite good and fresh.",0.9875,0.73,0.207,0.063,0.6247619047619047

Between the 4 of us, one ordered the seafood gnocci which had a plethora of scallops, shrimp, and mussels in a spicy sauce. Another had the white fish with potatoes.

We came on a Sunday evening, made reservations but the dining room was relatively empty.  We were seated near a window, which had shades drawn halfway to block out the glaring sun, yet still allowed us to people watch.  Our waiter was exceptional and friendly. The food ... amazing.  We started with the salmon ceviche after salivating over every appetizer on the menu.  It was fantastic, accompanied with bits of jicama, onion and cucumber.   For our main courses, my bf, ordered the shrimp pizza and I opted for the 1 pound meatball (thank you Yelp reviewers for that one).  I LOVED the tomato sauce it came in, lots of chunky bits of tomatoes, light and not overly salty.  The whipped ricotta that came with it completed the taste of the meatball - it was fantastic.  The shrimp pizza ... I'm so glad we caught this episode on Food Network.  The combination of the cheese, tomatoes and shrimp was sheer perfection.  The taste was quite addicting. We finished our meal by sharing a peach dessert.  I don't remember the name but it was like a peach cobbler/tart topped with blueberry coulis and ricotta ice cream.  It was amazing - I've never had ricotta ice cream before and I have to admit, it's one of the best flavors I've ever tasted.  They also have one of the best plain iced teas ever - not sure if it's brewed in house or bought though.  We'll be back many more times to try everything else on the menu.",0.9964,0.766,0.207,0.027,0.6299697656840516

2010-06-27,4.0,"Saturday late afternoon a buddy and I decide it was perfect weather for day drinking. It was around 4:00 pm and we had an impromptu 2 person pub crawl till 7:30 pm reservations at Socca. If you read some of my other reviews you will start to see that drinking is involved in most of them. We kept a good buzz going throughout the day by drinking vodka type cocktails at the 3 or 4 bars visited and even at one place we had a carafe of sangria. Finally we met the rest of our group at the restaurant and was seated immediately. Thank god because all that drinking was making me hungry. As we situate ourselves they bring a plate of these salty crunchy bread buns. Of course anything salty taste really good while drinking so we ask for another plate of them just as soon as the first batch is eaten. Out table of five all agree to go for the shared eating of appetizers and a few dinner options. We get the pommes frites with the truffle cheese fondue, mini veal meatballs, steamed mussels, soprasata pizzette, shrimp pizzette, and a grande polpetta.  The mussels were amazing with the sauce and both of the pizzettes, otherwise known as flat bread pizzas, were great. I especially liked the soprasata with the shredded caesar salad on top. The cheese fondue made those fries otherwise it would have been OK. The veal meatballs were just alright and probably could have done without them. When the grande polpette comes out I was not expecting to see a giant meatball sitting on rigatoni covered in ricotta. I guess I didn't read the menu or else I would have read the description saying one pound meatball. I would recommend getting this just to say that you saw a magic 8-ball sized ball of meat. Despite the humorous size it was rather tasty and delicious. 3 bottles of white wine later and despite all that food we just ate, our group is still hungry so we order more. We go for another giant meatball, one more pizzette, and the gnocchi. I have to say hands down the gnocchi was the best thing I have had in awhile. The spicy tomato brodetto sauce they had in this dish was amazing mixed with shrimp, scallops, and mussels that added even more flavors to the dish. I would tell the restaurant to loose the gnocchi and throw in more mussels because that sauce was too good with those mussels. I will go again just for this dish. As we finish up we are all stuffed so much that dessert is not an option. I look at all the food that was eaten and how much wine we had that I start to think the bill is going to get a double take reaction in a bad way. The bill comes and we do double take not because its high but because it is reasonable to the point we think its incorrect but after tallying everything it matches up.

Food: 4.5/5 I definitely ordered well, because both my appetizer (mussels) and entree (grande polpetta) were delicious. I would also like to brag a bit and mention I did manage to finish the 1lb meatball in the polpetta (I know, I'm a fat pig) but according to the waiter 1/20 people finish it so I felt challenged to do so. Anyway, I digress. The loss of half a point comes at the expense of other diners in my party: the haloumi was too salty and the escargot was soso. Other than those two flaws the food was delicious all around, but 5 stars are reserved for perfection. Wine: 3/5 I blame myself for trusting my Dad to order, so maybe I shouldn't fault Socca but the two different bottles we had were both poor to be perfectly frank. For the types of wine they were (a chianti classico and a rosso de montalcino) and their price I would have expected a bit more and they both were just not good to be frank. Service:5/5 The server was very nice, knowledgeable, friendly, attentive. Really very good. Ambiance: 4/5 I really liked the decor and the feel of this place, but I had to dock them one point for our table.

Our entrees were fabulous.  Rabbit, asiago and tomato risotto for me and the chicken milanese for my hubby.  The risotto was creamy, but not too heavy and the rabbit meat was shredded and did not have a hint of the gamey flavor you can sometimes find.

Its proximity to Mia Francesca and the more expensive prices have led me away in the past. I have to admit, this is a review based on only 1 experience. Therefore I reserve the right to assign this 4 stars specifically to the gnocchi dish and the risotto alla cacciatore (the food was really a 5 stars but I gave 4 due to price and trendy atmosphere - see below).  The restaurant itself is fancy and gives you that trendy vibe that often comes with prices that are $3-8 higher than you thought they'd be. The prices in fact were a little higher than I thought they should be and that is ultimately why I am giving 4 stars instead of 5. The food was GREAT!!! The rabbit risotto was different than any I've had before. It was thinner than other risottos with a tomato base with red pepper. The meat was absolutely melt in your mouth, well braised and plentiful in the dish. SO GOOD!!!!!! The gnocchi was more of the same. It was different: it was pasta with endive, squash in a parmesan sauce that WASN'T cream based and heavy. It was made with reduced chicken stock (we asked) and parmesan which went so well with the chicken already in the dish. So great.

Shared the shrimp pizza and also the goat cheese pizza. The Shrimp pizzette has heirloom tomato sauce, fontina, basil and chili flakes. Good, but the chili flake was strong for those who dont like heat (I do!). Some legit Italians dont mix seafood with cheese, but I thought the shrimp added a nice textural contrast that enhanced the pie. The smell was a little off putting (distinctly like shrimp). It was all I could think about when I would take a bite. Smell is one of our senses for a reason, and this time it didnt work in Socca's favor. Also went with the Basil pesto, mozzarella, parmigiana, goat cheese and roasted peppers pizza. I really love this pizzette! There isnt much to say because this is a classic flavor combination that Socca used to its advantage. I hear pesto and I think YES-to.

The service?  Beyond outstanding.  Constantine was our waiter and knew the menu inside out.  Instead of offering a dull, robotic recital of sound bites written by the marketing department, Constantine offered a deep understanding of the menu and genuine opinions.  A young waiter with an old school approach. Loved it. So why three stars? The food was just 'good'.  Not what I expected after reading so many rave reviews from my fellow Yelpers.  For my entree, I had a filet mignon special wrapped in bacon.  Now I love bacon, and was surprised to find a fatty piece of swine wrapped around the perimeter of my filet which completely underwhelmed me.  When a restaurant falls flat on its entree specials, it loses stars in my book.  The raison d'etre of a restaurant is good food served well.

The prix fixe, which runs Sunday - Tuesday, offers your choice of salad, entree/pasta, and dessert. (Entrees normally run $20-25 each.) The only downside to this deal is that I'm a voracious carnivore. But it's a great way to sample the menu, as there aren't any restrictions besides refraining from ordering specials.    The salads were nothing special - they are just salad, after all - but we were all pleased with our entrees. Amongst the table, the favorite dish by consensus was the gnocchi (fall squash, escarole, chicken, smoked mozzarella, and parmesan sugo). It was amazing. I've had excellent gnocchi at various restaurants in Chicago, but this was the best. Dessert is good.

2009-06-26,4.0,"Socca is right on Clark Street in the busy Lakeview/Wrigleyville neighborhood, so I walk by it all the time, having yet to try it. I finally made it there on a hot Thursday evening. We opted to sit inside but liked having the option to sit outside in the small patio. The interior of this restaurant is exactly what is trendy now... contemporary and clean, yet still cozy. It is an upscale, yet casual, dining experience where you can enjoy a pleasant meal with a group of friends or a nice date. It is also the typical price point for this type of restaurant... about $20 per entree, which is very reasonable for the quality of food you get.  Okay, now onto the food and drink! Socca is Contemporary Italian/French cuisine, which gives many options! For the drinks, we opted to go with red wine flights. We each tried 3 different wines, which were poured very generously. For the appetizer, I had to try the pomme frites. I knew they came with a yummy sauce and they were skinny... so I had to try them! Sadly, I was a tad disappointed. However, I will have qualify that with I am VERY picky when it comes to fries. I really liked their size. The shoestring potatoes are always my fave. I also appreciated how there was chopped up parsley in the seasoning AND that it came with a nice aioli sauce. Now... here was my problem: they were either coated with something or double fried. I don't like any kind of coating on my fries... they were like the Burger King ones, which I cannot stand. Luckily, they were still edible as they were so skinny. But then came my entree: I got the seared sea scallops with a leek broth. AMAZING! There were 3 or 4 huge scallops placed atop polenta with a leek broth. The flavor of the scallops was perfect. It was SO good and so meaty. I thought it was nice eating it with something but I didn't think the polenta was quite right. It was a tad bland and I was trying to decipher what would be a better companion for it. However, since the scallops were so flavorful, really, the polenta pairing wasn't bad. I also tried my boyfriend's entree, which was a special that night of halibut with a side of mixed greens w/bay scallops. The halibut was also prepared perfectly, I will have to say. But the side was just ok... the bay scallops had absolutely no flavor. (But I didn't know if it was more that I had just eaten these wonderfully flavored scallops and then tried the little bay scallops.)   My entree was definitely better! We were so full we didn't even try the dessert, so I cannot comment on that.  As far as the service goes, it was a bit slow. It was busy that night but not totally full. Our waiter was very nice, but seemed a bit flighty. I don't know if he had too many tables on his plate or what but it seemed to take awhile for everything and his mind seemed to be somewhere else. So overall, not the best service but nothing that bad either.  I would definitely recommend going to Socca for a special dinner.

For a main course, I ordered a perfectly prepared salmon with asparagus and a chick pea puree that had a delicious curry hint.  The reisling I ordered was nicely sweet and floral.

2009-04-09,3.0,"French/Italian cuisine?  You had me at hello. The moment I we walked in, I was surprised by the size.  I hadn't imagined such a large dinning area, surrounded by natural light in it's corner location.  I almost felt like the room swallowed us.  I wonder what the room sounds like on a busy evening.  We clearly had beat the dinner rush and were one of only three active tables in a room that clearly held several dozen tables.   First up, the bread.  Yum.  It was perfectly moist and buttery.  In fact, they do not even provide butter on the table unless you request it.   Next, appetizers.  I really enjoyed the shrimp and socca dish.  It was certainly a refreshing break from the standard appetizers.  The chickpea ailoli with arugula and roasted peppers was delicious and paired perfectly with the dish.  We also ordered the calamari but I have a series of odd food phobias -- I don't eat meat still on the bone and/or still resembles what it once looked like alive.  I can do fried calamari if my dear friend whisks away the squiggly bits first.  But the grilled calamari dish they placed before us at Socca was just a little too visual for me so I took a pass. For my entree, I had the gnocchi with asparagus, lemon chicken.  I had prepared for a heavy dish, as gnocchi can sometimes be but was pleasantly surprised to find the dish light. My only complaint was that the asparagus was overpowering.  Otherwise, the portion was perfect for the average appetite. We couldn't pass up an opportunity at the Croissant Bread Pudding -- and were certainly not disappointed.  It was everything we could have wanted out of a dessert.  The portion was idea for splitting, especially after a filling meal.  A perfect conclusion to dinner. By the time we left, the restaurant had filled up a bit more, though there were still several open tables.  There also appeared to be an area where a simple pull of a curtain would provide a private dinning area for a group.  Upon leaving, we stood for a moment in the bar area to catch the end of a March Madness game.  The bar has a different aesthetic than the main dinning area which I found to be a bit odd.  While the restaurant portion's decor was heavily focused on faux finishes and heavy painted canvases, surrounded by natural light from the windows, the bar area was dark and had modern photography and kitsch accents.",0.9929,0.805,0.158,0.037,0.5293727106227105
2009-04-05,4.0,"My Chicago A La Card deck is taking me to restaurants that never would have been on my radar.  Despite its highly visible location at Clark and School Streets and its generally good reputation, Socca is one of them.  Because we were choosing from among a few different places at the last minute after a theater matinee, I hadn't done any research before leaving the house.  So for the first time in quite a while, I was walking into a restaurant ""blind,"" with no information other than the blurb printed on the card.  That factor probably contributed to my ultimate opinion--pleased and delighted. At 6 pm, they could offer us almost any seat in the house.  I expected it to fill up quickly but it wasn't quite to capacity when we left around 7:30.  Sit by the windows for great people-watching up and down Clark Street as the Saturday-evening scene begins to coalesce.   Our server Konstantin had a few interesting quirks, but nothing unpleasant.  He paid us just the right amount of attention, was friendly, and answered our questions capably.   The unique little thick and oily rolls with which they started us were good.  I wanted to try an actual socca--a thin chickpea-flour pancake native to southern France--so we ordered the grilled shrimp and socca appetizer, along with the grilled calamari.  Capers, arugula, cherry tomatoes, and a sort of herby dressing complemented the calamari, but I felt that this dish was lacking flavor.  I also would have appreciated if the calamari were hot rather than room temperature.  Good news--that was the only misstep of the meal.  The socca and accompanying chickpea aioli (tasted much like hummus) were delicious.  To the side was more arugula with a balsamic drizzle and a thick piece of roasted red pepper.  Forget the shrimp--they just got in the way.  They were fine, but I would rather have had two or three more of the soccas with that scrumptious aioli.   I had intended to order a lighter entree, because I'm trying not to be such a glutton these days and I knew that we would be sharing two appetizers.  However, Konstantin's description of one of the specials nearly knocked me out of my chair:  an Allen Brothers ribeye steak, topped with crispy red onions, served over a gorgonzola/bacon/wild-mushroom risotto, with a red wine and thyme reduction.  That's about fifty awesome flavors and ingredients packed into one dish, and I had absolutely no power to resist the temptation.  ""So what size is the steak?""  ""About 13 or 14 ounces.""  ""Damn, it couldn't have been eight or ten?  [sigh]  Okay, I'll take the steak special."" The whole dish was astounding.  The steak itself was one of the best I've had in recent memory.  It's a ribeye, so I had to carve off a bit of fat and gristle, but it was cooked perfectly and would have stood well on its own.  The risotto was impossibly rich, but delicious.  I took one bite and knew that I stood no chance to finish my entire plate.  Gorgonzola, bacon, and mushrooms--yes, those flavors work very well together.  I concentrated on eating the steak (you can't reheat steak, don't even bother) and took most of the risotto home.   I also tried a bite of my friend's gnocchi with lemon chicken and spring asparagus--a lovely, tasty dish which would have fit the lighter-profile meal that I was trying to have before Konstantin dropped the steak bomb on me.   Dessert?  Why not just show us the menu.  You have bread pudding?  Done.  Bread pudding is one of my three favorite non-chocolate desserts, and this was the best that I have ever had.  Please take me seriously, as I do not make these statements lightly.  Red Rooster makes a truly superior bread pudding, but they cheat by putting chocolate in it.  Socca's comes more traditionally with sliced apples, a caramel/cinnamon sort of sauce, and a scoop of vanilla gelato.  I nearly wept.  Actually, I'm nearly weeping right now.  Seriously. So other than the calamari, the food was a resounding success, but I am going to nitpick a couple of things which detracted just slightly from the atmosphere.  First, the paintings on the walls:  besides being seriously ugly, they don't match the color of the rest of the wall.  Second, the wait staff wears jeans, which I think are too casual for the ambiance in here.   Whatever.  You're not here to eat the walls or the servers' pants (I hope).  They have a $25 prix fixe Sunday through Tuesday nights, and although it's very rare for me to say this after trying a new place (Urban Belly, I'm looking at you), I want to come back very soon and try some more of the menu (sticking with the bread pudding for dessert though).",0.9987,0.805,0.153,0.042,0.5023681351328408

The restaurant itself has a lovely ambiance, with gorgeous wide plate windows around half of the dining room that look out onto Lakeview's bustling neighborhood. Inside, the walls are dark and have a few tasteful prints or paintings on them. The seating is spacious and I never felt crowded. For the four of us, we had the antipasto platter (excellent slices of cured meats, far too small an amount of a very delicious white cheddar or mild swiss, marinated olives, lightly pickled cucumbers); escargot (dripping in garlic butter, with a very interesting pot pie-like covering; and pomme frites (french fries) with a white truffle-infused cheese sauce that we poured over it. The pomme frites were actually the best part of the appetizers by far, being well-seasoned, and the cheese sauce was by no means overpowering. For the entree, I had the asiago/rabbit risotto, and it was utterly delectable. The rabbit was fall-off-the-fork tender and not too fatty, and the asiago held together the risotto with a rich taste. The Pinot Noir I had the waiter choose for me complemented the dish well. Other notable dish: the hangar steak, which was subtly seasoned and extremely tender. For dessert, I had the cinnamon croissant bread pudding, which was disappointing, but only because I'd forgotten that I don't like the texture of bread pudding. The vanilla gelato was delicious.  My friends left the meal feeling that our $45/person mael was way underpriced. Our waiter was excellent, walking the fine line between too helpful (he tried to insist on a Pinot Blanc when my friend really wanted a Pinot Grigio) and just the right amount of helpful (we often had what we wanted before we knew we wanted it).

2009-02-17,3.0,"A solid 3.5 stars.  The food was good (potato leek soup; pork chop; special v-day dessert) and our server was nice. He had this great bassy voice that was perfectly easy to hear in the din of a busy restaurant.  So then why not 4 or 5 stars? It was slow. Every table around us was waiting a LONG time for food. In fact the table next to us waited so long they got an apology. I understand that service is slower when places are busy, but this was noticable. It took 3 hours to eat and most of that was us waiting between finishing the soup and waiting for entrees.  Then there was the ambiance. So yeah, it was fine. And yeah, they have big picture windows that look out on to Clark and it's pretty...but half the seats in the place put your back to that window, so that isn't really a redeeming quality. And it was Valentine's Day so you know, I kind of hoped for a little something extra like a rose on each table or a red candle or something. But there was nothing and it looked just like any other night, really. They didn't even do anything cute with the specials menu.  So Socca, you were yummy, but you didn't do anything to stand out.

My only reason for giving it 4 rather than 5 stars is that the tables were so close together that i kept brushing up against people on either side of me, but I'll chalk that up to wanting to have a lot of tables available on V-day. Other than that, we ordered the goat cheese pizzette for an appetizer and my entree was a delicious melange of gnocchi, mussels, shrimp, scallops & grilled calamari in a spicy tomato sauce - DELISH! The BF got some ravioli that I didn't much care for but I didn't order it so I'll just comment on what I ordered. We finished the night out with the oreo-crusted chocolate cake. Soooo FAB!

The pommes frites w/ the truffle fondue dipping sauce are to die for. And since I can't get enough of the truffle fondue sauce on my fries though, so I often dip my bread in there as well! The pastas are always fresh, and they always have a great steak special. I am not a chicken fan, however, their chicken is perfect - moist, light and very flavorful. Usually I stick w/ the prosciutto pizza for my entree. I know most people get it as an appetizer, but what can I say - I'm a pizza lover. My favorite dessert is the chocolate hazelnut crunch crostada - the center of the chocolate cake is all warm and gooey.

We started in the bar as we waited for the stragglers to arrive.  I was met with a smile and a glass of vodka from the lovely bartender.  So of course, I was already in heaven.  But while I sipped on my cocktail I looked around and kind of fell in love with this place.  I'd passed by it so many times, but had never been inside and am now kicking myself for not coming sooner.  From the second you walk past the curtains in the door, you're transported into a cozy, warm restaurant.  The kick ass Chicago pictures hanging in the bar?  I'm totally stealing them when they're not looking. We took our seats at our table, and were greeted by our server who was friendly, funny, and attentive all night long.  He was even patient with us when it became obvious we weren't giving him our full attention during the specials. We ordered some appetizers - the goat cheese pizzette and curried lamb and garbanzo sloppy joes.  I only tried the pizzette and it was delicious, as was the sea salt bread they put on the table. I ordered the poulet - sauteed chicken, chive mashed potatoes, and haricot verts.  When my plate appeared in front of me, I just got happy because it looked SO good.  Luckily the taste lived up to the appearance, and I proceeded to eat myself into a food coma. But then *someone* decided that it was time for me to wake up from my food coma and forced dessert on me.  *cough* Carol J *cough*  Soon we had coconut creme brulee, croissant bread pudding, and chocolate hazelnut crunch crostata before us.  I sampled the creme brulee and the bread pudding, and they were both heavenly, though I must say the bread pudding was my favorite. Overall, I had a great time and a fantastic meal here and am looking forward to coming back.  Though I have to say, I'm glad we decided to be senior citizens for the night and ate an early dinner because as we finally made our way out the place was PACKED.  Clearly everyone in the neighborhood (and beyond) has caught on to how good this place is.",0.9963,0.786,0.175,0.038,0.5951754385964912

I was excited to try it for myself, as I had passed by Socca many times thinking that it looked like a cute place. After looking at the menu online and seeing the space, I was more intrigued and thought it would be a great place for dinner. We went there on a Saturday night and had a waitress that ended up going home sick in between our first and second course. We totally understood and were more concerned about her leaving than being ill at work and infecting the other staff and her guests. So, we got a replacement server that would be taking care of us for the rest of the evening. He was very obviously not happy with his coworker leaving mid- shift, as he had to help pick up her slack and it was very apparent that he wasn't happy about it. We were ignored multiple times throughout the evening, and his attitude was very rude towards us, almost condescending, when he was brought over to the table for mistakes he made on our food orders and choice of wine for that evening. We spent upwards of $100 for two people, and certainly do not need to be hand held throughout the dining experience. But forks, knives, and getting food that we actually ordered versus items that we hadn't asked for are basic dining requirements. I will give it a second chance, but I certainly haven't rushed to make that happen, nor will I anytime soon. Food was okay. Nothing great. Nothing terrible.

The hostess was busy so it wasn't a big deal.  Our entire party was seated 15 min after our reservation which was at 7:30 Our server (female, blonde, curly-ish hair) was nice enough...and greated us promptly- she was obviously a little rushed but the place was full-ish on a thursday and only appeared to have 2 head waiters on the floor ... we ordered wine off of their specials menu which was a nice touch.  The regular wine menu was pretty standard for Chicago.  Nothing out of the ordinary but a perfectly decent selection...  This is were the problems began... It is now around 8pm.  1/2 hour after our reservation and 15 min after our entire party was at the table.  We tell our server we need a few minutes to order...She dosnt return to the table until 8:45!!  This place is small...i was raising my hand and making eye contact with her over and over again and she just ignored me (and others at the table)   We finally order at 8:45- our server acts like nothing is wrong...even tho i tell her that one of our friends isn't going to be able to eat because she has to leave at 9pm (which shouldnt have been a problem with a 7:30 reservation).  The server dosnt appologize or anything just takes our order. Then it manages to get worse.... We dont get our food until 9:30- a full 45 min after we ordered and a full 2 hours after we arrived (at this point the restaurant is almost empty...everyone seated up to 45 min after us is served).  I again tell the server that we aren't happy about the wait... And then i look down at my steak (Which i ordered because of the yelp reviews) ....One look and anyone would know it was well done, not the medium rare I had asked for.  I cut it open and my fears are confirmed.  I have to walk up to the server at her side station becasue at this point i am starving and dont want to wait another 45 min for her to come over.  She comes back to the table with me and says ""you cant be mad at me, i didn't cook it"".  SERIOUSLY! (also my pommes frites were cold) She rushes out another...which is cooked perfectly and is delicious.   The manager comes over- I tell him that the new steak is great and that I wouldn't have been so cranky if I hadn't have had to wait 2 hours for my dinner.  The guy tried, he mentioned that he wasn't usually in the front of house (it was kinda obvious...)  he was nice enough...but didnt really seem to have a complete handle on the situation They ended up sending over 4 delicious deserts (at this point there were only 4 of us because one of my friends had to leave because the service was so slow).  All of a sudden our server was very concerned about us.. visiting more in our last 1/2 hour than she had the entire 3 hour night...I was kinda annoyed, since i would have just been happier to have decent service the whole night as opposed to great service for the last 1/2 hour. I probably would have been less pissed if they would have taken the steak off of the bill...I'm sorry but sending me 4 free deserts that i wouldn't have ordered anyways and making me pay for a steak that I not only had to send back but waited ultimately 2.25 hours for is not how most would have handled the situation. I dont want to be one of those ""I was in restaurants for 8 years people""  but I was in restaurants for 8 years....so i know how situations like this would normaly be handled.... I am usually the nicest person when it comes to this stuff.......believe me, back in my server days (and prolly in my manager days) i'm sure i f'd up my fair share of situations...but I never ignored a party...which is how my friends and i felt....

For entrees I had the roasted pork chop with mustard potato cake and wilted spinach.  It was honestly one of the better pork chops I've had at any restaurant; thick and perfectly cooked, with a nice crust of spices and dripping with juices.  My mom tried the special, seafood risotto, and she said it was delicious as well.   The dessert menu looked tantalizing but we stuck with cappuccinos.  Overall we had a great meal and a wonderful time, and our bill was reasonable- under $100 for wine, appetizer, entrees and coffee.  I feel like this restaurant could adapt to any sort of meal; a business dinner, a first date, a family meal.... it really is worth a try.",0.9986,0.7,0.286,0.014,0.616847041847042

We had a salad course with a classic caesar made just how I like it with lots of parmesan and anchovy flavor, and caprese salads with BIG ol' red and yellow heirloom tomatoes.  3 pastas and 2 risottos came next (at this point I was already in full food coma life support mode but I was not about to pass up a carb bender...)   The gnocchi was the highlight of all 5.... it had chicken, butternut squash and the lightest cream sauce... I would come back to Socca for this alone! The cavatappi bolognese was also delish for a classic red based pasta dish.  The risottos... one was great and the other was way too salty... since I don't know which was which... well, just stick to all of the other wonderful dishes.

Next, I had the chicken and wild mushroom risotto which was excellent.  Risotto may seem simple, but it is often done improperly.  This risotto was excellent.  Very tender and nicely presented.   For dessert, we shared the chocolate dessert and the white chocolate creme brulee.  The chocolate dessert was incredibly rich and perfectly paired with pistachio gelato.  The creme brulee was average and I probably wouldn't order it again.   The only thing I didn't get about this place was the terribly out of place music selection.  Think Journey and Phil Collins in a white tablecloth type restaurant.  The staff would do well to change that.",0.9912,0.774,0.203,0.022,0.5933531746031747
