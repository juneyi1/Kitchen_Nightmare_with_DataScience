2017-08-25,5.0,"Delicious!  I was here for an alumni event so we were seated downstairs in the private room area.  The food and service were both amazing.  The passed appetizers were a great starter (scallops!  Melon and prosciutto!) and the wait staff were all friendly.   Once we sat down Bobbie talked us through the menu for the evening, which made my entree decision very difficult because she made everything sound amazing.  Our artichoke/arugula salad was good, though probably my least favorite of the night (it was pretty small, and the flavors just didn't speak to me).  My pasta entree (Taglioline pagilia e fieno) was out of this world-the ragu texture was perfect, and the balance of pasta to ragu was good.  The quail egg on top just made it super decadent. The shared desserts were great as well-I'm usually not a huge chocolate fan, but the molten lava cake was great.  The panna cotta was good, your standard panna cotta, and the budino was great-tasted like amaretto and had a great texture.  Limoncello was a perfect digestif after the meal. This was an event, so I can't comment on price, though I can guess based on the location and quality of the food this would be a special-occasion place.  It won't be in my regular rotation, but you bet I'm going to find a way to get back!",0.9929,0.765,0.209,0.026,0.6336103197214308

2017-03-21,5.0,"I must first say that I have been coming to Merlo on Maple for many years and it is always elegant and wonderful.  It is one of my top ten restaurants ever and would have never have come if it were not for a very dear friend that gave us a gift certificate when we moved to Illinois for a short period. We fell in love with everything at Merlo on Maple that first time and even though we have moved back to Colorado, we visit them whenever we are in town. Now be prepared to have your taste buds wowed by truly artistic dishes and the ever changing seasonal specials of the Northern Italian cuisine.  We started by sharing three wonderful appetizers as the selection was difficult to choose just one.  We had a fresh artichoke salad, buffalo mozzarella wrapped in spec and a beautiful mushroom torte. The beauty and flavors are out of this world and all the dishes and pastas are made by hand and a piece of art.   Our main dishes were even more wonderful, I was introduce to morels about eight years ago here and was very fortunate to be here this year when the special was risotto with morels and shaved black truffles.  The flavors were incredible and the extremely generous portion of truffles was excellent.  Our party shared all our dishes and each of them was outstanding.  The wine list is a wonderful balance of old and new world with a fair price for the quality.  The service is impeccable and the chef even came out a couple of times to talk with the guests.  This is truly a wonderful hidden gem.  I know the prices seem high but the saying is so true, you get what you pay for. One last comment I must make.  I was entertaining a celebrity chef and he asked me to select my favorite restaurant in Chicago, the heat was on but I was confident he would be pleased.  At the end of the night, his comment was that he never would have sought out Merlo on Maple but will now return with his wife for this lovely experience.",0.9968,0.776,0.211,0.013,0.6444676355390639

Apps included the prosciutto meatballs and the baby mozzarella which was served with asparagus and cherry tomatoes. The server seemed to think the meatballs were amazing, but in my view, they were just average. The meatballs at Osteria via Stato are easily the best in Chicago and maybe anywhere. The mozzarella was very well prepared though. We then enjoyed some homemade pasta that was generously topped with shaved truffles. It was awesome. If you like truffles, this dish is a must. Two of us ordered specials for our entrees and my other buddy got the veal bolognese (which he always gets). I tried it. It was very good. I ordered a white fish filet (I forget the exact fish) which was gently prepared and very tasty. It did have a few small bones in it which I was not happy about, but I got through it. The other special was some pork neck meat or something, but my buddy loved it. Service: perfect. My buddy who lives in Chicago knows this bartender so maybe that helped, but she was great.

2017-02-11,2.0,"I should have known we were in for quite the night when our waitress started by qualifying the size of the turbot special with ""the portion, I mean, it's large. Maybe a man can handle it all, but it would be a lot for a woman"". Had the rest of the meal been delish and service run smoothly, it would have all been lolz, but given that I'd be hard pressed to find something to return for, I'm going to give it all a hard no - much better Italian food is to be had in the city. Started with the raw artichoke salad (celery, mache, parm) - a bitty portion, the artichokes woody, fibrous - the fennel/walnut/endive thing slightly more enjoyed by the N/H crew, but lacking intrigue. I will say that the mound of burrata was happily noshed, but even keeping that in mind, it's maybe not ideal when the star of the apps was the olive oil accompanying the totally righteous focaccia.  For mains, I thought we were finding redemption in the form of carbs as the taglioline ai 40 rossi {aka pasta made w 40 egg yolks aka cardiac arrest in a dish) was actually wonderful and the gnocchi was gone in the blink of an eye; however, I then wrapped my tongue around the flaccid, bland turbot and my hopes and dreams were dashed. Accompanied by some devastating veggie skewers, I ate it b/c obs I had to show the waitress what was up, but I did not like any part of it. The rest of the crew was equally unimpressed with the  ""fritto di pesce con carciofi e zucchini"" which is basically some fried seafood shizz (scallops, shrimp, calamari) that all seemed that it had rolled in straight from a heatlamp that was fired up in 1993 and hasn't changed settings since. Service is molasses slow and quite judgy - challenging S to a taste off after he didn't love his gin martini - and attempting to dictate what and how ppl ordered, it was all weird. If you have to go, maybe you'd have better luck with the ossobuco, which A liked enough, or the lamb shank - and the squid ink tagliatelle did look nice...but idk...nothing abt it was particularly enjoyable except for the company.  For starters, for $12, my salad was offensively petite, though I will give the place cretit, the other salady sitch wasn't nearly as light on ...food - mozz with speck $17, antipasto $28. Pastas run $20-34, meaty mains $44- Lord knows, as I certainly wasn't informed that my turbot would be $62, and had I been, I would have passed on that realllll quick. Meh.

But this was the second time we had the misfortune of being seated on what is evidently known as the ""middle floor.""  This floor consists of a few booths and tables with a distinctly different ambience than either the lower or upper floors. It is off the bar and the kitchen where one is ""treated"" to: 1) the pub-like and fairly loud (for an otherwise elegant dining establishment) pop musical fare emanating from what was on this occasion an empty bar; and 2) the swinging kitchen door and occasional sounds of clanging pots and pans. When we were seated, we asked about the other floors and were told that the top floor was closed and that the lower level (with a significantly more refined atmosphere, complete with lower lighting and light classical music in the background) was hosting a ""private party."" As it turned out, the alcove off the lower floor had a party of eight and there was another apparently unrelated party of four at one of the many other tables available in this strikingly more elegant ambience. When we inquired as to why we weren't given the opportunity to be seated on the lower level (especially when we requested a ""quiet"" table in our reservation through Open Table), we were told that next time we should ""call"" and ask not to be seated on the middle floor.

My boyfriend also ordered a old fashion drink because he loves whiskey.   They mentioned they have a full bar and make great drinks - he said it was probably the worst drink he ever had which is not good considering how many of these he has had in his lifetime. Lastly, when we were walking out and leaving after skipping dessert and just wanted to leave - we figured at least one of the hostess' would say thank you for coming in.  She chased us out the front door not to say thank you - but for some reason ask what our name was under our reservation in open table to she could record it.   Overall, it was an extremely disappointing experience that I had scheduled for over a month in advance.   Sadly, I would not recommend or return to this restaurant.",0.6284,0.851,0.088,0.061,0.5026580086580086
2016-02-15,2.0,"My girlfriend and I tried Merlo on Maple for the first time on Valentine's Day. Perhaps the small amount of snow caught the restaurant off guard, but between the lacking availability of the signature dishes we'd hoped to try, and poor service in both the bar and dining areas, we were highly disappointed considering the prices being paid, and will not be returning.  Pros:  - The pasta dishes were delicious.  - The restaurant's ambiance likely provides for a nice date or special occasion setting when the staff has its act together.  Cons: - Completely disappointing service. We arrived slightly early with intentions of grabbing drinks at the bar before dinner. The bartender (didn't catch his name, but was an older gentleman with a shaved head), who was engaged in a round of witty banter with several other patrons at the bar, seemed disinterested in two more arrivals, and reeled off a string of one-word ""no"" answers as we inquired about drink types. ""Do you have a drink menu then?...no."" So helpful! - Once we were seated, our waiter Kenn proceeded to tell us about all the items that were no longer available on the menu given how jammed they'd been. Two of the four missing menu items were entrees we were excited to order in advance of arriving. It shouldn't be that surprising to a restaurant of this caliber that Valentine's Day would be a busy one, especially with people being charged a fee should they not honor their reservations. There wasn't much personal attention from Kenn from that point forward, and he seemed much more interested in moving us along rather than providing the type of Valentine's experience for which we'd hoped. Another service fail.  This may have just been an off night for Merlo, but as several others have mentioned, there are many other great Italian restaurants in Chicago where you'll actually feel that your patronage is appreciated.

The restaurant has an adorable ambiance as you're dining in an antique three flat. The food was good. We tried a salad, artichoke tart, four different pastas, the panna cotta, and a pudding dessert.

Our eyes popped out when the bill came as we were still hungry. You can go to Rose Angelis in Lincoln Park, which offers the same ambiance with decent service but fantastic home cooked Italian food with portions so large they last for days, all for less than half the cost of Merlo.

2015-02-07,2.0,"Maybe I don't like Northern Italian food, but I was not impressed.  My date and I came for dinner during restaurant week and were excited to try a Michelin recommended restaurant for a restaurant week price.  The restaurant is in a cute brownstone and has a nice bar at the front on the first floor.  We found the restaurant week menu diverse, but the prices were such that it was comparable to ordering from the main menu.  We had the apple salad and the insalata mista.  The apple salad was delicious, and perfectly seasoned, with nuts, apples and cheese.  The insalata mista tasted like bland lettuce.  For our entrees, we had the lamb shank and the lasagna (not on the restaurant week menu).  The lamb was just not good, the flavors were very earthy and heavy.  It did come with delicious potatoes and asparagus that was cold, not just room temperature, cold.  I only ate the potatoes.  The lasagna was overly greasy and small.  Only had a few bites of that as well.  Dessert was the chef's take on tiramisu and that was amazing.  It was probably the best take on tiramisu I've ever had.  Not too sweet, perfect combination of coffee flavor and marscapone. In addition to the dessert, the wine was wonderful and perfect.  Harmony, our waitress was knowledgeable about every thing on the menu and wine list.  She was attentive and helpful and exactly the kind of server you would hope for at a great restaurant.  She recommended a great wine that we couldn't stop raving about.

2015-02-01,3.0,"I'm a bit conflicted in this review, as we experienced less than ideal service and execution, while enjoying some incredible homemade pasta. There were 8 of us for dinner last night in celebration of a special birthday. Merlo was wonderful in having a special gelato with a candle brought out for the birthday boy, but throughout the evening the service was spotty and a bit aggressive. Our server was gregarious and personable, but kept trying to sell an 8-pasta tasting course, where unfortunately there were quite a few allergies at the table so we weren't interested. They still persisted until I blatantly said "" I think we may consider just the entrees"".  As for the food, the lamb shank was so-so, but lacked the in depth flavor I was expecting - I would stick with the veal shank (osso bucco) instead. The bolognese had the same issue - the pasta was absolutely spot-on but the meat sauce was dry and lacked rich and robust flavor.  I mentioned the gelato above, which was great they were able to accommodate, but instead of asking if anyone would like coffee, dessert, or an after dinner drink, they brought it out immediately after dinner, causing an awkward length of time before returning to take everyone else's order. All in all, I'd go back if it were just 2 of us and for some of the food items.

2015-01-11,1.0,"I have lived on the Near North Side of Chicago for 25+ years and dine out frequently with friends and family.  The ritual of sharing a fine meal and breaking bread with loved ones is at the heart of a quality life.   Having lived on Chicago's Near North Side for over two decades I was pleasantly surprised when I stumbled upon Merlo on Maple. From the street the restaurant is a gorgeous brown stone in Chicago's Gold Coast neighborhood. A quick peak inside the window at street level offers the casual pedestrian a quick look into an elegantly paneled dining room with white linen table clothes, fresh cut roses on each table and the finest silver cutlery and dishware. Beautiful, impressive, and romantic fail to do justice to the picturesque street snapshot observed by pedestrians walking by the establishment. Thus, when my girlfriend asked me to select a place to dine out for my birthday I immediately thought of Merlo on Maple. First I need to qualify a couple points. I have visited the restaurants web sight frequently before making our reservation. I was aware the the portion sizes were not large and that the chef/owner was not professionally trained in the culinary arts. The owner and her husband stumbled upon the idea of opening a restaurant in Chicago that offers authentic northern Italian cuisine while on a trip to Chicago over 11 years ago. In the piece done by Channel 9 I opined that the husband and wife were personable, sincere and wanted to bring the finest Northern Italian food to a city sorely lacking this culinary niche.  Now that I have qualified these points onward to my initial reactions and unbiased review of the food and ambiance offered at Merlo on Maple. We arrived on time for our reservation promptly at 5:30 pm on a Saturday evening. When we arrived the hostess was on the phone and did not acknowledge us until she hung up the phone several minutes later. Not an auspcious start to begin our evening. The appropriate response should have been one of two possible scenarios. First, ask the person on the phone to hold and inquire if we had a reservation or secondly acknowledge us by informing us that she would be with us in a moment (and smile while doing it). When she finally turned her attention to us she asked our name and advised us that we would be dining on the third floor. We checked our coats at the door and followed her to our table on the third floor. When we arrived on the third floor the dining area was empty and freezing cold. My girlfriend had to retrieve her coat to wear at the table. The waiter apologized and stated he turned the heat up one degree. That was not a typo. Yes, he informed us that he adjusted the temperature by 1 degree. Of course the dining room remained cold throughout our entire dining experience. We were informed over 30 minutes into the meal that somehow the temperature had been turned down again, but that our waiter assured us that he immediately corrected the thermostat a second time. It didn't help and the dining room remained cold. Our server suggested a few specials being offered using White Truffles, but when asked for dining suggestions on the menu stated everything is great. Not true of any restaurant menu but I digress. Our server prepared an antipasta plate to start our dining experience. Good but not great. A couple thin slices of proscuttio, a nibble of parmesan and a strand of seasoned cold veggies. We then ordered our cocktails. I chose a 12 year old Scotch and my girlfriend a gimlet. Our server brought the drinks to our table within 5 minutes, but my scotch was in a martini shaker, chilled. I was aghast, but remained silent initially. He must have seen my expression and quickly stated you did'nt want this served up?  Obviously the answer was no and he quickly returned with my scotch served clean. An error that should never have been made in a finer dining establishment. Afterwards we proceeded to order our entrees. Our server continually insisted that only the finest and freshest ingredients were used in the preparation of our food. My girlfriend order the pasta with bolenese sauce, while I chose the gnochi with cream sauce, white truffles and a quail egg. The food arrived 25 minutes later hot. When the food was brought to our table it was presented on white plates, covered by a silver lid. When the lid was removed I was shocked at the portion size on both plates. Honestly, both entrees were no larger than a small cupcake. My girlfriends bolenese was flavorless, the meat tasted freezer burnt and it was dry. Hardly a smidge of tomato could be found on the plate. My gnochi was warm, but bland. We opted for dessert. It was again nothing special. After we left we ended up going to Connie's Pizza for a second dinner because we were starving. All told this meal cost 167 dollars with tip. What a waste!  I will end with a quote from Woody Allen's Annie Hall:  ""The food here is terrible. Yes, and such small portions.""",0.9513,0.874,0.076,0.05,0.4444444444444444

He made a perfect Manhattan and suggested a dry Prosecco, which hit the spot. When friends arrived we were ushered to the elegant second story dining room. Two minor points here-- lighting dimmers go a long way to setting the mood (it was too bright) and soft jazz instrumental (eg Miles) might have been more suitable than the Muzak that was playing.  Food was exceptional-- my only issue was many of the apps had pistachios (I'm tree nut allergic), so I couldn't try the sampler that included pastry wrapped mortadella (looked delicious). But I was able to sample the quail egg linguini pasta. Al Dente perfection.  For entrees, I tried my partner's Osso Buco, which was about the best I ever had. My line caught Alaskan Halibut was perfect. No dessert, only cappuccinos and then the bill came. My eyes popped out of my skull. This is not an inexpensive place by any stretch. Oh my.

The atmosphere was great- gold coast walk up turned into a restaurant with 3 levels of dining- very quaint. The music was audible, but not overwhelming- it lent itself nicely to conversation unlike many restaurants that make you talk over the loud music.  The waiter gets 5 stars- he was phenom! Very helpful with the food and drinks. He also was very attentive despite the fact he was covering the entire upstairs- I was impressed with how well he served everyone. The food was superb. We ""split"" the mozzarella and tomato special (I say split in quotes because I basically ate it all it was so good!). My boyfriend had the minestrone- he said it was by far the best minestrone he has ever had. I tried some- I agreed! For our entrees we ordered 3 (don't judge)- I had the lamb, he had the agnolotti and we split the shrimp risotto- all of it was great. The lamb literally fell off the bone and was delicious! The agnolotti was fantastic and the sauce was very flavorful but not overwhelming. The shrimp risotto was great as well, but not as good as the other two.  While the dessert list looked great, we just were too full for it. We definitely will be going back to ensure we can try some! Great job, Merlo!",0.998,0.714,0.275,0.01,0.6907142857142857

2014-02-16,4.0,"We have wanted to try Merlo on Maple for years but just never got around to it.  After reading tons of reviews on Yelp and TripAdvisor, we braced ourselves for poor service and entered cautiously optimistic about the food.  The coat check girl and hostess were very pleasant, although they couldn't have been more than sixteen years old.  We were seated right away on the first floor at a booth.  The booth was spacious for two.  The wood walls and floors were stunning.  Beautiful space.  Real rose buds in water, as well as a real candle.  We started off with a bottle of Brunello de Montalcino Caparzo.  There were four Valentine's Day specials in addition to the regular menu, but we didn't order any of those.  Homemade pasta crackers and bruschetta came with an olive oil that had a kick.  Very much enjoyed.  We started off with two appetizers: carpaccio and buffalo mozzarella/prosciutto with asparagus spears.  The carpaccio came out a bit colder than I like, thereby interfering with the natural flavor of the beef and had about a half of a tablespoon too much olive oil on it.  Adequate, but I've had better at Antica Pizzeria for half the price.  The buffalo mozzarella/prosciutto was very, very tasty.  Wanted to order another one.  For our pastas, we tried the ragiatelle with rabbit ragu and the black truffle tagliatelle.  Both were stunningly prepared and plated and THEY WERE OUT OF THIS WORLD.  Yes, people have complained about the prices of the pasta and quantity.  You are paying for the prep for homemade pasta.  Delicious.  Both were equally amazing.  This pasta was perhaps better than Spiaggia's pasta.  They didn't skimp on the black truffle either.  We joked with our waiter, Sam, that we were going to order more pastas after our dinner entree.  Entrees: lamb shank and ossubucco.  The lamb shank fell off in pieces (as it should), very tender, with asparagus and roasted potatoes as plated sides.  The ossobucco was incredibly tender as well, with just the right hint of herbs and amount of tomato/celery/onion.  It came with a large dollop of risotto.  Not impressed with the risotto at all.  Neither meat entree came out as hot as I expected.  For dessert, we ordered panna cotta and the molten chocolate cake (made to order).  The molten chocolate cake was incredibly chocolately with no extra sweetness, plated with strawberries, blueberries, currants, and whipped cream with chocolate shavings.  Outstanding dessert.  The panna cotta was just ok.  Had way better at Pasticceria Natalia, back when she was around, or at Coco Pazzo.  I also had a lemondrop martini ($15) and would not recommend a basic mixed drink there, too lemony and not enough alcohol.  Our waiter, Sam, was delightful, engaging, charming and very attentive.  The bill came to around 350 with taxes.  Would we go back again?  Absolutely if we could have Sam as a waiter.  We are also low sodium eaters and found that their meals were not salty at all.  However, we would rather go back and order four appetizers and four pastas, skipping the meat entrees altogether.  I think we will be back.  Is this place as good as Coco Pazzo, Spiaggia or Osteria Via Stato?  I don't think I can say that, but we definitely enjoyed ourselves.",0.9985,0.799,0.175,0.026,0.5321035137701804

Another star will go to the great food. I had the Taglioline all' astice e gocce nere di crema di seppie, it's basically a lobster pasta. The flavors were very subtle and the spice was just right. My girlfriend had the lobster risotto, it was delicious too and cooked to perfection. All this with a couple glasses of wine, and a dark chocolate lava cake for dessert.  This place, however, lost my reservation. I made a reservation two weeks prior to Valentine's day, and I was going to call to confirm my reservation that day, but I gave them the benefit of the doubt. The owner or the manager of Merlo was very, very rude and unprofessional. He started spewing garbage about how they take CC information on reservations and how they called me 6 times and left voicemails...No...You didn't..F'ing Liar...  He pulls me aside and explains that they cannot be giving out seats to customers with no reservation. Sorry but, YOU LOST MINE. I was very embarrassed in front of my girlfriend. Even the girls who take your jacket and reservations were wide eye'd and giggling. This was supposed to be a special night with no worries, and he ruined it.

2014-01-31,4.0,"I gotta keep it at 4 stars.  Like the first time I was here, the food is good enough to keep me coming back but the rest is tragic.   I came here with my boyfriend and my bestest foodie girlfriend.  We had raved about the soup so we were excited for her to try it.  I miscalculated how long it would take to get there.  I was about 20 mins early.  I walked in and gave the hostess my info and explained that my friend was walking over and my boyfriend was paying the meter.  Then I stood there and looked at her.  For a long, awkward amount of time.  You'll note that she's wearing denim leggings which is fine for me but I get the impression that they're trying to be fancy fine dining (as opposed to hip fine dining like a Graham Elliot) Then I think she realized I was waiting for her move and she said they weren't open yet but to wait in the bar.  That would explain the grunge hits from the 90s blaring from the other room :-).  There was another couple in the bar drinking wine.  The bartender seemed cool.  He offered me a drink and said he had to go to a quick meeting w/ the staff and then would be back and our table probably would be ready then.  By then my boyfriend arrived and decided to use the men's room down stairs.  After my friend arrived our table was ready per the bartender.  So we all walked over to the host stand where she was talking to someone - maybe the owner?  Then it was like she sensed she was being watched and brought us over to the table.  At the table you can hear the music from the kitchen.  Its fine with us.  I don't mind Radiohead but perhaps the clientele that they're clearly trying to attract does.  When my boyfriend returned I asked him if he was smoking pot.  He smelled like college.  We asked for help with a bottle of wine.  Our waiter was attentive but a little bit of a stalker.  Before there were other people he would jump in on our conversation.  Maybe a little bit condescending?  I didn't mind it too much but my friends were annoyed.  He suggested something that we went with and we were a little regretful.  It was just an ok bottle of wine.  The hostess only gave us regular menus so the waiter came over with the Restaurant Week options and helped us make good decisions.  Then we got a basked of crackers and two pieces of really dense, really good raisin bread.  No butter which would have put the bread on another level.  We enjoyed until we saw other tables get a basket with a lot more in it, and butter.  We would have liked to try to the focaccia!  There was a table that came in after we finished our apps and they left before us.  It seems when people came in that we were a little bit forgotten.  I'm in my 40s and haven't felt slighted b/c of my age in a very long time but last night - I think we were not given the same amount of attention as the others.  There was one couple that was celebrating a birthday and they were offered a tour.  When I got up to leave the executive chef and owner was coming into the dining room.  This was the third time I had seen her.  No eye contact, no hello or thank you or goodbye or come again soon.  She was on her way in to talk to one of the other tables.  It was as if we were in her way.  There was also an unusually long wait from app to main.  It was kind of awkward and we're not sure what the hold up was. So the highlight is the food.  After saying all that I still look forward to coming back.  The owner wasn't there the first time I was there so maybe we were there on an off night.  I'll give it all a pass. My boyfriend and friend both had the tarta.  They were over the moon for it.  Just loved every bite.  They said they'd come back just for that.  I had the crispy salad with cheese.  It was just ok.  Nothing outstanding but fresh, crispy, and well seasoned.  I could have used more cheese or have the cheese crumbled up.  It was just one big glop of cheese on top.   For mains my friend and I had the tortelloni.  OMG that was heaven.  Its very rich but also earthy, creamy delicious.  It was hard for me to offer a bite to my boyfriend but I did.  He also loved it.  He got the tagliatelle.  He loved it too. For dessert my friend and I had the semifreddo.  It was creamy and yummy but the chocolate sauce on top was like Hershey's from a squirt bottle.  My boyfriend got the panna cotta which was heavy in vanilla in a good way.  He won the dessert contest.  He was wishing for more as he was scraping the plate clean. We will definitely be back.  I'm starting to think the service issues, not by our waiter, but by everyone else, is quirky.  It makes this place interesting.  The food, is outstanding.  I still have dreams of that soup!!",0.9995,0.78,0.19,0.03,0.5027388293843991

Being NYE, we wanted to celebrate and enjoy the dinner, and our waiter was great at letting us take our time.

I then had the vegetable minestrone which I didn't expect it to be great, so was pleasantly surprised by the great flavors. My husband tried it too, having gotten the artichoke salad, and liked it better than his salad. Conversely, I liked his salad more than the soup. For our entrees, I ordered the tortelloni filled with ricotta, served with porcini mushrooms. Now, I'm not a huge mushroom fan, but not being a meat-eater, I asked the waiter for this recommendation and he said by-far his favorite non-meat entree was this one. And boy was it fantastic! One of the best meals ever. My husband ordered the Ravioli di erbette con le noci, which was cheese raviolis tossed with walnuts. Just fantastic fantastic as well! I couldn't decide whose I liked more. Mine probably, as his was just a little more rich than mine. For dessert we had to order the chocolate molten cake, and yes, it was 100% chocolately.

2013-08-19,2.0,"My husband and I went here recently. As a bit of background, we both have a lot of experience with Italian restaurants. He's from a traditional Italian family (in fact, his mom was a chef for priests until she retired). I'm Italian on my father's side, but not traditional. We've eaten at Italian restaurants all over the world as well as in Chicago. We also visited Naples and Rome with my father several years ago. When we walked in, we were seated in the small downstairs area, despite the upstairs area being relatively uncrowded. This might not have been so bad except that there was a very large group in there (they appeared to be business travelers) that was also quite loud. They seated us directly next to them. They were so loud that it was not only difficult for us to talk to one another, but it was hard to ignore their conversation. We would have understood if the restaurant was full, but it wasn't. If we're going to drop $250 on a nice dinner out together, we'd really like to at least be able to talk to one another. Another problem with the restaurant was that the decor was downright tacky. It was like sitting in your grandmother's basement, and not in a good way. There were stacks of magazines laying around, rooster knickknacks, photos on the wall,etc. While there were candles on every table, the lighting in the downstairs was quite bright, making the candles both pointless and out of place. I don't normally get snobby about decor, but it was so glaringly obvious in this case. It didn't convey the classy-yet-cozy ambience that they advertised. In fact, there was no ambience whatsoever.  The food itself was good, but the portions were extremely small. Normally when I go to a restaurant, whether in Chicago or somewhere else, I'm lucky if I can eat half of the pasta I'm given. This is so much so that I've got into the habit of not ordering a salad with my pasta so that I don't fill up too much before the entree gets there. In this case, I saw the food and became worried that I might leave hungry. (I didn't, but that was partly due to the fact that I was taking medicine with an appetite suppressing side effect.) When I finished, the waiter made a rather big production about the fact that I had finished my entree. He kept saying things like ""Wow, no to-go box for you!"" ""You ate it all!"" and ""There are a couple of truffles left on the plate, I could box those up for you!"" I found that to be exceedingly rude, especially considering the small portions.  I suppose there is a trend of appetizer-sized portions in modern restaurants, but if they were going for the ultra-modern motif, then I have to reiterate my complaint about the decor. You can do ultra modern with upscale decor, or you can do the traditional ""eat, eat, you're so skinny"" Italian grandmother schtick, but you can't combine the ambience of an Italian grandmother's basement with the serving style of nouvelle cuisine. It just doesn't work.",-0.8369,0.87,0.056,0.074,0.44615575396825397

The ambiance in this place is great - it's quiet, ultra romantic and gets you away from the hustle and bustle of the city.  The server we had was fantastic. She was attentive and knowledgeable. When we asked for a few wine recommendations, she was spot on and even got us to try something outside of our comfort zone. Had we been ordering off the regular menu, I'm confident she would have given us some great picks as well. The food was fantastic. The courses were well thought out and each new plate built on the last. The only thing we weren't fans of was the dessert - it was some kind of molten cake with (I believe) grand marnier and something else. It was just plain awful which was such a sad way to end the night. I did take a bit of comfort in seeing that it isn't offered on their regular menu because I would have been sorely disappointed to pay $10 up for that dessert. But, the rest of the meal was fantastic. Our favorites were the pappardelle in a bolognese meat sauce, the grilled eggplant, and the tortolinni.

The food was wonderful.  Not awesome, not creative, not woah-how-does-this-work, but perfectly executed and truly delicious.  Absolutely no complaints on that score.  She made the point that all of the pasta, sauces, and most of the cheese is homemade, and the freshness (particularly of the pasta) was notable.  It was what I think of as really good Italian food: fresh, flavorful, but ultimately uncomplicated.

Long story short, our waitress YELLED at us because some of my friends during dinner left the table to order drinks at the bar downstairs. The reason why my friends went to the bar for drinks is because she told them the restaurant does NOT carry the drink they were requesting.. when BEFORE dinner, my friends ordered and received the specific drink at the bar. So...when the lady saw the new drinks on the table, she yelled at us, saying that we are RUDE for getting up in the middle of dinner to grab drinks at the bar because she is trying to make money and if the tab is higher, the more tips she will get. Yes, we were all astonished at all the atrocious things she was saying!  Mind you, this place is a small, quiet and a very intimate place.

We were greeted by Jesse, out server for the evening and he was great, walking us through the regular menu, the daily specials and the Special ""White Truffle Menu"" and every item discussed sounded better than than the last.  It was going to be difficult to decide what to order..... I ordered the Zuchinni Blossom special, consisting 4 Zuchinni Blossoms filled with fresh Mozzarella and a little Anchovy, then fried and served with a small salad of mixed greens as my starter.  My wife started with the Carpaccio and we also ordered a Burrata to start.  All the starters were outstanding and we enjoyed the Burrata throughout the meal.  My wife ordered the Tagliatelle al tartufo nero fresco, burro e Parmigiano Reggiano (Tagliatelle with Fresh Black Truffles tossed in Butter and Parmigiano Reggiano and I had the Weekend Special Pasta; Troccoli Pugliesi, handmade pasta dressed w/ meat sauce made of veal, pork, lamb, & porcini mushrooms.....

2012-06-30,1.0,"Such a disappointment! My husband and I were in town for a convention. Last night, on our last night in town, we wanted to find an authentic Italian restaurant with a romantic atmosphere where we could enjoy each others' company for a while. We both ordered iced tea. It came after a few minutes and, when I went to put sugar in it, we saw a BIG bug floating halfway down, stuck between an ice cube and the glass. I asked the waiter for another glass of tea after I pointed out the bug. He simply - unapologetically - brought me another glass of tea.  The restaurant was not busy. When we got there, only one other table was filled and - when we left - only another three had been filled; however, the waiter acted as if he was doing us a favor by waiting on us at all. Throughout the meal, I had to ask to have my tea refilled  - the waiter would simply walk by and ignore the empty glass.  We had a very delicious artichoke tart for our appetizer. For the price, we were expecting a small tart .  We got 1/4 of a small tart (approximately 2 inches long and maybe an inch wide)! It really only amounted to a couple of bites each! The lasagna my husband ordered was okay, just a bit bland and very dry. Again, it was a very tiny portion. I ordered the tagliatelle with bolognese sauce. It was such a small portion that it barely filled the very center of the plate. It, too, was very bland.  I've never had a bolognese sauce that had such little taste to it! For dessert, we ordered the chocolate lava cake, which we were told was a house specialty. We waited and waited (it is cooked to order); when it came, we broke it open so the ""lava"" could ooze out over the warm cake ..... Nothing came out!! It was beyond overcooked and dry! We got the waiter's attention and asked him if the cake should look that way. He said that it should not. Again, he seemed very unapologetic! He did offer to have another one started, but we simply didn't have the time to wait that long. His solution was to bring us some chocolate sauce to dip the cake into so that it could be eaten, but it did nothing to mask the dryness of the cake, so we gave up. The bill was delivered to us. Neither the tea or the cake had been taken off our bill. I've been in some wonderful restaurants. In those restaurants (or even in a not so wonderful one), a manager would have been over immediately if a guest had been served a bug in the drink or an inedible dessert. We never saw the manager. The waiter never came back so we could ask about the bill. We finally left. We tried to talk with the girl manning the front desk, but she seemed to care so little that we gave up. Earlier in the week, we went to an Italian restaurant near our hotel. The prices were about the same, but the food was significantly better. During our stay, the chef came out of the kitchen to see if we were enjoying our entrees, the manager came by our table to see how the meal was going, and the waiter kept our glasses filled. It was a delightful experience. I couldn't help compare that experience with the very disappointing one we had at Merlo on Maple. The staff at Merlo didn't seem to care whether the dining experience was a good one and didn't seem to care if the food or drinks were subpar.

It's a great place for dates, double dates, and for small groups of friends to get together for a chat over good food. I'm sure they had a great list of wine since everyone else had wine on their tables, I unfortunately am not a wine enthusiast so we skipped that part of the experience. When we arrived we were greeted with friendliness and warmth, our coats were checked and we were led to our table downstairs. There were pictures and paintings on the wall that reminded me of a combination of a restaurant with someone's nice, comfortable living room or sun room. Somewhat dim lighting with candles at every table. Out of 5 stars for romance, I would say the atmosphere was closer to 3.5.  Seated, we looked through their menu which just the right size with a good selection of salads/soups, appetizers, pastas, meats, and seafood. We were looked after well, with the waiter coming to our table after about 5-10 minutes and coming to check on us throughout the meal. But I do have to say that a table nearby left after the waiter apparently took too long to get to their table.  We ordered the artichoke tart as a shared appetizer, and for our entrees the braised lamb shank and the fried seafood platter. The waiter was kind enough to ask if we were sharing the appetizer and upon us saying yes, proceeded to serve our appetizer on two separate plates - nice, detailed touch. The tart was delicious, had a great combination of artichoke, cheese, and egg flavors. It tasted more like a quiche with a fantastic buttery crust, perfectly paired with the slightly bitter, sweet and tangy salad that adorned the side. The lamb shank was really tasty, it had some great rich flavors and was paired with some perfectly cooked potatoes and asparagus bundle. The fried seafood left something to be desired though. There wasn't enough contrast of textures or flavors, that plate definitely fell flat. The fried scallops were tasty but that was about it - everything else was the same old stuff that you can find elsewhere in a light breading. That plate was admittedly pretty disappointing, especially since there were no sauces so it got very boring very quickly.

2010-08-01,2.0,"I think I got the idea to go to this place because I wanted to try a different Italian place and this restaurant was on Opentable's list of most booked Italian restaurants in Chicago.  Now having gone there, I can't, for the life of me, imagine why this place made the list.  Is it the location?  How the place looks from the outside?  The cute name of the restaurant?  Please, tell me - I'm dying to know.  Because I can guarantee you one thing - it's not because of the food. So I went here on a Friday night.  Sat outside.  Ambiance - decent.  I didn't go inside so I can't comment on the interior.  It looked nice from the outside.  The waiter/service - decent.  He seemed pretty knowledgeable about the menu and kept commenting about this and that that was imported from Puglia, Bologna, and other places in Italy.  Sounds good so far, right?   This is what we ordered - the ""special"" appetizer of the evening - zucchini blossoms (imported from Puglia I believe), lighted dusted with flour and flash fried, also filled with some sort of cheese (imported of course!), and on a light salad.  Give me a break!  It tasted just like fried zucchini sticks!  Don't get me wrong - I love a good fried zucchini stick - but don't sell it as your imported special of the evening and charge $15 for it!  Not a good start at all.  I was hoping the dinner would redeem the meal. Nope.  For dinner, my husband had the restaurant's ""signature"" pasta dish (according to our waiter), which was the Taglioline paglia e fieno (Hand-made green and yellow tagliolini with a veal and Prosciutto di Parma ragout, topped with a hard boiled quail egg and drizzled with white truffle oil).  Sounds delish.  It wasn't.  It looked like Hamburger Helper on pasta (I'm serious).  As for how it tasted - it tasted okay.  Nothing spectacular - pretty mediocre.  It tastes like a dish that your most average cook could whip up (with the help of Chef Boyardee).  I had the Tagliatelle al ragu Bolognese - a pasta dish with bolognese sauce.  It was fine.  Again, nothing spectacular and I've gotten this dish from just about every Italian restaurant I've been to in Chicago that offers it and I've definitely had much better. So there you have it.  The positives - like I said, the ambiance outside and the service were pretty good.  The pasta is homemade and it tasted fresh.  The wine we had (4 glasses total) were all good.  The negatives - umm, the food.  It wasn't terrible, but for a cook who has had recipes passed down from great great grandma from Bologna and who just moved here from Bologna about 9 years ago and who supposedly imports a lot of her items from Italy and who charges over $20 per plate of pasta (very small plates of pasta also I may add - which is fine, no one should be eating their weight in pasta - but it is really expensive for what you get), I'm expecting a lot more out of my experience.  BTW, most of their wine is pretty pricey as well. We didn't even order dessert because I didn't feel like spending another $15 on a slice of Pepperidge Farm chocolate cake.  About $150 later (4 glasses of wine, 2 pasta entrees, and one app) we left extremely dissappointed in this restaurant.  For that kind of money - I suggest you try many of the other fantastic Italian restaurants in the city (my favorite is still Riccardo Trattoria).",0.9988,0.804,0.185,0.011,0.5519564694564694

Also at our table was the osso bucco, catch of the day (sea bass), some type of veal and prosciutto pasta, and frutti de mare pasta. Everyone thought their food was excellent. Dessert was probably the best part, the panna cotta was definitely the winner but we also had gelati and tiramisu. The cuisine is Bolognese, I thought it was authentic having spent time there and am kind of surprised to see some negative reviews. Regardless if one thinks the food is great or just good, I think that the best part of this restaurant is the ambiance. It was relatively quiet, we were able to speak to each other at a table of eight with no difficulties, the wine was plentiful, and the meal was long and leisurely.

2009-10-25,1.0,"Living in the neighborhood, I have walked past Merlo on Maple many times and have always stopped to read the menu posted outside. A serious foodie, I have been to Bologna and eaten my way around Italy many times. So last night, with great expectations, we decided to go to Merlo on Maple and expected a fine dining experience.  The restaurant bills itself as ""slow food"". Great, I'm all into the concept of the right foods, farmed or raised sustainably and served in the right season. When our obnoxious server, Nate, mentioned that the dinner would take up to 25 minutes to come out of the kitchen because it was ""cooked to order, you know, slow food"". I almost laughed. Slow food does not mean slow kitchen!  The food was bland, the salads has been sitting and wilted, watering down the dressings to tasteless. My husband's osso bucco was dry (!) and served with an ice cream scoop shaped blob of undercooked risotto. Al dente might be good thing but risotto should not hold the shape of the scoop that serves it. Our friend's fish was steamed and tasteless and we had to request salt for everything.  It's galling when the special, four course prix-fixe menu is offered without a prix. And it's not a nice surprise to find that the fish of the day listed on the menu only as ""market price"" shows up on the bill for $42. Shame on us for forgetting to ask!  But back to the slow food and the jerk waiter. After listening about slow food several times, I mentioned that aspargus, strawberries and blackberries that came to the table were not appropriate in October at a restuaruant that seemingly prides it self on slow food. Oh boy, I got a dressing down about the crystal coming from Germany and the porcinis that I ordered being out of season (as if I was in the wrong for ordering them)  Um, know your menu - porcini are in season summer through autumn.  Nate the waiter obviously doesn't know his place. You may never chastise the customers in a nasty, irritated and rude tone. NEVER. However, there is a silver lining. Inspired by Merlo's seasonal gaffe of panna cotto with STRAWBERRIES (so out of season in October). I have been inspired to adapt panna cotta for the season at home tonight.  *Luisa please feel free to lift my dessert idea and place it on your November menu with my compliments.

I  wonder if it would have a better flavor if it's not cooked so long. The meat was tender but missing the taste. Perhaps adding a little more of that   saurce on plate may help the taste?

The chef is amazing with a pairing of ingredients that is perfect.  It was a little annoying but expected when my pregnant wife wanted some tomato sauce on the side to feed the craving, but the chef did not want to mess with the flavor.  It was more than made up though when she made a special side of fresh pasta in tomato sauce.",0.96,0.831,0.143,0.025,0.5451976284584981
2008-07-25,2.0,"I must admit that I'm surprised by the positive reviews of this place.  First, the good things:  --the service was prompt.  We were seated without delay, we were offered drinks as soon as we arrived and again when we were seated, and there was always someone available to answer questions.  --the wine list was extensive.  We ended up ordering a bottle of Pinot Nero, which was excellent.  But the food itself left me sorely disappointed.   For those of you unfamiliar, the style of the menu requires you to order multiple courses.  The pasta courses are not large enough to be an entree--merely an appetizer--and so you end up with high prices despite the seemingly-reasonable prices for individual items on the menu. To start, my husband and I shared a salad (the insalta misto).  The salad dressing was very strong and it overpowered the salad.  I usually get a salad before the meal because it's a light option--and this was anything but light.  For the pasta course, I had a cheese ravioli (that I no longer see on the menu).  My husband loved it and ate most of it.  I would describe it as oily.  Very very very oily.  So oily that I tried to mop up some of the oil that I could eat the ravioli.  As a result, I found it to difficult to enjoy the food under the circumstances.  My biggest complaint concerns the entree.  Upon the waiter's recommendation, I got the Fritto di pesce con carciofi e zucchine -- which are seafood fritters.  There is no way to describe these except for tasteless.  And dry.  I asked for salt.  It helped a bit.  I asked if there was any type of dipping sauce that might enhance the flavor.  They gave me a cold, tasteless marinara sauce.  I ended up eating about 1/10 of the dish and then letting him take it away.    Our bill came to a total of $632 for 4 people. My cohorts seemed to have enjoyed their food more than I did, so perhaps I just made poor menu choices.  But I was starving when we left.  And for this hefty sum, we could have gone to many a restaurant that didn't leave me wanting for more.",0.6907,0.863,0.08,0.057,0.5621150278293136

2008-06-30,4.0,"There was an article in Chicago magazine years ago about restaurants in spaces that have been converted from former residences and since I saw it, I've been meaning to try Merlo. I finally got the chance last week, and the girlfriend and I had an outstanding dinner. First the bad: the decor could use a little help. We sat in the small first floor dining room, and it had a little too much of an old school feel--more like a steak house than an upscale Italian restaurant. It was sort of private and romantic, but not much fun. I saw the downstairs room, which seemed a little better, and I've heard that the upstairs and the porch are really nice... but they were both closed. I can understand the upstairs dining room being closed, because it was a Wednesday night, but the weather was gorgeous so I'm not sure why they weren't seating outside. Aside from that, though, our experience was great. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and was pretty funny too. He also made the very helpful suggestion that if we wanted to try some things, we could split an appetizer, split a pasta and order entrees, and we'd be satisfied with the portion sizes. He was right, I'd suggest doing exactly that if you're thinking of having dinner here. The food was really tremendous, and very authentic. My lamb shank tasted a lot like the Greek version my mom makes (which I love), and it was fall-off-the-bone tender. The girlfriend was raving about her beef tenderloin several days later. I tasted it--it had tons of seasoning and was very good (but my lamb was better!). Our appetizer was balls of mozzarella wrapped in a salty prosciutto and served with asparagus and cherry tomatoes: outstanding. For the pasta, the waiter suggested the tagliatelle bolognese, which is sort of their specialty. I think I'd eat that at every meal if I could. We couldn't pick just one dessert, so we got two. I don't see either of them on the menu on their website, so I'm going to have a hard time with the actual names. The panna cotta was pretty good, but the other one was amazing. The waiter said it was an authentic tiramisu, without all the layers of whipped cream and stuff, and it did have a similar taste--creamy, coffee-laced--but it was ten times better than the tiramisu you normally get. I don't remember what they called it... something that starts with ""B"".

Located in a beautifully restored 4 story townhouse, Merlo is a pleasure to look at with its dark woodwork, banisters that shine, hardwood floors and historic prints located around.   We were seated right away in the main floor dining room which consisted of some tables and booths but still gave a feeling of intimacy with the lighting and music.  Each table gets a silver candlestick holder- something about that just felt so Italian as the white taper flickered with every passing person. We started with a couple of the appetizers- the tuna carpaccio and the artichoke salad.  The carpaccio was the true winner- thinly sliced tuna with crumbled egg, capers, fresh basil and lemon vinaigrette. Absolutely delicious! For our pasta dish- we went with the server's recco which was pasta topped with crumbled veal and cheese.  Also delicious.  The only hiccup was that the server forgot to bring it out before our entrees so we split it as a side to our entrees.  Given it was his mistake- he comped the pasta for us, which was nice and it was handled so quickly that it didn't take anything away from our dinner. Both of our entrees were perfectly prepared and so good.  I had the veal chop which was slightly pounded, breaded and served with lemons for squeezing.  My dining companion had the beef tenderloin which was so good, I couldn't figure out what it had on top of it other than a fabulous cheese. I could have eaten his whole entree- but even though I encouraged more entree ""sharing"", the look on his face as he ate each bite stopped me from asking.   Darn him- he is always a better ""orderer"" than me! As for desserts- they were both out of this world.  I had a warm chocolate cake served with whipped cream . . mmm . .I am still thinking about it.  We also had the their version of tiramasu which was also really tasty. The wine list features many Italian wines and since Italian wines are not our area of expertise we asked for some help from our server.  His suggestion was great- I only wished I had written down what we had as I would love to go out and purchase a few bottles. David, our server, was amazing.  He was attentive, knew just what to suggest to us in terms of food and wine and was never far away if we needed something.

The food was delicious and the service impeccable. We knew it was going to be good once we tried the bread and couldn't stop munching on the ""chips"". I've also never had a server so genuinely happy to be make sure your meal is going well. It was quite an experience. We had a tough time picking an appetizer but ended up going with the mozzarella, which was flavorful but not heavy, and beautifully plated. For entrees, I had the handmade spinach and potato gnocchi. It was so good it may even have one-upped my previous favorite from a place back in California (definitely in flavor, almost in texture). My boyfriend had the beef tenderloin and enjoyed it as well, although we both thought my gnocchi was really the highlight of the meal. By the way, when you order a white wine, ask the waiter for his favorite - I didn't catch the name but it's the one that's described as very crisp and it's wonderful. Don't forget to try the angel cake dessert, and you will have room because the portions are not too big. It's really their version of tiramisu and it's delicious.
