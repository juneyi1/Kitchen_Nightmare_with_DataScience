2017-07-02,5.0,Gui was my waiter. He did a fantastic job. Israel was my busser who kept my water glass full through out my whole experience. I asked their names because good service at times should be recognized. I've been here before & my go to on a hot day is the anti pasto salad. This time I also order the shrimp cocktail which was served with lots of lemon slices & cucumber. PERFECT for a hot day. I also ordered the Asparagus salad which was the special for Sunday. Every dish was good. This is a place for consistent good filling food with solid service. They aren't trying to re-invent the wheel they're making sure it always runs well & that's why I keep coming back.  Everything came out very fast. Service is noticeably strong here & better than many big name spots in the loop. Classics done right.,0.9805,0.785,0.2,0.015,0.5654682539682538

They refuse to brew iced tea.  Just refuse and couldn't care less how it annoys you.  Either drink the out of the gun swill or buy a 5 dollar bottle, period.   Two people, one glass of wine, one iced tea, 66 dollars, plus tip, nearly 80 dollars to be neglected by the waitstaff and abused.   Never again......never.  So many better options.  Go to Pearl's at 39th & Michigan, much better in every respect for less than half the money.",-0.9719,0.673,0.114,0.213,0.41111111111111115

2016-10-24,4.0,"With a special work project in the South Loop this past weekend, I thought it was an opportunity to meet with my handsome son (who works at a River North supper club) for dinner before both of us had to go to work. On a tip from a friend and some Yelp research, we decided to have dinner at Cafe Bionda since it was close to the hotel where I was staying. We arrived for our early reservation and we were promptly seated.  There was what seemed to be a very crowded baby shower going on in the large back room, so that gave me some misgivings that we'd both be waiting for service and hopefully on time for work. Those misgivings were quickly laid to rest as our server greeted us and took our drink orders while a basket of warm bread and marinara was placed on our table.  A Negroni for me and a Templeton's Rye Old Fashioned for my son, both delivered after a very short wait and both spot on. We started with the grilled calamari with red wine vinaigrette, three nice sacs and three nice tentacles in a really tasty sauce.  The warm bread was put to good use to sop up the remaining vinaigrette. For mains, my son had the lobster fettuccine with asparagus special, and I opted for the first thing that really caught my eye, the veal braciole platter.  Both dishes were excellent, and my veal was accompanied by some spaghetti in what appeared to be a vodka cream sauce.  Again, the bread was put to good use to take care of the sauce that remained. To close, my son had one more Old Fashioned and I asked for a glass of limoncello.  When I asked our server if it was house made, she replied, tongue-in-cheek, that she was sure it was made in a house somewhere, just not this one!  Great! Heading off to work, both of us satisfied, we'd surely visit Cafe Bionda again.",0.9917,0.848,0.143,0.009,0.5311621315192744

2016-10-10,2.0,First visit to Cafe Bionda was 5 years ago and it was not memorable.   Second visit was last night and it reminded me why I have not been back in 5 years.  I order the spaghetti and meatball and it was very bland. No flavor and very expensive. I don't understand how a place like this justifies their high prices.  You have to offer very good food to make it worthwhile and Cafe Bionda just doesn't cut it.   I would have been better off at Mariano's hot food bar.,0.853,0.833,0.14,0.027,0.54

The bread is forgettable & served with some overly salty marinara.  Had the worst pasta fagioli soup I've ever tasted. Barely could eat any of it.  The Bionda salad was actually pretty good, even though it was drowning in dressing.  Hubby had the rigatoni vodka sauce. Again, just ok. Nothing special.  For dessert, we split their homemade tiramisu. Meh. Very generic.  Atmosphere was lively and fun, despite being FREEZING cold. Oh, and the service was pretty bad, too.

Lots of yummy appetizers to try in the future! We had the eggplant Parmesan, the rigatoni alla vodka, and the chicken special, which was some kind of roasted garlic chicken with potatos and peppers. Yum! The eggplant came out on a giant platter and literally took up the entire dish! It was crispy on the edges, but the eggplant wasn't too thin to where you couldn't taste it. Really good. I tried the vodka pasta and it was also excellent. The pasta was cooked to perfection and the fresh ricotta on top really made it stand out.

It is expensive.  If you have 2 glasses of wine, the basic wine selections can add an additional $25 per person above the cost of your food.   Salads are also very expensive. My major complaint is that it is poorly lit - gloomy - and on a winter night it is downright depressing.  What's there is not the kind of soft light with spots on each table that lend atmosphere - rather it is cold white light - inexpensive bulbs that actually make it hard to see.

I've never felt that they have given great customer experiences but the food is okay and there aren't a lot of Italian restaurants in the area that I know of. I've tried many different items on the menu and I've even recommended them to my co workers. But this last experience turned me off. Not only was I ignored, I was belittled and disregarded because I am Black. On my lunch break I came in and made an order. The server (though she was nice) had no idea about the items on the menu and was not savvy enough to get the information or have someone explain it to me. I will never know what she was thinking but for me to be standing there insisting that I'd like more info before I order, was a turn off. After I settled for something I have had already I was told that my order would take 15 minutes. It took double the time. At no point did anyone acknowledge me to tell me it would take longer or to apologize for the inconvenience. I got my food and left... Then my order's were wrong. The receipt had the correct order though. When I called back the first time to speak to a manager they said that she was on the phone and would give me a call back. The second time I called they again said she would call me back and took my info for the second time. By the end of the business day I was back in the restaurant. Disgruntled from this entire experience and from not having eaten my $30 lunch. I walked in and asked for a manager again. When they told me she had left for the day I was shocked. I then introduced myself to the lady (who had just started her shift) shaking her hand and attempting to explain the situation. She put her hand in my face and said ""Honey I don't need your attitude"".  I immediately walked out to catch my breath because I couldn't take it anymore. I walked back in and AGAIN waited for someone to acknowledge me. Patty, a manager assisted me from there. (Now when I first walked in they said the manager had left for the day but now all of a sudden there is a manager to assist me. Where was she when the lady put her hand in my face?) She gave me her business card and told me to work with her in the future. It wasn't sincere but I accepted it, said my peace and told her that I would not be back...  Did I fail to mention that they accused me of yelling at the lady that put her hand in my face? I told them to go look at their security cameras. Or better yet they can ask the other server that was standing right there, that did NOTHING, if that was true.

The spaghetti was delicious, not too saucy, not too sweet, came with an actual spicy sausage link, and was total Italian perfection.

2014-10-14,3.0,"I used opentable to make a reservation for 6 people at 7:30pm last Friday.  My husband and my best friend were running the marathon two days later so this dinner was to serve as a celebratory carb loading dinner. We arrived at 7:20pm and walked inside to a REALLY crowded restaurant. That's great, of course, however, they have this teeny tiny little hostess stand so there is nowhere for anyone to stand while waiting for a table. We waited at the hostess stand for a few minutes before anyone came over. When they did come over, they didn't even say hello, just looked at the computer. I waited patiently. Finally, one of the women said ""Yes?"" They didn't greet us, say welcome, nothing... flat and short.  I told them about our reservation, which they quickly found, but then they said ""You're going to have to give us a minute."" So short and rude. They looked totally harried by how busy it was, which I understand, but I just arrived, I didn't do anything to add to your stress, so please don't be rude to be for absolutely no reason. We all walked over to the right and stood in a busy little hallway between bar and restaurant. The hostess came over a few minutes later and we were seated in the back of the right side of the restaurant.  Shortly after being seated, a woman came over and got our drink order. She did not introduce herself as our waitress. She delivered the drinks a few minutes later and walked away. FORTY FIVE minutes later, I asked a bus boy if we had a waitress. He rudely said, ""Yes. She delivered your drinks! What do you need her for?"" WHAT? Seriously, WHAT? I need her so we can ORDER! I just responded, ""It has been 45 minutes. We would like to order."" It was then that we realized that the woman who brought over our drinks, the bartender, was ALSO the waitress for the 6-9 tables in the room AND the entire bar! It was a FRIDAY night people!  The waitress/bartender came over a few seconds later and took our order but offered us no guidance in ordering. It was very bare minimum service. The food came out quickly. I had the stuffed shells, they looked amazing but were really salty. I wish they had been accompanied by a vegetable....or I wish the waitress had told me that they were best ordered as something for the entire table. My husband didn't like what he ordered so he didn't eat any of it--not that anyone who worked there cared and/or noticed. One of my friends ordered gnocchi in a vodka sauce and she loved it. It looked really good.  I don't know. I just felt like we paid a lot of money for crappy service. When we finished eating, the waitress/bartender came over and asked if we were finished, we all said yes. She walked away and 25 minutes later we asked her for the check. We would have ordered dessert and coffee but we were really fed up at this point. Throughout dinner, she never even asked anyone if we even wanted another drink. I know I could have used one!  Ahh. I'm getting annoyed just thinking about the whole night. Bottom line: I would try this again but only during the week in hopes that the staff will be able to keep their cool on slower nights.

Maybe the non-Italian dishes or something fancier would have been better but, hey is it unreasonable for me to expect them to nail the basics? At the prices on their menu (no entree under $15 and very few under $20) I certainly expect a lot better than what I had. The stuffed shells ($19) doesn't even make sense. It is essentially a huge plate of cheese. Don't get me wrong, I LOVE cheese, but this was just crazy.... Jumbo shells filled way too much with boring, barely seasoned ricotta, then covered in a vodka cream sauce (yay... more cheese...) and topped with a ridiculous amount of mozzarella (because cheese). There was absolutely no presentation of the food either. It was served on an oblong, roughed up off-white plate and just looked like an angry lunch lady ladled it on. It was sooooo monotonous and a huge chore to eat. I ate half just for something to do and the other half was wrapped up and the multiple attempts that have been made to eat it at home (because $$$) have been mostly unsuccessful.  It wasn't a good dish served poorly, it was a bad dish. I always thought Gordon Ramsay was being crazy picky about stuff on his myriad shows but I get it now. Chefs sometimes have terrible ideas. This was one of them.  My recommendation to Cafe Bionda on this dish... 1) spinach in the ricotta or at least some (more?) fresh herbs. 2) a very fresh, simple marinara would have made this a LOT better. vodka sauce is not the answer. 3) don't stuff the shells that much. do a google image search of stuffed shells. no one is stuffing them that much. and bland stuffing is the last thing anyone wants more of!

Was smothered in cheese, way to much. 5   people $300.00 before tip, so not worth it.  I would have given it one star but the steak was good.

I arrived first and was greeted by the hostess who clearly doesn't love her job and has a nasty attitude, ""Ummm, I don't see a reservation for so-and-so. I have one for Amy, John, Renee."" My straight faced response said to her, ""That's not the name I said so what purpose does it serve to rattle off everyone else's name?"" She just looked at me, no word on whether they were too busy to accommodate a party of two, no apology for the mix up, nada. THEN she walked away. WTH! Another party of two walks in, she comes back to the stand, asks if they are walk-ins, grabs two menus and is about to seat them! Hold the heck up!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I'm honestly on my best behavior so I keep calm but step up like ""Hi there, remember me, party of two, missing reservation, you weren't just about to seat those two walk-ins ahead of me were you?"" The manager is standing there at this point, like no, we'll take care of you. The hostess trying to save face was like ""of course I was going to seat you first, you were here first."" Don't try to be cute now... I couldn't keep quiet and said, in front of her manager, still in a calm tone tho ;-) ""oh really, because you just motioned to them without even acknowledging me and the reservation mix up. But thanks for tending to me first, I appreciate it."" And there were MAD tables in the back. Unnecessary delays and rudeness. Sheesh. She seats me in a corner, I move to the middle. No mention of who my server will be, no enjoy your meal, nada. If my friend hadn't picked this place I would have left. Not to mention she was late so I had no motivation to give this restaurant a shot at this point. Guy was the name of our server (spelled differently but I can't remember how). He seemed a little awkward in the beginning... like he interrupted our conversation a couple of times to see if we were ready or wanted this or that. That's not a bad thing of course because he was attentive, but his approach was bit off-kilter. The turnaround. He provided good input on the menu and made suggestions on some of the tweaks I wanted. I ordered the Rigatoni Alla Vodka and added spicy crumbled sausage. Best decision ever and I thank Guy for co-signing on my choice! The food was FANTASTIC. It came in such a large portion and it did not disappoint. I enjoyed my leftovers equally as much the next day! My friend ordered the whole chicken... yup... a WHOLE chicken. The presentation was kind of like whoa... messy in a way. They literally split the chicken in half and spread it on a large oval plate. I tasted it though and it was very tender and flavorful.  Bottom line: I would absolutely ORDER OUT from here again. The food was yummy!! I would be very reluctant, however, to dine in again. A friend suggested eating at the bar instead... perhaps that would help with the restaurant experience.  Tip: You get a sizable portion of bread and tomato marinara sauce when you're seated... save some bread to dip in your pasta!!!  Tip: There's a parking lot in the back.

2014-05-11,2.0,"I'll start with the good.  The marinara sauce is delicious, and the rest of the classic Italian American food is mostly correctly prepared and tasty. The neighborhood bar/mid-20th century Italian ethnic vibe (hints of ""American Hustle"") can be cool if you are in the mood. But only in its way, and not if the food is this pricey.  We had an early reservation, and even though there were plenty of open tables on the restaurant side, we were seated in the bar -- music from a pop radio station, TV on, people having drinks and yelling, typical bar atmosphere.  We were in a good mood, rolled with it, had a bottle of wine.  The food was good, except for the terrible bread, and the portions are big. But once you add on the up charge for a vegetable to complement the main dish -- it otherwise comes entirely plain -- the bill came to $30 for chicken parmigiana and a little grilled asparagus. Plus the wine was much more expensive than it is in even excellent Italians elsewhere in town ($38 for the cheapest bottle on the list). I don't mind spending money on food, but it has to feel justified, and it bugged me to pay $60 a person (without appetizers or coffee and with only one desert) for such a ""meh"" meal. All in all, the food was fine, I'd go back regularly if the price point was right for the atmosphere and the simple Italian American food. But as it is, you can eat MUCH better in Chicago for the price, and I left the meal with a little aftertaste of ripoff.",0.9485,0.904,0.083,0.013,0.45207900207900203

2014-04-02,4.0,"I've always wanted to try Cafe Bionda since it was close to where we live and seemed to have pretty decent reviews on yelp. We finally got the chance to try them out two weeks ago to celebrate our parents anniversary. Our reservation was for 6:30pm on a Saturday and we had been a little worried that parking might be a problem. But, we got lucky and found a spot in the parking lot out back. Others from our group found parking on the street. It also looks like they have valet parking for those who do not want to search for a spot on their own. We walked in through the entrance from the back of the restaurant. We saw a couple of waiters who just glanced at us, but none attempted to direct us to where the hostess was. After looking around the crowded place for a bit, we finally figured out where the front desk was located. We had reservations, so we didn't have to wait long to get seated. The ambiance was lively and pretty upbeat with constant chatter....what you would expect at an Italian restaurant. It would be a bit noisy for intimate conversation, but our family was fine with it and the kids loved that they did not have to whisper through dinner.  We had the zucchini/calamari combo as well as the steamed mussels for appetizers. All of us loved the fried combo...crunchy, light and seasoned just right. We would have ordered another one if we weren't afraid that we wouldn't finish our entrees later on! The mussels were only ok though. The meat was not tender and didn't taste all that fresh. The wine sauce that it came with was just ok. A bit on the salty side. Definitely could not compare to the mussels from Cafe Iberico. After a wait (they were pretty busy that evening), our food finally came out. My Gnocchi Romano was delicious! The gnocchi was soft with just the right amount of chew and the sauce was not overly thick and seasoned very well. I could have done without the peas, but the mushrooms were really good and the  spicy sausage gave the dish a kick. My kids shared a spaghetti and meatball dish which they both said was yummy. My youngest normally isn't the biggest fan of marinara sauces, but he actually asked for a second helping! Others in the group also seemed to really enjoy the food. I had a bite of my mom's veal marsala and it was tasty and tender! The only gripe was that it may have come with a bit too much sauce.  I also had a bite of the linguini with shrimp and broccoli and let me tell ya, the shrimps were pretty big! The linguini could have used a slightly bit more salt & pepper, but in all it was a nice light dish. My sister's chicken parmigiana and my bro-in-law's Linguine Vongole (baby clams) both got thumbs up. You should have seen the amount of baby clams in the Vongole dish. The chicken was also perfectly cooked and tender. The salads we ordered (the baby arugula and one other which I forgot) were pretty huge! four people can probably share one as a side.  We had brought in our own cake, so ended up not trying any of their desserts.  All in all, a great place for a decent Italian meal down near the south loop area. Plate sizes are decent, service was also decent tho I think it would've been nice to see more jovial/friendly wait staff. They all looked a bit on the sad side and some were a bit huffy. The owner/manager did come by our table to check and see how we were doing and said a few words to us which was nice.  I would definitely go back and would recommend others to at least try the place. Not mind-blowing, but you'll not have to worry about not being full and prices are decent.",0.9989,0.814,0.168,0.018,0.5836931216931216

I should have went with more of a traditional Italian dish.  My boyfriend ordered the Veal Braciole Platter which is Meatball, sausage, veal braciole, all simmered in homemade marinara.  He was also disappointed, and both of these dishes were top recommendations by our server... another disappointment.  We also ordered the Zucchini & Calamari Combo - 1/2 zucchini, 1/2 calamari, which is pretty hard to mess up.  It was decent.  The bread and red sauce is great here but when we asked for another basket the server kind of gave us a weird look like we were obese people eating too much.   For dessert, we ordered the chocolate cake with really good banana fudge gelato.  Afer we demolished this dish, the server ask if we would like some bread to soak up the rest of the dish.  WTF!?  If he was trying to be funny, he wasn't... in fact it was just rude and annoying.

2013-07-07,4.0,Since it was a nice night my boyfriend and I decided to sit outside. The service was excellent. Our waitress had a very bubbly personality.  For appetizer we got a half order of the baked clams. Very delightful. A lot of italian places don't offer them so I always get them. I was not disappointed with them. I ordered the stuffed shells. I absolutely loved the cream sauce. Very tasty & not overpowering. The ricotta filling had a very smooth texture. The dish came baked. It isn't in the description on the menu so I was a little alarmed. I am not the biggest fan of copious amounts of cheese so I just scraped most of it to the side. Overall a very excellent dish. I don't normally eat a entire dish but I couldn't resist this time. My boyfriend had the Nanna's Gravy. I had a bite and oh my goodness was it excellent! The pot roast was so tendered and had the perfect amount of seasoning. Later in the meal a woman came in with her two dogs and was letting them roam round the patio seating. A little inconsiderate since she let them off a leash. Overall we had a very pleasant dining experience.,0.983,0.801,0.168,0.031,0.5496527777777778

2013-07-01,2.0,"We went for lunch at 1 pm on a Monday.   The hostess was friendly and mentioned they had a new computer system.  We were the only table on the patio and it took the waiter a good ten minutes to greet us.  When he did greet us, it was as if we were a hassle to him.  There was no space in the restaurant, so the excuse that he was running in and out could not be used.   He took our order after we flagged him down and didn't write anything down but repeated it to us.  We were basically ignored by him, but the busboy was very friendly and refilled our waters and chatted with us.   After about 45 minutes, the waiter came out and blamed the computer problems and asked us to re-confirm our food order.  There was no what can I get you or I'm so sorry, but attitude.  After an hour, I ended up going inside and asking what the deal with the food was.  He said it would only be a few more minutes and again blamed the computer problems. I work in the service industry and if there is computer problems, you write the ticket out the old-fashioned way and make sure the kitchen gets the order.  After a few more minutes, I went in and again, no apologies, but instead, your food is just coming up if you can wait a few more minutes.  At that point, my friend was late for a meeting and we were just not interested in paying $16 each for a meal we had to wait over an hour for.  If the waiter did not have so much attitude, I think we would have been okay with an apology and the food will be out as soon as possible.  Instead, we got ignored and we got attitude when we did inquire about our food. A smile and an apology go a long way, but I am not paying $20 for a lunch when the server hates his job and couldn't care less if we come back.  This place is getting two stars because the busboy and the host were so friendly to us.   I know this place is good because I have heard friends rave about it, but you gotta get rid of the waiter.  Bad service kills a place.  It doesn't matter how good the food is.  If it's served with a side of b/s, then I won't spend my money there.",-0.9248,0.783,0.097,0.12,0.45982404692082096

The place was a bit noisy.  Not sure if it was the location that we were sat.  It's an open kitchen which is cool to me.  The complimentary bread and marinara sauce was astounding!!!!  You could really taste the freshness and that it was homemade. I could just make a meal of that!  :)  We had the calamari calabrese. It was really tasty. Very spicy!  We like that!  It would have been good with a dipping sauce maybe. Also it was slightly over cooked (very close to rubbery).  Due to reviews of portion size we split an entree (I had gastric bypass 1 1/2 years ago).  We got the rigatoni alla vodka. We added crumbled sausage which was super hearty and delicious.  Tiramisu for dessert was really good.  I've had better but this still did the trick. :)  The half bottles of wine was a nice touch and came out to about 3 glasses...so a savings.  :)  The server was nice.  Not overly friendly. Some of the staff seemed stiff.  Overall I would go back to this place.  Really yummy!,0.9918,0.792,0.197,0.011,0.5280381944444444

Im not a fan of soggy skin. And honestly they could have done without dousing it in sauce, it was too much. But I mean its an italian restaurant so I guess thats how a lot of entrees are done.

Loved it.  The sauce, the potatoes, the peppers - YES!  My pork chop was slightly dry but just barely...and it was so amazingly flavorful that I can overlook that.   We finished with the molten chocolate cake with pistachio gelato and my gosh...I wish I'd gotten my own instead of sharing 1 with the table.  I'm not even a chocolate freak but God Almighty...LOVE IT.   I really love this spot and look forward to coming back soon!",0.9956,0.766,0.234,0.0,0.6719135802469135
2013-01-24,4.0,"Cafe Bionda is a great spot for Italian on the near South Side if you want to avoid Little Italy or Taylor Street. This unassuming place was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise. They had a huge menu as well as several specials. Everything sounded so mouthwatering that I had a hard time deciding. The bread and marinara delivered to your table as soon as you sit down is a good portent of the delicious things that await you. My friend and I shared a lot of food: eggplant rotolo, arugula salad, grilled calamari and pork chops with banana peppers. Everything was delicious, perfectly seasoned, and the portions were generous, but not ridiculously-sized.  I was especially enamored with the arugula salad; it was probably the best I've had. It's pretty much my ideal salad, and it's a testament to the sheer power of a few fresh ingredients and simplicity. The rest of the food was spot-on: the pork chops were juicy and a little spicy from the banana peppers and came with potato wedges; the calamari was served in a light balsamic vinaigrette and was wonderfully tender, and the eggplant rotolo was like the best version of eggplant parmesan, but with ricotta and rolled up--so good! Cafe Bionda looks like it has a lot of regulars. Everyone seemed to know each other judging by all the lively conversations at the bar.  I also appreciated the service; our waitress could tell that we wanted to be left alone and not rushed (I hadn't seen this friend in 15 years so we had a lot of catching up to do!) and she paced our food accordingly.

2012-12-29,4.0,"Let me start at the end: My wife and I, visiting Chicago for the new year's weekend, enjoyed our dinner quite a bit. She had the grilled calamari with fra diavolo sauce, and I had the stuffed shells -- with the fra diavolo sauce as well after the kitchen agreed to let me substitute that sauce for the vodka cream sauce. Our server (Mallory?) was friendly and attentive. It was nice for my gluten-free eating wife that they had GF pasta. So I can see why this is a very popular neighborhood place.  I deduct one star, however, because of the way our visit began, which still sticks in my craw: we walk in at barely 6 pm, the place is not crowded yet, and the two young women at the front of the house ask if we have reservations. No, we say--oops. I would have, but my phone battery was under 10% so I wasn't able to. We came from the Field Museum in a cab on a sudden decision. I don't think we looked like slobs, but we were just met with disdain. We were initially offered (only) a ""hightop"" table in the bar area right by the front door. We resisted politely and so instead wound up at a table in the very back corner of the back dining room, which was nice--but the room was more than half empty at the time and for a while after that, so what was all that about on our entrance? Why did we have to negotiate for a respectable table? And the same front-door staff, on our way out, didn't thank us or anything like that. So, nice place, but because of the reception, we would not likely return. (We discovered upon leaving and subsequently from Yelp that there is a very popular Thai spot a few doors away.) Oh, PS, I would also deduct half a star if I could for the television in the back dining room. But this is a pet peeve of mine: what is it about restaurants anymore that they'll put so much attention into their menu, into their cooking, into the style of their place, and then dumb it down with a television (and usually with sports on it). OK, so there was an Illinois team in a bowl game, but no one was watching anyway. Is it a nice Italian restaurant or is it a sports bar?

I had the orecchiette, sausage and rapini in garlic olive oil sauce. It was ok that night, but the leftovers were divine! Seriously, the flavors developed a little more and I ended up eating the first helping of leftovers for breakfast. Portions were so huge that I ate off the leftovers twice in addition to the huge amount I consumed at dinner. One friend got the gnocchi.... probably the best I've ever tasted. Seriously light, puffy clouds of goodness in a tomato cream sauce. The clam pasta was just ok so my friend said. I'm not a seafood pasta girl so I can't judge fairly on that one.

2012-05-07,4.0,"This is a cute little spot.  I feel like before the South Loop change-over/ Apple-ification, this was a gritty area with some small, neighborhood joints that were known neighborhood joints that the neighborhood boys went to for alotta liquor and food and the neighborhood girls went to smoke and drink and laugh gruffly at the boys for being stupid.  And, although the neighborhood changed, I don't think too much has changed at Bionda except that the boys and girls aged and the drinking and smoking has taken their tolls. But the food, right?  Big plates and yummy and somewhat a la carte.  I had the sausage with peppers and ordered 2 sides: some rapini and 2 big ole meatballs.  My friend ordered the chicken parm and a separate side order of pasta.  The server said, ""You don't need the pasta.""  We both looked at her like, ""WTF kinda comment is that?!""  Then she followed up with, ""The chicken parm is the size of a large dinner plate.  It can feed 3 people.  You'll be full before the pasta gets here.""  My friend, not one to be told what to do, ordered the chicken parm and a side of pasta anyway.  The server was right; the chicken parm is HUGE, much like the rest of their portions.  The meatballs were the size of baseballs; the rapini was a small hill of greens with a lot of garlic; the sausages were fighting with the peppers trying to stay on the plate.  It was a gluttonous amount of food.  And it was delish!  The wine is good too! It reminded me of a restaurant that would be in a movie about Italian mafia/mobsters/gangsters.  The atmosphere is dark and cozy.  The servers and bartenders are really laidback and familiar with people.  The owner comes around to the tables at times.  Overall, it was a good evening.",0.9703,0.86,0.108,0.032,0.5316666666666666

2012-03-05,4.0,"Cafe Bionda pulled off a lovely Valentine's Day dinner service, including presenting a rose to each female guest. Super cheesy but I soooo loved it .  First (and best!) thing about Cafe Bionda - they serve marinara sauce to dip your delicious Italian bread in. Extra Virgin Olive Oil is also offered, but who doesn't want amazing, parmesan cheese topped warm marinara sauce with bread?! I was completely sold on this restaurant after the bread and sauce was presented.  The salad are more than enough for 2 people to share, which is great as long as you and your date can agree on a salad. Fortunately, the bf and I enjoy enough similar things and we settled on the arugula salad which was fresh and delicious. As for the second best thing about Cafe Bionda (close second to the bread & marinara) - their crumbled sausage. Order one of their pasta dishes with their crumbled Italian sausage and you will be able to die a happy person. It's that good. Particularly (and unexpectedly) delicious is the Orecchiette Sausage, which is presented with a garlic white wine/EVOO sauce and somehow manages to feel light even though it's pasta and Italian sausage. I tend to hate leftover pasta and this was even better the next day.  The service at Cafe Bionda is a little bit spotty. If they could just improve this aspect a small amount, this would be a no questions asked 5 star restaurant.... but many small things added up to a somewhat odd service. Our server took our drink orders, and when he came back and presented our drinks, he took our salad order. A runner brought out our salad about 6-8 minutes later, which was nice (and speedy!). No one returned to take our entree order for about 20 minutes, which was weird/annoying. After we did place our entree orders, the dishes came out in about 12-15 minutes, so it was quite quick. So we weren't really waiting an egregious amount of time, the service just seemed a bit odd. The other glaring issues is that a bus boy/runner cleared my bread dish when I was clearly using it no less than 3 times. I literally had to ask a server for a new bread plate THREE TIMES, because it was snatched off the table before I could even get a peep out of my mouth. Again, that is just weird.  My boyfriend has been a longtime lover of Cafe Bionda and he just may have converted me into a lifer at this establishment as well. Excellent date spot, and amazing food.

2011-06-18,4.0,"The only reason Bionda's is not getting 5 starts is because the last time I went there (last night 6/17/11) we waited FOREVER to sit and then get our food.  We went to Bionda's at around 8:00 pm on a Friday night and then had to wait for 30 minutes to sit. (We didn't have a reservation so totally our fault) Then once we sat down we ordered our appetizers right away.  There were 4 of us (one being a vegetarian) and we split the stuffed peppers and fried zucchini. It took them approximately 30 minutes for the apps to get to our table. Our waiter said the kitchen was backed up and profusely apologized for the delay but c'mon, 30 minutes for two apps? That's a bit ridiculous.  Well - that is my ONLY complaint about this place (and to be fair, this is the ONLY time I have ever had this problem -usually they cooking is prompt and fast). Well lets just say once the food came out my parents could not stop raving about how amazing everything was.  My mother is a vegetarian and has been her entire life so she has eaten a lot of marinara in pastas.  At the beginning of the meal, the waiter brings you hot bread with a marinara sauce to dip the bread in.  I believe my mother's exact words were ""OMG - this is the best marinara I have ever tasted in my entire life.""  The sauce has a little bit of spice and you can tell it is made with fresh tomatoes.  DELICIOUS!! Once our appetizers hit the table, they were gone in about 15 seconds.  The stuffed peppers are divine.  The sausage they use to stuff them is soooo good. Just a little bit of spice and kick. Plus the sauce they are in - yummy! Make sure to soak whatever bread you have left in it.  The fried zucchinni was so good and hot and fresh.  My mother couldn't stop eating them.  I must say, I hated waiting for the apps but they were worth the wait.  After our apps we split two salads between the 4 of us.  My boyfriend and I split the Baby Arugula salad which has an EVOO dressing with some parmesean and cracked pepper and tomatoes. Delicious. My parents split the Bionda Salad which has everything and the kitchen sink in it - hearts of palm, tomatoes, garbanzo beans, celery, pepperocinis etc. etc. etc. They were both delicious and HUGE.  One salad is definitely perfect to split between two people. Finally - the main courses. YUM YUM YUM!! My boyfriend and I split the special which was Porkchops Saltimbocca. We got two 10 oz. porkchops served over whole wheat rigatoni (available upon request) wrapped in prosciutto and cheese.  Very good. My mom got the stuffed shells which are smothered in cheese, stuffed with cheese and then have the oh so divine marinara sauce. Finally, my father, the most picky eater and biggest complainer of food ever got the orichetti with sausage, rapini and chili flakes. He loved it. Absolutely loved it. And thats saying something - this morning he was still raving about how it was the best meal he'd ever eaten and that he could eat the orichetti once a week for the rest of his life and be happy.  Let me tell you - a saying like that from my father is hard to come by.  Its the ultimate compliment.    So all in all, despite the slow service, the evening was excellent and the food divine. Bionda's never disappoints.  I can't wait to go back.",0.999,0.764,0.2,0.036,0.6277972446840373

2011-04-18,1.0,"I went here for lunch today. I had to run another errand and realized I didn't know what I had at home. I thought I'd pick up a sandwich to go. I came in at 12:00 and ordered a Chick Parmesan. I was told it would take 10 minutes. It took 27.  The chefs kept walking in and out of the kitchen and were talking to each other quite a bit. I also noticed that two other take out orders were being prepared in addition to mine. The chefs repeatedly finished the sandwiches significantly earlier than the fries. This might not always be a problem. When you order a chicken parm this is a serious issue. The sandwich was mediocre to begin with, but given that I watched it sit on the counter for about five minutes . The flavor wasn't there to begin with, but the crusting and bread was soggy by the time I ate it. (It took two minutes to get home, I live right around the corner). The fries were completely limp and soggy. I think that the chefs were trying to compensate for their very long delay and extremely poor timing by pulling them before they crisped.  The great thing about an open kitchen is that it creates a sense of confidence in the consumer. It did look clean, but I could see the fries being dropped well after the sandwich made it's way to the counter. I could see the chefs chatting and the generally slow service.  If this isn't enough to deter you and you wind up at Bionda anyways take a look at the ceiling. It's pretty horrible.",0.9095,0.857,0.094,0.049,0.6317989417989418

Not good. BF ordered the Sunday special, which is on the menu and also on the list of specials on the table. When my BF ordered the ""Sunday Gravy"" the waiter was like ""Huh?"". We had to tell him that it was the Sunday special and he was like ""Uh, ok"". Anyway, it was totally disgusting! It is sauce cooked with ribs and neckbones....I get that this makes it tasty, but the dish was served as a bowl halfway filled with bones! There was absolutely NO meat on the bones at all, and they were totally gross looking....the sauce was not very tasty, and the pasta was the same overcooked rigatoni that I was served! BF didn't eat hardly any of it (but is not one to complain). Nobody checked on us to see if everything was ok or I would have told them about the mushy pasta and nasty bowl of bones! The Bionda salad really is quite good, and large enough for 2 to split generously, and I do love the bread with marinara served when you sit down. The place was like 100 degrees when we got there, and I have experienced this there before...the heating system is messed up, as is the ventilation system...the place was filled up with smoke from the kitchen to the point of making my eyes water last night. I'm sure I will be back here sometime...I should probably try the meatball salad that everyone raves about, and the Nanna's Gravy really is delicious (but next time I would specify that I want the large rigatoni.

2011-02-28,2.0,"i was generally disappointed with my experience at cafe bionda, which is sad for me because in the first five minutes of being seated i told my dining partner 'this is promising to be really nice!'. the atmosphere is comfortable and un-pretentious, and the dining area is actually very big but sectioned off by the kitchen, etc, giving it a more intimate feel. unfortunately our waiter had room for improvement. in between courses he would make a comment about us not keeping our utensils, then take our silverware and plop it on the tablecloth. they were used and covered in red sauce and whatnot, and dirtied everything and got everywhere. bringing us new silverware would obviously have been a better alternative. worse yet, he was very loud and obnoxious to the point where he would stand in the middle of the dining room and honestly yell for more water to be brought to the tables, yell orders out, etc. it was unprofessional, jarring, and rude. the eggplant starter was fine but nothing memorable. what i will remember was the plate of cold sand (baked clams). we ordered the clams with our entree and they had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp for a while, as the sauce had a thick film and the bread crumbs were mushy and clams were cold. they were SO dirty... i was chewing on sand bits with every bite. we didn't say anything to the waiter for fear he would yell at us, too....  entrees were average, but not-so-average portions. huge huge portions! i have enough for 2 meals more.. if i wanted to eat it 2 more times. chicken sultambocca had no sage and was overly covered in their red sauce, which is tasty, but masked the flavor of the chicken and prosciutto. my gnocchi was hot and very good, but i am unconvinced the gnocchi is 'home made' as they claim.  disappointed in everything so far, we opted out of their desserts. i heard someone ask the same waiter for a dessert menu and he walked by saying (loud enough for everyone in the dining room to hear him) 'there is no menu!'.

I made a reservation for 6:30 and we arrived on time, but it took us until 6:45 to be seated.  We were given a table in the back, next to the back door and the kitchen.  There was something wrong with the ventilation system so one of the doors to the outside has to be kept open and every time someone came in or out (which was a lot) the cold wind would blow in.  The kitchen was incredibly noisy, but in terms of complaints for the night, that was at the bottom. They bring out bread with warm marinara sauce and Parmesan when you are seated.  The marinara was good, but the bread was cold...not room temperature...cold. After another 15 minutes the waiter showed up and took our order.  I chose the Veal Marsala and my gf ordered the Chicken Milanese.  We also ordered a side of asparagus. It took a good 30 minutes for the food to show up, and when it did both of our meals were cold.  Granted her chicken came with a full sized arugala salad on it, but still well below what I would call room temperature.  The milanese was burnt all around the edges and when i tried it, that's all I could taste.  My marsala might have been better hot, but since it was cold, it was average at best.  The asparagus were some of the largest I had ever seen and were cooked well, but they were so loaded with pepper, they were close to inedible.  I can still taste it in my mouth. So why didn't we say something to the waiter?  Well, probably because from when he took our order to an hour later when I flagged him down we never saw him.  At that point, we were both cold and frustrated so we ordered a piece of tirimasu to go and the check.  Remarkably, we got the check in under 2 minutes.  The fastest service of the night. This is probably me just being annoyed, but you know how you are always handed your bill in one of those black leather things...we'll I was just handed the receipt.  I know.. minor, but still.

The lasagna - I could tell that this would be really, really good - at 5 pm - which is when it probably first came out of the oven.  We ordered the lasagna at around 8 pm.  It was definitely not warmed all the way through.  There was also a layer of fresh cheese on top, which was sadly hiding the old layer of fresh cheese, which was burned and rubbery.  Not so appetizing.  We mentioned it to the waitress, and she took it off the check, but I would expect more for a slightly upscale Italian restaurant.

The noise level was high. Very mature crowd (i.e. late twenties to late forties). The menu reads like an edited version of Maggiano's. Surprisingly, the food was better than one might expect. The complimentary bread that arrives is room temperature and unmemorable but is augmented by the accompanying tomato sauce (marinara?). The fried calamari ($12) appetizer was enjoyable. Nice, thick rings and tentacles pieces. Batter not falling off the squid. The entrees are large enough to share (e.g. full size at Maggiano's or The Cheesecake Factory). I liked the chicken marsala ($18) but not enough to order it again. The kitchen used too much thickener in the sauce, and I suspect the mushrooms came from a can...Other restaurants make this dish better. The crispy whole boneless chicken with roasted potato wedges ($21) was great. Nicely browned skin. Tons of herbs on the exterior. Not dry. Just as good, if not better, than the whole roasted chicken at Francesca's on Taylor Street. I'd order this again. Service was efficient. The hostesses seemed overwhelmed, and it was twenty-five minutes after my reservation time before I got seated. Small waiting area/bar and the restaurant layout feels tight.

The wait for the food was quite long (much longer than you would expect for a weekday night). I can't imagine how long it would take for a packed night.  Also, you need to talk rather loudly here or you won't be heard.  I'm not sure if its the layout of the tables or the layout of the whole restaurant but its oddly kind of hard to hear each other sometimes yet you can hear the next table's conversations really clearly.

2010-04-28,4.0,"Cafe Bionda, mmm-mmm delicious! Came here with my brother and a friend for a business meeting and the food was great! Here's the breakdown: Atmosphere: When you walk in, the first impression you get is very intimate, or at least that is what I got. The restaurant is very lowly lit with dimmed lights and candles. While I did not pay much attention to decor, the restaurant is not big at all and some tables are close together, again which brings me to the intimate feeling.  Service: We had Lisa as our server and she was just absolutely great! Great sense of humor and was able to carry a great conversation with our table! In addition, she was able to recommend several great dishes to the table Food: We started with their Bionda salad, which was great! Made with some very fresh ingredients and wasn't drenched in crazy amounts of vinaigrette dressing, always a good thing in my book. The bread with the marinara sauce was a good change to just bread and butter. We scarfed down, I think, 5 baskets of bread. We had Lisa recommend several dishes. My friend had the spicy clam fettuccine, my brother had the crispy chicken or something, and I had Nanna's Gravy (sp?) While I did not try my friends food or my brothers, my pasta was great! The slow cooked pot roast was soo moist and full of flavors that I wish I didn't eat it all first, before the pasta. I was unable to eat more than 1/4 of the bowl - maybe it was due to the fact that I had eaten a ridiculous amount of bread - and had to take the rest home. Let me tell you this, this pasta tastes GREAT as a left over. While I was watching Dexter, this pasta made for good company! Price & Portion: While I believe Bionda is a little pricer than most Italian restaurants that I've gone to, their prices are more than reasonable! The portions are large enough for even the biggest of eaters, especially with their fast bread and marinara refill! Bionda left me in an almost food coma state, a good and bad thing.  Overall: Bionda is a great little spot! The people are really friendly and the food is very flavorful. The only downside is that it does take a while for the food to be prepared, but it's not a problem if you're with great company.

I shouldn't, I couldn't, I won't. . . and in the name of that our crazy family opened the door to Cafe Bionda and plunged into cozy comfort. It's interior induces a similar experience to the heft of a down comforter on a dreary day. Warm, dark, incapacitating. Because you will be so full, not just with food but experience too, that moving is a touch slow when you finally. . .FINALLY, leave.

I've had calamari up, down and sideways like a long-term relationship and this was top tier ovals. No rubberbands, as so many restaurants are guilty of. Bionda does seafood right as was evidenced by my sister-in-law ordering the grouper and the rest of us lamenting our (totally delicious) choices for the rest of the night. Bitch took those leftovers back to Kalamazoo too. *resentful* In true family style, we passed and ooh'd and aah'd with each fork full.

There was heat rising from the dishes and from the conversation (""Mom, we think you might be an alcoholic"") but in concert with chianti it was all dim and delightful.

We got there on a Friday night and made ourselves comfy at the bar since we expected much more of a wait, but we were pleasantly surprised.  For an appetizer the fried zucchini was amazing!!! Better than the already good breaded and lightly fried zucchini was the Dijon dipping sauce which was so yummy! Their bread was good with the marinara sauce, but I prefer places where the bread is warm so this was just ok in my book. Everyone was pleased.  I ordered the Stuffed Cheese shells in the vodka sauce which was yummy. It was almost on the too rich side and I only made it through a shell. I also tried the Veal Parm - you literally get this giant plate of meat. Tender. The best part: these made excellent leftovers. I think I liked my stuffed shells better the next day.

We were scheduled to go on a party cruise, so we arrived for dinner early around 5:30.  The restaurant had one table seated, and the rest were empty. When I told the hostess that it was my birthday celebration, my goddaughter and I were escorted to the back exit, to a table by the door, which was cold, rainy and windy. My goddaughter told them we didn't want to sit there, and they put us in a dark corner. Can you imagine spending your birthday in a dark corner? I mentioned it again to the waiter. He did offer another table in the back, but by that time I was very annoyed. Our dinner was good and our server was polite. When it was time for dessert, I asked if I would have a choice of a birthday choice. His response was because of ECONOMY they no longer give complimentary desserts to birthday celebrations.

And that was no easy feat given how busy this place was.  We chose to sit inside but there are several small tables out front on the sidewalk as well lending to the tratorria feel.  Our server was great- chatting about the food like she loved it all and clearly articulating the specials of the day and letting us know that the portion sizes were large so we could share if we wanted.  She quickly got out cocktail order and then steered us to some very tasty appetizers; grilled calamari (VERY good and a huge portion), caprese salad (fresh summery tomatoes) antipasti plate with meats and cheeses, and an arugula salad. All were tasty and when sampled with the Italian bread and tomato and cheese sauce- our night was off to a great start.  For entrees- I went with the fish special of the night which was Grouper Vesuivio style. Loved every bite. My dining companion went with the Sunday Platter which had the biggest piece of Italian sausage I have seen in awhile along with Braciole all in a red sauce. The only criticism of the night was that the red sauce lacked a depth of flavor that one would expect. The couple with us also had two of the other specials of the day. The pounded pork tenderloin with peas in a cream sauce was obviously delicious as it was gone in a flash and the shrimp special was equally good.  Hard to believe that there was room for dessert after all of that but we had to share the molten chocolate cake for dessert. Firm on the outside with a melted chocolate center and lots of cream topping- it was a good thing we had to stroll a ways to get to the stadium to walk off some of the indulgences!  The wine list was also good- allowing us to pick a nice Pinot Noir that went perfectly with all our food. And our water glasses were never empty nor was our server ever very far away.  All in all a great night out- that started at a little Cafe on the south side. Cafe Bionda è molto buona. Fino al nuovo . . . . . . Ciao!",0.9982,0.774,0.205,0.022,0.5295063879210221

So I ordered the Nanna's gravy dish which is rigatoni with a homemade tomato sauce and pot roast meat (like literally two hunks of meat on top of your pasta). I don't know if it was just because I ravenously had downed a whole loaf of bread with that same tomato sauce before, but I was kinda disappointed.  It did taste better the next day when I had it for leftovers.  However, my friend got the vodka pasta which was really creamy and delicious. They put a huge whollop (is that a word.. do i mean dolop?) of marscapone in the center of the dish which you mix in the sauce. The chicken dishes are huge and are just a big plate of chicken. LIke the chicken parmigiana is like a huge plate of just that. Same with the eggplant parmigiana.  It looked yummy though.

We had four drinks between us, a shared veggie side, and a shared gelato dessert.  The bill was $112 without tip.  That's a reasonable price if the food was good.  It wasn't. The portions were huge (family size, seriously), but swimming in fake-tasting, too salty gravy.  We had a few bites and left the rest.  The gelato was completely tasteless.  It reminded me of Junkit, if any of you readers are old enough to remember that stuff from our kindergarten years. It was also noisy (but no less so than other South Loop places such as Zapatista) and crowded.  I was pushed in at an awkward angle against a wall and my husband had an seat that everyone who passed (the waiters frequently) brushed by.  We did have opportunities to complain (the waiter asked after we'd taken our first bites and the manager stopped by at the end of the meal).  But the fact that we left our food almost untouched wasn't questioned.  We knew we were never coming back, and we knew we'd have a chance to warn others via Yelp, so we avoided raising our blood-pressures by complaining.

2009-01-27,3.0,"I would give Cafe Bionda 3.5 stars, and this is why....  I went to Cafe Bionda for the first time last night with a group of friends. In total, we had a party of 7 and were seated at a table at the back of the restaurant. I was the first person in our party to arrive, and before I could fully sit down in the chair, bread, a bowl of marinara sauce and a plate of olive oil with shredded Parmesan cheese were brought. They bread was good, especially dipped in the marinara sauce, but it wasn't warm or hot, like it is at other fine Italian restaurants. This is simply a preference, i know....I like my bread warm.  For drinks, I had the Prosecco which was good-nice and cold. Others at the table had soft drinks. Be warned: the soft drinks are brought in fairly tiny individual glass bottles, so there are no free refills.  For appetizers, we had the grilled AND fried calamari, and a dozen baked clams. The two calamaris were good, nice flavor (it's hard to mess up calamari) but the portions were not very big for the price. The baked clams were pretty good, however they were very small....the clam shell was about the size of a tablespoon, and the meat was smaller than a teaspoon. And for a dozen clams, it was $14!  For dinner, I had the Rigatoni alla vodka. It was good, but not great. The sauce was rich and heavy and after a while it started to taste a little like chef boyardee. A friend of mine had the veal marsala, which I tried, and the marsala sauce was very sweet. It was almost syrupy sweet. Another friend had the chicken Parmesan, which was very good. It was topped with both mozzarella and Parmesan cheeses.  For dessert, we shared spumoni and chocolate tiramisu. These were both fabulous. The spumoni was very smooth and creamy and just the perfect softness. The chocolate tiramisu was so good we had to order more.  All in all, I had a good time at Cafe Bionda. Our waiter was attentive and the bus boy always kept our water glasses full. The atmosphere was warm and dimly lit. If you are on a budget, I would recommend sharing an entree because they come in big portions. If you are a vegetarian, there aren't a lot of choices here (there are only a couple entrees to chose from) and of course there is always salad!

2008-12-18,4.0,"Yummy, fresh, flavorful Italian favorites here.  Basically, this is a cute Italian hideaway in a diverse South Loop neighborhood.  So let's summarize. SERVICE - Great! for once, a dining experience where the server isn't eye stalking you or walking by to repeat for the 10th time, ""is there anything else I can get for you?"" which we all know really means, ""Will ya get outta my station?"" BREAD - This is not really a category but definitely worth mentioning since it was good. For once, I didn't get an handful of hockey pucks in a basket with a side of ice (er....butter).  APPETIZERS -  We had only one. The fried calamari. Light, crispy, non-greasy, and not overcooked!  ENTREES - I was with two other diners and I was the one with plate envy the whole time. Of the three dishes - chicken saltimboca, Rigatoni alla vodka, and Nanna's Gravy - mine (saltimboca) was the only one that was just good, not great.  The Nanna's Gravy dish was incredible. Basically, a big bowl of parmesan-infused rigatoni with chunks of super tender pot roast. All slathered with some tasty tomato sauce. Yum.  The Rigatoni alla Vodka was not just beautiful but boutiful, too. They served it up in a big ole pasta bowl that was the size of a football. The aroma was fragrant with vodka. It also contained a nice amount of gooey mozzarella cheese bathed in basil and cream sauce. Yum x 2.  AMBIANCE - Warm, polished, and neighborhood-y type place. Small bar and two rooms (front and back) with semi open kitchen. Seating was a bit cramped due to the narrow layout of the place but were weren't necessarily so close that we could smell our neighbors aftershave.

The stuffed shells are pretty close to perfection.  I think I would have wanted a less creamier sauce kinda to balance out the meal a bit better, but overall the best dish we had. The chicken francese was super tasty.  Though once it got cold, it was a little strong on the taste and the chicken dry, so make sure you eat it first. The other pasta dish was standard.

Once seated we ordered a Pomelo wine and fried calamari, which turned out all right.  We were also given bread with marinara sauce for dipping, which I think every Italian restaurant should offer (though there was no olive oil dip, sadly). Though we each ordered separately, we passed around a bit of each of or dish: Orecchiette Sausage - This is what I picked.  I liked that it had a light oily feel and wasn't too heavy, but I was disappointed that they had crumbled to the sausage (which is supposedly their specialty) to the point where I couldn't taste it.  If it was supposed to be spicy, I didn't notice it. Linguine Shrimp Broccoli - Pretty average for the most part.  The shrimp was nice and meaty, but otherwise was a bit flavorless. Whole Boneless Crispy Brick Chicken - Man, this was a giant plate.  The chicken was juicy and had some great spices cooked into it.  We ended up eating pieces of the chicken with the other two dishes.

Living in Bridgeport at times gets frustrating.  Limited bar and restaurant options are often the source of much annoyance for me and my friends.  The boom in the South Loop has greatly improved the quality of our lives.  With that boom came Cafe Bionda. Sure, you can go to Taylor St, but then you have to brave the new University Village traffic, and deal with valet or meter parking.  From Bport, the South Loop is a 5-10 minute drive with no parking or traffic issues what so ever. Inside Cafe Bionda you will find a bar, and three seating areas.  While this place can get loud, it is a great relaxed casual atmosphere with a diverse mix of clientele.  Business men, first dates, old married couples, groups, or parties can be spotted...  This place is prime for people watching...  especially on their great outdoor patio. The stuffed shells are amazing, and I am not typically a vodka sauce fan.  Their marinara and vodka sauce both impressed me.  My boyfriend loves the veal parmesan while I stick with the chicken parmesan... Both of which are worth the money because they are huge and very tasty.  Their meatballs are also awesome.  I never really eat meatballs, and I really enjoyed these.  They are so good, they have a salad with a meatball on top - I love it!   One time I was disappointed by the Caprese Salad - the cheese was somewhat dry and the tomato was not of good quality.  This may have been an isolated incident as in the past this salad was excellent.  I also did not enjoy the Brick Chicken dish with potatoes.  I would advise sticking with a meal option that has marinara or vodka sauce. Their wine selections are decent and their desert is okay.  Really, this place is great for a hearty Italian meal complete with meat, sauce (or gravy as my mom says), and pasta.  I find Bionda to be a quality restaurant is a great location.",0.9986,0.701,0.263,0.036,0.5898399580217762

2007-07-30,2.0,"Very interesting... this place was a little slow on the up take the night we came in with a reservation we made on  opentable.com . The three young girls at the front were cute but didn't register that we showed up. The waitress was definitely having an off night (or at least I hope she was), the silverware was dirty and as it got busier, the worse the service got. I did notice that there seemed to be a stream of older and more distinguished clientle that might be neighborhood regulars who were stealing the good service.  My vodka sauce dish was lovely with a mascarpone/fluffed ricotta topping and I highly enjoyed it. My boyfriends pasta was drenched in a cup of oil and did not look appetizing at all.  Overall the price was a little high for the quality of the food. I might try it again in a few months to give it another try...

2007-07-13,4.0,"Bionda in Bucktown/Wicker Park!  Intimate, good people, and great food! Cafe Bionda opened up a second location in Bucktown/Wicker Park.   It's pretty much an exact copy of the south side place.  You can't beat the food!  The huge mussels (in season) are the best in town.  I grew up on meat sauce, that old fashion gravy that's been simmering for hours and hours with the neck bones and sausage and meat balls all mixed in.  For me, there is nothing that can beat that flavor when done right .  It brings back the great times I had as a kid growing up! Bionda's Nana's Gravy is one of those dishes that can bring me back to my younger days!    The Bionda salad is excellent.  I opted for a glass of wine instead of the whole bottle and the house Cab was excellent!   I know, for some, that one T.V.  above the bar will be a killer.  If you can get passed that, the food is pretty darn good.   I'll always go back!",0.986,0.785,0.193,0.022,0.46525974025974026

The food was decent - my girlfriend loved her penne with tomato cream sauce, sausage and peas, but my orecchiette with spicy sausage and basil was heavy on steamed basil stems. Both were pretty fatty as evidenced by the grease stains on our takeout bags. The bread is passable but gets a huge pick-me-up from the marinara dipping sauce and the prosciutto salad was great. Not sure why the hostesses were coming dangerously close to dropping an ass cheek in someone's pasta with those short-shorts.

2007-05-28,2.0,Don't believe the hype. This is a standard Italian restaurant with decent food. The service is awful. I truly mean this. We had a reservation but still had to wait over thirty minutes. Only to be seated in the newly added back room which is right next to the kitchen. The constant traffic from the wait staff was highly annoying and loud.  Make sure to request a seat in the front room.

2007-02-13,4.0,"Love it, Love it.  Whenever I go to a restaurant, I have an item that I compare all other similar restaurants too.  For example, sushi restaurants I compare the Dragon roll, breakfast spots I compare the hashbrowns, and with Italian I compare the meatballs!  Cafe Bionda definitely passes that test- they are so tasty and have the perfect combination of pork and beef!  The other thing I love is their Bionda salad- it reminds of a salad you would get in Italy or an italian home- yummy -it has cheese on top with some type of salami and a great italian house dressing.   The pasta dishes I have got here always have had freshly made pasta which unfortunately is not the norm these days! The only negative I could say was we had to wait for our table one time when we had reservations, however they gave us all a drink on the house while we waited, so I find that to be a positive really!.. It is a great place to bring anyone really- friends or family... The atmosphere is simple but it is the food that brings me back again and again.",0.9602,0.844,0.135,0.021,0.47511806375442733

2006-08-16,2.0,"What's the deal with the tv/restaurant combo? Sorry, but if I'm paying $100 for a meal  that is mediocre (I'll get to that in a second), I don't want to be staring at a sports event. Bionda has a great ambience---lofty, exposed ceilings with subdued lighting and charm---but it's ruined by the plasmas on every other wall. John M. and I went to Bionda for dinner last night and were less than impressed with our overall experience. We started with the Caprese salad and Price Edward Mussels. The salad was good---but lacked enough basil for each serving to enjoy the flavor combination. Sorry, but one leaf is just not enough for about eight slices of mozzarella and tomato. However, the mussels were wonderful---and I'm glad I read Lauren C.'s review before visiting. In fact, if I was to visit Bionda again, I would only go for appetizers, but I would definitely get the mussels again. There's nothing that bothers me more in a restaurant than being rushed---and our waiter attempted to take our appetizers away not once but two times before the meal arrived seconds later. I had the spicy crumbled sausage and rigatoni---I enjoyed the spiciness of the dish and the overall flavor but I was not wowed. John M. had fish that he said was good, but my other friend ordered the Rigatoni alla Vodka sauce. Two bites in and she decided that was enough: it was bland and lacked that ""Mmmm""-factor so often associated with vodka sauce. Overall, quite disappointed with the service but mostly the food at Bionda.",0.9709,0.813,0.125,0.063,0.5191358024691358
2006-08-15,2.0,"I had been meaning to try this new restaurant in my neighborhood lately.  I chose to bring two friends, one of which has a small child.  Had I been aware the establishment was not child-friendly, I may not have brought him with, but we did our best to enjoy the experience. The hostesses were kind enough to seat us furthest away from the bar.  Overall, I was not pleased with the service.  I was immediately put off when the bus boy present our appetizers instead of our waiter.  The mussels appetizer was excellent, yet the caprese salad failed to include enough basil (though the waiter made it a point to correct our pronunciation of the word ""caprese."")  The entrees were tasty but basic- too basic, in fact, for the prices they charge.  Other notable glitches included two major mistakes- taking away our appetizer before we were finished, and presenting a meatball saturated with marinara that we had requested dry for the baby.  At the end of the meal, the waiter reached out his hand to shake mine, which, had the service been a bit warmer, I would have appreciated as a kind gesture.  Since, however, the waiter did minimal work and did not communicate with the bussers to avoid these glitches, I found the handshake to be insincere.  I probably won't be back.",0.9726,0.766,0.157,0.077,0.43873106060606054

2006-06-10,2.0,"Trying new restaurants can be very hit-or-miss.  One one hand it's exciting to think you might come across the next gem of the Chicago dining scene.  On the other hand, you never know what you're going to get with a place that's still trying to figure things out.  Unfortunately, Cafe Bionda turned out to be more of a ""miss"" than a ""hit"".  But first the good.  Service was excellent -- they gave off the whole ""We just opened so we're going to try extra hard to be nice and friendly"" vibe very well.  The hostess was very gracious and sweet and our server was attentive and professional.  Judging by the profuse amount of sweat on his forehead, he was either very hot or he was trying very hard to make sure we had everything we needed.  However, when it comes to judging a restaurant, the more important criteria for me is still the quality of the food.  And in this department, Cafe Bionda ended up disappointing big time.  We started off with the Salami and Parmesan salad, which was actually pretty good.  But the entrees that we ended up ordering (linguine with clams and chicken saltimboca) were both woefully over-seasoned.  The linguine had way too many red pepper flakes in it, which completely overwhelmed the taste.  Likewise with the chicken saltimboca, except sage was the culprit.  It's not that I don't like the red pepper flakes or sage -- I just don't want every bite of my food to have only those two flavors hitting my taste buds.  I will say that the food is pretty affordable ($10 for the linguine, $17 for the chicken), though I wasn't too keen on paying $6 for six measly stalks of asparagus.  Another minor gripe about Cafe Bionda would be their atmosphere/ambiance.  I had initially Cafe Bionda was a restaurant but then I wasn't so sure after sitting through dinner with  U2 blaring in the background and a plasma TV showing the Sox game while we ate (we weren't sitting near the bar, btw).  If they want to pitch themselves as a restaurant, then they should consider turning down the music and getting rid of the TV.  For what it's worth, Cafe Bionda JUST opened up so I expected them to work out some kinks in the beginning.  As much I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt, the food just wasn't very good.  And given the number of quality Italian restaurants in the city, it makes me wonder how long this place will stick around.",0.9783,0.86,0.106,0.035,0.5357263814616755
