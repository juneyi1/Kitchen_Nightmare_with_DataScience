2009-02-16,4.0,"I first went here because it was recommended my my brother's friend's girlfriend...yes, a slightly risky recommendation.  When we initially walked up to the place the exterior left a bit to be desired, we looked at each other as we opened the door with an expression that said ""well, here goes nothing"".  Walking in it defnitely looked much nicer, but I was slightly baffled by the rope walls and big beams that reminded more of a log cabin than a Malaysian restaurant. Onto the food...for appetizers we had Veggie/Shrimp Tempura and a Philadelphia sushi roll, my brother ordered the Shrimp Fried Rice (I don't think he's ever ordered anything else) and I ordered the Mango Chicken which was essentially their version of Sweet and Sour Chicken.  Everything was delicious!  The mango was fresh and perfectly ripened, and the dish came served in the halved mango peel, so the presentation was nice as well. The prices are fair, although they could stand to be a bit cheaper.  Not to mention they (almost) always give everyone a small piece of cake with your check.  Last time I went they did not...apparently because they were out of toothpics...I'm not picky, I'll take my cake on a meat skewer so long as I get it!  But no hard feelings I suppose.  The service is lacking at times, the waitresses I've had generally seem a little flighty, but if you can find them and flag them down, they get what you need. I attempted to go here a couple of months ago on my way home during a huge snowstorm (and commute that would have been 3 hours if I had not stopped)...I was with a friend and raved about how great this place was and how it would totally hit the spot, so after finding our way through the blizzard we walked up and Penang was (*gasp!*) boarded up!  Apparently they had a fire...after the day I'd been through that was the last thing I needed, but we ended up going to first place we could find across the street...that was an interesting experience but another story entirely.  Anyhow, I hear they're rebuilding so once they're up and running again I will be headed southward for some Mango Chicken yet again.",0.9932,0.858,0.127,0.014,0.5031635802469137

2008-11-01,3.0,"Oh my god. Another fire in an Asian restaurant? Seriously? Is this a new trend I'm not aware of? I wonder if this is raising any actuarial eyebrows. Granted, Penang had slid down the quality pole quite a bit over the last few years. Or 'sudah jatuh standard' as Malaysians would put it. But they were the only Malaysian restaurant left in the city (another laughable statistic). And until they reopen -- dear god, please let them reopen -- I have no choice but to mourn. That's because the next closest thing we'll get to Malaysian food is located below a street named Canal, on an island named Manhattan. (OK, there's also Brooklyn and Queens but that's an extra 45 minutes by subway and foot, easy.) For the record -- and the hopeful eventuality that Penang will be resurrected in a blaze of belacan -- the 'pasembur' remained steadfastly tasty even as other Malaysian standbys such as 'char koay teow' and 'Penang prawn mee' dwindled to the state of sad simulacra. The 'roti canai' was another brave holdout. Both the pasembur and roti are worth a try at any Penang location or other Malaysian restaurant. Oh, and Penang did do an incredible 'Buddhist yam pot'. They never once screwed that up. Um, forget the 'rendangs' because they're nothing like they should be. OK, let us now pray for the safe return of Penang. Or better yet, for the genesis of one or a dozen new Malaysian restaurants to this, the THIRD LARGEST CITY in the United States of America. ADDITIONAL NOTES: 'Penang' is the name of a Malaysian state, and is pronounced 'pee-nang'. 'Panang' is the name of a Thai curry, and is pronounced 'pah-nahng'. Referring to both with the inaccurate catch-all pronunciation of 'peh-nang' will get you a generous doze of sneeze in your food in Malaysia AND Thailand. OK, I'm just kidding. But not really. Sushi is Japanese. I'm just saying.",0.9875,0.803,0.148,0.049,0.4182144020853698

The Roti Telur was so amazing. I seriously want some right now. The waitress realized that I was vegetarian and went through every vegetarian item that they had on the menu for me. I thought that was pretty amazing, or that she was just pretty, or  I don't know but I liked that.   My two friends ordered Fried Rice and Mango Chicken. I ordered the Mango Tofu and it was just so dope. A sweet and sour combo actually served inside the skin of the Mango.

A pretty good place for lunch or dinner.  I would go back to order at my own speed.  Still, I think there are other places I need to try in Chinatown first.",0.9864,0.731,0.208,0.061,0.48223104056437394
2007-08-25,3.0,"They really lucked out being the only Malaysian restaurant in Chicago. Unfortunately they're a national chain and pretty weak at that. There isn't a single item on their menu that they make really great. Luckily it's still Malaysian food.  Roti canai is good, but it's one of those dishes you can't mess up or if you do, you really shouldn't serve food like bruschetta at an Italian restaurant or chips/salsa at a Mexican restaurant.  Here's my problem. The curries here are so bland compared to really authentic Malaysian food. The curry dishes should be stewed for a long time to really induce the heat to come out. Theirs obviously isn't done long enough because it just isn't that spicy. Really good Malaysian curry is stewed with hot peppers and is slow cooked so that it's like a slow burning firebomb.  They do offer up a variety of Malaysian food including my favorite chicken Hainanese which is steamed chicken with aromatics served with a light soy sauce infused with coconut oil. Another dish that's difficult to mess up and pretty standard at Malaysian restaurants. Another favorite of mine that they offer up is skate wrapped in banana leaves steamed. Absolutely delicious.",0.973,0.765,0.166,0.069,0.5942927170868346
2007-07-16,3.0,"Actually, that's 2 1/2 stars... Not bad food... just not very authentic.  Compared to all the Penangs I've been, certainly not even close to the best.  However, we encountered the nicest server - 'coz he gave us free pulut hitam for dessert when he noticed we had hardly touched our order :) We didn't eat a lot of our food partly 'coz it wasn't that good and partly 'coz we weren't exactly hungry.  But I wasn't gonna' leave Chicago without going to try Penang so... The one safe and always authentic tasting dish is the Cantonese seafood chow fun.  Even served with pickled green chilli like they do back home (Singapore).  Everything else, if you lower your expectations for curry, you would be less disappointed.  Of course, if you don't cook any of this food at home or haven't had hawker food in eons, you might just find this place being able to satiate your cravings.",0.9329,0.79,0.148,0.062,0.4776862026862026
2007-07-14,2.0,"This is the only Malaysian restaurant in Chicago with a wide selection of Malaysian favorites as far as I know (the other one is in Arlington Hts and their menu is not exclusively Malaysian but that's another review). I personally think that the menu is dominated by Malaysian Chinese dishes and therefore does not give a very accurate presentation of the wide variety of food you find in Malaysia.  Anyways, I ordered nasi lemak, bak kut teh, pork with yam and char kuey teow. I have had the authentic version in KL and the food in Penang was far from that. At least it didn't wow me. Bak kut teh tasted like it was made from packet spices a few days ago. It was mostly soup and very little meat / vegetable.  The curry/rendang that came with the nasi lemak was cold. Cold sambal is acceptable but not the curry. Their rendang also lacks kerisik which is a quintessential ingredient for the dish. The char kuey teow did not have the ""hawker stall quality"" that you get from Penang Island but the pork & yam was wonderful.  As for the drinks, I can't smell the fragrance of the tea of my teh tarik. The ice kacang is small and I am not sure if I like the condiments at the bottom of the bowl. Even a scoop of ice cream on top won't make it any better. I don't see myself eating at that place unless I am really craving for some Malaysian food. Food is okay but I have had better food in Glasgow, Scotland and Richmond Hill, ON.  Also, sushi is not part of Malaysians' main staple and it puzzled me as to why they are selling sushi under the same roof.",0.9575,0.867,0.098,0.036,0.5794650205761317
2007-06-25,3.0,"UPDATE:  WOOHOO! One just opened up, under same downtown management, in Rolling Meadows, IL, across from the Bowl House. No more battles with traffic to downtown, no more trying to find parking spots, and the interior is so sleek and clean, unlike the old establishment downtown. Roti canai -- good, could go for an extra slice of roti Hainanese chicken rice -- comes with bowl of wonderfully ginger/broth/garlic-flavored rice. Beats the white rice any day. Be sure to dip the chicken in the ginger chili sauce. Sweet and tangy. Beef hor fun -- not bad.  Kang Kung belachan -- cooked with shrimp paste. Quite strong, even for a native like me Beef rendang -- a must-have. Looks like unmentionable but oh, so fragrant and tender. Won Ton Mee -- dry or wet option. Quite tasty although the sauce is a tad salty for my liking. Typical won ton mee comes with boiled won ton, not fried. I prefer the dry option -- you'll still get a bowl of soup (salty, too). _____________________________ I looked forward to Penang so much when I found out we were moving to Chicago. Finally got to go the other night (at midnight; they close at 1 a.m.).  I didn't enjoy it as much. It may be due to the lateness of our arrival. I'd definitely give it another shot. But I must profess to be disappointed in the atmosphere. Having been to the one in Atlanta, the decor in the Chicago branch ought to be improved. The lighting is extremely low, and not in the intimate way, more so like too many bulbs had been blown. It's depressing.  If you go, it's better to go in a group, then you'll get to try as many dishes as possible. I'd definitely give it another go.

Be forewarned that the coconut drink is actual coconut water from the coconut itself. (I was under the impression that it was another one of those mixed drinks). But it was still good regardless.
