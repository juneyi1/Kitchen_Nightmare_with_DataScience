The waiter was too busy rolling his eyes at me to take my order - so he didn't. The group of 20 people I was with were leaving their credit cards when I was just getting my food because they messed up so bad. They got both my milkshake flavor wrong and got my burger wrong as well and didn't care to fix it.  Then when we were leaving I tried pointing out the cockroaches on the table next to us but the servers would only roll their eyes and didn't care. I know it's Chicago and all, but that's just disgusting. Don't go to this infested roach-den.",-0.9852,0.739,0.037,0.224,0.6606060606060606

We were here in July of 2013.  Not entirely sure why I didnt write a review then, but I was reminded of the place when my daughter came across a youtube video of one of the servers at Ed's *performing* while taking an order at a table.  People were harshly commenting about the ""terrible service"" and ""How is she not fired"", etc... Um, ok people.  Heres the thing... if you havent heard of the place before you might want to actually look up the business or read reviews that are actually on the business itself, instead of crucifying the poor girl who is *doing her job*!  Yes, it IS her JOB to speak to customers this way.  It is the entire basis of what Ed Debevics IS.  We specifically searched the place out to go eat there and be able to participate in the *fun*, as we dont have anything like it in our town, or surrounding areas (not even a Dicks Last Resort close by!).   Enough about the youtube issue.  Here is what I thought of the place when we were there:  Food was good.  Standard diner fare, in a big way.  Burger was cooked as requested, and fries were plentiful.  The side sauces I ordered came out with the food and didnt have to be asked for a second time (something almost every single place ever struggles with, I think).  The server was delightfully rude and crude, as we expected and looked forward to prior to entering the establishment... Bonus points for me, I think, that I actually made the guy blush a time or two as I played along and flung my own insults right back at him.  (When in Rome??  Haha).   I think we will be coming through Chicago/Lansing again before too long and I would hope that Ed's is back on the beat for another round.",0.6974,0.83,0.093,0.077,0.40824372759856636

Not any more.   We took a weekend trip to Chicago last month, my husband, daughter and I.   It was a near-perfect disaster of an experience.   Very few things on the positive side, overwhelming negatives. Don't get me wrong...I get the theme.   Rudeness is expected, but incompetence is not.   The hostess took us to a table, tossed down the menus, glared at us and walked away.   PERFECT!!!   Then the server came by and it was straight downhill.    He was dressed in the theme, but that was the only thing about him that fit in.   He took our drink order and food order immediately.   Brought the drinks, but then disappeared.     I know people hate reading that ""I worked in the service industry"", but in this case it is an important claim.    I observed as a table next to us was sat....he didn't greet them for about 15 minutes.   Our food took (no exaggeration) over 45 minutes.   We were seated where we could see the expo line, and I saw what I recognized to likely be my daughter's pizza and my husband's burger sitting under the heat lamps.   Our server picked up the ticket, looked for the 3rd item, didn't see it, and walked away.  He did this 4 or 5 times, as did the manager.   But neither of the ever asked the kitchen where the 3rd item was!!!!!!!!   Finally, he did, and they put it up a few minutes later.   Then he brought out my (fresh) burger and their (old) food.   Dropped it and walked away.     Immediately notice, my order is wrong.   I had a burger with a couple different toppings.   The toppings were all missing, only the cheese was there.   I also had ordered cheese sauce on my fries.   Missing.   Our daughter (the only one who is enjoying herself at this point) is getting thirsty.    Refill on her lemonade?    Let me flag down that server!!!    Yeah, right.    It took about 10 minutes.   Got his attention, asked for the lemonade.   He got it...dropped it and tried to run off.    I YELLED to get his attention, he came back.   Told him that my burger was wrong, but at this point, I don't want it fixed, only want to make sure we aren't charged for the missing toppings.     At this point, he did the only good thing he did all night.   He brought me a free ""World's Smallest Sundae"".    I appreciated that, and even commented that he may have finally saved his tip.    Nope. We flagged him down 15 more minutes later, asked for the bill.   He dropped and ran, and of course the missing toppings were still being charged.    By now we had been here an hour and a half.   We wanted to catch sunset from the Willis Tower, but the sun is already going down.   ARRGHH!!!   Couldn't flag him down so my husband hunted down a Manager.   She did the right thing and heavily discounted the bill.    (A positive!!!) Now we just have to pay and go.   Easy, right?    Of course not!!!!    Another 5 minutes elapses before he takes the money.    I needed smaller bills for the train pass, so I laid down 2 $20 bills for our $16.00 tab and asked for change.    I watched in horror as he tried to calculate out what $40 minus $16 was.   He pulled out a calculator, asked for help.   This comedy took another 5 minutes....seriously!!!     In all, we were there for a quick burger and a fun time.   We had very little fun, and were there for over 2 hours.   This was the 3rd time in my life that I have had service so bad that I didn't leave so much as a penny for a tip.    It's wrong to get such a big discount and not tip, but he deserved nothing....ruined our night.",0.9077,0.818,0.099,0.083,0.46727925042993534

2014-07-09,4.0,"The food here is classic burgers, home-made meat loaf, super thick shakes and malts (some have been known to eat it with a spoon). Their burgers are huge, but I usually go with the meat loaf, because it reminds me of my grandmother's meat loaf. It is a flavorful and tender meat loaf with just the right amount of seasoning and gravy. I usually do not have room for dessert after eating this meal. My husband always gets a burger or chilli dog with a Green River soda pop. The fries are freshly sliced which I appreciate. They are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. Never frozen, which I appreciate. The mashed potatoes are incredibly buttery, smooth and very, very good. I do not drink soda pop and have not for over 15 years. We love the 1950's vibe, the memorabilia, the vintage photos, and the 1950's music playing in the background (such as, ""Tootie Fruity"" and ""Whole Lot of Shakin' Goin' On"" and ""Don't Be Cruel""). It's like stepping back in time when people didn't lock their doors, when kids were coming of age, and played in the streets freely. Yeah, I guess like the show ""Happy Days"" or ""The Wonder Years."" We enjoy the action at Ed Debevic's because the servers are always very entertaining and sarcastic (but in a very good way). Over the years, Ed's has changed a lot. When it first opened there were tons of Chicago locals that would go to Ed Debevic's. After a while the excitement and nostalgia wears away, so these Chicago locals move on to other newer, trendy restaurants. Ed Debevic's now appears to be the place for suburbanites and tourists who hit-up this joint when visiting the city.  I have a lot of great, happy memories and positive experiences here. This is the place where I first went on a blind date (I picked the restaurant because at the time it was walking distance to my high rise on Illinois and Orleans). That ""blind date"" became my husband 1-1/2 years later. I have happy and fun memories of bringing my nieces and nephews to Ed Debevic's and they always had a fun time. They were 9, 10 and 11 at the time, and they had a blast being sassy or sarcastic to the servers. It was part of the fun -- the server insults you and you smile -- but my nieces and nephews actually played the roles of ""sarcastic"" smart-ass customers. One of my nieces, who was always very argumentative with the Servers, ended up becoming an attorney.  We went here a few years ago to celebrate our ""first"" official date ever -- which was at Ed Debevic's. For us, it was a mile-stone anniversary and we talked about our first date and how I walked over to Ed's from my high rise building, because I wasn't sure if our date would work out or not -- I also didn't want him to know where I lived (just in case). We had a good laugh. The employees at Ed Debevic's were shocked that we came back to honor our first official date (most couples would probably celebrate at Shaw's Crab House or Gibson's or Morton's or Chicago Chop House), but we made the choice to celebrate at Ed's. We are simple people. We don't need to drop a ton of $$$ to have a good time! We were happy to return to Ed Debevic's after moving away from the River North area many, many years ago. However, we didn't get any free-bies or dessert on the house. No free milkshake. We still had a fun time though and we enjoyed sharing the memories that started here so long ago.

I didn't see any of the ""sass"" that Ed's is known for. What I did experience was a horrible server whose name tag said ""Happy Boy"". We sat at the bar since we were only getting dessert. First, they didn't have a seasonal pie available.  I ask for the all American pie instead and he walks away and I try to ask for it with ice cream, something he should have asked me if I wanted. He, again, walked away without taking my husband's order. He eventually came back and took his. We waited an abnormally long time given that we were waiting on pie and a milkshake. In that time this same server stacked approximately nine food baskets in his arms so the bottoms of the baskets were touching the top of someone else's food which also caused the buns to be smashed. I later witnessed him pick up a bun without gloves on and ask a question to a cook. My husband's milk shake was good, as was my pie and ice cream but it could have come out in a bowl or larger plate as it was a mess to eat.",-0.2846,0.941,0.027,0.032,0.4196078431372549

That said, I recently re-visited Ed's with MY children (ages 4 and 6) for their first time because it was close, and because I had great memories. We walk in, and even on a Sunday it's not busy. The hostess called us ""weirdos"", and that was it. Took us to our table, the server came over and threw hats on the table, and that was the extent of his... sassiness. Took the order, someone else brought it to us, called it ""stinky"", and that was that. No more interaction than that.  About 1/2 way through the overpriced and uninteresting meal, the ""Car Wash"" theme song came on, and the hefty servers (they used to be hotter and younger) hiked it up on the counter and pretty much stood there without doing anything until the song was over. It was embarassing really, and sad for anyone who remembers the glory days for Ed's.

2013-04-13,1.0,"I was told about this place before I came. I liked the idea of the servers being rude so I thought I'd give it a try. I came with two kids and my sister. I ordered a cheeseburger, one of my daughters ordered chicken fingers, the other a hot dog, and my sister ordered a hamburger.  First, I like the building. the decor is cute. However I'm new to the city and don't know where to park, and probably wouldn't remember how to get back if I parked too far away. Conveniently  they have a big parking lot in the front of the building, but it's $10 to park there.They say it's valet, but you park your own car and you get your own car when you leave. hmmm.... LAME! For the price of their food, parking in the lot should be free. Just sayin. So I give the guy my keys and go inside.  As far as servers being rude yep they sure are... but not in a comedic kind of way like I expected. At 2 in the afternoon there were maybe 3 or 4 other tables being served, yet our server hardly spoke to us. You would think by this time everyone would have had their coffee and been perky and ready to go. He took our order and we didn't see him again until we got our food 45 minutes later. My daughter's hot dog was cold. I guess because they made them at the same time as the burgers? IDK.  Not that the burgers were particularly hot when we got them. And the chicken fingers come with 2 chicken fingers and a ton of fries. I guess it's my fault for not asking how many come with a meal, but isn't it usually 3 or 4?  We asked for our bill... $40!!! Okay I know 40 isn't that much for a meal for 4, but considering we didn't get any entertainment because the wait staff was in a lull, the food was cold, and parking was $10, and on top of it I have to tip a waiter that didn't really wait on us.. it was too expensive. I wouldn't go back. Dave's last Resort has a similar concept and I think I would try there if so enticed to be treated rudely in the future. $58 total (food, parking, tip) for burgers isn't my style. Could have went to the drive through at the Rock and Roll Mcdonalds and got the same entertainment value. No thanks",-0.7105,0.841,0.076,0.083,0.5665239350021958

It's been quite a few years now since I've visited so I decided to check out the recent reviews before my husband and I headed to the city for a day off. The reviews were so negative that I almost didn't want to go! I've never had an experience where one of the servers was truly rude or mean and I am just NOT the type of person to feel comfortable with that. But, we decided after visiting a museum that we might as well go for it, and I am SO glad we did. It was a Friday at about 2:00 and there were only a few people in the restaurant- the quietest we've ever seen it. My husband got a compliment on his Greendale Community College T-shirt (from the TV show Community) right as we walked in- cool. I think what I was most impressed with was that our server Vegas read us perfectly right away. He had the typical attitude but figured out that you can joke with my husband (he even called him ""Scumbag"") but that you have to be a little careful with me. I even got a ""Sweetie""! He was very funny and actually provided excellent service- staying in touch with us in a funny way- quick, great with refills (even gave me a to-go cup for my Cherry Coke),  on top of everything, and dare I say- thoughtful? He was hilarious about my husband ordering a Chocolate Coke- really funny. We got a kick out of him and the other server working who was giving a family with kids a really hard time (which I really hope they were OK with- sometimes it seemed to go a little far.) I actually really liked the Chocolate Coke (Coke with chocolate syrup mixed in) but a little goes a long way. The Cherry Coke (the old fashioned soda fountain kind with the cherry syrup added) was delicious- perfect balance. We ordered onion rings and they were pretty good and came with a ranch dressing packet which seemed kind of weird. My husband got the special which was the barbecue bacon cheeseburger which was huge and crazy messy but he loved it. It came with their fries which we have always liked. I had a salad here years ago that I remember really liking but I don't think it's on the menu anymore. I decided to try the Asian Chicken Salad. It was different than any I've had before but quite good. The chicken on top was marinated and really tasty and not fried. The salad was short on the vegetables that were listed (I don't think I saw any snow peas, and the carrots and tomatoes were sparse) and it was mostly lettuce, cabbage, chicken and wontons, with a good dressing. I liked it. I HAD to get the world's smallest hot fudge sundae- those things make me happy. It was super messy but delicious and I love that they bring you a clean dish so you can take it home as a souvenir. One day I SWEAR I will actually use them!

When we received the fries we got just the basket. No forks. No plates, No Napkins. We stared at each other because we weren't going to burn on fingers on the hot chili. After about another 7-10 minutes our server (IN CHARACTER) said "" You don't like it?"" I replied "" No just need flatware, plates and some napkins."" he seemed in a hurry he left us with two napkins and two forks. I was kind of horrified that I was plopping my fries on a napkin and eating it with a fork.  AGAIN I UNDERSTAND THE CONCEPT OF THE RESTAURANT. THAT DOES NOT EXCUSE BAD SERVICE.  Our burgers arrive at the table and the busser looked so confused she did not place them on the table. she looked at us...then the burgers....than around...and walked back into the kitchen with our food. We were so confused. I see our server look at her and say ""What's wrong with the food?"" About ten minutes later our food arrives. My bacon burger under seasoned absolutely horrible. I didn't think you could mess up a bacon burger but I didn't eat it. My server didn't BOTHER to as me why i did not eat my burger. Just picked it up and disposed of it.

The hostess was rude- for REAL. There was some confusion as to where we were sitting. She mumbled, sorta pointed and walked away. Unsure if she pointed to a booth or table, we sat in the booth. If the hostess had stuck around, we would have requested a booth for sure.  Low and behold a new snotty hostess confronted us and VERY rudely asked who sat us at this booth. We politely explained the confusion, apologized and figured that would be it. No such luck, she stood there staring us down with a super snotty look on her face. So we moved to a table because she would not move or stop staring at us! I worried her eyes were going to pop out of her head. I have to say she was the rudest hostess ever. Her attitude put a damper on our mood and ruined a dinner we were all very much looking forward to. Oh and her YELLING at us for five minutes made quite the scene and was embarrassing! We told our waitress that we understood the service comes with a (fun) attitude, snotty hostess chick took it too far.

This past weekend I had taken a newbie there and since I have a friend that works there I had asked her to make sure he received the entire experience.  No need to be nice to him! We definitely had a great time there and she gave him more than his fair share of an experience! It was great.   Knowing my friend can sing I had asked her multiple times to sing a song.  When I heard a guy talking on the microphone, pointing me out, explaining I wanted to hear a song I was uber excited to hear my friend sing.  However.... this dude sang to me instead. Great! Funny! Then he started calling me a tramp in the song.  Even better! Couldn't stop laughing the entire time.  She had also made my man friend get up and dance with a 12yr old for her birthday! It made me so happy to see him turn bright red but be a good sport! Aside from all of the fun, we definitely loved the food too.  We both had the Route 66 burger which was just amazing.  So good! I also had their florentine soup which was just as good as the staff had said it was.   I know it could be concerning walking in here, wondering what kind of food you'll get at a place that bases its entirety on making fun of you and being mean, but you have NOTHING to worry about! Food is great!  If you're looking to drink, they also have a selection of beers on tap for pitchers.  We went with 312 as my man friend and I have become somewhat of beer snobs (him mostly), so we couldn't just settle for a lite beer.   All n all, good atmosphere, fun, good for groups or a date.  Especially a first date in my opinion, get to make fools of each other and laugh it all off!

The food did come fast, and the standard burger and fries were fine, ableit over-priced compared with all the great burger spots we have now. But it worked for lunch. Bill of 30-something dollars arrived. I had to hunt down the server to pay the bill. When I paid with a $100 bill, he returned change for $50.00. When I pointed out that I had given him a larger bill, he without hesitation or comment, returned with the rest of the change, all $10.00 bills, presuming I was going to leave one for him, or that he was entitled to that. I left the guy three bucks. So pay close attention if  you pay cash there. It can be busy and distracting.

But a lot of milk shakes and fries have passed under the bridge at Ed's since then. Debevic's expanded into a chain of over a half dozen replicas across the country after a partnership of big hitters in the concept dining industry (including Melman and his LEYE) ran with the idea.  This one of two remaining Ed Debevic's has since been passed into other owner's hands (no longer a LEYE joint). Melman's ideas about dining have matured to more sophisticated concepts. Especially inside, it looks as if not a penny has been spent by the new management to upgrade or update anything. It's already past looking shabby. Although nothing is scripted, the speil by the hosts and wait staff seems less than spontaneous. If you're not ready to participate in that show, you may not enjoy it at all. The service is attentive despite the put-on attitude. The food is pretty run of the mill, but the portions are generous, especially the desserts. The one unique dessert is their ""World's smallest sundae,"" which is about the size of a shot glass. They give you a clean sundae glass with your order to keep as a souvenir. Yes.

Even after all the waiting for our table it still took them about another 20 mins before we could even order. However, after you did order the food comes out pretty quick (compared to the waiting time just to be seated and order). It wasn't a bad thing for us though, because we were there to celebrate, so we had as much time to wait around as needed, and it was very entertaining during the wait cracking jokes back and forth with our waiter ""Bubba"". To be honest the food was mediocre and very overpriced, I ordered the ""Bacon Cheeseburger"" which comes with fries, but I didn't think it would cost more than $10 which it did.

Thank heaven the food comes out fast so your visit is usually about an hour of cacophony.  I've learned that there are a couple of things on the menu that are grownup friendly- the meatloaf with mashed potatoes and their chili. Save room for dessert at the brownie melt is calorie worthy as is the ""world's smallest sundae"" that comes with a souvenir glass.  They have beer and wine though as much as I always want to have a drink while I'm there (maybe it will ease the pain of me being there?) I always have little ones in my charge (why else would I be there?) so I always stick to the soda.  If you don't see them on your first visit- know that there are video games up front as well as a photobooth ($5 for two strips) Love that the booth talks you through the whole experience and you have a choice of color, b & w or sepia colored prints. Another big hit with the kids.  Valet parking runs around $8 for two hours. Depending on how into their role your server is- it is either amazingly fun for all to hear what comes out of their mouths and to watch them dance on the counter or on a table or it is an effort to understand just what they are attempting to do. No matter. We all look ridiculous in our hats, wondering what atrocity is to come next and eating food on mismatched plates. And all Ed wants you to do anyway is ""Eat and Get out"".

The Green River was good and full of nostalgia. I took three 15-year old friends of mine here the other night, so they had a blast arguing with our waiter. It was hilarious to watch, but I think I have outgrown the gimmick. I was slightly annoyed by the end of the dinner. Overall, I had a lot of fun laughing and taking pictures with our waiter, Bubba. Upon us being seated, he threw our hats at us (Multiple times), threw our straws at us, told me my drink order of water matches my personality, and walked away when one of my friends started to talk to him. Our food came out relatively quick but I suspect that was only because they were closing in half an hour. I doubt I'd come back anytime soon.

2006-05-26,2.0,"Ugh. I am so over this whole gimmicky place. Yeah, it was badass when I would come up to Chicago in high school. I always vowed to myself that I would work there. But after visiting here recently, I was miserable. The wait was so long, the food is overpriced and greasy, and the gimmick gets old in two seconds. My waitress didn't even like to play along. Unless you're an easily-amused tourist with current bowel problems, don't go here.",-0.7789,0.8,0.054,0.146,0.46125

2005-11-16,3.0,"When I was a little kid I used to be crazy. I used to have anxiety attacks in restaurants which ususally resulted in me throwing-up in their bathrooms and stuff like that. As a little kid, whenever we'd be visiting a museum or zoo or something downtown, my parents always loved to stop at Ed's for dinner. I was equal parts mystified and mortified. The place is awesome to look at and has fun shit going on all over the place both inside and out, but the waitstaff can be a little bit aggressive and like to hone in on specific people to poke fun at--(thankfully) it was usually my Dad. I haven't been in years, but I know I definitely puked a couple of times at here. Sensory overload.",0.702,0.733,0.143,0.123,0.5019230769230769

If you want a unique dining experience with sassy waitstaff (who sometimes dance on the counters) then check out Ed's for a much less than ordinary time. The food is of the basic Steak & Shake variety, but the tiny sundae is pure genius. This is fun for tourists and the whole family.",0.802,0.847,0.123,0.03,0.47685185185185186
