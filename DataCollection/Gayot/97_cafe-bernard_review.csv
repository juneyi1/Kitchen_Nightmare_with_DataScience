2012-04-09,5.0,"5 stars.  The full 5 stars.  French cuisine to the max.  Joe and I came here with another couple after a play at Steppenwolf.  We ordered escargot and baked brie for appetizers.  Just, wow.  The escargot were served in a special bowl made specifically for this snail appetizer, with about 6 or 7 holes hollowed into the serving bowl.  In each hole, the snail was nestled in a pool of hot, garlicky butter, and everything was topped with a mild white   melted cheese that bubbled up into even more goodness.  We took our small forks to dig out the snails and slathered them on white French bread.  Sinful.  The baked brie was delicious in combination with the snails.  Butter, garlic, cheese and more cheese?  Skip the diet for a night.  Eat here!   For my entree I ordered the salmon.  Cooked perfectly.  It was truly a magical night - I think part of it was on account we were the only customers in the place as we'd come a bit late, but the manager was very accommodating and once the staff got over the fact they couldn't close early and their night was not indeed over (or ready to start), they too were extremely nice.  But it was a magical night because of the soft dim lights, and murals on the walls, and the topper: having good company.  I feel food like this is meant to be shared over good conversation. I will come back here, but it MUST be under the right circumstances.  I don't want to ruin the good memory.",0.9896,0.827,0.159,0.013,0.5433497536945813

Tonight was not so good, though. The service seemed slow, even though the place was only half full. The high points of the meal were salad (spinach with roasted tomatoes and goat cheese), tasty, seedy bread (which was way late in arriving due to a service oversight), and dessert (a delicious marjolaine cake, nicely presented). Unfortunately, the entrées were disappointing. Roasted leg of lamb was tough tough tough and not very tasty. Filet au poivre was nicely crusted with pepper, but chewy and nearly flavorless. I think I'll stick with the attached Red Rooster bistro for tastier food choices (yes, I know it's the same kitchen -- go figure) and better value.",0.9442,0.735,0.168,0.097,0.5643589743589744

2011-08-16,3.0,"cafe bernard has been around since the mid 80s. Unfortunately on the inside it still looks that way. Appearances can be deceiving though as it does look like the kind of place that would only have a clientele in their 50s and older.  This had been an audible for a wine dinner that I had with some friends. I had goofed on remembering that another place wasn't open, so cafe bernard it was. It has been slightly over two years since I was last here and I had enjoyed myself then. My friends and I basically had the entire place to ourselves. It was a monday night and there wasn't really anyone in there. We decided to share most of our dishes with each other and started off with plates of duck pate that was both coarse and smooth. Both the pates were excellent. We also got an order of mussels. The mussels were very good as well with a more creamy broth to them.  I ordered up the duck while my friends ordered some cassoulet and soft shell crab. The duck was done well and the skin was nice and crispy, but not too much. The soft shell crab was nice and the cassoulet was very good.  This was a bunch of good classic french cooking that was more on the rustic side. While there are better french restaurants in Chicago, Cafe Bernard is quality affordable french cuisine with $10 corkage. It does need a bit of a facelift as it feels very dated inside.",0.9836,0.847,0.14,0.013,0.4810416666666666
2011-05-14,4.0,"Attempted to go to the Red Rooster Cafe but there was a wait so they said go to Cafe Bernard, its the same chef and same menu, but no wait. We said ""sure!"" and headed in. Its a quiet, dark, wooded restaurant, candle lit. I definitely liked the a ambiance, and was grateful we were eating there opposed to the very loud Red Rooster next door.  The bread was warm and fresh, very tasty. My boyfriend and I split everything. We started out with the cheese plate, which had walnuts, apple, dried cranberries as well as a bleu cheese, brie, muenster, and some other not as tasty smelly cheese. It was delicious and great with the bread. We also got a apple/bleu cheese salad that was incredibly tasty, though maybe a little too much dressing. For an entree, we had the grilled salmon with cabernet reduction that was tasty. The salmon portion was larger than expected and the sauce was delicious. It also came with pickled beets, potato wedges, and some zucchini.  Overall- i was happy with the food. I will definitely go back. The only issue is this.... the two restaurants serve the same food (though some of the entrees are different), but for some reason the menu at Cafe Bernard is more expensive than the Red Rooster by a buck or three.... take that as you will.",0.9923,0.815,0.174,0.011,0.47569444444444436

Honestly, it was a GREAT location for Valentine's Day. Dark, romantic, quiet... it was refreshing to not have to SCREAM across a two top to have a conversation with your date. We ordered the calamari and a bottle of malbec to start. The calamari was grilled, but I don't think tie grill was hot enough. Instead of being light, it was a little chewy. But the wine was delicious. Entrees: braised lamb and filet mignon. Both were ok. You can tell that the service was rushed, and the red meats suffered. Should have gone with a seafood dish. Dessert: Creme brulee... hooooo my God. Delicious. I absolutely love creme brulee, and this was so good.  Service was great, and the evening an overall success.

2011-01-16,3.0,"Trop mauvais...I guess this place has been around for 25 years...hard to believe with the somewhat empty restaurant we encountered on Saturday night. The place only had a handful of tables the whole time we were there. We had a table of 8 people and were there celebrating a birthday...which btw they made no attempt to help us acknowledge.  Our female server was very mediocre. She didn't tell us any of the specials and seemed very inexperienced.  Also, we were the last ones there at 9:30pm and they turned off the heat!!!!  I'm not kidding... You would think that for a bill of almost $600, they would at least keep the heat on until we left!  So their food was decent...(meaning it was fine to try once, but not worth coming back for) For an appetizer we had the lobster ravioli...it was ok, a little salty.  The escargot was a bigger hit with my fiance, than me. The snails seemed a little small compared to other places, and I like more garlic and parsley in mine. The Walu special was very nice, the pork tenderloin was not bad either. For dessert we had the cappuccino cheesecake which was good, and we had the nut cake....which was just ok. I was not impressed with their bar selection at all as they were not able to make a number of drinks I requested (simple stuff...including a Bloody Mary). Several people from our group had been there before a number of years ago and had said it used to be busy and the food was better. All of us said that we would not be back....too bad, because I think they could really do better.",0.9861,0.808,0.149,0.044,0.4962193362193362
2011-01-10,4.0,"I was at Cafe Bernard before Christmas to celebrate my sister-in-law's birthday. She has spent time in France, so she would probably be an even better judge of the food, but I think I can speak for both of us and say that it was pretty awesome. The best part? The prix fixe menu was only $20! Three courses! Am I in love? Oui! I had a salad to start and my sister-in-law had the soup. We shared each of them, and I have no complaints. We both had the duck a l'orange, which was good, but not the best I've ever had. We also ordered what I think was duck pate. I don't know much about pate, so all I can say is that I enjoyed it. The cheesecake at the end was overdoing it a little bit (at least as far as my waistline is concerned), but not a bad cheesecake.

2010-06-24,5.0,"Wow!  I don't believe that I've been walking down this street for almost 9 years and never given this place a shot!  Our daughter (who lives a block away), my husband and I were on our way to Pasta Palazzo when the sign in the window caught my eye:  3 courses for $20, Mon.-Thurs.  It was Weds. so we changed our plan and went in. A sweet young thing showed us to a table immediately; she was the server as well as the hostess.  That worked surprisingly well and her service was excellent, even  considering that there were maybe 4 or 5 other tables she had to see to.  We were given the regular menu and had to ask for the special 3 course menu, but that was OK.  The SYT was going to describe all the specials (which were on a chalkboard) but we told her we were only interested in the price special in our hands.    There were two coices for appetizer (soup or salad), 5 choices for entree and 4 for dessert.   Soon a young (non Hispanic!!) busboy appeared with a bread basket.  He warned us that it was hot, and indeed it was.  Delicious, tasty, two types of bread.  I don't know how difficult it is to put the bread in the oven before serving it, but that seemingly small touch gives a wonderful start to a meal. My husband and daughter opted for the salad and I got the (white) gazpacho.  I was intensely jealous, as their salads looked like entree salads, they were so large..  The veggies were fresh and varied and it tasted as good as it looked.   My gazpacho was a little ho-hum.  It had alot of ""stuff"", but the stuff was not blended as much as I would have liked, and the cold broth was also not all that tasty.  The next time we go here I'll definitely get the salad. We all got the salmon for an entree.  It was, without a doubt, the best salmon I've ever had--this from a person who loves salmon and orders it often.  It was cooked perfectly, was a bigger chunk than I would have predicted, and--best of all--was served over a merlot reduction that had me in a state of bliss!  Oh, was that good!!  I almost opted for the boneless chicken, but when asked, the server said that the salmon was special.  I will go back for that in a heartbeat. We were full, so took our dessert (we opted for the cappucino cheesecake) home.  Of course, by the time we reached our place 20 minutes later we were ready to tear into it.  This was not a cheap-type cheescake.  It was rich, delicious, well flavored, and served over a blackberry compote.  Oh boy.  What a meal. Definitely worth more than $20.  Much more.",0.9982,0.772,0.201,0.026,0.5746449806232417

2010-06-05,4.0,"After many years, my wife and I, Chicago locals, found a coupon and re-visited Cafe Bernard, a little bistro serving traditional French dishes (not nouvelle cuisine), a couple weeks ago and both of us enjoyed it very much. The room itself was a little, old storefront which looked like an electrician's nightmare--ancient fixtures, dangling wiring, run-down johns and the like-- it definitely needs a new eye, a clean touch and at least a few  thou in long-ignored repair and maintenance.  Yet, while that was almost comical, we weren't bothered much as everything else was just fine.  The prices are pricey for this place and a web-site without prices for this is ridiculous and needs a change.  But we lived with it and aren't really disappointed. Our reservation was kept, we were welcomed warmly and our young waiter was friendly, composed and wise, including his advice on a couple of potential choices which was on-spot.  The menu choices were a bit narrow but sufficiently varied, the wines by the glass varied, and we split an appetizer of escargots-minus-shells which tasted as it should .  I chose the smallish steak-au-poivre medium-rare, which was surprisingly good.  My wife had the salmon with sauce which she, too, enjoyed.  My coffee was good and we skipped dessert as we were full and happy. The next time we visit, we're trying other of chef Bernard's entrees as we should, like the bouillabaise, the canarde l'orange or his cassoulet and see what's what.  But, for now, this was a tasty and pleasant place to eat.  We will be returning soon, but one of Bernard's many specials and/or coupons will surely help out with his prices.",0.9937,0.81,0.184,0.006,0.5586794414735591

It proves to be a great spot for couples who only want to look and get lost in each others eyes... We enjoyed a 3 course meal from their $20.09 prix fixe menu. Just to note, this menu is available from Sunday through Thursday. The meals were well balanced from appetizer to entree. We had the Salmon and NY Strip Steak entrees. The desert itself was something of another experience. The flourless chocolate cake was smooth and consistent throughout while providing a strong but not overwhelming sense of cocoa. This left my palate feeling very satisfied. The other desert (marjolaine cake) was a combination of chocolote and white mousse offered a more subtle release from the decadent and heavier main course (NY Strip Steak). By the time we had completed the meal we had the whole restaurant to ourselves. Perhaps this was a result of the weather, I'd prefer to see that it was fate which allowed this brief moment of undisturbed solitude. All in all, I rate this restaurant a 5 because of the service, ambiance, food quality, price point and escape from reality factor. If I could only leave the restuarant and step onto a narrow brick laden street in Provence, France would this complete the picture.

Two friends of mine made New Year's Eve reservations for 4 at the Red Rooster, but since my SO and I got there so early (we came in from Milwaukee, and figured better to be early than late) the waiters suggested we sit at the bar in Cafe Bernard while we waited for the rest of our party to arrive.   We made our way awkwardly through the narrow hallway between the two restaurants and the crowded seating areas to the bar at the front of Cafe Bernard.  An older fellow (who I presume to be Bernard) was behind the bar as we approached, but quickly left the bar as we approached and sat down.  He went and stood near the waiters' station as we sat ungreeted at the bar for about 15 minutes.  The waiters were obviously busy because of the occasion, so I can understand their being unable to speak or ask if we wanted a drink.  I can't, however, understand why the other fellow stood quietly behind us at the waiters' station when he had just been behind the bar, and now there were thirsty customers seated there.  I glanced back a couple times; I saw him drinking a glass of water and looking out into the dining area.  A few times I saw him go out into the dining area to talk to seated guests, but he made his way back to the wall/waiters' station each time without saying anything to us.   We continued to sit there, and eventually one of the waitresses apologized and took our drink order.  The SO ordrered a Stella; I ordered Bailey's on the rocks.  As she prepared to pour our drinks, I noticed the fellow move away from the wall toward the bar, across from where she was making the drinks.  He watched her INTENTLY as she poured ice and exactly two shots of Bailey's into my glass.  She made a few other drinks too (for customers at tables) and as she carried them away he went behind the bar and poured some more ice into MY GLASS ONLY.  WTF?  He still didn't speak.  Puzzled and annoyed, I didn't say anything aside from thanking her when she handed me my drink.  Oh yeah, then he answered the phone one time after he double-iced my drink.  But not one word to us.  He went back to the wall behind us. We continued to wait for our friends, and by this time a lot of the customers seated in the dining areas were beginning to leave.  The older fellow was greeting them as they walked by, thanking them for coming, and asking how their meal was.  Funny, I thought, because he STILL hadn't said one word to us.   As tables opened up, he approached the parties sitting at the tables nearest the front door and asked them if they wanted to move into the actual dining area.  They declined; he went back to standing on the wall.   We were finishing up our drinks by this time and it was our reservation time anyway, so we began to get up and surprise, the fellow asked us if we wanted one of the tables that had opened up. (By now, the dining area was mostly empty.)  We told him we had reservations at Red Rooster and were just waiting for our friends to arrive.  He went to go check on our reservations and sure enough, our friends had just been seated at a table. We left Cafe Bernard to join our friends and had the drinks transferred to our bill for dinner.  After that nonsense though, I seriously considered whether this establishment was deserving of any more patronage by myself or my friends.  I didn't expect him to talk our heads off of course, but we're PAYING customers in your restaurant.....you won't at least say good evening?  It's not like he was doing much of anything else most of the time. Also, not that it should matter, but we are well dressed young professionals.  We sat quietly at the bar, patiently waiting for our drinks.  Once we got them, we continued to sit there quietly.  Why the rude treatment?  Does everyone else get ignored at the bar, or was it just us?  We sat there long enough to have had more than one drink, and we would've.....if we hadn't waited 15 minutes to get the first one.",0.985,0.867,0.085,0.047,0.4469779764861731

First of all, I like CB because it's not super chic.  Not that CB isn't fancy or good, but it's just not all that haute cuisine nonsense that I don't really care for (see Brasserie Jo).  Café Bernard and Red Rooster in the back really remind me of a classic, country French restaurant.  Not too fancy, not too café-esque, just a real restaurant that serves quality food.  The portion sizes aren't tiny and there's a selection of cuisine that really models ""classic French dishes.""   We decided to have some of the Beaujolais Nouveau, soupe à l'ognion, lobster cakes and the paté de pays.  I LOVE paté and this plate was scrumptious.  I really liked everything that I chose and the prices aren't high enough to break the bank.  The wine was good but served a bit too cold - I'm over it, though.   This seems like a really great place to go for a date.  There's a nice bar to sit and sample wines and there's plenty of seating to accommodate two or more.  I'll definitely come back in the new year - I thought the atmosphere was wonderful and the food was pretty darn good.  Though I'm not a French person, I spent quite a bit of time there and going to a place like Café Bernard brings back a lot of good memories.  Merci beaucoup, CB.",0.9896,0.723,0.187,0.09,0.45284799211628496
2009-12-23,3.0,"I thought I'd take advantage of the 36% off special before it expires in a few days. I was pleased but not blown away. Food: First I'd like to preface this review by saying that I judge restaurants serving ""haute cuisine"" differently than your average places. You pay a cost for the long nose you use to look down on people. That being said, the food was not pretentious. I had an apple blue cheese vinaigrette salad. This was something I could have made at home, nothing spectacular. However, I did appreciate the fact that they put the exactly correct amount of dressing. Most places drown their salads (hence me typically ordering dressing on the side). The french onion soup was good, not amazing, but solid. I'd like it to be a little more tangy, but no serious complaints. For an entree I had the duck l'orange. Since I've never had this dish before, I'll refrain from serious judgment, though I think the sauce could have had a bit more orange flavor to it. My companion had a filet mignon au pauvre, which was by far the superior dish. The whipped potatoes were very good, lots of garlic and butter. However, the vegetable sides were unimaginative and RAW! They were french cut green beans and carrots very slightly blanched. I like raw vegetables, but this wasn't a raw food bar (they were crunchy!). The creme brulee was good, but they had this accompanying sauce which was terrible. Luckily it was on the side. Good wine. Ambiance: Cheesy walls but cool ceilings. Restaurants: if you're going to go with modern minimalism for one part of the room, why not compete it? Service: A bit slow, but not crazy. Fine restaurants always make you wait a little longer. All in all, I'd come back but only at a discounted rate. It's not worth full price.",0.9608,0.761,0.144,0.095,0.5232255215233939
2009-12-20,4.0,"The value of Cafe Bernard can't be beaten. I went to a musical at the Victory Garden Theatre, and I was told that if you bring your ticket stub you can get a $20 three-course prix fixe at Cafe Bernard. We went on a Saturday at 6pm and it was empty. We ended up staying pretty late (4 gals pals catching up have a LOT to say) and by the time we left at 9:30, it was fairly busy.  The $20.09 prix fixe is offered Sunday through Thursday if you don't have a ticket stub from Victory Gardens. You can't get the more traditional, interesting French dishes, but the items on the prix fixe menu were still good. They bring you toasted bread to begin the meal. Then you choose between the soup du jour or salad. For $0.50 more, you can get the french onion soup instead of the soup du jour. We ordered 2 french onion and 2 butternut squash soups. Both were good, but I thought the french onion tasted standard. Not exceptional. We ordered 4 different entrees so we could get a good sampling. New York Strip, seared pork tenderloin, chicken crepes, 1/2 roasted chicken. They all came with the same sides-- pickled cabbage (surprisingly good), french green beans, mashed potatoes, carrots. Each meat entree had its individual sauce. The NY strip was a little tough, but that was probably because one of the women likes her meat well done, so we compromised and ordered it medium instead of medium rare. The pork tenderloin was ok. The chicken crepe was delicious, but salty. The best entree was the roasted chicken, which was remarkably tender and juicy. It was seasoned perfectly. We also ordered 4 different desserts. I thought they were all great (I'm a sucker for desserts) but none of us were crazy about the rhubarb and strawberry dessert. It was sweet and tangy, not really my thing. The service was great-- out host was friendly and made a good wine suggestion, keeping in mind value. Our water glasses were always filled. None of the staff was too intrusive. They didn't pressure us to leave even though we had been there quite a while. It's a small space, but I didn't feel cramped. Great place for a casual date. Intimate without feeling formal, but not too casual either. Since we don't have a chance to get together often, we wanted to take a photo together before we left. The bartender obliged us and paused in mixing drinks to take a quick picture for us. Overall, a great experience.",0.9959,0.79,0.162,0.047,0.5431561376476631

The mussels are the best in the area and you have to make sure you ask for them as soon as you get in, or they may sell out right before you get there.

Cafe Bernard is definitely a very cute restaurant, but almost rustic in appearance.  It was extremely empty, and there was only one server for both inside and outside.  Dim lighting and quaint music made for an excellent date atmosphere where one could enjoy intimate conversation.  Our waitress was very good in providing suggestions and explanation of the menus, as well as providing time between dishes.  Having come on a Tuesday, we were able to partake in the 36% off entrees (for their 36th anniversary, valid Mon/Tue)- good for everything, including daily specials and appetizers, but not the prix fixe. The wine list was fairly extensive and reasonably priced.  We opted for a Daniel Olivier sauvignon blanc.  I could not resist ordering a french onion soup, which was nice and cheesy but a little bland.  The escargot were excellent...I am by no means an escargot connoisseur, but adding the layer of pastry on top was a fine touch.  For entrees, we ordered the rack of lamb special, and the scallop salad.  The lamb was delicious, with a tiny hint of gamey-ness, and the scallops were monstrous in size, but succulent and chewy.

Well, maybe the steak knives, but more about that later. I first found Café Bernard when I was looking for a place to dine on Christmas Eve. While the rest of Chicago was at church or with family, me, my date and three families from France [one royalty ... I kid you not] ate steak and Cassoulet, snails and drank too much Champagne. The staff won my heart tout de suite! I don't think the menu really changes, which makes it easy to eat your way through it. Start with the most traditional French Onion Soup you've ever had the pleasure of burning the roof of your mouth on. Go ahead and get the snails is boiling butter [watch the roof of your mouth!] or the Baked Brie en Croute; though, my favorite it the Duck pâté with all the traditional accoutrement. Salads are worth exploring, particularly the Apple blue cheese with mustard vinaigrette. Entrées may be hard to choose from. I would recommend the pan seared pork tenderloin if you can't decide. It is always perfectly seasoned and cooked and comes with roasted vegetables. You certainly can't miss with the classic French Country Bistro dish Cassoulet Toulousain which positively melts in your mouth. The Sea Scallops with Balsamic Reduction couldn't be better: perfectly seared with a thick and unctuous Balsamic sauce. I also love the spice of their Filet au Poivre, but their serrated steak knives shred the meat rather than slice it. The only solution I know is to replace the knives, they really destroy the meat and it ends up less tender than I know it is. Desserts are rich and delicious.

2008-06-22,5.0,"Cafe Bernard has NEVER disappointed me. The food is absolutely delicious!!! The service is also great. Our waiter, Tony, was really friendly and didn't miss a beat.  My only complaint is that the decor is very strange. The lighting is trying to be modern, and the rest of the room feels like a french barn. Also, the Red Rooster, in the back, smells kind of strange and reminds me of ""The Regal Beagle"" from Three's Company.  But in all honesty, that doesn't diminish my desire to go there every night for the mashed potatoes w gravy...",0.8709,0.723,0.173,0.104,0.441923076923077
2008-06-02,4.0,"A bottle of Bordeaux, cheese plate, salmon (that is the only fish I ever eat) with potatoes and vegetables followed by creme brulee topped with berries.  Sat outside on the side of the restaurant. The wine was great.  Bread was served slightly toasted and was good.  I did not like the cheese plate, tried a tiny bit and they all tasted gross to me, but I don't like strange or moldy-type cheeses.  I ate a few of the strawberries though.  The salmon was good, but the wine reduction sauce was just ok.  The creme brulee was fantastic, tons of fresh berries on top. My other dining partners liked their food, one had the pork and said it was good, one had grouper topped with crab meat, and both liked the pate. The outside area is really nothing special, sorry.  It has no particular view, but I like to sit outside when its nice out.  The waiter was great, too, very good service. There is a reason a restaurant like this is open for so long.  It's a good place.",0.9894,0.672,0.246,0.082,0.5042142857142857
2008-04-08,4.0,"I am a little surprised reading the other reviews by their inconsistancy. We have been coming here off and on for a while, and have not been disappointed.  We were there just the other night and had a great time. In fact, I thought the food was the best I had ever had there.  The three of us each had a fish special. The fish was perfectly done, the vegetables were cooked just right. and the appetizers - grilled octopus, mussels - were wonderful. The house Chardonay at $27 was very good. Our server was friendly and knowledgable, but not overbearing.  The ambience is laid back and comfortable. One reviewer wrote he didn't like it because he felt the tables were too close. While the tables aren't yards apart, I didn't feel hemmed in; and I am claustrophobic!  If you are looking for a very good Provincial French meal, served in a comfortable setting, at a fair price, this is it.",0.9834,0.776,0.208,0.016,0.6183571428571429

It's a quaint restaurant and the atmosphere is really nice and our waitress, Sarah, GREAT! :) The rack of lamb was delicious, served with mashed potatoes and vegetables (and for the price, a more than perfect portion!)  - the scallops were just as good (with an incredible balsamic reduction along the side), served also with garlic mashed potatoes and vegetables. My absolute favorite part of the meal was, hands down, the Creme Brulee! This could not have been any better - and is now my favorite. It was light, yet creamy, and still slightly warm when served. I was in heaven!  It was a wonderful night - we will definitely go back.",0.993,0.695,0.305,0.0,0.7069444444444445
2008-03-18,2.0,"So I brought my girlfriend here for Valentine's day, hoping it would be a cute little romantic French place with some good food. I was totally disappointed. If by romantic you mean dirty, worn down and squashed, then yeah it's romantic. As for the food... After reading reviews on Metromix and watching Red Rooster (it's sister restaurant) being featured on 'Check Please!"". After knowing the chef was French and the place served traditional French dishes uncommon at most places (such as the Cassoulet Toulousain), I was drooling for the food. But boy oh boy, I was disappointed. I tried to appreciate how the escargots were inside a puff pastry, but really they were just tiny and not that spectacular. I tried the Cassoulet which was basically a meat stew, but I would go for an Italian fava bean stew over that cr*p anyday. Service= looking for your waitress. I'm probably being a bit too harsh. It's decent, so if you don't know anything about food and your diet consists of sandwiches, you'll probably love this place.",0.7724,0.824,0.112,0.064,0.5074252136752135
2008-03-03,4.0,"The fiance and I went to Cafe Bernard with some friends (with whom we had traveled to France). The food was quite good. 3/4 of us had the french onion soup, while our friend had the escargot with puff pastry. The soup had a nice rich broth, and very cheesy (maybe a little too cheesy !). Didn't try the escargot but it looked nice. For entree, I had the grouper special served with garlic mashed, some marinated beets, and veggies. The beets were delish! Kind of a sweet/vinegary flavor. Fiance had the pork tenderloin and we both thought that was great. I don't usually like pork that much because it can be dry, but this was quite tender and flavorful. We shared the chocolate mousse cake for dessert which was rich and YUM. Highly recommend that. The only negative was the service when we first got there. Our friends got there before us, but said it took forever to get their drinks at the bar and they felt invisible. There was much confusion over seating us, which resulted on others being seated before us (despite the reservation) and us standing there feeling a bit ignored. When we were seated, it took too long for us to place our cocktail order. After that, the service was quite good, so probably just an anomaly. Quaint atmosphere too.   Good place for french food!",0.9884,0.758,0.187,0.055,0.5810317460317459

Entrees came with potatoes and 4 vegetables!  The house signature dish of salmon was very good, the pork au poivre was good but more well done than we had requested.  The cappucino cheesecake was great.  Didn't care for the house cotes-du-rhone but the cabernet sauvignon was a hit. Service was friendly, attentive and helpful.  Nice, quiet setting.  Very French, in a good way.  Good place for a romantic date.  Good selection of seafood specials.  Will go back again to try more dishes.  Reasonable prices, good value.",0.9935,0.642,0.336,0.022,0.524090909090909

We had the shiitake mushrooms with goat cheese phyllo dough and mussels for appetizers. Mussels (according to the fiance) was great and the shiitake mushrooms were not bad. He got the beef wellington as his main course and LOVED it. I got the chicken with garlic, which was gigantic and OK. Not bad, not great -- OK.  We had the velvet chocolate cake and I nearly had a clogged artery because it was so decadent. Loved it though because I'm all about the sweets.",0.9901,0.712,0.288,0.0,0.6320512820512822
2007-12-18,4.0,"I liked this place for the most part -- a great place to take a date for sure, and my date definitely scored points for making a reservation here. For any ethical eaters out there, this is one of those places that pulls the ""order the confit, get a side of foie gras for free!"" BS to try and avoid the ban, which sort of drew my internal ire when the server enthusiastically told us of this off-menu special.  Because I was on a date, I didn't stand up and walk out at that point, I just went on... The food was on the whole delicious.  We started with the shiitake mushrooms & goat cheese in a phyllo dough served with some sauce - perhaps a basalmic reduction of some kind - that was delicious.  The French Onion Gratinee came next, and it was flavorful, but I would have preferred a bit more crisp on the top.  I noshed on that while waiting for the entrees, like I enjoy doing, but I was a little miffed that the server didn't give any indication that she was holding off on putting the entrees in until after she took away my soup crock, so I just waited, and waited, and wondered what was taking so long, until my date asked and she told us she was waiting on us.  I was only noshing because I was waiting!  That was annoying. For the entree, I had a Grilled Sea Scallop Scallop with mesclun greens, roasted potatoes, asparagus, roasted portabellos, and a basalmic vinaigrette dressing.  It was fantastic, except the chef went a bit overboard with the salt on the potatoes and the sea scallops, which disappointed me.  My date had the filet mignon, without the pepper.  He seemed to enjoy it, but he wasn't overly amazed by it.  Just a nice piece of meat, with some simple garlic mashed potatoes.  The house wine was fairly good - I enjoyed their Sauvignon Blanc.  By the time we got to dessert, we were so full, I wasn't able to fit any more food in gullet. It is a nice restaurant, great for a date, the food is tasty, and the check won't be so bad if you don't imbibe in the fruits from the vine.  I will probably not go back if not taken on a date, mostly because of the foie gras thing, but if you are cool with that, it is a nice place to try.",0.9912,0.791,0.154,0.054,0.5958522297808012
2007-11-06,5.0,"Cafe Bernard never fails to be a place I enjoy. Some places have good nights and bad nights. Cafe Bernard has consistently decent food even when the staff has a bad night. I've never really had a bad evening in all the times I've eaten at Cafe Bernard. The food is always consistently good and the staff is always in good humor, even when they seem to be having an off night. I consider Bernard to be one of my ""go to"" french places in Chicago and those who know me, know that I go to French resto's any time I can.  I was there recently on a date and both she and I enjoyed it thoroughly. She had the salmon and I had a fish special which was good, but I prefer to eat duck or lamb at Bernard as they really do it well. My one complaint (which isn't really) about Bernard / The Rooster is they don't do enough classic French dishes for my liking. Oh well.

2007-06-11,4.0,"Cafe Bernard is one of my favorite places to go for a quiet girls' night out: unpretentious, solid french cooking, great prices, a manageable wine list, and a cozy atmosphere. The menu is limited but has a fair representation of country French dishes--roasted chicken, fillet mig, cassoulet toulousaine, etc.--and it's well prepared. They do seem to be a bit weak on desserts. A friend wanted to order one until she realized it was served with frozen yogurt. She was horrified. Frozen yogurt? No real ice cream? Nope. At least, not last time we were there. The entrees are moderately priced. I've had three courses and a bottle of wine for two ring in under $100, which I think is quite fair. If you go prix fixe or skip the wine, you could probably ring in under $30. And hey, if it's your birthday and you bring a friend who's paying full price, you can eat for $5.

2006-04-26,4.0,"Before coming here, be sure to worship and make your offerings at the altar of the parking gods. Or, better yet, walk or take public transportation. It was IMPOSSIBLE to find a space. I circled around for twenty minutes before finding a spot a block and a half away. *WHEW!* Getting on to the more fun part of things: the food! The food earns a solid four stars for the price. It's rare you can get French food at such an affordable price. It was solid stuff, not so much the out-there, foamy, reduction of this or that kind and more of the ingredients you can recognize and that make sense going together style. The prix fixe menu, at $20.06 for soup or salad, an entree, and a dessert, was an excellent value.  I had the prix fixe, and I chose the salad (which was okay, nothing exciting -- standard mixed greens, red beets, and a little tomato), the duck confit (which was moist and delicious, served with garlic mashed potatoes, green beans, carrots, broccoli, and a red beet thing. Does that sound like a lot? Well, it was a LOT of food.), and the marjolaine cake (nutty with two types of mousses -- very good, the white chocolate mousse was a tad heavy, but the raspberry sauce that came with it was delicious and an inspired accompaniment). My friend's French onion soup was fantastic, but her calamari was ""not too flavorful, but not bad at all."" As for the space, it was very homey. The tables are placed kind of close together, and it might be uncomfortable if they were packed, but they weren't. There's some ceiling lamp/?art? that doesn't go with the space, but perhaps we can chalk that up to a new style: French eclectic. The bathroom was clean , but, if anything, the age of the place shows in the bathroom because the toilet seemed kind of...vintage/delicate in that ""might need to jiggle the handle, tilt your head to the left, and hope really hard it flushes"" way. Anyway, overall, this place was a great spot for good and affordable French food. It seems like it would be good for a date because it was quiet, well-priced, and had a pretty extensive wine list/wine special offered.",0.9974,0.774,0.204,0.022,0.4635230047730048
