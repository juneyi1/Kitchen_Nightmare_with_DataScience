A friend and I dined here for dinner on a Wednesday night a while ago. We waited a bit for someone to come to our table after we were seated. The place was pretty empty so I felt it was a bit unnecessary for the wait staff and gauchos to take as long as they did coming to our table. However, I didn't mind too much because the food was delicious. Just about everything was perfectly seasoned and they sliced some nice sized portions for us.  My only real complaint for the night was how some of the gauchos served us. A few of them didn't ask how we would like our meat cooked and just sliced off random pieces then left quickly. I often ended up with rare and well done, neither of which are how I wanted my meat cooked. Another with a skewer that diners continued to turn down came to our table, flipped my card from black to orange, sliced off a few pieces of meat and walked away. My card was flipped for a reason. I didn't want anymore to eat. So that unrequested food pretty much went to waste.",0.9829,0.812,0.146,0.041,0.515096618357488

So ofcourse before going to any restaurant I make reservations. When I came to check in with my date we waited 20 min before we could even sit down. (That's with reservations so minus 1 star) so the decor of the restaurant was very nice. Pretty much a good restaurant atmosphere for a nice date in Chicago. Noticed alot of wine being displayed on the walls.  So when we finally sat down, the staff were very good at coming to the tables. The food was fresh and ofcourse yummy. My favorites were the pineapple, the shrimp (f***ing to die for) and the chicken was yummers as well. And ofcourse the steak was good. Except for one. I forgot which one it was in particular but it was really really fatty. Hardly was any meat on it :/ but moving along. So off from the so far so good for dinner, to dessert.

I used to come here all the time when they sent out the coupons in the mailers. This is my first time back in a year or two since they switched to Groupon. I went on a Sunday night, and the clientele seemed to resemble Applebees or the Olive Garden more than the tourists and businessmen that it used to have.  Normally, I couldn't care less about the other diners. But at a place like this, they affect your dining experience. I was a bit confused when the guy came around and said his steak was ""well done."" Who would eat it well done? My table passed, but I saw it devoured by the next table. It took me a while to connect the dots, but it seemed like most of the meat was coming out medium to medium well or well done--that is, really dried out. It seems like the current clientele favor the meat more well done than rare. One of the guys saw our disdain and brought over a rare to medium rare house special and it was great, but it did taste like a cheaper grade of meat than what they had a few years ago. The house special used to taste magical. Now it tastes like I bought a sirloin from the grocery store and roasted it in my oven. In retrospect, I guess my table could have requested more medium rare meat, but I think it's just too much trouble. The shrimp was great. The pineapple is okay, kind of hard to mess up. The ""Brazilian sausage"" tasted like hotel breakfast sausages (maybe the old Brazilian sausages are too adventurous for the current clientele?). I had a hard time cutting some of the pieces of chicken and pork with my knife. I can't fault the place for catering to its customers. We all gotta pay the bills. I probably won't be back. As I'm getting older, all you can eat has less appeal. At this point in my life, I'd rather have one good steak for $48 cooked to a level I prefer that is not dependent on my fellow diners' preferences. But beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

When we get to the restaurant, the entire front area was PACKED like sardines of people waiting for their table. What's messed up is 99% of those people (and I mean it was like 70 people waiting!) all had reservations as well. They were telling people that it would be a hour or more LATER than their reservation to get a table. However the hostess was not even looking in the system to check peoples reservations - it was clear at this point that they were just taking first come first serve. Several peoples' names were ""accidentally"" crossed off the list after they had been waiting 1.5-2 hours for their table. There were many people demanding to speak to the manager who was apparently too cowardly to show his face. He let those poor girls stand up there and get hammered by frustration patrons. All the girls could do was say the manage was not coming out and to take a business card and complain to corporate. It was BAD! People were even calling the police on the restaurant because it was an extremely unsafe environment having all of those people standing there elbow to elbow waiting. Even guests who had finished eating were waiting in there as it was 30+ minutes for valet to get their cars. My boyfriend and I were did not sit down until 10:29 pm!!! 2.5 hours after our reservation. We would have gladly left if we knew we could easily find another restaurant to eat at without waiting, but it was VDAY and we were sure everything downtown was packed.

I thought it was comparable to Fogo in that they both have a salad bar with a wide variety of salad and appetizers to start you off, and gauchos that serve you meat. Brazzaz's mushroom risotto was excellent.  Our waiter was attentive and friendly, explaining the card system to have gauchos stop by your table once you are ready for the meat portion of the meal. Their sides were also yummy and were filled quickly once we emptied the plate. I thought their meat selection was god as well. Some people have complained about not enough variety but I feel like I tried at least 10 different kinds! My favorite - and this is something Fogo does NOT have - is the grilled pineapple. I think I called the guy over at least 5 times. You don't even need dessert if you enjoy pineapple. Overall I had a great date night with my boyfriend.

Second and probably last experience (Dec 2015): - I was here in a weekend night and it was crowded. There was a line for the salad bar area but choices were quite limited. There was no soup available. The meat was okay and there were more selection this time. The cheese bread was good, but the banana was quite disappointing because it's fried.

They have a variety of salads and appetizers (hors d'oeuvres), also a variety of veggies, smoked samlon and sushi, some pasta salads (the Brazilian chicken salad is delish). Once you're full and ready for the main course, you just flip the coin on your table and the waiters will start passing by with their meat skewers and they'll offer you what they have for the day and you can choose how well you want your meat to be. They served beef, pork, 1/4 chicken, shrimp, and grilled pineapple. I tried all the beef they served and it was out of this world!! The shrimp was mediocre and I didn't find the grilled pineapple to be any special. They also have a variety of desserts, couldn't try any because I was delightfully full from the salad buffet and all the good stuff!

They both have a very large salad bar with just about anything you could imagine. They both have a very large and over priced wine selection. Their meats are very similar again, and I feel like when a skewer is taken back un eaten, it's just reheated and brought right back out. That disappoints me, especially for the price. The difference between the two? The service. Texas De Brazil had far better service compare to Brazzaz, and honestly it wasn't even close. If you search around, you can generally find a free meal with the purchase of another meal, which is good Monday-Friday generally, so that'll save you $45 right off the bat.

I arrived first and checked in a short time before our scheduled reservation.  I didn't ask how long it would be, but my friend did when he arrived and to our surprise we were told that we'd be waiting until almost 30 minutes after our scheduled time.  The hostess was right on, too.  We sat down right about 30 minutes after we were scheduled.  This is a huge pet peeve of mine -- if you're taking reservations in advance you should be able to fill them.   Inside the dining room, we were quite surprised to see how many tables were open which made the 30 minute wait sting a bit more.  After sitting down, we were greeted by our friendly server quickly and the meal got started.  Unfortunately, that's where the better service ended.  Drink orders were forgotten about until we flagged someone down about it.  Additions to our drink order were forgotten about completely.  Many tables had sides of mashed potatoes and caramelized bananas but we didn't see any until almost toward the end of our meal -- mashed potatoes that is.  We never saw any bananas.   The roving meat also left much to be desired.  The one of the beef selections served ""medium"" was raw when it hit my plate.  Other beef selections were chewy beyond what's appetizing.  And although we were vigilant about watching which meat was where, we didn't see any shrimp, ribs, or lamb until we asked.  When we got those items they were probably the best things we had all night. The saving grace to this review was probably their large salad bar.  Everything we tasted on it was great and I highly recommend this restaurant come up with a pricing option to just visit it and ignore all the meats.  Additionally this restaurant (more like the genre of restaurant) is just fun dining experience.  I'm glad we went with a coupon because otherwise I'd feel pretty ripped off.  Who knows, we may be back at some point with the same coupon, but with much more managed expectations.  Or maybe we'll go to one of the similar restaurants we've just had better luck at...",0.9967,0.805,0.167,0.027,0.5224572649572649

They also bring plantains and garlic mashed potatoes to the table before you even get started with the meat. I also liked that they had assorted sushi with the salad.  Once you flip over that button the meat starts coming and doesn't stop. Most of the meat was pretty good but not all of it was great. The pork was very salty. The house special was too chewy. The garlic dry and full of fat.  The bacon wrapped filet was also too salty for me. The shrimp is definitely worth trying and the barbque ribs are good. My favorite was probably the bottom sirloin.  I have to say that the service was basically non existent. I wanted a coke so bad the entire time and no one and by as a waiter to see if we needed anything or to refill our waters.

This would make sense if...well, this was not a buffet-style place.  We just need a table and a plate to get started. 2 No waiter...period: After we were seated, we waited for 10 minutes to have our drink orders taken or even an offer for a glass of water. We eventually just got up, got a plate and started our meal.  About 20 minutes into the meal, I finally stopped someone to ask the whereabouts of our waiter. Apparently, they forgot to assign us one.  We just stopped random waiters throughout our dinner when we needed something. Of course, 3 of them had no problem servicing us once we needed our bill.  Nevertheless, the food choices and quality were still great (other than the seafood salad).  The meat servers moved around as normal to get our selection of meats.   For the price, we expected better service or at least an apology for the poor service we received.   Food: 4/5 Service: 2/5",-0.2732,0.908,0.04,0.051,0.3993333333333334

2014-11-10,1.0,"Update: In response to my complaint to Chicago Health Department, Brazzaz failed their inspection 11/14/2014 ( see comments at end) My family and i have frequented Brazzaz, on numerous occasions over the past seven years. in the past, i have given nothing less than a 5 star review, but after this most recent trip, this may have been our last visit.  Although the food was great as always, and a very nice primary server, I noticed a fruit fly, subsequently noticed the fruit fly on my food. I shook this off as a rare occurrence, until the next fruit fly was spotted, and the next, a total of eight or nine fruit fly during the remainder of our dinner.  I notified the server, who apologized, and stated this was not the first issue with fruit flies and that the owners/ management were aware of the issue. multiple staff witnessed the fruit flies in our presence.  The manager, Carlos, asked us how our experience was only after we completed dinner, and paid the bill. he apologized, and stated since the card was already run, he could not do anything for us, and apologized for the situation.  This horrible treatment and experience was not how my wife and i wanted to experience while celebrating our wedding anniversary.  regardless of the number of times in the past we celebrated birthdays, graduation, and anniversaries at Brazzaz, and regardless of the price, fruit flies should not be a part of the experience.  I expected a five star experience, as in the past, but was left with this 1 star experience.  At $50 a person (plus drinks and dessert), i would expect better than what we received.

I saw shrimp walk by once, but they never stopped even though coaster was turned upward. Never saw shrimp up close. When asked, received more promises.

Although we did not have a Groupon deal, we wondered if the filet and shrimp were not served to make up the cost difference? Just a thought.

The salad/sides bar is a meal in itself, the complimentary sides of mashed potatoes, fried plantain/bananas, and mini cheese bread popover deliciousnesses are also amazing. Some of the meats were great, some good, and some horrid. Shrimp were great albeit scarce. Didn't see the filet mignon or tack of lamb, but everything else made it to the table and the gauchos were not shy with the portions. The pineapple was also amazing. The garlic steak was too chewy and pork loin also too dry. Bacon chicken and top and bottom sirloin our favs. Didn't care for lamb shank, but the sausage was a must have. All in all a good meal, but not worth the $50. We used a half price groupon on one meal.  A necessity is the caipirinha drink.

2014-10-25,1.0,"I'm actually embarrassed that I recommended my party go here over Fogo. We had a great experience in the past (~8 years ago). Clearly things have changed for the worse. Firstly, the little flipper things.. They gave us one, for the entire table. The waiter's excuse was that people kept taking them home as souvenirs so they didn't have many left. What?  In what world does that even make sense? Firstly, most businesses would want people to take them and get the free marketing. Secondly, they should be buying these in bulk, and obviously things are not looking up for Brazzaz if they can't afford new paper flippers.  Next, the service.. Our waiter was hard to understand and just odd. Asking about the beer selections resulted in a full-on Micro Machine Man rendition of the beer list..  About 15 items in 2 seconds. I understand it's a frequently asked question, but the response should still be understandable to native English speakers. We requested the shrimp (one of the reasons for choosing Brazzaz over Fogo) 4 times before it actually showed up. The waiter would come buy and ask if he could get us anything, and each time we'd remind him of the shrimp, and each time he acted like it was the first time we'd brought it up.  Finally, a full cup of water was knocked over one of our plates, and a hunk of meat was dropped right into my lap. Nothing like walking through the entire restaurant to go to the bathroom with a big wet stain on my pant leg. Still trying to save those pants as I type this. I have no idea what happened to this restaurant (granted, 8 years between visits is a fairly long stretch), but this most recent trip is most definitely my last.",0.9511,0.881,0.089,0.031,0.35753312344221433

Our waiter who oversaw our dining experience was friendly and checked on us during the course of our dinner.   As like our Brazilian steakhouses, there are salad bar selections that are part of your dinner, but as a meat-eater, I was focused only on the skewers brought out by the Gauchos.  They offered 18 different varieties of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, shrimp, beef ribs, pork ribs, sausages and pineapple.  The skewers of meat that were brought around were ok, but we never saw the filet mignon, rib eye and rack of lamb. I asked our waiter about these skewers and he said they are special requests and that he could have the Gaucho bring these out. The Filet Mignon and Rib Eye were brought to the table.  The Filet was good, but the Rib Eye was well done, hence the meat was not moist.  The rack of lamb, no opinion, because it never made it to the table.  Overall, the servers were friendly, but some of meat offered was just ok.  The better cuts of meat shouldn't have to be specially requested and should be brought around like the other cuts of meat.  Also, the dining room floor was little slippery, probably due to the grease from the skewers of meat carried around by the Gauchos.  Given the price charged, I expected a better dining experience.",0.9787,0.825,0.136,0.039,0.5022556390977444

One thing that I really enjoy about Brazzaz versus other Brazilian steak houses in the area is that they offer grilled shrimp as one of their meat options, and this is one of the best offerings in my opinion. This doesn't seem to come around as often, but if you let the server know this is what you are looking for they will make sure to bring it around to your table. The salad bar and hot bar items always offer a nice variety of options whether you are looking for vegetarian dishes or seafood to compliment your meal. The desserts, if you still have room, are also quite good. I wasn't a huge fan of the Papaya Creme, though my brother seemed to enjoy it. I do recommend the creme brulee topped with bananas rather than the strawberries (you could also go half and half if you have to try them both).

Finally the selection of meats was terrible, if you claim/advertise X amounts of meats have them floating around the dining room, don't just have the crap tasting cheap IHOP steak available.

We turned our cards to orange, and it was at least ten minutes before anyone came to our table. In fact, compared to other Brazilian steakhouses, the servers did not visit tables nearly frequently enough. We asked for a list of available meats, and were told there was no list.  Not only did the servers come too infrequently but, they also kept bringing around the same cuts of meat over and over again - garlic steak and chicken drumsticks. The meat we did have was overcooked ( we always asked for medium). We ordered filet mignon and it tasted exactly like the garlic steak - i'm convinced that's what it actually was.  Furthermore, the servers kept dropping meat all over the floor. There were two pieces on the floor right by our table, and another piece between tables which the servers kept walking over and stepping on, despite my pointing it out that it was there.

On one side the chip is black and says ""no thank you.""  On the other side the chip is orange and says ""yes please."" These chips are used to show the waiters if you want them to keep bringing you food or to stop. After you are seated you are given the opportunity to order drink or have food from the salad bar. The salad bar has all sorts of foods ranging from vegetables to seafood. Although a lot of the food in the salad bar is very appetizing I would recommend not eating too much of it. After the salad bar you can flip over your chip and almost immediately the waiters will come with all sorts of meats. Some examples our pork, Brazilian steak, and chicken wrapped in bacon. The chicken wrapped in bacon is by far my favorite and I would highly recommend trying it. After some time you will become very full. At this time you can flip the chip and they will stop serving you for as long as you want.

I would say Brazzaz holds its own to other comparable churrascarias, but with a few items unique to them...namely the shrimp.  Good selections at the salad bar, and we were never waiting for meats to come our way.  My faves were the rib eye, beef ribs, and of course the shrimp...the meats are tender, I always go for medium-rare.  Our server checked in frequently and made sure to get our faves to the table.  Our last round was to request the shrimp and they served us each a skewer, which was fantastic.  I had seconds and thirds of the mushroom risotto.  And of course, the cheese bread.  We had plenty of helpings.

One, after about 30-40 minutes, the meat guys stopped coming to our table. My strategy was to pace myself a little bit, so I didn't say yes to every meat every time. But after about a 15-minute lull, I was thinking, ""Okay, where is everybody?"" Eventually, a waiter came by and asked if we had any more requests. I felt like saying, ""Yes, have the meat guys return."" Instead, I made a specific request (bacon-wrapped filet), but I guess the waiter got distracted because no one ever came back. I found this strange. And two, this is the first Brazilian steakhouse I've been to that didn't include dessert. Not only that, but we weren't even offered dessert. All throughout our meal, we kept seeing waitresses show dessert trays to nearby tables. Once our meat plates were taken away, a waitress just brought us a bill. She did not ask if we wanted dessert, nor did she ask if we even wanted to see the options. That didn't make a whole lot of sense, especially since at least two of the four of us would've ordered dessert. All in all, the food was good. Some of it was very good.

The hidden gem of the evening was the mushroom risotto at the salad bar.  You knew the steak was going to be excellent, I didn't expect them to nail an italian dish on the buffet.  That was a nice pace changer.  Most all of the choices were excellent, I'm always a sucker for a good deviled egg and the scottish smoked salmon was another can't miss especially if you a lox fan.  My tablemates enjoyed the mashed potatoes but I found them to be very plain. atmosphere, service and setting were all excellent though the front desk was empty a few inopportune times; but consistency is what made this night a catch.

We went on Saturday night right when they opened so we didn't have to wait and there was no need for a reservation. The first thing I noticed when I was seated was my fork was dirty. Yuck..  Over all however I found the service here to be very friendly. Only downside was when they asked if there were any cuts we were waiting for the one I asked for was never brought around. I think they ask everyone what cuts of meat they would like but don't really change what comes around. I don't understand why they ask if they aren't going to bring it around. If you aren't going to bring it then just don't ask. I like my meat medium well done so when they asked this is what I requested. Most of the cuts I was given however we rare. The salad bar here was good but not in the same league as Texas De Brazil. The salami was nothing special unlike the top quality stuff at Texas De Brazil. I felt the same way about the cheese the stuff that was out was old and not fresh. The exception being the fresh Mozzarella it was very good. My Boyfriend also really liked the apple salad. One other major downside to me was the tiny coke bottles. They are over priced and only like 8 onces. Texas De Brazil used to have these but didn't last time I went and I'm sure it is because customers complained and just started to order water.  Over all I felt for the money the food here could be better. Brazil Express and Texas De Brazil are both much better options if you are looking for a Brazilian steak house.,0.9523,0.804,0.119,0.077,0.5089654195011337

2014-02-21,4.0,"There are a few brazilian bbq places downtown, but this one takes the cake (for me at least) because of their oysters on the half shell and sashimi at the salad bar. I am also in love with their creamy, cheesy risotto - and it's all you can eat! I have been here 4 times in one year. I have always gone during ""coupon season"" - when their BOGO dinner coupons are distributed to Chicago residents in the summer, which is an AMAZING deal which I can't help but take full advantage of! Not to mention that the regular dinner buffet price is $50/pp, sans tax, drinks, tip.  So in addition to their spectacular salad bar, which offers much more than just ""salad"", their meats are of course all incredible. They have a special meat of the day, which has never disappointed. Mashed potatoes, fried bananas, and rolls that are gooey in the middle are always replenished at your table. Be prepared that even after you flip your coin over indicating that you do not want anymore, they pretty much disregard it completely and come over and offer you more.  I have refrained from giving 5stars for the following reasons, that are not relevant to the food quality alone: 1) Valet is kind of pricey, and it is a difficult place to park. I believe I paid $13 +tip on a weekday. But it IS downtown Chicago so...(but still.) 2) One time I got a waitress that recognized me as having used a dinner coupon with her before. She asked if I had a coupon upon being seated and I confirmed yes. She then unkindly sought a way to switch with another server. Which I thought was unprofessional and a little offensive - especially since I tip on what the full retail value would have been. 3) Without the coupons, it is clearly an expensive buffet. It is high quality, but not QUITE worth the almost $70 each at the end of the day.",0.9692,0.815,0.118,0.067,0.5601672771672772

2014-02-16,1.0,"It is with great sadness that I write this review. I used to love Brazza, and I think over the first two years they were open it was one of my favorite restaurants. My office was around the corner so I used to come here practically every week for lunch with my clients, and often for dinner with my friends and family.  Then there was a period when I switched offices a little further away and Brazza had closed due to a fire (or two) and did not make it to the restaurant for several months.  Fast forward to 6 months ago, me and my business partner go for dinner excited that one of our favorite places is back open. Unfortunately it was not even close to as good as we what we both remembered from before. The meat was lacking in flavor, medium rare and medium cuts not at all tender, and in some cases not even warm! Before we finished we asked for the waiter to bring us some of the Parmesan pork as that was one of our favorites and we had not seen any being brought around. What came out to us was pork on a plate, odd because they usually serve you off of a skewer. After biting into the meat I quickly realized why it came on a plate, because they had microwaved it! They actually OVER microwaved some old, rubbery, nasty pork and served it to me and my business partner. Disgusted I spit the one piece I attempted to eat out and vowed never to return to Brazza again as it had clearly changed. This past December I received a Christmas card from a client with a gift certificate for, because of my previous praise you guessed it, Brazza. Still pissed off and disgusted with my last experience I through the gift certificate in my desk drawer out of site for a while.  At the beginning of this month the same client let me know he was coming into town and we should go to Brazza. Not wanting to tell him of my last experience ruining our good memories of the place, and hoping it was perhaps just a fluke I decided to oblige and made us a reservation for this past Saturday, 2/15/14.  When we arrived I noticed two things immediately: how crowded the front waiting area was, and how shady most of the people in that area looked. I understand that Groupon can be an affective method to pack your restaurant, however when you run discounts a million times to attract people, effectively making your place an Old Country Buffet  you are left with a clientele that can be unsavory and scare off your more sophisticated customers. We actually had to squeeze our way through the crowd to the host stand because of how shoulder to shoulder crowded it was. Talking to the host we were informed that despite our 9:00pm reservation that I had made two weeks in advance, we could not be seated for 60-90 minuets (10:00-10:30pm). THIS IS WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A GENERAL MANAGER HAS NO CLUE WHAT HE IS DOING AND ALLOWS THE RESERVATIONS MANAGER TO OVERBOOK THE RESTAURANT. WHAT KIND OF GENERAL MANAGER BELIEVES OVERBOOKING WILL RESULT IN ANYTHING OTHER THAN PISSED OFF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL DEFINITELY NOT RETURN IS BEYOND ME!!!! Understanding that the host was some young kid, clearly overwhelmed with the crowd, and no manager could be found even if I asked for one, I gave her a pass and took her advice and attempted to get a drink at the bar with my client. What we discovered was another fiasco, dozens and dozens of people overcrowding the area, staring clearly very upset as the ONE bartender attempted to serve the masses as quickly as he could. We overheard people saying they had been waiting over an hour despite having a reservation, same as us, and that they were only served one drink, some not even one yet! The hostility in the air was rising as people began shouting profanity and threatening the bartender with violence as he was apparently only serving one side of the room. Honestly it felt like a fight between these gangbanger looking, saggy pants backward baseball and puffy stocking hat wearing individuals could break out any minuet. IT WAS EASILY THE WORST DINING EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE!!!!  We quickly left and decided to take a cab to Fogo De Chao, another Brazilian steakhouse located in downtown Chicago. WOW what a difference! The place was equally busy yet logistically very well managed. Despite not having a reservation we were able to grab a drink at the bar and be seated within 10 minutes. The food was spectacular, the service excellent, and the absolute best part of all was when they check came. I had told our waiter of our earlier experience at Brazza and how it almost ruined our night, so he decided to give us a gift certificate for a free dinner to Fogo De Chao to show how they appreciate good loyal customers.  I will be throwing out or re-gifting my still unused Brazza gift certificate and taking all of my clients to Fogo De Chao from now on.",0.9834,0.811,0.111,0.078,0.5326291079812205

2014-01-29,3.0,"Solid 3 star restaurant. I came here because I'd gotten a groupon and it was just about to expire. I've been to other Brazilian steakhouses before (Fogo), so I'm familiar with the concept. I was really excited to try the salad bar and grilled pineapple, in particular. Our server was nice, but wasn't overly friendly. She was pretty hands-off the whole evening, and didn't ask us if we had anything particular we wanted. With so many options, this would have been really nice, and we heard her ask the table next to us later in the evening. They ordered a bottle of wine, and we only ordered cocktails, so maybe she was banking on a better tip from them? About the cocktails- my fiance loved his, but I thought they were a bit on the weak side. The salad bar here was amazing- we liked this better than at Fogo! I loved all of the different warm dishes, but especially the mushroom truffle risotto. My fiance was very happy to see deviled eggs (since I'm a passionate egg AND mayo hater, he never gets these at home!). There were more meat options here than at Fogo, which we both liked, but none of them were as good. In particular, the garlic cut was extremely chewy, and had far less garlic than the same at Fogo. We found many of the beef cuts to be a bit on the chewy side, and the servers pretty much ignored our token- they offered us everything, even if we had it turned to the do not disturb side. However, they offered us a variety of sauces for the meat, and they were delicious! They should do this at all Brazilian steakhouses. The grilled pineapple was really disappointing. It's actually just warm pineapple- whoever gets the exterior piece probably gets the caramelized deliciousness I was imagining. There's potential for this to be amazing, but it isn't executed well. We ordered dessert, too (a chocolate lava cake), which was good. It wasn't great, but we both enjoyed it, and found it reasonably priced. However, there was no dessert menu. Instead, they brought over a dessert tray that was filled with fake plastic desserts for us to look at! This was NOT appetizing at all. Please, print a freaking menu, and people will order more desserts- plastic is not delicious looking. Overall, even with the discount, I wouldn't go here over Fogo again. I'm happy I tried it, but the service and the quality of the meat was sub-par. Not bad, just not as good. And the discount is nice, but it's not enough to make a difference. If I'm going to have a nice dinner out, I'm going where they have the best food/service.",0.9976,0.695,0.217,0.088,0.6378415300546447

2014-01-13,2.0,"Went here bc of a Groupon and was not impressed. The whole experience was kicked off with a surly hostess who left us standing without as much as a smile. Very short, very rude. We were ushered back to our table after waiting for another hostess who at least smiled but whose accent was so heavy we could not understand her. The decor is nice the salad bar looked lovely. We were in the process of taking off our coats when our server appeared and began rattling off instructions, She was pleasant but again hard to understand. We were told there were no menus which kicked off one of the most confusing dining experiences ever. You are given a coin once side saying you'd like more food one side the opposite, and in the meantime you can go to the salad bar. However our server did not explain any of this even though we told her it was our first time. We finally got drink menus and ordered two ""specialty"" cocktails for $11 apiece that were nothing special. We were left waiting awkwardly for direction on whether to start at the salad bar and eventually figured it out on our own. The salad bar was average and many of the selections were downright confusing. Sushi? A selection of lunch meats when you are going to gorge on meat for the entree? Heavy mayo salads and bland rices? All of these items did not go well with the meat offered. Sides that were delivered were very tasty fried bananas and cheesy bread that were both good when eaten immediately and inedible once left to cool off. The instant mashed potatoes served were disgusting and offensive considering the price of the meal. Once the meat started coming around things became hectic and confused and many of the servers were hard to understand and rushed. A list of all the choices would have been very handy especially since our server only named a few and we did not know all our options. Having a list would also cut sown the waste since you are not allowed to bring any leftovers home. The best tasting items were the bacon wrapped filet, the lamb chops, and the beef ribs (amazing). Everything else was kind of bland and after awhile one-note, underseasoned meat, meat, and more meat. It would have been nice to have some fresh acidic salads and fresh fruit salads on the side to break up the meat monotony but the choices were not cohesive. We also noticed that the better and pricier cuts made there way around only once while the cheaper selections were circulated more often. Once the server knew we had groupons (which we mentioned while reserving our table) She became very short and did not return for longer periods of time, we were also told only one Groupon would be accepted per table but eventually the manager said he would allow it. We had to ask about dessert/coffee options and were never offered anything to drink besides water and or overpriced alcohol. I don't even know if they have iced tea or other beverages! The server said she could show us a dessert tray if we wanted but she did not seemed to thrilled to do it and we refused. She tried to force another round of drinks on us but at this point I was feeling queasy from all the meat and having bad visions of the scene of Mia Rudolph pooping in the street in Bridesmaids so we asked for our check. Even though we were told both Groupons would be accepted the check was brought out with only one removed and we had to wait until the manager came out to remove the other (it seemed to be done intentionally to see if we would notice). All in all it was a haphazard confusing experience. I still do not know if dessert was included with our meal, what beverages were offered (besides the specialty drinks,) and what the full selection of meats offered are. I do not care to return to find out.",-0.5446,0.837,0.077,0.086,0.5774963924963924
2014-01-05,3.0,"This was my second Brazilian steakhouse experience, my first was at ZED 451. We had Sunday lunch reservations and knew what to expect. Armed with a Groupon (saved us $25!), we arrived and were seated after a few minutes. Our waitress was nice, no complaints. Brazilian steakhouses are sort of hands-off for servers anyways, so she basically told us how it worked, brought us some water, and gave us the check.  Overall I was pretty disappointed with the whole spread. Their salad bar was expansive, but some of the items just weren't up to bar. The ceviche was flavorless, but the Brazilian chicken salad (and cheese pasta) were good, but the charcuterie section was just alright, which is sort of a bummer. The one at ZED 451 was phenomenal.  As for the meat - it was good. I think we tried every cut, and everything was good, but not fantastic. While a few of the cuts (I'm forgetting the names of them, but it seemed like they were the classic sirloin type cuts) were absolutely delicious, others were sort of flavorless. I was expecting a lot of really great meat cuts with mouth-watering flavors, but I felt like I could have bought any of those and cooked up the exact same thing at home on the grill, maybe even better.  While my companion was a big fan of the mashed potatoes they give you, they tasted like they came out of the box (full disclosure: I'm not a fan of potatoes at all). The fried banana wasn't great either -- we both had a bite and left it at that. The warm pineapple was a nice treat, however.

For starters, the service and general attentiveness was below average, given what I've experienced here before.  Additionally, the server and runners were arguing with one another in front of several tables. As for the main attraction (aka the meat), I'd have to say that I was disappointed in the lack of any salt on the cuts of beef presented, with the exception of the beef ribs and flank steak.  It's clear that the past reviews have resulted in toning down the seasoning; however, the opposite extreme (bland meat) is just as bad. All in all, I was expecting a much different experience than what I've come to know brazzaz for.  The saving grace on the night was the grilled pineapple (albeit asking for it 5 times) and constant stream of cheese bread.

Be Aware that they charge the maximum of 20% gratuity on tables of 6 or more.  3.) we ordered a bottle of red zin off the menu only to be told it was not in stock.  When I recommended that they bring the higher priced red zin for the same price as the out of stock they would not accommodate.  But shortly after that, the wine manager came over and asked if I ""really"" wanted the original wine and of course I said yes..the original wine that was out of stock ""magically"" appeared.  Personally, I think 20% is  lot for a tip when you are basically serving yourself as this is mainly buffet style.  Keep in mind there is a $25 groupon which we didn't realize until the waitress mentioned it.  I immediately bought the groupon at the table and it was honored.  All in all, I would not return to this restaurant again.  I've eaten at other Brazilian steakhouses that were much more organized and with more choices on their buffet.  The fact that they tried the bait and switch on the wine was a definite downer.",0.8834,0.945,0.055,0.0,0.4412280701754386
2013-11-06,1.0,"There are so many Brazilian steakhouses in Chicago - it's hard to keep track of the good versus the bad (or if they're any different from each other at all!). I don't go to these often, but I cannot resist the siren song of Zed 451 because it is OMGfantastic. I expected good things from Brazzaz as well. And they have shrimp! And, more importantly, my friend and I had a Groupon. The interior is nice and inviting, pretty classy overall. But the first sign I observed of Brazzaz being a poor imitation of its similarly-priced counterparts is the salad bar. It looked somewhat cafeteria-like, without anything looking particularly seasoned or unique to the restaurant. I should admit, though, that the shrimp in tomato sauce (?) were great, especially with the cilantro. My friend and I soon encountered what Ron Swanson would call a ""meat tornado."" The service is very quick in the sense that you will get meat brought to you almost immediately after switching your table card from black to orange. Ah, but quality and quantity...it is sometimes hard to get both. (Example: Here.) Almost all of the steak and beef we had was well cooked and decently seasoned, but it tasted like the metal poles/swords skewering the large roasts. These supposedly premium meats, for which people (without Groupon) pay round $50 a head, taste like pure metal. Maybe, though, the shrimp would be good! But no, sadly. The shrimp were insanely overcooked and gummy. They were so damn salty that it was hard to get that taste out of my mouth. And another selling point is supposedly its grilled pineapple. I got some pineapple, but apart from the gimmick of it being carved for you individually, it was like any other pineapple - that is, I'm not sure where the appearance or taste of grilling was! Zed 451 is roughly the same price and blows Brazzaz out of the water in terms of quality and innovation. Even with a Groupon, my friend and I felt ripped off. I am pretty sure I could taste salt and metal for the rest of the night, too...",0.9943,0.751,0.18,0.07,0.5907610907610908

We let our waiter know he stated that the owner was there and he would come out in couple of minutes to talk to us my wife wasn't upset until we waited over 20 minutes and no manager or the so called owner came to our table. We let our waiter know that know one came out to speak to us he went to the back again and five minutes later a Manager came out he never apologized for what happened he just asked my wife what do you want me to do about your phone being cracked. That's when she became upset and told him that she needed the phone repaired he stated we can give you one of dinners for free and handed her a business card and told her to call tomorrow. In other words were to busy to deal with your problem right now.

I had over 10 servers hit  the back of my chair which keep getting annoying and that is just the start. Our ""main server"" did not come over to clear our plates until we were done with our meal and then he got an attitude with us because we said we were done and there was no need to change them (if you have not been there-they change the plates when you have food on there you don't want to eat anymore). I never got my water refilled once. I saw several servers filling water so I assume it was just our section. We did have several different types of meat come by. Some were extremely salty. We have never had this issue before when coming there.  Usually there is several staff involved, constantly checking to see if we need new plates, water refilled, different types of meat brought over, etc. but not this time. You would think with the price that they would be more on that. I always love the salad bar. The salad bar has Fogo de Chao beat for sure!  After we were finished we waited several minutes for our water to come back which was only the second time we saw him. Mind you our section was not busy! He asked if we wanted dessert and we said yes. He went to get the desserts but never came back..finally he reappears only to wait on every table in the section but ours. Finally I catch his eye and think he went to get the dessert but did not. We waited about 20 minutes for him to finally return and then he rushed through everything. We selected two and he was stated how one took 25 minutes and made it seem like he wanted us out of there. There was several tables free so I did not see the rush and for how much everything is I think he could of been a lot nicer. He rushed off.  Usually after the meal the waiters clears the table of any food particles and makes sure you have water, etc. while you wait. I finally got fed up and talked to the hostess. She sent over the Manager Carlos. Our WHOLE evening changed after that for the better. Carlos is amazing and made our experience like it usually is. He immediately asked for what we ordered and took off the price of our desserts. He brought us a delicious shot of Amarula (which you need to try) and told us all about the story.

We showed up about 5 minutes late for our reservation but because they only had one hostess working - on a Friday night no less - we were asked to wait. Wasn't so bad since it gave us a chance to order the Watermelon Martini and a glass of Malbec which very well may have been the best things we consumed all night.  All the meat was over cooked. I asked for medium and continuously got well because it seemed to be the only option. The salad bar, sides, and rolls were good, but aren't they all at these places? The shrimp, bone-in chicken and rib roast were the only things I would call tasty but each only came around twice in the couple hours we were there. The server asked us if there was anything we wanted more of. We told him those and he - apparently - requested them but we never saw them again.  We ordered a bottle of that Malbec but it was almost ruined by the server who poured us easily 6+ oz per glass. When I tried to stop him he said he couldn't because of their 'pour policy'. Whaaaat? He then re-corked the bottle so tightly we broke the cork trying to let the little bit left in there breath. We ended up asking for an empty glass to pour our excess into. Our two glasses came to about six servings.  The blaring music made for an awkward ambiance in what I envisioned would be a more intimate setting, like Fogo de Chao. Luckily something softer came on during dessert when we relished in a decadent and delicious chocolate mousse. It was the perfect finish to meaty, red-wine-filled meal.

Our reservations were at 8 and we were seated quickly after letting the hostess know we had arrived. it was our first time eating there so we were very excited for the variety of meats and the salad bar. the waitress did a great job of checking up on us throughout the night, the waiters when we first arrived seemed to be showing me more attention than my fiance but after i told them it was his birthday and he deserved extra attention the service was excellent. i was not a huge fan of the bacon wrapped chicken and one of the meats was a bit too salty for my taste but aside from that we really enjoyed our dinner. Of course we got some birthday dessert, we waited a while for the waitress to come out and show us the options but we were in no hurry and we actually fine with digesting our meal a bit before getting dessert.

The hostess the first time I went was nice but the second time they were sooooo rude.  The first time I just got all the meat but a lot of it was fatty. Then I was way too full to eat when the better meats came around.  The second time I went I was more selective and had a better experience because I knew what to expect. Shrimp and pork are good. Most of the meat is really fatty though.  Overall the cost isn't worth it. The staff there was rude and not helpful.

2013-05-24,2.0,"Wasn't quite sure what to do with the star rating, but since I'm dissatisfied and not likely to return, two seems about right. That's why we write reviews as well, right? As far as the food and meal itself goes, it was pretty good. Maybe a notch below Fogo de Chao, but nothing much to complain about. The service was a bit spastic - we got a big rush of attention at the beginning of our meal, but toward the end it seemed like fewer servers were around and the ones that were passed us by. Strange, but the water and clean plate guys were spot on, the buffet was being refreshed frequently, and the waiters were decent. Our problem came after the meal - actually, after we left the restaurant. We valet parked, and when we got home (half an hour away) we quickly noticed our house keys were missing from the key ring. The ring opens to separate the sets, so we were pretty sure they had simply fallen somewhere along the valet trail between the stand and the parking. I called the restaurant to ask for their help, to at least verify that they had the keys before we drove another hour round trip. Their response was that the valet ""is a separate company, so you'll have to call them."" When I pressed, the girl I spoke to said she would inform her manager and they would give me a call soon when they found out anything. I'm still waiting for that call. We eventually just drove back, talked to the valet ourselves, and got the keys. Restaurants and dining out is a service business. What sets you apart from your competition is your willingness to go the extra mile for your customers, when reasonable, to take ownership of issues to make sure they're happy with their experience. This was a simple problem that was very stressful for us, but would have taken the reservation desk literally 30 seconds to walk outside to ask the valet about. We could have been reassured the keys were there or not wasted another hour of time when we needed a locksmith. By saying ""it's not my problem,"" by passing the buck first to the valet company and then to her manager (who, if they even got the message, also clearly couldn't be bothered), this employee basically said ""I can't be put out even the slightest bit to help improve your evening, person who just spent over $100 at this restaurant."" And therefore, I'm saying, ""I can't be bothered to ever return when there are other places that offer better service.""",0.9852,0.815,0.122,0.063,0.4612468671679199
2013-05-23,2.0,"Gave Brazzaz another try for Mother's Day when Mom was in town the other week. This time I think the meats were seasoned better, but it seemed like everything was on the super rare side, like they were rushing the meat due to the huge crowd. Don't get me wrong, I like rare-ish, but this stuff was rare even for me, and my mom doesn't like rare at all, and I'd bet a lot of moms don't ... Also, the buffet was very disappointing. It seems like Brazzaz cheaped out because of the expected big M-Day crowds. Then when we wanted to pay, it took forever to get a check - our waiter kept ducking my eyes and ignoring me, forever to get my card taken, and 3x forever to get my card back. The waiter who took it kept ducking my eyes, I had to shout him down and berate him to get him to come to the table, only to get an, ""OK,"" and again lowered eyes and he walks to another table, no apparent plan to get my card back. At this point my mom is worried they're stealing credit cards numbers -- it was really freaking her out. Then, finally, a separate staffmember, a woman we had not seen yet at all, suddenly shows up with a stack of checks and cards in hands, returning them. I franklythink that our waiter either has a personality disorder or a drug problem, he acted weird around his fellow staffmembers as well when they spoke with him -- the same downturned eyes and apathy. That's just not the kind of person who should be working your floor. I'd like to like this place, but I'm having a hard time, and I'm not sure I'm going to ever go back at this point.

2013-05-22,3.0,"There's not much at this brazillian steakhouse that I haven't seen in Texas De Brazil or Fogo De Chow (been to both of those multiple times), EXCEPT, they came around with fresh pineapple on the skewers, which I thought was very cool, and was a good flavor compliment to the meat. Their salad bar had some sushi rolls which I hadn't seen before, but it was a little lacking in the size and quantity category. Both of the other places I mentioned have a station with many different balsamic vinaigrette and olive oils, this place had 1 bottle of each, sitting on top the salad bar. The little hot station had 4 things on it, and the only thing I grabbed was the tortellini, which looked like it was from one of those multi-colored pasta packs you buy at the store. It was decent, but definitely store bought. Steaks were great, although the top sirloin was really salty, and both the garlic pork and the filet mignon I was served were literally raw on the inside, which definitely wasn't cool. They also never came back out with the prime rib, but in their defense I didn't take the time to stop the waiter and ask for it either. Everything else was great (Lamb, other cuts of steak, sausage). But, it did seem like every single time I said medium they gave me rare. I think they need to turn their fires up a little bit in the back there so the meat can be cooked all the way through. The sides brought to the table were just like Texas's, lightly rolled in flour and fried. Fogo's just has the better fried bananas of any place I've ever been to. I didn't try the mashed potatoes, but they looked alright, and I don't know what it is with them, but those little breads with the butter inside are very strangely addictive. You kinda have to forget about them so you can eat more meat or you'll fill up on them pretty quickly. The creme brulee was a little lackluster, having been noticeably been made from pudding and not from scratch. I make it from scratch in my house, it's not that hard. I did find it interesting that they had a version with bananas on top instead of strawberries, which I hadn't seen before. Although, the star of a good creme brulee is the creme brulee itself, don't completely cover the top with fruit. The fruit (and mint leaf) is there for a garnish, not to be another layer on the dish. All in all, it was a decent experience, everything was clean, the wait staff were very attentive , the food guys even coming to the table with more food even when our little YES/NO buttons were on NO, but I'd probably go to Fogo (which is only a block away).",0.9943,0.823,0.141,0.036,0.5509546703296703

In addition you get the great palate cleansing caramelized bananas, mashed potatoes, and cheese poppers.

2013-04-23,1.0,"I would give this restaurant a zero if I could. This review is based on my dining experience from 2011, which I still remember for reasons that will become obvious soon.  My then-boyfriend, now husband and I were having a pretty good meal, when we got another portion of creamed spinach at our table. After we ate a bit of it, I noticed a sheet of paper sticking out of the spinach (which was not visible when we first received the dish). This paper was very long and had writing all over it (like newspaper).  We called the waiter over and showed him this paper. He immediately ran back into the kitchen and later came back and informed us that this was a cream cheese wrapper that ""had not been on the floor.""  Needless to say, we asked for our check. We were astonished to see that neither of our meals had been comped (we were paying $50 per meal and they also charged us extra for some items like drinks).  My boyfriend did not want to argue and we were both so shocked that we just wanted to leave, so we paid the bill.  The next day, we each called the restaurant and expressed our concern to the management and asked that at least some of our bill be comped, since the bill had not yet been processed.  They basically admitted that we should not have paid for our meal, but told us that there was nothing they could do except give us a certificate for $25! I told them that there was no way we would eat at their restaurant again. No one ever even apologized to us--not at the restaurant and not during our phone conversations. Maybe if they had, we wouldn't have been so upset then and even now.  I am shocked that this place is still in business.

2013-03-27,2.0,"I used to serve at a similar Churrascaria for a few years and never understood why my managers were so incredibly obsessed with perfect customer service.  Now I do.  You see, the thing is, Brazzaz, Fogo, Texas de Brazil, they're all basically the same exact concept with the same meats and very similar salad bars.  The main thing that sets them apart from one another is the service.   So yeah, this is gonna come off as super nit picky.  But if I were a secret shopper and this were the restaurant I used to serve at, my server would have failed.  I won't say his name.  I don't want him to get into trouble.  But he was terrible. I went there last night (Tuesday, 03/26) and first of all, it took him a good 3 or 4 minutes before he came to our table.  Huge no no.    Even the busboy came by my table a few times, apologizing for the server's absence.  He himself seeming confused as to what was taking the server so long.  He finally arrived and my friend and I went to the salad bar.  Ceviche is a plus.  It was pretty good.  But no crispy bacon for the salad?  No soup?  And no little bowls for the chimichurri?  Am I supposed to get a whole plate to put it on?   When it was time to flip the cards over for meat, my friend needed a new plate.  I told him not to worry.  Someone would bring him one.  No one did.  Our server walked by twice, seeing that meat was going on to my friend's finished salad plate.  I would have been seriously scolded if a manager saw that at one of my table's.  So I got up to get him a new plate.   Not once did our server ask how everything was.  He didn't ask if the meat was cooked to our liking.  He didn't ask if there were any cuts we'd like to have come over to our table ( I had to flag him down to ask).   Again.  I'm nit picky.  But these are all things that I did as a server and it was absolutely expected of us.  I also watched how he interacted with his other tables.  I noticed more than once that when a table was done and had left, he would walk over, pick up the check book and immediately look at his tip.  That is so incredibly inappropriate, I cannot even tell you.  ESPECIALLY in an upscale restaurant.  He also did not help any of his bussers clear or set up tables.  Rude.  When it came time for dessert, he didn't bring a tray over.  Every other server I saw had a tray.  Again, if a manager saw me not bring a tray over, but instead just verbally explain the desserts, I would have had a talking to.  Our server also did not offer or show us a liquor tray.  We both had had a glass of wine and each of us ordered our own dessert.  Hello!  Up sell!   I had a BOGO coupon (the only reason I went) and gratuity was added.  20% before tax of the price it would have been had we been charged for 2 meals.  That is actually very cool.  The place I worked at did not add gratuity to a check that used a coupon so I would sometimes have a 6 top paying for only 3 dinners and get a 10% tip.  That seriously blew.  But being a veteran server, I would have been more than willing to leave a little extra.  Not in this case.   So all in all, not a great experience.  Homeboy serving us would be better suited for Applebee's or Friday's.  Not an upscale, white linen spot like Brazzaz.",0.8073,0.875,0.061,0.064,0.515363823419379

I've never been to a Brazilian steakhouse, and as a vegetarian I can't comment on any of the meat except to say that our party of 25+ people all raved about how good it was. I stuck to the salad bar, which was clean, delicious, and good quality. This is a very expensive place to eat ($50 per person or so...) but you really pay for the experience and the table-side meat-carving service. If you want a fun, unique dining experience or are entertaining others, this is a fantastic place to go. If you want a bang for the buck meal, this might not be a good choice. The wait staff was extremely accommodating and the ambiance is fun. I would love to go back and bring my carnivore husband. For those of you not familiar with a Brazilian steak house, you pretty much get your salad to start with (from the salad bar), then you sit at your table and wait for tons and tons of meat options to be brought to you to try. Cool concept, but come starving and be prepared to take a nice long walk afterwards. This particular place was hopping with big parties of 20+ people and did a fantastic job keeping everyone happy, water glasses filled, drinks flowing, and plates being picked up frequently. I was really impressed with how efficient the staff was.",0.9972,0.692,0.283,0.025,0.6481720430107526
2013-03-08,4.0,"I got a Google Offer deal and we decided to go here on 3/7/13 for dinner! It was awesome! The salad bar isn't your traditional salad bar with lettuce and various raw vegies, it should really be called like Cold Bar or something. It had great patisserie type section with cold meats and cheeses. There were also pasta salads and salads with mayonaise type dressings mixed together, and of course raw oysters that were really delicious! I really enjoyed the seared tuna, but their sushi was lackluster (but I didn't come there for sushi). Their hot sides bar was a bit of a let down, as I was excited to try the mushroom risotto, as I love risottos. It was WAY too salty to even finish my small portion I took. We tried ALL the meats and really all were good. But the top sirloin, grilled shrimp, bacon wrapped madelion was the best. The grilled pineapple was disappointing for me, but this might have been because I had a inner slice. So it wasn't ""cooked"" and a bit too tart. I think an outta piece might have been tastier. They continually give you fried banana (or plantain?) and mashed potatoes as a side. They were both awesome! Perfect side to all the meats. I got the white sangria which was fantastic! We ended with the chocolate lava cake which is the BEST I've ever had! It literally spilled into the plate when you cut into it. So delicious and great texture between brownie and cake. The ice cream was icy though. They cook it when you order so it take 10 minutes, but the waiter had told us and we didn't mind at all.

This used to be one of my favorite places to come, and honestly it still is, but I feel like some things just are not the same. I still love the ambiance - this place feels fancy but you can wear jeans. I was a little confused because we started with one server, and ended with another. He was very nice, but I felt like we waited for him a few times too many. I also remember having the meat men (I don't know what their technical term is, but it sounds good to me) coming around more often. They had some different selections this time around - not bad, just different. The meat was still tasty. Some are better than others in my opinion, but that's the point of having all you can eat and being able to try many different things. The salad bar was what disappointed me most. I remember it being AWESOME. I would pile my plate up with all sorts of cheeses and salady goodness. This time, I felt like there weren't many things I even wanted.  Overall, I feel like this place is still way above average and I would come back. They always have great deals - so look for them!

The cheese buns are divine (their signature dish?), the meat is diverse and very well prepared and the staff is friendly though a bit on the casual side.

The non-meaty items are so delicious that I wouldn't mind coming for a vegetarian menu :) As for the prices, when we went on Thursday we paid half of what we paid on a Friday night (approx. $110 for two people), which I didn't find surprising though because, hey, it's date night!

She told me she'd outdo what I did for her birthday, and well...she was right.  The salad bar offers exceptional variety. Honestly, there were times when I almost filled up on the salad bar even before I started getting the meat dishes. There are different kinds of cheese, hot dishes, seafood, bread, and a very wide selection of actual salad items. You'd be hard pressed to not get at least one plate just to try some of the Asiago, mozzarella, manchego and fontinella cheeses with some cold cuts of bacon and salami.  That sounds like a full meal doesn't it? Well I hope you come prepared to eat, eat, and eat some more. I believe Brazazz offers 18 different types of meat skewers and they are served Brazilian style. For those of you that don't know what that is, allow me to explain. You get a coin with orange on one side and green on the other. If orange is facing up, no servers approach you. However, if you have the GREEN side up, every waiter in your area will immediately come by and offer their skewer.  Not only is the service impeccably fast, it's incredibly tasty too. The top sirloin is to die for, and personally, nothing beats the bacon wrapped chicken. Maybe it's because I am a bacon fanatic...who knows. Really, there's not a bad choice. It's really tough to sample all 18 without feeling your belly grow a little bit, so again, you have to come hungry.  It's a little pricey, but you definitely get what you pay for.

He kept repeating that they had set a new expiration date and that I should have known that. I told him that I was never notified of the new date and that I wanted to submit a complaint.

He taught me some things about single malt scotches and elevated my taste in what to look for while also introducing me to using a ""scotch ball"" for making the ice for my single malt scotch.

I don't get a chance to eat at Brazilian restaurants very often because there are not too many around and also because I can't usually eat as much food as I know I will get at a Brazilian restaurant, but when I do go there, it is always a treat and Brazzaz was simply great.

That is exactly how I felt after eating at Brazzaz.   On a Thursday night, we were quickly seated at a table and immediately directed to the salad bar.  If my boyfriend didn't warn me to save room for the meats, I could've easily filled up just from the food at the salad bar.  The assortment of food was superb.  You have your variety of meats and cheeses, raw vegetables, ceviche, pickled items, smoked salmon, ahi tuna, sushi rolls, bread, and of course, every type of salad possible.  The Brazilian chicken salad was delish with its sweet pineapple pieces mixed with it. There was also a row of hot sides near the salad bar, consisting of white rice, black beans, and cheese tortellini, which we purposely avoided. When we made it back to the table, our drinks were ready for us along with a basket of warm cheesy buns, fried plantains, and mashed potatoes.  The wait staff was always on top of things and constantly replenishing our starter dishes (especially the fried plantains!) The cheesy buns were my personal favorite.  They are bite sized and extremely chewy/dough-like in the center.   The moment we flipped our coin to indicate we were ready, we were bombarded with servers...in a good way! There was a constant flow of various meats coming to our table.  I can't recall any meat that left me unsatisfied.  The only disappointment was that my stomach couldn't handle all the food Brazzaz had to offer.  The two dishes that stood out to me was the grilled pineapple and the shrimp...or maybe those were the only two items I could identify after my plate was smothered with meats?

FOOD - I've had waaay better.  The salad bar has a decent selection and it was nice that they had Oysters.  The rice was wattery and the black beans were flavorless.  The fried plantains could have used some sweetness to them. The mashed potatoes.. cold.  The meats were pretty bland and tasteless.  The only thing that stuck out to me was the broasted chicken. Very tastey and I hardly ever go for the chicken at these places.  The top and bottom sirloins were halfway ok, nothing to rave about.  They could use a tastier and more flavorful crust.  The picanha was so so, again more flavor! it was bland.

I'm a little bit of a control freak, so I called tuesday to double check the time for my reservations. Lo and behold, my reservations were AMISS. complete abomination. unforgivable! RAWR!!!! And i had phone records to prove it. After about 5-10 minutes of figuring it out, the gentleman on the phone got back to me; luckily, someone ELSE had to cancel their reservations, so he was able to add me back on. Which was fortunate-- but should never have happened anyway to begin with!  Our reservations were for 8:30. Getting to downtown on Vday was (as expected) a little trouble some.... but come around 8:15 i send my boyfriend in so I could find parking. When he arrived, they were already calling out ""reservations for 8:30?"" so that hawkers would get a chance to nab our seats. Luckily my bf piped in (Again. At 8:15pm), questioning why they were about to give up our table. Hostess said ""you have to be here before 8:30 because at 8:30 we seat you.""  Uhm.. Mr Brazzazz, that would be nice to let people know when you give reservations. I walked in at 8:26. They had to seat my bf so that we couldn't give up the table. (im better at the stress of traffic/downtown driving, which was why I opted to drive there, he'd drive back).  I dunno. I think this was pretty snooty.

Oh! and the bread puffs? they wouldn't let me take home!! so sad. Apparently they nickel and dime. I'd understand if they wouldn't allow a plate of food home, but the complimentary bread basket? we didn't even get a refill and our waiter apologized, saying it was a strict rule, despite that it'd be trashed anyway.

We felt like we were being waited on by 5-6 people and never had to wait more than a couple of minutes for anything. We were a little turned off when one of the waitresses snagged our wine glasses before giving us sufficient time to decide if we were going to have any, but that was really the least of my worries.  The salad bar was wonderful and fresh. I appreciate the fact that they frequently change out the small portions so that everything from the asparagus to the sushi is at the perfect temperature and flavor.  The meat is ultimately what you pay so much for at a place like this (around $48 per person) but it's a steakhouse, so what do you expect? There are 12-14 cuts of meat to choose from cooked at medium to medium rare temperatures with the addition of grilled shrimp and pineapple. You can choose to accept or politely decline any meat you want. All of the meat we had was juicy, tender, and extremely tasty. Very satisfying.  For dessert I chose a classic Brazilian ""Papaya Cream"" which was the perfect ending to a sweet Valentine's day meal.  Although it's a huge space, intimate dining is still possible.

I have never written a bad review before but if I can save one person from going here I will be doing a service to the community.  I went to this restaurant last night with my girlfriend and have never been more dissapointed or unnapreciated at a restaurant in my life.   The waitors are scary!  They all walk around staring at you and make you feel seriously uncomfortable.  Our waitor actually yelled at us for throwing out food but its not our fault that almost everything we got was blue in the middle,  I asked for medium every time the carvers walked around and got a piece of meat that was seriously undercooked and could have killed me.    Also the meats that were properly cooked were extremely salty and fatty.  Everything once carved looked like poor quality meats.  I will admit that their salad bar is pretty good but dont eat any of the hot buffet side items.  They were all cold, gross, and loaded with fat.  Dont get me wrong I don't mind indulging in non healthy items once in a while but these were just gross.   The worst part is Maestro's is across the street and it makes you feel even worse that you wasted so much money on crappy food when an amazing restaurant is right next door. THE COUPON IS A TRAP.  YOU THINK YOU ARE GETTING A GOOD DEAL AND THEN YOU EAT THERE AND FEEL HORRIBLE THE NEXT DAY.  THIS PLACE SHOULD BE SHUT DOWN IMMEDIATELY.  PLEASE DO NOT GO HERE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",-0.9847,0.672,0.123,0.205,0.5051353874883286

Then when I said I was done the waiter yelled at me for leaving food on my plate...yeah because it was gross! We used a buy one get one coupon and the bill was still ridiculous. The server also added gratuity on which I thought was rude seeing as though there were only two of us and he treated us like shit.  The only good things were the salad bar, the grilled pineapple and the rolls but I don't think its worth the price. Never again.

We made a birthday reservation for a Wednesday night and everything was tasting great and most of the wait staff was attentive. About 3/4 of the way through the meal I started to feel very strange. I sat there and drank water for a little while to settle my stomach. My boyfriend then ordered his birthday dessert and I couldn't even sit there to watch him enjoy it. Very shortly after making it to their bathroom I became violently ill.  I couln't even return to our table and had to cancel our plans for the rest of the evening.  I attempted to contact the restaurant the next day to tell them what happened with no response. I waited a few days and contacted them again finally receiving a response in which they said it was basically impossible. They never offered a refund only another opportunity to get sick again with one free meal. No thanks. I've already paid $106 to get food poisoning once.

Service was excellent.  All of the staff was polite and attentive.   The meats were all quite good.  The lamb and filet were very solid.  The flank steak was damn near perfect.  The ribs could have used work.  They weren't awful, but definitely need to be cooked at a lower temp for a longer period of time (I love pork). The salad bar section brought this down.  Just 'meh.'  Nothing was awful, but nothing was above average either.  For the cost, it'd be nice if they didn't skimp it here.

2012-01-01,4.0,"Went for NY's eve, and was pleasantly surprised. I had asked a friend about it before I went, and her suggestion was ""wear stretch pants"". Agreed.  It's a meat-lover's paradise.  The contemporary design was a warm and inviting maroon color, and while it was quite spacious, I would maybe consider spacing the tables  a little further apart (it made navigating to the salad bar a little tricky at times). The servers were very attentive and friendly.  The first stop was the salad bar which had a huge array of food (salad/tasty chicken salad/cold cuts and cheese/ceviche/oysters/artichoke hearts/heart of palm/grilled zucchini and squash/sundried tomato/ahi tuna) with a couple warm dishes (mushroom risotto which was really delicious/cheese tortellini).  Afterwards, we started on the meat... tried the chicken/pork with bacon/filet mignon/sausage/lamb/rump roast/pineapple, and while the cuts of meat were quite flavorful, I felt like I needed maybe some palate cleansing foods in between because everything started tasting very similar after a while. I do have to mention these most delicious cheese biscuits? Well, they were more like popovers in consistency..light but very moist in the middle. I looked up a recipe today and I believe that these are called Pão de Queijo. Most of the recipes have tapioca flour, so it was recommended for people that have gluten sensitivity (I'm not sure what the recipe is at the restaurant so I'd ask if you need to know).  So delicious..also, they gave us some mashed potatoes, and plantains.

The food was really hit or miss all night. The first piece of chicken I got was raw. Many of the filets were more rare than medium(which I requested) or were ""well done"" which were awful. But their house special, top and bottom sirloin and shrimp were amazing. So were the fried bananas. The buffet was also good. I enjoyed the oysters, shrimp salad and ceviche.  My biggest gripe about the place was the service. Our evening started off great. The service was excellent and slowly as the night went on, it turned to the worse. The guachos were good at the start, but later on in the meal, were no where to be seen. I waited more than 15 min for one to stop and never did. I just went to the buffet for more oysters instead. Our waiter spilled wine a few times on the table and covered up the spots with napkins so the manager would not see them.

For one, it's got the most selection on the harvest table with a wide assortment of cold and hot dishes to feast on. The plantains that come to the table are about as mouthwatering as the rolls and regardless of how much meat I eat, I always ask for seconds on the rolls and plantains.  I find that the gauchos here are more personable and pleasant. Everyone is extremely informative on how the drill works. The ambiance is a little classier and special than the competing restaurants in this genre. This has a more romantic feel to it, although I'd hardly call anything about shoving your face full with your body's weight of delicious grilled and cured meats romantic. Doubt it is going to send anyone home for some intimate moments. The tables seem a little more secluded though which I appreciate since I feel it necessary to attempt to hide my gluttonous consumption here.  With additions like grilled shrimp and grilled pineapple to help cleanse your pallet between the rounds of seasoned meat is just a nice touch that some of the others don't have.

Brazzaz is a fun venue to go with a large group and they accommodate groups well (definitely make a reservation though). While the price tag is a bit heft (about $50 per/person for the food; it is a fixed price and then all you can eat), you do receive a lot for your money.  The meal starts with an elaborate salad bar with all sorts of fun options such as raw oysters (the cocktail sauce is really good), ceviche salad, sushi rolls, various salamis and some really good cheese and much more. Be careful not to fill up though as Brazaz is all about the meat. You have a little disc (it looks like a casino chip) and you put it on one side if you want the waiters to bring you meat, one side if you are all set for the time being. Every couple of minutes a waiter comes by carrying a cut of meat, each waiter carrying something different (i.e. filet mignon, sausage, flank steak, grilled shrimp, chicken, pork etc.). There are also a couple of non-meat dishes such as roasted pineapple and fried bananas. The freshly baked mini popovers they place on your table were extremely tasty. The food is not top quality, but is pretty good and it is plentiful. Our primary server (Laura) was very friendly and attentive. There is a full bar, decent wine list and lots of good looking desserts if you somehow manage to save room.   If you are looking for a feast, love meat and want a festive atmosphere Brazzaz is a great choice.",0.994,0.814,0.176,0.009,0.5752117673992675

2011-10-09,3.0,"I went there for a special date night with J.  It was fun getting dressed up to go out on a real date again.  After being together for years, we just took going out on a date for granted.  Not anymore! Not going to lie, we went there because we got the buy one get one free coupon in the mail.  We went on a Thursday night... didn't think we needed a reservation, but we apparently we did.  We waited for about 40 minutes.   While we were waiting, we went to the bar.  The bartender seemed like she was new and a bit flightly/slow.  We wanted a bottle of red wine to go with our meat later.  I asked to sample between two different Malbecs (both offered by the glass... so it would be no trouble to have a quick sip).  She didn't know she could do that and had to ask permission- Strike 1.  We picked a bottled and she wanted us to close the tab with her. No problem.  But she didn't know how to ring up a bottle- she was like most people get win by the glass not bottle, so she had to ask how to ring it up.  Okay fine- Strike 2.  Then it was time for her to open the bottle- she didn't know how to open it properly, I asked her if I could help, otherwise, the cork would break... she said no, she got it.  Long story short, she broke the cork and had to get someone to help her get the cork out without it falling into the win. Strike 3.  We finally got our wine, it did have a little bit of cork floating it in, but whatever... didn't want to deal with her again.  But if someone is going to get a $55 bottle of wine, I would expect it not to have cork in it... but whatever. We got to our table and we gave our waiter the coupon.  He didn't seem happy about it- I guess there were a lot of people with the coupon.  Plus- we had already gotten our wine at the bar as well, but whatever.   The salad bar was good- I loved the raw oysters.  I love the mushroom risotto as well.  Everything was labeled and clean and fresh and it was good.  The little rolls weren't as good as they were at Fogo, but it was decent.  The salad bar here is better... so its a good tradeoff.   The meats were good- it didn't seem like they came around that much.  J literally had to flag one down because he passed us twice!  The server didn't seem as attentive to us than he was to other tables who didn't have the coupon.  Oh well.  The meats were good- but whenever I seem to ask for medium rare, I never really got it.  Some cuts were better than others.  It seemed like there were a lot more chicken and pork rather than the actual beef as well.  The kicker was when the manager (the only time he came over) about 1/2 way through our meal asked us if we left our bottle of wine at the bar.  He didn't asked how we were doing or how to meal was or if he could send over any of the meats for us.  He was like the bartender said that you left your bottle of wine in the bar.  We still had our empty bottle on our table... Apparently this girl thought it was our bottle of wine (even though she opened the bottle, poured a glass or two for a server who to ordered it for another table and forgot, and then thought it was our bottle). We could have said yes and taken the bottle, but 1) we were honest and said no, we took our bottle of wine to the table and 2) we still had our empty bottle ON OUR TABLE IN FRONT OF HIM!   We MIGHT have taken it if the server was more attentive and took our empty bottle of the table... but it would have been wrong.  But then again... 1/2 a bottle of wine would have been nice considering the poor service we got from the bartender and server!",0.997,0.791,0.146,0.063,0.5158699679191482

I went there with a coupon, buy one dinner at full cost (48.50) and get a 2nd complementary meal, but it turns out that i had paid more than expected because of a 15% gratuity which they added to the full price of $97.

FInally, the meat.  The meat was all overcooked, and charred, leaving a bad taste in our mouths.  The variety was slim and most cuts didn't even make it to our table, even after asking the staff (who was an overall-fake friendly and didn't seem happy with their forced smiles).  The best thing about the entire place was the grilled pineapple, which we could never seem to get because they would run out by the time they got to our seating area.

I called ahead and asked about the price. The hostess told me clearly it was $38.99 a person for dinner. I asked her to confirm that it was $38.99 a person, which she did. She also told me that six and under was free and 7-10 was half price. When we got our bill, we were charged incorrectly for an extra dinner, which the waiter corrected for us. But it wasn't until later that I realized that we were charged $48.99 for each dinner and not $38.99. At 7 dinners, that is a substantial difference. 2. Our meal took a very, very long time. About half way through our dinner, another large group got up to leave and another large group sat down at their table. The second large group finished at the same time we did. We were there 2.5 hours, and 30 minutes of that time was waiting for desserts. 3. We were having a birthday, and someone in our party started the night by giving the hostess a nice tip and asking her to make sure we got a ""surprise"" birthday cake. Unfortunately, this hostess (see #1 above) never communicated this to the servers, so no cake came. I felt bad for the servers, who were very apologetic, since they never got the message.  All in all, the food was pretty good. The salad bar was not as nice as Fogo. The servers were very nice - they did the best they could, and I appreciate that.

We went to the buffet (WHICH IS FREAKING AWESOME) and piled up.  The Mushroom risotto is out of this world! As is their shrimp salad.  I didn't try anything I didn't like! On to the meat.. DELISH!  They came often and the server always asked us if there was something specific we wanted to try and made sure to send them to our table.  We got full pretty fast but was able to sample most things.

In my opinion I think it is just a ""fancy version"" of a pig-trough.

It was on a friday and it wasnt too busy which was good. General decor and ambience was not all that impressive. We were seated and immidiately 3 people came up and began pooring water, taking drink orders and so forth. One of the men pouring our water, i thought was one of the bus boys, but he turned out to be our waiter. We asked for menus and they told us they dont have menus. So we asked what the options were and the cost. Our WAITER: ""ummm what is today, friday.......well the meat meal is 39.50 and if you only want the salad bar its between 25 and 30 bucks. So our waiter wasnt even sure??? Meal then went fine, food was average to above average but I must admit the salad bar is very good. Lots of options and unique dishes. And now the disaster. We got our check and we were charged for 3 ""meat"" dinners at 48.50 a plate. We only had 2 meat dinners and 1 salad bar for the 3 of us. So our waiter came and gave us a little trouble because he thought we all got the meat. So he went and changed 1 meal to the salad bar at 29.50 but left the other two dinners at 48.50 which HE TOLD US was 39.50, and would not change it because he said he made the mistake, whatever sense that makes. So we go to the front to speak to the manager and after explaining he had a smirk on his face and said ""im sorry, our waiter made a mistake and told you the wrong price of our meals.. Its 34.50 mon thru thur and 48.50 fri and sat. He explained there is nothing he can do and we must pay the 50 bucks a plate even though we were told 40 and the waiter made a mistake. He said the money would come out of his pocket if he changed it and was unwilling to do so. WOW, for a resteraunt that gets the attention this one gets i have never experience a more unsatisfactory experience. Needless to say that waiters tip instantly got included in the bill, NO SOUP FOR YOU. So my overall opinion would be this, with the options available in Chicago for brazilian steak houses and visiting almost all of them myself, i WILL NEVER go back to Brazzaz. Fogo de chao hands down has better food (meat). The service blew Brazzaz out of the water and the overall ambience and environment is much better. There is nothing worth anything close to $50 a plate at brazzaz. I will say the salad bar is good, if thats all you looking for. Fogo de Chao is def the best brazilian steakhouse in the city.

We saw shrimp once and had to specifically request for them to come by with it at least 4 times before we even saw it again near the end of our dinner.

2010-04-16,2.0,"My review is based on a one time visit and also  a couple factors that may or may not have hindered my overall dining experience here.  First - parking is impossible so either be prepared to valet which I ended up doing after driving around for 15-30 min, or park in the garages near by.  But that is not in their control either way.... Second- I would suggest coming on a week night if possible, because when I came it was a Friday and that was bad news. The waiting area was over crowded all the way into the bar area which was equally as crowded.  Beside coming on a weekend it was also restaurant week at the same time so that I'm sure made for it being extra super crowded.  Aside from the lack of room to breathe, once we got our table things got a little better. In total I was with a table of 4 other girls, with me at the far end of the table.   Food: The selection of appetizers was not what I expected. You have the typical salad variations, cold meats and cheeses, some sushi, and some veggies and really, that's what can I remember. Maybe I missed it but I was hoping there would be some soup or something. It just seemed a little bit lacking as far as selections go. After finishing that we were ready for the meats! The selection of meats brought to our table seemed to be small and also not the best I have had in comparison to some other Brazilian steakhouses. I like my meat med rare and most meats were on the med side. Service: I understand that it was a busy night for them and I'm willing to put that aside but what confused and then eventually annoyed me was the servers would bring their meats to both ends of the table only some of the time. The majority of the time they would ask the closer end and then not really even listen to see if the opposite end would like some before leaving. We really didn't have a lot of people at our table so I don't think that it would much of a hassle if they went all the way around our table instead of just staying at one end.  After two failed attempts to get the meat I was waiting for, I no longer even wanted it any more.  I guess a positive was that they were really good at keeping our glasses full of water and also replenishing the bread basket.  And for dessert we tried the tiramisu and flan- I recommend the flan out of the two.",0.8901,0.873,0.075,0.052,0.49718204775022967

We were quickly seated with every other patron in the smallest area there....an area so overcrowded I had to walk a huge loop nearly out the front door to get from the salad bar to our table.  I know they seat everyone together to aid the meat service, but it is hard to enjoy your meal when you are forced to listen to the cell phone conversation of the table across the way and the smacking lips from the table next to you.   Due to this set up, we were able to taste most of the meat rather quickly.  Nothing really stood out, and a number of smaller items (ribs,  both types of chicken and the pork tenderloin) were overcooked and cold on arrival. The only thing either my wife or I really wanted more of were the shrimp, but they won't give you more than 2 at a time.   Since the coupon included dessert we asked for to see the display and then sat and waited....and waited.... I will skip the full details, but it took 45 minutes to receive our desserts and pay the bill.  Given the speed of the main part of our meal (~30 minutes), I had foolishly let the server take my drink.   In the end the desserts were the highlight of the night.  The meat was less than stellar, and I would have rather spent the money on a good steak or two at Whole Foods and cooked them myself.  Overall I would have given Brazzaz 3 stars if not for the rather long and annoying delays at the end of the meal.

2010-03-05,1.0,"If I can write a review with ZERO stars, this is definitely one of those places to do so. It took me a week after Restaurant Week to write about this horrible experience because it makes me so angry every time I sit down to begin to write about it. Here's what went wrong in short: 1. 55 minutes wait with a reservation (yet they were seating people without reservation ahead of us) 2. Waiter/busboy was not helpful with anything 3. I asked for the manager but instead got the floor team leader 4. Rude hostess  5. In our 2.5 hours dining there, we were served the filet mignon once because it actually ONLY came around once. 6. I asked for tiramisu and they served me carrot cake, thinking I wouldn't notice the difference. Infuriating but at this point, can only laugh about it. Here's what went wrong in long version: Is there a difference between making a reservation and a walk-in? NO. I made a reservation for two at 8 PM on a Saturday night thinking it will be crowded and should probably make a reservation so that we don't have to wait like walk-ins. We went in about 10 minutes before our reservation starving because we just spent 8 hours ripping out vinyl flooring at our new dig. The hostess told us that they are running ""a little behind"" and that the wait will be AT LEAST 30-45 minutes. We got a special chip with our number and was told to wait. WHAT KIND OF PLACE TELLS SOMEONE WITH RESERVATION THAT THERE'S A 45 MIN WAIT??? Meanwhile, we noticed that people with beepers (no reservation) were being seated before us. WHAT! How does this work again? I would assume people with reservations get priority seating. After 45 minutes was up, I went up to the hostess to ask if we are being seated soon. She rudely responded with sans eye contact ""What do you think I've been working on?"" then mumbled something else which I couldn't hear. Frustrated because at that point, anywhere else we would go would also be a wait. 10 minutes later, we were seated. The total waiting time with reservation was 55 minutes. After we were seated, we were greeted by the waiter. He seemed nice enough in the beginning: explaining to my husband whose never being to this type of establishment how it works. We went to the salad buffet area to find that there was nothing special about it. Yes, the mushroom alfredo risotto thing was good but again, it's pretty average. The meatballs tasted like something out of Costco's frozen section. The sushi looked like it's been sitting out there for a week, which made me scared to try their raw oysters. The meat served was ok. It's great that it's unlimited but really, all the better cut meat only came around ONCE in our 2.5 hours there. The meat servers were really nice and I have to say the best part of our entire horrible dining experience. There was one busboy there who bussed NOTHING the entire time we were there and our plates were just piling up with crap and he stood there the entire time, about 5 feet away from out table.  Frustrated, I was ready to go. Our server showed up after only checking up on us once our entire 2.5 hours meal asking us if we want desserts because it came with the restaurant week special. We said ok and looked at the dessert menu. Ready to order, he then said we only have three choices: tiramisu, flan, or chocolate mousse. Well, why didn't he tell us this before??? My husband ordered the flan and I ordered the tiramisu. He comes back 35 minutes later with two flans and what looked like carrot cake. He puts the flan in front of my husband and the carrot cake in front of me. No explanation. I was confused because I was pretty sure I ordered tiramisu. He started walking away and I stopped him to ask if that's the tiramisu. He said, ""No, it's carrot cake."" I said ""But I ordered the tiramisu."" He then explained that they ran out so he thought I'd like the carrot cake. I told him no, I don't want the carrot cake, in this case, I would like the flan. Keep in mind, there's a flan still sitting on his tray. He said ok but instead of giving me the flan that is already ON his tray, he left and gave the flan to the table next to us, who ordered desserts about 20 minutes after me. I was dumbfounded. Then I asked the busboy who stood there the entire time what is the name of the manager because I planned on writing a letter to the BBB and CC'ing the manager. He asked if I wanted to see him, I said no, but he went off looking for him. I thought ok, fine, I am ready to let the manager have it. 10 minutes later, he came back with a guy who is NOT the manager who said he understood how I felt and he is on MY side. As soon as he turned around and started walking away, I heard him scolding the busboy about asking him to come to us. My flan came 15 min later and I was ready to wrap it up to go. Done and never again will I return to this subpar establishment. I much rather go to Fogo which has better meat and flavor anyways.

The salad bar was amazing - but I was careful not to fill up on the healthy stuff... I was in the market for beef! Nice selection though, from capresse salad to mushroom risotto to sushi (sushi didn't look to hot though).  The meat... ohh the meat. Every piece was my favorite piece.

2010-03-05,3.0,"Went there with a party of 4 for dinner a few weekends ago during restaurant week on a Saturday night and oh my goodness, that place was a madhouse. We had reservations for 7 pm but didnt get seated until 8! We kept checking in up front and they apologized profusely but apparently, they were running very behind with the sea of people they were dealing with. I guess it worked out because we were all famished for the all you can eat churrascaria! When you are first seated, they bring you a small plate of mashed potatoes, plantains.. and I can't remember what else. It's odd that they don't offer that at the salad bar but it was okay since none of us really wanted anything other than the meat!! The salad bar had a variety of items that I did not want to really try (first, because again, I did not want to get full... gotta save room for the meat! and second, sushi at a brazilian steakhouse?? no thanks, i'll pass). As for the meat, I got to try everything they were offering that night and my favorites were the pepper filet, garlic beef coulette, bacon wrapped filet, and parmesan pork. The others were okay but I could live without it. Too bad they offered all my favorites at the way end after I flagged down our waiter to tell him that I wanted to try those before leaving. Our dinner included dessert and of course, with the sea of people, they ran out of chocolate mousse (after the waiter tells us ""it's really good, its my favorite! but we dont have anymore"".... cmon, seriously?? thats just evil!!). so, we ordered chocolate cake which was just okay, cheesecake which was too rich for my liking, and dulce de leche cake which im assuming was good since it was all eaten by my fiance's friend.  So, with all those things in mind, I have to give the restaurant 3 stars. The salad bar and desserts were mediocre in my mind which is not a problem, since the real highlight of the meal is the meat. The meats were good.. but a lot of them were cooking way too overdone for my liking (medium well to well done).

My husband and I had 6PM reservations yesterday and we were seated right away. The server was a gentlemen but a little too in-your-face if you're the standoffish type like me. His humor was also odd - he doesn't have the right delivery. We had never been to Brazzaz and didn't realize that we get to eat all the meat we want, so we asked how it worked for restaurant week.

Hardy-har-har. Leave your comedy act at home. The salad bar was superb. Every single option was delicious, and there were so many things to choose from! Goat cheese, roasted corn salad, Brazilian potato salad, roasted squash and zucchini, fresh tomato slices with mozzarella, shrimp salad, fresh salmon, cheese tortellini, and my fav mushroom risotto. Oh yeah, and salad greens.

One lamp chop may be perfectly cooked and my 2nd one may be incredibly salty and overdone.

We had a reservation at 8:30pm and we were running a little late so we called to let them know we would be 15 minutes late. The host looked up our reservation, changed the time and said it was all set. We arrived close to 8:50 and somehow during the 20 extra minutes it took to get there, they lost our reservation.  We were told they would bump us up on the waiting list and it would only be a 10-15 minute wait for the two of us. I was fine with that so we decided to wait... 40 minutes later as we watched almost everyone that came in after us get seated we were starving and grumpy. My boyfriend went up (at now 9:40) to ask what the hold up was. They thought we were a group of four.. You would think with five hostess' things would go smoother than this!! Finally, we were seated... in the worst seat possible. We sat right next to the stairs and with me sitting on the inside, barely having any room to breathe (much less, eat), and my boyfriend getting shoved and smacked by every waiter, gaucho, and busboy running by. But we were still gracious and just decided to enjoy the rest of the evening. We ate and the asado was good (nothing to rave about), but I gotta say the mushroom risotto was pretty fantastic. Not that you would pay that much just to get some dang risotto.. It was the highlight of my evening.  Now the bill comes.. After making a reservation for restaurant week (which they lost) and telling the waiter earlier in the evening we were there for RW we were still overcharged!  In a nut shell, my visit here was utterly disappointing..",0.9384,0.91,0.066,0.024,0.5296536796536796
2010-02-23,2.0,"Everything said below here in the reviews with 3 stars or less is absolutely true.   Fogo does everything better than this place. Salad Bar was nice.... The Charcuterie was my favorite paired with some nice cheese and wine.  It starts to snowball from there (not any of the numerous good types of snowball... If i've lost u go to check out some of the many definitions on urban dictionary) The infrequency of the better cuts of meat is all about cost control, it detracts from the overall experience, so much so that the first table the fillet or rib eye gaucho stops at will be his last 50% of the time, seriously the guy comes out of the kitchen with 8 oz of the cut, versus the pineapple man who is always fully stocked.   Second point to places like this stop dumbing down food and preparing everything well done, the poor cow or lamb is already dead, there is no need to incinerate its remains to the point where I get a piece of carbon, if I wanted coal I'd just be naughtier.  You CANNOT UNCOOK meat, prepare the dish properly and if there is a misanthrope out there just char the rest of the life out of a cut for that poor soul who cant get over a small amount of red in their RED MEAT!!!!!!!  If you are dining with me and you order any red meat medium-well or above and I am paying you are not going to be asked to return. Which is a huge dilemma due to the fact that my mother-in-law to be did this at a higher end Chicago Steak Emporium, perhaps we haven't dined together recently for a multitude of reasons.  But i digress. Brazzaz needs to improve their attitude in all aspects of the game because Fogo wipes the floor with them, FOGO 9 Brazzaz 3 inning 8.  Gosh the boys of summer can't get from AZ to CHI soon enough. This place is dressed sloppily and trips over its own shoelace, as it slowly ambles towards the door to greet you.  Normal review pending but the 2 Yelp Stars say it all, I've been to the mountain top and I'll refuse to dine at this base camp.",-0.3079,0.874,0.059,0.067,0.4365972222222222

We were offered no apologies and nothing for waiting. The manager kept talking me in circles and making my whole experience worse. Once we sat down the waiter made it a point to let us know 4 or 5 times that it wasn't his fault we had to wait. I understood it wasn't his fault and had no intention of blaming him. He just added to the frustration of the night. The food was fine but not worth the wait. There are too many Brazilian Steak Restaurants in the area to deal with this place.

2010-02-22,3.0,"We came here for Restaurant Week.  Since nothing is different between coming here on any other night and this, Brazzaz asks you to note in the reservation that you are coming here for RW so you can get the discounted price.  We did, and when we came in the hostess reiterated that back to us and put a little paper on our table noting it.  OK, so far so good.  We came early enough that the place was quite empty and gave us time to settle and give it a good once over.  We then get a server, who may or may not have told us his name, but I was immediately put off by his rather smarmy, faux charming way.  He asked if we would like recommendations off the wine list, which was my mistake for saying yes.  He then launched into this rather lengthy, over the top explanation of about 6 different wines, all of which sounded like he had memorized the ratings out of Wine Spectator:  ""now THIS is our most ambitious Cabernet. It's a low production, 100% Cab, aged for more than two years in the barrel. Fantastically rich in blackberries, cherries, chocolate, anise, sandalwood and dusty spices, wrapped into smooth, fine tannins.""   Uhhhhmmm, yeah. Got it big guy! Oh look it's also $165?  (note that the wine list here is VERY pricey - you are going to find most bottles over $100 and nothing is under $35).  When he saw I wasn't interested in playing the wine game with him and chose a ""low end"" (read: $41) bottle of California Merlot, which by the way was delicious! he got disappointed and left.   The buffet area was on the small side and had few things I was interested in (I guess thats a good thing? save room for the meat?) The oysters were cloudy and dull, and without much flavour. The cheese selections were nice as well as the asparagus spears and the salad.  Sushi looked disturbingly old and I didn't chance it. So after that the meat comes around.  I thought we got a good sampling of most of their offerings,  but it seemed they were taking care to only bring around more expensive cuts such as filet mignon very sporadically.  The pineapple guy came to us probably about seven times whereas Andy only got one chance at the lamb chops.  (BTW grilled pineapple...is the bomb. Seriously). Then, to add insult to gluttony, not only do they bring MORE food to the table, such as small plates of creamed spinach, mashed potatoes and little popover-style buns....once you finish the plate they immediately replace it with a new one!  Dear god.   Soooo, about 7 billion calories later, we finally wave the white flag.  It takes a while to flag Smarmy Guy down in order to give us a check and when he does, it is for the pre-Restaurant Week amount.  Now, normally I would just chalk this up to an honest mistake, but from the time of the reservation until the time we sat down it was pretty clear we were here for that reason (see first paragraph).  So I had to make him change it, which is always uncomfortable for me.   Oh and not that it mattered at that point because we were so grossly overfed, but we were never asked if we had any specific meat we were waiting to try nor were we asked to see the dessert cart. I guess the upselling stopped once we got the ""cheap"" wine?  Who knows.   Not only am I not a fan of buffets, but Brazzaz brings the meaning of the word ""gorgefest"" to a whole new level.  I would say it is a novelty and to maybe try the Brazilian Churrascaria theme once to say you did it, but to save your heart, waistline and wallet, to maybe keep it at that.",0.9948,0.783,0.14,0.077,0.519030583613917
2010-02-19,4.0,"Brazzaz is not for the faint hearted. Between the truck loads meat, great wine and the Beautiful Carmen Miranda lookalike peddling Spanish Liqueur, even a partially clogged artery could be fatal.   A visit to Brazzaz is about living the good life. It's comparable to a woman buying an expensive spa treatment, or a middle aged man who splurges on a $50.00 Cigar. There are times in life where you just need to treat yourself, and Brazzaz is the perfect place to do it.   I was a bit worried when we entered the restaurant. Only a few of the tables were occupied. It was a needless worry. The place filled up quickly as the restaurant came alive. Halfway through our meal, the restaurant was filled with people enjoying themselves.  For those of you who have never experienced a Brazilian steak house, the premise is simple. A buffet for the sides, and servers bringing you different types of meat and carving them for you at your table. You have a small token that has two sides. One side means that you do not wish service and the other side of the token means that you wish to gorge further.   The highlights of the meal were:   Lamb Chops: Tender and juicy, and marinated to perfection.   Bacon Wrapped Fillet Mignon: Need I say more  Flank Steak: Basted with Garlic and Black pepper. It was a tender cut of meat with a nice kick to it.   Rib Shank: Basted with a mild BBQ sauce. Tender and juicy with a wonderful tang to it.   The Bread: The small buns have the texture of a Popover. It tasted like they were baked with a glaze of butter. They were fluffy and delightful.   The bottom line is this. Brazzaz is not a place that you could eat at every day. For one, you would go broke and secondly  you would probably have a fatal grabber. But if you are looking for a taste of the good life, even just for one night, Brazzaz will feed you like a king.

LOL)   In any event, the pineapple really helps clear your pallet in between trying different meats.  We also ordered a bottle of wine which came in this really unique wine dispenser, that was super fun!

As soon as we got there, they told us that even though we had a 6 o'clock reservation, we would not be seated until 7 because of how many delays they were experiencing. My boyfriend explained to him that we had tickets to see ""Million Dollar Quartet"" at 8 so we needed to be seated as soon as possible. The hostess said that she understood, but they had overbooked for the weekend. While we were waiting for our reservation to be filled, a man walked in with his date asking for a talbe and was told that they could not seat him because it was reservation only. He must have slipped the hostess some cash because he was seated 45 MINUTES before us and still sitting at a table near us when we were finally seated. We were very rushed to eat and could not enjoy the experience because of how late they sat us. We ate what we could manage and then went to the valet still giving us ample time to get to the Appollo Theater. However, the valet LOST OUR CAR KEYS!! Yes, you read that right. After telling us for 30 minutes that the car was on the way, they pulled us aside and said that they misplaced the keys. What actually happened was that the key broke off the autolock key chain, causing the key to lay in the street the entire time we were in the resturant. By some glorious miracle, the valet attendant found our key on the ground and brough the car to us. We were so lucky that some passer by didn't find the key before he did. My boyfriend was SO furious that he told me to wait with the car (45 minutes after we asked for it) so he would go talk to a manager. From what he told me, he went inside and asked the hostess to speak with someone, and the hostess simply ignored him. After several minutes of waiting, she finally looked at him and said NO, the manager was far to busy to listen to anyones complaints. We were not able to make our play (Appollo Theater understood and reissued our tickets for next week) because in total, we were an hour and a half late for the play.

2010-01-24,3.0,"Can't believe I haven't written a review for this place!  I've only been here once, but I really enjoyed it. First of all, DO NOT PAY FULL PRICE!  I get those ""buy one, get one"" or just plain ""$35.00 meal"" coupons in the money mailer ALL THE TIME.  So be patient, wait for your money mailer, and save yourself up to $25 a head. Second, I haven't been Fogo or Texas de Brazil, so I'm not going to make any comparisons.  I did enjoy Brazzaz, though.  The meats are decent (although some cuts were a bit over-salted), the shrimp was good (I went for dinner, there was shrimp.  It was one of my fave things!), and the salad bar is pretty extensive.  However, I wouldn't say that the salad bar was spectacular--lots of cold salad-mix kind of things. The best part of the meal, by far, was the pineapple.  I'm a HUGE carnivore, but I found that I just couldn't get through that many cuts of meat!  Also, I didn't honestly want to taste twelve different cuts of steak cooked with exactly the same seasonings.  The pineapple, though, was out of this world.  I think the sugars carmelized when grilled, so it was the best, most mind-blowing, juicy, sweet pineapple ever (and I've had some really good pineapple).  I think I had more servings of pineapple than I did of meat, and I was glad that I didn't pay full price, because I'd feel pretty silly paying $59.99 or whatever the full price dinner is to eat $4.99 worth of pineapple.   However, although I enjoyed my experience, it's not a place I'm likely to revisit.  The meat was just overwhelming, a bit over-salted, and all similar-tasting.  For the same price, I think I'll hit up a steakhouse and get a really cool (smaller) cut of steak.",0.9958,0.738,0.208,0.054,0.6083020050125313

2010-01-20,4.0,"Dear Brazzaz, you are like that moody, bi-polar girlfriend. Yet, during those week-long silent treatments, the thought of those lofty highs where you make us breakfast in bed everyday are what keep us from kicking you to the curb. Hence, the four stars.  We've been to Brazzaz three times now, the first time was on a Friday night and BLEW OUR SOCKS OFF. Every single cut of meat was cooked juuust right and I had never tasted meat that was so mind-blowingly flavorful. Even their selections are the bar were good... excellent mushroom risotto, all-you-can-eat sushi and oyster? Closet fat girl's dream. I think I gained three pounds instantaneously that night.  The second time we went for a Saturday lunch, and it did not live up to the glory of the first. The selection was considerably less, the meat was overcooked and well... bland. Thinking that it was just how lunch was and maybe they just serve mainly the leftovers from the night before, we went again a third time. This time we chose Saturday for dinner at 10 PM, half an hour before they close since it was the only time we could get a reservation. Failure yet again.  Maybe we came too late and no fresh meat was being cooked? I feel like an abused girlfriend trying to blame herself. But we will never give up.... that first time was just THAT GOOD. I refuse to believe that I will never again taste meats of that immense selection that good ever again. So, Brazzaz, if this is a ploy to take all our monies (and you have taken lots... back to the gf reference), you win. But we will you at least be good to us again?

Our server sat us down and asked if we have been there before. Aaron stated no but we have been to a Churrascaria before and she remarked, rather sarcastically ""Oh so you have been to our competition?"" Um nice impression lady. Then Aaron mentioned we choose them this time because they have shrimp. Oh no that's only on the dinner menu. Ok then...indicate that somewhere on your online menu or actually pick up your phones, so that kind of awkwardness can be avoided?  So first up the salad bar. The cerviche was darn tasty. The rissto and tortelini in alfredo sauce was excellent too. Other than that? It was pretty forgettable. I almost actually gave them an extra star for the risotto but no, i thought better of that because I do not think of risotto when I think of Churrascarias... The main offerings? Fillet with bacon, excellent. The top and bottom sirloins? Also excellent. The top was really salty in that good way. Leg of lamb, also flavorful. The house specialty? Not so much. Very bland to me. The chicken legs? Also bland. Also the variety of offerings was lacking. Thirteen meats? I don't think so. Where is the red meat? There was more pork than anything else. The pineapple going around was a nice touch but he came around way too many times. I was also not a fan of their sides, like so much  that I am even wondering why I am wasting the word space to say so.  Too the service left something to be desired.

2010-01-17,3.0,"For an all-you-can-eat location where meat arrives on your plate like a magical faucet that can be turned on and off at your whim, it's disturbing for me to have to give an overall score so low for this place. I admit my only benchmark for Churrascaria is Fogo de Chao, which means I haven't yet been to Texas de Brazil.  And as much as my gal Char will give me ""I told you so""s for choosing to try here before trying Texas, let me just retort that if the reviews are right, going here third would have been a BIGGER disappointment.  Because I am already disappointed with Brazzaz. 80% of my disappointment comes from their website and their robo-phone.  I wanted to research the place, so I look to their website.  I look through the list of meats, and found shrimp!!  My favorite, in AYCE format?  I'm in!  (Also saw lobster, which the website says is a la carte.  Meh.) The website also has a copyright of 2005, which speaks volumes.  So I figure I should call them up and verify some information.  Well, I dialed the number (during business hours) and after a 2-minute robo message going through options, it said for an operator, stay on the line.  It then yelled ""LET ME TRY THAT EXTENSION"" and rang a few times, then dropped me back at the start of it all!  I even tried a few options I didn't want just to get to a human.  Same results. Well, the website also listed the salad bar as having calamari and crab salads, as well as ""shrimp cocktail and fresh sushi"".  Good enough for me. We arrived and the disappointment began.  Our server asked us if we'd been here before,  and I honestly answered ""No, but we've been to Churrscarias before"" and her retort was ""oh, so you've been to our competition?""  Nice hostile banter, lady.  I meant it as a ""we understand the Meat Token method"", but yes, we loved Fogo de Chao every time.  So I said ""yea, but we heard you guys have shrimp, so we had to try you out"". Server: ""Oh, our shrimp is only for dinner."" Disappointed Aaron: ""Oh.  Well, we also read your salad bar has shrimp cocktail, so that'll do nicely anyway."" Server: ""Oh, I think they might have changed that."" Too-Disappointed-to-Inquire-About-Sushi Aaron: ""Dang."" You'd think that to be serving a table with someone already initially disappointed and familiar with your competition would mean you should take EXTRA EFFORT to win them over in any way possible.  But there was no ""let me see what I can do for you"" or anything like that.  That was the end of the friendliness from our server who apparently deemed us a ""lost cause"". We hit the salad bar and of course there's no sushi.  The closest I saw was a ceviche salad that had tilapia in it.  Thanks for the lies, website. Fortunately, their one saving grace was the risotto, combined with the three-color tortellini in alfredo sauce as runner-up.  And I'm wanting to award a bonus star just for those dishes...  but that's NOT BRAZILIAN STEAKHOUSE.  You lucked out with an awesome dish that is not the focal point of your establishment. Side dishes: Better garlic mashed potatoes than Fogo.  Same cheesy roll things, which are delicious but kinda filling after 3 baskets.  Failure with the fried banana.  I love Fogo's caramelized sweet soft bananas.  These are just breaded and fried bananas that are still tough and rather bland.  And without fried polenta, the side dishes simply cannot compare. The MEAT: Well, the only real difference is adding pineapple to the mix.  Tasty, but only once.  Then it loses its appeal, and I feel sorry for the guy who gets stuck on Pineapple Duty for each service.  The red meats were about equal, though aside from the charred outside, some of my cuts were not-hot on the inside.  Like I worried if they hit the proper internal temperature.  Oh, and one random standout was some pork crusted in Parmesan cheese. But there were so few options.  It's like half of the menu listed on the website either didn't exist or was simply ""not on the lunch menu"" because we didn't see any ribs, no lamb-chops, and just a few beef dishes circulating around. So maybe my meal wouldn't have sucked so much if we'd gone for dinner instead - but I refuse to pay THAT MUCH just for eating at a different time of the day just because at some hour, all of the GOOD food is allowed to be cooked and served. Fogo de Chao has seemingly NO difference between lunch and dinner service - so if you want to compete as a Churrascaria, why don't you follow suit, Brazzaz? And while you're at it, hire someone to redesign your website and update it to be correct and warn people of all the things you refuse to serve them until 5pm at double the price. Last straw was my mentioning to the server (when I could flag her down) that it was my girl's birthday we were celebrating.  Her response was - we don't do anything complimentary but I could bring a dessert tray by so she could pick a dessert and I'll write ""Happy Birthday"" on it. No thanks.  Bye.",0.9957,0.791,0.129,0.08,0.48211336336336374
2010-01-12,3.0,"The meat was mostly OK, a few of the offerings were a bit overcooked. The staff are attentive and polite. Our waiter talked so fast that we couldn't understand what he was saying and there was a mis-communication about getting plates. That guy basically just judged us the whole evening.  Since the waiters are trained to offer you something every time you turn that chip over, it ends up that a lot of people are standing around the room staring at you while you eat. When we got there it wasn't crowded at all so that might have been part of it. I only drank ice tea and had a coffee after eating and it was $60, which I think is too much to spend - even for endless meat. Part of the problem is if you have, say, three pieces of meat on your plate you can either keep getting more meat (which means your three pieces go cold) or you can just eat those three, which are either very thinly cut strips or two-bite kabob-style servings, so if you eat them you have to flip your chip over again and again to feel like you're getting your money's worth. Eating those little slivers of meat doesn't feel satisfying at all, though, and it's kind of like eating endless samples but never getting to tear into any real meaty goodness.  I'm not a fan of having people hover over me at all, much less when I'm trying to have a conversation with friends and eat. The food was really only just OK, and overall I don't think it's worth the money.

Chef Max has developed a little Churrascaria scorecard with the following attributes: 1) Quality of Meat 2) Selection of Meat 3) Seasoning of Meat 4) Frequency of Visits 5) Salad Bar Selection 6) Desserts Here's how Brazzaz scores: Quality of Meat- B-  I'm judging by marbling, texture, and flavor. The meats here were a little lean, tough, and modest in flavor. Selection of Meat- B  Brazzaz does have a respectable selection, but nothing blew me away. Seasoning of Meat- B-  This is where some proper seasoning can go a long way---especially when the meat quality is average. Unfortunately, the seasoning was inconsistent and often bland. Frequency of Visits- A-  At Brazzaz, they know what you came for and that is beef, beef, and more beef. The servers come frequently to your table with smiles on their faces. In fact, you'd think they had bonuses tied to how much beef they can convince you to eat. Salad Bar Selection- B  Okay. If you are foolish enough to waste your appetite on anything uncooked, then you really need to rethink your strategy. The salad bar at a churrascaria is like having a gorgeous hotel room in Vegas. It's nice, but you are probably not going to be spending much time in it. Yeah, I guess the salad bar is decent; not that I would know...=) Desserts- C+ If you actually have room for dessert, then you need to email me your secret at  MaxisaPig@gmail.com  (not a real email address). I could tell that I wasn't missing too much from the dessert cart; mostly Casino/Cruise Ship Buffet type desserts. If you live in River North or the downtown vicinity, then you probably get the BOGO deal from Brazzaz. That coupon makes this place a worthy visit.

However, in the Chicago area I would have to say, Brazzaz is my favorite churascaria in town. I've been to Texas de Brazil and Fogo de Chao, but sometimes they seriously oversalt the meat. Like I tell all my friends, if you ever go to the churascaria make sure to order a some guarana soda! it's my favorite drink in the whole wide world.. you won't regret it!

2009-12-20,5.0,"I've visited all the Brazilian steakhouses down in Chicago other than Zed 451 (Texas de Brazil, Fogo de Chao and Brazzaz), and I have to say out of those 3 that Brazzaz takes the plate.  On the overall, the primary reason for this is really the salad bar that they have. I know that a Brazilian steakhouse is supposed to be all about the meat, but myself, I enjoy a little variety in the food I'm going to eat. Out of the 3, Brazzaz has by far the best salad bar. Fogo is overloaded with gigantic pieces of vegetables and that is about all it really has. Even someone who loves vegetables more than meat, like my fiancee, was not terribly impressed by Fogo's salad bar. Brazzaz has a wide array of food on their bar, my favorite by far being their tortellini and their wide variety of thin sliced meats (prosecutor etc.).  I'd say when it comes to the meat itself, that Fogo probably has the other two beat. They have simply the most amazing lamb chops I've ever had in my life. Brazzaz however is very competitive in pretty much every other category on the meat menu. The only place I had a major disconnect was really on the lamb chops.  The best meat that Brazzaz has to offer is either their sausage or their bacon wrapped chicken. Both make your mouth water and keep you coming back for more.  A few quick tips on my end, avoid shoving boatloads of the cheese puffs down your throat at the start of your meal. Although these things are delicious, they fill your stomach and don't allow you to try all the meat. The servers also tend to bring around a bottle of Brazilian liquor. The bottle itself is beautiful and covered in pineapples, avoid this at all costs in my opinion. It ends up running you 9 dollars a piece or so for a shot of it, and I had to MUSCLE it down after already splitting a bottle of wine.  Do partake in the garlic mashed potatoes and the fried plantains!  The plantains are great for cleansing your palette between meats. All in all, a great place for a date or a group. Just watch the damage it can do to your wallet. Keep an eye on your mail and get a 2 for 1 dinner or lunch. If you can catch it at lunch it costs 20 bucks instead of 50 a person which is a great deal. Keep in mind they do serve fewer meats than they do at dinner, but it's still well worth while.",0.9971,0.809,0.16,0.031,0.5237811791383221
2009-12-17,3.0,"Sorry, Brazzaz, Texas de Brazil is better. We arrived promptly at 5 p.m. on a Wednesday - that's when their doors open.  And yet, despite the restaurant being 97% empty, the hostess had us wait five minutes for a seat.  I think it was just a power-play on her part. We sat down and got the green light for the salad bar, which was good, but not great.    And honestly, when I hit Brazilian steakhouses, I'm not looking to load up on sushi, cold chicken and whatnot.  But since we were there right when they opened, the Meat Cowboys were nowhere to be seen.  I made my obligatory trip up to Saladville. Eventually, I started to see the meat making its rounds and I flipped my disc to let the Meat Bearers know it was time to take down some animals.  The food was good, but a lot of the meat was very fatty.  I flashed back to my two visits to Texas de Brazil and recalled that wasn't the case with them.  But the meat at Brazzaz seemed to miss the mark. Something I did prefer about Brazzaz was that they'd bring mashed potatoes and rice directly to your table, along with the customary banana for pallet cleaning.  It's nice to have an array of sides within arm's reach.  At TdB, you can get rice, but it's up at the salad bar. Unfortunately, we were in a rush to hurry out of there, so I didn't get a chance to sample everything on their menu, but from the seven or eight meats that were brought 'round, I was pleased, just not impressed. Brazzaz is a nice place to go - it looks nice - it feels nice - the food is nice.  But if you really want a ""wow"" experience, hoof it to Texas de Brazil.   Brazzaz is like the WNBA, while Texas de Brazil is the NBA All-Star Game.",0.9463,0.829,0.108,0.063,0.6777830687830687

2009-11-16,4.0,"Is it wrong to thank all the animals for being so delicious? I forgot how many times I swapped out for a clean plate, but near the end of the meal, I was in slow motion, trying extremely hard to keep the food down and slowly motioning the last piece of meat into my mouth with an irregular breathing pattern.  It was a struggle, and I had a small bit of regret for eating all that meat...but that was short lived. The service was top notch.  If I left my napkin on the table, the waiter would come by and put it on my lap.  Water refills were plentiful and the refills of bread and side dishes never stopped...even when we told them to stop.  They kept on coming and we kept on eating.  The salad bar wasn't exactly a salad bar.  Offering items such as prosciutto, fancy cheeses, seared ahi tuna, and even raw oysters, to call the salad bar a salad bar is downright offensive. The rate of the amount of meat that was coming out of the kitchen was impressive.  Just when I was about to bite down on a juicy morsel of filet Mignon, another person was at my side asking if I wanted bacon wrapped chicken, and if it wasn't that, it was one of the 16 cuts of meat available that night.  The only way to stop the onslaught was to flip the meat token over to the ""No thanks"" side right after being served.  Lamb, chicken, beef, shrimp, and pork were all up for grabs, but I was disappointed that other types of meat weren't represented.  At the last churrascaria that I went to, the types of meat extended to that of frog legs and rabbit.  Oh well, I guess we can't have it all.  Brazzaz even had grilled pineapple, which is cooked just above the meat.     Although I have been praising this place, it wasn't without disappointments.  I was all hyped up for the bacon wrapped filet mignon, but it turned out to be extremely overcooked and dry.  The bacon wrapped chicken breast on the other hand? Simply delicious.  The lamb chops looked great, but were overcooked as well.  I like a bit of pink in a lamb chop, but these were cooked through entirely.   The free bread was delicious.  Bite sized, warm, fluffy, and chewy...and the most impressive part?  No butter required, this stuff stood out on it's own!  Even the side dishes that came with the meal held up on their own rather well.  The fried bananas stood out from the creamed spinach and mashed potatoes. I forgot how many of those we went through. Great place and great ambiance, although it should be illegal to eat that much meat.",0.993,0.771,0.152,0.077,0.5765006105006105

My only real problem was this; you know those little tip guide charts that some restaurants provide at the bottom of your check? This one suggested I tip based on the amount post-coupon.

While they tried to seat us right away, we wandered off to the bar where I had a weak mojito.  It didn't take us long to get seated and we immediately hit the salad bar. I really loved their signature wild mushroom & truffle risotto. It was so rich, creamy, and delicious! They had a very interesting spread of food for their buffet, from oysters on the half shell to sushi to a variety of cheeses. I also love artichoke hearts!  Once we sat down, the served us these little flaky rolls with a really soft and gooey center. They were so delicious that I could eat them all night. I didn't think it was cheese inside but I guess it was! It was always so gooey even when cold and just didn't taste like cheese to me.

I am a big fan of five course meals and at Brazzaz those courses are: meat, meat, meat, meat, and dessert.  Did I mention the meat course? Oh yeah, there's a salad bar too.  Lots of good things here: sushi, fresh deli meats, veggies (don't pass on the sesame green beans!), pasta, and, of course, salad.  Try a little of your favorites but don't lose sight on why you're here: the meat. Flip your token and begin salivating.  Sausages, chicken, top sirloin, botton sirloin, filet, rib eye, beef ribs, pork ribs, breaded pork, and grilled pineapple make your mouth think it's Christmas time for the tastebuds.  And it is, my friend, it is.  Don't kid yourself, though, although there is a large variety of meats, not everything is as good as it seems.  Make sure you take small portions and try EVERYTHING.  Sometimes the breaded pork is moist and tender, other times, not so much.  The chicken legs juicy but sometimes dry.  Sirloin rare or sometimes well.  No matter what, there is always a good selection of meats prepared properly and served promptly. If you take anything away from this review, please, and I beg you, please remember you can ask you server for anything.  Not seeing a meat you like?  Ask your server or a Gaucho (they guys with the meat).  Meat not prepared the way you like?  Tell the Gaucho and they will make sure they bring you your desired choice next time.  Bottom line, ask and you shall receive. We always get dessert here.  There's never room but we always get it.  Why?  Because it's creme brulee, that's why.  Not only is it prepared to perfection with just the right amount of even browning and crispy shell but they also add fresh berries or banana.  It's a must.  Don't worry about saving room as it is so delicious and cooperative it just finds its own room.

2009-08-14,4.0,Of the guacho steak places in Chicago I like this one best. I've been to all of them and I'll give it slight edge. For one I just like the atmosphere. Its open with a lot of windows and that makes the difference for some reason. Second the mushroom rissoto is SO good. Wow . I mean really good. Probably the best thing they make.

2009-08-07,4.0,"Went here for lunch for a friend's birthday on a Friday. It opens at 11 and we were there before the crowds. There's free valet (at least in summer 2009) during lunch. The meats started slow but once the crowds built up, they actually came faster. I haven't been here for dinner, so not sure what was missing but the variety of meats seemed more than sufficient. The rump roast and pork ribs were my favorite. Some of the other beef steaks were a bit dry. The waiters are attentive though sometimes a little more intrusive than I'd like. Overall, a great value for lunch at $20 + tax and tip. On a side note, you go here for the meat, but their salad bar is definitely less extensive than Fogo (or Rei do Gado in San Diego). There is zero fruit and very little seafood (just some smoked salmon). They do, however, serve this delicious cheese bread and fried bananas. However, don't fill up on this stuff.

I usually end up eating too much from the salad bar and not leaving enough room for meat, but that's ok because there's only so much meat I can eat without having something else to wash it down with. My favorite meat selections are the top sirloin, the filet wrapped in bacon, and the chicken wrapped in bacon, you just can't go wrong when meat is wrapped in more meat! Also love the cooked pineapple. Salad bar has great deli meats, cheeses, olives, garlic, salads, etc...  You really can't beat the lunch price-$20 for all the meat you can eat and anything you want from the salad bar. And valet is FREE during lunch! Haven't been here for dinner yet because I can't afford their dinner prices, but they have some added selections including lobster and shrimp for dinner. Service is friendly--the gauchos who bring you the meat are super friendly and love to please, all you have to do is look at them and they come running to you. Frankly, they should get rid of the waiters, I'd rather tip the gauchos directly. I've had more than one pushy waiter there who tried to get us to order drinks or dessert or something else on top of the lunch buffet.

I had a bit of the few cuts and all were mouth watering... as funny as this sounds, even the bread on the table was insane.. kind of a croissant meets cheese danish mixture...

Damn, I'm a sucker for coupons.  But I digress. Brazzaz is a cool place. If you love meat, you'll feel right at home. The tables are a little small and close together, but I'll let that slide. The more the merrier. I really enjoy the salad bar here. That mushroom risotto makes me very happy. But be careful, don't fill up on the salad bar. I made that mistake the first time I went. You can have salad anytime, but how often do you have over 15 cuts of meat carved right onto your plate? The sides are also very good. The fried bananas...mashed potatoes...creamed spinach *thumbs up* I'd say all of the meat is pretty good. The problem is, everything will taste different every time...kinda depends on who's cooking everything. Sometimes the food has been amazing, others it has been just ok. But one of the things that pushed this over the top to a 4 star review is that I had the most delicious lamb chop I have ever had in my life here. It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and damn near orgasmic. I still think about it from time to time.

So, I could not have been more excited when I saw the 2 for 1 coupon. I booked my reservation the next day.  Wanting to make as much room as possible for what I knew was going to be an immense about of food, I refrained from eating the entire day. When we got their we vowed not to indulge too heavily in the salad bar or on the bread. However, let me just say. They make this almost impossible to do! The servers instantly bring you a piping hot basket of delicious cheese filled popovers. They melted in your mouth and made you want to just keep eating until you were stuffed. I had 2, my date managed to keep it to 1.  Then the salad bar. MMM...everything was ridiculously fresh and enticing. I succumbed to the temptation of my favorite fresh mozzarella salad with tomato and balsamic. I went for some fresh veggies, some cheese, and also delicious seared tuna. I typically hate buffet style food, but this I could have kept eating.  As we worked through our salad bar choices, the servers brought us some delicious side dishes. Mashed potatoes, creamed spinach and fried bananas. The bananas could very well have been the highlight of my night - crispy and not too greasy, warm and comforting, yet somehow the banana stayed firm and fresh and not over cooked. Then the meat round. I was instantly overwhelmed as soon as we turned our orange chip over. Server after server with dripping juicy meat offerings came by. I wanted to try everything but found myself scarfing and not really appreciating it. I quickly turned my chip back to the ""stop"" indicator. Sticking with red meat, the bottom sirloin was mouthwatering, flavorful and perfectly cooked. The beef tenderloin was also good but not as flavorful and tended to be a little more cooked than I liked. After sampling most of the meats, I was impressed with the sirloin and rib eye. Despite my craving for red meat, the skewered shrimp did me in. We requested shrimp 3 or 4 times. Finally we ended with the rack of lamb which was not as good but that could have been a result of the mass quantity of food I had already taken in. So we stopped, ordered coffee and ended with the molten chocolate cake for dessert. Everything sounded amazing, but I'm glad we ordered this option. Took about 15 minutes to prep, so our food got to settle and I got to relax and enjoy what I had just done! The coffee was delicious, and the molten cake was as good as any i've had.

2009-05-01,5.0,"As part of my efforts to try all 3 Brazilian Steakhouses in 2009 (Texas de Brazil, Brazzaz, and Fogo de Chao), I found myself in possession of a coupon for a two for one deal (which is basically the only way normal people can afford a place like this, and even then it's kind of expensive) and felt compelled to try it out. The basics of the concept are simple: you go to the expansive salad bar first, which includes items like proscuitto, ceviche, raw oysters, and sushi, and when you're ready for the waiters, called gauchos, to bring the meat around you flip over a chip from the side that says ""No Thanks"" to the side that says ""Yes Please"". The gauchos bring around as much meat as you want and load it onto your plate until you've had enough and are literally drunk on meat, and then you leave. Now, the lynchpin that divides a place like Brazzaz from Ponderosa is a combination of ambiance and excellence. The hosts and hostesses are there to serve your every meat-related whim. Whatever you want, they get, or have sent over. Because the concept of the churrascaria is pretty universal, it's fair to compare Brazzaz to it's competitors. It's certainly a great experience, and really an excellent time. The decor is very upscale. However, when it comes to meat, it's just a bit lacking compared to Texas de Brazil. There is more variety, of that there is no question. The shrimp in particular were excellent, as was the pineapple. However, if you're going to pitch yourself as an all you can eat meat extravaganza, then your meat had better be top notch. Brazzaz certainly had some high points; the pork tenderloin was excellent. But for every great meat we were served, it felt like there was one that wasn't so great. Moreover, the salad bar, although excellent, didn't compare to TdB's salad bar, sushi chef, and lobster bisque. As I said, Brazzaz was a great place to eat. It was a great experience. It just wasn't quite as good as it could have been.",0.9964,0.775,0.195,0.03,0.6342742673992674
2009-04-28,3.0,"Nice modern space, but the location is tourist central. Lots of conventioneers and people from the nearby hotels debating between trying Brazzaz, Chili's (the excitement, how exotic) or Melting Pot (who can handle all that congealed melted cheese?) Well it looks like on a rainy night they all decided to head out to Brazzaz with me. Why are you asking did I go? Well I had a buy one get one free dinner coupon (can't stand to let a good coupon go to waste) and I was in the mood for some serious meat-eating. The space is modern and larger than it looks from the street. As another Yelper had mentioned though, the tables are really close together making the gaucho's job with those huge slabs of meat that much more difficult. The salad bar is centrally located though allowing easy access to get up and snack, that is if you're actually able to get up. I really enjoyed the salad bar. I don't think it compares to the variety of hot & cold items offered at Fogo de Chao, but it was all very fresh and impressive in its own right. There were 2 green salad options, pasta salad, tomatoes with mozzarella, asparagus, salty green beans, sushi (actually pretty decent), oysters, sauteed baby portobellos, broccoli, creamy mushroom risotto (went back for seconds - it had SO much heavy cream in it), tortellini pasta salad, artichoke hearts and a variety of some decent charcuterie options. I tried to get a lot of green so I felt ""healthy"" before I gorged myself on meat. So when you're ready you tentatively flip over your little button ""Yes More Please!"" and you're swarmed by gauchos with a wealth of meat. I had seconds on the lamb, sauteed shrimp, filet wrapped in bacon and pineapple (ok I had 4ths on the pineapple, but its ""healthy"") The filet mignon on its own was a bit bland. Come to think of it I enjoyed the rib as well - it had a little bit of sauce but I felt slightly self conscious grabbing that sucker and eating it with my hands. Who can still be hungry for dessert after this wealth of meat you ask? Well if you are, save what little money you have left in your pocket and head somewhere else. These desserts are bland. Overall a fun experience. If I'm in the mood for Meat Madness takes on Robyn T. #2 though I'll probably head to Fogo de Chao. Coupon or no coupon. Maybe I'll head back here in 5 years when I get another coupon. Until then I'm stickin' with the veggies.",0.9968,0.793,0.17,0.037,0.5534780578898226

I prefer my meat to be cooked medium rare. Majority of what was offered was cooked medium to well done. For me, it doesn't matter what cut of meat you bring, if it's cooked medium to well done it's a waste! There were a few selections of medium rare and they were very good. Great seasonings to give a delicious and slightly smokey flavor.  The other star was removed for the long lull in between meat offerings. Each of the offerings were brought out simultaneously. Then, there wasn't any for a noticeable period of time. I guess we could have revisited the salad bar, but we were there for the meat.  The buffet was very good. The oysters definitely help makeup for the lack of medium rare meat.  The service was great and overall we really enjoyed our experience.

2009-03-27,2.0,"Edit: On rare occasions I am wrong in my reviewing, and while the bulk of this review still stands for that visit, we received a 2-for-1 coupon to visit Brazzaz and decided to try it out again at the dinner hour, hoping the staff would be better and food of a high quality. While we would not dine there without a 2-for-1 (why pay the same price as Fogo and get less?), it was a fine experience. Our waitress was incredibly helpful, polite and friendly. The food was better quality (esp. the salad bar, which was stocked with a very impressive spread, including sushi and oysters, if you're a seafood fan). Over all, we enjoyed our meal, and I knocked Brazzaz up a little bit. That doesn't erase the terrible experience we had before, and since there is no way of knowing if dinner was a fluke or our first experience was the fluke, I will leave both and let the reader decide.. So far, this has been our worst dining experience in Chicago. As huge fans of Fogo de Chao, we thought we'd try Brazzaz, as it's a little closer. At first we were impressed by the salad bar selections (the tortellini was good), but the service promptly removed any goodwill we had for this place.  We were there around 1:30pm, so the place was not that crowded, yet it took almost 30 minutes to get our drink from the bar. We had to ask for our sides, and none of the waiters that were wandering around, doing basically nothing, bothered to bring us any extra plates. We just piled our meat on top of our salad bar items.  When we did ask for our sides, it seemed as if the waiters were slightly annoyed by the audacity to request what we were paying for.  The meat itself, which should be the centerpiece of the meal, was nothing special. In fact, the majority of the beef I was served was fat. I had a rather large pile of fat that I trimmed off my cuts at the end of the meal. The pork was dry to the point that I didn't finish eating it. There was some tasty garlic-flavored lamb, but the meat was far, far below the quality one would expect for a $50 meal. To cap the experience off,  we had problems with their inability to properly ring the credit card, and even then we had to wait an extremely long amount of time to get anyone to come to our table to pick up the card the second time around. My guest actually had to leave the table to find someone to take it.  All in all, if you're going to drop $50+ on lunch (or more for dinner), you deserve top quality product AND service.

2009-03-19,3.0,"I'm always hesistant to write reviews on a place that has already 100+ reviews, however I think I'll have to chime in that I disagree with the ratings this place has received thus far. Overall design:  The layout of this restaurant is made so that you can fit more people into the space, as opposed to allowing for the gauchos to efficiently move through the room to provide service to all.  This means there are nooks/crannies/stairs/non-standard paths that the gauchos must follow in order to reach customers, which prevent efficient service.  Instead of being bombarded by meat when we had flipped our coin to ""yes please"", we ended up looking around attempting to flag someone down.  Poor restaurant layout. Salad Bar:  Not as plentiful in terms of selection as Fogo (my only Brazilian comparison), however the dishes were tasty nonetheless.  While risotto texture is definitely a personal preference, the two batches I had here had way too much cheese and didn't have the natural starchiness of appropriately prepared risotto... someone cheated and through in a lot of butter/cheese at the end IMHO.  Fairly limited set of chatucurie, but decent.  Overall, average salad bar but not as good as Fogo's. Sides:  The airy bread (popovers?) were tasty as always.  Garlic mashed potatoes were decent.  Fried banana was pretty good (what isn't good when it's coated and deepfried?), however fiancee was more of a fan of Fogo's banana/plaintain side. Meats:  Pretty good overall... the rack of lamb had a very strong lamb flavor to it, so if you're not used to that, start with one piece so you don't waste the rest.  Leg of lamb was seasoned better and the flavor was more masked.  Steaks overall were good, however some of the gauchos didn't quite seem to know where to cut from when I asked for a medium rare and ended up receiving well done.  Every filet mignon piece we had was at best medium well, at worst well done.  While still tender (it's hard to lose the tenderness of filet mignon), it was felt wasteful to cook it that thoroughly... While I personally am a medium rare kinda guy, something as subtle and good as filet at most should be medium... and these were well overcooked. Desserts:  The first set of pineapples we received were so close to the core that there was no grilled/caramel flavors, and extremely chewy.  The second time around, the pineapple was warm, smoky, lightly sugary, and lush... perfectly done.  It's a shame that the gauchos are likely told to serve the pineapples as far down as possible and people end up with the core area...  The papaya cream was an excellent dessert, with more cream than papapya honestly.  It was like eating melted ice cream, however still tasty nonetheless.  The caramelized flan was also excellent, and worth trying if you're a flan fan. Customer service:  Gauchos were fine, some more enthusiastic than others (the guy with the bottom sirloin went to every table and let them know ""This is my favooorite... it is soo good, you'll want me to come back"") while others seemed to lack some knowledge of where to cut for different levels of doneness.  Our waiter seemed awfully disdainful when we decided not to order drinks and we brought out our buy one dinner get one free coupon, but chipped up on our way out after the generous tip.  He did bring by a free flan with the words ""Congratulations"" piped onto the plate to congratulate my fiancee on finishing boards.  Classy! Verdict:  Both my fiancee and I had concerns as we were sat into a nook/cranny area that was out of the way of the gauchos/waiters, and we were appropriately concerned.  Service was not nearly as efficient and attentive as Fogo, but I blame the layout/design of the restaurant in their attempts to fit as many tables as possible in.   As a heads up, even with the coupon, our bill came out to $90 after tax and tip, so while there is a good amount of savings, it's still far from a ""cheap meal"".    Fogo is better for your money, and we likely won't be back for dinner without a coupon for buy one get one free.",0.9973,0.758,0.165,0.077,0.5814215390797668

It was a nice restaurant, food was yummy.  But the service (in my opinion) is 50% of Fogo's and the place is too loud.  Which is sad- because it's a place where you go for a semi-drawn-out meal, not a quick bite to eat.",0.966,0.86,0.111,0.028,0.6531084656084657

Here comes the hate part.  I always overeat.  In a quest to get my money's worth, I tend to have several too many portions of meat.  The last two times I have gone now, I vowed to never go back for another 6 months.  Looks like I'm gonna keep this promise this time...  maybe.   Oh yeah, make sure you call ahead for reservations even on a seemingly offday.  We went on a Wednesday but there was a convention in town.  Even with the reservation we had to wait almost 10-15 minutes to be seated.  I talked with the hostess who told me they are NEVER this busy on a Wednesday and just got slammed.  But it was worth that small delay.",0.9843,0.789,0.171,0.039,0.48986625514403287

The staff were all very nice, but we went very long periods of time without being offered anything at all and having to really look around and try to find somebody with something - and when we found them they would always seem to have the same something, like they had lots of certain cuts they were definitely trying to push over the others.  My favorite things here weren't meat at all, but the roasted pineapple on the skewer and the risotto at the ""salad"" bar.  The risotto was mushroom and super creamy and perfect, but as good as it was, it was still disappointing that the meat wasn't the shining star.  And as much as I loved - loved - the pineapple, I was disappointed when I had to kind of haggle to be able to finish off my meal with it, because I was getting a hard sell on the desserts that you have to pay extra for instead. It was a decent enough meal, but it is overpriced for what you get.  If you've ever experienced the meat onslaught and incredible service at Fogo de Chao, though, this will come up far short in terms of the food and the experience.

2008-08-11,4.0,"Having lived just up the street from one of these Brazilian steak houses while still in Rhode Island, I have to admit I was surprised and disappointed when I got to Chicago and discovered that most (all?) of these types of establishments here are so shockingly expensive. We waited more than a year to go to Brazzaz even though my brother lives just upstairs simply because of the price. Granted, if you compare it to all the other, more traditional steak houses in the neighborhood, they are basically spot on as far as local market pricing, but then again, I think all those steak houses are totally over-priced as well. I don't care how exclusive you make your place seem to be, you're still serving me grilled beef and red wine. This is neither complicated, nor unusual, nor particularly expensive compared to other kinds of fine dining. I simply don't get why a ""good steak"" commands a $50 price tag, especially when so few of these places even use (or at least admit to using, let alone advertise using) free range, hormone free, cruelty free meats (which I understand are more expensive, and those I'd be willing to pay more, for). Frankly, I'll go to the butcher, get a cut for myself, cook it at home just as well (or better, in some cases) and save a big chunk of change. But now I'm off on a substantial tangent.  Brazzaz.  Buffet is fantastic. The tilapia salad, paired with their ""vinaigrette"" dressing formed a marvelously light, bright, intensely flavorful ceviche, which was delightful way to start a meal. They have an excellent selection of firm and hard cheeses, a few cured meats, as well as beautifully prepared green vegetables (long beans, broccoli and the like) and the usual suspects of chicken salad, pasta salad, cesaer salad et al. They also have a risotto, ravioli, tortellini, and a lasagna for those who want something hot aside from the carved meats.  Obviously, the meat is fantastic. The place wouldn't have full tables at these prices if it wasn't. The sausage was just a sausage (I mean, how great can a sausage really be?), I did not try either the chicken legs or bacon wrapped chicken, but I had at least a bite of everything else, and was not disappointed once. The filet mignon was literally fork tender. The various seasoned choices, such as the house special ""Brazilian beef"" are not over-salted and still taste like meat, instead of simply like a sauce or a rub or herbs, or blue cheese or some other craziness.  My wife is a vegetarian, and we mentioned this up front when we were seated. They simply removed her ""yes/no"" button and we received a nicely discounted price for her meal. The buffet is certainly diverse enough that you don't have to worry about abandoning any vegetarians you bring along to a night of ultra-expensive lettuce. The gouchos serving the meats are all enthusiastic without being weird, and are highly attentive to your ""yes/no"" button, which is nice. You don't feel intruded upon, and you don't feel neglected. They have this odd, post modern sculpture thing they give you for wine service so that you aren't struggling to avoid dripping wine on the nice table linens. But our server dripped on the initial pour, and with four of us sharing a single bottle, it was total over kill. We each had about two glasses at the most. Really unnecessary. But fun to look at and use, I guess.  We split two desserts between five people -- the flan and the tiramisu cake. The flan was truly excellent. Very dense, very smooth, and the caramelized syrup was intensely sweet. My brothers seemed quite pleased by the tiramisu. I was disappointed they didn't enforce -any- kind of a dress code at all. At $50 a plate, I don't want to be next to some unshaven schmuck wearing cargo shorts, flip flops and a US Army tee shirt. I don't want to deal with spoiled, petulant children running into me on their Heelies while reading their iPhone on their way to the buffet.  And the -awful- music selection was far too loud and utterly did not fit the high end dining experience they seem to want to create.  I would say that if you don't care about ambiance or your dining neighbors, and you'd rather spend your $50 plate dinner money on a diverse, elaborate experience instead of on a single piece of excellent beef, than Brazzaz is a no brainer. But, as much as I loved this food, if I am going to drop this kind of money on a meal, I would much rather go somewhere quieter, with a dress code, and a menu which could easily be just as diverse without all the gimmicky service.",0.9986,0.742,0.184,0.074,0.6196844660194173

2008-07-30,4.0,"I give Brazzaz 4 stars overall.  First, they have the best corkage price of the Brazilian Steakhouses at $20/bottle.  While they did amend it sometime last year to only allow corkage on bottles NOT on their list, since they don't have a list actually posted online, it should be pretty easy to complain your way out of it.  However, they may find other ways to tell you to go f*** yourself and not come back.  Last time I went was with 2 friends to celebrate a birthday and I brought a magnum (1.5L) of Duckhorn and while I emailed one of the managers ahead of time that I'd be bringing this (since I knew it was on their list) which he said was fine, another manager came to our table once we got there to tell us that it was illegal for them to open a bottle that large for only 3 people because it was too much alcohol to serve at one time, but they had already opened it so they would flaunt the law in this instance.  While this is technically the law (as was explained to me while I was golfing with a manager from Wildfire), managers have discretion in applying it.  It was the first time I had encountered this and it was really a way of them telling me to piss off with my wine in the future. The best thing about Brazzaz by far is the shrimp and they love sending out Buy One-Get One coupons a few times a year (although the limits on them have increased a lot the last couple years). Overall, I give them 4 stars for their awesome shrimp, cheap corkage (although occasionally problematic), and high number of coupons.  However, after my last experience with that manager, I'm only planning on going when I have coupons and certificates in hand so I can put another dent or two in their bottom line!",0.9836,0.86,0.117,0.023,0.4078860028860028

Now to the meats.  We tried our best to sample every meat offered on the menu.   Here is my review: Coulette - Very, very flavorful.  My boyfriend really liked the pot roast and had a second offering. Top Sirloin/Bottom Sirloin - Both were excellent but I think I liked the top sirloin slightly better. Filet Mignon - Very good. It did not disappoint! Rack of Lamb - I was very sad I did not like the lamb chops here.  I usually like lamb chops and had a great experience with lamb chops at Fogo.  I was really looking forward to trying the lamb chops here too. Lamb - I did not like the lamb here either.  I'm use to lamb having an after taste but this time it was too strong for me to enjoy.   Beef Ribs - Extremely tender but a tad bit too salty. Garlic Beef Coulette - It was alright.  I didn't think it really stood out to me. Pork Tenderloin - It came covered in parmesan cheese which was tasty. Ribeye - Very tender and juicy. Bacon Filet Mignon - This is probably my favorite meat here.  The filet wrapped in bacon gives it the perfect flavor combination. Bacon Chicken Breast - I'm not big on chicken when eating at a steakhouse and felt it was a waste of stomach space. Chicken - The same as above.  Nothing special. Pineapple - I never knew how much I would appreciate a pineapple until eating meat after meat after meat.  The pineapple was great to eat between like you would eat ginger between sushi pieces. Shrimp - Also very good and deserving of a second offering. The fried bananas side dish was delicious.  We also ordered the flan for dessert and it was superb. The servers were extremely accommodating and made sure we got to try everything at least once.  I think my boyfriend and I left eating a week's worth of meat and probably won't be eating meat anytime soon.",0.9972,0.751,0.201,0.048,0.5662913359788361
2008-07-03,3.0,"This is the only Churrascaria I've tried in Chicago, so I can't compare it to any others. And while I can't say it's not worth 50 bucks for dinner -- hell, calculate the price by the pound! -- it's not my favorite style of dining. The Brazilian steakhouse is like Medieval Times for the upscale set. It's more gimmick than dinner. The goal is to see how much meat you can shove down your hole before you explode. This might make sense if you were riding the range all day, but if the closest you come to the range is Dearborn Street, you may be overdoing it. I'll agree with those who find the food under-seasoned here. This was even true of the items on the salad bar. I'm not surprised, considering that the goal of a place like this is mass appeal. And that may explain why my favorite offering was the sausage. The chicken thighs and garlic beef were good, but a lot of the rest tasted the same. And I was disappointed that the lamb chops came by once, and then never put in another appearance. Drinks are very pricey, which is to be expected from a place which is giving away the house. So somehow, even with a half-off coupon, I spent nearly 50 bucks for dinner, one cocktail and dessert. Before tip. I'm glad I came, and the company made it worthwhile. But I'm not likely to be back soon. And certainly not without a coupon.",0.9446,0.835,0.109,0.056,0.5363181504485853

Throw another $25 on there if I was paying regular price and that's a good 85 bones dog. And I didn't even have dessert. Not that I physically would have been able to, but I'm just saying.  That's the problem with these places. You try to get your money's worth, and you end up checking into the hospital with a case of meat poisoning. Then you get flowers sent to your room and junk, and you have to write all these thank you letters.  Sucks. P.S. Disregard my friend Vamsi's sentiment on the chicken up there.

2008-07-03,3.0,"So, I am the culprit behind John, Amy, Matt and Dane's reviews. Yes, you may mock me now! Lots of meat. Not every meat is good, but there is lots of it.  I have never been to a Churrascaria before Brazzaz and I cannot compare it to the others. I had 2 for 1 coupons and decided to invite fellow Yelpers for a meat fest. After all, who doesn't love meat? (Yes, I am looking at you Deanna... I mean, vegetarians... with a scorn). I had a glass of wine at the bar before heading to our table... the Sauvignon Blanc was OK. We were seated on adjacent tables. John kept waving at us from 10 feet away while Amy and Joe quietly scanned the meat descriptions. Matt was slurping on his Ketel dirty martini like the usual slurpees he gets at the neighborhood 7/11.  I ordered a mojito which was made with Reposado... interesting. A mojito made with Tequila. It was good though. The best part of the meal was the popovers served at the table. They were finger licking good.... better than any meat that was served. The fried plantains were OK. Tasted better after I put some chimichurri sauce on them We started with the salad bar. It is not  a full scale salad bar with a large variety of leaves and fruits, but a good variety nonetheless. Being the carnivore that I am, I skipped the green looking things and went straight to the cured meats and cheese section. Got a few pieces of prosciutto and proceeded to the other side where there is sea food. They have a shrimp salad and ceviche besides raw oysters. The shrimp in shrimp salad was tough and chewy (overcooked?), the ceviche was not bad and the oysters were good. I love raw oysters and I later commissioned Matt to get some for me. Being in a tipsy state, he obliged without protest.  Next came the meats. And the gauchos. Interesting outfits. I want those boots for the winter. They look like they will keep your feet warm during Chicago winters. Oh yeah, the food. I started with garlic steak, rib eye, flank steak, and tenderloin. Unfortunately, they all tasted the same... except for the garlic steak. It was too salty for my taste. The tenderloin was the better choice of all the beef items. I then got the shrimp. The shrimp were better than the beef. Well marinated and tasty.  I then moved on to lamb. The lamb chops were the highlight of the dinner. I may be biased here because lamb is my favorite red meat. The lamb chops were juicy and delicious. So was the leg of lamb (I got a slice of it). I saw pictures of bacon wrapped chicken in the meat menu and we waited forever to get that. When we finally got it, it was just OK. The chicken was overcooked but bacon makes everything taste better.  I ordered two desserts (because that is how I roll). Warm chocolate cake and the chocolate mousse. The warm chocolate cake had a molten core but it was not warm. It was room temperature. That's OK for me. The chocolate mousse was very good, except for the Reddi Whip on top (seriously, why would anyone put the fake whip cream on top of a good dessert?). I scooped the whip cream away and ate the mousse.  Towards the end, I was beyond full. We all ate a lot and I was on the verge of going in to a meat coma. I kept trying different meats and it added up quickly. I also felt really uncomfortable for the next 24 hours. It may have been the excess salt in the garlic steak or all the food I ate. Regardless, it was not a pretty feeling. Amy had a similar feeling when she complained she can feel a meat baby rolling around in her tummy. (we are going on a starvation diet after this experience) I'd say it is a good deal because we had the 2 for 1 coupons. It will not be my choice if I am paying the full price of $50. But, I had a lovely evening with fellow yelpers and that is definitely a plus.",0.9983,0.773,0.172,0.055,0.5443156470395277

First off, there is the ""salad bar"" which is really more of a buffet.  In addition to the salad options this salad bar contains oysters, hot pasta dishes, and various sauces for the upcoming onslaught of meat.  I didn't hate the salad bar.  There was a very yummy cold pasta salad that would have been good if I were at a picnic or a cafe for lunch, but I didn't come here to eat cold pasta salad.  Bring on the meat!!!   There's a lot of meat and I tried to sample as much as I could.  I liked the bottom sirloin and the bacon wrapped chicken, but everything else was terrible.  There was no spice or flavor to the meat.  If you have a good piece of meat you can get away with a little salt and pepper, but this was not good meat.  A lot of it was tough and chewy and after a while it all tasted the same.   What I hated most about this restaurant is that the server didn't even bring us plates.  We had to go to the salad bar and get our own plates.  It is my opinion that if a place is charging $50 for a meal they can at least give you a plate! What I liked most about this restaurant is the basket of hot mini popovers that they bring to the table.  I could have eaten every basket on every table.  SO GOOD!!  I also enjoyed the desserts.  The chocolate mousse was sinful!

Their salad bar was OK but it pales in comparison to Zed451, not even in the same league.

We were then introduced to the Sommelier.  I'm sorry, though he was completely friendly and accommodating, we had absolutely no idea what he said.  His accent was very thick and he spoke too quickly for us.  We experienced the same situation with the woman who ended up serving us.  We opted for an Australian Shiraz because it was safe and asked to have it poured into a decanter so that it could breathe.  As I was about to tip the glass to sip the wine, I noticed a floater in my glass. It had wings, was dark in color and had legs.  It was larger than a fruit fly but smaller than fly.  Either way I was completely grossed out and pointed it out to our server.  I kid you not, all she said was, ""Oh, you want another glass?"" I didn't know if my original glass was dirty, if the wine was dirty or if the decanter was dirty.  Yes, I'd like a new glass, but I would have preferred a replacement on all the above.  It really wasn't that big of a deal...so I accepted the new glass...I just expected a better response such as an apology. I had expected a little bit more from the salad bar.  They had raw oysters, sushi. smoked salmon, asparagus, cerviche, apple salad, cesar salad, potato salad, mixed greens, amazing mushroom risotto, lasagna, manicotti, aged cheeses, watery tortellini, capicola, mushrooms, fruit salad, prosciutto, salami, olives, rolls, and all the necessary vegetables, toppings, and dressing to complete a salad. Nothing was spectacular in taste and flavor except the risotto.  Just eh. Onto the meats... I am a huge meathead.  I prefer my meat bloody.  The majority of the meats that we sampled were overdone.  That makes me want to cry,  When meat is that overdone, it is hard to gauge the quality, and the texture is off-putting.  Everything was a little too dry, salty and chewy.  The shrimp were also over cooked.  Of all the things that we tasted, I preferred the Brazilian sausage, the roasted pineapple, the leg of lamb, chicken drumstick and the bacon wrapped filet. The leg of Lamb was the only cut of meat that we had that expelled blood.  I did not care for any of the other meats.  Do not bother with the ribs.  Disgusting.  It is overcooked, dry and missing any flavor, dry rub or sauce.  When we first arrived, the meat gauchos were passing our tables at a rapid pace...we could not keep up.  By 10pm..their appearance dwindled and only 4 were seen circulating the room. Other than the busboys constantly checking our water levels and whether we needed new plates, we were not  revisited by our server again until after we ordered dessert.  Our rolls, potatoes and bananas were never replenished or offered to be replenished.  We actually placed our dessert and dessert drink order with the Sommelier, because she did not return.  He tried to upsell us on the desserts, buy offering us a third if we chose 2.  There was no way that we could eat anymore.  We decided to share a chocolate mouse and a cheesecake.  After hearing that we were there to celebrate my birthday, he comped us on one of the desserts and was nice enough to decorate the dessert and sang Happy Birthday to me.  This is the second time that it has happened to me in a space of less than one week.  It's mortifying and I felt like a deer caught in headlights.   Our bill came to $400 after tax and tip.  Had I known that it would have been so expensive I would have certainly picked another restaurant that would be worth that amount of money.  I would have splurged and picked Tru.   1 star for the food. 2 stars for the Sommelier and the attentive busboys. Do not ever bring children here.  It would be way too expensive to be worth it. If you are dying to try a Brazilian Steakhouse, I would highly recommend Texas De Brazil over Brazzaz and Fogo De Chao.  Much better meat selections, variety of meat temps, and a much broader and better salad bar selection.",0.9874,0.85,0.095,0.055,0.5454108842964266

The salad bar has a nice variety. I had a caesar salad and a variety of vegetables. The asparagus looked really good, but it was huge and I was trying to pace myself so I skipped it. I also skipped the risotto and the tortellini, both of which I hear are amazing. After slowly eating that and giving my stomach some time to digest, I flipped over my token that said, ""Yes, please!"" Almost instantly someone appeared with meat. At times, they would swarm around our table with the meat, and no, I'm not exaggerating. (And yes, I quickly turned my token over to ""No, thank you!"") I thought it was all good. Some cuts were amazing. The one I was most disappointed with was the sausage and chicken leg. Unless you're a huge fan, send that server on his way! In addition to the salad bar and the meat walking around the room, there are sides on the table: mashed potatoes, cheese bread, and some kind of banana something. As a big fan of mashed potatoes, I have to say that these were amazing! The bread was good, but much too small. I didn't have the breaded banana, but I was told it was good.

Overall, experience was fair. Definitely not as good as Fogo. Service was attentive, salad bar was decent, and like others have mentioned the cheese tortellini and risotto were nice. The main reason everyone was there though, the meat, was defintely sub-par. All the meats tasted about the same with few exceptions (garlic steak and filet mignon stood out, though only because they actually had flavor and were hot). As others have mentioned, the meat seemed rather bland and I did find myself throwing salt on most of my meat. I must also note that most of the meat at Fogo is done medium-well and here they definitely erred on the side of rare, with red meat juice staining my plate for most of the meal. Also, the sides were not fresh, and as much as I loved the cheese bread at Fogo, the cheesebread here was just not hot or freshly baked and the fried polenta was stale as evidenced by its crisp as croutons texture.

My boss is awesome for taking us here. My roommate warned me before I went - she said skip the salad bar and just wait for the meat. I don't follow directions very well, and there were lots of delicious treats at the salad bar...I couldn't pass up a trip. The apple salad is phenomenal, there are so many giant (and beautiful!) veggies, and they have all of the ingredients for making your own little caprese salad (or just eat a bunch of mozzarella balls). Post-salad, my coworkers and I munched on fried bananas, polenta, and little fried rolls/puffs of bread while we sipped on champagne. We decided it was time to turn our little buttons over to the orange ""go"" side, and the meat just started showing up.  I tried every red meat available, the chicken, and the pineapple. I'm not really a pork person, but my coworkers loved the parmesan-crusted pork. I think the flank steak and the sirloin won out for best flavor, but everything was delicious. And pineapple goes with more things than you'd ever expect! The server places a small boat of sauces on the table, and I had a hard time deciding whether to use them - the meats are very tasty by themselves, but the sauces aren't so overwhelming, and they complement the meat nicely. The servers are excellent. They can spot a turned-over button from anywhere in the restaurant, and you will not have an empty plate if you don't want to. The guy with the flank steak is SO HAPPY to give you flank steak. He'll tell you every time that it's his favorite. Seriously, it made me happy FOR him that he got to be the flank steak guy, because he was just so into it, and then I ended up getting about 4 lbs of flank steak. The pineapple guy is great, too. He figured out that I was the one at our table that was going to get pineapple every time, even if my button was turned down, and he cracked a joke about getting me some pineapple to go. I don't actually know how I had room for dessert, but I guess my stomach just put up a white flag about 20 minutes in and didn't care how long I was going to keep going. The mango mousse is tasty but light, and it's got pretty pink stripes on the side (I think that was the deciding factor, actually).

2007-12-14,5.0,"My wife and I received $100 in gift cards for this Brazilian steakhouse  last Christmas. Being parents of 2 little kids with a busy life, we rarely have an opportunity to go out together to a fancy place. Having read nearly all of the 61 Yelp reviews for this place beforehand, I walked in more confused than anything.  Let me begin by dispelling some misconceptions I saw: 1. There are salt and pepper shakers on the tables. 2. The entire rotizio dinner is fixed price, regardless of how many pieces of meat you take. Now, about the restaurant. This is a very elegant place, with fancy square light fixtures and an unusual ridged waterfall cascading near the entrance. Brazilian pop music plays constantly in the background, though it's not too loud. The dinner is about $50 a person if you don't get alcohol or other extras. It begins with some side dishes of tiny cheese-filled rolls, mashed potatoes, fried polenta and fried bananas. The donut-hole sized rolls taste fluffy and light and I think they are fried. The polenta is awesome and tastes like the best fried corn bread I've ever had. And the bananas were very satisfying too.  Then you hit the salad bar next. Salad bar is an understatement for it. Besides salad items, they have oysters, calamari, sushi, pickled artichokes (great!), cheeses, sundried tomatoes, and a few hot items. The best thing in the salad bar is the mushroom risotto, which is thick and creamy. Pace yourself so you don't fill up on these too much because the main course is a carnivorous feast of 17 assorted cuts of meat. Waiters walk around the dining floor carrying cuts of beef, pork, lamb, chicken, shrimp, or sausages on large skewers. Every person has a token on their table approximately 2 inches round. Flip it to the orange side and they keep bringing meat to you. Flip it on the black side and they will not serve you. Let me sum up some of the cuts I had, but I can assure you I was physically incapable of trying all 17. Top sirloin and bottom sirloin - both seared to a slightly blackened exterior color with a salty crust and plenty of juicy pink in the middle Filet mignon - a bit dry, not one of my favorites Shrimp - long, meaty shrimp with a bit too much lemon-pepper seasoning. Brazilian sausages - not too spicy, just right for my taste like a good Italian sausage Bacon Filet mignon - much juicier than the regular filet mignon and with a nice contrast with the exterior wrapping. Pork with parmesian cheese - better than the filet mignon but still dry Roasted Pineapple - downright awesome, hot cooked pineapple. I had extra cuts of this when I could get no more meat down. In the end, I had no more room for desserts as I waddled out like a python that had just swallowed an entire calf. I figure I met and exceeded my USDA recommended daily allowance of fat, cholesterol, and sodium, but heck, it was worth it!",0.9883,0.856,0.106,0.038,0.4722342320702977

I was rather unimpressed with the quality of what I sampled here. I really only enjoyed a few cuts, and even at that, they weren't special enough to stand out in my mind, e.g., ""remember the filet at Brazzaz?!"" As for sides--the bananas, which I was really looking forward to, were a major disappointment. I'm quite sure they were standard bananas rather than plaintains, and frankly I think they would have been better presented raw. Brazzaz folds them in a flavorless egg-roll-type wrapper and plunges them in a deep fryer (it seems). Even run-of-the-mill bananas can be elevated with a little grilling, roasting, pan-frying--the point is to encourage some CARAMELIZATION. Without that, you might as well just microwave the fruit, because that would add about as much flavor as this deep frying method does. The polenta and mashed potatoes were less offensive, but didn't add anything to my meal.  On the up side, the little popover-type buns they served were a real gem--piping hot, buttery-cheesey-tasting, and somehow airy, light and tastily dense at the same time. And thank God for the roasted pineapple--I ate more of this than anything else. A pineapple lover, I really could not have been happier with this fruit. And if you have to eat here, be sure to have a caipirinha, because mine was fantastic. No comment on the salad bar, since all I did was glance in its direction. Decor and ambience are quite nice, and the service was excellent. Felt more VIP here than Fogo, but I'm starting to think that the large Brazilian steakhouse is more concerned with quantity than quality.

2007-11-12,4.0,"We came across this place walking toward another restaurant for Lunch so we decided to go in as they were offering a $19.99 for Lunch.  I had never been here before having only just moved here but was surprised at how fab it was I though for $19.99 when you say Lunch the dessert would be included, is that me being cheap?  I don't know.  However, you probably wouldn't have room for dessert. Seriously nice interior decor and great washrooms.  Did I mention washrooms are a thing for me, and this place had nice ones.  Also its enormous, I see now why they can get away with it being so enormous.  The concept is pretty cool, you fill up on the salad/veggie/starch bar which has a great range of cold salas, ham, salami, hot tortellini, pepper, asparagus stuff like that.  The thing I liked about the salad bar was that it was well ordered, there was no cross contamination and it was clean.  I hate those disgusting salad bars that everyone puts every spoon in.  So 5/5 for the salad/veggie bar for content and quality. The meat, oh my god it was fabulous.  Unlike some lardos reviewing this web site I had them cut off small slices every time they came to the table instead of over filling my plate and wasting the food :o)  SO I ate my greens, drank my cabernet which was overpriced but nice and had regular visits from our meat waiter.  I have real problems saying no to food but I decided quite early on that I didn't want to ruin the experience by eating too much so I probably made the right decision. I had some lamb, parmesan encrusted pork, beef, slices of some other meat.  I never got to see the chicken or fish strangely but I had had plenty by then. I went for lunch and all the meat was juicy and perfectly cooked for me.  No dryness or anything, just perfectly succulent meat on a stick sliced off to perfection onto my plate. For dessert I had a very thin slice of Carrot cake which was really bloody nice I have to say.   I adore carrot cake and this was by far one of the better ones.  However, I did not realise the dessert was not included as they did not give me a price list or menu for the desserts so that I think is very naughty. I had a glass of cabernet Sauvignon which at $12.99 was bloody expensive, it was a nice glass and I should have checked the price instead of just asking for something specific or just drinking the water.  I mean it was lunch time and I am no lush so the wine really wasn't necessary.  All that meat though gets you going. When our check came they forgot to add our $19.99 lunches so I called the waiter back to tell him he had undercharged us, so honest I am.  When I saw the $7.50 for the desserts i.e. $7.50 each I was a bit miffed but again I should have asked if dessert was included my fault I suppose.  So it cost 100 bucks for lunch for 2 which is actually quite expensive but then if you go here for dinner that $19.99 lunch will cost you $48.50.  It's also a lot more than I had initally wanted to pay.  If we had just had the lunch which was way more than enough and drank water you could have walked away with spending under $50 including tip. My tip, come here for Lunch unless you have money to burn or are just plain daft as its the same food, although not the same ambience. As usual for me the music was too loud but it was well chosen and quite listenable. I initially gavce this 5/5 but decided it wasn't perfect so 4/5 is once again my rank. Pros: When we were there the meat was perfectly cooked and you could sit there forever and continue eating. Great decor and good washrooms Great value salad/veggie/starch bar which was clean, not cross contaminated and nicely laid out.  I would take a vegetarian here that's how good I thought it was. Really nice fried banana things they give you with your main course, eat them instead of ordering dessert.

It took the bartender LITERALLY 30 minutes to get my husband a beer, and then were seated about 45 minutes after our reservation time. We were right in front of a couple that DIDN'T have a reservation, and we were seated at the same time, so I'm not sure if reservations hold much stock here. The salad bar was AMAZING. The wild mushroom risotto was the best I've ever had. The smoked salmon was nice, and the sushi was simple, and unadventurous, but still delicious. I was disappointed that the oysters on the 1/2 shell weren't properly shucked. (They were still attached to the shell by the membrane thingy). Service was pretty good. I think our server had a few too many tables to keep track, and when I asked someone for a rare rack of lamb, it never came. I also asked one of the floor manager, and still, no rare rack of lamb. The filet wrapped with bacon was delicious, and the house specialty was also delicious.

2007-04-06,5.0,"Oh, Brazzaz. How I love you. You are a prince among Brazilian steakhouses, you really really are. First of all, I just plain love Brazilian steakhouses. I mean, a Brazilian steakhouse would have to try REALLY, REALLY HARD to get a rating lower than four stars in my book. But still, I just love Brazzaz, and I think it deserves its five-star rating. The food at any Brazilian steakhouse is overwhelming, so let's break it down by category: THE SALAD BAR: Wow. Just plain... wow. They have quite an array of food here, and it's definitely not all just your typical run-of-the-mill ""salad"" options (although they do have those). Hands down, my favorite salad bar item every single time is the chicken salad. It's scrumptious. It's scrum-diddly-umptious. It's... the most perfect chicken salad I have ever tasted. Anyway, moving on. The insanely wide range of salad bar options includes tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella, marinated artichoke hearts, cold steamed broccoli and aparagus and sauteed mushrooms, marinated green beans, raw oysters (my boyfriend's favorite part -- I think he ate about 30 the last time we came here for dinner), sushi rolls (good, but a little spicy for me because I'm a wuss), tortellini in cream sauce, mushroom risotto, chicken marsala... honestly, the list goes on and on. You could make a meal out of just the salad bar alone. THE SIDE DISHES: Okay, first of all, let me just admit that I once ate 15 of those little rolls that they bring you. The last time we ate there, my friends instructed the waiter to bring an entire basket of them for me specifically. I know you're supposed to come to a Brazilian steakhouse to gorge yourself on meat, but wow. The little cheese rolls are just incredible. Warm and fluffy and delicious. The other side dishes are yummy too, especially the fried bananas, which taste like dessert. The mashed potatoes are really good and creamy, and the fried polenta is smashing. You can also request rice and beans, but I don't think we've ever done that. THE MEAT: Ahhhh, the main event. My favorite favorite favorite thing is the bacon-wrapped chicken. I know, I know, I know, it's the beef that's the big deal. But I can't help it, I love the way the bacon makes the chicken all tender and tasty, okay??? I also really like both the top and bottom sirloin. My boyfriend loves the garlic beef. And I used to really like the filet, but they started serving it in chunks instead of slices, which I don't like as much (because I'm picky about how well-done my meat is). Oh, bonus, they serve pineapple too... SO SO GOOD. Also tons of other cuts of beef, lamb, pork, chicken, sausage, even shrimp (which we cleaned one gaucho out of entirely when he visited our table with a full load... awesome!) -- basically way too much food, but can there really be such a thing as way too much food? I think not. Yes, they serve dessert and drinks, but we've never wasted any of our valuable stomach space on those things, so I can't review them here. I'll stick with water for my beverage and fried bananas for my dessert, thank you very much! Fogo de Chao is fabulous, too, and will be reviewed soon.

The interior is beautiful, dark wood, very white tablecloths, dim lighting, and clean and elegant surroundings.  I would not recommend jeans or shorts or flip flops.  It's casual-dressy.  Great place for a date! Every time I've been there, there were a lot of large groups, so I think it's a good place to go even if you have a lot of people.  I think the soundproofing is pretty good, because I did not think it was unusually loud.  There appeared to be a lot of business customers and tourist/hotel customers, but it did not seem like a big deal. The food was really terrific.  I love the salad bar.  Although smaller than the salad bar at Fogo de Chao, they had really terrific offerings.  Oysters, asparagus, shrimp, risotto, artichokes - everything is very fresh and very tasty.  I could just eat only at the salad bar and be happy.  The meats were terrific.  My favorite were the bacon-wrapped chicken, the parmesan encrusted pork, and the filet mignon.  I'm getting hungry thinking about it.

A Churrascaria is a Brazilian or Portuguese steakhouse.  Brazzaz is such a place.  The format is this:  You get your table and sit, and small noshes are brought to your table (Typically palette cutting items like bread, or fried bananas).  You  enjoy a well crafted soup, salad and small plate island before returning to your seat, and ordering one of their many vintages.  Then you flip a small plastic medallion over to its green side, and wait.  Before long, a handsome young man appears tableside holding a skewer of meat, one of many varieties that have been prepared for the meal.  At your discretion he slices off a portion and you accept it onto your plate, and he slides on to the next table. This is AWESOME. Being a meat lover, I can say the meat served is the best I've ever had.  Delicious, tender, flavour filled cuts of lamb, sirloin, filet, chicken...even roasted pineapple, sweet and sour and succulent. Brazzaz is always full, so shoot for a reservation.  I'd say it's an excellent place for a big date.  Not the first date, mind you, but maybe the third.

And more importantly, why would a person want to eat so much meat? Thank goodness I wasn't paying because I most certainly did not ""get my moneys worth."" I also have a problem with mixing meat- you know, beef, pork, shrimp, chicken- I tend to think its like alcohol. The more you mix, the sicker you'll feel. The salad bar portion was very good. There were a lot of fresh options and not too many incredibly fatty choices. I loved the platter full of asparagus. The music was a little insane. They lose half a star for playing Paris Hilton's new song. They lose another half star for only offering chicken legs.

MEN that bring me food! hahhaa. now, i wasnt all so interested in the men, but hey, they have my food. give some bedroom eyes to the guy carrying the chicken and the special cut steak, i've got seconds in no time flat!  i dont eat much meat...so pace yourself. i think i almost went blind from all the meat i ate....and i hope i dont develop gout come tomorrow morning.  their lunch costs $20 per person, $30 for dinner. its a lot for one person and for one meal, but you wont be needing to eat for the rest of the day and the day after. just pace yourself while you are eating and bring along people who love to eat. if you think you cant take anymore food, just take a 5 min break or have some vegetables from the salad bar.",0.9499,0.85,0.107,0.043,0.45244360902255637
2006-08-17,3.0,"Good lord... we had the worst experience with our main waiter.  We had a large group (10 people) that wanted separate checks (5 checks) - you would have thought we asked him to part the seas.  We waited (honestly) 45 minutes for him to return and offered nothing but added frustration. They require a deposit for a large group and that is always a hassle... they completely complicated the return of the deposit to the rightful owner in which they gave up and decided to call the manager the next day.  The meat - pretty good, pretty quick and always added more sides as they were eaten.",0.9449,0.824,0.154,0.022,0.6377289377289377
2006-08-08,3.0,"I took my boyfriend to Brazzaz for his birthday.  While it was good, I prefer Fogo.   The salad bar at Brazzaz left much to be desired.  I've had more selection at a soup and salad place then I did here.  Yes, I realize you come for the meat, but they also try to sell you on the salad bar as well.  I didn't feel that there was all that much variety in the meat.   The meat was excellent and the pineapple is to die for, but overall I've been to better Brazilian Steakhouses.",0.8608,0.782,0.165,0.052,0.375

2006-07-08,3.0,"I have been wanting to try a Brazilian steakhouse for a while to see what all the talk was about. Brazazz was very good, but not great. It is a beautiful place and they set out a really nice salad bar, which has everything, shrimp, some sushi, and different greens. The fechuada (not sure on the spelling), which are black beans to accompany the white rice was super bland. It was like black beans cooked in water. I ate them anyway because I love black beans.  Then you move to the steak as this is where I expected to be impressed. It was nice to have the items brought to your table in cut fresh right on to your plate. However, the meat was not melt in your mouth good. Some like the like the filet mignon brought to me was over cooked and dry. However the whole experience was fun. I know there are many similar style Brazilian steak houses popping up, such as Fogo de Chao, so I'll give it another try. The desserts were great. Staff was nice.",0.9943,0.684,0.265,0.051,0.6223927101704879
2006-05-26,1.0,"Brazzaz is okay, the meat doesn't taste that good and the service isn't that great either. It is worth it to go if you get one of their many gift certificates they hand out or the 2 for 1 coupons they send out in the mail.",0.4939,0.709,0.185,0.106,0.49000000000000005
2006-05-22,5.0,"I've been to them all (except Texas de Brazil since that's too damn far).  Meat is pretty much consistent across all of these restaurants.  Friends like pork at Sal and beef at Fogo... blah blah... we can debate until we're hungry about it.  I've been to Brazzaz twice most recently since the gauchos also carry around damn good shrimp and even pineapples.  I feel bad for the pineapple gaucho though since he's more of a novelty. People may reject him since pineapple is really just filler. I also do love the salad bar since they have good additions of rice, risotto, and sushi.   Plus, you can't beat the evening special PLUS they were giving out $25 coupons when our bill came.",0.8979,0.74,0.168,0.092,0.5615079365079364
2006-04-26,3.0,"In a town loaded with Brazilian BBQ joints (I think there are about 10 of them total if you count the ones in the suburbs), I can appreciate Brazzaz trying to differentiate themselve from their competition.  Risotto and raw oysters are a nice change of pace that actually makes me want to make a trip to the salad bar instead of saving room in my stomach purely for meat.  Grilled pineapples and shrimp provide a tasty contrast to the typical assortment of grilled beef/pork/chicken/lamb.  And undercutting the competition by not only discounting your dinner to a mere $40 but also mailing everyone and their mom coupons good for 2-for-1 dinners -- can't complain too much about that.  It was definitely enough to get me to make a trip in for dinner. Having said that, I don't think Brazzaz is going to win out in the long run.  Because despite all the little nuances that make them different from places like Fogo de Chao, Brazzaz disappoints in the one area that matters the most to anyone with a hankering for some churrascaria: the flavor of their meat.  Yes, I get that salt is traditionally the only seasoning used to flavor the meats.  And yes, I'm a fan of salty foods as much as the next french-fries-loving guy.  But that does not mean you should go nuts with your salting.  For some, like the lamb chops and the bottom sirloin, the salt actually accentuated the flavor.  But for most of the other cuts of meat -- namely the bacon wrapped filet and the garlic filet -- the salt was just too overwhelming.  Too salty does not equate to an enjoyable meal.  I think it was just a sneaky ploy to make me really thirsty and order more beers.   In any case, if they ever figure out how to properly salt their foods, I think Brazzaz will be able to hold its own against Fogo de Chao.  In the mean time, I would only recommend going because it's so much cheaper (assuming you have the 2-for-1 coupon) than the likes of Fogo de Chao and Sal & Carvao.",0.9884,0.841,0.128,0.03,0.5304864253393664

2006-03-14,5.0,"This is the third Brazilian steakhouse to hit the River North area in recent years. Although I have not been to the other two, the churrascaria dining experience at Brazzaz is a delicious feast. While it would make sense to pig out on this parade of meat for dinner, the attractive $19.95 price made it a very viable lunch option provided you have a long lunch break (they are currently running a special $40 dinner rate). This gives you a chance to try all the grilled meats (and even grilled pineapple, yum) carved at your table by the efficient gauchos. The accompanying salad bar has some interesting warm and cold choices, including the risotto and Brazilian bean stew. The ever-attentive servers also bring out tasty sides like crunchy polenta sticks, fried plantains, and cheesy rolls, although sometimes they are overeager in replenishing your plates with an even fresher batch of sides. The interior has a comfortable contemporary design that should not revolt you if you spend hours trying all the food here.",0.9702,0.864,0.136,0.0,0.5372767857142856

2005-09-28,4.0,"Trendy atmosphere - I still favor Fogo but Brazzaz definately puts on a good show.  My boyfriend ranks Brazzaz #1 over Fogo de Chao and Sal e Carvao though for their ambience, selection of food/salad bar, and service.  Their salad bar was definately better with options of cold cuts, vegies, cheeses, salads, shrimp, some fish special and sun dried tomato raviolis, this hot dish with mushrooms in it - my fav cut of meat is the NY Strip Steak and the grilled pineapple is a perfect touch.  Dessert is really good, too - we had this carmalized custard that just slid down and topped off the food coma.  Here's a tip for weekday lunches from now until the end of April - they're only $19.99!!  When we went there for lunch today - the waitor was so helpful and nice and even gave us a complimentary gift card as we were leaving. EDIT: They've upped prices - lunch is now $23.99 and dinner is $43.99 Edit 2: Went back here on 12/31/2007 and I have to admit that I was disappointed.  The meats weren't as good as usual and they stopped serving the shrimp.",0.9908,0.727,0.22,0.053,0.6116843033509699
