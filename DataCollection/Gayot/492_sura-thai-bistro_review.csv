I cannot come to this place without having that kind of experience. Sura never let's me down.  My first experience was for a friends birthday party on a Saturday night. They were very accommodating to a group of nearly 15. Service was a little on the slow side. I had the pad see eiw with chicken. It's one of my favorite Thai dishes and it was yummy! I also had a random beer special for that night and it was also good. If I hadn't been on a budget I would have had more.  Fast forward to a girls night here...also a great time! $9 sangria definitely makes for an interesting night! Sushi was delicious! I had the Godzilla roll and a spicy tuna roll. Yum! The lettuce wraps and peanut sauce are also really good! It's fun to watch them make the rolls in the middle of the restaurant.  I love the decor here. The chairs suck! Or it's because my ass doesn't fit, either way I hate them! I feel instantly transported into another neighborhood when I come here. I forget I'm in lakeview.

2011-07-30,3.0,"So last night my boyfriend and I, as well as a group of 5 other people went to Sura for dinner.  I was a bit worried about going because before we went my boyfriend had read some reviews, and needless to say they were not good.  I guess maybe because I was prepared for the worst I had a pretty good experience.   One of the biggest things that we read that was bad about the restaurant was their service.  I expected the workers to be very rude, and they were NOT.  The only complaint that I have is the order in which food came out to us.  I like the idea of it being a Thai/Japanese place, but sushi finishes a lot faster (apparently) than Thai dishes do.  We all got appetizers, which took quite a while to come out; however, they were delish (edamame, potstickers, eggrolls, crab rangoon and miso soup).  Then when they were bringing out the entrees the sushi came out first, and then it took a while for the other entrees.  That was a bit annoying, but everyone seemed to really love their food. I got the chef's sashimi special, which you can't really mess up unless you have bad fish.  It was your typical platter of:  salmon, tuna, octopus, shrimp, and then two other white fish.  Beyond that I also got Smoked salmon sashimi (by far my favorite) and some more tuna.  The other couple got one of the specialty rolls which was the Chicago Cubs roll -- it looked good, however, he claimed it was mediocre.  They had some very delicious combinations for rolls, however, I didn't get them because they come in a series of 10 and I just didn't think I could eat that much sushi.  One of the guys got a volcano chicken dinner which they actually lit on fire.  Someone got traditional pad thai which they said was delicious, and it was a shitload of food.  My friend got Crazy Noodle, which I have never had better than at Cozy, but she said it was perfect.  Then my boyfriend and other friend both got chicken dishes, one sesame, and the other garlic and they both seemed quite satisfied.   Overall, I liked the experience.  The service was not bad. . . . it was just a bit discombobulated (sp?).  So, I would definitely go back again.",0.9734,0.778,0.131,0.091,0.6026899696048633

We ordered a mix of thai and sushi including: * Egg rolls- nice plating with  hot sauce and duck sauce and pretty tasty, not too greasy * Chicken pad thai- just ok * Spicy shrimp- this did not have much spice and the shrimp was not delivered in large enough pieces and got lost in the rice * The virgin roll- this was a pretty good roll. Filled with white tuna, jalapenos, avocado, and served with white tuna and mango on top.  Sura has an interesting vibe, the service was very friendly and inviting, but I cant justify any more than 3 stars. I would recommend sticking with the thai entrees if you decide to dine in.

Delicious!  We also ordered a crab/beef/shrimp fried dumpling on top of a tempura sweet potato slice.  The presentation was nice but the flavors were just ok.  Honestly, I could come here just to eat appetizers since they are reasonably priced ($5-9) and good sizes.   When it came to the entrees, it seemed like every table but ours ordered the Volcanic Chicken which comes full of flames on a plate.  We passed it up for the Panang Curry (pleasantly sweet), Massaman (moderately spicy) and Black & White Tuna (another great recommendation from the waiter).  All the dishes were tasty and something unique about them.  I'll be sure to come back... especially for their tasty house cocktail Asian Pear is one of my favorite cocktails in the city and goes right down, the $5 Pad Thai Thursdays, and Friday-Sunday Tapas from 4-7 pm (""Happy Hour"" on the weekend, count me in!!).",0.9933,0.813,0.157,0.03,0.610506424792139
2011-04-07,2.0,"Made the mistake of going to another bi-ethnic restaurant again...I could've swore I would never do it again after the last bad restaurant we visited. As a golden rule, the sushi will never be good at a Thai restaurant.  My wife bought the special deal thru Travelzoo, so off we went tonight with a good friend of our's. The three of us were not impressed with the décor right off the bat. It's got a retro, London-club feel to the whole place. As one reviewer said, it felt cool for a split second, but the longer we sat there, the more the place felt like a technicolor mental hospital.  However, I agree with our friend that the jazz music was pretty good though. Before we get to the food, let's talk about the service. Our waiter gives off a very strong Euro EMO feel, and we honestly questioned how long he has been in the restaurant business. He didn't offer a tasting for the bottle of wine we ordered, made us re-arrange the table plates to help him put the entrees down, and generally just didn't come off as very seasoned.  However, the food is the real disappointment here. For the Travelzoo deal, we get to order off a prefix menu. The tuna tar tar was overly spicy to cover up the fact that the tuna isn't fresh. The tako sunomono was was overly drenched with dressing. The fried tuna roll tasted and felt more like a pizza puff. All of this is ""ok""...but the real crime against the whole culinary world is the sashimi platter. The fish here just isn't fresh at all. Not-at-all. The waiter actually had the audacity to tell us that there is a 50 cents surcharge for each piece of sushi, and a $2.50 surcharge for the sashimi platter due to the Japan Tsunami situation. When asked if they get their fish from Japan, the waiter said he thinks they get their fish from Sweden. WTF? Sweden? A little hard to believe...and I fail to see how this relates to the Japan crisis.  At any rate, the worst piece of sashimi was the salmon. When somebody says a piece of fish melts in your mouth, that's generally a good thing. Well, this salmon definitely melted in our mouths...but it melted in what felt like a decomposed sort of way. Let me explain. The sashimi rests on a huge bed of ice. Of course, this made the fish taste frozen...and that's the exact trick you would use to cover up the fish that is not fresh. So imagine this - the fish is sort of frozen when it first enters your mouth, so it's pretty much tasteless. As it gets warmed up with the heat in your mouth, the ice melts away, and you're left with tasting a decomposing flavor. All of this take place within seconds...it's quite a weird sensation I hope I will never repeat again. All in all, this place should get a 1.5 star, but I rounded up since Yelp doesn't allow half stars. If you have any standard for sushi at all, stay away.",-0.3079,0.789,0.102,0.109,0.5109242724867725

2010-12-26,4.0,"I'm a local of East Lakeview and there are pretty much a handful of Broadway eateries that I frequent on a regular basis. Sura Thai Bistro did not make that list for a couple of years simply because I always stopped at Wakamono or Joys. The day I decided to stop in was the day I realized my wallet would be a lot better off if I'd been ditching Wakamono (great restaurant, just a bit pricey) and eating at Sura, instead. The Thai menu is excellent and if you decide to get away from the run-of-the-mill Pad Thai you won't be disappointed. Try the Basil/Eggplant Basil dishes, the Lemongrass plate and the currys. Another great win are the Noodle Bowls, Laksa and Roasted Duck (great for the cold nights). On the Japanese menu, the seaweed salad is tasty and provides enough for 2 people as an appetizer. People are correct that Sura's sushi, though fresh, doesn't offer a wide selection but again, the price is right for the standard fare. If you want above average taste for the area, check out the Fire Dragon Roll.  Atmosphere is relaxing though the chairs and tables are more for the ambiance than comfort. Wait staff are friendly if not exactly johnny-on-the-spot. If you go on weekend evenings expect live music, either a DJ or a live band. This can make the place a bit louder than one wishes but the weekday evenings are quite pleasant.

The men's room was absolutely filthy, sink, urinal and toilet look like thay have not been cleaned in ages. Even the cool white tile walls were dirty. Being a nearly all-white restaurant means you need to keep it cleaner than you might other interiors. The white walls were all scuffed up, the stainless steel was rusty and dirty. The white chair bases were cracked and filthy and the chairs could also use a good cleaning. It is a minimal styled place and needs to definitely be kept better.

One of them, after seating me, went back to chat it up with his friends, while I sat at the table.....waiting.....and waiting.....and waiting. However, once the waiter showed up, he was very friendly and outgoing. He was even able to recommend some dishes and drinks. He made good recommendations. The only downside to his service was that my water always stayed empty. Reading some of the other reviews, I have to agree about the interior being dingy and dated.

2010-07-30,1.0,"Such a huge disappointment. My girlfriends and I stopped by here for dinner on a whim last week. We were strolling around the neighborhood, were in the mood for Thai, and the sky looked like it was about to downpour ... the answer was simple: let's eat at the first interesting looking place we find. Unfortunately it just ""looked"" interesting but everything else was lackluster. The service: bad and frustrating. Our server was 'nice' I suppose, but entirely unhelpful. One of our friends is vegetarian and was about to order something but ask them to hold the meat. Sounds easy enough, right? No, apparently they couldn't do that ... something about the sauce also having meat. She asked about another dish, and the server shot down the idea saying it wouldn't taste good w/o the fish-sauce. Fine, so my friend asked about another dish, and another, and another ... seriously, everything that sounded appealing to her at this place had some kind of meat (mainly fish) base to it. Finally, my friend just flat out said to the server ""I realize that you think they will taste bad, but could you please ask the chef his opinion on which of these four dishes would turn out the best without the fish sauce?"" The server refused saying ""no, it is up to the customer's taste.""  No sh*t!!! Of course it's up to the customer's taste ... and this customer was asking for recommendations!  At this point, I was getting really annoyed ... when finally my margarita arrived (no less than *twenty* minutes after I had ordered it).  I thought, ok a drink will make everything better ... right? Oh SO wrong!!! Worst. Margarita. Ever. Tasted like crap AND the rim had SUGAR on it, not salt. It was awful, like the person behind the bar had never made a margarita before in their lives. Finally my friend settled on some vegetable dumplings. I tasted a small bite and agreed with her that they were mediocre and boring. Now for the breakdown of my one star rating: - I had the Black Noodle with chicken and actually liked it ... so two stars for that. - We each wanted a Thai Iced Tea (reminder: this is a Thai restaurant, with the word ""Thai"" actually in the name!) ... the server told us they don't have Thai Iced Tea!  Me: ""Oh, so you ... ran out?"" Server: ""No, we don't make it. You can see it's NOT on the menu."" Minus one star!!! Never going back. Frustrating service, awful drinks, and nearly empty on a Friday night at 7pm. That should've been a dead giveaway that this place was bad, but I suppose we were too worried about saving ourselves from the impending downpour of rain to realize that! Oh yeah, and the decor that many people seem to be raving about? It just looks like IKEA threw up on the place. I usually do like the sleek and modern look, but this place just lacked any character whatsoever.

(I've dined there once in person, non-sushi, and found the experience to be similarly lackluster). Four days later they charged my credit card--twice. I called them thinking this would be a relatively easy error to correct. That's where I was wrong. Four separate phone calls later over the course of a month and a half, and still not fixed. I keep being promised that the manager will call me back--he's standing right there, etc. That the information will be passed on to the accountant. Still nothing. Filed a dispute with my card company and completed a therapeutic Yelp review.",0.9343,0.807,0.146,0.047,0.4565934065934067

But, last Sunday, dinnertime-ish, the place was practically empty. The interior always looked 'cold' to me. I mean, I get that you're going for the whole 'modern' 'minimalist' deal, but come on. Get some personality.  My friends all liked their meals, so maybe I'm being too harsh in my judgment. They had some fancy-ish looking curries and soups. However, I attempted to stick to the staple soup of Tom Yum....and was disappointed. How do you mess THAT up? Their version of the soup was thicker - due to coconut milk, what? I've had that soup a bunch of times and I like it because of the light, yet spicy, broth. This ish was just a fail. And, it was bright red. Fluorescent even.  Effed.

2010-02-14,3.0,"Why are my space chairs gone? =( I first went to Sura last July when I moved into the neighborhood, the $5 Pad Thai is just too good a deal to let go, plus they had great outdoor patio seating in the summer! My first impression?? Great futuristic decor + I luuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuv space chairs!!  I was actually really surprised to learn that Sura was only a restaurant, not a lounge / bar that opened late night! Since then, Sura has changed quite a bit.....  It's still one of my favorite place to bring out-of-town friends to and everyone loves the vibe and modern decoration! Now onto the more important things: food & drinks. Sura's Thai food are really pretty good. I've been to Thailand 6-7x when I lived in South East Asia, and I will tell you they scored an A with their Papaya Salad! The Tom Yum soup is decent, should always be spicier but it has to be toned down to suit most people's palette.  As for the entrees, a lot of the food taste more like Chinese-Thai fusion than solid Thai cuisine for me. The Pad Thai / Black Noodle are great dishes, but they taste like most generic Chinese noodles...   Now, the Phu-Ket Pad Thai is something else! I love the combination of exotic fruits (mango + lime) with the crushed peanut, green onion and hints of chill spices. The dish was lighter & refreshing with the sour tints, yet tasty enough to fill me up halfway through the dish!  My other favorite is Braised Duck soup noodles....  If you love duck as much as I do, you will understand how hard it is for me to resist ordering the same dish everytime I drop in Sura! As for the sushi? Well, let's be honest with ourselves... how can you expect authentic sushi at any restaurant that's not run by Japanese owners/chefs??!  Sura is GREAT for its Thai food, because the owners & chefs are Thai!  Anyone can make a great california roll, but to have the right amount of sour tint (traditional Japanese sushi rice are marinated with plums, to give u a chewy texture + slightly sour tint), fresh seaweed and consistently fresh fish, now that requires years of training or at least someone who grew up living & breathing Japanese cuisine.  Overall, I will highly recommend Sura for girls night out, a date to impress your sweetie with modern & classy restaurant decor + relatively intimate seating, and visits from out-of-town friends. Come here for the vibe, for the sake-infused cocktails, for the great Thai food.  But don't come to Sura if you want authentic Japanese sushi & entrees.",0.9985,0.769,0.215,0.016,0.5047475930262816

The only comment I have is that when I went with my family, they added gratuity without mentioning it to us, even though we were only a party of 5.  Maybe this is a new trend, but when I was a server, we only did this to parties of 6 or more, and always mentioned it to the guest.  I love to tip for our great experience, but letting us know would have helped. Also a quick note to those complaining about sushi quality... it isn't my favorite sushi in the city, but it's not bad.  It's a Thai place after all, so order Thai food from a Thai place, and sushi from a sushi place and you'll have better luck!

2009-07-02,2.0,"Ate there last night, here are my thoughts: Food:  OK, I've had better.  The sushi I has was below average -- did not taste fresh; smelled fishy.   I think part of the reason was that I violated my own rule that I never try to eat sushi on Wed or Thurs (most fish deliveries are Mon and Fri, from what I've been told).  Wife had the shrimp curry panang -- she thought it was pretty good. Service:  Poor.  Perhaps it was because it seemed like the crowd was larger than what I would normally expect on a Wed nite, but service was slow, and it seemed like it took forever to get the servers attention, especially for the check. Decor:  Others might enjoy it, but I find the plastic chairs & tables to be tacky, not swank & hip -- maybe I'm just too old to enjoy. Value:  Though it wasn't expensive, it wasn't cheap either; mostly due to a $25 bottle of below-average wine.

2009-05-02,1.0,"I'll start with the review in brief: Food's mediocre, the all-you-can-eat sushi deal is not that great a deal when compared to Coast (on Damen in Wicker Park), the drinks are mediocre compared to Rodin (on Milwaukee in Wicker Park), the decor's quite interesting and funky (good), the service is good, the management is unhospitable (see below). If you're vegetarian the sushi deal is worthless. Don't waste your time with it. Ok, on to the detailed review. The Good: The decor is very interesting. It's sparse, in a Japanese love-hotel kind of way. It might be considered cold by some, but I think it's sufficiently hip that it would make for a good date place. The Bad/Mediocre: The food is slightly above mediocre. The all-you-can-eat deal is not such a great deal. I suspect that the reviewers who thought it was an outstanding deal have not really done a fair comparison with other places. IMHO Coast beats out Sura hands-down, especially since they're also BYOB, which means your money goes to the food rather than the booze. We did a comparison between what we ate and what the equivalent might have cost at Coast. The difference was $5, including booze ($35/person). The a-la-carte menu (if you opt not to go for the all-you-can-eat sushi deal) is decent. The food is slightly chi-chi pan-asian. The flavors are decent, but the presentation is really very good. Given that Sura's neighbor is Bamee, which has some outstanding noodles and other thai dishes, I'd expect Sura to do a lot better for what they're offering. The closest comparison for me is Rodin (Wicker Park), which has more interesting and creative dishes at about the same price. The Ugly/Intolerable: The management at Sura is probably my biggest issue with this place. I went to Sura with 4 other people. Two of us were vegetarian. I did not realize that Sura had a policy of not allowing a mix of sushi deal and no deal. I vaguely understand this policy given that restaurant goers are all thieves and cheats (yes, that's sarcasm). Once I was told this by our waitress I told her to get the manager so that we could try to explain to him that we were vegetarian and that they had 2 veg options on their all-you-can-eat menu. She said he was on the phone. I watched as he got off the phone and did not come to our table. So I went up to him, tried to explain our situation, and basically asked if he could make an exception in our case. He said he did not have the authority to do this. I asked if he was actually the manager, and he said yes! I re-iterated that basically what he was saying is that we were welcome to stay for drinks but could not eat because we did not wish to participate in the sushi deal which was worthless to us. He said that if that's the way I saw it that's how it was and he could do nothing about it! So I acqiesced, went back to the table and said that my wife and I would only have drinks since this was their policy. My wife decided to take up the challenge, went back to the manager, and essentially convinced him that we would move our table apart from our friends' so that there was no confusion about there being any food stealing. He agreed as long as the tables were 1 foot apart. Given that there was virtually no attempt made by the manager to make us feel like we were in the least bit welcome, and that the food was not by any means outstanding, I really can't imagine why I would either recommend or return to Sura. BTW, the waitstaff is very pleasant.",0.9898,0.813,0.118,0.068,0.5843910256410256
2009-04-30,4.0,"My co-workers and I picked this spot for our monthly dinner club.  We heard about their all-you-can-eat $22 sushi special.  Sura is a perfect place for a group.  There is a lot of space, plenty of tables and a really cool atmosphere.  The décor is copious amounts of white and red, and totally contemporary and fun.  I arrived there with a coworker a few minutes early, so we had a drink at the bar and chatted with the friendly bartender. When our other coworkers arrived, we were seated near the back.  I had been eying the menu while at the bar, and was planning to do something from the grill instead of sushi.  When we sat down though, our waiter gave us the 411.  Rules for the all-you-can-eat $22 sushi special: 1) Everyone at the table has to order from the all-you-can-menu.  So much for my Pad Thai. 2) You have to eat everything that you order, down to the last grain of rice, or else you get charged regular price for what you didn't finish.  Our guy was SUPER clear about this--no getting around this rule.  We started off by ordering two plates of Edamame, and four bowls of Miso soup.  Both were excellent.  The soup was so hot, which I love.  We then ordered two spicy tuna rolls, one California roll, one Godzilla roll, one Spider roll and one Cherry Blossom roll.  I like all of them.  The ingredients were really fresh and flavorful.  The first round. wasn't quite enough, so we ordered three more rolls, and it turned out to be about three pieces too many.  We choked them down anyway.

We started with a couple different apps off the Thai menu: a dish called ""Heavenly Beef"" which was  seared beef strips, with some amazing glaze and sesame seeds, dipped in Thai chili sauce and then chicken lettuce wraps, which were really good, but the wraps were more of a crispy phyllo cup rather than lettuce. But yummy all the same! Our very attentive bartender suggested a roll that he supposedly created that day for a ""special""- a spicy tuna wrapped in seared salmon. We had that next and it was a lovely presentaion and tasted very good. I wanted to stick with the spicy chili taste that was lingering in my mouth from the beef we had earlier-   so we split an entree - lemongrass shrimp. I dug that there is a bowl of jalepenos and thai chili sauce that accompanies entrees. I love catching my mouth on fire and then cooling it off with some ice cold, bubbly Prosecco.

Tierney, our waitress was delightful. Our drinks came out quickly as did our food. Super fast as a matter of fact. The food was fantastic!

2009-02-23,4.0,"We tried Sura Thai on a Monday night. The atmosphere was 'trendy' with almost all white floors, walls, 'egg-shaped' chairs, and tables, with red decorations. There was fast-paced music on, but it was low enough to have a conversation. The chairs weren't very comfortable, but putting the cushion behind your back, instead of under you, helped. It was a bit hard to read the menu, since the lights were dim. They were just wrapping up their $22 all you can sushi window (5-9, Sunday or Monday - Wednesday, I believe.) For future reference, here's how that works: They give you a sheet to order from and many of their menu items (including apps, sushi and maki rolls) are on it. You eat all you want, from that menu, for $22 per person. On this night though, we ordered the Fire Dragon roll, the Ebi Tumpura roll, a couple of pieces of salmon sushi and the Egglplant Basil off of the thai menu, adding brown rice. The Eggplant basil was a generous portion - not as large as some other restaurants but had a more generous portion and variety of fresh vegetables. It was very flavorful and included spinich, red peppers, broccoli, carrots and basil in a spicy red/brown sauce. We liked the option of having it with brown rice, The salmon was extremely fresh, as were all of the ingredients in the maki rolls. The total bill, with a coke, came to $37 for the two of us. All in all - the sushi was excellent, the eggplant basil was flavorful and generous with the vegetables, the price was very reasonable and the trendiness wasn't enough to scare us off. But, really - they have a 'joystick' to turn on the faucet in the bathroom. yeah. Next time, we'd like to order drinks and some apps.

All in all, Sura is a big hit in my book, but here' s a little advice a gay friend of mind offered when I mentioned Sura to him: ""That space is so big!  They need to cut the space in half, so the space fills up more quickly, and then the queens will be flocking in like crazy because they'll feel like they're somewhere important"".   But this queen likes Sura just the way it is.",0.9976,0.756,0.208,0.037,0.5972607022607023

The BF and I went there the other night with the intention of trying out a neighborhood spot and possibly finding a new midweek fave. Unfortunately, we were extremely disappointed with the food, so much so that we went to CVS on our way back home to pick up munchies so we wouldn't go to bed hungry. It was a seriously depressing food experience. First, I ordered warm sake, and it took them five minutes to inform me that they were out of sake. So, I ordered a glass of pinot noir...which turned out to be pretty gross. And it's hard to gross me out with booze, as am I willing to drink just about anything after a long day of work. As for the food, we opted to order a bunch of appetizers to get a good sampling of their food. We got the lettuce 'wraps', the steamed dumplings, the gyozas, and the coconut-crusted shrimp. Everything was served either cold or luke warm, and none of these are cold appetizer items. The lettuce wraps were not wraps at all, and instead were basically a Cesar salad (cold grilled chicken and Romain) with a sickly sweet peanut sauce encased in a crappy caterer-like pastry envelope. I was pissed. I love lettuce wraps and the wonderful interplay of hot chicken, savory goodness, and cold, crispy lettuce. This was the bizarro world version. The steamed dumplings weren't hot, nor were they very savory or tasty. The gyoza were NOT GYOZA, and were more like a samosa or something you would get at an Indian restaurant- wrong filling, wrong dough, wrong everything. The shrimp were not tasty, and somehow the coconut outside appeared soggy. The servers were nice, but my impression of the food was that it was frozen crap they got from some kind of catering supply store and warmed up (just barely) in a microwave.

I had the chicken, which was so flavorful and delicious, I easily plowed through the huge portion. The service is spotty, to say the least.

From the get go, I thought the techno music was a bit too loud and overdone, but I'm not a fusser. Cocktail menu is impressive-- a good selection of drinks and relatively inexpensive (everything from champagne and pomegranate to a coconut mojito for $6 to $9).  Our super friendly server from New Orleans made a few suggestions and our libations delivered on his promise: delicious and strong, just the way we like 'em. My drink, the ""Dark Knight"", tasted like boysenberry syrup! Their menu is stacked with offerings. We ordered the soft shell crab, papaya salad and gyoza as appetizers. The crab was prepared simply, not much to it, but was still good. The papaya salad satisfied for the most part but we both agreed the accompanying shrimp fell flat. The gyoza? Mhm. Just okay. We ordered maki for our main courses. Mine, the fried spicy tuna roll, was a bit anemic and lacked the flavor I anticipated. I also tried my friend's dragon roll. I enjoyed these much more than my own but still found them mediocre.

My friend decided to just waited for my sushi order to come before he started his but we end up just eating his plate while waiting for 1 smoke salmon sushi and tekka (I think that is what it's called). It took forever for my 1 smoke salmon to arrive which is weird but then I'm not an expert on making sushi. I ordered the steamed sea bass with shrimp and it was quite flavorful at first. However, as I started to eat more, the flavor got to be a bit too strong/sweet for me that I needed to water it down or eat the semi dry rice. I tried to avoid the rice since it was quite dry and I'm not a fan of dry rice unlike my friend.  Only one real bad thing about this was the bill came in 3digit for 2 and it was my night to treat.

2008-07-18,3.0,"Sura, oh how I wanted to like you. I planned to like you. Why you treat me this way? The first sign that something might be awry was when the bartender showed up with two bottles of tequila in a plastic bag. I asked him if he had made a quick run to the 7-11, and he replied that there was a liquor store up the street. When I observed that they probably got better prices from their purveyor than from the liquor store, he told me that he was responsible for ordering the liquor, but he had been off last week and they hadn't ordered enough. Yikes. I'll excuse the lack of planning by saying the popularity of Yelp Eats might have taken them by surprise. But your bottom line's gonna kill you. On a positive note, the tequila went into their pineapple margaritas, which were terrific. Sura is very cool to look at, with a lot of high gloss white, red, and silver, which unfortunately is already beginning to show some wear. It must also be a bitch to keep clean. The trail of wet footprints from the kitchen to the dining room showed up magnificently. One of my dining partners said that he wasn't sure whether the look was futuristic or retro, when it struck me: it's both futuristic and retro. The design is the future as imagined by artists from the 1960s. It's like a sushi restaurant on the space station in ""2001."" Even the bathrooms follow on the concept, with a podlike urinal waiting to accept your waste. An unfortunate side effect is the podlike seating. The bucket seats were hard on my larger than average bucket. If you are similarly appointed, you would do well to sit on the banquette along the wall. The food, fortunately, was very good, although some of it was difficult to eat. I started with the Golden Chest Fritters, which are crispy baskets filled with crab meat, shrimp and chicken, and served on a dipping sauce of ... hell do I know. But they were very good -- a perfect size, and nice and crispy. To follow, I had the Tom-Yum Soup, which is served with prawns, cherry tomatoes, and enoki mushrooms. This is where things get difficult. By ""prawns,"" I assumed prawn meat. Or at worst, tail on prawns. Not complete, head-on, dismantle before eating prawns. There are a lot of things I'm happy to eat with my fingers, but soup is not one of them. To be fair, only one of the two prawns was completely in the shell, but since the second shell was in the soup, I'm not sure if the second prawn had been shelled, or had escaped on its own. And the cherry tomatoes looked nice, but how do you eat cherry tomatoes in soup? You don't. You scoop up each cherry tomato on its own, and pop it into your mouth. This soup would have gotten its ass kicked on Top Chef. For dinner, I had the Lychee Spicy Duck, which was very good (though ""spicy"" is certainly subjective), but again, difficult to dismantle. Especially in the dim light of Sura. I finished with the Pomegranate Ice Cream Fritter, which is served over sweet yellow sticky rice and cherry sauce. This was a highlight, though I was hard pressed to find much pomegranate flavor in the ice cream. I wish I could say equaled the food, but it was, in a word, dismal. We created a couple of problems ourselves: two of us ordered from the Yelp Eats menu, one did not, and our fourth showed up late. Since he showed up as we had just received our appetizers, though, this should not have been a problem. The two of us who ordered from the Yelp menu were told we had to order everything at once, because of how the server had to ring in the order. Not a problem, but you would expect under those circumstances that the food would be timed well. Uh, no. Though our appetizers came out fairly quickly, the second course took forever. And then our entrees came before we had finished our soup and salad. Well, some of them did. One entree came out, along with some dishes destined for another table. Than three more came out -- but aha! -- only one was for our table. Then a third entree came out. And then they were done. And the fourth entree? Eventually the server asked, ""Have you received your noodles yet?"" (By this time, the rest of us had been eating, urged on by our fourth companion.) After that, you would think the noodles would miraculously appear. You would be mistaken. It was still an inordinately long time before the final entree showed its noodly face. Bad Sura. Given all this, would I try Sura again? Probably. The food was creative and fun, and the atmosphere -- save the ass-crushing seats -- was enjoyable. If they were to fire half their staff and train the rest, they would have something here. And the prices are so low -- the special Yelp menu only saved us about 5 bucks each -- that you're not risking much. But it's not at the top of my list. NOTE: I received a very nice note from the owner of Sura, regarding this review. It makes me feel more positively toward the restaurant.",0.9949,0.769,0.142,0.089,0.5765635448562277

We had to ask four different people. My second time was an improvement. Liquor had been added to the menu, and the Yelp Elite Squad had been called in. Servers had sharpened up, Beyonce was jumping around on the video wall projection and everyone was seriously digging the space-age egg chairs hanging by chains from the ceiling. And the third time -- a first date -- was a charm, in every sense of the word. Lovely company never hurts the dining experience, but it seems all the kinks have been worked out here. (The kinks in the restaurant, anyway. The rest got worked out later.)  Perfect mood lighting. Cheap bottles of wine, like cheaper than you could buy most nice bottles. Lightning-fast food prep.

Everything is very white- if this was my home it would be one dirty house.  But while super sleek it's also inviting and comfortable.  The futuristic chair (yep, it was white too) didn't look so inviting at first, but Sura provides a pillow to make sure their guests are super comfy.   And my friends and I weren't quite sure what was up with the chairs hanging from the ceiling when we first walked into the bar area, but who cares what their use is when they look that cool.  Actually I'd like to have one of those chairs hanging from my ceiling at home. Board that time machine for the atmosphere, but stay for the food! My party of 4 sampled a bunch of different Thai fusion (sura's wording, not mine) dishes and can't say we left much on our plates. Some favorites included: coconut crusted shrimp app, duck crepes app, the calamari, the tom yum soup (spicy, but oh so good), the green curry, and a special type of pad Thai that actually had mango in it! I highly recommend sharing with your dining companions because you'll want a taste of everything! As far as the service we were given just the right amount of attention from Max (the really sweet manager) and the rest of the staff. They weren't very busy on this Monday night, but I'm guessing Sura gets pretty packed on the weekends. I'd suggest making reservations soon and jump in that time machine for some delicious Thai food in an ultra cool atmosphere. PS- Sura is no longer BYOB so leave that wine at home because they have an impressive drink menu to choose from. Mojitos anyone?",0.9983,0.727,0.236,0.037,0.5754144620811287

2008-01-07,3.0,"I'm being sort of generous with the 3 stars.  But the dishes that were good...were very good so it helps a lot. Generally I get a little worried if I go into a Thai restaurant and there are no Thai staffers and no Thai customers.  My doubts grew even stronger when our waiter couldn't properly pronounce any of the dishes AND informed us they don't serve Thai iced coffee or Thai iced tea.  So it wasn't starting out so hot. The decor is very modern and white and sleek.  But when you actually look at it, it's almost all white plastic lawn furniture.  No one's coat would stay on the back on the chairs and we were all scooping coats off the floor throughout the meal. We had a large group so we tried a lot of appetizers.  I think the stand outs were definitely the crispy ginger calamari.  The avocado dipping sauce was scrumptious.  We sort of fought for it, as there wasn't quite enough. The other winner was the crispy chicken wings.  The sauce on the wings had the right kick and the group agreed it was a winner. For en tree's I won't cover all 8 dishes.  Only a few were really enjoyed.  Luckily mine was one of them.  I had the braised duck in pinot noir.  The sauce was wonderful and the duck was nice and tender.  They were also pretty generous with the portion as I had enough to take home for lunch. Pad Thai was a total loss.  I've had better at mall food courts.  If that's any indicator.  LOL   I will say that they had a very lounge like feel. There were music and videos on plasma screen and pretty young hipster sort of crowd. I think if I'd come for just drinks and maybe a lite bite this place would have fared much better.  But I wouldn't bank on getting really great Thai food from Sura just yet.",0.9946,0.771,0.186,0.043,0.5346248196248196

The ingredients are fresh and the meats are as well.  Apparently, I commented one too many times with our server about the normal frozen produce used at most Thai restaurants; thus, I was actually directed to the kitchen to judge for myself the use of fresh ingredients.  All of the dishes so far have been great, particularly the noodle dishes. As someone who has traveled extensively for business in Thailand, I can assure you that this is a great find.  The two-course lunch menu ($7 for chicken, steak and tofu dishes or $8 for shrimp) is probably the steal of the city.   I go here once a week for lunch and occasionally for dinner.  The liquor license should be here before Christmas.  Enjoy!",0.9652,0.8,0.158,0.042,0.5291666666666667

Sura had some ground to make up to me as I was pre-disposed not to like it for three reasons- #1- I really don't like Thai food, #2- anything that modern looking feels sterile to me and this place is modern! And #3 - the first time I tried to eat at Sura- there was a long wait and no place to wait. Don't know if it was the company I was with or the round of holiday cheer that we had prior to coming to Sura- but I actually walked away thinking ""hmm . . . .pretty good.  Maybe I do like Thai food."" There were six of us in our group so we had an opportunity to taste a wide range of the menu.  For appetizers we had the scallops, calamari,  soft shell crab and chicken wings- at least those are the ones that I can remember!  The food was tasty (the soft shell crab my favorite) and came up quickly.    For entree's we had the Pad Thai, and a couple of other dishes that were equally as good.   If we had dessert- the memory of it was completely erased by the several bottles of BYOB wine that we brought to the place and proceeded to drink it all!! If I had a wish it would be that there would be something to soften the noise level in the place.  The music was good- but by the time we left- we were the only ones in the place and it seemed harsh and loud to me.

I went last Saturday night around 10 PM, and the place was hopping with a pounding club-like beat. We had to wait about a half-hour before we were seated at a table right in front of the movie they were screening on the wall. A little time passed before the waiter arrived, but we were kind of getting into the movie Goodbye Lenin! (excellent by the way), so it was not a problem.  We ordered a couple of appetizers, scallops and fried calamari, which both arrived promptly and were very tasty. I ordered one of the curry dishes and my partner ordered the hangar steak. The rice was presented in a beautiful pyramid on a small plate and the curry in a small glass bowl. It was difficult to eat them both together without making a mess, but it was delicious. My partners steak was good, but he said that he was coming back to haunt him the next day.  Although, Sura is open until 1:30 pm, the place was fairly cleared out by 11:30 pm. We are guessing it was slow because they do not have their liquor license.

With the exception of the scallops, the flavoring of the dishes overall were a bit too overwhelming for my tastes. The high light was the hangar steak, really tasty at medium rare.

The food was good, not mind-blowing, and reasonably priced.  Everything we ordered was pretty tasty and presented nicely but for some reason I feel like the food was not as hot (temperature-wise) as it should have been and the tea we ordered was definitely not hot enough.

The duck crepes were the weakest apps contender, but still not bad. The crepe was too thick and not quite cooked thoroughly, giving it too much of a doughy flavor/texture.

Ever since I heard Sura offered Thai tapas I've wanted to check it out, especially after reading the good yelp reviews. So last night three of my friends and I finally made it happen. When we were seated at a triangle shaped table (that we were told was really meant for 4 people) a server explained that we'd be taken care of by a ""waiter in training"" for the evening. He didn't introduce this trainee though b/c he couldn't remember his name. All I know is this guy was bizarre! We couldn't hear/understand most things he said, and he couldn't understand/remember what we had ordered and kept delivering the wrong food to our table. That said I did feel for him - having spent a couple of summers waiting tables myself I realize that it's not as easy as it might seem. Now on to the food... I don't understand why some of the reviewers loved the Duck Crepes. The table consensus was that they were dry and bland, and my friend Hailey described the Pad Thai as ""dog food."" My favorite was the Basil Chicken entre, (although it still didn't compare to the Basil Chicken at Ping Pong). Next was the Seared Scallops, and the Ginger Calamari. I'll also give a shout out to the Banana Dessert with ice cream. Whatever you do don't order the Chocolate Fondue!

The scallop appetizer was utterly flavorless.  The coconut shrimp and crab/ebi croquettes were both great.  The atmosphere killed it.  While we were eating, my husband told me he couldn't believe I had wanted to stay.  It was so quiet, that when the waiter greeted the only other people in the place, we could hear him saying he wished he brought his homework since it was going to be a slow and boring night.  Classy!

The food is great.  We had grilled steak that was to die for!  We had fifteen people at our table and had pretty much everything on the menu and it was wonderful. TRY IT ....

2007-07-06,4.0,"Me - ""So I guess Sura has Thai tapas.  No idea what that's about."" Friend - ""That's cool.  I wonder how big the dishes are?"" Me - ""I'm guessing the dishes aren't very big.  Probably small portions of random Asian food."" Friend - ""So we're basically eating dim sum for dinner?"" My gf and I went with four friends to Sura for dinner last night.  Between the six of us, we pretty much polished off the entire ""Thai Tapas"" section of the menu.  As some Yelpers have already noted, the dishes are very hit or miss.   Some standouts included: - Crispy Ginger Calamari (lightly battered with aterrific aioli dipping sauce) - Beef Salad (excellent flavor with a little bit of heat to the beef)  - Hung-Lea Steak (very tender and moist).   However, I wasn't all too impressed with the following: - Teriyaki Steamed Tofu (bland and boring) - Scallop 'Ceviche' (the ginger flavor was too overwhelming)  - Taro Egg Rolls (they were fine -- just didn't actually taste any taro). The decor has a modern/minimalist feel to it.  The walls are very white and almost have a sterile feel to it.  I was digging the overall vibe but my gf felt like she would've preferred a bit more color.  They have these swinging bubble chairs in the lobby that are fun to sit in, though probably not after drinking.  The music was a little on the loud side and made it very difficult to hold conversations, despite the fact that there was only one seated table next to us (I can only imagine how loud it gets if the restaurant was actually filled). On the positive side, Sura is still BYOB, though they are trying to secure a liquor license so enjoy it while you can (there is a liquor store about 1 1/2 blocks north on Broadway).  Service was top notch -- very attentive without being annoying.  Our server poured each of our beers for us and I appreciated the fact that he knew how to pour it correctly (ie. not too much foamy head).  The prices are very reasonable for what you're getting -- we ended up paying $20 per person (including 20% gratuity) for roughly 16 dishes.  You may not feel stuffed afterwards but you'll definitely feel satisfied. If Sura was located in a neighborhood like Bucktown or River North, it would probably be making a killing right now.  But since it's in Lakeview, it may take awhile for the neighborhood to warm up to it.  So go check out it out while you can before the word gets out!",0.9899,0.838,0.125,0.037,0.538085078187119
2007-07-05,3.0,"Mostly hit and miss, some dishes are quite good while others are just ok. For some odd reasons, the five tapas that I ordered ended either deep fried or stir fried. The menu is a little daunting, because the list is long and I feel like there isn't enough variation between the dishes. At the end, they all seem similar to me. Perhaps, organizing the items in groups would help. On the positive side, I like the decor and the ambiance. Also I think I saw Dale of the Top Chef fame dinning there, with the faux hawk and all, but I didn't want to bother him.",0.874,0.803,0.157,0.039,0.46322314049586777
2007-06-25,4.0,"So I am usually very picky about any asian fusion food so I was a little hesitant about Sura but we went here for my friend's b-day on Saturday and it was awesome!   The entrance to Sura is pretty small, sure there is a huge neon sign that says Sura on the top of the entrance but Sura in the midst of the bustling restaurants on broadway and right next to American Apparel so its hard to miss if you are not looking specifically for it.  Everything about Sura's decor is super sleek and white.  Sura appears tiny at first but you definitely feel you are walking into a club - of course the little DJ booth in Sura enchances this ambiance.  There is a little waiting area with a bar in the front with several cool open swing egg chairs and white bean bags (yes a little random but they look pretty cool) and then the restaurant opens up toward the back.   The coolest part, the back of the restaurant is a wall of hanging white globes.   The prices are pretty reasonable (considering that they were tapas) We ordered a ton of food and the bill was not as high as we all thought it would be.  And the BYOB definitely helped the bill as well.  The only complaints I have about Sura is it is very loud in there, so I wouldn't recommend this place if you are looking for a intimate dinner where you can hear everyone in your dinner party.  I was only really able to hear the person next to me and we were like screaming.  Also the service is a little off, (maybe due to the servers being overwelmed) they seem to give you blank stares when you ask for something.  They are like oh you want silverware, what for?  What?  You want water?  What? You want new plates for dessert? oh  speaking of dessert, being the big sweet tooth that I am, I would definitely NOT recommend any of their desserts.  Their desserts taste as though they have been outsourced and have been sitting out for a while.  Their banana fritter dessert was the most decent one and come on, you need to do better than a banana fritter to impress this girl! I loved the presentation of each dish and the each tapa is usually presented atop a mound of fresh veggies.  (my fav!)  Tapas I loved! Seared Scallops - accompanied by a fruit salsa  Hung Lea Steak - light and smokey asian BBQ flavor - it is cut on and laid on top of basalmic bed of lettuce Grilled salmon - it is this amazing coconut sauce with a ton of vegetable, I could have drank the sauce it was so yummy! Shrimp Pad Thai - you can't go wrong with a trusted regular Red Snapper - it was prepared well - not dry at all Pass on these: Pineapple pork chops - someone had recommended these and I don't know if ours came out wrong but these were dry and did not taste anything like pineapple - it was so bad that when we passed it around the table, when it came back around, no one had tried it. Taro egg rolls - didn't taste like anything special, I would recommend ordering something that sounds different from what you normally order Skewered beef - again nothing special with this dish - skip it  Calamari - nothing special - skip it - there are so many other dishes to try! Duck Crepe - um it didnt taste like anything",0.9989,0.74,0.211,0.049,0.4933832083832082
2007-06-23,4.0,"""Honestly, I don't know if Chicago is ready for a place like Sura."" that's what I thought when we passed it a few times checking out our new hood.  We heard rumors that it was from the same owners as Spice and Sea back in NYC and we were correct. It kinda makes sense. Sura definitely feels like Spice's younger, less mature sibling. We loved eating at Spice - incredible food at great prices, so we were excited. The first thing that hits you is the decor. White everything, swinging egg chairs - it's the anti-Chicago. Don't forget the music. it's like trying to eat at a rave. The music should help you through your meal, not drown it in glow sticks and E.  But, then there's that small problem of the food. It's incredible. I've found everything in this town to be broad. Not just the shoulders, but the flavors too. Nothing intricate, very little thought out. But, Sura brings all of the pretentious details of New York dining to Lakeview.  We got seven thai tapas: A) Scallop Ceviche - delicious, best of the lot B) Spicy, Ginger Calamari - close second.  C) crab cakes - dense, lots of filler, with a nice creamy dipping sauce D) Blue Prawn - not even worth mentioning E) coconut shrimp - i hate deep fried shrimp - what were we  thinking? F) Gyoza - interesting, but filled with apple?  and the Pear Tart for dessert. Eh, nothing special. So, much like my first girlfriend, I enjoyed the idea of Sura more than the actual Sura. But, there's a lot more to try and we'll definitely be back.",0.9894,0.779,0.181,0.039,0.4450338203463204

Wow was I wrong!  The food was very tasty and the chef kept the true essence of traditional Thai cuisine in all the dishes we ordered.  The prices are reasonable.

2007-06-07,4.0,"I went here with a group of friends, and it was a great spot for our dinner. The minimalist design, music in the background, and mood lighting made us feel as though we were really treating ourselves to a nice night out. Seating is set up very well as there is plenty of room between tables. We felt as though we had our own little nook. You can pick several tapas and share, or order entrees. We did the tapas- each picked two and passed them all around. Its still byob, so our bill was SO cheap. I think we each paid $14...The food was very different- each item had a really unique taste, and I liked the variety. We ordered: coconut crusted shrimp, shrimp pad thai, steamed dumplings, grilled calamari, crab cakes, egg rolls, chicken-peanut sauce something, tofu crusted sesame (you'd think it would be named the other way around...), and some kind of fried packets with chicken, shrimp, and crab inside...but I can't remember the name. Everything was very good, and I highly recommend the crab cakes and little egg rolls. Presentation is done very well, and they bring things out about 2-3 dishes at a time, which was a nice pace. Really, a great place for a group or a date. There is something on the menu for everyone, and its not your typical thai place.  The service was great- very friendly and efficient.

2007-06-03,3.0,"The restaurant has been open now a few weeks so I think most of their kinks are out, but there are definitely some items that still need attention. I came here on a Sunday night so the atmosphere was more laid back. Very neat  space and I think it will do well in Boystown...I'd love to come back and sit in one of the mod bubble chairs you see in all the promo pics. Our waiter was very helpful in steering my friend and I towards his favorite tapas items. Loved the duck crepes wrapped in a coconut crepe, the scallop ""ceviche"" (very refreshing for the summer) and the golden chest fritters were a big ""yum"" for being lightly fried pockets of crab, shrimp and chicken. Everything was plated beautifully and the sauces were nicely paired. My friend got the hung-lea steak ($7 - still a tapas menu item) which was nicely smoked a thumbs up to the crispy calamari as well. Gyoza with Granny Smith apples was interesting, but I think I'd pass next time - it  tasted like an apple pie with soy sauce. Desserts need a little work. I had this wonderful ""fondue"" with an interesting plant I'd never heard of...definitely worth a try. But what would you dip in this delicious dessert? How about some toasted pieces of Wonderbread?! Yes you read that correctly...Wonderbread with fondue. Not your idea of a dessert? How about adding a little pot of Hershey's syrup?

I do wish they would put more ice in the ice bucket for white wine.  We drank our white wine second, but it wasn't cooled at all.   I'm sure, that yes Warren H., you can bring mojito makings.  I'm thinking martinis would be even better!!  There were BEAUTIFUL people there.  All very hippily dressed.  It was a great place to look around at the decor and the people.  The talking was VERY loud , especially at first, when the music was loud.  It seemed to quiet down later, when the music went down.  They could improve on the acoustics.  Great idea on having a DJ.  Just need to make some tweaks there.",0.9957,0.811,0.169,0.02,0.5868150448585232

2007-05-27,2.0,"The decor was certainly interesting and the months of waiting I think built up some serious expectations. At the end of the day this place looks and tastes  like Ping Pong, albeit with a slightly cheaper price point.... That basically means that this is one of those restaurants that tries to coverup extremely average and thoughtless food with decor and hopes that no one notices. I found myself getting extremely annoyed by the reframing of standard, banal, appetizers like calamari and shumai as ""Thai Tapas"" and with the exception of the prawns, the food lacked any sort of taste.  Some specifics: the ducks crepes was flavorless and the sesami chicken tasted worse than something I would get from a mall food court. The prawns were good but hardly filling,  and the calamari was fine.   This place felt like 2 stars while I was there, but I think I'm being a bit unfair. The food and ambiance combo really are a welcome addition to the neighborhood given the prices and it's temporary BYOB. That said, there are some things that can be done to make the food flavorful and actually somewhat indicative of Thai cuisine rather than random-ass pan Asian. UPDATE: They seem to be downsizing their portions, maybe because of the economy. My seaweed salad was enough for maybe three bites and I get very annoyed when they hide huge amounts of cucumber under it to make it look like more than it is. The size of the sushi rolls are also demonstrably smaller.
