I was very impressed. All the noise of a busy city just disappeared.  Started with green mountain jasmine tea. So fragrant. Warm on a cool day. Next the black plate. Order for one and share with two. Eveything was excellent. Perfect balance of savory, spice and sweetness.  Tuna sashimi really sticks out as the winner.  Next the main dish. Shrimp and chicken pad Thai. Let's just say this... Pad Thai was meant to be prepared this way!  Awesome!!!!  So fresh, light but filling, and simply delicious.

Since this seemed like such a popular restaurant I was really surprised to hear this. Pretty much every Chicagoan I knew personally really liked Vong's and would recommend it to me. I ate here a few times, and the food was sort of 'meh' to me. I've been spoiled by the excellent selection of a large variety of fabulous, inexpensive thai places on every corner of Northern California, and as a result I just knew the thai I was eating here wasn't truly authentic. Being in an area that really lacks good quality thai, I appreciate that they probably did their best. They had good service, nice large portions, and delicious alcoholic beverages. Vong's was pricey and worked to be a classy restaurant, which they were. The thai food just didn't compare to what I'm used to in California. RIP Vong's Thai Kitchen.

Don't get me wrong, their signature pad thai was quite delicious, and the drinks (@7.50) were fun and complimented the flavors well. But at the end of the day the red curry (13.95) was missing something and the chicken Satay (6.95) (while well cooked and seasoned) didn't have the same peanut punch that I love. My least favorite dish was the VTK rocket roll (3 for 7.95), made of shrimp and pork. (maybe rocket in thai means anti kosher?). The shrimp was a little too fishy and the sauce didn't add anything. Our service was fine and the decor intriguing but nothing special. At the end of the day would I go back or recommend to friend?

2009-10-06,3.0,"2 words: Chocolate Beignets Vong's was the first stop on our boozy, bachelorette debaucherous Saturday evening. A prix fixe, family style menu in the private room right off the bar was arranged for our party. I'm kind of lukewarm on the whole experience, so I'll break it down by part. * Space - The bar area is way too small for such a busy spot. I also don't understand the need to serve bar bites here either; personally, I would've gone nuts if there were people leaning across my meal every two seconds to order drinks. I think the regular dining tables in the bar area are a bad idea too; nothing like sitting ass-level while a bunch of people crowd the bar and practically sit on your lap while you eat. * Service - Several members of our party described our server as annoying. I didn't find her annoying so much as frequently absent and pushy about some new wine no one was interested in trying. However, the food runners and busers were great at making sure we were in good shape with most things. * Drinks - We opted to exclude drinks from the prix fixe menu. Drinks were pricey, but strong; the Greyhound I got was unremarkable. I found it strange that they only list wine by the glass on the menu, per our server they price bottles at 4x the glass price; I skipped the wine, but I didn't notice anyone complain.  * Portions - Generally speaking the portions were generous, with one exception, the rice. They brought out a small bowl of jasmine rice to accompany our meal. The rice made it to the fourth person before running dry; instead of replacing it with a bigger bowl we kept getting more tiny bowls - what an exercise in futility! * Food - I was lukewarm on the food, but it may just be that Thai isn't my thing. We started with the shredded salad, which was kind of like a Thai cole slaw. Entrees included: Tamarind Glazed Tilapia, Yellow Curry Vegetables with Tofu, Vegetable and Tofu Pad Thai, Grilled Beef Tenderloin Noodles, and Garlic Chicken with Thai Chiles. I didn't try the beef or chicken, but the Tilapia was amazing, melt in your mouth good. I wasn't the only one who thought so, we ended up requesting an additional platter. I wasn't impressed with the veggie dishes at all; I didn't care for the texture of the tofu and found both dishes to be bland. The curry was very awkward; it had a soup-like consistency, but was served in a flat serving platter, making passing it around the table a cruel balancing act. * Dessert - We got an assortment of desserts, in descending order of popularity we had: Chocolate-filled beignets - perfect, round, amazing little dough balls full of chocolatey goodness; warm Valrhona Chocolate Cake - a delectable molten cake served with coconut sorbet and a ginger basket;  warm Passion Fruit Souffle - served with a scoop of ice cream dumped on top, which per the server was THE way to enjoy it. The souffle was weakest link and the only item to remain unfinished; the ice cream the server tossed in made it look all gross and soupy. Bottom line: I almost never eat Thai and know virtually nothing about it, dining here didn't really change that. Everything seemed to be made with fresh, high quality ingredients, but for what we paid I was disappointed. At the very least I expected a lot of spice and flavor, but for the most part we never got it. I don't see myself making this a destination in the future, but if I did it would be for the Tilapia and those chocolate desserts.

Apparently it is Thai-French and I guess I'm a big fan of that combination because Vong's has the best thai food I've had outside of Thailand.   I went with a group of 4 for lunch and we all had a great experience.  We were seated immediately and greeted by a super friendly server.  She was quick to tell us the specials, describe the cuisine and make suggestions. She also explained that everything was made to order so we could change things up. As a vegan, that was really important and pretty awesome. I got the green curry with tofu and it was simply divine. It was served on a hot iron skillet, soupy sauce of veggies surrounded by a mountain of rice in the middle. Very nice presentation.  The tofu was cooked to perfection- with a nice texture and a wonderful sear to it.  The veggies were both unique and lovely - squash, carrots and the highlight - purple cauliflower.  The spice level was great.

And when I mean nothing special, I mean when it comes to something with asian flare I much more thoroughly enjoy Panda Express. The service was pretentious and ignorant. Our waiter looked like a woman from a Pert Plus commercial until it turned around and low and behold it was a man. Who knew? I asked for a specific dish of which I ordered for years from a ma and pa type thai restaurant that was by my house until they retired. So I'm pretty sure I knew how to say what it was that I was ordering. The waiter/ress didn't think so, and took the time to correct me in front of the whole table. Thanks buddy, it is actually pronounced PERT PLUS not PERT PLUS. Same difference. So after we were done making fun of the waiter, we were then basically pressured to leave because they had another table coming in. I understand the concept of turnover, but there are different ways of doing it, and the way they did it was they had a different staff member every two minutes on the dot come over and ask us if we were done with the check . This occured over the course of about 20 minutes. I wouldn't have been suprised if finally the not so well trained cook came out at last with a knife and started yelling at us.

2009-09-09,2.0,"This place puzzles me...hence the slightly schizophrenic review that follows. Our first visit to VTK was about a year ago, and we were pleased.  Not overwhelmingly so, but enough to sing the praises of VTK to anyone in search of an Asian restaurant in the River North area. Fast forward to about a year later (August 2009)... we had friends in town and took them to VTK for dinner.  Although our friends were polite enough to murmur satisfaction throughout the meal, we were a bit mortified by the experience. We opted for the 25 dollar per person family style option.  The black plate, which essentially is a Thai pupu platter, was tasty and the presentation lovely.  However, it is sad when the appetizer platter is the highlight of the evening.  The entrees were adequate, but nothing special or memorable.  I vaguely remember some noodles w/ garlic chicken and a sweetly glazed fish dish.  So how does all this ""adequate"" mediocrity birth such passionate dislike?  We could be nothing but mortified upon being served abysmal, sad bowls of hard white starch VTK tried to pass off as rice.   Any lover of Asian cuisine will tell you that poorly made rice can ruin an otherwise decent meal.  Perhaps it was an off night, but the bowls of rice that accompanied our entrees that night were nearly inedible.  Instead of warm, fluffy pillows of rice, our bowls were filled with hard as rock grains of very dry rice.  We asked for more rice, just to see if we had received a bad batch.  Unfortunately, the second order of rice was just as dry and hard.  Sub-par rice is an unforgivable transgression in even the grimiest hole-in-the-wall joints in China town, let alone a nice establishment in downtown Chicago. After this last experience, we can't believe how pleased we were on our first visit.  Did we simply experience an off night?  Perhaps.  Will we give them another try?  Most likely not.  I've been scarred from VTK's failed rice experiment and it may take awhile for me to recover.",0.9393,0.758,0.133,0.109,0.5462633624878522

As for the the actual Panang Curry, it was deliciously balanced and seasoned. The inclusion of pulled chicken rather than chopped cubes was a nice twist on the typical dish. Vegetables were plentiful and rice was served in the middle rather than on a separate place. I loved the entire experience with one caveat, of my own fault... the heat! The menu indicated that dishes could be ordered ""extra hot"". Being a heat-lover, I immediately selected this option and lived to regret it. Most places offering ""Thai hot"" are merely a Jalepeno in my quest for Habanero, but make no mistake, the heat that Vong's Thai Kitchen served up was HOT!

Perhaps the desserts show the fusion aspect more than anything else on the menu. They are French-inspired recipes with Southeast Asian ingredients. The mixed drinks are innovative (i.e., sake with ginger and house-made lemonade), tasty, and innocently (and deceptively) sweet.

It was annoying and irritating and disturbed us too may times.  The food was very ehhh - the spring rolls were so deep-fried that the only thing you could taste was the oil and the burned skin.  Their ""curries"" are apparently their ""specialties"" - but mine was so watery that it felt like I had just opened and made cup noodles.

Chang's.  And then it up and surprised me. My fiancee told me this place was French-Thai fusion, but nothing on the menu (besides possibly a solid seafood selection) made me think that.  No Rice Noodle Croissant or anything like that.  But the menu was very interesting, with standard pad thai mingling with tamarind rice dishes and a couple family-style plates.  The drink menu was strong, with a range of Asian beers that came with, yes, small cups.  One of my friends who came along is a leading connoisseur of small cups and was immediately impressed. Anyway, we had 5pm reservations so we could get to bed by 8pm like all our crazy Saturday nights, and the place was pretty deserted.  By the time we left, though, it was packed, so reservations are probably recommended at any time of day.  The restaurant even called that morning to make sure we were still coming, which officially makes VTK more concerned for my well-being than my mother. I'm allergic to all nuts, so I'm always concerned about unique food combinations, and, at first glance, a great deal of the menu involves peanut oil or peanuts as an ingredient.  However, just say something and suddenly the entire menu opens back up.  Our waitress shared in my nut allergies and was wonderfully accommodating, and I could enjoy the crab and shrimp pad thai like all the normals.  And that dish was fantastic.  The crab was fresh from Shaw's Crab House and whatever else was thrown in there was the perfect supplement.  Could've used more shrimp, but with crab that good, you don't really notice much.  Our pot stickers appetizer was grand (you only get four, though); make sure you get them fried.  From there on out, service was great, we had a blast, and it seemed everyone else around us was having a good time too.  At first glance, I thought the bill was high, but then my fiancee pointed out how much we ate, drank, and laughed and I suddenly realized it was one hell of a deal.

Although the evening got off to a shaky start (we had to wait until our entire party of two arrived before we could be seated in an empty restaurant on a Wednesday at 6:00PM), Vong's soon redeemed itself. Our waiter, John, was amazing. You could tell that he loves the food at Vong's simply by listening to his descriptions and recommendations. When my friend revealed she was vegetarian, he brought her a special vegetarian menu and was more than helpful in responding to her questions about the differences between various curries.  We began with deliciously garlicky tofu fries with ""thai ketchup,"" a gingery tomato dipping sauce. I may have forgotten their name on the menu, but I will not forget thinking what a delectable tofu treat they were. Crispy on the outside - almost like they were batter-dipped - and firm on the inside, they were the perfect starter to our meal.  I ordered the red curry chicken pad thai. Although red curry is supposed to be spicy, this only had a little kick of curry. I think I would order it extra spicy next time as I expected it to be a little more dramatic. The red curry had a sweetness that would be an amazing contrast to some fiery red Thai peppers.  My veggie friend ordered the Penang curry - one of the best panang curries in the city, according to John - and it was rich and creamy, striking the perfect balance between the velvety smoothness of the coconut milk and the kick of the paprika and ginger. It almost bordered on too rich, but fortunately, never crossed that line. There was a lot leftover - my friend could've used some more rice with her meal.  For dessert, we had a seasonal treat, the pumpkin mochi ice cream, flown in from Hawaii. The mochi, dusted with cinnamon and sugar, was a little tough, which made it kind of difficult to eat. However, once you got past the mochi exterior, the ice cream was amazing - like all the flavors of pumpkin pie melting and dispersing slowly across your palette.

Not exactly the thai food was expecting, but it was too late to change my mind.  I have to admit that I went straight for the Garlic Chicken noodle dish because of the avoidance of curry or pad thai. Instead of the typical wide rice noodles found in Chinese chow fun that are stir fried along in the work, they flash fry the noodles so they have a chewier consistency. Although wary of my order, the tastiness and texture of the noodles made up for it.  Although not a resounding review, I'd definitely go back to try some other things.  Best highlight: Surprising consistency and texture of flash fried rice noodles. Low point: It ain't authentic thai food and the menu is limited.",0.9513,0.837,0.119,0.045,0.3960476190476191

The decor is what made me never enter.  I'm a firm believer that the nicer the decor is in an Asian restaurant, the crappier the food.  I have many, many examples of this.  So, upon seeing the low-lit wood paneling and painted booths, I immediately thought, ""This is a place where a guy who has no clue brings a girl who has no clue."" I was wrong.  I've now had the Panang Chicken, the Red Spicy Curry Chicken, and the Tamarind Tilapia and all of them were flavored just right.  The passionfruit souffle dessert was unbelievable.  I'm going to go back and get just that even if I'm not in the mood for Thai.  About the only bad thing I can say is that they give you less rice than you need to sop up all of the curry soupy goodness in some of the dishes. The only thing I'll complain about is the price.  This is easily one of the most expensive Thai restaurants I've eaten at.  A plate of Panang Chicken will set you back $13.  Most Thai places are $8-10 for a dish like this.  Then again, most Thai places look like they furnished the place from a mixture of Walmart and Ikea, so I guess I'm paying for ambience. Enough said.  Go try this place when you're feeling like spending a bit of money and want a Thai-like experience at a restaurant that doesn't look like a dump.",0.9556,0.817,0.121,0.062,0.5387085137085137

Putting everything behind me, I went ahead and ordered for our table.  They were great about bringing out plates so that we could all share the entrees.  The group-share menu seemed like a fantastic idea and I probably would have ordered but I was with light eaters and it seemed like a waste to order so much food.  I ordered pad thai chicken which was just ok.  My sister and her friends said it was a bit spicy, although I didn't notice.  I guess something to note should you go and order this for children/teenagers.  The penang shrimp was fantastic, I would definitely go back and order this again.  We also had the beef tenderloin with the tamarind glaze and the meat was so tender that it was hard not to love at first bite.  Potstickers were good but nothing out of this world.

There were four of us, and the ""family-style"" lunch special was just too appealing sounding. It came with a cold peanut noodle salad (with apples), and a cold bamboo shoot salad. I ordered the fresh lemongrass soda with lime. Fairly tasty. If you like lemongrass, go for it. The entrees we all shared were vegetable pad thai, and two kinds of chicken curries. I tried the sauces to those, but as I don't eat meat I skipped the actual chicken. My companions claimed to enjoy it.  Our deserts were adorable. The tamarind creme brulee came in demitasse espresso cups, and, the passionfruit sorbet/souffle combo was yummy but very sweet. We also sampled the chocolate lava cake with coconut sorbet, the fruit salad with lime sorbet, the orange coconut cookies, and the chocolate filled beignet with coconut cream. If we'd had any room we'd have tried every single desert. They're cheap and delicious- definitely one of the star attractions here.  Mostly, I think VTK has about average thai food...

I added a chili pepper to it.  As an entree I had the combination Satays, which included decent tofo, greasy shrimp, good chicken, and excellent beef.  Overall, I would rate the satays as decent. Entrees I have to say, I have had a lot of Pad Thai in my life.... but nothing like this.  It was oily and not very sticky like I tend to like my Pad Thai.  It was pretty bland, I also added red chili paste to this dish.  For $14 I was expecting something amazing but received something I probably wouldn't pay $7 for. Dessert We skipped it.  We were too annoyed at how much had already spent on mediocre food. Overall I would totally pass on going back.  I wish we went to Tamarind....",0.984,0.695,0.192,0.113,0.5842105263157894

It's also filled with generous lumps of crab so take advantage, it's awesome. We also ordered the citrus seafood curry. We wanted to spice it up a bit and order something different than regular primary colored curries so we went out on a limb and tried the seafood curry. VERY good. The citrus taste to it was amazing and it's filled with yummy oysters, clams, calamari, scallops (my fave) and shrimp. We had to ask for more rice though. Why do all the Thai places try to jip on rice? No clue. They have a wonderful array of cocktails, wine, and....beer? Not sure about the beer but definitely lots to choose from in regards to liquor-based and grape-based beverages. I ordered some great little tasting treasure with sake, ginger and lemonade. Yummy. So the service...it was great until the very end. I'm not sure if we did something to offend our waitress (Melissa) but when she set our bill down, no thank you. When she picked it up, no thank you. We had 3 credit cards in there and she didn't even ask how we wanted them split. Luckily into thirds was fine but what if it wasn't?! I totally think waitressing is an incredibly hard, stressful, shit job so will give her the benefit of the doubt; maybe she had a bad day.

For starters, had the chicken samosas with cilantro yogurt dip.  They were excellent and I highly recommend them.  But you only get 3 samosas for $8 (hence my comment on price).  After a long wait, we finally got our entrees.  Had the grilled tamarind beef and that was really good.  The red curry beef tenderloin, on the other hand, was not that exceptional.  They did a good job with the chicken pad thai, but it'll be hard to mess up such a basic dish.  The Thai crispy wide rice noodles were interesting because the noodles were really thick, thicker than the kind you would see in a pad kee mao, and they were fried to a crisp.  This was innovative.  They had a great homemade chili sauce that the waiter recommended and I highly recommend it as well.  Although the sauce seems to be based on sriracha sauce on first impression, there are some twists to it that pack a punch. The menu had three different options for prix fixe dinners.  Maybe next time I'll try those out.

The food and the service at Vong's can best be described as inconsistent.  On our last visit it took us almost two hours to get through dinner, which is way too long for a restaurant of this caliber.  We waited for a long time for our food, our dessert, and our check.  What was more annoying, though, was the contrast between the server's pace - very leisurely - and the pace of the staff who cleared the dished and filled the water glasses - fast to the point of being careless.  Our dessert was cleared away before we had finished, and we weren't asked if we were done.  Our server was nice enough, she just wasn't very attentive.   The food was also hit or miss.  The appetizers are good, not great.  They certainly aren't of the quality that you might expect from a Lettuce Entertain You restaurant operating at this price point.  The tofu yellow curry with vegetables was tasteless.  (Yeah, I know, tofu is tasteless...)  The sauce for this dish is thin, watery, and virtually without flavor.  While the tofu was tender, it had no chance of being appealing since the sauce was so blah.   The chicken curry with rice noodles, though, was very good.  The sauce on this dish was delicious, and the rice noodles were unusual but very tasty.  Our dessert - the chocolate cake with coconut sorbet - is the signature dessert (or so we were told).  I prefer the sampling of creme brulee that we had on our first visit, but both of the desserts are quite good.   All in all, Vong's is a decent option if you are in the mood for Americanized Thai food that is slightly overpriced.  The location is very convenient if you are in the River North neighborhood, and the atmosphere really is nice.  If you are looking for better ""bang for your buck"", I would recommend the Pad Thai at Big Bowl - another LEY property.",0.9934,0.827,0.136,0.036,0.5802678571428573

2007-12-30,3.0,"Overall our experience at ""VTK"" was okay, but when weighing the cost and the experience, I think this place is in a bit of a no man's land for me.  If I will be spending $100+ for dinner with my wife, I want to enjoy the experience more than I did here.  And if I just want some good Asian food, I can easily do that for less than $100.   There was some creativity in the dishes we tried, and service was mostly pleasant.  I think a big reason I didn't love this as much as perhaps I could have was the table we were given, which was the banquette section immediately on the other side of the host stand.  Definitely felt apart from the rest of the space's vibe.  If you are intent on going to VTK, I'd suggest declining that table if it is offered to you. Highlights / Lowlights: What was great - Tenderloin satay.  Mouthwatering, tender, delicious. What wasn't so great - Host / hostess service.  We were there at 7:30 on Christmas Eve and they were closing at 9.  The place wasn't packed and there were better tables available in the dining room, but the hostess just dropped us at the nearest table she saw, on the banquette.  This kind of thing indicates she's either clueless and not thinking that 'hey, it's kind of a special evening and there are better tables out there, why don't I hook them up?', or she just flat out didn't care about anything other than putting out minimal effort.  Of course, this could totally be an isolated incident, but you hope that a restaurant's management sets the tone for service basics to the point where it's second nature for everyone on staff.   Scorecard: Two critical questions Would I eat here again?   Sure.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to do so. Was it good value?  It was fair.  Essentials Food - Mostly good.   Appetizers were mixed:  tenderloin satay was fantastic, the tofu jenga wasn't great (clever name and presentation, nice tomato ginger sauce, but the tofu itself was over seasoned - each bite was a mouthful of salt and garlic).   Entrees were pretty good.  The pad thai in the salmon pad thai was great, with moist and flavorful noodles.  But the cut of salmon perched atop the noodles didn't add much to the dish.  (Not sure how else one could prepare this dish, but it was just odd seeing the fish in one big piece sitting on the noodles.  No other pad thai that I have seen comes like this.  Chicken, beef, tofu - they are all shredded or cubed or spread out in the dish one way or another.)  My wife had the shrimp and scallops in the citrus curry and she claims it was good.   Their wine options provided a nice breadth of options if not a lot of depth.  The list includes one bottle (maybe two, max) of interesting choices like beaujolais, tempranillo, malbec, but they also cover off the more common US wines (cabernet sauvignon, pinot noir).   My adventurous wife opted to try the 'mistletoe' - a concoction of gin, strawberry liqueur and maybe mint.  $11 worth of 'not great'.   For dessert we tried the 'creme brulee trio' and the warm chocolate cake.  Cake was fine - not too sweet, which is nice - but it wasn't particularly memorable.  The creme brulee trio -- ginger, tamarind, coconut - was mixed.  My wife loved the coconut, I liked the tamarind and, to my palate anyway, the ginger flavor was so subtle I would have believed it if you told me it was a placebo serving.   Service - Our server was pleasant and helpful, but maybe a little less frequent with the check-ins than we would have liked.  Good enough, not great. Amenities Atmosphere - Probably nicer from every other table in the room than from the one we had, so I am not the best judge.  Dark, contemporary, nice enough.

The Pad Thai was a melding of many flavors - sweet peppers and spice from the onions and a hint of spice (heat), with a citrus overtone.  The chicken was juicy and cooked to perfection. The lobster citrus curry was impressive.  The maine lobster was soft and juicy- not chewy at all.  The curry had an amazing citrus zing, with lemon and orange in it, and had a hint of sweetness from the peppers. The warm valrhona chocolate cake was the best!  It came with a scoop of coconut sorbet in the middle of the plate, with a waffled chocolate cookie placed on top and cocoa powder.  Soft cake with rich chocolate oozing out and a perfect mix with the cold coconut ice cream.  A great mix of rich chocolate and light and refreshing coconut.

We did the group share menu, which is $24.95/person and offers a variety of appetizers, your choice of entrees and desserts, with the amount of food served based on how many people in your party.  We had 4  people in our group, and we each got 1 piece of the appetizers that included -tuna roll -duck roll -chicken satay -coconut shrimp -an eggroll.  We also had a large plate of salad that came along with this.  All of the appetizers were delicious!  I would recommend to eat the eggroll last with the lettuce wrap they suggest.  For our entrees we were able to pick 3 and chose the Panang Shrimp, Crab & Shrimp Pad Thai, & Tamarind Steak.  All of the dishes were prepared well and were unique tasting.  My favorite was the Tamarind Steak as it came with this incredible side of fried rice that is only describable by eating it yourself.  Keep in mind, its an little known fact that you can actually get refills on these entrees (we were too stuffed to get to that point, but its useful info!) For dessert we split the Warm Valrona (Lava) cake w/sorbet & Passion fruit Souffle.  If you are a dark chocolate fan, DEFINITELY get the Lava cake and order a glass of Syrah to compliment it.   I think the ambiance was perfect, it wasn't too loud to have conversations, and the service was perfect, our server didn't miss a beat.",0.993,0.824,0.163,0.013,0.626419413919414

2007-07-31,3.0,"Five words for you:  Crab and shrimp pad thai. Ordinarily that's all you would need for me to whole-heartedly guarantee a fabulous experience at a place like Vong's Thai Kitchen, but the service kind of sucked - so you should keep that in mind.  Here's the good, the bad and the ugly of it all. A group of six of us walked in to the restaurant to see if there was an open table - and perhaps wait for a while at the bar.  We were told they had a round table for six, and would be able to be seated immediately.  We told them a 7th person would show up at some point and if we could squeeze in a chair.   The hostesses wavered, grimaced, fussed, did their make-up, and I don't know what else - before they said ""Yeah, I guess we can do that."" Huh?  So we were seated and the server came to do his thing.  We ordered, and not once, but TWICE I was asked to scoot in by other servers.  I told them no both times.  And the second time I told them to tell the woman at the other table behind me to scoot in.  Her fat ass was taking up TWICE as much room as I was.  Sorry.  I'm not scooting in to accommodate the other diner's need for more space.   Annoying.  Another thing that sucked about the service is that they don't offer shots.  OK, we had a frat-guy Chad type in our group who ordered shots for the table.  But instead of the server saying ""We don't offer shots, but just regular rocks glasses of liquor"" and telling us ahead of time - he just brought them out and surprised us on the bill.  SHIESTY!  Had we known, we would have ordered 3 and split it among us.  Instead he brought us 6 rocks glasses full of Makers Mark and charging us $48 at the end of dinner for the 6 glasses.  Got me kind of sloshed toward the end of dinner, but annoying, nevertheless. So that was the bad and the ugly.  Here's the good.  The food was terrific - pricey at $17 for the pad thai.  Thai food is notoriously cheap usually.  I took the recommendation of a friend and ordered the crab and shrimp pad thai and was pleasantly surprised.  Heaven on a plate.  Good sized portion - not too large and nice balance of bean sprouts, noodles and fresh-tasting seafood, although the spice could have been a bit stronger.  The tuna spring roll sushi app was great pick.   The decor was quite the winner - think tropical urban sophisticate lounge sort of vibe.

Good thing, as I mentioned before!  The wait turned out to be about 5 min-just enough time to order a drink...Right away, I noticed a hair on my napkin roll-kind of unappetizing, but not a big deal.  They bring out a complimentary thai salad which we ate a few bites of...until my friend found another hair in it (wtf?).  She told the waitress, who sincerely apologized.  We told her it wasn't a big deal at all...we just didn't want to look at it anymore.  We ordered a shrimp appetizer, which was good, but small (fine for two people, though).  We split the chicken pad thai, which was basic, but tasty. It was a perfect portion to split.  The manager also came out and apologized for the salad hair, and told us to order a dessert on the house.  Who would pass that up??  So we ordered the beignets.  Now I always get the beignets for dessert from Luxe Cafe (I know, touristy, I don't care), and you get about 15 huge suckers, with three dipping sauces.  VTK's portion was four teeny tiny beignets with melted chocolate in the center and a conconut dipping cream on the side.  While small, it actually hit the chocolate craving and the whole dinner left me satisfied.  Overall?  Food is good, not spectacular by ANY means.  Go there for the drinks and atmosphere to start off a girls night out.",0.9942,0.811,0.165,0.024,0.5101741622574956

The staff was able to accommodate our party, which grew from six to seven persons, easily. We were seated towards the middle of the room at a round table. The table had circular extension leafs and was not level; this was a table that I would expect at a diner, not a middle-scale restaurant such as VTK. There was an over-abundance of silverware on the table, as well, which struck myself and my co-diners as simply ""odd"", and the wooden, cheap, break-apart chopsticks also were annoying. Our waitress promptly arrived to serve a complementary radish appetizer. It was a small dish and for seven, hungry, men, it didn't do much. VTK has a nice selection of interesting drinks such as spicy lemonade and a lemongrass soda. After ordering our drinks, we immediate gave our order for the main course. Our water glasses were kept full during the duration while our drink order was filled. ...and so our wait began... The entrees took approximately thirty-five minutes to be served, with the waitress only acknowledging our table a single time during that time. The restaurant was beginning to clear by the time our orders were taken, so limited staff should not have been an excuse. When we asked for our meal, our waitress said the chef was ""very thorough"". Unfortunately, it was still another ten minutes before the food was served, and only six of the seven plates were served, with the seventh diner having to wait for approximately five more minutes. My selection was the shrimp and scallop in citrus curry. It was fair, but as with all Lettuce Entertain You restaurants, the food was greasy (how do you make greasy Asian food!?) and only fair, at best. My entree was accompanied by a Thai Iced Tea. Unfortunately, no customary Thai condiments, such as crushed peanuts, sugar, or chili paste, were made available to the table. All in all, we waited far too long for our meal and no apologies were given from the kitchen, nor the wait staff.

While I think it's really cool that this has become the ubiquitous $7 meal, sticking with 10 year old conceptions of Thai food is really pretty unacceptable at VTKs price point.   I was working in Asia a couple of summers ago and after I had tired of looking at statues of smiling Buddha, pensive Buddha, dancing Buddha, and ticklish Buddha in my free time, a friend and I decided to take some cooking excursions in Bangkok and Hanoi. From what we learned, these chefs, who have an increasingly global orientation, have actually moved away from curries, and more toward ""drier"" sauces that actually lets the freshness of the meat or seafood come throug. The addition of tamarind as an essential has also been an interesting flourish. While top Thai restaurants in  SF, NY, and even London (egad) have kept their eyes on this trend, VTK has completely missed out on these interesting trends, due largely in part to the complacency of restaurant monoliths like Lettuce Entertain You.

The food is basic thai food, I think even a little bland at that, even ordering things spicy here doesn't make them spicy.  And the food consistantly has taken FOREVER! to come out, it's a shame.   The interior is decorated sort of like a thai swanky club with the round booths and slow speed low fans, but come for the drinks and don't expect much on the food.

I ordered their signature crab and shrimp pad thai.  To be honest, I don't think it was worth more than $15; I've had better.  However, their Thai iced tea was fabulous, not too sweet or milky. This is a great place to go in the downtown area if you need a place to relax with decent meals.  Granted, the portions are big, but the quality isn't worth the price.  You're probably paying more for the ambience than anything else.",0.9505,0.769,0.194,0.037,0.5552941176470588
2006-07-22,5.0,"Great thai food at a great price!  My mom and I had lunch at VTK and decided on the three-course menu for $12.95 per person. Who can beat that? We got the Chopped Chicken Salad, Chicken & Shrimp Pad Thai, Red Curry with Jasmine Rice, and Mango Rolls & Ginger Creme Brulee for dessert. Everything was delicious--and the desserts were one of a kind. The Mango Rolls were sushi with fruit: shaved mango as the wrapping, sweet vanilla sticky rice and a raspberry/kiwi center. The Ginger Creme Brulee was an innovative and delicious twist on a old favorite. It's hard to say Creme Brulee isn't good, however, I never order it. But when you put something like ginger in it, count me in! Don't forget to try one of their unusual drinks: I had the lemongrass iced tea and my mom had the passionfruit iced tea--both were yummy. The food was fresh and authentic, the service was great, the price was definitely right, and I already want to go back. Enjoy!!",0.9916,0.741,0.239,0.02,0.6393990929705216
