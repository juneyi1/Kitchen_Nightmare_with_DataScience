2007-01-05,1.0,"This place is suddenly and inexplicably closed. When I passed it on Wednesday, Jan 3, the windows were papered over and there was a sign on the door which read, ""Rioja is closed permanently. Employees can pick up their belongings on Friday, Jan 5."" Eeek! The website says the closing is ""due to termination of lease,"" but if that was the case, wouldn't the employees have had an opportunity to get their belongings out in advance? Okay, now I'm just starting rumors. It's too bad, because Rioja was pretty good, and it always seemed to be busy. That's 3 for 3 for Jack Jones in Andersonville. Before it was Rioja, this place fizzled as Atlantique, and his crappy diner on the corner of Foster and Clark never took off. Bye Jack!",0.629,0.832,0.102,0.066,0.4241666666666667
2006-11-21,3.0,"Enjoyed it.  Last minute reservations relegated us to the bar area, but that was still fine.  Queso de cabra, beef tenderloin w/ onions & peppers, tortilla de espanol, and one or two other plates - all solid.  Couple of good glasses of Spanish red.  Only issue would be w/ the music, which was totally random - not Spanish, not romantic, not chill - but more a string of B-list pop/rock songs from 90s and prior.  Weird.",0.846,0.802,0.157,0.042,0.3894444444444444
2006-05-27,4.0,"I love Rioja. Some of the things are passable (the seafood salad on the cold tapas, for instance), but most things are divine. The goat cheese in marinara is great, as is the halibut, the short ribs, and the fillet. I am not a dessert person, but the chocolate cake with the almond center just makes me wilt. The best part is the impeccable service.",0.9696,0.75,0.25,0.0,0.5375
2006-04-19,2.0,"Sometimes I'm amazed there aren't more tapas places in Chicago.  It's such a simple business model -- make people pay for overpriced appetizers and watered down, fruity red wine.  That being said, I'm a huge fan of tapas and I'm always looking to try new places that might measure up to the likes of Cafe Iberico and Cafe Ba-Ba-Reeba.  Unfortunately, Rioja was not one of them and thus will be falling to the wayside with the likes of Emilio's, Twist, Sangria and People's Lounge.  WORTH A TRY: The fried lobster ravioli (crispy on the outside, soft and tasty on the inside) and the lamb chops (small portions but excellent flavor)  WORTH PASSING ON: The grilled octopus (tomato sauce made the octopus taste rubbery) and the raspberry red sangria (the raspberry Torani syrup that they probably added to it made it taste like oversweetened fruit punch)  WORTH NOTING: Food and drinks aside, the service at Rioja was excellent.  Our server (who happened to be a guy wearing barrettes, which isn't really relevant at all but I thought it was worth mentioning) was very attentive but never pushy in terms of getting us to order more tapas or sangria.  Our bread basket and waters were always refilled promptly without us having to ask.  Many restaurants could learn a thing or two from Rioja on how to take care of their customers.",0.9873,0.826,0.157,0.017,0.45911714548078175
2006-01-20,4.0,"Wow!  What a dream for your tastebuds!  The most authentic spanish food I've ever had, so if you're looking for BaBaReeba fare, this is not the place for you.  The waitstaff is knowledgeable and totally honest i.e. telling us to avoid the empanadas (wish we had!!!) and to partake in the ice cream (wow!) and the flourless chocolate cake (wow again).  The plate with serrano ham, cheese, chorizo and white anchovies is heavenly!  Our group also loved the octopus, lobster and crab ravioli, steak, and the potato omelette. You ABSOLUTELY must try the sangria!  Definitely a great place for friends and conversation.",0.9802,0.749,0.233,0.018,0.6909090909090909

2005-08-02,5.0,"I have never been to a Tapas restaurant in Chicago that did not disappoint, until now! In all honesty this is the best of the best, in the Midwest anyways. It space is open and elegant, the wait staff very pleasant, and the food to die for. Tapas dishes come in two portion sizes to accommodate intimate as well as larger parties. The menu is diverse accommodating all types of tastes. I apologize in advance to my vegan friends but my favorite dishes include: the sample plate which includes Spanish white anchovies (I never met an anchovy I liked till I met these; lay it over a piece of their incredible bread with a smear of roasted garlic), the clams spiced with chorizo (who would of thought), and last but without doubt the first, the lamb chops, you will wonder how beef ever became so popular. It can get kind of pricy for large groups, but still very affordable for smaller parties especially if you order wisely. Oh and deserts are a must try, get a few and share them as well. If you have never had the joy of sharing exquisite food with good friends, or even with people you don't hate, this is the place to have your first or any such experience.",0.9936,0.714,0.248,0.039,0.5664965986394558
