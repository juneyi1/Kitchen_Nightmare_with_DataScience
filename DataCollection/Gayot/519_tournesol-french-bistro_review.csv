2005-12-21,5.0,"This used to be my absolute favorite place for french cuisine, prices were reasonable, food was great, atmosphere was classy & low-key, far less obnoxiously busy than nearby Bistro Campagne can be. Â In August of 2005 they changed their name to Cork, now they are apparently a wine bar, I've not visited their new incarnation which food-wise now serves only ""small plates"", sounds kinda like french tapas or dim sum??",0.8611,0.802,0.16,0.038,0.5480808080808081
