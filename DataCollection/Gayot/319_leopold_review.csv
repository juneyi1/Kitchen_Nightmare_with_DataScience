The service was fantastic. Our waiter did a great job of explaining the menu and providing recommendations. The decor was trendy and it was a little loud but it was spaced out well- it didn't feel like you we're cramped.  The food was delicious as expected. We started off with oysters which were fresh and delicious. They also paired well with our wine. We continued with the beef tartar that was so good our party was fighting over the last bite.  We also enjoyed the braised rabbit leg - it was so tender and juicy.  Of course, I have to mention the poutine. It was the perfect balance of salty goodness. Just thinking about it makes me crave it! Everyone loved everything.  I am really hoping we can make it back for one last bite. I wish we had more time to enjoy. I will definitely keep this chef on my radar.",0.9965,0.67,0.297,0.033,0.5765151515151514
2013-03-20,5.0,"Unfortunate news, guys. I'm gluten intolerant.  Womp womp. Cya, (conventional) bread, pasta and beer.  First off, I will say that it really rustles my jimmies when a restaurant says they can make food gluten free and it's not. It really messes up the rest of my day (and can carry on into the next several days). That said, I can be justifiably apprehensive when I eat out these days. Leopold did an amazing job accommodating for me and a friend with Celiac Disease. There was no cross contamination and the waitress knew what we could and couldn't eat.  We had duck breast with duck hash (HOLY SHIT, so good), a cheeseplate, a smoked salmon salad, a roasted squash salad and sorbet. The non gluten items the rest of our companions ate were brussel sprout gratin, poutine and a pave.  Everything was so good and Leopold did an excellent job of keeping GF diners happy.",0.9361,0.796,0.148,0.057,0.5193650793650794

2013-03-17,4.0,"Food: 3.5, service: 4.  FOOD: My boyfriend and I went to Leopold Friday evening to celebrate his birthday.  We selected four dishes (plus dessert) from the menu. The waiter recommended two to three dishes, but we were hungry and wanted to try a variety of items.  We ordered: 1) Apple-Sage Pierogis: Farmers' cheese, potato, spaghetti squash, swiss chard, sherry gastrique, creme fraiche; 2) Warm Winter Squash Salad: Arugula, farmers' cheese, pomegranate, pumpkin seeds; Belgian ale vinaigrette; 3) Mussels with Frites: Goose Island 312, Sriracha, blue cheese;  4) Black Bass: On special... I don't remember the exact preparation, but it had some kind of vegetable puree, thinly sliced beets, frisee, tomato confit, etc.; and  5) Cherry Root Beer Sorbet by Black Dog Gelato. My favorite dish of the night was the pierogis. Rich and delicious. I especially liked the spaghetti squash and would have happily eaten more of it. A very comforting dish.  The salad was good, but nothing special. It wasn't warm as the name indicated. I'd skip this one and order something else.  Mussels were also good. I liked the preparation, which was one I'd not seen before. My boyfriend thought it was too spicy, but I enjoyed the heat. The frites could have been crunchier, but I still ate them all with the tasty aioli with which they were served.  The waiter made the black bass sound amazing. He said it was among the top fish dishes he had ever tried. It was good, but again, not great. It wasn't especially memorable. My boyfriend ended up eating most of it.  Overall, we had a nice dinner at Leopold, but I thought the dishes lacked the wow factor that would have pushed my review higher.  SERVICE: I made our reservation on OpenTable, and in the comments box, I notified the staff that we would be celebrating my boyfriend's birthday. I asked them to put a candle in his dessert. Not only did the staff honor my candle request, but they also put a birthday note on the table before we arrived. I was impressed.  Our reservation was originally set for 7 p.m., but my boyfriend got held up at work and asked to go a little later. Around 5:30, I called to see whether I could change the reservation to 7:30, and the receptionist was able to change it for me without any attitude. Very good.  The busboys were quick to remove empty dishes and to wipe down the table.  My main complaint was the time between ordering and receiving our food. Our first two dishes (pierogis and salad) arrived quickly; the second two (mussels and fish) arrived much later, and then one right after the other. I know the servers have little to do with cooking, but a little warning about the delay would have been nice.  DECOR: A cute, cozy spot. Much bigger than it looks from the outside. Good for a date. We sat near the front of the restaurant, and at times there was a draft when the door opened.  Enjoyed our time but won't rush back.

One of the managers at Leopold went to BU. Sadly, she couldn't be there but she did tell the staff to give us a really nice complimentary appetizer tray! It had some pate, some cheese, almonds, and sausage. Everything was a lovely taste of what was to come. I enjoyed a few nice beers (Winterkoninck to start and Ommegang's Rare Vos during dinner). They went really nicely with my brave choice (if I do say so myself) of sweetbreads. Although it was my first time trying sweetbreads, I have to say that I loved the preparation in the salad. All of the ingredients were so flavorful and fresh in the salad. I'd definitely try sweetbreads again after this great introduction!  I tried a bit of my friends' meals too: beef brisket special, duck confit hash, muscles in white wine sauce. Delicious...all of it. And the piece de resistance...dessert. The Black Dog sorbets were so flavorful (chocolate, blood orange, cherry root beer). and the waffle was fluffy and light. The whiskey maple sauce and fig compote really added to it.  Very impressed.

We went on a Monday night around 8:30 and it was really nice and quiet. Our server, Sandra, was spot on with our dinner service.  She explained about how many dishes each person usually orders and how the menu works. We decided to order the poutine,skirt steak and apple-sage pierogi. Sandra suggested that we order the brussels sprouts, as they would go well with what we ordered, so  we did. I haven't ate brussels sprouts since I was a kid and I was a little hesitant at first but once I bit into them they were the highlight of my meal! The poutine was a little heavy but so delicious. We had her leave them on the table and nibbled on them throughout our dinner service. We then got our skirt steak, pierogies and brussels sprouts. My boyfriend and I agreed that the steak was one of the tastiest steaks we had had in a while. It was cooked to perfection, thinly sliced, buttery and tender, yum! The pierogies were also to die for. Throughout our dinner service we were checked on just enough times to see how we were doing and how the food was. Our drinks were refilled and we never had to hunt someone down to get our check. It's rare to get a great, total package outing, so we really appreciate the awesome service from Sandra and the other employees.

2013-02-18,4.0,"Enjoyed our visit to Leopold Saturday night. To address points mostly raised by others first: yes, it did kind of smell like grease; yes the service was a little weird and bossy; yes, there was cold air blowing on us sometimes from the ceiling vent; yes, the grilled bread was pretty well grilled; yes, the sweetbreads were more salad and less sweetbreads (and some of the battered and fried chunks seemed actually to be smoked bacon). Nonetheless, we had a good time.  The boutique vodka from Napa was good. The salad materials were fresh. The sweetbreads were delicious with a cornmeally tooth to the breading. The sliced duck breast with wild mushrooms was tender and tasty. The mussels with spicy sauce were yum and came with a heapin' helpin' of fries. We actually couldn't finish all the fries and bread (though we tried!) Their Winterkoninck was a darkish brew worth savoring and recommending. Our dessert of good-sized scoops of the eggnog and  malted vanilla gelatos was a nice cap to the adventure. Although there are many good restaurants in our city, we are glad we tried Leopold and would surely return. It does kind of have a European atmosphere in a way, especially with the music they played for the first hour or so. Like many places these days, seems like they lie about being busy certain days and times, even to open table (don't know how that works); this particular night they were pretty empty until after 8 (which kept it nice and quiet for normal conversation); so you may want to try being spontaneous or give them a ring just before.",0.996,0.762,0.228,0.01,0.5976399331662489
2013-02-14,4.0,"If you are interested in trying Leopold, sure, continue reading this review.  But also go to their web site and focus on the following: menu; bio of chef Michael Dean Reynolds.  The food is a direct continuation of the farm described there.  It's neat that in a world of farm-to-tablers, there's someone who's actually lived on one.  A farm, not a table.    I started out by taking two good pieces of advice from servers: a red wine whose name escapes me (helpful, I know!) and the winter squash salad.  The salad was what my husband would call ""simple but good.""  I prefer simple, so it was simple AND good, with arugula, farmer's cheese and squash in a Belgian ale vinaigrette.   My main course at Leopold was like ""The Beatles"" by The Beatles.  That is to say, white all over.  I had the pierogi with apples, potatoes, farmer's cheese, creme fraiche, spaghetti squash and sage.  Usually I try to eat the rainbow but this was nevertheless a winner.  The carb and cheese combination was lightened slightly by the apple.  Good choice on a January evening.      Luckily, my husband and I have a shared love of brussels sprouts.  We share them regularly even though I have a record of going beyond the unspoken 50/50 sharing etiquette.  Unluckily, we do not have a shared love of bacon, but luck struck yet again when our waitress offered to serve the bacon on the side.  Thus the dish was poised for perfection, and the only reason it wasn't, in my opinion, was the proportion of sprouts to gouda: too much of the latter.  With all due respect to Wisconsin, Paula Deen and Timer the cheese cowboy, sometimes less is more.     After dinner, we somehow talked ourselves into having room for dessert and shared the Belgian waffle with figs and white chocolate-cherry-allspice gelato.  I liked all these elements more than I anticipated, and they played very well together.  The gelato and figs in particular were wonderful, and I'm usually not crazy about figs or cherry.       The service was good, from beginning to end, including hostess, bartender and waitress.  Approachable but knowledgeable.  One minor point that may or may not fall under service was the fact that we sat in the smaller rear dining room and I faced the back, so I watched a lot of kitchen activity.  It was kind of interesting to see the wheels turning, but it is a different experience than one would have while facing the rest of the pretty dining room.     Overall, a great evening.  It was particularly cozy and suited for a winter dinner but I imagine Leopold can pull off any season.  We'll definitely keep it in mind for the future.",0.9987,0.778,0.217,0.005,0.4408632738419973

2013-02-10,3.0,"Nothing is without flaw. And everything has an off-day. That was my experience with Leopold. The space is beautiful. Love the simplicity and especially love the curtain room dividers. Food-wise, it was a hit or miss for me. As a restaurant week diner, here's my overview: 1) Smoked Salmon Belly Salad with roasted beets & herbed goat cheese dressing. Excellent. Small portions make this preparation ideal as the belly is quite rich. The combination of beets and goats cheese were excellent compliments. 2) White Wine-Steamed Mussels with garlic & petite herbs. Absolutely out of this world! Wow. The taste? Magnifique. There was two hiccups that could have been avoided, but we were definitely compensated for the mistake. One, they had no control over, and that was that I got a mussel that was a bit to fishy and questionable. It just leaves a bad taste in your mouth, but how can they know if advance. The second was an oversight on their part. About 5-6 of my mussels did not open making them inedible. Were they rushing to get our food out? Was the chef needing to go to the bathroom really badly thus rushing the QA? Whatever the case may be, there they were at my table, on my plate. Our table did receive complimentary gelato to compensate. Not too shabby.  Braised Rabbit with green lentils, mission figs, and dandelion greens. This was not my order, but I did have a testing. And I feel it was bland. I didn't hear this feedback from my companions (who were the one that actually ordered it) but that was my interpretation.  3) Belgian Waffle with creme fraiche ice cream, fruit compote & hazelnut crunch. This dessert was also a bit bland for me. Not even so much bland as dry. The waffle/creme proportion was not balanced out and left the dessert lacking. Would I return for a second chance? With this place? Yes. I so want to like them. I don't know why, I just do.",0.9572,0.824,0.117,0.059,0.6147435897435898
2013-02-02,3.0,"My dinner at Leopold was ok.  We walked in on a Saturday night and were seated immediately without a reservation.  The ambiance was classy and hip, with exposed brick behind the bar.  There was a very nice waiting area in front with couches.  The service was spot on, water glasses were filled consistently and our waitress appeared at the right intervals.   The food was mostly hits with one big miss.  I thought it was going to be an innovative take on Belgian cuisine, but it was classic Bistro fare.  We ordered the veal sweetbreads, steak tartare, moules frites and the poutine.  The sweetbreads were covered in an arugula salad with a citrus dressing.  It balanced the fried sweetbreads nicely.  The steak tartare was great, not too caper-y, which most places usually do.  The meat was fresh, not ground too fine, and not stringy.  The breads they served on the side were plentiful but disappointing.  They looked like they were haphazardly thrown together - lightly toasted but tasted like bakery day old bread.  The moules were pretty good -came with a gigantic side of frites and aioli.  The wine sauce was way too salty, even if eaten with bread.  The biggest miss, which was my reason for wanting to go to Leopold in the first place, was the poutine.  It was soggy, the cheese wasn't hot, nor melted, and the gravy was more of a chili than a gravy.  It was also topped with peppers and green onion, and the combination was just off.  The poutine would've been more successful in the classic Montreal style.   All in all, the meal was ok but not a place I'd be rushing to go back to.",0.9878,0.826,0.14,0.034,0.5672619047619047

Arugala salad with squash was not that great. Pierogies with apple and creme fraiche were the highlight of the evening, wish we had ordered two of this perfectly prepared small plate. Duck entree with hash was perfectly cooked and not overly sweet. Brussel sprout flavor was overwhelmed by the watery cheese sauce.  Worst part of our experience was the service.

When we expressed this sentiment we felt very dismissed by our waiter who kept 'forgetting' about our table.

Drinks are fun and tasty, BUT the selection isn't that great. Oh, and I suppose I should mention that my fiance found a paper clip in his cocktail. A freaking paper clip. The server was very apologetic, took that drink off of the tab, and had the chef send us a free scoop of ice cream... but what's done is done. How the hell does a paperclip get into a drink?

So the stage was set, but of course the food should always be the star, and it was.  I was indifferent to both of the Belgian drafts that I tried, as well as the soft pretzel appetizer.  However, everything went up, up, up from there. I ordered the seared whitefish with mustard spaetzle, parsnips, pecans, and short rib vinaigrette.  Genius combinations--delicious, delicious genius.  On the side my wife and I ""shared"" the frites and the brussels sprouts.  By ""shared"" I mean that I greedily devoured most of the frites and our forks dueled over every last morsel of tasty brussels sprout.  The latter are cooked in a little crock with chestnuts, bacon, and gouda, but the waitress graciously offered to bring the bacon on the side since there was only one pork eater at the table.  The Belgian-style frites were absolutely perfect, and although the accompanying samurai sauce was underwhelming, I dipped the frites instead into the creamy goodness left behind in the brussels sprouts crock.  One of my better ideas in recent memory, I must say. Of course we rounded off our meal with dessert:   Belgian waffle with white-chocolate/cherry/allspice gelato, fig-currant compote, and hazelnut crunch.  I typically go for chocolate desserts, but this one sounded brilliant and tasted even better.  It was a superb final note to our excellent meal. Although I ordered Belgian beer, Belgian frites, and a Belgian waffle, the Low Countries influence was overt but not clamorous.  This is thoughtful, modern food, with a few embellished classics sprinkled in, that deeply satisfies.  The handsome room and friendly staff make it taste even better.  I hope to return again soon.",0.9974,0.782,0.193,0.024,0.5690315315315315

The staff are very knowledge and passionate about all things food and drink.I started with a flight of gamet wine and it was just superb and priced so reasonable. The generous pours were enough to sip on all throughout dinner and the price, my goodness, so reasonably priced, it made we wonder if we were in the suburbs of Wisconsin. The portions, although not huge, are ample and ideal for sharing. The steamed mussels are a must as well as the charcouterie board. This assortment of smoked rabbit sausage and other meats with bread and mustard and bleu cheese was perfect enticement for what was to come. The Poutin which is a similar to Canadian cheese fries was a hit at the table. There is something to be said about melted cheese and perfectly seasoned fries, just lovely! I would say I definitely left this place feeling happy and satisfied. The bill was so extremely reasonable and the restaurant inside is warm and inviting.

My husband didn't mind and also didn't want to wait for another 20 minutes for food so he ate the bfast and said it was good.  The biz and gravy needs more duck, less bland gravy, and about 8 minutes added to the cooking time for the biscuits.  Not at all what I had hoped for. Fast forward to the bill.  Although my husband ate the wrong breakfast he was given and the waitress admitted it was HER fault for putting in the wrong order we got NOTHING taken off the bill.   Not even our $3 cup of coffee.  REALLY?  ARE YOU KIDDING ME??  We just spent $50 on brunch, got the wrong entree and they can't comp a $3 cup of coffee for bringing out the wrong dish?

In fact there was only one or two other tables. My friend and I shared the endive apple salad and frites, then had the pierogi and scallops (the ribs weren't on the menu). The frites and samurai sauce were incredible, although the frites were cut very small, kind of like when you get the last of the batch. The perogi was amazing, as were the scallops although I could have eaten twice as many easily (the entree serving was three). We skipped desert which will certainly be on my list for next time.

2012-09-16,4.0,"Wife and I went back here on Friday night as we had made no plans and were looking for a casual restaurant that served good food. Leopold came to mind when I remembered their great Oysters. First off, our server (Sandra) was exceptional and did a great job looking after us for the evening. She made great recommendations and was fun throughout the evening. If she wasn't so busy I would have asked her to pull up a chair and sit with us. We had 6 Oysters to start which were good and quickly disappeared. The Endive and Apple salad seems basic but it one of the best salads I've ever had.The brioche croutons, hazelnuts and grapes were a nice addition to the salad. The buttered Prawns were excellant as well however there were only two prawns on the dish and as it cost $20 should have been a larger portion. The people next to us had the Poutine which they raved about but we had ordered the Frites with samurai sauce and we were not disappointed. Fries are done poorly (or just very basically) in most restaurants however they really packed a punch at Leopold. For our Entrees we had the grilled cover Steak with Mushroom ragout. It was ok but probably the weakest dish of the evening. The steak wasn't great quality and I thought slightly tough. The half Chicken was a great dish that packed flavor and had a great lemon taste from it. The heriloom tomato salad with it was fantastic. We had the Chocolate Pave and the Waffle for our dessert. The Chocolate Pave was great and it was interesting to have it served with sea salt and olive oil. The Waffle looked great but wasn't anywhere near as impressive as the Chocolate Pave.  Just before we left, I went to see the kitchen. It is tiny and it is amazing that they can poduce the great quality food that they do from such a small kitchen.

2012-09-15,4.0,"I've eaten here three times now, and I've really enjoyed it each time.  The food has been excellent, the service has been capable, and the prices have been reasonable. The first time my dining companion and I ordered a number of things and sampled each others dishes.  The food was all very good.  The steak tartar was very good, as was the smoked trout.  I really, really loved the belgian waffle, too.  The second time I was there, I had the belgian waffle again. The most recent visit I had their special Corsican prix fix menu with accompanying wine pairings (a steal at $75). I very much enjoyed each of the four dishes that came with the menu.  There was a salad with jamon iberico wrapped around some greens and 'compressed watermelon' to start, there was a scallop in a wonderful shrimp bisque and tomato confit, there was a huge portion of pork belly, and finally a dish of pulled, braised goat on a feta polenta. Each dish tasted delicious.  The only critique I have is inconsistent portioning.  I love jamon iberico, and the plating was creative, but there was just entirely too much of everything in that dish.  Strange complaint perhaps, but I prefer to finish a meal full - not stuffed.  Then the scallop dish had one scallop, but the pork belly dish had almost twice as much pork belly as typically comes in a dish like that.  It was perfectly cooked and tasted delicious, but pork belly isn't a dish anyone should be filling up on.  Then the scallop dish only came with one scallop.  I'd have been happier with half as much pork belly and double the scallops.  And I suspect other diners would, too.  Even among fans of pork belly, there are limits to how much can be eaten of the fatty and delicious dish. I will say that the wine pairings were perfect.  I often forget to drink my wine with a dish when i really enjoy it, but I made a concerted effort to actually eat and drink them together this time and am very glad I did. Obviously I'm a fan of Leopold - I really like it a lot.  Portioning in a prix fix menu isn't a big problem, but one worth noting.  Service is capable but slightly inconsistent in that it's always been professional, but sometimes the server is cordial and sometimes the server is cold.  I prefer cordial over cold, but either is ok - but as an organization they should try to maintain one or the other for consistency sake.",0.9968,0.791,0.182,0.027,0.5523672161172162

Long version:  we held our team meeting in Chicago, yelped to find a restaurant for dinner.  Leopold's was one of the highest rated and since I had been to Belgium and loved the food I thought why not introduce others to this cuisine.   The manager suggested we go with the fixed menu - since the kitchen is small this would guarantee everyone eats at the same time.

2012-08-31,5.0,"I selected Leopold sight unseen for my 50th birthday dinner. I could not have made a better choice! My friends and I were surprised and pleased by the contemporary, comfortable space; the flawless service; and the hearty but elegant food.  I had been following Leopold's Facebook feed because I heard the menu would be Belgian inspired. My paternal lineage is Belgian and my husband and I were fortunate to be able to visit Belgium for our 20th wedding anniversary. We fell in love with the cuisine of Flanders and Wallonia, but it is not easy to find its like here. There were six of us in our party with very different palates, diets, and food intolerances. Seriously people, we're a tough table... paleo, gluten-free, no fish/seafood, no lettuce, no garlic, no vinegar ... I could go on. No problem for Leopold. No problem at all. Everyone was happy. Some of us shared charcuterie and cheeses to start and were oohing and aahing and doing the happy little food dance in our seats. Do not pass up the charcuterie! It may have been my favorite part of the meal. One of our party ordered the steak tartare and could not stop praising it. For the main course one person ordered fish, but I do not recall the variety. Some ordered the moules frites (of course!) The moules frites were everything they should be and as good as any we had in Belgium; or at Hopleaf for that matter! I had the smoked rabbit. So, so satisfying and delicious!  I had an Orval (or two) with my meal. Abbaye d'Orval (Orval Abbey) is merely 6 miles from the villages of my ancestors, so it is the beer of choice there. But Orval is not easily found in bars and restaurants in the USA. In fact, there is a limited quantity of Orval produced and no plans currently to increase production. The presence of Orval on the beer menu at Leopold very much influenced my decision to dine there. I could not imagine celebrating my 50th without it. In answer to those reviewers lamenting the number of Belgian beers on tap, Orval is (re-)fermented in the bottle and is only made available in bottles. The older the date on the bottle, the better the beer inside; if properly cellared. But back to Leopold... I cannot remember all the desserts, but I do believe some in our party had the waffles. I had the Chocolate Pave. It was the only dish that did not impress me. It was too, too sweet. I really was expecting the best-in-the-world taste of Belgian chocolate, but the chocolate in the desert was masked by sugar. I wish I had ordered the crème fraîche gelato that one of my friends selected. I had just a tiny taste and I still can't forget it. Absolutely wonderful! About the service... my husband and I arrived a little early. The staff invited us to wait in the bar or to sit in the plush chairs at the front of the restaurant. We sat in the plush chairs and the staff promptly brought us water. We were seated immediately after the rest of our party arrived. (Did I mention the dining chairs? I do not believe I have ever been so comfortable at a dining table before. Instantly made me feel relaxed.) The service was courteous, friendly, unobtrusive, and prompt. If you left your seat, a member of the staff magically appeared and refolded your napkin and placed it in your chair. I don't recall this level of service at this price point in a casual setting. We had a bit of trouble spotting Leopold when we arrived. The restaurant is long, but the side facing the street is rather narrow. We knew we had found it when we noticed the green, neon pharmacy sign -- ubiquitous in Belgium -- above the door. I cannot recommend Leopold highly enough and look forward to returning.",0.9963,0.754,0.16,0.085,0.587112554112554

The waitstaff was very accommodating and helpful - friendly and approachable.  We tried a number of the dishes and all were delicious with something for everyone.  Salads were terrific - Endive and Apple was particularly yummy.  Buttered prawns were also very good, and the addition of szechuan peppercorn slaw added a terrific crunch and light note to the dish.  Moules were great as were the frites.  All good so far. These are definitely small plates and good for sharing.  We had 6 dishes for four people, along with a couple of sides and plenty of drinks.  It worked out just great.

It's a modern, sleekly appointed restaurant, with a light, neutral decor, comfortable seating, decent sized tables and a good noise level.  Servers are casually attired, and our waiter was quite knowledgeable about the menu and especially the large beer selection. This is a Belgian-influence restaurant, with many many Belgian beers to choose from (we sampled liberally, and all were delicious, especially a sweet/tart kriek beer).  And of course, this being a Belgian restaurant, we had to have moules frites. Ah, the simple pleasure of good moules frites!  However, at Leopold, you're pleasure could become an embarrasing orgazmic experience, the combo is that good!  The mussels were served in a somewhat thicker broth accented with coconut milk that was absolutely to-die-for!  The shellfish themselves were perfectly cooked, gently steamed open and silky tender.  And this magic potion is served with a generous portion of the most perfect fries I've ever eaten...they knocked Hot Doug's duckfat fries right down to...number two!  Leopold's frites were large cut, long, dark golden crispy on the outside, soft and pillowy fluffy on the inside.  I restrict my simple carb intake generally, but there was no stopping me with these fries...I ate the entire serving, many of them liberally soaked in the amazing broth that came with the mussels.  Take my advice...you MUST have these when you go to Leopold.

I highly recommend Leopold for a romantic date. The lighting is dim, and  perfect for showing off your best assets.

If you have to wait a few minutes, relax on one of the plush armchairs of sofa up front.  For dinner, we started with the Moules in white wine, garlic, petite herbs, butter and dill aioli. They were so delicious, we ate every single last one. Get the grilled bread to soak up the broth. Worth every calorie. I then had the diver scallops with German dumplings and caraway scallop broth. It was very well seasoned and definitely not boring. The dumplings really make this dish. Absolutely delicious. My friend had the pan roasted fluke with crab and asparagus salad and Meyer lemon vinaigrette. It was again very well seasoned, and the asparagus and crab balanced the saltiness of the fish.  For dessert, we went with the citrus panna cotta. It was actually just ok. Tasted like a dreamsicle.  Our server was fantastic. She made some great recommendations, including the 2010, Domaine Faillenc Sainte-Marie, Corbieres, Cinsault. I can't wait to come back.

2012-04-10,5.0,"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago, and I've finally gotten around to writing a review for it.   Leopold's an intimate spot; candles, wood bar, semi-private seating area, and does not have the usual raffle of loud, extensive conversations you'd find at other eateries in the city.   From the beer selection to the main course, and then dessert, there's something new you can pair with your meal that makes dining here a new experience everytime and, with the small plates and shareable apps, Leopold's is great for couples, double dates, and dinner parties. As a fan of lambics, I would recommend Lindemans Faro and the Oud Beersel Gueuze for your drinks.  Otherwise, they also have a full bar and vast beer selection (bottles, trappist, and draft) and as if drinking tap water was too commonplace, they also have a secondary water purifier at the corner of the bar, my my my.... Now to the food: we usually order any combination of the endive/apple salad, the poutine, moule, scallops, grilled cover steak, beet salad, or sweetbreads.  The poutine is a great dish, albeit, a bit salty with the gravy and the cheese curdsl, but in such a sizeable portion that 2 or 3 people can share one.   As a steak and seafood kind of guy, I can speak to tasting some of the scallops and thought they were tasty and sweet, while the steak portioned with the ragout could have been a bigger portion. Meanwhile, the bratwurst plate, looks to be a European presentation, with mustard, a pretzel, and I believe, but don't quote me exactly, saurkraut.   For dessert - if you have room - I would say a must is the belgian waffle and espresso as nice ways to cap off your meal.",0.9631,0.921,0.079,0.0,0.5360303030303031

The food is out of this world.  The steak tartare and the smoked rabbit are out of this world, as is most everything else!  The rabbit and duck rilletes with kriek jelly is another favorite.  And the oyster mignonette has the subtlest hint of raspberry from the lambic. The servie has always been good, the beer list is very complete with a lot of unusual European brews, and the decor is very understated.  We've usually gone earlier in the evening, before 7 pm, and usually can walk in and be seated without a reservation.  It does seem to get busier later.

Tender: ""Oh, well I do a lot of drinking and it's pretty common."" Me: ""NO, *I* do a lot of drinking and this is honestly the first time I've seen this."" Now I can understand if the menu had stated $5 for a gin and tonic, and you ordered a gin on the rocks, that would be extra. But with bourbon/whiskey/scotch, the price should be the price. Especially with scotch, these drinks are more often than not consumed neat or on the rocks. That price should assume a neat or rocks pour. I will not be back here.

2012-03-22,5.0,"When I think of Belgian food, I think of Brussels sprouts. Unfortunately, there were none to be found at Leopold. That is the only thing, however, that made me even mildly sad about dinner in this fantastic little corner of nowhere. ('Nowhere' meaning West Town, in dead-on parallel with River North - which might as well be another planet). We supplemented the Chef's Week three-course with a bunch of other items and ended up with a solid menu of shared plates: charcuterie, a bright champagne-tinged pear-and-greens salad with salty pretzels, an unbelievably tender chunk of short rib with potato cake, roasted herbed vegetables, and a batch of some of the best pierogi and creme fraiche my sad little life has ever known. Will absolutely be back solely based on the food. No question. We wanted to try everything. We like the meat and potatoes and beer experience a lot (the Orval is really a standout on this beer menu, if you need to narrow down the vastness of options a bit) and this totally delivered. The place is quiet, attractively designed, and spotless; the waitstaff is incredibly pleasant and experienced without being too present. Not that we had a lot of conversation to interrupt: whenever food is top-notch, we shut up for a change, and that's exactly what happened here. Silent dining. There's a good amount of rabbit on this menu that makes it feel very Belgian (especially the huge selection of trappist beers), but it's clear this is a culture that LOVES IT SOME PEAS. There are peas everywhere. If you hate peas, do not come here. Peas in every single thing.  Except that fabulous bourbon soaked syrupy ice cream waffle at the end.

The vinaigrette for the salad was heavy on the vinegar, but I like very acidic dressings; the pretzel croutons were awesome. Next up was some super tender braised short rib, pierogies and roasted vegetables.  The short rib was so flavorful, I could've eaten four orders of it easily.  Eating the pierogies with the short rib, I was in meat and potatoes heaven. So what makes this food Belgian? Apparently a lot of peas.  I was surprised at how quiet Leopold was, but I guess it should be expected for a restaurant in the middle of nowhere.  The beer list was fantastic and included a bunch of quality Belgian beers.

2012-02-21,5.0,"Score for Belgian cuisine! Four of us visited Leopold for restaurant week and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  We had an early reservation, so the restaurant wasn't very full, but the atmosphere was really nice even without it bustling full of people.  The decor is light, but comfortable and the space, with the brick behind the bar is very warm.  I'm not sure if it gets busy during the evenings on weekends - it almost looks like there is a lounge area in the front section of the restaurant (perhaps this area is used more like a bar at night?).  In any case, the atmosphere was great - a 5. (note: I didn't get the 'smell' that people are mentioning in reviews - I think the restaurant smelled just fine and I didn't seem to reek afterwards...so, not sure). Aside from the fact that our poor server had to wait for us to order for a while since we didn't pay any attention to the menu at all, he was great.  He was attentive, but not overbearing and he was quite nice (and helped us with our drink selections).  Our food came out at just the right time (and we didn't get in trouble for sharing the restaurant week menu).  A 5 for service. On to the food.  First of all, let me say that I like pretzels.  I'd go so far as to say I love pretzels and this pretzel at Leopold is delicious - simple but good.  The mustard for dipping is flavorful, but not too spicy and also comes plenty to a portion.  The salad was tasty with a zesty dressing.  I had the mussels for my entree and they were very good, perhaps a bit unsalted, but quite delicious.  I would have enjoyed a loaf of bread to dip into my sauce...but in retrospect, I probably didn't need an entire loaf of bread with my dinner!  The waffle dessert - ahhhh - so delicious.  I could have eaten 3 servings had I had enough room.  I also tried the brussel sprouts - yum and the lamb entree which was a special - also yum.  The food was great - aside from using a slightly generous salt next time on the mussels, I give it a 5. Value for restaurant week was good, and a quick look at the regular menu shows that Leopold is on the higher end, but I think still has quite good value.  The side orders were generous and some of the entrees (mussels) came with fries.  I think the salads were a bit small for the normal price, but all in all, good value (a 4).   As for bathrooms....I didn't visit, so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.   I would like to return!  4.5 rounded to 5.",0.9991,0.728,0.254,0.018,0.6297605775866647

Mussels.  Lots of places do mussels.  What's so special about Leopold's?  They have 2 versions.  One is a classic white wine and herb.  This is excellent for when you are looking for the tried and true.  The other version changes, and the ones i've tried have all been fantastic.  The best so far was a green curry version.  It had the requisite heat (subtle in this case) and spices.  What I really liked about it was the added nuance of herbal taste.  It gave the whole dish a freshness that is not usual in a curry.

2011-12-27,5.0,"Leopold is as close to Belgian food as you are gonna get in Chicago. Having traveled around Brussels while in college, it was nice to revisit some of the foods I had tried overseas. We came with a bigger group, so we were able to split a few items.  First of all, make sure you get a pretzel as a side. They are delicious and the mustard will convert any non-mustard lover. We also began with the poutine. What is better than french fries covered in gravy and cheese curds? Nothing. Which bring me to the fries here. Have to be some of the best I have ever eaten. Perfectly crisp and salty, they are highly addictive. We moved onto the pierogis, which were very soft and doughy and simply dressed with roasted squash. We continued our meal with the sausage plate. I loved both of the sausages and thought their flavors were unique and delicious. Not to mention that they were served with another pretzel. Score. To finish the meal off, we split the Belgian waffle that came with a scoop of black dog gelato. The gelato was maple flavored, as was the sauce that accompanied it. Tasted like a dessert version of breakfast.  I also forgot to mention how great the cocktails were here. I had the Foxberry since I love gin. The service was also very friendly and approachable. Just be aware that you may end up waiting a bit for your food since the kitchen is very small. Not a problem for me, since I was able to pace myself between dishes.

Upon entering, I was impressed by the decor and music selection. The drinks were delicious and reminded me of the speakeasy style. I ordered the Autumn Breeze made with New Holland Dutchess Vodka, allspice, and Bordelet Poire cider since I love to be seasonal especially during autumn. The cocktails might be too expensive for some ($11). We ordered the frites made with white wine, garlic, petite herbs, butter, and basil aioli - very delicious. For my entree I ordered the Housemade Perogi (which is the only vegetarian option on the menu) made with farmers cheese, potato, onion, winter squash + leeks. I thought my meal was exquisite and the kind of meal you eat slowly and savor each and every bite. The downfall of the menu was the dessert, the pumpkin cake with toffee. The cake tasted nothing like pumpkin nor was it satisfying. The service is on par where you are constantly asked about your meal or if you need anything. And they were kind enough to let us stay there until the restaurant almost closed. Overall a good time, but I don't think I'll be returning.

Have not had the opportunity to sample any of the menu, but look forward to doing so on our next visit.  Stopped in for some after-dinner drinks and dessert to-go.  Bartenders were very professional yet casual, and one a bit more talkative and friendly than the other.  Sitting at the bar (with immensely comfortable bar stools, I might add) I also noticed all of the staff appeared very professional, but I didn't get any uptight vibe.  Nothing on the cocktail menu especially appealed to me, so I asked if they could make me a rum cocktail.  Without hesitation, I was asked if I wanted something sweet or not.  I was presented with a lovely, delicious concoction that I can only hope can be duplicated next time!   The beer list is what it's all about there, though.  I sampled a few, and liked all but 1.  For a second cocktail, I tried their Elder Pear Cocktail off the menu, which would be Koval Pear Brandy, St. Germain, and Bordelet Poire sparkling cider.  While interesting, it wasn't really my thing.  I got into a discussion with the bartender about what St. Germain was.  She soon brought over a shot glass to sample.  Had dessert to go.  Went with the Bittersweet and  Milk Chocolate Pave.  It was just ok.  Nothing earth shattering.  I do like the chocolate/caramel/sea salt combo, though.  Only one complaint thus far about Leopold.  The night we were there at least, their kitchen ventilation did not seem to be working properly, or else they need to improve it.  The smell of cooking food in the front of the house was overwhelming.  Like fondue restaurant overwhelming...where your clothes and outerwear stink when you get home.   Hopefully it was just a one-time thing.  Otherwise, it's a lovely, comfortable spot.  Look forward to getting back there for some dinner.",0.996,0.751,0.195,0.054,0.5606423611111111

Leopold had been on my list to try for quite some time yet many of my friends, in reading the menu on line, seemed to get hung up on the rabbit and sweet breads always asking me to pick some place else. Did they not also see the braised short rib, the poutine, the sausage and the mussels?   I really wasn't expecting much in terms of decor, for Noble Square tends to be home to restaurants that serve decent food but aren't all that enjoyable to eat it in. But this is not the case with Leopold. The soft neutral tones, dark woods and leather covered bar stools add an air of elegance and class to the space. We sat in the back by the small private room (seats 8) with dark curtains defining the space.  My suggestion?  Ask to sit toward the front of the restaurant as you will be further from the open kitchen in the back. Our server, Scott, was great! He offered up suggestions, suggested we share a few items and was quick with great wine suggestions as they had a couple of special wines that we were not familiar with.  We started with the steak tartare. Absolutely perfect, with the raw egg oozing into the meat and the variety of breads served along side. Next up- we went with the moules and frites (their regular mussels although on the night we were there- they were also offering up a variety with sausage cooked alongside). The mussels were plump and tender and the pepper aioli sauce that came with the fries was terrific. We also ordered a side of the lamb gravy (usually used for the poutine which sounded amazing but it was just too huge of a portion so the gravy was the next best thing) And finally- the short rib served with a heirloom tomato salad which was fork tender and also delicious.  Hard to believe we had room for dessert after splitting all of that that but the Belgian waffle sounded too good to pass up and we were right. The waffle was stacked atop maple gelato and topped with a Bourbon butter sauce! I seriously wanted to lick the plate!  The only downside of the entire evening was that parking is tough in this neighborhood. But you if you are patient, something will open up on Chicago or you can usually find parking by the church located a block south. They did tell me they are thinking about getting valet soon so that should help. Dinner for two with drinks ran about $125.

I thought the location was great.  Looks like there's a nice private dining area on the side if you have a party (probably seats 8-10).  The area in front of the bar looks like it would be a nice lounge area after hours as well (or once your meal goes late).

2011-09-11,3.0,"I agree with another reviewer that the food was generally lacking in flavor.   We started with the escargot tart, which was by far the worst dish we had. It was a flavorless puff pastry topped with flavorless cheese and flavorless escargot, with a side of arugula (hard to mess that up) and ""pickled"" onions also lacking in flavor. I would have thought the escargot would have been cooked in butter, wine, garlic...something with some oomph, since they really take on the flavor of what they're cooked in. These were just flavorless, dried-out, chewy bits. They made me sad. The steak special was pretty good. The steak was seasoned and cooked properly, but the potatoes cooked in pork fat were unexpectedly bland. The smoked rabbit was our favorite, served with delicious mustard spaetzle. The rabbit was not as tender as I would have liked, but was still good. The side of squash was unfortunately another flavorless dish; the squash just didn't have that summer produce burst of flavor.  As other reviewers have commented, the waiter really played up the fact that we shouldn't order too much. We didn't find the dishes to be that satisfying, but to be fair, they are advertised as smaller plates to share. I don't need monster portions, but I don't like to leave hungry, either. I think the waitstaff could just drop the ""don't over order"" schtick they seem to give to every table. We could easily have shared an additional dish from the ""substantial"" portion of the menu.  Beer was okay, but Belgian beers are not really our thing...others may enjoy their selection more. I will say the waiter seemed knowledgeable about the beer list. In general the service we had was good. It wasn't terrible, but we won't be returning. At that price point there are much better places in Chicago.",0.9935,0.778,0.179,0.042,0.6205988455988455

It was on my 'to eat at' list for a while, got chased off by some cray cray reviews and then my better self took ahold of me: if Yanyao and Aurore are fans, I need to get my wow-do-you-work-out? butt in here. Worried about the crowds and buzz, I came in for another geriatric special. Scoff if you will, but dining at 6:30 means that I'll get a table and get to enjoy my meal, rather than hovering over other tables, glaring at the hostess and eating at 11. Plus, it's nice to experience a restaurant as though you were dining in a spacious home, rather than a cramped apartment. Potato, Potatoe. Old fogeyness, out of the way, my friends and I were set for a meal worthy of JCVD.  Your Van Damme-ness, why did you ever leave Belgium? If this food is indicative of the way Belgians throw down, you made a baaad decision to come to the States. I would happily dine and sup on the culinary treasures of this muscley-Brussely land. And, so should you. We started off with a round of Summer Shandys (Shandies?). I just like saying, 'Shandy.' Turns out, I like drinking them as well. The Pils (with apple whiskey, lemonade and ginger) and the Pale (lemonade and rhubarb -- another word I like saying) were absolute hits. I could have drank them all night. Well, in fact, I did. And, speaking of hits, whomever was controlling the playlist that night has seriously good taste. It may have been the nine shandies (shandys?) talking, but a couple of times, I almost stood atop my chair and belted some smooth croons. The music added to the dining experience. And, we experienced. Six Dishes between 3 people doesn't sound like a lot. We didn't finish it all. That's how rich, intoxicating and delicious the kitchen work is. Follow me down a path of gastro-enlightenment. 1.) Rabbit Terrine + Rillet (decadent); 2.) Mussels (from Brussels! Came with a trunk-load of frites. We chose the white wine version and the aromatics were enough to make you sing in four part harmony a la Color Me Badd); 3.) Poutine (oh.Mah.GAH!! More frites, LAMB-SAUSAGE gravy, brunkow cheese curds... we didn't finish. We tried. We stuffed gravy-cheese topped potatoes in our mouths by the fistful, but we couldn't bring down the beast. I would try again anytime); 4.) Sausage plate from B+L (a plate of Euro-encased meats, sweet mustard, sauerkraut, and pretzel; you know you want it); 5.) Onion tart (with cheese and, well, something else I can't quite say; delicate and savory); and 6.) Leigeoise Salad (I am watching my figure, after all; you WILL fight over the vinaigrette). All the while, we were attended to by Jennifer. She joked, checked on us, gave great recommendations, and didn't judge our fatty-ness. We were so stuffed, dessert came in the form of an espresso. I so wanted the pave or a cobbler (or both; let's be real) but my belly was packed full of are-they-French? goodies. And, since we arrived so early, we were able to sit, chat, eat, and graze (again, being real) for a long time without fear that we were going to be kicked out or that the restaurant was closing. If you haven't been to Leopold, you are, most certainly, missing out on a fantastic evening of food and fun. It's Friday. Do you have plans yet?",0.9984,0.813,0.167,0.021,0.5273870573870574

The service was decent and the food we had was really great. The rabbit terrine was alright but the pork spread that accompanied it was amazing. We also had the sausage platter that was very tasty and the escargot tart was pretty okay as well.

2011-07-25,4.0,"Solid four stars: Good food, not as expensive as I was expecting, extensive beer menu, and mediocre service that the management tried to make up for by bringing out a dish on the house.  Our entire dining experience took 3 hours because of absurdly long waits for food.  If the food weren't good I would have been pissed, but we were with friends and had a good time.  The waitress recommended that we order less than we did - glad I didn't listen to her or I would have gone home hungry.  Two small plates would not have cut it for me.  (Do waitresses think that just because I'm thin I have no appetite?)    About the food:  Pretzel heaven.  I'm pining for the currant mustard a day later.  Morel tart and onion tart was delicious and loaded with morels.  They could have charged an arm and a leg for that but didn't.  The frisee salad was salty as hell and I loved it.  The side of summer veggies were so fresh and perfectly seasoned.  Mussels were great.  I asked for bread to soak up the sauce.  French fries were addictive.  Scallops perfectly cooked and accompanying veggies were spot on - not over cooked, fresh, and delicious.  Two in our party ordered mackerel and both swear they substituted another fish.  Neither pieces tasted anything like mackerel - they were so mild and sweet, hardly salty at all.  My husband is a mackerel addict and has eaten it prepared a slew of different ways.  He was disappointed as was our friend.  We asked to be sure it was mackerel and why it didn't have the strong flavor mackerel usually has but no waiters could answer our question.   About the service: I'm a bit hard of hearing and this place is extremely noisy. That combined with the fact that the air conditioning duct was raining condensation on our table and heads, we asked to be moved outside.  After 20 minutes an outside table opened up and we were reseated.  A new waiter brought out two of our 8 dishes and then never came back.  Then we told him we had more dishes in our order and he just didn't get it.  Then 20 minutes later he realized that we had an entire order that our original waitress never told him about and he hadn't put in.  So they gave us scallops on the house, which were extremely tasty.   The outdoor tables are really too small for eating at and are more for drinks.  After 45-minutes of juggling plates on our laps and putting our drinking glasses on the ground, they finally brought over a second table for us.",0.9955,0.764,0.168,0.068,0.5408354377104377

It was three of us and we ordered 2 plates each (plates are small but sharable), so we tried lots of things. Again, nice and tasty but nothing to rave about. It is obvious that the chef has some talent but no formal training.  But my biggest complaint was the most outrageously rude waiter I've ever seen. He actually said- What am I your piece of meat? I had no idea where that came from other than a table of 4 men next to us was friendly with him and perhaps made him feel that way. He actually commented on my statement about their Belgian waffle (tastes like french toast)- he said that my comments about it are the stupidest thing he's ever heard, he said- what are you in IHOP? (he didn't know that I've see far better restaurants than this one), and could care less that I was not speaking to him at all. He kept coming up and saying the most disgusting things and then said that he knows that he's the most sarcastic rudest person in the world and most people don't get him. What? Who the f.... cares what a waiter thinks unless you ask him for food recommendations? I later called the manager and after having asked me what I would like for  me to return (which I declined- no way I am returning there), he said- did you call to vent? What?

2011-07-10,4.0,"So we've been following these guys on Twitter for awhile and never thought much about eating there. After all,  the reviews we read point to a Belgian influence; well we've been to Belgium and they can keep their food. Just give us their beer.  So when we saw Leopold as we wandered down Chicago St, looking for trouble, we thought, what the hell, why not. We were delightfully surprised. The food was excellent.  We started with the steak tartare, which is the house specialty. The serving was a nice size for us to share as an appetizer. Served with a frisee salad and Chef's toast, this could be the best steak tartare we've ever had and we've had our fair share of steak tartare over the years. We highly recommend it.   For our entrees, L went with the smoked mackerel, which was served with a beet salad with a horseradish sauce. T opted for the Leopold sausage entree, which came with sauerkraut and a pretzel, along with Bavarian sweet mustard. The dish had two different sausages, a boudin blanc, and a  weisswurst. T preferred the boudin blanc. For sides, L ordered the summer squash gratin while T opted for the ""smout"" aka ""pork butter.""  As our waiter explained it, or more appropriately, what T heard, it's rendered fat from pork belly mixed with something to give it a porky, fatty, buttery flavor.  T was in heaven, pork, fat, butter...mmmmmmm. Give it a try.  We also highly recommend Leopold's Summer Shandy menu, concocted behind the bar. Our favorite was the Pils, made with Pilsner beer, apple whiskey, lemonade and ginger.  For dessert, we opted to split the bittersweet chocolate pave. Although T is not a chocolate person, L is and she very much enjoyed it. You remember the restaurant scene from Harry Met Sally? Yeah you know what we're talking about. ""I'll have what she's having."" It was that good.

It was interesting that they dressed the frisee salad with the whole grain mustard, a nice element of texture with the tartare. Rabbit Terrine & Rillette: very tasty, we both enjoyed it! Poutine: I should point out that this was the reason we came. My fiance is Canadian and loves his poutine. We have tried all the ones they offer in the city. Overall, it was okay but it has so much potential. However, the fries were oversalted. They don't need to salt them separately because there is enough salt between the gravy and the cheese. Speaking of, there wasn't enough of the gravy and curds. We actually ordered a side of gravy and curds and finished off the dish. The gravy tasted the most similar to ones I have tried in Canada, but watch out for the salt!

Very warm, modern, yet cozy and inviting.  The service was friendly although not terribly helpful.  Belgian beer selection was amazing, they were all good, but stay away from their French champagne - had a weird aftertaste.   As for food, some were good, some were not. My favorites were fries and sausages.  Mediocre were pierogis (chewy dough, but too carb-y, also 5 for $10 is kinda expensive), mussels (flesh didn't taste fresh, broth was pretty ordinary), pretzels (just a big piece of bread with salty exterior), and asparagus.  Their worst surprisingly was the poutine (fries with gravy and cheese curds over it), which wasy wayyy too salty. One of my friends LOVES salty foods but even he couldn't appreciate it.  I'm glad I tried this place out but maybe I'll go back just for the beer.  The food wasn't all that impressive and it's not worth the money.",0.9616,0.668,0.216,0.116,0.5985333333333333
2011-04-25,4.0,"First, let me just say I'm a huge fan of their design aesthetic; that might actually sway my review a touch, only because I am such a visual person.  We were lucky enough to waltz in early on a Saturday night and skip the wait-bonus points for Leopold! Ironically enough, they've started taking reservations which is a HUGE plus in my book.  Service was average, being that the place was only about 1/4 full and yet our server couldn't be bothered to stop by every 20 minutes. It took quite a bit of time to even put in our drink order--I guess the guy was dealing with a stereo crisis....whatever that may be. While i'm on the topics of drinks, my beau was delighted with all the Belgium beer, go figure! Me, on the other hand, a sparkling fanatic, was a little disappointed with their ONE...yes, ONE...selection. Negative points for that!  Food was kind of all over the board with three categories: WINNERS, LOSERS, and FUGGATABOUTITS.  Winners:  -The smoked rabbit with mustard spaetzle was to die for. A standout was the spaetzle, who knew carby little pieces of heaven could be so complementary!  -The duck egg salad, perfect, light and refreshing!  -The mousse! Yes, it's truly amazing as everyone says. Perfect slightly grainy texture with a hint of hazelnut.  Losers:  -The seared scallops. Nothing about this dish was good, but nothing was absolutely horrifying. The scallops were bland, under seasoned and the bed of lentils it sits on top of doesn't lend it self to be compatible for texture. I would even venture to say our lentils were slightly undercooked. Not al dente, but more crunchy than I prefer. I would have sent this dish back, if our server had bothered to stop by and ask how it was.  -The pretzel. Sadly enough, our pretzel was microwaved. I hate that restaurants think that they can *sneak* that one by you. It's soggy, tough and slightly wet on the bottom. GROSS! Either don't heat it up at all, or stick it in a warmer for a few minutes.  FUGGATABOUTITS:  -The pountine. I'm sorry to say it. The dish was WAAAAAAAAAYYY oversalted.  Even cheese curds can't save this one! -The Belgium waffle, skip it! Not worth the calories or the money.  The waffle tasted fried and the gelato that it came with was weak sauce.  Additionally, the toppings tasted straight up like smuckers. All in all, our bill came out to $171 plus tax. It's a tad on the pricey side for what you receive, but I guess that's run of the mill for new trendy places in this area.",0.772,0.803,0.114,0.083,0.5594242424242424

There are too many amazing restaurants in Chicago to spend your time or money at Leopold.  I made a reservation for four on a Saturday night.  After our dates paid the relatively sizable bill for a very mediocre meal, we were relaxing finishing up our after dinner cocktails and coffee.  Not two minutes after the bill was paid, our server informed us that they were going to ""need us to relocate to the bar"". This was not a request.   We were at the table for under two hours.  We were not offered to be comp'ed a drink at the bar or any form of courtesy- just told to leave as if we sat down at the table without permission.  As a local foodie who lives in the area, I can tell you even if this place is convenient: I won't be back.  Get some manners Leopold!!! Not that it matters after that stunt but the food was nothing I would choose to spend the money on again.  The scallops were not offensive but unremarkable and the accompanying lentils were mushy and salty. The steak tartar was quite delicious if not a bit on the salty side.  The short ribs were mostly fat and borderline mushy. The french fries and aioli were tasty but the real flavor was at the bottom.  The cheese plate was unimpressive- two tiny lumps of cheese heralded as a ""cheese plate"" is laughable.  The mussels were not offensive- nice size and the sauce (although nothing to revisit) was pleasant.  The oysters were very, very tiny. Nothing here is worth the money or the attitude. Although our server himself was polite until the ""relocation"" which I am pretty certain was forced on him by his manager. All and all I was a little embarrassed that I  recommended this place for dinner to two out of town guests- being kicked out of our seats was just the cherry on top of this mediocre sundae.

Service is right, the beer list is good (even if the bubbles on draft are a little steep price-wise), the atmosphere is lovely and the food is spot on. My favorite: - the mussels with beer, ramps and jaw served with fries and a caramelized onion aioli: one of the best mussel dish around. The jaw meat is the real highlight - and don't worry if it makes you freak out, it's cut lardon style and it tastes just like it. You'll have a hard time to decide whether you want to dip your fries in the aioli or the mussels sauce. - the duck egg salad accompanied by bacon, potatoes, frisée and a delicious mustardy vinaigrette: sounds simple and boring but it is not. I only had one bite - the 'perfect bite' - and was swooning over it all night long. It's salty and rich, offering interesting contrasts in textures and temperatures. A real earthy symphony. I want to come back for this salad alone, and I am usually not a salad chick. Groups of 4 or more: request your chef table.

And since the waiting area was so nice and comfortable at Leopold, we said screw it - we're keeping our business with them for the night. Ambiance was nice, rustic yet modern and not pretentious in the least. Service was great, especially the server in the waiting are - he was super friendly and helpful. Food was pretty good - although like every new restaurant they ""encourage you to share""...entrees were not really appropriate for sharing, apps of course were. The Putin is a must try - my husband is from Montreal so he loves Putin, and Leopold's take on it was classy yet still absolutely delish. Very flavorful, the gravy wasn't thick at all so it didn't overwhelm, spices were perfect, and the cheese curds were a great touch (although I wanted more of them!). Mussels got good reviews from the two that ate them, and they certainly smelled very good. My smoked rabbit was supposed to be one of their signature dishes, and it was good, but I wouldn't order again - it was very chewy which I suppose is indicative of rabbit. The beef shortribs though were so tender they you could cut with your fork, for sure the standout entree of the evening (although the potato/pea mash side dish didn't look too appetizing). For dessert we tried both the Belgium waffle and the chocolate mousse - the mousse is truly the best I've ever had. Instead of being light, fluffy and airy, it was rich, and velvety smooth - thicker and silkier than traditional mousse like it had sour cream or something in it.

The food actually ranked the last... how do you figure, right?  The steak tartare and salad were good.  Didn't wow me, but were solid. Then the entrees: smoked rabbit with spaetzel was very good, it's what i would think of when I imagine dining in a Belgian bistro would feel like.  So many people mentioned the cassoulet so we ordered it too, but it was underwhelming.  The bread crumbs kind of masked everything and I really didn't like it.   So I think maybe we got the wrong dishes?  Next time, I will get the poutine fries, mussels and short ribs. For dessert, we ordered coffee which came in a small french press, really good coffee, and belgian waffles which came with a scoop of black dog gelato.  I enjoyed the dessert but I don't think it called for much work on their part... how hard is it to make a waffle and put a scoop of gelato from down the street.   Yes, we were lured in by the hype.  And we enjoyed our experience while we were there, but will we go back?  50/50.",0.9895,0.799,0.174,0.027,0.4783706816059757

Skip:  The cassoulet.  It came in a cast iron pan overflowing with white beans and very little meat (rabbit and pork belly).  The brats in the dish were oddly placed, like an afterthought of something to toss in because the dish looked like a plate of beans without them.  No flavor really stuck out from this dish.   The service is exemplary (Drew is fantastic), the decor was comforting and not over the top, great music, and all around great menu.  Enjoy!",0.9977,0.792,0.179,0.029,0.5311462842712843

2011-04-03,3.0,"Leopold gets the distinction of being my first review from the new neighborhood. It was a great pick for many reasons: my mother lives in the Netherlands currently (right next door to Belgium) where the cuisine gets inspiration, it's close to our new apartment, and the best reason is that Leopold is located in the old ""Relax Lounge"" space but still has the neon green glowing sign outside. Why that's important is that Erica and I had been the Relax when Top Chef Dale Levitski did impromptu dinners Wednesday night before he landed at Sprout. That was fun.   I was impressed with the decor and setting - very clean and modern with nice wood accents throughout. The main bar from Relax did not move and takes up a large portion of the front room. However, that makes sense given how many great beers and wines they have on the list. If the alcohol list appears overwhelming, the food menu if very approachable. I appreciate that you have one page with a list of options and no pre-set courses. There are oysters, scallops, sausages, cassoulet, rabbit, cheese, and other nice options from the region. Most would call it ""farmers' food"" since everything but the fish is made or found on a farm with relatively simple preparation.  We (Erica, and our first time with friends Brad and Kate) started with three small plates: mixed greens, pierogi and a giant pretzel. I liked the mixed greens as a fresh start to the meal, but our favorite touch was the gouda cheese croquette. The large pretzel was very large but awesome. It was almost more like bread texture than soft pretzel texture and that was a good thing. The currant mustard served was delicious. Our least favorite of the three were the pierogis. It seemed like they were missing an extra boost of flavor - butter, brown sugar, sauce, just a little something extra. Like most restaurants these days Leopold suggests sharing many of the plates. We started with three small, and only went with four large plates - effectively ignoring the ""sharing"" concept and ordering as usual. Of course we did share with each other, but not in the intended way. I was also surprised that they suggest sharing because the presentation is beautiful and looks like for one person. Our four dishes were beef shortrib (a smallish dish), scallops (with caramelized endive, candied walnuts, bacon, port poached pear and crispy pumpernickel), the cassoulet (confit rabbit, braised pork belly, german brat, cannellini beans and breadcrumb crust) and I ordered a seafood special with arctic char and mussels. Unfortunately the main feeling of our larger dishes was underwhelmed. Erica's beef short rib was fantastic and was almost ordered twice. Kate had the scallops (only three) which were nice but not a very complete dish. Brad's cassoulet was designed as a large dish and it certainly was not finished. We picked out all the good meat chunks, but you have to love beans to finish the entire cassoulet solo. I don't love cassoulet but again, between meat bites was uninspiring. My fish dish was similar. The arctic char was cooked well and the taste was very mild, but also a little boring. The mussels were tasty and were passed around the table quickly.  Finally, the dessert menu came around and we couldn't help ourselves to stay disciplined. The carrot cake, cookie and belgian waffle were ordered. Like the main dishes, it seemed like each dish was missing a kick of flavor. With the desserts it was probably sugar or sweetness. The waffle was our favorite but should have powdered sugar or something more than the fruit and scoop of gelato. We loved the gelato served with the carrot cake and waffle, but that should not surprise since it came from down the street at Black Dog Gelato.  I liked Leopold, especially the concept, decor, service and great neighborhood feel. I want to like it more though if it served a tad more flavorful food. It's only been open since New Years and could still be working out some execution kinks in the system since the menu does not need changing. I hope they succeed because now that I live close by, it'd be a great place to add to the roster.",0.9996,0.733,0.237,0.03,0.563426396055262

Our expectations were high. Got a table quickly at 5:30PM. Around 6:30PM the place was jammed and people had to wait for a table. They have a nice clean modern decor with 3 small couches in the front for waiting/drinking, a nice little touch. The room is long and tight, so the tables are close together. Lighting was dim. Conversation is a little difficult. Got loud quickly. The crowd was young and hip. Service was nice and friendly. Cleanliness: Chipped water glass on edge(dangerous) and dirty fork. Both quickly replaced. But the dim lighting made both difficult to catch. The food : ""MIXED GREENS"" BIG ED'S GOUDA CHEESE CROQUETTE, PEAR, MALT VINAIGRETTE $7 On the menu and at the price of $7, this sounded like a main dish of vegetables or ""mixed greens'. What it is, is a small salad. A very small salad that tasted salty, sweet, and sour all at once. It was an overpriced dish that tried too many flavors that clashed with each other and failed to please. ""POUTINE DE MERGUEZ ""  HAND CUT FRIES with LAMB SAUSAGE GRAVY, CHEESE CURDS $11 This was OK. Needed a little more seasoning. There was a nice amount of fries, but the Lamb Gravy was stingy. Half way done with the fries, all the gravy was gone. The fries were good, but $11 for fries? Eh. ""MOULES + FRITES"" (Mussles and Fries) MADRAS CURRY Mussels with  ONION AIOLI fries $13 This is what we came for. The smell was divine and the presentation was nice. Portion size was OK. The taste was that of a spoiled piece of seafood that died on a pier and spent two weeks baking on the sun before it was stepped on by a sea gull. OMG. I had that taste of rotten mussels in my mouth all night and had to go home and rinse it out with a can of Mountain Dew and then I had to rinse the taste of Mountain Dew out with a can of Coke a Cola. The manager came quickly after we told the waitress. He apologized and that was nice and professional, but then he added, ""I'm sorry the dish wasn't to your 'taste' "" I was annoyed at his comment, but I didn't say anything.

""SLAGEL FARM CASSOULET"" CONFIT RABBIT, BRAISED PORK BELLY, GERMAN BRAT, CANNELLINI BEANS, BREADCRUMB CRUST   $19 OK for $19 and based on the above menu description, I expected a big plate. What we got was HALF of a 4 inch German Brat slightly over grilled, two matchbox sized pieces of badly burned pork belly, one piece was all fat, one rabbit leg with about three bites of meat on it and a plate of slightly undercooked Cannelloni Beans.  This dish was bad all over. The dish had no flavor because the meat was cooked separately from the beans. The meat was grilled to death. I was picking burnt meat out of my beans trying to salvage something for my $19. And did I mention HALF of of a 4 inch brat and two burnt matchbox sized pork fat for $19? WTH. Needless to say, I should have paid more attention to the negative/lukewarm reviews of this place on Yelp. The service was good, decor and atmosphere was nice, but the food was over priced and poorly executed. After spending $70, I left with the nasty taste of spoiled mussel, hungry and disappointed.

2011-02-27,2.0,"I suppose a Belgium place named for a king should make us think of a regal experience.  Too bad that Leopold II helped to oversee the raping of the entire continent of Africa, that should have been my first hint to keep on walking. The front of the house was very friendly and it was nice to have someone take our coats right away.  We were seated quickly and the waiter was prompt.  The menu looked very similar to everything that is so popular in the dining scene, which is fine with me.  The problems came in the execution of the dishes. The Pretzel: A very good pretzel with great mustard.  Could have used some more salt, but was the highlight of the meal...yes the pretzel was the highlight of the meal. Frites: Leopold had two aiolis available that night: curry and caramelized onion.  We attempted to get a basic aioli since neither choice appealed to my companion.  The fries that were delivered where not salted at all.  They were not the worst I have had, but they were a bit soggy and really needed salt.  No worry, but wait there is no salt or pepper on the table.  At this point we finally found out that they could not offer us a regular aioli or mayonnaise.  The waiter said that he could bring some ketchup, but that wouldn't be ""Brussels style""  You know what they do have in Brussels?  Plain mayo for my fries.  Epic fail when the only two things Belgium cuisine is known for is Fries and Waffles. Scallops:  The scallops were cooked properly and tasted great.  The side of greens, candied walnuts, and bacon.  Hard to tell when the bacon pieces were tiny and the walnuts were not candied. Mustard Spaetzle: No flavor of mustard whatsoever.  To be fair this was a side for another dish that they brought us when asked because I liked the mustard for pretzel so much.  It was not a bad dish at all, I just don't know where the mustard went. Cassoulet:  I read the proteins in this dish and was a little intrigued so I went for it.  Too bad it didn't work out together.  If this was just a rabbit cassoulet it would have been very good.  The half a bratwurst and pork belly?  Completely un-needed.  The brat was not made on sight and was not good at all, the pork belly pieces were good, but did not work with the other items on the plate.   The redeeming part of the review was the fact that they got me a side of something that I really wanted to try and then took it off of the bill because they were unable to provide plain aioli.  The front of the house was very nice and prompt.  I hope they can get it together in the future, but with a name like that and the eurotrash techno playing I won't be trying it again.",0.9812,0.822,0.115,0.063,0.5410797720797722
2011-02-26,4.0,"I've wanted to try Leopold since noticing they were finally open after a recent dinner at Green Zebra. We finally got around to it last night for a quick drink and bite after work. It wasn't a perfect experience, but they got enough right that I'll round it up to 4 stars. They're still figuring some things out, but I'm pretty confident that they'll work the kinks out in the near future. The food? We only sampled a few items -- the soft pretzel, the smoked rabbit, and the scallops -- along with cocktails. The pretzel was the perfect comfort food for the end of a long work week. The scallops were forgettable and a tad on the salty side, but the rabbit was truly worth the effort it took to pry the meat from the bone. Served atop spaetzle, it was perfectly seasoned and had just the right hint of smokiness that wasn't overpowering. The atmosphere? Louder than it should be. There's nothing on the walls, and no curtains or fabric to soak up some of the sound bouncing around. Our server struggled to hear us over the noise. On top of that, the table next to us (who appeared to be pre-partying for an evening at Beauty Bar) was practically on top of us, so we were a little cozier than we had expected to be. We needed to decompress a little bit after we left, which I'm not sure was the intention of the restaurant. When I go back in a few months, I'd love to see signs of improvement in the noise level, and I wouldn't miss the scallop dish, either. But mark my words, I will be back.

First, the decor and ambiance could be better...except for the two stained glass panels behind the hostess stand, I felt that any restaurant could plop in there and it would work!  Boring and barren.  I'd like to see something on the walls... The first course out was our oysters.  The Kusshi oysters themselves were fabulous.  Meaty, clean and a wonderful brininess.  The lambic mignonette didn't really add too much for me.  I would have been happy with a lemon wedge or nothing at all. At this point I ordered an Ommegang Tripel Perfection.  Good choice!   Next came the moules and frites.  We did the curry and cream application.  They were pretty solid and I have to say the aioli was ridiculously good.  Loved my beer with this.  So here we are after the starters.  If this was the end of my meal, we would have been at a 4 star review... I love offal meat.  All of it.  A lot.  I believe it should be punishable by law to screw up offals.  That being said... The veal sweetbreads came out over salted and over cooked.  I am no stranger to salt so when I say something is salty, it is.  Holy crap.  And the texture...where was the creamy softness I love?  Replaced with a sponge.  However, the mushrooms, chestnuts and sunshoke puree perfectly balanced it because they had no seasoning!  I even thought that perhaps after the saltiness, my taste buds were off and came back to it.  Nope.  Bland bland bland.  I felt that if I didn't say something it would be a disservice.  Our waitress did come back with an offer from Chef for another but we declined. Scallops.  They were seared to hell on one side.  So much that is was like another crust and not the caramelization it should be.  I actually never have seen anything like it.  The endive accompaniment was really nicely done.  As a whole, not terrible but it could use a little work being more harmonious (and searing the scallop better).

Then for the mains we had the smoked rabbit with spaetzle, the root veggies, and the scallops. Hello, heavy food. The rabbit was good, but the spaetzle was too salty to eat. Scallops were average, and veggies were ok, but the food all sort of tasted the same--heavy yet not terribly filling.  Hoping that the dessert would redeem the meal, we ordered the Belgian waffle with sour cherries and Black Dog Vanilla gelato. Ok, yum on the cherries and ice cream, but the waffle tasted burnt!!  To add to my annoyance, the waiter needed to bring it down a notch or two--there is such a thing as being over-attentive, and his energy didn't match the place's laid back vibe.

I hate putting up with lousy service because I like great tasting food, and I feel like that's the norm rather than the exception these days.

The wait staff repeatedly tried to remove the frites from our table after the mussels were gone, which i was not going to allow because they were delicious and I wanted to finish them. We then split the seared diver scallops. They were good but there were 4 small scallops and we could have eaten many more. Last we split the veal sweetbreads, which were promised to be pancreatic and so better than what we might be used to, but my friend found them disgusting and I just thought they were chewy and off.

The host staff is fantastic and very courteous in making sure you get comfortable as you await your table. Moving onto the dining experience. Where we sat it seemed a bit noisy (thought might be because we were near the kitchen and bar), but nonetheless lively. Our waiter was very nice and made very delicious suggestions. The pretzel was delicious and a must because of the dipping sauce, and the scallops were absolutely delectable with the sweet and savory flavors from the honey-cured bacon found. The rabbit was okay, but whatever you do, save room for dessert as the Belgian waffle served with Black Dog gelato was simple yet oh-so-delicious.

2011-01-28,4.0,"A few weeks after dining at Leopold and I haven't been able to stop thinking about one thing: braised endive. Fact: I once lived in Belgium. When I was a teeny tiny little Chinese girl, I had the privilege of residing there between the ages of 2 and 7. Granted, such a tiny person really doesn't have much of a well-developed palate at all but upon future visits as an older teenager I learned that I loved a few things: super briny shrimp mayo baguette sandwiches, sausages and applesauce together, Neuhaus chocolates and my godmother's Christmas Buche de Noel. One of the things I did not like at all? Braised endive. Bitter = no thanks. So imagine my surprise when we fast forward a few years and I am sitting in Leopold, curious about the braised endive. How Belgian! How rare to find it on menus as a side! It comes out in a little cast iron pot and upon eating it, I exclaim that it is a revelation! By now, I have come to appreciate the bitterness of endive - I actually like it. Now braise it to soften up the leaves and the smother it in a rich, creamy cheese sauce and serve it in a tiny pot. Words can't even describe. I will honestly say, that I would rather eat this side than mac & cheese. The comfort and satisfaction of a warm cheesy dish... made with a vegetable! Anyway, endive ranting aside (oh! the braised endive on the scallop dish is different and also fantastic), I had a really lovely time here. All our dishes were a delight. The smoked rabbit and mustard spaetzle dish introduced me to my first bites of rabbit (I know right? A food that Yanyao has not eaten before... shocking). The poutine is a giant wok (?) of carby, heart-clogging goodness. Do not miss out on the soft pretzel from La Farine. Do not miss out on the scallops. Actually, I don't think you could go wrong with much here.* I really admired the service, especially as our visit was when they were without liquor license. If you did not bring a bottle, you could order from the 2 local wine stores and get it delivered to the restaurant. Now that they have their liquor license, I will be returning as I had a complete brain fart and did not order the mussels. Looking forward to many visits. I really like this neighborhood! *I have to say, that the waffle on the dessert menu is a no-no. I am an a**hole when it comes to judging Belgian waffles. The kind I am used to eating, have the consistency of a cake doughnut and have a caramelized sugar coating on them. These are the type you frequently by at waffle stands in Belgium. Most waffles that I have been served under the guise of being ""Belgian"" are not Belgian. This waffle is not what I was hoping it to be, BUT as a waffle, was pretty good, especially with the apricot preserves.",0.9955,0.789,0.154,0.056,0.5213809523809523

They hadn't gotten their liquor license yet, but they dutifully provided us with menus from both Noble Grape and Lush, mentioning that both were even willing to deliver.  Since we like to peruse wine selections (and do not like to make cashiers from wine shops run down the street in the freezing cold!), we ran over and picked up our own bottle.

It is obvious that there is a skilled hand in the kitchen at Leopold; everything that we ordered was amazing and I'm sure that the entire menu is as well.  There are a few items that really stood out and that I keep thinking about a few days later, the rabbit and the lamb poutine.  This was the first time that I actually enjoyed rabbit.  Perhaps because this time it was made by somebody talented and not by my crazy old granduncle.  A pleasant surprise, smoky and delicious.  It is served with a mountain of mustard spaetzle, easily making it one of the largest items on the menu.   The poutine was also a clean break from a tradition of heart-clogging awfulness.  Last time I had this stuff was about a decade ago at a BK in Windsor, ON and it was horrible.  Let's just say that there have been some major breakthroughs in poutine technology since then, because Leopold's Poutine de Merguez (hand cut fries, lamb sausage gravy, farmer's cheese curds) is brilliant.  The lamb sausage gravy is opulent, spice laden, and will certainly inspire a dozen more restaurants in Chicago to do poutine. Leopold is sure to be a hype-machine this year, and unlike some other aggrandized new Chicago restaurants, the food is actually amazing and the atmosphere is tranquil.  It is much more comfortable and delicious than, say, a cramped Michigan Avenue wannabe-snout-to-tail-ery.

Note: the restaurant is BYOB right now and they offered to have Lush deliver us some wine!",0.9721,0.739,0.243,0.018,0.5128942486085343

Okay, I'll have to remove any positive influence from my BYOB  addition to the dinner since it sounds like this feature will soon be gone, but the sweetbreads and smoked rabbit were phenomenal!!!! My mouth is watering this very moment just thinking about it!  We also had the mussels and the braised short rib, both of which would be fine options, as well, but the sweetbreads and rabbit were very memorable. For dessert, we had all three current offerings...no complaints on any: a really generous serving of thick and creamy chocolate mousse, a crispy Belgian dessert waffle, and some sort of poached or baked apple (sorry, I think I was drunk by this point)... I'm looking forward to going back again. Two thumbs up!!!",0.921,0.822,0.138,0.04,0.5232620320855614

Here's what happened.  I read a few killer reviews of this place and thought that maaaaybe this was my chance to be a ""first-mover.""  So I moseyed my way over to Leopold for some ""dinner.""   What ensued was pure, unadulterated deliciousness.  The pretzel was amazing, as was the smoked rabbit (yep, you heard me) and the sweetbreads.  Oh, and the salad, and the steak tartare.  Kind of a deconstructed steak tartare come to think of it.  And...yep, that was ""our entire order.""   Other best part: suuuuper nice people.  Nothing is more horrible than hosts and servers w attitude.  These folks were soooo nice.  In one month, it will be impossible to get a reservation here.   But Ive already been!  Neaner, neaner.",0.859,0.765,0.155,0.08,0.6821428571428572
2011-01-09,3.0,"I went here with my girlfriend five days after opening, and we chose from a limited menu due to the fact that they had sold out of several of the more popular items.  Overall, most of what we had was good, but didn't knock our socks off.  I found the menu to be similar to the menu at Hopleaf, although french fry heavy.  The smoked rabbit was very tasty and smoky, but also very dry and a little tough.  The best thing about the experience was the service.  Our server was friendly and genuine.  Less impressive was the decor.  The ambiance is pleasant, but also safe and somewhat generic feeling.  We felt it could really be improved if the large blank panels on the walls were replaced with artwork, and the light fixtures upgraded.  It is BYOB for the time being, which I appreciated.  Perhaps they will improve with time, but with all of the excellent choices in the city, it may be a little while before I make my way back to Leopold.",0.993,0.761,0.225,0.014,0.42235791090629793
2011-01-07,5.0,"What a fantastic addition to the Noble Square neighborhood. I've been there twice and for a new place the service is excellent, as well as the cuisine... The mussels, oysters, scallops were all awesome. Currently, they are BYOB and we got our wine and beer from the Noble Grape a few doors down. I will be back when they get their license.",0.9612,0.727,0.273,0.0,0.5943434343434343
2011-01-06,5.0,"What a great addition to our neighborhood!  Great menu, on the smaller side. We had the rabbit (really really good and filling!) and 3 out of the 4 sides. The pretzel was pretty much the most addicting thing I've ever encountered and our server mentioned they make them for the restaurant from the bakery across the street (La Famila bakery I think??) We also had 4 oysters and the french fries which were also very good. All in all a delicious meal and since it's BYOB for like another week it came in under 75 bones for 3 people.  The wine stores up the street will run down a bottle for you at no charge for now, but I'm excited to see what kinds of drinks they will feature on the menu!  Decor was great too and the desserts looked so delicious but I couldn't eat another thing. I will be back!",0.9821,0.802,0.189,0.01,0.5912592592592593
