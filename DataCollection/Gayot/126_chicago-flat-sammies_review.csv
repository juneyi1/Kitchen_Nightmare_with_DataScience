2011-12-11,4.0,"I love the cracker thin pizza here and I love the extra topping of tomato sauce rather than the cheese. It's something different and I like their sandwiches, I think they have better flatbread compare to Cosi.",0.93,0.678,0.322,0.0,0.5416666666666667
2010-04-26,4.0,"I am surprised this place got such mediocre reviews considering i thought it was quite delicious. The sammies were hot, flat (ah haha ...) and full of meaty, juicy and melty cheese and veggies. They come in a basket and the ordering process is easy .. once you're able to choose a sandwich.  The potato chips aren't bad either although I'm not really a huge fan of potato chips to begin with. They give you quite a bit of food here so after the first half of the sandwich I was already pretty full but since I was a pig out tourist, I decided to finish the rest anyway. Yum. I thought this place was reasonably priced, close to downtown areas and very tasty. I would come back here for a flat sammie anytime!",0.7929,0.88,0.095,0.025,0.56625
2009-05-01,2.0,"Flat Sammy's is an okay restaurant right off of Michigan Avenue. It is extremely touristy. But if you want a cheap, good and convenient place to eat when shopping on Michigan Avenue, this is a very good option. Expect crowds and noise, as well as a clambering of tourists from suburbia and internationally as well. The décor is exposed brick, pump station and information brochures. The food is straightforward but surprisingly good. A variety of soups and sandwiches, pleasing both meat eaters and vegetarians.  Caution,, vegetarians aren't allowed to sit when they eat. I asked why but didn't get an answer.  It's all politics. J So if you're on Michigan Avenue and want a convenient place to eat, Flat Sammy's may be for you. PS I only wish it was still around.",0.967,0.806,0.186,0.008,0.5283928571428572
2009-04-13,4.0,OMG!  Where did Flat Sammies go???  Who's idea was it to close it down??  Is it moving somewhere else??  I can't believe this!  This was a nice place to go for lunch and escape from the office.  I'm devastated!,-0.5165,0.767,0.143,0.09,0.4712962962962963
2009-01-16,4.0,"Loveeee Flat Sammies. I work pretty much next door, so I'm a frequent visitor on my lunch days out. I always order the Southwestern Chicken Salad to go, and I'm outta there in about 5 minutes. Almost 8 bucks for a salad? That's Michigan Ave, I guess.",0.4939,0.924,0.076,0.0,0.475
2008-09-04,4.0,"I had a pesto chicken wrap here and thought it tasted fresh and was a generous portion.  For a spot that's just steps from Michigan Avenue, it doesn't get too crowded at lunch time.  I have to agree that the prices are inflated compared to similar establishments. If you dine in, you take a number and your food will be delivered to your table.  While you wait, check out all the Chicago tourism brochures since the space serves as a tourist information center, or buy half-priced theater tickets at the Hot Tix booth in the back.",0.8126,0.9,0.1,0.0,0.46666666666666673
2008-07-21,4.0,"A great lunch option for working folks in the area, I thought the pest chicken sandwich hit the spot combined with a fountain diet coke.  The meal was about $8.   Yes, the building itself caters to tourists, but there's plenty of tables and not once have felt crowded eating here.",0.5267,0.911,0.089,0.0,0.85
2008-07-02,3.0,"Prices are a tad overinflated, but the sammies are good. I had the tuna melt, which was a tad too oily. I lost some of my appetite when I saw the oil seeping through the paper bag. Sammies come with house-made kettle chips, which were great in their oily goodness! I scarfed down the bag even though I had every intention to eat only half. :) I went around one and unfortunately had to wait more than 15 minutes to get my food. Service is SLOW. But I guess that's what you get when your food is made to order.",0.9293,0.781,0.163,0.056,0.6339506172839506

2008-04-27,4.0,"I had read about this place topping some of the best sandwich spots in Chicago, so being a sandwich wizard of such I was obligated to give CFS a shot, and would have to say that I concur.  They make a mean sandwich and soup to boot.  Walking in I was very unimpressed.  I stood at at the counter for about 5 minutes waiting to be noticed, against my better judgment I did not wear my Stiletto heels.  Finally I asked, ""Am I supposed to do something, like sit down?"" but the man behind the counter said the woman would be right with me.  When I did get service it was very pleasant.  So number 83, grabbed some tourist brochures, sat down and waited for his turkey sandwich and tomato soup to arrive.  It took about 15-20 minutes for my sandwich to arrive.  Perplexed to why it took so long for a turkey sandwich, upon the first bite I discovered what my wait and the hub-bub was about.  The bread was warm, like it was just made.  I don't like chips in general, more of a pepper fan than salt but they must have sprinkled with crack because they were amazing and possibly added some crack to the tomato soup because that was the best tomato soup I have ever had.  Although I do not claim to be a soup wizard.  Yes, the service was slow and friendly I was there because of the grumbling in the stomach and the food was worth the wait.",0.9918,0.808,0.174,0.018,0.5449706694271912
2008-04-26,1.0,Boo. This place is awful. Went here upon the recommendation of other Yelpers. Would have rather taken the quick jaunt down Chicago Ave. to Jimmy John's... or even McDonald's. My sandwich was one of those toasted ones and they couldn't even nail the toasted part. My cheese was still cold and the ingredients are very sub-par. Doesn't even deserve to be called a poor-man's Potbelly's. I wouldn't even let a poor-man eat here.,-0.4588,0.958,0.0,0.042,0.5773148148148147
2008-04-11,4.0,"After the Shamrock Shuffle I stopped in here with my family. After seeing this place on 190 North, my aunt and uncle that have a condo in the area decided to give it a try. Now it is a go-to spot whenever they are in the area.  We had a spicy sandwich (I forget the name but pepper jack cheese was involved) and the southwestern chicken salad. My mom and I were going to split the items and they did it for us with no extra charge. I thought that was a nice touch. The dining area was pretty quiet with a few people coming and going. I thought the food tasted great! The salad came with this great flatbread (extra bread is always a plus in my book!!). Also, the dressing was evenly distributed and nothing was smothered. The sandwich was nice and warm (if you remember the day of the Shuffle--it was freezing!!!!) and really tasted great. It was spicy but not too spicy. I would definitely return to Sammies again the next time I'm shopping on Michigan Avenue and want a quick bite!",0.9895,0.781,0.191,0.028,0.5395833333333333

2007-08-01,3.0,"Located inside Water Tower, this is a great place for workers on lunch and tourists alike.  Their food is okay, and they have really awesome salads.  The staff aren't very friendly the few times I've gone, but when you deal with mainly tourists on a daily basis (as the info desk is located there also), I wouldn't be too happy either!",-0.1318,0.804,0.106,0.09,0.5416666666666667

2006-12-28,4.0,I highly recommend the Tuna sandwich with the homemade potato chips - absolutely delicous. The nacho chips with chili are also amazing. This place is a lovely place to bring out-of-town visitors. I wouldn't necessarily visit on an ordinary day - a few too many tourists.,0.8858,0.781,0.219,0.0,0.6487499999999999
2006-07-05,2.0,"Edit 6/14/07 (4 stars to 2 stars): Had lunch here the other day for the first time and a long time and wasn't feeling it like I used to. I had the Southwestern chicken salad and it was just ok...the chicken part of it was pretty nasty, but that may be my own pickiness when it comes to meat.  Flat Sammies is ok and all, but while in the area I'd suggest el appetito or food life. _____________________________________________________ Great lunch spot! I feel like I'm the only person who's not a tourist when I go here, but I'm not sure why local Chicago peeps are eating here  because it's really good! I highly recommend the sandwiches and salads!
