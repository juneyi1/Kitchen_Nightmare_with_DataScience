2008-10-24,5.0,"I went to Shochu a few weeks ago, and was absolutely DELIGHTED to find a place where I could enjoy the same kind of shochu I was used to in Japan. I ordered the sweet potato shochu float since I couldn't remember the names of the ones I like, and one of the three I got to taste was exactly what I was looking for. The service was by far the best I have received in a long time, if not ever. Our food did take a long time to arrive, but they were severely understaffed that night and I was having such a good time it didn't bother me at all. The pork ravioli was wonderful, and the green tea cheesecake surprisingly spectacular. I am terribly disappointed to learn that the restaurant has completely changed and is now an American pub-type place. I was so looking forward to making it a regular spot, but I guess I will have to keep looking.",0.8525,0.773,0.15,0.077,0.49259615384615385
2008-10-21,4.0,"The two times I went here I had a great time, but am only moderately surprised to learn that it has already changed its concept to become some sort of American bistro.  Personally I liked the shochu cocktails and thought the food was really tasty, but the prices were steep.  I'm not surprised to see the owners go with a more generic, Wrigleyville type restaurant, but I probably won't check that out.",0.8735,0.85,0.15,0.0,0.5611111111111112

This concept was reviewed in the RedEye around mid-Summer 2008 and was a glowing review from what I understand. The food is great (I'm not a fan of sushi, but there's a lot of Japanese-inspired non-sushi dishes on the menu) and the service has an extensive knowledge of their ShoChu & saki lists.  Regardless of the main entree, try the sesami fries, quail and the pork tenderlong satay ... the Seven Sauces are all excellent and they bring out all to taste I recommend this restaurant to anyone that is looking to get a new favorite restaurant on Clark Street.",0.947,0.858,0.131,0.011,0.6006493506493508

There probably isn't much use in reviewing the individual dishes we ordered since come Monday they will no longer exist, but overall, this is not a restaurant I would ever revisit.

2008-08-24,4.0,"There seem to be a lot of lukewarm reviews for Shochu, but here are my two cents: I had dinner here in May with four friends and it ended up costing us about $200 total.  If there is one thing I was unhappy about with Shochu, it was how expensive it was -- but I guess $40 a meal is not unheard of.  The menu has basically a lot of small plates, and we ordered everything that sounded good or interesting and shared it all.  Now I am usually not a fan of Asian fusion, and I'm also usually not a fan of fancy or posh restuarant food -- too little substance and taste for too much money.  So this is the kind of palette I'm going in with.  But I loved every dish at Shochu and thought it all tasted really great.  My favorite was the shrimp and pear kabob.  Everyone else seemed to enjoy the food too, and half of them are the type who love posh restaurant food, so there you go.  Oh, and they give you a large variety of dipping sauces.  Those sauces were good too.  I think there was a blueberry soy (?) sauce that was the hit of the night.  The waitress was also really friendly and eager to please.  She split our check for us on five different cards -- I thought that was amazing, but I guess it's the norm... that's what I get for frequenting hot dog joints more often than ~*~classy establishments~*~. I would definitely recommend Shochu to somebody wanting a different kind of dinner in Chicago.  It might have changed in the past few months, resulting in the 1- and 2- star reviews, but I doubt it.",0.9961,0.758,0.206,0.036,0.561136712749616
2008-08-18,3.0,"I went to Shochu last night with my boyfriend and another couple.  We were a little nervous when we first walked in and saw that only one table was occupied but we requested a table in the outdoor patio in the back and were relieved to see a couple more occuppied tables outside.  The service is friendy, although I was surprised that our waiter did not offer any suggestions or help with the menu until we specifically asked about items on the menu. The food was actually pretty good but I would have liked to see bigger portions - between the four of us, we ordered about two to three entrees (half orders) each and were not totally full at the end.  We started with the really spicy tuna maki, and I would have to say that I was disappointed in the really spicy tuna maki , because it was not as spicy as the name had implied.  I mean come on if you name something really spicy, it better be really spicy!  And I would not recommend ordering maki here, it was not that great and the rolls are very tiny!  We did get the skirt steak which was pretty good, it was similar to a steak lettuce wrap and again I would have liked to see a little more steak in there but it was pretty tasty.  I also enjoyed the braised short ribs that we ordered.  We also ordered the mushroom gyoza which were tasty but nothing out of the ordinary.  We ordered the fried tofu with the ginger honey glaze, which tasted like fried tofu covered in honey sauce.  I love dessert but I was disappointed that this dish was nothing more than fried tofu with honey over it.  I could have made that at home!  And I love dessert and tofu but this dish was just weird.  My favorite dish was the lobster curry bowl - the curry was thick and spicy (just the way I like it!) and there was a whole lobster clawin the dish.  Usually when you see lobster mentioned in dishes, unless it is a full lobster, it is hard to have real lobster meat in there.  Overall I had a pretty good experience, I would go back and order the Lobster curry.  However, I didn't find that any of the other dishes were amazing, and for what they all cost, I would have expected more of a wow factor.  So to sum it up, I might go and pick up some lobster curry if I was in the neighborhood, but in terms of going back there, I would rather go somewhere where I can better food for my money.",0.9977,0.774,0.185,0.041,0.529389880952381
2008-08-13,2.0,"It was a Saturday night and I was rolling with my Korean squad.  Decided on Shochu for a few reasons, one of the guys had mentioned the owner was a Cali Korean that brought the idea from California.    Hence the reasoning in going.  Plus the name Shochu, wtf is that? We'd heard of Soju (Korean Gin), never this.  I believe its Japanese Vodka, they say its stronger than wine but weaker than whiskey.   So it's a Saturday night about 11ish and it's dead.  They had a few customers that sat in the garden area out back till that closed, while we walked to our seats, so it was us, a few people sitting at the bar and a couple sitting nearby.  Later we come to realize that a few of the people sitting at the bar served us food.  Are they customers helping out? or waitstaff just chillin ? Through dinner we were constantly wanting and wondering, service stunk.  Well, wait service stunk, the runners did their jobs.  There were only two waitresses and ours doubled as a waitress and bartender.  When you start a meal with a drink you plan to have a few more while trying to enjoy a meal.  It's Saturday night! I would assume the waitress would think to come back and check on us? Allow your customer to drink more, making the tip better, etc..  Nope, not the case. Moving on, the shochu cocktails weren't impressive.  Shochu cocktails were $5 that night.  Appetizers are fairly good and inexpensive, though not filling.  We sampled three flavors of the fried chicken wings (4 pcs to an order), they offer 5 flavors.  FYI the sauces start with sweet and move to spicy.  They offer a shochu flavored sauce which seemed to consist of corn syrup over a crunchy coated chicken wing.  Don't let it get cold, it's not worth to eat.  That's another thing, we could tell our dishes had sat for some time before it was served.  Are they lazy?  Wtf?  When it comes to Japanese foods using a fried prep there is a window, just after cooking it's got to be served and eaten.  Otherwise its cold chicken in corn syrup.  The other wing sauces, eh, care not to mention.  Sesame french fries, good idea and taste, too bad, that too was served almost cold.  Chicken egg roll comes in two pcs, they were way too oily, somebody dropped them in the oil and forgot about them.  Everything looked good, presentation was appealing, but the experience just lacked.  The dining area had a subtle glow, one could appreciate the lounge feel and the accompanying lounge / jazz music went well.  ( I believe they played a track from both Portishead and Goldfrapp.  Music like that; I wonder if they were running Pandora in the background) I don't think I would go back..  unless someone else was buying. If you plan on tasting, you could sample a few appetizers (2-3) and have a drink for around $20 per person.

2008-08-03,3.0,"My friends and I were originally going to go to Orange on Clark and Belmont, but seeing how utterly swamped it was we decided to wander until we found another brunch place. This led us to Shochu, a place none of us had tried. At first we thought it was closed because it was completely empty - but no, it was open...just empty. The brunch menu is small, but contains a variety of interesting items at decent prices. I ordered the bacon and egg sushi rolls, and my friends ordered the grilled cheese & tomato soup, the bacon & irish cheese omelet, the green curry shitaki mushroom egg scramble, the honeyed sweet rice, the sweet spring rolls with marscapone cheese, and the eggs benedict.  We were excited to eat, and the food certainly sounded great. After ordering we waited. And waited. And waited. We must have waited at least 45 minutes before our food arrived - and even then each dish arrived 3 minutes apart. By the time I got my breakfast sushi it was cold - although it still tasted pretty good. Essentially it was egg and bacon with sushi rice wrapped in seaweed - you better like seaweed if you're going to eat it, as the flavor comes across pretty strong with egg not having a terribly powerful flavor.  Overall, the food was great. The honeyed rice (sort of like a porridge) was a favorite, and everyone loved the tiny cubed hash brown potatoes that came with some of the dishes. In addition, we were all intrigued by the red Banana Sauce they put on the tables instead of ketchup - and it actually tastes a good deal like ketchup! The green curry eggs were apparently pretty spicy but good, and the eggs Benedict were reported to be perfect. I would suggest passing on the cinnamon spring rolls though - they taste mostly like carnival food, and there are other side dishes and appetizers that would be better. After waiting forever for the food, we then waited ANOTHER 20 minutes for the check. Sure, the waiter was nice...but does it really take that long to get our food out and bring us the check when the place is completely empty?? For all the food we ordered the total came to roughly $60 - not too bad for four of us who ordered a lot of food. If you are willing to wait, the food is worth it.

I obviosly started to think through potential causes.  I wasn't drinking that night, so it certainly wasn't alcohol.  The foods I ate that no one else from my table ate were the tuna tempura and the veggie skewer.  But I think the cause was the dipping sauces.  Even though these are communal, the plate by me was not used by anyone else.  These sauces could have been sitting out for longer than they should.  Of course, I'll never know the exact souce, but I am 100% confident this was due to something I ate at Shochu.

The drinks were very tasty (although I'd like if they were around $2 cheaper... probably not gonna happen). The grilled octopus and edamame salad was a little small, but DELICIOUS..mm. I nearly ordered another, but got the smoked salmon, avocado and cilantro maki instead. Smoked salmon was a little dry, which was disappointing, but the maki was expertly rolled, and 6 pieces was actually more than I expected.

2008-07-03,3.0,"First off let me start with... Friday night and every restaurant along this stretch of Clark was crowded... Granted our intent was to try Shochu... but when we approached the restaurant....hmmmm.... it was EMPTY!!!!  They wasn't an empty table in the Morrocan place....but Shochu... there was not an unempty table! Seriously, this almost made us second guess our decision to come in and try it. There was a FEW people sitting at the bar, but I could not tell if they were the staff or they were customers. We asked if they had outdoor seating, and they said that they have a back patio, but it just started to rain so we decided to sit inside.  OMG we were treated unbelievable... the waiter was fantastic!!!  He was very honest with what he recommended and what he didnt! That was great!!!!  The restaurant was very clean.  First off...WOW, the drinks were unbelievable!!!  Shochu wow!!! Lo Cal??? U would never know... AND it is unbelievably smooooth!!! I think I drank my drink in like 2 minutes! It was so yummy! Ha, I can't remember the exact name of the drink but it had Kiwi, and it was FABULOUS!!!  Ok... another bonus... their drink special was $2 Sapporo.... where can you get $2 Sapporo??? Especially in the city? I have never seen Sapporo that cheap!!!  Second.... ok the food, well some was good, and some was just average - or below average. The tapas style japanese was kind of cool. The eggplant and calamari were very good.... but maybe because the dipping sauces were sooo good!!!! Ok.... moving on, the rolls... hmm.. not so good. The spicey tuna roll... was not spicey, and it was very bland and the rolls were very tiny. However, the Lobster Roll was really big ??? but again, kind of bland. The peices of lobster were big, but compared to other sushi places I would not recommend the rolls here, and this obviously is not their specialty. We also ordered the seasame fries, which were really different, kind of sweet, but good. We also ordered the octopus salad. I thought the octopus was a little chewy and I would not order this again.  I might have given Shochu  4 stars.... BUT..... 1. The portion sizes were very inconsistent. Either you are getting big portions... or very small. Granted, I realize this is tapas style... but the strawberry salad thing we ordered was like one strawberry... it was very good but considering the order of fries was enough to feed 4 people.  2. I am having a problem with the fact that everything that is served with the dipping sauces is fried. My friends are vegetarians, (they eat fish), but we were having some challenges ordering off the menu because most of the veggie entrees were fried. Or were meat.  3. I did not like the xeroxed paper menus... first of all everyone at the table is distributed a drink menu & a food menu, and they are long menus...... they were getting in the way on the table, and they were just kind of tacky. I am not trying to be picky... hahaha...  I would say this is a great play to stop for a drink and try the shochu because the drinks were really good.

2008-07-02,3.0,"I took an out-of-towner friend here to show her that there is more to Chicago dining than deep-dish pizza, hot dogs and Italian beef sandwiches. (Okay, full ulterior-motive disclosure: I had read a couple of reviews and wanted to go there myself, so it seemed like a good excuse.) We went on the day of the Pride March, which I'd forgotten was also in that neighborhood, but despite this, the place was refreshingly un-crowded when we got there, though not disturbingly empty (an empty restaurant is always a suspicious sign to me: what does everyone else know about this restaurant that I don't?) Anyway, we were seated, and our waittress attended to us; she was very informative about shochu, the restaurant's namesake beverage, which is distilled from rice or barley but is closer to vodka than sake. My friend and I both ordered the Black Dragon cocktail, made with barley shochu muddled with blackberries and simple syrup. The shochu is very clean tasting, to the point of not really having much flavor, I felt. I didn't detect any sort of alcohol taste (or intoxicating power -- and I'm a lightweight). All in all, I prefer sake, but it was interesting to try something new.  The Asian twist on tapas was fun and not badly executed. We started with salads: my strawberry shiso salad was yummy: the plate was drizzled with what appeared to be a balsamic vinaigrette, slightly viscous, which mated well with the berries. My friend enjoyed her cucumber chile salad.    The bulk of our order was composed of the grilled yakitori skewers (wish there were more of these to choose from) , which come with seven dipping sauces, as well as a chile-infused salt. The shrimp and asian pear was particularly good; the asian pear married well with the miso lychee aioli, if i'm remembering correctly, and the shrimp was enhanced by a bit of the chile salt. The chicken and scallion skewer had a good taste but the chicken seemed to have a bit of fat on it.  Tempura shrimp is the one I wouldn't get again: shrimp were each threaded lengthwise along a skewer, then fried, making it impossible to get them off. The shrimp also ended up tough and dry.  Also, one puzzler was in my friend's ""yellow curry lobster and fennel stew"" dish: underneath the lobster was a slab of unidentifiable white fish that appeared to be raw from the way it looked and cut with a fork etc. This isn't mentioned in the description of the dish on the menu, so we just wondered, ""What is that? Is it cooked? Is it supposed to be?"" Kind of weird.  Overall, Shochu was okay, but it could perhaps benefit from a bigger menu. Also, I wished I liked the signature beverage more, though that's about personal taste. Good service, decent food, amd something different.",0.9966,0.828,0.15,0.022,0.48437277999778
2008-06-30,4.0,"Shochu. Nearly a perfect drink. Low in calories? Check. Comes in varieties? Check. Tasty? Check. Regular alcohol content? No check!!! I liked all the different drinks they have (shochu comso, shochuijto) but if you are looking to get your companion tipsy it will be an expensive night. The food though was EXCELLENT! I love the idea of Japanese tapas! We went off recommendations from our waitress and were not disappointed. The skirt steak which was in a lettuce wrap was so good as were the bacon-wrapped dates (but really, what isn't good wrapped in bacon???). And the shrimp and asian pear yakitori that came with the tasty dipping sauces, I loved the aioli.  If you're looking at the maki, try the lobster and mizuna with truffle mayonnaise.

Nothing was bad, by any means...it was just kind of sloppy. The flavors weren't as distinct as I would have liked them to be. And my drink, which is one of their big things, was only ok. It lacked flavor.  On the plus side, I think the price listed here is totally wrong. We paid about $55 for three people and two of us got drinks...that's pretty cheap for a decent place.

The Chef at Muramoto in Madison suggested that I check out Shochu sometime because its along the same lines and I LOVE Muramoto....maybe I didn't find it all that interesting because I was holding it up to the high standard that is Muramoto.  The Shochu itself was an interesting experience, sort of a japanese vodka. I could see myself becoming a puddle rather quickly and switched to wine.  Upon ordering a bottle of pouilly fuisse the waitress made a big deal of my being able to pronounce it properly and how I must be a wine connoisseur, etc, etc....which was a bit annoying. The food is good, not great. The experience is good, not great. Therefore, three stars for you, Shochu.",0.8321,0.75,0.14,0.109,0.5462169312169312

It was probably because I was so excited to try it out--they definitely met my expectations. Atmosphere coming in is great. Unfortunately, we came on short notice on a Friday and sat at the bar which is fine, but next time I'm hoping to get outdoor seating. I lived in Japan for 6 months last year and I hopped on the chance to try this place out because shochu was the only thing I could find to drink in Japan that I liked. And no hangovers! I started with the Kiyo which was a perfect combination for a cocktail, and it wasn't too sweet.  A funny thing I noted--the red curry shrimp was f***ing spicy!! This isn't common in Japanese cooking either, so you know that's the fusion influence. Nonetheless, it was still amazing. I also shared wasabi fries, maki (tempura shrimp, bacon, avocado--can we say glutunous?), and shrimp and asian pear yakitori with a friend. Definitely coming back.

2008-05-30,3.0,"Just got back from dinner at Shochu.  We weren't sure what to expect after reading some of the online reviews, but we had a fun time.  Like other tapas-style restaurants, it is a good place to go with a group so you can try a bunch of different plates.  I really enjoyed the Asian twist. Our waitress was fantastic.  Very friendly, attentive and informative about the menu.  She also made some great recommendations for us. Things we liked best:  -shrimp and Asian pear skewer (great combination of flavors) - yellow curry lobster (yum!!) - the guava/ginger shochu cocktail (ginger was freshly grated and  perfectly balanced the guava) - the blackberry shochu cocktail (seemed scary without a mixer, but none was needed) -chicken and scallion skewer (great with the with dipping sauces!) - spicy tuna roll (the fish was really fresh) I also really liked the tuna poke, which is like a tuna ceviche.  I am a fan of meat and fruit together though.  It wasn't really my friends' thing. Of the seven sauces, our favorites were the persimmon hoisin, blueberry teriyaki, lychee aioli and Thai chile. We thought the steak lettuce rolls were good, but not our favorite of the bunch.  I also liked the raspberry shochu cocktail, but not as much as the other two.   The only dish we were not  huge fans of was the blueberry quail.  It wasn't bad, but it didn't have a ton of flavor.  The table next  to us got the quail and bacon skewer, which looked better and came with  the blueberry dipping sauce.  I would do that next time. I might also skip dessert next time. You must love molasses and brown sugar if you get the flan.  It is kind of rich compared to the light and fresh ingredients in the main dishes.  The lychee cake had a great flavor and consistency, but the saltiness of the soy in the sauce ended up overpowering the cake.  If we got it again, I would just ask them to do the cake with some berries instead of the sauce.   Overall, a good experience.  Especially for such a young restaurant. I hope they do well.  We'll be back.",0.9985,0.72,0.245,0.035,0.5437777777777777
2008-05-18,4.0,"What a treat! This is a great addition to Chicago's restaurant scene.  Here's the break down:  Ambiance - Modern decor with comfortable slightly dim lighting. Cozy fireplace and nice bar.  Service - There were a couple small mistakes. When plates were taken away they were not replaced so when the food came we had no plates to eat on. This also happened with our dessert. The dessert came and they had taken away our silverware and forgotten to replace it.  Drinks - The Bloody Dragon was a wonderful drink. The Mononoke was not as complex, but more refreshing.  Food - Eggplant and zucchini was alright, but the sauces really made the dish. Skirt steak lettuce wraps were delish. The steak was extremely tender and well seasoned. The Adobo spare ribs were very meaty and fall off the bone tender. The chicken wings had a great flavor. I wish they would have rendered some of the fat from the skin, otherwise they were great. The Ono poke with peanut sauce had a nice kick to it. The flavors were strong and the fish was melt in your mouth. The chocolate mousse trifle is awesome! It's the perfect size for a sweet little ending. Price - We ordered 5 small plates, 1 dessert, and 2 drinks. The bill came out to be $65 including tax. We thought it was a great deal for the quality of food we had.  Overall, this was great. We got there at 7:30pm and it was only about 1/3 full, but it seemed to be more of a late night place. Also the bar was starting to fill up by the time we were done with dinner. This would be a great place a light meal, drinks, and conversation. The music was not too loud. The place was very cozy.",0.9971,0.769,0.211,0.02,0.6550569800569801
2008-05-17,4.0,"Decided to hit Wrigleyville/Lakeview with my gf and in looking for somewhere to eat stumbled upon Shochu.  First of all, have to say the sauces were good overall, but some didn't seem that great. Loved the blueberry teriyaki and the pomegranite hoisin as well as the aioli. The thai sweet chili seemed just like the ones you could get in the bottle though.  The shochu was good and the red rice ale was pretty decent.  For food we got the oysters which were actually quite tasty. Also had the kobe beef which was good, but didn't seem as good as the server said it would be. The tonkatsu was really good and was the best dish we had over there. The chicken wings were really good as well. Only thing that we thought was just okay was the shrimp tempura though to be fair, we were warned beforehand by our server. It just seemed like it'd be something more special than 3 pieces of shrimp tempura on sticks. For dessert we had the lychee poundcake thing with the blueberry soy sauce. While I just couldn't really understand blueberry soy sauce and couldn't really taste the lychee (gf couldn't taste the lychee either) my gf really liked the dessert a lot and really did like the blueberry soy sauce. Maybe I'm just old school and want my soy sauce plain and salty. Decor was nice, though there were some aspects that seemed tacky like the fireplace connected to the metal pipe thing. Seemed very out of place. There was also a plant near the window that looked out of place as well. The thing that dropped the stars down was the service. We were told this place is a month old now and you'd think they'd be able to get their act together a little better. We didn't have reservations, but were seated right away. The problem was that it took about 20 minutes before we were even asked for drinks. It was bad enough for service that the table next to us asked the server to forego the dishes they were waiting on because it took so long. It may have been on off night for that so maybe that is why there are so many 5 star ratings for this place. Would definitely go back again as it was a good meal and was a nice way to start the evening.",0.9976,0.767,0.201,0.033,0.5021075837742504

We went with the following: *Wasabi Fries - I'm not a fan, but my friend thought it sounded interesting.  Truthfully, it was DRENCHED in wasabi and looked really mushy.   *Tuna Pineapple Poke - This was good.  The fish was cut in good sized chunks and the pineapple was a nice contrast. *Short Ribs - Tasty.  So tasty that you didn't need any one of the seven dipping sauces.  Note: The dipping sauces were interesting.  Some good - some just ""eh"". *Grilled Octopus Salad - I would have loved it more if there were a little more of the basil vinaigrette.   *Lobster Maki - Could've been better - MUCH better.  The truffle sauce totally overwhelmed the roll.  Moreover, I really had a problem with the fact that the maki was probably made earlier and refrigerated.  Yes - you read that correctly.  Why did I think this?  The roll was cold, period.  But other telltale signs were that the rice was chewy and you could tell that the entire roll had congealed.   As for beverages, we sampled a bunch of them and they were tasty with the exception of the blackberry/shochu combination.  Why?  I like my drinks strong, but there either wasn't enough of the blackberries or they weren't very fresh as it hardly tasted like blackberry. I don't know if I'll go back again, but if I do, I'll definitely stay FAR away from the sushi items until someone convinces me that there's a chef in the kitchen making it fresh.",0.9939,0.716,0.216,0.068,0.5796296296296296

2008-05-07,4.0,"Shochu is a Japanese alcohol that is somewhere between sake and vodka, with less calories. Ummm, awesome. Right off the bat... I had the Red Dragon cocktail (well priced at $9) and I am fairly certain I could be one happy lady if I were drinking these pomegranate delights all night...went down oh-so-smooooth. Mmm. Happiness in Japanese alcohol form. My friend had the kiwi cocktail (Izumi), and though a little thicker (muddled kiwi), it was still very good. Both were garnished with a lemon peely thing...nice touch.  The menu is interesting for the neighborhood...it's small plates and some sushi thrown in for good measure. I have to say though, the sushi was EXCELLENT and priced on par with other joints in Lakeview. We tried the mushroom/mint maki roll and the smoked salmon, cream cheese roll. The mint was interesting, but overall we were big fans of the sushi.  The small plates:  wasabi fries: kind of a miss on this one. I like the idea, but these were just regular french fries drenched in wasabi glaze. It made them mushy and sticky and hard to eat.  Steak lettuce wraps: VERY good, though a bit hard to eat gracefully, not recommended for a first date. Good thing I was eating with my lovely gal pal who doesn't care what I look like eating.  Zuchhini/mushroom skewers: skip it, really teensy portions and not that interesting.  Kampachi tartare with chips: good as an appetizer.  Sweet cuke salad: also good, small...but able to split with another person.  Some of the dishes are pricier than others. Depends on how much one orders (duh) and the essentials of the dish.  Desserts: Only $3 a piece!? They are very small portions, but honestly just right for a sweet bite to end dinner. Priced well. We had the chocolate trifle and the green tea cheesecake and were very impressed... Service was impeccable. Ambience upscale, clean, modern and stylish. Great new spot to check out when you don't feel like waiting at Mia Francesca... OVERALL: recommended for a quick bite and drinks before going out, drinks at the bar, casual first date. Making it an entire dinner may be difficult and pricey, but it's possible.

The pork gyoza was just so so, it came with 7 different dipping sauces and only one of them was worth re-dipping into (the blueberry teriyaki). Lastly, we had the tempura shrimp, bacon and avocado roll. This was the MOST disappointing of all three dishes we tried. The minute I put it in my mouth, I immediately had a fishy, stale taste!

2008-05-01,4.0,"We heard about Shochu on DailyCandy and decided to head over there tonight after making a reservation in the afternoon, which it turns out we didn't need because the place didn't fill up while we were there. I imagine it might be more crowded on the weekend or once the word gets out. Overall, we enjoyed the food (very small portions though) and loved the atmosphere with the dim lighting, brick walls, and mellow music. Service was, as others have said, attentive but not intrusive, and our waiter gave great recommendations. We followed his advice and only ordered 3 or 4 plates at a time to save table space. We started off with a few drinks, the towari shochu and the rice shochu with pear and green tea. I liked the hazelnut finish of the towari but my boyfriend said he couldn't taste it, and we both agree the smell wasn't wonderful. The pear cocktail, however, was lovely and refreshing. I definitely recommend that.  For the food, we started off with the wasabi fries, which were quite tasty but definitely need chopsticks (they're pretty wet), bacon wrapped dates, which we were told came from Twist's so it's no wonder they're similar, kobe steak, and the tuna poke, which was yummy and accompanied by tiny chunks of pineapple. Because we ordered 2+ dishes on the right side of the menu (I forget the category names), we got the seven sauces as well. Their takes on ranch and miso aioli were our favorites, while the blueberry teriyaki was my biggest disappointment because it tasted pretty much just like soy sauce. After all this, we decided to get the adobo ribs and the smoked quail legs, too, because we were still hungry. Our waiter warned us that the latter was small, and it really was, but tasted good, and the ribs were tender and came with the most delicious sauce. We opted not to get any sushi since my boyfriend claims ""it didn't feel like a sushi place"". Unfortunately, the lychee dessert was gone (and it was our waiter's favorite) so we ended up going with the rice pudding and the chocolate cake for dessert. I liked being able to taste the individual rice as opposed to one big mush. We didn't taste any wasabi with the cake, though, which wasn't a big deal since we had a ton with our fries earlier. All four desserts were $3 each but they are extremely tiny! While my boyfriend felt like he was still hungry after dessert, I think I had just the right amount.

2008-04-28,4.0,"My girlfriend and I went to this Japanese small plate restaurant Friday night, and we were impressed.  We really love tapas and dim sum as we can sample tons of different foods and flavors.  Shochu had only opened two nights earlier on 4/23; and the review on Metromix was encouraging. Food We ordered the following:  skirt steak, chicken breast yakitori, bacon-wrapped dates, blueberry teriyaki quail, tuna pineapple poke, and the smoked salmon roll. Seven dipping sauces and a salted chili garnish came with the dates and chicken.  The sweet Thai chili sauce was the best with the right amount of spice.  Chicken was a good choice to try all the dipping sauces presented. As connoisseurs of bacon-wrapped dates, these rate highly yet just below Twist's.  Well-priced for four and the bacon was crispy.  No dipping sauce needed. Quail was tender and juicy (accompanying spaetzle was light). One misstep was the smoked salmon roll.  While good, the salmon in the maki was *cooked* and not smoked.  Unconventional or false advertising?  Regardless, a Japanese restaurant should know how to make sushi. Drinks I had a flight of four 2-oz. pours of shochu, my girlfriend had a red dragon cocktail, and we shared an Hitachino white ale. Red dragon was stellar and not too, too sweet -- pomegranate, triple sec, sour mix, and lime juice. Friday was the first time Shochu offered the flight option.  I'd recommend they refine it first.  Four 2-oz. samples cost $20.  While priced properly for the amount served, it's a bit much for one person (and the bartender gave hefty pours).  Shochu, the alcohol, is nearly the ABV of vodka, so I essentially did 4+ shots.  Yet they were smoother than standard liquor.  I was shochu'ed out by the end, as I suspect it's an acquired like most alcohols. Ambiance The interior to dark yet inviting, the decor simple, and the music at a tolerable volume.  Experience slightly soured by trio of adolescent girls next to us.  Some lady of ambiguous relation to the restaurant and girls often observed them. Service Informed and attentive.  Explained to us the popularity of shochu and directed us to try the skirt steak and tuna poke.  The recommendation of the flight was a bit misguided. Overall Good value for quality/quantity of food/drink consumed ($108 total tab) with a good atmosphere.  There are plenty of sushi joints in Lakeview, but Shochu sets itself apart with many other offerings.  Perhaps too many as the menu was overwhelming at times.  I also docked Shochu based on the recent opening kinks: cooked salmon and shochu flights.  These will be worked out in no time -- the experienced restaurateurs also own Deleece.",0.9584,0.915,0.071,0.013,0.46297161172161166

The prices seem reasonable - ranging from $3 for a dessert or fries and going up to about $12.   Also, it seems they serve dinner until 3AM on Saturdays - a much better choice than the Burrito joints open at that time. :) The only thing that was bad was that our table was too small for all of the large plates and the table was too wiggly (I almost spilled my drink several times from bumping it).  Overall, it's a great addition to this run of restaurants on Clark Street.  I'll definitely be back!",0.9946,0.761,0.214,0.025,0.541156462585034
