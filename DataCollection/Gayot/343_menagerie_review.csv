2006-04-27,4.0,"Celebrated my birthday there with my parents and husband at the end of last year. It came highly rec'd by friends and I was really impressed. The menu had a great variety and everything tasted so good, there was a good balance of comfort food options (mac n cheese, potatoes) and more sophisticated choices too. This place doesn't get a ton of buzz but its worth trying, the food was EXCELLENT! Leave room for dessert and order the chocolate fondue!",0.975,0.691,0.295,0.014,0.6278787878787878
2006-04-04,5.0,Excellent Food with a great wine list- they even have a BYOB option (I forget if it is every night or if they have a low corkage) which is rare for such a good restaurant. This place suffers a bit from location but the food is worth it. The staff was nice and I recommend this place for a nice night out.,0.9413,0.644,0.284,0.072,0.6849999999999999
2005-07-20,4.0,"I love their outdoor patio on warm summer nights! Makes the experience even better. They have pretty much traditional American food, with a little bit of global flare. The combinations are wonderul and the food is really tasty. They have big portions -- so you're definitely going to be taking some home!",0.9409,0.741,0.259,0.0,0.4318181818181818
