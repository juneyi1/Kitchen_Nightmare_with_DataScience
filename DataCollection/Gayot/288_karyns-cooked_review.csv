2017-07-21,1.0,"I was very excited to check out this place, I have been vegan for months and my sister was very open to trying raw vegan food but is not vegan herself. When we walked in we were shocked by the lack of acknowledgment from the staff and quite frankly put off by the exclusive vibe of the cafe in general. The cafe was in disarray and the food bar appeared unkempt. We sat with the menu, continued to be ignored by the staff as they greeted other customers who appeared to be regulars, and then proceeded to the counter to place our order. The cashier was disorganized and unapologetically told my sister they were out of the nachos. My sister then proceeded to order the BLT half sandwich, dim sum, and the cheese plate; I proceeded to order the half BLT sandwich, half egg salad sandwich and mac and cheese. We waited over 15 minutes for water, and shorty after got the cheese plate... which was extremely salty. The sweetened berries and nuts were decent but in a very small portion. After we finished the cheese plate the cashier then told us that they were out of the BLT sandwich and the egg salad sandwich and the mac and cheese, she also offered us a refund. We gladly accepted the refund and left after a complete waste of time and energy. The only positive part of this experience was the full refund - hence the one star.

2016-08-07,1.0,"MAKE IT TO POINT 5 IF YOU WANT TO KNOW ABOUT SEEING KARYN'S BARE ASS WHILE EATING! I was looking forward to eating here, my daughter and I are both vegan. 1. It started with walking in and waiting by the sign that read, ""hostess will seat you"", no one approached us for several minutes. At the time there was no customers on the dining side and 6 on the side where you order at counter. After waiting and waiting at hostess stand, a customer said that we should just seat ourselves because nobody will seat us. So, I walked to counter side to to ask if dining side was open and to ask if we could sit on that side? The woman, who later, much later, was our waitress, said yes, and that they were open. Here is a summary of the rest. 2. We were the customers seated on dining side and did not get approached for at least 10 minutes. 2. Two things we ordered they were out of, we only ordered 4 items. 3. First item, our appetizer, almond pâté, sat there for 7 minutes before brought over, I was facing window.  What's ironic about that is the waitress came back to us after we ordered it and asked if we wanted the raw or cooked pate, the cooked coming with warm pita. We said cooked. But by the time she brought it from window, it was not so warm. 4. Second item came shortly after, my daughters veggie sandwich. My main course, spring rolls, NEVER CAME. After dropping my daughters sandwich the waitress did not come back, I did not see her anywhere. I told my daughter  to go ahead and eat. When the waitress stopped by 15 minutes later to see if we wanted anything else, I asked if my spring rolls were coming? She said SHE FORGOT TO ORDER THEM. She then looked at me, as if it was up to me fix it.  my daughter was upset and said I could eat some of her sandwich, I told the waitress to take the spring rolls off the bill. NOW HERE IS THE WORSE WORSE WORSE PART. 5. The restaurant was getting more customers on dining side, Karyn herself came into the dining room, WITH HER PANTS HANGING OFF HER ASS SO LOW YOU COULD SEE HER CRACK!!! It was gross, sickening, nauseating!!! She walked by me and my daughter, who is 13, with her ass showing! Absolute worse experience ever!!! Don't go! Terrible, negative 10 stars. I am in the service business and have been for several years, so dear Karyn, I must say, people don't want to see you ass while in your restaurant. The board of health would likely agree. 6.

My husband and I ordered the cheese plate appetizer, which included a nice sampling of four different (vegan) cheeses, dried fruits, nuts, and crackers. The portion size was perfect. Enough for us to share, but not so much that it ruined our appetites for the entrée. The texture of the crackers was a little dry, but everything else on the plate was spot on. For our main meal we ordered the jerk tofu as a wrap and the enchiladas. Both were very flavorful. The jerk tofu had a nice spicy kick, and the tofu was perfectly cooked. The ketchup served with the potato wedges tasted homemade. We also enjoyed the seasoning on the black beans served with the enchiladas. A nice bonus was a trip to the salad bar that came with our meal. This is not your typical boring salad bar, there are a variety of unique salads and spreads to taste.  Admittedly, I was a little weary about coming to Karyn's after reading some Yelp reviews about the service, but overall I am glad we came. Our server was very nice and accommodating, however, she was working all the tables in the restaurant alone. When we first arrived it was not busy and she managed, but by the time we left it was a full house. It would have definitely been beneficial if there was another server working.

With that being said, the service is dismal.  The last 3x my husband and I have been there, our server has been a young African American, tall and slender male-- who has no business being in the service industry.  His demeanor is dry, unpolished and bored.  When he has ventured to make any small talk, it has been sarcastic and unwelcome commentary.  For instance during our lunch today, my husband and I were searching the web on our cell phones for girl's names because we're expecting our first child this December.  Noticing that we had been on our cell phones the majority of lunch, our server made the snide comment when dropping off the check to my husband, ""there's an iPad in there."" --apparently as an incentive to look at the bill?  Which was only insult upon injury since we had planned on ordering coffee and dessert, but were never asked if there was anything else that we wanted.   Or there was the time when I presented him the groupon on my cell phone when the check was delivered, I received a sarcastic smile with ""you've used this before, right?""  Confused I retorted, ""What? No this Groupon has never been used before.""  He then rolled his eyes at me and huffed like I was boring him and said, ""No, I mean you have to press View Voucher and then Redeemed.  Haven't you used a Groupon before?""  This unfortunately has become the experience at Karyn's which now has overshadowed the quality of the food.  The last 3x we've been there this has been the service. In my book, 3 strikes and you're out seems fair.  We will not be returning. Note:  For anyone wondering, this treatment was not based on our gratuity either.  Even as poor as the service has been, he benefacted 20+% of the bill every time.  Although it was not at all deserved or earned, my husband and I are just not the type to stiff the wait staff.  Our route is just to never return.",-0.9129,0.861,0.05,0.089,0.49757326007326

My husband who is the farthest thing from a Vegan as possible was impressed with his Lasagna and the chili on the nachos - all meatless. Our server was kind and very laid back, but did not ask if it was our first time there and assumed we knew how things worked (the menu, salad bar, etc.), but when we told him we didn't know what he was talking about he quickly welcomed us warmly.  On that note, we were very ""warm"" throughout the entire visit. It had been a rare hot spring day in Chicago and the husband, is a laborer that worked all day in the heat, really needed to get cooled off a bit. He was not happy that the table water was served warm and there was no cold brewed tea on the menu. There was no air on in the building and that was difficult. But our curiosity kept our spirits up and we were glad to give a new cuisine a try. We will probably give this another try, but perhaps get some food to go and have a picnic on the Lake Front!",0.8803,0.842,0.107,0.051,0.629558596165739

When we asked for suggestions on the menu, the response was that is a great choice for everything we pointed to.  The food is ok. We ordered the Buddha bowl and it did not taste that great. The sauce listed on the menu was teriyaki but came with soya sauce. When we asked, they said the chef might have added more soya sauce then usual but did not offer a replacement. The taco wrap was ok.  We left hungry and ended up going to Taco Bell. Was much more satisfying.   Please bring back the old test.",0.9683,0.803,0.16,0.037,0.45460317460317456

We ordered our food and coffee and didn't receive the coffees for quite some time, for which the server apologized and told us the coffees were on him for the long wait. It was an hour and 15 minutes before we received our first food item (my friend had a watch on and we were paying attention to the time because we were already waiting so long) which was not the appetizer we ordered, but one of our entrees. The other entree, appetizer and side came out a while later, after I watched the entree sit in the window for 10 minutes until the appetizer and side joined it. I had to ask for the bill (which still had the coffees on it) when we had finished eating and after putting my card out, I went to the restroom. On the way there I found our server sitting down eating. I understand he needed to eat but we waited so long, he could have at least cashed us out first. When I returned from the restroom, our bill was sill not paid and we had to ask a different server to run it for us, which he did graciously and in a timely manner.

Seemed quite strange since I was just there two weeks prior, and business seemed like it was good( besides the slow service).  Fast forward with my friend and I arriving at the Halsted location in LP.

I thought this was funny since we noticed Karyn sitting in the other room talking with her friends while we stood there waiting to be seated. I thought that was slightly awkward and rude. We sit down, finally order and get our plates 20 minutes later.  We notice someone going around table to table asking how everything was. It was Karyn, but it was odd because out of her stopping by all the tables (8 tables mind you)and checking in, she decided to skip us. Clearly we weren't worth her time.

The sitting area is very clusters and it seems like they put more tables than they should have since it is just small tight space. My two cousins and I ordered nachos, taco salads, and finally their falafel meal. After about 20 minutes, the waiter informed me that they didn't have any falafel so I chose their green enchiladas. After about 20 minutes (again), the waiter came back and informed me that they didn't have that either. So I decided to not order anything simply because I didn't really care for another rejection and I had been nibbling on my cousins' food. He then went back to the kitchen and brought me out the plate in a matter of 10 mins... okay? That was kind of weird. But He was really nice! Anyway, the taco salad and the nachos were really good (they are kind of hard to mess up) but I wasn't really a fan of the enchiladas. It was just nothing special at all and definitely not worth the wait. But the beans that came with it were really good.  For dessert, they literally had no cooked desserts at all (they had ran out) which was very very disappointing so we decided to just pay and leave.

2015-11-14,1.0,"Worst dining experience ever. My boyfriend and I have been going to Karyn's for years, the one on Green and on Wells, before they both closed.  This was our first time coming to the one on Halsted and we will never come back.  We walked in and the sign said, ""Please wait to be seated""  So we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  We looked questioningly at waitstaff, all who looked through us.  Then finally a bus boy told us we could just seat ourselves.  There were a few tables with people, but not packed.  It took a while to take our order, during which we ordered two ice teas and an appetizer.  We got our hummus plate, but no tea.  Our waitress must have walked past us 3 or 4 times before she actually brought them.  Then the waiting really started. We waited 45 mins before I finally had to stop the waitress (who must have walked right past our table to serve the two people behind us their 4 entrees about a dozen times) and ask her how much longer it would be, and also ask for more of the supposedly bottomless iced tea which had sat empty about a half hour.  When our meals finally arrived, my boyfriend's was cold, from waiting from my meal to be finished, and mine was absolutely awful.  The veggies and sauce were bland and the rice was horribly salty.  Again I had to call her over to explain the food was inedible, something I never do at a restaurant.  But after waiting 45 mins I was slightly perturbed.  She was very nice and recommended something else and I only had to wait 15 mins for that to come out, but I got to watch my boyfriend eat his cold meal. So 20 mins after I started eating, I have to call our waitress over and ask for a box and tell her we'd like to order some dessert.  We watch her walk back and forth, past us another 5 or 6 times before I call her again, and instead of acknowledging me, she holds up a finger and walks away.  I'm normally very patient and I understand she's busy with her 6 tables, but a box.  Just drop off a box.  She finally does after giving me the finger (index, not middle.  boy that would have been icing on the cake!) along with our check...guess we're NOT getting dessert then.  By this point I've had it.  I put one of my many gift cards I have for karyns (because my family all knows how much I *used* to love this place) in the check bill and my boyfriend tells me to go get the car and he'll continue to wait to be ignored, because I might just loose it.  While I'm walking to the car, I totally forget where we've parked so it takes me a good 10 mins to find the car, after which my boyfriend calls me and said he just walked out because he was tired of waiting.  There was about twice our bill on the card and we just left it there because it's not like we're going to come back to use it.  We were there over 2 and a half painful hours.  Awful awful experience.  We don't get out as often as we'd like, so we were hoping to have a nice date night.   So, I have two other gift cards with about $150 left on them if anyone would like to sit forever and get crappy food.  I sure as heck am not going to go back.",0.2103,0.828,0.088,0.085,0.5105000119706004

On the left is the where you order food and the market type area and the right is a dining area with the tables set (looks like a restaurant set up). Since I was meeting a friend to dine in for lunch, I went to the right. I had no idea it was a Panera structured place where you order at the counter and your food is brought to you. Waited awkwardly for someone to seat me and then after doing some people watching, I figured out that I should have gone to the left side to place my order. Not a big deal - just wish there was some sort of sign or employee there to let me know what to do. When I went to go order, the two employees behind the counter clearly saw me and my friend, but didn't acknowledge us. I figured it was because they weren't supposed to take orders. We probably waited a few minutes before going to the customer service desk and asking where to order. We got redirected to where we were and after another minute, the employee decided to take our order. Again, not a big deal - just a teeny bit irked that we were not given any attention to for awhile. I ordered the Swedish crepe. Probably came out after 25-30 minutes. Not only was it aesthetically pleasing, but it was absolutely delicious! The sauce and flavored meshed perfectly and it was hard to believe a vegan (and gluten free!!) meal could be that yummy. I also tried my friend's Wild Rice Medley which was also a great mix of flavors. If the dishes weren't so good, I would be complaining a lot more about paying $15 for such a small portion.

She came to us, apologized, asked us to seat and relax that the food will come and we can pay after. The food came in the opposite order. So the fresh squeezed juice we got at the end. Our table was packed with plates and the workers will come by and ignore it. So we put them in a table next to us in order to make room for next orders, dessert etc. We had a great time laughing at all this. By the time we wanted to pay we went up to the cashier tried to explain everything that had happened before and also about our coupon, which he (another cashier) again didn't understand. He saw in our faces we would leave if he didn't just take de 20$ off the order as per the coupon and we didn't care how! So he did it and we left.  After all this you might wonder why I give them 4 stars. I do too, but we laughed so much at the whole mess and the food was great...

2015-06-14,3.0,"On a random whim trying to decide what to have for lunch, my friend had the brilliant idea of returning to one of his favorite vegan restaurants...Karyn's! He decided to take the plunge and go for the Sunday lunch buffet. Obviously I couldn't be left behind, and so, I took the plunge and went for it too. We were told that they typical rotate out a few items during their lunch buffets but there are also a couple of dishes that are staples.  My favorites: Squash spaghetti (amaaaaazing), tomato basil pizza bites (a very interesting ""dough"" but also very good), kale salad with creamy mushroom soup (flat out one of the best kale salads I've ever had), a mint chocolate dessert bite, and the vegan ice cream! So the chocolate sauce that comes with the ice cream is quite strange but the ice cream itself is delicious.  Other favorites: any of their smoothies! We sampled three different ones and all were absolutely fantastic. I would stop by just for a smoothie actually.  Empanadas were so-so. I think I prefer non-vegan empanadas. I also didn't care too much for the flatbreads. The toppings were good but the gluten-free bread wasn't my favorite. I wasn't a fan of the glass noodles or the biscuits with gravy either - I think they make it out of the same gluten-free bread as the flatbreads. I would totally recommend coming for the buffet. You get to try a little bit of everything and sample a good variety of vegan foods. If you don't like one thing, you can just eat more of the stuff you like! Of note, the buffet is VERY small because each item is a small little bite and will run you close to $20.  Service - Awesome! I wish I got the name of the girl working the buffet that lunch. She said she was pretty new but she was so nice and super helpful with explaining all the dishes, especially for someone who has never eaten a vegan meal in her life and needs meat all the time.",0.9968,0.758,0.198,0.043,0.5741774891774892

It's Chicago, and 2. They used great ingredients. Worth the price to me. I also accidentally ingested some gluten from one of their samples, but that was my own fault for not checking the menu. The sample I did have of the veggie soup (not gluten free) was one of the best soups I'd ever tasted. I had the raw speghetti and ""meat""balls here, which was great, the Original Bacon (a little tough, but good), and some almond crackers. Paired it with a freshly made green juice. All delicious.

It is quite the inconspicuous restaurant, which made me feel like I found a gold mine. The place is pretty much segmented in two. One side is more grocery store looking and where you order food. The other side is more of a sit down restaurant with beautiful dim lighting and an intimate setup. The food was great and my friend was so excited because of all the options she had. I ordered a gluten free hummus flatbread and then got a piña colada vegan ice cream.  They were good. The flatbread had a dense bread and it tasted like those healthy flat English muffins. The hummus had a great flavor to it. I tasted olives and garlic. It looked small on the plate but I was actually full. The piña colada ice cream was awesome. It was a yellow soft serve. You can taste the difference between vegan ice cream and non-vegan. However, the difference isn't so bad. There is a grit to the ice cream and I have to say I didn't mind it.

I get you need to make a profit, but the ppl who need it most are shut out.  I just have a dream of the everyday masses having an affordable $5 organic green juice.   The sad thing is I ask owners a and employees in person why it's so expensive and they say it's the labor involved. (Green star with kale, etc). I understand that organic produce is more expensive because I juice myself, but come on... You're paying them $10/hr to juice produce that is bought in bulk, using a $600/700 juicer which was a one time cost.  I am vegan myself so I understand the difficulties, but just stop making veganism a BUSINESS!!! But rather make it the lifestyle u so preach without selling the items at the store at 3-4 times the price. Instead, Teach HOW to cook, how to do enemas, how to juice, where to find organic produce for cheap, and how to switch to an organic raw lifestyle when you're struggling with the switch, etc.  I just wish someone had the mentality of long-term. I think the how-to's are the most important aspects of the vegan culture, and while making that American dollar is always priority 1, it doesn't really contribute to others wanting to participate in a way of life when it feels like a north shore fad.   Although this might seem negative on the forefront, id prefer it to be constructive criticism.   We need to be TAUGHT, not SOLD.

It's very heavy, so you may want to balance with another dish on the menu, but the flavors are incredible. Pad thai - Delicious! I love the taste of the curry. Salmon roll - My second favorite! I could not stop eating the roll. The pate was phenomenal. Enchilada - FAVORITE! It was a special, so if they offer it GET it. ,It's very heavy, but i LOVE the flavors. (Check out my photos attached for this and many of the dishes. Falafel - delish Dessert: Fondue for two: Delicious! I love the fondue dip, and it's great for sharing. Tiramisu Cheesecake: The date lady fingers were a bit hard, but i loved the flavors in the other layers. Carmel fig crepe: It was too sweet for me, but my friend loved it. Curry ice cream: I didn't get it, but the waitress let me try it and what she told me was exactly what i thought. It's very interesting for one bite, but too intense for an entire dish. Soft serve: Vanilla & Strawberry- I loved both, but was obsessed with the vanilla. I can't wait to try everything else on the menu, especially the sunday brunch!",0.9983,0.648,0.287,0.065,0.6703455198647507

2014-02-15,1.0,"I had the strangest experience at Karyn's Raw last night, Valentine's Day 2014. My boyfriend made a reservation for 8:15 and I was very excited to eat here as I've enjoyed a few carry out meals from Karyn's cooked.  We arrived and then waited. The restaurant is very very small. As in, only 8 or so tables. We could see one waiter bumbling around, but he never acknowledged us. Finally I had to catch him as he walked by and say ""excuse me, we've been standing up here for 20 minutes now."" No apology from him, just a blank stare  He runs away again and now we are left waiting, awkwardly inside this very small restaurant with our very puffy winter coats. During this time, we realized that everyone looked miserable and most were not eating. This should have been our warning. After another 10 minutes he finally seats us and then scurries away again. No introduction, no welcome, no apology for the 30 minute wait (by the way, there were 3 tables open and ready during this wait. It was strictly a service issue).  We tell each other that we will give them 15 minutes to take our order, or else we are leaving. Thankfully we didn't wait that long though because after looking around at the miserable couples, my boyfriend caught one of the other patron's eye.   ""Get out while you still can"" - warned the man next to us. His date nodding in agreement.   Then the people from the other table next to us chimed in- ""We've been here since 7:30 and haven't gotten a single thing to eat."" The woman said. I looked at their empty tables, topped only with water.  It was 9 PM by this point.  Grateful, and sad for the poor people that had already committed to this place, we grabbed our stuff and ran out the door. Honestly, I bet the waiter didn't even notice we were gone for another 20 minutes.  I wonder if anyone got anything to eat at Karyn's last night.",-0.7937,0.806,0.09,0.104,0.5264458090928679

2013-09-01,5.0,"Visiting Chicago, which isn't a city known for it's vegan food, and so happy to have found this place! (Thanks, Yelp) I was able to grab a table outside, and the server was friendly and pretty knowledgeable about the food as well, which is certainly a plus in a  raw vegan restaurant, which generally have pretty impressively complicated foods. Since I'm on vacation and have no plans for the day outside of ""walk around Chicago"", I go absolutely off the rails and order an appetizer with lunch. WHAT? ""Who does that?"", you ask? Who has two thumbs and is halfway through a Yelp review? This guy. The appetizer was two almond patty sliders. They have an incredibly fresh dill pickle relish that comes on the side and they are topped with mustard seeds. Obviously, these seeds have a been seasoned and softened to some degree, but it's a really interesting and tasty deconstruction of the standard slider, having the mustard be a solid ingredient is a new experience. Then the entree showed.  The Portobello Napoleon was 100% beautiful. Really well presented (two stacked portobello mushroom caps topped with a colorful medley of medium chopped tomatoes, olives, and magic) It was beautiful enough to take a picture at first, and then there was even a burst of bright yellow when I cut through it. (Is that polenta? Almond based? I have no idea. I should have asked. It doesn't matter.) This entree was DELICIOUS. It was ""sit and close your eyes and mmmmm to yourself"" delicious. It was ""eat it slower so never in my life will I no longer be eating this lunch"" delicious.  No dessert, juice, or smoothie for me, (what am I, an animal? This is LUNCH) I had so much food between those two courses that I couldn't have another bite. I left feeling incredibly satisfied and had a great time walking through Chicago and a great weekend. I've returned to Los Angeles, and mostly things are good, though a small sad part of me stills lingers, yearning for a time in my life when I was eating the Portobello Napoleon.",0.9963,0.758,0.199,0.043,0.5755084346547761

Not a problem!   We started with the cheese plate.  I don't know how vegan cheese is made, but this stuff was delicious.  Multiple flavors, excellent crackers, which we ran out of and Jenny immediately replenished. Falafel sandwich which was wonderful.   Arugula salad, which in my opinion, was the weakest of the dishes.  I'm not a fan of raw onion unless it's cut into very thin slices, which this wasn't.  For me the onion was a little overpowering.  But the arugula tasted fresh and delicious. Mushroom dish was excellent.  A little heavy on the olives, but I like olives.  By this point we were filling up and had to save some room for dessert, which did not disappoint. Dessert was the tiramisu, which I thought was much better than many of the ""normal"" tiramisu's I've had.  All in all it was a wonderful meal.

The best thing about the food is that unlike at other place, you will be eating something that actually helps your body heal.  If you are new to raw, you might want to take it slow and order something easy digestible. You would probably want to avoid nutty dishes as nuts are harder to digest than veggies and seeds.  Here is my top two picks: Pad Thai: Coconut meat noodles and sprouts mixed in a delicious curry sauce. I always order some extra cilantro since I really like this herb. Rice medley: Wild rice, barley, avocado, herbs. Don't worry both rice and barley are sprouted so they won't be hard to digest.  My favorite soups are see weed, tortia and mushroom. Creamy and very delicious. And if I feel like having a desert in 20 minutes I will get Karyn's raw vanilla ice cream (soy free!) with fresh raspberries on top. There is a great desert menu but don't be scared to ask for your favorite combinations.

2012-09-16,3.0,"After having such great experiences at Karyn's on Green and Karyn's Cooked, I decided to go to Karyn's Raw Bistro on this trip. The Bistro is part of Karyn's Fresh Corner in Lincoln Park, which consists of a healing center, raw foods store/cafe, and a raw restaurant. From the website, the restaurant looks very nice so I had expected the equivalent of Pure Food and Wine or Elizabeth's Gone Raw, but alas, it wasn't of that caliber. The restaurant was connected to the raw foods store and while it did look like a nice restaurant inside, it was definitely not an upscale raw fine dining restaurant like Pure or Elizabeth's. When we arrived, we were seated at a table for two. There was a couple drinking a bottle of wine by the door so I was hoping they had a nice wine selection. Unfortunately, I was informed that they do not serve alcohol and that the couple had brought their own.  Bummer.  As I glanced at the drink menu, the first thing I noticed were that many of the shakes and juices had honey in them. So I glanced up at the window to double check and sure enough, it stated ""raw vegan gourmet."" So why would they use honey?  This is really starting to bother me. First, Pure Food and Wine, now Karyn's?!  If you are going to call your restaurant vegan, just use agave nectar.  I don't know why that is so hard.  Anyway, I ordered a Summer Cooler juice and an appetizer of Sliders as we continued to peruse the menu. I was very happy with the Summer Cooler as it was a refreshing mix of fresh carrot, apple and lemon juices. It was delicious.  We continued to look over the menu for a while before our appetizers arrived. There was only one waitress working the entire restaurant. Granted the restaurant is really small, but there were at least seven full tables to serve so service was extremely slow.  The sliders arrived very nicely presented on a white plate with lettuce and tomatoes in the middle and a bowl of cucumbers on the side. The ""sliders"" were actually savory almond patties with sun dried tomatoes over top of a raw bread and topped with a tomato. In between the patty and bread was a red mustard that was really tasty. Together, the flavors meshed well though I did find the dish to be a little dry. Even though the mustard was really good, the dish either needed more of the mustard or a heavier sauce.  The cucumber mixture with coriander seed paired very well with the patties as well. For my entree I ordered empanadas, while Zach ordered the basil scented ravioli (the only non-vegan entree on the menu).  My empanadas arrived nicely presented as well as they were stacked in the middle of the plate with onions on top and garnishes and sauces on each corner. I was very impressed with the fact that they really looked like fried empanadas even though they hadn't been cooked at all!  Though they were small, they were very rich and tasty.  The outside pastry dough was made of flax and sunflower seeds along with corn. On the inside, they were filled with this amazing ""three pepper chorizo,"" which was peppers, walnuts and shitake mushroom along with chili spice mixed together into a surprisingly meat-like filling. It was topped with onions that had been marinated in soy sauce and paired with these wonderful sauces -- one was a cilantro salsa verde and the other was a chocolate mole sauce. Altogether, it was truly delicious. Zach's dish was pretty good though not as good as mine. He got the basil scented ravioli. The ravioli was made of root vegetable stuffed with macadamia whipped creme and dressed with an olive marinara sauce. I found the ravioli to be tasty, but, unfortunately, I couldn't try it with the sauce as it was made with honey.  He liked my dish better. After waiting 20 minutes for them to clear our plates after we finished, we finally ordered dessert. We ordered the Tiramisu Cheesecake. It looked beautiful as it was three layers stacked high with cacao nibs and a raspberry on top. On the bottom were lady fingers made of dates and coconut meat; the middle layer was a whipped macafe-infused cream, which is a root vegetable; and the top was a chocolate mousse.  While we enjoyed the lady fingers and mousse, the middle layer had an odd taste that seemed somewhat sour and didn't go well with the other flavors. I was pretty disappointed with this dish. All in all, I think that while Karyn's does a nice job with her raw dishes, they need to significantly improve on their service. We ended up being at the restaurant for close to two hours because the service was so slow. They are priced less than Pure and Elizabeth's with the entrees around $14 each and the desserts around $9 each.  Our total bill was about $75 with tax and tip so it was considerably less than other more upscale raw restaurants.

2012-09-06,1.0,"This was not an easy 1 star rating for me to make, because I've been a loyal Karyn's Raw fan since 2008 when I first caught a glimpse of the insanely youthful-looking and ultra-healthy Karyn doing a segment on the news and thinking I must check Karyn's out.   At first I greeted with everything I could ask for of incredibly delicious raw vegan meals that made me believe I could convert to veganism so easily and I eventually did pursue.  The service was welcoming and accepting to all those willing to embrace a healthy lifestyle.  I grew goals in my little brain of maybe taking raw cooking classes, buying the overpriced weedgrass every week, doing a cleanse, having fancy dinners here whenever out-of-towners came in.  I had visions.  Karyn was often there and happy to see me, even though, she would never bother to remember me, at least she had the energy to be nice.  I thought Karyn's may help find the right path to a virtuous life. And for a while it was good and, even, great at times.  I went out of my to come here for the food and would convince friends (friends who were broke) to come and see how good healthy food could be and for the longest time people loved in, but never loved the prices.  But, I still thought it was a worthwhile cause so I kept coming back and supported this place which I may have foolishly believed held the same values I had. I must declare, the food is still good and it never disappointed me, BUT, that is where it ends.  The service is now TERRIBLE and I've been in denial for quite some time and gave them a few more chances to hit a homerun to no avail.   The first inking I had was in the Summer 2011 after a bit of a hiatus from Karyn's Raw.  I kept going on to my friend moving from N.C. to Chicago about how great this place was and how she might want to apply for a job here, because, it'd be a great healthy, clean environment to work in.  She was only 18 and had solid work experience, working since she 12 (I know it's illegal in some places, but she was divorced from her parents and needed to make a living).  The person at the counter rudely told her to talk to a young lady in the yoga room.  So I checked the yoga and saw a girl there and asked her for an app and she seemed nice and asked if it was for me and said, ""no"" and pointed to my friend.  The girl clearly scuffed at my friend (I assumed it was her pinkish hair) and relunctantly gave her a app.  I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Women when she tried to shop on Rodeo drive dressed as a hooker and the clerks were rude to her.  This women was expecting too much for a minimum wage job.  To top it off, every person behind the counter was either an immigrant or the ""angry-at-the-world"" *&Tch that was the first one to be rude to my friend.  They never called her back. Back to that ""angry-at-the-world"" lady behind the counter, in a spontaneous move to get a drink at Karyn's late one night, my fiance and I, got to Karyn's 20 mintues before closing.  That same lady was there and when we walked in her face read ""GET OUT! HOLY MUTHERFUCKA of GOD, I Need to clean!"" So I tried to order the Un-Chocolate Shake and my fiance the Green Dream, I mean they are only $9.99 each so it might be worth for that girl to be nice.  She tried to talk me out of the shake, she said she had something better and scope some bottom of the barrel crap out of a machine and told me to try it.  It was GROSS, but she wasn't letting buy what I wanted, probably because it was too much work for her or she just cleaned the thing that would make my shake.  So I ordered something else to accomodate this fussy lady and she tried to talk me out of that, but some other immigrant worker chimed in that he would make it for me.  So my fiance got his drink which was nice and warm some how (supposed to be refreshing but it wasn't) and he threw it away after a few sips.  I don't know what's going on here, but to not hire my friend and hire someone like this is clearly a mistake.  I get the impression the workers aren't treated well. The final straw was our last visit a few months ago.  We decided to eat at the restaurant and before we've had trouble with a certain waitress/greeter who comes off as bossy.  We decided if we saw her, we'd run.  So we get inside the restaurant and it's as empty as the Artic, the greeter isn't there and we were nervous the infamous waitress would pop her head out.  Some kid was playing in the curtains behind the podium and lo and behold the one waitress we didn't want to see is working that night ALONE and apparently babysitting.  Last time we were there she was too busy doing her homework to offer good service.  Anyways, she rushed us and had an irritated tone that whole time like we were interrupting her.  The food took forever, she brought over the wrong drink and it was a pain getting that cleared up with her.  Karyn did show up in the middle of our meal and asked how everything was and by duress we said it was ok.",0.9977,0.762,0.164,0.073,0.5460576408610118

Olive domineered the plate and not liking olive, it was hard for me to eat. But I eat all the ravillo, only coating them in the red sauce quickly for taste. My note is to change the name of the dish to ravioli and olives or tone it down a bit. I want to leave on a good note, so I ordered the cheesecake. It was really, really good. A little too much for someone on fenugreek like crazy. The serivce was less then good. My waiter seemed like she did not want to talk.

""My friend and who have been regulars at Karyn's cooked decided to try out Karyn's Raw for brunch today (11/27).

So my friend and I decided to stay, have brunch, etc... Once the bill came, there was question b/c our tab came to around $70 (which includes 2 wheat grass shots). We were both confused b/c we distinctly were told that brunch was $12 a person. Our server was in training and spoke to her trainer (veronica)? With that said, we also had $5 off Sunday Brunch coupon (that we received from Karyn's cooked). I asked our server if we could use these and she told us no. I asked to speak to someone and our server said she was new and there was no one available to speak to us. So with my experience are three issues: 1) Told the wrong price for brunch (this is even more of a concern b/c there was not a menu/pricing/ or signage anywhere that we could reference, so it is the word of two people verses the server. Which we brought this up that both of us were told $12 not 29.95). 2) Our coupon, which specifically says for brunch (and not expired) was not able to be used 3) We were told there was no one we could speak with concerning our issue. Myself and my friend are very upset over this b/c our experience was ruined. And we were planning on shopping in the store and booking services at the center, but instead we were so annoyed we are looking to go elsewhere.

I was shocked to see a sign that said that Ann Wigmore, a famous raw author, said that the nuts they use might be OK because they are soaked. Maybe, for people who are just somewhat sensitive, but definitely not for people who are allergic. Entrees are marred by overpowering use of raw onions and aren't filling enough to justify the price. Honestly, raw vegan food doesn't have to taste this way. I am no longer a raw vegan, but I sometimes eat raw vegan because there are restaurants that do it so well, making dishes that are fresh and unique. This is not one of them.

2011-09-20,2.0,"I just have to start off by saying, this place isn't for me. So, really, this review is specifically from someone that tried something new and did not like it. I say this because I think this place is extremely creative in what they offer and how they go about making it. If this is your cup of eat, then I think you would have a good meal here. Unfortunately, I think it only appeals to a limited demographic. All the rest will probably come here and feel closer to what I felt. The nachos were good at the beginning, but the more I ate, the less I seemed to like them. The raw pizza was the same way, only a little better. You have a few bites and you're like, ""ok, this is alright."" After a few more mouth fulls, you're wondering what exactly you have in your mouth. The empanadas also followed suit, but were a little better than the pizza. Basically, share everything and you'll only eat enough to think about how different of an experience this was... instead of concentrating on how you wish you were eating something else. The good news is you'll walk away full. The bad news is that in like 2 hours you'll be howling from hunger and wondering why you're feeling so empty after just eating. I can't agree with paying for a meal that's a little on the pricey side, or any meal for that matter, if I'm going to feel hungry soon after. I'll leave you with this. Come here and get a shake or smoothie and a dessert. These are the best things here. This goes double for the desserts. Vegan and raw desserts, I don't know how or why, but they are really delicious. And Karyn's has great desserts. It is also pretty sweet that they have a parking lot, since that part of Halsted can be difficult for finding parking.",0.9766,0.768,0.143,0.088,0.544179285626654
2011-09-05,3.0,"Hello everyone .  Let me be honest here.  Whether you decide you wish to have the all you can eat salad bar or choose to dine in at the cafe I highly recommend this place for your skin and hair and nails.  The only drawback I have noticed is if you choose the all you can eat salad bar you are forced to choose from what they have put out for you already.  The drawback is sometimes it can be very very salty and I am someone who loves salt and spice and sour BUT the items at the salad bar are not always creatively prepared.  I still give this place a high rating because you can still pick out a lovely vegan meal they have premade for you and it costs around $12 but it is highly satisfying and you will leave so full it is as if you had a five course meal.  They use a lot of raw nut ingredients so do not come here if you suffer from nut allergies.  I know they use raw almonds,  raw walnuts, pumpkins seeds, sesame seeds and poppy seeds so there again not for those who have teeth issues.  BUT i have never left here feeling hungry and the fresh juices here are very pricey but they taste smooth going down so you know they used 110% fresh organic veggies and fruits to give you that perfect taste all the time.  If you choose to dine in get their House specialty salad for it is not salty it's just decadent and their chocolate mousse is so rich you will not notice it is a vegan offering.  I was given a sampling of their raw cheesecakes but I felt they tasted more like almond butters and they did not have that firm cheese cake feel so I do not recommend their cheesecake unless you simply like cheese spreads.  Please realize most of their base ingredients use nuts so if you are not a fan do not bother.  The chocolate mousse hands down is so filling and rich you will not notice you have just ordered something so exquisitely healthy.  If you are bored while waiting for your food they have many items in their store so you can browse and sample some granola or some snack they will have as testers.  They have aromatic sea salt for bathing and oregano oils which is a natural elixir for digestive tract issues or inflammation anywhere in the body.  If you have a stubborn infection or health disorder oregano oil is the best alternative to return your body to health.  There is also a spa in the back so you can schedule an appointment for an oxygen bath or a facial.  Organic cosmetics are also available to purchase.  Some of the items here are costly but it is one of the few places in Chicago where you can pick up a healthy raw organic meal and go shopping as well.",0.9945,0.809,0.138,0.054,0.502746657136901
2011-08-31,5.0,"Update: I am now vegan & gluten free.  Been vegan for 3 years and the food was super good.  Honestly do not know how they stay in business's though as there were only 4 tables all night.  Food was very good but beware if you are allergic to nuts you cannot eat here.  I struggle with cashews and 98% of the menu had cashews in it.  I got the 2 things that didn't and they were still good.  Here's what we got: Appetizer : spring rolls - they were super fresh and the sauce was delicious Dinner - the ""salmon"" roll.  Good tasting, very filling.  Wife got the portobello dish and she isn't vegan and thought it was very good. Dessert: I had the coconut ice cream- it was super good; ice cream was clearly freshly made and tasted that way.  It included these gluten free cookies that were awesome and strawberries.  My wife had the moose which said was very thick, deep chocolate taste and delicious Drinks: ginger ale - super gingery, smelled amazing and tasted very good.  My wife had a juice and that was also very good. Overall it was a good dinner.  The only complaint I had was after dinner I went next door to buy those cookies because they were awesome.  Unfortunately I found out they contained almond butter which I'm horrible allergic too.  At least I think I am as I've not had it in 3+ years.  Thankfully I did not have a reaction because either I'm no longer sensitive to it or the tiny amount did not effect me.  Anyway someone who is allergic to nuts should know they have almonds in there.  The waitress clearly was wrong as they do have nuts in them; beware. Besides that mess up the food was good and I'd go back.   Here's my review from 2011: Only go here if your vegan, gluten free or want to try something new.  My wife and I are not vegan but it sounded interesting so we went there for lunch on Saturday and thought it was delicious.  We used our  restaurant.com  coupon & got $25 off.  I had the spinach pizza which was delicious!  My wife had the tamales and they were very good.  All the food is vegan and most of it's gluten free.   The food was fresh, tasty, clever and we will absolutely be returning plus trying her other restaurants",0.9988,0.651,0.275,0.075,0.6667662738496071
2011-08-12,2.0,"I had tried Karyns Raw a few times years ago, and after my recent positive experience with Cousin's Incredible Vitality, decided to give them another chance. Here's the thing - there are so many wonderful rich flavorful things to add punch to a raw vegan dish - homemade tomato paste, the wide variety of fresh herbs like basil and dill and rosemary and cilantro, lemon juice, garlic, etc.  I could go on forever. So why the hell is it that whenever I eat something from Karyn's Raw, all I can taste is salt?  Don't get me wrong - I'm not saying that Karyn's is high sodium.  In fact, you can eat quite a bit of salt and eat very salty food and still get under 2000mg of sodium per day, as long as you eat nothing that's preserved and everything fresh.  I'm not criticizing Karyn's on how healthy it is - I'm criticizing their palate and lack of imagination. Imagine this.  You have a plate put in front of you.  A big pile of fresh alfalfa sprouts, nuts, seeds, avocado.  It looks amazing.  You take a bite, and it hits you.  SALT.  You can't even taste any of the stuff on your plate.  All you can taste is salt.   Maybe you'll go into the take out section afterwards, sample a few things.  Dehydrated onions?  PURE SALT.  All the nut butters?  SALT.    And I feel that I have to add this - I am a salt fiend.  I love salt.  So if it's too much salt for me, it's probably too much for most people.  And it would be less offensive if I could just taste something else in the food, but I can't. Add that to the weird snobbish vibe (the first time I came here a staff member said ""you know this is raw, right?  Are you sure you want to eat here?"") and the unnecessarily high prices (you know they only charge that much because it's trendy and there's little competition for raw vegan food) and there's no way I can give the place a good rating.  Sorry Karyn's Raw - I love the concept, and love the ingredients (hell, after one meal I felt things start to move along you-know-where before I even finished eating) but you haven't learned how really utilize everything nature has to offer and make good tasting food.",0.9854,0.829,0.129,0.041,0.522158445419315
2011-07-25,4.0,"I remember a program I saw on tv about Buckminster Fuller, the inventor of the geodesic dome. He drew a square on the chalkboard and asked the audience what they saw. Duhviously, everyone said a square. But then he asked, ""What about the space outside the square?"" His point being that people are conditioned to automatically see the boundaries in life.  I know, nice random story Professor Petunia.* But I think Karyn and Karyn's Raw really explores the limits of cuisine. Full disclosure, my partner and I are meat eaters and Some Like It Hot just isn't an entertaining movie to us, but the way we enjoy our meals (in taste and temperature). But we were feeling experimental. The portion sizes are small. This is ok, because we wanted to sample a bit and we were skittish about everything in general. We had: Hummus Purée of cauliflower and red pepper served with flax crackers and veggies. The pepper and flax saved it from being totally bland. I'd skip it. Nachos Dehydrated corn tortilla chips with guacamole, sweetened sour cream, black olives, and jalepenos. Who doesn't love nachos? Even room temperature ones? Very good.  Basil Ravioli Basil pasta with macadamia whipped cream. So good, I wish I had it in arms length right now. Spinach Pizza  Spinach, cheese, tomato basil sauce. Since it's room temperature Id liken it more to an open face sammy or flatbread. The ingredients played well off each other. Tiramisu Cheesecake Creamy cheese with date lady fingers. A must order! The shining star of the meal. And although it seems so relatively straightforward, this dessert and the Nachos were the most inventive and playful we tried. Our server was good and knowledgable.  *I'd make a cute teacher (cue Van Halen song). If you're vegan or on a raw food diet make dining here a homework project.

Onto the food.  We weren't starving, thanks to our cucumber martini's we'd had earlier, so decided we'd skip appetizers, and move onto the main event. I had the Basil Scented Ravioli, my husband, the Portobello Napoleon.  I liked them both.  The Ravioli were really interesting, using  turnip instead of regular flour, and while I can't explain it well, it seemed doughy and pasta like.  And, they serve the perfect amount. The Portobello was a color extravaganza! The mushroom was ""cooked"" in citric acid, so it was nice and tender, and had oodles of veggies and herbs surrounding it.  It was tasty, and one of the few things on the menu I feel i can actually attempt to try myself.   For dessert, had the chocolate mousse... Hell YES!  I'm SO glad we saved some room, and tried this.  I'll be back and get it again.   Yes Karyn's Raw is pricey.  For dining out though, using organic ingredients, preparing raw food, and with the nice space, I'm totally fine with that.  I browsed the store next door, and they have a lot of the same things on the menu for the same price.  I don't think I'd purchase anything to go, but noticed they have a Veggie cooking prep class - would love to take it and attempt to make some of their creative dishes.

Karyn's Raw Vegan. I'm no stranger to vegetarian cuisine... in fact I love it.  But Karyn's serving sizes are a dark comedy.  I endorse that the typical serving in the U.S. reeks of gluttony, but Karyn has reached the other extreme. There are no extraordinary ingredients present... at least it does not TASTE like there are.  There are no staples like rice or black beans to fill out the dish present.  However they were quite generous in fixing the price to satisfy their own craving.  Don't get me wrong, I'm pretty comfortable flexing my plastic for meals and don't mind tipping 20% by default, but there's a limit. I'm all for pretty food, but we actually left Karyn's HUNGRIER than when we arrived. Hell I would have loved to have the salt and pepper shaker there on the table to get some sort of satisfaction out of the meal. The reason that this review received a single star is because the wait staff was quite friendly, welcoming and strangely apologetic well in advance of our dinner party being smacked by the reality of what they were to serve.

The second time I went was for Brunch today.  My friend and I showed up and were told we were having the buffet.  No menus, no options for drink.  In fact, we ordered the same coconut smoothie as the first visit and never received it.  So... we bellied up to the buffet.  This was the most awkward buffet I think I've ever been to.  We were not allowed to serve ourselves and had to wait until each person before us went down the entire buffet line before we were greeted and served each item one by one by the same guy (also our waiter who forgot to give us our smoothies.)  The entire process seemed to take forever and was just very uncomfortable and strange.  The crepes were really good, but the gazpacho was incredibly spicy, the guacamole was good but teetered on a bit too spicy as well... and I'm a fan of spicy foods!  My friend tried the tabbouleh and said it was very vinegary.  A few of the items were LOADED with green olives.  I really enjoyed the pina coladas, even though they were so packed with ice that it took quite a bit of effort to get an entire sip out of the glass without spilling all over.  I also liked the chocolate desserts that were offered, but my friend was not a fan of them at all.  Neither of us like the mango ice cream (it tasted like it was jam-packed with sugar,) and we both thought the strawberry ice cream was 'meh.'   After re-reading this review, it sounds like I'm a total snatch, and I'm sorry if I'm coming off like one, but I really feel like 75% of the food there, I could've made better at home.  I'll give it one more shot just because I want to like it so much.  Right now I'm not too impressed.  Oh, and the hefty $70 bill for the two of us wasn't too pleasing either.",0.9945,0.787,0.163,0.05,0.561050230633564

2010-04-18,3.0,"A friend and I went because I had a gift card to ""Karyn's Raw Cafe.""  Whoops. We didn't realize until after we got our check for $75 that my gift card was only for the store/deli next door. It should have been more clear, but oh well. I wish they had honored the card, since it was clearly our first time, and it sort of soured the experience for me.  On the website when you click on ""Karyn's Raw Cafe"" it takes you to the menu for the juice bar and for the gourmet menu. Silly me assumed that because it was in the same location, it was all one place.  By the way, the ""salad bar"" looks really good on the menu online, but when we were there, it was just five tubs filled with various spreads. Once again, the website is VERY unclear. Do the ""spreads, dehydrated snacks, and and Other"" come with the salad bar? Okay, on to the food at the restaurant: We ordered the Sea Dim-Sum first, which was very tasty.  It was nicely displayed on top of cabbage. If you don't like avocado, then you won't like this because it is basically pureed avocado wrapped with nori. I love avocado, though. My friend really liked the ""Pacific Sauce"" (soy sauce with sesame seeds basically), but I thought it was a bit salty. Then we ordered the Cheese and Crackers, which came nice displayed with four nut cheeses and a bowl of dehydrated crackers. My main complaint was that it was SO SALTY. Even the crackers were salty. I went through many glasses of water.  But since our entrees took a while to arrive, I kept eating it... sort of like chips and salsa at a Mexican restaurant. The flavors of the ""cheese"" were good, though, and I enjoyed the variety (curry, basil, tomato, mushroom).  My friend really liked the nuts that were covered in some kind of sweet honey mix (she said it was like caramel). We also ordered the Mango Lassi Soup. I've been vegan for about ten years, so I've never had ""real"" Lassi. I was expecting it to be creamy, though. Unfortunately, it was filled with some kind of mango chutney (not just on top). So I didn't like the texture, It was creamy with chunks of onion and mango. It was also very tangy, as it was described as sweet & sour. Neither of us could finish the bowl, but I think that it was a flavor we just didn't like. I think other people might find it very tasty. For entrees, we ordered the Falafel and the Phad Thai. I asked the waitress for the least salty thing on the menu, and I was really craving something crunchy.  The Phad Thai was delicious.  It was made of coconut strips and vegetables covered in a creamy nutty dressing. If you're looking for ""noodles"" you won't find it, but I really enjoyed it. It was more like a salad. My friend's Falafel was also delicious. I had one bite, and it was very similar to falafel, except not fried. For dessert, I had the tiramisu and she had the apple with cinnamon ice cream. The ice cream was delicious, very light and bursting with flavor. My tiramisu was very heavy, and I couldn't finish it. It was some kind of chocolatey-cake made with dates, perhaps? It was just so heavy.  I've had raw desserts before that were light and fluffy, so I was a bit disappointed. When we left, I had a terrible stomach ache, probably from eating so much, and the dessert kind of settled in my stomach like a brick. Overall, I found most of the food to be extremely flavorful and fresh.",0.9957,0.787,0.146,0.067,0.5445776772247359

Some of it is great tasting and some is so so, but all is expensive.  I recently went with my guy who had never had ""raw food"" before and the server recommend the nachos (tortilla chips made with soaked and dehydrated corn, served with guacamole, cashew based sour cream, black olives, marinated red onions, and caramelized jalapenos). I second that recommendation (I've had them before), particularly for someone new to raw food as it's very accessible, and a good portion.  Unfortunately, he chose the sea dim sum, which he thought was ok but I really didn't like, too much avocado (wrapped in seaweed) that had started to go off. Blegh. The sopa de jardin, on the other hand, was declious.  For entrees I had the empanadas (flax and corn masa pastry dough stuffed with three pepper chorizo and house blend chili spice) and thought they were great, especially the accompanying salsa verde. The fella had the pasta primavera, made with zucchini noodles in a macadamia/pine nut sauce. I liked it, he was kind of iffy on it. It definitely is pretty light, so most would want at least an appetizer along with it. In general I think sharing is the best way to approach raw food since portion sizes are variable. For dessert we had the fig crepes, which I loved (boy thought they were a little under-sweet.) The crepes themselves our server explained are made from a mixture of coconut meat, flax, and agave that is dehydrated. Very cool. All in our our meal with tip (and sans drinks) was about $70, which for me is a special occasion price. The boy still felt hungry after and ended up buying a cookie at the cafe side. The cafe continues to offer great juices, smoothies and raw snacks but the cost really is out of control, even factoring in the quality of the ingredients. This is why they lose a star.  Unfortunately there are so few places in the city that offer green (vegetable based) juices and smoothies that I end up indulging at Karyn's much more than I should.  There really needs to be some competition in this arena!

The free parking lot started the night off in a great way. Seated quickly since we were the only 2 in the place, we got some menus and started researching. The menus could use some serious additions. The items were listed, but since they didn't have descriptions, you couldn't really be sure what you'd be getting. Since it's vegan, we knew that the ""pasta"" wouldn't really be pasta, but had no idea what it would be.  Also, though our server was super nice, we'd told her it was our first time, but when bringing out courses, she didn't offer any explanation to the ingredients.  We started with the sliders which was my favorite part of the meal. They were interesting, kind of meaty, and I'd like to tell you what was in them, but I don't know. I love mustard, though, and there was a very strong mustard flavor and a mix of textures that was nice, though very messy.  On the recommendation of the server, we ordered the empanadas and the pad thai. The empanadas were interesting, but the salt was crazily overpowering and I only had one before I gladly let my friend finish the other two. The salsa verde that came with the empanadas was nice though, with fresh, clean flavors.  The pad thai was disappointing on most accounts. My friend and I both agreed we were eating a pretty plate of underseasoned slaw. I expected a much stronger peanut flavor, but got nothing. Some of the veggies in the slaw were vaguely noodley, but the crunchiness ruined the illusion. Not a crowd pleaser all areound. Desserts saved the meal with a a tiramisu that tasted nothing like tiramisu, but was delicious and chocolatey tasting. The curry ice cream was interesting and I enjoyed it though my friend did not. The ""cookies"" that came with the curry were pretty sad, though, and didn't have much flavor to make up for their crumbly, grainy texture.  I tried to give this place the benefit of the doubt since I'm obviously not used to eating this kind of food. However, the prices, the service, the food and the atmosphere just didn't do much of anything for me.

Drizzled with a raw béchamel sauce and side of chipotle salsa  I would have preferred the béchamel sauce INSIDE the hush as opposed to on the inedible husk. *Curry Ice Cream- Exotic curry spice ice cream served with coconut cookies on a bed of pineapple carpaccio  This was the highlight. It was delicious, like an explosion of flavors in your mouth. But is ice cream vegan?  It tasted like ice cream. I'm so confused. *Caramel Fig Crepe- Sweet crepe shell filled with citrus essence crème, fresh figs, and candied pecans. Drizzled with a caramel yacon syrup  I will say it is on the expensive side. Even with my $25 gc it was still $50.00. $75.00 for dinner may not seem like a lot. But when you factor in the fact that the food is not even cooked, makes you wonder.

Seating for about 30 with white tablecloths and candles, but most people were in jeans and a sweater, so it was perfect for after work, or a casual dinner. The food was flavorful, if not a bit oversalted. I had the shitake carpaccio, which was decent. I also had the tamales and as far as the flavor goes, they were really good - some of the better tamales I've had. The texture, due to the fact that they were prepared with all raw ingredients, left a little to be desired. They were mush with vegetables inside. Great tasting mush, but mush. I also shared the falafel, and again, it tasted good, but was mush.  There is an adjoining cafe and shop as well as a wellness center, so this is a really great one-stop place for all things vegan, natural, and/or raw.

The sea dim sum appetizer is excellent but a fairly small portion.  However, the nachos are great and can serve 2-3 pretty well.

2009-04-20,4.0,"I am a meat eater. I enjoy the taste of chomping down on tuna, chicken, turkey, salmon... you get the idea. However I do have an open mind. When the very cool and vegan Nicoletta R asked me about doing dinner with her and her boyfriend Thane, I said yes. Then when she asked if I wanted to try Karyn's Raw... um.. sure? I've gone by a bajillion times, but really, a huge part of me looked at it and thought could I get a good meal out of there. I had said yes, but I had so much to discover and learn that night.  I met Nicoletta out for a drink or two earlier, perhaps to kills some time, to keep my mind open, so when we got to Karyn's Thane was waiting for us, but we forgot something. Our own drinks. Its BYOB y'all! And if you don't want to bring your own, they have several smoothies and non alcoholic drinks, but for us, I made a quick trip to Sam's which remedied our situation.  The situation on hand now was dinner. This is all vegan and raw, nothing cooked, so the warmest it will get is lukewarm or room temperature. Don't freak out. Don't get scared. Open your mind, your stomach will follow. We had ordered two starters and then our main courses. The nachos were a hit, the chips were dehydrated, with a crunchy texture, a slightly nutty and toasted wheat flavor, the rest was really good. Don't expect the plate covered with cheese and hot and steaming, this is the vegan version and I rather liked it. The sliders we ordered were... not that great. I think the problem we had is, if you are going to name it ""Sliders"" on the menu, perhaps there should be more than one? We finally discovered what the bun and the ""burger"" parts, it was okay. The sun dried tomato ketchup was good, the actually slider part was a little too bland and one note. I'd skip this one. Then the main courses, we had tamales, empanadas and pizza. I didn't try the pizza, but the tamales were good, served in the traditional corn husk, some good flavors going on and layered too. My empanadas were good, but honestly I loved the mole and the tomatillo salsa that came with it... I might have slammed them down, shot style of course, but some how I think that wouldn't have gone over that well. Finally dessert. I will say this now, with no hesitation, the chocolate mousse, you need to get. It was a richer chocolate pudding, but Bill Cosby doesn't have anything on this version. A slight nutty taste, but certainly a mouthful will make you think about an eternity on the hips. Our server was great. She was helpful and friendly and made sure we knew what we got as well as things to look out for. Vegans don't have honey, (See? Did you know that? Learned something new perhaps? Well.. I try...), however at Karyn's she does allow honey in some dishes, which our server was quick to point out to Nicoletta.  Is this a place where I would say I would come here every week? No. It was a treat to come here to try a different level of eating. These are passionate people, for one reason or another, who have given up meat, to take a different path and to go with what speaks to them as truth and what speaks to their heart as right. It certainly gave me a better understanding of what a vegan has to go through if they ever go out.

I eat lots of meat, but was open to trying something new and I wasn't disappointed at all. I ordered from the cafe side, the Square of Joy half sandwich ($5.99), which was incredible and very filling for only half a sandwich (also came with a small side of some sort of beet salad), and the Really Rare and Raw smoothie (Nutmilk, dates, banana, vanilla). At  $8.99 for the smoothie, it was pricey, but so worth it, although I don't think I will stop in for one on a regular basis which is why I'm knocking off one star. I was stuffed when I was done with the two things I ordered. I'm really looking forward to trying Karyn's for dinner over on the restaurant side, but in the meantime I know I'll definitely be back for lunch -- and to try out some of the cakes!

Her spiritual strength is sometimes taken wrong as she carries herself with an unusual amount of confidence. I think this comes with her great belief in what she does. Her dedication to the welfare of animals is paramount. She treats her own animals better than most people treat each other. Her dog ""Mitch"" has won many agility events, a lot of which has to do with the handler's ability to run along with their dog.

Renee C wanted to try this place for her birthday so we arrive on a Monday night to a completely empty dining room. Our server seemed pleasant enough and I wasn't getting that ""bad service vibe"" that I had learned is a problem for this restaurant. I order a wheat grass shot and a glass of frozen peach juice. The wheat grass was fabulous! It was the best I have ever had. The grassy flavour was very mild and it was very sweet, unlike shots I have had at other places. So then we order an appetizer, the ""Olive Oil Cured Sun-Dried Tomato Cheese Puree with Seasoned Celery"" and entrees. I get the ""garlic lovers pizza"" and Renee gets the ""Creamy Sea Wrap"" which is Avocado, Walnut Pate, Sweet Onion and Basil Wrapped in a Seaweed Crepe. While we waited I went to check out the other side, which is a shop and cafe. (interesting stuff, but things seemed VERY pricey)  Anyway, by this time, other people had filtered into the restaurant and suddenly I felt like our service was becoming less than ideal. The other people seemed like regulars and the server was practically fawning all over them, whereas we were getting the most bare minimum of attention. (and this is after we had said we had never been to the restaurant before!)  Well, the food arrives and Renee's is presented like sushi - and tasted quite a bit like it too, which was awesome. My ""pizza"" was nothing more than a garlic and olive salad over 4 triangular slices of gluten free bread. Tasty but come on - it is stupid to be calling that Pizza. How about ""Salad over Toast Points"" instead?  So after the experience I am pretty sure I could do the raw food diet for a few weeks. Um, maybe a week. OK - a day, I could definitely do a whole day.

Here's the story the way I see it...I made a call and went into Karyn's Raw 2 months before my event. Got it on their calendar (watched the girl write EVERYTHING down) and obnoxious manager shows me the Yoga room that will be set up for my event and tells me all sorts of other things.

We had a mixed group of omnivores, vegetarians, and vegans. Nobody was specifically on a raw food diet, but everyone was willing to try the place.  After we ordered it took a -really- long time for anything to come out. My dinner companions were getting a bit cranky. We had water, but that was it. Perhaps a little something to nibble on while we wait would have taken the edge off? Anyway, finally 2 shakes came out. Mine was amazing, and I'd say worth the wait. It was the ""Really Rare and Raw: nutmilk, dates, banana, vanilla."" I am definitely going to have to try to recreate that at home because $9 is a bit pricey. Two people at the table ordered the guacamole and chips, and both were delicious and filling, despite seeming initially like a small portion. The chips were very dense and slightly soft. I'm not sure what they were made of. (I also got to nab one of the ""Crimini Mushrooms Stuffed with a Nut Pate and Topped with a Light Gravy"" and thought it was really complex tasting and delicious.)  My entree was the ""Pasta Primavera"", which is made with zuchinni ""pasta"". It was yummy, though the pine nuts seemed a bit salty and were perhaps soaked in soy sauce? Not sure. What initially again seemed like too small of a portion turned out to be more than enough. Seriously heavy food. (Funny that we think of cooked food as heavier- but man, that much of mostly fresh veggies and nuts catches up with you.) Most of the table was just sort of okay with their food. Nobody raved except the two of us who ordered the primavera. The one who ordered the ""basil scented ravioli"" actually left half of it and I wound up taking it home (so I'll be trying that soon.) It had a bunch of olives in it, and I love olives. I am hopeful. We didn't have room for the amazing looking deserts (which we had been revved up to try because we hoped they'd be served quickly... they're already prepared and sitting in a class case in the juice bar area.)

2008-06-17,1.0,"FOOD: (3 stars) I started eating here when I went 100% raw (about a year ago), so I am grateful that Karyn's was around for that. The food is okay. It is a bit on the nutty side, though, and quite heavy. She uses a lot of Bragg's Liquid Aminos, which is not raw. It really does taste ""cooked"" which may help her de-tox students, or those who are newly raw. For much better raw food, however, go to Cousin's IV (on Irving Park). They have a wealth of salads and lighter dishes.  SERVICE: (0 stars) This is the main reason I almost no longer go to Karyn's. There are two sub-reasons: 1) They are WAY understaffed and very, very slow. Even though I was a regular for MONTHS, I never was treated like a valued customer. I had to wait in line for up to 10 minutes just to pay for a cookie or a bottle of water. 2) The managers (including Karyn) YELL at their staff! In front of customers! This is unacceptable, and quite the opposite of a ""raw"" and radiant attitude. I have gotten better service at just about every juice bar and health food restaurant in Chicago. (Try Doc's on Armitage or Kramer's Health on Wabash for excellent juice bar service.)  PRICE: (0 starts) All I can say is that Karyn is MONEY HUNGRY. Her items are often 10-20% more expensive than those at Whole Foods. Save your money and go to Life Spring on Clark for vitamins and supplements. It is offensive to the Chicago raw community that she charges up to three or four dollars more for the SAME items available at the stores of her competitors. This just makes raw people look bad. Her smoothies are 9 dollars, on average. Those of her competitors are around 5 or 6. How does that make sense? Her smoothies often are not even organic... If you are raw (or thinking of going raw), my advice is to look up recipes on  goneraw.com  and learn to make some of this stuff yourself. Do NOT let Karyn's represent the raw food movement. There are plenty of great raw restaurants (including Cousin's) across the country that have amazing food and great service to boot.  Nuff said.",0.9805,0.851,0.107,0.043,0.5228241758241757

The food is often well prepared and tasty, but expect to pay bank for your meals. Often you aren't filled up by one item or 2 or 3 or even 4 or 5.

It's wrapper is turnip, sliced paper thin and filled with a mixture of pureed nuts...the sauce, which is heavily reliant on olives, is really quite savory with an unexpected flavor not resembling basic tomato sauce.  Its nearer a salsa than a sauce.   2.  Delicious fruit smoothies that are frothy and delicate.  There's no extra sugary aftertaste or heaviness to them. 3. Creating an entire restaurant that serves ONLY raw food is commendable.  Raw diets are the most healthy kind of eating there is, and turning a bale of nuts, seeds, fruits and veggies into entrees and brunch takes a chemist and culinary genius.  Midwesterners are frightened by this type of food because it seems so foreign, but if you get over your ideas about what your eating and actually try it, some of it, like the cold summer soup with cashew 'sour cream' is excellent.  I think the woman behind this business is a courageous entrepreneur for trusting Chicago to sustain her dream. If your curious about this really go to the brunch because you can try everything they serve.  It's true I didn't like everything I tasted (the 'seed casserole' square disguised as a fudgey brownie), but some of it was really impressive.  I do wish there was more information for me to hear or read about what I was eating because the inventiveness and flavor of some of the foods was exquisite.   There were mini-'hamburgers' that seemed composed of a 'rye bread' bun sandwiching the freshest lettuce, red onion, tomato, and spicy mustard.  The guacamole was spicy and some of the best I've tasted.  There were flax seed triangle crackers that had dehydrated sweet, hot, and red peppers woven in and were quite delicious.  There were wild grain stuffed mushroom caps that burst with fresh, wholesome textures and on and on.   Don't let the other reviewers scare you off and go for brunch.",0.9979,0.759,0.196,0.046,0.6093302530802529

Sarcasm aside, I had the salad bar and was over a pound ($7.99 per pound for a 7-selection salad bar).  The food was decent, although raw foods always tend to taste the same to me after the first few bites.

2007-06-05,1.0,"i think this is, without a doubt, the worst dining experience i have ever endured.  my husband and i are both vegetarians and were extremely excited to try karyn's for our fifth wedding anniversary.  what a horrible mistake. AMBIENCE: we arrived and no one greeted us at the door.  there was only one other table of patrons and the rest of the place was deserted.  finally, a waitperson seated us... next to the front window that had a huge, drafty crack in it.  we moved our seat more toward the center of the restaurant.  throughout our meal, we *tried* to enjoy the jazz music playing overhead, but the kitchen was blasting some really loud hispanic/latino music, complete with horns.  every time the door swung open, you could hear it even more.  i asked the waitress, ""sounds like a party in there,"" and she just looked at me blankly. FOOD: holy mackerel, was that bad.  the salad was pretty much just slivered garlic for days.  mmm, romantic.  i had some essence of sea-something crepe [see, i'm adventurous] and it was like a piece of cardboard surrounding wallpaper paste and grass clippings.  inedible.  my husband had those awful little raviolis.  nasty.  covered with olives, too. OVERALL: it was so bad that i didn't even want to try dessert.  i just wanted to escape as fast as possible.  what a bummer.",-0.0173,0.761,0.128,0.112,0.6199404761904761
2007-06-02,1.0,"Gross... I went here with a vegetarian friend one week while I was on a raw food diet.  We sat and waited for menus for 10 minutes.  There were only 2 other customers in the joint...that should have been a sign.   First, the phone at the host stand rang this obnoxious, loud ring all throughout our stay and NOBODY ever answered it.  Also, the Mariachi music from the kitchen didn't exactly add anything to the ambiance... We were very intrigued by the menu and couldn't wait to try everything.  We started with the tomato cheese paste with bok choy...except that it wasn't bok choy, it was celery...when I asked the waitress about it she said they were out of bok choy.  I mentioned that I wouldn't have ordered it had I known that, having an aversion to celery...""oh"" was all she said.  We then ordered some garlic bread sticks, which, I'm convinced, were dirt and twigs glued together with paste... We also ordered the ""ravioli"" and the ""pasta primavera."" I put these in quotes because nothing about these dishes is either ravioli, or pasta-like.  Being a full blooded Italian , I resent the naming of these dishes.  The ""ravioli"" had olives smeared all over it, which was also not mentioned in the menu, otherwise my friend, who has an aversion to all things olive, wouldn't have ordered it.  We did our best to force some of it down ...boy, was THAT a mistake.  We burped up the horrible taste for the rest of the night and even in the morning. I cannot believe how much money we spent here...it should have been much, much...much better.  We did NOT stay for dessert.  In fact, I had to abandon my attempted 3 day diet at the movie theatre afterwards and order a hot pretzel.  As we left I turned for one last look and said ""good bye, Karyn's...forever.""",-0.2732,0.872,0.059,0.069,0.3893060643060643

2006-10-01,3.0,"I really wanted to love Karyn's Raw on Halsted. It just didn't do it for me though. It felt great to try something new and (very) different, but it was slightly uncomfortable eating the food. I ordered the ravioli. I'm not an olive fan, but can handle a few... The ravioli is smothered in black and green olives and the sauce is very salty. We ordered the stuffed pizza as well as the dim sum appetizer. That was not dim sum. It tasted like mushy raw tuna wrapped in a leaf soaked in the saltiest soy sauce on this planet. The stuffed pizza was better, but still way too salty. We also tried the coconut water, which was under ""cocktails"" on the menu. There wasn't a hint of alcohol in the coconut water. It wasn't bad, but rather decent. I don't know, I just think raw food isn't for me. I'll just stick to carrots and brocolli.",0.9012,0.841,0.112,0.046,0.5075459725459726
2006-07-10,1.0,"I had never tried raw food but I was curious and decided to give it a try. MISTAKE! I thought it was just absolutely horrible. It was outrageously expensive. I had ""Basil Scented Ravioli with a Macademia Whipped Creme Dressed with a Sun-Dried Tomato Puree "", a pumpkin seed ""cookie"", and ""The Morning Cleanser"", which is Green Meal, Apple Juice, Rejuvelac, Banana, Flax Oil, and Lecithin. . The drink was the only thing that I ended up liking. The ravioli was interesting at first. It was pretty and looked good, but after I was halfway done with it I felt really queasy. It was too strong tasting or something. I could smell and taste it hours later. The ""cookie"" I had was really funny. I think it cost around $10 and was basically a giant wad of raw pumpkin seeds held together with honey and a little cinnamon. So about $10 for the ""cookie"", $22 for the ravioli, and $9 for the drink.  I will never go back to Karyn's Raw but I have heard good things about Karyn's Cooked. I'm hoping that's better.",0.9807,0.749,0.19,0.06,0.5881562881562882
2006-07-04,3.0,"Karyn gets an A for effort and for building the first raw restaurant in Chicago (afaik), and a great community around it. However, the food for being vegetarian and raw is _extremely heavy_.  The only dish I really like even somewhat is the 'spaghetti' which is made from zuchinni and has a nutty sauce. Most of the food is very heavy with nuts and the same flavor profile hitting you right in the face with no subtlety at all.  I have Trotter & Klein's book ""Raw"" at home and it has some incredible recipes that Karyn should try. Her deserts are quite excellent and probably the only thing that makes me want to come back to this place.
