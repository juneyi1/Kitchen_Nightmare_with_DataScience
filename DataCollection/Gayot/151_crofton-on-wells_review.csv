2012-04-04,3.0,"The French cuisine here is delicious, but French cuisine is not the reaction you might have, walking into the restaurant the first time. Instead, you may wonder, how did I end up in a Los Angeles sushi bar circa 1980? The decor is dark dark dark, and ferns abound.  The restaurant ambience is somber, utterly lacking in the kind of frivolity one would normally associate with a French bistro.  We were seated on a table adjacent the wall, and I had a distinct sensation that we were on a slant, our food waiting to simply slide into our laps, instead of caressing our gullets.  I am pleased to inform you, gentle reader, that my fears on that point turned out to be baseless, and quite to the contrary, or plates were delicious. I had the venison, as I always do whenever the opportunity presents itself, and I was not disappointed.  Cooked rare to my specifications, it was bloody and delightful.  Kelly had the beef tenderloin, which was delicious.  For dessert, we had the milk chocolate hazelnut financier, and it was also excellent. Cocktails were fine, but not outstanding in any way.  Be aware that the website menus are not updated regularly and may not accurately reflect the selection in house; case in point, I was disappointed that the wine list in house no longer had the Chateauneuf du Pape I saw on line.  Because the wine list is small in comparison to many restaurants, this was a bit of a burden but we were able to find an alternative Rhone wine that amply complemented our entrees.   Having said all that, the restaurant is pricey, even by French standards in Chicago.  It received a Michelin star but I do not see the quality, in comparison to, say, Longman and Eagle or Ria.  We had the benefit of dining on behalf of generous guests from our wedding, and we will be back to do the same, but if you are paying your own way for French food, I must tell you in all honesty that, unless venison is on the menu, you may wish to consider Kiki's or La Sardine if you are in the downtown area.",0.9904,0.797,0.145,0.058,0.5507147944647944

2012-03-05,2.0,"A friend wanted to catch over dinner and drinks so we decided to try Crofton. The atmosphere is very traditional, simple American. On a Thursday night the place was empty until about 8PM when a couple of other older couples came in for dinner. Service was very attentive with water, drinks and simply dropping by to make sure everything was okay.  When we sat down I immediately told my server I was vegan as the menu suggested. He then pointed out all the dishes on the menu they could make vegan. There were a couple of appetizer and one entree for me to choose from. As my appetizer I ordered the marinated mushrooms. They were absolutely amazing. It was a mix of all different types of mushrooms marinated and cooked to perfection. The flavor and texture left me having to force myself to stop eating. As my meal they brought me the Cassoulet which was mostly navy beans and some vegetables with a side of a potato and onion hash. I was really disappointed in the entree because there was absolutely no flavor or seasoning. I ended up asking for some kind of hot sauce to get my taste-buds perked in some way. All cooks should know that when you take away the butter and cheese you have to make up for that flavor burst some how and the cheapest way... is over seasoning!!! But hello... I paid $26 for this crap... come on... give me something decent at least! My friend ordered the crab-cakes for his appetizer and the venison as his entree. He stated that the crab-cakes were a bit dry but seasoned well. His venison came out PERFECTLY cooked medium rare which he thoroughly enjoyed. However, he also commented that the accompanying vegetables had much room for improvement.  My recommendation... if you are a meat eater check it out. You might really enjoy yourself!

This restaurant is modest and, yet, it is very rewarding to dine here. Crofton has a nice understated charisma. The dining room is warm and intimate. The decor is smart and simple. The service here is knowledgeable and professional. The servers and bussers don't get in the way of your evening. Rather, they appear just in time to refill your water glasses or clear your food.  In short, Crofton nails the details. Bread comes piping hot. Napkins are folded when you leave the table. Plates are hot. Food is executed flawlessly. Seasoning is perfect.

A Michelin star indicates a restaurant that consistently delivers outstanding quality in all areas - food, service, beverage. In the spirit of full disclosure, we brought wine to the restaurant, but the food and service are far from award-winning. The maitre d was overwhelmed with tending to the coat check and seating customers. Perhaps the waiter was overwhlemd because we did not see him for at least 10 minutes. And the kitchen was clearly overwhelmed, considering the 3 course meal took 3 hours. On a recommendation from the waiter, I ordered the quinoa johnny cakes for an appetizer. The bottom of the cakes were burned. After waiting quite a while for the food to arrive, I was so hungry that I did not send them back. I choose the fluke dish for my entree. The wild mushrooms were the best part - the fish and the lentil puree were far from flavorful. My mom ordered the salmon entree but did not eat until the rest of us were almost done - she had to send it back because it was not fully cooked.

True, it is soup, salad, and a protein filled entree for your meal, par for the course. But my crab cake was tender, delicious, and flavorful. The salads are absurdly fresh and perfectly presented (pear ánd blue cheese, fantastic) and the beef tenderloin was perfectly portioned and to die for. The service was great, in the sense that it is not the overbearing ridiculousness that other restaurants exude. Personally I can be told 'back and its the second door on your right' politely and it is more than enough. I need not be escorted, I don't need a bathroom attendant, and my napkin need not be perfectly folded or replaced with every departure.

2011-10-23,1.0,"Since Michelin has come to Chicago, we have been excited to try many of the starred restaurants.. Unfortunately, this place will not meet the expectations for a starred restaurant or that of any respectable restaurant. To begin: walking into the restaurant, there was no hostess there to greet anyone entering.  After waiting 5 minutes, someone came to seat us.  Several minutes later someone came to hand us menus and about 20 minutes later, the waiter came to take our order.  With no exaggeration, 1 hour passed by before our waiter came to our table to check on us.  Meanwhile, we were given 1 slice of bread each and our appetizers had not been served.  The waiter never checked on us to see how we were enjoying the food.  Overall, we were stuck at the restaurant for over 2 hours watching the waitstaff chat with each other.  I don't think the service is what killed the experience, it was a combination of the extended time it took to get the dishes out and the lack of attention from staff that made it so evident that this place was not worth ever returning to. The good: we ordered the fois gras and sweetbreads and this dish was quite good. Some attention from the waiter was given towards the end of the meal, but by then it was too little too late.. 2 hours into dining should warrant more than 60 seconds of service, since the restaurant was not overly busy and there was plenty of staff standing around. The entrees tasted like an after-thought and not memorable. I barely ate half of the halibut because it was so overcooked and bland. If you are considering trying this place because you've already tried many restaurants in Chicago, please don't waste your time.  If you are planning to eat here because you are in the area, GT Oyster next door has much better food and service.  If trying a one michelin star place is the goal, Blackbird, Sepia, Boka, and Takashi will exceed your expectations.",0.9593,0.88,0.085,0.034,0.3805555555555556

My wife and I, on our quest to sample all of Chicago's Michelin-starred restaurants, brought some out-of-town family to Crofton on Wells to show off some of Chicago's best.  But the best was not found here. Two of the five entrees had to be returned due to poor preparation.  I had the $39 beef tenderloin that, when requested medium-rare, came back tough, brown and stringy.  This is not the kind of mistake a restaurant like this should make.  Additionally, one dish was over-salted, and another under-salted.  This being said, the rest of the food was good, and our vegetarian diner was very pleased. The service was on-par with what you might find at any restaurant down the block.  We were not well-attended (wine glasses empty, check sitting on the table for 15 minutes before being picked up).  However, to his credit, our server brought us a small complementary appetizer to tie us over while we waited for our returned entrees, and we were treated to two free desserts.  But, alas, the desserts (peach cobbler & a combo of peanut butter and chocolate gelati) were disappointing. The wine was served at room temperature and the cocktail list was uninventive. With a price tag like this, one expects better.  Overall it was an unexceptional dining experience, and I wish we took our family somewhere else - like Blackbird, Sepia, MK, Ruxbin, Graham Elliot - all of which I've had EXCEPTIONAL experiences at.

I did not find portions to be a problem as others have, but I did eat a salad and dessert with my entree as well as several glasses of wine.

From the ambiance and simple decor to the flavors of the food itself, truly made my visit to Chicago a special treat.  To start off, the freshness of the crabcakes was the perfect way to begin the meal. The vinaigrette perfectly balanced the sweetness of the mango butter, and it left me wanting more. For entrees, we got the pork tenderloin, Atlantic black cod, chicken, salmon, and the swan creek farm duck. I was able to get a bite of each, and as for my favorite, it would be chicken. The chicken breast was the most tender I have ever had. A bit of that reduction made it absolutely melt in my mouth. Someone at the table mentioned the pork tenderloin was the best tenderloin he's ever had, but it was a tad dry for me. The salmon was cooked perfectly as was the black cod. The black cod had a ravioli on top of it, which made it very interesting. I can't remember the exact filling but it was sort of a butternut squash filling. We ordered two desserts. One was a blueberry lemon trio while the other was a peanut butter trio. In the peanut butter trio, there was a homemade gelato, and a puff pastry filled with peanut butter glaze. The blueberry lemon trio had a cake and a lemon sorbet. Everything on the dessert plates was amazing. Nothing was overbearingly sweet or sour.

We enjoyed our meal thoroughly.  Our amuse bouche was a spicy dark hot chocolate shooter with a piece of popcorn.  Chocolatey with a nice kick.  It was an interesting start to our meal.  We both began our meals with salads-Baby Greens with grilled grapefruit for him, Pear salad with blue cheese for me.  Both portions were perfect as an appetizer. Entrees: Amish chicken for him, which included chicken breast that was moist and tender AND a buttermilk fried chicken thigh on top of a waffle.  It was awesome.  Scallops for me-3 perfectly cooked, large scallops.  We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts with bacon.  They were just okay. Dessert: Banana Cream Pie.  It was delicious and not too sweet.  The peanut brittle on top gave it a nice crunch. The only downside was service as a little on the slow side.  There was just too much time between each step of our meal: between sitting down and placing a drink order, between placing our order and food coming out, between courses.   Overall,  delicious meal that was great for a special occasion.",0.991,0.771,0.201,0.027,0.6387152777777777

The service is very friendly, but the last time I visited, it was a night that they had a special fixed menu and I felt extremely rushed.  The restaurant wasn't busy, yet I felt we were hurried along (though in a relatively friendly manner). The room is nice - dark and cozy.  Large groups are well accommodated, however, the volume level in the restaurant is low, so if it's a really large group, they may be uncomfortable as the tables are large, so some may have to talk loudly to reach those on the other side of the table. The restaurant serves fresh food - some dishes have unique flavors and textures, which makes this a good spot for those who want to try something new.  More of a high-end, special occasion spot due to pricing, but very worthwhile.",0.9935,0.74,0.23,0.03,0.5779348102877515

It doesn't have to be the case as Alinea and other top notch Chicago dining destinations continue to recognize that the total experience extends from the way the hostess behaves, through the meal, up to the bill being delivered. Unfortunately, Crofton on Wells doesn't get it or does not care. The experience that my wife and I had is a case in point. We had a 5pm reservation on New Year's Eve, Dec 31st. The restaurant was empty. The hostess led us to a table next to the kitchen even though we indicated the another table that we would have preferred. The hostess refused our request - which would have been fine if the restaurant was crowded. But the place was empty ! The table (for two) that we had wanted remained empty until the time we left.  The food was good but really not up to the level we expected , The bill was $327 + tip for the two of us, with a side of service that was perfunctory and haphazard.   While we will never return (or at least not until the hostess has been fired), we would strongly recommend that there are far better places in Chicago deserving of your patronage.",0.7452,0.873,0.073,0.055,0.568767217630854

I'm not sure if this is by design (i.e. the reservation system) or because of the restaurant itself, but my friend did mention that he had called several other places and this is the only where he could get a spot. I digress. I'm not complaining that it wasn't crowded, but you would think that on a Saturday night in the city, it would have had a busier feel to it. Anyway, I digress again. I get the whole 'organic' thing and I understand the benefits of local growers, but to be completely honest, everyone is doing organic and a lot of places are doing local, it's not really that new anymore. I had the walleye, my wife had the amish chicken and while both were very good and quite tasty, the portions were small and the service slow. If I'm going to spend $75/person on dinner in this economy, I expect to at least leave full and my wife and I were both commenting how hungry we were while driving home.

2010-11-06,1.0,"Have you ever seen one of those drawings from the Renaissance where some artist has painted an elephant from a description and it kind of looks like an elephant would be described as but looks nothing like an actual elephant? This restaurant is like that. With all of the worlds finest foods at her fingertips Ms. Crofton the proprietor, and self proclaimed chef, could not muster a decent meal. This place was seriously the worst.  The decor consistes of painted sheetrock walls and a few paintings on that were trying to be abstract impressionist but were just stupid. Our waiter, an unkempt twenty something stoner stuffed into a black shirt and black pants couldn't even pour our wine correctly. It seems like the high menu prices guarantee high tips despite the poor quality of service. This place is like hell on earth for those of us with a palate. Every dish on the menu was a grotesque abomination of mismatched ingredients stirred together on a plate. It was like the head chef thought, since most peole are so ill educated about food they won't realize that she doesn't know how to use fois gras, they will just be impressed that it's included in every dish. The menu reads more like a list of the worlds most expensive ingredients slapped Mad Libs style next to whatever food-trend buzz-word people in the midwest think the 'it' New York restaurants are doing. The uninspired menu, we were informed, changed seasonally, which I thought would be a good thing, except that nothing on the menu was in season, except for maybe the truffles, which were on everything. Their signature dish I was told is the crab cake, which I tried, and admittedly wasn't bad, but then I thought, hey I'm like 1500 miles from an ocean, how is this their specialty, shouldn't it be like some sort of beef or something from the lake? They don't do specials, so don't ask. Next up a main, the entree menu was sparse and nothing sounded particularly good to me. The beef tenderloin was the only beef option and I hesitate to get a $40 slice of tenderloin as it is not my favorite cut, and if I'm going to splurge it will be on a nice cote de beouf or something with some flavor.  I opted for the pork filet, at $33 I was hesitant to order it, but it was one of the less expensive dishes. It was to be served with black eyed peas and kale, things I learned to love while living in The South. I had a few glasses of wine before my meal arrived and was plenty hungry when it reached the table, without looking I cut off a slice of the pork and when it was in my mouth I realized that it had not been cooked though.  It was like tuna sashimi, but cold raw pork. It was all I could do to not spit it across the tacky dining room.  I am not a person that complains at dinner, I eat my food and yelp about it later, but it was obvious to the rest of my party that something was wrong, two other people at my table had ordered the same meal as I, and they didn't have a problem, it was just mine. To my embarrassment it was now a topic of conversation, the raw pork was being passed around the table being inspected, the waiter was summoned and some ass from the kitchen came out to condescend me by telling me that it's the way they prepare it, medium rare. Now, if that was the way they prepare it, there would have been three raw pork dinners on the table instead of one. And if that is the way they prepare it, on the menu it should say next to the pork HEY THIS PORK IS GOING TO BE FRIGGIN RAW! so that people would know not to order it. Just because some idiot chef in LA was like ""Hey everybody we can cook pork rare now because pork has antibiotics in it!"" doesn't mean you should. Long story short it went back on the broiler for a minute and I was returned a tough as leather pork tenderloin perched on a pile of undercooked over-salted black eyed peas and over cooked kale. Now that I think about it everything on the menu should read WARNING NOTHING WILL BE PREPARE CORRECTLY BECAUSE WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO COOK HERE... but they will charge you so much money that you will be embarrassed if you don't like it because that will mean there is something wrong with you. I guess though this place isn't all bad, If your never going to make it anywhere with a real culture I suppose going to Crofton could be a treat, it seems to be very popular with the Groupon folks. I feel like I am leaving something out... lets see... to recap; bad decor,  uneducated yet condescending waitstaff, lackluster menu, improperly and/or poorly prepared foods, high prices, yup that's this place",0.9875,0.809,0.115,0.076,0.5737799892415274
2010-11-04,3.0,I stumbled upon this place after striking out at a few other restaurants in Chicago last week. Actually the Yelp iPhone app pointed me there... The place was 3/4 empty on a Thursday night - which should have been a hint. The food was actually very good - even though it took quite a while to get to my table (as other folks have noted). Being a party of 1 (on a business trip) I would have appreciated a little faster turnaround. Thankfully I had my iPhone to read... Anyway I had the Carpaccio as appetizer and it was good. For the main course I had the duck dish (with foie gras and chard) and that was very good. My main complaint besides the slowness of the kitchen was the price. For the two (very small) dishes above and a glass of Pinot Noir my bill came out to $75 (without tip). And I was still hungry. If money (and time) is no object then Crofton on Wells is a good choice.

Dimly lit and actually (somewhat) reasonable privacy between tables. I've had decent service in my experiences..... I'd classify it as the expected minimum.  I've dined at Crofton a few times, and the last experience was particularly mediocre. My bf and I had a really fantastic date night, but it was no thanks to the food we dined on at Crofton. The amuse we were served was a bland gazpacho shooter that was at an unfortunately unappetizing temperature. I wasn't expecting it to be ice cold, but it was strangely a touch above room temperature. I imagine it was the room temp of a hot room (i.e. a kitchen with a bunch of gas stoves fired up). Bland gazpacho was not a good way to set the tone for our meal. I personally love Crofton's crabcake, but my boyfriend was appalled at the portion size for the price. I completely agree that it's 100% lump crab and no cake, but still.... I suppose it's a tad on the small side.  Speaking of portion size, maybe we are complete fat kids..... but I've found the entree portions at Crofton to err on the scant side. While I appreciate places that don't go all gluttonous Cheesecake Factory-style on portion size (because really Cheesecake Factory? Is a chicken entree with 2262 calories and 68 g of saturated fat REALLY necessary? I didn't think so), I consistently find myself thinking ""hmmm.... thats an awfully small piece of chicken/fish/# of scallops/whatever"" when I'm at Crofton. The food itself was average to  above average..... the chicken and waffles actually had quite the wow factor. I think it actually caused us both to say ""mmmmmmmm"" while eating it.

Located on Wells right by Grand, parking can be a little hard to obtain, but was not a problem for us Tuesday night. Looking at this place from the outside it does seem pretty small. I must have passed this place a few times before thinking this place was a pub. Inside, the restaurant does feel a bit larger, but it's really a cozy atmosphere. Standard white tablecloth and a dim atmosphere can be found here. Just want to mention the silverware as I found it amusing that my gf was alternating the silverware between her hands (they have a narrow handle like a pencil which was uncomfortable to hold for her.) As far as food goes here is what we had. Signature crabcake: So the choice to order this came from Yelpland and from the signature epithet it was given. It's good and it's almost all crab, but I could not tell that this was lump crab. It was almost like a quiche texture to me. Flavor was there, but not the best. I'd have to say this was ok to a little better than ok. Veal sweetbreads: It was a miss in my gf's book, but I liked it quite a bit. I think it was cooked perfectly and gf did like the cucumber/watermelon relish. Amish chicken: By far my favorite chicken dish I think of all time. I don't particularly care for white meat because it always feels dry, but this was moist. The chicken and the waffle... it was really, really good. I'd go back and do the prix fixe meal just for this dish. Grouper: This was my dish and I really enjoyed it. It had a tomato jam to it which went well with the fish and I did like the artichokes it came with as well. Dessert: I usually don't care for dessert so I share. This time I actually got my own getting the sorbets and ice cream dessert while the gf got the peach/raspberry dessert. The choices I had for my ice cream were vanilla, chocolate, salted caramel, and honey goat while my sorbet choices were raspberry, blueberry, and another fruit i can't remember. I picked the honey goat, salted caramel, and blueberry. All three were really good, but my winner was the salted caramel. Gf's peach/raspberry dessert was pretty much a cobbler with raspberry on top and vanilla ice cream on the side. I don't think either of us cared for the sauce it sat in, but overall the dessert was decent. Service was slow... actually ridiculously slow for a Tuesday night, but it wasn't to the point of being upset. Besides that, the servers and waitstaff were really attentive in refilling water glasses making sure everything was good. Overall, it is pricey and I'm still debating if I'd go back sans groupon, but it's definitely possible with the prix fixe menu.

Here's what we had:  We ordered the famed crab cake and the sturgeon caviar to start and it was everything we'd hoped. Easily the best crab cake I've ever had.  We shared the baby greens salad with fabulous beets and this mozzarella gele (sp?) that was so fresh it was unbelievable. For dinner, I had the duck and he had the pork tenderloin. Both were also very, very good. Preparation was perfect.  Dessert was the cherry/cherry for me and the peach/raspberry for him. Both were light and summery and a good end to the meal itself.  BUT. The service was downright terrible. We suspect that this was due to a large group of people taking up the entire bar area and wandering into the kitchen to pester the staff. At one point, this large (drunk and loud, looking fresh from the yacht club) group knocked into a food runner who dumped an entire pitcher of ice water across a table behind us, and onto a unsuspecting woman.  We sat for 40 minutes and finally had to speak to the hostess, who flagged our waiter, before our appetizers came out. Our waiter was very apologetic and they did comp each a glass of wine and dessert, and it was clear that the staff themselves were trying to accommodate this group at the bar, but it appeared to be at the expense of the regular table-seated crowd (not just us, there was NO food coming out to the front half of the place while we were waiting for our first course....except, that is, for the people at the bar).  We came for my boyfriend's 35th birthday, which I mentioned when we made the reservation, and that was totally forgotten. No little candle, no name on the plate as they said they would when they asked for the spelling of his first name. By that point I'm sure the kitchen was just glad to be getting the food out onto people's tables. But, for the price of the food and a special occasion, we were really shocked at the lack of attention to the entire rest of the restaurant. I don't know what Crofton's policy is on meal service at the bar, but for such a small footprint, allowing a group that large to take up an obnoxious 2 hour residence at the bar (not seated, standing and wandering around) seems inappropriate. I wish we'd been able to have that exact meal under different circumstances.  Maybe go on an off-night? We were there at 7:30pm on a summer Saturday.

I can't even remember.  I blackout when I eat that thing.  If I could have it every day, I would.

2010-05-09,4.0,"Another under-appreciated foodie classic in this great foodie city.   Over the past year and a half we have visited Crofton on Wells twice, once for Valentine's Day and another visit to use a Groupon.  Both visits have shown us wonderful classic dishes, like smoked sturgeon and caviar and well as an amazing spring risotto with morels and ramps. The plates here are on the small side, but pack a wallop of flavor. The atmosphere is definitively late-90's (when Crofton on Wells first open the doors) with classic 80's and early-90's ballads playing overhead.  Though not a combination I would have initially picked, it does create a wonderfully romantic atmosphere - perfect for showing someone you love how special they are. Service here is impeccable. Amelia is an amazingly attentive server and gave us 5-star treatment.  Comparing Groupon experiences CoW has been one of the best .  While we have noticed the quality of service dropping at a number of restaurants when they see the Groupon the opposite happened here.  To me this is what Groupon is all about.  Get people in the door and impress them enough to come back and pay full price, which Crofton on Wells most certainly did. I only have two real complaints that keep the elusive 5th star just out of reach. The first is the price.  As many have noted it is difficult to leave without spending $90+ per person. Though worth the money, they are (very) slightly more expensive than comparable restaurants.  If we return sans Groupon (which we plan on doing) it will most definitely be for the early prix-fixe deal (identical food at nearly half the price.)  The other is the cocktail selection.  As the classic cocktail revival has hit Chicago, Crofton on Wells has not kept pace.  Though they have a good bourbon selection and do a wonderful Manhattan (with Van Winkle 12 year), they have no rye whiskys, absinthe (for sazeracs) or ginger beer (for dark'n'stormy and moscow mules). I think correcting the cocktail issue would also make the price issue disappear - a common side-effect from a couple of well made sazeracs. Moreover both of these complaints are minor and should not discourage you from trying Crofton on Wells. Combining our personal experiences with the nontrivial number of awards and accolades I would encourage everyone to come check out Crofton on Wells.",0.9976,0.741,0.219,0.04,0.4598084886128366

Last night I took my hubby and my $75 Groupon for a delicious meal at Crofton on Wells. And boy was it delicious... The restaurant was only half full on a Saturday night, but that just meant more attention for us from our fabulous waitress, Amelia. The menu is small, but everything looked so good that we still had some difficult ordering decisions to make while enjoying our wine (a nice glass of sauvignon blanc for me).  With Amelia's help we narrowed it down to the following: Apps:  * Signature Crabcake: This came highly recommended by many yelpers. The rumors are true- one of the best crabcakes ever.  There's barely any filling (just lots of crab) in this cake * Scallop: Perfectly cooked and very flavorful Entrees: * Farm Chicken (for me): Chicken isn't usually on the top of my list, but the yelpers and Amelia raved about this.  It was beyond delicious! Had just the right amount of spice and came with some awesome mashed potatoes as well. * Venison (for hubby): I just had a bite, but my goodness that was one tasty bite!  Dessert: I've been trying to avoid dessert lately, but hubby convinced me to split the banana cream pie with him. And splitting it turned into me eating most of it...the salted caramel in it really put it over the top. After the Groupon discount and the tip the total came to about $140.

2009-12-21,3.0,"If money were no object and I had loads to spend on food at my every whim, I would be a regular here.  Unfortunately, however, I'm not rich and have to justify a nice dinner at a place like Crofton on Wells on an anniversary, holiday, or other out of the ordinary night.  Last week was such a night, and we had a Groupon to boot, so we decided to try out Crofton. The food was excellent for the most part.  You can tell that the ingredients are of a very high quality.  Service was okay - nothing to write home about and also not on par with other restaurants that charge as much for their food and drink as does Crofton.  The ambience is fabulous for a romantic night out -- dimly lit, quiet, and very calm. To start, we had the famous crabcake and the wild mushroom appetizer.  My vote went to the mushroom dish.  It was rich, flavorful, buttery, and just all around very delicious.  We actually asked for more bread so that we could soup up the remaining sauce before the server took it away.  The crabcake got a rave review from my husband, but it was my least favorite dish of the evening.  The crab was fresh, but something was missing.  We each had a glass of the pinot gris from Wilamette Valley, which was tasty albeit expensive.  (More on the wine list later). For our entrees, I had the fall vegetable risotto and my husband had the venison, which was served with pork shoulder.  Both were excellent, so much so that we kept stealing bites off of each others' plates.  We had a very bold and tasty Cab that went perfectly with both dishes.  We also couldn't resist ordering a side of mashed potatoes, which were creamy and well-seasoned.   Though I really enjoyed the wines we selected, I was overall disappointed in the wine list.  From what I could tell, all of the wines were of a very high quality, but there were very few non-American wines on the list-save for a few Reislings from Germany---resulting in the wines being between $12-15 a glass for whites and $14-??? per glass for reds.  I get that chefs like to serve wines from the same region as the cuisine they cook, but these prices make an already expensive dinner even more expensive.   Sadly, the often raved-about pumpkin with goat cheese ice cream dessert was no longer on the menu, and none of the other desserts jumped out at us, so we skipped dessert.  When all was said and done, our meal was $166 for two apps, two entrees (one veggie), and two glasses of wine each.

The main course was a fish dish that I can't remember because it was not on the menu, but the highlight was my girlfriend's pork tenderloin. Perfectly cooked and melt in your mouth flavor. Not surprising a good meal and lived up to expectations. Given what I had read about the place, the awards won and recommendations by friends, I was surprised that our server said that even after 11 years the place is still not well known. They would be doing better in this economic climate with a stronger loyal customer base, but such as it is the doors are open for Suzie to serve quality food and I hope for years to come. It's a perfect date place with a dark, quiet setting. If times were different you could go there more often.

They were amazing. Truly amazing. I really wish you could order this as an entree... I don't see it on their menu anywhere. Tragic. Our entrees arrived and they were pretty good - but not mind blowing. The thing that stands out to me is after finishing our entrees, we decided to skip dessert as we had a show to get to - and so I asked our waitress to bring the check to *me*. I have a pretty strict policy about paying for all dates early on - I mean I figure if a girl is patient enough to put up with me long enough for the check to come - the least I can do is pay the bill. After waiting for the bill for maybe 5 minutes I realize I need to, ahem, investigate the bathroom facilities. So I get up and start walking to the bathroom. Halfway there our waitress passes me. I very specifically make eye contact with her so that she recognizes me (in case she has the check) and she just passes by not saying a word.  I had a bad feeling, so I paid attention as I continued walking - and sure enough she goes and drops off the check at my table! Gah!!

The emphasis was on the crab and not breading or some other substitute for the meat. The size was perfect too - filing, but not to the point of being too stuffed for one's entree and small enough to keep you wanting a bit more! For my entree I debated between the beet crepes and the diver scallops. I took the server's recommendation and went with the scallops which were magnificent! They were cooked to perfection - which was great since my last experience ordering scallops was awful. The truffle oil was a lovely complement as was the salmon bacon!

Anyway, the crab cake was ok, but not great.  It was covered in an unusual creamy sauce, and the crab was shredded, not lump.  There was too much egg or some other coagulant put in there because it was quite solid without a strong crab flavour.  I thought that the micro salad that they put on top redeemed it a little. For my entree, I ordered the buckwheat soba crepes.  They came filled with beets and topped with a scoop of whipped blue-basil goat cheese.  The cheese had an interesting fluffy texture but didn't have the tanginess that I expected (and wanted) from goat cheese.  I do like beets though.  A lot.  I also tried my brother's diver scallops which were large, fresh, and perfectly cooked, but there was almost nothing interesting about the dish except for the salmon bacon.  Our friend ordered the Amish chicken which I didn't get to try, but looked harmless. Desserts were good.  You get to choose anything from the dessert menu and everything is small and exquisite.  I had the ""meyer lemon/blackberry"" which was basically a very small blackberry crisp topped with a small scoop of lemon ice cream served with a shot of bitter lemon soda.  It was warm and delicious.  I also tried the ""strawberry/rhubarb"" which was a shortcake.  The goat's milk butter spread on the shortcake was pretty interesting though. Service was definitely on the slow side.  The whole place only had 2 waiters and they reached serving capacity once the restaurant was 40% full.  It took them a long time to get our desserts/drinks/check. Overall, I was satisfied but the place is not so wonderful that I would want to come back.",0.9938,0.77,0.184,0.046,0.5961645962732919

I've heard the chef is a stickler for the freshest ingredients, and you can really taste that. I started with the lobster salad. Mmm... so delicious. Really generous portions of lobster, and the radish and buttermilk dressing were perfect with it. Bf had the rabbit schnitzel - very tasty. For my entree, I had the Alaskan halibut and my bf got the diver scallops. Both were delicious. Maybe it's because I'm a sucker for scallops, but they were fantastic. Perfectly cooked. Jealous I didn't order it myself, but the halibut was still incredibly yum. Didn't have room for dessert unfortunately, but their menu was very tempting.

I came here with restaurant week with my family, and it was so wonderful to go out with my parents to somewhere they nice because they rarely get to try places like this. I was afraid that this place would be pretentious, but it wasn't at all! Our waiter was attentive and friendly. The meal started with a pumpkin soup type of amuse bouche [complimentary= :) ] And I had the mini crab cake with mango butter- it was sooo meaty and chunky, yet light! It was surprisingly very flavorful, and I highly recommend them. I ordered the buckwheat soba crepes with beets and an african blue basil goat cheese foam on top. I was SO intrigued by the foam. I was like OoO foAmmmm! And to be honest, I don't even normally like beets very much, but it totally worked! The portion size was small, but because it was the restaurant week 3 course meal I was full by the end. I'm glad I tried this dish, but it's not something I would order over and over again. (But if you're vegetarian (which I'm not), this is a great option). I also tried my family's dishes- the amish chicken (very moist and tender) and my brother had the prime beef tenderloin which he really enjoyed. My dad had some salmon I believe, and it was also very moist and flavorful. All the food was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. We also got to try a lot of the desserts which were all decadent and presented beautifully (banana cream pie and rocky road).",0.9979,0.754,0.242,0.004,0.6217329545454546
2009-03-29,4.0,"Crofton on Wells is an intimate and beautifully decorated restaurant. The atmosphere is elegant, with dim lighting and sleek white tables. Along with the Restaurant Week menu, they offered some wines at reduced price, so we tried their Havens Syrah for about $10 off the usual price. I really enjoyed it, but can't speak much about the specifics because I am not really much of a wine expert. I liked how the server poured it for us, since it can be quite inconvenient to pour it oneself at the table.  I thought the crab cake was delicious - not so flaky perhaps, but still very juicy and flavorful. I think the consistency was more like a crab burger, but flavor didn't suffer. The accompanying sauce was quite spicy!  I thought my trout was well prepared, and the portion sizes were excellent - not too overwhelming. I wasn't stunned by the creativity of the entree, but it was a very enjoyable dish nonetheless.  The banana cream pie was delicious and tasted fresh, although the chocolate sauce underneath was too rich for me.

2009-02-24,3.0,"A friend had recommended Crofton on Wells to me several months back and this past weekend we finally made it in for dinner to take advantage of their Restaurant Week menu. I order the Roasted Cauliflower Soup, Amish Chicken, & the Banana Cream Pie. Audrey went with the Petite Crab Cake, Buckwheat Soba Crepes, and the Rocky Road.  The Roasted Cauliflower Soup was creamy, well seasoned, and the smoked trumpet mushrooms really added a nice smokiness to the dish. However, the guanciale (unsmoked Italian bacon) was a bit tough and to tell you the truth I had no clue what these tasteless bits of chewiness were while eating the soup.  I feel that the quality of the dish would have been added to if this component was subtracted.   The Amish Chicken was served boneless with the skin on and rubbed with some herbs and chipotle.   It tasted excellent and was cooked perfectly. The chicken was served atop some mashed potatoes and a molasses reduction. A very nice chicken dish.  I finished the evening with the Banana Cream Pie, which was just ok. Audrey's Crab Cake was a winner! The cake was plump with crab meat and very tasty.  A hint of mango butter and thai chile really made for nice fruity spicy surprise.  However, the Buckwheat Soba Crepes were the star of the evening.   What's better than goat cheese, beets, and really nice thin buckwheat crepes?  The portion on this dish was a bit small and I would have probably been hungry after finishing it. I'd suggest ordering this dish as an appetizer and sharing with your friends.  The Rocky Road was yummy! You can't go wrong with chocolate, devil's food cake, marshmallows, and almond cookies.  Why didn't I go with the chocolate dessert? What's wrong with me? Has my time in the Middle East turned me into a non sweet date and fig loving dessert guy? I hope not.... The space is itself is warm, dark, and pretty unassuming. Audrey mentioned that it reminded her of some of the smaller restaurants in California wine country. I agreed.  Sometimes nice and simple just works.  The service was strong, but nothing to write home about.  Our entire dining experience last just over 40 minutes, which made this one of the quickest nice meals I have ever had.  I even had a cappuccino at the end of the meal.

Nestled between an Irish pub and a Middle Eastern restaurant on a busy stretch of Wells, this understated restaurant is one of the city's best kept secrets (at least for me!). A friend suggested we have dinner here last night and I had to admit that I had never heard of this place.  The funny thing?  It's not some new restaurant but one that has been turning out great food for over 10 years. We started with splitting a couple of the appetizers- the signature crab cake with a spicy sauce and a medley of mushrooms in a veal broth with cracked black pepper.  Both were delicious.  The rolls that they served were hot and crusty and the butter melted into the bread. For entrees- we went with the Amish chicken and the Kobe beef.  The chicken came sliced with a spicy herb and chipotle rub served over a bed of mashed potatoes.  The Kobe beef was cooked perfectly and served with little onions on a thin slice of potato.  Both entrees were flavorful and perfectly presented.  To accompany this we also ordered the lobster risotto.  It was the best risotto I have ever had.  Big chunks of lobster, creamy rice and two different cheeses.  I was in food heaven. We barely  had room after all of that for dessert- but we just had to try the banana chocolate plate.  It came with 4 different things to try.  A mini shake, a creme brulee, a pudding and salted macadamia nuts on the plate.  Very nice. The manager was also great.  She accommodated us when we arrived early for our reservation and kept checking in throughout the night as to how we were doing.  The best thing?  As she was leaving- she invited us to come back again.  That's what I like to see in a restaurant- people who care if you come back or not. The service was good although we did have one miss when the entree's arrived before the wine we had ordered to go with them.
