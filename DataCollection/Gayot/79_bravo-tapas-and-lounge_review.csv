2008-01-15,4.0,"So, I was in charge of picking a place for dinner for some of my boyfriend's friends that I have never met, who were in from out of town. I wanted to somewhere in walking distance from my apt., and I was craving tapas. Plus, these people had no idea what a ""tapas"" were. So, even after reading all these bad reviews, I made reservations and we went. The inside is very nice and unique, the help was helpful, the food was good and affordable. I would not recommend the sangria, but otherwise, everything was quite tasty. Everyone especially loved the empanadas. Next time, I'll probably just go downstairs and order drinks and tapas in the lounge, more visually enjoyable. Not to mention, it seems they have different food specials down there than on the top two floors. But overall, the food and atmosphere was enjoyable.

Nothing about this place is worth an encore, except for the location and the fact they have outdoor seating (which, too, is overrated). I lived in Spain and tapas bars in Madrid don't compare with this joint. The best tapas joint in Chicago is Cafe Iberico - Babareeba and Emilio's also suck, but Bravo ranks as the worst.  The portions are small (I know, tapas means small portions), but you don't get a lot of food for the price you pay. Drinks are way overpriced , too. I dropped $200 on a co-worker (thank god for expense accounts!), and we left wanting more. As for the service, it is hard to comment because you get good servers and idiots wherever you go.  Editors note: The problem with Chicagoans is that we get all hung up on the fact that there is outdoor seating. We settle for medicority because we are so excited to be outside for the 3 months out of the year when the weather is conducive to outdoor venues. I tell you what, girls! Come to my rooftop with your friends and I will serve you drinks, some crappy tapas, and dress in a tight , flowery shirt I got at Chemise's going out of business sale. $200 for the experience should cover it.

We had dinner last night and snagged a table outside... overall we enjoyed Bravo for the drinks and the scene but didn't find the food overly impressive (except for the empenadas and grilled octopus, those were great).  Our server was also totally disinterested in us and when we asked him for his opinion on some of the dishes he mumbled, ""that's good"" and ""that's better"" while staring off into space... definitely an area for improvement there.  They also have what they call a ""sexy lounge"" downstairs which smelled like chlorine (at least it's clean?) and was somewhat smokey. It was completely empty except for the DJ, but when the weather is nice it must be tough to get people to go downstairs when they'd rather be outdoors. So overall, I recommend Bravo if you're in the area and are looking for a nice spot for drinks and appetizers... but I'd find it hard to recommend it for a special trek just for the food.",0.9928,0.729,0.241,0.03,0.5731547619047619
2007-07-03,3.0,"Given some of the negative reviews based on food quality and poor service, I was quite skeptical about this place prior to my first visit. We arrived at 6pm on a Friday evening to an almost completely empty outdoor patio.  The unseasonably cool weather may have worked to our advantage...we appeared to be our server's first table of the evening.  He had several menu recommendations, and was very attentive (perhaps overly so) even when the patio started to fill-in and he picked-up more tables. So...if you worry about poor service, if at all possible, arrive early on a Friday or Saturday night...6pm-7pm you should be golden...full staff for the night, but nobody else is there yet.  Do keep in mind their patio is huge.  When the weather is cold, indoor seating is likely to be at a premium even early on the weekends. Now for the food...I wish I could say I was as pleasantly surprised with the food as I was with the service.  Not that it was bad.  It was fine, it fact, a couple dishes (the bruschetta with goat cheese and beef empanadas) we very tasty, but not great.  We also had the patatas bravas, chorizo stuffed dates, egg and potato omelet (I forget the name); Serrano wrapped scallops and seafood paella.  All decent, nothing extraordinary.  The mojitos too are just fine.  I had the Bravo mojito, my girlfriend had the raspberry mojito.  Her initial reaction was cough syrup, but after a couple stirs and a couple sips, her reaction improved.  As far as mojitos go, these are not that strong because they are served in a pint glass as opposed to a Collins glass.  I wouldn't say they are weak...they probably have the same quantity of rum...the taste of the rum is just diluted.  So if you like strong-tasting mojitos, these are not for you. With 4 people, 1 round of drinks, about 6 tapas and 2 orders of seafood paella, our bill came to about $110 without tip.  This is certainly not out of range for tapas, but I felt it was a bit pricey based on food quality. In sum: Enjoyable patio dining experience if you beat the rush and go early...Don't expect to be wowed by the food, and you will leave satisfied.",0.9545,0.827,0.104,0.069,0.5773459383753503

The roasted mushroom (a big portobella cap) was really tough and hard to cut into. And the patatas bravas were sweet. They actually tasted like breakfast potates that had gotten some maple syrup on them. Not exactly what I was expecting.

And then our food came... well, some of it came.  [Sidenote, I kind of like in tapas restaurants how they space out your food so you don't have a million plates on the table and you can enjoy each item individually.]  Well, we received about half of what we ordered, and then we were waiting for the remainder, but the tapas (along with our server) were no where to be seen.  Finally we found him and asked for the check because we had somewhere else to be.  And he asked ""No dessert?""  What chutzpah!  As it turned out, he only placed half of our order - just never got around to the rest of it.  Oops.   Bravo isn't a new restaurant anymore; they've been around way too long to not have their act together.  In sum, don't waste your time with this place.",0.8394,0.903,0.065,0.033,0.447737579880437

Served with 8 pesto crostini, an excellent flavor at a nice price for $8.00.  The entree: Paella Del Mar for 2 - $14.95 per person - Very flavorful, full of seafood, big shrimp, scallops, fish, clams, and mussels.
