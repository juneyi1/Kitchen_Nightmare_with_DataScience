He moved to Arizona...what were you thinking?!  This friend, lets call him Aaron G...no that's too specific, how about A. Greksa, loves Cuban food.  With it being his farewell party, he chose Cafe Laguardia.  I'm glad he did! The atmosphere in this restaurant is very energetic, but not crazy.  As soon as you walk in, your eyes dart all across the walls, trying to comprehend the variety of art that has been hung.  It's a mish mosh of Cuban culture, and definitely sets the mood for your evening. The servers we had were very friendly and attentive.  Our table had a number of special orders, and they took care of everything.  The food was great as well.  I, of course, had a Cuban Sandwich.  Ashley ordered chile relanos (I know that's spelled wrong).  Other friends had fish, fajitas, burritos, etc....and I finished everything they didn't want.  It was really tasty.   This being a Saturday night, there was live music in the bar.  Our dinner ended almost right at the start of the band, so we missed out on the dancing.  This is definitely a place I would like to come back to with another large group of friends/family.

2014-05-06,2.0,I went here for a Cuban sandwich on the way to school one Thursday.  I was only the second patron in there.  Should have made me pause and leave. The decor was bizarre and I could see into the kitchen from the bar through a curtain.  Nothing amiss really just a weird view. The Cuban was meh. $6.75  Dry bread. Bland meat. Cheese was tasteless. I got papas rellenas: 2 for $3.75 and they were good.  Black beans and rice were probably the highlight and that's not good. $2.00 with the sandwich.

My favorite is probably the Cuban Sandwich, which is off the chain! Get a side of rice and some beans, plus two servings of Sweet & Green Plantains all for under $15.   2nd favorite thing is the Jibarito Steak Sandwich, which is perfect steak and onions served in-between two fried Plantains.  Eat one of these and you will be wanting to brew up a Cuba Libre while watching Yoenis Cespedes straight mash for the best story in sports -- the Oakland A's -- or watch any of the other Cuban sluggers represent (Yasiel Puig, Aroldis Chapman, etc)!

We ordered two types of sandwiches, the Cuban and the steak. My husband did not like his sandwich-the Cuban.  Although it was mostly his fault for not reading the ingredients on the menu. He's not a fan of the pork like us Caribbean folk. The flavor of my steak was good, but I thought the bread was wayyyyy to hard. Like scrape the roof of your mouth hard. Ouch. The only reason I am giving this a three is because their Cuban nachos were yummmy! Replacing the chips with tostones was pretty brilliant.

2012-10-10,4.0,"I'll start off by saying Cafe Laguardia is one of the better Cuban restaurants I've been to. Being a Cuban-American, I am very much protective of the food of my heritage, and Cafe Laguardia does a fairly good job maintaining the flavour and ambiance of classic Cuban cooking. However, its not to say that it is at its very basics a traditional Cuban restaurant. A Cuban place with ""Cheese Quesadillas"", ""Cuban Nachos"", and ""Guacamole with Chips"" as appetizers should never been taken too serious as a purveyor of traditional fare. I had the picodillo, which is my favourite Cuban meal hands down, and I usually use it as a way to judge the restaurant. My plate was well-prepared but a little on the dry side, which, of all the traditional Cuban picodillios, is a tell-tale sign of a cheaper version being served. My girlfriend had a pork plate, which was good, albeit nothing special -- for a Cuban place to mess up even a basic pork dish would be shameful, but luckily Cafe Laguardia didn't disappoint. The bar was impressive, and the mojitos were delicious. I will definitely return to Cafe Laguardia, though probably not before trying out some of the other major players in the Chicago Cuban scene.",0.9555,0.82,0.127,0.052,0.5244340924775708

It's a long slice of skirt steak with a small cup of what tasted like microwaved yellow rice and a few pieces of lettuce /w a half slice of tomato, both were above $14 which wouldn't have bothered me if I didn't feel like my wife could've prepared the food better at home for less than half the price.

Those were some of the things that were overheard during our lunch yesterday at Cafe Laguardia. A family owned restaurant and one of many exotic restaurants you will find in Chicago's Bucktown neighborhood, the place greatly lives up to the billing of serving quality Cuban cuisine. Going off of recommendations of a handful of friends and armed with a groupon deal, I decided to take my siblings and try the place out. For starters, we dined on the vegan Cuban nachos: tortilla chips covered with refried beans, guacamole, tomatoes, onions and sour cream. It tasted OK, although the sauce that came with it gave it a nice kick (couldn't figure out what it was nor was it on the menu....hmmm). For the main course, my sisters both had the oxtail stew and loved it. The dish had red wine and was seasoned with spices; and came with rice and beans and yucca in a homemade mojo sauce (garlic, onions and olive oil). I had the Taste of Cuba; a ""meat sampler"" platter that had shredded beef, ground beef and fried pork medallions, fried green plantain, sweet plantain, ham croquette, boiled cassava, white rice and black bean stew. Cooked well and very, very tasty. Unfortunately, all three of us were so stuffed with food (and my sister, being the lightweight that she was, whining about her headache after drinking half a pitcher of sangria) that we didn't get the chance to try dessert. Ah well. The ambiance had a nice authentic South American feel to it: murals on the walls, fake palm trees in one corner, Latin music playing in the background. Although the animal prints were a bit odd. But still, it had a nice feel to it. Waiter was nice and we tipped him well.

My friend, my toddler and I went in on a Wednesday afternoon. It seemed as though we were the only people in the restaurant.  We were seated right away by a nice lady who walked us to our table towards where the restroom area is.  On the way, a young woman was standing in a doorway where we would need to get through to get to the table we were seated at. The woman at the doorway stared us down as we approach, she sees us coming but doesnt move. Mind you, I have a toddler in one arm and a Bulky diaper bag in the other. Anyway, just something I noticed. We were seated and within two minutes or so, the same woman at the doorway is sitting on the edge of the table across from us and with a blank stare says nothing. Holds up her little waitress pad and waits for one of us to speak. We asked for a few minutes. Since we'd never been and needed to look at the menu.  The waitress actually rolls her eyes and walks away. My friend and I just kinda smiled at the same time. I guess we both felt the awkwardness.  I am a quick picker. Gotta keep it moving kinda gal and my friend is not so much, she was not sure of an item on the menu. She asked the waitress to explain the difference. Waitress didnt know the difference. So we went with something else. For starters, we ordered the cuban nachos. While we anticipated having a good meal, we see the nice lady who seated us walking around  with a bottle of Clorox bleach. Cleaning the walls and such. It wreaked of Clorox for a while.  Our nachos came and sadly, not only did they look absolutely nothing like the picture on their website but they were soggy or perhaps stale, undercooked tostones with a few measly dices of tomato, some sort of melted cheese sauce and a sloppy slap of sour cream. So disappointed. I was expecting some love to go into the food.  Next, we also ordered the special of the day. Which was The Fried Steak with onions. It was not noted to be a spicy entree when I read the menu. Had I known, I would have gone with something else. It was very very spicy.

2012-04-12,4.0,"Our next door neighbors brought us here for dinner one night and we had a wonderful time.  Of course a big part of that was our neighbors, who we love dearly, but the place was fun and the food was good.  We were there for three-and-a-half hours, and it seemed like no time at all.  Service remained attentive and friendly, and nobody bugged us about sitting for that length of time. I see people complaining about the decor, and yeah it's kind of funky, but I liked it; I thought it was nicely pulled together, and worked for the space.  (And as my taste is impeccable even when it's bad, you can take that to the bank.)  Of course the real stars here are the food and drink.  I tried a bit of everything off the sampler platter, some oxtail stew, black bean soup and sweet plantains, and everything was excellent.  I like my black bean soup a little chunkier, but the flavor was good, which is the important thing.   The drinks were terrific, too.  Mojitos are excellent, and the sangria is terrific.  Sangria is hit or miss for me since many places serve stuff that tastes like watered down cheap red wine with some fruit thrown in as an afterthought.  Not so at Laguardia where the sangria had big flavor as well as being delightfully potent.  We polished off several pitchers of the stuff over the course of the evening. The only real downside is parking.  The neighborhood is pretty densely populated and finding a space is not easy.  Still, it was worth the trouble, and I can't wait to go back.",0.9961,0.689,0.243,0.068,0.5646198830409357

2012-03-27,4.0,"I liked this place! I went with a Google offer ($20 for $40) on a Monday night, and it was pretty quiet. I can't compare with when it's busy, but probably because it was a slower night, our waiter came right away and we were well taken care of the whole night.  We started with drinks. My bf ordered the Caipirinha (which I later tasted--really good!), and I ordered the Strawberry Margarita. Then right after our waiter walked away, I realized--holy crap--I missed the very obvious ""MANGO MARGARITA"" section at the top! I ran up to the bar and asked if I could change it, and he kinda laughed at me and said of course. Such a good decision...I mean, I'm sure the strawberry would've been good, but the mango? DELICIOOOOUS!  Then we ordered our food (we ordered everything vegetarian, fyi): for appetizers, we got the Cuban Nachos, which were simple and delicious. I love the tostones instead of chips. Without the salsa though, they might have been a little bland...but then again, I'm a hot sauce person. We also got the Queso Fundido, which I wasn't very impressed by. It was really just a bowl of melted cheese, with a dollop of sour cream in the middle. Now I know that's what it's supposed to be, but...come on, some color, perhaps? For entrees, we both had the Cuban Veggie Combo, which included: black beans, white rice, fried plantains (YUM!!), fried cassava (yuca) with onions, a small salad, and sauteed green peppers. The peppers were supposed to be corn (as described on the menu), but our waiter informed us when setting down our plates that the corn mixture was out, and he hoped green peppers were OK. I actually don't like corn and love green peppers, so this was fine with me. However, he should have let us know before he put in our order that this was the case. That was my only misgiving about the service.  The veggie plates in general were very good, filling, and for the most part, healthy. Only thing was, I requested extra hot sauce...without it, again, I think the food might have been a little bland. But then again, I'm no expert on Cuban food and I know a lot of gringos assume all Latino food is supposed to be spicy like Mexican food, so it might just be my expectations tricking me. All in all, good restaurant. Great atmosphere, attentive staff, solid food and drinks. Even w/o the Google coupon, prices were very reasonable. I plan to return. BTW, I read a bunch of Yelp reviews before I went, and I'm always baffled by what some people consider ""negative"" aspects of a business. For example, some people wrote that the chairs appeared dirty because they're leopard print. Those spots are clearly part of the print, and all restaurant chairs are probably more or less equally sanitary. Who cares?",0.9963,0.803,0.156,0.041,0.5009126984126986

I said well, how about steak in my steak sandwich. At this point she was not rude or anything and took it back to the kitchen. I waited as my husband finished his food. We sat there for a while and I finally got my other half back, retoasted way too much but now with meat. When the bill came I kind of expected it to be comp'd or at the very least a discount.

It's inescapable, but no one could ever accuse them of not committing to their schtick. Next, the mojito (or the cuba libre or the pitcher of sangria... whatever floats your Havana-bound boat).  Then, my favorite part of Laguardia: the nachos nachos nachos! Made on pressed plantain chips with guac, sour cream, salsa, cheese, chicken (or your choice of meat). I've had these here twice and they are just so damned tasty that they don't last long on the table. I wish the portion was a little bigger because it's painful to share these eight delectable bites. After the nachos, the Cuban sandwich wasn't very exciting. From my limited Cuban food experience, I'd say it was fairly authentic, but the lesson is that authentic cubanos are just not that exciting in general. My favorite Cuban sandwiches have always been slightly non-traditional versions, so I should've known betta. Next time, the jibarrito is MINE.",-0.6859,0.766,0.098,0.136,0.5292328042328043

I've been bringing friends here for years and have never had a bad experience.  Cafe Laguardia is a tropical oasis in the middle of Chicago. I particularly like coming here on a cold winter day, because once you step foot inside, it's like being transported to a tropical island. You'll forget about the miserable Chicago weather inside these four walls, and eat like you're on vacation.  Laguardia has the best Cuban food in Chicago. Go ahead and try to find better Cuban in Chicago, you won't. Simple things like rice and beans are fantastic, the pork is perfectly cooked, even more exotic dishes like garlic shrimp are expertly prepared. The Cuban nachos are a plantain-lover's delight. My favorite item on the menu isn't even Cuban, it's the Jibarito sandwich. Every sandwich should use plantains instead of bread. I could eat those for breakfast, lunch and dinner.

2011-05-12,3.0,"Went here for a delayed Cinco de Mayo celebration. I know there's a glaring cultural error here but whatever; we had groupons to burn.  Thanks to reservations, a 2 hour wait became ""come right in"".  The space is big but cramped nonetheless.  The walkways are narrow and the tables are really close.  The decor was wall paintings with cuban/tropical themes; very dim lighting made it hard to see. They could feng shui it up a bit. Service was a little slow but good.  Our server made some very good recommendations and was very knowledgeable overall.  I can't really say if the slow service was because of a slow bartender/kitchen, which would be unfair to her. We started with yucca, empanadas, and cuban nachos (tostones).  The garlic sauce that came with the yucca fries definitely improved a bland dish. Empanadas were unremarkable and surprisingly leaky. The tostones themselves were good but the toppings weren't anything special, seemed kind of runny. I ordered the pulled pork. the pork itself was very tender but the tomato based sauce definitely needed some salt. The yellow rice was very good with bacon in it.  The iceberg lettuce side was an afterthought.  The plate could have greatly benefited from a substantial veggie. Other things I tried: the oxtail stew was amazing and the best thing there; tender and flavorful. The red snapper was alright but fresh fish with a good sauce isn't too hard to come by. The Sabor de Cuba was a very plantain heavy medley, but had a good sampling.  The flan was small but very light and tasty. I had the coconut mojito at the advice of my server and it was very refreshing. I tasted the passionfruit and that was good but too sweet for my tastes. My buddy's caipirinha had a very heavy pour. The beer selection was as expected for a latin restaurant. I'd go back for the oxtail and that's about it.  But I would like to try the pork sandwich that uses plantains instead of bread.  It's good food but the venue could definitely be improved by taking away a few tables.  If anything, it's worth a try just for something different.",0.9972,0.766,0.201,0.033,0.4744001831501833

With no apology the right empanadas came out another 20 minutes later.  We ordered as soon as we could seeing that service was super slow!

After about 15 minutes the waiter came back without a menu to tell me that they were out of the Red Snapper! I had to ask for a menu to reorder only to find that 4 out of 8 fish dishes were made with the Red Snapper! I ended up ordering a Chile Relleno that was a blob of cheese and no flavor.

There was a short wait, mostly because of a very large party sitting at a table in the middle of the restaurant. Wonder how they swung that because I tried to make reservations and was told they did not take them on the weekends. So we get there, and I sit in a little lounge-like area with eclectic couches to wait for the rest of my party to arrive. It was then I was told that the computer systems were down, with no end in sight, so I would have to pay cash for my meal. They then pointed to the old looking ATM and said I can get money from there. Maybe it's just me, but I refuse to pay outrageous ATM fees and always plan ahead when I know I'll need cash, so that put me in a slightly irritated mood.  Next, we were seated at this table that was half in the restaurant area and half in the lounge area. It was rather loud, so it was difficult to hear. Oh, and there were some screaming kids running around in the lounge area too. Not a good place to bring your kids on a Friday night. I'll get to the food. The cuban nachos were actually kind of good. There wasn't that much steak on it though. I did enjoy the spicy sauce they give you to put on top. I had the vegetarian fajitas. Pretty standard - grilled onions and peppers with guac, raw tomato, and rice. I did think it was weird they served iceberg salad with it that wasn't cut up or shredded at all. My mojito was pretty good too. I had the passion fruit and it was tasty. We had a groupon, so the meal was a good deal. Not sure if I'd go back without a groupon though.",0.9747,0.791,0.136,0.073,0.49587148962148964

The music was highly entertaining, a Cuban band (imagine that) which really added to the feel of the restaurant. Most importantly, the food was wonderful and (since Mojitos are the Tuesday night drink special), my mango Mojito was sweet and refreshing.  Everything is reasonably priced, especially for the quantity you get.  I could make a meal out of the empanadas alone.  The black bean soup was amazing, so smooth and creamy, but not heavy at all; just very warm and inviting.  The pulled pork was really tender and just the right amount of spicy; we said probably a number 3.  Now I am of Polish decent and I don't do really spicy, but this was very flavorful, not hot per se.  You can choose between white rice and beans (black or red) or yellow rice made with ham and bacon.  Of course I went with the yellow rice and it tasted so authentic, just like my friend from Puerto Rico makes (shush - don't tell her).  My dinner companion ordered the Cuban sandwich and for research purposes only, I was allowed a couple bites of his amazing sandwich.  All I can say is that I want to go back for lunch so I can have a whole one to myself.

Now on to the food.  I have to agree with one of the earlier reviewers who said the cuban nachos tasted like they came from a bag, box, or can.  Each plantain was loaded with guacamole and sour cream, with just a few scraps of ""steak"" thrown on top. I ordered the house special red snapper, which did have tons of flavor.  I would have enjoyed it better if the chef took off all the scales and the skin.  Not very appetizing, and for the price, I expect to have my fish cleaned properly. Our waiter was not very attentive at all.  He came by to take our drink and food order and we barely saw him after that.  He seemed to have been doing a fly-bly with everything - just dropped off the food and was gone before we could ask for anything.  He never asked how the food was or if we needed anything.  I know he was busy but that's no excuse.  He had to be flagged down when he was in the area and had to be reminded of everything - the bread, the second round of drinks, the arroz con gandules, water, the check.

Sincerely, Guy who is now questioning the gospel that is the Food Network. I met my wife there on a Wednesday night around 7:15, and although the restaurant was busy, we were seated right away.  Nevermind that I had to be careful of the sharp ledge jutting out from the wall next to my head during the entire meal.  As for ordering, we did our usual negotiation of a mix of healthy and not-so-healthy items, finally deciding on the black bean soup, cuban nachos, and red snapper. I wasn't aware of it when I ate it, but the black bean soup was the highlight of the meal.  It was rich, smooth, and filling.  The only complaint (which seems to be a theme in these reviews) is that it needed just a little more spice.  Nothing to write home about, but I did appreciate that it was vegetarian. The cuban nachos were, in a word, ""interesting.""  I'm not a huge plantain fan but I figured when in Rome, why not substitute normal chips for plantains?  Well, now I know why.  Everything on the plate tasted like it came from a bag, box or can.  That doesn't necessarily mean it was gross, but I honestly felt cheated.  If that is ""authentic Cuban,"" I think I'll pass on going to Havana anytime soon.   I had high hopes for the snapper but it let me down too.  The fish itself was, well, too fishy.  If you're going to serve red snapper and tout it as one of your signature items, please make sure to use a high quality cut of fish.  The sauce, I have to say, was delicious.  It was thick, tasty, and full of vegetables.  Unfortunately, there was so much of it on the plate the fish was practically swimming in it.   Overall, I can't recommend this place to kosherites/vegetarians/vegans.  They say you can never have too much of a good thing.  Well, when it comes to Cafe Laguardia, too much of a bad thing is never good either.  Rachael Ray, a groupon, and an entire section of the menu devoted to vegetarians got me here.  None of them will get me to come back.   [Thanks for reading my review and be sure to check out my other reviews on Yelp.  My mission is to find restaurants that have great vegetarian, kosher, and vegan fare.  On every review, I rate food, service, atmosphere, and value on a 1-5 scale to give you quick and easy overview of the restaurant.  I love cooking, eating, and doing both with my friends and family.  I always welcome your questions, comments, and suggestions so contact me on Yelp or Facebook if you want to share ideas.]",0.9965,0.758,0.18,0.062,0.5281459435626102

There are colored Christmas lights, faux palm trees and every type of animal print that mother nature produces, Eclectic?.  Leopard print and cow print upholstered chairs dare I say clash with the cheetah and tiger painted air ducts lining the ceiling. For the life of me I can't figure out where the geckos on the walls are supposed to fit in to that mix. Though I do love the soft salsa music playing in the background. There are some really nice seating areas up front with cushy chairs and couches and if you come with a group of 6-8 be sure to ask for the really cute canopied table in the back corner! The lighting is so dim that we had to read our menus by candle light and for that I will be sending Cafe Laguardia my next Optometrist bill.  The coconut mojito was delicious though quite sweet, as in I could feel the sugar granules when I drank it. Sangria was good but someone forgot to put in those fresh fruit chunks so we thought it was real homemade sangria and not just wine in a glass, hmm. Apparently, I am hard to please. We started with the steak Cuban nachos as they were the one constant in all the previous reviews.

We were both feeling pretty full off of our appetizers so we opted to get sandwiches.

We started with tamales which were decent- but Tamale's guy blow's them away!     We made the mistake of both ordering the red snapper, you know, the one endorsed by Rachel Ray and 'Check Please.'  Either this entree was not what was served to RR, or well, she must be a total sell out, because the fish was tough and over cooked.  My husband verbalized exactly what I was thinking- the sauce tasted like chicken broth from a can mixed with corn starch.  Really?  19 dollars a pop for that?  I only ate half, and that was because I was sooo hungry-  Mojito's aren't bad, but nothing worth a special trip.  Definitely agree that 90 miles is MUCH better, and less than half the price.   Check out Senior Pan's at Cicero and Fullerton for some amazing Ropa  Vieja and cuban coffee- a real unknown gem!",0.9471,0.771,0.148,0.081,0.47242063492063496
2011-01-16,2.0,"Went for an early dinner tonight (Sunday) because we had a groupon.  It was not a horrible experience, but I left feeling ripped off, even with the groupon, still hungry after eating everything and all around annoyed with the theme. So I guess this place is supposed to be brazillian with some puerto rican style, so that being said it had an animal theme? (zebra painted ceiling and chairs, leapord curtains....) It reminded me of a cheap adult hotel theme. We sat down and I guess they only had ONE server for the whole restaurant, because she was our hostess and waitress who kept forgetting about us.  Right after she asked if we'd like drinks, I thought ""HHMM green tea mojito?! (which was their speciality) I've never heard of that""! So upon her question of what I wanted to drink I replied with green tea mojito.  She regretfully declined to tell me they did not have that today, then suggested five different really sweet flavors all of which did not sound appealing to me.  So I went with the standard, lime.  Ready to order appetizers, we ordered the gaucomole. Our waitress once again regretfully declined our request saying that they do not have any avocados!!!! Okay, well we need a little bit of time to think then.  She came back with my mojito, which was a boring glass FILLED with ice and sugar at the bottom.  Kind of like when you put too much sugar in an iced coffee and taste the sugar crystals through the straw, yeah, yuck.  and that was $7.00.  What a waste of my $7.00. Since they did not have guacomole I feel they should have just given us chips and salsa for free instead of the 2.25 they normally charge, while we wait and decide another option.  Oh well, we chose not to get an appetizer since they all looked deep fried and unappealing.  For our entree, I went with the red snapper dish ""featured on rachel rae and check please"" and my boyfriend went with the oxtail stew.  My red snapper was good, but not as big as I was hoping for $20.00.  For $20.00 the red snapper came on a bed of rice with onions and ONE...that's right.. ONEEEEE shrimp on top.  The red snapper was fine, something I'd usually pay maybe $8.00 for.  But $20.00 and to think I finished the whole plate and was still hungry.  What a rip off. My boyfriend kind of liked his ox tail stew, and at least that came with rice, beans, and pieces of lettuce on the side, althought I'm not quite sure if that was supposed to be a salad or decoration.  That was also a waste of $20.00. Also, THREE different times during our meal, the waitress asked if I wanted another drink.  NO I DON'T WANT ANOTHER $7.00 ""MOJITO"" FILLED WITH ICE WITH SUGAR CRYSTALS CRUNCHING IN MY TEETH.

We ordered some chips and salsa and Cuban Firecrackers to start (neither were worth the effort) If a Latin restaurant feels the need to actually charge money for chips and salsa ($2.25, and I'm of the belief that they should be included with dinner, just like bread and oil is gratis at every Italian restaurant I've eaten in the last 20 years) then at least bring me salsa in a bowl, NOT one of those little plastic take out cups that I get from Chipotle (oh, Chipotle's salsa and steak have more flavor than this place too). As for those Firecrackers, have you ever had those Taquitos? Taquitos are better. My date had the Spicy Cuban Pulled Pork and I had the Skirt Steak - both meh. The steak, other than the grilled onions, was bland and flavorless, The pulled pork was slightly better than the steak, but you can find better at a half-dozen places within 6 blocks (90 Miles comes to mind as well as Las Palmas).

2010-12-04,3.0,"Food, service, atmosphere - however you cut it, Laguardia comes out just fine. It's really ...just...fine. In other words, it's not so much great as agreeable.  Distinctively agreeable - if that makes sense. Mostly reasonable prices, ample portions, swift and attentive service. Quality. No complaints. No blandness. At the least, your expectations will be met, and they may be exceeded.  I got the red snapper, the most eminently safe choice since the menu touted it ""as featured on Rachel Ray and Check Please!"" This embedded advertisement, like the restaurant website itself, screams ""you can trust us!"" And, indeed, it was a fresh, large portion, complemented well by a light, peppery sauce.  My wife got the veggie burrito, which was flavorsome, though we both prefer black beans over refried pinto. The shrimp empanada did not skimp on the meat and cheese, and the nachos, by substituting plantains for tortillas, were not only unique and tasty but plated apart from each other to minimize stringiness and mess.. If you're pining for a new place but have guests from out of town - whether foodie snobs or those who eat just to refuel - LaGuardia will do. It's a really safe bet.   I want to impart that this feels like a place where you'd really like to try everything on the menu, and particularly the seafood. That's not the same as saying the kitchen necessarily knocks everything out of the park. It probably bats high, hitting for singles (veggie burrito) or doubles (snapper). For being so extensive, the menu lacks filler. Or exoticness. Whether hot spicy garlic shrimp, three varieties of snapper, a conventional grilled vegetable plate or a Maui pineapple pork thing, I'd be surprised if anything comes out wrong.   I should mention the décor is a bit chintzy. Frankly, I don't make the biggest deal out of ambience anywhere, yet I would not judge anyone who does. Whatever floats your boat. And if that boat does not have white leopard skin chair backs, loungy lighting and storefront windows, then that's something to consider.  At the same time, what I'd really like to do when I go back is just drink since the coaches up front look preposterously comfortable.",0.9519,0.847,0.1,0.053,0.48486832611832614

So we went in, noticed the place was small. Whatever, we were seated right away.  We were still waiting for the third person in our party so we didn't order yet and were just lookin through the menu.   Next thing you know, they were seating a big party next to our table, where it was set up for a big party (multiple tables to seat at least 8 people).  I guess they needed more chairs because they decided to add another table to that row of tables.  Therefore they had to more our table over, and caging my friend between the big party table, the wall, and our table. So I asked our waiter if we can move to the empty table across from us so we can be more comfortable.  He goes to ask permission, but returns saying it's reserved for another party.  It would have been fine but he asked that we move to another table, which is ""roomy"" and we would have all the room we wanted.  I said why can't we just stay here at our spot, since they removed the extra table from the large party.  He goes, oh we're going to add this table to that party. I thought this was rude, I didn't ask to move all the way to the other end of the restaurant, but whatever, he said we'd have plenty of room... WRONG! We went to a smaller table at the dark end of the restaurant, where I can barely read my menu.  We had to steal another votive candle from another table just so we can see each other's faces.  We also go the draft from the door. URGH. Finally, our friend arrived and we were able to order.  Food is alright.  I got the Brazilian Red Snapper, Bahia style.  It's good but it sounded better on the menu.  A friend had the Taste of Cuba... all fried food, nothing that blew me away. As the restaurant got more crowded, we noticed our waiter kind of showing signs that he wanted us to get up and leave.  Yes I noticed that it's getting crowded and people are waiting for seats but... you do not get rude to your customers and hint that they should leave.  Anyway, the waiter gives us our bill.  We take our time on it.  He comes back and asks if we need a few more minutes for our bill. WTF. WHO ASKS THAT??  URGH SO UNPROFESSIONAL.  Anyway we got the hint, we gave our payment.  But of course, we wanted to stay and chat some more (I hardly see these girls together so of course we wanted to catch up).  He comes back again asking if everythiing was OK.  I get it, watever.  I ain't leaving.   In the back of my head, I was seriously thinking if they were going to force us out.  Lo and behold... it came through.  In the middle of a good conversation, the waiter actually came up to our table and asked us to get up and go to the bar because the wait time was long.  I was so dismayed at how they handled that.  There were other people there who sat longer than us, how come they weren't asked to leave?  We were having a conversation and he interrupts mid-sentence to ask us to leave?  I DON'T GET WHAT KIND OF RESTAURANT ASKS YOU TO LEAVE JUST BECAUSE THEIR WAIT TIME IS LONG.   It ain't my problem!  Give them a longer wait time, maybe they'll go somewhere else!  Probably go somewhere BETTER with better service.   THIS PLACE BLOWS WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE AGAIN.  Rude waiters, RUDE RUDE RUDE..

I've wanted to try Cafe Laguardia for some time; I'd bought a Groupon months ago and finally decided to put it to use. They don't take reservations for parties of less than 4, but I figured it would be pretty dead the Tuesday before Thanksgiving - I was wrong. By the time we left the place was pretty packed.  The inside of this place is eclectic; animal print up the yin, tropical plants, vibrant decor and dim lighting. It could be good for a romantic date... or a meal with someone you don't want to be seen with.  We started with the mojitos, on special for $5. I was a little bummed that our server didn't tell me that all flavors were on special until after I got my drink, but in hindsight I probably would've gone with the standard one anyway. The drinks were good, in my book they're second to the mojitos at Adobo, just the right amount of sugar to make it tasty, but not overly sweet.  My dining parter-in-crime and I struggled over what to order. My issue was that the veggie options didn't seem Cuban so much as Mexican (burritos, quesadillas, nachos), a few with a Cuban twist. Granted, I know nothing about Cuban cuisine so there may be more overlap than I realize.  We started out with two shrimp empanadas. These are fried, not baked, and come with a medium salsa-like sauce; they were quite tasty. For dinner, I ordered the burrito caliente and a side of fried cassava. The burrito was enormous, I barely made it through half and enjoyed the rest for dinner the next night. The caliente sauce was quite tasty and not oppressively spicy. It had a thin, soupy consistency rather than a a chunkier salsa-like texture. The cassava was good; the pieces were cut similar to steak fries and the texture reminded me of the spicy fries my HS cafeteria served. The garlic dipping sauce was a nice complement.  Service was friendly, but the timing was off; way off. Our server was nice, but she disappeared for long stretches at a time. At least one table seated after us seemed to get many of their dishes faster so it seemed unlikely it was due to a kitchen backup. Throughout the meal I expected her to forget items or foul up our order, but fortunately she never did.  The food was good, the portions were generous and the prices were reasonable.

Not that these were necessarily bad, but they definitely paled in comparison to the above. These were slightly bland and needed a kick.  Stuffed Mashed Potato. This was more like a ball of shredded beef surrounded by fried dough. Sort of like a meat hushpuppy. Very crispy. Unfortunately, this also tasted more on the bland side. The Ugly: Beef Empanada.  No, the accompanying salsa could not save this one. Very bland and boring. Carnivale wins on this one. Decor. I don't really get the overdecorating with animal print.

I was a bit disappointed that the standards like the guac and margaritas were not up to par. My friend's mojito was much better than my margarita. My steak, served with black beans and rice, was tender, juicy, and flavorful. My friend's combination plate was phenomenal!

I went here about a month ago for an early lunch after kayaking.  Had a jibarito and loved it.  Now, it's no jibarito from Borinquen, but (1) this is Cuban and (2) this isn't exactly the same type of place.  I forget what my friend had, but he enjoyed his food so much so that he ate it all. Jibaritos aren't really meant to be re-heated, but it tasted pretty damn good cold so it all worked out. After missing a movie the other night I decided I wanted Cuban when I realized I had a groupon for this place.  Carlos was there and is just so polite that I couldn't be mad about anything if I wanted to.  Now, when I came here for lunch a month ago it as if we didn't have a server, but it wasn't long after they opened so I'll be forgiving since I'm going to assume they were still getting things ready. The other night our waitress was great until the very end, when she was hard to find, but it was also getting busy.  A waiter asked if I needed anything when he saw me looking, so honestly, it wasn't a huge deal. The food!  Since I've had the ""Taste of Cuba"" before and didn't feel like a sandwich I ordered a delicious chicken dinner.  I don't remember what it was called, but it had sauteed onions and the flavor was perfect.  Before that I decided I wanted appetizers and the Papas Rellenas were PERFECT!  I enjoy NOT tasting oil when I bite into those, and I didn't.  Also got the queso fundido which hit the spot (and pretty much filled me up)....my mom ordered a soup that I love, but when it comes to soup it usually isn't hard to please me.  The only thing I wasn't crazy about was the empanada, which was shrimp & cheese, but I didn't try it until the next day when it was cold.  However, it's served with a mango salsa (or mango something) that was quite good.   It was nice to try something different and not be disappointed.",0.9976,0.733,0.216,0.051,0.6282520325203252

2010-10-21,5.0,"Cafe Laguardia has some of the friendliest staff at any restaurant I've ever eaten at.  As soon as I arrived, a little early for my reservation, I was greeted with a smile, handshake, hand on shoulder by the rotund owner (at least I assumed it was the owner) and shown a place at the bar. From there, the bartender was attentive and was able to provide a kickass margarita on the rocks in short order, a drink I usually stay away from because of my body's natural disgust for Tequila. WARNING: They mix em strong. Tasty, but strong. What I thought would be a nice pre-dinner drink quickly turned into a drink I'd have to pace out over dinner as well. Dinner was fantastic. We started with a sampler platter which was unfortunately a retread of a lot of traditional bar food (chicken wings, quesadillas, etc. However, they also came with a range of sauces, including one particularly spicy one that I LOVED but couldn't get the name. If you go, it's orange, and it has a bit of a kick. The entrees were where the good really came through. The Ropa Vieja was especially delicious, which I'll admit was very surprising, considering the dish's name essentially means ""Old Laundry."" :-P It's a shredded pork dish in a tomato sauce that has just the right amount of moisture and meat so that it's not dry, but not sloppy.  The Lechon Asado is a marinated pork dish that was respectable, paired with onions and peppers. The Pollo Al Alijo is a similar skillet dish mixing chicken with onions and peppers. This is probably my only complaint on the evening as I personally felt that they overdid it on the onions/peppers and overcooked the chicken a bit. A spanish rice dish with little meaty prizes sprinkled throughout  and some delicious black beans complemented the meal perfectly. Dessert was flan in a carmel sauce and it had the cool, rigid, gooey texture that you know and love from flan. Back to the friendly: we came in a large group, on a weeknight, and the waiter came around with a round of shots for us! It was some mixture of triple sec, rum, and some other fruity concoction. I'd never order one in a bar, but for the tropical evening, it was perfect. As I left, I thanked the owner for having us, and the man practically put me in a bear hug! What a place! Despite the loud music being played by the cover band which mostly played a 70s-80s-90s mix (Toni Braxton, TLC, Donna Summer, Gloria Gaynor, etc.), I'd recommend Cafe Laguardia as a place for a night out with friends, or for a date (just get a table in the back), and call ahead because there is not much seating capacity.

I love Cuban food so I have really been itching to get here. I started out with a Caipirinha which was one of the best I ever had! My girl got the mojito and it was just as good. They both ran about $7...They had a $2 beer special, but because of the deliciousness of the drinks we totally forgot about the beer special. The beer is normally $4 according to the menu and they have a decent selection. To eat, I chose the Chicken Fricasee which included tomato sauce along with bell peppers, onions & yellow rice (you can choose white rice if you like). It was really delicious! The real star was the Taste of Cuba which included shredded beef, ground beef, pork medallions, green plantains, sweet plantains, ham croquette, boiled cassava and your choice of rice and beans. Totally blew me away how good both dishes were. Our server was really cool. He told us the best nights to come and that they have live performances on Tuesday and Wednesdays. I love the look of the place as they have dim lighting to set a nice latin mood.

Our second appetizer was Yuca... choice between steamed or fried - we chose steamed. It was like an extremely dense potato. Very thick and starchy and interesting.

2010-06-23,4.0,"My Chicago friends told me that this Cuban restaurant had a lot of buzz around it when it first opened and that it was at one point very difficult to get a reservation. From what I had heard, I was expecting another sleek, trendy restaurant with modern furniture and hip waiters and was surprised to find this very unique, funky looking place.  There's animal print everywhere: on the chairs, walls, pipes. The lighting is very dark and the overall ambience is a very funky, eclectic mix.  As soon as we sat down, we dove right into their drink menu, which featured a long list of fruit mojitos and even a Cuban sangria. I went with a pineapple mojito and it set the tone perfectly for the meal to come.  As for the service, it was quick and efficient if not especially friendly. The waitress didn't seem to be the smiliest lady on earth, but she answered all of our questions and got our dishes out with a quickness. Our large group started with the Cuban nachos, which pile meat, salsa, cheese, and other goodies onto big pieces of fried plantain. Heaven! We loved them so much that as soon as we finished our first round, we ordered a second.  I had a very hard time deciding on my dish because the entire menu looked so temping. In addition to classic dishes like Ropa Vieja, there was also a salad and 'south of the border' section. I decided on the pork chops with yellow rice, as I was having a hankering for pork. All of our orders were enormous, piled high with rice and beans on the side. My two pork chops could probably feed a small family yet I still managed to get through one of them with no problem. I had  a taste of my neighbor's shrimp dish and really enjoyed that as well.  As we all know, no matter how big your entrée is, there's always room for dessert. We ordered some rice pudding to share and it was absolutely delectable - perfectly chilled, topped with some whipped cream. I had to literally talk to myself as I kept diving in for another spoonful: ""Stop. Eating. Now.""

There is no such thing as too sour for me, and the lemon mojito was yummioso. Equally as yummioso were the Cuban Nachos-- plantain nachos served as individual bites. So, unlike some nachos where you are desperately scooping up the toppings, each individual nacho had a bit of each of the toppings--brilliant, simple and delicious. I tried the chicken and beef, and each one provided everything you could want in a primo nacho. These were definitely the highlight of the meal... oh, and the rice pudding! My main entrée, the chicken in garlic sauce, wasn't too shabby either.  The atmosphere was dark and eclectic. If you take issue with animal prints and mismatched chairs and tables, then this might not be the place for you. Yes, it is a bit bohemian inside, and a tad dark for me. The menus are proof that the place has stood the test of time, as they are tattered and worn, but after a couple of mojitos the décor scheme is probably the perfect thing. There was live music--Alicia Keys covers, not really Cuban.  If you decide to give it a shot, go for mojitos, nachos and pudding. That's my advice",0.8774,0.907,0.071,0.022,0.5468671679197994

Also, the mojitos were disappointing and did not taste as they do at other Cuban restaurants.  A few months ago we ate at Siboney and that food was very good.

However, to the good, we tried the appetizers; the wings, sweet fried plantains, stuffed mashed potatoes, guacamole and the empanada. The wings and plantains were AMAZING! Probably some of the best in the city. The stuffed mashed potato was horrid, what the heck was I thinking ordering it. The guac was way expensive for two tablespoons of guac, and some hard chips for 7 bucks! the empanada was good, but when you bit into it, oil or juice or whatever started spewing out down your arm.

Here are the items we ordered/tasted: 1) Cuban Nachos = ground beef, sour cream and salsa atop a crunchy deep fried plantain crisp 2) Fire Crackers = rolled taco made of ground beef with a sweet salsa 3) Stuffed Mashed Potatoes = a ball of mash potato with a ground been filling, deep fried 4) Cuban sandwich = ham, cheese, bread Overall flavor = lacking. I was expecting flavor and spice. This place fell short for me. I wanted to like it based on some other Cuban dishes I've had. I did like the live music that started playing at 8 pm, that was a nice touch but I would have much rather have better quality food.",0.8845,0.865,0.112,0.023,0.4244791666666667

Awesome. 4.  The vibe is awesome in there and many nights they have live music that makes the place sound authentic.  Awesome. 3 thumbs up!",0.9879,0.713,0.237,0.05,0.6236842105263157
2010-03-20,5.0,"Cafe Laguardia - oh how I love you so! The place is off the beaten path and not very close to public transportation (5 or so blocks from the Western Blue line stop) but I promise your dining experience will be absolutely  worth the trek.  Walking into the restaurant you are transported to the wonderful world of Cuban culture. I don't know if it was the warmth of the restaurant as I walked in from the blistering cold of Armitage, the jolly greeting from the spray tanned manager/owner, the lively Cuban beats or the leopard print decor that covers every inch (including the industrial loft style piping on the ceiling) but it made me get into 'vacation mode' and I promptly ordered a Caipirinha followed by a Mojito.  The dining experience was just as wonderful as the environment. The drinks were not only reasonably priced but were certainly strong without hurting the taste. I absolutely recommend trying a Caipirinha, you will be floored by the wonderful flavors of limes, sugar and rum. My fiance and I tried the nachos and a serving of fried plantains with a garlic dipping sauce. DE-LI-CIOUS. The fresh guacamole on the nachos melted in my mouth and the garlic sauce was a wonderful and surprising accompaniment to the plantains.  Since neither of us are connoisseur in Cuban dining, for our main course we both had the A Taste of Cuba dinner and it offered a little bit of everything for our taste buds. Fresh soft plantains, amazingly flavored ground beef, shredded beef, pork medallions, and the list goes on. Every bite provided a fresh, new flavor that left us oohing and ahhing. If you don't already have a favorite Cuban dinner and you love meat as much as I do, then I absolutely recommend trying this platter. The service was a delight and our waiter was doting but allowed us to take our time.   Go to Cafe Laguardia! It's a great place for dates and groups of friends because there's so much to see and the food is ridiculously amazing. You can people watch or have a candle lit romantic dinner and on some nights I've read they even have live music and salsa lessons!",0.9985,0.738,0.239,0.023,0.571082251082251

Guacamole, not too impressed....just some chips with it slapped on the plate and a side of a salsa. I'll pass next time.  I had the jibarito- PERFECT! Highly Suggested.

I also tried the ox tail soup that my friend had, I'm not an OX tail type of girl, but it was good I must admit. Tender, not gamy and large chunks.

Some things I really liked: The margaritas were pretty good ($9 for the top shelf version), and the ropa vieja was decent ($13.99 I believe). All in all, the four members of the group seemed to be pretty happy with the food. There were some things I didn't like, however. It was so dark in there that we practically needed to use flashlights to read our menus. The men's bathroom is really tiny and cramped (for a tall guy at least). The chips/guac/salsa appetizer is ridiculously small and overpriced. Also, our drinks and water took forever to be refilled. I'd gripe about spending 40 bucks, but then again it was my choice to get two of the most expensive margaritas, so I guess that's my fault!

Food came reasonably fast and it was good.  Cuban food with a little bit more of a modern twist - but still featured all of the traditional stuff.  My friend ordered some sort of shrimp soup which was delicious, but HUGE.  We had filled up on apps so we were all trying to order something little, and I think her soup was probably about a gallon or so!  But was filled with big shrimp and it was super tasty. The decor is cute and there was some band setting up as were leaving.  Looks like it could be a cute place to grab some drinks and hang out.  But in an area that is overwhelmed with Latin restaurants at really reasonable prices, Cafe Laguardia doesn't necessarily hold up.  I think if I went back it wouldn't be for the food, maybe just for a couple of $5 Tuesday mojitos:)",0.9858,0.852,0.122,0.026,0.6083016777461222

I had the taste of cuba which was more than enough meat for one sitting. The pulled pork was my least favorite (as my friend's pork was more tender and drenched in a delicious soup style hot sauce).

2009-06-15,3.0,"After two beers turned me into a thoroughly-soused hot mess, I stumbled with my mates Don and Brad C. to Cafe Laguardia, reasoning that some late night Cuban vittles would speed up the de-sousing.  Towards that end, Laguardia was a smash hit! A half-jibarito/half-cubano chimera sopped up the pricey beers that made me the undisputed life of the party at the Map Room that night. The jibarito was all sorts of sloppy with steak and mayo slipping and sloshing all over the place. I pined for the toothpicks that Habana Libre uses to maintain the steak/fried plantain integrity. Toothpicks are a small touch to be sure, but you don't realize how important they are until you see the trail of detritus left behind when they're missing. My steak was also a tad on the chewy side, but on the whole the jibarito definitely hit the spot. The cubano was the belle of the sandwich ball that played out on our plates. Compared to Habana Libre, I'd say I prefer the cubano at Laguardia, but the jibaritos at Habana, and obviously at Borinquen, are far superior.  The decor at Laguardia is on the garish side, and I guess that's supposed to evoke the sensuousness of a hideaway along the beaches of Havana or some bullroar like that. I don't know. It strove for swanky awesomeness and fell a bit short. Not a huge problem but, hey, something to consider. Here's an important tip: If you're a young buck with romantic inclinations then I suggest being powerful careful about what food you choose. The jibarito, for example, has an INTENSE garlic mayo that comes with it, and you'll blow your unsuspecting prey clear to Edison Park if you have that stank gassing up the works. If you must indulge in the garlicky goodness then bring Binaca or a toothbrush or wait until you're partner is comfortable with exxxtreme stench.

The menu is extensive...they have Cuban dishes and then they have a page for those diners who complain that they want tacos or burritos.  We started with a bunch of apps.  We had guacamole (eehhh...tasted premade), plantains, and some delicious tamale with meat inside.   My friend (the birthday girl) Susan had the Sabor de Cuba that came with tons of different meats.   She cleaned her plate...actually, most people cleaned their plates.  I had the Fricasse de Pollo, which I ordered with black beans and white rice.  After seeing and tasting the yellow rice I regretted my simple white rice and will make a different choice next time.   With that many people at the table there were all sorts of variety in the entrees...fish, meat, chicken...everyone said that they were satisfied with the food.  And everyone enjoyed their drinks. The only issue...the service was a bit off.  A few people at one end of the table got their food and then another three or four got theirs five or ten minutes later and then the rest...they should have had every food runner prepared to focus on bringing out our food to ensure that people weren't having to say the ""no, please, go ahead and eat, I am sure mine is coming right away"" while drooling over their neighbor's food.  Also, it was difficult to get the server to come to our table to order drinks.   Again, if they had let me make a reservation, there might have been more time for them to prepare to serve a large table.  But, that is the way they work and therefore, unfortunately, their servers and food runners suffer.  The place was pretty packed and they seemed to be able to seat people pretty promptly.  They could probably afford to take a reservation for a table over 8-10 people in order to help the staff run things more smoothly...but that is just MY opinion... They brought out some flan for the birthday girl and the whole bar helped us sing her ""Feliz Cumpleanos"" (actually it was Happy Birthday, but now that I think of it, we should have been  a little more authentic!).

But I never shook that craving, so I came back a few days ago for the Cuban sandwich.  Honestly, it wasn't that good.  They press and toast their Cuban and do not include mustard.  I felt that it needed something extra to jazz it up, but a mediocre Cuban is still worth eating.   I also tried the Cuban firecrackers (appetizer)--chicken, corn, cheese, and beans rolled up and fried in a wonton-style wrapper, served with a sweet, tangy dipping sauce.  Delicious.   They have nearly flawless rice pudding, too.  Perfect consistency, with huge puffy grains of rice like I've never seen, dusted generously with cinnamon.  It might benefit from a TAD more sugar, and raisins too.  The best rice puddings will have raisins cooked into the pudding.  I still give this stuff an A-.",0.9972,0.728,0.251,0.021,0.5656084656084657

The plates come out fairly fast and the dish look terrible. the sad pile of lettuce and tomato that is the house salad is just iceberg and an under ripe tomato. My pork was cooked at least three days ago I'm sure, and there really is no meat. It was 70% fat. My rice was cold and hard and the beans were obviously from a can. My girlfriends chicken was all heat no flavor which i guess i should commend them on because that is actually kind of hard to do.  Here is the kicker though, i ate maybe five bites and the waiter asks if everything is OK and i tell him that it is not good. He takes it and says he is going to speak with a manager , someone else brings us our bill (nothing has been taken off) neither a manager nor our waiter ever comes back. wtf????we left with out making a scene, I may make it my life's work to close that place just out of spite.

2008-11-25,3.0,"Nothing really blew my mind- could've been due to the seating. Came here a few Saturdays with a large group (about 10 of us).  My friend had been wanting to check out this Cuban joint, and Korean bbq had fallen through, so this was our dining destination. Upon getting there, we were told it would take about 45 minutes to accomodate our party.  Somehow that 45 minutes became 5 as they seated us really quickly.  While this normally would've been a good sign, they basically took a table for 6 and made it a table for 10.  Not that comfortable. There was plenty of variety on the menu.  Our table started out with the cuban nachos (plaintains instead of nachos) as well as regular nachos.  Cuban nachos were good, though not very plentiful.  Regular nachos were ok as well. For entrees, we pretty much ran the scope- ropa vieja, ozzabucco, burrito, bifstek, you get the idea.   I ended up trying the sabor de cuba which basically had all things cuban on it (yucca, plantains, fried pork, rice, etc...).  I was very happy with the choice, as it gave me a good sampling of the cusiine, as well as a LARGE portion. The place itself had an interesting look about it.  It was pretty dark, and had lots of animal print curtains and dividers.  It also had colorful lights up, not like holiday ones, but purple and blue ones.   The staff was friendly, though the place was really busy, combined with our party size, so it wasn't stellar by any means.  No real complaints one way or the other. Overall- I'd consider going back, if I was in a smaller group.  It's really close to where my friends live, so it's convenient.  Again, probably not something I would go out of my way to try.

Lets see...considering that the place wasn't busy at all, it took forever for us to get some service.  Plus, they were dragging in refills.  Now...I'm not that kind of person who thinks that their server has to be pretty much hovering and fufilling your every need, inorder for it to be good service.  I just think it's a little ridiculous to eat your entire meal pretty much with an empty cup since you finished the appetizer.  Plus, the waiter was going to take away our plates when we were still eating..? What's up with that?  Now for the food...it was decent.  The Cuban Nachos were really tasty.  I loved the crispy plantains topped with some deliscious guacamole, cilantro, cheese and sourcream with a savory salsa on the side.  For my entree I had the fried porkchops with white rice and black beans.  It was OK.  Not amazing, but not the worst meal I've ever had.  The porkchops were pretty dry though.  Not too much seasoning, just salty with some grilled onions.   Saying all that, I probably would give this place another try, and see maybe I'm missing something here.  Maybe it's a place to really get a good drink and amazing appetizers.   -1 star for dry porkchops -1 star for service",0.9831,0.85,0.117,0.032,0.5422480620155039

I also ADORE the plantain nachos (made with plantain chips instead of corn chips), and like the mojitos very much!  I gave it three stars instead of 4 because service can sometimes be very slow (although sometimes fine), and because once or twice the food wasn't up to the usual fine quality.

I made a reservation for a party of 6 on a Wednesday night. half of our party showed up late and we had an unexpected extra person, but that didn't phase Cafe Laguardia! We pulled up an extra chair and we were good to go. I thought the decor was adorable and really fun, I'd love to come back on a night when they have live music. Red lights, various animal prints on every available surface and a waiter with a great sense of humor. The evening started off great! The bathrooms are hard to find, but I swear - go behind the curtain, you will not walk into the kitchen. The bathroom is just hiding back there. We started with the Cuban nachos and empanadas. The nachos are the reason to go here - they are SO delicious and served on plantain chips. Love it.  A couple people ordered the Taste of Cuba which was a tasty smorgasbord of all things Cuban. Another member of our party had the jibarito - mmm, the steak was so juicy and tender balanced nicely by the perfectly crunchy plantains. I had the croqueta sandwich, I almost peed my pants with delight when I saw this on the menu. I usually have trouble deciding - not this time. I LOVE croquetas and now I can have them as a sandwich? Sold. We also had some side orders of the arroz con gandules, it was not the best I've had although it was very good. Wednesday was $5 margarita night - perfect.  I forewarned Cafe Laguardia that we had a birthday in our party and they sent out a complimentary dessert with a candle. It was lovely. Our table shared a couple desserts, but I can't remember what they were (besides delicious). It's great intimate yet boisterous atmosphere - nice for a date or a large group.

2008-09-04,4.0,"Celebrating the fabulous Angie M.'s birthday here proved that my eyes can still be opened to new and amazing experiences around Chicago, and right in my own backyard no less!! The adorable Café Laguardia nestled among design stores on Armitage right off Damen in Bucktown has managed to elude me for years... I'm not sure how - I'm thinking it's because all the chump guys I've dated before just haven't known to bring me here. It hits all the high notes you need for a perfect date spot (and as we found, for a large group too!). Allow me to elaborate with Brett's 3 steps to getting down like a Cubano:  Step One: Drinks. Whether you start at their cute and intimate bar or just dive right in at your table, their libations are not to be missed. With a crazy long list of mojitos (coconut, lime, banana, raspberry, mango....), sangria, caiprinhas, martinis (don't miss the Witch's Brew) and margaritas that will prohibit you from walking straight, there is something tropical and delicious awaiting to please your thirsty lips.  Step Two: Eat. Well, that is what you came to do, right? The menu is a little overwhelming simply because everything sounds so good. We all needed to consult our waitress because we were positively indecisive with so many mouth-watering options. Think seafood packed paellas, pulled beef with jamon rice in tomato sauce, garlic and butter chicken, bahia-style snapper, to-die-for 'miami vice' short ribs, carne asada, cuban nachos, queso fundido. Hey Pavlov's Dog, are you drooling yet? They have vegetarian options which I'm sure are lovely but this meatetarian brakes for cuban cheesy beef steak and you should too. Pass only on their guacamole, the portion is skimpy and it just wasn't that good, trust me, you're best served with cheese and meat anyhow!  Step Three: Dance. I think certain nights provide live music at Café Laguardia. We had a latin band the night we were there that got several couples out on the dance floor and all of us bopping in our seats. So much fun!! I wanted to shake my groove thang but the aforementioned margaritas prohibited me from walking with grace let alone cutting a rug. Next time for sure, watch out Miami Sound Machine... my rhythm is gonna getcha!  Take all 3 steps and wrap 'em up in nontraditional decor which you'll find is a little disjointed and questionable... think inviting island flare mixed with gigolo animal print bachelor pad. Not exactly stylish, but charming and unexpected... just like the package that is Café LGA. Clearly we had fun, the food was amazing and the company was great.

The owner, Carlos Laguardia, greets you like you are a long lost friend and says ""Mama will seat you"", it was busy but there was no wait, perhaps because of the snow or perhaps because it was Easter weekend. The original owner was Carlos' dad who opened a restaurant in Cuba with the same name before coming to the US so while I've never been to Cuba, I suspect the food is very authentic. Service was friendly and efficient. There's a small lounge area in front where you can relax with a drink on a zebra print sofa or you can eat in the dining room that still has a loungey feel to it. I ordered the ropa vieja ($12.75), shredded flank steak in a tomato based sauce with onions and peppers, which came with a side of rice with beans. The meat was tender and flavorful, the portion size large enough that I couldn't finish it. My husband ordered the Taste of Cuba ($15.95), a combination plate with ropa vieja, fried plantains, a croquette, boiled cassava, roasted pork with a garlic dipping sauce, rice and beans and a few other items.

My other friend, who is also a vegetarian, got the taco salad, but she said she was disappointed in it. My third friend, who is not a vegetarian, got the plantain sandwich with double meat.

The big increase in traffic - esp on the weekends - has compromised the food quality. I had the tropical heatwave, which I've had before. The chicken was dry, even though it's swimming in a bowl of hot sauce. The rice was overcooked and the presentation on the plate was uninspired.

Another favorite is the red snapper or mahi mahi. However if you are looking for something spicy go for the slow cooked pork that's in their special menu. I would have given all these places 5 stars.

The drinks are yummy, too. The crowd on a busy evening is really annoying (seem like pre-club goers in shiny shirts) so I'd recommend going on an off-night so you don't have to fight for elbow room at the bar. Even so, once I was trapped all the way behind a huge party of people milling at the bar and the bartender saw me, and motioned for my drink order-AWESOMe. Someone is paying attention here!

I've always been greeted by the owner's mother which makes this place feel like you are walking into someone's home. She is very careful of where to sit you if you are going as a couple.

Come on a Thursday where there is a band and you will feel yourself tapping your feet.  Lunch is low key. The  sandwiches are pretty good. I recommend the cuban sandwich and the sandwich with the steak in between plaintains. Try the fried yucca (which is better than fries) and the tostones.

Don't be thrown by the tacky lounge area in front, because Laguardia is sophisticated food. I had a fantastic mojito and my parents had mango margaritas. Though I'm not usually a mango fan, I tried it and found the flavor wasn't overpowering or syrupy. I could even see myself enjoying one next time I go. We started with a marlin and octopus ceviche, which was quite spicy but tangy and left us savoring every drop. I had flounder with a crab cake stuffing over rice with a saffron cream sauce. It was one of the best meals I've ever had. I also tried everything else at the table. The picadillo was good, as were the plantains and black beans, but the red beans tasted like smoke and I didn't take more than three bites. My parents had the Cuban sampler, which they really liked.

2007-05-06,5.0,"Why hasn't someone written a sitcom about a Cuban restaurant based in Bucktown where everybody knows your face? Go to Cafe LaGuardia once, and you're greeted with smiles that light up like Havana cigars, a regular menu full of excellent stuff and a specials menu with more of that excellent stuff. Together, they are the kind of menus that makes you over-order and over-eat, but there is nothing like mojitos to wash away, happily, all short-term memories of overeating. The next time you go (if you're me, within the month), owner Carlos LaGuardia will hug you, kiss you on the cheek, and tell you you're beautiful. He'll treat you like a special guest, even though he has many other special guests, and if you bring 10 other people like I did the other night, every female friend will too get a kiss on the cheek and told that she is beautilful. And it is all true! And the food... you'll hear people say, ""Cafe Bolero is great for Cuban,"" or ""I like Cafe 28 for Cuban,"" but you'll hear most people say, ""Cafe LaGuardia is my favourite Cuban restaurant in Chicago"" or ""Cafe LaGuardia is one of my top three favourite restaurants in Chicago."" That's because there is just nothing bad that can be ordered there. The appetiser sampler is a great way to start, if you like deep-fry -- fried cassava, fried croquettes, fried plantains, fried pork hock, fried wings (wings?!), and so on. So for something that's a little less like bar food, try the Cuban tamales or empanadas.  For your entree, because it's hard to settle on something, try the Taste of Cuba (share with someone!) for a selection of ropa vieja, roast pork, boiled cassava, plantains, yellow rice, and more. Otherwise, the pork medallions, grilled whole red snapper, Cuban pulled pork and of course, jibaritos, are delicious, too. Personally, flan is always a great dessert, but so are mojitos.  Cuba is one of my top travel destinations, but until I find my way there, I'm glad it's just a 10-minute drive down Damen to Cafe LaGuardia. If those mojitos seem to taste stronger as the night goes on, well... only you know if it's your imagination or sense of sobriety.",0.9988,0.749,0.247,0.004,0.5493333993333993

The zebra lounge/bar area is set up with incredible style and good taste, and an excellent place to get one of the city's best caipirinhas or mojitos while you wait for your table. The menu contains a slew of cuban specialties, each one more tempting than the last, although priced at 10-15 dollars an entree, none are going to break the bank.

The fried plantains served with the dish were a great contrast of sweetness to the rest of the meal, and the presentation was clearly well thought out.
