2015-08-25,1.0,"I hate to say it, but I knew it. I remember coming to this place only once and reading about this place being closed down and I can honestly say, I see now why black people have a hard time supporting black businesses. They are always trying to get OVER on you some how. The added gratuities, paying to get in to a restaurant, expensive priced food/drinks for the bare minimum, minimum food purchases, long waits, rude service, unavailable management, cancelling your reservations, fights etc. This is why it's hard to support. Other races flourish together, while blacks are steadily falling by the way side, because they're either hating on each other, or trying to get over on each other. It really goes deeper than what meets the surface. Coming from someone who is black, and seeing them try and throw the race card in when they were shut down, was no surprise. Black may play a part in certain situations, but it did not play a part in this place nearly ruining river north and you getting over on your fellow blacks. I remember on NY Eve about to stop by around 11:50 and there was fights, ambulance and police. A mess. This restaurant/club would have probably been better placed next to the Factory. But this is what happens when God don't like ugly and everything catches up to you eventually. I called it back in November that they'd better get a new management team along with a bunch others. Stop blaming 'others' and look at your own establishment, guests, and behavior. It ran in to the ground, because of the owner. Hopefully next time around you come in with pure intentions and a better attitude, team and plan.",0.2235,0.731,0.131,0.138,0.4505833848690992

There only a few people there but you could tell that the set up was for a lot people to enjoy food, drinks, and some dancing!  They had 3 bar areas and plenty of screens with a variety of sizes to watch games. Our server came over to us and had this little country accent that just moved us. Had to ask where she was from down south? She said, I'm not from the South, I'm from Chicago...WHAT! Yes, she said Chicago! She went on to explain that she does attend school down south and that is where she picked up the Southern accent! She was such a delight. Had all the Southern charm and hospitality that usually come along with it. We ordered drinks...my wife loved hers but I didn't care for mines. It seemed weak and watery! The server was so kind to offer me another drink and I was pleased with it! I ordered the Shrimp and Grits and the wife had the fried catfish! Grits were tasty but not filling, so...I had to order some pork chops as well. They were cooked just right! They were out of greens so I had the broccoli instead and they nice and buttery! Gumbo on the side was had a thicker rue then most but was still a delicious style of gumbo...enjoyed the different texture! Catfish was very hot and crispy on the outside while juices flowed ever so slightly from within! Mac and cheese was OK but had better. Corn bread was filled with small kernels and very sweet...with butter it just set it off! Unfortunately, when we just attempted to go here again...the place had closed down!

2015-04-20,4.0,"Admittedly, this review is based on a visit of nearly one year ago but given its currency in local news, I was reminded I never reviewed it. The venue has repeatedly been among the city's ""hot spots"" and not always favorably so. This is tragic for several reasons but the most pertinent one for this space obviously centers on its entertainment value.  Last summer, I accepted an invitation from a group of ""House Heads"" (those folks affectionately known by their devotion to the music and culture of Chicago's famed original Warehouse) to attend an after party of sorts following a Frankie Knuckles tribute (boy, did the local media underreport a tremendous Chicago event that brought together so many diverse thousands in celebration!). I had heard of the Nouveau Tavern and decided to continue the festivities. Very nice venue! Well-appointed, plenty of seating for tableside service, adequate dance floor accented with a cool, raised runway in the middle of the floor and an amazing sound system (more on this in a moment). Mixed and pleasant patronage. There were plenty of friendly, attentive and well-spoken staff on hand that evening. While the food and bevs were a bit pricey and portions on the smallish side, I am familiar with the area's venues and was not put off by this. The food was quickly delivered and tasty. The drink menu, as presented, left a little to be desired but I found the bar tending adequate with requests. My group stayed about 2.5 hours and left feeling confident that we both return and recommend. Admittedly, I was aware the Nouveau Tavern had already been targeted by the City over concerns for proper liquor licensing. In fact, I asked the evening's hostess if the matter had been resolved. However, I did make a mental note of the incredible sound system. A member of my group is a former impresario and he was blown away by its quality. I remember thinking along the lines of that exceptional audio being comparable to systems I've heard in much larger spaces. Fast forward several months and the Nouveau Tavern is experiencing other problems including racist graffiti, alleged complaints from neighbors over noise and patronage, more problems with the City ... Very unfortunate. Perhaps it is obvious and simple to believe that much, if not most, of the problems rest in discrimination. As the only (?) Black-owned entertainment venue in that tony, insular locale, it is not hard to believe that Chicago's ugly and unique legacy of injustice could - and, would - enter stage left. Yet, having not directly experienced anything but a pleasant couple of hours last summer (including that incredible sound system), I cannot personally speak with total confidence of the veracity of the claims. I only wish the venue had a real chance to thrive. Somewhere. When I think of all the places my travels have so far taken me and I compare Chicago, by all means a world-class city, I am saddened. There is no underrepresentation of quality entertainment venues here but a severely persistent low tolerance it appears for those that cater to people of color. This glaring fact is all the more apparent with geo-mapping. For all of its rooted ugliness, Chicago cannot even claim the documented ""northern trek"" of ""hipsters"" during the historic Harlem Renaissance, let alone a free, bi-directional migration. Just tragic. I wish Nouveau Tavern the best. Somewhere.",0.9925,0.728,0.172,0.1,0.4929232804232804
2015-04-19,2.0,"I'm sure this place will be closed soon.  They should have focused on being a legit restaurant instead of a club pretending to be a restaurant.  I came here on a Sunday around 4:45, and was told that I couldn't be seated.  People were still finishing their brunch at tables, but because they were ""transitioning"" to dinner, I had to sit at the bar.  That's pretty stupid, considering that there were at least 10 employees milling around who could have let us sit down. The wings are good, but a New Orleans inspired restaurant should have more than just good wings.  Once again, I am letdown by a black owned establishment that I tried to support.  And I'm annoyed that they have consistently used the race card to garner support.  The next time the owner opens a business, I hope he focuses on service.  I also hope that his books were more organized than his restaurant, because trust and believe...the Feds are always watching when we open businesses.  Peace out Nouveau Tavern.",0.989,0.73,0.229,0.041,0.5197285353535352

2015-03-01,1.0,"First off, I was not expecting much based off of previous reviews, but this place was worst than I could've ever imagine. We went on a Saturday night (2/28/2015) using a Groupon (which was actually a good value). We had to sit at the bar because we had missed our reservations. We tried calling to push the reservation back but the phones were not working that day. Nonetheless, the bar was very comfortable so the lack of tables didn't bother me much.  Drinks/Bar: On first glance, you can tell that this bar is poorly managed. There were several people behind the bar, most of which were not tending the bar...just socializing and passing out hugs to one another.  Meanwhile, the actual bartenders were moving slow because of their limited space.  This is unacceptable in my opinion. Bartenders should be behind the bar. No one else. This slows down the process.  The drinks were tasty but ""overpriced"" is an understatement. Drinks ranged from $12 to $15 which is actually pricey for the area. I live and work downtown so I'm not just making this up. I don't even pay $15 for a martini at the Gallery Bar...and believe me, this aint no Gallery Bar..  Food: I'll make this short because I get frustrated just thinking about it.  We ordered the Bayou wings and  Gumbo for appetizers. The wings were decent but the gumbo...wasn't gumbo. It was more of a tomato paste gravy over rice. If you're familiar with Louisiana dishes, this gumbo would put you in the mind of smothered okra (minus the okra). The crazy part about all of this is the fact that I actually prefer this tomatoes paste dish over real gumbo (that may not be a good thing because I've always hated gumbo). My friend ordered the crawfish etouffee and that was actually pretty good. I ordered the barbecued duck....which tasted like fried pork loin. I'm still trying to figure out how anything fried is considered barbecued. This was totally my fault. I should've known better than to order the Duck. This is not that type of restaurant.... They cant appreciated the greatness of Duck....I shouldve ordered something a little more ""simple"".  We also ordered a side of the sweet potato fries and mac and cheese. The fries were AMAZING!!! ( i'll give credit where credit is due). However, that darn mac and cheese was insulting! I honestly think they ran out of cheese and was trying to whip something together. We waited over an hour for our food and I think that time was spent trying to figure out what mess they could throw on my plate.There's no other explanation for that mussy non flavored mess. There is absolutely  no way they serve this on a regular bases...The server even looked at it with the ""this don't make no damn sense"" look.     Staff: Ok....ill just ask this, have you ever been to a club where the servers are too busy trying to look cute and important then to actually serve? This includes women and men. There was one bartender that was actually BLOWING BUBBLES with his gum as he was fixing drinks. I couldn't believe it...I felt like I was on a hidden camera. And then there was this hostess that must be in charge of bottle service. I was not buying a table that night but like I said, the bar area was the workers ""kick it"" spot so we (that were seated at the bar) saw and heard everything.  The bottle service hostess had to be put in her place by a customer because she was literally talking as if she owned the damn club. She was super rude. I was embarrassed for her. No service skills at all.  I must mention that my server/bartender was super nice. We set at the bar so he was always attentive to us. Unfortunately,  he also had to attend to the half dozen guest that came to the bar complaining about late and missing food and the lack of server visibility. We were actually going to have another drink once the music came on but our bartender had to move to the back bar so we decided to leave. He was the only reason we had stayed around thus far.  I must admit, I really wanted to like this place...but there is nothing to like (other than those sweet potatoes fries:)",0.9916,0.768,0.14,0.093,0.48594719587870283
2015-02-23,1.0,"I do my reviews by categories... We really should of listened to the other reviews, but we really wanted to give them a chance. Well, shame on us. Service: This is the ABSOLUTE downfall for this place. Based on the other reviews, it looks as terrible service is consistent. I'm one to try to be patient with servers. I understand that sometimes nights get busy and you're overwhelmed, but this was completely inexcusable. We were his only table. Our server tried at the beginning, he really did. He went out his way to bring us waters from the bar...even though we had a fresh water carafe on the table (strange). He recommended some dishes, was very polite, etc. but as the night continued on, we saw less and less of him until eventually he completely disappeared. He vanished somewhere between the very long point of when we got our appetizers and when we got our meal (I think a bus boy brought out our food). After we finished our meal we kept watching to see if we could find him. He was nowhere in the dining area.  I'm not sure if he got fired? He quit? He fell ill in the kitchen and was taken away by ambulance through the back door? We just wanted to ask for the check and box to take my leftover catfish home. He was still missing. Forty minutes (yes, forty) of not seeing him or having anyone else stop by our table to help AFTER we were done eating, we were fed up. At this point it started to be converted into the club, the loud music started blaring, and the bouncers appeared. We knew this was our cue to leave. Now, I have never left a restaurant prematurely in all my years of dining. So as an honest guest, with what I had with me in my purse, I pulled out a clean napkin, wrote our Groupon voucher number on there (which covered the whole meal), left him a tip (even though it was NOT deserved) and we left the place (and my leftovers :[ ). Everyone was very friendly, but the service and dining experience absolutely sucks. I guess the way they categorize their menu as ""Acts"" (Act 1, Act 2, etc.) is appropriate. With the vanishing act our server did, he was a modern day Houdini. Food: With the Groupon, you receive: 1 appetizer, 2 drinks, 2 entrees.  Appetizer-  We wanted the Bayou wings but we were told they were ""out"", so we ordered the spinach, artichoke, and crab dip. It wasn't really what I expected.  Three little toasted bread slices came out, pre-spread with the dip on there. Although it tasted decent (maybe because we were incredibly hungry), there was only a little bit of crab sprinkled on top. Entrees- I ordered the fried catfish with red beans and rice. The catfish was okay. Nothing to rave about. The red beans were good. My boyfriend ordered the Chicago pork chops with collard greens and mac n cheese. The pork chops were very, very small. Collard greens were good, the mac n cheese was not very...cheesy and kind of dry. Overall, this wasn't the cajun/creole comfort food we expected. It's more of boutique-style food with boutique-style portions and a cajun/creole flare, nothing more. I'm glad we got the Groupon since the regular pricing for the meals were way overpriced for what was actually served. Drinks: We both got the Magnolia Rose. At this point in, we already hit up a couple bars before hand and were feeling it. However, this drink was still SO strong that it was painful going down. Serious lack of fruit juices here. If you're even the manliest of men, it's totally acceptable to order this drink for yourself. Atmosphere: It was nice, clean, and modern. All guests were dressed nicely, but it didn't have a stuffy feel to it. No complaints here. Overall: Bottom-line, we will NOT be back. We were so excited to drive out to the city for the night to try this place but the disappearing server, small portions, and mediocre food were such a buzzkill. If I want my Cajun/creole fix, I'll continue to dine at Pappadeaux in Westmont. Good luck, NT.",0.9777,0.821,0.106,0.074,0.48911757911757914

2015-02-18,2.0,"I went there last night to use a Groupon. I was surprised I was able to make a reservation given that it was Fat Tuesday and I assumed the place would be packed. However, when I arrived there were only 8 tables there.  The service was mediocre at best. It took about 10 minutes to get menus and about another 10 to get our drinks once we placed the drink order.  Food was all OK. Nothing special. The crawfish fritters were overly battered and my guests and I were splitting them but the server didn't offer us small plates so we could easily share. Drinks are OK but way overpriced.  When they dropped off the bill at the end of the night, they had already added a 20% gratuity based on the price of the items we ordered, not on the cost of the groupon or the stated value of the groupon.  The server didn't even mention the tip had been added or how it had been calculated when he dropped it off. Also, at the bottom of the charge slip it also stated what a 15%, 18% and 20% tip would be based on the total amount of the additional drinks we ordered plus the 20% tip they had already factored in.  To be clear, I have no issue tipping based on the value of the food. The server should not be penalized for discounted food via a Groupon offer. However, in my view it's a bit tricky to not say anything about a built in 20% tip or how it was calculated when dropping off the check; to assume a 20% gratuity for a party of 2; and to list an additional suggested gratuity at the bottom of the bill - All rubbed me the wrong way.

The set up is really nice the lightening was perfect. They actually had a singer that night she was great. It took a while for our waitress to come. As we were waiting we were looking over the menu. We decided the shrimp and crawfish hushpuppies as an appetizer. We decided on the blacken catfish over rice and chicken sausage dish. I was really excited to try the dish and as an dessert it was a banana dish ( don't really remember). Lets just say soon as the entree came it looked great but when I took a taste it was really salty.I'm thinking it was something in the sauce. On a happier note My husband enjoyed his dish. Our waitress disappeared it took a length of time for her to come check on us. We asked for the dessert to be bagged along with my dish I figured my husband would eat it. Oh I forgot to mention that a bottle of champagne came with the package which was horrible and a dead looking rose. Overall I do not feel like a deposit should've been put down nor was everything worth $125.

The positives are that it is free admission during most events that I have attended. It's a very lively place with a big crowd of people after 10pm. So if you are a people watcher then this is the place for you! The music is R&B and some old school. Its loud and noisy so you wont be able to hold a conversation! This is a club type environment at night.  If you have dinner or lunch there then you will learn that the prices are sky high, ridiculous, and just plain ole insane. Drinks are expensive and weak! The portions of food are small and the food is definitely not worth the price!  One dinner can cost you on average 25 bucks or more. The wait staff is terrible and inattentive. They try to charge you extra for everything. They are rude and pushy!  One time, I ordered an appetizer of Nachos, and when they bought it to the table I wanted to hit the waitress with the plate. There were literally 8 chips on the plate that were broken and scantly adorned with tiny sprinkles of cheese, peppers, etc. I couldn't believe that they had the nerve to serve me that mess for 9 bucks. I grab the waitress and told her to get it made the right way or I didn't want it. I don't eat little scraps of chips.  If you eat here, then pay attention to your receipts!!!!!

I truly want to support black owned businesses especially in Chicago especially because I come with an extensive background in fine dining in my city but I will never set foot in Nouveau Tavern again. Its unfortunate because the food was very good. But everything from the service to the overall cleanliness of the dishware was absolutely a disgrace at brunch today. I have never been so uncomfortable attempting to be as nice as possible to my waitress who was not only rude throught my visit but dismissive and downright confrontational. Plates left on the table,  she dipped for about 20min. Ordered an Abita IPA she brings me Laguinitas IPA like its the same thing with no explaination no glass. There were dirty ramakins on the buffet no butter. No plates and this was all buffet style for $24.95 a plate. I wasn't even paying but was embarassed to meet my girl there from out of town for brunch after not seeing her for several months. Catty colorstruck fiasco of nonsense wrapped up in a bourgeois atmosphere not worth a dime unless you want massive attitude with your crablegs. I suggest they take care of the front of the house to match the great food coming out of the kitchen because this is the worst dining experience I've ever had. And there was so much more wrong but I'm tired of writing. A shout out to the chef that should take his talents elsewhere before they ruin his reputation.

The first time I visited was for dinner, which was expensive but tasty. No complaints. The second time I visited was about a week ago for brunch. I walked in confused and I didn't know if I was supposed to seat myself or wait to be seated because there was no hostess. A few minutes later, she came to seat us. After we were seated, I became confused again because I was given no instructions of how brunch at Nouveau works. About 10 minutes later, just as we were getting ready to get up and help ourselves to the buffet, our waitress shows up (after walking past us several times) to take payment and give us wristbands. Finally, we're able to eat! The food was phenomenal! Whoever is doing all of the cooking definitely knows what they are doing. However, the efficiency of each station was lacking. While I like the concept of everyone being able to fill small bowls with ingredients they'd like in their omelets, it takes way too much time. Then, we have to wait for more bowls when they run out. I suggest having customers tell the cook what they want and let him add them to the eggs. It would be a lot faster. Also, please post signs to inform people of the correct direction to travel in the buffet line because it was a mess with everyone coming from and standing in every way. Lastly, I don't know if it's because of high rent in the River North area but why doesn't this place have unlimited mimosas? If the price is going to be nearly $30 per person (w/ tax), I think it should be a given.

She said that you get it back on a gift card that you can spend on anything they sell. That's extortion, it's ridiculous and it's strike one. Strike two is when I told her that I was on a list for a party, she had a guy come over to check a list and then said that my friend had not arrived yet so we had to wait for her since she ordered bottle service or we had to pay to go in. Strike three would be when I found out they had a mandatory coat check, which is not a big deal because I was going to check it anyway but I don't like being told I have to do something as a customer who is volunteering to put my hard earned dollars in your pocket.

I notified my server, who was very busy and told him about my problem,  asking  if their was a ""mircowave"" for warming.  He told me that the restaurant had NO microwave, a restaurant with NO microwave???.  At that time I told him I will NOT be paying for my meal.  He came back and told me after CONFERRING  with the CHEF, that their was steam coming from the ""stream tables.""

I've sworn this place off after my last visit for a friend's party.  First off when you arrive after 11 the entrance fee is 25 dollars but with that fee they give you a 25 dollar gift card that's good for food or drinks. I thought that was pretty fair and was fine but when you get into the club the drinks are about 16 dollars for the smallest glass and they automatically take 3-4 dollars for gratuity so the card is only good for 1 lousy drink that's watered down IF you can get a waitress that will serve you (F.Y.I women only go to male servers,  the female servers will have you wait forever for no reason) after this, issue the club is normally fine, music is good,  but when leaving the security gets really hostile. I came pretty late and ended up finding a really great park on the same street as the club....or at least I thought it was great. When leaving they make all customers go out and to the left like cattle,  and I proceeded to go right to my car and was cut off and told that I had to go around the block; that would have been fine if I wasn't in heels, cold, or a female that's out at 2am trying to make it home safely.  I had no pre - warning that if I parked on the same block I would be forced to walk 15 to 20 minutes out of my way around the block.  I even suggested that a security guard walk me to my car that was literally 10 steps away from the front door, they refused, it got to the point were I was  so upset that I got into an argument with a security guard and he told me F. me and he hopes I never come back to that club (his wish was granted),  after he said that I didn't care and put the alarm on my car so that I could get to it. They Are so concerned with keeping the residents in that area happy (which they should) they neglect to treat their paying customers fairly.  I spent at least 50 dollars that night and was treated like an animal and called out of my name.  After setting my alarm off a few times on purpose to get the security to let me walk he finally did and although I'm not proud of my actions I am happy I made it out if that situation safely and have since vowed to never return.

I'm not into sweet cocktails so it wasn't my favorite, and I ordered it for the promise of grapefruit juice, which I didn't taste at all. My companion ordered the Sazerac, which he was very excited about, because according to him, it's one of the oldest cocktails and he's been looking for it in Chicago for a while.

What happened to the ""rinse?""  For our appetizer, we tried the gumbo, which was really flavorful. The huge bowl they gave us for our shrimp shells was pretty comical because there was only one shrimp in the gumbo. I still used it for that one shell though. It looked pretty sad in there all by itself. His entree was the pork chop and he had no problem finishing off the pork, saying that it was well-seasoned with cajun spices. I tried his mac n cheese, and it was delicious. I chose the chicken jambalaya and it was pretty good- nice and spicy and full of meat.

2014-10-01,2.0,I was excited that they had a groupon available. I had been wanting to try them out and this gave me an excuse. The food was ok at best. I had higher expectations to tell the truth especially based on their pricing. I happen to love Cajun food. Their Bayou Wings weren't much different than going to a buffalo wild wings. I loved my cocktail the blues and the beads but it's presentation in simply a tall cocktail glass took away from its tastiness.  I was prepared to top our server upwards of 30% and we purposely ordered more than what came with the Groupon so that I could have an amount to charge and tip on. Imagine my surprise when my bill came with 20% gratuity added for a 2 person table. I asked the server about this and she said it was only for groupon tables but not to worry because we were not charged tax in place of gratuity. Too bad because that 20% is all she received. I understand gratuity for large parties and expect it but I think it's ridiculous for a couple to pay gratuity just because they use a groupon.,0.9312,0.807,0.145,0.047,0.575132275132275

2014-08-14,1.0,"I have visited this place 3-4 times since January 2014 and I hold off on a review every time because I want to believe that the service will improve. I want to believe that they are just working out the kinks. But nothing has changed, i would even say that things have gotten worse. Last Saturday took the cake for me personally!!! My boyfriends best friend and wife came in from Cincinnati for the weekend and we wanted to show them a good time. One of the many places we wanted to go was here. why not patron a black business right? We are all educated hard working employed black people down for the cause. Until we were stopped at the door and told that there wasn't a cover but there was a 25 dollar drink minimum for ladies and 45 for men. This is a complete misuse of the term no cover but cool we still say we will go because realistically that's not much money at all especially seeing all drinks here are 15 and up. And we just spent 400 dollars at gilt bar a few blocks a way. We really did come out to have a good time. But when the lady running the door told all of us adults (other business owners, department heads of GE etc.)  that we had to prepay at the door for the drink minimum I damn near exploded. I see that as a complete disrespect! I don't go to white palace grill for this reason! No one will make me prepay for a service as simple as a drink. What if I have a complaint what if I'm mistreated? That was a complete spit in my face. Ive been to some of the trendiest bars in the us and no one has ever asked me to prepay for a drink. I've been to Liv on Sunday... nobody made me prepay for a drink, Violet rose in wicker park... didn't have to prepay, Untitled down town didn't prepay and these are all places with experienced serious mixologist. Teddy u blew this one. Your staff needs to learn humility and how to keep a customer. I've never been so disappointed in a black business (or any business) in my life. You need to get a customer service specialist in here ASAP because you only seem to cater to the just turned 21 crowd who would foolishly throw their money away on a Thursday for an overpriced bottle or the "" I'm trying recreate a music video crowd"" us normal regular people who just wanna have a good time get crappy service, late bland food and a damn pyramid scheme at the door .Again...I have been biting my tongue for the last 8 months so I don't want you to think this is based off of one bad experience. It's just really disappointing that your one year anniversary is around the corner and I have yet to see any improvements. If all you want to do is bamboozle people out of money and make a profit...continue going this route. But if you want to be a staple in the community, a Chicago legend for years to come, a world wide tourist attraction that happens to be a black owner...then I hope you will take this constructive criticism and grow from it.",-0.9849,0.829,0.063,0.108,0.46505948831530225
2014-08-06,3.0,"My friends and I are regulars on Thursdays when it turns into a club. Always a good time with great music! I've tried the food a couple of times, it's OK. I would give the place 4-5 stars based on the nightlife alone, however recently my friend had a horrible experience with parking. She parked her car in front of nouveau on a city meter, paid the meter, and went inside to enjoy the club. When she left a little past midnight to go to her car the bouncers/security would NOT let her walk to her car that was literally a few feet away from the door. They said it was some new rule that she would have to walk AROUND the block (I.e through a dark alley) by HERSELF even though her car was parked on a city street. I was FURIOUS when i learned what happened to her. Way to go guys making your customers walk through unsafe streets when their car is parked in front of your place.

2014-08-04,3.0,"This place is alright in my book.  I suggest it to friends for a night out.  I have not eaten here so I can not speak to that but I have come here on a Friday and Saturday Night. Service: Do not expect a smile and just know what you want.  I have not gotten that friendly server or bartender vibe when here.  Its get what you want and then move on. Ambiance: Sexy, young adult kind of place. The lighting is fun with a bluish purple tint.  The booths are comfy if you can get a seat.  They have high top tables that you want to snag if you are coming for a night out without bottle service.  Around 1030pm/11pm they remove the chairs from the bar so you can not sit there.  All booth seating is for bottle service until the very end of the night when they usually give up on sectioning it off just for that. Price: Up there.  About $10 for a mixed drink, probably $7 for a beer.  They dont charge a cover so they charge a drink minimum of $25 for ladies and $49 for men.  If you get there before 11pm there is a good chance you will miss this nonsense.  This is one of the reasons they get two less stars.  They advertise as free every night but then charge a drink minimum.  No thank you.  Bottles start around $200 I think.  Its worth it if you have a large group. Food: I heard its good but pricey.  I have never eaten here This place is black owned so I like to support.  The DJ is usually pretty good.  The vibe is also a lot of fun with your group of friends.  People will get up and dance.  If you want a fun night out this is the place.  Just expect to not sit unless you have bottle service or get there before 1030pm and to pay a pretty penny for your drinks.",0.9956,0.753,0.202,0.045,0.46952380952380945

2014-07-05,5.0,"I visited on a Saturday night around 11:00 pm. The bouncer didn't needlessly hold the line and answered all my questions before I entered. I like the idea of no cover but a mandatory $25 gift card purchase; I'm spending at least that much on food and drinks anyway. Some people complain about this, but if you didn't come to spend money, why are you there? The bartenders and wait staff were extremely attentive. Every dish we ordered from the late night bar menu was delish and the drinks were strong. The DJ played the right blend of current and throwback hip hop and reggae that kept everyone dancing all night and the lighting gave the restaurant a chic, upscale nightclub vibe.

Our server Brandon was nice but seemed a bit nervous and over anxious. My friend had the crawfish étouffée and I had the banana French toast, grits with turkey sausage and scrambled eggs. Her dish was good. As a person who grew up on the gulf coast I was definitely watching how things were being prepared.  The French toast wasn't too bad. Not as moist as I like it but edible. The grits were really buttery. I'm guessing that's how they are boiled down but it was a lot. I was not offered salt or pepper for them either. Another part that made me double take was the turkey sausage. As a person that really doesn't eat a lot of meat I was shocked at how bad this was. It was flavorless, dry and tasted like it came out of a box. I hope this is not an everyday occurrence. They did take it off the bill only after us asking after we expressed our displeasure. Lastly I ordered orange juice and it was brought to me with ice cubes in it. What?? Who does that? The doors are kind Of weird too. They are all white and it's hard to tell if you are going in the correct place. Not very inviting. All in all the place itself is ok.

Even had a special that if you order an entree it came with a glass of wine for a penny. Nice. (Had the burger and fries...just okay)  This review is more so for the night time experience cause thats generally when I would go. This is one of the few places that is comfortable with charging women ridiculous prices to get in. They tried charging one of my girlfriends $25. Then told her she would receive a $25 gift card. However they then said she had to wait till next time to use it and she would have to pay $25 again to enter the club (but then she would get another $25 gift card to use at a later date.)

2014-05-27,2.0,"My rating is based off the service and attitudes I dealt with when I went to Nouveau this past Saturday. I really wanted to give Nouveau the benefit of the doubt being that it is a relatively new, black owned business. I couldn't.  Initially everything was fine; we left with no major issues. Less than 5 mins later, I returned to the restaurant realizing I had left my phone on our table. Let me tell you, I have never interacted with more abrasive, unhelpful people in my life. I first asked the hostess if she or anyone else had seen a phone anywhere. She gave me a combination of the stank eye + blank stare and quickly said ""no"". Didn't bother to check with anyone.... just ""no"". I told her that according to the Find My Phone app, it's still at the restaurant, at which point she then became visibly annoyed, opened a drawer, shifted a few things around and said ""no phone"". OK. I decided to go look for the phone myself at our table...didn't find it. Went to the bathroom, same thing (but if there's anyone who cared enough to help me look or even ask around, it was the bathroom attendant.) Came back out to the seating area and talked to our waitress to see if she had maybe picked it up or if she could check if any of the people who cleared the table had found it. She looks at me and says ""I have an iPhone...we all have iPhones here miss...nobody wants to take yours"". Girl, bye. I was so frustrated & I had friends waiting on me, I decided to leave and check the next day. Fast forward to Sunday evening... asked a bartender if she's found a phone. She didn't, but proceeded to ask an older woman (manager?) sitting at the bar if she had. This woman literally looked me up and down and told the bartender no. And that was it. No one asked what type of phone, where I left it, my contact info.... nothing. Even as I explained that I know for a fact it was left here (thanks Find My Phone!) no one even tried to help. I understand it's my mistake/responsibility, but if an employee of Nouveau maybe took the phone... i'd feel a little at ease to know that the restaurant management at least tried to ask around. There were fellow patrons of the restaurant that did more to help with the phone search than employees and management. On a separate note, my 2-star rating also reflects the food/drinks in this place: ""Meh. I've experienced better."" Entrees are ridiculously over priced so we decided to order 5 different appetizers (I came with a largish party). Took way to long to come out, portions were tiny, and were generally disappointing, with the exception of the potato wedges given to a friend who has dietary restrictions. But then again...it's potatoes, kind of hard to screw up. It's not inedible food but for the price and the overall vibe of the place (faux upscale) I expected way way better. Did I mention the drinks were severely watered down? I mean like a margarita with 1 part alcohol 10 parts lime juice + water. Outrageous. Overall, this weekend was my first and last experience there. Good looking place and good looking staff, nasty food and nasty attitudes. Also, NBA playoffs while Destiny's Child blasts in the background? Fix it, Jesus. I wish I saved my time, money, and heartache wasted at this place and just went to Popeye's or something. At least I know I would've enjoyed my food better. Side note: Find bouncers/security or whatever they are, that won't try to hit on the customers. As if my night there wasn't bad enough, having an older, heavyset man all up in my ear talking about ""damn girl how you doing"" truly truly didn't help.",0.9577,0.811,0.106,0.082,0.39528819945486615

I see the reason for $45 at the door , it keeps the broke as* trouble ghetto people out from the spot. But drinks are high priced. Bartender seems like he's confused on what he's doing , takes forever for to get a drink , and drinks are lame, so make sure what ever u ordering "" order on the rock "" if u wanna taste the alcohol. I didn't try the food , so can't really comment on that area, but I'll tell you this, this place strictly for African Americans. There's plenty of girls in the club, this place is not a lounge,  it's more like a dance club without a proper dance floor . Would I go back again ? No, due to the fact paying $45 bucks at the door and high priced drinks.",0.8368,0.89,0.076,0.034,0.43911616161616157
2014-05-11,1.0,"I really tried to give them a chance again, I did. I came here for a friend's birthday (tonight). The problem this time was the bouncer with the dusty a** cornrows (DAC). D. Rose and his peoples were coming so they blocked off the VIP area with stanchions. No problem, but then thy kept extending it out more and more. Then the DAC bouncer touched me and told me that I couldn't stand in front of the stanchions. I'm sorry what? What is the point of having stanchions if I can't stand in front of them. So I asked him just that and he told me that he wasn't going to argue with me on this. Argue? I asked a simple question. Then D. Rose arrived and someone who worked there was trying to bring something into the section (at this time I was in the spot where it was safe). You would think that simply opening the rope would suffice. No, the DAC bouncer literally pushed me out of way. One guy who was with me was upset with what happened because this was the second time the DAC bouncer put his hands on me. That ended the night because we all left after that.

2014-05-05,4.0,"I was in town for work and my BF met me so that we can enjoy a long wknd in the city we always talked about visiting. I heard about Nouveau Tavern when inquiring with the bellhop at our hotel.  Initially we were looking for a cool spot to watch the Mayweather fight but unfortunately we didn't make it over there for Sat. night. The one thing that stuck out to us when reading the other reviews is that is a black owned establishment, this alone made us want to try it out while visiting from NYC. So we decided to head over for brunch on Sun. It was a little early, therefore it wasn't any other patrons there yet, which was ok.... We were pleasantly greeted by the chef while the hostess was handling something else at the moment. The chef was very inviting and answered all our questions of curiosity regarding Nouveau and Chicago. She also was very accommodating of a special request that I had, which was very nice!! The venue is nice and spacious, we regretted not going to watch the fight there with all the TVs there isn't a bad viewing area.  On to the food, we shared an app of the seafood gumbo, which was very tasty but could have been a little hotter (temp. wise). I had the shrimps & grits along with a side of collard greens..very good! My BF had the French toast and sausage which also was good. The cocktails were delicious as well. Overall, I thought the experience and food was good, so not sure about all the negative reviews. Note that this is coming from someone who has traveled the world AND dine as well as hung out all over NYC. The only one thing, I can say that isn't so great, is that we were looking forward to going back later that evening because the waitress mentioned they hosted a comedy show on Sun. night (....and I know that a lot of great comedians have come out of Chicago) which I was excited about. We came back about 9ish and the place was empty.:-/ we would definitely stop in the next time we are in Chicago.

Each one was ahhhhh-mazing! I had the French toast for my main dish and the syrup was like no other.  There were six people in my party, yet we were seated promptly for an Easter Sunday. Our server was very kind and provided great recommendations for us.

2014-04-17,1.0,"Another Chicago black-owned establishment disappoints... AGAIN!!  THIS PLACE HAS NO SOUL!! I highly anticipated this restaurant and had very high expectations as well. Primarily in support of what I read about the Tavern being shut, down due to racism. But sad to say, I was let down. I came in around 5:30 p.m. for after-work happy hour. I took a seat at the bar. The decor was absolutely amazing! Hands down, THE BEST looking restaurant I might have EVER been to. I would put this restaurant up against ANY establishment in the country and It'd probably blow them away by a distance! The bar staff was great. They were very personable, attentive, helpful and kind. Unfortunately, the hostess and host were a completely different story. As I left twice to feed the parking meter, the host/hostess not knowing whether I was leaving for good or returning, NEVER once said ""thank you for coming"" or ""have a great evening sir."" Finally, when I did leave for good, I got nothing. Not what one would expect when paying River North prices. Poor customer service AT THE DOOR! My biggest complaint was the music. Because I'm from Detroit, we take music very seriously. More so than the average American city. And the playlist at Nouveau Tavern was absolutely pathetic! They need to seriously step up their music game! I've been to hotel bars that have a more soulful playlist than Nouveau Tavern. I've been to Irish pubs on the Northside that play more soulful music. And I'm dead serious! The live music was below grade as well. We as black people all know, music sets the mood for ANY black-owned restaurant/bar. I seriously don't believe the owners have put any thought into developing a soulful musical playlist that sets the mood for this place. LET ME REPEAT: THE OWNERS HAVE NOT PUT ANY THOUGHT INTO A SOULFUL MUSICAL PLAY LIST. And to make a long story short, the HORRIBLE music was THE reason I left. The place had no vibe. No flow. NO SOUL!! As rare as it is to have a black owned restaurant/club Downtown Chicago, THIS ESTABLISHMENT HAD NO SOUL!! None at all!! Music sucked! No classic R&B, Soul, House music, Neo-Soul or Contemporary Jazz.. No Lauren Hill, Kem, Damian Marley, George Duke, Boney James, Anthony Hamilton, Ledisi, Jaheim, Raphael Saadiq, Jill Scott, Dwele, Raheem DeVaughn, Bilal etc... And being from Detroit, that STILL... isn't good enough! You gotta know how to mix that ""ish!"" You gotta bring it! Chicago is a BIG CITY!! You gotta impress!! You can't just open the doors and expect people to fall in and be happy just because it's black-owned. You have to earn the money! Now if you travel to Atlanta, NOLA, Toronto, Detroit, Miami, LA, D.C., New York, Baltimore...you know you're going to hear great music in a black-owned establishment. Why doesn't Chicago get it? I was hoping I found a place to chill, take out of town guest, but after falling asleep at the bar listening to ""Purple Rain"" by Prince and Katy Perry, I realized I still hadn't found that place in the Loop. If the owners would just take a little time and pay VERY close attention to detail, this could be an amazing establishment. I was SO disappointed! And one more thing... As a previous comment pointed out, the establishment MUST cater to the older and more mature crowd. We're the ones with the expendable dough and we don't cause problems in the neighborhood. Especially for happy-hour. Please stop asking us to buy bottle service and just make the experience. Not classy. We may not be all nighters but we're professionals who want a place to go DOWNTOWN after work, have dinner and listen to some ""good old soul music."" A place where we can entertain out of towners. After a couple hours of having dinner, drinks and listening to some good R&B music, we're ready to go home and relax. At 10:00 p.m. you can change up for the younger crowd. That's to be expected. Or, If we're feeling ""nice"" after a few drinks then we might decide to stick around a while longer as the clientele changes. The restaurant was completely empty between 5:30 p.m. until 7:30 p.m. when I left. Any other city would have had a packed house during those hours. Why not cater to the mature happy-hour crowd? I hope the owners read the comments on Yelp. But, If they don't, I hope a close friend will sit them down and honestly go through each complaint one by one. If they take interest in the list of critiques and correct their very correctable mistakes, they might have a chance of sticking around for a while. I'll give it another try in a month or so.

2014-04-16,1.0,"Since my post was deleted from their fb page (as well as all others that were not in full 'support' of them), I figured management at NT couldn't censor me on yelp. The decor is absolutely first class. However...the food, service and attitudes of the staff leaves alot to be desired. I've been more than 4 times from when they first opened to January of this year. To say it went downhill fast is an understatement. Are you a restaurant/club/bar? At times all three collide, especially on the weekends. When they first opened to much fanfare the crowd was diverse, food was ok, as well as the presentation of it. Let's fast forward a few months ahead and well....on a good night you may get your food in an hour. When eating dinner, it's disturbing that you have the 'lounge/bar' crowd standing over your table talking and drinking and sometimes dancing. If you're going to club the place out on the weekends, do that....but do not have your patrons that are there for dinner subject to the ratchettness that the place brings on Fridays/Saturdays. For everyone on their FB page saying they will 'support' the establishment from their recent closure and their managments rant on facebook about it being 'genocide' (really?) about the city trying to shut a black-owned business because the residents of River North don't want it there. If I'm not mistaken, those same residents frequented the place when you first opened and not until the weekend crowds started changing did the complaints come in. I think it's appalling that they would pull the race card out when they KNOW what the real issues are. Get control of your crowd/clientel on the weekends. The younger crowd that this place attracts are not coming to eat dinner, that's why there has been a cover charge at the door as well as a 'drink card' charge, mandatory coat check. The money has to be made up someway. I hope the PR team at NT gets it together quickly before the warm weather hits.",0.8963,0.886,0.077,0.038,0.4344202898550724

2014-04-16,1.0,"Alright - so it's been a while since I've reviewed anything  but this money pit (hardly a restaurant or even a club) doesn't just deserve my attitude when I was there but a bad review too. I didn't eat so this review is more about the service and management, and not the food.  I should be upfront about this part too; I work primarily with restaurant/bar owners and other business owners in my work as a banker. I've seen it all on the finance/money side of things. It's sad to say that all the money in the world couldn't fix what these guys are doing wrong.   I get that this place is new(6 months+ now). My one star is generous like that.  First problem - Service. Simply put, it should never take more than 10 minutes for any server to swing by and see if I need another drink. From a finance perspective, these guys are making most of their money on drinks. They're not bad, and for the price you are paying for them you would think that the owner would emphasize this particular part of customer service. If a server can't anticipate the needs of their customer's (drinks or other menu items on regular intervals) maybe they should be a hostess instead.I was seated and after 15 min I ordered one drink, and it was 20 min before I was visited again for my food order. I elected not to have ANY food since it seemed to be a too large a problem for them to handle. My date and I had two drinks each and left.  Second problem - Music. I love hip hop and a good sound system but that's not why people are there. People are there to drink, eat and socialize. That being said, there is no need for the music to be as loud as it is, in a place as small as this. I'm not saying anything about the music choices here, only the volume. Far too loud for a place this small. It only takes away from the overall experience of dining here.    Third problem - Management. I asked to speak with the manager twice in 1.5 hours here. The first time being told he was unavailable at this time but he would make an effort to see us before we left. The second time I was told that he had left for the day. I'm not calling our server a liar or even accusing management of trying to avoid a customer issue. I'm sure he get's it all the time with the place being run as it is. Simply put, management is responsible for setting expectations and following thru. If management can't set appropriate customer service expectations and meet them (it is your business after-all) then your staff will not either.  My advice to the owners/investors. Take a step back, look at the business from a customer's perspective and address the (based on yelp reviews) consistent problems your customers have brought up. It's slowing you down and costing you revenue. We are all customer's elsewhere. It's easy to forget that when running a business like this.  Save yourselves money in the long run. Do yourselves a favor and hire a consultant and stop losing revenue, because it's literally walking out the door and writing bad reviews on yelp.",-0.9658,0.829,0.068,0.103,0.4493901777235111

2014-04-04,2.0,"This is not just a review. This is my story. You've been warned. It's long.  First, let me begin by saying that I REALLY want to like this place. It honestly brings joy to my heart that this establishment exists. Because of this, I really want this place to succeed and thrive. With my disclaimer out of the way, shall we begin?  As I walk into the restaurant, I am immediately thankful that I am not claustrophobic. Their revolving door has an opaque film from top to bottom of each glass door panel and inner walls of the door which prevents anyone from seeing in front, to the side, or behind them until fully revolving the door into the restaurant. While mysterious and perhaps alluring to some, I just find it a bit disorienting. Some places hang thick curtains or velvet drapes at the entrance to be covert, they chose contact paper, but whatever.  As I proceeded inside, the decor is striking. Slightly upscale, dim lighting drapes over patrons. Sculptural, modern chandeliers hang from the ceiling with long tendrils of elegant rope lighting in blues and purples. The colors reflect off the mirrored accents and metallic surfaces. These, in turn are balanced by the elegant wood tables and fire features dividing several of the booths. It's a gorgeous place. At this point you're probably wondering why I gave this place 2 stars. I'm getting there.  This is my 4th time patronizing Nouveau. My first experience was excellent and warranted me coming back. The chef came out introduced himself and chatted. Service was prompt and attentive. Food was delicious. However, my 2nd, 3rd and final my 4th and now last time were far below what I expected based on the original bar that had been set.  I should say that this 4th time we were in a group. I didn't think this would matter since I was part of a group my first time. Upon sitting down, several of us asked if we could have separate checks and if they could just add our portion of the group gratuity onto our individual checks. We were told no. Strike one. Most restaurants and servers can and will accommodate this request. But, at the time, it was no big deal.  We proceed to order appetizers and drinks. Seemingly simple requests: wings, crab fritters, crustini, the restaurant's specialty cocktails, etc. Nothing complex. 40 damn minutes later, our appetizers arrive. We devoured them like starving pack animals. Now, of course we're not the only customers, but we expected our server to at least check on us more than once or twice. She did not. But, again, whatever. Conversation was good. People were beautiful.  She finally returns to take our entree orders. She hears all our orders and saunters away. Confident that our appetizers will hold us just long enough for our food to arrive, we continue chatting. We continue about 45 minutes until we notice bone dry water carafes, and several cotton-mouthed individuals with empty glasses of adult beverages. After wondering if our server had fallen into some kind of pitfall and forgotten us, a few take matters into their own hands and order their drinks directly from the bar. The server then returns and jokingly gives one of the individuals a hard time for ordering outside of her. Laughs are exchanged and she disappears again only to return another 20 minutes later with forks and spoons for our various entrees for which she explains is coming out shortly. Shortly turned out to be an additional 45 minutes. Up to this point, it was only cold molasses slow service and poor attentiveness--then the bill arrived. While it is inherently on the host of the group to get the participants in order prior to the gathering (bring cash if possible, make sure you're prepared to pay gratuity and tax), that shouldn't be the patron's only option. Separate checks or patron itemized checks are a common amenity at most other upscale restaurants. And, if Nouveau want to continue to be in the upscale market, they need to act accordingly. That means, upgrade your POS. They can't separate out the checks, so like before whatever, again. Now when the server asked us to write what we ate next to the last digits of our debit or credit card, I thought never had to do that before, but okay. When she further asked US, the patrons, to grab our abacus' and slide rules to comb through the receipt, figure out individual prices for items, figure out the tax, figure out gratuity, I started to lose my patience. I told the server, ""I didn't come to take a math test with my meal. Isn't that what the cash register and you are for?"" She proceeded to get a bit snippy while trying to get me to do her job. FIGURE it out! Had you given us separate checks like we asked, this would never have come up.  Reluctantly, we schlepped the receipt around the table, each person writing down what we had on the back of the receipt with the last 4 digits of our card. What many of us didn't and weren't going to do was try and break down our meal from a 14-inch-long receipt with tiny print. (2B Con't)",0.9945,0.857,0.098,0.045,0.4900117243867243

Creole food, black owned.....I wanted to love it. The decor was beautiful, and so were the people working there. The compliments end there. The food was overpriced, the menu minuscule (as a matter of fact, there wasn't a drink or dessert menu), and I had the worse jambalaya ever imagined!  Zatarain's has a better recipe.  Second (and for damn sure last) visit: I was invited by a friend, last Friday night. I really wanted to see this friend, so I reluctantly rolled through.

I'm a champagne/wine snob and I've never had a glass of sparking Italian wine, served win a wine glass. Bartender, anything bubbly, just put in a flute. After a few glasses of Prosecco and a couple of mystery shots, I was being to feel Club Ratchetta. That is......until.....mid sip. The lights come on and staff said. ""You have to get out right now!"" ""Let's go, get out!"" I asked if I could finish my drink and the bouncer said no, as he pulled the drink from my hand.

You're better off piecing your entrée from the app menu. The bayou wings, sweet potato fries and corn bread were the best items on the menu.  Next, where do they get off charging posh rooftop prices for a cocktail? I'm sorry but $15 for a Long Island is insane. Also, this place needs a clear identity. If you're looking to attract the grown professional crowd with excessive disposable income, turning the restaurant into a club at 10:30 with only VIP seating is a sure way to keep us out.

2014-03-30,3.0,"I've been to Nouveau Tavern twice and this review is a summary of both.  The 1st time was for dinner and the food was outstanding. Those sweet potato fries are the truth and the catfish sliders are really full-sized sandwiches. The service was a little awkward though and I can only assume that was because the place was just getting into its groove. I would've rated it four stars on the food alone but I just couldn't get over how long it took to get a drink.  The 2nd time was last night for the night-club (after 11PM). The crowd was good-looking and chill. I was a little thrown off at the $45 charge for men but it's not a cover per se. It's a gift card that's fully redeemable at the bar and I never spend less than that on a tab so I'm good with it. They should just make it more obvious at the door what the charge is for... My only criticism is it takes too long to get a drink. The bar-tenders are hustling but the crowd is pretty big and it takes about 20 minutes between drinks.

2014-03-26,3.0,"Admittedly, I was a bit apprehensive to visit the restaurant given the Yelp reviews. However, my first experience (several months ago to watch a Bears game) was great. I like the atmosphere, which although it's an open space, the decor makes it warm and inviting.  Our server was nice and attentive, as were other employees. There was an issue with an intoxicated customer that was handled quickly. Of course the may lay was a bit disconcerting, but the employees came to explain what happened and apologized for the disruption. The food: I had the catfish sliders with sweet potato wedges and corn bread. The dish was advertised as an appetizer but it is an entree sized portion. Well worth the $14. It was tasty. Overall, I had a great time, the food was good. The only negative was parking in the area is not great and valet is a little pricey. I returned last month for a weekday event. This is a monthly event, I normally attend, that was recently moved to this venue. Upon arriving, we decided to just pay the $14 valet so we wouldn't have to come back outside to pay a meter. As we entered, we were told there was a $3 mandatory coat check. Excuse me? Why? I'm coming to have dinner at a table, which I assume will have seats...that I can put my coat on. Begrudgingly we paid. So before even sitting down, we have spent $20. Not a huge deal but still mentionable because it became evident that the ""mandatory"" coat check did not apply to everyone. Unacceptable! The servers were nice. However, the busboys were OVERLY attentive. There was someone at my table trying to take plates or napkins every few minutes the ENTIRE NIGHT. We literally told two of them not to come back to the table unless we called for them. It was so bad, that I had to stop talking mid sentence to tell one of them, ""don't touch it, I'm not finished!!"" This was after I'd nicely told him to wait several times before. My friend asked another, if they were short on dishes! Lol Unacceptable!! It was weird.  The next problem was the ""two drink minimum."" Wait what? Where was that in the event's email? *pulls out phone to show waitress the email. The group next to us had to do the same thing. Again not a huge deal (I don't drink anyway) IF it would've been communicated in the invite. My issue is that if I'm coming to an event after work, 9 times out of 10 I'm going to eat dinner which most likely will include some sort of beverage. So why the mandatory drinks? We were originally told that we had to order off a very limited bar menu because they were expecting a large crowd. This was unacceptable because there was nothing I wanted off the menu. The crisis was avoided after being a little persistent with the waitress. We were allowed to order from the full menu. Food: I ordered the gumbo. So disappointing! It just wasn't good...edible, but not good. The seasoning was weird. There are certain staple seasonings (file, old bay) and it didn't seem like their version had either. *sigh Complete waste of money. The cornbread was still tasty, although it's no longer served in the cast iron skillet. I can't comment on the drinks but my friend liked hers.  Our waitress was nice and the waitress we had the first time came over to chat with us. I wish I knew her name. She is hilarious!!  Overall, we felt they were trying everything possible to get extra money out of us. It was unnecessary and changed my opinion of the restaurant. My original review would've been five stars, but the most recent experience lessened that. I was supposed to attend the monthly event a few weeks ago but decided not to go after reflecting on my last experience. Will I return? Possibly, but I hate that this will not be a space I can add to my ""regular, go to"" list.",0.9757,0.782,0.129,0.089,0.4825759055759057

The Hostess and our Waiter was Nice, but it took FOREVER for our food to come out. (Seemed like an hour)So when the food finally made it out, it was not what I expected at all; being that I am someone that has lived in New Orleans twice, the food was not fit to be called ""New Orleans Style"" because it was far from it. The Shrimp and Grits was NOT good at all, too watery and the flavor was bland. (Wishbone is so much better) My friends had the range from the Chicago Pork Chop (Not a New Orleans Style Dish...was a winner for my friend) and the Blackened Catfish ( was a winner for my friend, it was bland to me) but the Chicken Jambalaya was too spicy til you couldn't eat it..the spiciness over powered the dish. The Crawfish Fritters was o.k could have been better( greasy and too much batter)....now the Sweet Skillet cornbread was pretty good. The drinks were very expensive, the Momma Sweet Tea was good, but not worth $14. Now I must admit that their Bread pudding was on point. We were their for my Friends Birthday Celebration (the scheduling for the reservation is a whole scenario in its own). I believe I will be back for the Bread Pudding and Sweet Skillet Corn Bread to support the restaurant, I'm so hoping they get it right because the Atmosphere is AWESOME and it owned by an African American graduate of a HBCU!

I ordered the cornbread stuffed chicken with mac and cheese. When the food came, there was one bite of cornbread in the chicken and the mac and cheese was so cold, the cheese was hard! 3 other people in our party ordered mac and cheese and their dishes were cold too! We told the waitress that our food was cold and she looked like a deer in headlights. She had no idea how to handle this. She asked if we would like her to take it back and have them reheat it. We asked to have a fresh plate. When the second round of mac and cheese came out, the cheese was melted but it was still cold! We gave up on dinner and decided to order warm apple crisp with ice cream. It took 20 minutes to get our dessert and it was cold! I couldn't believe it! We asked to speak to the manager. Our waitress sent over a manager (which we later found out was a hostess manager) who said he would talk to the chef. After waiting 15 minutes, the chef (Oscar) came over to our table and was completely unapologetic. When we complained about the mac and cheese, he told us that we shouldn't have substituted our side dishes! When we complained about dessert, he said he warmed it himself which is clearly not true since the ice cream that came with the apple crisp was still not even beginning to melt! He then handed coupons to 5 out of 8 of us in our dinner party. First of all, why would you give coupons to only part of the group?

So our journey begins with free tickets to a comedy show that is supposed to start promptly at 9p. My lady friend and I who happens to be lady of dark complexion decided  to take up my buddies girl on the free tickets. Step one -arrive by taxi two hours before the show that starts at 9p....keep this in mind. Walk in greeted by hostess with a sneer...like a what are you doing here with a dark complexion woman? Brought to a table that has more wobble to it than a Fisher Price wee wobble people's toys. Ask waitress is she has some coasters to fix wobble in table....waitress brings me knapkins....I'm like ok...let's just move to another table. Choose another table with less wobble to it but still some.....said whatever. Step two - order drinks.....waitress comes over me and my lady friend order drinks....my lady orders a $14 dollar cocktail and my usual beer. Proceeded by blowing the froth of a couple and await the Def comedy ham show to start(wink wink).2 hours and a couple of cigarettes later it's 931-946p. Where is the comedy show? No where to be found.... As people are Piling in and getting way better seats near the stage than my lady friend and I....I'm like hmmmm....she is like hmmmm....and she says to me.... I'm getting the vibe that they don't like you and I.....do you think that it's because of my complexion and yours not matching? She looks around and sees our waitress attending to everyone else but us as our drinks go down to the bottom of the glass. 10 rolls ....90 style r and b playing and typical dance club fair is ripping thru the air..... decided to attend a life depleting session with my lady friend outside. Step3- Here comes the tipping point.....After being in this fine establishment(take very lightly) for about 3 hrs.....spending some money. Come back inside after our little dinner mint and they tell us we need to check our coats at the door for $3 dollars a jacket....I have no cash....ask where nearest cash machine is and the awesome hostess says down the street....I'm like you want me to go down the street pull out cash and walk back just to check me and my lady friends coats? I look at her and she has that fire in her eyes of are you out your pretty little mind but that would come out alot different if she spoke. ...so I said ah we are just gonna pay our tab and go is that alright? Says oh yeah sure...like they are happy to get us out with me being the only light colored person besides the cook in the kitchen from my observation....awaiting our check with baited breath....standing by our table we receive the check....I pay it and just as I'm about to tip my lady friend of dark complexion says let me see that bill....it says we put 10% gratuity for parties of 6 or more automatically on the bill...keep this in mind there are only two of us....just TWO. They applied this too us...my lady of dark complexion grabs the pen and scribbles out my tip and is ready to scream like a scalded dog at someone for not saying anything to us about this....I said we can just go.... I'm not even gonna give them an ounce of my frustration...As we are watching people walk by the ""COAT CHECK ...High fiving the security and not having to check their coats and these weren't just like sport coat they were wearing god damned parkas...As this is occurring I'm finishing the tab...The fire in my lady friend of dark complexion is starting to go nuclear...we walk two are the door and I leave and she releases like a rabid honey badger taking on a family of cobras like she just don't care. ....I await for here outside and can hear her yelling....comes out and she pulls down a heater faster than two shakes of a lambs tail.... hail a taxi and go back to our place of residence.

The lobster bisque was great with a great creamy sherry and very generous with the portions of lobster.  For my meal I had the grilled cheese with homemade fries.  It was huge and the portion of bacon was incredibly generous.  Everyone else in my family enjoyed their food whether it was the jambalaya or etoufee.  I'd recommend it for a good, relatively affordable bite to eat.",0.9917,0.798,0.191,0.011,0.5866277571634716

First off we didn't get a very welcoming vibe when we walked in, the hostess was not very friendly, they old had one table available and it was the one closest to the door, so we ended up taking that since the host did not give any other options. So we sit down it takes 20 mins for our server to get to us and then another 20 mins to get our drinks. We then order our food and we're freezing by now since we're close to the door so we ask our server for another table she talks to the host and ensured us that we would be moved. 30 mins later the food comes out and we're at the same table no one comes to tell us they are unable to move us. The food was mediocre, I had the Louisiana chicken which was tasty. My bf had a grilled cheese which he hated and wanted to order something else but since our sever didn't come back for another 20-25 mins he was unable to. By the time our server did get back we were so upset with the whole experience that they took the drinks and grilled cheese off our check. When we asked for a manager we were told there was none there and they handed us a card to call one. But what we started to notice also that 2 other tables were voicing their complaints as well.

2014-02-24,1.0,"Where do I begin....I recently visited this place for a friend's birthday party. The experience in whole was utterly disastrous and overtly insulting. For starters, I was required to pay a $20 valet fee up front (which wasn't a huge deal although surprising). After arriving inside the hostess had an attitude and was not helpful at all; once I found my friends I ordered a drink that took 20 minutes to receive and tasted nothing like it should have (watered down amaretto sour).  The music was mediocre and dated but tolerable. The issue began when we were asked to get up from our seat so tables can be removed from the floor. Every 3 minutes a group of men were carrying tables through the crowd with bouncers telling us to get out of the way. We were asked to move from several different locations within the establishment several times to make room for these men moving freaking furniture... At that point we decided to leave. The disastrous part of my visit to this establishment occurred when it became time to get my car back from Valet. Do not think that I am exaggerating when I say it took 1 1/2 hours for my car to be returned to me. Not to mention that I was made to stand outside the entire wait unless I wanted to pay to get back in! I was 2 seconds away from calling 911 and reporting my vehicle stolen. While waiting outside some guy (the owner I believe) was granting special favors for his friends) regarding Valet, while the paying customers were treated like trash. The police were called (by someone else for a separate incident concerning valet), the crowd was loud and unruly and the valet staff had no respect nor did they care about the quality of their service.  I strongly discourage anyone from visiting this place. I will NEVER EVER consider coming here again... They were so unprofessional, disrespectful and not deserving to even be open.

2014-02-17,1.0,When I kept receiving texts and emails about this place we decided to check it out. We have reservations for 2 PM and seated at 2:15 PM.  When we entered into the building the ambiance was beautiful. The restaurant was beautiful. What was a bit distracting was all the big-screen TVs and the makeshift dance floor in the middle of the restaurant with tables connected to the side. I'm not sure the restaurant/night club theme is suitable for this type of restaurant.  This was Sunday brunch so they had a very limited brunch menu which consisted of maybe eight different choices. We notice on the menu when you order bottomless mimosas which they advertise they automatically charge you a 20% gratuity onto your bill regardless to size of your party. So two people in our party ordered mimosas the rest of us had water and it took 30+ minutes to receive one appetizer of wings.  After about an hour and a half of waiting our food finally arrived. We were told there was some mixup in the food and so the server apologized. During our phenomenal wait we noticed that the serving staff and the food runners were very inexperienced and didn't know where the sections were or where the tables were but food was just trickling out. The restaurant had about eight or nine tables that were seated so it was not busy by any stretch of imagination.  To pacify us for having to wait for so long the chef cut up about a cup of fruit and distributed it to five people. Our food friendly chain and to my surprise the $24 that we paid for the shrimp and grits was something that you could maybe your house for all of maybe five dollars. The food was reasonably good but the value that you're getting from the food was not up to par.  The server was good when she interacted with us her present our table was very infrequent we had to fly people down to ask for salt-and-pepper. I don't recall even seeing a front of the house manager here we had to sous chefs that came from the back and was walking through the tables on occasion. But I think their time would've been better spent in the kitchen trying to get the food out rather than trying to ask everybody if the food is okay.  Always always think that this was an interesting experience and for whatever the case maybe I think that the owners of the managers are trying to price couch their food and make you pay at least 3 to 4 times more for the value of what you're actually getting. Not to mention they added the 20% gratuity onto the bill and then text the gratuity also.  I can't see myself ever returning back to this restaurant for any reason that I'm subscribed to their mailing and their texting campaign. If you're looking for Cajun food I was just you go a little closer to Michigan Avenue to Heaven on Seven which gives you considerable amount of food for the value.

The guy behind the bar was pretty cool and kept up good conversation with me. We both decided it would be a good idea to go with the Magnolia Rose which includes Ciroc Red Berry Vodka along with St. Germain, Remy VS, grapefruit juice and orange juice. Was pretty good...it was also nice that the ladies that worked there were also willing to allow me to join their conversation @ the bar while I waited for my buddy. Wasn't too busy yet so they had a little time to spare (nothing wrong with that).  My friend showed up and we decided to grab a high 2 seater. Our waiter was really cool and was very knowledgeable about the menu and was able to break every thing down to the smallest detail. He recommended a drink called Mama's Sweet Tea...it was really good and of course sweet. Drinks here run between $13-$15 so bring the wallet.

The salad also included baby field greens, spiced nuts, red onion & raspberry vinegarette...absolutely delicious!

We sat and ordered drinks which came in a quick manner. We all ordered a variety of things and everyone agreed they loved the food. My buddy got the shrimp which were jumbo and flavorful, i got the gumbo and chicken wings which were both excellent, my other buddy and sister got the burger which they said was delicious. We got a few more drinks then around 10ish it turns more into a club atmosphere so they began playing some good hip hop music.  They were very nice and accommodating the entire time we were there and again we dropped in on a Saturday evening, without a reservation. I thought the atmosphere was great, everyone loved the food, and the music was right on point and the drinks are poured nice and strong.

2014-02-03,2.0,"I decided to head here with some friends to watch the Super Bowl.  It was my first time visiting the restaurant/bar/lounge/club (not really sure what they want to call themselves).   Pros: -My wings were perfect. -Swanky ambience.  That's where it stops. Cons: -Unorganized in regards to hosting an ""event"" for the Super Bowl with bottle service.  From what I was overhearing no one was interested in that (myself included) so that idea was scratched. So they scrambled to put tables together as the venue began to fill. -According to my server her section was all over the venue thus affecting her efficiency. I did wait an hour for a beer. -Service was lacking maybe it was do to the above reasoning from our server.  Regardless, no one came to check on us not even the the guy walking around with earbuds, I mean the owner.  At least the bus people kept our table clear. -$7 fries that were really wedges not explained in the menu.  Of course I ate them. -Even though the game was a blow out someone decides it was a great idea to play music instead of the game's audio in the 2nd half.  However the audio came back with 2 minutes left. Oh and instead of hearing the commercials we heard someone's shuffled playlist (OK maybe there was an actual dj...somewhere). -Warm beer. -I like my drinks strong and it's cool they pulled it off. However, can bars stop making fake ginger ale out of Coke and Sprite? -Pretentious. Perhaps not the place for me to watch a game.  I never seen so many body con dresses and pumps to watch a football game....at a bar.  Oh, never mind it was also a lounge and a club.  So, I'd go for the food (not the fries) and leave afterwards.  Can't say I'm in the mood to listen to Billboard's Hip Hop at a close to club volume with a mimosa in tow. With all my cons I can say this place has potential and in reading from some reviews of their neighbors it couldn't hurt to be more inviting.",0.9879,0.837,0.129,0.034,0.49056513409961683

Aside from the fact that they have good food (but very pricey) and a great ambiance (which is the only reason this place attracted newcomers) If you are planning to have any event at this place..... DON'T!!!! I read the prior reviews and against my better judgment, I decided to have my birthday party at Nouveau Tavern only because a close friend knew the owner. I spoke with Afton (a shady a$$ manager) on several occasions and was very specific about what I wanted. I paid $720 two days prior to my event for bottle services and VIP seating and received a text confirming my reservations. After dinner my guests and I were ready to transition to our reserved section only to be told ""it was given to another party because they paid more."" I was livid - I mean it was my birthday. And what manager does that? Oh, I know - a money hungry subpar one. And what's worse is the other manager agreed with her decision. She then had the nerves to suggest that she can seat us in a smaller section at the same price. Of course that wasn't happening, so I demanded my money back and left immediately.

The first course (shrimp cocktail) was fine, however the main course (blacken catfish) has weird ingredients that made the dish ok but nothing I'd ever need to eat again.

Three of the four of us thought the food wasn't good enough to bring us back. The service was terrible. We had to ask for the restaurant week menu. After we ordered, it took over 30 minutes for each course. The serving staff continuously brought things out (like spoons and soft drinks) twenty minutes after it was asked for.

We asked the ""manager"" what was the hold up, he told us that there was a party refusing to leave (as if there were no more tables) so we asked if they could just seat us at another table that we noticed was empty and we were denied...at this point we are pissed because it is now 9:30 (it gets better) so he then comes to us and say ""I'm sorry the dinner menu will be over at 10"" (lets not forget we had RESERVATIONS for 8:30). So after explaining to him that that was his problem we were able to order off the dinner menu (by the way we have yet to be seated) . We were finally seated at 10:15pm and orders were put in. At 10:45 our server comes out and tells us that they only have enough pork chops for 2 dinners and not the 4 that were ordered (WHY ARE WE FINDING THIS OUT 1 HOUR LATER????) However 2 of us switched and ordered the salmon (dry and nasty).  After asking to speak to another manager (I believe her name  was Page) she came out and was super nice gave use 2 bottles on her (with the sparkles lol) and some free appetizers.

We were fine with that we just sat at the bar and chatted a bit; however, 9:30 pm came around and we still aren't seated. The manager indicated that they are waiting on the party prior to us to leave (which they have been there since about 6 pm) he then sent one of the waitress over to tell us that we probably won't be able to order from the dinner menu because it's over at 10 pm. Considering that it's no fault of our own that we are waiting on this party to leave and no accommodations were made just in case this happens this wasn't our problem. The Manager then says we can order from the dinner menu and while we were at the bar they took all of our orders. We finally were able to sit down at our ""reserved"" table around 10 pm.

I wish I would've gotten a chance to go home and clean up first because I felt really out of place (my office is a casual office).  We got there and they asked us about a reservation and we got weird looks because we didn't have one. We eventually got seated but there were no tables left so we were seated at some weird, trendy booth with a ottoman looking thing as a seat. Super uncomfortable but whatever. We got the menus and the food is pricey. It's a cajun food menu. In my mind I was thinking this could be awesome or awesomely bad. They also had a bunch of fu fu cocktails but no beer taps (we all know what a beer snob I am). Which I especially saw as blasphemous since I was watching the Bears game. But whatever. They had Matilda by the bottle so I got one of those and we ordered.  I had the catfish poo boy and my friend had hush puppies and we split another appetizer. Let me just say eating here was damn near a religious experience. The food is beyond fantastic. I'm not a fan of hush puppies so they were just ok. But everything else almost brought tears to my eyes. The sweet potatoes fries were just outstanding. They're roasted wedges that are caramelized. Oh lord!  The head chef came out and greeted us. He chatted us up a bit and gave us some of his background. He was super nice and talked to us for awhile. We felt really special.  The actual watching the game part sucked though. There was a dj playing club music during the commercials and occasionally that overlapped into the actual game itself. And it was clear ppl were there to hook up and chat and not watch the game. Same thing happened to me at old fifth. I basically need to stop letting my friends pick the bars I watch Bears games at. Lol!  I've noticed this place is a hot spot for the promoters now.

That's not what upset me , what upset me is the way the hostess spoke to me and that she have me some BS reason and then told me I could stand at the bar then come back to check every now and then wth !

I arrived for my reservation and was told there was ""at least a one hour wait and next time try to come two hours earlier because we get busy""...this totally defeats the purpose of a reservation. The manager gave us a ""comped"" bottle of Moët for our patience. Besides the waitress not being attentive, the grits were dry and bland and the egg on my étouffée was undercooked. Then the sous chef was nice enough to let us know that he was drunk (unprofessional). The waitress dropped the check without asking if we wanted anything else so we decided to pay the check and leave. When I looked at the check I noticed we were charged a $56 gratuity on ""service"" for the comped bottle of champagne. After speaking to the owner (who didn't seem bothered), the gratuity was taken off. He was then ""nice enough"" to make an excuse for the horrible service with ""we just opened 14 days ago"".

2013-11-11,1.0,"THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!!!!!!!!!! This place needs new management because management does'nt know what they are doing. You can tell there is a lack of experience by the way they handle situations. The manager on duty when I came was PATRICK by the way.....Anyway lets get to it. So I've been recieving alot of emails and texts about this place for a while, so me and a friend decided to check it out. I read the reviews on here before coming and alot of people complained about not being able to be seated. I decided to make a reservation to avoid that drama. My reservation was at 12:45pm I walked in on time and it was extremely crowded. I wasnt worried about that because I know me and my company had a seat. Ummmmm yea, when I checked in with the hostess (who was very nice by the way) she told me that they are waiting on some seats to clear and its gonna be about a hour wait and they will call or text me when a table open up. I'm like WTF!!!! A party came in after me with a reservation and they were told the same thing. So we all decided to wait by the bar. 10-20 mins have past and I still havent heard anything. I decided to leave, but not tell the hostess we were leaving just to see what time they were gonna text me and let me know when my table was availible. At 4pm I still havent heard nothing (Im glad I didnt wait there), so I decided to call and speak to the manager. The hostess picked up the phone and said her manager was somewhere doing something and unavailible. She asked what I was calling about and I told her I was trying to find out what happened to my 12:45pm reservation that I showed up on time for and why havent I heard anything. She told me that when a manager makes a decision she has nothing to do with that. I did express that my issue was'nt with her at all (considering she's probably been dealing with irate patrons all day) I just wanted to talk to the manager. I never got in contact with him that night and I called again today and they took a message. He still has not reached out. Whats the point of making a resevation if the venue isnt gonna honor it and do their own thing. I will never step foot in this establishment again and besides.....I heard wishbone is cheaper and taste better. If management don't change, this place will not last . especially in River North where resturant competition is high.

This is more of a bar then a restaurant and I think they are struggling on which one they want to be.  The service wasn't bad and the food good. But, $24 for a bowl of shrimp and grits is insane. Although it was good I didn't care for the texture of the grits. Wishbone is much better. I have no problem paying for a good meal, but $50 for a bowl of shrimp and grits and one cocktail is crazy.

Food took an hour and a half to reach our table after ordering. On top of that, our food came out cold, and not as we ordered. I asked for egg whites, she told me-- upon delivering the food to the table, that they don't do egg whites. My pancakes came out cold and soggy as if they'd been sitting out for 20 minutes. Before we were seated, it took about 20 minutes for them to locate our table (which we reserved online yesterday).

The restaurant is beautiful and has a great vibe and ambiance.  We were about a group of around 10 people. When everyone got there around 8:45, we were going to order drinks. There is NO drink menu. Ok, I asked her to make me a pear martini. In a world of marshmallow vodka and cake martinis, a pear martini should be simple. LOL It wasn't. The waitress asked me what was in it. I basically said St. Germain, pear vodka, etc. She gave me a rocks glass with pear vodka and st. germain that was too strong where I couldn't drink it. She then gave me a glass of pinot noir. There was no wine list and had no idea what I was drinking. The wine tasted like chalk, GROSS. I checked into Four Square and they said there was a daiquiri special lol. Really? I would love to see how they would make a daiquiri.  It took forever for our appetizers- around 40 minutes.  I ordered the wings and others ordered salads and corn bread. The seasoning on the wings were good, but the sauce was an unpleasant yellow color. It was blue cheese mixed with something-just weird. Than we didn't get our entrees for another maybe 30 minutes. I ordered the shrimp and grits. For a restaurant claiming they are Cajun/Creole, it was horrible! The shrimp were overcooked and rubbery, The grits were so bland. There was absolutely NO Seasoning on anything. It was gross! My friend got the filet. It was so small and her gorgonzola mashed potatoes were grey. It was so unpleasant! I didn't even want to wait for another bad drink or dessert. I asked for my separate bill instead of waiting for 10 people. By then it was already 11pm, I was done.I gave her my credit card to cut down the time. It took forever!! NEVER GO HERE AGAIN! I live in River North, a few blocks down. If you are going to open up a restaurant in River North and call it Cajun/Creole, you better bring it! Season your food. Maybe they should take a trip to New Orleans and see. The food there is so incredible and I love the concept of having it here in Chicago. I understand it's a new restaurant, but you had a soft opening. Get it together!

2013-11-05,5.0,"Let me preface this review by saying my expectation for this place was that it'll be just okay. One of my friends suggested this restaurant and given they only had a 3.5 overall rating (when IMO, a lot of newly open restaurants have inflated ratings because of their friends highly rating them), I wasn't expecting much. Also, it wasn't a good sign when we got there because the service was super slow and we waited a significant amount of time to just order our food.  However, the food was worth the wait! Since there were 5 of us, we got to try a wide variety of items and we enjoyed every single dish. The highlights were the shrimp and grits, cornbread and sweet potato fries. I was amazed at how delicious the shrimp and grits was, especially given I don't care for grits. My favorite place for cornbread was Bandera and Nouveau blows Bandera out of the water with their cornbread. We actually had to order another one because one was just not enough. And their sweet potato fries have a caramelized exterior that is a great contrast to the softness of the sweet potato flesh.  It's been awhile since I've been this impressed with the food. I really can't wait to go back! And FYI, it's a great place to watch a game with the flat screens that they have.",0.993,0.773,0.206,0.021,0.533481116584565
