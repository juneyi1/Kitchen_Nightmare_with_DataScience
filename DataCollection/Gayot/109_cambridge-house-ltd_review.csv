2010-08-19,1.0,"I'm glad this beastly place is closed, and I'm glad that I found it on Yelp so I can wax poetic about how terrible it was.  The omlettes tasted like they were deep-fried in a toilet full of VO5 Hot Oil, and the ambiance was like the break room at a funeral home.  The staff hated working there, and It showed.  The management hated the staff, and that also showed.  Everyone was greasy and miserable.  Worst Restaurant Ever in the History of the World.",-0.9062,0.684,0.108,0.208,0.7208333333333333

2006-02-07,1.0,"Ugh. Come on, fellow Yelpers.  Let's have some standards, here.  This joint in NO WAY deserves three stars.  The burgers are pre-made, gristly chuck patties.  The chicken breasts are cheap and never trimmed of fat.  The omelettes are serviceable at best, and I'm not even sure they cook with real butter.  Bottom line, if you're looking for an average meal garnished with limp parsley and foodservice coffee that tastes like it was brewed six days ago, and the word service means nothing to you, hit the Cambridge House.  Otherwise, keep looking.",0.0013,0.857,0.067,0.077,0.5769841269841268

2005-07-15,3.0,"Cambridge House is your standard diner for breakfast, lunch, and dinner in a convenient location off of Michigan Avenue.  They serve everything from pancakes and eggs to salads to sandwiches to liver and onions.  Not too many options for vegetarians, but plenty of choices for everyone else.  Service is brusque, but they get their jobs done and you can easily be in and out in an hour's time.",0.4767,0.955,0.045,0.0,0.4444444444444445
