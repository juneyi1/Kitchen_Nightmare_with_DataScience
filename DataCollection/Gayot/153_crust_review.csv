The only thing with moisture was the squash, which was seriously sparse on the pizza. The result was emptied drinks and people reaching across to get more of the mushroom pizza.

Crust was actually our like third, fourth, or fifth choice for the evening. We started out near the lake, then gradually made out way west to Ukrainian Village, and eventually to Crust. Parking was a biznatch, but somehow I landed some baller spot across the street [after 9PM its free like Willy]. I dropped my friends off to put our names down for a table...little did we know that it wasn't very busy. The hostess couldn't count, apparently. My friends said we were a group of 3, and she repeated it then left. There were like seven other tables, but she took a minute to look for a one for us. She sat them at a table for two. Umm...*carry the one, divided by 12, square root, multiple by pi* that doesn't work. I'm a math teacher. I double checked my work. Oh well. It was a good laugh. Well, we were seated and looked at the menu. Pre-set pizzas, but apparently you can request to leave off ingredients on their masterpieces. We wound up ordering the flamkuchen, chicoria, and stuffed bbq brisket. Imagine California Pizza Kitchen-sized pizzas for a couple dollars more than CPK. Keep in mind, you're getting organic shiznit.  Here's the skinny on the pies: Flamkuchen: Definitely the top dog of the three. Applewood smoked bacon, caramelized onions, *drooL* must have when you go. Chicoria: Imagine eating the Earth. yeah...it tastes like that. So if you're into the Earth and stuff, this one's for you. Stuffed BBQ Brisket: Giant calzone-type pie, with a sweet bbq sauce and tender brisket. There are TWO outdoor seating areas: one in the front and one in the back #twss. So you can get lucky if eating outdoors is your thing. I was very happy, and am actually a little surprised by the lack of love on Yelp. I honestly can't wait to head back to Crust and order other pies. I hear the OG [original gangster] is where it's at. So that's next on the list.

2011-07-22,3.0,"This recent heat wave in Chicago was a pain. Instead of having a few relaxing nights at home to catch up writing and some TV, we ended up sitting in a dark apartment with no air conditioning or internet. The power was out for over 24 hours and two evenings, it was a total bummer. Anyway, the only good news from the recent weather is that al fresco dining becomes a lot more fun at night. If there's one thing I always look forward to in summer it's long warm nights. Last Saturday we took advantage by eating early and outside on Crust's spacious beer garden/patio. It was my first visit to Crust and likely my first visit to an all organic restaurant. As the name implies half the menu is pizza, but there are other choices as well like salads, flat bread and antipasti. Our overall view was the food was fine but nothing to get too excited about. For what it's worth I do enjoy the concept of organic farming and sustainability. We need more of that and I'm happy to support the cause. So that concept alone made my meal a little more enjoyable and might be the biggest selling point to return. The patio is very nice, large, AND they promote bringing your dog along with beer specials for dog owners. It all adds to the environment. We started with the soup of the day which was avocado cream with cucumber. It's yogurt based and quite refreshing, reminding me of a green version of gazpacho. One of our favorites was the simple Sun salad ($8) of organic mixed greens, cucumber, grape tomatoes, shaved carrot, seaweed salad, garlic croutons and ginger vinaigrette. It's fresh, light, and quite tasty even though it wouldn't be hard to replicate at home. The ""bruschetta"" section offers many choices other than the traditional cheese and tomato. You can mix and match or go for one. We went with three different kinds - the avocado/pesto, hummus/anchovy and burratta/tomoato. Since there were three of us eating we each chose one where I continued my green theme of the night and love of pesto. It was the best and most interesting of the three and think there's a good future for a mixture of pesto and avocado in our apartment. Finally the pizzas. We ordered two: a pepperoni and the recommended  Flamkuchen ($13) with béchamel, applewood smoked bacon, caramelized onions, caraway seeds and parmigiano reggiano. The pepperoni was somewhat ordinary. Well cooked but nothing more than what I would make from a frozen pizza at home. Again, I enjoyed the ""organic"" nature but I'm not convinced it translated into better taste (just better consciousness). The Flamkuchen was more interesting and unique. There's a little too much bacon for my liking but I know that's a crazy statement to most. I did enjoy the bechamel and caramelized onions, a tasty and addicting combination of flavors. The crust and dough on both pizzas were first rate so I understand where they got the restaurant name idea. The undisputed best course of the night was the last. We had a sweet tooth and chose the caramel apple strudel and chocolate fudge brownie. The ice cream is from the local hot spot Black Dog Gelato and is always amazing. Neither desert lasted long and that wasn't because they melted. I preferred the chocolate brownie and vanilla gelato - a combination always delicious but executed well here. Crust does everything you'd expect from a neighborhood pizza (and more) spot and sporting a generous outdoor seating area. They probably thrive in the summer and survive in the winter. The food quality is top notch and the ""organic"" angle gives it a leg up for diners seeking social and health consciousness. Nothing from the meal was outside the range of average and normal, but that's not always a bad thing. The pizzas are nice and fresh and a good alternative when deep dish is not the answer. I liked our salad a lot and there are plenty of choices for repeat customers. I'm sure we'll return on another nice evening to sit outside, have a beer and enjoy high quality produce and healthy alternatives (without forgetting dessert of course).",0.9993,0.776,0.202,0.022,0.4981163458291116

They have great cocktails and beer selection.  Different specials throughout the week, such as half off bottles of wine.  Service can be hit or miss, only had one bad experience.  The only bad experience I've had there, and I've been there a handful of times, was when I went for a friend's birthday and the place was packed, and I think our server must have been new.  We had HORRIBLE service, and they even charged my friend for his birthday dessert.  However, the food is always good!

2011-07-20,4.0,"Yes, it really is all abou tthe crust.  The best crust, the way I have only read crust is supposed to be on a true pizza.  Crunchy with a little elasticity underneath.  Thin and light and yummy.  Now I love deep dish as much as the next proud Chicagoan, but this is another animal and this pizza is a wonderful thing.  This is not a canned tomato paste kind of pizza. A group of four girlfriends ordered the Mexacalil Blues, Chicoria and The Original Gangsta all to share.  I was so in food heaven on each and everyone of those I didn't bother analyzing the ingredients.  I just know they were all delicious with the Chicoria probably being my hearty earthy favorite.  We also ordered the goat cheese appetizer which was wonderful. The baby beet salad and shaved fennel salad were pretty but not that flavorful to me.  And certainly not that fullfilling - not good for sharing as they were rather small.   The bottle of Torrontes was very flavorful and hit the spot on this 95 degree visit.  Still we sat outside in the back and under the canopy.  They had a fan running I think, because we were quite comfortable.  The service was slow but we weren't in a hurry and I guess he figured that out. The pizzas ran about $14-16 each, the salads were $8 each and the goat cheese was $5.  The wine was $27. Such a great spot on this fun stretch of Division street.  Plenty of choices for a night cap across the street even on a Tuesday night, all with sidewalk seating.  Fun, fun, fun.",0.9978,0.715,0.266,0.019,0.5521645021645022
2011-07-20,3.0,"I'm teetering between three and four stars but since it's hot outside and I'm shvitzing and crabby, I'm rounding down. I'd been carrying around one of those damn $10 A La Card thingies for Crust around in my wallet for the longest time and finally got to use it last night. Sometimes saving a little money is just the nudge I need to get me to try someplace new and not in an area I frequent often. My gf and I dined on the front patio because I wanted to sit outside. I only wish I'd known about the outside seating area in the back instead because sitting smack dab on Division Street wasn't the most relaxing way to enjoy a leisurely dinner. We each started with cocktails, an Islander for me, and a Cucumber Collins for her. As seems to be the case lately, I liked my friend's drink better (cucumber-infused vodka, Hendrick's, muddled cucumbers, simple syrup, mint and soda), so I drank most of hers. Mine was a mix of Crusoe rum, grapefruit-infused Prairie organic vodka, pomegranate and grapefruit juice. Apparently Crust infuses their own vodka, so good for them. Our waiter was a pleasant fellow and checked in on us several times after we got our drinks to see if we were ready to order. My friend and I  hadn't seen each other in a while, so we were too busy gabbing to look at the menu. After the fourth time he asked, we felt bad and finally ordered.  Friend started with a fennel and green apple salad and I with the grilled portabello mushrooms. Her salad was light and fresh, and the apple contrasted nicely with the fennel. My mushrooms were meaty and smoky, and quite a generous portion, especially for the low price. All of their pizzas sounded quite tasty so we had a hard time narrowing down our choices, but eventually we settled on a 'Verde' and a 'Basilico' which was more than enough to share. The pizzas came out pretty quickly and looked fantastic. The Verde pizza had a light bechamel sauce base, hearts of palm, ricotta, pecorino, fresh spinach and arugula, and was topped with shaved parmesan. I'd never had hearts of palm on a pizza before but I really liked it and thought it complemented the other ingredients well. The Basilico was fine, if a little boring. Standard-issue tomatoes, mozzarella and basil. It tasted fresh, but I'd probably go for something more exotic next time. I heard they had rice pudding and since I love a good rice pudding, I had to try it. Sadly, it wasn't the best. It was really dense, not creamy at all (sad face) and tasted faintly of coconut (blech!). I recently discovered that the chef/owner, Michael Altenberg, also owns Bistro Campagne (which is one of my favorite restaurants), and used to own Campagnola in Evanston. It's also worth noting that he was doing the whole local/organic thing long before everyone else jumped on the bandwagon. I'll be sure and give Crust another try.",0.9971,0.783,0.168,0.049,0.5604350963046615

2011-07-07,2.0,"Came in last night with great expectations after hearing good things. Sat down outside, ordered drinks + appetizers, and then found our pizzas. That's about where everything fell apart. The server was more interested in doing his closing sidework (the walls are glass - we can see through them!) than asking if my date wanted another glass of wine as it sat empty for 10+ minutes. The pizzas, which were quoted as taking 10-15 minutes to make, came to us well over an hour later. There were only 5 other tables going, so they WEREN'T busy. The excuse? The computers were down and there was confusion. I worked in the restaurant business for over 10 years in high turnover environments when the computers went down - never experienced delays of 4-5x. So, didn't buy that excuse one bit. When the pizza came, it was good, except one of them, the order was wrong (we asked that olives only be placed on half the pizza, they seemingly put extra olives all over the pizza). Our server asked if we wanted the pizza remade - to which I smiled and said no. Seriously, at that point, the 10-15 minute pizza took over an hour to get to me, why should I wait another hour? We'll pick the olives off that half the pizza, thanks... When the bill came, he did comp one of the pizzas for us waiting so long (well done) but somehow I was charged an extra drink (not good) - when I contested, it took about 2 minutes of explaining that I never ordered a second drink before he understood that I only, in fact, consumed one beer. So, in all, the service and tempo was pretty rough - we weren't in any hurry, but hey, we were starving, and waiting that long for super thin crust pizza on a slow night and blaming it on computers being down (the receipt + credit card machines worked just fine at the end of the night - odd!) left a lot to be desired.

Only a few options, one of which, the Deconstructed Tampanade is more like a Deconstructed Pizza.  It tasted good but was too similar to our entrees.  They also have a selection of antipastos for $4, or 4 for $12.  What kind of deal is that?

The inside of Crust is really cute - it's brightly lit, is decorated in light, bright colors and just seems overall very cheery.   Soup sounded like the perfect starter to battle the weather, so I opted for the day's special: minestrone.  It was listed as being $6 on the menu, but only showed as $2 on the check and the end, which is good because the soup I was served was teeny tiny.  Like, think those little, useless coffee cups that always come in plate sets tiny.  It was also way too salty.  As anyone who has dined with me can attest, I love salt.  I salt everything.  If I think something's too salty, it'd be virtually inedible for 75% of the population. The carbonara pizza I had was much better (though this one, ironically, I felt needed salt and there's no salt on the tables).  My three friends all really seemed to enjoy their pizzas, too.  Overall I'd say the pizza was fine.  It wasn't bad by any stretch, but it didn't wow me, either.  I'd still rather have Apart.  As other people have mentioned, the pizzas aren't cheap.  I think mine was $14 and they're definitely personal pizza sized.  I don't feel the prices are out of line given the fact that the ingredients are locally sourced and organic, though.

I tried the flammkuchen - a combo of carmelized onion (a little sweet), bacon ( a little salty), caraway seeds and aged parmigiano reggiano.

2011-03-29,3.0,"Top line summary: - Ingredients are fresh and flavorful, presentation is nice as well - Beer and wine list is eclectic - Service is neutral - Decor is pleasant  - Crowd is hip but not nauseating We started the evening at the at-capacity bar in the dining room. It wasn't so crowded that we couldn't get service but all seats were claimed by patrons eating their meals so really no chance at popping a squat until our reservation was ready.  We immediately noted that the wine and beer list was a nice eclectic blend although my husband opted for a tried-and-true Flying Dog. I had the Blackberry Mojito, which was not bursting with mind-blowing flavor but was smooth without completely overpowering the bourbon. We were joining a party of 11 (friend's b-day dinner) and once our guest of honor arrived, we were promptly seated. My husband already had the Lebanese red blend picked out so got our bottle before everyone else at the table were able to even finish putting in their drink orders. It was at that point that the service began to slow a bit. Other guests at the table received their drinks at a very staggered pace, with three of them having to flag down the server to remind him..  We, however, were selfishly enjoying our wine - highly recommended.   The appetizer specials were the way to go. Three spread options (served with pita squares) were available and we selected the smoked chickpea as it paired nicely with the red we were inhaling. Hubby had the Shroom pizza and I chose the Carbonara. We did a bit of a flip flop that night - while my husband could easily devour a 16"" meat lovers pizza on any given night, he ended up taking home half of his mushroom number. Pizza usually gives me a grease-laden stomach ache but the Carbonara, although slathered with bechamel and crowned with an over-easy egg, was annihilated without a sign of tummy pain in the 12 hrs that followed. Maybe it was organic ingredients and the fact that grease and salt were not dripping from the cheese. The crust was really light and delicious - I guess that's a no-duh given the name of the joint. I guess what dipped my overall rating was the service at the tail end of the evening. Drinks were never really replenished and it took forever to get the check. We needed all the time we could get given the fact that we had no help in the check-splitting department. Part of this was probably us over-complicating the entire situation but it would have been great if the server clearly established the check rules at the start of the game. Even after we went through the tedious task of splitting across cash and credit with a comprehensive key indicating last names and our trademarked gratuity-share program, we still had to run around the restaurant to find our waiter. We finished eating around quarter after 9 but didn't get out of the restaurant until almost 10:30. Additional notes - valet is worth it in that area. Surrounding bars for the nightcap abound although we noted that there were long lines to get in and frankly, that's not how we roll these days. We headed home and I was in bed by midnight.

Crust does pizza, and on top of all the hipsters who think they need organic ingredients on their pies, they think of the poor souls who cannot normally indulge by offering a gluten-free crust for an additional $5.

We also got the mango salsa, which was really good a lot of times it's pretty weak-the mango just seems like it's barely there and the onions/peppers takes over or it's all mango.

We have the basilico, Mexicala Blues, and Sausage pizzas.  All three were outstanding.  I didn't except to like the Mexicala Blues pizza (I usually prefer standard pizza toppings), but this was my favorite of the bunch.  (And now one of my favorite pizzas in general). We sat in the back patio, and I thought the whole space was so cute!  This would be a great place for a date, or for a big party! Our server was so nice and patient.  He also made good suggestions! For 4 people we had 3 pizzas, a entree salad, and a carafe of iced tea (which was enough for each of us to have a glass).  The total was $66 (plus tax and tip).  Without alcohol, this really wasn't a bad deal!",0.9943,0.746,0.217,0.036,0.5902298850574713

The flamkuchen, bacon, bechamel, carmelized onions, and parmesan is still haunting my fantasies.  I feel like one of Pavlov's dogs, drooling just thinking about how good it was.  The crust was a little thick, and there's no tomato sauce involved, but I'm down with the new style of pizza in town. We also tried the stuffed BBQ brisket za, with melted pepper jack.  It was more like slices of a calzone than a pizza, but the BBQ was really sweet and tangy, and the brisket was tender and cooked well. As it turns out, we could have shared one pizza but we were happy to take home leftovers. We showed up late and nobody rushed us out the door, in fact our server was really great.  He was able to suggest a great brew and helped us decide which za to go with.  There was outdoor seating in the front and back, and the cocktails looked fun, but we didn't imbibe.  Maybe next time, because there will be a next time.",0.9914,0.785,0.2,0.015,0.4663019079685746

It's got goat cheese and spinach and what I think were button mushrooms. Wow. That pizza was..... a real pizza. The crust was just crunchy enough, the mushrooms deviiiiiiine, and the goat cheese.... well, I've never met a goat cheese I didn't like.

2010-09-07,2.0,"We've probably ordered delivery from Crust 20 or 30 times since they opened. We like the food so much, we even kept ordering from them after moving to Humboldt Park, ""just outside"" of their delivery area, which meant we've had to pay an extra $3 fee on top of their regular delivery charge, on top of their somewhat high prices. Generally we've had okay experiences, but tonight was just horrible. First, they sent us the wrong order by mistake. We ordered two pizzas (actually the BBQ brisket stuffed pizza and a veggie calzone, both delicious), and when (after signing the credit card receipt) the driver handed me a smaller-than-usual package I thought, ""huh, maybe they're trying to waste less cardboard on the calzone packaging."" But this was way too small, so I checked the receipt--it wasn't even my order. The small package was a(n expensive) side salad. They'd stuck my credit card slip to the wrong guy's order. I caught it just as the driver pulled away, so I called the restaurant, who said the driver was still nearby and asked him to come back to my place. While I was waiting for him again, they called a second time. The girl--and this whole time it was the same one who'd taken my order to begin with--had *just* realized my address was outside their delivery area, and said they'd need to charge me the extra $3. I hope I wasn't rude, but I wasn't happy, and I explained that while I understand the concept of an extra delivery fee I wouldn't be paying one when they had *also* just screwed up delivering my order. She didn't really apologize for the mixup so much as say ""okay, that's fine"" in the same cheerful voice as everything else. After 5 minutes or so the driver came back took the other guy's food from me and gave me...nothing. Our food was back at the restaurant, and I'd have to wait for him to come back. I went back upstairs and explained to my fiancée that I hadn't been shot or mugged, since this whole running-downstairs-to-get-the-food had taken 20+ minutes. Another 20 or 30 minutes later, the food finally arrives...with a different driver...who has no knowledge of the previous mixup...with a second credit card slip he expects me to sign. I called the restaurant again because I didn't want to risk being charged twice; same girl answers, and it didn't seem to click for her that signing twice for the same meal seemed weird. I signed it, and now I'll be keeping an eye on my credit card statement. I'd have gone into less detail, and maybe been more understanding, if I hadn't seen some of the recent reviews (like Amanda D's, also from last night) complaining about the service. The food is still really tasty but it's one of our priciest takeout options, and between the extra delivery charge and our experience last night, I can't see us ordering from them again.",-0.854,0.848,0.068,0.084,0.3340819597069597

If I hadn't started out with the amazing mango and sumthin-or-other sangria, I doubt I'd have ended the night trying to figure out how we got home from the Red Line when I couldn't remember leaving the L. Seriously, though: most sangria is either too sweet or way too wine-saturated. This drink was a perfect blend of fruit, white wine and vodka, so smooth you didn't know you were in trouble until it was too late. The only real problem is that the drink outshone the pizza. We had the Basilico. It was good, but I expected more basil and a little less salt (though the crust was lovely). Our arugula salad was a wonderful way to finish. I'm not sure why they brought it out after the pizza, but it worked out well anyway. One other note: the service was outstanding. We'd planned to hit Piece, but after being ignored for five minutes by both hosts when we were the only ones at the entry...well, that plus an hour-and-twenty wait sent us south to Division.

No this isn't some crappy deal at a bar where you get a deal on a kiddie pool of Miller Lite.  Crust has a somewhat impressive list of quality bombers and they cut the price right in half on Tuesday nights.  That means you get to enjoy these awesome beverages at a price that essentially makes them cheaper than retail.  Despite the fact that our server said this, I am a well versed BInny's patron and can attest that this is an awesome deal.  I enjoyed Dogfish Head's Red and White; a delicious Belgian style for $10.  That beer normally runs at least $13 at Binny's.  Of course let's not forget the always awesome Bourbon County Stout that comes in at the about the price of a snifter at the actual Goose Island pub.  Even if those don't sound appealing, they have a pretty long list and you'll undoubtedly be able to find something you'll want. The menu looks good and you'll need something to soak up that beer.  I've had the meat calzone a number of a times and it is an awesome pocket of meaty, cheesy satisfaction.  Too often I've thrown down $12 for similar meals that don't fill me up, the calzone does the job.

So let's start with the basics- it's in Wicker Park/Ukrainian Village and while sort of small on the inside they have both a front and back patio area, so great for summer. The wait staff is was nice (not overly, but attentive). And they use organic ingredients, so it's great for a political foodie like me! Now to the pizzas- yummo! The first time I went, I had the Pizza Carbonera and it was so delicious. The bacon had just the right amount of meatiness and saltiness, and they didn't skimp on it either. The bechamel sauce (yes I had to ask what it was, because it was on half the pizzas and couldn't figure it out), was this creamy delicious goodness that was just the right amount to marry all the ingredients together. The next night I split the wild mushroom pizza with a friend and we both really enjoyed it (she even stole my last piece from me)! Again the bechamel sauce was delicious and while I had hoped the spinach would have been cooked a bit instead of raw, it was still delicious. And the presentation was nice as well. They also make a great faux-mojito (I was driving), where they don't dice up the mint but muddle it the way it's suppose to be (hate having piece of mint get stuck in the straw or worse my teeth, ruins a good drink).  The reason Crust looses a star is because of the lack of variety. While I thought it was great as a meat eater, my veggie loving friends would have preferred more veggie loaded pizzas.

Anyhoo, we were in the front and the place had a nice steady volume of customers.  Our waiter was good, although he seemed to be forgetting to bring other tables some items, since I kept hearing him apologize, but hey....we got good service.  We started off with mojitos which were yummy and a nice size. We moved on to salads, and had the winter beet salad (seems to be a new favorite of mine this summer...hopefully, those beets were harvested in summer, despite the winter name) and the caprice (which was 6 slices of tomatoes, 6 slices of mozzarella cheese, some basil and balsamic vinaigrette dressing.  I thought it was a little overpriced for the portion size....come to think of it, I thought that all the prices were a tad bit higher than they should have been. Despite that...both of the salads were good.  We then opted to share a pizza and wanted to get something we don't usually find at a pizza joint....so we went for the eggplant pizze, which had grilled eggplant, wild arugula, roasted garlic, red onion, capers, olives, pesto & fresh mozzarella. I guess I should have assumed based on what was on it, that it would be on the salty side, but it was way too salty. I think if we had held the capers off the pizza, it would have been fine (I ended up picking them off). After that salty ending, we had to compensate our taste buds with something sweet and went for the carmel bread pudding. It was small, sweet and really hit the spot....you gotta love a happy ending. :)",0.9966,0.823,0.177,0.0,0.578718056137411

The grapefruit mojito was awesome (though not very strong for a lush like me), the beer list was expansive, and the pizzas were flavorful and delicious. The waiter was friendly and knowledgeable and recommended beers and pizzas-we were very happy with his recommendations. On the downside, the pizzas weren't very big for the price and the hostess didn't say ONE word to us. She just kind of looked at us like she couldn't understand why we were there. What part of ""table for two"" don't you understand??? In my opinion, there is absolutely zero excuse for a snobby hostess at a pizza place or any restaurant for that matter.

Not only is the food phenomenal, but the beer list is impeccable. Crust compensates for not having draft beer by putting out one of the finest craft beer bottle selections in Chicago. If that wasn't enough for the beer-geeks out there, every Tuesday, all 22oz/750ml 'Bomber' bottles are half-priced, meaning you can drink some of the finest bottle-conditioned ales out there, and pay less than you would at Binny's.

The beer list, wine list and cocktail menu are full of tasty choices - you can't go wrong. The Grapefruit Mojito is really refreshing. My husband and I typically share everything we order: an appetizer, salad & pizza, or a salad and two pizzas. The arugula salad is my favorite, but they also make an excellent Caeser. The best pizzas we've had are the Basilico, grilled eggplant, Flamkuchen, and most recently, the Peperonata - the rich flavors of the meat and peppers was a big win!

At the height of the dinner rush, we were quickly seated and our server, Sophia, was prompt in taking our drink and appetizer orders. She was very engaging and offered some very excellent suggestions, which we enjoyed. One thing to note about the drink list, you have the option of ordering tequila flights with the option of 2, 3, or 4 glasses. The choices were pretty interesting and tasted very good. I chose the 4 glass option and tried the Lemon/Lemongrass, Horseradish, Cucumber, and Cinnamon/Brown Sugar tequilas. They were surprisingly yummy. The only thing that would have made it better was if they had a bacon infused choice, but that goes without saying. Bacon makes everything better! I ordered the stuffed BBQ brisket pizza. I generally am a pretty standard pizza lover, and before I go on, get that nasty thought out of your mind, that is not what I meant! I meant, I just enjoy consuming pizza with that standard toppings. Sheesh! Well, despite my general preference the BBQ brisket pizza was mouth-wateringly good and filling. I had 2 pieces of mine and a piece of my friends, he got the  Flammkuchen pizza, which had  roasted slab bacon, caramelized onions, bechamel, caraway seeds, aged parmigianao-reggiano Like I said, bacon makes everything better! We ended up taking the rest of our pizza's home and I am looking forward to this evening to finish what I started last night. So, as you can tell I enjoyed the food and drink. Now for the critiques. They have valet parking, but only one valet so I had to wait for sometime on the curb for him to show up and give him the keys. Still, it was worth paying him $10 than to have to drive around and find local parking. The other thing that would comment on is that though the restaurant was clean and did have style, the style just did not do anything for me. For others, it is probably perfectly fine.

2010-02-12,3.0,"Deciding what to rate Crust was actually kind of tough. While describing my dinner to someone, I went from ""delicious!"" to ""good, fine"" in about a sentence and a half. Hmmm, that's not a positive sign. It also says, ""I'm totally confused, please don't listen to what I'm saying."" After over-analyzing my inner food psyche, I've determined the underlying meaning of my previous statements: the restaurant's mission (organic, local, a combo of both) is what I believe to be ""delicious"" but the food I ate in reality was ""good, fine.""  Is it just me, or is the entryway at Crust kind of confusing? I couldn't tell if the carryout counter was also where to check in for our reservation. So we just sort of stood there, looking around sheepishly, until we asked one of the cooks behind the counter where to go. He told us just to walk into the dining room. Okay, good to know. Our server was nice, good, fine. We didn't really engage her by asking for any explanations, except to hear what the desserts were...and then promptly ordered them right after we finished our respective meals. I ordered the special french onion soup for a starter, and then the shroom pizza as my main; my other mealmates started with the chips and then ordered the brown derby salad and the arriabata pizza with shrimp. Our food was good, fine. It all tasted good, fine--that is, except for the arriabata pizza, because the idea of shrimp on a pizza is just plain wrong to me. I didn't totally like that the spinach came in a pile on top of my wild mushroom with bechamel sauce concoction, because, I will tell you, it was difficult to eat. And when I eat pizza, I'd like to scarf it. No such luck. I was also puzzled as to the approach: the crust is pretty crunchy, so the slices aren't totally conducive to the fold-and-eat. Do I eat it with a knife and fork? No, that seems unnecessary. Okay, I'll just hold each slice with both hands and slowly lower it into my mouth. Doesn't that sound glamorous? Anyway, we all had dessert, and while we were hyped up to order it, I noticed that none of us really made any comments about what we ordered. Silently eating dessert is sinful. It should be filled with ""oooh"" and ""mmmm"" and ""OMG that looks so good, can I pleeeease have a bite?"" Nope, nada. I ate my apple tart (good, fine) and was ready for the check. Maybe my expectations were too high? (As in, delicious). Maybe I wanted to be impressed? All in all, just A-OK. And willing to give it another try.",0.9697,0.785,0.129,0.086,0.5668108379715522

I also enjoy their calzones as they fill you up which most of their food does not but one minus is the tomato sauce is terrible. Something about it is just wrong.

I split the main dish with my date, the carbonara flatbread.  The problem is that it comes as a whole pie without any slices cut in it.  If the flatbread weren't so tough, I wouldn't mind, but just trying to cut slices was making a huge mess. Also, I find the non-alcoholic drinks to be a little bit silly.  There's basically a selection of lesser known sodas and some kitschy fruit drinks that are basically virgin cocktails like ""Safe Sex on the Beach.""  These in my opinion are overpriced for what is really just juice.  In addition upon being seated, I felt like I was dealing with a hotel mini-bar because there was some fancy name brand water on our table that we were given the choice of or tap or sparkling.  Maybe I'm just not that classy.

Our waiter seemed to have a hard time remembering we were there as he took our order, served our food and wasn't seen again. We had to track him down to get our check and he apologized saying they were short staffed. There were no guests in the restaurant by the time he told us this. We started with the Chips and Dip appetizer, and boy...they weren't lying. We got a bowl of Ruffles potato chips and an underseasoned sour cream dip that I have a hard time believing they made themselves. Seriously, they are charging me to put Ruffles (which last I checked weren't organic) on a plate. Lame. Don't feel like I ever need to go back. Save yourself the money and buy your own bag-o-chips and dip and a nice Tombstone pizza.",0.9566,0.78,0.15,0.071,0.4472222222222222

On the plus side: large variety with some interesting combinations.  Our party seemed to like the mushroom pizza and the carbonara - slap a fried egg on anything, people are bound to love it.  There was a large group of us, so we were able to order 7 or 8 of the pizzas to sample the different flavors.  The service was pretty spot on and they separated our checks very nicely.  I liked the outdoor patio, decor and ambiance were trendy but not overly so. Ironically, the least satisfying part of the pizza was the crust - too much of it exposed on the top (which means far too little of the actual toppings) and much of that naked crust was burnt.  You'd think the namesake of this joint wouldn't be pointing out their biggest flaw.  Now I get the ""we're organic, we're hip"" thing they're going for here, but if organic means poor quality for a high price?

Secondly, my palette is not refined enough to appreciate the organicness (is that even a word?) of all the ingredients I can't even pronounce - whether that's a good thing or not I don't know. I will say the carbonara (bacon, peas and fried egg) and Mexicali blues (provolone, roasted shrimp, cilantro and lime) were rather interesting and new. The outdoor patio is also a great chill space. Overall, I have to give it at least a three star review. It would just be wrong to give Crust any less stars than what I gave Ian's pizza, and plus I feel like they're actually trying to put together some original recipes, not the what-can-I-put-on-a-pizza concept at Ian's.

So it turned out that Crust was just the right choice.  We hadn't been there in a long time, so it was like going to a place we hadn't been before.  It wasn't packed solid like when they first opened.  could have been the time of day or day of the week: a little before 6 on a Wednesday.  We got seated right away with our choice of sidewalk, restaurant, or back patio.  We chose the back patio--who wouldn't, it's very pleasant back there, especially in the summer.  Aside from the plethora of families with small kids (3 groups) that happened to be there a the time)--which wasn't too bad-- it was very pleasant experience. BF was impressed with their selection of craft beers.  He tried two different IPAs and I tried a whet beer from Montreal that was light and refreshing.  For our appetizers, we started with a Caesar salad and the ""tapenade.'  The Caesar salad was crisp and well-made.  It featured a stack of dressed whole Romaine leaves on an oblong dish, topped with a seasoned cracker and shaved parmesean.  The tapenade was good but a bit disappointing.  I though the portion was somewhat meager and heavy on the bread.  It was basically a small dish of baked pepper, onion, garlic, and a couple olives and maybe a teaspoon of goat cheese for $9.  not what I had in mind, but what there was of it, I enjoyed. We got a couple of veggie pizzas: the Margherita and the cheese and fresh herb.  Both were good--the crust is perfect, as it should be at a place called ""Crust.""  The only thing we were thinking was that we ordered two pizzas that lacked tomato sauce.  i thought I had avoided that by avoiding the two pizzas on the menu that were white pizzas or specified that they had bechemel sauce.  so that left us to wonder which f their pizzas if any had tomato sauce....

It took aver 4 hours from the time we arrived till when we left, to finish our whole meal.  We were a part of four, and I went to put my name in for a table outside. The host told me that I'd have to wait for my whole party to arrive, since only two of us where there- totally understandable. He gave me the impression that when they got here, we'd have a table in no time. Well, when my friends did arrive, the wait went up to about 45 minutes. Darn! Not Crust's fault, just bad luck. So they gave me one of the electronic pagers and went across the street for a drink. The 45 minutes pass, and we show up. The host tells us we're going to be seated next. We watched as two other parties are taken to their tables. The most annoying was a similar party of four told us they'd only been there 25 minutes. The host comes over to apologize, probably sensing our angst or realizing we were forgotten(?), and offers us a round of drinks at the bar and an appetizer, which we accept and enjoy for another 30 minutes or so why we wait for our table, while the restaurant empties out for the night. Finally we sit down, order pizzas to split and enjoy the back patio. It's spacious back there, and I'd recommend it if you're looking for outdoor seating plus pizza. The pizzas come, and we realize that one of the pizzas was the normal shrimp, not the special, so it gets sent back. Another blunder, but our waiter is very gracious the whole time. In fact, everyone we dealt with all night was like that. I've only been to Crust a few times, but the staff all seem to be unpretentious and warm.  So there's more waiting for our correct pizza to arrive, then the bill. That also needed clarification, because of the replaced pizza and comped drinks and appetizer, but I didn't get all the details because I let the others in my party work it out.

I'm glad that I did, because overall I really liked the restaurant.  Extra points for being open on Memorial Day, when our first several choices of restaurants were not.  Our server Justin was good, although he disappeared a bit in the latter third of our meal.  Plus, they had a surprising beer selection (all bottles, alas).   The pizza  was...good but not great.  For $15 they are probably pushing it a bit.  I had the arabiatta with shrimp.  The shrimp was surprisingly generous, but I wouldn't have minded a little more sauce and cheese.  I get the Neapolitan style, but when there is more shrimp on your pizza than sauce and cheese combined, something is amiss.  Just the right amount of basil though, and the sauce was really good with just a bit of heat.  I tried my friend's mushroom pizza, and it was good, except that I don't like goat cheese, and the proportion seemed overwhelming to me. The highlight of my meal was the caprese salad.  So simple, but when done well, an absolutely divine combination of flavors.  Crust's was one of the two or three best that I have ever had.  I was moaning with almost every bite.

Once the salad was cleared, the pizza was actually quite tasty.  It was covered (seriously, COVERED) with two kinds of mushrooms and goat cheese.  I love mushrooms.  I love goat cheese.  My opinion of the de-spinached pizza is thus understandably high.

One of the other pizzas we had had the appetizer salad on top of it - dissappointing. So dessert -  they said they had a chocolate souffle - yum okay I'll try that. It came sitting in a bowl of almond milk.   what? yes literally sitting in a bowl filled half way with milk -  when the waiter came back I asked him if that was a mistake -he said no I said it was terrible - he said thanks for the input - they were trying for something shi-shi - and he took it off the bill.

On the positive recommendations of two trusty Yelpers, I sent my mom and sis here for a lunch spot in the neighborhood, while I was at work and could not play tour guide.  They raved about it so much that afternoon that I decided I needed to head there to pick up one of their personal sized pizzas to go, to have as an appetizer with some wine before dinner.  Between the pizza I picked up and my mom and sis' leftovers I got to sample the wild herb and cheese, shrimp arabiatta and grilled eggplant pizzas.  They were all great.  I am a fan of very thin crust pizza with fresh ingredients.  Crust definitely delivered with taste, quality ingredients and flavor combinations.  In picking up my pizza to go on a Friday night at 7 I over heard that the wait for a table was over an hour- so if you are planning a weekend dinner I would recommend a reservation!

My friend and I used to frequent Crust pretty regularly.  We called it getting Crusty.  On my last visit in May or June we decided to wear suits and have a ""business lunch"".  I later got into a fender bender with my mail lady and she threatened my mail service.  Studies show that mail carriers really DO tend to have higher rates of erratic behavior.  There is a reason behind most cliches you know... Anyhow.  I decided to get Crusty again over the wknd. after a handsome YELPER reminded me of my forgotten culinary pleasures.  I will admit that the last time I was there, I had wished for more new choices.  I love love love spinach, goat cheese and mushrooms, but someone said something about a baked potato on top of a pizza, and I ran for Division Street. So there we were.  By the time Friday rolls around, I am so exhausted and in need of a glass of wine.  Unfortunately the server wasn't too aware of us for quite awhile.  By the time he got to us, he bent down and told us he has having a rough day.  He said he had a cough.  I held my menu up in front of my face in hopes he would take that as a cue to go into the kitchen before he stuck his other foot in his mouth, but he just carried on.  He said it wasn't contagious but that things weren't going well for him.  It really is in my nature to just want to talk these things out with people, get to the root of the problem and focus on solutions.  But I had been doing this with people all week long and now just really wanted that glass of pinot.  Fortunately he was able to move on to the reasons on what brought us to Crust in the first place and we were able to move past the awkwardness. After that things went very well for us at Crust.  The croutons have changed on their ceasar salad, I liked to crumble them up and distribute them evenly, but now we just get a slice of bread.  That's ok, I really liked my wine. So like I said, I normally get the shroom pizza and am always quite satisfied.  I don't know how long this ""Baked Potato"" pizza has been available, but it literally tastes just like a baked potato.  It was fantastic and just what I needed after another long week.  I also should add that I would publically gnaw on a stalk of green onion if it were socially acceptable, so the generous amount of green onion on top of my baked potato was the seal of approval. I do have to add that halfway through my 2nd glass of wine, the couple next to me on their first date entertained me while my friend was in the ladies room.  I chuckled at their vulnerability, while finding them to be both ""adorable"" and ""downright suckers"".  I love Friday nights. I won't complain about the price.  Half of my bill was spent on wine.  Yes, $30 for half a salad and a pizza is awfully stiff, but I make my own choices so I have no right to complain.  I love to cook, so if I can find the right comapny, I'll try this one at home.

I am also very appreciative of the fact that we had a totally cool server and not some snobby hipster.  And I know Andy M was appreciative of the fact that they served 3 Floyds Ale!  I love Unibroue ale and thought the Ephemere paired wonderfully with the Flammkuchen.  (wow try saying THAT three times fast!)

I think I'm also about the last Yelper in Chicago to visit this fine Wicker Park establishment. I thought the decor inside was modern without being too stark. After hearing all about their specialty flatbread pizzas with all-Organic ingredients I was a bit afraid there would be a Zen Pizza, with nothing served on a plate save for a placecard that said ""BE The Pizza""...I assure you, they don't go this far into artiness! The specialty pizza of the day had too many ingredients to even remember what was on it (bechamel sauce, something pickled, something glazed, something blue?), so I ordered the Baked Potato pizza. I was really looking forward to trying something with Prosciutto on it, but I guess those are seasonal. At least mine had bacon, and green onions, ample portions of finely sliced potatoes, drizzled with white cheddar and sour cream. It was good, though sour cream on pizza is a bit too much. It was alright, but it's an adventure I'll never have to take again. My dining partner had the Pepperonata, which I also had my eye on. The *not quite certified Organic Pepperoni was super tasty. How do you certify Organic Pepperoni, and why did I not care if it was not *quite Organic? Frankly, if something tastes good and fresh, that's good enough for me. The pepperoni pizza also had succulent red pepper. This pizza was good! I was impressed by the foofy drink selection and the beer list was great as well. I had the Unibroue Ephemere beer from Canada, which had a clean crisp taste of fresh green apple, which paired perfectly with my pizza, eh?! The menu advertises 1/2 priced wines on Mondays, and seemed to encourage people to come just to drink on their back patio.

I was particularly impressed by their beverage menu, with lots of great organic beer options and good prices...try the Two Bros.

Yum again! Crust is a surprisingly big place!  It has two separate outdoor seating areas and a decent sized indoor dining room.  We ate on the covered outdoor patio, enjoyed the beautiful weather, and ate good food.  The service was exceptional!  Our server was incredibly well versed on the food and equally well versed on his beers.  All of his suggestions were spot on and he even steered us away from some of his least favorite items.  He was extremely attentive and it appeared that he had a genuine interest in making our experience as good as it could be.  He was a dead ringer for Billy Crudup (Lead singer of Stillwater in Almost Famous) and the name on my receipt reads Jacques.  This place might be one of my new favorites! 2 Salads 2 Pizzas 1 Beer 1 Dessert ------------------ $60.00",0.9979,0.72,0.229,0.052,0.5912325637325636

The basil was shredded, plentiful and added after the pizza came out of the oven. There is clearly a lot of Parmesan cheese in their cheese blend. It gave a wonderful saltiness and bits of it made for great ""crusty cheese bits"" around the outer portion of the crust. With each bite you can taste the individual toppings. You can also taste the wood smoke in the crust.  I wonder if they call it flat-bread rather than pizza because the dough recipe is clearly missing the tub of butter that Chicagoans are used to.  This pizza will NOT clog your arteries. This pizza WILL make your tongue smile.  Service was slow. Our server's section included 5 tables. My 2 top was an addition to his 4 top that had already placed their order. A 5 top was added after our drink order. We were there for almost 2 hours. Arrived around 7:30 left around 9:15 on a cold Saturday night. We only ordered 2 pizzas, no drinks.  The manager (I assume) was racing around checking on people but the servers seemed to be very casual- I would have been more pleased with the service pace if I had been with a group of people and drinking. 12 oz of PBR was $4 on the menu. Not that I drink PBR, but that gives you an idea. There was a nice looking organic brew list- which I will check out another time.  Desserts were not listed on the menu.

2008-03-30,4.0,"Each time I've been here,  the restaurant has packed a full house (even on a Tues. night!) so they must be doing organic right.   Extensive beer menu-- I always spring for the delicious + refreshing Schneider Weissen Edel-Weisse.  Not sure if being organic makes it a more healthy choice, but love a Hef that boasts strong hints of banana and clove.  This one gets the job done beautifully. Servers are knowledgeable and attentive despite being perpetually slammed. Respect. Our server admitted that the sausage was the only non-organic item on the menu for now.  Very familiar with the beer menu, too.  However, I thought it was odd that he poured my 2 male companions' beers before mine.  He quickly realized his mistake and apologized.  Nice save. For starters, get the Buffalo Mozzarella salad.  The only salad of this kind that I've ever seen served without tomatoes!  And that's a good thing, to me, as I hate the acidic suckers.  To take the place of tomatoes I presume, they've added piquillo peppers as well as arugula, pine nuts and a balsamic vinaigrette to cozy up to the fresh mozzarella. Small portion, but generous on taste. Maybe because pizza isn't typically associated with health and organic living, they've dubbed the savory spheres ""flatbreads"".  I'm not hung up on names as long as Crust is in the biz of delivering taste.  And they are, because my selection, the Flammkuchen, was loaded with flavor.  Roasted slab bacon, caramelized onions, bechamel and cheese = full-on party in my mouth.  And I was smitten with the chewy wood-fired crust at first bite. I'm trying the Carbonara flatbread next time I'm in.  A clone of the Flammkuchen, 'cept they add peas, pea shoots and a sunny side up egg!  So intriguing, though I think I'll ask them to hold the peas and shoots.  Yep-- in it only for the egg.

2008-03-19,3.0,"Oooh, it's organic, wood oven pizza (don't be confused by the ""flatbread"" designation)! Apparently uncharted territory in the home of the deep dish, but not all that much of a novelty in California or NYC.  The many flatbread/pizzas offered sounded delicious, and I finally settled on the Flammkuchen. The Flammkuchen delivered some serious flavor with its smoky roasted slab bacon chunks, caramelized onions, parm-reg. The bechamel wasn't too overpowering, and the caraway seeds were hardly present. Overall, it was quite tasty and I found myself wishing that there was more in the small, six-piece serving. My only reservation about the pizza is its bread - a HUGE factor. Perhaps the reason why they are advertised as flatbreads, rather than pizza, is because it really does have more of a dense bread texture than a chewy pizza crust. If you're expecting the latter, you might be disappointed. However, I do appreciate the slightly charred taste that can only come through with a wood or coal oven (coal is much preferred). All my other friends who got the flatbread thought they were pretty good, though no one was blown away (carbonara, mexican blues, and pepperonata). It certainly doesn't help that they are all about $10-13.  Their international beer list is pretty impressive for such a small, casual joint. The Belgian Fin du Monde I had was wonderful.

We were told that the wait would be approximately one hour, so we made our way to Junbar for delicious martinis and beer (by the way, Junbar is a very cozy and hip bar!). One hour later, we headed back to Crust hoping that we'd get seated... Another hour later, (and a few more pricey but gorgeously delicious drinks later...loved the Pomegranate and Lemon Drop, Lemongrass Rain Vodka infusion on the rocks), we were finally seated. No problems with the loud, crowded atmosphere; it added to the decor. Everybody seemed to be enjoying their dishes.  We started off with sumptuous, creamy butternut squash soup (GREAT for dipping crusts later...keep it at the table) as well as hearty organic chili. Yum! As a party of four, we ordered four pizzas. It turns out this was perfect for ""sampling,"" as we passed the pizzas counterclockwise when we finished a slice. Our favorite pizza was ""Flammkuchen,"" a concoction of slab bacon, caramelized onions, bechamel, caraway seeds, and cracked black pepper; no single ingredient overpowered the other. Yum! We also ordered ""Wild Herb and Cheese,"" made with kalona creamery provolone and mozzarella, ricotta, havarti, roasted garlic, wild herbs. Very very garlicky and creamy...watch out for garlic breath afterwards! ""Mexicali Blues"" is made of wood-fried shrimp, kalona organic monterey jack, bechamel, pico de gallo, cilantro. The shrimp flavor was particularly strong...we were not sure if the shrimp was fresh.    ""Pepperonata"" was a tasty blend of melted tomatoes, pepperoni, heirloom peppers, kalona creamery mozzarella, provolone. The tastes were balanced, a wonderful pizza and a close second to Flammkuchen, in my opinion. We finished the dinner with the apple tart a la mode, served on the same flatbread used in their pizzas.  Overall, the pizzas were delicious and exceeded our expectations.  At the end of the night, we decided on a 12% tip for several reasons; we waited twice as long for our table and had slightly below average service (our waitress visited us a total of once to check on how things were going). We didn't think 12% would be a major issue, but apparently it was. Our waitress came back and asked us if there was anything we were not satisfied with. It was a bit awkward and unnecessary considering the high prices Crust charges for organic.  Despite this, we were in good spirits and very satisfied with the meal.

Gone are the unique family-farm-grown ingredients, gone is the flavor spectrum, gone is my desire to go back and try it again - which is unfortunate because I'd rather support organic and local ingredient-using restaurants. But a few weeks later and I'm still feeling sore each time I bike by with a tsk, tsk mutter under my breath.  I've been told that they've gone through a handful of Kitchen Manager's and that may have done more damage than they'd planned, so I am opting for lenience and chalking it up to the possibility that maybe that was an off night. Just not sure if I want to take my chances again anytime soon.  Okay service, yummy food, good selection of beers, good for you and not so bad on your wallet. Some may complain about the premium you pay for organic, but if organic is important to you then you'll appreciate the options. I've been a couple of times and each time ordered something different - from the spinach/shroom/goatcheese pizza to the El Greco to the sweet basil salad - and each time I enjoyed every last bite (although part of me thinks I could do just as well making pizza at home).

Also, I while I respect their efforts to stay ""organic"" I would like a little more information on how the 95% is determined.  Is this based off of food cost?  Dry weight of ingredients?  Or by the laundry list of ingredients whereas 5% or less are non-organic.  A birdie in the food distributing industry whispered in this Yelper's ear that they routinely fill the Crust food order.",0.9778,0.788,0.17,0.042,0.5263227513227513
2007-12-11,4.0,"I've been waiting patiently for Crust to get back online with their defunct website so that I could refresh my memory on the official names of some of the pizzas and cocktails my group and I sampled there the other night.... Since they seem to be content in e-oblivion, then I am fine with calling their culinary creations whatever the hell I please.  I tried Crust at the suggestion of a friend this past Friday... just a little background: Crust is Chicago's first certified all organic restaurant, and a pizzeria specifically. Even the vodkas are made and infused in-house using organic purees and fresh fruits as mixers. We initially started the evening with a group of 4 which quickly grew to 8 as we stood at the bar having pre-dinner drinks. The hostess was very accommodating at getting our multiplying posse sat quickly which was a plus in my book. The bartenders seemed a bit off/slow on this night and there was definitely a language barrier... how many different ways can I pronounce 'Forbidden Fruit' before you finally get what I'm saying & that it's plain as day on YOUR MENU?!  Anywho...  Back to the food. Our waitress was an attentive and adorable little thing from Bulgaria and chock full of suggestions on what to drink and eat. We went with almost all of her choices and were happy to do so. As a bigger group we were able to sample 6 of their pizzas and I do believe all of their signature cocktails, natch. Here's my two cents and seemingly the general consensus of my crowd:  ====== DRINKS ======    The drinks were good, and definitely strong... we were all super tipsy half-way into our meal. We sampled a few beers (The St. Feuillien Brune and Edelweiss Hefeweiss), both really good - but the excitement was definitely over the martinis and mixed drinks... The Forbidden Fruit, Fluer De Lis, Ruby Red, Blackberry Mint Julep and some Pomegranate/Lemongrass thing (I forget it's name) were all delightful, colorful and oh-so-smooooth. Cheers to that!!!!  ====== PIZZAS ======  We had mixed reviews about the pizzas... you either loved 'em or you hated 'em. I guess it's all based on personal palate, but the one that fell flat for all of us was the Shroom. What a disappointment! With mushrooms, goat cheese and spinach it sounded great...but it came served with heaping barely cooked spinach on top... the whole thing tasted like bitter greens and is not something I'd like to try again... save this one for Popeye.  *Italian Sausage w/ parmesan and caramelized onions was DELISH! *Carbonara w/ slab bacon, peas and a sunny-side up egg was adventurous and fabulous.  *White Italian Anchovy (forget it's official name) was definitely good if you dig the salty fish thing...   *Venison Bratwurst (this was a special) was OK... the venison was dry and the cheese was pretty non-descript. I'd skip this one next time.  *Prosciutto & Squash (also a special) Mmmmmm!!!! So good and great for winter. Had a fantastic flavor and was devoured instantaneously.  And there you have it. All in all the thumbs were up... The restaurant itself is pretty casual and basic... nothing fancy pants here. What is special is everything listed above, and why the hordes are actually excited to be eating and drinking ""green"".",0.9977,0.794,0.17,0.036,0.4841386554621849

The seating was a little crowded and the tables are small making for a very intimate dining atmosphere. The food was good, but again the fact that it's organic makes it better and truthfully I'd probably visit again for that reason alone to support the organic lifestyle. LOVED the cocktails though. Such a tremendous selection. I had some delightful concoction with vodka, honey and bergamot. I couldn't even taste the alcohol but could feel a bit of the buzz coming on. Salads were delicious and you can certainly split them. The beet salad was refreshing as was the special citrus salad (mixed greens, grapefruit, pomegranate and fennel).

After walking in, I noticed the cozy atmosphere - basic in decor, but a great vibe. And they have a nice back patio as well. Great in the summer, but I can imagine the wait being a bit long in the winter. Oh well, I'll have a glass of vino while I wait. Anyway, I ordered the pizza with clams, I think? (Note: I AM adventurous when it comes to food) It was heavenly - not fishy at all, just had a wonderful taste. I also tried my boyfriend's pizza, the 4-cheese and basil, and I also tried another friend's roasted pepper pizza. Seriously? It was so great! I love the thinner crust and the fact that it's served on the wooden trays... I had a couple glasses of a Malbec that was tasty, and I noticed their interesting list of vodka infusions (think: honey bergamot) that I'll have to sample next time.  And to top it all off, they are one of only a handful of certified organic restaurants in the country... I don't generally subscribe to the philosophy, but I do applaud it and think it's pretty cool.

2007-08-06,1.0,"Yeah, well $100 for 4 adults and a 6 year old and the best thing I can say was that the vegan chocolate cake was tasty. We had a mixed veggie pizza no cheese (blah), one pizza crust bread (I felt my cells dehydrating on contact), 2 meat pizzas, and two salads, plus one shitty fruit juice drink. Can't understand the draw of this place, it has a very limited menu, the food and pizza are over salty (put down the shaker should be a mantra in the kitchen) and the manager on duty should try to stop micro managing - he complained at the waitresses in a loud enough voice next to our table about the tables not being lined up enough, adn several other nit picky topics which is why it did not surprise me when he gave us some trite statement on how cute our kid was but he really needed to stop using his butter knife as a sword (he wasn't bothering anyone in the empty dining room) - prat.   The two meat eaters with us actually became ill from their pizzas later, and commented while eating that they were sub par.  My pizza had little flavor and way too much salt, we tried the seaweed salad and a mixed greens salad and the best I can say on the whole is California Pizza Kitchen does a far better job, has friendlier staff, better service and costs us less on average. Don't get me wrong, the lady with the gas can asking for donations of gas outside was a pip, and the posers parlaying at the tables made for an interesting discussion (especially the washed up 40 somethings trying their best to look 25 again ) but I would NEVER recommend this place or go to eat here again.",0.9826,0.803,0.135,0.063,0.40200817700817704
2007-08-05,4.0,"After much deliberation, I decided to go with 4 stars.  I would consider a three star place to be just average, and while there are still some issues to work out, Crust is definitely above average.   I've been there three or 4 times now so I think I can fairly review the place.  I should start by saying that I had been eagerly anticipating Crust's opening for a LOOONG time (I think I first heard about it last summer). For months the huge paper signs in the windows were taunting me, and as the opening was delayed again and again it only made things worse.  And then, finally, sweet release: Crust was open. The decor is pretty cool- mostly (or at least partially) sustainable materials, which both I and the architect boyfriend appreciate. They need to work on the AC a bit, but I guess having the doors opening up every 5 seconds doesn't help (and a note to customers- the front door is closed for a reason. If it's closed when you enter, you should really close it once you're through).  The bar menu is impressive though pricey- a nice mixed drink will set you back $8-10, but they're pretty strong so it's not so bad. But more importantly, of course, is the food. I've only had the flatbreads and salad- the sandwiches sound good, but I'm not going there for a sandwich. The caesar salad is simple and tasty, the sweet basil salad is delish (mostly due the incredibly flavorful mozzarella).  The other night I had the special salad, which was slightly disappointing as it was basically  just beets and some shaved celery. Everything was fresh of course, but I've had much better beet salads.  Now, onto the flatbreads. Hits: Flamkkuchen (slab bacon- or is it belly- and caramelized onion) Wild Herb and Cheese- could use more roasted garlic to spread on it but otherwise is very nice Italian Sausage- yummers Misses: Shroom- eh. Spinach, mushrooms and goat cheese. Honestly the mushroom pizza at D'ags is better. The special broccoli and corn flatbread from Friday night- a nice idea, but waaaaaay too salty. I haven't tried the desserts because carrot or vegan chocolate cake don't interest me nearly as much as Caffe Gelato, which is a half block away.  Basically, Crust is mostly tasty and quite reasonably priced for what you get. Of course $15 will get you a lot more pizza at most pizza places, but come on, this is clearly a different level. I have extensive experience in the organic world, and I can tell you, every ingredient at Crust is at least twice as expensive as anything anywhere else. You're paying for quality, for peace of mind, and if I may get sentimental, for a better tomorrow.   Okay enough of that.  Give Crust a chance, but get out of the 'pizza' mindframe before you go. It's gourmet, it's tasty. Mmmm Mmmm Good. And to all the people hating on the 'Eat Real' slogan- of course it sounds like Subway's 'Eat Fresh.'

To be honest I was thinking deep dish (I know only tourist like it... but well I am a tourist) and Miller Lite, but since one of them had just moved to Wicker Park they suggested Crust. One other thing to note is that I didn't pay or even see the bill so can't really comment on value of food vs. price... not sure if it was expensive or not. We sat outside on the huge outdoor patio (anywhere with outdoor seating gets one automatic star). Our waiter was awesome and I wish I could remember his name so I could recommend him because not only did he know the whole menu really well, drinks included, but also had an excellent sense of humor and even laughed at my lame stories... Anyways, the three of us (and one guy is 6 ft. 6) shared 3 flatbread pizzas and a salad- clam, mushroom, and cheese pizzas. They were all excellent and amazingly fresh tasting. Typically, I am just sorta  cheese person- but if we had one of these in Boston I think clam pizza would become a once a week thing for me.

2007-07-15,2.0,"I could've looked past the service problems if the food hadn't been so unremarkable. Really, it was just a very strange dining experience. It was like it was everyone's first time working in a restaurant. In no particular order, the peculiarities included the following: - Seating us (a group of 6) at a table that blocked the path of people trying to get to the back end of the restaurant, resulting in servers constantly bumping into some of us. - Having probably somewhere in the neighborhood of three dozen employees. It was literally CROWDED with servers, bussers, etc. - Highly aggressive bussers. Although I absolutely hate it, I realize that it's now the norm to bus tables before everyone's done eating, but these guys pushed the envelope by trying to take my friend's beer before he was done, taking the silverware of my friend who was still eating, asking me to pass my plate OVER my friend who was still eating, and, last but not least, wang-poking my girlfriend in the shoulder while picking up something from the middle of the table. That's just a sampling. I just felt like I warped to a world where they just discovered restaurants and hadn't had the time to work out the kinks. Nothing was truly terrible, just consistently dysfunctional. FOOD AND DRINK: Not good. Not bad, but not good. Everything was bland, although I guess if I have to deal with blandness, at least it's nice to have the food be ""certified organic"". Except that you pay for it. This place is pricey for what you get, including the beers. They do have a really great selection of beers, but they're all in bottles and at least $5. Just go across the street to Small Bar; at least you'll get a pint. One other thing I have to comment on is the slogan ""Eat Real"" that's written on the awning. It's like Subway's ""Eat Fresh"", except it's edgy and doesn't make any sense. Oof, Division Street. On the plus side, it's not called something like ""Gamma Player,"" which is actually the name of a clothing store across the street (which has taken the crown from G Star Raw as the store name that makes me roll my eyes the most).

2007-07-14,5.0,"Z and I went here last night for dinner and left sated. Our waitress was wonderful. I believe her name was Anglika and she had an eastern European accent, possibly Polish. I presented her the three flatbreads I was interested in trying, she decided that I should go with the cheese and wild herb but that I should add mushrooms. I went with her suggestion and it was dreamy. It is not a large flatbread, but definitely good for one person. It looked like I was going to have leftovers but than I just couldn't stop. It was so good. I wanted to split a salad with Z but instead I got a $9 watermelon margarita. It is very froufrou, very pink, and is served in a martini glass. It was very drinkable with barely a boozy taste. When I stood up at the end of the meal, I realized I was a bit tipsy. Good job, Crust.  We asked Anglika about desert and she said there was a chocolate cake that was vegan and just a bit dry but it was great a la mode.

2007-06-26,3.0,"A friend of mine describes organic laundry detergent by saying ""sure it's good for the environment, but it doesn't clean your clothes!"" ...Somehow I think that statement can be related to Crust.  Sure, it's organic, but it tastes bland.   I've been on a tour tasting all the clam pizza I could find, so naturally I had the clambake pizza (err excuse me, it's not pizza it's ""flatbread"").  The clam was obviously fresh which gets them points over just about anywhere not in New Haven.  The first piece I had was fantastic in fact, mainly due to a bit of red pepper.  Then I looked around and think that the chunk of red pepper was mistakenly dropped there.  What an odd coincidence, since it's what made me like the pizza.  The rest of the pizza just kind of tasted average, parts even bland and soggy.  It's a white pizza but could've used a little umph of olive oil sauce.  Also, part of my crust was charred so much I was breaking flakes of carbon off so I didn't have to eat it. My SO had a Caesar salad and the 4 cheese flatbread with garlic.  The caesar salad was several pieces of uncut romaine lettuce topped with bland manchengo cheese, a slice of thin multi grain bread (instead of the usual croutton?), and salad dressing that lacked any zip.  His pizza was perfectly charred on one side but the other side was raw and tasted doughy.   The garlic would have given the pizza more umph if it wasn't completely roasted to sweetness. The table next to us actually sent her pizza back because hers was uncoocked, and she requested some sauce to go with it because she said it needed something.  At first I thought she was picky but then I understood.  (We then had a whole conversation about it with her and somehow business cards were swapped...) The drinks we had were unique and good.  I had a blackberry mint julip that was fantastic.  SO had grapefruit infused vodka mojito which was also very good. The back patio was nice and relaxing.   The atmosphere was nice, some of the people were over the top annoying (the lady behind me had her shoes off and her feet propped up on the chair behind me and kept answering her phone loudly whenever it rang).  A lady in another table looked like she had just returned from a day of shopping, only problem being her bag had a giant Marshall Fields logo on it from Christmas 2 years ago.  We took our leftovers home because I love cold pizza.  This pizza was disgusting after it had gotten cold, we threw it out without eating it. I give them extra credit for ""the whole organic thing"" but with just a few tweaks this place would be a lot, lot better.   To me right now it's just average with prices that don't reflect that ($60 for 2 flatbread pizzas, a small salad, and 2 drinks is surely above average in price--organic food has its cost I guess).   To the person saying ""silence to the price, organic tomoatoes are $6.99 lb"" .. They don't buy theirs at Whole Foods, I'm guessing.  Also, most of their flat breads don't even use tomatoes.   To be fair of my assessment and to know that it wasn't just an off night for them, I'll go back and give it another whirl. The back patio was nice and relaxing. Just because things are organic doesn't mean they have to be improperly cooked or taste bland.  I'd go back but would probably make a few substitutions next time.  Organic or not, there are more than a few places with better pizza within a mile radius of this place.  3.5 stars Update: they now deliver ...

I love the first bite, the last bite, the pieces without any toppings and the odd-shaped pieces of crust lying on my plate, like fallen leaves. The place is physically beautiful, is airy and light and has varied and interesting seating. There's a lovely patio that goes for miles. But the pizza...the flatbread...whatever it is? Not wonderful. There's an overreliance on bechamel (a milk-and-flour-based sauce) as a topping, and one flatbread - a tomato/basil jobby, even has a thin layer of it. It is as if a pissaladiere ( en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pi… )  mated with a neopolitan pizza and had bastard offspring. The crust was boboli-like. It was more chewy than crisp but lacked a depth of flavor that would come from a more 'developed' dough. I also ordered the white clam pizza -- another disappointment. Dry chopped clams and caramelized onions lay on top of a thick bechamel. It was more milky than clammy... I did appreciate the fresh dried peppers and herbs placed on the table. It was a nice touch, but not enough to make up for the texture/flavor/thickness of the crust. The drinks are strong and creative and fun. Dessert is limited to a couple cakes from Bleeding Heart.

Even a reformed New Yorker like I am still misses some things from home like real thin-crust pizza and real bagels, and are forever searching for local proxies for same.  On that note, NY Bagel & Bialy and Santullo's offer reasonable options in both categories. But I digress.  Back to Crust. I'm all for sustainable this and locally-grown that and pesticide reduction and the lot, but sometimes people push all that business way over the big line labeled ""Pretentious.""  I also love cool restaurants in Wicker Park, Bucktown, etc., but add a one-syllable name like ""Mod"" or ""Toast"" or ""Schwa"" or ""Zip"" or ""Up,"" maybe throw in a black mock turtleneck, and we all know the risks.

The pizza: Dough was indeed a perfect balance of chewy and crispy, as others here have mentioned.  Toppings and cheese were also super-fresh and perfectly balanced.  One pizza, which had shrimp and cilantro and some other stuff, was a great mix of flavors. I admit there were pretentious undertones here and there, such as the list of house-infused vodkas which are probably perfectly tasty but were a little too artsy sounding for their own good.  And an important technical note: Crust is not New York-style pizza, but New Yorkers will still approve. The only two dessert options offered weren't compelling, but we didn't expect much in that department and we were happily full of pizza and salad, so it didn't matter. Prices were very reasonable, especially given the quality of the food, which made it easy to try lots of different things at once.
