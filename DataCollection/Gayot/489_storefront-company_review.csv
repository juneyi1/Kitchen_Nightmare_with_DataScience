2013-12-07,3.0,"A hungry belly and little patience led me to Storefront Co in the first weeks of its opening. Most brunch places in this neck of the woods will have you spending most of your youth waiting in line and this one particular day, I wasn't down for that jazz. I remembered Storefront had just opened and being the informed foodie I am, dragged my boo to be one of the first to try it out. We arrive and the first thing i notice is that everyone here is really freaking hot, like hotter than River North people hot. Could they pass whatever water they're drinking?Everyone that works here is also dressed like they're going to a chic lounge opening at 10:30am on a Sunday. Go figure. We're seated and I take a gander at this super chic, almost stuffy, minimalistic space that seems a little out of place for the ultra low key Wicker Park.  The server is perky, gets us water, coffee and helps us decide on what to order. I go with peach pancakes, he orders some kind of fried rice. I think he's crazy to order fried rice in this place. Our food takes a little over an eternity to arrive and our server checks up on us to let us know it's on its way. There was one or two other couples in the entire place, so I was wondering if the chef was busy too drinking the sexy water to make our meal. Alas, the dishes arrive and I'm ready to devour. My pancakes taste like rubber but his fried rice was off the chain. I offer to switch, feigning that I want to ""share,"" but he doesn't buy  it. He knows I'm not slick. I try to ingest what I can and give up.  Maybe this place was just working out the kinks as most new spots have to, but because there's endless options of brunches, I will have to be seriously convinced to come here again. Maybe if they throw in that water..",0.9003,0.906,0.066,0.028,0.5632793451758971

2013-11-24,3.0,"When I read the Chicago Tribune Review, I felt like it was a no brainer to try this restaurant. I just assumed the restaurant wasn't that full, because most people in Chicago seem allergic to anything fancy. I thought I had found a hidden gem.  The ambiance, food, and presentation were amazing. A lot of the course menu options were melt in your mouth delicious. I don't want to take away from that. I would say the appetizers and entrees were much better than the cheese course or desserts.  I've been to so many phenomenal restaurants all over the country/ world, and my main beef with the restaurant was the value and service. I have absolutely no problem paying $175-225 a person for a dinner that is outstanding. In fact, I  have a bad habit of doing that. I went with 3 other people, and we all chose* the 8 course tasting menu.  I had called the restaurant in advance to inquire about other menu selections. They said they had other menu options available.  but when we arrived the staff all had varied answers on how many menu options there were. It was almost as if they wanted to hide less expensive menu options since we were already there. It was really weird. Even if the menu does change monthly, everyone that works there should know that and have a consistent answers for patrons. The waiter and their associates kept trying to take away my plate before I had  even finished half  of my plate (at least for 4/8 the plates I had been served). For such a fancy restaurant, you would like to think they would take away plates at the same time when everyone is finished together. The dinner felt rushed, and it's not like they had patrons waiting for tables. Even when the various staff members would describe plates to us, some of them weren't quite sure what they were serving and their descriptions were spoken so quickly that you almost couldn't catch what they were saying.  I also felt like several staff members were trying heavily to upsell us on both the food and wine to the point that it was uncomfortable. The waiter didn't really listen to us either. I told him twice that I wanted a half bottle of champagne, but he still only brought me one glass. When my fiance and friends ordered wine, I told them I didn't want any. They still poured me a glass. Lastly, the $99 pre-fix isn't a terrible deal if you are a foodie and want to try some interesting food combinations, see some interesting presentations, and try unique ingredients being put together. The wine list pricing is really absurd. It's almost as if they know they have you there, so you'll spend $90 on their cheapest bottle of wine. Even restaurants like Daniel have better pricing selection options for their wine list. I now see why the restaurant was taking off the Michelin Bib Gourmand list for 2014 but not given a star. It's too bad, because the restaurant has a lot of potential.",0.9643,0.86,0.086,0.054,0.5530361757105944
2013-11-19,3.0,"We went here for the 6 course Groupon tasting menu. The service was great but the place was a ghost town. I could imagine why, the food was a little bipolar and the price (without groupon) way too high.  We loved the first and last course ( 1st - crab & last - ice cream/chocolate mousse). Although I'm a fan of stinky cheese, the cheese/fruit course was awful and the duck egg wasn't much better. The other two courses were ok but with a sticker price of $100 pp we were expecting a little better.   As a side note - all of the courses were very nicely presented.",0.3656,0.712,0.15,0.138,0.5308333333333334

2013-11-10,2.0,"Went here on Friday with a Groupon Reserve.  My biggest issue was the problems I had with reservations. I originally made reservations for a Saturday at 7 pm through Open Table but apparently you need to call for reservations with a Groupon voucher. However, I wasn't aware of this (cuz I didn't read my voucher). I did put in a note that I had a Groupon. So I get a call a few days later from Claudia (one of the partners) and was told they needed to change my reservation to 6 pm because of a ""glitch"" in the system. I had to move some things around to get there by that time, but I said ok. After I thought about it, it seemed kinda weird to me the way she kept saying it was ""glitch"" in their reservation system. Like she was trying to convince me of that. She still never said anything about having to call for reservations with the voucher. So I got to thinking that maybe they were saving ""prime"" reservation slots for people not using Groupons. I made another reservation (again through Open Table (still didn't read the voucher) ). I got another call from Claudia the next day that they needed to change my time again to 6 pm. This time she said there wasn't enough time for the tasting menu at 7 pm. Really? So I told her the deal and that this was the second time I was being bumped and that I felt like it was because I had a Groupon and that I didn't believe the excuses she was giving because each time it was a different reason. I also pointed out that reservations were wide open from 5:45 to 9:15 on that day so I am not sure why there wasn't enough time. She then got really snotty and said I wasn't even supposed to make the reservation through Open Table so it was basically my own fault.  At that point I said I was no longer interested in her restaurant and I would just talk to Groupon about it and get a refund and hung up. My husband said to call back and talk to the GM and see what the deal was. So I called back and SHE answered and when I asked for the GM, she said it was herself or Steve Harris (although she is NOT a GM, Steve is). I talked to Steve and told him the story and the first thing he said was, 'A glitch? I have never heard that one before."" I told him I felt discriminated against because I had a Groupon. He insisted that was not the case. He said he needed to check the schedule and would call me back. He called and offered me another day and time but I already have reservations for Blackbird that night. So instead I took a Friday night at 7 pm.  I went with my friend and we arrived a bit early. The hostess and Steve greeted us at the door and were really nice.  Here's where it gets really interesting - we noticed that every single table at that time was a Groupon table! The tables that came in for 7 or later were all non-Groupon tables. So it turns out that I was correct in my assumption. As for not having enough time for the service that Claudia claimed would take 2 hours or more, we were done in just over an hour. The food - I am in no way a chef or food critic but I do love food and am married to an almost chef and have friends who are chefs who have taught me a lot. I also know what food should taste like. I was not impressed with anything. The sunchoke was the best plate. The crab was nicely done. The rabbit was ok. Nothing too special though. And I love rabbit. The duck egg foam was too much. I couldn't even tell there was any foie gras.  The squab didn't seem prepared correctly. Yes it is a really fatty bird, but this seemed undercooked and the fat had not rendered enough to make it palatable. The pomegranate gelatin was like eating a jolly rancher. And I did not like the quince ravioli at all. I looked around and others also seemed to leave it behind. Not a fan of the cheese - but I am pretty picky about what cheese I like. The chocolate was really good and the waffles were great too. I just thought the menu was way over played and some of the dishes were not balanced. And way too much foam, lecithin and gelatin were used for every single plate. If I wanted all that then I would go to Moto. All of this stuff totally detracted from the taste and integrity of the actual food and some it was actually inedible. Most definitely not worth the money. Service was excellent, except we did not receive the same attention that other tables did who were ordering a lot more drinks. I felt that if we had spent more money, then maybe a manager or whatever might have asked us how things were going like they did for the other tables. Either that, or I already pissed them all off before even coming in. To sum it all up, I will definitely not be returning. I will stick with The Publican, Sepia, Blackbird or Avec.

2013-07-18,2.0,"Storefront has been on my ""want to try"" list for quite some time, so I was really excited when it was featured on Groupon.  I purchased a deal for a tasting menu for two (plus two glasses of sparkling). I was so very disappointed in our experience.  Storefront receives so many great reviews that I was expecting something truly spectacular; not only did the trip fall short of spectacular, it was at times downright unpleasant.  I am really thankful I purchased the Groupon and didn't pay retail for the food, because most of the courses were mediocre to bad.  A great example: the first course featured oysters and some indiscernable green puree (?) - the combination of super fishy-tasting oysters and weirdly sweet unidentified accompaniment was a huge turnoff.  Another dish featured a squash blossom; the presentation would indicate said squash blossom is edible, yet my husband and I found it to be extremely tough and fibrous.  The standouts - and by ""standout"" I mean dishes I didn't mind paying money to eat - included the bread, served warm with sea-salt coated butter, and the dessert, which featured caramel ice cream.  I also loved the parting gift chocolate macaroons that were presented to us at the door. My real complaint (yes, I'm just getting started, unfortunately) relates to the service.  Our meal took SO long, despite the fact we were taking part in the tasting menu and didn't special order much of anything.  Our experience started off with a bang when we sat down in a 1/3 full restaurant and waited 20 minutes for our cocktails (my husband's was served with a giant ice block, which was really beautiful, though I found myself wondering if the nearly empty glass was worth $15 - imagine our surprise when someone at the table next to us ordered the same drink and received about 3 times the cocktail!).  Our waiter, who was very pleasant but completely oblivious to the fact that we did not want to wait 45 minutes between courses, explained ""We'll get started shortly"" when he dropped off our drinks.  We then sipped our cocktails for 20 more minutes before our first course arrived.  This was so disappointing to me, since we had pre-called and informed the restaurant we would be having the tasting menu; there is absolutely no reason the first course should have been that delayed.  Each course was just as slow to emerge from the kitchen, and we ultimately left hungry and frustrated by the fact that we had just wasted our entire Friday night for such a terrible experience. Bottom line: Storefront is situated in a beautiful space, but the food is overpriced for the taste and portion size.  The inexplicably slow service really ruined it for us.  You'd be way better off waiting in the hours-long line for pizza and beers next door.",-0.7486,0.821,0.089,0.09,0.5578479308390022

The appetizer of lobster, chip, pickled red onion and oxalis was a great way to start off the meal. The acidity was really nice and bright, highlighting the rich lobster. And the parker house rolls with fresh truffle and butter with pink himalayan sea salt was a prime example of Storefront Company's attention to detail.

The head chef was slicing something right in front of me, so I asked him what it was. He told me it was beet cured salmon and then sliced very generous pieces for me and my date to try. SO GOOD.  The staff truly appreciates all of their patrons and they show it by offering genuine hospitality/personality, consistently amazing food and drinks, and they top it off with complimentary macaroons????

2013-05-02,5.0,"My husband and I were so excited to visit The Storefront Company and, boy, the owners and staff do not disappoint!  We were greeted at the door by the GM/Partner, Steve, and seated at a table for four, even though some two's were open.  Immediately, a ""server assistant"" offered various waters and menus, and let us know that he would be taking good care of us.  He had a nice sense of humor, didn't hover, but kept the table spotless and glasses filled.  The next visit was from John, the sommelier, who recommended a nice Spanish white wine and from overhearing various conversations with others around us, obviously knows his stuff.  Next up, our server was terrific and didn't miss an opportunity to explain, in detail, the night's offerings.  We were never left unattended or waiting for anything. From the Share menu, we started with the much-anticipated beet-infused salmon...amazing...and the European cheese plate.  The cheeses were arranged from mild to strong and were served with a dollop of mostarda (a tastier version of chutney or jam), which was the perfect accompaniment along with crispy toasts. Next, on to our Firsts--a lobster dish guaranteed to knock socks off and the seasonal ramps, which are always a very nice surprise and not seen on many menus.  The chef also included ramps in the amazing hot rolls that came served in a small iron baker.  I was only disappointed that I couldn't sneak out with a whole bag full of those rolls and a couple of the cute iron bakers as well. For our Seconds or main courses, we chose Snapper and Branzino, with both fish cooked to perfection and accompanied by sauces that made me strongly consider licking the plates.  Almost shamelessly, we also ate two desserts--the chocolate bread pudding and caramelized citrus with goat cheese/coconut ice cream--and finished the meal off with glasses of champagne and cups of espresso. All of the dishes we ordered were very complex and show that Chef Bryan Moscatello really knows his way around the kitchen.  Some of the components were surprising together--think beets and salmon or chocolate with rye crumbles.  But the combinations were genius over and over again, and all evening long. Other reviewers have mentioned the robust noise level, but that was not our experience.  Conversation was not even remotely challenging, nor did the noise level even enter our minds.  Also, it's important to say that the restaurant is completely spotless and gleaming, and with just the right urban/hip vibe for the neighborhood.  I almost want to hope that the restaurant retains the not-quite-yet-discovered feel, but that would be selfish and completely unfair to this group of fellows, who did everything to provide us with a perfect evening...except drive us home and tuck us in.     The Storefront Company is a real find, with nicely-sized, reasonably priced and satisfying portions, great ambiance, a show-stopper of a chef and fine management team.  You can bet we'll return again...and often!",0.9969,0.793,0.171,0.036,0.5914431486880466

2013-03-16,4.0,"I had been wanting to try this place since they opened last year and was excited to try it out.  On first impression, ambiance was great.  Loved the decor, very   modern, sleek with a lot of white and black.   Moving onto the food.  Our waiter was attentive,  but not hovering which I appreciated.  We stared with the American cheese plate, which had a side of a nicely prepared pear, walnut compote and another side of an orange sponge.  (More like an emulsion). Very good.  Then our server brought out the BEST hot, buttery rolls.  They came in a little cast iron tray with 6 small rolls.  In the middle of each roll was a garlic butter spread.  I could have eaten all 6! For our main meal we ordered the hen of the woods mushrooms, antelope, beef, and the rabbit.  The mushroom dish was excellent. Crispy mushrooms over a potato purée. The rabbit was tender and succulent, however the one lonely ravioli that came with it, was watery and bland.  The antelope was tough and chewy, not sure if this is the way antelope is supposed to taste...?  However, the elderberries and endive that graced the plate to accompany the antelope was excellent.  It gave the meat a sweet note to the otherwise rather boring piece of meat.  The beef dish was your typical beef and potatoes dish, solid but not the best cut of meat I've ever eaten.   Dessert was just ok as well.  We tried three different desserts.  The first was a grapefruit sorbet with fresh grapefruit pieces on top and a granola crumble, however there was no sweetness to the granola.  The chocolate dish was my least favorite.  It was very bland and had an anise flavor, which I did not enjoy.  The third dish was good.  It was a citrus cake that was done very well.  Perfect balance of sweet, but not sickeningly so.   Another highlight to me (besides the bread!) was they gave us each house made chocolate macaroons when we were leaving!  Also, the manager that night was extremely friendly and hospitable.  I really wanted to love this place and would be willing to give it another go...maybe sit at the chefs table and watch all the action in the kitchen!  I know they take pride in the presentation of each dish, as it comes  artfully arranged. Whoa!  I had to upgrade my review to 4 stars!  Just had my homemade chocolate macaroon, which they sent home with me.  OMG!  Best I've ever had!  Crisp exterior with a soft, chocolaty center.   Definitely worth going back just for that!",0.9981,0.724,0.222,0.054,0.5138986354775831

2013-03-07,5.0,"Store Front Company had just come onto our radar and we were looking for something fairly local and thought to give it a shot.  The menu looked intriguing - interesting dishes, well presented.  First of all, it's a great space, described by my dining partner as ""something you'd want your house to look like and something I'd hate"". Anyway, I did like the space, and  did kinda want my house to look like this although it could've been a restaurant in say Copenhagen. The food was original, well seasoned, paired carefully and well presented. Started with the Foie gras bombe, brioche crisps, blueberry, lemongrass, thyme.  The foie gras was made into a mouse that was suitably rich, the brioche crisps light but sweet. I had the lamb meatballs, a really generous portion of five good meatballs, perfectly cooked, a little medium in the center and well seasoned seasoned, just a little bit of currants (for sweetness) and pine nuts (for crunch), topped with a dash of creamy goat ricotta, and a little heat on the red pepper sauce. A nice fresh dish of lobster wrapped in sushi thin avocado and dotted with grapefruit gelee with crunchy bread chards.  Although tasty, with good balance, not sure I'd necessarily order this one again. Hen of woods mushrooms, earthy, extremely well cooked they gave a nice crunch as you bit into them, lightly mashed potatoes, chives (which were swiftly removed) and fresh anise. This dish was a real highlight, perfectly cooked rabbit loin, well seasoned, moist, the rabbit leg (underneath the noodles) moist, rich almost like a duck confit, also the duck offal was deep fried in a light batter (tasting like chicken livers), the jus was light, well salted and combined well with the rabbit leg and perfectly al dente noodles.  There's a lot going on in this dish, it all worked, well seasoned, tasty and executed. This was definitely a dessert on the lighter side, light, fluffy lemon cake, topped with fresh blackberries, butter cream, thyme curd (the green dolops) and  honey tuile (the crisp wafer you see on top).",0.9983,0.721,0.266,0.013,0.5824263038548751

Inside decor is very nicely decorated, sharp place.  Service was good. Food: Of the 6 starters, they were out of 2, which included the pastry basket. Which I'd heard good reviews about, so was disappointed. Really, out of 2 of the 6...bad start. Juice was very fresh and tasty. We had the cheese biscuits, which were very good. Then the skillet with antelope meat that they offer, then the burger with the pork belly on it. Both were flavorful, just wasn't expecting the skillet to be so tiny. We also had a side of the hash browns to share, with were VERY small, sharable if you want a couple bites. We order a starter, two ""entree"" type dishes and a side of hash browns to share. The food was flavorful but VERY small portions. I guess I had never experienced ""tasting"" type dinning at breakfast/brunch so was a little more thrown off. If you are looking for a filling, indulgent breakfast, this is not the place. I expected the main entree to be bigger in size, even though I had read it was small portions. Didn't think it was THAT small! Maybe I expected a little more for the money, especially since the dishes didn't come with any type of sides (like potatoes or toast), and buying separate adds up significantly when the one ""main small plate"" is like $12.",0.895,0.907,0.077,0.016,0.5381666666666668

2013-01-02,1.0,"The rating alone should indicate our feelings on our first visit to Storefront.  I waffled between 1 and 2 stars, but ultimately decided that our entire New Year's Eve dinner was a failure. I get that the NYE seatings can be a bit more ""generic"" due to the volume and overall stress the kitchen and waitstaff endure during a service of this kind.  As a waiter for years, I remember the intensity of those evenings. Unfortunately, the madness took over at Storefront on 12/31/12 for the 7pm seating. We arrived about 5 minutes early, and the hostess was quite pleasant and whisked us directly to our table, which was in an ideal spot.  My wife and I were already getting the ""this feels like it's going to be great"" vibes from minute 1.  That was the last moment we'd feel like this was worth the trip. Our waiter was a very pleasant gentleman who was able to articulate the menu well, and, for the most part, did a good job.  It was VERY slow at the end of service, but he seemed a bit overwhelmed with a few tables that appeared to be disputing a bill OR verbalizing their displeasure with the food.  If it was the latter, I'd have agreed completely.   The first course was a hen egg ravioli with truffle and cauliflower foam.  The pasta was rigid from being overcooked, and the egg was literally dried out from overcooking.  My wife's was slightly better, but not by much.  The whole dish (and meal to come, as you'll read) was absurdly ""one note"" Second course.  My wife got the Turbot, and I got the Smoked Oyster ""shooter"".  The Turbot was flat out terrible.  It was sliced far too thick and had a meaty, outrageously fishy taste.  It was NOT good fishy, like some great turbot is.  It was gross.  Sorry; that's the truth. My oyster dish was terrible as well.  No smoke flavor at all, and the pork was dry and chewy.  Again, the whole dish just tasted like a mediocre diner chowder.  I almost never find anything to gripe about with oysters, but this was the worst oyster dish I've ever had. Next came our entrees:  my wife had the pheasant with foie, and I had the lamb.  Let me say this: the lamb was the undisputed champion of the meal.  The meat was cooked perfectly medium rare, and the rest of the dish melded well with the protein.  It was the only dish that both of us rated as ""quality to be expected from a restaurant of this caliber"". The pheasant was a bit raw in the middle, but I didn't so much mind that.  It was the...presentation.  It was a GIANT beige ball.  No color at all.  The sight of the dish made it unappetizing.  My wife couldn't get over it.  I ate about half of it before discarding the rest to the bus boy.  While edible, the pheasant wasn't even close to what I'd expect from this place. Finally (thank god) we got our dessert, which I found rather lovely, but, again, the textures really turned off my wife (as I can imagine it did for others as well).  I ""got it"" more or less.  It was a passion fruit cheesecake ball that kind of resembled a hard boiled egg (again, kind of a weird ""look"" for a dessert).  The gelatin was divine, but hardly made up for the numerous errors. Finally, they did serve a portion of their house made bread, covered in truffle and served with black sea salt butter pyramid.  Fabulous.  I could eat about 5 of those.  Unfortunately, we didn't come to Storefront for bread. The service was acceptable, the decor was acceptable, the food was terrible.  We very regrettably, will not return.",0.9956,0.741,0.163,0.096,0.580814452214452

I went to Storefront last night to celebrate a friend's birthday. I had really high hopes, having had brunch there a few weeks ago & we really enjoyed it. The food that morning was fresh & delicious & the cheese biscuit was to die for. My party of 10 had reservations at 8. The place was a normal busy for a Saturday night. After sitting there for probably 45 minutes, we finally got someone to take our drink & appetizer order (only after I said something). Drinks came about 15 minutes later. About a half an hr later, we asked where the food was & were tiold it was coming. We asked for more flat crisps or bread, only to be told that bread was a 'between course' but we could have it if we insisted. Pretty snarky but we got that to be delivered  Our appetizers came about 15 minutes later (it's 9:45 mind you). We scarfed those down - great lamb meatballs, cheese plate, squash dish, so-so scallops.  Our entrees followed at 10:30. I repeat-10:30. We were all literally ready to eat our arms, so much so that there was not much conversation. I had the venison (delicious) & friends had the beef, duck, mushroom main course, etc. all agreed the food was great- we were all just so tired at that point.  Glasses of prosecco & a small birthday cake came at the end. We were told that we wouldn't be charged for the meatballs, cheese, or cake & prosecco (um, we didn't order the prosecco). I thought the offer was cheap. All of us left by 11:30. This was not a 3 1/2 hour dinner that we intended.  It was forced on us & I think that's obnoxious.  I'd return perhaps, but I think the place needs to do some serious fine-tuning of its service. There are so many places to try out there, that missteps like is can be costly.",0.9689,0.814,0.121,0.065,0.49668091168091166
2012-10-23,5.0,"Such deliciousness.....We went in for Sunday brunch only because it was the only place open, so glad we did. Love the styling of this place. Mostly white, very clean lines, nice accents. Our waitress was very helpful, and attentive.  And the food. We started w/ the homemade pastry basket. Every little bite that came w/ that was butterly and flakey and delicious. Next came the Blue Crab Omelette for me, and the Farm Eggs any style for my husband. He very much enjoyed his meal. I loved the light pieces of crab in my omelette, though I had 2 problems w/ it: 1) the marscapone that the crab was tossed in was a bit much. It was like having too much mayo on a sandwich. 2) No where does it says that there is caviar on that dish, but it was there. As much as I push myself to try new things, it was very offputting. Thankfully, our waitress recommended that we get the cheddar biscuits. They made everything right in the world again. So good. Overall, a great experience.

2012-10-20,5.0,"Well thank goodness the completely disinterested door dudes at Piece told us the wait was 45 min and there was no room at the bar -- at 6:30 on a Friday evening.  I was hosting friends from Colorado and wanted to show them more than Wicker Park ennui. We strolled up Milwaukee and a white store front caught our eyes.  A brief stop to scan the window menu and this friendly, charming man steps out to invite us in.  First he introduced himself as Johnny, with a handshake, and then looked me in the eye and told me this was a great place for dinner.  I was skeptical, concerned about the prices given the uber-upscale decor.  But his vibe was totally normal and comfortable, not at all pretentious.   I am so glad we went in!  The food was superb, the service was the most attentive I've ever had, and my girlfriends and I had a truly wonderful experience.  They were impressed with their Chicago dining experience, and I felt like the luckiest host ever. It's true that the meals aren't the size of Cheesecake Factory's.  I'm a healthy eater and I found the portions satisfying without making me feel stuffed.  I had salmon that was perfectly medium rare.  The accompaning veggies seemed more decorative than ""servings"" -- which made me slow down and focus on taste rather than shoveling them in.  Absolutely delicious. The chocolate ganache dessert was so rich we split it three ways....though I would have gladly eaten it all myself! Finally, sweet Johnny who invited us in delivered complimentary dessert drinks with a smile, thanking us for trying out their still-new restaurant.  Then we met the chef as we put on our coats.  AND the hostess gave us little favors of chocolate marcaroons to take home!  My guests thought I must have known the owner or something.   Did I mention I was in jeans?  With no reservations?  I hope you have as wonderful an experience as we did.  I can't wait to go back.",0.9978,0.73,0.241,0.029,0.6458730158730158
2012-10-15,3.0,"NOTE: This review is only for brunch.  They currently only offer brunch on Sundays. I liked the black and white minimalist decor. I also liked the service. As for the food, the jury's still out. We started with the pastry basket -- housemade minis that included a chocolate croissant, blueberry/ginger muffin, cheese danish, pound cake, peach cobbler muffin.  There were about 8 pieces (each piece maybe 2 bites).  Definitely shareable amongst 2-4 people depending on how much you like pastries.  For me, I probably could have polished them all off myself. These were probably the highlight of the meal. Everything following was... good enough. BF ordered the hash, as per usual (their version was a pastrami hash and eggs).  This dish was... elementary to best describe it.  Flavors, presentation -- all very ordinary.  I, as per usual, ordered something sweet -- the lemon ricotta pancakes. While they were tasty enough, I feel like they were overcooked. I've had lemon ricotta pancakes that were heavenly and custard-like.  The syrup served with it is more like a raspberry glaze. I actually enjoyed the tartness of the raspberry, but combined with the lemon, it all ended up being too tart.  It would have been nice to have some sort of whipped cream to accompany the dish like a mascarpone. I'm still willing to give Storefront another chance for dinner, but for brunch there are better places in Bucktown.",0.979,0.857,0.143,0.0,0.5601449275362319

2012-10-06,4.0,"I'm surprised so many people had a bad experience here because mine was quite the opposite.  We didn't have reservations and the place was pretty packed when we walked in, but luckily they had room at the kitchen counter, which really was a treat to sit by and I'm glad we ended up sitting there then anywhere else. At the kitchen counter you have a nice view into the kitchen and you can watch one of the chefs plate up the desserts and prepare the bread. The bread that we received was delicious- the perfect mix of soft & crunchy, garlic-y. I could have done without the extra kick of salt, but I've been noticing that bread with a salt sprinkle has become a bit of a trend in some of the newer restaurants. Though we didn't opt to have dessert the plates the chef was plating looked great- it really is an art form. For all of those complaining about the wait time, yes fine this is not the place to go if you are in a hurry but if you want a meal with thoughtful preparation and presentation this is the place for you. I think too many people are used to fast food joints and '30 mins or less or your money back' guarantees.  As far as the rest of the meal I ordered the corn tortellini which was great. The pasta was cooked perfectly and the cherry foam sauce was just the right amount of sweet and tart. I had asked for the chicken cracklings on the side because I am pescatarian but my boyfriend wanted to try them. When i received the dish it had cracklings sprinkled on top, but the waiter quickly replaced my dish, 3 different people came over to apologize AND they comped my meal. If that isn't service I don't know what is. From the moment we walked in everyone from the hostess to the servers to the chefs were extremely nice and helpful. The chef behind the counter didn't mind we asked questions and was very sweet.  My boyfriend ordered the lamb and our friend ordered the chicken. They joked they could eat their meals in just a few bites because the portions are small. However, at the end of the meal all three of us were full. We also ordered a bottle of wine which was also great.  The interior is done in black and white. I found it to be very clean, modern and inviting.   All in all this is a great place with solid food & spectacular service. I would definitely recommend trying it.",0.9988,0.768,0.224,0.009,0.594363354037267

2012-10-01,3.0,"We came here because I had a Gilt City coupon for brunch. We had the salmon, fried rice, and souffle pancake, plus a side of home cured pork belly.  The cured salmon was different, not as salty. The cream cheese was more whipped than normal cream cheese, and no there's no capers, they had sweet fennel jam. So the whole thing was kind of on the sweet side, and definitely very unique.  Fried rice was overly salty. We ate it all, but again, very very salty.  Souffle pancake was good, very fluffy. But maybe I am just too old school, I like maple syrup with my pancakes, and the raspberry syrup was just not hitting the spot, and it taste kind of vinegary.  The home cured pork belly was the best thing we've had. Highly recommend.  One complaint--the coupon also included bottomless mimosas. After we done eating, the waiter immediately delivered check. I understand my husband and I can sometimes drink a lot, but we only had two glasses each, and that's a rarity for my husband. So to the waiter: at least have the curtsey to ask ""is there anything else you would like"" before you put down the check and walk away without saying anything. Being a b00ch as I was sometimes, of course I'd get another round of mimosas AFTER that. I was shameless.",0.9656,0.864,0.109,0.027,0.5730994152046783
2012-10-01,3.0,"Yeah....I think Storefront has a few kinks it needs to work out before I make a return trip. We came in on a Saturday night at 9pm. The restaurant is nicely decorated, minimalist, and comfortable.  Our server was very nice, but I think she was the only server working the floor on a Saturday night. Sometimes she was attentive and sometimes she just got super busy and it would take a long time, like to give our order or get the check. Other yelpers are right, the portions are TEENIE TINY. Now you should know, Storefront focuses on the whole ""deconstructed"" food concept.  I generally am ok with this, but per my review of Graham Elliott (scathing...ouch), it drives me nuts if its deconstructed but has no point or doesn't actually taste good. The food has to have flavor people!  I just felt there was a general identify crisis at Storefront. The food had zero flavor and for many things, I was confused why they put them together in the dish.   For example - we ordered the lobster roll - this was total baby food...MUSH FEST 2012. There was nothing to chew and it was one note of mush mayo avocado. There was a nice grapefruit flavor but I couldn't get past the texture. Next we ordered the lobster meatballs. These are GOOD. They are the saving grace I think of the dining experience.  Thank God. Order these if you go. I ordered the Barrimundi and my husband ordered the Rabbit.  Rabbit good. Barrimundi bad.  The Rabbit had great mushroom flavor, delicious home made pappardelle noodles, good portion size and well cooked rabbit.  The Barrimundi tasted like nothing - it had a soggy sad skin, and tuna ravioli with it...huh? Why? Here's a side of tuna with your fish...awesome. I could have much more enjoyed some veggies or something.  Apparently there is a foam and a Marcona Almond something or other, but a couple dots of white sauce on a place to me is nothing to get excited about.... We tried to smile our way through dinner and make the most of it, but it just wasn't that good. Storefront could tell we weren't in love and I give them major props for asking us what we didn't like and trying to make us happy.  Given the restaurant is still relatively new, I am optimistic that perhaps in time they'll find their stride.",0.985,0.748,0.159,0.093,0.5703161179905367

They need to dim the lights and give it some ambiance.  Overall there are so many great restaurants in Chicago that it would be a tough call to go back.  However, again, Jessica was awesome and right on, she may be the only reason I would return.  Too costly for what you get.",0.9331,0.806,0.139,0.055,0.5937728937728937

2012-09-16,5.0,"I had my birthday dinner at Storefront Company last night.  It was just about the most memorable meal I have had in a long time.   The service was the very best I have had in Chicago.  Very high level of service and restaurant protocol, without feeling practiced and stuffy.  The waiters knew the menu inside and out, and were able to describe the nuances to a tee. The portions were perfect.  you were able to enjoy and appreciate the flavors in each dish - and the presentation was perfect.  artfully done, without being too constructed.  You didn't feel as though you were desecrating the dish by enjoying what was on it.  I chose the hen of the woods mushroom main course.  Each bite was Ecstasy.. a smokey, roasted flavor with a salty herby balance.  I actually wanted to eat it slowly, with the balance of a perfect syrah(by waiter's recommendation).  I was eating it even too slowly to savor each bite... I haven't had a dish that made me slow down to that degree in a very long time.  My dinner partner had the skate wing - enhanced with meyer lemon sauce and a frisee salad.  wow.  the meaty fish was substantial, moist and more flavorful than I have had skate prepared since I lived in France. I frustrated myself because upon sitting down, I immediately ordered my usual whiskey aperitif.  I didn't realize they had such a selection of artisan cocktails!  But, the good thing is I can go back and have another meal. Storefront Company is a great reason to dine in Chicago.  I am from San Francisco, and I can't wait for all my food snob friends to come visit so I can show off the fabulous food... And I didn't even mention the decor!!!  beautiful!  The mural is museum worthy and elegant.  They can release their playlist and I would happily play it during every dinner party I throw at home.

2012-08-22,3.0,"the atmosphere/decor is like restoration hardware meets pottery barn. i'm not even mad. the service is a bit overzealous but i imagine this is due to it being a new restaurant and still working out the pacing. we went here for dinner and were promptly sat. there are complimentary crackers and butter, which i would advise against eating. the butter is fine but the crackers are obnoxiously hyper-aggressively salted. we ordered: - european cheeses (only the bleu cheese was memorable, others were so-so) - heirloom tomatoes (simply scrumptious!) - red and greens (we couldn't even finish this dish - no real thought put into it) - hen of the woods mushroom (extremely well done, worthy) at some point, the baker sent out a ramekin of garlic-y bread to each table, which was subtly tasty and filling til our next dish. since the pacing of the dishes rolled were off, we consumed two drinks apiece before we were served our first course. (the cocktails and the menu were stellar!) still not mad about having a buzz before eating but still uncommon to occur considering the restaurant was not busy. overall, a solid place to go to in wicker park. but i will warn that it's definitely a bit on the pricey side to not be blown away by... p.s. the memorable touch was the bag of madeleine cookies the host handed to you as you left the restaurant. i'm eager to come back and try the brunch menu. well done, storefront. i hope the place only gets stronger with time.",0.9701,0.84,0.121,0.039,0.49888969055635723

2012-06-18,5.0,"Stopped in on a whim this past Saturday and loved it. I prefer to eat at bars, and as luck would have it there was one seat available. I ordered their new fashion which was fantastic. The bourbon is the centerpiece of the drink which is a must in bourbon cocktails,and the fruit is introduced by adding a layer of orange and cherry infused foam atop the bourbon. Next I ordered the tuna tartar with clam mousse and pumpernickel crostini. The tuna had a sensational cool to it that fell into perfect harmony with the salted crostini. I actually had to stop writing for a moment because I  was mentally transported back to that first bite of tuna. It felt like a torrent of an ice cold mountain spring running through my mouth. Next I had the barramundi with tuna dumplings. They seared the seabass which allowed the natural butteriness of the fish to come forth and shine. With each bite my mouth was enveloped by a voluptuous form of savor that I cherish in a good fish dish. To answer that savor you have a bite of these magnificent little tuna dumplings that appeared to be accented with fresh ginger and mint. The dumpling refreshes your whole mouth and you're prepared for the next bite of that sumptuous seabass. My entire meal was an absolute joy and the service was equally agreeable. My server was incredibly knowledgable, approachable, and a great companion to experience food and drink with. Overall the restaurant seemed to exude a sense of casual stylishness that makes you feel like you're in just the right place, and from the first bite to the last that feeling is confirmed.

We ordered European Cheeses Asparagus Puree Albacore Tuna Tartar Rolled Lobster Lamb Store Front Company says they are about ""modern farm cuisine"".  I'd say it's an accurate description.  Nothing is overly seasoned and although I'm sure the prep requires a lot of work, it is very subtle and the flavors of the proteins somewhat speak for themselves.  All of the food was good and the lamb was cooked very well - a medium rare was actually medium rare, unlike many places where they end up cooking it too much.  The rolled lobster is delicious and fresh tasting but quite small.   The staff was very attentive and nice.  It can be a bit pricey if you want to be full, but I'll be back and do recommend it.  A good place for a date, special occasion or any other reason.",0.974,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5287460317460319

2012-05-01,2.0,"Let's play a game-- I'll describe some features of a restaurant and you decide whether it's a casual or an upscale place. First up, a restaurant which is self-described as a ""modern farm cuisine"" restaurant with a ""neighborhood feel"". About half of the restaurant is a bar, the other half is either communal, high-top or banquette seating. They heavily promote their brunch business, and for dinner you're encouraged to start your meal with ""shared"" plates before moving on to entrees like ""amish chicken"" or ""the whole hog"". Clearly that place is pretty casual, right? Next, a restaurant where the greeter asks to check your coats before seating, and asks if you'd like to have a drink at the bar while your table is prepared (even though you're early for your reservation and the place is empty). The room is entirely black and white, and super modern in appearance. Upon seating, you're asked if you would like sparkling or still water before they send over the sommelier. They stress that the menu is meant to be experienced as a structured three-course meal, and request that you place your table's entire order at once. The food is delicate, with artistic platings, small portions and high prices. Now, clearly I'm describing an upscale restaurant. How about a place where some staff members walk around wearing a tuxedo from the waist up, and jeans from the waist down? Or where the floors are so thin that any time someone walks within 10 feet of a table, it shakes so hard that the silverware rattles together and full glasses of water spill over? These things don't belong in any type of restaurant. Unfortunately, Storefront Company is all three of the above (and that's not a good thing). I don't think they have any idea what kind of place they want to be, and it shows. The whole experience felt a little uncomfortable and awkward. When we first walked in, the entire staff was mingling in the corner chatting and we weren't sure if the place was even open. Our server wasn't very informative and provided very little help in deciding what to order. My expectations of the cuisine were pretty high based on Chef Moscatello's resume and the food photos they've been posting online-- I would have forgiven all the restaurant's issues if the food had delivered. Unfortunately again, most of the food was forgettable and overpriced. Meatballs were flavorful but overcooked to death, falling to pieces as you picked them up. The blue cheese course also had great flavors, but the proportion of cheese to the accompanying sorbet, fennel and pancetta was way off. The quail course was probably the best we had-- the various quail preparations were delicious but the polenta had a bizarre, airy texture. The duck and lamb entrees were beautiful plates but nothing more, not bad but definitely not worth returning for. Finally, the pear dessert was far too light and subtle to finish the meal with. Our meal at Storefront Company was unsatisfying and a poor value, especially for the neighborhood. I don't often regret trying out new restaurants, but in this case I honestly wish we had just gone a couple doors down and gotten a pizza instead.",0.9839,0.82,0.119,0.061,0.5817179962894249
2012-04-30,2.0,"Too many little incongruities for any more than three stars.  While the food here was solid, there are a myriad of other places in Chicago...heck even in Wicker Park...putting out the same quality.  The service here, on the other hand, leave a bit to be desired.  Let me just point out a few. 1) It shouldn't take 20 minutes to get 3 cocktails at 6pm.  The place was only 1/3rd full and I have no idea what was going on.   2) When you break your cocktail menu up by shaken, stirred, poured and the Martinez is under the stirred section don't serve me a shaken Martinez.  If you don't make your menu pretentiously arranged then I can't complain...but you did, so I will. 3) Don't recommend three of the priciest reds when we all ordered fish.  Seems like a double whammy of un-stellar service. 4) When I ask via twitter in the morning what is good to have that evening and you respond with a recommendation it would be nice to actually have that on the menu as recommended.  Not with a major change in the components of the dish.  While I understand changes need to be made, the PR team and the kitchen should be on the same page.

Four of us visited Storefront Company for brunch this weekend and we were very happy by the end of the meal (well, let's be honest, we were happy the second we walked in).  We had walked by a few weeks ago around dinner time and found that the restaurant was packed, so we didn't try it.  Upon finding out there was a brunch menu, we decided to stop in. The restaurant was relatively empty for an early-ish brunch...I know...I know, those in the area might not be getting up quite so early to eat on the weekends...that's fine, more food for me!   The room is wonderful - I remarked that it would be wonderful for a wedding or a shower of some sort.  It's white, but not stark, with nice lighting, very pretty flowers on the tables and a feeling of warmth even though the color scheme wouldn't at first indicate this.  I also love the black tiled wall near the bar - a nice touch. We were warmly greeted by an exceptionally friendly server.  I will say that it is not my style to bring coffee into a restaurant, but I had nowhere to ditch the dregs of my latte, so I had to bring it in...they were really friendly about it - even offering me a mug instead of my paper cup!  I don't recommend bringing coffee in - please don't, but thanks to the server for being awesome about it. The menu was hard to plan around because there were so many delicious sounding options.  I tried the lamb burger and the two eggs any style.  The burger was heavenly!  The eggs were good, though regular..though, the butter dish...wow...a little flower cut-out with honey in the middle.  Pretty and delicious! The drink selection is really unique, and looks quite fun.  Many of the options had meat and cheese, or other tasty treats included.   So..for brunch, food was a 4 (just somewhat sad about the normal-ness of the eggs, though it's my own fault...also, portion sizes weren't consistent).  Service was a 5.  Atmosphere is also a 5.  The bathrooms...a 5...very sleek and clean.  And to value...a 4.  It's very reasonable for most of the food, though some items are pricey.  The drinks seem a bit expensive as well.   I did take a peek at the dinner menu - I'm not a big fan of tarragon or fennel and that seems to be quite hot right now, so I'm going to wait until the menu hopefully changes for summer.  Also, the dinner menu is really pricey. Overall, really great.  I plan to be back for brunch and also for a drink at the bar.   Also, cheers to our server and the bartender (owner?manager?) who sent us over mimosas just to be nice!!!  p.s. the watermelon one..unique and delicious!

It started off with the drinks, probably waited a good 15 min which is unusual when you just order a glass of wine and beer!  Food took forever to come! One of the items we ordered The Hog, that we saw good reviews on was in my opinion overly exaggerated! Not much to rave about and I absolutely love pork! Food was definitely on the smaller portion side.. it didn't matter which course you ordered - Share, First or Second! The dishes I can boast about and would order again are:  Quinoa fries - delicate, flavorful however the Madeira granita tasted very much like curry Pork cheek hash - hands down the best dish of our meal!! Portion size was actually good.   Also on the upside, our server was very nice and he provided us with complimentary glasses of wine since we were waiting so long for our food to come.

Right off the bat we were treated like VIPs.  We were greeted by the sommelier, Steve, who took our reservation and was kind enough to email me the tasting menu the day of (it changes daily) and the chef.   The food was amazing.  We did the chef's tasting menu ($49 for 5 courses, plus we got one bonus dish!).  You can add wine pairings (5 wines) for $29.  Here's what we had in order of yumminess: -6 hour deviled egg with potato crema and caviar - the chef explained this was something he was ""toying with"".  The toying is over, it should be on the menu STAT!  I have never tasted such delicious deviled eggs, my friend correctly judged it as ""I could order a dozen of these"".  Indeed.   -lamb bucco - I am not the biggest fan of lamb, but when this enormous shank came out with a stripe of polenta and tiny roasted onions, I was all in.  It literally fell off the bone and was perfectly moist and smoky. -kuna bay salmon - flaky and delicious salmon, accompanied by cauliflower puree with brussel sprout leaves and pine nuts made a great marriage of flavors.  -confections - we sat overlooking  the dessert chef working her magic, so we were really looking forward to our dessert.  It came in the form of 6 sweets.  The coconut crème chocolates were to die for.  She said ""those are our booziest desserts"".  That explains everything!  They tasted like vacation.  The passionfruit chocolates were intense and delicious.  Blood orange was featured in both the jelly candy and the macaroons.  Mascarpone and white chocolate were good and we were mixed on the cherry filled chocolate (I liked it, my friend did not).  -cucumber panna cotta with pickled shallots - ok, I thought panna cotta was an icky dessert, but served as an appetizer, it was a refreshing foamy cream I wish I could say I loved the rabbit mignon, because this was the dish I was most excited about, but it was all wrong.  It's rabbit with all it's parts, which was new for me: the heart was chewy, the kidney was squishy and the liver had a horribly dense texture.  I'm a fan of foie gras, so I'm surprised I hated rabbit liver so much, but I had to choke it down.  The mignon and sirloin were ok, but the truffles weren't truffle-y enough and the egg noodles were kind of disappointing.  Really, it was the only failure of the night, so I took off  1/2 star. A note about service.  As I said, it was very attentive.  We were asked several times by several people how everything was (it was actually a little overwhelming).  Also, the courses came out really slowly, but we were enjoying our leisurely conversation so it was fine.  They definitely treat you like a star, when I got up front my seat, my napkin was replaced by a fresh one.  Schmancy! I'd love to come back to Storefront for the regular menu!",0.9937,0.747,0.167,0.086,0.6061104651268585
2012-03-25,5.0,"My husband and I just returned home from an early dinner there and we cleaned our plates from appetizer to dessert.  We ordered the quinoa fries and they were delicious.  We ordered the romaine and red & green salad; both had good flavors.  My husband loved his beef loin and I liked the monkfish.   It was tender and I liked the pairing with fried rice.  Both entrees' flavor and texture were excellent.  I liked the parsnip cake with cheese cake ice cream better than the mango/ginger sorbet---the ginger was a little strong for me, but I still enjoyed the flavors.  We will return and try the brunch and perhaps, the kitchen tasting menu.",0.9596,0.805,0.195,0.0,0.6309523809523808
2012-03-24,5.0,"This place was all around great. The food was excellent. We tried a bit of everything from the shared plates, cheeses, firsts, seconds and dessert. Nothing disappointed. We especially liked the quinoa fries, pork cheek hash, rabbit rossini and beef loin. Our waiter (Wesley) was excellent as well, very attentive. They even gave us 'goodie bags' when we left with cookies in them. Definitely recommend this place for a nice dinner.",0.9719,0.661,0.304,0.035,0.7777777777777778
2012-03-24,5.0,"Went to their inaugural  brunch this morning~  incredibly attentive staff, friendly, and very thorough.  The brunch menu is very accessible~ nothing too crazy~ and timing was great.  House made-hot sauce and ketchup were served with the meal and they were exceptional.  The aesthetic of the restaurant is fresh, bright & very appealing.  Will definitely be back.",0.9406,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.6170454545454546

2012-03-22,5.0,So I came here expecting good food. I was surprised because it was great. Ok. It was Thursday but still. Made a reservation with a friend at the kitchen counter. Their answer to a chef table. The lady in front of us made fresh bread and fresh chocolates. Wow.  The chef delivered our meal and it was ridiculously good. Each wine went with the food but each plate was incredible. Great presentation. Great taste.  I would tell you this place is real good. Take a date and impress. But you can also come during the week and have great food and not leave stuffed like a crapy restaurant. I left happy and content. Not bloated.  I'm a fan. Thank you.,0.9958,0.564,0.4,0.036,0.7071428571428572

2012-03-12,2.0,"I live a few doors up the street from Storefront and my wife and I were very excited about a new restaurant and hoping for great things.  Sadly, our first visit on Saturday evening was very disappointing.   The food came out very slowly - about 45 minutes for our canapé, and over an hour for our main course.  When it arrived, my wife's pasta was beyond al dente - it was actually still hard around the edges, and the dish was heavily over-salted so that no other flavors could be tasted.   My monkfish was bland and lacked the famous lobster-like texture that properly prepared monkfish boasts.  The pairing with a crispy short rib fried rice cake was interesting, but something of a miss in my opinion.  They were obviously meant to be eaten together but the chewy texture of the rice didn't work with the mostly mushy texture of the fish.  The monkfish should have been the star and would have been if it was prepared properly, whereas in this dish it almost seemed an afterthought.  THis is a guess and only a guess, but I would wager that it was previously frozen, thus the unsatisfying and unfamiliar texture. The service was reasonably good, although our server never came to check on our main course until it was time for the bill.  When we gave this feedback to the manager, she was very receptive and concerned about our experience.  Because of this, and the fact that Storefront is so close to our house, I will try it again in a month or two and see if their kitchen has been able to iron out the wrinkles.   On a positive note, the aesthetic is fantastic.  I'm a big fan of the black and white and every detail has been carefully and artistically executed.  The high-top tables along the front and the bar seating keep the restaurant feeling lively and not overly stuffy, while still remaining chic.  On atmosphere and aesthetic alone, I give this restaurant 5 stars.  Hopefully the kitchen will catch up.",0.983,0.852,0.115,0.032,0.5065714285714286
2012-03-11,5.0,"I went opening night and everything was flawless. Started with the quinoa fries and the albacore tuna tartar, both fantastic. The quinoa fries are amazing, just had to repeat that. Next we had the quail which was great. Also tried the lamb and the arctic char, both were fantastic. Claudia and Steve were great hosts, great opening night. As I left I saw their burger. It looked and smelled pretty great. I'll be back to try it soon.",0.9881,0.661,0.339,0.0,0.6416666666666667
2012-03-10,5.0,"Overall very impressed by the newest addition to the burgeoning Wicker Park dining scene. The menu was traditional American and approachable, while at the same time taking chances with unique base dishes and ingredient pairings. The standout was the lamb meatballs. I thoroughly enjoyed the overall ambiance and interior decor. Contemporary, superb design touches were a compliment to a very inviting atmosphere. The main wall mural brought the room together in an authentic way without being overwhelming. I will most definitely be returning back.",0.9664,0.772,0.228,0.0,0.5069444444444444
