OH HELL NO! so i march my cold ass back to the bouncer and ask why did they get to go in. his response, ""i dont know. the club is packed. dont worry about it. get back in line, no cuts"" so im passed annoyed and he gets annoyed with me not understanding how people who got here after us get in before us. so as childish as i can, i say ""im giving you a bad review on the internet and i'm going to make a dispute with my bank to get my money back"". his response ""its not my restaurant. do what you gotta do"".  oh really now? ok kudos to that girl for working her way inside the club after getting there after us. i am not mad at her, but the lack of answers for my reserved table was frustrating. so i march my defeated ass back in line and we eventually get in after waiting 30 minutes. can anyone explain to me how i reserve a table but we have to wait in line? 30 minutes? seriously? never again. i asked the hostess if our time would be extended since we were here and had to wait, she said she's sorry and she'll talk to our server. she never talked to our server. i talked to the server who responded with ""dont worry about it"". which was very true because after 12 we were done drinking anyway now for the decent news the food was ok, and came within a nice distance of each other. the inside employees were quick and polite enough for the occasion. no room to dance but i didnt want to anyway. we had to flag the waitress down as we think she tried to prevent us from getting our desserts. there's a bull but since we didnt leave until the club closed (or were kicked out actually) we never really got a chance to see anyone ride it. bathrooms were stocked. will i go back there? maybe, probably not. there's 1000 other places in chicago. the tres leches cake was DELICIOUS tho.  will i go back for nye? oh hell no! never. you would have to pay me, and more than $75 now for the icing on the tres leches cake: as my date and i were leaving the bouncer apologized to me! 3 hours later, guess he felt bad. but in the midst of his half hearted apology, he smacked my butt. im trying to convince myself it was an accident, a very deliberate, precise accident, where he aimed for the middle back but got lower back, dead on butt. it was an accident right? i did not get sexually harassed, right? no, of course not really wish i could rate 2.5 stars. 3 seems generous",-0.9928,0.778,0.079,0.143,0.4545953682019256

So I asked what's the point of a reservation and he told me it guarantees me not to wait in line but I have to wait for a table and that its first come first serve and that be books four parties a weekend so whoever get there first gets the table first and that the other parties have to wait for the other dinner reservations to be seated. So I told him that again your website is incorrect and that there should be some fine print explaining that. The man continued to over talk me and when I tried to ask a question he cuts me off and asked do you want to make a reservation or not. Then I told him a had a few questions and he speaks to me in a nasty tone and says ""go ahead finish what do you gotta ask me?"". I told him he didn't have to be so rude about the situation I was just trying to get some clarification on what he was explaining to me compared to what was advertised on the website. I also proceeded to tell him never mind I will not be making the reservations you have lost a customer and I will never dine in your establishment and he act like he didn't care. If this is how they treat customers then they don't need to be in business. My suggestion save your time and money and go someplace else",-0.3969,0.841,0.079,0.081,0.5552083333333332

On this particular Saturday afternoon my friends and I were greatly disappointed in our visit to Dos Diablos Mexican Restaurant. I will provide concrete examples to substantiate my one star rating. * No coffee was being served! * I ordered a breakfast burrito with half chicken and half chorizo. I was told that I could be charged an additional fee for the mixture of meat and then I was told, ""Sorry, we don't have any more chorizo"".  This is a MEXICAN restaurant. It's like going to an Irish pub that doesn't serve whiskey. Seriously.  * Chilaquiles are made with fresh tortillas that are cut and lightly fried. They are then covered in a savory green sauce and drizzled with cheese. The chilaquiles at DD should have just been called nachos. Imagine our horror when we received a plate of tortilla chips inconsistently dribbled in a discolored sauce. The so-called refried beans that were served alongside the chilaquiles were taken straight from a can. We know our Mexican food.  * The $16 steak and eggs plate was grossly overpriced and disappointedly under flavored.",-0.5672,0.846,0.068,0.086,0.4151515151515151

The chips were light, but too thin so they always fell apart in the salsa. I could stand for a little bit more a thicker chip, personally. We ordered the guacamole as our app. It said it was ""NOT SO HOLY"", but there was nothing sinful about it, sadly. It needed more salt, but to its defense, it was very fresh and chunky.

The flour tortillas were great, I think they are house made. The sides were beans, rice, guacamole and pico de gallo. I usually never touch the beans or rice but I decided to give them a try and I ended up finishing them all. The service was great, the chips and salsa were great. The manager (i think his name was tom or todd) came by to check on our table and was pretty cool.  The prices are what you can expect for anything on Hubbard. They food quality is definitely there. So to the cheap asses looking for a bargain- there are plenty of dive taco joints on Ashland.

2011-08-21,1.0,"A great place to get robbed and the staff not care. I'll explain... Rolled in here on a Thursday night and it was probably at about 30% capacity. Grabbed a place at the bar with some friends where there was almost no one sitting. There were 2 bartenders and they took quite a bit of time to come over and ask us what we wanted to drink. Drinks were decent enough. At one point our drinks sat empty for about 5 minutes, again at a nearly empty bar with 2 bartenders. And then two individuals, one male and one female pushed in between our group, which we found odd since the bar was largely empty. One of the people in our group felt her purse being moved around and when she turned, she found the female holding her wallet. The crooks handed it back to her and acted confused. When I informed the bartender that these 2 people had just pick-pocketed someone in our group, he looked at me, said ""Really?"" and shrugged. I figured he would have the security at the door stop them so we could call the police. Instead he just walked away. Poor service all around and a great place to go if you're interested in being robbed.",0.1444,0.837,0.074,0.089,0.428125

The food, to be completely honest, was just not good. I love Mexican food and I'm not picky, but I barely got through half of my plate. I had the ""Numero Cinco"" combination platter, which includes a chicken taco, a fish taco, and a chicken enchilada, which I switched out for a cheese enchilada. The only part I finished was the enchilada, only because I was so hungry, not because it was good. It all just lacked flavor and was all around pretty unappetizing. My friend had the chicken enchiladas and also only finished about half. Overall, really disappointing dinner and overpriced for the quality of food.

2011-07-17,5.0,"I don't typically give places 5 stars, but the owners here have created an all-out great place to eat.  We were staying in River North, and looking for a place within walking distance. My husband is a mexican food fanatic, so I knew any new mexican fare would be a good place to start. The outside appears to be a smaller joint, but once inside, it's a relatively large place (maybe 30 or more tables). it's dimly lit in red at night, with authentic sombreros, ornate lanterns and carved wood accents, so it can be quite romantic, but with two kids in tow, they were very happy with the whole experience. The two managers/owners were walking up and down by each table every few minutes, checking in on how things were, and management presence is a good sign. I had the impression that they take pride in their restaurant and an unhappy customer will always leave happy before it's over. The waitstaff work together to remove dishes, refill drinks, replenish chips, regardless if they are ""your"" server. They definitely catered to the kids (bringing them extra cherries for their kiddie cocktails, and making sure we were never out of salsa and chips, and very friendly with the girls.) The food was exceptional in my opinion, and I've definitely had my share of mexican food. The complimentary salsa and chips were a welcome site after working up an appetite sight-seeing. The salsa is a roasted pepper/chili base, served warm, and was on the mild side, but with just enough bite for me (I like my food milder than the rest of my family). The chips are very thin and crispy and easy to over indulge in! For drinks I ordered a tropical frozen margarita and he had domestic bottled beer (which very seldom was empty as they kept them coming.) We also ordered queso, and it was a nice compliment to the salsa. I ordered the three enchiladas (cheese) with sour cream sauce, only because I was sharing with the kids. My husband ordered steak fajitas, and they were both very tasty. The steak was charcoal grilled and extremely tender, well seasoned with onions and peppers, and we both had black beans and rice. The black beans were delicious as they were also mixed with onions and peppers into almost a thick soup consistency.  Overall, I would rate this one of THE BEST places for mexican in the Chicago area.

We had lunch at 1:00 pm, hoping to miss the bulk of the coupon-inspired frenzy.  When we arrived, there were about 5 or 6 people waiting in line to place take-out orders.  A manager was at the door passing out margarita samples (very tasty!) and apologizing for the wait, which I thought was a really nice gesture of appreciation during what had to have been one of their busiest days. When we announced that we had a reservation to dine in, we were immediately seated with menus, and served chips and salsa within minutes.  Our waitress came to table a few minutes after to take our order.  She asked us for our patience with the kitchen since the restaurant had been busy since the minute they opened their doors.  Her request for patience wasn't neccesary -- our food arrived about 15 minutes after we ordered it.  Perhaps we arrived at the restaurant just as they were catching up from the initial onslaught, which was good timing on our part.  But the communication was appreciated, and the staff should be commended for it. I thought they handled a difficult day very well. I had a combo - 2 chicken and 2 steak crispy tacos with rice and black beans.  The steak tacos were delicious; there was a nice char on the meat and good flavor.  The chicken tacos were a little bland for my taste, but I just added some salsa on them and was good to go.   As we finished our meal, a manager stopped by the table to ask if everything was good and if we needed anything else.

We sat down ordered some apps and more drinks and all came out fairly quickly.  However, as we're 3/4 done with our apps our waitress gets our entree orders, about 5-10 minutes after that about 6-7 of us need a new drink... wait... wait... wait some more finally one of my friends has to get her attention and she comes and takes her drink order and is about to leave without even checking with anyone else... so have to stop her again to order the remaining drinks.  Anyways entrees start coming out and we start eating... and as you read above we did ORDER our second round of drinks, but as I'm nearing halfway into my entree, it still not here.  My one friend gets hers... and we wave her down again to find out where the rest are... she says she brought them... sorry Sweetheart, not the case.  She finally goes and gets them and basically it was 45 minutes between our two drinks.  Ridiculous.  And so the reason I say they need more waitresses/waiters is because I counted only 3 taking orders, the rest were all the busboys doing the delivery, water, etc. They definitely need more wait staff.   Also, they never set our table with silverware for the proper number, and when they came to clean the appetizer dishes, they took the silverware and never replaced it. Had to ask for that as well. Anyways, as far as food try the Buffalo Chicken Nachos and the Carne Asada, give the grilled marinated chicken a shot as well.  Drink wise, try the El Diablo... very tasty and packs a punch.  But I probably won't be back here anytime soon, which is sad because I actually had some high hopes.",0.9867,0.843,0.116,0.041,0.5497311460469355

Let me start with what you did right, nay...what you did astounding well at: Macho Nachos. These might seem like your regular nachos, and when they arrive at your table you start piecing together the perfect bites with a bit of each of the toppings. But wait, just as you get through the toppings and first layer of chips...you realize there is an entire pool of nacho cheese patiently waiting for you at the bottom of the dish. And they are not stingy with this cheese. Some of my friends even took a spoon to it after all the chips had been devoured...and I high-fived them for it.  Another perk is their drinks are pretty tasty and strong. I also like the location and vibe of this place. It is not super obnoxious (i.e. going clubbin' feel) but you can still head here before a night out on the town.

It wasn't horrible, but with good Mexican food I eat until I am going to explode...and this place I just took a few bites and left it alone. I even tried about four different entrees and dessert...nothing to write home about.  * Our server was not Mr. Personality. We were a fun bunch of girls and trying to have a good time, and he wanted none of our banter.  * I think it was pricey considering the quality of the food.

I was attending a birthday party at Social 25 and in the winter, it's best to try to centrally locate all destinations for the evening. First of all.  I called for an 8:00PM reservation, which the person on the phone said they were entirely booked, how about 6:30, which I said no to and that I would go somewhere else unless they could get me in at 7:30 or 8. She offered 7:30. I took it. Got there a few minutes early and the place was literally empty. I noticed a lot of place play this game to try and fill crappy time slots that normally wouldn't be booked.  Oh we have reservations at 6:30 or 9:00, nothing in between.  Well, don't believe that, push for the time you want. Anyway, the house margaritas were weak and lacked a kick.  It was only three of us and we didn't finish the pitcher before switching to other drinks.  The Mojito was OK and the El Diablo was better than the house margarita, but still not great.  Limit 3? I highly doubt it.  Maybe for the girl who is out for her 21st birthday. Food was average, but the portions were generous.  Guac was bland and had large chunks of avocado that were flavorless.  Steak was cooked well and had good flavor, not excellent though.  Rice and beans were average, but I have had way worse.

Overall, I would say this place is a good choice if you are going somewhere in the area for the night and you don't want to deal with the people looking to be seen at local neighbors.

What is Mexican fare without a Margarita?  Boring!  So we started off with a round of the signature los diablos margarita. . ..the menu said there was a three-person limit so I expected it to blow me away.  I had two and not so much.  It was good but $12 good?  And I wasn't wobbly at all!  For my meal, I got the steak quesadillas and my pal had the taco salad.  The scary thing was that our food came out 5 minutes after we ordered it.  Not exaggerating - 5 minutes!  I mean, it is as though the quesadillas and salad were Big Macs and not made to order.  Do they have an assembly line back there.  That is just freaky!  All in all, the food tasted good and the ritas were solid but will I be back?  Nah, I probably won't be running.  For the price, I would eat elsewhere when I'm in that hood.",0.9878,0.783,0.173,0.043,0.42003205128205123

Dos Diablos is an attempt at a blend of authentic Mexican flavor and trendy urban appeal, yet falls shorter than you might expect after walking in the front door.  I, like a lot of people enjoy guacamole, and after seeing theirs advertised as the best in town, it was obvious as it which app I called out first. Sadly, however, it wasn't the best. It wasn't even close. I can't guarantee you I can name every ingredient they mashed together to pass off this green dip as the best guac in town, but I can guarantee you the cook who made it, didn't even taste it. It was void of seasoning and depth, but full of sadness and unkept promises.   Aside from the guac, my table enjoyed a very small, overpriced serving of chile con queso with beef pico de gallo. It was slightly spicy, well seasoned, and aside from being on the runny side, may have been the best thing I ate there. I had the lobster tacos for my main, and I honestly don't even know where to start. For 24 dollars I expect to see a little more than a pinch of lobster in three small tortillas, but alas I didn't win this round. On top of the lobster was mounds of undercooked small diced potatoes that completely took away from the dish. I haven't seen something so unnecessary on a plate in a long time. The tacos came with a pile of bland rice, so why more starch was loaded in the tacos is beyond me.  To wash this grub down, a pitcher of their el diablo margarita was in order. At 48 dollars for one margarita pitcher, you'd think it would be smooth, tasty, and strong. After tasting it, it was clear they accomplished the first too. It was a very good margarita, but it was lacking on the booze...48 dollar booze.  All in all, it cost 3 of us 197 bucks to eat at a casual Mexican restaurant for average drinks and substandard food.

Really thin chips that were not greasy and a salsa with just the right amount of heat. I wasn't drinking that night and stuck with water as did a couple of people seated down on my end.

No apology from the waiter. I'm not sure what's up with that?  The menu...nothing really stood out for me so I ordered the Southwest salad with chicken. I have to say it was delicious! The chicken was grilled and smokey and very moist and the salad dressing that comes with it...YUM! The other dishes around me did not look very appetizing and everyone said they were just okay.

However, I was the last to get my meal and it took about an extra 10 minutes after everyone was served for me to get mine. I'm pretty sure they forgot to make mine. My boyfriend had the Numbero Cinco #5 a Taco, Fish Taco and Enchilada and his was pretty blah too. The chips and salsa is pretty good, I do really like the chips and the salsa has more of a smoky taste to it. The place both times was pretty dead and I can see why. My boyfriend said he doesn't plan on going back. The quality of food that you are getting and the prices just don't match up! I spent $50 on lunch and that included 2 beers that were both $6! A Tecate should NEVER cost $6!!!! They definitely have some changes to make if they are going to compete with the other restaurants on Hubbard street.",0.9918,0.79,0.188,0.022,0.6295267489711933

I ended up here for a happy hour with co-workers, not by choice, and in fact most of us were trying to change venues, but we still ended up here.  Considering I heard terrible things about the food I pretty much expected to be going to a place that would make everyone regret eating the Queso the next day.  So with those expectations, I was in a good place because it truly delivered that.  Food that wasn't memorable.  There was a group of 9 of us and between us we split every taco platter except for the shrimp.  Out of the beef, chicken, fish and lobster taco the only one that was decent was the lobster.  But eat one too many and you may be questioning your decision.   Although the food was nothing worth writing about, the drinks on the other hand were decent and really that's what earned the extra star.  If you like sweeter drinks where you can't taste the alcohol then you want the My Maria, but if you're like me and like stiff old man drinks then get the Red Devil.  It makes up for the inconsistent food.  If you want good drinks and really good food in that neighborhood do yourself a favor and go to Mercadito.",0.9791,0.77,0.163,0.067,0.5113473444118604

My $11 mojito was pretty bad, and the margaritas weren't that great either. I ordered the $13.95 shrimp tacos. I will admit, they were good because they weren't greasy.

2010-05-16,1.0,"Well, I never really thought I'd write a review on here, never mind the type of review I'm about to do, but here it goes.   Put plain and simple-Don't waste your time and money.   I went with 2 friends on a Thursday night after reading and hearing about how ""fantastic"" the margaritas are as well as the food.  When we showed up the bar was full but the seating empty, so we took a booth.   I'm sure a lot of people exaggerate about how long they wait.  No exaggerating here, because when we walked in we looked at what time it was to make sure we had time to hit a couple other places up.  15 minutes folks.  15 minutes we waited and watched as servers passed our table by to take care of the other 3 TOTAL tables in the place.  We didn't even get someone until we grabbed a passing server, who then went to yell at who ever was supposed to be helping us out.   25 minutes after we sat down, we had our pitcher of Margaritas and Guac and Queso brought to us.   Margaritas-Yeah, they're overpriced, but where it's located you have to expect it so that really wasn't a big deal.  I had to ask if they used any alcohol though.  Not even the faintest taste.  So expensive AND weak as hell =s problems.   Guac and Queso-  You can't mess up G&Q at a tex mex right?  I stand corrected.  The guac was watery,  and not just kind of watery.  Watery enough to SOAK a chip if you put it in for several seconds.  The Queso.  My friend looked at me after one bite and asked if the cheese was velveeta.  After one bite, I have to say, I couldn't tell if it was or wasn't.   Those 3 problems alone were enough for me to vow to never return to this waste of space.  Flash Taco when your SOBER tastes better than this mess.",0.9353,0.806,0.12,0.074,0.42905643738977084
2010-05-15,4.0,"I tried this place out last night and was very impressed. A friend and I ordered a pitcher of the house margaritas, chips with salsa, queso and guacamole and the buffalo chicken nachos for our meal. The chips and salsa are some of the best I have had, the chips were not greasy and the salsa was amazing. I was also impressed with the queso but not so much with the guacamole. The buffalo chicken nachos were outstanding, we both appreciated that it was grilled chicken and not crispy chicken. The margaritas were also pretty good, very strong and definitely worth the price. if you're going to order at least four for your table, I'd definitely recommend the pitcher. My only complaint about Dos Diablos was the service. We waited a good ten minutes for our waitress and I finally asked another server where she was. When she finally arrived she was so so.  All in all I would say Dos Diablos is definitely worth checking out. The food is pretty great and so are the drinks. It was also a fun young crowd!",0.9971,0.669,0.319,0.012,0.6222413793103447
2010-05-10,4.0,"I have no idea what people are complaining about...Dos Diablos is a fantastic new addition to River North!  Thank God there is now wonderful mexican food within walking distance from me...prayers = answered!  My bf took me here Sat night after I was super disappointed that we missed out on Cinco de Mayo due to the huge crowd.  So we went at 9pm on Sat, he had made a reservation, and we still had to wait about 20 mins for our table.  Not a biggie, and the hostess was super nice and kept apologizing, so that made it understandable.  The restaurant was pretty hoppin', tons of peeps just hanging out at the bar, like this was the new single scene or something. When we got our table, I ordered the Diablo margarita (they limit you to 3 due to the potency), and it was orange-y and delicious and STRONG!  i couldn't even finish one.  This drink is highly recommended...at $12 a pop, you actually get your money's worth in alcohol, which is rare (espec in Riv N).  The chips and salsa are sooooo yummy - non-greasy chips and chunky salsa with a kick!  I almost filled up on chips and had to stop myself.  We ordered the Mexican Saganaki...what a fun idea!  I loved this cheese even better than normal saganaki, and the brandy and lime on top created the most amazing flavor.  For our entree we had the steak and chicken combo fajitas...some of the best fajitas i've had in a looooong time.  Right up there with my fave TexMex spots back home in Dallas...5 star fajitas for sure (i liked the beef better although that was some of the best chicken i've ever had).  The flour tortillas are freshly made, soft, warm pockets of heaven, and the flavor and tenderness of the fajita meat is unrivaled at other Mex spots i've been to in the Chi. I would give 5 stars if it weren't for the service...our waitress was nice, just not all there...we had to go grab our own utensils off another table because our app was served before we even had a fork to eat it with.  And our saganaki didn't flame the first time...it was very anti-climactic, but he got it the second time around!ha  I plan to go to Dos Diablos at least once a month...love this place!!",0.9909,0.825,0.152,0.023,0.5658954124579124
2010-05-10,3.0,"At first, I was really excited about a new Tex-Mex place opening up in River North - awesome and amazing since I'm a Texan and can never get enough of tex-mex.  So I went ahead and basically made reservations for my husbands birthday for a big group. But then I started reading all the negative reviews and I started feeling a little apprehensive about my decision.  I'll be honest, I rely on yelp so much but then i realized that in a world without Yelp, I would've gone and made an opinion for myself and that's just what I did.  (Also, it was fairly obvious that all the 5* reviews (about 9-10 of them) were fake since the reviewers all had 1 review each which have since been taken down - but still discouraging) Anywho, we were there around 930pm on Friday night and had a great time.  The food wasn't mind blowing, but the decor is good, atmosphere fun and drinks strong.  Certainly doesn't warrant all the negative reviews people have given this place.  The queso was yummy and make sure you try the El Diablo.  Will probably be back again. If I could, I'd give the place 3.5 stars. Good for groups, has the perfect casual-yet dressy enough atmosphere for pre-partying.",0.9874,0.753,0.198,0.049,0.5628167388167388
2010-05-09,1.0,"not worth it. i understand it's a new restaurant, but the food alone doesn't even make it worth coming here again. overpriced and nothing special  - this restaurant is aiming for people who are just looking for a trendy place to go to pay for mediocre food. i'll admit, the flour tortillas were good - i'm pretty sure they are made on-site, but the portions are small, and did i mention overpriced?!  the waitress forgot all our extras and so we though our food came out pretty fast, we kept waiting for stuff: tortillas, cheese/sour cream extras, drinks, etc. there are far too many BETTER mexican restaurants in chicago to go to - would not recommend this place at all.",0.9307,0.738,0.167,0.095,0.6009289321789322
2010-05-06,2.0,"Meh is exactly how I describe this place. A group of us headed over here after work on Cinco De Mayo really excited but left super disappointed. We had our names down for preferred seating and we did get a good table with enough room for our group. Our server started out well but I think she was just so overwhelmed due to it being so busy. Our margarita pitcher was left empty for longer that we would've liked.... Which brings me to the margaritas; the margaritas when our glasses were full were the highlight. Very tasty indeed and not too strong or too weak.  The food. Hmmm. Salsa was warm and I couldn't get on board, my friend likened it to eating mud because of the look. Chips were good and we were never without them. Guacamole although it tasted fresh there wasn't much flavor to them. Very bland. And now the nachos, blech. Looked good yet the hidden cheese ""product"" was difficult to eat. Not very much guac or sour cream either. Dribbles here and there. Very disappointing as we were craving nachos all day.  I definitely say go here for the margaritas but not sure about the food. I can't speak for the entrees though.",0.9353,0.736,0.161,0.103,0.5282244279018472
2010-05-03,4.0,The margaritas were awesome!  I got the fish tacos and I finished my whole plate even though I was bursting at the seams already.  Will definitely have to go back.,0.7959,0.779,0.221,0.0,0.475
2010-05-02,2.0,"Tried Dos Diablos for the first time last night with a couple of girlfriends.  We called ahead for preferred seating and everything seemed to go smoothly until they tried to seat three of us at a two-top because they had gotten the party number wrong.  We ended up waiting about 25 minutes at the bar for another table - really not bad relative to downtown restaurant waits on Saturday nights. Chips and salsa were mediocre and the drinks were not very good at all.  Two of us had original margaritas on the rocks, and they were very sweet and definitely lacking in tequila. The guacomole was the best dish we tried.  My friend and I had chicken tacos and they were fairly bland overall - they didn't come with pico, guac, sour cream, or the ""special"" hot sauce that should have been on the side.  I think the fajitas are the way to go here. The atmosphere was upbeat, but extremely loud - we had to nearly yell to have a conversation.  Also, because of its location on Hubbard the crowd runs pretty touristy.  I'm not heading back anytime soon.",0.9183,0.878,0.102,0.02,0.5376348651348651
2010-04-27,4.0,"New Sexy Mexi spot on Hubbard..... I went with a couple of gf's that had been invited to the soft opening.....they were testing out dishes, drinks and service....making sure any kinks in the system were worked out before their big debut. I started out with a cocktail at the bar.....went with the My Maria on the bartenders recommendation......fresh muddled strawberries, guava and lime juice with vodka.....not too sweet.....not too sour......loved it.....and continued to love it for about 5 more drinks :)  When my always running late gf's arrived we got down to the business of food..... Chips and Salsa were so so seriously good.....chips were crispy and warm but not greasy or heavy and the salsa was *swoon* warm!! I love warm salsa, I love delicious warm salsa even more......this was both and I couldn't stop eating it! Same story on the Guac.....fantastic flavors and just the right amount. We did the Shrimp Diablo app......they were stuffed with jalapenos, jack cheese and wrapped in bacon.....sans the bacon, I really liked these alot....nice amount of heat....came with 2 dipping sauces....but the bacon was overkill for me. For my entree I got the Pulled Chicken Tacos.....served with the usual suspect of rice n' beans.....I got these babies with the crispy corn tortillas.....which were light but totally held up to my taco.....and all the extra yummy salsa I put on them :) Chicken was full of flavor and tasted incredibly fresh.....not gi-normous in size (thank you).....I ate 2 out of my 3 and was full but not stuffed.....I would def order again. Gf's got the Southwestern Salad and the Carne Asada.....I didn't try either as my tacos had the full attention of my mouth but they were both happy with their dishes.....no complaints. Service was good.....everyone was friendly.....our server came back frequently to check on us and see how we were doing...if we needed more drinks etc....again, no complaints there. The space is totally re-done (it used to be Cabaret....remember that place??)......lots of sexy wood....dim lights....and some big comfy booths along the back wall. I could see this place getting a little loud when they're busy....but I think that it would only add to the festive atmosphere. Overall...I was very happy with my Mex-perience and think that this will be a great option for pre-going out and/or late night eats for the Hubbard Street crowd.",0.9963,0.796,0.171,0.034,0.6076532805256211
