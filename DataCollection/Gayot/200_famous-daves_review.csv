My grandmother made excellent bread pudding and believe me when I say I've searched and tasted at restaurants all across the country for just ONE place that made this dessert the way it was intended.  A waitress at FD told me the secret is that they use Texas toast to make the bread pudding.   The dessert is smooth, creamy, served with an AMAZING warm praline sauce and ice cream.  It's enough for two to share OR you can bring the rest home and snack on it for a couple of days.   Oh, yes...they have ribs too.  They're outstanding!  Smoked, tender and ever so flavorful.  The grilled salmon is to die for.  I order it medium rare so there's no risk of overcooking my fish.  All in all, if you want to eat good southern-like cooking FD is the place.  Not much at all on atmosphere.  But a great week day place to get a good meal and or call ahead and pick it up to go.",0.9621,0.823,0.135,0.042,0.6305555555555554
