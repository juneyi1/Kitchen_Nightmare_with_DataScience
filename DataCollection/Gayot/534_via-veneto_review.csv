2017-08-09,5.0,"Wow! The food here was absolutely suburb. This wonderful local Italian spot is a gem! We started off with a delicious appetizer, pan-fried zucchini blossoms; the breading was just perfect - not too heavy, almost like air... it wasn't like other places where all you taste in the breading. They also give you fresh, warm bread with your meal and olive + Parmesan! My favorite! For the entree I had the carbonara pasta with pancetta and my boyfriend had the lemon spaghetti with shrimp. Both were suburb - huge portions and you could taste the love and passion in each dish! The cream sauce in my carbonara was seriously the best I had ever had. Smooth and buttery, but not overwhelmingly so. The service also was wonderful, very attentive and hospitable. Tony the owner even stopped by to check on us! Talk about customer service. I highly recommend this place, you have to try it!!",0.9833,0.753,0.225,0.022,0.6848412698412698

2016-12-16,5.0,I have to say this place was so accommodating! I have a special needs little girl and she isn't always the easiest to go and try and have a nice family dinner with. She can be a bit loud at times because she is unable to talk. This is sometimes disturbing to other patrons and we ARE very aware and sensitive to others. This is why we avoid going out to eat. The management opened up one of their banquet rooms to me and my extended famliy so my daughter could get loud and get up from her chair to walk around if she needed to! They made us feel very welcome and took complete care of us. Needless to say we had a wonderful family dinner!!

2016-06-20,5.0,"Via Veneto is perhaps one of my favorite restaurants in the city. We've been going there since it was a smaller storefront on the Northwest Side and had a sister restaurant (name forgotten) just south of Andersonville. The move to Devon and Lincoln brought a bigger dining room, and wonderful party room (which we used once for a special event), but still the same happy, helpful staff. Plus tons of parking. The food is always good and sometimes inspired, like the pumpkin-filled pasta pockets that show up in the fall. We know we can always get grilled calamari there (none of that breaded, fried stuff) and it's always exquisite. No matter what I order it's always too much for me, but the staff is happy to let me take the remainder home. I'm quite partial to their pasta and to their seafood cioppino (or is it frutti de mare?).

Panzanella: No love!  It looked like the bread was croutons from a bag! Cauliflower salad on special: No flavor, and missing brussels sprouts-- I hate it when a dish does not come out as advertised. Desserts: Come out nearly frozen.  Clearly these dessert might have been good if they were kept at the right temperature, but instead they are too cold, and dressed with what looks like store bought caramel and chocolate sauces. One exception: The simplicity and freshness of the angel hair pasta dish (simple marinara and mozzarella) made this dish a standout.  I really wish I could say the same about the rest of the menu.",0.9782,0.692,0.225,0.083,0.4793174603174603

That was definitely worth it.  We ordered the calamari, the spinach stuffed gnocci with a tomato cream sauce and fettuccine bolognese. The calamari was the best thing here- I remember it being pretty good years ago and I'm glad that hasn't changed.  The pastas were pretty standard. Nothing special. The gnocchi tasted good, but it was really mushy. The bolognese was easily the worst dish. The sauce was tart and acidic and didn't have any depth. Honestly, I make a better bolognese from scratch and I'm 100% not Italian.  To sum it up, it was pretty average.

This is a substantial portion of tender loveliness that literally falls apart in your mouth for 14.95. My mom and I ordered our own because neither of us wanted to share! For the money, I have never had more octopus on a plate anywhere.  The house Chianti is a fruity, rich party for your palate.  I adore gnocchi and  I ordered their pillows of potato love with a Bolognese sauce. I know I shouldn't ask for  a substitution (it is usually served with a plum tomato sauce), but I swoon over a complex and meaty Bolognese and  the waitresses never batted an eye when I asked for it. My father ordered the veal--tender, buttery bliss. Love me some capers. No italian meal is over until I have eaten the cannoli and Via Veneto's version of this classic dessert is perfectly accented with the teensiest bit of lemon in the filling and laced with chocolate sauce. I loved that  the servers had a sense of humor and pride in their establishment's food and that is what you will get here. You have essentially entered someone's house here--if you have an Italian grandmother or aunt you get the semi-pushy attitude of the servers. They know what is good and were not afraid to make the suggestions that enhanced our meal. Our waitress dropped a twenty dollars of the next visit card on us with the bill. I was already planning my next visit. . . Italian perfection. Period.  I loved the crowd early last Friday evening: pure moonstruck type oldsters.  Three quarters of the way into our meal four opera singers accompanied by a classic pianist performed a mini-opera for the crowd. It was over the top for sure, but  I love that kind of thing with a read wine buzz.  You are not going to be bothered by anyone you know here if you are under forty.

I ordered stuffed Calamari with pasta and my boyfriend ordered a dish with Veal, Chicken, Sausage, Peppers and Potatoes. My wine tasted like the bottle had been open for over a week. My boyfriend's meal came out and it was a pile of meat, peppers and POTATO CHIPS doused in Prego. He asked the busboy if the potato chips were made in house, I think to see if he'd get a reaction about there being potato chips in spagetti sauce, and he said ""Oh Yes, we make them in house"" without batting and eyelash. And... the calamari... oh the calamari. It looked like three large pale white worms or pieces of intestine, and when I cut into them, this foul smelling breading came pouring out. The pasta was straight out of the box and the sauce again... I know when I taste Prego. I actually ate the calamari sans breading, and when my plate went back to the kitchen there were about two cups of nasty breading cheese mixture on the plate. The  busboy actually had the gaul to ask if I'd like the leftovers packed to go...! Eww NO! Our official decision to skip desert was made when a waiter stopped by the table with a slice of chocolate cake and asked us if we'd ordered the souffle he had in hand. I was appalled.

I feel for the place because it's an Italian family owned restaurant, but I've had really bad experiences here. The only time the experience was pleasant was the 2nd time when the male owner served our table.  Food: The food here is terrible. For an Italian restaurant, they don't know how to cook pasta or decent Italian food. FAIL! I had the stuffed gnocchi, don't order it! It tasted bad where I didn't even want to eat my left overs. The second time I tried the Ahi Tuna which was surprisingly really good. The third time I had the Ahi Tuna again, but it was overcooked, did not taste good, the outside was pan burnt, and the green beans tasted like they were frozen vegetables. My what is suppose to be raw tuna, came out as medium cooked tuna. FAIL. Other guests at my table also complained the pasta was disgusting and undercooked. Another person found ""stones"" in the seafood pasta. The chef also drenches food in olive oil or butter sauces. They definitely need a new chef or better training. The food is WAY OVERPRICED for horribly poor quality food.  Service: The older lady server is not friendly. She has this ""I'm better than you and don't want to serve you"" smug attitude. You can tell at times she tries to be nice, but the forced fakeness is extremely obvious. We all got a really bad and negative vibe from her. The male owner on the other hand was very nice and outgoing when he served our table.  Cleanliness: FULL BOTTOM LIP LIPSTICK ON GLASSWARE. Enough said!! Negligence to clean and check glassware before placement is a major FAIL. On top of that, the menus are all dirty with crumbs all over them. For a place that is often empty or not very busy, they sure do neglect simple cleaning duties. This causes a red flag for me about the cleanliness behind kitchen doors.  The banquet hall looks nice.

The food was always delicious and the wait staff very attentive. Since we moved out of the neighborhood we haven't been back in years. A few months ago Living Social had a coupon for Via Veneto so I immediately purchased one- boy that was a mistake. Last week  I went to Via Veneto and was very disappointed. The food was okay at best but the service was lousy!!! We waited almost 5 minutes at the front counter before anyone acknowledged us-even though many staff members walked right by us. After waiting a few minutes we were finally acknowledged and seated. As we looked at our menus we had to wait another 10 minutes before our waitress even came by to take our drink order. About 10 minutes later, our waitress came back to give us our drinks so we decided that since she was here we better put our food order in, so we did and that was pretty much the last time she came by our table until our food was ready.  The only time she would come back is when we flagged her down to ask her for something. As I said earlier the food was okay but the horrible service received by the wait staff  is the reason that I will never go back to this restaurant again. As I was leaving I heard one of the wait staff inform one of the waitresses that one of the tables was ready for their check and her response was they are here on a coupon...they can wait.

(Not big at all and both still hungry afterwards.)  It came with a very small dollop of mashed potatoes. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, which was delicious.

2011-09-10,3.0,"Via Veneto...in business for over 20 years. Yeah, crazy. It's a rarity to find a spot like this that's still open. Walking in, I definitely felt like I time traveled. It was a little dim, but light enough to see everything around while dining. The tables were plentiful, and there's also a banquet area. There's a lot of room in the restaurant. My girlfriend and I were seated in a rounded booth, pretty sweet. I felt like I was important [insert cheesy smile]. It was pretty empty in the restaurant...granted we were dining on a weekday evening. But with all the special promotions*, I'm surprised that more people weren't there. The menu is pretty big, filled with pretty traditional Italian dishes. We wound up ordering the calamari fritti [aka fried calamari], a grilled ahi tuna that was on a special menu, and the Ciambotto Italian Combo. Let's begin pre-appetizer. Our came a basket full of different types of bread......we didn't touch the bread for a while because many reviews said there's complimentary bruschetta. So we waited for a few minutes, but it was a no go [insert sad face]. Maybe you have to ask for it[?] But anywho, the bread was a little cold [nbd] and a bit hard. It got the job done while we waited for the calamari. Definitely made to order, still glistening with oil, these little cephalopods were delightful. Plain, with lemon, dipped in marinara, the calamari was delish. Out came our entrees and man, there was enough to feel like four people. Not that I'm complaining, but you definitely get a lot for your dollar. The ahi tuna was cooked a little more well than I'm accustomed, but it packed a hefty flavor [mainly citrus]. The Italian combo had everything from chicken to veal to sausage to potatoes all in a red sauce. I mean, it was aight. But if I were to come back [see * below] I would definitely order something else...maybe pasta. Service was on point all night long. From the actual server to the food runners to the drink fillers. The staff is definitely a huge plus. *Now here's the thing. There are so many different promos that Via Veneto does that you really don't have to spend all of your money. Check out  restaurant.com  for a gift certificate [that's what we did]. There is also an email club, kgb deals, and monthly deals that Via Veneto advertises on their own website.

See, this is the place I had a first date with my husband 9 years ago, at the original Peterson locay. Years went by, the place moved to Lincoln, I didn't know so I resigned thinking I shamefully forgotten our first date place or the street it's on. So lucky me, I find it - via Travelzoo half-off vouchers email offer.  Went on Saturday, un-crowded but not slow (they also had event in a banquet room).  Seated promptly, wonderful warm service - the manager, the server, bus staff. Asked for another, quieter table - no problem, got exactly what asked for. The staff don't bother you constantly with that silly ""So.. how are we doing??"" pep every 5 minutes, but do watch you from a distance, and if it looked like we needed a refill, etc - boom, someone is always there.  Very nice, no-nonsense waitress, we made a small talk between dishes.  Had calamari fritti (yum, paper-thin breading and not a hint of chewiness.... perfection, we inhaled the whole platter. Definitely shareable) and muscles with marinara type sauce, the house marinara was heavenly. Bread, meh, but who cares with all the goodness that was served. Ribeye and sea bass for entrees - exceptionally well cooked, charred just a tiny bit, flavorful, fresh, donness of meat exact as ordered. Good sides for both, fresh veggies + potato veggies for steak and spinach/bean medley for fish. Finished with zuccoto and something else hazelnate-y and flourless which name I don't recall... delish. The portions of dessert could be a bit larger (sadly, I'm getting used to American standards of portions), but since we had two, we didn't care.  One of the best features were the martinis.... Oh goodness, well worth the $10 they charge. Had Lemoncillo and Negroni; both are basically 3.5 oz or so of really good vodka (Absolut Limon and GG I think)... and just a hint of accompanying flavors. Stroooong, we caught a major buzz after few sips and were considerably shnocked after finishing them... Very, very well made. Not one of those normal syrupy fakies who only pass for martini because of being served in martini glass. Worth a separate mention on that account.  We both loved it. Now, I'm not a huge fan of Italian food because it's often too salty, acidic, very rich and ""carby"".   The dishes we had were none of that - tons of flavor but not a heart attack special. I also like that it's a very casual place, we saw some folks wearing evening garb but there were a few jeans and t-shirt as well.       In summary - it was delightful, great food, didn't have any pastas but we'll leave that for a next visit.

The decor is consistent of a Italian restaurant circa early 90's.  The quality of the furnishings, utensils and serving ware are in good condition.  Right after ordering I promptly notified the waiter my intentions of using a promo.  I wanted to alleviate any possible confrontation once the bill came.  The waiter looked like he had absolutely no problem with it. There was one item I had in mind that I had to try, regardless how cold my body's core temperature was, due to the adoration by many - A lemon drop Martini.  At $10 it is not cheap.  However, it is served in a huge glass, and most importantly the drink was prepared extremely well.  It is well worth the trip to the restaurant just for their Martinis.  Although the place has a bar located in the entry area it is not conducive to hang out unless you don't mind standing (no seats along the bar) and looking a little out of place. What's a trip to an Italian restaurant without having the calamari fritti appetizer?  It was cooked well but just a touch chewy.  However, I know how incredibly difficult it is to have it prepared perfectly so I won't use that against them.  Both our main dishes were excellent.  I had the cheese filled tortellini with peas and onion.  My brother the gnocci ripieni.

That and the bruchetta was so chewy I needed water to wash it down. We ordered porta bella & artichoke appetizer which visually looked good, although tasted like it was thrown together last minute. Mushrooms were rubbery and cold. The dinner salads looked like they were pre-made in a nursing home cafeteria and pulled out of the refrigerator as it came out in about 3 minutes. All iceberg lettuce and the three radishes were perfectly placed on both of our dishes - so I know it was pre-made. I ordered the fried calamari and seafood dish - and oh-my-goodness. This was deep fried with about  1/4 inch thick batter and looked like it came out of the fryer at Long John Silver's. I couldn't tell what type fish was hiding in which log roll of batter. That and the marinara sauce was like ketchup with some added texture. I couldn't get past three bites. Also, in one of these dishes, they put in MSG. Believe me I know, I have been up since three in the morning with an MSG headache since I am very sensitive to the stuff. Are you kidding me? Olive Garden and Long John Silver's makes better food. We had to stop at Stone Cold Creamery on the way home to get some ice cream to wash the taste out of our mouths - and that only worked for a couple hours.

This was originally a chinese restaurant, then the Via Veneto owners bought it and renovated it.  It had been like at least 20 years or more since I had visted them, and as I sat in their nicely decorated surroundings and ate their cuisine.  I was sad I did not frequent this restaurant more often. We had a large party of 13 people and we were seated immediately.  The service was superb and our servers were very attentive to keeping drinks filled and plates cleaned off.   We had a number of appetizers, the one that really stood out is the Polpo alla Griglia (Grilled Octopus).  OMG it was so good! Not rubbery at all!  Well, not as rubbery as a grilled octopus would be if overcooked.  This octopus dish was cooked just right!  We also had the fried and the grilled calamari, both awesome!  All of the appetizers were definitely a great re-introduction to Via Veneto. Next, was our entrees...I usually order a Fettucine Alfredo, but they did not have one on the menu.  So, instead I ordered a carbonara dish, which was close enough.  And.....it passed with flying colors!  Double Rainbows even!  I had to stop myself or else I'd have burst! :) My husband had a pasta shells and ""cabbage rolls"" type dish and he loved it as well.  The bread was also very yummy and they served not only butter, but balsamic, oil, and parmesean if you want to eat it that way.   I am definitely coming back to this place when I am in the area.  Our server, Marco was very personable, courteous, and attentive to our needs.   I can't wait to try the other dishes, when I go next time!",0.9969,0.781,0.2,0.019,0.5654081632653062

2010-10-05,4.0,"As a long-time Chicagoan, I have eaten at Via Veneto in past years. Until last week, the most recent occasion was, I think, was 3.5 - 4 years ago. In a previous,  20th century life, I had eaten several times at Via Veneto when it was located on Peterson Avenue. I liked it, but, Chicago being a center for really good Italian restaurants, some within a 15-minute walk of my home, I was rarely inspired to get into the automobile and drive half an hour, when I could get just as good closer to home. The motivation for returning to Via Veneto was the monthly dine-out for our Meetup ""hiking and fun"" group. Ten people gathered last week to overeat, overdrink, and celebrate a restaurant that has parking. Before going, I did read the other reviews here on Yelp, and I admit, I was a little nervous. It sounded like the quality had gone downhill faster than a lava flow down the slopes of Vesuvius. It was a pleasant surprise to find that ten people could order a wide variety of meals, and everyone was happy. As we sat down, the waiter brought over a few plates of free bruschetta. It was good, not great, and the group sucked it all down quickly. Bread baskets quickly appeared, and that started to disappear as well. For some reason, people were not ordering appetizers, so i can't speak to the general opinion on that. Instead of an entree, I just had a big bowl of minestrone soup and two rolls. That was plenty for me. I really loved the soup. The people next to me and across from me ordered 2 kinds of lasagna. The portions were large. The meat eater was pleased that there was a lot of meat in his lasagna. The spinach lasagna eater said that she normally doesn't order lasagna, but it sounded really good, and she was finding it hard to put down her fork, it was that good. Both people ended up taking the leftovers home. The person next to me on the left ordered a spaghetti with chicken and brocolli. She said it was very good. Another woman ordered the pasta primavera, but asked to have an alfredo sauce substituted. She said that was very good, too. Up and down the table, people said their entrees were good, and that Via Veneto had been a good choice. The only dessert order was one tiramisu, and she got it to go, so I can't tell you anything about dessert.  The only caveat I have is the service. The waiter who worked with us was very pleasant, but he wasn't around so much. I had to ask for wine lists when he came for our drink orders. When it was time for our check, we waited and waited, and I finally got up to look for him. He was wrapping silverware in the front of the restaurant. Again, a nice guy, but he needs to step it up a bit. I would go again. And I think the other members of the hiking and fun club would agree. I didn't hear anyone say their food was liking in taste, portion, or proper temperature.",0.9984,0.788,0.181,0.031,0.4568002645502647

2010-08-23,1.0,"Ate there last night.   Here is what we ordered: Appetizers: Baked Clams - like rubber bands. Spit it out because chewing proved to be a fruitless endeavor. My teeth were no match for baked michelin tires. Fried Eggplant - The batter tasted like it was left over from friday's fish fry. It was topped with barely melted store bought shredded Mozzerella. Entrees: Ahi Tuna - It was served on top of green beans covered in a garlic sauce.  The sauce was good but it developed a skin as if it had been under a warming lamp. The beans were fine. the fish, however, was supposed to be seared and rare in the middle.  The outer portion of the fish was a greyish color and the center was barely pink. This was not fresh fish.   Side of Gnocci - The best part of my meal was a side of Gnocchi.  I asked if they had Arrabiata sauce and the waitress told me that they just add Jalapenos to Marinara. I told her to just give me the marinara.  It was good. Salmon - My girlfriend ordered salmon. I tried some and it wasn't bad, but it was surely not something to brag about.  The potatoes that it was served with were not well cooked either. When the waitress saw that we were done eating 75% of our food was still on the plates. She asked if we wanted it wrapped and we said no. She did not look surprised. We came 30 mins before closing. I called ahead to make sure this would be ok and the manager said that it would be fine.  Apparently they don't care about the last table of the night.  I won't be coming back.

I thought it was going to be good, authentic Italian food since the woman smoking outside was speaking Italian and the decor inside is very tasteful, but these were bad assumptions to make. This turned out to be the most expensive bad meal we've had in a long time. First of all, we saw no 'complimentary bruschetta,' as other posts have mentioned, and the bread we got was cold, tough and stale. The baked clam appetizer was like eating oily bread crumb-covered rubber bands. My boyfriend spit his out, and I got a stomachache as I continued to try to eat them to be polite. Our eggplant appetizer was soggy and tasteless with the nastiest mozzarella cheese on top. Our waitress suggested the ahi tuna entree to be cooked rare or else it would be too tough. It came out medium (definitely too tough) and there was an entire part of it that was inedible. It was served over grey-brown green beans. My salmon was alright, cooked to the right consistency, but I couldn't finish it because I was becoming nauseous from the clams. We ordered a side of gnocchi with arrabiatta, but when the server explained that they simply take marinara sauce and add giardinara to it to make arrabiatta, we knew that the kitchen staff must be sub-par. The wine was pretty good, but when we wound up with a $65 check AFTER the coupon for such a bad experience, it was obvious we would not be returning. Maybe they weren't trying as hard as they normally do when they are busier, but it is my opinion that you should treat every customer with the same quality of service, and we definitely didn't see what makes this restaurant so 'great' according to other reviews.",0.4007,0.836,0.087,0.077,0.5517399267399269

I bet their catering is great, because you don't have to deal with the things that make this place not so great.  Among those things, first and foremost is the location.  I cannot think of a worse location for a restaurant.  Along Lincoln Ave, which is quite busy around that area, parking is not easy, and the road is just a mess that's always either under construction or full of pot holes.  The restaurant is overshadowed by a few big buildings, I think a bank and a hospital, so not really the exciting area in which to enjoy a quiet dinner. The other thing is the ambiance of this place, or lack thereof.  You walk in, and the decor is slightly better than Olive Garden.  It's what I think of as a cheesy attempt at recreating what these people think is an Italian atmosphere.  It works on some people, but I guess it just doesn't work on me. Finally, the clientele is so bland and blah.  I am not above anyone, but most of the people I see there are the types of people who go out to a restaurant to eat and leave.  You're probably thinking what else is there to do at a restaurant.  Well, I really like places where people seem like they're enjoying the whole experience and each other.  For goodness sake, TALK TO EACH OTHER while you're inhaling your food.  A meal is not just about the food, it's about celebrating each other.  If you really want the whole Italian experience that's what Italians do.  Their meals last for hours, so don't come in, eat, and leave all within 45 minutes.  Not to mention, being a young person, I would like the average age of a place I eat at to be close to my age, and not hovering around 70.  No offense to 70 year olds, but I love a mix of all different ages.  Again, I like Italian restaurants to feel like family joints, not like the cafeteria at a retirement community.

Now the mob is gonna be after me for that last comment.  Good thing my real name is not Luan.  I have forged my identity on yelp for instances like this when a hitman is sent out for my restaurant slander.    But, I'll give you a hint, my initials are A.S. and my first name sounds like a self-sustaining religious community in parts of PA and OH.",0.9967,0.807,0.144,0.049,0.49984539270253553

Anyway, the food was delicious, but our waitress was unattentive and didn't come back to fill our water once! Its like they didn't even care you were there. I would have loved to give this place 4 stars, but the service just ruined it for me.  The prices are a bit steep too, so be prepared to shell out at least $20-$30 for an entree.  I just came from there, but my husband and I didn't get the complimentary bruschetta that some of the yelpers are talking about.  We did get a basket of cold, hard bread.  BUT the entrees we ordered were delicious.  We decided to be adventurous and tried an appetizer of charcoal broiled octopus in a balsamic vinegar, olive oil & lemon sauce.  It was YUMMY! It was not tough at all and very flavorful.  We also tried this pasta dish with all the seafood you could imagine (calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels, salmon) tossed with thin pasta in a light tomato sauce.  My husband had the chicken & sausage vesuvio with roasted garlic & rosemary potatoes that was just ""ok"" to him.   I would have liked to come back to this place, but honestly, I'd rather go to an Olive Garden.  At least you get great food AND great service.",0.9942,0.748,0.209,0.043,0.664423076923077

2008-10-28,3.0,"If there is such a thing as a Bread Monster (Ala cookie monster), then I am it! I simply MUST love a place that gives you complimentary Bruschetta! The carboholic in me just loves that. I was a bit dismayed upon arrival & perusal of the menu that bruschetta was no where to be found on the extensive menu. Of course being the loud mouth that I am, I proclaimed this to the party I was with & viola within seconds the very attentive wait staff brought it out & placed it right in front of me. Oh the joy that brought to my heart! Listen people, it is the little things that make me happy.  You should be warned that if carbs are your downfall, they you may wish to steer clear of this place (as well as any other Italian restaurant--seriously!). Not only do the bring the bruschetta gratis (yay!), they also bring your a basket full of bread. Let's just put it this way, I was full way before our appetizer came out. Speaking of the bruschetta (can you tell that I love it yet?), if you have an aversion to stinking of garlic, stay away--it is loaded with it. Since I do not have a problem reeking of garlic, I happily indulged.  The food was very good--not the best Italian I have ever had, but it was pretty satisfying. The portions were humongous, you may want to think of sharing meals if you do not wish to bring any home (there is a $2 plate sharing fee). Between the group of 4 of us, there was a variety of meals. Lasagna, stuffed gnocchi, pasta with mussels, and pasta with scallops. The plates were so huge, that we covered the entire table--good gracious we looked like pigs (oink, oink!). I had the stuffed gnocchi with ricotta & spinach covered in a tomato cream sauce.  Overall I was pleased with my dish, but I would say it was stuffed more with ricotta than spinach--there was hardly any spinach. That would probably be the one thing I would change about the experience & it would perhaps bump this up to 4 stars.  The wait staff were spot on, they cared for everything we needed, they were attentive with out being overbearing. The ambiance was nice, it could be a little more romantic, but really there is nothing to complain about on that front. The place itself is more spacious than one would think from looking at from the outside.  My last note is this--if you are going to order dessert--order the pumpkin cheesecake--holy flip--it is divine! We ordered one for the table and it was more than enough to satisfy the sweet tooth.",0.9978,0.787,0.194,0.019,0.54328231292517

The menu selection is plentiful but I must say I have never ventured past their pasta selections so I can not say much about some of their other dishes.  The restaurant definitely looks more pleasing on the inside than out. The ambiance for a Saturday night was pretty happening yet the service was quite good.

Pricey, too.  I actually felt sick after eating the beef tenderloin masala.  Small portion of meat pounded very thin with little taste to it.  The complementary appetizer of bruschetta had so much raw garlic in it that I couldn't finish my piece... and I'm a garlic lover!  My mother's salad, with shrimp, avocado etc. in it was flavorless she said.  My niece's salmon was very fishy tasting.  We were one dissatisfied bunch.  You can do A WHOLE LOT better elsewhere.  The cozy surroundings can't make up for the mediocre food.  If I could give less than one star, I would.  Dont' waste your money!!!!!",-0.8173,0.823,0.054,0.123,0.5060962846677132

She doesn't judge you if you lick your plate. She's rightfully takes it as a compliment and does tell you are fat. She makes sure you have enough to take home.  It's a family owned & operated Italian American restaurant. I've been looking for one for ages. They seem to be going the way of the grandmothers. The service was excellent. They weren't pushy and constantly ""checking in"" It makes me feel like they want to hurry you along. Not here. But I should mention that we were there off-peak.  I had the Ahi Tuna special that was perfectly seared cooked with traditional Italian flavors over green beans. The green beans weren't great but the Tuna was nicely seasoned and nicely medium rare. I love fish steak. The pasta portions were HUGE! They could feed a family of 4! Still the sauces were very well seasoned and the pasta was perfectly al dente. The desserts were very good. The tiramisu was very good but I loved the tartuffo.  I'll have to come back next time and have some wine with the meal. They seemed to have quite a wine list but I just glanced at it.

The food was fine but not nearly as memorable as the lack of service. I have received better service at the wiener circle than at this place, at the wiener circle they acknowledge your presence even if it is with a F*** You white boy. Here no one did anything for us once we sat down.  After we were seated the bread and water came fast, then I think they thought they were done. Because we waited over five minutes for someone to notice us by that time we were ready to order drinks and our food. The glass had lipstick on it the fork had something on it, which is forgivable if you make up for it with quality service there on out. But till the check was dropped the order was the only time we saw our server. I finished my water mid way through the salad, never refilled again. Never asked if I want more wine? how is the food? Can I get you more bread? They didn't ask us anything. I can forgive a lot and am patient but I didn't have anyone to even to forgive or be patient with because no one came.  You might think the restaurant was busy, no only 5 other tables. Maybe it was late and they were closing down, again no it was 8 o'clock.

2007-05-29,5.0,"I must be insane.  I swear that I'm the only Italian guy that when he goes out to an Italian restaurant DOESN'T order pasta.  ""Pasta is boring, anybody can cook pasta!"" is what my mind screams.  Neither sentiment is true, as many a plate of bad spaghetti can be had in Chi-town. Personal bias when going out to Italian joints aside, the other day I found myself at Via Veneto with my wife.  I know, I know, it's an Italian joint, you should order the pasta.  No way, Joe, I'm ordering something different.  Besides, it's usually the NON-pasta dishes that really define how true (or not!) an Italian joint is. I ordered the Petto Di Pollo Alla Senape (yes, I had to look up the spelling!) and the wife ordered the four cheese risotto.  Hoooo-momma, I was SO glad I didn't order the pasta!  Not that there's anything wrong with their pasta, I was just SO happy with my chicken that I didn't CARE that I wasn't having the pasta.  From the description, I was prepared for a pretty heavy handed sauce that would completely mask that I was eating chicken.  (Mustard based sauces tend to tromp all over everything like boots drop mud after hiking in a rainstorm.)  Nothing could have been farther from the truth!  What I was served was a very reserved, balanced, and darn near perfect counterpoint sauce to the chicken and asparagus.  Creamy without being soupy or stiff, just enough seasoning without being bland nor overbearing.  Needless to say, the chicken tasted GREAT!  And the sauce was good enough on its own that after you're done with your main course, it DEMANDS that you use every single piece of bread on the table as soppage, as throwing any away would be pure sacrilege. The four cheese risotto, while not quite as much of a grand slam as my chicken, was definitely very good.  In absence of the chicken, I'd say it was excellent, but once you have a grand slam on the table a mere home run is somewhat anticlimactic.  But on its own it did everything right that a risotto needs to do; creamy without actually using cream, slightly sticky due to all the cheese (to be expected), and was a joy to savor from bite to bite. The ambiance of Via Veneto is quiet and reserved.  This would be a great place to take a date.  When we were there (7-8PM) the dining room was still being naturally lit via the windows.   Whole heartedly recommended, as I know we will definitely be back.  Maybe I'll order the pasta next time.  (....nahhhh.)",0.9863,0.834,0.117,0.049,0.5655376344086022
