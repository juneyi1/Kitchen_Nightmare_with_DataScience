2017-08-04,5.0,"Athena is the cutest.  I came in and did not realize she was REAL!  On a miserably dreary rainy morning like this, today, the coffee and incredibly delicious croissants have me excited to start the day. These are truly fresh, buttery, crispy and flaky on the outside and soft, melting on the tongue inside. The contrast is evident when compared to the alternative dry, stale offerings at Dunkin Doughnuts or the gummy, packaged in plastic who knows how long from Starbucks.  What I'm saying is go here, order coffee and croissant and pet Athena. Your day is certain to be better!",0.9492,0.744,0.198,0.057,0.5392857142857143

This place is utterly delightful, all I hope is that the owner can find a way to stay open or reopen ASAP.

2017-07-04,4.0,"Cute, tiny neighborhood coffee place.  The four stars are for what it is: a cute, tiny neighborhood coffee place. It's not a full-service restaurant, you may end up elbow-to-elbow with some strangers, and parking is limited. They also don't have evening hours. It's the kind of place you stroll to on a late and lazy morning, or grab a coffee from on your way to work, or sit at for an hour or three while staring at a computer screen trying to get some work done. It's also, unless I've missed something, the only French-themed coffee shop nearby, which adds to the diversity of an already-diverse neighborhood.  If stairs are a problem, pick someplace else- you'll have to go down just a few steps to get inside. There may be an accessible rear entrance I haven't seen, but I suspect that navigating the space with a wheelchair might be a bit of a challenge. I usually save my fifth star for places that are accessible.",0.753,0.884,0.075,0.041,0.5736961451247166

The positives about this sunny cafe:  the decor, the big tables, the Chicago's own Metropolis coffee, the super clean bathroom, and very nice and friendly staff. The negatives:  parking is residential zoned, or meter paid parking unless u risk it parking in the Village Outlet......other customers convo can be distracting, and its such an intimate space its hard not to eaves drop......also the freaking swing music is really loud and pumping through the cafe, I looked around to see where the dance floor was....so unless you bring serious noise cancellation head phones, this cafe is more for meet and greets rather than a hard core cafe for getting things done.",0.9145,0.777,0.145,0.078,0.5797619047619048

2016-11-11,2.0,"I used to really enjoy this place. This place is super cute. The decor is rustic and cozy. Their drinks are ok/mediocre. I'd rather venture out of Albany Park/North Park for a much better cup of coffee.  However, I can never go in the afternoon/evening because their hours are odd. They close very early for a coffee shop, so definitely not a place for an afternoon pick-me-up.  Also, a couple of the baristas I've been served by were a bit cold and distant and not very good at answering questions. I have been a barista before and although you can get busy, a warm smile and bubbly personally are essential at all times.  When they first opened, they were a great coffee shop, but I feel like overtime their quality has dropped a bit. I hope they improve and do well because Albany Park needs a warm, inviting, and cool independent coffee shop.",0.9849,0.743,0.236,0.021,0.4965018315018314

The blue berry muffin also paired perfectly with the latte, not too sweet, full of blueberries inside, and delicious!!  There is available meter parking in front of the cafe which is nice and on Sundays it's free! Definitely worth a trip to stop by and check this place out!

The Metropolis coffee was fantastic and the croissants were terrific.  Not the spongy stretchy things you get some places, but the flakey real deal, which I was told are delivered daily from Gingersnap Sweets.

2016-02-10,5.0,"When I used to live in Albany, Daddy J. and I always talked about the lack of neighborhood coffee shops in Albany Park.  As a former resident of Albany Park myself, I finally gave in, knowing that there wouldn't be a chic coffee spot coming soon.  At that time I was semi-reluctant to move to the new house we bought in Portage Park.   Lo and behold, Cafe Chien was established as I was leaving the neighborhood.  This is a cute, cozy place tucked away near the corner of Lawrence and Spaulding, across from the side exit of the Village Discount Outlet parking lot.  Since I was in my old hood taking care of some banking business, I wanted to check it out.   I love the logo with a French terrier wearing a beret.  I LOVE pets, but the only thing I dislike is the Teacher's Pet.  Sorry, I didn't include some kind of humor in the first paragraph, so that was it.   If that ""Teacher's Pet"" thing was a bit dry, please disregard that.  However, the almond butter croissant was nice and moist.  I also ordered the cortado to go with the pastry.  It was also solid.   They serve Metropolis Coffee.  Actually, I did a bit ""stalking"" on the owner's background and her Yelp profile.  Maxine, the owner who greeted and served me this afternoon, appeared to be an avid supporter for local businesses.  I, therefore, wanted to present my precious five (5) star rating to Cafe Chien.  I hope they continue to do well in the neighborhood.  Albany Park may have a plenty of panaderias, yet it can definitely use a little ""French rustic theme"" to the existing diversity!",0.9852,0.816,0.147,0.036,0.5206876456876457

2015-12-17,4.0,Great place and staff. Coffee's a bit pricier than other coffee shops but worth it if you like Metropolis. Their small size cup is super tiny and their medium is more like a small which kinda forces you to buy a large which in fact looks like a medium compared to other coffee shops.    I think if they adjust their size portions they will most defiantly put them selves competitively with other great shops that are in walking or a short driving distance.

So of course this place is a welcome addition to the area.   I'm not too sophisticated on my coffee needs outside of brewed/pour over with a dash of milk but the service was fast and I enjoy that they serve Metropolis.  Having the option to buy a bag was great too since you never know when the caffeine need will strike.  Sadly, I ventured in more towards the late side of morning so I'm guessing that's why the food seemed sparse but I could see myself blowing some cash here with the addition of a few fresh sandwiches (entirely no hint intended).

Lots of French decor, along with study wooden benches and tables. The seating plan is currently a little tight but I think they're exploring that and seeing what works best. Free wi-fi as standard.  Owners/managers are friendly, pleasant, and using top quality equipment including what looked like a stunning new Nuova Simonelli 4 group espresso machine. Not sure of the coffee bean source(s), and think they might still be establishing that.  They are set up for going far and being a hot-spot of Albany Park. Judging by the set up and the eagerly friendly service provided, they will be going far and are set for coping with a busy store. Location-wise this is perfect as it's accessible for pedestrians walking to/from the Kedzie-Brown or Kimball-Brown train stops.
