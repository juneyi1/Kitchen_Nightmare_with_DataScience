2009-02-23,5.0,"My virgin experience...This was my first encounter in the high-end steak scene.  It was 1997 and times were good.  In Chicago for a business trip, my boss took a few of us to Magnums.  They had just gone to The Chop House the day before but preferred it here.  This place exemplified all that you imagine when you think of a steakhouse.  Warm ambience and colors, knowledgeable waiters, the raw meat is shown at your table, there's a piano singer in the background, guys smoking cigars at their table.  Everything is a la carte and expensive but, hey, I wasn't paying so it didn't matter. I had the 24oz bone-in rib eye.  It was beautiful...crusty and flavorful on the outside, with just the right amount of burntness so you didn't bite into huge clumps of fat (which is typical on rib-eye).  The inside was juicy, tender and had a wonderful flavor (no steaksauce needed here).  It made Outback seem like a cheap Denny's steak (although a Denny's steak late at night can be magical at times). The sides?  I don't remember but that's fine, as long as they didn't get in the way of my meat.  I haven't been back here again but I have gone to Mortons, The Chop House, Ruth's Chris, etc.  Maybe it was the ""first time"" experience that I'll never forget.  This has definitely been the standard by which I measure all others.",0.9468,0.898,0.085,0.017,0.4906959706959707
