Even if you are not in the hotel as a guest, the lounge is accessible and a nice break from the day.  Typical prices, but friendly and attentive staff, and a good bar menu.  Great at happy hour or when you returning to the hotel n the evening.  Love this bar",0.9854,0.612,0.373,0.015,0.644090909090909
2010-01-03,4.0,"When you're used to patronizing establishments that *at best* have slightly stale popcorn available on request only, you get a real thrill of sitting down to a shiny silver dish of candied nuts.  New Years Day saw the next chapter of my search to find the perfect hotel lobby bar.  And as one might expect, The Four Seasons did not disappoint. Place has a damn chandelier inside their elevator, OK!?  Paul, the Irish bartender, is indeed spectacular. He was considerably busy that evening but made sure he made everyone feel welcome and each time I got to the bottom quarter of my glass he was already asking if I'd like another. Anticipation is the key to great service!  Honestly though, I'm a softie for the Irish. The man could have blasted the soda gun in my face and I would still have loved him. In fact I was once on the motorway in Dublin and this little kid was halfway out the window of his mum's car flipping off our car and all I could do was laugh and think ""Bless the feckin' Irish.""  I enjoyed a lovely eggnog and an Irish coffee and my faithful cohort again drank many glasses of a ""nice wet Scotch."" Not only was the pianist on duty tickling them ivories but a jazz singer as well! This is 2 for 3 that we've been treated to a free show at the lobby bar. We left sleepy and content. If you're looking for a cushy and refined evening I highly recommend the Seasons bar. Word of Warning: You probably shouldn't go here if you're an ardent PETA supporter because I've never seen so many fur coats in one place in my life. Thankfully I wasn't there for the people watching. I've had my fill of rich old bags.",0.9977,0.725,0.248,0.027,0.5479558745348219
2009-04-06,4.0,"Potentially country club/gentleman's cigar haven stuffy but a fantastic bartender made it comfortable and enjoyable. Cost to worth it ratio: 3 (pricier but expect that at the Four Seasons) Highlights: - Paul: our bartender. Irish, chatty, and cool. Excellent service and made it fun to hang out in the near empty lounge area.  - Atmosphere: large area with big chairs and a piano player. We ended up there cause it was cold outside and close to where we were, but was one of our favorite evenings out. - Drink menu: not just your average martinis. Had drinks like the auditini with elderflower liquor in it. Good and not too sweet. - Snacks: they give you nuts and a rice cracker wasabi peas mix. Lowlights: - Closes at 1: earlier than most and deserted come midnight at that. I'd stop by here again for a mellow few drinks... and to say hi to mr. bartender. :-)",0.9866,0.702,0.229,0.069,0.561607142857143
2008-02-09,5.0,"The best bartenders in Chicago, hands down.  I should know, I've spent more hours sitting in this bar waiting for my ""Big Time Hollywood Producer"" sister to come down from her hotel room than I care to remember.  On the plus side, if you have a lot of time to waste, as I invariably do when I'm here, this is a great place to do it. Tucked away behind the lobby and by the Seasons Cafe, this bar is muy civilized - this is the perfect place to come, drink scotch and people watch, very reminiscent of an old gentlemen's club where time has stood still.  Dimly lit, clubby, with incredibly comfortable seating that has been thoughtfully arranged.  I especially appreciate the fact that the chairs are low enough to the ground that my feet can reach - I'm a little on the wee side. Tables are spaced so you might catch intriguing bits and pieces of other table's conversations, but are far enough apart that you needn't worry about stifling your own.  Not a good place for large, boisterous parties, but perfect for drinking alone with a good book or with a small, well mannered group. Great snacks, little bowls of oriental snack mix with almonds are placed at every table and the bar and are refreshed regularly.  If you want something more substantial, you can order off the menu from the Cafe next door.  Tea service is also available and they serve it correctly, natch. Nice ladies room as well if you spend too long here. Waiters are unobtrusive yet friendly - I often wear jeans and sneakers into this uber-swank joint and they treat me with as much care and respect as they do the dripping with furs and diamonds crowd.  The aforementioned bartenders are incredible - while I'm a Hilton whore, I maintain that the Four Seasons (anywhere in the world) always has the best bartenders of any hotel, period.  They're nearly always Irish and they can all pour a perfect drink.  I've spent a lot of time chatting with these fellows over the years and they not only remember their customers, but they remember their drinks - bonus points.  Cocktails aren't terribly pricey, especially compared to what you would be paying at a club, but minus the annoying crowd.  In any case, the ambiance and service make it well worth it. Even if you don't have a slow moving relative staying here whom you are forced to spend hours waiting upon, it's certainly worth the trip if you are in the neighborhood and have some time to kill.",0.997,0.745,0.203,0.052,0.4913731979521453
