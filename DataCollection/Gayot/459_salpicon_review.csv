2016-08-15,5.0,"Last night, I wanted to share my FAVORITE restaurant in Old Town on Wells st. with friends. Salpicon is a Mexican restaurant but you won't find a boring burrito here. Salpicon has delicious food which somehow pops with a different flavor in every bite. What is interesting is the flavor comes from the food itself by using the freshest and highest quality fruits and vegetables including peppers and caramelized red onion all linking back to various traditional Mexican recipes as opposed to using tons of salts and butter or oils. Three of us had the Tiger Shrimp which came with a pilaf of white rice in the center and he shrimp circling. Sprinkled on top of the plate was finely chopped caramelized onion, avocado and cilantro. Actually a genius blend because when you picked up the mixture it became a totally different palatal experience. The creamy avocado and the bits of caramelized red onion made the rice a richer dish that set off the lightness of the shrimp which by the way tasted like mini grilled bits of lobster and folks, that's a compliment. My girlfriend ordered the filet which for a moment I was sad that I had not order the same. Wow, the large fillet, cooked to perfection and topped with chihuahua cheese and a splash of this meaty, spicy sauce. For the men, it was a bit of an extra boost to their masculinity when the waiter asked if they would like to try different, deeper, smoky types of tequila with each margarita we had. We ladies decided to stick with the lighter tequila which was so refreshing and light. They were a great way to start off the meal blending well with the appetizers we had. Fresh guacamole, flavorful civeche and a mushroom dish in an amazing,slightly spicy sauce that made you think you were eating meat. You put the mixture in freshly made corn tortillas and bam, melts in your mouth. Of course no goods meal goes without dessert so for the table I ordered the chocolate cake of holy goodness. It's this chocolate espresso cake with a warm fuggy middle spilling out and when mixed with the freshly made vanilla ice cream well, let's just say it was getting hot in there! Ha! It paired well with my vintage port that was sweet and delightful on the palate. I am telling you folks, you MUST visit Salpicon!",0.9976,0.794,0.191,0.015,0.47290100250626554

We all know that Mexican cuisine is taking over the world. Most American's have tasted about 10% of mexican food at best. They think Taco's, Burrito's and nachos. Few have had enchiladas or caldo's etc. Salpicon has such a diversity of regional cuisines that fly our eagle flag proudly. There is a consistent racism that ""Mexican food has to be cheap"".  Nonsense.  It isnt ""high"" cuisine, nonsense. Salpicon will show you the incredible diversity, history and beauty that is mexican cuisine today.  I had Salmon Tropical and my wife had Soft Shell Crabs in Mojo de Ajo. both were perfect.  Gracias a Salpicon y los meseros y su hospitalidad !

To start, my mom has an allergy to jalapeños and aversion to chiles- I called the restaurant and they said there was nothing they could do- (and pretty much every dish on the menu had some spicy thing). I said can't you make the sauces without these things? And they said no. ( so these aren't freshly made?) . They should really have notation next to the menu items or options to reduce spice as I doubt my moms the only one here.

2015-12-28,4.0,"Recently I have dined here twice. The first time was for brunch and it was lovely. I started with the Camerons al carbon. I really enjoyed this dish a lot. It was grilled Tiger Shrimp with two different sauces, a tomatillo and avocado and a roasted tomato and Chipotle sauce. Of the two sauces I preferred the later over the former. My next course I had the Omelet de huitlacoche. It consisted of corn mushrooms sautéed with onion, garlic and serrano chilies with some manchego cheese. The omelet had some nice heat to it. I finished my brunch with some refreshing pineapple and coconut sorbet. The next time I came for dinner and I was  not disappointed. I started with chips and guacamole. I ordered another appetizer and it was corn and portobello mushrooms in a bold earthy sauce and they were delicious. My main course the Costello de la naranja. It was a nice portion of boneless beef short ribs with a delicate gastrique of orange and habenero chilies served with asparagus and a puree of parsnips and potatoes. This dish was the star of the evening and I wouldn't hesitate to order it again. My dessert was a pear and mango tart that was tasty, but not cloyingly sweet. On both visits the service was gracious and professional. The ambiance is classy and upscale, yet comfortable. For those reviewers who commented negatively on the decor of the restaurant all I can say is that it certainly is not plush, posh or over the top trendy. Perhaps that is what they were expecting. I loved the Latin music which was a mix of salsa, older Mexican styles and current Mexican pop, such as Miguel Luis.

In the several days leading up to dinner, the staff was very accommodating of party changes, and so I arrived at the restaurant with a positive impression. This positive impression was immediately challenged, as our experience at Salpicon got off to a rocky start. The receptionist was unnecessarily pushy about the coat check and inconsistently applied his policy across the patrons. Additionally, Salpicon's menu doesn't indicate what items are spicy, which was a concern for several people in my party who are sensitive to spicy food. Despite these hurdles, the excellent service and great food turned the experience around for us. Typical of RW, one gets smaller portion sizes when ordering off the RW menu, but people were still full after their 3 courses, and everyone enjoyed their food.",0.9438,0.841,0.14,0.019,0.5531468531468532

We had the guacamole and ceviche to start - both were excellent.  We had the 'costillas de res a la naranja' and the 'pollo en mole poblano' for our main dishes and both were excellent - especially the costillas de res a la naranja.  The welcoming and energetic atmosphere in combination with the excellent food will bring us back.

2014-12-15,1.0,"Over the course of the last ten years, we have eaten at Priscilla Satkoff's restaurant five times. Each of the four previous visits was an absolute epircurean delight! Saturday's visit was an absolute disaster.   The service was weak and when commented on to the host, became boarderline abusive. Appetizers were forgotten, and when reminded, came out late and luke warm. The platos fuertes were o.k. at best, but certainly not up to the standards I remember. The funny thing is that it seemed like no one working in the restaurant cared.   Finally, we were celebrating our friend's birthday and anniversary, and asked if they could sing happy birthday, which they did, and then charged us $8.00 for what we did not order and should have been complementary. One would think that when spending over $250 on dinner, it might be important to either tell your customers you are going to charge them, or give them a piece of birthday cake and take the time to wish them happy birthday. Neither of these things happened.    We paid the bill and left, with absolutely no one acknowelging our departure or even thanking us for stopping in. I am a fan of voting with my wallet. I could tell by the pervasive ""I am doing you a favor"" attitude of the staff and empty tables, that others are as well. My advice...there are plenty of other Mexican places with excellent food in the city of Chicago.

2014-11-11,5.0,"My wife and I had dinner here last Wednesday before seeing a show at Second City. When we arrived we were enthusiastically greeted, door held open for us, and immediately ushered to our waiting table. The menu looked great, and the restaurant has a very nice, upscale, hip, cozy atmosphere. Our waiter Jose was great...came up to our table right away and was very nice and helpful. He explained the menu items, their extensive weekly specials, answered a few of our questions, and gave a great recommendation for his favorite margarita (which also wasn't one of the more expensive choices! ).  What really impressed me though, was how accommodating they were to an epic screw up on my part.  I have a severe allergy to peanuts and a pretty bad one to all other nuts, so I naturally stayed far away from any of the dishes with mole, but had decided to order the short ribs. The name of the dish was in Spanish but the description was in English, and no hint of peanuts or nuts there. I don't usually mention my allergy (to my wife's chagrin), especially if I'm ordering something where I am fairly certain is nut free.  I don't consciously omit my allergy, but it normally slips my mind, especially if it's something basic.  Worse case scenario, I can immediately tell before I eat a dish if it contains nuts.   Anyways, Jose came to take our order and I asked for the short ribs...or so I thought. When the food came out, my dish appeared to be a lamb shank with mole. Jose confirmed this, and when informed I had an allergy and wouldn't be able to eat it, he immediately brought me a new menu. At this point, I realized that I did indeed order the lamb shank with mole...I had just looked at the wrong menu item when ordering...totally my fault, and as my wife reminds me, had I let him know of my allergy, he would have caught my mistake before bringing out our food. Yes dear, you are correct :-)   I let him know that this was my fault completely and that I'd still pay for the lamb shank since it was my fault, but that, unfortunately, I wasn't able to reorder since we had a show to catch. At this point the owner came over and both he and Jose assured me that they could have the short ribs ready in 5 miinutes. Ok I said, and less then 5 minutes later I was eating the short ribs that I had originally intended, but failed, to order.  They were amazing! When the check came they also hadn't charged me for my mistake, and wouldn't hear of it any other way.  I was very impressed with how they handled the entire situation, most restaurants wouldn't have gone to the same lengths to make my dining experience so great. I left a big tip and we'll definitely be going back...so many other dishes to try!  Thanks so much for everything, and I highly recommend Salpicon. The food was incredible, and like I said, they have an extensive specials on their menu, along with a great selection on their normal menu.  M",0.9868,0.774,0.142,0.085,0.5357732605558693

That being said, Salpicón offers pretty good higher-end Mexican cuisine, not your everyday street tacos/tortas/tamales. The place has a very impressive tequila offer: some I had never actually send before and some TOP TOP quality tequilas, the kind of tequilas one rarely encounters.  The food was pretty good! Mexican restaurants abroad never taste quite like home, but this place was pretty close! The tinga tostadas and ceviche were awesome, great starters, the guacamole was just ok.  As a main I had the chiles rellenos: 2 stuffed poblano peppers, 1 with minced meat and 1 with cheese. I thought these were great! Altho a but spicy, fortunately that is easy to remedy, just push away the red salsa on too if the pepper.

2014-06-30,3.0,"This is a Mexican restaurant that does not have Mexican street fare. There are no tacos or burritos. In fact, there is no horchata either. That's an important point when visiting Salpicón and reviewing their menu and prices. Salpicón has labor-intensive, traditional Mexican food. The dishes have many steps and many hours of love invested in them. Perhaps because of my lack of understanding of Salpicón, I found the menu to be unapproachable. Besides the food, they also had an overwhelming variety of traditional lime margaritas made with a million kinds of tequila. It wasn't flavored like other Mexican joints: no mango, strawberry, or horchata flavored drinks. The prices soared above that of any other Mexican restaurant I know and the dishes were largely unfamiliar. The ambiance in Salpicón is cool and hip. In a word Salpicón would be luminescence. It feels modern and electric with bright colors but dim lighting. Our server was timely, helpful, and made suggestions without pressuring us to order stuff. I have this notion that Mexican restaurants should be warm, lively, and friendly; however, Salpicón is none of those things. We liked our food: jalapeños rellenos de queso capeados, guacamole picado, camarones al mojo de ajo, and pescado tártaro. It was all delicious - especially the pescado tártaro which was tuna tartare. The jalapeños packed a solid spice punch and the guacamole was chunky as apposed to mashed or blended. In the end we were listless about Salpicón mostly because it didn't fit into our preconceived notion of a Mexican restaurant. It's hard to envision an occasion when we would seek this sort of restaurant. It's not exactly a casual place for chilling with friends. It's not innovative enough for a culinary adventure and the prices make it seem as if it should be fancier than it is.

I've made it a point of visiting Salpicón for the past 18 months every time I am in town, which lately has been every other weekend.  It's a great neighbourhood find, one with a friendly staff and excellent food.  Maybe it's my latino background and the fact that I communicate with them in Spanish that nothing gets lost in translation and have yet to have any problems.  My partner and I never make a reservation and have always sat at the bar.  On one of our visits on a Saturday night, both floors were packed and we had to eat at the upstairs bar, even on that occasion service was well paced and not rushed, thus allowing us time to enjoy our margaritas (shaken on the rocks), they have an extensive selection of tequilas.   In terms of food, last weekend I had the rack of New Zealand baby lamb and for the first time I cleaned my plate.  I usually tend to only eat half of the entrée and save the rest for my flight back to LAX the following day, but the lamb was cook to perfection and the sauce was finger licking good.  It was so delicious I could not resist saving the other half.   Other dishes that are worth trying are the ""codornices en salsa de chile con miel""  (quail) which I ate with my hands and lick the fingers clean (again!).  As much as I love chocolate, I am not a fan of mole, BUT somehow Priscilla manages to make the sauce wonderful and complex in her ""pollo en mole poblano"", must be her grandma's recipe.  You can't go wrong with ""camarones al mojo de ajo"".   For entremeses, don't miss the seviche, almost as good as mine.  The ""tostaditas de tinga"" are so rich and delicious that it can constitute a whole meal if you have a salad along with it.  ""Camarones al carbón"" is another one of our favorites.

I wondered . . . . .would it be as good as I remembered? Well the answer is an emphatic YES! We were able to get a reservation outside on the patio which was perfect.  Our server was terrific- offering up suggestions on her favorite tequilas and how I might end up with the perfect margarita, which after the day I had had, seemed exactly what I needed. What also hit the spot was the great ceviche and guacamole that my friend and I shared.  Served with chips, these two items were the perfect start. For my entree, I was thrilled to hear that they had soft shelled crab ( a fav of mine) served with rice and my friend went with her favorite of the grilled shrimp.  Both were very good. It's important to note that Salpicon is not a low priced American/Mexican joint.  Rather a restaurant that serves upscale Mexican food.  I heard some grumbling at the next table as I think they thought they were going to have tacos and cheap margaritas.  Such is not the case at Salpicon. And to satisfy our sweet tooth- I went with three scoops of ice cream ( the coconut and caramel were my fav) and my friend had the sorbet. Parking has gotten a lot easier in the area too with the new parking garage that opened up across the street.  It'll coast you $14 but worth the price not to keep driving around.

A note: if you are looking for a private dining room, this is one of only a handful in Chicago that offer a bar, some windows, AND a bathroom right there. Some of the rooms we initially looked at would have had the people walking all the way through the main dining area to use the bathroom. OK, onto the show. We created a limited menu: 4 or 5 appetizers, 4 main courses, 5 or so sides, 3 or 4 desserts. There was something for everyone here. We had margaritas for each person that walked in the door. For those that wanted wine instead, we had three choices: a cab, a phenomenal pinot noir, and a great white. For those who couldn't decide between wine and margies (like me), you got both. Also, there are over 100 tequilas to choose from, so there is ample opportunity to drink way too much good alcohol. While we were all standing around talking, the passed hors dourves included sopes rusticos and tostaditas de tinga. Both are excellent with multiple flavors happening at once. They are also great finger food...as opposed to something like seviche, which I like, but would have been a disaster as an hors dourves. Dinners included the filet with tomatillo sauce which was delicious. I had it with a cab, someone else at my table had the same but with the pinot noir, and we both were happy. Chef came out to greet us and talk a bit which I thought was nice, and the evening went really well.

Every dish was overpowered by one particular flavour, whether it be coriander, garlic, chilli - just horrid.  The shrimp, filete and pork were all overcooked.  I had ordered a filete medium rare, when it arrived it was medium well, I pointed this out to the waitress as it's not how I enjoy my meat.

I was hungry and my friends were getting to the end of their meals (which they weren't enjoying) so I started to eat the over-cooked steak believing I had been forgotten about.  The waitress eventually returned and said they could cook me a new steak in 10 minutes. Too late! By this stage we'd all given up trying to eat our meals, they were revolting.  When I declined she said they would do something else for me to make up for it.  Nothing was done, no discount, no free drink or offer of dessert.

But that's where this good review stops. The meal was overpriced. Our total bill was over $200 (more about this later) and we each only got one drink each. Hardly any vegetarian options. No one was very impressed with the quality of the meal. It was only a couple of weeks later that I looked at my credit card statement and noticed a huge charge from Salpicon! Almost $100 more than what I signed for! Of course, I didn't have a receipt, and my CC company said they would need proof I was overcharged. So, I called Salpicon. The woman on the phone couldn't assist me, but said she would pass along the concern. Almost a week later, I get a call from a Salpicon representative. As it turns out, instead of using the 15% tip I wrote on the bill, the waiter charged my credit card with a ""tip"" of the cost of the bill! So I was charged 2X the bill! Incredible. Thankfully I looked at my cc statement to catch this really bad mistake on Salpicon's part. I'm not sure if the waiter did this intentionally and thought he would get away with it, but either way, it's bad. To add insult to injury, they made the same ""mistake"" on the other couple's bill we dined with!

2013-02-11,3.0,"Salpicon serves five-star food, and if I were the chef, I would be livid to know that I was creating such amazing dishes in a restaurant that appears mismanaged and has bafflingly poor service. I would not recommend this restaurant, unless perhaps you came here on a weeknight when it's less busy or if you can handle the work involved in tracking down your server. I dined here on a Saturday night for Chicago Restaurant Week, and my first disappointment was the pricing.  If you don't double check against the regular menu, you may not see that you're actually getting screwed -- that for several combinations, it would be cheaper to order off the regular menu instead of their prix fixe menu. Take, for example, what my friend ordered off of their $44 menu: $10 seviche + $20 tinga poblana + $8 pastel tres leches This is only $38 on their regular menu, but, if you are fortunate enough to dine here during Chicago Restaurant Week and not catch the pricing error, you'll pay $44, as she did. What a rip off. My boyfriend had the best deal of the night with the $13 scallops and the $33 quail. My selection was the scallops, the duck, and the chocolate espresso cake (which is $47 on the regular menu, so I saved three bucks). Pricing annoyance aside, each of these was absolutely amazing. The cake was so rich and ooey gooey, and the bacon-wrapped scallops were too die for, and I'm not even particularly fond of bacon (shocking, I know!). But, then, there was the service. One friend said that we saw our waiter four times during the meal -- that's four times for a three-course meal plus an additional appetizer. I don't want to rip into him, because I know Salpicon was busy and I know everyone has off nights. But for a meal that cost roughly $75 per person with drinks and gratuity, I don't think it's too much to ask of the server that he come back and check on us and ask us if we would like another drink. My friend's margarita glass sat empty for at least fifteen minutes. We all would have had at least one more round of drinks had we actually been able to get some service. I don't know what to make of their Restaurant Week pricing -- either they really didn't know what they were doing when they priced it, or they were hoping to take advantage of naive diners. I don't actually think the food is overpriced ordinarily, so I didn't need the price break to eat here, but it was certainly what drew us in. And that just felt sketchy. Add to that the flaky server, and I can only give this three stars. My apologies to the chef. If only there were a better way to sample your delicacies.",0.9795,0.837,0.101,0.062,0.42800816907959766

The drink menu features a smoky margarita that tastes unlike any other you've ever had. For oenophiles, there's a fairly extensive wine list and a cellar upstairs that's worth seeing for yourself.

Initial offering of chips and salsa/guacamole, check. But once I got my plate, it took a nosedive and flatlined from there. I opted for the pork chop with what the menu called ""earthy Oaxacan chile ancho mole."" Sounded good! But what I got was a tough, chewy, bland, criminally under-seasoned chop sitting in a pool of the most watery mole I have seen in my life. With a mole sauce that might more aptly be called ""water with a hint of mole flavor"", and a pork chop with less seasoning than a tortilla chip, I would almost say this dish was entirely lacking in flavor. But I would be forgetting about the burnt taste from the charred grill marks. That burnt taste dominated the entire dish, and it stayed on my taste buds the entire night. And to top it off, when I got the bill, it turns out they charged $8 for the chips and salsa/guacamole which I thought were complimentary! In all, a major disappointment. Based on that, I would never come back to this place. Except maybe to steal my money back, which would be justified because they essentially stole it from me.

We skipped dessert, and this is not a cheap resturant so be prepared to shell out more then your average price for dinner.  When the food and the service are good enough, I dont mind paying more.

Our waiter was very funny, fast talking and good at his job, he took a look at me and determined what tequila I would like and I went with that and it was delicious!  I finished out the meal with a second Margarita with a different and delicious tequila, also per our waiters recommendation. For our main my boyfriend had the Colorado lamb loin chops with a spinach and cheese tamale. He said this was pretty good, cooked medium rare to his liking but the pasilla chile sauce drizzled throughout the dish was too bitter and not the kind of sauce he was looking for to slather his lamb in. The tamale was tasty. The dish was good but not overly exciting or creative.  While good not a total winner. I had the Sockeye salmon with grapefruit,  grilled corn, avocado, cilantro and other delicious accoutrement. The salmon was our waiters recommendation and it was very very good. I was very pleased, the avocado, corn and grapefruit all worked very well together and the fish was incredibly moist and flavorful.

All in all, great food, not so great service and terrible with the rushed meal, the meal coming out cold and not enough attention to patrons that tip you based on your attention to detail.   Only 2 stars, maybe I will try again, but doubtful since there are too many Mexican places in a city that is known to have many great restaurants.",0.9715,0.859,0.092,0.049,0.5312368972746332

2011-12-01,3.0,"If you do not want to read the whole thing......enjoyed some amazing margarita's, bold and unique dishes that were large in size and experienced some real bad service.  If i could give them 3.5 stars I would. So on my vaca/food tour of Chicago my friend recommended we hit up one of his favorite spots in town.  For months I have heard him rave about the amazing tequila menu and large and hearty portions.  Once seated our server informed us that if we would be ordering a margarita let him know how you like your tequila; smokey, sweet, etc (etc cause that is all I remember) and he would recommend one to create a Margarita Jimmy B would be proud of! They came and they were amazing.  Not sure what else to say...I tasted all five of the margarita's at the table and they were all great, 5 stars all around. My party of five ordered the following appetizers: Trio de Tamalitos, Guacamole Picado,Ceviche and some sort of shrimp cocktail. The Trio de Tamalitos were good.  The best I have ever had? No, but def not the worst...overal prob a 3.5 on the scale.  The Marlin Ceviche was full of flavor and the portion size was large. At least 4 stars. The Guac was above average with robust flavors, overall a 4 as well.  Now for the black sheep of the family, the shrimp dish.  Again I apologize for not fully remembering but it was billed as a shrimp cocktail type dish and came out more like a tomato gazpacho with pieces of shrimp in it.  Flavor wish good but just totally not what the person who ordered it thought they were getting.  At the end of the night we actually asked our waiter to take it off the tab since we touched none of it and it was far from the description.  They did with out a problem...hats off. Now for the main event.  After appetizers service started to get a little shotty.  We were checked on rarely and were constantly looking for our server to get drinks refilled.  For entrees I remember the following were ordered...... Chiles Rellenos, BBQ Quail, I had the Duck 2 ways and I am drawing a black on the last dish ordered.  All portions were amazingly large. My table was all about sharing our entrees so I had a large portion of the Duck and tastes of the other dishes.  The Chiles Rellenos were really good.  So good that I wish i actually ordered that.  At least a 4 in my book.  The Quail was the wild card of the night for me.  The portion on this plate was huge.  It had to be more then one Quail.  The rub and sauce was very unique, in a good way.  It was a bit interesting trying to eat this tasty bird.  Maybe it was just me but having to pick up and eat the Quail ""fried chicken"" style with my hands was a bit messy and I felt a little weird doing so while everyone else was eating fork and knife style.  This had no impact on my rating though, super tasty and overall a 4. Now for my duck.  I am a sucker for duck so I had to order it.  The Duck was served two ways.  One was a breast which was presliced the other a pile of shredded Duck confit.  I would of liked the Duck skin to be a little crispier but that is a common problem I find when ordering Duck.  I forget what dish came with a side of spinach (i think the quail) but it was freaking amazing. Top 3 spinach's I have ever had. The service continued to be spotty but the worst was to come.  As you can see via my review most dishes received a 4 but due to the awful service I had to lower it to 3. Despite not wanting to wait any longer we decided to order dessert since a couple of us were craving flan.  The flan was just ok, def not the best will go with a 3 but no higher. It took prob 15-20 minutes to get our bill at the end of the night.  It was the last straw after having to wait all night to get drink refills and plates.  It was a shame the service was so poor.  The food was not the greatest but most dishes we good and the flavor profiles were amazing.  I left Salpicons wanting to experience more just on a different day with a different server. Bottom Line:  Amazing Margarita's, unique flavors on interesting dishes and so-so/bad service.  Hopefully you get them on a good service day.  Have a drink eat some food and let me know if you find there dishes as unique and tasty as I did.",0.996,0.792,0.143,0.065,0.5765499533146592

We wanted to show off our city a little, but still enjoy oursleves and not be too stuffy.

Our server took our order competently enough, but brought the wrong drink, and then delivered my husband's cold ceviche appetizer a full 10 minutes before delivering the warm apps the other 3 of us ordered, forcing him to sit there and ignore his food.  The fact that his was cold but was sent out alone is BIZARRE, as OBVIOUSLY it could have waited in the fridge while our hot apps were prepared.  But in any case, what kind of self-respecting restaurant sends out a table's food one guest at a time?? By the way - The place was empty, so it's not like the staff were harried or rushed.  In fact, watching them from across the room, as they hung out joking and ambling around slowly and purposelessly, you'd have thought the place was closed. My hot app was a queso fundido that was supposed to come with tortillas.  My guests split an app that was also eaten with tortillas, and the server brought one little basket of 4 tortillas and put it between my guests on the far side of the table. I said, 'excuse me, I think I was meant to have tortillas also?' And he just POINTED TO THEIR TORTILLAS.  So...  I politely asked for one of their tortillas, which they gave me, and then none of us were able to finish our apps because we ran out of tortillas long before we ran out of toppings.  Seriously, dude? You're charging me $10 for melted cheese, but I can't have some tortillas of my own?? Our mains were weird. My lamb shank was fork-tender but drowned in a sharp mole that didn't go well, and accompanied by three raw rings of onion spread on the plate (?).  My side was a watery, bland soupy saucer of tepid beans, bacon fat and some limp pepper rings.  Um... what? At one point ( maybe to distract us from the weird food?), the bartender DRAGGED an open-top garbage can through the center of the dining room and right past us.  Classy. Later, our server leaned against a wall and chatted with the bartender  for 15 minutes as all four of us sat with dirty plates in front of us cutlery long-since laid down, waiting to have the table cleared.  Eventually he wandered past us and my husband caught his attention and said ""I think we're done here.."" and the server replied, almost quizically, ""You want me to take this?.."" ??!!! No dude. I want to uncomfortably sit here and stare at the mole as it dries on my half-eaten lamb for ANOTHER quarter of an hour.

We had no reservations and it was a Saturday, so we had to wait awhile which was no problem. The issues started after we were seated. Even though we waited a good 40 minutes when we sat down no one came to see us. We sat looking around, trying to figure out who was supposed to be helping us. I ended up looking sadly at the Hostess finally. I would like to credit her, she was very nice and went beyond her job grabbing us drinks and appetizers. We enjoyed those, they had good drinks, and then waited some more. Meanwhile the table next to us had three different people refilling wine glasses and bring food and even chatting them up. I worked in a bar and grill, so I get expecting younger people not to tip as well but to be this blatant and unapologetic about it was astonishing. We finally got our food, which was oddly luke-warm like they had forgot to bring it out right away. Mine and my sister's roomie were the same thing which was the two peppers stuffed with potatoes and the other stuffed with mushrooms. The potato one was fine, not great but pretty tasty however the mushroom one was really inedible. It had kind of a dirt taste from the mushrooms and... that was it. It really, really needed salt. There was a green pepper sauce that also had no flavor, like very mild pepper and lots of water. I wanted to mention to someone that the second pepper was really not good but, no one ever came to speak to us. My sister had to force the waiter to take her credit card (literally, he tried to say no and walk away, who does that?) On top of that, they messed up my sister's order and brought her vegetarian ones (the vegetarian who got her meat one had a tantrum later) however, they were pretty good.

I would understand if it was packed and we were taking up her table from other people, or it was written somewhere that you HAD to order an entree to sit at a table but none of these were the case.  Food was decent, decor was cool but she certainly ruined my dining experience.  Then after leaving more than a 20% tip (still asking myself why I did that) she didn't even say goodbye, come back and see us,  or have a good night...nothing.

2011-06-18,1.0,"Salpicón was not worth the cost of food or the drive over there.  It sounded a lot better on paper than the food actually was. The menu is nice with a wide variety of items.  However, there is one commonality amongst all the dishes: extreme amounts of salt.  We ordered the squash blossom and goat cheese special and the marlin ceviche to start with. The ceviche was ehh; I couldn't taste the fish at all; the only flavors were salt and lime. The chips it came with were mediocre.  For entrées we ordered the pollo molé (which I had high hopes for) and the tinga poblano. The chicken was cooked fine but the molé sauce wasn't as complex in flavor as it should be. I tasted spice and salt; there was no earthiness or savoriness about the sauce. The tinga poblano is a pork tenderloin served on top of chorizo-chipotle sauce and surrounded by an avocado poblano sauce. The pork was cooked PERFECTLY; it was probably the best part of the entire dish(and meal) but the sauces were both too salty. The green avocado sauce didn't even taste like avocado or poblano; all it tasted like was cilantro and lots and LOTS of salt. The chorizo sauce was a bit salty, but that can be forgiven, since chorizo is a cured sausage. But there was no depth in that sauce either.  I'm used to this type of food to have lots of flavors and make you want to keep eating. Unfortunately, Salpicón's food definitely does not deliver anything that made me want to continue eating.  Also the service was sub par, at best. The waitress came by right after we sat down and asked if we had decided what we wanted to drink and eat. When we asked for a couple minutes to look at the menu, she seemed taken aback.  When she did come back, I asked her to describe for me what the double cut pork chop dish tasted like since I had never had Oaxacan molé and how the tinga publano tasted. Her response was the pork chop comes with bones so ""if you don't mind wrestling with bones, get that. Otherwise, get the tinga.""  How that relates to flavor still escapes me.  When our food did come, no one came by to check on us to see if everything was fine. While I don't personally care for when waiters are stopping by your table every 2-3 minutes to make sure the food is fine, I have never been to a fine dining restaurant where the wait staff didn't come by even once to check.  All in all, I had been excited to try out Salpicon. The menu looks amazing. But the food, flavor and service fail miserably at delivering a decent experience.

Some dishes are straight up French.  The fusion was rather superficial - seemed more like a forced afterthought.  Overall, it makes me feel that the restaurant doesn't have a coherent point of view, and the attempted fusion is not very sophisticated.  I don't want to have to ""order the right things"" to get the concept of the restaurant - I want every dish to speak for itself.  This is something I think Salpicon needs.   Decor is vibrant, but not very designed or sophisticated.  I guess they are not really going for the fine-dining ambiance.  Service is good.  Our waiter was very friendly and made many good suggestions.  Though at one point the owner was complaining to the seating hostess about some customer who had called earlier.  He was kind of flustered and loud, and we couldn't help but overhear the entire conversation.  Not an ideal situation to say the least.",0.9936,0.713,0.196,0.091,0.48963915517107004

I loved how all of the walls were painted a different color. The bar was casual and the tables were spaced nicely (not all crammed together). We talked to who I am assuming is the owner and he was very nice. It was obvious he was proud of the place, but not in an obnoxious way. He said they had another level upstairs that looked almost exactly like the downstairs. Very nice man. I took advantage of the restaurant week menu!! For my appetizer I chose the gorditas divorciadas. Honestly, I could have made my entire meal out of these. There were two different salsas on the beef...I preferred the guajillo to the serrano-tomatillo ( a little less spicy). For my main dish I had Camarones al Mojo de Ajo (Grilled tiger shrimp in a sweet garlic and olive oil sauce with avocado chunks and guajillo chiles; served with white rice). The shrimp were cooked perfectly. I loved every bite of it. The meals are served with delicious homemade corn tortillas (my fav). Dessert was the weak point of the meal (or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing). I chose the cinnamon crepe filled with mango and raspberry.

I appreciate that they are more on the ""gourmet"" side of Mexican - no gloppy melted cheese here.  What I like - service is typically very good. The Mole is also excellent - deep and rich flavors, this is not the typical soupy mess, but has nice layers of flavor with an undertone of bite which really works well. Fish specials are also usually good - this weekend they had a walleye special which was very nice though I usually don't think much of walleye. This had a terrific Olive based preparation which worked very well with the fish. Any of the cornmeal based appetizers have been good - the duo of tamales this weekend (one w/red sauce and one w/green) was really yummy.  It's nice they do a good job of letting you order a margarita with your choice of tequila and liqueur (grand marnier, cointreau, etc), but it would be nice if they let you adjust the sweetness as well.

2010-10-12,2.0,"While I could say as a vegetarian I didn't give this restaurant a fair shot personally, I was in a group that did order their other dishes and I made sure to collect feedback from all.  We were seated at a table upstairs on the 2nd floor and I believe Vince was the host downstairs and Priscila was the hostess upstairs. The personal touch was very warm and welcoming! Our server was quite the character though - upon seating, he immediately launched himself into an extremely long and fast monologue about youth, middle and old age, and it took us all quite some time until we guessed that he might be talking about the age of tequila for the margaritas.  So we went ahead and ordered our first round of margaritas as so many reviews had talked about them! Even before our first drinks were out, our server had already started to discuss and push for our second round of drink orders! But that wasn't even when we started to realize what a character our server was - simply put, he had ADD, and would start saying something to our table, then walk over to another to greet them, when we called him back he'd stop by but with zero memory of what he had just told us and what more information we had asked him to help us with (vegetarian recommendations), and would then start chatting with another table, and then come back and seem cross with us for taking so long to order!  Upon our server's recommendation, which we finally were able to get through, we ordered a few appetizers and a few entrees (avoiding politely the trap aka up-sell of over-ordering). The guacamole was probably the only one item that stood out from the 3 appetizers and 2 entrees we ordered for the 3 of us vegetarians. The appetizers that the non-vegetarian folks ordered weren't too bad but their entrees were a lot less impressive.  Both our vegetarian entrees ended up being stuffed chiles (I guess the server's recommendations weren't so helpful after all) - one entree was one pepper with cheese, the other was two peppers with potatoes stuffed in one and no one knows what stuffed in the other. The food was very so-so/ a-ok...  We were getting late for a movie (which we had tried to tell our MIA server and some others repeatedly to no avail) and therefore we ended up having no time for dessert.

It's a gorgeous spot, first of all, and the atmosphere is really home-y, in spite of renovations. I'm sure that once the downstairs reopens it is going to be amazing too. I drink margaritas maybe once or twice a year; I usually find them too sweet, too syrupy and just not really my thing. I tried a margarita here, made with tequila, lime juice, Cointreau and agave nectar. It was divine! Not too sweet, and the flavor of the tequila was really enhanced by how it was mixed. For starters, we had tostaditos, which were four mini corn tortilla, with a nice little mound of marinated pork on top and a touch of cream. So flavorful - absolutely delicious. We also tried the crabcake, which was served in an avocado puree. The crabcake was light and flaky, with just a touch of panko to hold it together. For dinner I had the grilled shrimp, and my boyfriend had a halibut wrapped in strings of sweet potato. The seafood was super fresh, and moist. So many flavors, but all worked well together. Both were served with a small pyramid mound of rice. A very nice touch. Salpicon also has one of the biggest wine books I've ever seen. A very impressive collection. We decided to take the chef's suggestion with our meal, which was an Oregon Pinot Noir. It went perfectly with the food and was a beautiful bold Pinot - not like some wimpy ones I've had in the past. Dessert was a mango pear tart with caramel ice cream. Every bite was like a little taste of heaven. This restaurant is a must for anyone looking for super high-end Mexican. We ended up leaving with their cookbook, and enjoyed just reading the recipes. I'm sure we'll try some of them out - but for now, I'm just savoring the memory of this delicious meal.",0.9964,0.784,0.196,0.02,0.6238562091503269

The first floor is currently being remodeled but the second floor is just as nice. The wait staff here is extremely knowledgeable about the food and tequila menu. The drinks are reasonably priced and the extra couple bucks for a premium margarita is well worth it. The Tiger shrip with melted Chihuahua Cheese is a must for an appetizer and the duck in a raspberry vinaigrette is best entree I've tried there.  Would recommend this restaurant for any occasion. We went as a part of a party of ten once and last time was a party of 3. Service was the same either way. Great food for a reasonable price!,0.9906,0.737,0.263,0.0,0.4118421052631578

Upon arrival, you are usually greeted by one of the proprietors - Priscilla (chef) or Vincent (wine director) - which is a really nice touch. Keep in mind that this is refined Mexican. If you are expecting enchiladas or burritos, don't come here. My husband and I have loved everything we've ordered (and we've been here 10+ times). If you like some spice, get the beef tenderloin. I had it last night and it is fantastic. Aaron (our favorite waiter) said it is one of the spiciest dishes on the menu.  All of the dishes have great flavor, but some are more subtle than others. The ingredients are super fresh and I think that is especially apparent with the guacamole. It is simple, fresh and good. Not spicy, but the salsa that comes with it makes up for that. The margaritas are fantastic and the tequila selection is crazy. I (almost) wish the margs weren't as good because the wine list is fantastic. We've only ordered wine by the glass because we can't avoid ordering a margarita (or two), but the wine has been excellent (and the recommendations/pairings are spot-on).  The entrees are a bit expensive ($18-$28), but they are such a treat that they are worth it. Don't even know which one to recommend - tuna, soft shell crab (in season), chile rellenos, pork, lamb, beef. You really can't go wrong.  Ask for advice from your waiter or waitress - they are fantastic and can definitely help guide you through the menu! If you are looking for something a bit lighter on the wallet (and the stomach), we find it nice to belly up to the bar on a weeknight and have a margarita and an appetizer or two. The appetizer options are varied and everything is delicious - seviche, tortilla soup, jalapeno rellenos, tostaditas de tinga. Yum!! Yum!! Yum!!

The food, Mexican ""fusion"" cuisine (I don't really know what that means), blew me away. I expected trendy, but not that tasty. I was given one of the most delicious shrimp entrées I've ever had in my life. I highly recommend ordering the Camarones al Mojo de Ajo. The tiger shrimp are beautifully plated with chunks of avocado and chiles and served with white rice. My aunt ordered the same thing and we both agreed it raised the bar on under appreciated Mexican seafood. I also recommend ordering the guacamole appetizer if you don't mind ordering it twice... while delicious, they don't really supply you with much. I would consider the appetizer a tease that should probably be priced for less. Now what makes me hesitant on giving this restaurant a 5 star rating?  As soon as I entered I felt a little uncomfortable; the lobby is  excruciatingly tiny and the host/hostess was rather cold. Almost all the tables were empty, yet it took 3 minutes to actually be seated... I found this to be a little odd, but not a huge concern.

By the end of the night, we were pretty tired of hearing him push table after table into something they weren't sure they wanted.

The margaritas/tequila were awesome, albeit spendy. Definitely order one, don't go back for two, three, or four unless you have some deep pockets.

We arrived on time and were not seated until 915pm. the bar was packed (and small) so we had to wait in the ""lobby"" area which is just a small hallway outside of the main restaurant door. at that time there were 8 of us waiting in the ""lobby"" and it was CRAMPED. where do they put the overflow people waiting for a table????  now on to the good...i mean GREAT!  service - as soon as we sat down we were greeted by a sommelier. he handed us the bible of wines but we passed and went straight for the margaritas. and let me tell you, this was the BEST margarita on the rocks (w/ salt) i have ever had. i would 100% recommend the El Diamante del Cielo tequila (10.25)...holy smooth, batman! our waiter was awesome as well. he came over frequently to check up (but not toooooo frequently) and he always folded our napkin if we left the table for any reason. if we were in mid conversation he also would not interrupt. i wish i caught his name...  food - LOVED it (however, not as much as my absolute favorite mexican restaurant de cero...NOTHING beats the taco platter). i had the trio de sopes, camarones al mojo de ajo (grilled shrimp), and pastel de chocolate y espresso (chocolate espresso cake). oh. my. god. DELISH!  ambiance - small, intimate, w/ vibrant colors. loud but i was never forced to shout. i would enjoy eating here again during the summer on their sidewalk. what is better than margaritas on a hot summer day while people watching on wells street?

2010-02-28,3.0,"My husband and I have been wanting to try Salpicon for a number of years and finally decided to go for it because we had the perfect storm of incentives: opentable points, $10 gift certificate through ala card AND Restaurant Week. Yippee! I did the Restaurant Week menu, but my husband did not because it just wasn't the best value, plus he didn't want his own dessert. Depending on what you order, you may not be saving much, if any, money at all (all items on the RW menu are on the regular menu so you should calculate whether or not it's worth it).    For appetizers we had the Seviche and the Gorditas. Seviche was very good - nicely balanced, and the marlin had a great texture. Gorditas were also yummy. Entrees were pretty disappointing to be honest. The cod (veracruzana) was not as flaky as you might expect, and the roasted tomato, olive and caper sauce was only ok. The pork (tinga poblana) sounded awesome (""atop a roasted tomato-chipotle sauce with chorizo and potatoes, surrounded by a cool avocado-tomatillo sauce""), but, surprisingly, just wasn't all that flavorful. HOWEVER, the fabulous dessert we had was reason enough to return. It was a pear and mango cobbler with cajeta ice cream. I saw it on other tables and before I even knew what the beautiful little rectangular tartlet was, I knew I wanted it. The ""cobbler"" consisted of a crunchy shortbread crust filled with meltingly soft pears and mangos, topped with roughly chopped almonds and the caramel-y ice cream. Eating all those textures and flavors together was perfection. To be honest, I don't even really like fruit desserts, but I would choose this over chocolate any day! It's the best dessert I've had in a long time, which would explain why I may have dreamt about it last night... Service was fine - efficient but not particularly warm. Food came out too quickly (apps came about 3 minutes after ordering).

2009-12-11,3.0,"My fiancee and I dined here recently, and we left feeling pretty good about the place. Overall I would definitely go back again, if for nothing more than the margaritas alone. We are not wine people, so we didn't have any use for the giant book listing all their thousands of wines. But I DID get a kick out of looking for the highest priced wines in there (the highest I saw was $3,250 for a bottle). I actually didn't do any of the tequilas outside of my margaritas, but they seemed to have a very good selection (pricing ranged from $12-$35 per flight). Food wise, we were very disappointed by the size of our ""tostaditas de tinga"" appetizer, which was literally 4 tortilla chips with meat on them, for $7. Granted, they were pretty good, but I could have eaten all four in about 20 seconds. Our two main dishes consisted of chiles rellenos for her and chuleta de puerco for me. The chiles rellenos seemed to get rather soggy by the end of her meal, but apparently that is not an uncommon problem with those no matter what restaurant you're at. The chuleta (which is a pork chop) was excellent - the food had a great presentation and (unlike the appetizer) was not too small for my appetite. Overall, I was happy with the chuleta and glad I didn't order the chiles rellenos.  I've seen some of the other reviews saying the service was spotty, and some people have commented that they felt the place was a bit snobby. We didn't get that feeling at all - we were happy with our server and were checked on pretty regularly. And there were no issues with getting our drinks refilled or anything like that. The place itself is very small, so I would definitely recommend getting a reservation before going. The bathroom is TINY, and can only fit one person, which is annoying. Also there is only a VERY small ""bar"" area, and barely any seats, so this isn't really an inviting place that you would go to for drinks only. That's disappointing, because with their extensive tequila menu I could envision going back there without having dinner in mind. Those things, along with the somewhat expensive price (you'll probably run about $100 for 2 people, not counting wine) led me to go with 3 stars instead of 4.

2009-03-10,1.0,"Overall, Salpicon was truly a sub par dining experience.   While the tequila and wine menus were very extensive, the food and service were some of the worst I've experienced in Chicago.  Our waitress was conceited and rude, snapping at some of our party when they were whispering about the menu while she was reviewing the specials.  She seriously stopped in the middle of explaining the specials, confronted the two people who were whispering and asked if they would like her to continue to explain the specials of the evening in a very rude and condescending tone. I was shocked.  I guess since we were a party of more than 5 she was going to get the automatic gratuity so what does she care.  I ordered the seviche which was extremely salty and flavorless (beyond the salt of course), think salted cod with diced tomato and onions.  I then ordered the stuffed peppers which were both completely void of any flavor.  I was not aware food could be so bland, they should have used some of the salt from the seviche and put it on the peppers!  The flan, however, was good, and was encased in an interesting spun sugar dome.  But I would not endure this restaurant experience again for the flan alone.   I would not recommend this restaurant to any family, friends, associates, coworkers, acquaintances, or enemies.  Stay away, there are hundreds of better options in the city.",0.418,0.804,0.1,0.097,0.5743137254901961

2009-02-11,2.0,"I went here on Saturday night before a show at Second City. We go to Adobo Grill pretty regularly, but I'm always more enamored with the margaritas and guac there than the actual food. So it was that we decided to try Salpicon. The wine list is pretty fantastic, but I'm not usually down for dropping a couple hundreds of dollars on a bottle of wine (in fact, I'm never down for that), so I had to order off their measly by-the-glass menu. My boyfriend and sister ordered margaritas, though, which were absolutely fantastic. The food? One of three meals on the table was good. I ordered the fresh seasonal fish, which was tilapia. It was grilled and came served with fresh pico de gallo and white rice. It was very bland and the fish was so dry. If we weren't in a hurry to catch the show, I would have sent it back, which is something I NEVER do having worked in food service before. But this fish just sucked. The pico de gallo was not saucy or juicy enough to make both the dry rice and the dry fish edible. In fact, the pico de gallo was a bit dry itself!  My sister ordered Chiles Doña Queta, essentially stuffed peppers--vegetarian relatives of the chile rellenos on their menu (even though most chile rellenos are veggie to begin with). This was also very disappointing. Not much flavor, underseasoned... I guess I just expected more. My boyfriend, on the other hand, ordered one of their specials. It was chicken coated in many great spices and it was so juicy and delicious! My sister and I were both eating off his plate.  So, since Chicago is definitely not lacking in upscale Mexican food, I think I'll pass next time. My visits to Adobo, Frontera, Nacional 27, and Zocalo have all been far better than this.",0.9921,0.831,0.143,0.025,0.5212201979307242

2009-02-08,1.0,"Quite possibly, the worst dining experience I've had in Chicago.  I've had better service at a taco bell, and I've had better food from the frozen section of Jewel. If there was an option for zero stars, I would have given zero! I arrived to find an okay decor, colorful but yellow and sterile.  The restaurant is small so the guy behind me kept ramming his chair against the back of mine.  That's always a treat.  A friend took the liberty of ordering the appetizers and I ordered a margarita.  The margarita was also just okay - I've had better from a pre-made mixture.  The appetizers were tasteless.  There was this green colored crepe thing with mushrooms in it that I couldn't even tell what it was because it lacked all flavor whatsoever.   Then there were these fancy tiny ""duck"" tamales. Also void of any flavor.  Big gaps denote time going by... The waitress comes up and asks my friend next to me what he ordered again, because I guess she forgot.  He told her the pork chops.  After waiting at least 30 minutes for the main course, I notice everyone's food coming out.  Looks pretty good, a little on the smallish side, but it was in Old Town so I figured it was acceptable.  Well, they end up bringing me the pork chop, and I told the server, that's not what I ordered.  The waitress comes over and asks what I ordered - I said the Chiles Rellenos (stuffed chiles) - she remembered, and said it would be out in 2 minutes.   About 15 minutes later, it came.  I was able to eat the Chile that was stuffed with cheese, but the one stuffed with pork was just horrible. I wanted to spit it out.  Any chance that the waitress came over and asked if everything was okay...NO, because she was chatting to this guy at the bar for the whole time. No offer for a free drink or at least asking what they could do to make my experience better. After dinner, most ordered desserts, but I was so repulsed by my food that I couldn't imagine eating anything else from there. The desserts looked fancy (and small), but everyone said they were pretty good, but not amazing.   Oh! and get this - with mostly all of the entrees being $20 plus, they wouldn't allow one person in our group a free refill of diet coke. To me, that is just unbelievable.  When the waitress finally brought the checks, the bill came to $371 for 7 people.  Gratuity was already included, even though she deserved none. My portion of the $371 tab was $53, that I basically flushed down the toilet for a tiny inedible cheese Chile Relleno that probably cost all of $1.25 to make.

The owner also came by and asked us how our meal was and chatted us up (us and pretty much everybody else in the restaurant) more than once, which I'm always a sucker for.  And they participate in the dining nights where money goes to AIDS and hunger charities - we ate there once and a whole 50% of our bill went to an AIDS charity, so I ordered another margarita.",0.9817,0.813,0.136,0.051,0.6040000000000001

After the waiter came by a third time in about 10-15 minutes asking to take our order, we finally ordered several appetizers. The waiter then also tells us that we have a time limit on our table and we can't stay longer than 2 hours. By now, the manager was standing at the host stand inside just glaring at us. After our waiter went inside, we saw him get grabbed by the manager and we could tell he was telling him to get our order and get us out.

Well, our food came and it was good but it was so unbearably unpleasant having the manager watching us through the window. We asked the waited why he was doing that and he was just mortified and didn't have an answer. Needless to say, we ate slowly just to piss them off even more.

After that, we shared the omelet de huitlacoche and the huevos motulenos. I really should have read the omelet's description more carefully - I saw mushroom, but somehow missed the corn part, and corn mushrooms are definitely not the same thing as a mushroom, and they must be an acquired taste. I've heard them compared to truffles but I wouldn't go there. Honestly, they just didn't taste right. Our waiter looked like he was going to say something when I ordered and I wish he had because I would have appreciated the warning. Besides the corn mushrooms, however, the rest of the omelet just wasn't seasoned, and I don't think standing two tortilla chips on their edge in a pile of black beans classifies as an upscale presentation.

Unfortunately the odd decor, the reasonably competent (though very friendly service) and the less-than-deft spicing left me underwhelmed and I had to round down to a three star overall rating. So, let's start with what it isn't. This is NOT, despite other reviewers' suggestions, NOT in the same league as Frontera. No way. No how. In fact, I'd say it falls just a tiny bit short of the Frontera fast food counter at Macy's. Sorry but that's the fact. The mole is passable, not much better. The salsa is the same, but oddly 'cooked'. The poussin was really commercial cornish game hen. Sorry guys but anybody who knows food would not put these two restaurants in the same category. Now, what it is: It's better than passable on the whole. There is an interesting array of choices on the menu. The prices aren't hideous. Not a bargain either. The menu shows some imagination. And the bar provides and outstanding selection of both tequila and rum. FYI, the margueritas take a bit of getting used to. Very very tart with little Cointreau / Triple Sec. They're like the restaurant overall - just a bit unusual and slightly off the mark. The front staff really is great.

We started with a few appetizers - grilled tiger shrimp, fried cheese, thick tortilla cakes, and squash blossoms.  Everything had the perfect amount of spiciness - just enough for flavours to pop, but not so much  that we needed to gulp water.  As a side note, the fried cheese had a consistency very similar to Asian fish cake, which was welcome but a little strange. I ordered the halibut special for my entree and it was pretty awesome.  It came as two small fish fillets wrapped in sweet potato strands in a shallow pool of warm chili sauce - very tender and flavourful.  I also snagged a piece of medium rare duck breast in a mole sauce off my friend's plate, and found it smoky and pretty good, despite not being a duck fan. We ordered a mild Spanish white wine with our meal as well as their famous margaritas.  A combination of the two brought out my Asian glow in full force, but I was too tipsy to really care. Desserts were both pretty and delicious.  My friend's caramel flan came with a delicate lacy spun sugar dome - it was mildly sweet and quite eggy.  The pastel tres leche cake was ok, but it came with too much cream and the raspberry sauce didn't cut the sweetness enough.  My spicy tequila-lime sorbet was the surprise winner of the night - very refreshing with an interesting chili kick at the end.

Back when I was poor, I was not a big fan of desserts.  I don't like chocolate, I don't like custard, and I won't eat ice cream.  Very few restaurants in Chicago are equipped to handle that.  I usually spend the end of the meal watching my wife and friends pass around something enormous and brown.  They ooze and gush over it while I pick at breadcrumbs and chew my ice. Salpicon has a dessert that brought me back a second time!  The pineapple trio, or whatever it's called, is fantastic.  It has three types of pineapple.  There's a big thick slab of pineapple, hot off the grill.  On top of it sits a lump of pineapple sorbet.  Holding up the rear is a beautiful and delicious flakey pineapple lattice.  It's fantastic.  No dairy or chocolate to be found!  And it's coated in some sort of non-chocolate sauce.  Tequila, maybe? The food is okay.  The portions are very small, the prices are pretty high, but everything is very pretty.  For what you pay, you're given a very fine dining experience.  The wait staff is very knowledgeable about tequila, and all 10,000 varieties served at the bar.  They can describe each by name, list their favorites, and describe their qualities.  I can only imagine that the staff is treated to some pretty hard core tequila parties at closing time.",0.9865,0.808,0.149,0.043,0.5934375

For my entree, I had the chile guajillo marinated Palmetto Farms poussin topped with potatoes, carrots, onions and goat cheese; accompanied by two guajillo enchiladitas and frijoles maneados (pinto beans with Chihuahua cheese).  When it came out, it was just a massive pile of brown.  I had to dig around to figure out the different components.  Flavor was moderate spice, and in my opinion, the degree of spice is not a flavor.  I didn't finish the dish, mainly because I lost interest completely...it wasn't even worth eating.

Salpicon get's overshadowed by another Mexican restaurant.  The Mexican inspired seafood was fresh, creative and absolutely delish.  The tequila list made me happy.  That is very hard to do because I am VERY particular about tequila.  Salpicon has a wonderful assortment.  Their wine list also got my attention.  The margaritas were fanastic and to cap off your meal order a tequila not to be drunk as a shot but to be savoured like a fine cognac.  Buen Provecho!",0.9451,0.754,0.231,0.015,0.5644230769230769
2006-08-03,4.0,"Not your average Mexican joint.  The tequila list is intimidating, but they're willing to help you out (they offer tequila ""flights""); the wine list is also very well-picked for the type of food here.  (Grner Veltliner is a great choice with a lot of Mexican seafood dishes.)  I had a really amazing grilled quail in adobo sauce special; deserts were also inspired. The decor is very hip, service was more than adequate, and my only complaint was that it seemed to draw a crowd that was there more to drink margaritas than to enjoy high-end Mexican food.",0.9818,0.706,0.253,0.04,0.43779761904761905
2006-06-28,5.0,"Loved it!!!  My margarita was amazing, the guacomole fresh and yummy, the fish perfect and paired so well with the salsa over it and the soft tortillas warm and delicious.  A Chicago native had recommended it to my Mom when she was visiting and she adored it, so I had to try it and I was so happy I did.  My boyfriend got a very spicy special- so I didn't have much of it, but he loved it.  His Tequilla was not as smooth as he hoped, although he still enjoyed it.  The waitstaff was wonderful, and I was quite impressed that one of the owners greeted us at the door.  I would highly recommend Salpicon.",0.9942,0.618,0.382,0.0,0.6918487394957983
2006-06-08,5.0,"Dining with the Satkoff family here at Salpicon always makes me feel so privileged to be a guest.  They put so much love and care into the menu, food preparation, wines, service and ambiance providing a wonderful opportunity to share such an exquisite Mexican culinary experience.  Quite simply this is the best Mexican dining experience available in Chicago; honestly I can't imagine a better place on earth.  The small dining room size ensures a superior level of service for everyone, and the wonderfully vibrant color scheme with beautiful Mexican art is peaceful, entertaining and uplifting.  The staff is extremely knowledgeable, experienced and friendly but never overbearing.  The owners are almost always present and working and ensuring every detail is attended to for your meal. (their labor of love)  The wine list is guaranteed to have something for every wine connoisseur; Victor has a 9,000 bottle capacity custom built wine storage room hidden in the back.  Fine wines from nearly every major grape growing region of the world.  The wine list is available on their website so you can peruse it's depth in advance.    Everything I've eaten from the menu here was amazing and the presentation professional and artsy.  For desert be sure to try the Tequila Lime Sorbet, which features just the right amount of finely grated Serrano Chile, my favorite dessert in the entire world.  Savor the cool spicy contrast along with a cup of fine Illy tea.  Like a fine dinner, some things in life must come to an end, but one thing is for sure, I'll be back to Salpicon to dine with the Satkoff family at every chance I get.",0.995,0.777,0.217,0.006,0.5145786092214664
2006-06-01,2.0,"I had high expectations for Salpicon, and they weren't met.  I've heard such good things, but the food just wasn't fantastic.  Don't get me wrong, the food was good, but not great.  I had the stuffed peppers, which had some interesting flavors, but nothing fantastic.  The guacamole appetizer was delicious.   High end Mexican is a difficult art to master, since traditional Mexican food is so good.  I think Adobo is overrated, and Salpicon unfortunately falls into this category.  If you want high-end Mexican where the food matches the high price, stick to De Cero or Frontera.",0.5374,0.658,0.189,0.153,0.611578947368421

2006-02-27,4.0,One of the better Mexican restaurants in town -- of the Frontera/Topolobampo variety. Colorful room meets colorful food. Great drink list with all the tequilas anyone could want. Interesting regular dishes and specials too.  Have never had a bad meal here.......,0.9161,0.716,0.284,0.0,0.41169871794871793
2006-02-07,4.0,"OK, I was torn between whether to give Salpicon three or four stars.  It's an upscale Mexican restaurant decorated with some vibrant colorful art.  I went with a four because although the food wasn't as good as I expected, the service and presentation was excellent and the margaritas were deliciously well put together (i can be a margarita snob).  My experience all together is worth four stars.  I started with super huge prawns wrapped in yuca strips, over a corn salad, that was juicy and tasty.  For my entree I had sea bass that was lightly seasoned and very tender.  Although it tasted bland. It came with a really good sauce that we had to ask more of in order to balance out the dish.  For desert, we had a decadent sorbet made with lime and serrano chiles....excellent, should not miss if you go.  Although my group and I had a good experience overall, i'd probably choose to go elsewhere for upscale Mexican food, of which Chicago, I hear, has plenty to choose from.",0.9367,0.814,0.135,0.051,0.4741666666666666
2006-02-04,4.0,"Salpicon offers upscale Mexican food with a twist.  The service was extremely friendly and knowledgeable, and I thought the food was not your typical Mexican (in a good way).  According to my Aunt, the Margarita was awesome, while most of us were content with our Coronas and Dos Equis beers for the night.  Our batch of chips was slightly dry, but the guacamole was phenomenal.  The ceviche, shrimp with sweet potato shreds, and the beef empanadas were great appetizers.  The sword fish (which I believe was a special for the evening) had a great spicy kick to it and was complemented really well by the mushrooms it was served over.  Definitely a refreshing upscale Mexican choice which I strongly recommend.",0.99,0.726,0.274,0.0,0.4919312169312169
