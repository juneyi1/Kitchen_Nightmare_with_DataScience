2016-10-12,4.0,"I was searching for Sarajevo Restaurant up the street when the curb appeal of Albert's Place caught my eye.  The table of men drinking and eating in the window served as good live advertisement.  So, I turned my vehicle around and parked. Anyone with any sense of global knowledge, could quickly tell that Albert's Place is a Turkish restaurant.  I would never have thought so by the name, that's for sure.  The is quite charming and has a very Istanbul feel inside, especially with an interesting old wall clock and a portrait of Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, the father of modern Turkey on the wall. The hosts and cook consisted of a husband and wife team in ordinary clothes and I loved their humble and genuine approach to making me feel at home.  Mrs. Albert gave me a glass of hot Turkish tea on the house.  Very nice gesture! While I ordered the beef and lamb meatballs with a salad but only a meatball sandwich arrived. :(  It was very good but no reason to complain.  My starter of lentil soup was very good on a rainy fall day.  I will return, you can count on it! A very cozy place!  ....  THIS IS NOT WHAT I WOULD CLASSIFY AS A DIVE!",0.8101,0.844,0.1,0.056,0.6533585858585857
2016-07-26,5.0,"Amazing place!! If you want to try unique style restaurant of Turkish homemade food, so you should go there. Their daily dish is crazy good, I tried 5 different dishes so far, including Turkish pizza and Kafta dish. Taking  lunch or dinner in this place and playing turkish Backgammon (wooden made table, they call in Turkish regarding to the owner ""Tawleh"") is the perfect environment for having a great food and chilling out.    For sure don't forget the Turkish tea with their yummy sweets....",0.9684,0.707,0.258,0.035,0.7115740740740741
2016-03-15,4.0,"First off, I would not call this a dive bar.  It's a hole in the wall restaurant. VERY Spartan interior.  There was a huge group of Turkish men playing a board game when we came in, another group of men at another table, it just looked like we were in the old country.  A sign in the window said byob. I had a cup of lentil soup. I am used to green lentils, and I was served the yellow lentils and it was very lemony. It was very fresh, looked wonderful, but wasn't my cup of tea.  Speaking of tea, we were served rooibos in little glass urn like glasses, right off the bat, without ordering, which must be customary.  It was really delicious. I ordered turkish pizza, and it was almost like having a gyro.  Fresh fresh fresh, very tasty.   Hubs had a meat plate. Lamb, chicken, and beef, all grilled and so flavorful, an amount enough for two. The bread served with the meal was also soft and fresh.   I would definitely come here again.",0.988,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.5008658008658008

2015-08-30,5.0,"Super delicious Turkish breakfast that reminded me of being back in Istanbul.  The tea was nice and strong, the starter mezze what you look for at breakfast time with nice fresh cheese, and the spicy menemen eggs were spicy and savory.  Albert kept us nicely supplied with tea. If you like Turkish food and want a relaxing place, come here.",0.9792,0.631,0.369,0.0,0.7375
2015-03-19,5.0,"I stopped by and Taira was our waitress. She was awesome! She was very attentive and explained everything we were eating.  The meat here is Halal, so if you are looking for some good cuts of meat - this is the place.  The meat was also marinated to perfection!  I recommend this place for lunch or dinner. They accept credit cards and its a BYOB!!",0.9474,0.691,0.255,0.053,0.8666666666666667
2013-01-28,5.0,"This is one of those places many people would be too afraid to check out. Once you get inside you will realize it's not bad at all. Albert is a great host. Drinks are a lil spendy, you may want to stick to beer. If you are looking for a quick drink and live in the neighborhood, this is worth considering.",0.8462,0.842,0.158,0.0,0.5595238095238095
