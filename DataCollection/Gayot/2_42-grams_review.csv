Set up as incredibly intimate setting with chef Jake Bickelhaupt, his sous chef, and Alexa Welsh, dinner consisted of us and 3 other couples that we got to know, engage and imbibe with during the delicious meal. Sitting at the counter, watching the food being prepared, and being able to chat with Chef Jake and Alexa was a rare treat. Hearing the backstory and inspiration for the dishes made each bite of the creative, inspired meal even more enjoyable. The BYOB  was wonderful with recommendations for the meal suggested on the website. We ended up trying and sharing our beer, wine, and cider with the other couples there with us and and had such a good time we even ended up heading out to drinks afterwards with our new friends.

Hearing the backstory of how 42 grams came to be makes you appreciate everything even more. The food is certainly worth the 2 stars it was awarded in its first few months (!!!) of existence. In the menu that we tried, each dish had a little bit of an asian touch to it, which I definitely appreciated. The textures and tastes were completely unique to 42 grams - there was no copycatting of any sort. My favorite dishes by far were the Squash served with seaweed in a beautiful wooden bowl, the cauliflower, and the A5 wagyu.

2016-11-12,5.0,"42 grams provides a unique dining experience that is visually stunning, impressive, and, most importantly, fun. Unlike other restaurants that feature a chef's counter where you can watch multiple chefs prepare your meal, 42 grams is a tour de force of one person, Chef Jake. Every bite is prepared from scratch, as you watch. From the first ingredient (and there were many in each of the eleven courses of the fall 2016 menu) to the last bite of dessert, you see everything created before you. It's like watching an elaborate ballet to see it so perfectly timed. And the results are stunningly beautiful. Of course this only works for a small number of diners, and the counter is limited to eight. With enough warning, a private party of ten can be accommodated at a table, but the counter and table are never used at the same time. Alexa, Jake's, wife, provides a delightful history of the couple, the place, and insightful commentary on each course. A liquor license is in the works, but as of this writing it is BYOB. I loved the fact that advance wine recommendations were provided by email, and that ice bucket and wine opener were already set up for each couple. 42 grams is a very special experience you won't find elsewhere, and is definitely worth checking out.",0.9879,0.813,0.174,0.013,0.5483630952380952

2016-10-08,5.0,"***The very personal and intimate 42 grams is as ambitious as ever and one of the very best restaurants in the country*** Chicago has many excellent restaurants, but none strike the chord with me as much as 42 grams. Operated by a husband and wife team, 42 grams is wonderfully small, intimate and personal but also incredibly ambitious. 42 grams only has one menu, and it is one delicious, exquisite and beautifully presented tasting course after another. My recent dinner started with strongly flavored, creamy and rich but also light whipped foie gras topped with a tart finger lime pulp and a great crispy crunch from a toasted rice nest. Next came soft, moist and lightly sweet king crab that was accentuated by a great grouping of herbs (with some made crispy for texture). Oyster leaf was among the fresh herbs and it provided a great ocean flavor to the dish. There was also sweet butternut squash panna cotta and crispy speck for a salty note. This was followed by lightly crispy mussels that sat on an incredibly addictive curry sauce--the kind of aromatic sauce that you just want to keep scooping up. I loved the garnishes here. There were sea beans that provided a unique texture, baby cauliflower and sea grapes that exploded with a sour flavor. Next came mackerel, which was very nicely prepared. It was oily, moist and with that perfect mackerel mix of salty and sour notes. The skin was crispy. The garnishes were all Japanese here including very fluffy, moist and not too sweet tamago. There was also a great soy and rice sauce. I loved the use of kombu to provide a pronounced savory, pickled flavor to the course. Pheasant two ways was the next course. It was exceptional. Pheasant is hard to get right and is often dry. This pheasant though was surprisingly moist with an addictively delicious crispy skin. Also on the plate were pheasant sausage, excellent fermented forbidden rice porridge, meaty blue chanterelles, creamy celery root puree, and a rich pheasant jus to bath all the ingredients in. Kurobuta pork cheek followed. This course featured moist meat that was nicely seasoned along with great garnishes like matsutake mushrooms, crispy Brussels sprout leaves, crispy kale, and a sweet onion jam. While this was a perfectly fine course, I did not love it as much as the other savory courses on the menu. The main course was an incredibly generous portion of Japanese A5 Wagyu. The meat was perfectly seared while also featuring an excellent and uniformly cooked center. The meat was red, juicy and tender with the perfect cook on the meat to melt the high fat content of this well marbled beef. The garnishes were all good including baby bok choy and a really good sauce of pickled Japanese plum. The cheese course featured fresh cheese, a sweet jam, jamon, and an airy flax seed crisp dusted with kale powder. Pre-dessert was a perfect refreshing bite--a thin white chocolate sphere filled with tart calamansi juice and topped with a taste-just-like-it-sounds bubblegum hyssop. The main dessert was excellent. It was a moist, sweet (but not overly sweet) and lightly chewy date cake topped with savory and salty miso chicken skin caramel, and a refreshing and light lavender and ube gelato. The last taste was a espresso coffee cup of coffee espuma topped with fragrant cardamom whip. Service was excellent as always as Alexa is gracious and friendly but also polished, polite and precise. Prices are high but given the very generous portion of Japanese A5 Wagyu served here, prices are not too bad compared to other top restaurants in the country. 42 grams is a wonderful dining experience and one of the best ones you can have in the country. Its intimacy, inventiveness and uniqueness truly separates it from most of the best restaurants you will find in Chicago, New York and San Francisco. I am not sure what the parking situation is, but 42 grams is very close to the CTA Wilson station on the Red Line.",0.9998,0.701,0.285,0.015,0.5823887171030028
2016-09-13,5.0,"Wow. I made a reservation 3 months in advance because it was a 2 Michelin star restaurant and I wanted to take my girlfriend somewhere nice for her birthday. After doing some research, I noticed how there are very few people inside the restaurant in the pictures and that the restaurant was literally a kitchen which is so cool.  About a week before the reservation, I received an email with some wine pairing suggestions which is really cool because the restaurant is BYO. I had managed to get a hold of a couple bottles of Roc de Cambes 1994 and was going to bring both for us. I also don't like white wine and have no problems drinking red with seafood.  You need to arrive at the restaurant right one time and don't be late or else you'll be joining the dinner that is already in process. My girlfriend and I showed up 10 minutes early so that we could get the best seats. However, literally every seat is the best seat because you are sitting at the kitchen counter.  Alexa is the hostess and the wife of Chef Jake. She clearly explained every dish down to the minute detail which was super cool. The food itself was fantastic. Every bite worked perfectly together. The A5 Wagyu was one of the best foods that I had ever eaten in my life and the mackerel was amazing. It was on par with the fish at DOM in Brazil which is perhaps the best fish dish I have ever eaten at in my life.  I love how if you have any questions, you can ask Chef Jake directly and he will gladly answer any question. At the end, he comes up to each person and talks to them personally. I asked him to sign my girlfriend's menu and he gladly did. If I get another opportunity, I will most certainly come back.",0.9958,0.794,0.186,0.02,0.5250355774493706

2016-08-11,5.0,"This is a review tailored towards those among us who are less accustomed to the fine dining experience. I have only been to a handful of these types of restaurants on special occasions and am still learning what I like and what I don't like, so, something-something grain of salt, something-something. Anyway, this place is magical.  Pros: Atmosphere, the food, BYOB, value. Everything, basically. Cons: None. Summary:  Ambiance: Loved the atmosphere at 42 grams. It's a very approachable space, even though there are only 8 or 10 seats in the entire restaurant. I was worried that it might be a little 'stiff' because my girlfriend and I are in our mid-20's and sometimes I get the sense people our age aren't given the same treatment at places where the money can be a little longer. That simply was not the case here and any kind of notion like that was immediately dismissed thanks to a warm greeting by Alexa and some funky tunes. The music actually serves as a muffler to other guests' conversations, which was a plus considering literally everyone in the restaurant is cozied up at the chef's counter. Dress, at least on the night I went, was something like business casual. One couple wore something not quite to that standard and one couple wore something above that standard.  Food: Absolutely elite. Of the 10 dishes served, half were to die for and the rest were somewhere between great and amazing. I am typically not one for hyperbole, but I can't help myself here -- the Kobe was the best plate of food I've ever had. Some of the dishes contain very unique elements and others are more simply constructed. I guess what I'm getting at is, if you get 'scared' of trying new or different types of food, don't spend a bunch of money on fine dining experiences, but if you absolutely have to, 42 grams' menu is fairly approachable.  It's BYOB. Guys. BYOB. 2 Michelin stars & BYOB. Again, I don't go to these places all of the time, but I know that's special. Shared two bottles of wine with my lady and one of those was a special bottle we'd been saving for something just like this, which certainly enhanced the experience.  Value: Fantastic. Relative to its peers, based on information I gathered through researching fine dining options in the area, as well as places I've actually been to, 42 grams is a terrific value. Who else is offering BYOB for this type of experience? I'd gladly pay more than the current asking price to go back. Er, when I go back.

2016-04-26,3.0,"Dined here on our recent trip to Chicago last weekend. It was a special evening, a birthday celebration. I booked it waaaay out, about 5 weeks ahead, after doing my research on the best places in Chicago for a memorable dining experience. We arrived as instructed in our welcome email, early but not too early, appropriate wine clutched in hand ( although had not decanted our red, as suggested in the welcome email. Having had an amusing mental image of us clutching a decanter in the back of an Uber, wine sloshing about.) We very quickly realized that we were to be the only guests for the evening.... the only booking, which was a real surprise. I had assumed that reservations here were almost impossible to get. We do appreciate that they honoured our booking, and didn't cancel on us. It would have been stressful/ impossible to find a similar quality experience at the last minute in Chicago. So, it was to be a very interesting dining experience, and it really was. We were shown to our seats at the counter, Alexa introduced us to Chef Jake, and his two young assistants. Alexa was very professional , personable  and gracious. Each dish, and ingredient was carefully explained by her, and everything was really, really  good. I won't describe each course, as many here on Yelp have already done so;  SO many luscious ingredients, carefully combined, exquisitely prepared, great use of texture, and absolutely beautiful presentation. The Lamb, Squab and A 5 Mizayaki Wagyu were all memorable and perfect, our favourites . The dessert was quite a generous serving, and fabulous. It was also very interesting to be up at the counter, watching the cooking and prep action, which was very focused and precise, in an impeccable kitchen. So as far as food goes, a very solid 5 stars, minus 1/2 maybe, because the byo wine thing is a bit of a pain in the bum. Much nicer to have a knowledgeable sommelier, and have the wine served, but this wasn't a major downer for us. They don't have a license, and we knew that going in. Why the 3 stars then? Well, all was delicious, interesting and great until the very final coffee course..... which is a small mousse/ luscious creation, with cardamom, served in espresso cups. Something went wrong . First attempt by the assistants didn't work. There was a major chef melt down, right there in front of us....the two young assistants had their a$$e$ handed to them, dressed down in a really angry tirade, cups banged on the counter, mess, scolding. Then chef Jake made it himself. We were served and he vanished. Not to be seen again. Not a ""Happy Birthday, nice seeing you, hope you had a good meal"" from him .  Nothing.  We had no opportunity to thank him for the meal , or say goodnight.  We were left feeling extremely awkward, and it definitely marred an otherwise special and delicious  birthday meal. I thanked the young assistants across the counter for the great meal, and for their hard work. They smiled but looked miserable. Considering that we were the only guests, and it was a birthday, a very personal and intimate setting.......I think Chef Jake could have made an effort to keep it together. We had no interaction with him all evening, and a good end and send off would have been gracious and professional, and there would be another 5 star review here. Alexa continued to be very professional and end the meal on a good note for us, and see us on our way, with an autographed menu and recommendations for music venues nearby. She is a great asset to this establishment.  Dining in this circumstance is a real spectator sport. All the prep, interactions, everything is laid bare to the view of the diner. It is theatre...and I think it should be like the Ballet, or Opera: If you forget your lines, or slip and fall, get up, pretend it didn't happen, continue with a good presentation. You don't storm off the stage and leave the audience shuffling. The show must go on. Instead we felt that we were treated to a Gordon Ramsey variety of  spectacle, to end our meal. Not what we had in mind . No amount of perfect food can compensate for witnessing  staff being berated, and abused, up close and personal. They made a mistake, from what we could see, a pretty small one, after an evening of perfect food, and really good work by them. No reason for the level of  drama. This is not the E.R. It's food, very good food, but keep it in perspective, stay gracious.  Fortunately, we went on to a fantastic Blues club in the neighbourhood, and drank and listened to amazing music until 3am.

What distinguishes this place from other BYOB Michelin rated restaurants like it ----- is that about 48 hours before the meal, an email was sent with wine pairing recommendations for each course to be prepared during our dining experience. It was three of us, so we opted to each bring one bottle from the list and share. I also picked up the Allgash Curieux a/k/a beer (yes BEER) suggestion for dessert. Ultimately, this was more than we could ever drink especially when planning to drink beverages paired with each course. Meaning we offered our drinks to the five others dining at our sitting and they ending up doing the same. .... Our dining experience lasted about 2+ hours. Location The exterior of the building is less than flattering. There was no valet parking and no parking lot which is pretty on par with all the others too. What matters is the inside. Cute! Even the bathroom was cute --- and had I brought my phone during my ""visit"", I would have taken a picture. 42 Grams is located near Demera Ethiopian Restaurant. ..... GPS brings you right too it and so will a taxi. Lol  Backdrop If I recall correctly, the chef and his wife are the heart and soul of 42 Grams. Speaking of souls, I think the name selection is because a soul is 21 grams and times two - get it?! The chef is fond of Graham Elliott and prepared a course inspired by him and used plates from his restaurant to accompany the course tribute to GE. Dining at the chef counter allowed us to see each course being prepared and to ask questions in free form. I suspect the same could be done at the communal table but I think the counter is better suited for it.  While many look at the price of this type of meal and attempt to weigh its value by the quantity/size, it does not consider this type of business is a true labor of love. The ingredients, creations and size makes this type of place unlikely to be a huge cash cow, especially when both husband and wife are it. That said, I doubt any chef in this type of setting does it strictly for the money. You have to dream about creations to succeed even at a hefty price point. Knowing this, leads me to appreciate the talent and gift all the more.  In sum, if you can afford the price tag, it is a great place, particularly for a special occasion. Highly recommend it.",0.9974,0.822,0.164,0.014,0.5861904761904762
2015-12-15,4.0,"There is a lot of good going on at 42 grams, and I'm lucky enough to be able to talk about it. When you go to these high end restaurants, there are usually one or two traits that set them apart. For me, it was: 1) Alexa's dish description: instead of just saying what the ingredients were, she also told us why they were there and how they're integral to the dish's composition. But the best part was how she told us to eat the dishes, i.e. ""you'll want to get a bit of everything on the spoon and dip it in the foam"" or ""just take this in one bite."" I have never experienced such detailed dining instruction like that before, and I truly appreciated it, especially since these aren't huge portions (which is completely fine with me, by the way). In these settings, I typically want to minimize ""screwing up"" how I eat, and Alexa made sure I didn't make any mistakes. 2) Call me a pauper, but when drinking wine by the bottle, I much prefer myself or a fellow diner at the table to pour instead of a waiter/waitress stopping by every once in a while to do it. 42 grams' ""DIY"" wine service was perfect -- ice bucket, corkscrew and towel was exactly what I needed. No feeling like the waiter's going to get all uppity if I pour the wine myself, and among those at our table we could decide who wanted more of what. Chef Jake runs a respectably organized kitchen -- perhaps the most organized I've ever seen. While you can watch him and Trent prepare the dishes, the reality is they've understandably done most of the real prep during the day, so watching the kitchen is mainly dish assembly (which is an art with the dishes that 42 grams puts out), but in terms of culinary theater, there aren't lots of knives flying around or fish filleting, for example. Now, onto the food.  The high end ingredients matched the high end price. Lots of caviar on dishes, A5 wagyu, and some game meats (which aren't cheap). If a $200+/person restaurant should have value for money, I'd say this place gets close. Let's talk about caviar for a second. It was in two or three of the dishes. While I appreciated this greatly (I can sit down with a whole tin and spoon and eat caviar all day), I'm not sure its inclusion enhanced each dish (other than, of course, having caviar). In most cases, I took a bite with caviar, and I ended up enjoying the caviar and the dish separately.  The lighter, ""white wine"" dishes (if you will), tended to be heavy on salt, making it challenging at times to pick up individual flavor profiles. Since these were the first dishes, it kicked the meal off in an okay -- but not amazing -- way. Fortunately, the bigger dishes like rabbit, the A5 wagyu, and jamon knocked it out of the park, so things got better as they moved along (which is good). My favorite dish, though, was the aloe vera/galangal dessert. Make no mistake, I loved the buttery A5 wagyu, but this dessert was the perfect combination of sweet, savory, saucy, and crunchy. When I think of my meal at 42 grams, I think of this dessert (and Alexa's dish descriptions). Will I be back? Not right away. There are too many restaurants in Chicago with top tier status like 42 grams I need to try before I repeat a meal here. I liked my meal and enjoyed the experience a lot, but it wasn't my favorite high end restaurant experience in Chicago. And I don't want anybody to take that to mean this place is ""bad"" -- far from it. 42 grams has earned some great accolades in just a few short years, so they know what they're doing, but Chicago offers a lot of options in this space, and the competition is fierce. As a diner, I want to try them all, and if you're a diner who's interested in experiencing Chicago's top culinary skills, then you should try 42 grams, too.",0.998,0.829,0.147,0.024,0.5321742724867724

2015-12-03,4.0,"It was more of a 3.5 but whatevs. Easy online reservations...especially compared to other high end places.  Its nice that you can buy a ""ticket"" online and pay ahead.  Like most, its non refundable after you make the jump. The space is way up north on a very unassuming corner of Uptown.  They allow you to come at 830P.  Doors are locked before that.  If you are sitting at the counter...the first to arrive get to choose their seats.  We were the last, but we got the end...which is what I wanted.  The space is very cozy and nice.  It seats about 14 people total.  While we were there, there was only 10 total guests. Ive done the high end communal before and I am not a fan.  I didnt realize that EVERYONE (table and counter) eat together.  Yes, it makes sense for the smallness of the space, but personally I dont like it.  Its a personal preference.  And if you want to have an intimate dinner with someone...this is not the best place because you are almost forced to talk to your neighbors.  And to be honest, the conversation I felt always led to ""where have you ate?""  ""Do you like this as much as blah, blah, blah""  I am not a fan of the pretentious where have you ate at conversation.  We obviously all love food if you are dropping $285 for a BYOB restaurant in Uptown...ok? The food was all pretty good, but nothing was really amazing,  I do find myself comparing high end places with these up and coming restaurants and asking myself...was it worth it?   Here, I liked it but it is pricey for the area, food, and experience...so I am not sure. Caviar pancake-good...menus looking interesting at the start from the first bite. Uni and brioche-good, but somewhat an odd combination.  uni was good, but not fab-o Sturgeon-delicious and the little crispy potato chips made the dish Brassia-The char on the greens was excellent and complimented the dish fantastically Elk heart-meh.  This dish was a miss for me.  It didnt go well together with the egg, the heart, the berry, etc. Duck three ways-personal preference...I am over duck.  This was ok in comparison to some of the other duck I have had.  It was very average.  Dont get me wrong...it wasnt bad, just not excellent. Wagyu- YES!  Excellent...I just wish there was more of this!  Perfectly cooked and some greens to cut the flavor White Chocolate ball with liquid-nothing special.   Bread pudding was one of my favorite dishes of the night.  This dessert was heavenly for me.  Caramel and sweet with a great mix of cake base.  YUM Solid coffee-meh...Im a huge coffee fan but this didnt really do anything for me.  It was a cool concept just didnt hit any high notes for me. Overall, a good dinner.  Alexa and Chef Jake were extremely nice.  She went through a good detailed explanation of each dish.

2015-06-27,5.0,"42 Grams is one of the best restaurants in the country right now. Jake is doing something different and daring, and dining with him is an adventure.  One of the problems with Yelp can be the lack of consistency across raters. For example, I am fairly choosy when it comes to restaurants, particularly given the quality of food that I can prepare myself at home; other people give Chipotle 5 stars. One of the only low ratings for 42 Grams has to do with a personality conflict, and not with food. So, what can you make of all this? I would suggest that you seriously consider eating at 42 Grams if you're open to novel, exciting, and even daring culinary experiences. The experience will take you out of your comfort zone. Yes, Alexa may be too chatty for some. No, you may not leave feeling stuffed. Speaking personally, I hate communal dining. But that's the point - to move beyond your comfort zone. as well as beyond your preconceived ideas about fine dining, in order to experience something genuinely new and extraordinary.

2015-04-10,5.0,"After three fantastic dining experiences at Sous Rising (the underground dining venue Chef Bickelhaupt operated out of his apartment before opening 42 Grams) I finally made it to 42 Grams. I had meant to make it here sooner (the restaurant has already been open a little over a year) and after my amazing meal the other day I am really regretting having missed some of the earlier menus.  The space at 42 Grams is very tastefully decorated; they really did an amazing job beautifully renovating the space. Elegant, intimate and comfortable. I strongly recommend dining at the Chef's Counter as it is a lot of fun viewing the kitchen working their magic and being able to ask questions of the chefs. I wish more places in Chicago had this kitchen counter concept as it really enhances the dining experience.  42 Grams is BYOB and the menu is approximately 13 courses; the first half of the savories pairing with white wine, the second half with red and concluding with three sweet courses. Generally with extended tasting menus a couple of courses really wow me, a few more are excellent and a few fair-to-good. What was really impressive at 42 Grams was course-after-course was a home run; probably 10 of the 13 courses were utterly fantastic. The meal started on a high note and somehow just kept getting better and better. The food is interesting (rare ingredients, flavor combinations, textures and at times playfulness), top notch quality (A5 Wagyu, caviar, foie etc.), virtually everything made fresh in house, perfectly cooked and presented as works of art. This is truly some of the very best cuisine in the United States right now.  I also was pleasantly surprised with the portions; I had heard some people complain they left hungry, but as someone with a hearty appetite it was just the right amount of food; sure I could have eaten more, but I left very comfortable and happy. The food itself is modern, creative and very reminiscent of what was served at Sous Rising with one notable exception; at Sous Rising nearly every course seemed to combine sweet with savory (likely something Chef had carried over from his days as a sous at Schwa), but at 42 Grams the savories did not have dessert like components; I definitely liked this evolution of Chef's cooking.  Chef's wife Alexa leads the front-of-the-house team and is very friendly and extremely efficient. The rest of the staff is quite personable and competent as well. Perhaps my only complaint of 42 Grams (and what keeps it from being among my very favorite all-around restaurants - despite the food quality certainly being of that caliber) is that the meal operates too efficiently. Our thirteen course meal was under two hours in length; while some may actually enjoy such fast paced dining, when I splurge over $200 a head for dinner I generally expect the meal to be the evening's entertainment and am seeking a relaxing, lengthy meal. Since the meal is a communal experience, one cannot request to slow down the pace - even if you slow down the courses keep coming rapid fire and I definitely did feel it was a bit of a rushed experience.  The only other possible negative (but an aspect I also respect) is 42 Grams' my-way-or-the-highway attitude; nonrefundable pre-paid tickets in lieu of reservations, no substitution policy, no catering to allergies - even additional rules sent via e-mail a few days before your dinner such as how much wine you are permitted to bring and how early you are allowed to arrive. Since my wife often has to take business trips on very short notice this greatly deters her prospects of dining here as the risk of buying a ticket far in advance is significant (and 42 Grams is still often selling out most nights well in advance, so last minute availability is rare). On the one hand as a diner I feel that a restaurant should be more hospitable with their policies, but on the other hand as one who dines out frequently I have seen the other side of the coin - there are so many difficult and high maintenance customers, i.e. cancelling reservations last minutes (or worse, not even showing up),  making crazy demands on the chef to accommodate questionable dietary restrictions etc., that part of me ""gets"" 42 Grams' perspective and has to respect that they are able to fill the house night in and night out in a neighborhood not known for haute cuisine and with high (but fair) prices.  Nevertheless the good FAR outweighs the bad at 42 Grams and they are certainly deserving of all the accolades received during this past year (Two Michelin Stars, Rising Chef of the year in the Jean Banchet's etc.). I definitely plan to dine here regularly going forward and Chicago is extremely fortunate to have this venue.",0.9984,0.776,0.171,0.053,0.5690437055821671

To top it all off, you get the opportunity to watch a rising star chef cook and prepare your meal, while asking any questions you want.  Nothing like pairing some take-away knowledge with world-class dining.

The food and services were impeccable, and thus I came back. After my recent experience, I can say with confidence this is the best restaurant in Chicago and will soon grace San Pellegrino's list of top 50 restaurants in the world.  I honestly think they can even climb to the top spot, but there are first a couple things to still tweak.  Service time was fixed, we got through 13 courses in right around 2 hours 15 minutes, which to me is perfect.  Every dish was outstanding. The Skuna Bay Salmon, Axis Venison, and AG Wagyu were the 3 best things I've ever eaten.  The whole progression was balanced. I loved the way the textures increased as well as the flavors.  The uni was the best I've had, but not a huge uni fan.   To go to the top there are things they need to work on. First of all, the portion sizes are still way to small.  They are literally small bites and again I left so hungry I basically had to go home and eat a second dinner.  Secondly, the weakest part of the menu was dessert.  The kabosu bomb was a perfect palate cleanser. But the tamarind ice cream and  banana bread combo while tastey, was boring and left me wanting more. I really like bold and sweet desserts and this didn't cut it.  Bringing in a pastry chef and adding a couple more desserts would be insane! On my first visit there was a huge piece of foie, this time only shavings, so that's always a disappointment when I go to a super expensive tasting and don't get foie. Lastly, while service was excellent, it seemed a little too rehearsed instead of organic like my first visit.

2014-12-19,5.0,"Let me start by saying that while we have been fortunate enough to dine at many of the top-rated restaurants in Chicago and throughout the country, we are similarly as pleased with friends at home and our own jerk chicken or pulled pork.  So, while we really appreciate fine dining, we don't live for it. I booked this dinner based solely on the Michelin stars.  I knew nothing about it, and their website is relatively scant in detail.  Their instructions are quite precise - arrive within a 15-30 minute window, and they will not make substitutions.  It was only when we arrived (we were the last couple), that all of their rules made sense.  Everyone is sitting together, and unlike other communal tables, everyone is served the same course at the same time.  So, if you're late to your reservation, you're messing up with everyone's dinner. Admittedly, this concept will not work well for some people.  However, it was fantastic to us.    The primary reason most people go to a fine dining restaurant is to have (hopefully) amazing food that's different and new. 42 grams fires on all cylinders here.  While the super high-tech display of an Alinea is not here, the amazingly creative flavors, textures, and presentation makes such display unnecessary.  Pacing is perfect, allowing everyone to eat, but not be rushed or sit around.  As a result, you leave satiated, but not exploding full or hungry. To me, one of the biggest compliments to a chef is when my wife, who is a fairly picky eater, finishes something she would not normally eat.  Caviar and salmon are perfect examples of this, as are sweetbreads, pig heart, etc.  Not only did she try these things, she finished them, and in several cases would have wanted more.   Also, in my experience, most chefs are either main course chefs or pastry chefs, not both.  With 2 people in the kitchen, this team pulls off both great main course meals and equally memorable desserts.   What makes this restaurant especially unique, though, is the atmosphere.  Because everyone sits together and eats at the same time, it is intimate.  Candidly, we did not speak with the people next to us, but we could have if we chose; and we did not appear rude because we did not.  More so, though, the fact that the chef's wife, Alexa, is your ""tour guide"" of sorts, makes the name all make sense.  Jake and Alexa are essentially inviting you into their home to make you a meal.  They each work with their strengths - Jake with the cooking, Alexa with the speaking, but you feel like you've been invited into someone's home.  Granted, you are paying for it, but it is an atypical experience for a restaurant.  Again, not everyone will like this, but we loved it.   Since most fine dining restaurants are a bit cold - sterile atmosphere, often pretentious or distant service, and focus on ""show"" over relationship, this came as a pleasant surprise.  Had I read my own review before going, I might have been turned off by this, but it works really well - at least with this couple. As for the negative reviews (which I read last night before going for the first time) - one is from someone who didn't attend the restaurant.  While it appears there are some major life issues there, I can't speak to what happened between them.  The bottom line, though, is the couple I met were gracious, inviting, and I actually tasted the food, so take that for what it's worth.  The other - again, the back-and-forth doesn't make much sense, but if you read between the lines, you can see what happened.  If you invite me over to your house for dinner, and I act like I don't really want to be there, appear angry or put out because you don't meet my needs, etc., does that make you a bad host or me a bad guest?  You can decide that for yourself, but again, based on my experience, if you aren't demanding or pretentious (and maybe even if you are), this experience will be great. I can honestly say that there is currently no better restaurant in Chicago for the money and the experience, and at the risk of sounding pretentious myself, I am comparing that to restaurants (some of which have closed) including:  Alinea; Grace; Goosefoot; Elizabeth; L20; Charlie Trotter's; Tru; Sixteen; Blackbird; Naha; North Pond; Topolobampo, etc. If you have the means, and are trying to figure out where to go; and even more so, if you're open to this type of an experience, get reservations as soon as you can, as you won't be able to much longer.",0.9968,0.839,0.122,0.039,0.5549334811529937

My parents do speak a bit English, but every course Alexa waited until my husband and I explained the ingredients to them, to make sure they understood what they were eating, which I found very thoughtful.

2014-11-21,1.0,"I decided this was where I wanted to celebrate my birthday (two weeks from now)  The gal I spoke to on the phone was very sarcastic and rude when I asked if they could please ensure we were not seated with any candles on our table due to the fact that my mother was recovering from a serious illness and required oxygen. She hinted that maybe she should just stay home. I was appalled, are you kidding me? At this point I knew there was no way I was going to eat here.  I decided to check the reviews and I am *SO* glad I did. I find it helpful to read the worst reviews of a business to see if people are just whining or if they had a genuinely regrettable experience. That's when I stumbled upon the review by Athanasios K. and in it, the comments and messages by the business owners made me sick. These people commented about his wife and how she was an amazing person. Wait, what? The business owner, Jake B. then went on to insult him regarding his opinions as ""amateur"". He goes on to tell him ""...don't come back. I don't want to elaborate why. Just stay home.""  Well Jake, here's a newsflash for you; I planned on dining here for my birthday and if it was as amazing as it should be, I was going to book your establishment for my firm's holiday gala. Since your fine dining experience comes with a high price but low morals (and spelling, ""your a cool hip hop star"") I'll go ahead and pass.  Happy holidays. *******************UPDATE 12/5/14*************************** There is nothing fraudulent or made up about my review at all and the owner's wife is just upset because despite their tactics, I have refused to remove my review. I'm sorry that you lack any human decency and it's wonderful that you've tried (AND FAILED) to defend your awful business practices and worse customer service. It really is a shame that such talent accompanies such a business. What kind of person lies about their mother having a serious illness? Worse, what kind of trash accuses someone of lying about it? Shall I post a photo of my mom? Will that make you feel better? Wow. Just wow.  My ailing mother has lung disease and had battled cancer. Twice.  Disgusting. ******Another update because Alexa is a freaking psycho**** Do you really think it's appropriate to speak to someone that way where anyone could see it? Do you think that this is going to sway potential customers in your favor? What is wrong with you? Hurling insults at me as if you are a juvenile. I would expect this type of behavior from a teenager at Taco Bell but you, the MARVELOUS ALEXA, I'm appalled.  So back to my review... This ""woman"" (as if she behaves like an adult) expects you Yelpers to believe that I would fabricate such an in depth story just because... I have nothing to gain by reviewing your restaurant negatively darling and if I did, I can assure you I have more class than to bring my mother into things. I'm sorry that you lack not only customer service skills but also any human decency. It really is a shame.  I have reached out to associates with the local news stations and the newspaper. I will not be bashed upon by some lunatic owner. ""Calling me out""? Morals? Best joke I've heard all week.  I wish you all the best in your business ventures and truly hope that you learn from your mistakes in the way that you've handled my personal experience and review.  I did my ""homework"" on the establishment and that's why I chose it over Alinea.  Again, shameful.",-0.9275,0.692,0.142,0.166,0.6132539682539682

There was one course (the wagyu beef) that literally had me speechless for a few minutes. The level of detail and thoughtfulness that comes with each course was amazing.  We used Alexa's grandmother's silver once or twice. Plates from Charlie Trotter's were used in an ode to him. I'm lefthanded, and Alexa set each course for my ultimate comfort. Chef used spent grain leftover from the brewing process to make a toast that was unbelievable. And the coffee course was a fun surprise! The atmosphere is somehow upscale yet completely comfortable. Alexa, co-owner, is a delight. I really enjoyed chatting with her. And Chef Jake was super laid back and friendly-- the two of them made the night incredible. As of today(!!) 42 Grams has 2 Michelin stars-- and they haven't even been open a year!

We just firmly believe in people that aren't running across the street for Coke after we started service and on their phone every other minute while their partner is elbowing you in embarrassment to stop. You posting such a review doesn't surprise us one bit. You came in with an agenda and you are following through. We just wish that you had the same passion for your dinner as you do for your Coke, movies, and Yelp reviews.  This is a place of business, but we are two kind people that took excellent care of you and your company at 42 grams. Once you attack us with false statements, we will respond.

I won't describe the courses since other reviewers have already done that, but I will say that 75% of the course were knockouts, and the rest were simply very delicious.

Few pointer/tips:  Only a communal table is offered for seating. So I recommend you book with at least 4 people to have the best time and not sit with random people. The environment is very casual, not stuffy at all. That being said, the service is casual as well. Leave your pretentiousness at the door. Some people may not enjoy this for the price they pay. Which is why I recommend going with a group and just enjoy. It did not bother me in the least bit. I'm rather laid back. It is a very small restaurant with only 4 people staffing. 2 in the kitchen and 2 out. This is rather impressive when you consider how intricate every dish is and the prep work for each.  I love that it was BYOB. You can bring multiple different bottles, which I did. They change the menu. I would definitely go again once the menu changes. Multiple courses are remarkable.

I agree with the other review about the silverware. A little plain. And they normally just have you a spoon when a fork, spoon and knife were warranted.

2014-05-17,3.0,"I think this place has a lot of potential, but right now they need to work in three areas relative to the top tier restaurants: 1) service interactivity, 2) balance of the meal and 3) small service details First of all, none of this reflects on the quality of the dishes chef Jake made, which I considered interesting and inventive and in the ""top tier"" level and I'll explain that (food, 4.5 stars).  Things that I liked: food, food, food. 1) Juniper Jump was an extremely inventive cocktail with a solid-ish hendricks gin. Can they do this in a BYOB? I think this is a legitimate question, as we self-provided for a certain expectation in time and presentation. 2) the cucumber ""felt like 100 ways"" dish was genius and played on many trends in fine dining. 3) The asparagus gelato topping majama de Atun was one of my favorites ever, but I think they should have put it at the end, not the beginning, as it felt dessert-y. 4) The coconut dish, percorino were too small, even for a delicious bite.  5) The pork belly ""taco"" dish was a very inventive take on a taco deconstructed. Genius. 6) I didn't taste any notable truffle in the grain and seed dish. Sometimes the dish ingredients were announced before the table's attention was on the host, and as a result, I found myself guessing several times until the menu was provided at the end.  7) The crispy snacks on the table were good, and if this place wasn't pristinely clean, this would have bothered me. Our obnoxious neighbors appears to be disassembling the table-piece as they got drunker. The kale chip in particular was interesting and the right size.  Things that annoyed me:  1) I'm left-handed. Alexa, the wife of Jake, noted this on the way in. But her server did not note this, twice, unannouncedly bumping into my left arm with a plate instead of serving the plate from the right, where I sat, an unobstructed way to bring the dish in. In one case my spoon almost was knocked off the table and in a second case, my hand hit a plate and I was annoyed with the infraction throughout the course. 2) This was not, with the exception of the A5 Wagyu a $200 meal in terms of ingredients. Notably absent from the menu relative to these other reviews were a lot of the things that we were looking forward to, and perhaps expecting. No foie gras, no dark chocolate, no veal, etc. I left hungry, only masked by the alcohol *we* had provided (and were served). 3) Speaking of alcohol, we were asked to surrender the wines at the beginning, which might be an infraction of the byob rules for Chicago, I would have thought they'd be more attentive to this detail. I didn't appreciate being called a ""party table"" by Alexa at the beginning, a detail that seems to impose a one-sized-fits-all approach to our members.  4) The host directed to sit at one end of the table upon entry, in a manner that increased the segregation of us with the communal party throughout the meal. The lack of communal explanation brought the experience down a bit. The 7 basically ignored us with the exception of some niceties. 5) I got to retrieve my own coat at the end, after finding it. 6) The top tier of restaurants is accustomed to interactivity with the patrons. Twice I hinted at that within ear shot of the hosts, once noting a recent article in Crains where the diners were actually researched before the meal. Having this interpersonal ""wall"" up for the service irked me as I felt left 100% to my party.  7) I know they are starting but while I liked the stemware very much (interesting actually) and the plateware (Trotter plates, cool idea, yes please), I did not like the silverware (plain for a place of this price-point). Several dishes we were provided with nothing more than a spoon and I could have used a knife to work off of, not just my finger.  8) They ended with a coffee dish. I do not like coffee and nor do lots of people. I've never seen a place force the patrons into a coffee ""dish"" instead of asking if they would like it.  9) The table could easily be out another foot from the wall to prevent the feeling that I was almost bumping into the other patrons each time I needed to use the restroom. I felt myself ducking between the interesting wine cork wall that protruded and not bumping a few of the guys in the 7 party that had chairs kind of sticking out. I did like the chairs they picked and found them ""top tier"" worthy.  10) The decor in this place is an Elizabeth restaurant rip-off, woodland table bouquet and open stainless steel. I usually expect something visually new at $200. I think almost all of these attributes that I had issues with can be corrected. I look forward to trying this place again in 6 months or a year when they get into their service stride.  I think it is a welcome addition to Uptown.",0.9973,0.837,0.123,0.04,0.5027561327561327

Also, let's be honest -- it's cheaper for one than 4 people. So i came out ahead. literally and figuratively. Pleasant people. In fact so nice, i had to wait two days to write this up. Really clean place. The area is so so but I reckon this is the fashionable thing. Street parking for two hours so you need to go back 2/3 of your meal and re-do the parking. There may be some larger parking spots around. My water tasted too chemical...i asked the server if it were filtered. He said no. Luckily they had their perrier.  All dishes were done cleanly and beautifully. All the chefs seemed like they had just taken their shower. Despite me loving dives, i really enjoy the cleanliness. The soup was delicious. The greens in the salad were not impressive but all else including the beetroot beautifully done. The fish was delicious. Salmon nigiri. Nothing to write home about.  The Uni (and by the way Uni is probably my favorite order when i go to sushi bars and this is how i test them) was ok. The idea of brioche and all that was nice. Veal sweetbread. Ok Duck. I have had much better but again beautifully done. Somehow i think my piece was not as good as the other people's. Foie Gras. Excellent. Dark choco.  fine. pecorino in three forms, nice idea. Chicory, cardamom. nice. Overall recommended. I go back but not with the family as i do not think my gorgeous son will have much to eat there. Talking about much to eat. I felt a bit hungry when i left. I am glad they are in Chicago and sincerely wish them the best. Loved the music selection. Not a first date type of place as everyone seemed to feel they had to talk to the (new) person next to them. Value. about $200 all inclusive per person. I'd say a bit on the high side but considering all the staff there, they deserve every penny they make. Now, i have to go back to Elizabeth again and compare. Fairness is a good excuse.

Food  Jake kept some of his staples (only fine-tuning them to perfection) The winners included the potato soup (may I add with white sturgeon caviar?!), duck three ways, the mind blowing sweetbread, the cheese in the class paradise, the honey cream ball and the beet macaroon which replaced one of my former favorites called ""24 hour beet""... (even better!) It was super neat that almost every course had a sentimental story behind it... kind of like the Trotter's bite, made in the memory of Charley Trotter and served in the original china from his restaurant - Bravo!

2014-03-16,5.0,A simply amazing experience. Chef  Jake and his wife Alexa make an amazing team.  The 15 course dinner was so unique and  a true culinary delight.  I can't wait to go back.,0.9389,0.632,0.368,0.0,0.575
2014-03-02,5.0,"Enjoyed my time at the Chef's Counter on Friday night.  Alex was charming and each course was nothing short of ethereal. (Strong work, Chef Jake!)  My date doesn't drink, so they were very gracious about substituting the gelee in his juniper jump, no problem. I enjoyed the small group atmosphere and interacting with the Chef.  Even though the experience is pricey (Around $207/seat),  it was worth it.  Also, it was nice to pre-pay, so when you're done with dinner, you can totally jam out. Just a quick note: while I was full at the end of the night (5'5""/120), my date (6'2""/205) needed some additional sustenance.  (Not sure if this is a tall dude/small woman issue, but something to think about.)  I thought the portions were perfect, but the date wanted a bigger hunk of duck.  Overall, I would totally go again.  Amazing food.  Great ambiance.  And, they have spare pashminas for ladies who are chilly. :)",0.9852,0.782,0.198,0.02,0.6534391534391535
2014-02-15,5.0,"Simply a fantastic dining experience. Alexa and Jake were wonderful hosts, essentially welcoming us (and a few other people) to join them in their restaurant. The space is open and welcoming, where everything is visible. We sat at the bar, where we were able to interact with other guests and the staff. Alexa in particular was engaging throughout, both explaining each of the 15 courses and chatting about any topic that came up. The music mix completely undercut any possible tone of pretentiousness, again giving the whole feel one of comfort and inclusion. And then there's the food. Jake's background at Charlie Trotter's, Alinea, and Schwa are evident, though his culinary voice is his own. There were no wrong notes the entire evening, though plenty of highlights (soup, salmon w/ trout roe and dashi, a coconut tom yum dumpling, the sweetbread, dessert, and coffee). Really, each course was a standout. We loosely followed the wine suggestions with a Chablis, a young red Burgundy, and an auslese riesling, and it all came together beautifully. We'll certainly be back in coming months - looking forward to Jake's summer menu!",0.9722,0.824,0.15,0.026,0.46315496098104797
2014-02-09,5.0,"The place is a welcome addition to the Uptown Neighborhood.  The food is on par with the big name places already in town (Alinea, Schwa, etc.).  Even better than the food was the experience.  It is very intimate and you get to spend a lot of time talking with the chef and his wife (hostess).  They really make you feel like you are enjoying dinner in their kitchen/living room.  They did a nice job explaining the food and the best approach to tackling each dish. Because of the intimate environment, the minimal seating and the type of food, this place is not good for children.  It is better to schedule the babysitter and take your partner for that special night out.  It is a fine dining experience in a casual environment, I would say ""sexy casual.""   My one complaint, which is not enough to drop a star, was that the beginning of the meal felt a little rushed.  It is difficult when they serve everyone together so if you are not all part of the same party, eating at different paces can be tough.  This seemed to correct itself as the meal went one. The current menu has a strong Asian influence to it.  I overhead that the menu will change come spring.  This is definitely a place to save up for and then sit back and enjoy.",0.9896,0.775,0.191,0.034,0.5458809523809524

So warm and the food is out of this world, I've been to almost every Next meal, and all the other greats. But this place is a ""not to miss."" Get tickets now!

2014-01-22,5.0,"My husband surprised me with dinner here to celebrate my 42nd birthday...how apropos! The experience was extremely enjoyable. It began with a warm welcome by Alexa who served as hostess and kept us at ease and informed. The other diners were pleasant and the setting was relaxing yet elegant. The evening was perfectly paced and the food was delicious! As the finale, Chef Jake thanked us at the table and we had the chance to discuss his course preparations. As residents of Uptown, it's exciting to have this addition to our neighborhood to further expand our diverse and unique restaurant options! They even personalized my copy of the menu with a birthday message. I would absolutely recommend 42 grams!",0.9928,0.675,0.325,0.0,0.810897435897436

2014-01-13,5.0,"Absolutely fantastic! We went with a group of 5 friends and sat at the Chef's counter on Saturday night. As recommended, we brought a Sauv Blanc and several reds including a pinot, malbec, cab and brachetto. We actually skipped the malbec and cab in place of one of our  server's, Emily's, recommendation to pair the brachetto instead starting with the foie gras dish. It was a fantastic reco and I would definitely suggest bringing a lighter dessert wine like that to not overpower the dishes once you're past the meat courses. The space is great - cozy without being crowded - very sleek and romantic. It was so much fun to chat with Chef Jake, his sous chef Tom, Chef's wife Alexa and server Emily while we ate and drank. The food was absolutely fantastic - but I think Chef may have a future in cocktails too as the amuse was an amazing jellified (I don't think that's a word) Hendrick's, cucumber and hibiscus concoction.  Definitely eager to go back!",0.9865,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.4514705882352942
2014-01-11,5.0,"I've heard great things about sous rising and i was really impressed with the level of food served here. The food is a nice balance between creativity, playfulness and taste.   The followings are what I had:  1) Amuse 2) Juniper Jump 3) Potato Soup 4) Beet Salad 5) Tom Yum 6) Flavor of the sea 7) Catalina Island Uni 8) SweetBread 9) Duck Breast 10) Foie Gras 11) Chocolate Sweets 12) Cheese 3 ways If you have a chance to go, you definitely won't regret it. Also, the restaurant is practically run by the chef and his wife and its interior is decorated like someone's living and dining room, which put you at ease (I did the chef's counter and it brings me to the good days when I ate at my mom's kitchen. The communal table is set like a family dining table). Hence, it really does feel like you're going to someone's house to eat.",0.9905,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.7214285714285714
