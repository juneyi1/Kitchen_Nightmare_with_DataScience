They better open up another restaurant in its place. And it better be super amazingly awesome or else heads will roll. HEADS WILL ROLL, I TELL YA!",0.9763,0.628,0.372,0.0,0.5851851851851851
2005-11-17,1.0,"I have only been here once in the summer but I did not have a good experience at all! We sat in the back outdoor patio, which is gorgeous on a nice day, but the service was terrible! Our waitress totally forgot about us, or food, and basically everything! I think we had to wait at least 1 hour for the food when we were the first ones there. Plus, we had to ask for it twice before getting it. And the food was only mediocre. Nothing special. I don't know if I just had a bad experience on an off-day, but I don't think I will be going back.",0.3853,0.784,0.115,0.101,0.6586734693877551
