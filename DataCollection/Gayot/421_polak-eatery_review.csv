2015-10-08,1.0,"Tried pierogis out of their food truck. I didn't like a single thing. I really don't get the hype.  I paid $11 for 2 potato and cheese, 2 braised beef, and 2 spinach pierogis, and a sausage on the side. I got all the toppings they offered except sour cream but that still couldn't save the meal for me.  The food was cold which I won't hold against them but it could be impacting the flavor. The pierogis just didn't taste savory and all the stuffing had about the same consistency. How is it that potato and cheese, and braised beef, and spinach all look the same consistency wise ?  If I get an empanada and take a bite, I will see strips of chicken and actual chunks of potato. The insides for all of them just looked like compacted mush.

Since I just needed a snack I got the 4 for $7.  They were offering two meat based and two vegetarian options. My friend got the spinach and cheese while I got the braised beef. You have your option of toppings so I got the sauerkraut and my friend had the spicy sautéed onions.  Both were really delicious. The onions were indeed spicy but added great flavor to the pierogi. The sauerkraut I got had flax and cumin seeds in it, and wasn't over powering with vinegar. The beef was nice and juicy and had the right mix of seasoning. With a bit of sour cream for each of us we had the right combination. I would love to eat here again and try different toppings.

I am a paying customer and wanted to sit down and eat and came in during their posted hours only to be told that I have to take my food to go. It was just tacky.

The meat pierogi also deserve special attention--not just boring ground meat, but flavorful pot roast cooked until totally tender.  Looking for a unique food to bring to a potluck?

The only real complaint I had was the size.  These are some small little nuggets of goodness...two bites and they're gone.  I easily could've eaten an order of 6 by myself, since we didn't order sandwiches. They also serve keilbasa (after 10 years of not eating meat, this is the one thing I still crave) as well as a few other sandwich options, if pierogies alone won't tide you over.  But the real motivation for coming in this particular weekend was the paczkis.  They weren't the best I've ever had (not enough jelly...although can there ever really be enough jelly?!) but they hit the spot.   The restaurant itself is really cute and not hard to get to at all if you're in Humboldt or Wicker Park.  I'm definitely looking forward to coming back here and taking my family next time they're in town. But let me state for the record: While these pierogies may be really freaking good, none will ever be better than my mom's.

2014-11-03,5.0,"I came cross Polak Eatery via Yelp and figured this place was worth trying out. I'm so glad my boyfriend and I did. We went in late Sunday morning for a ""mini-brunch."" We weren't starving, but wanted a little nosh to hold through for a late lunch ahead. We decided to order four pierogies ($6) and a breakfast plate (two eggs, piece of kielbasa, two pierogies) ($6). For the pierogies, they allow you to mix and match flavors (braised beef, cheddar potato, spinach & ricotta, kraut & mushroom) and you can choose from a variety of fixings such as sour cream, caramelized onions, sauerkraut, and bacon (thankfully it comes with!).  We ordered the cheddar potato and braised beef pierogies. The cheddar potato was perfect because it wasn't overly cheesy or salty. Flavor wise, I liked the braised beef, but it was slightly drier than I had hoped. It wasn't bad enough to warrant a lower rating. The pierogies were nicely prepared -- much better than those frozen ones I used to buy as a child from aisle 3 in the supermarket. Many cultures have a version of a dumpling, but these most reminded me of Chinese potstickers. Slightly crispy or firm on the outside and very moist and soft in the inside. The toppings all work whether individually or all together. They're not random; they show that thought was put into this. The sunny-side up eggs were nicely cooked; runny yolks are always a joy to eat. The kielbasa was tasty and I think it was pan-fried because it had a good crunch outside. Polak Eatery's decor is minimal. There is a mural presumably of Poland's landscape in fifty shades of gray (not the book, but the color). There is plenty of room to move around, but with limited seating. Having said that, I think they could probably squeeze in a couple more tables and chairs. So far, since the business is new, it was full, but not packed. Most lovely was the fact that the business owner, Damien, came by to greet my boyfriend and me as we ate. It always helps to have the owner come out and greet customers. That's how a small business is run. Overall, I recommend this spot.
