2010-12-01,1.0,"We saw this restaurant near our hotel and since it was very cold decided to give it a try despite mixed reviews on Yelp. A big mistake. We ordered a bottle of mid priced wine and it tasted like vinegar, so we sent it back. So we decided maybe we should choose a different label and chose  the most expensive bottle in our selected category. We were shocked when it came with a screw top cap (as did the first bottle). It was mediocre at best. There is just no cache with a screw top cap on a bottle of wine when dining in what is supposed to be a fine food establishment. The waiter asked if we want to keep it chilled since it was a white wine. We said yes so he said he had to keep at the bar! A very strange thing to do.That pretty much did in the idea of a romantic meal when we had to signal him to refill our glasses and waited for several minutes with empty glasses while he waited on other customers. For our meal, we each chose a seafood entree - the halibut and salmon. Again, we found them mediocre at best. The pink peppercorn sauce on the salmon looked more like beef gravy with peppercorns and really had no taste. The halibut also was tasteless. Very disappointing and I would not recommend the restaurant.",0.8623,0.8,0.115,0.085,0.4633333333333333

2010-07-06,1.0,"I had the worst dining experience of my life on Sunday, July 4.  My boyfriend and I decided to get a nice dinner and he wanted Italian so I suggested Bice.  We arrived just before 7:00 pm and were seated immediately.  At this point the restaurant was more than half empty but it filled up quickly.  They seated a couple with a screaming toddler to the left of us and another couple to the right of us.  We waited and waited, enduring the screams from the toddler seated next to us, for someone to take our order.  And it was really warm, my boyfriend went upstairs to the men's room and said that he found the air conditioning, and it was upstairs.  Finally the waiter came but went to the table to our right and took their order first, then came to our table, this bothered me because we had been seated first and this couple had come in at least 5 minutes after we did.  When the waiter finally came to take our order, I told the waiter that I was trying to decide between the lasagna and the linguine and asked what he suggested, he pointed to the 2 house specialties and I asked which was his favorite and he responded that he would choose the Pappardell al Teleforno Come Bice Milano, which is homemade large noodles with tomato, basil and melted mozzarella cheese, so I went with his recommendation.  My boyfriend had a dish with homemade pasta quills, chicken, and mushrooms.  Once again we waited.  The couple to our right and the couple with the screaming child to our left were served their meals, and their bills, paid and left and we were still sitting there waiting.  We asked our waiter, who seemed to be the only waiter for the entire room, twice about our order, he said it was coming.  We were getting ready to walk out when they brought our food.  And after tasting mine, I wish we had walked out.  The large noodles were clumped together and lying in a tomato based cheese sauce, an unappetizing Italian version of mac and cheese.  I couldn't eat it, it was horrible.  The waiter came over to ask how everything was and I pushed my plate away and told him it was disappointing.  He did nothing but walk away, did not offer me another entrée, just walked away.  My boyfriend said his dish was mediocre and he only ate half.  And I must say that he is thin but has a hearty appetite and I have never seen him leave food in his plate, ever.  The waiter removed our dishes and he could clearly see that I had not eaten mine but he still charged us for it; he made no attempt to thank us for putting up with the screaming child and offer us a free dessert, he made no apology for the delayed food, nothing.  While we were getting up to leave we heard a woman from another table complain that they had been waiting 20 minutes and no one had taken their order yet.  I decided to complain to hostess about the poor service, the lack of air conditioning and the poor quality of the food and when I approached her there was already another customer with similar complaints.  I waited until the other woman stopped talking and added my complaints assuring her that we would never eat there again nor recommend it to any of our friends or business associates.  Again, a blank expression, not offers to try and make things better.  As I said this is the worst dining experience I have ever had and I have had better pasta at California Pizza Kitchen and Pizza Capri.  If you are in the neighborhood and considering going to Bice, don't, go across the street to Viand, which is what we should have done.  Bice should refund every person who was inside their restaurant on the night of July 4.",-0.9898,0.823,0.063,0.114,0.545694022289767

2010-06-16,2.0,"I feel like I went on a bad ""match date"" the other night. You know the one. Where the person who shows up looks nothing like their picture and is obviously much older and more tired than any pic you have seen.  Such was my night at Bice. I thought I knew what to expect. After all- I've been to the ""sister"" restaurants in New York, Orlando and San Diego. Those gals are sleek, contemporary and stylish. Their service is spot on. And their food is amazing.  So what about Chicago's Bice? Just a poor imitation, in my opinion. We walked in to a tired looking bar area where we couldn't sit before dinner as the seats were reserved. Okay then. So we sat at a table and waited for the rest of our party to arrive. Service was pretty good in the bar area. When we got seated in the restaurant- the first table they put us at was right in front of the swinging kitchen door. The rug the servers walk on so to not slip was under our feet (that's how close we were). The manager walks by and hears us discussing this and at least takes action to move us to the back room- away from the hustle and bustle.  Good move yet the decor in that area was no better. Tired looking hanging window shades separated the various spaces, the wall sconces were a kilter and it just felt tired and worn.  As for the food there were some ""no no's"" here as well. The good Italian bread came with butter packets. Butter packets in a fine dining restaurant never work. They belong in a pancake house. The Italian bread was good, the accompanying foccacia bread was dry to the point of tasting stale- so bad that even those butter packets couldn't help. We ordered some antipasto and calamari to start. Not bad but our server kept calling the antipasto plate ""lunchmeat"". I get that he thought that was a descriptor (and I guess you could make a sandwich out of the prosciutto, and mortadella) but it took the whole experience down a few levels (perhaps the butter packets were his idea as well?) The antipasto plate needed more cheese as well. One piece of pecorino was not enough.  As for our entrees- I ended up with the winner in the bunch. I had the Bice special ravioli stuffed with short rib and served with a mushroom sauce. Very tasty. The other pasta dishes, didn't fare so well. The Bice special of pasta ribbons with cheese and basil was bland and tasteless with the noodles stuck together, and the bolognese was average at best. Hard to believe this is the same chain that usually has me raving about the food.  Service on this night was off as well. There were plenty of people waiting on us, but no one really ""taking care of"" us. Case in point- we asked for some additional olive oil and balsamic vinegar for our salad, and one guy brought one and another person the other. The bad thing? They both came so late that we were done with the salad when they showed up.  Valet parking is available up front for $12. You may have to wait a few minutes for the guy to show up as he seems to be working the restaurants around the corner as well.  So, like any bad ""match date"", I chalked this up to experience and went my merry way. There are so many great Italian restaurants in our city. I only wish I could put Bice on that list.",0.9888,0.825,0.114,0.061,0.47640749902654667

2010-01-25,5.0,"When I read negative reviews of Bice, I not only cringe, buy my chest tightens, my brow furrows, and my pits go into sweaty overdrive. Bice is located off Michigan and the view isn't like the one in Naples, FL, correct. But it has more of the feeling of Bice New York (the original). Each of the Bice restaurants has their own amazing Chef and each menu is tweaked depending on what's in season, what is freshest, and somewhat to the tastes and likes of the regional public.  Ever since Avanzare closed, Bice is where I head for my three hour lunches, making my way through the menu slowly, and course by course, wine by wine.  The service is yes, admittedly reminiscent of an older era, but isn't that what you expect from an authentic upscale Northern Italian eatery? Just be lucky you're paying in Dollars and not in Euros!  The wines are excellent, the service is knowledgeable (my favorite server has been at Bice for over 20 years!), and with all that, is a lot less pretentious than any of the ""hip"" or "" unoriginal"" hotel dining spots nearby (the W down the street is the exception to that comment of course). My favorite: Four cheese pappardelle. Real homemade, handmade noodles, and the cheeses! This combination is the painstaking combination of hours of prep, all for ME ME ME! Tip: while it's not jacket and tie expensive, bring the bills along so you can experience it all... meaning wine too! Anecdote: Once I brought a girl here, she didn't like the chocolate profiterole.

I tried each dish and I must say mine was the favorite! The orchette needed more flavor....and the gnocchi had really sweet sauce (almost too sweet)...but nonetheless it was pretty good.

2010-01-18,1.0,"Who ever said this was their favorite Italian Restaurant in Chicago is living a sheltered life. This place is horrible. The service is like 1980's fine dining, lame and not up to date with proper standards.  We entered this establishment on a Sunday night and every single thing Bice did took forever. Water, bread, server, etc. The start was basic, just slow and as the food came in courses it became clear that this place was not worth the effort. Every item on the menu is over priced and not worth the time to try. The Minestrone soup was bland like it came from a can. The calamari was just bread crumbs, no squid with Jewel spaghetti sauce as the dipping side. The Lamb/beef filled ravioli were poor and kept me up all night with indigestion. The lobster ravioli was tasteless and filled with peas, which was the only thing you could taste. The gnoochi was the worst dish, all you could taste was this pungent blue cheese sauce that over powered the dish and the smell around the dish. I asked for my esspresso then the waiter came back and asked us again as if the first time didn't count. The Bice gift card that was purchased through Bice was not accepted. We would have never walked through the doors if the card wasn't given to us as a Christmas gift. The only thing the server and manager said was that it was our problem to figure out and made us feel like we were trying to scam them, with their own card?? Then, the server refused to split the checks. If you are a party of 3 or more couples, don't go there. They'll just tell you that the computer won't allow more than three cards. I've been in the restaurant industry since 1993, yes the computer doesn and it's a very simple process. Computers like Aloha and Micros will let you do whatever you want. Maybe their servers are just incompetent.  It took us over 30 minutes just to get our credit cards back from the manager and server. They never apologized or thanked us. They were the rudest staff I've ever encountered in Chicago. That establishment is filled with second rate staff and poor food. You're better off going somewhere like Gino's or a cheap italian place down the street. The servers will be nicer and your bill will be lesser.

Atmosphere: casual elegance, with waiters dressed in crisp white shirts & ties, yet not at all stuffy or causing you to feel that you're inappropriately dressed for a quick lunch, etc. Food: delicious! My favorite is really the homemade pastas they have on hand, as well as their delicious salads.  I strongly suggest asking them to personalize any dish, they do so without complaint and are quite accommodating in that sense.  Everything I've had here is good, even down to the free bread you get on the table.  There's also a great wine selection if you are interested. Service: friendly and reliable.  It's the type of place where you feel like there are multiple people attending to your needs instead of one waiter who disappears.  There's always refills and anything else you could ask for available in a quick amount of time.

2008-12-01,3.0,"Like others have mentioned, Bice is expensive and you are mainly going to be paying for the location versus blow-you-away / knock-your-socks-off food.  Living right around the corner, I used to frequent Bice many a night, especially when I didn't want to prepare a meal after a long day of work. I have mainly gone there during the Summer months when you can eat al fresco. The location itself is beautifully decorated and makes you feel like you are swept away at an Italian cafe, overlooking Lake Como perhaps : ) And like any true Italian café and restaurant, they follow tradition at Bice by having primarily Italian servers. They speak the language. They know the food. They are familiar with the wines, or so I thought! My last rendezvous at Bice was during a Summer night while I was looking forward to a great Chianti with my traditional order of Lobster and Crab ravioli (which I have always loved, but think that for $18, 5 ravioli pieces is a bit mediocre). Either way, on this particular night, I had ordered a Chianti, and the minute the glass was delivered by the middle aged man serving us, I knew it was Merlot. Now I don't consider myself a wine expert or snob by any means, but I absolutely hate Merlot and I know both its color and smell by heart. I took one sip just to be on the safe side or to rule out my craziness, and yes in fact it was a Merlot. I called the server over and attempted to explain to him that there must have been a mistake because this glass of wine was a Merlot. He looked at me with this ""what an American idiot"" look of disgust and tried to explain to me that he had seen the bartender fill up the glass with his own eyes, so it was the Chianti. When I explained to him that I love red wine, but hate Merlot and that I am an expert at knowing whether or not I hate something, he agreed upon my prodding to have the bartender pour the Chianti again and we would compare it side by side. Normally this is where a server just apologizes and goes and gets the right glass pour, but this guy was up for a fight, and he was messing with the wrong gal because I had a fire in my belly that night. When the wine arrives, there is a clear distinction between them in just color alone. One that on a clear Summer night around 6:00 p.m., when the sun is still available to challenge all wine discrepancies, there it was, a light hue of purple versus a burgundy Red. The waiter, baffled and embarrassed by this American idiot, scurried off, blaming his eyesight for the mistake, no apology, still disgruntled about life in general, and especially a young woman challenging his craft.           Either way, I have not been to Bice since that time.

2008-08-15,4.0,"Bice at lunch When I worked over on Boul Mich one of my favorite places to entertain clients was Bice. I liked taking people to Grand Lux too [see my review for them in my profile], but this is just a bit nicer, more intimate and the menu, while not as extensive as Grand Lux, still has a sizeable lunch menu with plenty of slightly-higher end selections from which to choose. The theme here is decidedly Italian, scratch that, it's not just a theme, it's their standard and they do a fine job. Antipasti can start with classics like fried goat cheese on baby greens, or spiedino of fresh mozzarella, tomato and prosciutto to the unique but approachable veal and ricotta meatballs or fried shrimp and asparagus ""skins"" on gorgonzola cheese sauce. There are at least three different carpaccios from which to choose on any given day. A recent visit had me pitting octopus against the classic beef and the succulent tuna; the tuna won. Bice has a bevy of salads from which to choose as well. You can make a meal out of a light Antipasti and the seafood-themed Cobb salad replete with lobster, crabmeat and bacon. Soups to start are classic but perfectly season Minestrone and Cannellini bean. The pasta course runs the gamut and covers so much territory that they are bound to have your favorite: penne, rigatoni, homemade spaghetti and fettuccine all get classic and contemporary treatments, but my all time favorite has to be Pici Toscani, homemade pici pasta with sautéed porcini mushrooms in a garlic/olive oil sauce. Bice does a very nice risotto too and they usually over a few different preparations. Seafood is fresh, delicious and generally classico. When I opt for tuna carppacio I opt for the spiedino grilled bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp and scallops in a lobster bisque ""sauce"" and usually ask for a vegetable substitute in lieu of mashed potatoes, but theirs are good enough that it's difficult to stop from eating them all. Chicken pervades the proteins at Bice. It is pounded, stuffed and stuffed in a few different ways. Pork, lamb and veal are well-prepared too, my favorite being the medallion of pork wrapped ... in what else ... bacon. A cooler weather selection, this dish is reminiscent of a fall day with the wine and sage sauce all brought together by the perfectly salty Parmesan risotto. Starches and vegetables are a la carte. Tuscan fries are fry perfection and too so are the roasted vegetables. Garlic spinach is bright and clean and if you're going for the asparagus, opt for the Parmesan sauce.  Dessert is kept minimal; choose gelato or sorbet, or opt for an after dinner grappa or port. Get thee to Bice. I'll see you at the bar.",0.9977,0.823,0.165,0.012,0.5818181818181819

We finished the meal with dessert. I had the tiramisu. It was divine. Of course, we had wine too.

Leyla A., take note- they have not one, but TWO coat checks, and I was asked not once, but TWICE, if I would like them to take my coat! When I arrived, I was ushered upstairs into what looked like a banquet hall, if only a smaller version.  We had a choice of four entrees- Gnocchi al pomodoro e basilico, tortelloni di ricotta e spinaci con burro e salvia, petto di pollo farcito con salsa al cabernet, or pesche alla provenzale con erbe aromatiche (I don't know if these dishes are on the regular menu or not). The salad (Caesar) was very good, with generous slices of parmesan cheese. My date and I both had the chicken, which was stuffed with prosciutto and mozzarella in a cabernet wine reduction sauce, the other couple at our table both had the fish, a sauteed swordfish steak.  The portions were generous to say the least, but nobody was particularly blown away with the food- both of the people who got the fish said it was dry, our chicken, while done, was a bit cool, especially the filling at the center, like they had been prepared earlier, then reheated before serving.  The dessert was either a tiramisu or Panna Cotta, an egg-less custard.  My date had the tiramisu, which she enjoyed, I decided to try the custard, which was tasty, but the presentation left a little to be desired- it was a small, pure-white custard sitting on top of a pure-white plate, in a drizzle of vaguely-flavored 'tropical fruit sauce'.  It would have been better had it been garnished with some fruit to add a little color to the plate... a sauce with a bit of a stronger flavor would have also been welcomed. Bottom-line: I'd try Bice again to see if the lackluster food was, as I suspected, due to them attempting to serve a large group of people all at once, banquet-style... but I wouldn't go out of my way specifically to eat at Bice.",0.9933,0.864,0.13,0.006,0.5205761599511599

I ordered the veal scallopini, with sun-dried tomatoes and garlic mash in a white wine sauce. The textures were quite excellent, and the sun-dried tomatoes, while usually overwhelming, were quite mild. These were probably the mildest (and reddest) sun-dried tomatoes I've had. Others had ordered such delectable dishes like the Chilean sea bass, broiled halibut, veal ravioli, and the crab ravioli. I managed to sneak off with a single crab ravioli in a creamy saffron sauce. I took one bite, and finally knew what real saffron tastes like. The pasta was a perfect al dente, with the crab not fighting with the creamy sauce.  They also left out a menu item on their website -- pumpkin ravioli, with pumpkins not in season. I respect that about a restaurant, leaving something off a menu when a featured ingredient is not in season, rather than serving a mediocre version thereof.

2006-11-26,4.0,great local italian - especially if you are staying at the courtyard marriott across the street...just a block down from michigan ave...so walk over here okay- the pasta is insane...the server and hostesses- um are beautifully prepared as well but back to the pasta...YUM great service - i am coming back!,0.907,0.699,0.267,0.034,0.4288888888888889
2006-09-01,5.0,"I'm shocked by the mediocre reviews! Stephanie K. - I cannot believe you spent $75 here. The small salad (which is more like a large) is only $5. I've only eaten the salads at Bice, and that's all I'll probably ever get. The speed those ladies make the salads is amazing. I love that they put green beans in the salad! The ceasar dressing is sooo tasty. They also have the best rosemary basil bread sitting near the register for you to take. It's free and you can have as much as you want! The drink refills are free too! I'm addicted to their salads. I had one 3 out of the 5 days I worked last week. Bice is my new lunch spot. There is never a line. The absolute best salad I've ever tasted, and only $5!",0.9798,0.798,0.186,0.015,0.5840810704447068
2006-07-31,4.0,"UPDATE: This update is regarding Bice Grill, the counterservice to-go deli attached to Bice Ristorante. I'm going to bump up my rating of 3 stars to 4 because I love Bice Grill's salads. They're the perfect to-go lunch. You can customize what you want on them, and for only $5, they are the perfect lunch. After walking by the lively alfresco dining section of Bice everyday at lunch, I really wanted to try the food. While perusing the menu, my gut kept telling me to go for one of the salads--it was a hot day and I wanted something light. But I saw that certain pasta selections were homemade, and how can anyone pass up homemade pasta??? So, I ordered the gorgonzola gnocchi with pinenuts & walnuts and my friend chose the veal ravioli. The service was excellent and the food was good--not great. I wanted to be wowed, and I was simply satisfied. I certainly wish I had seen Jessica M.'s review--because 1/2 the portion would have been plenty (in fact, my leftovers are still sitting in the fridge at work). Then, just to rub salt in the wound, the couple next to us ordered salads--and they looked delicious! Maybe next time--although I'll probably end up going to the Bice Grill instead of the restaurant. I had the hazelnut gelato for dessert which was really good, but again, way too much for one person. Overall, my experience was mediocre and the $75 price tag left me wanting more.",0.975,0.873,0.127,0.0,0.593167701863354
2006-07-29,5.0,"I had a great dinner here!  My entree was amazing, but my friend did not like his because of a strange aftertaste of the sauce they used on his.  The waiter promptly replaced the dish with a similar entree using a different sauce.   The prices are a bit hight, but Bice is a upper class restaurant, so that is to be expected.",0.6885,0.776,0.148,0.076,0.45714285714285713
2006-07-27,5.0,"Bice is one of my staples.  I've gone here on dates, with my parents, with  my best friend - it's great for any occasion.   The food is wonderful - try the penne arrabiatta (they do half orders although they don't mention this on the menu), the pumpkin salad, or the tiramisu.   All completely delish.  I lived in Italy for 6 months, and this place is fairly authentic, foodwise.  The only comparable Italian place I've been to is Merlo on Maple.  Bice is great!",0.9665,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5685185185185184
2006-04-18,3.0,"I only came in for dessert with friends, so my review is very limited.  The price range is slightly high for the small desserts.  I was totally blown away, though, by the chocolatissimo, a perfect marriage between gelato, flourless chocolate cake, and chocolate oooozing everywhere.",0.6815,0.813,0.142,0.046,0.645952380952381

2005-08-12,3.0,"The exterior of Bice (say it like bee-chay) has the look of a weathered but colorful old building in Italy. The food here is good but perhaps overpriced. Then again, this is the heart of tourist central along Ontario Street so maybe the upscale dishes like risotto or veal are not overpriced. I have had better risotto than what is served here. The al fresco dining area in front is always packed.",0.9136,0.839,0.161,0.0,0.39
