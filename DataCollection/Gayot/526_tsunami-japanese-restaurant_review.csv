The decor is very pretty, the service was good, however the sushi was just okay, not bad, but definitely not the best since we have not returned since. I do remember that I loved the unagi sauce, it wasn't too thick or too thin, and just the perfect amount of sugar used in it. The rolls were fresh and decent, so it is a decent sushi place. I know that they have out door seating which is also a plus, even thought we sat somewhere inside that gave it a romantic feel. Would i come here again? Maybe, am I dying to go back?

When we got thre, the palce was kinda dead, but yet, we were directed to a separate atrium with a big window looking out to the street,a nd a table right in the middle where were sat in. I think they had reserved that for us, and it was really nice, actually. I had the Pan seared tuna with bok choy and my BF had the Japanese box.(haha)...Anywho, I thouroughly enjoyed the tuna, especially with its creamy caper-buttery cream sauce underneath to dip in, and the bok choy was nice; the only thing is I wish they would have some more grain to go along with so much protein, but to no avail. Towards the end, I got the dessert, I think they called it the chocolate tower or something...Sooooooo good, and delicious, I couldn't even finish the whole thing...Well worth it, though.....

Then we began to be served, the servers were very attentive and helpful. There were some things on the menu that I'd not seen before and needed help understanding. Some places that look this nice on the inside can get rather pretentious...this place was different. We ended up getting two flights of sake, which were all wonderful and the server took the time to tell us about each sake before we tasted. Then we got our sushi, and our sushi was wonderful, I ate mostly sashimi, and it was so very fresh. Their menu had a lot of options, many not normally found at a sushi restaurant and had an astonishing 6 types of tuna, only bested by a place in Miami for me, unfortunately three of the fish that we ordered were not being carried at the moment. That always strikes me a bit off, if it is on your normal menu it should always be available or be made aware at the start of the meal. Still the fish was incredibly good and the experience was wonderful.  It wasn't the cheapest of places, but it was definitely worth the cost.",0.9625,0.869,0.116,0.015,0.7

The service was so slow!  I had reservations as soon as I walked in: first, I looked around, and the place appeared to be filled with tourists.  I mean, that's the location, so I should have expected it.   Second, they didn't have any sashimi plates for one person.  I like sushi straight up - nothing complicated.   I see the value and enjoyment of a cutesy pretty roll, but when I have a sushi craving all I want is high quality fish, wasabi, and a little soy sauce.  So the only way I could get sashimi was ordering separate little Nigiri pieces and paying extra for just sashimi.  Bad value and annoying. Anyway, when we saw they it took thirty minutes to make a roll, and an extra twenty minutes for each extra little piece of nigiri, we got discouraged and left, even though we were still hungry.   The bill wasn't *that* bad, if you consider that it's sushi and you pay for location, but it wasn't good value either.  We had asked them to make a simple asparagus roll and sweet potato roll for one of the vegetarians at the table, and they charged us the same for each of those as they did for a tuna roll.  I don't know in what world sweet potato costs as much as tuna, but I don't think it's Chicago.",0.8248,0.787,0.127,0.086,0.4922865353037766

I had my fraternity days, and don't care to revisit them without the good friends I made in those days.  So we have the establishment. We had a large party very late at night, so that means we were seated symmetrically in the center tower room, with its high ceilings and rafters. Made for a pretty cool experience.  The maki was pretty decent, large rolls full of fresh ingredients, with the occasional surprising touch, however nothing innovative here. The nigiri was solid, my cuts of maguro and toro were very nice, and I did enjoy the hamachi off my sister's plate. The martinis were pretty average, and they seemed a bit of a scam because they load them up with absolutely huge lychee. Make sure to ask for them on the side!

2008-07-16,3.0,"Tsunami has been a Chicago sushi staple for some time now. With a sweet central location you are close to a lot of the Old Town/Gold Coast action which is nice if that's your thing. The only problem sometimes with being a trusty, dusty stand-by (read: Kamehachi, Tsunami, Sai Cafe) is that you can in turn at times project a trusty, rusty feel in your establishment. I get a bit of that nineties vibe when visiting Tsunami: close your eyes and you can totally picture Rachel, Ross, Phoebe and Co. downing their sake and gabbing about contraception over a dragon roll here. Well you know, if they were real people and all.  The upstairs lounge does a better job on ambiance and seems to get quite a crowd on weekend nights. Not shabby at all for a date night actually and the drinks, including specialty martinis are better than most you'll find in a sushi joint.   Tsunamis menu is surprisingly robust with the oysters with lemon and ponzu as an amazing starter. Follow that up with some flaming dynamite (some of the best I've had) and the Kani Su (expensive but worth it) and you've got some great starters to prime you for any of the main events. Boasting entrees you don't normally find like Australian rack of lamb and Broiled Scottish Salmon there is something for everyone in addition to the long list of specialty maki they've focused on pumping up in recent years. The sushi lover will find everything from simple spicy tuna and rainbow rolls to their sumo maki that comes with just about everything except the kitchen sink. Dessert won't hit a dull note either with their Tempura Banana, an absolute must try if you manage to save room after all that nigiri.  Consistency has is merits, and this is by no means a lukewarm 3-star review. I hit up Tsunami a few times a year but always choose to mix it up with the trendier, newer set of emerging sushi spots. Competition has it's price and there are just too many spots I love in Chicago to put Tsunami in the same league.",0.9915,0.838,0.142,0.019,0.4650153609831029
2008-07-15,3.0,"I've been here when you could count the number of diners on your hands, when it was so packed I walked in with some friends dressed to the nines and got shuffled into a corner, and I've sat in pretty much every nook and cranny of each room. The outside makes me think of a Malibu sushi restaurant I miss dearly. And while the inside does not, the décor is very much upscale trendy, and I enjoy it. A few tips: -Try to hit it up on a less crowded night - they'll be more attentive but they'll also serve complementary amuses to you if you're dressed nicely and it's quiet. - Parking can be a pain in the ass because it's 2 blocks away from the Division/Clark / ""Viagra triangle"". I usually park west on Division past LaSalle and then allow myself 10 minutes to walk...or at least 15 minutes to search for street parking. Or take the El to Division/Clark. Drinks: If you're like any of my girlfriends and enjoy fruity fancy drinks, the raspberry mojito is always a hit. As the adventurous unofficial bartender of groups, I've tried the rest. The mai tai kicked my ass and took most of one dinner to knock back, and even their lychee martini was pretty stiff. If you can handle your liquor, order away, but this is one of the few places downtown where you really get your liquor's worth in a $10+ martini...or at least, it tastes like it. Hamachi kama (yellowtail collar) is one of the ways I like to test a sushi restaurant, and the fact that Tsunami serves it as a regular appetizer only serves to show its authenticity. I grew up on Japanese cuisine and the kama here is top notch. The serving size is quite generous (Kama was the special at Kamehachi a few weeks back and Tsunami's appetizer made it look like a few pieces of sashimi). The only way to improve it would be to add some daikon to it. With regards to the actual sushi, the volcano roll is a spicy hit with a bunch of my coworkers and friends. Their specialty rolls are a bit smaller in size than I'd like, so I usually try them once for kicks and never again. And as I always tell my friends - why on earth would you pay M.P. (market price) for fresh fish in Chicago? Toro here is as good as it gets in the Midwest, but it's still not worth it i.m.o. Finally, dessert: their taiko is the bomb. Words don't do it justice.

Tsunami, in my opinion, takes the proverbial rice cake. The fish is some of the freshest I've had in Chicago, and most places I've visited around the country (the best still holds my heart in San Francisco). The staff is attentive, polite and always good for a fun recommendation if you're willing to try the daring. I was raised by the school of thought that you should sit at the bar, discuss the fish with the chefs and enjoy the whole experience before you even take the first bite. Sushi is an art and watching the preparation is most certainly part of the art form. But for some reason, I'm always drawn upstairs. It's so much fun! My favorite seat is by the fireplace, it's cozy and is fantastic for a little people watching (my favorite pastime, next to baseball). The mural along the opposite wall is beautiful, the owners, to my knowledge flew in an artist from Japan to paint it. I'm always drawn to it.

They even gave me furikake and red pepper to put on my rice. It was delish!!! Salmon was nice and crisp, I got to order it w/ BROWN rice, and I got 6 pieces of the California Roll that came with it. They even made it tempura style for me, with my request, of course.  Would I come here again??? Maybe... if I get a FAT raise! Good lord, my bento box alone was $24, not including tax and tip!!! I can get a bento box in San Jose for $6.50! Maybe not as good, but still, wayyyy cheaper!

Overall, this is a pricey but elegant place with wonderful sushi.  I am surprised to see negative reviews that highlight sushi quality --  Tsunami consistently serves what I consider high-quality, beautifully-prepared sushi.  I have never had a bad experience there, and it's consistently better than Ra Sushi, another great place I frequent when I want good sushi in a more casual, lower-priced setting.  Tsunami offers innovative rolls -- try the Q-Maki, a delicious rice-less maki with spicy crab and cucumber, or the spicy tuna roll, gratefully flavored with natural spices and not mayonnaise.  You can order any maki with brown rice, too, which works well on rolls like the Alaskan Maki with fresh salmon and avocado.  The seared escalar is absolutely wonderful and not easy to find in Chicago.  Tsunami's sake flights are a great way to enjoy sake throughout the meal.   I always sit at the bar where I enjoy the atmosphere and can watch my sushi being prepared.  Perhaps my only gripe about Tsunami is the bar itself: I'd like to see them update the coppery, Formica-ish finish with something that doesn't take me back to 1977.  Servers can be rushed at times, but they are uniformly quite knowledgeable about sushi and the menu, and the guys behind the sushi bar are fantastic.   I have probably had better sushi in Chicago, but not so much better to justify the eye-popping bill and offensive service I received twice at Mirai, or the less cozy, high-gloss environment of Blue Water Grill, which I also frequent.  As with most sushi bars, Tsunami is best, I've found, on weekends despite the crowds because you know the fish is fresh for the weekend rush.",0.9985,0.674,0.293,0.033,0.5563063063063064

I would always order the tekka don (fresh tuna over seasoned rice with assorted japanese vegetables) and he would get the chicken ton katsu (fried chicken tenderloin).   Ok this is what I found weird about this place.  EVERY TIME he ordered that dish, he would ask if he could have chicken instead of pork.  The waiter always initially said no but then a minute later would say ""well... let me check with the chef and see what he can do.""  And then 10 minutes later would come back and say that it could be done.  Honestly, this happened at least 15 times!   I mean it got to the point where it was plain annoying.

2006-01-29,2.0,"I am a sushi connoisseur and honestly this place is completely overrated and overpriced.  Although it is pretty inside, Tsunami fails to offer a fair price-value equation and I won't be going back anytime soon with so many other sushi spots in Chicago.",0.6908,0.756,0.184,0.06,0.546875
2005-10-31,3.0,"I mostly went here long before it developed its attitude and popularity. It was an above average sushi place. However, several years later, there's a lot more competition -- I could eat sushi twice a week for a year before I felt like I exhausted all the possibilities and even consider coming back here.",0.4767,0.845,0.107,0.048,0.29000000000000004
2005-08-11,1.0,"Hard to judge the quality of the sushi because your body is a rotting corpse by the time it arrives. Yes, there are beautiful people, and yes, it's a stylish place but if you actually came here to eat sushi you are better off going to Jewel down the street. I liked my saketini, but it wasn't enough to stave off my hunger until the one waiter working the entire patio finally moseyed over to take our order. I'm not sure what the problem is with the service -- why it is so slow, so terribly remiss. It just never seemed to dawn on any of the staff that the tables were restless and hungry. Especially with sushi, you need attentive service because more often than not you will order more rolls, pieces, sashimi, drinks. My party didn't even dare ask for more rolls, lest we were trapped waiting for an hour more. The maki -- the dragon roll, the amai roll, the crazy roll -- are nothing to go there for -- not to mention, really overpay for. Hardly anything fresh -- certainly no specials.",-0.7893,0.738,0.118,0.144,0.6103015873015872
