2013-02-06,4.0,"Wine bars are usually associated with a degree of expensive snobbery. And at other places in the city, that relation holds true. But when you plunk your wine bar down on Milwaukee Ave., strange things can happen. You might have a good time sipping libations without a single fur coat in sight. You might feel emboldened to ask the bartender (opposed to the sommelier) about what your drinking. You might experience much that you weren't expecting.

2012-04-28,4.0,"Went here last night before a show at Double Door. The service was good and the food was great. Three of us shared the meat platter with the three cheeses. So yummy, but I wish the meat was a bit more plentiful and/or thickly sliced. Paper thin was disappointing. The cheese was awesome (a gouda, a buttery batara and a mozzarella). We then split the tempura green beans and those were fantastic. For our shared entrees we split the mac n cheese, the burger, and coq au vin. It was way too much food for us, so when the chicken got there I only had one bite. Of the three, I liked the chicken the least. I think it needed salt at the very least. The mac n cheese was so creamy and yummy and the burger melted in my mouth. The fries on the side of the burger were also delicious. I would recommend going with a hearty appetite in order to try a whole bunch of items!  As for the wines, I had the bordeaux flight and was very happy with it. I love that they have the wines on their own little placemat telling you which is which. I also had the Hemingway cocktail for an after dinner drink. It was amazing and a perfect end to the dinner. My one complaint has nothing to do with Bin. It has everything to do with the clients. I know everyone deserves to have a nice night out, but please, at 8:30 p.m. leave the crying babies at home.

I think this place, like Francesca's Forno, is another underrated gem of the neighborhood.  It never seems overly packed, but the food and service are both great.   We started with the calamari and and the ""Around the World"" cheese plate.  I'm not a huge calamari girl so I don't have a particular opinion on that, but the ol' ball and chain said it was the best he had ever had.  The cheese plate was most excellent.  It included Casatica, Julianna, Keens and L'amuse.   For the entrees (which are way out of date on the website btw) I split the trout and the chicken.  The chicken was super tender, and didn't need a knife.  I guess I forgot that trout was pretty fishy, but it was cooked amazingly!  Crispy skin, tender meat.   We were helped by the amazingly sweet and attentive Jonathan and as I was waiting for the ladies room I spoke with one of the chef's behind the counter who was very friendly as well, even though he was in the middle of breaking down the kitchen.  Friendly service makes a world of difference! As an aside, they sell wine by the bottle even if you're not dining there.  They're really nice about helping you choose something (even if you're wine-tarded like me) and the price point is very reasonable.",0.9961,0.758,0.232,0.009,0.688994708994709

2012-03-11,1.0,"Let me preface this review with this: I am normally a very forgiving person when it comes to service. My mother is a server so I know the job is difficult. I am not like some other Yelp reviewers that complain when servers don't become your best friends or act like you are the best thing that happened to them that day. All I ask is that people be courteous and get my correct order in a timely fashion. So given that... I had one of the worst dining experiences here recently. I was shocked because I had been here before a couple years ago and it was so good. They must have changed something in the management or staffing because it was like night and day. I came with a group of girls, two of them are vegan. Ok, I know what you're thinking--vegans--ugh! They are so difficult right? Well, the person who suggested we come here was one of the vegans because she recommended their pizzas (they had customized hers in the past). She is actually a really cool vegan that realizes her diet is extreme, but tries to make it as easy as possible for others to accomodate her. So she asks the server if she can get a red pizza with no cheese, but just add some sort of vegetable on it (she didn't care which kind). The server seemed confused and said it might cost more money. She was like sure, whatever works! The server returns and goes back to the kitchen a few times to figure out how this was going to work and finally he says to us that the chef had yelled at him for asking about it and he refuses to add anything to the pizza. He would only remove the cheese. We were all mystified why they couldn't just take some of their salad ingredients and put it on the pizza. So my friend agrees and decides she would just make her own pizza using some of her salad if the chef wouldn't do it for her. Another guy comes and pours our bottle of wine and spills a few drops on my other friend's lap. When we order our other food, they said they ran out of ALL salumi. The server returns after ordering and said that they were out of spinach salad...but we didn't order a spinach salad. They forgot to bring our order of olives. We tried the risotto dish and it was really weirdly textured with a random side of creamed butternut squash. After finishing our first dishes, we waited for our pizzas. And waited...and waited... My friend looks at the kitchen and sees the chef give an ""f - u"" under the chin hand gesture to someone.  After an hour since we ordered the pizzas, we decide to ask the server how long it would be. He comes over and asks whether we need anything else. We're like uh...where's our pizzas? He goes to the kitchen and returns saying that the order was not put in. We weren't really sure how that was possible considering he had had that whole conversation before about the vegan pizza. We decided to leave and get the rest of our dinner elsewhere before they could spit in our food (even though we were being very nice the whole time and my friend even was telling the server before that she understood the chef's reasoning for not accommodating her). They did the courtesy of taking 10% off our bill, but it is difficult to imagine returning here.",0.9611,0.85,0.085,0.064,0.617979969765684

Big chunks of fresh, well-prepared vegetables and perfectly cooked eggs. Yesterday I went and it was a mess. They were out of stuff at 10:30 a.m. The vegetables in the hash were a finely diced mush and the eggs undercooked. Our whole table waited 15 minutes *after* we got our entrees for toast, for WHICH THEY CHARGE EXTRA in spite of the fact that the server asks ""What kind of toast would you like?"" when you order. Then we had to send the bill back twice because we were charged incorrectly. To top off this dream meal, my friend gouged herself on some stray staples sticking out of our booth and bled all over the place as she tried to calculate why the bill was twelve bucks more than it should have been.

Toast came at the end of the meal and was completely forgotten - when it came they brought absolutely burnt toast and the runner had no remorse. The server who also took a long time to get things going throughout the meal immediately recognized that it was burnt, when she finally got back to us and took it away.  Seeing that one of the entrees came with toast and an extra was ordered I thought it was a bit crazy at how inept they were in the whole process, toast takes maybe 2 mins to make and if it doesnt make sense that it would take 10 mins to bring it after it was requested again and then brought totally black.  It seemed pretty disrespectful to a certain point.  Hot sauce was requested and took over 15 mins to receive, when asked again it took another 5 minutes which was finally taken from another table.  I am REALLY disappointed by the lack of service especially with the number of staff in house. From someone who knows the industry very well, I would suggest less staff and better training. Only redemption factor, is that the server had some wherewithal to take $5 off the bill for the mishap, but I will not be returning.",-0.0292,0.905,0.047,0.048,0.6305194805194806

Positive: the food was pretty good! We ordered pizza with housemade sausage and peppers, beef sliders with bacon, the fries, and hot goat cheese. The goat cheese was spicy and the pesto on the bread was interesting. The burgers were good, with the right amount of sauce and toasty bread. The fries were delicious dipped in the garlicky sauce. We also ordered the bubbles flight as well as the sexy reds. There were many interesting wines and champagnes included. The paper was nice as a guide, giving us a description of the wine. The flights were only $10 on Wednesday's. Bad: this might be a good place to meet friends, but not a good place for an anniversary. I think there was one server for the whole place and it was pretty packed. The water guy told me not to put my purse by the heater, but he didn't say hello. People we giving him their checks and placing orders with him. We ended up ordering a flight with him because our waiter was far too busy to return to our table. We would have ordered more wine if he had come back more often. Luckily I ordered all my food all at once, because I don't think I would have gotten any more if I had to rely on service. The waiter said they ran out of wine glasses!! At a wine bar. On a Wednesday. The front of the house was freezing. I asked three times to have the heater next to me turned on. As I was paying the check, I told the manager, and she said she thought I meant the other heater, which is broken. The phone is broken too, so you cant talk to a real person. I ate the whole meal my coat. I could feel the cold air wafting in from the windows. I was disappointed I dressed up. My bill did not include the discount that had been promised to us. I had to get up and stand at the reservation desk to get the manger to take a look at it and fix it. It was so loud, as fellow Yelpers said, that we had to sit right next to each other to be heard. I just wasn't expecting all this on a Wednesday.  Overall, this place had good bites and wine but the atmosphere and service ruined an important date. I think the place is far more casual than the website portrays. I might go back with a friend, but I would never take anyone from out of town or anything. I wouldn't go if you are hungry for a meal either, as the food is good, but so slow. Also, don't go if you want attentive service.

I was excited to be back in Bucktown and couldn't wait to hang out at bin again!  I went back for the first time since last year and couldn't  believe how much the place had gone downhill. Apparently they have a new manager (who greeted us wearing cut off short short jean shorts).  I asked about the previous manager and was informed he left along with the previous chef and entire staff.  That should have been my first red flag... We were seated very quickly but sat without drinks or a waiter for about 30 minutes. While we were waiting for our server we noticed the manager sitting at the bar drinking with friends. We still hadn't seen our waitress. Quite some time later we talked to our server and asked about some of the wines.  I ordered the bubbles flight and received a smirk and roll of the eyes from our waitress.  Drinks came out and we ordered our food.  15 minutes later the wrong pizza came to the table along with a cheese platter another table had ordered.  We mentioned that the pizza was wrong and the cheese wasn't ours and the waitress responded by saying ""ugh"" grabbing our food and walking away.  Meanwhile the manager and her hipster buddies  were guzzling wine and looked to be having a blast... at one point the manager's buddy took off her shoes and wiped her feet with a napkin, which apparently the manager thought was hilarious. Our pizza arrived once again and it was horribly greasy and soggy.  We ate, paid then went to Big Star for better service.  Despite our annoying dinner, we decided to give BWC a shot for brunch.  Last week we made reservations for 10:00 on Sunday and arrived at 9:50.  We had to wait 15 minutes for our table then ordered.  My mother asked for the pancakes and was informed they would take atlas 20 minutes.  Really?  20 minutes for pancakes?  Our food came out and my omelet was cold.  My father ordered the spring hash and received biscuits and gravy.   Our toast never came out and we had to ask three times for a ""bottomless"" mimosa refill.     All in all,  BWC used to be a wonderful neighborhood gem with friendly staff who treated everyone as though they were family. The food was outstanding and the atmosphere was inviting.  New management = bad attitude, crap service and a vibe that is less than inviting.  Things have certainly changed since I've been gone!",0.9538,0.848,0.094,0.058,0.4259035538105306

My first trip back home to Chicago in 6 years for my sister's birthday we go to this place and we got treated like SHIT plain and simple. The day of my arrival I walked past this place, and saw how packed it was, and considering that I have been to my fair share of wine bars in NYC I really wanted to experience one in my hometown, so I made the decision to take my sisters for my older sister's birthday the following night. Upon arriving the next night, we met a nice host, who explained to us that the menu was tappas style, we looked over the food portion of the menu, and my sister loved it so we decided to stay. While looking over the menu our server arrive ""Joceline"" aka the red-haired girl with the stank attitude or something like that. My sister being the one who isn't really a wine enthusiast simply asked a question about what the fruitier wine was and immediately the server got irritated by us.  She went ahead and explained the wine flights to us, resisting the urge to throw in as well: ""If you are on a budget here are some less expensive wines that I am sure  you can afford if you don't want to spend too much."" Then she walks away... We all just looked at each other and shrugged it off. She comes back and we simply ask about portion sizes to determine whether or not we will need to order more. She tells us don't worry about portion size, she's sure it'll be enough for us. *yes my sisters and I are thin, but not so thin that we would only enjoy one slice of cheese and a piece of apple to make us less hungry than we were* We finally get to the order placing part and as I am ordering my other 2 sisters are confirming the food order. After ordering our wine, we tell her that we were ready to order food, and she tells us in not so many nice words that she wasn't ready to take our food order and walks away from the table... o.O She comes back with our wine, then takes our order, after taking our order we ask her, does she think that it'll be enough. She looks at us smirks and sarcastically says , ""For you 3 I'm SUUURE it'll be enough"". 5 minutes later she speeds pass to slightly stop and ask  ""How's the wine"" My sister barely got out the words ""fine thank y..."" before you verbally cut her off with an ""mmhmm great"" and breezed off again. we got our cheese flight, and watched this girl walk to her other 3 tables and check on them and give them polite conversation but totally ignore our eye contact and body language suggesting we might want her attention, to order another cheese flight that she said would be enough.... The restaurant manager/ server in me couldn't stand it anymore and decided to go ask the host if they had any comment cards. He told me they were all out, but cared enough to come and check on the table himself, and continued to ask if there was anything he could fix for us. After 15 minutes of completely being ignored by our server and listening to her talk shit about us to other staff members. I got up and went to the manager and voiced my concerns as our server stood behind her defensively. When I went on to tell the manager about how we clearly heard her talking about us referring to me as ""that bald chick"" she pretty much caused a scene as to where the manager had to shoo her away. Manager offered to comp our whole meal, I refused, because I didn't come for my meal to be comped I came for my sister to enjoy her day, and paid for the cheese we ate and the wine we drank. This was THE worst experience ever. I was embarrassed for taking my sister to someplace that I spoke so highly about based on the reviews I read and the crowd I witnessed the night before.

When you get a flight, they give you a sort of wine-placemat, with the description of each wine written on it.  There's a space for the glass to sit above its description; I think this is so helpful, because then we knew what to taste for, and if we loved one of the glasses we knew which one it was!  I've had wine flights at other places without the description-placemats, and I completely forgot which one was which.  This is way better. All the wines were lovely, though I really enjoyed the bin 14 (a pinot gris) and bin 16 (a Gewurtzraminer).  We ordered some baked goat cheese as well, which was served in a ramekin with some sort of marinara sauce, and bread slathered with arugula pesto.  It was very good, creamy cheese, and made for a perfect appetizer. I think it's a pretty good deal, to get a wine flight for $15 (it's essentially two glasses worth of wine), and you get to try so many lovely kinds.  I've never been for dinner, but I'd definitely recommend it for the lovely wine choices and the wide selection of cheese and charcuterie!",0.9901,0.829,0.171,0.0,0.5210416666666667

The house made chicken sausage had no flavor. I took it off.  But the potato and onion side. WOW that was good.  My boyfriend got the breakfast pizza. A regular sauce-less cheese pizza with a little salad and 1 poached egg on top. The menu says bacon but when you ask ""where's the bacon"" she says its a bacon vinaigrette.

Perhaps one would greet their table quicker if this was the case? Nah. Anyways, we decided on the Bin 36 flight, tempura green beans, beet salad, calamari and the white pizza. The only thing that I would consider good was the green beans, which were lightly breaded and fresh. In all honesty, the rest of the food sucked. The beet salad had wilted, bitter spinach leaves which made it nearly inedible. The calamari dish was the strangest combination of squid, crab, ricotta cheese and wait for it.... chorizo. Way too much going on and not good.  Finally, the white pizza. Mediocre with an abundance of garlic. Like so much garlic, I woke up with the taste in mouth the next day even having brushed my teeth about 10 times. Anyways, to put the nail in the coffin, the staff began closing down the restaurant in the middle of our meal; well before the noted close time. Maybe I'm a brat, but I think this is so rude.

Sadly, they were out of the lamb that my dining partner in crime had been lusting after, so he grabbed a burger, too.  Mine: sauteed mushrooms (they were a variety of wild mushrooms - not a button in sight), no cheese.  His: cheddar (from the impressive cheese menu) and bacon.  They were cooked PERFECTLY, and felt every ounce of their 1/2 pound-ness.  The fries were perfect, too, and we both left comfortably full.  Of course, we tried the daily spread bruschetti, as well.  3 kinds were served: crab & cream cheese, house-made red pepper hummus, and a late-summer veggie medley with shaved parm.   Terrific wine flights were available, and the selections had all been carefully chosen, arranged, and paired on the menu.  Thoughtful and creative, for sure.   Service was good, too... and while our server was a little quirky, he had a great handle on some of the more unusual ingredients.  His explanation of the lesser-known items on the Wed/Thurs farm-to-table 3-course prix-fixe was spot on and almost just as I'd have given them back in my long-lost serving days.  Kohlrabi (similar to the meaty, bitter broccoli stems), harissa (a smokey north-African sauce with cumin and coriander) and a quick list of the specials and 86s.  He was a little skittish, and distracted, but he was on his game for the most part, so we were happy.  The back-server seemed to be horrified at the thought of us even nearing the bottom of our water glasses, so we remained well-hydrated all night.

I knew a toast & new restaurant experience was in order. So, I happened upon Bin Wine Cafe via some solid Reader reviews. that particularly highlighted a nice sidewalk patio. (Perfect for a Chicago Sunday)! SPACE: When we got there, the patio was small...and packed...but we were able to grab a cozy table inside. And with the ""garage-door-wall"" raised, we had a fabulous view for plenty of WP eclectic people watching - and the bonus of several unobstructed tattoo viewings.   (Always impressive eye candy for a chica who lives in LP; and more impressive, was that within the intimate space, we were able to speak comfortably while sitting very near other tables. I.G., No obnoxious yellers).  STAFF: sweet, honest, & super generous with ""bonus"" food tips.   FOOD: We had the Smoked Trout Salad and a Peach-Sausage-Caramelized Onion deal, which was a special....and amazing!  (Think: Crisp fuzzy peach slices...contrasting sweetness on the savory sausage...some croutons for texture...& red onion-happiness). Both dishes had uniquely bold flavors and simple-sized portions. (I love being able to eat everything on my plate - and not feel guilty). We even had room for dessert - Creme Brulee. The insider tip, given from our waiter: eat the whole lemon wedge! (Beyond lemon drop-tastic). WINE: last but not least...THE TOAST! There was a 1/2-off bottle special so we grabbed a Red NV: The Surveyor from Washington.  It was a good wine...and a really great price! (Plus I learned a 'lil about Non Vintage Wine: it's a blend of years...and can produce consistency).

I had the breakfast pizza because it sounded interesting and like something I wouldn't normally order. It was cheesetastic as all pizza should be and even had a poached egg on top. Loved it. It wasn't as crisp as I would have liked, but it was still very good. Their hash browns are super crispy and served with sweet onions. The presentation almost looked like a piece of hash brown pie.

Not for everyone, but definitely for the adventurous, expand your horizons with these leathery, sophisticated, dark fruits. Feeling a bit more lighthearted? The four-flavor mimosa tasting is an absolute delight as are the Bin cheese offerings!

We had a good time, due to the wine and company, but the service was pretty ridiculous. I arrived later than everyone else so they already had drinks. I must have waited a solid 5 minutes for our server to come to our table. Fine, I'll get over it.  We then ordered a bottle of red, which took him an abnormal amount of time to get to us- and the bar was right behind out table, and while opening it- he spilled. Red wine. All over the table and on me. I reacted in a way of just trying not to get it on my clothes, but whatever it happens. He said nothing. Not sorry, not oops, not my bad. Nothing. So as I am cleaning everything up and he is pouring glasses he notices and goes, Oh I'm sorry did I do that?! It happens I get it, but this guy had his head up his a$$. His customer service was not good at all. Maybe he didn't stand a chance because every girl I was with is either a waitress right now or was at some point. No one expected stellar service, but then again why shouldn't we? If it wasn't for the amazing host, who basically ran our table, we probably would have created a stir with management. I just hope our server split the tip with the host because he did everything, except spill red wine on me.

Some thoughts: Showed up unannounced with a group of 7ish around 7 on a Saturday night with no reservations. After some hemming and hawing and waiting at the bar, they graciously sat us.  Menu is surprisingly small and clustered in two price categories. On the low end, there are hamburgers (11) and pizza (11 or 12). On the high end, there were entrees for 20ish. I wasn't feeling either and so I got olives (5), a beet salad (8), and the tempura green beans. The serving of olives was extremely generous and the beet salad was delicious. The tempura green beans were snooze. Tasted my fiance's burger - it was wonderful. (Note to self: go back to bin on a tuesday for 5 dollar hamburgers).  Atmosphere was warm and jovial.

2010-01-03,4.0,"On a cold and blustery night it's hard not enjoy good wine and hearty food that sticks to your bones. Though we did not exactly plan on stopping into Bin Wine Cafe that evening, we were happy to find 3 seats at the bar and a respite from the elements. Not looking for a full meal, our goals were simple: taste some wine and snack on tasty food. Each of us ordered a wine flight in order to sample the variety of choices Bin serves. I went with the house label, the BIN flight. My companions went with a red flight and an ""express yourself"" white flight. Each flight was around $13.50 for 4 glasses (2.5oz pours, plenty to get a feel). I particulary enjoyed the cabernet sauvignon, so much that I ordered a full glass and convinced my friend to do the same. As for the food, the three of us ordered the soup of the day (tomato sourdough), side of mac and cheese, side of french fries with garlic aioli and a pizza with mushrooms and garlic. The soup was fantastic and served pipping hot. I did the most damage on the mac and cheese, made with small pieces of ham and reminded me of the childhood classic mac 'n cheese with hot dog bites. Finally, the pizza was the perfect feel good dish with cheese and garlic galore. Nothing says comfort food like pizza, wine, soup and mac and cheese. The fries were a late addition and probably unnecessary, but I enjoyed trying the garlic aioli and well seasoned fries served in a pint glass. All in all an unexpected delight to have stumbled into Bin Wine Cafe. I shouldn't be surprised as the Bin family is known for high quality, but always nice to experience it firsthand. The bill was a little surprising at first when it arrived, $105 for 3 people with no bottle of wine and no entre. But like most good meals, the drinks are half the bill ($13 flight + $8 glass), so the food was well priced for the quality and taste. I would recommend Bin, especially for those in the neighborhood looking for a great wine spot and no fuss.",0.9802,0.816,0.124,0.06,0.5720119047619047

We got a flight of reds and were in a very silly mood. As normal with flights, the wines get fuller as you progress. We started naming the wines after movie stars. I can't remember all of them, but one was John Malcovich, nothing special but always a solid performance. Next was Marisa Tomei, stellar but unappreciated. The last one was the Meryl Streep of wines; it had everything you want in a great red It was the one with the Windmill on it, but I can't remember the type.  We had the flight with their artisan sampler of cheeses and meats. The best part was, we could buy the wine we liked and take it home and drink more of it.  I also had my birthday brunch here. Love mimosa and bloody flights. The Mexican Bloody was not my cup of tea (tequila in it), but I loved the Italian Bloody. It is like a liquid caprese salad. We did have to wait 45 minutes for a table, but it was a busy Sunday. I had no problem waiting, because I just kept having drinks at the bar, but there were others in my party (nondrinkers) that got antsy.",0.9703,0.721,0.182,0.097,0.5067287784679089

Our dinners, a duck and a cod dish, were also delicious and perfectly cooked.

No salt, no pepper - nada - although we asked for a bottle of hot sauce and were promptly supplied with one.

There was a $19 wine flight which came with four types of wine and four types of cheese of your choice (I had the waitress pick some out, who was knowledgeable). And then...I ended up winning six games of B.I.N.G.O. The loot included four bottles of wine, a wine opener, and a free glass of wine on my next visit! Everyone at my table won something as well, so in all, we ended up with 8 bottles of wine and various little prizes. The announcer was really into his role and made up lots of variations of the game to play. At one point we were doing a picture frame game and I forgot to fill in all the sides with my hits but then I looked on some people's cards really fast and realized I had B.I.N.G.O.

2009-03-26,2.0,"Totally uninspired and pedestrian.  I went here for a friend's birthday, so it wasn't by choice, but I was looking forward to trying a sampling of what Bin Cafe had. To start, we ordered the ""must have"" cheese flight, and the spanish flight. I did really like that they included a slip of paper telling what your cheeses were, and some of them were very delicious (I mean, it's hard to go wrong with cheese). I was disappointed to see buffalo mozzarella, not because I don't like it, but does it really fall under the title (theirs) ""Cheeses you can't live with out""? I feel it's a cheese that needs to be highlighted in something like a caprese, not alone on a cheese plate. I split a few dishes since I like to try a lot and not be tied down to one main entree. We had the raviolo that was stuffed with leeks, cheese, and covered with a cream sauce. It was nice, but just a little boring. Then we ordered the pork belly. It had a really great broth, but unfortunately it seemed to be sitting in the broth for a while before it was brought to our table, so it was not crispy at all, so the generous amount of fat was not as delicious as it could have been (and that was a big part of this pork belly). I really felt that this meat had a lot of potential, and it fell pretty flat.  Our final dish was the pork shoulder with chickpeas, spinach, made in a traditional spanish way (if I'm remembering right). The chick peas felt a little raw in the center, but I'm not used to eating them outside of hummus, so maybe they were supposed to be like that. They didn't have any of the flavor of the meat or broth, like a good cassoulet bean would have, so I don't think they spent much time cooking together. Like the other dishes, I really wanted some more from this one, maybe more layers of flavor and taste combos, but I didn't find that. I think this place has a nice location and vibe, and the staff were all very friendly, if a bit slow and absent for a Saturday night. I'd say if you are in the area and in a pinch, Bin Cafe would be great for some cheese and wine. The food was ok, but a city like Chicago has so much better to offer, especially at this price level.

We were sat immediately and began drinking coffee while we waited for the rest of our party. As soon as I scanned the menu, I was nervous. My pant's size doesn't let on but, I am pretty picky about the food I eat. I generally dislike foods that I haven't been eating for my entire life. My family says I have 'white trash taste buds'; I just really like canned raviolis.  For this meal, I reached beyond my comfort zone and got a breakfast pizza.  When the server brought it to us, my heart skipped a beat. Was that a poached egg... on... my... pizza? Blech. Instead of crying or refusing to eat it, I just went for it. I stirred the egg around on the hot pizza and swirled the salad around a it. The hot pizza ended up cooking my egg to the point where I felt I could mentally get over the ""baby chicken"" part. Then, I went in for the kill; I took a bite. What happened in my mouth was magical. The pungent cheese mixed with the crisp crust and the salty ham (bacon?) was the perfect flavor burst. I had no idea that food could be this... um... exciting and interesting. It was simply divine.  I thank Bin Wine Cafe for creating this delicious breakfast and for waking up my taste buds.

This evening, I tried out one of their wine flights, the Sexy Reds, and enjoyed three out of four of the glasses. I think my favorite (also one of Bin's favorites) was the Syrah. It was very smooth and mild. I skipped the appetizers this time around, and went straight for the hanger steak on this cold winter's evening. The steak was cooked medium rare, and I wouldn't want it any other way. There was a generous slab of gorgonzola butter served along with the steak, and I ended up consuming just about all of it along with the meat. Normally, I like my steaks naked (no A-1 Sauce for me, thank you very much), but I felt like this one needed a little bit more. I don't really have any complaints about it though. It also came with fries, and the highlight of those was the garlic aioli - who doesn't enjoy that stuff? My friend and I shared the chocolate ganache mousse, which was served with a dollop of oreo mint ice cream in the middle. The dessert was just okay, not a rich, indulgent chocolate flavor that you would expect from ganache. The ice cream was a nice flavor break, and for the first time, I experienced a mint ice cream that was made with real mint, instead of that weird green stuff that is sometimes over-sweet. Very refreshing. I would definitely go back again, and still want to sit at the back counter overlooking the kitchen and just enjoy some wine, cheese, and dessert.",0.9459,0.802,0.132,0.066,0.5380729166666667

2008-11-09,4.0,"Although my friends and I were saddened to learn that Rodan no longer serves brunch (with the Vietnamese donuts and coffee!), we were very pleased with our alternative, Bin Wine Cafe. The lack of waiting for a table was truly delightful and definitely a novelty; I mean, we're in Chicago, why aren't we waiting for at least an hour?  What immediately attracted me to the menu was the choice of bloody maries (marys?). Some day, I will totally spoil myself and order the Bloody Mary Flight, but alas, today was not the day to do that. So I had to choose. With 4 different flavors, the decision was tough, but I was thrilled with my Asian Mary, subtly flavored with wasabi and pickled ginger.  Finally deciding upon what to actually eat was tough as well. While the menu is on the small side, there are quite a few contenders. I'm sure the pulled pork and scrambled egg burrito is heavenly. And the eggs baked in crock with wild mushrooms and spinach and lots of cheese sounds scrumptious as well. I went with the brunch pizza, which is the closest I've come to an Alasacienne tarte flambee in this country. Now that I'm looking at my leftovers, I realize that my pizza ended up sans bacon. I was so thrilled with mixing the perfectly poached egg and spinach across my pizza that I didn't even realize I was missing the applewood smoked bacon. Since the born-again vegetarian at our table does not like mushrooms, and the only vegetarian dish (the baked eggs) requires that, she ordered a veggie egg burrito, and I have a feeling that veggie special order leaked over to my pizza. Darn. Oh well, it was still delightful.  The Lavazza coffee kept coming, which was fantastic, and there was no pressure to vacate our table, which was even better, since we were catching up with a friend who had flown in from L.A. No lines means brunch can be a guiltless 2 hour affair again!!!  I could definitely see myself coming here with the new love interest for an ""afternoon nosh"" and some wine.

This by far is worst meal for $100 I have paid for in a long time. We got there around 6:30pm and the host was quite nice and accomodating. We wanted to sit outside but there were only tables for 3 or more. He kindly moved a table and made it for two. About 2 minutes later our waitress came and she did as us if we wanted something to drink. We kindly told her we needed another minute. 5 minutes go by, 10 minutes go by, now a total of at least 15 minutes go by and no one has come back to check on us and take our order. Please note that there were only 5 tables with at least 5 waiter 2 bus boys and a host. We flag a different waiter down to place our drink order. Still our waitress has not come back to take our food order. The other waiter comes back with our drinks and we ask if we could please place an order for our starters. Please note that now it is at least 30 minutes since we have been there. To sum it up, we had bland squash soup, and the mussels were overcooked and underseasoned. For entrees I ordered the nights special pizza which was just awful. I mean really just awful. It was somekind of cheese with carmelized onions and applewood bacon, it sounded decent. It was over baked, all the bacon was in the center, and the onions were non existent because the pizza was so dry. I packed it feeling bad and thought maybe I could give it to someone on the way home, but the truth is they would probably of taken a bite and thrown it back at me.  My husband had the hanger steak and fries. He ordered the steak medium rare, and the steak came out bloody. The fries came out just about overdone and burnt. Even after 10 minutes of sitting out, sometimes fries get a little soggy or soften up, no way these fries were hard and dry. This place was a huge disappointment.

Opted out of doing the wine flights and got a bottle. Our server told us outright that he didn't know anything about the bottle selection, only the glass pours. Claimed it was because he was new. We ended up choosing something on our own, great blend called ""Lot 21"", I believe. We really enjoyed it (especially the price $40). For food we started with the mussels, had the steak & fries and the scallops for entrees and ended with a cheese plate. The food was all fantastic, no complaints there. Our server suggested the cheese plate, which was our favorite part of the meal. In the end, a great food experience, interesting service.

Not ones to wait hours for our feast, we stopped by Bin. I was suspicious at first. It looked clean and bright. It looked pretentious. It looked, well, expensive. But not waiting for my coffee and eggs trumped all of the above, so we headed in and were seated immediately. And that's when the gluttony got out of control: Mimosas all around, a cheese plate to start, and then eggs benedict. Yes, a cheese plate, and then eggs benedict. I think my heart almost stopped right there in the restaurant.  My benedict was absolutely excellent. The hollandaise was lemony and fresh and avoided all the potential problems that make ordering it a gamble. The prosciutto was crispy and delicious. The weird potato-and-onion cake slice served as hashbrowns was tasty, but all things considered, a bit greasy given the rest of my meal.  My only complaint is that the mimosas were pricey ($7) given their rather conservative size, but what can you expect? Bin is, after all, a wine bar. And wine bars don't serve cheap champagne, even in a mimosa.   When we left (to go next door for cheaper breakfast cocktails), I was pretty sure my ticker was about to stop.

I also liked my hangar steak, but I think that was mostly because I loved the fries that came with it, yum! Mike got the gnocchi, which he was disappointed in (but that could be because I made him homemade meyer lemon gnocchi a few days before), and two of our friends got pizzas, which they really liked.

We walked in to find many tables available, from the looks of it. Still, we were told the wait would be 30 minutes. We were cool with this as it's standard operating procedure at nearly every brunch spot in Wicker Park.  However, we watched as tables were vacated and we still weren't seated 45 minutes later. An inquiry with the host revealed a policy of ""not seating anyone who didn't have reservations"" due to the kitchen being ""slammed"". With a half full restaurant this was hard to fathom. We were finally seated after a 50 minute wait and treated to the same menu that has been in place since the joint opened and exceedingly slow service. The chicken sandwich was tired, the pizza was burnt. The mimosa and bloody mary flights are always on point, but they need to be to survive an experience like this.

At dinner, experiment with the wine flights.  The hangar steak entree comes with gorgonzola butter and a little bag of salty frites.  The cheese selection includes sheep's milk, goat's milk, and cow's milk, and you can build a flight or select from the chef's suggested flights- The Fat City flight should heal your hankerings for creamy cheeses.  I will be back on  Monday or Tuesday night for the $10 wine flights and more delicious cheese.

2008-01-03,5.0,"Despite what I thought were a lot of pretty lackluster reviews, I dropped in at Bin Wine Cafe tonight with a friend and was very impressed. Granted, I would have been happy to stumble into a warm stable with the current weather conditions out there, but Bin was a welcome upgrade from quality time with the horses. I got there around 6, and there wasn't a crowd at all (just how I like it). There was very pretty, kinda jazzy bossa nova playing over the sound system, and just enough buzzing conversation to make the room feel alive. Even though my friend and I were just drinking wine, we were seated at a real table (!) and got our wine menus, with cheeses on the back. All I needed, really. I settled on the ""Habla Espanol?"" flight of Spanish/Chilean reds, and Sam got the ""Bubbles"" flight of sparklings. I was especially pleased with the Tempranillo in that flight, but each 2.5-ounce pour, served in a very sleek stemless wine glass, was satisfying in its own way. Varying flavors but nice all the same. I had a six-year aged cheddar and some Stilton, and Sam got two cheeses as well, so our server (also Sam!) brought us a cutting board with our cheeses, some crostini and very thinly sliced apples with toasted almond slivers and a homemade wine jelly (fairly unimpressive). We ran out of apples fairly early on, and no one should have to eat a blue without accompaniments, so I asked Sam if I could sneak a few more apple slices, and he obliged with no problem. Very sweet and conversational with us, even when we got a little tipsy and stupid. (I am still slightly tipsy and stupid, by the way.) I've been pretty adamantly against Wicker Park (yes, all of it) on sheer principle of its vomitorious semi-hipster crowd, but I'm gradually warming to it as I learn of some of its charms. Bin Wine Cafe is definitely among those, and I'm looking forward to discovering more in the near future.",0.9924,0.772,0.177,0.051,0.6076016260162602

You choose from many different flights of wine--organized by type such as Spanish Wines, Syrahs, White wine or bubblies. When the wine is served, each glass is placed on a sheet of paper with circles on it. In each circle is the description of the wine you are drinking. Very engaging. It brings your experince full circle, and helps you not to forget what the heck it is you're drinking.  The use of stemless wine glasses is very pretty as well.  And then to boot, the food was great.

We don't know squat at wine, so the waitress recommended two different reds to go with our gouda & cheddar. The cheese & the wine exploded together. It was incredible to taste the details in each.  As for real substance, we had the asparagus salad & croque monsieur. Both were quite light tasty. Nothing too heavy on the taste buds. I actually fell for the garlic aoli.

2007-01-07,3.0,"This is a review of Bin's brunch. I checked it out just because I live in the neighborhood and have noticed there's never a line here. First impression: it's the smallest brunch menu I've ever seen. There were just a few items, and they were all breakfast which is fine by me but I know some people like to eat lunch food at brunch. The second thing you immediately notice is how LOUD it is. Screaming at my breakfast companion is not something I'm fond of. There are 4 brick walls with no apparent sound-proofing and an open kitchen. I don't know why they wouldn't do something to fix this, it really made me not want to come back. Onto the food: I had blueberry ricotta pancakes which were like eating birthday cake for breakfast (in the best possible way!), super rich and delicious. However they weren't any better than the many rich and delicious pancakes offered at toast or bongo room, and the kind I got and chocolate chip were the only pancake options. My boyfriend got some kind of egg/cheese thing. He also ordered a side of hash browns, which meant that he got this thing shaped like a slice of pie made of potatoes and onions. The potato pie thing was really tasty, but I feel like the server should warn you that you're about to receive something totally different instead of just nodding when you order hash-browns. He said his egg dish tasted fine but totally average, and it was served to him so insanely hot that he couldn't even start eating it until I was half-way through my meal. So overall, all the food we had here was good but not great enough to come back when there are so many other brunch options so close by.

We walked by and it looked packed (compare this to Thyme Cafe, down the street at the same time), but popped in anyway. Very very good stuff. Interesting space. They have a kitchen-bar area where you can eat and drink while you watch the line cooks work. I'm not sure why this is hygenic, but it's very cool. We drank more than we ate, but here's the list:     * cheese. The cheese list is phenomenal, with several ready-to-go ""flights"" or innumerable a la carte options. The cheese comes with handy cheat sheets so you don't forget what's what.     * escargot. Not the escargot of the bistrots and brasseries I know. This was in more of a gravy-like sauce and topped with puff pastry. I think I prefer the garlic-butter drenched snails of days gone by, but after quite a bit of drinking, these were a good snack.     * Torre Moron, Ribera del Duero 2003. A very very good Spanish red that we drank by the glass. Conveniently available for your purchasing pleasure to take home as you leave the cafe, as are all of their wines. Not cheap, but not ridiculously expensive either. The Torre Moron went goes for $17.95 if you want to buy the bottle and bring it home. It was $9/glass.  Did I mention that our server rocked? In general, I think Bin hires very knowledgeable people to help steer you through the many many options and keep you from drinking light fruity wines when your food wants big jammy ones.

2006-11-05,4.0,"I'm a big fan of Bin 36 so I knew I would love the sister restaurant, Bin Wine Cafe.  My friends and I had dinner at Coast (YUM) last night and wanted a wine bar nearby....Bin Wine Cafe was the closest I could think of so off we went. I absolutely loved the atmosphere- much more low key than Bin 36, but still beautiful.  My friend, who was visiting from St Louis, commented that Bin Wine Cafe (like every other place we had been to that day) was absolutely packed with women.  She asked where were the men in Chicago and I did have to remind her that we spent the day shopping, eat sushi, and then at a wine bar...we'll have to hit the sports bars on her next trip to Chitown.   We had a drink at the bar while we waited for the table. There is this one dessert wine at Bin 36 that I'm obsessed with even though I can never remember the name.  Fortunately the waiters at Bin 36 always help me out when I describe it. I expected the same helpful treatment at Bin Wine Cafe, but I guess not because the bartender basically handed me the dessert wine menu and told me to try to find it myself.   I guess a more laid back atmosphere also means less helpful in this particular case.  I did order a dessert wine and although it wasn't nearly as good as my favorite one at Bin 36 it was still pretty good. We were seated after about 10 minutes and even though we were very full from our yummy dinner at Coast we decided to order some dessert here.  Everything on the menu looked good so I asked the waitress what she recommended and she said the lemon cake without hesitation. The lemon cake arrived and we were all a bit disappointed at a first glance....it looked way too healthy (I'm a chocolate girl). However, after 1 bite I was very happy with the choice and can assure you that this delicious piece of cake was far from healthy. I plan on going back to try the rest of the menu soon- it looks like a great destination for a girls night out and those pizzas looked pretty good as well! I'm also going to have to try their brunch after reading Laura W's review.  Nothing beats breakfast pizza &  a bloody mary for breakfast! Edit 1/7/06: Finally got around to eating at Bin Wine Cafe last night.  The food was delicious! We had the cheese flight of the night and we ate it all- especially big fans of the goat cheese.  Then we split the butternut squash ravioli (very good, but not as good as this dish at Feast down the street) and the white pizza (so yummy).  All that and a bottle of wine made for the perfect meal. Unfortunately, the service wasn't as good as the food.  Our waitress was extremely inattentive and kind of rude.  They don't leave the bottle of wine at the table when you order it so she took it with her and there were many times where we were waiting around for our wine glasses to be refilled.  I asked her for some new silverware halfway through the meal after dropping mine (yes, I'm a klutz) and after waiting for 10 minutes I had to wave down another waitress to help.  I realize it was a busy time on Saturday night, but hopefully Bin Wine Cafe will work on their service so that it matches the quality of their food!",0.9969,0.782,0.157,0.061,0.576678391053391

2006-02-19,5.0,"On a Saturday night when you want to be able to chill and catch up with a friend or need a great place for a first date, go to Bin!  It is never too loud so you can always have a great conversation and the wait staff is super friendly and knowledgeable about the wine selection.  Last time I was there my date and I had a few glasses of wine and got a cheese flight.  The cheese flight comes with 5 different cheeses, bread and fruit.  It was a unique experience and a fun way to break the ice. I highly recommend Bin!",0.9787,0.758,0.242,0.0,0.5332051282051281
