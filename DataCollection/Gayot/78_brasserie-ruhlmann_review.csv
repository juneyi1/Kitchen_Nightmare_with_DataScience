For starters, we ordered shrimp cocktail, oysters on the half shell, tuna tartare, escargots, and lobster bisque.  Everything was spot on except for the tuna tartare; there was some weird sesame crunch that didn't taste quite right with the dish.  Shrimp and oysters were fresh and delicious!  Escargots were lovely with the garlic-butter sauce.  And the lobster bisque was velvety smooth and rich. Some of the entrees were stars, while some were definite misses.  The steak au poivre came out very strong - in a bad way.  The peppercorn encrusted steaks may have been left on the burner for too long because my sister couldn't finish half of it - it was too smokey and spicy.  Even my friend, who loves spicy foods, had to scrape off the crust.  The duck l'orange was beautiful; it wasn't too fatty, but wasn't dry at all.  My pork chops were excellent; it was easy to cut through and very tender. Dessert was the real highlight.  Our table had a lot of fun ordering dishes.  We had the special praline eclairs, pots de creme, coffee-chocolate mousse, lemon tart, and raspberry napoleon.  We demolished the desserts.  Though the real standouts were the pots de creme and praline eclairs.  Yummy.

2008-02-27,3.0,"First, it's worth mentioning that I was treated to lunch by a sales rep. I would not be able to afford this place on my own and it's way fancier than I would ever splurge on. It's one of those places where you don't realize there are five people watching you eat until you drop your fork... and then there is a guy who runs right over and gets you a new fork. Suddenly it dawns on you that a lot of people are watching you eat. Awkward.  Anyway, first problem: when we arrived the host looked us up and down and must've decided he didn't like what he saw because he asked if he could help us with a tone that slightly suggested we must've been lost. When he seated us he didn't ask if he could take our coats. Not necessarily a problem because I don't mind hanging my coat on the back of my chair or leaving it on the seat next to me. But then as I looked around I noticed that no one in the restaurant had coats. Which is odd in February in Chicago. That made me feel very awkward  since this was a ""fancy' place and I was the only person with my coat with me in the entire restaurant. Not a big deal though.  Our waiter was great. Can't remember his name. Tall, young African-American man. He was very attentive, he knew the menu and had great suggestions on what to eat.  Overall I'm giving three stars for the food, waiter and decor (which is awesome!). The host and host alone are the reasons I can't say five stars. He just made me incredibly self conscious that I was in a fancy restaurant and that I stuck out. I really feel like a restaurant should bend over backwards to make their clientèle feel welcome. Particularly the host.  The food is divine though. I had an asparagus soup and the truffle chicken club. Loved it. My friends had the salmon and raved about it. I also had a bite of my friend's ""macaroni gratin"" and that was so delicious. Seriously... not sure what's in it but it was so good.",0.9167,0.867,0.077,0.056,0.5819825236491903

If you want French bistro fare done right, this is the place to go.  The raw bar portion of the menu baffled me at first, but after ordering off of it, I can honestly say I think its a great addition to the otherwise rich menu.  As a self-proclaimed mussel connoisseur, I can attest to the fact that Brasserie Ruhlmann's are to die for.  I don't know French wine that well but the servers are very well-versed on the wine menu and have made excellent selections each time based on food choices and personal preferences.   This place is definitely on the pricier side so I don't recommend it as an everyday place, but great for an evening out when you feel like indulging a bit!",0.9908,0.722,0.238,0.04,0.6034052614052615

I had a fantastic experience at Brasserie Ruhlmann from the moment I walked in the door.  I fell in love with the decor and the well suited men at the front waiting to receive me.  I liked the space they left for the bar area, large enough to give weekend diners enough room to wait (for what I am sure would be long wait times) for their dinner.  I also really liked the tile that laid to look like fancy hotel carpeting and the wood paneling around the very tall beams in the  dining room.  The room was very inspiring and soothing all at once, , very Brasserie-esque.   I was most impressed with the red velvet banquettes and the seating arrangement - how entirely private each table felt although you may have been in close proximity to the next table, you felt as though you had your own space.  Not a bad table in the room that I could see.  And, most of all, I thought the acoustics were fantastic for such a grandiose room.  How, without carpeting and with such tall ceilings, did they manage to have the acoustics so well maintained?  Great music selection too. The clientele on the night that I was having dinner, a Wednesday in mid February, was much older and very distinguished.  I prefer to eat in the company of adults, so taking a look around the room was a relief - no halter tops and open toe shoes in the dead of winter here.  To the left, was an older, married couple.  Across from me were two gentleman who appeared to be enjoying a friendly business dinner.   And I was with a friend whom I had not seen in months. I started with the Moulin Rouge cocktail made with Lillet, I love it when restaurants are able to incorporate Lillet into their drink menu and I thought this was a great spot to have such a drink.  We did not look at the wine list as my friend is pregnant.   I was very impressed with my first two courses, we started with the grilled calamari served on a tomato, delicious.  We each had a salad, she had the Belgian Endive and I had the Frisee salad with egg - I love egg on my salad and it meshed quite well with my tarragon vinaigrette. Next up, my friend had the skate wing, I took a bite and it was nice.  I had the bone in fillet.  My steak was only slightly over cooked.  I ordered it medium rare and along the outskirts of the cut of meat, it was cooked too  well.  Not enough for me to complain or send it back but I did cut around the edges to eat my warm red center.     For dessert, I had the Pot de Creme which was lovely - adorably presented and light enough after a large steak.  My friend had the Profiterole which was divine. Our server was highly enthusiastic and she was also very patient with us.  We had not seen each other in a while and we sat for nearly an hour before ordering.  She never once became impatient with us (as many servers do when women are dining without the company of men).  She had excellent command of the menu and everything she mentioned I wanted to buy.  I let her choose my entree due to my great faith in her knowledge and enthusiasm. I think the only thing I wished were different was the menu selection.  I realize that they are a steak house but if you don't want steak you are fairly limited in your entree choices unless they have some great specials.",0.998,0.803,0.168,0.029,0.5329629629629631

Leaving semantics aside, I thought that the food ranged from good to excellent.  My party started with an enormous seafood platter, consisting of scallops, clams, oysters, shrimp cocktail, and mussels, and I found it to be quite fresh and well-presented.  The calamari appetizer was also excellent, and highly recommended.   We then shared the ""porterhouse for two,"" a hulking chunk of cow carved up for easy picking by the table.  While I wouldn't rate this steak in the Chop House pantheon, it was juicy, and perfectly prepared.  We tried two desserts - the pot de creme and the lemon tart.  While I found the lemon tart actually too tart and pretty underwhelming, the pot de creme was fantastic - creamy, rich, and paired with excellent lemon madeleines. I also take a slight issue with Ruhlmann's wine list.  I found it lacking in French selections (the Bordeaux and Burgundy selection needs to be beefed up) - which seemed a bit strange for a French restaurant.  The list was chock-full, however, of excellent California cabernets and pinots from Oregon and Washington.  Be warned, though - there are no bargains on this list.",0.9936,0.752,0.217,0.031,0.5973662551440329

So, last night... one negative - that AWFUL host (not hostess... host - yes, you know who you are - the only male working the front desk yesterday evening).  Words for you Mr. Host: Who taught you manners?  Were you raised by baboons?  When someone approaches the reception desk, at least have the ability (or at least fake such ability) to say hello with a meek smile.  Don't reluctantly look up, permit me to give you my last name, advise me I'm the first to arrive in my party with that annoyed tone and ignore me without even asking to take my coat or direct me to the bar!!!!!!  And then... if that didn't make matters bad enough, when my dining companion arrives and we approach the desk with drinks in hand, you proceeded to walk right past us, fail to acknowledge our standing in front of you with cocktails in hand, near a freezing door, with my dining companion holding her coat and briefcase and as if we weren't there, you play with your computer!!!  For heaven's sake - the restaurant was half empty!  What could possibly be so pressing that such behavior on your part as a host is justified! All right, now that I have ranted long enough, I must say that the cheese souffle was divine (ahem... Mr./Ms. Chef, no coarse salt needed - it's perfect as is), the charcuterie was pleasant and traditional (just the way I love it) mussels were as good as anyplace else in Chicago, the tuna was very fresh and meaty (really decent portion) and of course, I can't forget about my new favorite tarte tatin in this city.  Really... I don't know what it is, but the typically predictable dessert has found new life with this version.  Good job, Mr./Ms. Pastry Chef!

Making the reservation was a snap, and they were very accommodating when we tried for an earlier time due to some late changes in our schedule.  Arrived and seated promptly.  Beautiful room & fixtures, and the staff was very attentive witout constantly interrupting our conversation.  Like other reviewers have noted, the space is gorgeous. Started out with a couple glasses of champagne while we looked over the menu.  Passed on the prix fixe menu as it didn't seem like a great value (probably because it was new year's eve). Regardless, settled on the frise salad w/lardons & the onion soup as appetizers.  The soup was really good, but the salad was the total money shot.  I'd go back just for that. For dinner, we figured to play to their strength and ordered the bone in porterhouse for two with a broccolini side.  I have no idea why people are starting to put toasted pine nuts on veggie sides, but I hope they continue as they helped round out the taste on this side.  The broccolini was excellent.  Potatoes Ruhlmann (essentially scalloped potatoes with loads - and I mean loads - of garlic and spices) were served under the porterhouse.  Done to perfection and enough to feed 3 or 4, the steak and its seasoning were as good as any other steakhouse I've been to in the city, and better than plenty of the top ones people cite on here.   Apparently, it was the first time our waiter had served the dish, so don't be put off if your server doesn't know much about it or recommend it. Didn't hang around for desert as we had places to go, but I'm looking forward to going back to try some of their seafood apps (which looked delicious) and their deserts.  Lastly, the wine list, though not ""NoMI extensive"", has some really wonderful wines that should match most tastes.  It was also nice to see a number of good half bottles and wines by the glass available. We will be back.",0.9941,0.812,0.159,0.029,0.4949980574980576
2007-12-14,5.0,"I read the prior reviews first. Those who complain about too much meat on the menu? It's a French place - they eat meat..  Those who didn't think the desserts were ""special?""  Again, their menu choices are right on French.  Perhaps they haven't researched this restaurant, but it is unfair to judge them on being authentic and very adept at it!   I have absolutely no complaint. Waitstaff was well-trained, well-bred and attentive without being annoying. Atmosphere on a Friday for lunch was tempered and festive .. i found the tables placed surprisingly far enough apart to afford privacy.  I won't comment on the decor - enough said here already.  Of course it is pricey.  But IF you are looking for the real thing, this is the place.  Love it or leave it for the rest of us.  Bon appetit!",0.6979,0.802,0.108,0.09,0.5161375661375662
2007-12-10,3.0,"There's nothing like the sturm and drang of a weekend night at a brasserie to excite the senses and set the stage for an exciting meal. Walking into a humming Brasserie Ruhlmann, with its riot of red, brass, and chocolate shades, we anticipated a great night out.  And in that respect, it didn't disappoint. When we arrived at 9pm our table wasn't ready, so we pushed past waves of striped-shirted men and planted ourselves at the bar on a couple closely-placed bordello red stools. We ordered up a couple cocktails (a gin gimlet and a sidecar)  and toasted our salvaged night (plans had fallen through but Ruhlmann came through with an open table a few hours earlier). We were seated around 9:30 at a two top that was close -but not too close - to the couples on either side. We ordered heavy on the apps - tuna tartare, duck rillettes, squid - and shared an entree, the bouillabaisse, which promised a riot of flavor.  The rillettes were tasty. Served with a dijon mustard, cornichon, and pickled onion accompaniment, we slowly made our way through the generous portion that arrived in a glass jar. So far so good. The squid was less to my liking. Served with gratineed bread crumbs and placed on an out-of-season-here tomato, I was put off by the contrasts in texture - the crisp bread crumbs, the chewy squid, and the mushy tomato didn't seem to work. The tartare was fine. It was what I expected, no more no less. It was tasty but conservative in appearance and in flavor - wasabi is, according to 38% of the respondents to the NRA's annual ""what's hot' chef survey, is passe. (only 37% thought it was hot...no pun intended) rimag.com/web-exclusives… Our entree was fairly disappointing. The bouillabaisse broth was tasty but didn't break the top 20 list of bouillabaisses I've eaten. The langoustine in it was awful - it was served whole, which made it extremely difficult to eat, as the shell is very hard. When I finally did get the sea bug open, the protein in the meat had broken down and lacked any substance at all. It was more liquid than solid.  We decided to forego dessert.  I wasn't much in the mood for more after the bouillabaisse. It takes a exciting dessert menu these days to make me interested. And with the exception of the marjolaine, I didn't see much on the menu that struck my fancy.  I'm sure our experience would have been different had we ordered steak frites and creme brulee. No, not in this lifetime. Overall, the meal wasn't unreasonable but I'd classify it under ""mediocrity over $50 per person"". I'd be hard pressed to go again unless I was there for work-related entertainment.",0.866,0.804,0.106,0.089,0.4937184343434344
2007-11-09,3.0,"I came here on a business dinner. I wasn't a big fan of the menu selection --- it seemed to be meat & fish heavy without anything that was really creative. We started off w/ the surf & turf. The crab legs were a nice size --- but I was disappointed that they only gave us a dinky little thing of cocktail sauce for the shrimp. Oh -- and get the tuna tar-tare; that is a must-have (slightly flavorless...but VERY fresh). I ended up getting the steak au poivre. It was so-so and slightly overcooked (why can't anybody cook a good 'medium' steak anymore..wtf). The wine was very good, although the wine service sucked and didn't seem to notice me when I joined the table.  I ended up focusing on this Cabernet that they brought us....and that was good times. As far as the busing staff goes --- WTF. They were way too reachy and kept on brushing their arms across my mane. Sorry --- but that really pisses me off, and I was ready to drop some 'bos and ask them to ""excuse my reach."" Dessert was OK. The dark chocolate torte (I think it was a torte) w/ dark chocolate ice cream was killer --- so definitely get that....or what I'm calling the ""carmel jar of sin."" Don't waste your time with the lemony thing. Now let's talk ambiance. If this place was purple, and if the booths were all facing the same direction, you would think that is where Scarface was shot. I think it's because Brasserie Ruhlmann is very open, lots of red/cherry wood, and there's also a lot of brass accenting that takes place. I did like this, but the nutty pop background music kept my head spinning all night. When would I come back to Braserrie Ruhlmann? Maybe if I wanted some wine and dessert (I'll skip the food), all while pretending that I'm Tony Montana. Make way for the bad guy!",-0.9734,0.807,0.069,0.124,0.52875
2007-11-09,4.0,"Came here for a work dinner with a large group which means a lot of food.  So much that I don't know if I can recap it all. The highlights: the tuna tartare, the huge crab legs, the mussels.  We had all of these as appetizers and they were so good.  I especially loved the mussels although I only had a few (they were pretty popular). The lows: Very skimpy sauce trio to go with the giant seafood platter.  Nowhere near enough sauce available.  Also, the bread they brought out during the beginning of our meal was really hard. For my entree, I had the cod which came recommended.  However, it was only ok.  Nothing special.  The cod did come with scallops and mussels on the side which were really good (huge, meaty scallop was the best thing on the plate).  I ate everything around the cod, but was unimpressed with the main attraction. Our group also ordered a number of sides for the table and I tried a few.  Mac & cheese - amazingly good.  I don't really like mac & cheese but I would definitely order again.  The asparagus and creamed spinach were also good.   They kept the drinks coming, but not as much as I would have liked (see Louis A's review).  A few of us did try some of the specialty cocktails, and I would recommend the Moulin Rouge if you are in the mood for something sangria-esque.  Quite strong, but really tasty.   The highlight of dessert was the dark chocolate torte and ice cream.  ANything dark chocoalte is good so they really couldn't have messed this up.  The pot with caramel and ice cream was also delicious eaten just by itself.  But the lemon dessert was way too lemony.  Bleh. I really liked the atmosphere; I kept commenting on just how huge this place was.  It's enormous relative to most restaurants in the city, but it doesn't feel too overwhelming.  It's got an old school loungey vibe that makes it seem unique among Chicago restaurants that are usually trying to be hip and modern.    And I really dug the bathrooms here - I just wish they weren't so far away.",0.9967,0.785,0.193,0.022,0.554251700680272

2007-10-22,4.0,"This place has amazing food!  I went with a group of 4 and every dish was delicious.  We started off with the calamari, which was yummy (my least favorite dish of the dinner, but still very good).  I split the chateaubriand which was cooked to perfection.  It came with macaroni gratin which was a WAY up-scale yummy version of mac n'cheese.  It was also served with 3 sauces that were very good.  I also got to try the veal and the cod...both spectacular, especially the veal (the sauce was sooo good).  The Pototoes Ruhlmann were soooo rich tasting and just perfect...unbelievably good.  The desserts were good as well, but nothing too spectacular compared to the rest of the food (we had the apple tarte and another one that was not memorable).  Overall it was a lovely dining experience...I knock one star off for the price and the desserts...otherwise I highly recommend this place if you want to have a lovely dining experience!",0.9951,0.707,0.284,0.009,0.7361111111111112
2007-10-19,5.0,"You won't hear Edith Piaf's, ""La vie en rose"" playing anywhere in this swanky new french addition to the River North dining scene.  This place is far too cool for that!! Brasserie Ruhlmann has been open about a week and is located in the old Montgomery Ward building.  The space is huge!!  High ceilings, hand laid Mosaic tile swirling on the floor, white table cloth covered tables, and crushed velvet banquettes make this a feast for the eyes. The bar area alone would be worth going back for- running the length of one wall, the bar has at least 20 seats at it and there are also small tables to mingle around.  The best part?  This is one of the few places in the city that carries my favorite beer - Kronenbourg 1664!   There is also a large patio out front, one purported to be opening next year on the Chicago Ave side and a private banquet room that will hold 120 people.  Did I say this place is huge?? As for the food- we tried a little bit of everything.  They have a raw bar so we started with oysters which were delicious.  They came with three sauces- a vinegar based, traditional cocktail sauce and a mayo/mustard mix.  Call me a traditionalist but I only ate the cocktail sauce and we had to ask for a little extra horseradish.   But the oysters were fresh, fresh, fresh and very good!    Next- we went for the grilled calamari.  This was perfectly prepared.  Whole squids (4) were artfully arranged on top of tomato slices served with a pesto sauce.  I could have eaten that as my entree it was so good.   For entrees we had the mussels -amazing broth- served with french fries for dipping and a steak- perfectly done.  We also tried as a side the macaroni and gratinee which was all cheese and little macaroni but we were not complaining!! The wines by the glass, though limited and a bit expensive, were good and the server was accommodating to bring a taste of a couple we were unfamiliar with so that we could choose which one we like best. Our servers were great. Attentive and helpful and very friendly. The only wish that we had was  at one point when the front of the house and back of the house servers, bussers and manager all converged on our small table at the same time- it was a little overwhelming!! You have to check this place out!  It's beautiful interior and great food and service will have you saying ""ooh la la"" in no time at all.",0.9984,0.778,0.206,0.016,0.5194300436405699

2007-10-16,1.0,This place was the worst service I have ever experienced.  The staff was so un-educated on the menu and had no idea what they were doing.  We were seated and then asked to move when there were 30+ open tables.  The waitress spilled wine all over our table and then never cleaned it up.  We basically served ourself.  For spending over $250 we could have had better service at Olive Garden.  I think the owners would be really disappointed in this outlet because their other establishments are so great.  It got to a point where it was comical.  I felt like we were being punked.  I think the patio has potential but obviously they aren't ready to be open.,-0.2939,0.871,0.056,0.073,0.6895833333333333
2007-10-12,4.0,"My wife and I were so happy to have this restaurant open as we live in the building. Thankfully, the food is quite good.  I see another reviewer thought the tartare was flavorless and while I agree somewhat, at least the fish was fresh. Good: I had the hanger steak with carmelized onions which was very tasty,  a side of perfectly cooked broccolini with pine nuts while my wife had the duck which was very tender.  As for dessert, we had the pot au creme which was delicious!! Bad or needs work:  Wine list. Not a lot of selection by the glass and pretty pricey. We went with a carafe of pinot (500ml) for 22 which was quite good.  Service was attentive, maybe a bit too attentive sort of like hanging over your table. Overall, I'd give it a 4.5.  We're going back with some friends this weekend so I may have more updates. While it may take a week or two to work out the kinks, the nice decor and good food should do well in the long run.",0.9905,0.743,0.228,0.028,0.603030303030303

I had the Steak au Poivre. It had a peppercorn sauce with it. I thought it was good, but I'm not actually a huge fan of pepper. It came with a side of macaroni & cheese. Which was good but there was a lot of liquid in the bottom, which I figured was either olive oil or butter. My friend had the onion soup and she commented that it was great. Had the Raspberry Napolean for dessert which was good and light with the fruit. The place is a little pricey as with any ""steakhouse"". They have a huge outdoor area, which looks like it'll be awesome with some good weather. Unfortunately today it is the first 50 degree day after having 80 degrees yesterday.
