This place is nearby so I've been there many times over the last 10 years.  The service is OK at best and usually it's BAD.  The place is almost always empty and they still make you wait forever.  I keep on giving them another chance and they keep reminding me not to go back.   Examples of bad experiences: - Waiting to be seated for 15 minutes when we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant - Waitress or waiter takes your order and you never see them again.  I've actually had to go to the register to pay because they never came back to give us the check, much less refilling drinks. (this has happend more than once) It's been so consistently bad that it just has to be managed poorly.  These aren't flukes.

2011-07-03,4.0,"I eat too much pizza. I love pizza too darn much.  And here's where I offend most Chicagoans....I do not like deep dish. Would I like it here or there? I would not like it here or there, I would not like it anywhere.  Give me a good crispy, thin crust. Or even a doughy-foldable New York style. I feel like it's almost blasphemous to say this in Chicago, but there...I've said it. I don't see anyone with pitchforks outside my door, so I guess we're good. For now. Despite my avoidance of deep dish, I still love pizza in Chicago, hunting down the elusive perfect thin crust.  Edwardo's does well. Enough so that I keep going back.  I've never eaten in at this location, which seems to be many other reviewers run into issues. They're so close to home, I just walk my butt over there for take-out, and justify the ""exercise"" as offsetting all the pizza calories.  I'm pretty basic when it comes to pizza. Light sauce, good cheese, and spinach. That's my regular. If I'm in the mood, I add flavor via basil and artichokes. So any pizza place that offers these three ingredients is A-Ok in my book. (You'd be surprised how many places don't offer -any- of these three ingredients.) The roommate tolerates my affinity for veggies over meat toppings, so we're all good. The sauce is tasty, but doesn't overwhelm the other ingredients. I haven't had to specify light sauce since a) they don't drown the pizza in sauce, and b) the quality of the sauce is good enough that I enjoy, rather than tolerate, eating it.  The crust is crispy, though a tad too thick for my personal tastes. (I dig communion wafer thin.) They provide adequate coverage of the pizza with your ordered toppings. No worries about ordering a pepperoni, and seeing five sad little slices.  And if you roll in around closing (not hard to do with how early they close), and there's a really friendly lady working the register, you could totally walk out with some free peanut butter cookies.  Which are my roommate's favorites. So I stroll home, and he's in awe ""You bought me cookies? Oh these are delicious. You're awesome!""  Uh, yeah sure, I'll totally take the credit for the cookies.  If you also have a sudden meatball craving, just go with it. Once you peel off the slice of unmelted cheese on top (kind of weird), you uncover two huge, delicious meatballs. Yeah, I won't eat meat on my pizza, but roll it into a ball, and offer it as a side, and I'm totally down with that.  Now, is it just me, or is pizza really flipping pricey in Chicago, compared to other options? As much as I spend on a large pizza, I can score an appetizer and entree take-out from Chinese, Indian, a burger joint, etc.  Granted that doesn't stop me from eating pizza....a lot. It's just an observation. Weird note: In the later evening when I try to order via GrubHub (have laptop, will not leave chair), they tell me that Edwardo's is closed. So I have to haul my butt up, remember where I put my phone down, and then *gasp* dial a number and speak to a person! Oh, the humanity! I understand they won't take web orders close to closing time, but this has been two or more hours before close. A quirk on Edwardo's side or GrubHub's side, who's to say. But if GrubHub says Edwardo's is closed when they should be open, just pick up a phone, reach out and touch someone for your pizza. Or not, that could probably get you arrested these days.",0.9974,0.8,0.154,0.047,0.5211282912775451

My mouth begins to water when I walk in the door (I always order it for pick up because it is extremely close).

This experience has literally left a bad taste in our mouths and hopefully this information will help Edwardo's to rectify the quality at the 521 Dearborn establishment and perhaps someday we may again become patrons of Edwardo's once there are noticeable improvements.",0.7311,0.778,0.124,0.098,0.4158571058571059

2008-06-03,2.0,"I grew up in the Minneapolis metro area, and once upon a time, mere blocks away from my house, there was a wonderfully delicious pizza place called Edwardo's. My greatest, most salivating pizza memories stem from their thin crust sausage, pepperoni, and deep-dish spinach pizzas. But one day they up and left Minnesota forever, and my little pizza heart was broken.  So when I moved to Chicago in 2007, one of my goals was to get pizza from the original Chicago branch of my favorite childhood pizzeria. The occasion came on a cold winter day to order some delivery, and Edwardo's was at the front of my brain. 45 minutes later, a large thin crust cheese pizza arrived at my girlfriend's doorstep and I was wide-eyed and wet-mouthed in anticipation. Results? Disappointment. Is it possible to get good delivery pizza these days? This pizza couldn't really be called hot anymore, the cheese was rubbery, the sauce mediocre. Where was the spice, the tanginess, the little salty flavorful bites of Edwardo's pizzas from my youth? They were absent at the table this day. It was as if some run-of-the-mill pizzeria had come across an Edwardo's box and put a pizza in it and brought it to my door for fun (and profit). It... made me lose hope in Chicago pizza. I had been holding out, waiting for this moment, putting up with other pizza mediocrity... for this? Maybe it just wasn't meant to be. Maybe it was just that Bloomington, Minnesota, touch that made those pizzas the best in the West. Have I lost faith in you, Mr. or Mrs. Edwardo? Probably. But somewhere out there is a pizza which has just the right crispiness, just the right gooeyness, and just the right sauciness to put an unshakable grin on my face. Just like old times.",0.9815,0.835,0.125,0.04,0.5589901477832512

2008-04-07,4.0,"I have to say I'm surprised by all the bad reviews for Edwardo's.  I'm usually more critical than most yelpers. I went to Edwardo's after being robbed.  I withdrew some money from my checking account, cancelled all my cards, filed a police report, called my mom and cried, and decided to get some comfort pizza from Edwardo's, since it was nearby.  It was effective. At first I thought ""healthy pizza?  If I wanted something healthy, why would I get pizza?""  Not that I have a problem with healthy food - I like food that's naturally healthy, but food that's normally fattening and has been altered to be healthy makes me suspicious. If I were in the mood for healthy food I'd get japanese or korean or a salad.   But I looked in the window, and to tell the truth, none of the customers ar Edwardo's looked particularly healthy. No offense - I don't look very healthy either.  To me, when a restaurant is full of obese people, that's a red flag and it probably has bad food.  When it's full of healthy people, it could go either way, really, since some fit people are particular about only putting good food in their mouth, while others just eat for nutrition and don't care too much about taste.  When it's filled with people who are thirty to forty pounds overweight, like me, I feel pretty confident that the food isn't super healthy but not super fatty either.  Edwardo's is such a place, so I walked in. It lived up to expectations.  The food was quick, and very satisfying.  I usually don't like Italian dressing, but they make theirs in house and it was pretty good with their salad.  The pizza was great and the sauce had just enough flavor.  It wasn't dry or lacking in fat or flavor - it wasn't greasy either.  I'll be back.",0.9914,0.681,0.215,0.104,0.5427536231884058

Let me clarify.  The stuffed pizza we ordered pretty much consisted of the following: - Decent amounts of the fillings we ordered (sausage, spinach, etc... okay, so far so good) - A decidedly bland and very mediocre crust. - About a half-a-teaspoon of tomato sauce per slice... spread thinly on TOP of the pizza?! - Tons and tons and tons of cheese.  Too much tons. - Not a whole lot of flavor.
