2013-03-12,4.0,"EDIT: unfortunately this place closed right after Christmas 2012 and is no longer in Chicago.  ~ We wanted dinner, with no wait, and Bucca di Beppo filled the bill.  Every other place in town has an hour wait, but although they were busy we got right in.  They are a chain, that doesn't feel like a typical chain restaurant.  The walls are filled with hilarious old Italian black and white photographs of nuns, priests, children and adults in just nutty situations or poses or just catching an odd moment.   The old advertisements in the bathroom cracked me up as well!    All food is served family style in large bowls which makes the price very reasonable.  A dish of baked Ravioli is what we ordered this time, and it was delicious.  The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was flavorful and the Italian sausage was nice and spicy.  I decided to only eat half of my rigatoni because I have a sweet tooth and wanted to order this delicious looking brownie with ice cream served in a martini glass that is pictured on the menu.    OH MY GOSH this was SO EMBARRASING!    It took FOR-EV-ER for this dessert to come out and the HUMILIATION was complete when people watching her carry it out saw that it was just for me.    HOLY fudgebrowniesundae!    I got a LOT of laughs at my shock. That being said....I'm glad I didn't know how big it was because then I would not have ordered it.   This martini glass could have fit over my head.  Fully.  I think there were at least 20 small brownies in the bottom, topped with at least 8 inches of homemade whipped cream, sprinkles and chocolate and vanilla ice cream in the middle.   And yeah!  I ate it!     We are in CHICAGO so EVERYTHING has been super expensive.....so we were starting to panic wondering how enormous was the bill going to be for this thing......   I thought that I saw $13 for the dessert...I was like....ehhh?  Its Chicago.   But I'm sorry...they could have sold this amount of food to about 10 diners!  I really thought I got the wrong thing.    It was Ohmygoshdelicious but holy crapoli!!!     So, kudos Bucca di Beppo!    Dinner AND entertainment!   I'll be back!!!",0.9887,0.791,0.141,0.068,0.5127235772357722

2012-07-29,1.0,"Horrible. Disgusting. Abominable. Lousy. Garbage. This has got to be the worst service I have ever, ever experienced. Let's start the rant: 1. Appetizer plates were dirty and had some leftover pieces of cheese on the plate. Asked for replacements and got even dirtier plates with a CHUNK of red leftover meat ...how did the waitress not see this?  2. Asked for extra bread after we received our appetizer. Waitress dropped off our dinner plates (25 minutes before we actually received our main course) and promised to bring back bread. That was the last time we ever saw her...which brings me to.. 3. Our waitress. Oh my goodness...our waitress. I guess when she applied for the job, making people 'wait' was part of her job description rather than waiting on people instead. We saw her a total of 4 times. Drink order/drop off drink order and got our order/dropped off dinner plates/check. Except...we had to get out of our seats, find a hostess, and ask that hostess to find our waitress in order for us to receive our check. And then this lady has the audacity to ask us, ""It was an amazing meal rightt?!?"" completely clueless to our pasta bowls which were still filled with pasta, our sullen faces, and our empty glasses that were begging to be refilled ever since she dropped off our dinner plates.  4. This whole nightmare of a dinner took approximately 2 hours from the moment me and my sister were seated. 1 1/2 hours of that time was spent waiting. Waiting for our food. Waiting for our waitress. Waiting for our check. It's Italian food. Sauces are already prepared and probably sitting in a bain marie in a hot bath, waiting to be poured over pasta that is already cooked and sitting somewhere else. It's horrible to have to wait 40 minutes for your main entree after getting your appetizer...and then have your food not even worth the wait.  5. Our food was served by different busboys (probably due to the fact that our waitress was MIA). We ordered the chopped antipasto salad, the spicy chicken rigatoni, and a side of fettuccine alfredo. Salad was overdressed and definitely over-salted but that didn't bother me and my sister too much. What was really, really atrocious was the rigatoni. Our pasta was under-cooked so much that we had less than a spoonful each and just ate the fettuccine alfredo. If I am paying $20 a plate for PASTA, I had better be impressed. Our pasta was definitely undercooked. Al dente is one thing, this...was hard enough to probably put a dent in your teeth instead. We would have asked our waitress to bring it back to the kitchen...EXCEPT..oh right, we had no waitress. ~~~~~ I'm sure there's approximately 5-10 other reasons I could rant about but the main point is...Please, please go somewhere else.

After a full day of fun in Chicago, my sister, nephew and I hit decided this was the place for a late dinner since it was right next to our hotel. My five-your-old nephew ended up falling asleep at the table just two bites into his food after the long day, but that didn't damper the experience. Before nighty-night time, we had a tour of the kitchen (which was very cool for my nephew) and ordered our drinks/dinner. Our server seemed a bit thrown off my the inquisitiveness of my very precocious nephew, which seemed strange to me for such a kid friendly environment. But we worked through it and ordered him a lemonade with cherries in it and the kid's spaghetti - which incidentally is large enough for about four kids, so we had a ton of leftovers.  My sister and I both ordered a glass of sangria (okay) and split the penne alla vodka with some extra spinach and mushrooms thrown in to get more veggies. The pasta dish was very good with a slight bite to the sauce, and the veggies were cooked to perfection. No dessert as we had to get the sleeping child back to the room, but they all looked delicious (and HUGE). The bread that they bring to the table before dinner was cold; warming it up a bit would have been a nice touch.  We didn't have to park or wait for a table on a Monday night, which was nice.

Tips: 2-4 people.  Get any one small pasta and one small salad or regular appetizer. 4-5 people.  Get any one large pasta and one small salad or regular appetizer. 5-6 people.  Get any two small pastas and one large salad or regular appetizer. 6+ people.  Get any two large pastas and one large salad or regular appetizer. You'll probably have enough leftovers to take home.  They really push drinks here, and even soft drinks are kind of pricey.  The dessert-sundae thing that's served in a huge martini glass is gargantuan.  If you have at least 3 or 4 people that can split it, the dessert is worth the $13, since all their other desserts are around $5-$8 each. This is a terrific place for kids and large groups.  Friendly employees, and I don't think I've ever seen a crowd waiting to get in.  I know they take reservations; you'll need them for large groups of 8 or more.

2011-04-06,2.0,"I remember when I first went to Buca's-- it was in Pittsburgh, and it was still a novelty then. It was fun, because I had yet to experience other restaurants outside of the idiom. Coming from an Italian background, where spaghetti and the family gravy were a Sunday staple, it's extremely difficult to like any Italian food in a restaurant. And that goes for Buca's. I recently sat in the Pope Room for a book club gathering, and it worked well-- it fit us all quite comfortably, and we had a great time.  The food however is really just so-so.  Very saucy dishes without any real attention paid to slow cooking the sauce. Cheesy dishes with, frankly, way too much cheese. Fried dishes that are way too fried.  It's Italian, I guess, but it's Italian that just sits there and screams I'M ITALIAN... EAT ME!!!!!! Meh. So, I don't know. I guess go here for a birthday or whatever if you must.  But why on Earth would you go here to experience real Italian food?",0.6597,0.897,0.067,0.036,0.3123015873015873

We sat in a part of the restaurant that was hosting parties, so everyone was trying to yell over each other.  Besides all of that it was a pretty good experience.  On the way to our table the hostess walked us through the kitchen which was pretty interesting, it was not a long tour at all and everyone was really friendly. We ordered the cheesy bread which was decent, Ziti and Gnocchi.  The Gnocchi was really good and well prepared, but everything else was pretty average.  Had dessert that was over priced.  Not sure if I would come back here, but food was decent.  If you are in a group of 4 or more I would recommend Maggianos over this place.",0.9794,0.829,0.164,0.007,0.583829365079365

Buca di Beppo was suggested because of the family style menu so that was where we headed. The parade through the kitchen is just plain weird. I'm really not sure why they do it. To prove the kitchen is clean? I was actually grossed out by the fact that a group of strangers may have been parading by my meal and potentially coughing around my food, etc. But I digress.  The food was all fine. We had a caprese salad and one of the greens salads. I really enjoyed the greens - cheese, nuts, berries, etc. Very tasty. We got one of the pastas, lemon chicken, and chicken parmigiana. All were pretty decent. The adults shared 2 bottles of moderately priced wine. Maybe I'm delusional (it's a possibility...) but the bill came to about $30 per person.... definitely not what we were hoping for affordability wise, and especially since at least 2 of our diners are kids. While the portions were large, I guess I was just not expecting it to be around $270.  I think it's a good place to go in a group, but I won't think it's a more ""affordable"" option in the future - next time we want that we'll just go out for a couple pizzas or something.

This place has a Sinatra shrine and neon spray painted Goddess statuary all over. I love my Goddesses best when they're hot pink and lime green, no joke. It's trashy in the most fabulous, drag queen-esque way and I'm not sure if they realize it or not.  Evidence Item #2: The food. I don't mean to say that this is the best Italian you could get in Chicago. Of course it isn't. We live in Chicago. But if you want great food from a place that doesn't take itself too seriously, this is it. The gnocci and manicotti are both great. The salads are the real deal here, though. The caprese is always fresh and tasty, with whole basic leaves and firm tomatoes. They have another salad with a name I can't remember that includes walnuts, cranberries, and blue cheese and it is ridiculously tasty. Honestly, I could come here just for the salads, I love it that much. Evidence Item #3: My final bill. Food here is served family style, and that means it can be as cheap and you want it to be. Our usual bill for three is between $25 and $45, though it could be even cheaper if we'd stop ordering so much salad. You could probably feed 2-3 well for $13 if you had the ravioli, but like I said, we love the salads.",0.9802,0.807,0.149,0.045,0.5290849673202613

They discontinued my favorite entree (it cost the fools a star) so I was really upset about that. The tortellini was, without question, the best pasta entree they had. So once they discontinued it, I was reluctant to return to Buca.  But eventually I came back, and had to look for another pasta I might like.. And so I found it. Its not as good as the Tortellini but it is rather delicious! So the following are my recomendations: Appetizers: Mozarella Caprese Fried Calamari  Bruschetta ALL DELICIOUS STARTERS.  Pasta: Linguine Frutti di Mare- (a seafood party in your mouth!) Penne Arrabbiata- spicy and delish! and of course my newfound favorite, Shrimp Fra Diavolo.  Entrees: Chicken with Lemon- A MUST TRY! Chicken Marsala  and Chicken Parmigiana is also delicious! The Cheesecake is to die for.  Its funny cause I hate garlic, but I love this place. Weird. Its reasonably priced, seeing as how the portions are extremely generous! Drinks are good. Sometimes strong. I guess it all depends on the day... It varies. I almost always drink wine here anyway.

After the tour past the kitchen table and the Pope table, you'll take a seat among a quirky collection of photographs that become increasingly entertaining with closer examination.  The atmosphere's convivial, so it's a great restaurant for a casual date or a party, and you'll get better value than at the average Italian restaurant.  Pizza and pasta both have happier homes elsewhere, but for a functional family of other Italian food, Buca di Beppo's our choice spot.",0.9973,0.682,0.265,0.052,0.5135708589655957

We were there from around 7 p.m. to 10:30 p.m., and it was one of the most relaxing, enjoyable dining experiences I've ever had. There was a slight feeling of neglect by the waitress when it came to drinks and bread, but the flow of the evening was about on par. The conversation was good, the waitress was friendly, and the food was pretty good for what we asked for. There are plenty of options for every type of diner -- we had me, who wouldn't eat the beef/cheese, pork and shellfish options, as well as a devout vegetarian. Even with getting the family-style meal option, we managed to have something for everyone. It came out piping hot and ready to be consumed. We left with a smattering of lasagna and one chicken canneloni leftover. It was a successful meal, and we even managed to skip the dessert!

My boss' surprise birthday party was at Buca Di Beppo this past Friday and we had a great time, on the company dime.  Service for our party of 20-someodd was pretty good, not fantastic. There were times we were left wondering where the wait staff was but those moments were not frequent enough to subtract a star. From my previous times at Buca (their now-closed Clark location) I started them at a solid four stars.  How did we land at three, you might ask.  Well. They lost our order. We're talking hundreds and hundreds of dollars in food. Written on a notepad and promptly misplaced. We were sitting, King Arthur's roundtable-style pounding our forks and knives on the table demanding our sustenance and food was nowhere to be found. Big, bad no-no. The waitron informed us they were ""working as fast as they could to get it done"" and that it would be another 15-20 minutes.  Now I've worked service industrial so I'm not blaming the wait staff in any way. I'm not even blaming the kitchen staff, psychotic and drug-addled as they undoubtedly were. I'm just not happy about this in general. Two stars off, for sure. Especially given no one from management came out to say, like, sorry.  So where did that last star come from? The wait staff's unabashed praise and adornment of my son. Yes, that's right. I was bought off with compliments about my heir's good looks and well-tempered attitude. Even when he started getting a lil' cranky due to overtiredness they gave nary a rolled eye or hushed comment (that I heard) and for that I think they get one star back. As I sat off to the side of a hallway tickling my boy and calming him down one of the waiters looked over and commented, ""Parenthood, the best diet around,"" and went about his way.

When it comes to the food - one of my factors for judging authenticity of any Italian restaurant is a caprese salad - in this case the tomato had clearly come straight from the fridge, and the amount of mozarella was not really proportionate to the tomatoes. Disappointing.  My husband had the fettucine alfredo which was really nice when it came out but as it started to cool the pasta got really dry and starchy. I also don't really appreciate packaged parmesan on the table instead of freshly grated but that's rare these days.

2005-09-26,3.0,"A great Italian family restaurant.  The portions are HUGE (so order accordingly).  A girlfriend of mine and I came for some wine and split a shrimp dish and an order of tiramisu.  Probably the best tiramisu I've had, but we were so stuffed we couldn't finish it (I don't think I've ever seen a dessert this big).  They do a great job with large groups too.",0.9156,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.4612244897959183

2005-08-11,3.0,"The idea of Buca Di Beppo is great. Italian food served family style. It allows you to try a bit of everything. This is a great option for when a large group of people come in town. However, I wasn't all too impressed with the food I ordered. I've had better pasta at plenty of other places.",0.8606,0.779,0.18,0.041,0.5433673469387755
2005-08-10,3.0,"This Italian food is great and they have a large menu to choose from. I did think the portions were huge so be ready to take some home for lunch the next day! I suggest picking two dishing and sharing them between a few people, that way you get to try more than just one of their tasty dishes!!!",0.9208,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.3973214285714286
2005-08-04,3.0,The food here is really good but the service in the bar area is terrible.  Its got a pretty good atmosphere though and the portions are huge so its a great place to go with a bunch of people.,0.9481,0.557,0.366,0.077,0.8083333333333335
2005-07-15,5.0,One of our favorites! Plentiful family-style entrees  (two people can even share if they can agree on something). Only eat the garlic bread if you LOVE garlic...you will taste it for weeks. Dinner and drinks for two can start at about $25.,0.914,0.749,0.251,0.0,0.8
