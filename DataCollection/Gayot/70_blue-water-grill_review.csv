The fish is supposedly excellent, and I can say firsthand that the scallops are excellent. It seems a bit odd at first that they come with short ribs, but that's just twice the deliciousness, I guess. Many people I've come here with love the chopped salad. Very good restaurant.

2008-11-17,5.0,"I will start this review by stating this place was recommended by my phone after I shook it a bit.  Man does that phone know its food. This place was actually really excellent and probably one of the best meals I have had in quite some time and I have been on a good run lately.  The menu doesn't have extensive options but what is on there is unique, well thought out and presented perfectly.  The menu is an interesting combination of sushi house and standard seafood restaurant, it by no means ""fusion"" though.  Their wine list is actually a small novel and also extremely unique.  I have been wanting to try a white burgundy, which I have been reading are excellent, under appreciated and difficult to find.  They have about 6 or 7.  We got a Pinot this time, but there is always next time which I think there will be plenty of. The wait staff is very friendly, informed and although the place was dead they managed to find a good balance of not forgetting about us or being overbearing.  The atmosphere in the spot is also very inviting.  There are plenty of windows to view outside but not enough to feel like you are monkeys at the zoo.  We sat in a booth that was comfortable and relaxing.  Their music selection is probably the best I have heard in a restaurant that doesn't have a live band or DJ.   Now to the grub, we got the hot rock beef that you cook at the table and I probably wouldn't get it again.  It wasn't bad and I had always wanted to try it but since we got it out of the way it is done.  The lady had Braised Short Ribs and Scallops which complimented each other perfectly.  The short rib just fell apart and melted in your mouth and the scallops were amazing.  I got the Sea Bass with Escarole and a real nice tomato type sauce.  It is difficult to describe properly but it was excellent on every level.  It was cool to see escarole used in a dish like that and not have it be an Italian place. So now the best part, they have a funnel cake dessert that could be the best thing I have ever had and creates the serious possibility that we could be stopping back there just to have that.  It comes with a fresh whipped cream/mascarpone dipping sauce that is kicka$$.  They really are more like French Dounuts then funnel cake but I'm not going to split hairs.  We also got the three ice cream sampler, I would suggest Ginger, Pistachio and Passion Fruit sorbet.

The interior is sleek, modern, and trendy without trying too hard and the food is always consistently outstanding.  I hadn't been in a while, but we chose to dine here tonight. Between our party of four, we split two sushi rolls to start out - the special roll of the night was a crunchy tempura tuna, pineapple, wrapped in soy paper and topped with rock shrimp as well as the fillet roll which was delicious. We split two salads as well - the ceaser and chopped which were great as well. For entrees, two of us had the NY strip which was cooked perfectly medium rare and the flavor was on par with traditional steak houses, the other two had the fillet and halibut, also great. We finished dinner off with the decadent Slice of Blue Water cake which is pretty much like s'mores in a cake form. Enormous and definitely not meant to be shared by less than 4 people!

2008-08-12,2.0,"yawn  A friend and I were trying to grab a quick lunch in River North, and we walked by this place.  I looked at their menu and immediately recognized that it was a watered down chain restaurant sort of place, but my friend thought the menu looked good, so we settled on it. As far as quality of food goes, you get exactly what you pay for.  No more, no less.  But it was sooo unmemorable and lacking in flavor.  Sure, you get a good serving of lump crab in your crab dish, and crab is expensive, but what about bringing out the crab taste and making the most of it?   Service was so-so.  Competent but not good.  I hated my wine (a New Zealand sauvignon blanc with a weird after taste, or so it seemed to my admittedly inexperienced wine palate), and apologetically and politely told my waiter I wasn't happy with it.  His response: ""So, what, do you want something else instead?"" Er, even though I didn't have the wine list, and he didn't offer to bring me one.  I was a part time server at a restaurant myself, and if someone was unhappy with a wine my response would be to ascertain what she didn't like about it and help her choose one fitting to her taste.   And a customer certainly can't choose one by herself without a wine list!  He seemed slightly impatient and annoyed, even though he only had one other table.  Not a big deal, but the place strikes me as a place that's used to catering just to tourists. The level of service should reflect the concept of the restaurant, and it doesn't here.   Anyway, if in the future I were to take friends out for sushi, I would take them to Toro or Sushi Wabi, where the fish tastes a lot more fresh and interesting and the service is perfect every time.",0.9818,0.769,0.151,0.08,0.6028091979704883

The tables are all really close to each other, so if you want to keep your conversation private, good luck. The lighting was a bit harsh. We felt like we were in a cafeteria. They could have toned it down a few notches and the ambiance would have been suburb. Our server was amazing. She was very knowledgeable on every item in the menu as well as the 5 page wine list.  She lead us through the raw portions of the menu and helped me figure out which oysters and clams I should try.  For my first time trying those slippery little suckers, I was fairly impressed and she put my mind at ease. She had several tables and seemed overwhelmed at times, but always made it a point to check in on us, albeit, in a hurried state. We had 2 bottle of Pinot Noir, and that definitely went well with our choices. I ordered the Baja Maki and the Filet Maki. Both were excellent. Very tasty and by far the best 'fancy' sushi I've had. Two of the other girls got the Chilean Sea Bass, and said it was pretty good. A bit bland, but the potato ravioli that came with the entree' was really delicious. My other friend got the Seared Diver Scallops and was not impressed. She said she kept biting into 'sand' and the couscous were too watery. . The only other complaint we had was a superficial one.  As we looked around the restaurant we noticed several patrons were dressed  casually. There was a woman in a green baseball hat and t-shirt dress and several men in shorts and t-shirts.   We actually discussed whether it was okay to refuse to seat people based on the attire code (dressy). If men can't get into certain bars or clubs because of their shoes, surely they same standard should be set for a nice restaurant.  If you are going to drop $100 a person for a meal, at least have the courtesy of dressing appropriately.

We started off with a couple of crab cakes for the table.  They were kind of small.  Good for a one-person appetizer, not quite enough to share.  I also got the greens salad.  It had some sweet walnuts in it, which I normally find ridiculous but it worked pretty well in this salad. I got the rare tuna sandwich which was like eating a sushi sandwich.  The wasabi on the bun was a nice touch but the rare tuna was a little chewy and hard to pull apart.  It tasted great though.  If I go back, I'll be sure to get some sushi. For dessert, I got the sorbet.  The other flavors were so-so but the vanilla was pretty great.  Some of the desserts were out of control - 12 layer marshmallow and chocolate cake and a giant funnel peanut-butter thing.

Since I hit the raw stuff with the appetizers, I ordered a california roll and a Maine lobster roll for my meal.  Both were fresh and absolutely delicious.  And well priced at 7-12 bucks per roll!   I'm back in my office now with a tummy full of sushi and I couldn't be happier!",0.9516,0.82,0.136,0.045,0.5478729603729604

2008-05-05,4.0,"I would have never put two and two together and even considered ordering sushi at a place known for serving fish (duh) but sure enough, that's exactly what I did. The thing you have to keep in mind w/ me and sushi places is that I've come to accept the fact that a ""perfect"" sushi place does not exist w/ me.  I'm of the firm belief that if you can find a place that does a few items perfectly, you can consider yourself lucky and only go there for those specific items only. With that said, I'd like to point out that the Baja Maki at Blue Water Grill is among the best rolls I've ever had.  Period.   If you read the menu, the Baja Maki is described this way:  yellowtail, tuna, jalapeno, avocado salsa.  This is your ""traditional"" 'Texas/Mexican Roll' but the way it's presented at Blue Water Grill is beyond comparison to any of the previous incarnations. What the menu doesn't really explain is that the salsa is actually poured on top of the roll and plays a huge part in making the maki work.  There are slices of fried plantain (?), avocado, onion, cilantro, jalapeno and a slight touch of lime that just ignites the roll to life. If you've been keeping tabs on my sushi reviews, you already know I'm not a big fan of fancy-shmancy rolls that try to over complicate things but the Baja Maki is a shining example of what happens when a perfect union of cultural tastes fuse to create a dish that showcases the best of each individual input. Simply stated, this is one maki roll you should not miss.  --- The restaurant itself tries a bit too hard and is really not friendly nor attentive (which really should drop this review to 3 stars) but just by the strength of the Baja Maki alone, it still gets 4 stars from me.",0.9915,0.814,0.148,0.038,0.47816257816257807

I was really impressed my first few times at Blue Water, and the hits just keep on coming!! Not only is the food and service always top notch, but the raw bar always kicks ass and that kind of consistency is definitely deserving of 5 star kudos.  Blue Water Grill is not only one of the best seafood restaurants in Chicago, but has the setting to match. A modern twist with lots of seductive lighting, wood, mirrors and steel makes BWG ideal for date nights, entertaining clients and groups alike. The bar on the main floor and hip Starfish lounge upstairs both serve awesome signature cocktails like the Tokyo Rose and Honey Pear - they also mix this girls favorite, a mean extra dirty martini with overstuffed bleu cheese olives, which is a great precursor to the fantastic menu options.  I always get something special from the raw bar... they have some of the freshest oysters, clams and sashimi you can find in Chicago. I actually sampled Sea Urchin for the first time here and thought it was surprisingly tasty - I'm sure that may have been a feat elsewhere. It was nothing in comparison though to the creamy wasabi tuna maki and rainbow maki. If you like sushi, try these rolls, they're delicious!!!  On all my visits I've always ordered fish for my entree so I can't really comment on their meat selections, although many a dining partner have raved about their surf and turf. My personal go-to choice is the Mahi-Mahi with lobster dumplings in a miso broth. It is outstanding and pretty low-guilt especially for this girl who loves her red meat.

I came here for a work lunch, and most of my coworkers didn't want to eat sushi, so they were happy with their filet sandwiches and mahi mahi.  You can find salmon and hamburgers on the menu as well.  The steamed mussels appetizers are plump and cooked with a light yellow sauce and sliced Chinese sausage that was slightly spicy.  The crab cakes were moist and not dense.  I tried the filet, baja, rainbow, ahi tuna, and California makis (rolls).  None were spectacular, but I give BWG credit for fancying up traditional maki rolls with a couple of unique ingredients like jalapenos and mangos.  The 12-layer chocolate/marshmallow cake was indeed 12 layers tall but tasted like stale cake.  Prices are fairly expensive: 6-piece rolls cost $10-15 and entrees are $25+.  And lastly, the service we had was phenomenal.  I never had my water glass more than 1/3 empty, and we got everything we asked for promptly and courteously.  However, I don't think I'll ever come back here for food but maybe for drinks.",0.8814,0.929,0.056,0.015,0.468883547008547

2007-11-20,4.0,"My boyfriend (who is now a Yelp convert!) actually discovered this place while we searched frantically on his phone for a nearby place to eat dinner at last weekend. All of the ones listed before it didn't have space for last-minute reservations, so we finally got in for a fairly late dinner here, but boy was it worth it! I wish I knew the name of our waitress because she was fabulous and gave great recommendations. We opted for two appetizers because we were so hungry (note: the bread is good while you're waiting) and the portions didn't look huge anyway. We chose the stuffed calamari based on a recommendation and had the striploin on a hot rock too. I'm a big fan of calamari and they prepare it quite uniquely here - the stuffed shrimp makes it so tasty and we devoured the stuffed wrap too. The striploin was delicious as well and smelled so good the table next to us kept looking over. I also liked the presentation of the spices and sauces for dipping the meat in (and they tasted good too). For the entrees, I picked the scallops and my boyfriend had the halibut. We felt the halibut was a bit dry and slightly bland (hence the 4.5 stars), but my scallops were incredibly moist and delicious, and well complemented by the butternut squash puree. I would go back there just for the scallops, but I hear they're not offered all the time, so I'd better do it soon! Even though we were pretty full after all this, we still ordered dessert because that's how we spoil ourselves on the weekends...so after much deliberation, we went for the chocolate caramel crunch bar. It was better than we expected and the layers of the bar had a great texture, which went well with the hazelnut ice cream. I have to say I was a little worried by the idea of sea salt (which I figured must be a significant quantity to warrant a mention on the menu) but it actually went very well with the dish. Some of the other desserts we saw other people eating looked good, too, so do save a little room if you can. One last thing - the atmosphere here was great and even though it was fairly crowded we still had plenty of space and felt like it was intimate enough to have a good conversation. Our table was positioned such that we also had a sneak peek of what was going on in the kitchen, which not only looked surprisingly immaculate and orderly, but also provided us with a lovely view all night long.",0.9986,0.776,0.206,0.018,0.5727430555555556

2007-11-12,1.0,"What a disappointment. Ultimately it seems the kitchen struggles with what they are creating. I can see the attempt, but it's all just poorly executed. Haute Cuisine with neither. Their website spends the first two paragraphs talking about the decor and experience before even mentioning the food. That mentality shows in their culinary execution.  The Blue Water came recommended as one of the two MUST DO seafood restaurants in Chicago... It's not. The food was OK, but in no way warranted the inflated prices so it felt like we were paying more for the ambiance than the meal.  -We began with the Maryland Crab Cakes which at $12 consisted of ONE two inch diameter piece. Fresh crab or not, it wasn't worth it and when it's plural on your menu shouldn't you get more than one?!?!  -The Bamboo Leaf Steamed Kona Kampachi was a brief ray of light (almost), the crab was not properly de-shelled and by the end there were about 12 flaky stowaways stuck to the side of our plate. The fillet was cooked well though, with the crab and lime giving a light flavor that didn't take away from the Kampachi (yellowtail).  The Coconut rice was awesome, thick and slightly sweet. Not sure if they meant the rice to be so thick, technically too much moisture, but I like it that way almost like a porridge. -The Roasted Diver Scallops (With Lobster Tail the night I dined) were excellent, and cooked perfectly... Until they put them in a bowl with the lobster tail allowed its slathering of whipped butter to run down onto them essentially obliterating any of the delicate taste they had. Waiter was pretentious, but lacking the knowledge to back it up. I'm fine if you want to play that role, but if I ask you if anything is particularly fresh that evening, don't tell me it's the steak appetizer. Also, If I call twice for a reservation at a specific time and you tell me there's no need, don't make me wait when I arrive at that time.

For my entree- I had the ahi tuna perfectly grilled rare which was served with some Asian vegetables and a potato gratinee.  Ahh- perfection on a plate!  My friend got a filet and it was absolutely perfectly done and melted in your mouth.  The Parmesan fries that came with that were also quite good.  Hard to believe that a ""fish place"" could do steak so well!

The boy took me here for Date Night this weekend, and it was definitely a 4-star date experience (good service, classy drinks, a table with a view, etc.) -- so why the 3 stars? Well, I'll tell you. 1. The food was good, but I expected much better for the price. It was not as good as I remember the NYC version being. The maki we started out with (California roll and spicy tuna roll) were good, but you could obviously get better at a sushi restaurant for less than the $8 apiece we spent here. For the entree, I had the halibut and he had the salmon, and both were good but nothing to write home about. The sauces they used on each were... interesting. Not bad, but I'm still not quite sure if I really liked either of them. Even the side items were just okay, and they're usually my favorite part of any meal -- I was very excited for the lump crab meat that came with mine, but it came all mixed in with the greens (which normally I would eat, but these were really not good), which made me sad. Even the bread was just OK. 2. The drinks were good, and interesting, but for $11 it should probably make me feel at least a TINY bit tipsy if I haven't had anything to eat since breakfast. It did not. 3. We ordered drinks at the bar and then brought them with us when we were seated, and our waiter didn't put them on our bill.
