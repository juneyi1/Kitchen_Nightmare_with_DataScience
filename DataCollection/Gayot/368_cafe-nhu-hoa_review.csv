2005-08-03,2.0,"This long standing icon of little Vietnam still stands, but I can not tell you why exactly. The menu is standard, the service average, and the decor somewhat cheesy. I have eaten there several times and have always left somewhat disappointed. Still they do have a large customer base and a proven track record of sustainability. My rating is based mostly on their longstanding existence and that they are consistently average, never horrible. It does have the feel of the original Vietnamese restaurants, when the neighborhood first began its much welcomed transformation. I am a sentimental fool and a sucker for nostalgia. Please eat there and tell me... what am I missing? Â Could it be the lowest common denominator? I never cared much for that, not even when wrapped in consistency, which I do hold in high regard.",-0.7902,0.758,0.102,0.141,0.478343685300207
