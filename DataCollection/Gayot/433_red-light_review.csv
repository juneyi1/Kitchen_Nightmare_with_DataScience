Appetizers:  Smaller than expected in quantities.  The chicken wings were well presented, but comparable with most wing shop food.  The paper wrapped tuna rolls were forgettable.  The sesame seed shrimp were really good.   Dinner:  I had the salmon with soba noodles, my friend had the beef curry.  He did not like the beef curry.  I liked my salmon and noodle dish, but it was relatively simple.

Sometimes the bartender is rushed and doesn't fill the it to the point where he/she is allowed. Normally, customer is right and I get a proper pour.)  The waiter was insisting that I was wrong and this was a proper pour. I kept on and he took it to the bartender. The manager finally came over (seriously, put a spit more of wine in my glass and I'll be happy. Is all this really necessary?) He said it was the 6 oz pour, which it wasn't. I brought something up about the customer always being right, etc. and he still argued with me.  At that point I had given up and just wanted to get on to having dinner.

No... because the snarky asshole said, ""we don't normally do this,"" as he dropped it off.  Really???? Then don't do it.

We split the lobster roll appetizer, which weren't very good.  We were deciding between those and the shrimp app, and asked the waiter his opinion.  Perhaps he liked neither or didn't have an opinion, but his answer was 'the lobster rolls are definitely the most popular appetizer.' Which I now realize didn't answer my inquiry. Anyway, the lobster rolls weren't good.  They were mostly just weird - it was like an egg roll, but with lobster and what looked/tasted like mushrooms and served with mango slices and a sweet/sour-ish sauce.  It was like a big plate of WTF.  Now I know what my mom meant when she said being popular isn't everything. We also split the kung pao chicken and the beef curry.  Both were decent - the chicken was spiced well (though not spicy at all) and the curry had a nice flavor.  They give it to you with about 2 ounces of rice, so we had to ask for more, which was weird.  While decent, the entrees were certainly not portioned nor prepared to their listed price - it was something like $20 for the chicken dish and $24 for the curry.  $24 effing dollars for a plate of curry?  Are you serious? Fortunately we had the Swoop, but knowing the price/quality ratio I probably won't be back.  Service was good, but not that good.",0.9917,0.759,0.199,0.042,0.6606493506493507

Ive had better at just about every other place i've ever had an egg roll. To charge $6 is ludicrous. I would pay $6 for an egg roll if it had some flavor but this was just flavor-less. I love pad thai. I've tried it at multiple places in the city and always have to if it is on a menu. Red Light's Pad thai is horrible. They took rice noodles and put them in a smokey bbq sauce i swear. This was not pad Thai, not to mention at $20, it was the most expensive ive ever had and the worst. Supposedly came w shrimp and chicken. I came across maybe a few slivers of chicken.  If you want a good appetizer, try the tempura fries but thats about it.  I almost went to this place twice before but ended up at sushi sai down the street.  Finally went and it just doesnt get any worse or overpriced as red light.

We did make reservations on Open Table and were seated right away.  I noticed the two girls in front of us were told it was a 30 minute wait so glad I made the reservations.  Surprised because it was a Tuesday but we got a table so no issues. My husband and I tend to not order everything at the beginning of the meal so we have a little time to linger and talk.  We ordered drinks and they took awhile.  Once they did get there, yum.  Mai Tai and a Mango Martini, both fantastic.  But probably 15 minutes-ish before we got them.  Then we ordered egg rolls to split and probably should have ordered our entrees too but didn't want them to come out simultaneously.  Unfortunately when we did order entrees, it took a good 35-40 minutes to arrive.  And servers seemed to be disappearing all over the place.  A lot of tables looked like they were waiting for food. Like I said, I think this was a weird night so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt but you'd think if you sold a couple hundred Groupons, you'd probably want to prepare for the last couple days before they expire. I got the Kung Pao chicken and it was spicy!  The guy even said he would make it a little milder and when they delivered the food they said ""Kung Pao mild"" and it was still, wow very spicy.  Good though just wow.  Husband got the Shrimp 99 and he said it was okay but probably wouldn't order it again.  He ate about 1/3 of my dish and said he liked that better.

I love all the fixtures too.  The co-ed bathrooms are very cool and have tall vaulted ceilings. Service:  I've been here a few times and the service is way above average in attentiveness and friendliness.  Food: Vegan and vegetarian friendly! They always ask about dietary restrictions too - which is very considerate.  The Kung Pao is a must try. The texture of the tofu is perfect and the spiciness level is just about right. Add the delicious veggies to the mix and the dish really is perfection.  Other than that, I've tried the potato curry (very sweet but interesting flavors) and the pad see ew (lovely noodles, great smokey flavor). For appetizers - I've tried the eggplant dumplings (surprisingly delicious - even my eggplant-averse husband loved them) and the fried artichokes (trio of dipping sauces - delicious). The portions are just right and I always leave very satisfied. Value: Red Light is in a trendy area and is a little pricey but really not too bad. I think they really get you on the alcohol.

The food was excellent. I like the Asian/Indian combination. I had the  Mee Gha Ti, thin noodles in a coconut curry sauce with chicken. It is definitely a unique taste of Indian/Asian fusion.

Our server was a cool guy with good suggestions, but we couldn't figure out if he was monotone or unhappy with life.  We arrived at 8:30 and had no problem finding street parking, but knowing they had valet was a nice back-up plan. The restaurant itself reminded me a lot of Marche (its sister) and seemed pretty empty which I found surprising for a Saturday night.  Also, the tables were crazy close together which I find annoying...especially with such a large space.  We had to move our table to get in and out of the booth so I wasn't shoving my arse in my fellow patrons' food. I was impressed with almost everything I ate which was: Asian Paella (really fresh and flavorful with lots of yummy seafood and sausage), Mee Gha Ti (thin rice noodles, creamy coconut curry sauce, chicken, cucumbers, roasted coconut, peanuts) that I couldn't get enough of, and the heavens shined down on us when we ordered Jackie's Chocolate Bag.  What's not to adore about a chocolate bag stuffed with white chocolate mousse, fresh berries, and swimming in raspberry sauce...it was incredible.

Service was outstanding.  They were attentive but didn't hover.  And they were extremely courteous.  Great team effort by all the service staff. The layout of this place is similar to that of Marche across the street.  The decor is kind of cool but not quite as cool as Marche.  They do have a nice, long bar here where about 10 people can sit.   The only thing that would keep me from coming back here more than once a year is the price.  It was approximately $100 for the two of us, including two beers and a dessert if you didn't include the Groupon.  If you have two people throwing back wine or drinks you're looking at close to a C-Note and a half when you consider your tip.  So it's a bit pricey.

2010-02-21,4.0,"I went to Red Light last night, and I'm still dreaming about my dinner. The food here is fantastic, though much of it is overpriced in my opinion, which makes it lose a star. I had what sounded like a delicious cocktail to start - the Blood Orange Press (vodka, blood orange juice, fresh lime, ginger, soda). It was good, but definitely not $11 good. On the plus side, it was strong and huge - so much so that I couldn't finish the whole thing and be okay to drive home. On the minus, all the interesting flavors it supposedly contained got sort of lost, so it pretty much tasted like something sweet and fizzy you might get on vacation. For appetizers, we got the Crispy Maine Lobster-Mango Rolls (which were good, but not amazing, and were a small portion for $11), and the Black Tie Sesame Shrimp (which were delicious). The shrimp were presented really nicely, coated in black & white sesame seeds and served with some awesome fruity sauces.  For the main course, I chose the Surf & Turf - hangar steak with wasabi butter and tempura shrimp. Really, you can't get more American than butter on your steak, and I wasn't disappointed by this creation from my adopted home. The wasabi butter brought out some delicious flavors in the steak without being spicy or overpowering. The shrimp were good, but weren't really tempura-battered. Even better than my dinner, though, was my boyfriend's. He had the Mee Gha Ti - thin rice noodles in a fantastic coconut-peanut-curry sauce served with chicken, toasted coconut, chopped peanuts, fresh cucumber, green chiles, and some vinegary vegetables. The sauce was so good that it made this mostly noodley dish worth the $19 price tag. For dessert, we had to try Jackie's Chocolate Bag. We were not disappointed, but what's not to like? It's a ""bag"" of dark chocolate, filled with white chocolate mousse, a ton of strawberries, and garnished with whipped cream and raspberry coulis. Probably one of my top 10 desserts ever. Oh, and don't get one just for yourself - you need at least 2 people to finish it off. All in all, our experience at Red Light was awesome. Our waiter was attentive and answered all our questions, the décor was funky, and the open concept allowed us to watch Chef Jackie run her kitchen. The only minuses were the price (without our Groupon, it would have been $130 including tax, tip, beer, cocktail, coffee, tea...which wouldn't have been quite worth it for us), the tea ($4 for a Mighty Leaf teabag? C'mon), and the uncomfortably close distance between our table and the one beside.",0.9982,0.765,0.207,0.028,0.5558333333333334

We had reservations, of course, but were seated in the front by the door which during a Chicago winter, not too pleasant. They offered to move us, but I was like whatever. What I don't like about this place is how claustrophobic you feel sitting right on top of your neighbor, not my idea of a romantic setting. Oh well. The food, well it was all just eh, nothing horrible, but nothing fantastic, Even the chocolate bag was better a couple of years ago, or maybe my tastes just changed. We got the lobster egg rolls which were eh okay, kinda flavorless, the  mango did not do it for me. The pad thai was a little too sour and too much on the saucy side so also did not do it for me. We decided to try the tempura sweet potato fries and thought that was going to give us both a heart attack, like way over done. We had like a couple and left the rest.

It was good but not worth $17 when I can get the same dish for $8 at any traditional Thai place. I also had two lychee martinis which was good but again, buy a can of lychees at Whole Foods and add some of the syrup and some chilled vodka and you got it at home skipping the $10.  The biggest fault I had was when bringing me my second $10 lychee martini they set the glass on a place on the table where two tables came together creating a dip so when I touched the glass it tilted and spilled a quarter of my drink. The waiter saw this and cleaned it up but did not get me a new drink. That really made me mad bc It was a $10 drink and I didn't even take a sip and it was not my fault the waiter placed it in a bad spot.

Well, the entrée portions were actually smaller so I don't think any reduction actually took place, except in size. We were persuaded to get an appetizer of potstickers.

This is the first time I have ever written a review on yelp as I'm pretty lazy most of the time, but I feel like I owe yelp a true review as I use it so often. In other words, my review is legit. So when my friend first told me the name of this place, Red Light, I was like ""Should i be alarmed, like red alert?"", ""Is this an indication that this place sucks?"", ""Is this a strip club?"". Then I went to the website and checked the menu; ""Chinese Egg Roll"" was first on the menu, semi-alert that this place is a phony like one of those american chinese restaurants with ""sweet and sour pork"" as their specials; scanned through the rest of the menu, ""wrinkled green beans"" why would i want wrinkled green beans?, ""Bokkum Bap"" great a THAI place with a korean dish on it and this place isn't even one bit korean; and then came the ""surf and turf"" need I say more?; TWENTY DOLLAR PAD THAI; ""Asian paella"" oh we might have some Spanish customers besides Koreans, and Chinese, and smurfs so lets put in something in the menu with a slight Spanish twist to it. Went to the restaurant anyway because my friend bought a 50 dollar groupon; great I'll probably have to spend 60 or more on top to what felt like a total scam before even stepping into the restaurant. Showed up to the restaurant, big red lantern on the outside, DOH, the insides were decorated with red and dark brown furniture and wallpaper; now that I think of it, the restaurant felt like a hookah bar but I have to say the deco was pretty decent. First thing that came to mind, I am the only asian person in there. Note for all non-asian people out there, if you step into an asian restaurant without any Asians, GTFO! Sat down, ordered the 1. Ahi Tuna, 2. Classic thai soup 3. Sweet potato fries 4. Emerald prawn curry 5. Duet of Pork 6. Pad thai. 1. The salad that came with the ahi tuna was pretty good, slightly seasoned with a reduction of balsamic vinegar; the tuna was covered with wasabi sauce, can't taste anything but wasabi. 2. I've been to Thailand at least 5 times, I'm not expecting the same quality but it did not taste anything like the classis thai soup. 3. Sweet potato fries was actually the best dish, except a little over seasoned, shake off the salt for 5 seconds and you're good to go. 4. OMG this dish is horrible; Lime with Coconut and shrimp with a huge lump of mushy crap in the middle. 5. Everything on this dish tasted the same, the pork, the salad, the side dish, everything tasted like Chinese hoi sin sauce. 6. Pad thai, they might as well have called this ""Noodles with salt and some fried eggs, oh peanuts too, mehhhhhhh dash of red sauce thingy"", it was so bloody salty I had to drink a cup of water with every bite. All the entrees were 20 or more, the check came up to 110 without tip. NOBODY, I MEAN, NOBODY should pay more than 40 for thai food no matter how good it is. Arun's is another disappointment btw if any of you are planning to visit. Conclusion, I end up spending most of dinner shaking salt off the tasty tasty tempura sweet potato fries.

Loved the Chinese Egg Rolls with the Sweet and Sour Sauce, The Teryiaki hanger steak was awesome, however the Wasabi Mashed Potatoes were a little heavy on the wasabi, so much so I couldn't enjoy.  The Pad Thai and the Seven Treasures were fantastic.  But really, at the end of the day, it was the Chocolate Bag (dark chocolate bag with Belgian white chocolate mousse and fresh berries....) and service that stole the show.

2009-12-29,4.0,"""515 Bonding TIme"".  That's what my old college roomies dub our various get togethers.  Cute, no?   On this cold Sunday night, we decided to visit Red Light (since we tend to disregard West Loop!).  As soon as the (awesome) waiter asked if we wanted 'shots of tequila', I was impressed and knew it was going to be a great experience!  We were also  lucky enough to sit at a 'Chef's Table', which was located in front of the open-kitchen.  Nice view of all the completed entrees coming out!     The decor in Red Light is Asian-esque, but with a modern, vibrant red flair.  It's similiar to what you'd find in Marche or Opera, but with it's own Asian/French fusion style.  And, that's pretty much how you can describe the food!  The lobster/mango spring rolls were tasty and had a unique flavor (although the portion size was a little small for the price).  I ended up ordering the Emerald Jumbo Prawn curry (delicious and spicy!).  Huge pieces of prawn and just the right amount of kick to the curry.  I loved it!  It comes with a side of white rice, but there's actually a mound of sticky rice underneath all the curry.  I mistook it for fish, whoops.  My friend enjoyed the Asian paella (fresh seafood mix with a basmati-esque rice).  Oh, and there was a heaping pound of green beans, which were a little on the sweet side.  Therefore, that was a win in my book. Our other friend took advantage of the $21 sampler platter (salmon papaya salad, shrimp and pesto pasta and coconut sorbet).  A little less Asian influence to her meal, but really good nonetheless.  Not to mention a good deal! As for desserts, that was one of the highlights of the meal.  The 'chocolate bag' they have on the menu is perfection.  It's literally white chocolate mousse and whipped creamed - encompassed by a wall (or a 'bag') of hardened chocolate. Whoever thought of that creation was a genius.     Red Light's manager is ever-so-charming, too.  He checked in with us, joked with us and even sent over some berry pound cake for us to try!  (Tip: It pairs magically with a glass of moscato.)  Lovely, darling service at its finest! So, stop in!  If not for a full meal, indulge in a delicious dessert, lobster roll or a fab drink!  (Red Light Manhattan, what?)  You'll be happy you stopped in, I promise!   (Want a discounted gift certificate to Red LIght?  Check out  3oclockclub.com  and sign up!)",0.9985,0.761,0.221,0.018,0.5341490299823634

This time my college roommate and I headed down at about 7:30 for a Sunday dinner. The place was pretty packed but we only had a 20 minute wait which was spent quite pleasently at the bar where we found two open seats. After ordering two glasses of Cab Sauv ($10/glass) we proceeded to dive into the appetizer menu - mango lobster rolls and pork dumplings (they were out of the fried artichoke we originally ordered). We were seated before the appetizers came out but the host/manager brought them to our table when they came out of the kitchen.  *BONUS MOMENT* - while clearing our tab at the bar, the very handsome bartender tell us that he has a comp account and that he put our wine on there because he wanted to ""thank us for being so patient"" (we didn't really wait all that long, so I'm pretty sure he just thought we were cute).  Score! Service was adaquete, nothing incredibly amazing but she wasn't a total fool either. She earned her 15%, nothing less, nothing more. She did help us narrow down our two dishes, so thumbs up for that. We decided on the diver scallops and the prawn curry. Both amazing (though I preferred the scallops, even though they were a much smaller portion) dishes, however, both overpriced...as is everything I'm finding at these KDK restaurants. They were $26 and $25 resepectively. Our appetizers were equally overprices considering how small the portions were but I would say the hoison sauce on the dumplings were my favorite part of the meal. Or was it the coconut infused rice paddy in the spicy curry? I can't decide... Like Marche, this place has a killer atmosphere and is perfect for date night and girls night out alike. I liked that the executive chef, Jackie Shen, was on the floor plating the food and supervising the kitchen.

2009-11-24,4.0,"When a bartender doesn't have the right ingredients to make the drink you request (a common drink with only two ingredients), switches ingredients, then tries to tell you his is the right way - that's bull. Even when you call him on it and he then provides you free drinks, it still bull. I won't be stopping at Red Light to drink at the bar.  But I will be there to eat! It's clear why this is considered one of Chicago's top pan-Asian restaurants (one of the country's 10 best Asian restaurants, according to Bon Appetit). Chef Jackie Shen clearly deserves all the accolades she's received. We had a fantastic meal.  We both started with the dtom hkaa gai soup - coconut broth, chicken, straw mushrooms, and galangal. Most pan-Asian and all Thai restaurants have a variation of this soup and I love to try each chef's version. This one was very refreshing, light on the coconut side, not too filling. For entrees, my wife went with the fish special and I had the spicy pan seared diver scallops with porcini mushroom polenta. The sauce with the scallops was delightfully spicy - the first bite sets you back a bit, but by the third bite you're use to it. It had a coconut base and gave a terrific Asian taste to the scallops and polenta. A generous serving, I had plenty of time and plenty of forkfulls to enjoy all the different flavors.  We only had one option for dessert. There are multiple choices, but how can we be foodies in Chicago and NOT have had Chef Shen's famous ""Jackie's Chocolate Bag."" It's a ""bag"" made of dark chocolate, filled with Belgian white chocolate mousse and fresh strawberries, with a raspberry sauce. One was enough for the two of us to share. It tastes just as good as it sounds and its fame is well-deserved. We'll probably never find out what any other desserts on the menu are like - this is too good to ever pass up.  The wine list was nice and we had a great Austrian Huber Gruner Veltiner to go with the meal. Service throughout the meal was fine, not exceptional, but fine.

One guy got the Peking Duck - it was 1/2 roasted duck, on top of an orange sauce.  The skin was crispy and all the meat was very moist.  Came with a huge bowl of white rice on the side.

Fried catfish came out about 5-10 min after everything else.  It was HUMONGOUS - I didn't think catfish could get that big!  We only ate 1/2 of it.  It was fried to perfection, the server prepared it for us by removing the meat from the bone and placed it in the sauce.  The skin stayed crispy after being in the sauce after over 5 min.  Meat was soft, yet firm, the sauce was sweet and soury vinegar.   We also got the wrinkled green beans as an appetizer and to get some veggies so we felt healthy.  They were good, it was a HUGE portion, blackened.  They were sweet and kind of had a vinegary flavor.  We all liked Operas green beans better though.   We were celebrating my bday and they gave us a chocolate bag dessert for free, yay!  So yummy, you can't say anything bad about this dessert, except that I get sad when it's all gone.  Wonderful contrast with the which chocolate mousse, tarte berries and sauce, and the dark chocolate bag. Felt like a light dessert even though of course it isn't.   I didn't see the bill, but if you choose the right items (ahem, large portioned items vs small ones), it's a pretty good deal for a nice, romantic evening out with your sign other or a group of close friends.

We also had a (huge!) order of the tempura sweet potato fries which were quite special. (Hopefully, they will still be special tomorrow; because it was way more than two people could finish in one sitting.) I tried my husband's five-spice pork hash, and it was like an explosion of flavor in my mouth. Not too much, but just enough.

It's a single scoop of sorbet, not an entree! The friend I was eating with was allergic to coconut and I only wanted to switch so that she could try my dessert.

The decor of this place is immediately striking - my roommate described it as ""Alice in Wonderland goes to China"". We started out with cocktails, which were positively delicious and not too sweet  - the Mango Martini was particularly excellent. And then we ate the food. Oh the food. Truly some of the best asian food I've had in a while. While I can highly recommend the potato curry, the spicy chicken, and the appetizer hotwings, the highlight of the entire meal was the sweet potato tempura fries with garlic aioli dipping sauce. I think I could eat nothing but those for the rest of my life and be happy. I think next time if I want to eat here on the cheap I might just get those fries and a cocktail at the bar. Desserts almost rivaled the fries for flavor. The signature chocolate bag (which they gave us for free on account of the birthday - really nice) was light, fluffy and flavorful, and the cheesecake with homemade mint ice cream was to die for. The service was fabulous - extremely attentive but also very laid back, and we had a very nice chat with our waiter. To make this place even better, it's fabulous for vegetarians. They have an entire vegetarian menu with 5 or 6 entree options and plenty of appetizers as well.

I think I'd do the sweet potato fries and lobster mango rolls again, but not the artichokes because they were a little blah. The dipping sauces were ok, but the hot one is extremely hot and numbed my tongue! We did the Red Snapper special and it was SO good - I wish we would've gotten 2 of these. We also got the ""Mee Gah Ti"" which is chicken in a coconut curry. I've had this before and it's good, but not great (however, I'm not the biggest coconut fan).  Having been here before - their Kung Pao Chicken is also a no-fail great dish.

The most memorable of these specials was the heirloom tomato salad followed by the soft shell crab entree. I get soft shells every time I see them on a menu and these were great. Other great choices are the Kung Pao chicken, any of the currys and those tasty wrinkled green beans. As you might guess the menu brings the noise and not for the faint of heart.

The lobster mango rolls and steamed dumplings are great starters. The pan-seared scallops with mushroom polenta are deliciously innovative.

The only off-note here for me on a recent visit was the chocolate bag dessert. First, I'd actually asked for the chocolate bavarian mousse cake. Instead of ""chocolate bav"" she heard ""chocolate bag"" and I got that chocolate bag thing with the fresh berries in it. We were there so late in the evening that we were told it was too late to switch out. Not a dealbreaker, but next time I want my mousse cake!

The menu was a little intimidating.  I honestly had no idea what to order, so asked the waitress what the best dish they offered.  Without even a brief hesitation she said that the Pan Seared Diver Scallops.  Fortunately that was what my wife was already going to order.  So asked what the second best dish would be.  She recommended the Shrimp Ninety-Nine, so I went with that.  And to top it off, we got an order of the Tempura Sweet Potato Fries. The scallops were FANTASTIC.  Very flavorful, spiced correctly and the sauce was very tasty.  The shrimp, however, was a bit underwhelming.  It was supposed to be spicy, but it wasn't really at all.  The whole dish was just very bland.  The fries tasted incredible, but the order has WAY too much.  Enough for a party of 4 (at the least). We ended it with the Chocolate Bavarian Mousse Cake for dessert.  Very creamy and tasty.

The bar is beautiful and the murals that adorn the walls give the place a wonderful intimate feel.  I decided I had to try it the minute I noted the separate vegetarian menu. It doesn't seem completely out of order in a pan-Asian restaurant but it is such a rare treat if you're in a moderately upscale restaurant that's not at Green Zebra!  I ventured there as a birthday outing with the entire Chicago portion of my family and it was a delight the entire time. Our table was ready when we arrived, the hostess knew it was my birthday before I even confirmed it with her and our long table was lining the open kitchen, which really delighted my parents! Blazing flames and busy bodies always make for an entertaining meal.  I can't even list everything the nine of us managed to eat but everyone left happy. The artichoke fritters and the eggplant dumplings were delicious. My little brother was extremely happy about his duo of pork, my curry could have been thinned out a little more and maybe a little spicier but the portion could have lasted me through the week! My boyfriend really enjoyed the 'traditional pad thai"" with pork and shrimp and the whole table couldn't get enough of the sweet potato tempura fries!  So maybe Pan Asian food is not your thing. GO FOR DESSERT!! Seriously. I hate that you have to visit a patisserie or bakery or some kind of Berry Chill to get decent dessert in Chicago. When did pastry chefs go out of fashion? Dessert is always good but a restaurant with something I will remember forever is spectacular! I will remember the chocolate bag for the rest of my life!

The staff were all super friendly and helpful.  We had interactions with a few different people and they were all in top form.  Definitely high-end service.  The main server asked us if we had any food allergies or issues before we even said anything.  He said that only two of the vegetarian menu items were not vegan, and both can be made without egg.  He also suggested a good virgin cocktail that was really good.  I forget what it was but it was super tart. The food was excellent.  It was like home-style food taken to a high level.  It reminded me a lot of Saha in San Francisco. The fried artichokes were super light, and reminded me of fish, oddly.  The sauces were all excellent.  The soy was very rich and umami; the passion fruit was tart and bright; and the ""really hot"" sriracha was actually pretty hot. My wife and I split the kung pao tofu and the pas see-you (without egg).  Both were very good and large portions.  You could bring it home and have another meal easy.

Personally, would I have selected Red Light for a full-fledged Chicago knock-my-socks off experience? No. It's not a bad restaurant by any means, but does it highlight the best of the best our fine city has to offer in Asian Fusion type fare? Again, No.  Our group was seated promptly and cocktails quickly gathered in front of us... personally, mine didn't really jive. I ordered the mango martini which literally arrived like a cheap daiquiri. It was icy, blended and sickeningly sweet... I was not impressed... when did martinis veer so far off the tracks by categorically become anything served in a martini glass? My dining companions seemed to enjoy their libations though so for now I'll digress and move on to some apps, all of which tasted good, not great... I'd say the highlight was definitely the crispy Maine lobster roll with a spicy kicker of a Thai mango chili sauce and the vegetarian Vietnamese spring rolls with sweet chili vinaigrette.  Dinner didn't do much to wow me either... ordered the surf and turf (hangar steak, tempura shrimp, wasabi butter, teriyaki sauce) which actually tasted great - and gave many at my table plate envy - but had one slight issue... it looked like.... well.... uh.... er.....ok, I'm just going to say it....  The 'wasabi butter' made it look like someone jizzed on my steak.  How's that for appetizing? Maybe the butter should come on the side? Maybe it shouldn't cum at all if you know what I'm sayin'.

It was however very pretty :) -1: Poor to mediocre Pad Thai.  The $7 order of Pad Thai from Thai Classic delivery is 3 times better than the $20 Pad Thai at Red Light.  The flavor was just off - maybe too much lime and cilantro?  I've had a lot of thai delivery in the US and a fair amount of it in Thailand and this is hands down the worst pad thai I've ever had. I prefer the shelf stable $3.75 Annie Chung Pad Thai from the grocery to this.  I did however really enjoy the sliced cucumbers around the plate :) They were yummy for snacking. Other than the dessert, I didn't hear anyone rave about their food so I'm assuming it means the others had OK dinners, thus my logic for A-OK. PS.

The only thing about the wait staff was that we were constantly repeating ourselves.  Waiter: ""Would you like anything to drink?"" H: "" Sure can I have a mango martini and a glass of water"" Waiter: "" of course"" ten seconds later another waiter: "" would you like anything to drink?"" H: "" ummm...we already ordered our drinks. thanks"" this happened in the beginning with our drinks and then later for dessert. I guess they're being thorough??? (shrug) So why 1 star? the food was pretty bad. we got the ahi tuna app and the panang curry & traditional pad thai for our entree. We're huge mushrooms lovers so we also got a side of the asparagus and shitake mushrooms. the ahi tuna was decent but then it went pretty much downhill from there. the panang curry was AWFUL. not sure what it was but it tasted really weird and unpleasant. i tried and tried to eat it but after a certain point, my stomach refused to try to digest any more. the pad thai was below average and the asparagus and shitake mushrooms were too sweet. not to mention there was a huge plate full of asparagus and maybe 5 pieces of shitake mushrooms. i think red light tried too hard to make each dish really favorful to the point it was too much to take. all their favors were extremes making my dining experience pretty bad.  thank god they have private bathrooms since after dinner i felt sooo nauseous that i actually puked. sorry for the TMI but yup. red light made me puke. I always like to give restaurants a second chance but not sure about this place considering our check came up to over $100 with tax and tip for a party of 2. If I had a gift certificate or something to this place, I be willing to try it again but if not, i wont be wasting my $ on a 1 star meal.

The one thing is, we snacked so much on the Sweet Potato french fries (which are a great thing to start with and share, about 4 of us polished off the huge serving and were sort of stuffed though) that we were too full to eat our entire entrees or even try dessert. Everyone was really happy with their dishes. I had a vegetarian fried rice and while it was tasty, it wasn't totally my favorite dish. The options for vegetarians were fairly limited. I think next time I might order one or two of the ""small plates"" vegetarian options rather than the fried rice. Everyone else loved their food though. And I definitely enjoyed my cocktails! The decor was nice, but the booths were sort of awkward where the padding was placed on the back of the booths didn't really correspond to where i was sitting so if I leaned back at all I'd hit a hard part.  The crowd was a mix. I'd say 80% of the people were 35 and under and there was a table or two of older patrons.

On our most recent visit, he had the catfish, which seemed large enough to feed a family of five.  I'm not complaining though as it tasted great!  Served with mango and sweet and sour sauce it was a flavorful dish.  On the same visit, I had the surf and turf which consisted of wasabi hangar steak and tempura shrimp.  The wasabi hangar steak was delicious and one of the better dishes.  The shrimp tempura on the other hand wasn't as good.  It seemed to be made from a tempura batter instead of using panko bread crumbs, which is another common way to prepare tempura.   Another special treat at Red Light is Jackie's Chocolate Bag.  This is for the chocolate lover in all of us.  Jackie's Chocolate Bag consists of Belgian white chocolate mousse, fresh berries, and raspberry sauce all served in what looks like a little shopping bag made only of milk or dark chocolate.  yum yum yum.   Having been here many times, I have tried a great majority of the dishes at Red Light.  My favorites include the: Black Tie Sesame Shrimp, Wrinkled Green Beans, Panang Beef Curry, the Wasabi Hangar Steak, and the chocolate bag.  Any food I ordered and couldn't finish still tasted good as leftovers.

Forty-five minutes passed and I still didn't have my dish back.  The waitress apologized again and explained that it was against regulations to put the same pork chop on the grill so they had to start the dish over and that was the reason for the delay.  I told her I understood and my fiance and I decided to order dessert while we waited.  I asked her to please box my dish and I would take it to go.  She was still very apologetic and assured me my meal would be taken care of.  Well, I didn't get my dish back until we were long done with our dessert.  When it finally arrived with the bill, I noticed that 1 pork chop had been taken off the bill but there was another pork chop on there.  I thought it was a simple mistake so I called the waitress over to explain that it needed to come off the bill. To my absolute amazement, she said ""yes, the dish that you returned was on the house, but we had to charge you for the other pork chop since the kitchen had to make you a new one.""  I was shocked.  I thought there was no way she was getting this right, so I asked if I could speak to a manager.  Mind you, at this point I had not so much as raised my voice or even been cross at all with the waitress - just utterly confused.  I thought surely the manager will straighten this out.  But as soon as she pointed me out to the manager, I watched him march across the room directly to our table and say ""do you want the pork or not?""  At which point I spurted and tried to explain the situation and he cut me off with ""look do you want it or not?!"" so I just said ""no, not if I have to pay for it"".  He then reached across the table, grabbed my to go box, threw it in a nearby garbage and then walked away from me.  Apparently he would have rather that dish gone to the dogs than to go home with a customer. What a jackass.  And the waitress isn't too bright either if she actually thought she knew what ""on the house"" meant.",-0.7226,0.859,0.068,0.073,0.37881479631479636
2008-11-23,2.0,"A sanitized version of Asian food.  Food was edible but with a weird interpretation and lacked authenticity as if they didn't want to make it too ethnic otherwise, they would lose their clientele. I tend to find that a restaurant like this tend to have really sweet sauces, dressing, and base to compensate on actual flavor. If it wasn't for the $50 gift certificate my friend had given me, I would have been annoyed than just disappointed. If you enjoy Ben Pao, Big Bowl and P.F. Chang's with your own individual portion, you'd probably enjoy this place too. If you like real deal and family style dining, you're better off elsewhere. I ordered the large tom kha gai soup($9). It was very heavy on coconut milk and very light or missing on other essential ingredients like gangal, kaffir lime leaves, mushrooms and lemon grass. They added extra things like yellow and red peppers. It was sweeter than your typical tom kha soup. The beef panang($24) was even odder. The sauce was really red like ketchup rather than rustic orange color. Visually, it was off which was an indication. It tasted as if was supplemented with tomato paste with a hint of curry. I couldn't tell if they added the other integral ingredients of kaffir lime leaves or fish sauce. The sweet potato fries($7) was a huge side to share. It was super salty. I asked the waitress for a redo and she tried to tell me that it was in the batter. I told her there was sea salt sprinkled on it. She redid it for me and it was less salty but she passed it off as sugar sprinkled on it instead - I don't think so. I took most of it home. It was ""juicy"" with oil. I decided to put it in a paper bag to soak up the excess oil. The bag got torn at the bottom from the oil. I also tried the butternut squash soup, cheesecake and calamari salad. It was okay, safe and very Americana. Butternut squash soup and cheesecake was not the best but not the worst. The cheesecake had the outsourced vendor taste. The decor was in the category of Grand Lux Cafe, Cheesecake factory, P.F. Chang's - something that appeals to out of towners, tourist and what is perceived to be upscale Asian decor.

Given the time we had to wait and our vantage point of being able to watch some of the prep work didn't help matters at all - I saw someone pick some food off of the counter with their hands and then put it back on the plate and then take it out to be served....When food did come to our table, all haphazardly spaced, most of it was decent, some of it was great and some of it was school cafeteria bad. The Black Tie Sesame Shrimp coated in black and regular sesame seeds was a standout. But they better had been, since an appetizer of eight medium-sized shrimp costs $17. The crunchy and flavorful morsels were the highlight of the janky evening.  Lobster rolls were all Panda Express-ish, and if you can prove to me that there was actually some - any - actual lobster up in the ones we ate  I will straight up give you a dollar. My daughter got something (not even memorable) that came with what were supposed to be wasabi mashed potatoes, but was instead a cold and flavorless lump of blech.  We sent them back and the waiter came back to tell us that owner/chef Jackie Shen was also unhappy with them and that they wouldn't be served for the rest of the night.  But there was still no comp of that entree, no substitution offered, just nada. Like, now your diner doesn't have a side dish and will still cost more than $20.  Why didn't the waiter just come over and call me a bitch, too?  Because that would have made just about as much sense. And after all of that - the bill? High.  Way too damned high. It has been said before, and it will be said again (especially by me)  but ""fusion"" is just code for ""expensive"". Come here if you are a glutton for ho lights and painfully bad service with a side of yummy shrimp.",-0.9817,0.838,0.056,0.106,0.46863767438235515

I started off with a glass of their reisling, and shared the dumplings and ahi tuna appetizer with my three friends. The dumplings were decent, albeit forgettable, but the ahi tuna was an amazing combination of slightly sweet with a spicy kick tossed in (via wasabi sauce). It. Rocked. Sadly, there wasn't a lot there for four people - so I didn't get the opportunity to enjoy it for long. Luckily my main dish didn't just rock, it pretty much rocked my socks off.

Add in rice and bite-sized potatos (e or no e, I never know), and it was a party in my mouth.

2008-08-02,3.0,"I'm a little skeptical when it comes to pricey Asian fusion, because it just might be another disaster like P.F. Chiangs.  The impetus for me going there was to take up the offer on the $50 gift certificate when you dine in.  So, basically, each person that spends $20 will receive a $50 gift certificate to Marche.  Offer is valid Sun-Thur, during dinner service only.  Also should mention, can only redeem one certificate per table at Marche.             So how do I rate the service, have to say there were lot of highs and lows.  We were seated immediately upon arrival with menus, but the waiter did not greet us for about 5 minutes.  So by the time he came, we already made up our minds on what to order.  But, we had to sit through his 2 min schpeel on the specials.  I didn't want to be rude and interrupt, so we just nodded along for 2 minutes acting like we were interested.  I just prefer to be told before I check out the menu or even better have it w/ the menu w/ prices and all.  So Anh ordered the peking duck ($26) and Amish S ordered the salmon ($24).  They don't have just hanger steak, but rather surf and turf which I got ($28).   Also the waiter wasn't too clear because his exact wordings for Amish was, ""which side would you like to accompany your salmon, green beans or asparagus?""  Normally, I would interpret that as the dish came with a side.  So, we got billed $10 for damn asparagus!  If it was $5 for sides like most restaurants we wouldn't be too bothered, but $10 for asparagus that wasn't even great, c'mon!              Dishes came out about 45 min from the time we were seated.  My surf and turf came out with hanger steak (cooked medium)  topped w/ wasabi butter, 4 pieces of shrimp tempura, and some mixed veggies.  I know hanger steak is known for being flavorful but a bit more tough than other parts.  But, this steak was dry and really chewy.  The waiter asked if the steak was done to my liking and said he would be more than happy to replace it.  I took him up on the offer and asked it to be cooked medium rare.  It was alot better, but still tough and chewy.  Maybe they didn't marinate it long enough for it to break down some of the proteins or the heat wasn't high enough and took too long to cook.  I don't know.  All I know is I have had more tender/juicier hanger steak on several occasions and Five Seasons in Atlanta is a good example.  As for the shrimp ""tempura"" it had great flavor, but I wouldn't really consider it shrimp tempura because that's not really the right batter.   During the course of the meal, the waiter checked up on us, but he was never visible.  I tried Anh and Amish's dishes and they were not bad.            So what's my final take on this restaurant?  Some of the other dishes are not bad, but with a final bill of $115 including tip, I don't think it has a very good price to taste index.  I think you're paying more for decor and presentation.  I liked that the entrance had it's own identity, and also liked the undulating ceilings.  But, with asian mentality, you can eat in Chinatown for 6 including lobster for that price.  I would rate my exp a 2 but have to give it 3 for making the effort of replacing my whole dish.  So, would I ever eat here w/o any incentives?  Sorry Ms. Shen, NEVER EVER,  forever, ever, forever, ever!",0.9858,0.842,0.1,0.057,0.5447680097680098

Only later to find out that the ""side"" I was about to get as part of my meal was actually a separate dish all together and was almost half the cost of my main meal! not happy at all, but the salmon was great! no really i genuinely thought it was really good, I enjoyed it thoroughly and completely forgot about the asparagus, which I finished as well. Hey I was hungry, what would you do? leave it? I don't think so!  Anyways getting back to the food, my friends, Luan N, and Ahn P ordered the surf and turf, and the Peking duck.

They offered Sriracha hot sauce on the side to heat it up for me but that completely changed the original sauce of the dish. They did bring us a huge plate of green beans as an apology for waiting outside unserved. They were the best part of the meal.

The location was satisfactory, giving us a generous panorama of the beautiful decor (to say nothing of the cheesy, thumpy house music), but I found the seat backs against that wall didn't line up with where our table was set, making it all the more uncomfortable and compromising, especially in anticipation of the big ticket. But a cocktail was sure to settle our upset nerves. My wife had a delicious fresh mango smoothie with vodka (house: Ketel), known as the Mango Puree Martini. I enjoyed my Manhattan with Maker's Mark, up. Our server was very attentive and descriptive of much of the menu options. He helped us settle on a couple rolls for appetizers. Their egg roll was sincerely one of the best basic egg rolls I've had - tangy mustard sauce and a nice lychee and sprout salad to accompany. We also had their special vegetarian Vietnamese Spring Rolls which were filled with red and yellow bell peppers with a ""spicy"" (read: vinegar) sauce. The nice sprigs of cilantro garnish helped to balance. For our mains we shared the Amish Chicken Apple Potato Curry and the Miso Glazed Salmon with Green Tea Soba Noodles and Pineapple Sauce. I found that the chicken itself was outstanding, the curry uniquely sweet and spicy, and the dish overall generous in size, if a bit redundant after awhile. The salmon was a bit undercooked (a surprising complaint for fish - especially since we debated about going to neighboring Sushi Wabi instead!). We enjoyed the plate, but found the pineapple sauce overwhelmed the delicate nuances of the noodles and fish. It was topped with a nice chutney of onions and peppers that truly only served for color and little else. The accompanying rice was as basic as rice gets. Another reviewer commented that the wait staff disappeared after the food arrived. We had the same experience. I would have commented on the fish and requested another drink, but alas. On the whole, it's a lovely room, and has a nice date atmosphere - again, we would have enjoyed our date more if our table would have been intended for a proper 2 guests. But if you place a reservation, you'll be well served, but still may not reap the full value of your dollar. When it's all said and done, my big complaint is the cost. Our tab was over $100 for 2 drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 mains.",0.9983,0.751,0.201,0.048,0.5862307886117409
2008-05-08,2.0,"4 stars, really people?  Had the lobster/mango egg-roll. It had negligible lobster and was as exciting as a $3 food court egg-roll.  The mushroom, fruit and onion side salad had an earthy unwashed mushroom taste.  Main courses were dramatically over seasoned w/ minimal Asian connection.  It was probably the most black pepper I've ever seen on one dish.  Ambiance ehh big room with tables tightly packed with fancy wrought iron chairs. Service/Management....  FYI when charging 70+ bucks a head please change out the silverware with each course.  Its like eating at a Chili's, the staff takes your used cutlery off your appetizer plate and puts it on the table for you to recyclr.  Completely unappealing, almost insulting at the prices.",0.7478,0.89,0.084,0.025,0.41686507936507927

2008-03-08,4.0,"For an early Valentine's Day dinner, my S.O. and I decided to use a generous gift certificate we'd received at Christmas to treat ourselves to a nice dinner out. We made reservations for Red Light a week in advance and looked forward to our outing. That Friday night, we decided to ""splurge"" on valet parking (really a good deal for $10) and were immediately welcomed at the front door. With a coat check, and very attentive service, I felt very spoiled... which was just the point, of course! Our waiter, John, was a lot of fun. He was very knowledgeable about the wine list and menu, offering suggestions and inside information about the newest menu items. When we told him we were celebrating Valentine's Day early, he drew a big pink heart on our table (clean, white butcher paper protected the tablecloth) to keep things festive. He checked in on us unobtrusively, which let us truly enjoy our special night. I'm a sucker for sweet potatoes, so the sweet potato tempura fries were a must-eat appetizer, along with some delicious spinach dumplings. We indulged in a nice bottle of Riesling (which was the cheapest bottle on the wine list--and recommended by our waiter!), which was a lovely complement to some of the spicy foods.  For our entrees, we selected the Mee Gha Ti (chicken, rice noodles, chili, and coconut curry sauce with vegetables and ground peanuts) and one of the specials, an Asian take on a very British dish: beef Wellington. I adored my Mee Gha Ti; just the right balance of spices with a savory curry sauce. While my S.O. decided he wasn't a fan of the puff pastry in which the steak was encased, the beef's flavor and tenderness were a big hit. The only negative was that we were seated quite close to the door on a bitterly cold night, which kept me a bit chillier than I would have liked. However, the decor and ambiance were perfect for our romantic little dinner, and I would happily return (as long as someone else is footing the bill)!",0.9959,0.769,0.196,0.034,0.5529761904761904

Even though the restaurant was virtually empty, we were seated in the back room by ourselves, with all other parties filling up the front.  I don't know what message that was supposed to send, but it definitely rubbed us the wrong way.  We were eating with a huddle of waiters to our right the majority of our meal. The food was pretty good.  We had the lobster mango roll to start, which was fairly bland for what was in it.  We then shared the ribeye, which was quite tasty, and the salmon, which was decent.  At one point while dining, we overheard our waiter talking and pointing in our direction, which again came off as pretty shady/unprofessional.

I would order these entrees again in a heartbeat...didn't love the polenta that came with the scallops, but I'm not really a polenta type of gal to begin with. And of course had a side of sweet potato fries (a must!) and a side of green beans too because they looked too good not to order (and they tasted even better than they looked).

I must say, I was actually pleasantly surprised by the food at this place.  I would never ever ever ever pay more than $10 for Chinese/Thai/Asian food.. and definitely not over $30 for any entrees.  Luckily, we came here with a rep, which means it was free.  I typically wouldn't try out a fancy americanized pan-asian restaurant, but given that it's under KDK ownership (same owners as Marche, Opera, Carnivale), I decided to give it a shot.  I was especially turned off when my friend ordered the Kung Pao Chicken.. since I would never ever order a $25+ plate of Kung Pao chicken. We started off with some appetizers - lobster/mango rolls (bland), ahi tuna (pretty good), and dumplings (bleh). For entrees, I ended up getting the diver scallops and it was surprisingly good, despite the price.. My friend's Kung Pao chicken was also suprisingly good, but it was definitely not Kung Pao flavored.   Another person got the duck (with cranberries), which wasn't too bad either.   For drinks, we had the mango martinis which wasn't all that great - tasted like diluted mango slushies, and like no alcohol content.  For dessert, we got the chocolate bag with mousse, strawberries and the coconut/lychee flan.  I really liked the flan..especially with the hint of coconut flavor and lychee on top.

Then she throws a cat at my head and says ""No, seriously. Maybe 'it costs a lot, but they take care of you?' ""  There you have it. Red Light: it's expensive, but you get treated well. Words of wisdom from the birthday girl. So, intially based on a recommendation from Yelpr Michelle M. then confirmed by all of you beautiful people, we went to Red Light last night to mourn the end of my wife's 26th year and welcome the 27th. The decor was nice, a little weird, but still neat. I didn't get the sultry thing that some people were mentioning. We were supposed to do the mini-chef's tasting - 5 courses, $50/person. But when we got there, they said they don't do a mini tasting. Okay, well, someone needs to tell the chick answering the phones then. No biggie, we went with the full tasting. Everything was presented with such care and delight. We definitely ate with our eyes first.  Here's what we had: Everyone got two pieces of flash seared ahi tuna with a sweet soy sauce and a mild wasabi sauce. The tuna was a tasty appetizer. It was firm and flavorful. Next were the steamed foie-gras & pork dumplings, set in a cognac hoisin sauce. More delicious-ness. These were good, but after four straight hours of eating, they don't stand out. After that was the roll course. We each got half of a crispy maine lobster-mango roll, a shrimp & beef vietnamese spring roll & a chinese egg roll. The lobster mango roll was my favorite. The mango worked so well with the lobster. jackie Shen herself brought these out. Next they brought out the Shrimp & Pad Thai. The Black tie sesame shrimp was coated in black sesame seeds and served with a passion fruit chili sauce. The kung pao shrimp worked well with the pad thai which wasn't too spicy and was loaded with shrimp on its own. A few courses in and we're starting to fill up. A few glasses of wine and we're starting to slow down. Little do we realize we're in for a gastonomic work-out. Okay, back to the food. The bbq course came next. Five spice salt ribs & peking duck. On separate plates, obviously. The ribs were something I wanted to try, and was a little dissappointed by. But, we're still talking about varying degrees of incredible here. The ribs were coated in a spice rub that really gave them a lot of flavor. Nothing like the usual grease & fat-fest that define chinese ribs. The duck was spectacular. The host mentioned something about it being put in a citrus bath first to cure off the usual excess fat. I liked it, because I usually find Peking duck to be too fatty. This let you really taste the duck meat, while still enjoying the crispy skin. It was served over a plate of cranberries swimming in a delicious orange ginger cranberry sauce. They give you time to rest between courses, but it's never enough. The problem is that the food is so amazing, you can't help but eat until the point of pain. At least we couldn't. It was seriously that good. Okay, now we're suffering. We saw a few waiters carry out a whole catfish and our busboy nods & says ""Don't worry, that's coming out next."" Part of us is excited, part of us just wants it to end! Please stop, we can't take anymore gourmet food! But, then it comes. The Crispy Shanghai style Whole Catfish. They take a little liberty with the word 'whole' because the head is no where to be seen, but we were all fine with that. The catfish came out with a massive plate of wrinkled green beans & stir-fried beef tenderloin with mushrooms & scallions. I'm getting hungry & full again just writing this. Okay, I'll start with the catfish. It was amazing. The host carved it at the table for us and the presentation was just as good as the meat itself. The skin was cripsy & the flesh was moist & firm. I really enjoyed the tenderloin. It was seared, then allowed to rest, then sliced thin and stir fried with cremini & shitaki mushrooms & thick scallions. Everything had an incredible bite to it. Thankfully, after 4 hours, that was the last of the food. Nope, there was still dessert. Of course we make room for dessert. They brought out a coconut-banana cream pie, a Berrry Marscapone tart & Jackie's Chocolate Bag. Bag? Yes, Bag. That thing was a tower of chocolate will with berries and belgian white chocolate mousse and fresh rasperry sauce. The other desserts were incredible too, but when you're staring down a six-inch tall tower of chocolate nothing else comes close. So, that's it.

2006-08-17,2.0,"I'm not the biggest fan of these ""fusion"" places, but I have been known to enjoy them. The Service was ok overall, but I suspect our waiter was using a fake accent. 3 minutes after we ordered our appetizers they were on the table. Some would say, ""That's great service."" I would say they were reheating prepared food. Anyways, the lobster and mango rolls were good, but not great. The Ahi Tuna was bland, but OK. For the main course I made the mistake of having the steak special. Why did I order steak at an Asian fusion restaurant? The only answer I can give is that I love steak prepared with oyster sauce. 5 minutes after I ordered the main course the plate came out. Again a suspicion of reheating arose inside of me. This dish was a glorified version of cheap Chinese style beef and broccoli, but with no broccoli to enjoy. It was very disappointing at a price of $35. Avoid at all costs.",0.9812,0.642,0.236,0.122,0.546390977443609
2006-08-04,5.0,"YUM-my. I first went here with my parents several years ago. I had no idea what I ordered, but it was good. I ventured back this year, and have been going quite regularly. The lunch and dinner menus are quite different, but anything you choose is amazing. I had the most amazing cocktail...the name escapes me, but its mango martini something-or-other. Be sure to get the green beans as a side dish and the chocolate bag for dessert! P.S. The ambiance makes it a great date spot.",0.9783,0.734,0.25,0.016,0.4874287749287749

2006-05-22,4.0,"I love this place since the food supports the price.  I compare this place with other Kleiner restaurants and it's up there right below Carnivale.  The dishes are a lot more clever than Marche or Opera.  We ate like it was going out of style, but still left some room for dessert.  Order the fish of the day if they cook it crusted... damn good.",0.7612,0.782,0.169,0.05,0.4920068027210885
2006-04-25,4.0,"red light exudes a level of class not often associated with the common use of its name. the lighting is subtle, the design materials warm but clean, and the mood, well... red. it is not uncommon to find tables of suited and gowned groups, and to be treated with respect. the open kitchen serves surprising combinations of asian ingredients with an american spin. the flavor and presentation are often worth the price. the service was excellent. special inquiries from my vegan friend were honored with ample information. i would encourage making a reservation and taking a classy date.",0.9915,0.672,0.328,0.0,0.4732142857142857

2005-08-25,4.0,This is a good special occasion place.  I think the food is really good and the ambiance is awesome but it gets pretty crowded which is annoying because its not too big inside and can get cramped.  Prety pricey though so I probably won't go back for a long time!,0.8096,0.709,0.228,0.063,0.5746031746031747
2005-07-20,2.0,"Why doesnt this have the street address listed? Oh well. I think its cool this place has an asian woman exec chef  - Jackie Shen. We saw her overseeing the open kitchen. Bad thing is, we had party of 8 and they made my parents wait at the bar til the entire party was here to be seated. Later, they seated another party when they were still missing people. UNFAIR. The food was good but overpriced I think. And I guess for asian people to eat there, we expect MORE RICE. I mean, my miso glazed salmon didnt taste like miso. Presentation was very pretty though. Nice ambience.",0.8626,0.76,0.165,0.075,0.5199404761904762
