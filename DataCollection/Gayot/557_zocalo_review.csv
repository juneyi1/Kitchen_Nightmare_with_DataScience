2014-11-01,2.0,"Okay...here goes. I had heard great reviews about this place (from Yelp and friends). So needless to say, I was expecting way more than what I experienced. I went there on a Tuesday for dinner. Upon arriving...I think I counted 10 people in the restaurant (three of which worked there). Music in the background was putting me to sleep within 5 minutes. A bit confused about all the fuss I'd heard about this place.  However, I gave this place my full attention throughout my dining experience with hope that it will come back a rock star. But I think the only semi-rock star was our waiter. While he was quite the pushy gentleman, I will say he knew the menu like the back of his hand. He described how the dishes were cooked as if he was the one that was preparing them in the kitchen. He took his time describing everything. Literally.  For an appetizer (and being the typical Mexican) we ordered the Trio de Guacamole. I was very disappointed. It was not fresh and I could tell it was prepared in the earlier part of the day. The original guac needed more salt and lime. The guac with fruit...was pretty disgusting. On this particular day they added strawberries to the mix. The guava and strawberries were old and very mushy. Extremely bad texture. Lets just say..that one went untouched. The 3rd guac..was literally just the original guac but with a bit of salsa on top. I guess you could say I liked that one better since the salsa gave it a bit more flavor. The malanga chips...not that great. I'll stick to the typical corn chips. For dinner I had the Mole Mancha Manteles. Grilled pork tenderloin with a Oaxacan mole, a side of white rice and plantains. I heard great things about this place but was quite disappointed with my experience.",0.9618,0.834,0.112,0.054,0.5583333333333333

2013-07-23,5.0,"Decided to try Zocalo last night before a concert since it is nearby my work. What caught my attention was I noticed their Monday night specials ($5 margaritas - sold!) We got there and it was very upscale and not your typical loud, vibrant color scheme - which was very nice! They had big comfy booths, and the waitstaff was pretty good, nothing over the top though. The menu was small compared to other Mexican restaurants, but everything sounded great. First off, I got the house margarita and my friend got the mango margarita. The mango one a little too heavy and sugary but it was still good. The house margarita was AMAZING - light, fresh and absolutely delicious! Then, for an appetizer we got the salsa mix and wow, those were so good! It came with three different types of salsa, two of them were pretty spicy and the third was a mild but different tasting salsa - and the chips were also very delectable. Also, at this time I tried the sangria - also delicious! For our meal we shared the tacos (can't remember the exact name) but it came with three different types of meat. We weren't wanting to eat a lot before the concert, but this was hands down the best mexican food i think I have ever had. All three of the meat choices were cooked to prefection. The taste and the looks of the entree was perfect. I am not a big meat person, usually just stick to chicken but I loved them all! There was also a lot of meat, I think we originally only got 4 tortillas for the meal but we then asked for more and I think the meat ended up making about 8 or 9 tacos total. OH, and the tortillas were home made!! I will definitely be going back here! I think I also saw on their website that on Sundays and Mondays you get a free appetizer and dessert with the purchase of two entrees! Definitely check this place out!

Once we were seated, we found out they no longer served Elotes (our favorite/one of the reasons we came) and were disappointed. BF ordered the taco trio; this was good.  I ordered the Tamal, which was a mistake. It was extremely lackluster.

They have a unique menu that serves your mexican faves with an upgraded flair. I think it's a great date place as well as good for groups.

It seems as though the company may be revamping their brand, which includes changing the name of the restaurant (now it's officially Zocalo D.F.) and also the menu. The change in the menu was the biggest bummer as there are only a handful of selections on the menu now, most of which include the same ingredients and most of which are pretty fancy. I just wanted your typical good mexican food...nothing too fancy or gourmet...but it was hard to find on the new menu. I finally settled on enchiladas (which were good) and my husband got tacos. For the most part, those were the only two entrees under $22 and the only on the menu that was the mexican food we were craving. I'm sure the other dishes were great, too...but they almost all included duck and had fancy culinary words I didn't know. Pros: The service was great. We made a reservation and our table was ready for us right away. Our server was very nice and helpful and the guy who refilled our water was on it...as our food was very spicy (I'm not kidding, every kind of meat was extremely spicy). Atmosphere is great, margaritas are awesome (especially on Mondays...$5) Cons: As mentioned, the new menu...the price, and the spiciness of the food.

The adobada was probably my favorite - it was garnished with diced onions and cilantro on a homemade tortilla. Delicious! I was disappointed in myself that I became full with the four tacos that I could not eat more (although I did order two extra ones with the intent of taking them home...).

I understand these situations happen. There are proper ways of dealing with these situations and there are just absurd and idiotic ways of doing things. Let me begin by  telling prior to the incident we were waiting 45-50 min for our entree. My wife  noticed and was curious as to why the table next to us received their entree before us. I recall our order was placed well before theirs. I assumed maybe our dish was a little more complex to prepare. Needless to say that was not the case.  As we watched whilst the table next to us curiously inspected their food and their bewilderment that occasionally follows a mistaken order, we were beginning to wonder if the server understood his mistake. At this point we watched politely as to their inspection and the layout and detail of the entree. Our biggest concern was would they do the polite thing and tell us they mistakenly served our dish to another and quickly prepare us the same order or would they try to reserve us the entree maybe saving a couple of dollars for ingredient costs. Needless to say they chose to insult our intelligence by choosing the latter.  What was completely amazing was the level of complicity by all (servers, waiters, and back manager). The audacity of our waiter was most sordid. Did he not know that we would be most discerning after witnessing the other patron inspecting and rearranging the entree. An honest attempt to dress up an entree would've been at the very least prudent. Yet there it was a visual ""foutre vous"", an actual thumbprint on the exterior ring of the entree was the last straw.  When we notified the waiter of his mistake he offered no explanation, just shocked that we were cognizant enough to figure out their ruse. Curious as to a management explanation as to what transpired, the back manager response was just as disappointing. After waiting what would be an hour for our entree and enduring the insult of trying to be served an entree that another patron fondled with, the insolent manager only uttered ""have a nice evening"".   No attempt to appease our discomfort  and displeasure was considered. In fact an apology would've done wonders.",-0.9644,0.819,0.07,0.11,0.49851351351351353

From having a casual mid-week dinner here to a bachelorette party with your favorite girls, it's great for a variety of occasions. Here's why it keeps me coming back: Atmosphere Spacious, lofty and dark. Love their décor - from the traditional star lamps to them using empty tequila bottles as décor - very pretty & green! Huge, stunning bar. Eats We like to start things off with the Trio de Guacamole. It's a flight of 3 types of guacamole: traditional, rojo (red), and fruta (fruit). My favorite is the rojo which is topped with red roasted jalapeno salsa, a great way to spice up guacamole. Corn, plantain and malanga chips pair really well with the 3 types of guacamole , yum! The tacos de cazuela are a must-try. In a city where there are so many Mexican restaurants it is hard to stand out, these are probably on my top favorite Mexican of all time. You get to choose 3 types of meats, my go-to's are: barbacoa, cochinita pibil, and tinga de pollo.  The meats are succulent, flavorful and tender. The portions are generous.  Two salsas - one green, tomatillo-based salsa and a red one are served on the side - both excellent! And the best part, warm, home-made corn tortillas! It makes me feel like I'm in Mexico again.  For dessert, I like to stick to the the churros and champurado. The portion is pretty small;  there are 4 small churro halves and a tiny serving of champurrado (about half the size of a tea cup). For $7, I guess you'd expect more, but nonetheless the tiny portions are excellent - the churros are fresh, warm, and sprinkled with cinnamon and sugar and the champurrado is rich and creamy topped with a rich whipped cream. Drinks Zocalo has really tasty sangria and solid margaritas - you can't really go wrong with those. They have specials every day of the week.

On a side note - I saw some kind of tasting going on with a large group.  It really looked like a great time.  There was food sampling as well as some sort of announcer explaining what they were eating.  Just an idea if you are looking for a get together.,0.9669,0.851,0.149,0.0,0.5791125541125542

For my entree I got the shrimp entree and it was just SO delicious!  There were 7 or so jumbo shrimps sitting on flavorful garlic rice and spinach!  I was so happy!  My fiance got the chicken enchiladas which were also very good and his sister got the steak tacos which were also SO good!  Everything was extremely flavorful and just how I like my Mexican food!,0.9951,0.703,0.278,0.019,0.6359259259259258
2012-04-21,3.0,Loved the decor and ambience however the food was not impressive. Guac trio was definitely delightful. It is one of those dishes you can just dig in and enjoy a conversation while eating it. Loved the mango and spicy guacamole. Subtle and refreshing twist. Tilapia tacos - pretty fresh fish but there's something lacking... Can't really put my finger on it but I just felt that I could get something of the same quality at a divey Mexican joint. Grilled steak tacos - they are pretty good but again taste too high end. I think the beauty of tacos is that the ingredients are thrown together and they just have their own chemistry. These feel like they are carefully placed together and there is nothing (a sauce or a spice) that ties them together.  Tinga Poblana - chipotle marinated grilled chicken - this was pretty good. Not wowing though. The Zocalo margarita was pretty tasty however I did not like the Mango Passion margarita that much - it was a bit too tangy and bitter. They gave our birthday girl a complementary flan though (upon my request) so that was very sweet of them. It was pretty light and the presentation was lovely.  Would be a good place for girls night and dates.,0.997,0.682,0.296,0.022,0.7039285714285713

Started with his suggestions of a margarita and Modelo special. Followed p with more suggestions of guacamole and salsa and chips, ( not your regular TexMex chips-these were the BEST). We had the chicken Tinga Poplamo-which equals yummy. Jeffery recommended the skirt steak for me. I was skeptical but tried it. Wow was this a home run. Now I would recommend the skirt steak too. We finished with a chocolate cake which the right size to share and again a home run recommendation from Jeffery. Because of such a good experience at Zocalo and our server Jeffery, I highly recommend this Mexican restaurant. The tequila is a good option if you like this taste which I do.

We shared the guacamole trio which was awesome. The pitcher of Margarita was tasty too. Beware if 3 or more people are having Margarita's this is the best deal or it's a rip off for a glass. That's where the fun end. Our tacos were not good at all. We all agreed they were extremely salty. This is my 2nd time here & the first time my food was average but the guacamole convinced me to give this place another try.  This place was featured on Check Please & they all agreed waiters & waitresses were lacking. I agree too. They need to hire more people.  Go here only if you enjoy great drinks & appetizers.

Anyhow, the guacamole comes with 3 flavors:  regular, spicey, and fruit guac. The regular one was delicioussssss and it was made so well!  Then I ordered the ceviche tasting since it was recommended by Yelpers.. and I was thoroughly disappointed. The ceviche flavors were so overpowering you didn't get to enjoy the seafood.

SO, we go on Yelp, we find Zocalo.  It's within walking distance, which is important because its FREEZING, and has 3.5 stars for only two $$, which sounds fair enough.   We were really surprised by what we found.  Yelpers, why only 3.5 stars for this place???   We were incredibly surprised upon walking in to find how lovely the atmosphere was.  Beautitul entrance, dimmed lighting, upscale decor...if I lived in Chicago I'd say I would've been on at least a few first dates here - and in fact it looked like some people were.   The food was great.  If you like guac, then you MUST try the guac flight as an app.  They are creative and tasty, and the chips are top notch.  The service was good too, although it took our pal Jesus 20 min into the meal to warn us that it may be spicy... hrm.  Bad timing dude, but its okay since we like spicy!  The prices are definitely not bad either for the location in River North, atmosphere, and service. About $50 for two with a split app, dinners, and a marg. Overall, great place for Mexican downtown!",0.9925,0.746,0.195,0.058,0.5188246097337006
2012-02-24,4.0,"I'd been wanting to try Zocalo since seeing it on Check, Please! a few months ago. My aunt's visit to Chicago provided the perfect opportunity. Zocalo met all of my criteria: a laid back, semi-inexpensive River North resto that wouldn't scare her off. While Zocalo turned out to a pricey endeavor, the food was solid and we had a great time.  We spent about $180 with tip on the following: the guac trio plus salsa, ceviche, empanadas, crab cake, fish tacos, the apple crepes, three glasses of wine, two margaritas and a beer. Granted we got drinks, but, as others have mentioned, the portions were a bit small for the price. Luckily, everything tasted great. Loved the guac trio and salsa! Let's face it, I could live off this stuff if I had to, and happily. Good chips. I wish they'd skip the other stuff in the chip basket (plantains and something else) and just give you all chips.  The empanadas were my favorite, followed closely by the crab cakes. Splitting three appetizer-sized items was about right for two people, plus we had room for the guac and apple crepes. The crepes were really unique and came with dulce de leche ice cream. Yums.  Loved the house margie. Possibly my fav margie of all time (though they forgot the salt, gasp!). I'd opt for the Zocalo flight. Husband got it and it was fun to try the three different drinks. The margie is one of them, so you can get a taste of that bad boy.  Our server was great. No complaints. The meal was paced really well and we weren't left waiting around for anything. I was a bit bummed there was no live music the night we went but I didn't bother to check ahead or anything so it's my own fault.

My entree was the special of the day - a seafood stuffed pepper.  It was definitely good, but not amazing.  To be fair, had I have ordered my husband's dish - the carne asada with this amazing spicy pepper slaw and black beans - I may have upped it to 4 stars.  His was the winner by far.

Our server was very nice and greeted us promptly We each got a drink (a mango marg and I had their sangria).  For $9 and $8 (respectively), they were good---taste was great, not strong, but not weak either.

They don't even have it listed on the menu, yet I asked our server and he brought us some for $4. The chips were great, and the salas phenom! They bring you 3, one being a creamy-ish habanero, second a mildy spicy traditional salsa, and third being a mild green chile salsa. Deffinetly worth the $4.  For entrees, my girlfriend got the shredded chicken enchilads. Very good, flavorful, and quality chicken. I got the adobo and chipotle marinated chicken breast. It came with two medium sized breasts, cooked perfectly on the grill, and was actually spicy! Extremely good. Was served with some sort of polenta, also good.

The Enchiladas Suizas de Pollo are very good - I have ordered them both times that I've been here, although I always add a side of jalapenos because I like my mexican food a little spicer than they serve it here.

I ordered the Friday lunch box special, which included enchiladas, a margarita and a dessert. The enchiladas arrive, and two bites in, I feel that all-too-telling tingly sensation in my lips and throat. I immediately flag the waitress down and ask if anything in the dish has peanuts in it, and she admits that yes, the sauce did. She gave me a new plate quickly, sans the sauce, and asked if I was okay. Since I caught it early, I was a little uncomfortable but ultimately fine. Then she brought out the dessert - yet another thing that was loaded with nuts!  I eat out frequently, and this is the first time I've ever had an issue with a restaurant being less-than-transparent about peanuts in the food. It's their loss, ultimately - it's only a matter of time before someone with an intense allergy takes one bite and goes into shock. At that point, a dissatisfied customer like me will be the least of their worries - they'll be slapped with a big lawsuit instead. For those not allergic to anything, it's still worth noting that the lunch service was very slow.

2011-08-05,2.0,"Ok, more like 2.5. But before even stepping foot into Zocalo, I assumed it would be overpriced, Americanized, and completely unremarkable ""upscale"" Mexican food. And it completely lived up to my expectations.  First impressions are important to me, and Zocalo failed there. We walked in, party of 2, on a Tuesday night at 7:30pm. Plenty of empty tables. When we said we didn't have a reservation, we were told we would have to wait for a bit. Ok, I get it--you need to check server coverage, etc. But we waited. And waited. And the restaurant was DEAD. We were about ready to leave when, after 20 mins, they finally paid attention to us again. Note to self: Make a reservation, even if its dead. Apparently they don't understand how to handle walk-ins. Once seated, we started with the guac. The trio was good, and the variety of chips is a nice touch, but, I had a hard time tasting the difference between the three guacs. One was spicy? Really?  I decided to go with tacos & tequila for the main course (hell, anytime I can get a free shot with my meal, I'll take it), and he went with some form of enchiladas. And...bleh. There was something sour tasting about the tacos, not going to lie. I was starving, so I ate, but something tasted a bit off. Enchiladas faired better, but still not outstanding. Entirely underwhelming, especially when tacos and enchiladas are $15-16/plate, and chips and guac are ~$10. Add in a few $10 vodka sodas, and this place adds up quickly. Too quickly for the quality. The coolest part about this place is probably the interior--totally unexpected and different than what you would expect, but in a good way. I was digging the whole ambiance. Sadly, that doesn't make up for the whole mediocrity of everything else.  [Side note: I did come here with a Groupon and was wary because I had read other people had poor experiences with their Groupons. Our server didn't bat an eye, and was extremely gracious, so we left her a big tip.

Found super secret parking spots around the corner. I've read good and bad things about Zocalo but for my experience it wasn't half bad. I agree it get's very loud in there and thank god we left just as the band was about to go on. Though I love live music, I can't imagine trying to take a date here for any sort of conversation. I also agree that the service is a bit slow but to be fair it was packed and in my opinion they were doing the best that they could. I'm pretty sure the busboy got stuck being our waiter. He spoke broken English and my date and I filled in the rest with broken Spanish. It all worked out fine. I understand the kitchen was trying to fire out as much as possible but again in my opinion you loose some of the flavor when you're moving that fast.  Mojitos -I think Mr. Ralphy Pants has ruined all Mojitos for me. None can compare to his.  Trio Guacamole- Was I guess, interesting!? Adding very cold mango and papaya to combat the habanero didn't necessarily flip my taste buds but was a interesting concept. Then a regular guac and a spicy guac consisting of Sriracha. Though I applaud the simpleness, it's just adding Sriracha. Though I will give credit to eating it all with sweet plantain and malanga chips... Brilliant!! Ceviche Playero- Citrus cured Tilapia with tomatoes, cilantro, red onion, roasted red pepper, orange, and avocado. It was very refreshing, I could have eaten a buckets worth. Fajitas Zocalo- Marinated chicken or steak with onion, red and green bell peppers, Mexican rice, and black beans. Guaranteed this was a gringo choice of a meal but in my defense I don't eat meat (meaning anything with four legs) and I was sharing my dish with another non meat eater. It was about as good as Chili's or Pepe's. Some of the chicken had too much spice and some had none (hence going too fast in the kitchen).  Overall it's 3.5 kind of place that is IF you find parking.

I came here with a restaurant-dot-com coupon this visit and felt jipped somehow when I left. I've been here quite a few times before without any type of coupon, and felt I might have paid more because I had the coupon. I don't like practices like that. If you want to tack on all types of charges for using a coupon, just don't accept it then.  I tried a different entree, Enchiladas Suizas de Pollo, for the first time and didn't care too much for it. I wanted to get what I usually got once I tried it, but unlike my friend who got the Alambres al Pastor who didn't like hers either, I didn't send it back. I gotta admit, the menu said that the pork in her dish was grilled which made you think they placed the meat on the grill the way you would steaks. However, it was grilled on a skewer and just too pink towards the center for it to be pork.  I still liked the Queso Fundido and chips & salsa for the table. My horchata martini was very different from the other times I got it though. It was made with rum instead of vodka, and much more sweet. I liked it, but it wasn't the same. I'm sure my usual, Tacos de Pescada, is still great, but if I can only get one dish at a place. . . that isn't really a good thing.   I mentioned in my first review that the dessert menu didn't entice me at all. Well, since we had to so order $50 minimum of food to use our coupon (which didn't include drinks) and were $7 short, we begrudgingly got dessert. The only thing that I felt I may like was this choice of some type of cheesecake and fresh fruit. They didn't have any of the cheesecake ready and it wouldn't be ready for hours. It was like 3:30pm. That was just ridiculous. Was forced to the get the apple thing in crepes which came cold, not sure if it was supposed to be served cold, and the crepes were rubbery.   The thing with the coupon, the dislike of the two dishes, and the changing of my horchata martini has turned me off to this place.

It's served with corn chips, malanga chips, and my favorite the sweet plantain chips (can't get enough of those! YUM). Main dish--pollo en mole poblano (grilled chicken served with rice and vegetables)--holy mole, it was good. I still think this place is a little bit overpriced for standard Mexican fare.

Will definitely be back again for those fantastic margaritas and guacamole!",0.992,0.726,0.268,0.007,0.5706666666666667

2010-03-20,4.0,"My bf and I had a $25  restaurant.com  certificate to use for this place. We had 6:30pm reservations on a Friday night and were promptly seated upon arrival. The atmosphere was nice, not too loud but not awkwardly quiet. By about 7:30, the place was getting pretty full. The service was pretty good, our waitress was mostly attentive but didn't take our dinner orders until we waved her down. We had ordered appetizers and were eating them so I guess maybe she was waiting until we were done? We had the guacamole trio and the ceviche of the day. Both were served with their tortilla, veggie and banana chips which are AMAZING. They were not greasy at all!! I am super picky about fried foods - I hardly ever eat them but these were really light and crispy. For dinner I had the chicken with mole. I'm picky with mole sauce and ordered it on the side. I'm glad I did because I didn't like it. There was nothing special about it. My bf got the tacos, pork and lamb. The lamb ones were much better. Oh and drinks: I got the white sangria which was awesome. He got the zocalo flight to start and then stuck with the margarita (in the flight) for his second drink. All the drinks were really good. I also added pictures.",0.9919,0.787,0.182,0.032,0.6619992441421012
2009-12-25,4.0,"Somewhat underrated, hip, stylish Mexican restaurant downtown - that's Zocalo.  GOOD: The service wasn't bad. The bathrooms were pretty clean. I REALLY enjoyed my tinga (spicy chicken). It wasn't that spicy, and I thought the green sauce around it was green chile salsa, but nooo. It was avocado cream, and it was a much better choice, since it offset the chicken in terms of both spice and texture. The entire dish came together very well, and the quality was apparent. BAD: The tinga could've been a bit spicier for my tastes. :( It's all good, though, since it was still very tasty.",0.8379,0.735,0.183,0.082,0.605701754385965
2009-12-21,4.0,"This is some of the best Mexican food I've ever had. It was clearly gourmet and was not only very flavorful, but they took traditional dishes and really made them stand out. Good and quick service, and a warm atmosphere.  The empanada appetizer was good, the Tinga Poblana was excellent. It had a creamy green sauce, a flavorful mole on the chicken, and a contrasting slightly spicy beef mixture underneath. A great variety of flavors!",0.9788,0.712,0.288,0.0,0.5249999999999999
2009-10-25,3.0,"Wait a minute - a Mexican restaurant that doesn't serve chips and salsa for dinner?!  This can't be right. But it is, folks.  Unless the server just completely forgot to bring us, and the surrounding tables, this dinner staple.  Not a great first impression for a Mexican restaurant! That being said, I can't say I am completely sold on this place.  The lighting is super dim - to the effect of wearing sunglasses at night.  The margaritas were pretty tasty but disappointing because I wasn't really feeling a buzz after having two.  The queso fundido was about 10% queso, 10% chorizo, and 80% poblano pepper and probably my least favorite choice of the night.  My entree, the tacos de cazuela (I chose duck, chicken, and barbacoa), came in the form of 4 bowls filled with meats and black beans and a side of 6 blue corn tortillas that I had to build MYSELF!  I certainly wasn't expecting the ""fun"" of building my own meal and the tortillas were SO small that I hadn't even eaten half of my meal before I ran out.  Nothing like eating three bowls of shredded meat for dinner!   To their credit, the meal tasted great and I could have eaten the barbacoa all night! The price wasn't too bad and having a coupon didn't hurt, either.  I don't think I would go out of my way to hit this place up again.",0.9725,0.829,0.133,0.038,0.5209523809523808
2009-02-28,5.0,"When I give a five star review, the restaurant need not be the priciest, hippest or trendiest. It's about the business accomplishing the perfect balance of  well-prepared food/beverage, professional* service, unique decor, and value.  Zocalo accomplished this during my experience. We were greeted and seat promptly. We wanted to start out with some sipping tequila and our waiter was extremely knowledgeable on their 40+ tequila list. Later on during the meal I ordered the strawberry-jalapeno margarita - amazing. I highly recommend the black bean and plantain empanadas. It is the perfect balance of spicy and sweet. Eat it with their spicy salsa. For my meal, I got the filet which was a steal for $18. Of course it was not as tender and juicy as you would find at Gibson's, Mortons etc. but it came with an excellent chipotle sauce. The sides that came with were perfect - a tostada with a thick slab of slightly burned cheese and sauteed spinach. They had several staff members delivering food, clearing plates, and replenishing water and chips 'n' salsa. I was there with friends but it is a great date place as well. It is a little too dark for me as I had trouble reading the menu but obviously I ordered the right items! *Professional service is polite, knowledgeable, prompt and accommodating.",0.9854,0.81,0.166,0.024,0.5543788819875777
