As an added bonus, you could still order al a carte if that's your thing. My wife and I opted for the escargot and tartare for our starters. She had the dover sole and I had the duck. We ended with the cheese plate and the buche de noel (chocolate cake).  The starters were great, although I personally like my escargot in the shells still. That way, you have a better sense that they are fresh (yes, I know they remove them from the shells and then put the shells back in with the meat), and there is usually less butter/garlic mixture. The result of no shells made it much to ""oily"" for my taste. The tartare was excellent. Her fish was lovely, but my duck lacked a bit. It was a bit to ""ducky"" (I know, best word I could come up with). We were given a side of Brussel sprouts as well. We were split (1 yay, and 1 nay) on these. Deserts were great.

2015-12-05,3.0,"On one hand, I'm a fan of Lettuce Entertain You restaurants; on the other hand, I think they've expanded way too much and their talent is blurred across the lines of their sister restaurants. Other than the air of snobbishness at Paris Club, many of their dishes are so similar to that of Mon Ami Gabi (LEY) and Reel Club (LEY), I can easily forget where I'm dining if it weren't for a different location and a higher price. Having last been to Paris Club about 4 years ago, I was shocked by the changes. While it's rumored that Blackhawks players party at Sub 51 and date the bottle girls, that's certainly not a valid reason to snub diners, which is precisely what they do. The snob quotient is sky high here. If they think Chicago people enjoy obnoxious servers and waitstaff, they're wrong. If Paris Club assumes Parisian bistros are pretentious and cold, they've obviously never traveled beyond the States.  We went with another couple to celebrate the girlfriend's birthday. I was the only one who had been to Paris Club previously, albeit, 4 years ago, so we were all somewhat new to the bistro. Servers was generally friendly until we didn't order alcohol. The couple we were with doesn't drink, thus, we didn't on this occasion, either. We must have been asked 6 times if we were going to order a cocktail, and each time we said NO. Annoying is an understatement. It's not like we stopped in for dinner and shared the burger amongst the 4 of us. The bad attitude and overall negativity is what brings down the stars at Paris Club. We weren't the only table visibly being annoyed by a waitperson thinking they were above the patrons on the food chain. What someone in LEY management should do is remind the waitstaff that they won't have their jobs if people don't dine at the restaurant.   The food part of Paris Club is very good.  Except for the Onion Soup, which we each had, we shared everything. We also ordered grilled oysters, Burgundy Escargots, butter lettuce salad with Roquefort and herbs, Brussels sprouts, trout amandine, 2 orders of steak frites, pumpkin risotto. dark chocolate mousse and apple tarte tatin for dessert. Flavors are distinct, entrees are well plated, everything is pretty and just as tasty. For the price, it should be, but it's not the high prices that will keep us from coming back, it's the super bad attitude of the staff, which is a shame in the restaurant industry.",0.2401,0.843,0.083,0.074,0.5511224211224213

The Steak Frites were DELICIOUS. The steak was seasoned perfectly and the bearnaise sauce was also really good and the fries were warm and crispy. The skate wing was also very delicious but the portion was smaller that we expected and I preferred the  flavor of the steak and fries (if I come again and want a light dinner, I'll definitely order skate wing). I've never had escargot before, but it seemed to be cooked appropriately; I really liked the sauce. The french onion soup was a bit cheesy for me, but it's the perfect thing if you like cheese. The mousse really was not good at all (very dense and boring) but the chocolate sauce on the profiterole was AMAZING and went well with the caramel (I was scraping the plate when we finished).

2015-04-24,1.0,"I have long been a fan of Chef Jean Joho and have long equated him with such luminaries as Charlie Trotter and Guy Savoy. Bold flavors, avant-garde presentation, fabulous wine list all with impeccable service and wonderful ambiance. Joho's cuisine was a regular staple in my life, so much so my first date with my now wife was at Brasserie Jo in Boston because I knew the food would be spectacular (it was). I am a true fan of this man's work, which is why it physically pains me to say this: Paris Club is terrible. Since the last time I was in here, it had been remodeled - I believe for the 3rd time. They used to have a dining area with glazed, white brick walls - which was very classic Parisian. Now it's all dark wood paneling with clichéd, French advertising scattered about, red leatherette seating, rounded booths, enormous, brass chandeliers with Edison lights and tiny spotlights shining down on your table. It didn't feel inviting, it felt stuffy and tried to be ""hipster ironic"" with blaring french hip-hop music for seemingly no other reason than ""that's what the kids are listening to in France."" I know they are trying for a younger demographic, but this was almost schizophrenic in ambiance choices. Also the name: It's attached to a nightclub called ""Studio Paris"" (that also has a Ramen shop in it - Clang!), but the restaurant has the ""Club"" name? Then we get to the menu, which quite possibly could have been run on a Xerox from the 1970s, and is incredibly limited. I felt like Ralphie in A Christmas Story, but with former Joho dishes: ""No duck confit! No bag of shrimp with lobster sauce! No Coq Au Vin! Gone. All gone!"" We end up ordering off the ""Chef Week"" menu and get French standards: Onion Soup Gratinée, Steak Frîtes and choice of two desserts. I will say the soup was probably the best thing I ate that night, but it was just OK. No where near as good as it was when Brasserie Jo stood here. Something in it did not agree with my wife, so she couldn't eat it. Then we got the Steak Frîtes and they were given an au poivre treatment, which was not noted on the menu at all. I love pepper, but my wife has a bit of an aversion to it, so she couldn't eat it at all. Mine was rather cool when it came out, so I couldn't eat all of it. I understand you need to rest a steak after you cook it, but they gave it a true nap before serving. The frîtes were served in a paper-lined metal cup (which was fun) and were seasoned. I enjoyed them, for about a third of the way through, as the lower ones turned to greasy mush rather quickly. The dish came with a gravy boat of béarnaise that had a thicker skin on it than the Black Rhino at the Lincoln Park Zoo. I tried to pour it, but no luck - it had become partially dried glue before it got to me. Then dessert. I ordered the salted caramel profiterole and my wife got the chocolate mousse. First, why do we have ice cream in profiteroles in America?!? It is so cold it turns the pastry into cement. But that was secondary, since the plate had what I assumed was salted caramel drizzled on it, then they proceed to pour what I hoped was more caramel (as per the name), but NO! It was chocolate sauce, which seriously clashed with the salted caramel. The mousse was probably the worst I've had and came with toppings to sprinkle on it - like rice krispies... seriously? Understood, younger demographic, but are we talking 12 year olds? It was also either very old, or from a mix. I hope it was just old. However, my Kir Royale that night was enjoyable (No martini for me - I've had them here before, and they serve them in a champagne glass, which is an insult to a martini). So, we had 1 soup mostly eaten, 1 barely touched, barely touched frîtes, one uneaten steak and 2 barely touched desserts. Our server (who was outstanding, otherwise) said nothing about it and didn't ask any questions (other than ""do you want a box"") when there was clearly a problem as virtually full plates were taken away. I've worked in the restaurant business and it seemed she was trained to not say anything unless pressed on an issue. So we ended up paying for two full meals and only able to eat half. We did bring this up to our server after we got the check, and she did offer to get something else, but it was already too late for us. We just wanted to leave. To sum up, if you're a millennial with more trust fund than taste, this is your place. If you've been to France, or any of Joho's other restaurants, avoid Paris Club like the plague.

I think the exclusivity of the place made it popular but that is a short lived business model.",0.4686,0.922,0.051,0.026,0.4527777777777778
2015-03-02,4.0,Very sexy spot and some great drinks. I came in here with a friend to have a couple drinks before heading upstairs to their club Studio Paris (another great spot) and it was my first time in the downstairs bar. This is a very nice spot to have a few drinks with a friend or two or on a date. The bartender was very friendly and he was mixing up some great looking drinks as we sat at the bar unlike a regular bar they have a mixology style to them. I have yet to eat here but I saw a couple people and the food here looked delicious so as far as the presentation goes the food looked great. The place is quiet so you can hold a conversation without yelling and I liked the dim lighting a lot. This is definitely a spot you should consider especially if you're in the downtown Chicago area.,0.9813,0.782,0.2,0.018,0.6643288084464556
2015-03-02,4.0,Went there for Valentine's day.  I know this is unusual because of the set menu etc but I decided to review it anyway. The drinks were excellent.  The good was excellent. Our first course. Lobster bisque came out cold twice.   This was to a large degree the responsibility of the wait staff who seemed clueless. I could tell the soup was cold by looking at it and I do not work in the food industry. Our waitress was sassy and abrupt. She was more interested in correcting my highschool French pronunciation than taking our order.   The management comped our entire meal including drinks which was most generous. The food was fabulous when it came out correct so I have to give them four stars but they need to fix the service.,0.9802,0.794,0.184,0.022,0.6991269841269842
2015-03-01,3.0,"My boyfriend previously introduced me to Paris Club when we went in to grab a quick drink and appetizer. After that they closed for a remodel and slight re-concept, I decided for Valentine's Day this would be a great opportunity to visit again. I made reservations a few weeks out. At that time no separate menu or dinner instructions were listed online. A week out they called to confirm my reservation and informed me a set tasting menu would be available, er or mandatory. While I expected something special and/or different for Valentines, I did not expect it to be so late. When they confirmed my reservation less than a week out, the menu had not been set or finalized. I had to call two days before to ensure the menu would be good for my date (he has dietary restrictions), but also sound good and interesting. The person on the other end had to read the entire menu to me because they did not put it on line. Annoying. (I give three stars for the lack of organization and OK staff). The new interior is very classy, cozy and jazzy. The night we were there they were planning all 80s music. Great, we enjoyed the songs but it did not really fit with the decor. It is very dark; not as black and modern as the old look. The new look reminded me of RL but without all the photos on the walls. I love the little one man bar you pass on your way to the restroom. It is quite a set up! We sat against the wall in the back room. Private and intimate, but there was a draft so I kept my jacket on the entire meal. Not the look I was going for.  Regardless, we went and were ready to enjoy the four course tasting menu. We even opted for the wine parings! (Special occasion!). Our waitress was somewhat helpful in describing the menu and answering our questions and also making any slight changes for dietary purposes. For our first course we both went with the lobster bisque. It was sooo good and I have a new favorite flavor combination of sour cream, cumin and lobster (curry with a twist)! Highly recommend. If you go on a night where you can chose from the ala carte menu, go with the Lobster Scrambled Eggs on the baguette. Seriously, we cannot get enough of these little guys.  For the second course I went with the foie gras. I wanted to be 'adult' and have the Pâté. Side note, my boyfriend does not eat meat, so he went with the mushroom risotto. Usually risotto is a bit anticlimactic for me and bland. Not this one, I loved it and wanted to steal it from him. You can also order this off the ala carte menu. Back to my second course, so the foie gras comes out not as Pâté, but the actual thing, liver. I was not impressed but tried to go with it. Also, communication error with our waitress on this one. I would not have ordered if I knew it would be presented this way. It was too much for me. The texture and gaminess just were not what I was looking for. My boyfriend saw my disappointment and went in for a taste. He loved it! This coming from a guy who does not eat meat, not because he is vegan or has moral issues, but because he does not like the taste of meat. Well, I discovered he has a taste for foie gras. He gobbled it up while I sulked and had some bites of his risotto. Moving one.  The main course, continuing my experience in duck, I chose the crisp duck. After all this is a French restaurant and the French know how to do duck. I really enjoyed the presentation. The duck is presented on a plate that is a duck. I was not disappointed with this part of the duck and dug in. To be honest, I was so engrossed in my main dish (and by this point several wine parings in, and I'm slow so I had a wine glass pile up and had to drink faster), I do not remember what my boyfriend ordered. It was probably a fish dish. But I do not remember any complaints from him.  Last, we went to dessert, the caramel dessert. Sorry I cannot speak to this, it was a dessert and I was full so I did not eat much. One fun add on, they messed up our table assignments and brought us a nice glass of port the table next to us ordered. They could not take it back so we thoroughly enjoyed it in addition to the port that accompanies the wine tasting. Over all, a solid experience with some good and bad meal choices. Live and learn and we will be back again someday.",0.9976,0.824,0.13,0.046,0.44734651711924456
2015-02-20,4.0,"I am not typically a fan of French cuisine, but was meeting an old friend here for dinner. I got there a little early and sat at the bar where the bartender was great! He was friendly, offered to charge my phone for me which kept dying, continuously checked in to see if I needed anything (but not overly so), and brought some small mushrooms compliments of the chef to munch on while I waited. He seemed very knowledgable! I observed him being great to all customers. My friend and I split the cheese platter which was amazing! A variety of cheeses and breads plus Apple compote. I could have just eaten that all night! We both got the roasted mushroom risotto, and cleaned our plates! Holy cow it was delicious! Some of the best risotto I've ever had. We split two desserts, chocolate mousse and salted caramel little ice cream sandwiches that have a way more proper name I can't remember. :) They were topped with melted hot chocolate by our server---both were amazing desserts. Because I'm not a huge fan of French, there were few things to choose from for me, which is my issue not the restaurant's. However, I felt thy offered a good menu for people like myself who aren't huge into French and only occasionally dip my toes in--they had a roasted chicken dish I would like to try. Our server was very kind, but had some difficulty remembering specials and beers--she had to get answers for us a few times, but her overall service was pretty decent. They have apparently remodeled, and it liked beautiful inside. A good vibe. It is pricey, so I would be aware that drinks are expensive, even for a beer.

2015-01-15,2.0,"So disappointing. Really wanted to love this place but sadly, cannot recommend it.  5 stars for cocktails, 1 star for service and 3 stars for food but given the prices, I expected better so I'll have to round down on my review. We had a reservation for 8 on a Saturday night and were told it would be a little while before we were seated. No problem, we went to the bar and not two minutes later were told our table was ready. Thing is, the expertly crafted cocktails (try the Sazerac - amazing) take a long time to make. So there we stood with the hostess kinda hanging around with us in an awkward trap.  Someone should have said - no problem - we'll bring your drinks to your table. instead we let the ladies sit and by buddy and I waited for our drinks. Thankfully they were worth the wait. Our server was very inexperienced and that really played a big role in my dislike of the place. Just because you put a dress shirt on a 23 year old and give them a white apron to make them look like a Parisian waiter, does not a great server make. She was hard to find, had to ask for bread twice, good luck getting your water glass refilled and a replacement fork was no where to be had. When you spend you time looking around the room hoping your server will stop by, instead of chatting with your friends, that sucks. The one time she did stop by was right as our food was placed down. Kinda hard to know if everything came out OK if you haven't given me a chance to try it. I should mentioned the place was busy but not crazy busy. The food was hit or miss. The apps like steak tare tare and the scrambled eggs with lobster were great. The entrees were so-so. My Duck a l'Orange was meh. And for $38 it was ever more disappointing. other reported their dishes to be decent but nothing to write home about. All very pricey. I get it, it's River North but c'mon, at least make it good! We had desert (the eclair) and it was good so at least we needed on a high note. But gotta say that service (or lack thereof) really did it for me.

Our server was lovely, giving us suggestions as necessary and making sure we had everything we needed during our late night visit. Two of my counterparts tried champagne drinks, I cannot recall which ones, but they noted they were just OK and nothing spectacular. Unfortunately they had run out of my desert of choice, the salted caramel profiteroles, but they graciously offered a substitute desert at no charge.  I chose the tart, and it was quite tasty, not too tart, not too sweet.   Thank you Paris for being a gracious host, as a last minute substitute for our cancelled reservation elsewhere.  The next time I am in Chicago I will be stopping by to try your food.",0.9432,0.777,0.154,0.07,0.5779541446208113

For our main courses we both elected to get the national dish of France: steak frites.  She picked the béarnaise sauce and I went with the bone marrow bordelaise.  The skirt steaks and French fries arrived at the table piping hot.  Both sauces were good but I preferred the béarnaise to the bordelaise.  The fries had a meltingly soft interior and with a crisp crust. They were well seasoned with parsley and a good salt.   The dessert of salted caramel profiteroles was served in a warm dark chocolate sauce.  One portion was more than enough for two people though I could have easily consumed it by myself. I tend to be extra greedy when it comes to desserts. The service was attentive. Our waiter was very knowledgeable on items offered by the bistro from the special wines to the La Colombe coffee.

I ordered the foie gras special they had for an appetizer. They gave a good amount of foie gras along with a marmalade served with toast. I ran out of toast to go with the foie gras, but our waitress noticed and came promptly to ask if I wanted more toast. For my entree I had to order the lobster risotto (also a special) because it sounded so amazing. It was indeed amazing. The risotto had some corn in it which added a nice texture. It was a little too buttery/rich after having had the foie gras.  My friend recommended the salted caramel profiteroles for dessert. The pastry was so light and airy.

2014-07-28,2.0,"The revamped Paris Club exemplifies the saying ""don't fix what's not broken."" As a frequent customer of the ""old"" Paris Club, I was excited to try out the revamped space. I'm sorry to say it did not live up to expectations. The dining room--which previously was designed in an open, loft style--now has an retro supper-club look. Wood paneling, leather booths, reading lamps at the bar, etc. Other restaurants in the area (e.g., Bavette's) manage to make a similar look work; but, if it's not done well, it ends up looking kitschy. Unfortunately, that's the case with the new Paris Club. Maybe it's the old-timey jazz music in the background, but it simply feels too affected. Not to mention the fact that the space is a lot smaller and feels a bit cramped. All this would be forgivable, of course, if the food was good. For the most part, that was not the case. The menu has been cut down considerably; a lot of the small plates Paris Club used to feature have been removed. I started with steak tartare, which left much to be desired. The ancillary ingredients--especially the mustard--completely overwhelmed the taste of the meat. My girlfriend's steak had the opposite problem: it was pretty under-seasoned and flavorless. My main course--lobster risotto--was the lone bright spot.   The lobster was well cooked and the lobster cream sauce was rich and flavorful. And, to top it off, the dish was served with black truffles, shaved table side (and they did not skimp on the truffles).

That, my friends, is about the only positive experience we had at this place.  On a whim, my wife and I decided to try Paris Club after we got out of work on a Thursday.  I should have known when we walked in that we were in trouble.  The hostess seemed to care less we were there (probably given there were only two other tables at 7pm - both filled with couples likely in their 60s) and our server definitely wasn't a ball on sunshine either. Before ordering, we were ""greeted"" with an amuse of truffle and spinach puffs, which honestly tasted like they came from a Walmart freezer aisle.  At this point, having only been to a few French restaurants, and given the high recommendation by the server, we decided to go with the escargot appetizer and the 5-spice duck for two (aka Duck a l'Orange) which I've been dying to try somewhere. Surprisingly, the escargot weren't bad (but then again, they were smothered in so much butter/oil that it would of been impossible for them to be).  We were 50-50 at that point on the place. When the server brought out the whole duck and encouraged us to take a smell, I was almost positive we were in for a treat.  After we gave our acknowledgement for them to take the duck back and butcher it, we were presented with a platter of meat accompanied by crepes, vegetables and orange sauce (from the drippings).  After the first bite, I knew we were done. The duck had absolutely no flavor.  I honestly cannot comprehend how something so fatty, so rich could be so bland, but they managed to do it.  I honestly felt bad (for once in my life) that a duck had given its life to be so poorly prepared. Getting the bill, and realizing the price we paid for such a mediocre meal just added additional salt to the wound.  Needless to say, we'll never go back.",0.9798,0.867,0.113,0.02,0.5777878787878789

2014-05-15,4.0,"I was definitely a fan of the previous PC menu and dining room feel.  It didn't need a re-vamp because the atmosphere and the food carried it. However, with the re-vamp being more ""Paris bistro"" like, I think they did a great job. We were surprised to see what seemed like a smaller and less creative menu, but to get to the  bottom line quickly every single dish we ordered was perfect.   I might even go so far as to say that the hanger steak and frites I had was right about the best piece of steak I have ever had in my life. (we live in Chicago- no shortage of meat opportunities, right:). it was amazing. And their fries are perfectly crispy and full of potato all at the same time. My dad had the burger which he said was awesome, My sister had the trout almandine- traditional french with loads of toasted almonds, drenched in butter.  This is along the lines of the posters below. There was one poster who said that the redesign wasn't on point for today, but I guess the entire point of the re-vamp was to re-concept. I do think that the traditional bistro, darker lighting, smaller enclosed dining room does attract a diff crowd. We were there at 7 PM on a Wed,. and  saw lots of older couples dining out for the evening, as opposed to an after-work crowd migrating and staying for dinner.  I was disappointed that mussels were not on the app. menu that night. onto the desserts- profiterole - meh. Rum cake was delicious with about 1 LB of that thick whipped vanilla creme that could send you into heaven. Great dining experience. Do I like the re-concept ? Yes, since I'm 40 I don't look for the dress-up lets go see and be scene crowd so the new look of this place doesn't feel like it caters to that scene anymore.  The menu, though abbreviated, will provide you with well-executed items. I am still dreaming about that steak - which was cooked perfectly to my specifications might i add!! One more note- if you need large portions of food- don't go here. The portions are still over-size compared to what every other country eats in terms of meal-portions. If you need an XL sized roast chicken platter, go to Olive Garden.  The portions are decent and will leave you feeling very satisfied.",0.9976,0.78,0.193,0.027,0.6213041125541126
2014-05-11,1.0,"Recently, they redesigned the restaurant and bar and not for the better.  It used to be light and full of energy and now it is wood paneled and dark.  But that is not why I am giving it one star.  It took an extraordinary amount of time to have brunch there today and the place was only half full.  The frisee salad was over dressed.  But what really angered me was that when the plates arrived, mine was the wrong dish.  After everybody finished their course, my correct plate finally arrived,  There was no offer of accommodation by either the manager or staff.  When the bill arrived, it was there along with everything else we ordered.  When it opened, the place had a creative kitchen. Now, service and food are below average. Beyond that, they seem to think their past reputation will carry them through.  Many more customers have the same experience and they will learn a hard lesson.",-0.8287,0.882,0.03,0.088,0.5885964912280702
2014-05-07,4.0,"Originally posted this as a follow up to a previous review a few days ago on their old listing.  Just figured out that they re-listed the business as ""bistro and bar"". This is my second review for Paris Club, and admittedly my first one wasn't all that favorable. So why bother going back and why another review when Chicago has so many other incredible places to eat?  Because the management of Paris Club actually reads these reviews and works to address the complaints they hear.  They  changed some things and then reached out to us to invite us back to check out the improvements. Good for them! Better yet, good for us.   This experience was much better than the last. As before, the staff was great and the atmosphere very comfortable. The biggest difference is that this time we left feeling full and satiated. The escargot was exactly as the traditional French preparation dictates; full of flavor and not overwhelmed by the oil. The lightly toasted French baguette was served sectioned into five pieces for six snails -  a minor oversight. We shared the frisée salad. You probably don't want one to yourself unless you are very hungry. Two of us had our fill with a single order. Full of flavor. Quite nice Muscles and a 16 oz ribeye rounded out the dinner. I went straight for the big steak this time to ensure that I'd go away full. It was a great choice; seasoned nicely and cooked as requested. The muscles had a simple yet complex broth. Again, very nice flavors. Although I was stuffed, I was disappointed to see the table next to us receive an off-menu vegetable which I would have really enjoyed - and which our server didn't offer us. When asked about it later, she noted that we had very full orders and figured that we wouldn't be interested. Maybe ... But maybe I would have changed my order to get some of that yummy looking asparagus. We shared a dessert, not because we had space for it, but because my wife recognized one of their offerings as something she and her dad used to share when she was young. We had the Rhum Baba. It was just as she remembered, sweet and succulent. The table side offering of your choice of several different styles of rum is a nice touch. This time we went away full. That's a completely different experience than the previous visit. I still find it shocking that a French bistro doesn't provide a nice crisp crusted baguette as part of your experience (no bread except that which was part of a served dish was offered).  The staff was again friendly and informative but made numerous little mistakes in their service that you might not expect if you're picky about service details - and which you wouldn't even notice if you aren't.   Paris club isn't inexpensive. We spent $155 plus tip for just two of us, four drinks included. This time though, I didn't feel ripped off for my spend. A fair value for a nice meal.

2014-04-30,5.0,"We had been wanting to visit Paris Club since it first opened, but just never got around to it. We received a fabulous gift certificate from a friend for Christmas, and eagerly awaited the re-open. Afternoon-of we were able to get an 8pm reservation.  Last night it surpassed ALL expectations!!! Our server, Rebecca, was amazingly sweet and knowledgeable. She made the experience very special and gave me a fantastic wine recommendation. For drinks we had a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and a Hoopla, later followed by the St. George Framboise brandy and a glass of Moncontour champagne. Our appetizers were the special scallops and Oven Roasted Escargots. For dinner my bf had the Classic Steak Frites, and I had the Tender Braised Beef--both cuts of meat were insaaaanely delicious. Insane. For dessert we had the Chocolate Mousse (incredible, crazy good, and a HUGE portion) and the special Pistachio Creme Brulee. Every single thing we ate was divine. Just amazing. The ambiance of the restaurant is perfect--the decor, the music, the mood. We love food. And this place is just......DELICIOUS. We got to chat with the general manager afterwards, and everyone there was just extremely helpful and friendly. Very lovely. Can't wait to go back!",0.9979,0.643,0.317,0.04,0.6246666666666666
2014-04-29,5.0,"I came in to the newly renovated and very elegant Paris with my husband for dinner tonight. I was surprised- the small intimate structure is classy with a quiet-chatter environment. Relaxing- compared to many loud-chatter restaurants in River North. The dining room was more than halfway filled by 7:00. Mostly large groups gathering for some drinks and good meals after work.  My husband and I had a great time from start to finish. The service was impeccable.  From being greeted by the host, being seated in a comfortable booth, to the professionalism of our waitress, to getting new plates, waters right away, and a complimentary appetizer, and more! It's a graet place to bring someone.  I ordered the classic steak frites, medium, best ever. They are my favorite steak frites in town. The crispiness on the outside, and perfectly tender in the inside, I always wish I could eat it more slowly and savor it but it's too good. You can also choose what sauce you would like with it. They come with a side of fries for 25.95. Worth every penny.  My husband and I passed on the drinks tonight, but they seem to have a great cocktail and wine list that I may peak at next time. The manager also came over to greet himself and gave his contact information which is always appreciated. I would also come back for a drink at the bar.",0.9921,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5303239770981708

2014-04-23,5.0,"Went here for dinner one night a month or so ago. It was fantastic!  To start, we had the best waiter ever. I think his name was Earl. Very knowledgeable about everything on the menu. We took his advice on the wine and were not disappointed! We really went overboard here, ordering everything we thought sounded good and everything was! The appetizers were like meals themselves. We had this one dish with pesto toasted baguettes with a whole wedge of brie as the spread. It was to die for. For an entree, I had the braised short rib. I never had beef so tender in my life. It required no knife whatsoever and neither was I served one! LOL For dessert, I got the dark chocolate mousse. Definitely the best I ever had. It was super thick and chocolatey unlike the bland you tend to get at most restaraunts. it came with many interesting toppings such as rice krispies, chocolate pearls, and lemon meringue drops. Bottom line, if you're i. the neighbor hood and looking for a place with top notch dishes, look no further! LEYE has done it again.",0.9808,0.791,0.169,0.039,0.4897727272727272

This wasn't the best start to our experience.  For drinks, 3 of the ladies I was dining with ordered dirty martinis and had to ask for extra olive juice on the side for BOTH rounds- this was quite a hassle.  The menu is fairly limited, the food was really delicious however -we split several appetizers and were not disappointed at all. The best dish was definitely the lobster scrambled eggs! Yummy. The steak tartare was also a highlight for our table.

Then we had this amazing artisanal pasta with Gruyere cheese, smoked ham it was velvety and gorgeous. Next a frisee and lardon salad...very typical and delicious.

2014-03-23,2.0,"I miss the old Paris! I thought I'd be excited about the new renovations, however I was sadly disappointed. It felt as though I had walked into a Maggianos  extremely dim lighting and old school furnishings. As I walked to my table I had to squeeze through the overcrowded bar which is smack dab in the entrance, this was extremely annoying. The service itself was good, that's it. The worst part I would say was the food. I ordered the Daube De Boeuf which was a very small portion and very over salted. My friends ordered the Veal Sweetbreads they said it was very bland and their food portions were even smaller. Oh and the only entrance to their club next door is back through the front, you no longer have the luxury of walking in though the inside which used to be a huge perk especially in this blistering cold Chicago weather.

2014-03-07,5.0,"This fan of the original Paris Cub concept is suprisingly in love with this more posh and traditional bistro revamp. If it was possible to dive off of a tall board into a pool of those saucy and plump scallops over creamy celery root, I would. If the chef said ""Here, smash your face into the entire night's supply of black truffle capered skate wing"", I would. And they've already supplied a cruise ship-sized serving of the most wonderful chocolate mousse since the movie director yelled ""That's a wrap!"" on the set of Chocolat. All of this, I would do. Because I'm a fattie. Let's cut this pretentious foodie bullshit out.. :) Now I won't lie and say that we weren't dripping a few tears over the demise of those crispy duck cracklings and Coq au Vin that the old tapas bar like version of Paris Club used to master. And we damn near punched out one of those new, swanky frosted glass booth partitions once they admitted that the foie gras chicken thigh dish was gone. GET THAT BACK, CHEF DOUG! JACOB! :P Seriously, Lettuce has really outdone themselves with the revamp of the former and nouveau trendy version of the old Paris Club. Kiki's Bistro is my favorite French restaurant in Chicago for full meal service and La Creparie is a dear, BUT this new, posh, classic version of Paris Club Bistro is causing a huge mouthquake and everyone else'd better look out because they seem to mean serious business.
