First of all, parking was relatively easy (which I really appreciated!) It is rare to find a spot where you don't have to pay additional parking, use a valet or inconvenience yourself with a City meter.  We parked across the street on Western, went in and were quickly seated.  Our server (Juan Carlos) brought the good time with him! He was a riot, knowledgeable, and made the entire experience that much more hilarious. We ordered the Croquetas and Platano Rellenos (we split them between beef and chicken) for our appetizers. Absolutely delicious!!  The sauce that came with the croquetas kept being requested for the rest of the meal lol...it was great! I ordered the Lechon, my friend ordered the Pechuga de pollo a la Parilla, and my sister ordered the Bolero Combo Platter...all very good! The food was served quickly, hot, and well seasoned. The meats were tender and moist. I added a bit of the ""sauce"" to my roasted pork, and the seasoned butter (that came with the bread) to my yucca, and it was perfect!  The next day my leftovers were even better :) Overall, it was a night for enjoyment and flavorful food. Great atmosphere, good food (nice-size portions) and reasonable prices.

The waiter went and got the owner. This guy came at us sooo assertively, totally disrespected my mom and my sister, WOULD NOT even let us explain anything to him and basically said ""THIS IS MY BUSINESS AND TODAY I HAVE DECIDED NOT TO USE THESE COUPONS, HAPPY MOTHERS DAY"" and stormed away.. we then tried to get him to simply sign the coupon saying he didn't take it, so i can get my money back, he replied ""ugh, i'm too busy right now"" and once again was so incredibly rude!! I have never come across someone who was so disrespectful and mistreated his customers. The golden rule of ANY business owner is customer retention.  I was so embarrassed and offended; and felt horrible for my mom, she did not deserve that at all. I will NEVER contribute my money, or tell people to go somewhere where the OWNER of the place has NO COMMON COURTESY.. it was extremely upsetting,  like i said i had no problem taking care of the tab, or if in the end he didn't accept the coupon (which  restaurant.com  reported because they said he shouldn't have done that), I was just completely taken off guard to be treated the way he treated us, and to come across a BUSINESS OWNER who wouldn't even listen to customers.

It was casual, cozy and can be romantic.  The waiter thought so too.  He kept trying to charm my sisters and I with really bad attempts at jokes.  He also stuck around a little longer than was appropriate.   Anyhow, we got to ordering: I ordered  the Boliche ( beef stuffed with ham and sausage).  It was pretty dang delicious.  They give you 3 giant pieces of beef.  It was enough for 3 people, however, I had no problem finishing it.  Shameful, I know, but it was so good!  The beans and plantains were also very tasty.  The plantains were a perfect sweet break to all that savory and sauce. One of my sisters ordered the Chuletas Puerco (fried pork chops).  I had a taste of it and was impressed.  I'm not a fan of pork chops but the way these were done was really good.   My other sister got the chicken breast.  That too was really good.  Very tender and tasty.   At the end of our meal we decided to order mussels since we were starving (HA!) They were amazing.  The white wine and garlic sauce they were cooked in was delicious.  I couldn't stop dipping the bread into the sauce.   So you see the food was really good.  The only thing that would stop me from going back would be the waiter.  He was VERY nice but was hanging around at our table too much and for too long.  My sisters and I were hardly able to focus on the meal and each other because either he was there or because we were talking about whatever weird thing he said to us or did.",0.9974,0.697,0.227,0.076,0.6501937984496123

2011-12-28,2.0,"I went back on a Tuesday night, and i had a completely different experience. First off, we were gruffly welcomed by a waiter who seated us at a tiny and scrunched table an inch away from the door, so I was freezing the whole time. A couple that came in after us was seated at a nice, 4 person table in the middle of the room and away from the door. Our waiter came by after a while and asked us if we decided on drinks. We said we hadn't looked at the drinks yet, because we were so hungry, but we did order an appetizer (Platano Relleno) first thing. Our appetizer arrived and the waiter asked if we were ready to order. We said yes. I had the Milanesa de Pollo and my husband had the Boliche. We also ordered drinks at this time - sangria for me and wine for him. We waited a while, and groups arriving after us were served  their drinks, and even some of their dinners. We saw what I thought was our food placed in front of the people at a neighboring table. The diners looked at the food and called their waiter back, saying they didn't order these items. The waiter took the food away. About five minutes later, the same food was served to us - they had gotten the tables wrong. Now, I understand mistakes happen, but then they go ahead and serve us the food that they had already placed, and left, at another table?  When our food did arrive, we still didn't have our drinks. The waiter who brought us our food was not the same guy as who took the orders, so we asked the other waiter about our drinks. No apology, nothing, he just asks us what we ordered. A few minutes later, we had our drinks. Our waiter never mentioned the food or drink mix up to us. As for the food, I thought my dish was just too heavy with the onions and the hubby's was just kind of dried out and not very flavorful. The appetizer was pretty good and the meat in the plantain was well seasoned. We used an online coupon for $25 off, which made me feel a little better. As expected, they did add 18% to the bill for gratuity. Even though I was expecting it, I wish they hadn't to make up for the bad service. Overall though, I didn't enjoy myself.

These musicians were so classy. We stayed til about 11. They played some great tunes and it reminded me why I love Chicago so much. This place is underrated and it should be packed way more considering what it has to offer. My only critique is that they don't muddle their mojitos. They just add the mint on top rather than muddling it before making it. It makes for a rather weak mojito with not a lot of flavor.  Overall though, I will be making frequent visits here.

And then when the owner(?) came to our table with the food, he stood there staring at us for a good 5-10 seconds holding the plates in the air before asking which one of us had which dish.  It was a weird and awkward moment. We ordered some beef empanadillas as an appetizer, which were pretty tasty. I ordered the ropa vieja, and my fiance ordered the palomia. Both of these meat dishes were quite good, but for some reason the white rice that came with the dishes tasted...off. Like it wasn't cooked all the way through or something (and I say this as someone with a Latin mother who makes white rice pretty regularly).  A big complaint I have (which I know others noted as well) was them adding the 18% service charge to the bill.  I know to tip off the full price of the bill when using these deals, and I found it sort of offensive and presumptuous that they assumed I wouldn't and added it themselves. And to be honest, they actually cheated themselves out of a little bit extra, because we tend to leave 20% tips when we go out, especially if we are already getting a deal.",0.9016,0.853,0.089,0.058,0.46174242424242423

Everything is ok and fine up to this moment - granted, food was not as good as we expected. i can accept it, and might give it a second chance when opportunity comes next time ...  HOWEVER...

We walk in and hear cool ...and what i am guessing is Cuban...music. We were seated in a adjoining room with a fully stocked bar. This restaurant would have an estimate of about 15 tables.

2011-09-07,3.0,"I'm writing in 3.5 stars for Bolero...I wasn't intending to try Cafe Bolero, but after traveling far and wide for a BYOB and ending up empty handed, this turned out to be the place I happened upon. For the record, this restaurant is NOT BYOB. Ok, now that we've cleared that up; I was happy with the forced selection of this location. I had the grilled shrimp, which was really good. I kind of think the plantains tasted like plastic, which was upsetting considering they were the part I was most excited about, but considering there isn't a plantain tree outside, I can see how that would happen. I wouldn't opt for the Nieto Malbec, which doesn't necessarily reflect poorly on Bolero. If I had to compare it to something, I would say its the Keystone Light of Malbecs; pure water essentially and easy to drink. That's not always a bad thing, especially if you lack taste buds. Or are playing Flip Cup. Fortunately the best part of the meal came at the end. As if gorging myself on my full entree and half a loaf of bread wasn't enough, I had to sample the dessert. When in Rome and you're a Yelper, you must try it all! We settled on going halvies with the flan and our server requested he pick the flavor since we couldn't decide. I had never seen multiple options of flan before. The guava flan was our destiny and was everything I had hoped it would be and more. If I returned, I would like to do so on a night they have live music (Tuesdays and Thursdays) or when the weather is nice and I can enjoy the outdoor seating.",0.9902,0.792,0.164,0.044,0.5764367816091954

The second time I went I tried a full entree - the fricase de pollo and ugh again still not impressed. So the reason it gets 3 stars is because the service was great and the drinks weren't bad either. Now will I be back anytime soon?

2011-06-10,5.0,"Our experience started with a Living Social coupon for Café Bolero. I called before the coupon purchase to find out if their vegetarian menu could accommodate my son's vegan requirements. I was assured that they could. We decided to visit Café Bolero on Tuesday, May 24th. As we entered the restaurant we were greeted by Juan, who we later learned was one of the owners of the restaurant. He enticed us to sit in the back room to listen to the band that they had that night. They have bands every Tuesday night. We were seated at a table in front of the band. I remarked to my son that we would not be able to converse when the band was playing, but we decided to stay at the front table nevertheless. Juan introduced himself and asked for our first names. Throughout the evening he called us by our names. We ordered a couple of Mojitos right away and then asked him about the menu (the Mojitos were not strong). He arranged a combination plate, not on the menu to give my son a taste of the various vegetarian dishes. For me he steered me toward Two Tapas dishes:  Chevapchichi (homemade grilled sausage served with feta cheese, marinated peppers and onions) and Shrimp Flamenco (fresh shrimp sautéed with roasted peppers, garlic and onion). Our meal started with warm crusty bread with two spreads:  the first a garlic-herb butter spread and the second was cooked red peppers with garlic, onion, and oil. A shared salad came next that was a modified Cuban Black Bean Delight with black beans, onions, celery, tomatoes, cucumbers, and avocado with balsamic vinaigrette. Next the entrées were served. My son's vegan dish had fried sweet plantains (outstanding), white rice and black beans, very garlicky yucca (like a potato), and a vegetarian Paella. My two tapas were served; the shrimp was cooked to perfection and the sausage feta cheese combination was interesting. We also both got a cup of black bean soup. At about the same time the band started playing. The band played Latin Jazz and had brass, bongos, drums, bass, an electronic piano, and other percussion played from the bar. At one point a couple got up and danced to the music. It was the sum total of the experience that made our visit to Café Bolero extraordinary. It was the good food, the great band, the incredibly genuine and accommodating host (Juan), the Cuban atmosphere, and the feeling of belonging that created an outstanding evening. The bill was only $65 (before coupon, without tip, and 4 drinks). We highly recommend Café Bolero for a little sample of Cuban Heaven and we will be going back.

I believe it was the owner who took our order and he was incredibly gracious and charming. I got the impression that he was out a server - perhaps someone called in sick or Monday's are usually slow - but he definitely wasn't the waiter type. However, his pleasant demeanor and friendly attitude made up for small slip-ups (he forgot my black beans and second Materva soda - which is really tasty, btw). The herb butter that came with the bread was fantastic as was the bread itself. I ordered the Ropa Vieja and it was very savory. My friend ordered the Lechon and he devoured it happily and quickly. I have to admit that the shrimp stuffed plantains were ""okay"" - only because I felt that the plantains were a bit starchy and lacking flavor, but the stuffing was good. If there were a bit more sauce to it, I think it would've been perfect. And the cafe con leche after our meal was just the thing to end our dinner experience. Delicioso. Sadly, I didn't get a chance to try the flan but that just means that I'll have to go back. That's not such a bad thing. :-)",0.9937,0.752,0.217,0.031,0.5766269841269841

He provided us with the best service all night: constantly checking on us (but not too often in an annoying way,) suggesting good dishes to try, and he even brought me a side dish to try-- ""because it didn't come with my entree and I just had to try it.""-- for free! When I searched ""byob"" places on yelp, Cafe Bolero came up, although it isn't advertised anywhere on their menu, etc. We asked if it was okay and if there was a corkage fee, but he just said ""no problem, I'll take care of that for you."" Later on our bill, we weren't charged a thing for bringing our own wine! The portions were HUGE. To start, we got the tortilla espanola, which was the most flavorful and large tortilla I have ever tried! It beat all the tapas I've had in Spain and Chicago.

Chicken was suppose to be ""juicy"" on the menu....ours was on the dry side and not seasoned. Had to dip it in the Black beans to give it flavor. It just wasn't good enough to even think about when we got home or even the next day. Very forgettable.  I could forgive the petty things below if the food was incredible, but it was not. Our Cuban experience went south very fast.  Petty things that we didn't like:  - ""House salad"" was just lettuce and carrots and they have no house dressing. The dressing that was offered was a choice of plastic pouches, like what you get at a cafeteria. I was buying the Cuban thing until the commissary packets of dressing came out. Then it was like I swallowed the red pill in the Matrix and was able to really see this place.     I ask for very little in my salads, except whent it's the house salad.  The house salad should  a little creative. I'm not asking for much.....but please, don't call a crummy side salad your house salad.   Is this what the house wants to be known for?   Was this their Cotes du Rhone of salads...?  I hope not.   Packets of dressing.....really? Droping $70 bucks for 2 people...trying to have a nice romantice dinner and your giving us packets of dressing....for the house salad of nothing but iceburg lettuce, carrots, and a cucumber.     - Table cloths, but paper napkins. Call me petty, but when it's dark, somewhat pricey, and table cloths, then I prefer cloth napkins.   It just ruins the experience to have this dressed up place using paper. It dresses it down....not up.  Cheapens the experience to have paper stuck to your fingers and not fitting on you lap.   The silverwear is curled up in the paper napkin.  This means when you try to put the napkin on your lap, it's curled up as well.   That means you have to put the napkin between your legs so it doesn't fall on the floor.   Spend the extra bucks, get some cloth napkins.   Next they'll be  BYON places.   - Sauce served in plastic containers that you find at some commercial fast food place (name your pick).  Again, it just cheapens the whole place.   Metal or glass containers can be reused, look nicer, and would cost less in the long run.   I'm usually an easy mark for 3 stars and you can sweet talk me into 4, but would have rather skipped this one. You don't cut corners on the ""experience"" areas unless your food is so incredible that you can get away with it (like a Manny's, Bob Chinn's....etc). 2 Stars.......",0.9381,0.875,0.074,0.051,0.48752252252252243

If you want to impress guests or have a hot date, Bolero is a fun environment with great food. It's one of those restaurants with a truly unique flare while being classy and delicious (and not pricey for that matter).  Their ropa vieja is some of the best in the city. I'm pretty picky about ropa vieja at any other eatery thanks to Cafe Bolero. I also love the warm bread and seasoned butter they put on the table while you skim the menu. They also have killer mojitos that are to die for (no pun intended), haha!  I've never had a bad experience in this restaurant. It can get really crowded at times, but I tend to like the ambiance in the back room more than the front (it's a little more romantic).  I recommended Bolero to my fiance for our first date and he's been hooked on Cuban food ever since. He actually took me to Bolero the night we were engaged and we had the best night EVER there.

2010-02-15,4.0,"This place was awesome - except for one small detail, which I'll get to after the good comments.   My wife and I met up with my aunt and uncle and we all enjoyed our food immensely.  We started with the Ceviche, something I have always been a little apprehensive about, since the thought of uncooked fish like sushi has always disturbed me a bit; well, that is not something to worry about with ceviche.  Ceviche is actually made by cooking the fish by soaking it in citric acid from lime juice in this case.  The ceviche was amazing.  I'm now hooked. As for our main courses, I had the Chilindron de Chivo, which is goat meat stewed with tomatoes, roasted peppers, garlic, onions, and white wine.  For my first time having goat meat, I am sold.  This dish had an amazing flavor and goat is really quite good.  My wife had the Lechon, which is roasted pork.  She loved it and from the bite I tried, it was quite good.  I believe my uncle had the Escabeche, which was sauteed Kingfish.  He had never had Kingfish before and he liked it quite a bit.  As for what my aunt had, I can't quite recall exactly at this moment, but I believe it was one of the chicken dishes and she was very complimentary of it. We then tried a couple of the desserts.  My wife and I split the Tres Leches cake, which we really enjoyed, thought it was *almost* too sweet, but not quite.  My aunt enjoyed the guava flan, which may have been a special that night, because looking at the menu right now, it isn't showing up.  My uncle then had the bomba, which he liked quite a bit. Okay, now the only part of the evening that we did not care for - the volume inside.  I normally do not mind a semi-noisy restaurant, but the volume of the music in the restaurant was quite loud, causing most of the people in the restaurant to speak louder than normal.  Combine the music and the fact that just about everyone in the restaurant had to yell to communicate and it turned out to be a very loud evening. I believe the excellent food made up for the noise though.  Great place!",0.995,0.833,0.154,0.013,0.6256613756613756

The black beans that came with it were quite delicious and REALLY flavorful, I really enjoyed this part of the meal.  Also, the bread with the herb butter was TO DIE FOR. I could have just had that to eat, plus some black beans and rice. Seriously, it was that good. Mmmm I want some now.

The patio on the north side of the restaurant provides the perfect combination of people-watching goodness, flowers, and shade (I'm a pale little snowflake, direct sunlight is the enemy).  I took note of the page of vegetarian options (yay!) but snubbed them in favor of the ropa vieja sandwich. Mama B. decided to try a hammy-type sandwich, but I forget which one. Anyway, this part of our dining experience was the low point, as it took quite a while for them to take our orders. It's hard to carry on a productive conversation when you are always looking over your dining companion's shoulder to try and catch a server's eye.  After awhile, our orders are taken. Now we can relax and enjoy our ice teas in the blissful weather that is early fall.  Food comes, and it is incredible. I meant to offer Mama B. some of my ropa vieja - honestly, I did! - but I scarfed it down far too quickly for there to be any to share. I ate every bit of my sandwich - even the bread was incredible. My mother ate with similar gusto.  One final note: Our server told us the sandwiches did not come with anything on the side. No worries! There are plenty of a la carte sides from which to choose - all for about $2. I went with the black beans (mmm, black beans). Then my sandwich came out. With a side of cilantro limey black beans.

I've watched how the restaurant evolved from a small undecorated authentic place to a more trendy eatery, to finally the upscale yuppie $$$ place it is today.  And from what I ate last night, Cafe Bolero is closer to its final stage - closing down. The food is not authentic Cuban food.  The flavors are bland,  portions small (as if I'm eating at a French restaurant), and the food simply is NOT fresh.  My whole table ordered simple sandwiches - Cuban sandwich (ham, cheese, pickle, pork, mustard), Steak sandwich, and a shredded beef sandwich. These are ALL simple dishes to prepare.  Yet, for some reason, it took ONE HOUR for the server to bring our simple food.... while other patrons were being served who came after us.  Huh? Something is not right.  One part is poor service.  The other part is poor communication with the kitchen. The steak sandwich was like eating beef jerky - super tough, sorta rubbery, and no flavor at all. Just a poor piece of meat that was overcooked. The Cuban sandwich was really small and lacked some of the essential toppings.... Cafe Bolero was letting me down. :-( Further, we ordered a guanabana shake.  The shake tasted quite bitter, almost sour.  We really hate sending items back, so we just added a bunch (like LOTS!) of sugar packets thinking it should work. However, it still tasted funny.  Now it was a super sweet and funny-tasting shake.  Almost like the fruit was too ripe or the milk gone bad.  (HERE'S THE GOOD PART.....) So we mention this to our waitress that it tastes funny. Normally, a good server would apologize, offer to make another, or just take it off the check.  However,  the first thing she said was, ""Have you ever HAD this fruit before? Do you know what it should taste like?"" - basically she was telling us that we were wrong.  We were fed up with trying to tell her it tasted bad and just sucked it up. This morning I received calls from my friends.  All of them (including myself) barely slept because of many trips to the bathroom.  Cafe Bolero served us all food that made us sick. Food poisoning 101.   I wrote this review to be informative to others - to protect others from getting sick. Not to be negative.

I had the pollo milanese and it was 2 meals worth of food.  So delicious.  I always want ham on my chicken parmasan now. My fiance had the flank steak and it was fresh, tasty and a big serving (better than some more expensive french restaurants but this is no steakhouse).

For dessert, we had the bomba which was chocolate and vanilla ice cream, nuts and cherries, surrounded by a chocolate shell.  Delicious.   We had to high-tail it out of there to make our movie, but the band was just starting up (tues and thurs nights they have live music) and it sounded pretty good.   A few things the restaurant may want to work on:  update your website.  We were very disappointed to find the restaurant BYOB when the website advertised all these fabu drinks.  BYOB is great when you plan for it, not really that great when you have to go to the sketchy liquor store on the corner and pay through the nose for what should be cheap wine and beer.  Also, update the bathroom.  Not the nicest.",0.9942,0.749,0.191,0.059,0.5814814814814814

The few workers still in the restaurant were incredibly friendly, which is surprising.  I know I'd be tempted to be pissy with some random schmuck who wandered in right when I was about to close.  I ordered a few things from the tapas section of the menu, and the food came up quickly. The chicken emanadillos were alright, but could have used some more spices/ingredients aside from the meat.  El Nandu, down the street a bit, has them beat on price and flavor, but these were still good. I had another dish that I can't remember, but it was something about stuffed friend plantains with meat.  Everything was tasty, and the plantains were cooked to just the right texture.  That's hard to find. The pulpo con ajo (""octopus with garlic"") was surprisingly great, and came in a huge portion for a tapa.  Not rubbery or fishy at all, with a great delicate flavor.  It was served with a really nice, slightly smoky, tomato-garlic sauce.  Thankfully, it wasn't oversauced, so the flavors got to mingle without getting belligerent. I would definitely like to stop by to eat at the place, probably with a bottle of Malbec... yum! Edit (11/08/07): OMG Arrachera!",0.9917,0.801,0.176,0.023,0.5455945165945166
