2014-05-27,5.0,"I can't say enough amazing things about Keefer's and am so sad it's closing in a few days. Came here to celebrate a friend's birthday and had the best time. Our waitress was extremely knowledgeable and knew just what to suggest and what to pair with our entrees and drinks. We started with the calamari and spicy mayo which was fantastic. I never like the squid-y looking ones so was happy there were some of the regular circular ones to choose from. The spicy mayo really hit the spot on this. I tried a bowl of their red pepper soup which sadly wasn't that great, was super oily and I couldn't even eat all of it because I had to keep wiping the oil off my mouth. It was tasty but really, lay off that oil! For my entrée I had crusted halibut which I believe was a special, boy was it amazing! Brought me right back to my honeymoon in Hawaii with how fresh that fish was. I couldn't stop eating it. Both my husband and our friend ordered a filet which looked so tasty and I don't even eat meat! We ordered a side of asparagus and a side of au gratin potatoes. Amazing, amazing. Shout out to our waitress for recommending those as sides to perfect our meal. Once our waitress learned we were celebrating our friend's birthday she brought out a chocolate mousse with a candle in it for him, so cute and thoughtful. We also ordered the carrot cake which was out of this world. Going to miss this place and hope its replacement keeps the staff on board.",0.9895,0.756,0.178,0.066,0.616029304029304

2014-03-01,2.0,"Came here for my fiancé' birthday dinner and we were quite disappointed in the overall experience. For this level of establishment and price, I would certainly look elsewhere because Keefer's falls short.  Let me start by saying that service is pretty great, quite attentive. I'd rate service a solid 4.5 stars. Atmosphere is nice as well, beautiful interior and interesting fixtures. After that, everything kind of goes downhill...  We ordered the Asian Pork Belly appetizer, after seeing it praised in many reviews. It was really just okay...the pork itself was tender and had good flavor, though there was a lot of fat to take off of the tiny little potion. It literally amounted to 2 bite each for two people.  I ordered French Onion Soup, one of my absolute favorite dishes ever. This also fell short (3 stars). The portion was quite large, the flavor of the soup was so-so, nothing better than what I get from Panera, and it was covered in a thick 1/2 inch of cheese. So much cheese that I could hardly manage to eat the soup without my knife. Finally, the main course. My filet mignon was ordered medium. It was weirdly dry, despite being mostly medium with a little well done in one end. Not much flavor to speak of. Fiancé's porterhouse, also ordered medium, was really medium-rare. He said it was seasoned okay, but certainly not what you'd expect from a restaurant of this caliber. The Au Gratin Potatoes were yuck; very starchy chunks of potato in a plain, flavorless cheese sauce. It was really lacking seasoning at all. We decided to cut our losses before dessert and left to try desserts at another place across the street. With so many great steakhouses in Chicago, I'd skip this one and try someplace else.",0.9524,0.852,0.111,0.037,0.49252491694352163

The atmosphere had good energy and was open and inviting.  Our server was a joy.  Attentive enough without being intrusive as this was a group who had not seen each other in years so the conversation was both lively and flowing and the round table set up encouraged this exchange. Our first course, the prosciutto wrapped asparagus, was top notch.  The vegetable had a hint of smoke and still had its crunch.  The prosciutto added that nice hint of salt and its charred edges just added to the complexity of the flavors.  Restraint was used with the cheese sauce, but it provided the perfect creamy and rich component to make this dish complete.  Best asparagus ever eaten by this diner. Our server didn't flinch when my cousin and I opted to split the ribeye.  In other steakhouses this may be frowned upon, but Keefer's had no such problem.   The meat came beautifully charred on the outside with a perfect medium rare center.  Every bite was luxurious especially when dipped in their house made bearnaise sauce.  Our taste buds and our bellies were truly satisfied.

2013-09-23,4.0,"After horrible experiences at steakhouses (I'm looking at you, Bavette's), I've been on the hunt for a steakhouse that offers delicious meat and impeccable service.  Keefer's might be the real deal.      Food:  We started with the bacon and blue (?) salad and the special heirloom tomato burrata salad.  Both were decent size and fresh.  For the entree, I opted for the filet and my husband went with the rib eye (no bone).  Both were cooked to perfection (medium rare of course - no one should order otherwise!) and had phenomenal flavors.  For the sides we ordered the sautéed spinach and garlic mashed potatoes.  Sautéed spinach was underwhelming - there was no lemon on it (as advertised on menu) and we had to ask for some.  Even though we added it something was still missing.  On the other hand, the garlic mashed potatoes were out of this world.  I was sad the portion was smaller (as expected-it was a side) because I could have eaten a large bowl of them!  For dessert we sampled the three sorbets.  The lemon was very flavorful and tart but the other two (berry and mango?) just tasted like straight up sugar.  Blah.  Minus one star for the issues with the spinach and sorbet.    Drinks:  Decent wine selection that was reasonably priced.  The prices for liquor though were a little excessive.  $17 for a sad pour of Booker's?  Not cool.  Service:  Our waitress was the epitome of perfect.  She was friendly and the right amount of attentive.  She wasn't pushy and let us take our time dining so that we could drag out the evening.  Her recommendations were also spot on.  Her service really made our evening that much more enjoyable.  Ambience:  Not as trendy as I expected for the neighborhood.  We sat in the booths around the bar and the lighting was perfect.  Dim but not so dark that we couldn't read our menus.  In contrast, the lighting in the main dining room looked much brighter.  I'm glad we snagged the booth just for that reason.  Dress:  Yelp says ""dressy"" but I tend to disagree.  You can totally get by with jeans - about 80% of the restaurant was wearing them.  Now jeans and a sweatshirt?  Probably not.  You would be perfectly fine with jeans and a nice blouse.  Want to dress up a little fancier?  I think that would be acceptable too but don't feel bad rocking the jeans.",0.9943,0.801,0.153,0.046,0.567869807497467

I went with my old standby, a bone-in ribeye.  It was very good but nothing to differentiate it from the old bone-ins you can get.  My disappointment was the potato croquettes.  This dish is what makes Benny's one of Chicago's top steak destinations but at Keefers they were not much better than a diner.

2013-08-03,4.0,"Of the various hyper-expensive steakhouses in the Loop and River North zones, this is my favorite. I generally come and sit at the bar, and the bartenders are excellent servers (and it's a good chance to sample a couple wines before you decide). I personally have stuck to the steak and potato components of the menu, but everything on there is perfectly prepared and delicious. (They don't explicitly say it, but all the beef is dry-aged by default.) I can recommend in particular the steak au poivre, which is one of the best-executed examples of that preparation I've had anywhere in this country. Where it loses a star is that the portions are, quite simply, Too Dang Big. The NY Strip clocks in somewhere around 16 oz. That is an insane piece of meat, and I have never actually been able to quite finish it, which always makes me sad about mistreating good and delicious beef. The same is true of the various potato preparations. This is doubly sad, because they could easily do a slightly lighter cut (12 oz?) and then not have to charge $50 for said steak. My best recommendation would be to come with a friend and split a steak if you can. It'll be spendy even with that, but you won't feel like quite as much of a glutton.",0.9847,0.729,0.19,0.081,0.5622857142857142

I thought to myself, ""self, you should go have dinner on the patio"". A nice-looking gentleman in his 50's greeted me at the door and engaged me as I asked if I could eat on the patio.  After I was seated, a young kid immediately filled my water and I asked what they had on tap. He said he had no clue, but my server would know, and walked away. Within another 60 seconds, another young kid brought me a yummy-looking (yes, yummy is a technical term) basket of bread and butter. I munched on the bread as I waited for my server to order a drink. Then a second piece of bread. Then a third. Before I knew it, I had eaten half a basket of bread and still hadn't seen my server... 15 minutes had passed. I pulled a $5 out of my wallet, left it on the table, and walked through the restaurant to leave, passing 8 waiters standing around talking. I told the gentleman at the front door that I left a few dollars for the bread and water, but because nobody wanted to take my order, I was leaving. It ended up, this guy was a Keefer (I think his name was Keith), and one of the other guys up front was Glen Keefer. They both apologized profusely, because it was the first day their patio was open, and asked me to give them another chance. Initially, I refused, but I'm glad I stayed. John was my waiter and he took tremendous care of me. I don' t know if he was my original waiter or not, and I don't care. I asked him for his recommendation and he said the special was fantastic: it was two beef medallions and a small order of spare ribs, and he recommended potato croquettes.  I went to cut into the ribs and found I didn't need my knife. The pork literally (yes, literally) fell apart and was perfectly done. The beef medallions were the best I've ever had... I could have cut them with a butter knife. The potato croquettes looked like tater tots on steroids, but tasted like mashed potatoes with a crusty exterior. They were incredible!

2013-03-18,2.0,"This is perhaps the least awful representation of the slab-o-beef Chicago steakhouse where you get a huge piece of overpriced meat plated with nothing more than a bit of wilted parsley - and then have to pay extra - actually, a LOT extra - for everything else.   The costly $48 bone-in strip itself was passable, but the black-and-blue steak promised by the server actually came out gray and pink.  If they can't cook the meat correctly, they should just admit it is going to be medium rare - or worse - and leave it at that.  Don't set a false expectation and then fall short. I give the main event a D-plus with a tailwind.   The costly Caesar salad was slimed to the max with a thick, tasteless glop that failed to strike any of the notes of garlic, anchovy or lemon that - this just in - is the whole freaking point of a Caesar salad.  Total fail, total ripoff. It gets an F with a vengeance.   The costly side of creamed spinach was diligent, if uninspired.  It rates a solid C. The costly, yet soul-less, pistachio biscotti impressively lacked texture, crunch and flavor, as though they recently had been plucked from a Sara Lee box.  I was ready to question the presence of pistachio at all - until I bit into a shell.  It rates a D-minus.  Why the generous two-star rating for such indifferent, yet costly, food?  Because this is a quieter and more civilized place to dine than the boisterous and overpriced feedlots that pass for restaurants in this part of town. The most offensive example of the genre, by far, is the Harry Caray's across the street.   If you are stuck in this part of Chicago and have to take a client to dinner, this is the least objectionable pick.

So good to be wiped up with a slice of your bloody steak. Mmm, bloody steak. I do miss eating you sometimes especially after writing this review. Keefer's is pretty consistent overall. My one gripe is that they exclaim that their beef is corn fed. That's not something to brag about. Corn isn't great for cows, they should be eating grass but er I guess I'm glad they put out the truth of the matter that hey we're serving corn fed beef WINK.

If you're looking for traditional, this is not your bag, but we appreciate the balance of fine-dining service without taking yourself too seriously. It is just dinner, afterall! The support staff was spot on as well.  So far, so good! Unfortunately, the food underwhelmed. The bread was cold, but not as cold as the butter. We couldn't even spread it. The scallop appetizer was seasoned beautifully, but there again, it was on the cold side. My husband's shrimp gumbo and my tuna steak were above average. The same could not be said of his surf and turf. While he raved about the lobster, the steak was somewhat overcooked for medium rare but still not hot. Maybe the food sat too long under the warmer before it made it to the table? Boo! We chalked up the missteps in food to the NYE craziness and the ""special surf and turf.""

Drinks were tasty, strong.  The wine was good but I rarely drink wine.   The appetizers we had were the grilled calamari and a shrimp Gumbo.  Both were very tasty and we enjoyed them.   Dinner itself was very good.  Steak was cooked to order and was very tasty.  Lobster was excellent and good as well.  The other entrees my friends had also looked very nice.

2012-12-13,5.0,"It's been a while since I have eaten in a high class restaurant.  This is where the owners of the company I work for decided to take us for Holiday Dinner this year.  Since I work so much, sometimes too tired to do anything after work or during my weekends, it's become such a treat when doing something outside of the norm. Parking is always hard in Chicago, and the valet for $10 definitely helps.  In Chicago, $10 is a steal when it comes to parking for more than an hour.  Just remember, you get what you pay for.  When I went to get my car back, they didn't even bother driving it to me.  They just gave me my keys and said it was across the street.  Maybe I just got used to Las Vegas version of Valet service but is this how Chicago does Valet? The restaurant itself is very classy and looks like one person would have to save up a week's worth of wage just to be able to enjoy eating here.  It looks very expensive from just how it looks.  After being seated, the servers pour water in your glass and ask if you would like to start with a wine.  I ordered a Shiraz and the wine came in a small glass container enough to fill a wine glass.  It's very different and very fancy, nothing I've ever seen before.   For a starter, I ordered the Calamari with Spicy Mayo.  I was impressed because they didn't just give you the rings, they also gave you the other part of the body.  This to me is actually the better part.  It's breaded perfectly and cooked just right.  Calamari wasn't tough or chewy.  The texture was just right.   For my main course, I ordered Grilled Tuna Steak with Soy Ginger Marinade, Wakame, Pickled Ginger & Wasabe.  I ordered it rare as they said that was the best way to eat the tuna.  I've never eaten Tuna this way before so I can only give you my opinion based on this first experience.  The texture of the Tuna as a rare dish is very delicious and I think I could never go back to canned tuna or eat it well done or medium or medium rare.  Rare is definitely the way to go.  By itself the taste is great and there is no fishy smell like I thought there would be.  It is also good with the soy ginger marinade.  Either way, it's very enjoyable.  I would eat the wasabi as is, just becareful not too put too much in your mouth as you'll burn off all your nose hairs.  I think that almost happened to me. As for the service, I was very impressed because they knew their menu and what to suggest for the evening.  For a restaurant like this, I was advised that all employees should know what they are serving.  The attentiveness was 100%.  When our wine was almost empty, they asked if we wanted another glass, or when our water was almost gone, it would be refilled immediately.  If there was a drought, we would never be thirsty here.   If I had a chance to take my family from out of town to take them to a nice dinner, it would be at Keefer's.  Thank you for the best experience.",0.9984,0.81,0.171,0.018,0.5716243386243386

I used the ladies restroom and it was clean and nice. I was escorted by another restaurant worker, as I did not know where it was.   I thought that was very nice, rather than simply pointing and letting me roam.   I need to figure out what brand the glass reed diffuser is, because it smelled lovely. We did not have dessert as we were both very full from our meals.  Overall, I would say we were very pleased with our dining experience.  I would not have the lobster bisque again, but that is simply a personal preference.  I think the steak, potatoes, and fish tacos were worth the high prices.  I would recommend a visit here and I would dine at Keefer's again.",0.9981,0.778,0.198,0.023,0.651904761904762

Service has been exemplary on each of my visits.  The first time I ventured in, almost two years ago now, was with my mother.  Her steak was ordered medium rare, but arrived somewhat significantly overcooked.  Not only did our server bring a new, impeccably cooked steak to our table in short order, but entirely eliminated her portion of the meal from the bill.  That's how you win repeat business and I will be bringing my family, friends, and colleagues to Keefer's whenever possible. Some tertiary observations: I very much like the aesthetic of the dining room and the neat collection of vintage radios.  The bar is fun, too, if you can't get a table or simply want to eat your meal there.

The only thing that could make it better if it was wrapped in bacon...Love me some bacon!! Steamed Mussels  Black Mussels steamed in Shallot, Garlic, & White Wine Cream - I love Mussels in Red, but this sauce worked.  It was more like an alfredo.  But if I have choose, I want my Italian red sauce..Mussels cooked perfectly and none missing the meat inside. Grilled Calamari Lightly Grilled on Flat Iron with Tomato Confit, Garlic, Balsamic Vinaigrette & Arugula - Never go wrong with griled Calamari..Perfectly cooked, with a little char on them to make them a little crispy... Dinner: We all got the Bone-In Ribeye, which was Larger Delmonico with Sweet Bone in Flavor.  I went with no extra seasoning, which at the end of the day was a mistake for me.  I like my steaks peppery and salty, so blackened is my go to, but I wanted to taste the untouched steak so I ordered normal.  Don't get me wrong it was good and I would order it again, but just blackended.   After Dinner: Had some after dinner drinks and got some cheesecake, it was so creamy and the strawberries and blueberries that came with it, knocked it out of the park. Overall great experience, but wouldn't say it was the best in the city.  Would I go back?? Sure I would..",0.9956,0.739,0.196,0.066,0.4897897897897898

It comes with your choice of an apple or housemade chips (amazing, seriously: thin cut, fried to perfection). The thing is huge and was aabout $8.50 with tax.  Other helpful things: the line doesn't move too quickly - so not your best bet if you are in a huge grab-n-go rush, there is a fair amount of seating, they do substitutions, they have a ""boxed lunch"" option that comes with a cookie and a side for $2.50 more.

And the stars Keefer's is getting from me is for their impeccable service and willingness to satisfy their diners. Also maybe for their mashed potatoes. :P My boyfriend made reservations at 830 and we called ahead to tell them we were running late. They were very understanding and told us it wouldnt be a problem. We came in, sat and waited maybe 10-15 min, I didn't mind waiting since we were late.  The server was very accommodating--answering every question I had. We both ordered the bone-in ribeye, lobster bisque and green beans. The lobster bisque was good but I've had better - lots of hints of like..nutmeg or cinnamon or something. Green beans, you really can't do those wrong unless you overcook - but you should really add garlic! Loved the garlic added on to it. Then the focus of the meal came out --- our ribeye. I was so excited to take the first bite but when I cut in, It looked more like a medium than a medium rare. I'm just one of those who cannot eat a steak that is over done and over done is medium to me. It's just a waste of a beautiful piece of meat if its not at least med rare! So I told the server, he quickly apologized and asked if I'd like them to redo it. of course i do! Maybe fifteen minutes later, the manager brought out a new ribeye, complimentary green beans n mashed potatoes. I was very very grateful for the thorough service. They checked up on our table a few times after that to make sure we were happy. The ribeye was good but I just wasn't blown away like I was when I went to Primehouse. Maybe it's the way they aged their beef or the cow itself but the texture of the steak was kind of crumbly even though done medium rare. I felt like around the outside of the steak, it was too overdone and then only when i got towards the center did it seem more like med. rare. It should be almost same throughout the entire cut shouldnt it?  It didn't melt in my mouth like I thought it would. I was kind of underwhelmed... The maitre d butter + seasonings on top of the steak was okay. Maybe it's just the way they age it. I heard it is wet-aged as opposed to dry aged there's a bit of a difference with the two. I don't know. I'm just unhappy that I didn't like this place as much as I wanted to! If you're looking for a really really delicious, great piece of steak, I'd go to David Burkes Primehouse. The 55 day dry aged ribeye, absolutely to die for - tender, melts in the mouth, exploding with natural flavor. The ribeye here? .. meh.

2011-04-05,4.0,"I'm so torn as to what to rate Keefer's due to the following reasons: Filet mignon - 3.5 stars. But for a price of $35 (although price doesn't include sides), it's pretty damn good but it could've been more ""melt-in-your-mouth"" type. Porterhouse - ? stars. All I saw was my friend across the table devouring this huge chunk of meat like a beastly carnivore. His entree came with a filet mignon and he claimed that both were cooked the perfect medium rare and bloody the way he likes it. Safe to assume it was a good piece of meat. Mashed potatoes - 5 stars. PERFECT level of creaminess and thickness sprinkled with bits of garlic on top. I couldn't stop eating my friend's bowl. Lobster bisque - 3 stars. You couldn't taste much lobster as you're more overwhelmed by the taste of evaporated milk and the lack of creaminess of the soup. It was very thin and not as flavorful as I'd hope. Although if you mix it a little more you'll discover bits of lobster at the bottom. Scottish salmon - 4.5 stars. Yes, yes I ordered fish at a steakhouse (I tend to do that because salmon is my preferred meat), but I thought it was cooked better than the filets--a little pink, but not too rare. The buttery cream with lentils and capers gives a light flavoring to the perfectly seared crust. Fries - 5 stars. I'm not a fry person but god damn I couldn't stop eating my friend's basket (this is why I didn't order my own sides). They were cut thin and at the perfect crunchiness without any of the greasiness. And portions were more than enough to share around the table. House salad - 4 stars. The mustard vinaigrette was pretty damn good, and this is coming from someone who doesn't like mustard. But I'd prefer the veggies to be chopped up more rather than in huge chunks. Service - 5 stars. Incredibly hospitable upon the moment you step in. Two of my friends ordered the filet mignon--a medium and a medium rare. When they cut theirs open, it looked more like medium well and a medium. And when they showed our waiter, he without hesitation took them back and ordered new ones. During their wait (and I was trying so incredibly hard not to quickly devour my salmon), the manager had swung by to apologize and to ask if they wanted any appetizers while they were waiting. They said no thanks, and later we found out their new filets were on the house! He had also brought an extra bowl of mashed potatoes on the house as well, probably because he saw me sneakily eating my friend's entire bowl. Needless to say, we definitely tipped a quite bit more.",0.9982,0.731,0.217,0.052,0.6122603586889301

I came here for Valentine's day with my girlfriend, and we were both in awe at the tremendously friendly people that greeted and cared for us throughout our meal.  We were both tremendously under-dressed (it seemed like everyone was in a suit or dress), but we did not let that hinder our evening's festivities.  The waiter was tremendously courteous and good, and his recommendations and care were second to none.  My GF is gluten-free, and he physically went back to the kitchen and asked the chef for suggestions, or if anything could be done to change some of the dishes.  She ordered a glass of Bordeaux-type wine (I cannot recall the name as it was French and long), but it was the best wine she has ever had, and at $12/glass, that is not a bad price.  As an appetizer, we ordered the grilled calamari (the waiter said it was his favorite) and then also three oysters on the half-shell that were served with a champagne sauce).  Both were phenomenal, but the calamari was by far the better of the two.  Moving on towards dinner, my GF was nearly stuffed (the portions are very good, plus the wine helped), so she got a steak salad and I got the roast veal chop with mushroom sauce.  Her steak salad was amazing.  The tenderloin was plentiful, and the salad as a whole was quite large.  Furthermore, the beef on her steak was quality through and through.  It was just sweet and you could tell that I should have gotten a steak (I'll be back).  My veal chop was quite large and the mushroom sauce was divine.  I had never had veal in this manner, and I think I now have a new favorite thing to look for.  Yes, it was that good.  After dinner is taken from your sight, the server brought out two truffles for each of us.  One was a simple chocolate truffle and the other a coconut truffle.  Both were absolutely perfect and went very well with our three scoops of homemade gelato (the best gelato in Chicago by far).  Parking was only ten for valet, so this place was a steal.  The steak salad was 16 or so, the veal chop about 36, the calamari 11, the oysters were 3/oyster, the gelato was 6, and the wine 12.  All things considered, it was the best place I have been to in a long time.  I will definitely be going back.",0.9984,0.781,0.207,0.012,0.5123937173937174

OK...enough about the pickles...all other food is great!!!  We usually start with the crabcakes which is another of my favorite and every dessert we have tried has been delicious!!!   We opt to eat in the little booths in the bar area.  We have tried eating in the restaurant portion twice, but the vibe just is not the same.  There are usually funny people and tourists hanging out at the bar so when we are done eating we usually just get up and step over to the bar and have some more drinks!!! We have only ever had 1 bad experience here and I am not really sure why or how it happened, but I believe it was due to a new server and I have never seen that server again.  We were there back last Christmas with my husband's sister at one of the little booths at the bar and after dinner 2 of our friend's joined us.  There was enough room for them to squeeze into the booth with all of us so we had about 2 drinks with them at the table.  One of our friends has a very LOUD laugh and she laughs a lot...I understand that that can be irritating to some.  However, all of the other patrons in the bar area were interacting with us and talking to us so we know that no one complained, but I think that our server may have been afraid that someone would so he was a bit ""odd"" to us.  He basically told us that we would need to leave soon and then asked ""You are going to still tip me, right?"".  Seriously???  We were tempted to only tip a minimum, but we love Keefer's so much and had so much fun up until that point that we went ahead and tipped our usual and figured karma would take care of the rest.

Again, they were cooked perfectly flavor choices not withstanding.   We shared the creamed spinach which was not as heavy as I thought it would be.  We also had the broccoli with crispy garlic which just needed a little more garlic (but in fairness we are garlic lovers so...)

2010-08-30,4.0,"my wife and i had a very nice lunch at keefer's last time we were in chicago. we were there on a weekday around noon, and were seated right away without a reservation. it is a fairly large Restaurant, with a more modern feel than many other steakhouses. we were seated in a nice table in the window, which made for some good people watching.  our server arrived with water and menus. we knew we wanted steak, so it did not take us long to make up our minds. i ordered the lunch ribeye, and the wife had the lunch fillet. the meal included a side and either a soup or salad. i had the lobster bisque, and she had a salad. i really enjoyed the bisque, her salad looked pretty run of the mill, but she said it was good.  after our soup and salad, a wonderful bread basket was delivered. there were a few different types of bread, with a pretzel style being the standout. after the bread, i place an order for a glass of cabernet to go with my steak. my wife thought it was too early for wine, and continued with her dr pepper.  the steaks were delivered shortly there after, both with a side of whipped potatoes. both cuts of meat were excellent. i would put them on the same level as ruth's chris, mortons, capital grille, etc, but a step below the dry aged meat with had at david burke's primehouse. the whipped potatoes were nothing special, but were certainly passable.  we skipped dessert, settled the bill, and headed off to the museum of science and industry. overall, keefers was a great spot for lunch, and i would definitely like to come back one day and get the full dinner experience.",0.9875,0.851,0.13,0.019,0.5124603174603175

We did the grilled calamari which was awesome and we tried some foie gras which was tasty.  The wine menu is Napa focused but they do have some good choices for italy/france. We did an argentina malbec for 35$ which was pretty good. The whipped potatoes were awesome as were the sauteed shrooms and sauteed spinach. They were nice enough to slice up my bone in ribeye which my wife and I were sharing, but it came out a bit cool.  They heated it up pretty quick without overcooking it and then bought all four of us dessert which I thought was above and beyond.

Once seated our server Emilie introduced herself and offered up a wine list that was quite impressive (according to my colleagues).  I, not knowing box wine from good wine handed the list to my friend who is fairly well versed; he then started into a conversation with Emilie that impressed me as she was able to point him towards a bottle that nailed what he was looking for dead on.  With respect to the entrees we had some questions for Emilie in which she was able to offer up answers; but at one point she had suggested that perhaps we'd enjoy speaking with John (Executive Chef).  We stated that this wasn't necessary, but within less than a minute John was standing at our table and educating us on the term ""Con Fit"" (did I mention the service was excellent?) Once the entrees arrived one of my friends had mentioned that his steak could be a bit warmer...this was jumped on immediately and resolved even quicker.  Upon returning we were informed that dessert was on them (What?  The restaurant wants to buy myself and my friends dessert because the steak was a tad cooler than what I had expected?  It wasn't burnt, it wasn't undercooked, it just lost a bit of heat from the kitchen to the table...unbelievable service!) Overall the food was fantastic and the service was impeccable...I would recommend this place to anybody looking to be treated like a king and fed food that will leave your taste buds asking for more.    Thank you Glenn, Emilie, and John for making this a memorable evening...I believe you have successfully turned another Joe's fan into a Keefer's fan...congrats!",0.9955,0.811,0.169,0.02,0.5525641025641026

I was worried because we were in jeans. Hubby doesn't care, but I'm always a bit self-conscious if everyone is in suits. The employees were definitely dressed upscale, and most of the customer were as well. We were one of only two other tables wearing jeans. Everyone else was in Khaki's or better (however, huge trade show in town and I recognized MANY of the people from the show, who had come straight and had not changed). Our waiter started out a bit stuffy and not very friendly. Perhaps he was worried we were out of our league (jeans I guess?), but we were very friendly and eventually he chilled out and ended up welcoming and friendly himself. I had the corn soup (assumed it was going to be chowder, but it was more like a bisque) garnished with chanterelles. Delicious. My husband had a curly endive salad with bacon and a poached egg in a really nice vinaigrette. He couldn't eat it all. Everything is ala carte, and pretty pricey. $45 for his ribeye, but he said it was the best steak he ever ate. I was in the mood for halibut (which is surprisingly hard to find in Chicago). $30. It came lightly crusted with crushed porcini mushrooms and bread crumbs. While it was a bit over-cooked, (it was a HUGE portion and very thick, so I forgave the chef) it was still very good. Came with a minute portion of tiny colored green beans and a lovely, light sauce. Hubby ordered the garlic mashed ($7 ?? a bit much) potatoes, but again, delicious.  We had two cocktails, soup/salad, main dish, one side dish, two glasses of wine, 1 dessert, 1 coffee. $164 (before tip). Prepare to spend if you go. We ate in the main dining area (would have preferred the bar area by the windows, but we were walk-ins and they were filled) but it was still very nice in there. A little loud.  We would go again, for a special occasion. While everything is ala carte, the portions were very large (could barely finish the halibut and my husband actually left about 3 bites of his steak.)

It's probably my fault for getting chicken at a steak place, but if you are going to have something on the menu, at least care enough to do it well. We got here just before noon on a weekday and were seated immediately. Also, almost as soon as we sat down, the bread and water arrived at our table. I have to say, the onion rolls were really good.  I ordered the roasted chicken with a side of the whipped potatoes, and the house salad to start. The house salad was a little to ""pretty"" for me. A lot of odd shaped leaves and flowery looking things. The house mustard vinaigrette was also a bit on the ""meh"" side of things. I ate only about a quarter of the salad... why fill up on rabbit food when you've got meat on the way? When the meat finally came, I was a little disappointed to find that my roasted chicken consisted of a thigh and a leg... for twenty some odd dollars. Really? you're going to give me one of the cheapest parts of the chicken and charge me (or rather, my co-worker) over $20 for it? The chicken wasn't even that great. I was hoping, since they decided to load me up with dark meat, that it would at least be nice and juicy. No dice. This was a little dry and lifeless, but at least the skin was crispy and tasty. The potatoes were ok, but they loaded them down with way too many chive bits.

He repeated this from that first bite until he was left staring at the naked bone before it was cleared from the table.

Gracious service from the host carried on to the bartender, and to our server and food runners throughout the evening.

Ambiance was nice - we liked the vibe, too. The wine list at the table was more of the same - affordable and varied, as was the menu itself. Our server shared the specials with us - all seafood, sounded wonderful - but we were there for the steak.  We ordered the grilled calamari to start, always a nice test of the kitchen's ability to REALLY cook skillfully, as well as a Kansas city strip steak to share, and sides of potato croquettes (which have garnered rapturous praise from fellow Yelpers!) and spinach. So how was the food? I have to stop here and say that we tried to be critical. Honestly, we did. But there wasn't a SINGLE THING to find fault with. The calamari was perfectly prepared and beautifully plated. The steak was worthy of eye rolling and bold exclamations on the part of my husband (not faint praise!) and the croquettes were gorgeous. Melt in your mouth soft and super tasty. The service was unfailingly consistent: attentive but not overbearing. We never sat with empty plates or glasses for more than a moment or two. We really, really REALLY enjoyed our meal. Ended with the chocolate pudding which, after devouring (how did I have room?!?), makes me feel very strongly that all meals end with chocolate pudding.

2010-04-02,4.0,"There are few things better than eating outside on one of the first warm spring days of the season. I met my ex for lunch today at the last minute and he suggested Keefers' as he lives nearby and noticed that they had already set up their outdoor seating and had tables available. I've been here for both lunch and dinner many times. The last time I was here was with Keri H and another friend back in December and well, let's just say, I don't remember anything about what was eaten that night. Got there right at high noon and snagged a table in prime sun exposure. Sat down and looked at the menu. There's little difference between the lunch and dinner menus, other than the dinner prices are jacked up. I wasn't super hungry; mostly I just wanted to be outside and feel the warmth on my skin; the food was secondary. The ex had always deferred to me on all things food, and while we're no longer a couple, bless his heart, that hasn't changed. He lets me order whatever I want and happily goes along with it. We ended up ordering light: an appetizer, a side, and a salad. For the appetizer, we got Steak Diane (little ditty 'bout Steak and Diane - sorry for the bad pun, blame Susan D). This is a dish I used to order at the now-defunct Pump Room when I was a little girl. It's considered retro, but I'm not really sure why. It's basically tenderloin, cooked with mushrooms in a brandy and mustard sauce.  Keefer's nails this dish. It was cooked perfectly and they use an assortment of mushrooms to keep it from being boring. The sauce could have had more ooomph, but it was still really well prepared. Next up was a Caesar Salad. Not the best Caesar I've had, but I prefer a lighter dressing than one that is white and gloopy. This one had none of that garlicky bite that I love about a Caesar, and there was little parmesan in it as well. But what stole the show was the side: Pommes Frites and Onion Strings. Two of my favorite fried things in one basket. Just greasy and salty enough. Crispy. Heavenly. Their fries are as good as McDonald's and I say that with no derision whatsoever. I could have eaten that entire basket by myself, but then I would have had no room for the decadent dessert that awaited me. Dessert. Chocolate Pudding. Sinful and creamy and chocolaty. It's a huge portion so I had to exercise some self-control not to devour the whole bowl. It's served with the fluffiest whipped cream, a shortbread cookie and shaved bittersweet chocolate on top. Absolute decadence. In short, a great meal. I am probably rating Keefer's higher than normal as the beautiful weather may have clouded my judgment a bit, but it's a unique take on the ubiquitous steakhouses so prevalent in this area. I highly recommend Keefer's. Steak lovers and those who want something else will both be satisfied.",0.9947,0.795,0.145,0.06,0.5273233737939619

Dinner: I ordered the mahi-mahi, which came with a delectable, creamy orange sauce and hazelnuts (I think?), devine!  My brother ordered the smaller fillet.  I don't like it when dishes like this are a la carte (although common in these types of places I suppose).  Still, I'm ordering a $30 piece of fish, give me some mashed potatoes with it, come on!  Same for the even more expensive fillet.  We did end up ordering side dishes anyway ($6-9 each), whipped mashed potatoes and asparagus - both great.   I really enjoyed our dinner here, but I kept thinking afterward, that we could have gone to a nearby Brazilian steakhouse instead and paid slightly less for a lot lot more food.  Keep that in mind if you're looking for a nice steak dinner.  Because by going to another steakhouse instead thinking it's cheaper than the ave. $50/person at a Brazillian place (our initial money-saving thought), you'll still end up spending about the same... or more, in our case.",0.9976,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.5718137254901959
2010-03-28,2.0,"I ate at Keefer's last night with my girlfriend and her Aunt and Uncle. I had heard a lot of great things about Keefer's, but I left the restaurant a bit unimpressed.  The atmosphere was fine, and the staff were very polite. However, I did think the location of the bar was a little strange... you had to walk through the dining room to get to it and it seemed a little uninviting to patrons not looking to sit in the main dining room (however, this could be much different in the summer when the patio is open). The menu itself was not traditional steakhouse, but more of a blend of an American Bistro and a steakhouse. For appetizers we ordered the calamari with spicy mayo and the fried onion and frites (for some reason we had a mental lapse and ordered two fried items). Personally, I thought the calamari had a funky taste and the fried onion strings were too greasy. The frites were very good though. I had the Kansas City Strip Steak and Hogan's Peas for my entree. The steak was good, but no better than something I could make on my own. The Hogan's Peas were great and definitely the highlight of my meal. I didn't try any of the other entrees, but my girlfriends uncle ordered the fish and chips and it looked amazing.

We ordered a chocolate lava cake for the table and the small spoonful I did have was out of this world good.

2010-03-18,4.0,"As Crain's Chicago Business noted, ""where you take clients for lunch is a reflection on you,"" and Keefers does nothing but give a good impression!  I was delighted to learn that some prospective mentors offered to treat me for lunch at Keefers, because I normally pass by the restaurant longingly hoping to validate an expensive lunch there.  To my surprise, Keefers prices are not that bad! There are entrees under $20 that will fill you to the brim comfortably. I barely grazed that mark by ordering the Seafood Pot Pie (Lobster, Shrimp, Mussels & Fish Baked in a Flaky Pastry Crust with Fresh Vegetables & Fennel Broth) which cost $19.95.  Before I tell you about the pot pie, note that these lunch entrees come with a starter salad with your choice of dressing. I HIGHLY recommend the mustard dressing which, though it looks creamy, has no cream (ask the waiter to explain this to you). I also really liked the assortment of bread they brought out, which included pretzel bread.  Ordering pot pies is risky. Sometimes you get something that is soupy and tastes like Campbell's, and sometimes you want to throw the puff pastry like a Frisbee because it's so bad. This was NOT the case with the Seafood Pot Pie! The stew portion was just right, not too soupy, but thick like a jambalaya. The puff pastry was like a croissant.  Part of what you pay for is the fantastic ambiance. The restaurant consists of two differently decorated wings (one with really cool old radios), a main area with a round bar, and outdoor seating. I also appreciated our waiter for being well-timed, not overbearing, and gracious for our two hour lunch.  I'd also like to give regards to the interior decorator and brand manager for Keefer's. I like the logo and font they use for their brand. I also like the theme of light blue glasses in the restaurant decor and on the tables as water glasses. It's refreshing.

They often wet or dry age and broil the cut at high temps to sear in the juices and slightly char the exterior. The things that truly define each establishment are the atmosphere, the service, and the sides. Keefer's dominates on all fronts.  On each visit I've had very courteous service without the staff going overboard. The atmosphere is best explained as non-Gibson's, but not overly romantic either. A nice medium that can fit all occasions. The potato croquettes are the best side dish in the city. Whipped potato interior and a crispy exterior crust. Covered with a little cheese and parsley for color. Outstanding! The Kansas City Strip is my cut of choice prepared medium. I'm generally a medium rare guy, but they are always a little under cooked when going that route.  They have a nice wine selection with some nice value bottles in the $28-$37 range.

The reason why I bring up the environment is that Keefers is truly a top notch, traditional restaurant.  This is not a 5-year restaurant like a lot of the places downtown- you know the places, steakhouses that last 5 years and then become more of a joke to Chicagoans, a place where suburbanites come for a night in the city instead of Outback Steakhouse.   Keefers is a true top-notch, wear a suit or evening dress to dinner kind of place that is destined to become an ""old standard"" in Chicago.  You just get the feeling at Keefers that everyone cares about making sure you are having a top-notch experience, from the hostess to the bartenders to the waiters.  I recently stopped in after work with some coworkers for ""one drink"" and we wound up having several perfect, ice cold drinks and then sat down and had dinner.  Keefers is one of those never-fail places I can recommend to friends and coworkers and know that I won't hear bad news the next day.",0.9934,0.772,0.212,0.017,0.5828585600907029

Note: for those who don't read my reviews..a basket of bread is my FAV...i love carbs  Anyway, the waiter was very attentive and we ordered 1 small filet mignon for me, a porterhouse for him (both medium) and 1 side of mashed potatoes and 1 side of Hogan's peas.

Most of the people were dressed up like as if they had come straight from work and it seemed like a lot of people were on business dinners. It was good enough for me!  One star is deducted because once my steak came out it was really dry except for this light pink center. Dunno what happened cuz i tried my boyfriend's steak and it was perfect. I assumed that maybe they threw both of our steaks together and then took them off when my boyfriend's was done...but his steak was almost double the size of mine. I should have asked to bring it back but part of my mind didn't want to have to wait for another. By that time, the restaurant was already packed.  The sides that we chose were ok.

2009-07-27,4.0,"Keefer's is a well thought out local steakhouse.  We had no problems getting a Saturday reservation (on Venetian Night) a few hours in advance; the front end was friendly and quick to seat us.  The restaurant was spacious with plenty of space between tables and it started to fill up during our dinner (which started at 7:30). Our waitress was a little green but the service was very attentive.  She was able to answer any questions we had and was truthful in acknowledging checking her notes when we asked about a few of their wine selections.  Another waitress who brought the wine inquired about our visit intrusively, and subtly arranged a candle for our dessert later (as it was a birthday). Drinks were very well done; Manhattans and martinis were made exactly to order (and well priced;  the Manhattan was only 8.00!).  They offer 6 and 10oz varieties for the cocktails. For appetizers, we had the smoked salmon and the ""hearts of palm and iceberg"" salad.  The smoked salmon came atop of a potato croquette.  This was a miss; the croquette was overly large, a touch greasy and overwhelmed the salmon.  The salmon and horseradish was good but we left most of the potato alone.  The salad was a typical steakhouse salad: a quarter of a head of lettuce, with a few palm hearts and a nice thousand island dressing.  I would recommend dropping at least 75% of the croquette for the smoked salmon dish.   I went with the fish special that night: a pekoe-crab crusted hake with a tomato and celery root sauce.  It was perfectly cooked and delicious; a well thought entree at a steakhouse.  I wouldn't worry here about having a non-beef entree. My date went with the filet mignon and thought it was excellent; few places that offer filet mignon ever get it wrong and Keefer's is no exception.  It was cooked to specification, and they were explicit about how it was prepared.

2009-07-12,2.0,"This was one of the most disappointing dining experiences I have had in Chicago in a very long time.  Let me give Keefer's its due, though.  I had dinner at the bar at about 8:45 on a Wednesday evening.  That's not an ideal set of circumstances for any restaurant to put its best foot forward.  Also, because it took so long for my food to come out of the kitchen they gave me my second glass of wine for free.  I certainly appreciated the gesture.  Unfortunately, that gesture and my server/bartender's good nature were not nearly enough to overcome the poor food quality and ineffective service.   I should have walked out of the restaurant as soon as I arrived, for things got off to a terrible start.  Upon entering the restaurant I walked to the host's stand and waited as two individuals (the manager and the host?) carried on a conversation about some table's tab.  As I stood there I received no greeting, no acknowledgment of my presence, nothing... I just stood there.  After they finished the conversation the host finally turned to me and asked me if he might help me.  I asked if I could sit and the bar and get dinner, and he said that wouldn't be a problem.  So, I wandered into the bar and took a seat.   The bar area at Keefer's is a gorgeous space.  The lighting and the decor are really first rate.  I had read so many good reviews of Keefer's on Yelp that I was really looking forward to eating a great meal in such a beautiful restaurant.  The positives stopped at the decor, though. After I took a seat at the bar I waited to be greeted or recognized.  No luck.  I sat, and sat, and sat.  After what I think was about two minutes of having several different bartender/servers walk by me without saying anything to me I decided to pay attention to the clock.  Nearly six minutes elapsed before I was acknowledged.  Think about that... A restaurant that's only moderately busy (there were six patrons at the bar), servers constantly passing by you at the bar, and you sit there for more than five minutes without anyone saying a word to you.  Totally bizarre.   When I was finally greeted the guy who served me was really nice and very personable, but it turned out that he wasn't particularly good at multi-tasking.  He brought me my glass of wine, and he took my order.  I requested the house salad, the filet - medium rare, and steamed spinach.  The salad came out fairly quickly, but it came out before I had silverware or a ""napkin"" place mat that they use for patrons dining at the bar.  Not a big deal at all, but it was indicative of how things were going to go.  After I got the salad I wasn't asked if I wanted pepper for the salad, and I didn't have access to salt/pepper.  I also wasn't given or offered bread.  The patron three seats down from me was given bread as soon as he had placed his order.  I would have asked for bread, but my server disappeared to the other end of the bar after he placed the salad in front of me.  The salad was good but not particularly memorable.  But, it was the highlight of the meal.  The salad was everything that the menu promised, but it is hard to make a collection of greens with a vinaigrette a memorable salad.     The wait for my main corse was really lengthy.  I didn't even bother keeping track of how long it took; I just knew that I was hungry and tired of sitting at the bar waiting... When the food finally arrived, it was a total disappointment.  The spinach was undercooked (which was better than the alternative I suppose).  I finally asked to be given the salt/pepper because the spinach seemed to have been cooked without any seasoning at all.  The filet, unfortunately, was overcooked.  The filet came out medium - it wasn't even close to being medium rare.  The steak's flavor wasn't noteworthy, either.  Keefer's seasoning was nothing remarkable, and the meat's quality was really not what I would have expected from a high end steak house.  Of course, it's possible that the steak's quality was masked by the fact that it had been overcooked.    The evening wrapped up... slowly.  It took a while to get my bill and to pay, but that was consistent with the way that the evening had gone.  At the end of the day, if I had been in an Outback or Longhorn steak house - and I had paid 30 dollars for the meal and the glass of wine instead of 60 - then I would have been reasonably satisfied with my experience.  But, when you pay $30 for the piece of meat and $6 for the spinach you expect that it will be cooked properly.  Moreover, you expect the service at a top end steak restaurant to be better than what you would receive in a chain restaurant that you go to at an exit off of the interstate.  I've only been to Keefer's once, so it is entirely possible that I was there on an off night, but I don't intend to return.  For this kind of money, Chicago has too many fantastic steakhouses that run circles around Keefer's.",0.9765,0.877,0.075,0.048,0.6005632716049383

I had the filet mignon au poivre, which was excellent: cooked perfectly to order, very tender, and with just the right amount of spice. The lobster bisque was a bit of a letdown. I thought Hugo's had better lobster bisque, with more lobster and less liquid. I also thought the creamed spinach was a bit runny and less flavorful than I had expected.

The place was packed on a Monday, 7 sharpish; a bit surprised, but our server advised there was a packaging convention in town bringing in over 50K people...or packagers...or whatever, just glad we made an Open Table on-line resy.  We were seated immediately and sat in the main dining area in a very nice, comfy and cozy booth. The space was one of the reasons I chose Keefer's and it did not disappoint.  Dark hardwood floors and black leather booths are contrasted nicely with sleek lines and curves with modern appointments and fixtures...this ain't your grandparent's steakhouse, that's for sure, and while it was very busy, the noise level was subdued. Great bread choices and spreads start you out and I chose a Knob Creek Manhattan to kick things off, it was fantastic.  For food starters, I was dying for and absolutely loved the lobster bisque; velvety smooth, great flavor with some nice chunks of premium lobster, truly a decadent no brainer if you're a fan of such soup.  Missus went with the Caesar and it was heavily dressed and overall lacked flavor, not terrible but just ok.  For the main I  went with the (IMO) only real choice for a Prime cut, the bone-in Ribeye, she chose the NY Strip.  All steaks at Keefer's are wet aged for 21 days and come seasoned with salt and pepper only and topped off with Maitre D butter. You can get them with any of the three available sauces (bordelaise, bernaise or hollandaise), I chose none, the wife had the bordelaise, which was pretty intense in flavor, not bad though I preferred to eat it without. Both steaks were cooked to a perfect Med Rare and had an excellent char on the outer layer.  Very juicy, flavorful and pretty much perfect.  The Ribeye clearly packed more flavor punch but that's no surprise given its higher marble content when compared to the leaner strip. I would rate the Ribeye an easy 4 star, bordering close to a 5, and the Strip a solid 4.  The crispy potato cake side was pretty forgettable and an afterthought to an otherwise fairly amazing meal. Paired our steaks off with Chicago Mag article's suggested '07 Dona Pena Malbec and at $35 a bottle, an absolute bargain, it was outstanding. Our server Lora was terrific; very knowledgeable, friendly, efficient, everything you want in a server and nothing you don't.  We were also greeted by one of the two Keefer owners who run the place; he asked how our meal was and if he could get us anything (get us anything, really? wow, nicely done). Finished the meal with a complimentary chocolate cake with a molten chocolate center which just put the nail in this culinary coffin's journey.  A perfect sweet ending to a perfectly sweet dining experience.   [x] will be back",0.9995,0.703,0.276,0.021,0.6430515297906602

2007-10-24,3.0,"I am torn between three and four stars for this place. The food is closer to four stars but the service was not great. Three it is. We stared with the crab cake, which was wonderful and ever so sweet. Try it, you will like it. I ordered the organic salmon, which was just so so. It was supposed to be topped with a horseradish potato concoction but they forgot to add the horseradish. We finished with the creme bruele, which was of the orange and dark chocolate variety. It was amazing. I loved everything about it. Try it...but skip the salmon. The service from our waiter was poor. He did not explain the specials to us but rather he told us to read them on the specials card. Not cool Sir, not cool at all. Additionally, we would ask for five more minutes and he would return in two. As I was ordering a glass of wine, we were interrupted by another waiter who was convinced that our waiter had stolen his order of crab cakes. It was all very awkward. However, I must give credit where credit is due. The owner of the restaurant greeted us and visited us twice as we ate our meal. It was great because he did not simply ask how the food was but he had an actual conversation with us. All in all, not bad, and hopefully...if you have a different waiter...your experience will be better.",0.9829,0.743,0.174,0.082,0.6249338624338624

Waiter we had tonight was excellent and quite knowledgable. I had to try the lobster bisque to compare it to the ""orgasmic"" lobster bisque I had the night before.  While I didn't quite ""lose it"" over the bisque, it was good...just not as thick or creamy as I prefer. The same was true for the small filet.  A wonderful piece of meat that order med. well so as not to have it too red...it certainly was medium well (I should have asked for medium...my fault for erring on the overcooked side). Creamed spinach was good but certainly not the best I have ever had. Martinis (Grey Goose, straight up with as many blue cheese stuffed olives they can fit in a glass) was PERFECT as usual.

2007-07-14,3.0,"Unimpressive.  I don't get the hype around Keefer's.  It seems overly expensive for average downtown restaurant food.  I went there for lunch yesterday and ordered the Spinach & Roasted Tomato Ravioli (which is what I ordered the only other time I was there).  For a non-meat eater, there aren't many options.  The ravioli is delicious, especially since I don't even like most ravioli.  It's served with a choice of lemon oil or tomato sauce (I chose the tomato), and has arugula, cubes of mozzarella, and roasted red pepper on top (god I love arugula).   However, I was severely disappointed with the salad I had pre-entree.  According to the menu, it was supposed to be mixed greens.  According to the server, it was supposed to have a Dijon vinaigrette on it.  The salad that arrived was predominantly iceberg lettuce (some of which was brown) and the dressing was more like a creamy honey mustard.  Bleh.  There were two grape tomatoes with the salad that looked like they had been stepped on in the kitchen.  Next time I'll opt for the soup. The bar area is really cool though and I would love to come hang out here after work for some drinks (probably a bit on the pricer side though).",0.5666,0.854,0.077,0.069,0.5485294117647058

The service was good - no complaints there.  The desserts were less than impressive, except for the carrot cake, which was delicious.  Also, there were little flies, or gnats or something, flying around us the entire lunch, which I have absolutely no tolerance for.  No place that serves $40 steaks should have flies buzzing around. For this type of dining experience, I'd suggest Morton's, or Capital Grille, or Gibsons, or Ruths Chris, or Joe's Stone Crab (the list goes on) way before Keefer's.",0.8492,0.82,0.106,0.074,0.5916666666666666
