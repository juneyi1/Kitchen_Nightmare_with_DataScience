It is BYOB with no corkage fee and the menu is on-line so I was able to match wine to the items we were most interested in that day. My pasta was memorable and my wife's fish was delicious. I will not forget the 3 chocolate mousse in a strawberry marmalade any time soon. We are taking my epicurean brother there next weekend for our quarterly food challenge. I have won already!

2013-02-01,3.0,"since this place is pretty much a hop, skip and a jump from our place, i wanted to love it. and i DID love what i ordered (on the server's reco, btw), which was a pistachio- and pepita-crusted tilapia w/vanilla bean nage. also came with lovely crisp-tender green beans, roasted sweet peppers & tomatoes, soft red onions. DELICIOUS. didn't know what to expect from the nage. i was nervous it would amount to an herb-y, melted vanilla ice cream. boy was i wrong. while the vanilla flavor couldn't be ignored, the smooth cream possessed an acidity that perfectly complemented the fish, whose mild flavor itself was heightened with the crunch of the pepitas and pistachios--neither of which i care for terribly. but it was all a pretty harmonious bite. i question the necessity of the tomatoes, but since i generally like tomatoes, i was ok with them. their flavor might be a bit strong for the nage's subtle, yet deft, symphony. the fish may also have been a tad over for my taste, but both (minor) sins easily forgiven. our boy was very pleased with his mac & cheese/chicken tender combo. mac was definitely a more sophisticated iteration, and the chicken was, well, tender and flavorful. no complaints there. husband's ravioli, however--a different story. cheese filling was unremarkable, almost unnoticeable, in fact. pasta itself was unevenly cooked, with a fair amount bordering on the unpleasantly chewy. but i'd say the main offense was the tomato sauce--a complex, but unpleasant, sort of eggplant-y flavor that lingered beyond the meal.  service was pleasant. no qualms with the decor--it's fine enough. all things considered, i think pricing was on the high side for what we received, even despite the disappointing noodles.",0.9913,0.711,0.211,0.078,0.6540170940170937

2012-12-31,3.0,"I sort of wanted to give Al Dente a 2-star rating, but there is an extra star here, for... POTENTIAL.  I want them to succeed so badly.  The area around the restaurant (my area) is bereft of really nice places to eat, and Al Dente could be really nice. Rundown! The Good: *Our waitress was very attentive, if a little awkward (she seemed nervous... but it was kind of cute.) *The habanero aioli that comes with their fries is to die for.  I would put it on anything.  I would eat it forever.  Tears were streaming out of my eyes from the heat and also from pure joy. *The Steak Tagliata with crushed new potatoes was very well-cooked, and the potatoes were great.  Not too rosemary-y, which is good because my Mom doesn't like rosemary, but she ordered it anyway. *BYOB! *They don't skimp on the portions.  Hooray! *They have churros on the dessert menu.  They are good churros. The Not-So-Good: * The cream of mushroom soup of the day was just passable.  It wasn't great.  Under-salted, and this is not the kind of place that has salt on the table, so I felt like an arse asking for some.  (But I did.) * The gnocchi.  Oh, lord, the gnocchi.  Butternut squash gnocchi with roasted root vegetables in sage butter?  Sounds amazing.  But instead of crisp little pillows, we got heavy and doughy nuggets that I'm pretty sure were undercooked, and the sauce was just buttery without nuance - almost greasy.  There were other spices involved, but nothing really HELPED.  Finishing the plate was a struggle. * The brandied apple fritters were just awful.  They were soggy and they were neither sweet nor salty... just bland.  And the brandy just sort of made the whole dish taste sort of fermented instead of pleasantly boozy.  Skip.  Get the churros instead. * The bill.  This place is ESS-PEN-SIVE.  I am willing to pay a lot of money for a great meal, but it really felt like we were paying for the POTENTIAL more than what we actually received.   I really want to love this place.  Game needs to be upped!  Up it!",0.9934,0.729,0.181,0.089,0.6291108762038994

2012-11-10,4.0,"We went to Al Dente for the first time earlier this week. Our experience got off to a bit of a shaky start. The server asked if we wanted ice water or sparkling water and we chose sparkling water. She disappeared and a few minutes later a young man filled our water glasses with ice water. We were worried this lack of communication amongst the staff would affect the rest of our experience. However, they recovered nicely. The food was very good. The gaspacho was very fresh with a nice spicy backbone. My wife doesn't typically like gaspacho but she liked this. I loved it. The gnocchi appetizer was clearly handmade and done very well. It was served with root veggies (rutabaga and parsnip) and butternut squash in a sage brown butter sauce. I'd swear there was some cinnamon in there too. Very tasty. My wife had the Mar y Tierra, whitefish and pork belly with brussel sprouts and rutabaga puree. It seemed like an odd version of surf and turf at first glance but it really worked. The pork belly had a lovely maple glaze and was very tender. The fish was cooked perfectly. I had the hanger steak and couldn't have been more pleased with the dish. The meat was cooked properly and seasoned perfectly. It melted in my mouth. The smashed potatoes were great. Crispy skins with soft insides made a nice combination of textures. When they bring the dish out it gets noticed as it is served on one of those metal plates that is smoking hot. The meat and oil are still sizzling and popping when they set the dish in front of you. Yes, I've seen this done many times with fajitas and similar dishes but it does catch your attention. For dessert we had the flan and the brandy apple fritters. I'm a sucker for flan and this one was really good. The fritters were fresh and hot and delicious. The only thing preventing me from giving five stars is the pricing. $100 for dinner for two without drinks (they are BYOB and charge no corkage fee, which I like) is a bit steep in Old Irving Park. I'd love to make this a place we'd go to with some frequency, but at that price point it's going to be once or twice a year.",0.997,0.762,0.186,0.052,0.5792857142857144

The squash bread pudding was out of this world.  BY FAR the best bread putting I have ever had.  I could have licked the plate clean. The flan special was also delicious.  BYOB with no corkage fee. Now on to a couple glitches: The seafood cataplana was way over-salted.  I think that really masked the amazing flavors of the dish.  Pretty sure it was just the broth that was over-salted and not the seafood or lemon couscous but the dish was swimming in the broth.   There were a few service errors.  It seemed like things were not coordinated well.  I understand that it was a semi-busy night and hope that these issues will be worked out next time we go.",0.9513,0.797,0.161,0.041,0.5506448412698413

Then, we move on to the things that make me not eager to return: - Service was friendly... when we had service. It was slow. No one checked on us. Waters sat empty. Plates weren't bussed. It is almost unheard of at a restaurant that charged $20+ for an entree to leave dirty plates at the table when you've returned with a swiped credit card. - The prices: a little bit high for the neighborhood. $21 for my linguini dish. $23 for a vegetarian butternut squash gnocchi. (The shrimp diavolo linguini at La Gondola is $19 and comes with a soup/salad and bread - I find the atmosphere of the two places comparable). - The gnocchi wasn't very good.

I would have liked the skin to be less fatty and more crispy. I also think the risotto was a bit under cooked for my liking.

2012-09-13,4.0,"We had a reservation at 8pm, and the staff greeted us with a smile right when we walked in. I'm liking this place already, I thought. They seated us next to the window, but there's not much to see outside. The neighborhood can look a little sketchy, I think. The atmosphere inside, however, was intimate and romantic. I like feeling as though I've stepped into a different world, and I'm not sure how I felt about being seated next to the window, but in the end, it was fine. We had looked forward to ordering their mac and cheese based on Yelp's highlighted recommendation, but unfortunately they had discontinued it.  As we came in with a Groupon on a weeknight, we got a free bowl of gazpacho with tortilla chips and guacamole. The tomato-based gazpacho was okay; I much prefer the avocado gazpacho I had a long time ago from a different restaurant. I thought Al Dente's tasted too similarly to salsa (Is this what the tomato-based ones are supposed to taste like?) and it was a little too weird for me.  In addition, we ordered the beet salad (with watercress, almond slices, and goat cheese), gnocchi, and fries for appetizers. I'm a fan of beets, so I like the beet salad a lot. I wish they had given us a bit more watercress to balance out the sweetness of the beets though. The gnocchi were also good, but the cured meat was a bit too salty for my date and me (and he has a much higher tolerance for salty food than I do). The fries came with a habanera  aioli sauce. It was very good.  For our entree, we ordered the lamb to share. I wasn't that fond of the lamb taquitos because I thought they were a little too hard and bland. I couldn't taste the lamb. I, however, loved the lamb chops. We ordered it medium, and it was so juicy and good. It was probably my favorite part of the meal. Our server was also very nice and sweet, and I like the speed with which they cleared our plates on our little table. These portions are by no means small.

We didn't have dessert but had coffee to finish up the meal.  It was good, better than average, but not fantastic.  Also on the negative side, our waiter was ridiculously difficult to understand.  He had a thick acccent and spoke very quickly.  He may have been new, and was very nice and repeated things when we asked, but we also stopped asking because it was just so difficult.  Other downside--I felt that the menu was too small.  I understand not having an extensive menu, but it just felt a little unimpressive...I wish it had a few more options for entrees at least.  It is BYOB, so that helps with the money side of things, but I'd personally choose to go to The Portage and pay for each drink because their food and service are just so much better.  Saying that makes me a little sad, though, because I really wanted Al Dente to be another spot I love in the area...but I don't know how often I'd go back given my experience.",0.7538,0.769,0.122,0.109,0.5501515151515153
2012-08-25,5.0,"Great location for outstanding food.   Off the beaten path.  They could do a bit to work on their atmosphere, not that its bad, but it just is not on the same level as their food.   My wife and I shared a beet salad (excellent if you like beets).  I had the white fish sautéed with bacon and clams.  There may have been a touch too much bacon for my tastes, but otherwise it was great, and the fish was perfectly cooked.   My wife had the lobster ravioli (Maine lobster, scallion, garlic, sweet corn, lobster reduction, broccoli, crispy shallots).  My only complaint there was that it was their cheese ravioli (which are also on the menu as a separate entree) with lobster chunks and the rest of the accouterments instead of lobster filled ravioli.  Though this wasn't really a bad thing (lobster was plentiful and cooked right), I was just expecting it inside the ravioli.  Like I said the atmosphere isn't bad, it's just that the food is at such a high level, that an improvement in atmosphere would just compliment the whole package.   Things I would change:   The music - on the night we were there they were playing the Adele cd.  Not bad music, but just didn't fit the vibe of the place.  A nice recording of a three piece jazz combo would work much better.  Even better (though I know there's a cost associated with it), have a live small jazz combo on the weekends.  It would really take the place up a notch, and there isn't anything like it in the area.     The service -  again the service isn't bad. Our waitress was very pleasant, but she wasn't trained in fine dining.  I'm not saying I want a stuffy or pretensions server, a good fine dining server should be neither of those.  But small things like table side manners, how you uncork and pour wine, replacement of silverware in between courses (not saying mandatory silverware replacement, but if I leave my fork on my plate when you go to pick it up, and I have another course coming, just replace my fork with a clean one).  Sweating some of these details matters at this price point.

Had previously tried Al Dente a year ago and found the restaurant a great  option for a place convenient to both city residents and friends on the north shore. We ordered a variety of appetizers and main courses including salads, soup, pastas and fish and found the food to be fresh, carefullyl prepared, perfectly seasoned and served. My apprehensions about the restaurant not being full were quickly set aside and we had a leisurely diner over the wines we brought to accompany our meals.   Pedro was our waiter and offered helpful suggestions and provided the perfect pacing for a beautiful summer weekend night.  I encourage you to try Al Dente; you will be please by the excellent food that is perfectly prepared blending Italian food with subtle Mexican influences.  Our tab for the night was approximately $30 per person including tax and tip.",0.991,0.766,0.224,0.01,0.4766666666666667

We started with the calamari steak and mussels.  The ""steak"" version of calamari is actually really tasty and the mussels had a really flavorful sauce.  For entrees, I have sampled the following (yep, they are ranked): 1) Steak (cooked perfectly medium, tons of flavor) 2) Pork Chop (best pork chop EVER) 3) Lobster Ravioli (delicious sauce, fully stuffed) 4) Salmon (salmon was cooked well, adobo crust was a little odd--not a fan of the house made chorizo, raw lima beans, and blah negro sauce) 5) Gnocchi ( I hate gnocchi--always have, always will) For dessert, I sampled the bread pudding, but it was nothing to write home about. Minus the salmon, I am a fan of Al Dente. Great appetizers (I still need to try the mac and cheese and the salads!) and good steak and pork.

When we got there at 7:30 in the evening we were the only people in the joint until another couple showed up. I had the stuffed calamari appetizer which was extremely chewy with a seafood stuffing that really didn't have a lot of taste. My wife had a cream of cauliflower soup which was pretty good. For our main course she had the salmon which was just okay and I had the lamb chops which I order medium ""pink"" and came out blood red so I had to send them back to finish cooking. They were okay but I have had much better. So all of this with no drinks for a whopping total of $90. Bottom line is I likely won't go back again as there is another restaurant right across the street called Bread and Wine which has excellent ambiance, very friendly service and great food.

The special calamari app, the dessert (bread pudding), and the coffee did not reach the level of amazing, like the other dishes, but were solid.

I'll admit the flautas i could've done without, but the lamb chops were soooo good, perfectly seasoned and grilled perfectly.  My wife ordered the three cheese ravioli, she doesn't normally like ravioli, but took a chance and she was very happy with her order... it was a fresh chunky tomato sauce with a basil pesto that I think made her day.  We also ordered a side of their hand cut fries, mainly because we both love fries and it came with a habanero aioli... it had a kick which was perfect for those seasoned fries.  I highly recommend checking this place out.  Next time I will order dessert, I blame my wife for convincing me that I was full.  Damn her, but go to Al Dente and remember to bring some drinks with you.",0.9948,0.754,0.206,0.04,0.5481159420289855

The food deserves better. Service - both visits our service was slightly off- very nice and I appreciated the appropriate timing between courses, but at both visits we were left waiting for long stretches of time to order.

Whoever's comment earlier said that we will be looking for this chef on tv soon is correct- the whole restaurant experience is perfect. It's been a while since I have left a restaurants feeling this way which makes me feel like a couple of my ratings are a bit inflated but this place deserves every star all the way. Our waiter said that Chef Javie changes the menu for the freshest fish and proteins he can find. He said his menu had just changed. We started with the calamari and mushrooms appertizer. The calamari is grilled and is excellent. Comes with aioli and potatoes. It is is decadent and perfectly cooked- not chewy or too soft just right! The mushrooms were on top of polenta and were with cheese. We were left using ur bread to spood out whatever was left of this dish- also exquisit. We had the short-rib and the lamb chops. I ordered by lamb chops medium rare and Chef Javie delivered- well seasoned and cooked to a perfect rare in the center with a medium crust. The fig aioli was a very unique compliment to the meat. Additionally, you get two lamb empenadas with saffron aioli- also decadent. The empenadas are not greasy but are flaky and buttery. These were some of the best plated and best cooked lamb chops I have ever had. the short rib was so tender that it did not require a knife. It was plated with garlic mash and brocollini. The protein was perfectly cooked and tastes extremely fresh. Btw, everything tasted fresh which is a testament to a true restaurant that cares about what they put before customers. It is BYOB and a $5 dollar corking fee for up to 2 bottles. We figured that with a menu so good, the desert must be awesome so we went with Churros to recollect childhood days at the pool. The churros were like a sugary, gooey, cinnamoney, beignet. If you have ever been to Cafe du monde in New Orleans, this is a less fluffy version with cinnamon and and sugar rather than powdered sugar. the presentation is excellent being served with a shot of hot chocolate and a small scoop of strawberry icecream both served in small shot glasses. Al dente is a simple but extremely warm decor restaurant. We came here on the first snowy night of winter 2012 and it was what the doctor ordered, a warm ambience, with excellent and caring service, and food that could compete with the very best.

I got 3 appetizers for my meal: The mac&cheese, butternut squash soup, and sauteed spinach with chickpeas. The soup was ABSOLUTELY FANTASTIC!!! Definitely my favorite of the three. All the appetizers come in very small servings, so I thought three would fill me up just fine. The soup filled me up completely. It was so rich, with just the right texture and taste. It makes me want to go out and buy a food processor and attempt to re-create it myself. Though I highly doubt it would be anywhere near as fantastic. I'm a girl that can eat quite a bit, and the soup alone was enough to fill me up.   The mac & cheese was rich and delicious as well. One of the best I've ever had. (I had a couple bites before bagging the rest to take home). The spinach was also very tasty, not too oily and not too salty. Just right. (Again, took only a few bites after the filling soup and took the rest home as well). My boyfriend had the Pork Chop with the portabello mushroom and fried egg. He absolutely loved it. He's always very picky with his food. He said it was the best pork he's ever had. I tried a bite as well and I agree with him. The waitstaff was very friendly and informative. When I asked him if the food would stay good enough to eat as leftovers, he gave me a few tips on ingredients to add before I heat it up to make it taste almost as good as fresh. This place is definitely a 5-star restaurant. My boyfriend and I will definitely be returning here next year, maybe even for out anniversary.

I had the mac'n cheese and the lamb, which were filling, flavor packed and delicious.   Usually, at the finer eating restaurants, I'm pleased with the food, but I could use larger portions.  Al Dente met my needs on both fronts: tasty and filling.  They're byob too, which is a nice touch...although there aren't many places nearby to pick up beverages, so make sure to take care of that task on your way to the neighborhood.",0.9865,0.854,0.146,0.0,0.6714002267573697

We had mussels with garlic bread which were a really great quantity for a starter--it was no micro-gourmet.  I had a lobster pasta dish--it was clearly homemade pasta, with truffle butter. They don't skimp on the lobster chunkers, and I even got a KING PRAWN! Bonus! My love had some kind of fish with oaxaca and adobo sauce, and he loved it.  It's really an amazing establishment.  Of course, especially in the neighborhood--other establishments in the area that have seemed promising were tasty but resulted in some unfortunate bloat-toad food poisoning.

Our waitress Amanda was amazing and provided excellent service, the food was quality and well cooked (we had the calamari app, the escolar entree and the pork entree). The problem? 1st - overpriced, the restaurant has a little ambiance and the ingredients are good but nothing deserving of the $20-$25 price tags. They need to come down slightly. 2. the use of salt. I actually like salty food but this was way too much. It was like each thing (sauce, veggies and protein) were all over salted separately and then combined. It was like drinking MSG and I had a really aching headache after 3. while the protein was very well cooked (not easy) the extras like the corn cake under the escolar and the gnocchi with the pork were way overdone and tough and again way salty. Gnocchi is supposed to be fluffy, corn cakes shouldn't required a steak knife. I like the idea of this place but I wouldn't go back until they revamped a bit and came down slightly (even $2 per entree). I added pics of the food which are deceiving. I would give 4/5 stars to Amanda but overall only 2 for the food and that's simply because the main protein was cooked properly.",0.9452,0.828,0.126,0.047,0.47073780129335696

We asked the wait staff if a dish could be altered. He had the chef at our table shortly. Chef said he could alter something, or make us a surprise. We chose the surprise. I ordered gazpacho as an appetizer. Hands down, best gazpacho I've ever had. Bursting with freshness and flavor, made from heirloom tomatoes. Fiance had the mac and cheese with truffle butter as an appetizer. It was nice, but the gazpacho stole the show. Entrees arrived. Thick cutlet of eggplant, hollowed out, filled with Mexican corn, and topped with fresh mozzarella, side of couscous, she got a potato pancake, I got a cauliflower pancake. Presentation was amazing. Eggplant was very nice, couscous was amazing. My cauliflower pancake was very good, her potato pancake with amazing, one of the best I've tasted. Restaurant was a little pricier than initially expecting. But more than worth it. It's downtown quality, at half the price.

There are a few kinks that still need to be worked out (the credit card machine wasn't working when we went, so it took awhile to pay), and while it's great that it was BYOB, the corkage fee of $5 wasn't, especially since they don't have a liquor license yet.  But those are all minor issues.  Can't wait to come back again for another date night!!!",0.9904,0.805,0.17,0.025,0.5627066115702479
2011-07-14,5.0,"What a delightful surprise and a wonderful addition to the eating establishments in the Irving Park area. My wife and I planned to eat at another restaurant Wednesday night, but it turned out they were closed and converting their menu to sushi anyway. We drove around Irving Park and spotted Al Dente, noting the ""NOW OPEN"" signs in the windows and the description of the fare as ""contemporary American."" Just what we were looking for! We parked and walked in. At first, upon entering, we worried we were underdressed, but the hostess waved off any concerns and immediately seated us.  Our waiter (I think his name was Eric) was extremely friendly and professional. It was opening night, and he offered us a complimentary glass of wine and a phenomenal chicken brioche appetizer. My wife ordered the garden salad, which was delicious, and, in her words ""refreshing."" I had the mac and cheese, prepared with truffle oil and garlic chips. Wow! It knocked my socks off clear across the room. Who'd have thought mac and cheese could be so heavenly? For the entrees we had, and shared, the chicken and pork. Delicious, and flavored unlike anything I've eaten before (I put aside the cilantro topping the pork, but that's just a personal preference; its presence didn't make the meat any less savory or delicious). The staff was fantastic. Everyone from the hostess to the waiters to the chef (who stopped by our table to ask about our meal and chat a bit about the restaurant), was helpful, making suggestions about how to best enjoy the dishes. Heed them! They know whereof they speak! We decided it's the perfect restaurant for future date nights. We're definitely coming back.",0.9973,0.767,0.218,0.015,0.5598214285714286

Chef Javier Perez has struck a wonderful balance of good food, good service and clean plating that reflects his time with Chef Michael Kornick.  The food is simple American Italian with a bit of Latin blended into the dishes. I really love the Truffle Mac & Cheese that Chef Javier has brought from his last Gig State & Lake. He has a wonderful sense of play with his food. I can only see bright things to come from this restaurant. When all the Knicks are ironed out I expect to see the caliber of food only improve and service get even better. Like all new restaurants that open they need a few more weeks to get it just right. You can see the potential of the food and the service.  Also a good point in the area with practically not a one good sit down restaurant, this is an oasis in the culinary dessert of the West side of Irving Park. If you are in the Area a want a nice quite sit down dinner Check this place out.",0.9884,0.771,0.198,0.031,0.5089142658108176
