2014-06-21,5.0,"Review is way overdue. West Town is great - it's got a nice atmosphere for date night, and yet you can still bring the in-laws in for a good meal.  Great Beer List, and the waiters are usually able to reccomend beer pairings with your meal which is nice, plus it speaks to their knowledge of the food and alcohol. I've had multiple entrees...the Fried Chicken special is wonderful, and not really large but I can usually only finish half of it, as it is so rich! I have also had their Duck, which is a Mallord Leg and it's roasted so well...the meat just melts off the bone. I've also had a few fish entrees which have been good. Overall, it's consistently good food, service and I always reccomend it to friends visiting the city.",0.9857,0.777,0.223,0.0,0.6050925925925925

It's a little pricey, but it is perfect for special events, or even just grabbing dessert and a glass or two of wine. It's usually not too hard to get in, but I'd recommend reservations if you're going on a Friday or Saturday evening, especially with more than two people. We absolutely love the Curried Butternut Squash soup, Pot Roast, Sea Scallops, Pasta (my go-to on dreary, cold Chicago nights!), and Beef - not to mention their wonderful desserts. They change some things on the menu seasonally, which keeps things interesting.  If you're in the area and looking for something special, definitely check this place out.

2013-03-08,4.0,"First time dining here last night and felt compelled to write a review. This was the best meal I've had in a long time, and I eat out at a lot of pretty nice places.  Judging from the awning on the outside, I've always passed this place by until my boyfriend told me this was one of his favorite restaurants in river west and he'd been wanting to return.  The generic outside appearance (awning) does not give you an idea of the cozy atmosphere and amazing dining experience on the inside. This food was so delicious-- so well prepared, and their take on ""comfort food"" is amazing. I felt like I was eating at the home of a friend, who happened to be a really great chef. The price tag is pretty steep, but we weren't disappointed. I had the chorizo-stuffed chicken from the weekly specials menu and it was phenomenal. Another plus for me was the huge variety. Lots of restaurants these days stick to a handful of staple menu items, so I was excited to see so much variety on the menu. The only negative for me was the ambiance. I think they'd do well to lower the lights a tad and maybe switch up the music.  The service was impeccable. I was seated by a friendly man whom I later recognized to be the part-owner of the husband and wife team and the chef herself said goodbye to us. I regretted that I did not compliment her on our way out.  We will definitely be back.",0.9812,0.77,0.178,0.052,0.5785714285714285
2013-02-12,4.0,"This place is what I consider a ""gastro/astro pub"" - gastronomically adept while astronomically priced.

2013-01-14,4.0,"This place is understated from the outside but wonderful on the inside. SERVICE: They're definitely on top of it. My fiance and I ordered a bottle of wine and we never, not even once, had to pour our own glass. Every time we got even close to the bottom, our server was there and pouring us more. It wasn't the best service we'd ever received... but it was definitely a top notch service level. FOOD: Wonderful and well prepared. You can tell that they have carefully selected dishes that will allow them to be efficient in their ""small"" kitchen. My fiance had beef tenderloin and I had pork tenderloin - both were wonderfully soft and full of flavor. The food is, for the most part, well proportioned, giving you enough for fullness but not so much that you are left with a huge amount of food on your plate. We also tried the special appetizer for the night, I believe it was a sausage ravioli, that was delicious. WINE&SPIRITS: They have a pretty extensive wine list. We went with a $44 bottle of red that had undertones of blackberry and smokiness (at least, that's what I remember). They're also pretty flexible. When my fiance asked for a couple of white russians for us to drink with our chocolate cake, they didn't hesitate, despite it not being on the menu. Even better, they sent us stiff ones. PRICES: Don't fool yourself, it's not cheap. Despite having ""Tavern"" in the name, this isn't a pub-priced joint. That said, it's up to you how you order. Our meal was around $140, but we did order a fairly expensive bottle of wine, an appetizer, and dessert.",0.997,0.742,0.237,0.022,0.5501642036124794

I ordered the house specialty pot roast - cooked perfectly but was very surprised when I took a bite and realized it was in dire need of some salt. Still, the rest of the dish was pretty solid (black vinegar sauce made the brussel sprouts melt in your mouth) and wine pairing was great. My wife loves fish and ordered the special, pan braised swordfish with Celery Root-Fennel Mash, Olives, Sundried Tomatoes and Saffron. Most of the fish was excellent, but towards the end she hit a really fishy nasty bit. We felt that something wasn't quite right with the sundried tomatoes and the rest of the dish - there was way too much and it seemed there was just one flavor too much. Wanted to be but just wasn't a fan of this one :( The atmosphere is casual/comfortable and service was top notch. The place was packed but not noisy.

Gnocchi was okay, but for $9 I've had better (especially since the portion was tiny).

2012-09-22,5.0,"The West Town Tavern, located in the near west side of Chicago, serves a very good selection of contemporary food that includes weekday specials.  Its one dining room is nicely decorated and is housed in a rehabbed late nineteen century building that is set up with booths and tables.  It has an original tin ceiling, exposed brick walls, and a very comfortable 15-seat oak bar near the entrance. All of this combines to provide a very charming and warm ambiance. On a recent weeknight my wife and I dined there.  We started with a drink at the bar.  Chris our bartender poured ample, well prepared drinks at very reasonable prices.  We then moved to a nicely located booth where we started our dinner by sharing a crab cake appetizer that was a special of the evening.  We then shared a fresh salad that was made with arugula and tomatoes topped with a green goddess dressing that was also a special.  For our entrées my wife had the sea scallops accompanied by butternut squash risotto, and I had the pot roast with mashed potatoes (that I believe is a signature dish).  For desert we had the Michigan Tart, another special, that consisted of berries and vanilla ice cream in a pastry shell that is made on the premises.  All the food was very well prepared, fresh, and delicious, and we ate everything with great pleasure.  We also had house wines by the glass that were very tasty and reasonably priced.  Our table service was professional, helpful, and well-paced.  Also, the hostess who greeted and seated us was very friendly and accommodating.       We had an outstanding dining experience at The West Town Tavern, and it is very highly recommended.",0.9966,0.765,0.231,0.004,0.6077840136054421

The fried chicken was moist and delicious and was accompanied by very flavorful sauteed kale, garlic mashed potatoes, a biscuit and mushroom gravy.  All really delicious.  We started with the goat cheese and pork belly spring rolls which were amazing.  One of the best appetizers we've had in a long time.  The caper and pepper relish that accompanied the spring rolls was a contrasting zing that really enhanced the dish.  We both agreed it's a not to be missed item.   While we've only been there once and didn't really need to look at the menu because we both wanted their Monday night fried chicken special, I did notice that there were definitely some dishes that I could see myself enjoying.  They have other nightly specials to consider as well.  The wine list is pretty big and has some affordable options.   We were too full, and felt too indulged already, to go for dessert. Maybe next time. While our server was friendly and efficient, we found our appetizer came out very quickly and our main course while we were still finishing our appetizer.  Too quickly.  We were in and out under 55 minutes and we do like to not be rushed.  So I'd say that was the only negative and next time we go, we will ask that our courses be spaced out a little better.  The ambiance is enjoyable and there were definitely locals there for early dinners with their kids.  Overall, a great place that I'll visit again and hope to not be rushed.",0.9952,0.8,0.189,0.011,0.5354464285714285

One thing that really irritates me and I find inexcusable is when the salad is brought at the same time as the appetizer. When paying $27.00 for entrees, I expect my courses to be spaced out accordingly. First of all, there's not enough room on the table for all that at once.

Now for the important part, FOOD.  Started off with two appetizers, the gnocchi and tried the grilled calamari which was a special that night, and both were extremely good (gnocchi is always just a little carb-bomb of goodness, and this was no exception).  For the main course I ordered the sea scallops which came with bacon bits mixed in (obviously gaining points for any inclusion of bacon) and asparagus which was perfectly done.  Wine list was good, nothing exorbitantly priced at all, had the Chenin Blanc which went well with everything.   I'd definitely go back to this place again!",0.9968,0.712,0.277,0.011,0.5742272347535505

We started with an inventive grilled calamari salad special - it was lovely and delicious. I was ecstatic over a pepper-crusted beef tenderloin served with truffle fries: it was rich & tender, perfectly seasoned. My companion opted for special slow-smoked spareribs served with grits; they were dry & smoky, just the way I like 'em - they will definitely be my first choice if I see them on the menu again. For dessert, bourbon pecan pie was above reproach, as was full-flavored cappuccino. As usual, we found a delightful (and affordable) wine from the wide, well-chosen list.

2012-03-21,4.0,"After hearing some good things about West Town Tavern, the food crew decided to check it out next on our eating adventure. As usual, we shared everything so we could get a good sampling of what's what on the menu.  FOOD:  Monday Special Fried Chicken - I was looking forward to the fried chicken the most, but I ended up being the most disappointed with this dish. I LOVE good fried chicken, especially when its juicy, cooked just right, with a flavorful and crispy skin/crust. This really didn't deliver on any of those fronts. The white meat was dry, and the batter really didn't have much going for it. The mashed potatoes were good but standard fare; the biscuit was a bit dry, and there wasn't enough gravy. Maybe we got a bad batch this time around? I'll have to check it out again the next time I'm here... Pan-seared Diver Sea Scallops with mushroom-leek risotto -  Perfectly cooked scallops and risotto. The risotto had a lot of flavor and was my favorite side of the night. Not much else to say, great dish. Zinfandel-Braised Short Rib ""Pot Roast"" - Great short rib! Melt-in-your-mouth tender, and the brussel sprouts weren't half bad either. Mashed taters were more of the same ol' same ol'. Potato-crusted Tilapia - another perfectly cooked protein. The potato crusting was light but let its presence be known. The tilapia was moist and the rice pilaf was flavorful, just not as flavorful as the risotto. Bourbon Pecan Pie with caramel sauce and thick cream - pretty good pecan pie. Chef's Whim Ice Cream Sandwich with fudge brownie and berry ice cream - my favorite dessert! The brownie wasn't super soft, but that's probably on purpose to be more ice cream sandwichy. Delicious ice cream too as it was thick and creamy and the berries really went well with the brownie. I couldn't stop eating it even though I was pretty full. Gala Apple Turnover with caramel ice cream - really good ice cream on this one as well. The filling wasn't really too flavorful, and the pastry was too thin, flimsy, and lacked flavor. If the filling was a bit more robust, it would have worked well with the pastry. SERVICE: Service was quick, water was always filled, and refills were made frequently. We were the only table there (it was late on a Monday), but service was still great. OVERALL: I have to say that I enjoyed West Town Tavern and appreciated that most dishes were cooked well, but nothing really blew me away. I think it's solid food that's better than your typical restaurant at fairly reasonable prices. It definitely fits my definition of what contemporary comfort food is, and good eats that should prove to be a reliable choice.",0.9988,0.738,0.229,0.033,0.5268983268983272

2011-12-20,3.0,"The menu of West Town Tavern reads American comfort food. Michelin endorsed it with a Bib Gourmand status. This could be good. Few people in this town are doing comfort food at a high level.   The meal started with a strong bread service. The white bread, which was Americanized baguette, was adequate. The real star was the wheat bread. It had the perfect crust and the most inviting aroma from the multi-grain. That, paired with a wonderfully whipped butter accented with citrus zest and mustard seeds, was pure joy.  I had the mushroom chowder for appetizer. It was a good chowder that perhaps could be thickened a bit more. The blue cheese, which I suppose was meant to brighten up the chowder, was distracting and unnecessary. For the main dish, I had pot roast. I was kind of hoping that it would come out in a small cast iron pot, with chunks of potato and pristine baby carrots.  Instead, it came out on a plate with caramelized Brussels sprout and garlic mashed potato.  The pot roast itself was braised to perfection. It was incredibly tender. Obviously much TLC was put into this meat. It brought me back to the American childhood I never actually had.  The Brussels sprout, while good, was an odd pairing. And the garlic mash was way too garlicky to be pleasant. I also found a small piece of bone (from chicken?) in the mash.  Didn't know what to make of that.   For dessert, I had the pecan pie. Pecan pie can be way too sweet sometimes, but WTT's pecan pie was flavored just right.  The dollop of Bourbon whipped cream was subtle and paired well with the pie.  The pie itself, though, was just okay.  The pie crust was not tender / flaky enough, and the pecans completely lost their crunch. If you got through the tough crust, you won't need to bring teeth to this dessert...   I got the recommended 2009 Villa San-Juliette Petite Sirah that was supposed to go with the pot roast.  It was extremely fruity with a intensely fragrant, potpourri-like nose.  It was a bit too sweet (lacked the acid to stand up to the pot roast), but it had a smooth and silky finish, and the sweetness did go with the raisin and the overly sweet vinegar sauce in my entree.   Decor was warm and cozy, with exposed brick and duct.  Service was adequate and wicked fast (perhaps a bit too fast). Don't get me wrong, I don't like to wait too long for my food, but this place put Chinese take-out to shame. Moreover, with such a rustic menu, I was expecting an effusive old lady with a southern accent as my waitress.  Instead, I got a young hipster who was too cool and miserly with smile.   In the end, WTT offered competent home-cooking, but not a complete comfort food dining experience.  While there were flashes of genius (such as the bread service and the meat in the pot roast), many aspects of the meal were merely ordinary if not sub-par. If you are serving comfort food at a high price, you better make sure everything's spot on - execution, presentation, service, the whole nine yard. Well, WTT's food wasn't quite there.  It was not American comfort food at its best. That, combined with the aloof service, made me feel that the overall experience was, ultimately, that of disconnection and dissatisfaction.",0.9955,0.799,0.154,0.046,0.4906464228203357

My wife and I had been going to West Town Tavern for years, like 5 or 6 years.  We were regulars...they know us by name, heck...by voice when we call to make reservations.  To make a long story short, the Host and part-owner of the restaurant was incredibly arrogant, rude, condescending and disrespectful to us last time we made a visit.  We walked in no more than 8 minutes late 7:08pm for a 7pm reservation.  Please keep in mind, it was raining that night. We went to celebrate the life and death of my wife's mother, it was the 2 year anniversary of her passing and we asked for our special table.  The very table we celebrated our engagement, etc. Again, we walked in about 8 minutes late and the owner said, ""well, too bad because I called you and nobody picked up...so I gave your table away, feel free to sit at the bar."" We decided to leave, I went up to the owner and told him how special this restaurant was to us, and he shook his head and basically said...I don't care, you were late.   What a shame.  This guy is the epitome of what's wrong with small business owners, with enormous egos. I hope this resonates with someone, and prevents a very disappointing experience in the future.

I lived in the city for several years and I felt like I was downtown, they played good music in the background like some of the big bars in the city.  Great spot for watching sports, a lot of TV's around.  Aside from the bad hostess and the bartender, I liked it and we'll definitely be back.  I'll just remember to ask for menus before we seat ourselves and not order a cocktail and just straight up beer.  There is also an outdoor and patio and bar which is hard to find in the burbs.",0.9772,0.775,0.172,0.053,0.4814327485380117

There is no contest when it comes to the quality and taste of their entrees...they are awesome. The ambiance is wonderful and the service is impeccable. They also don't give you gigantic portion sizes which I like. Why not five stars then? When you order a glass of wine (and it is at least $9 for a glass at West Town Tavern) the portion is small.  I know over serving can also be a bad thing, but when I'm paying that much for a glass of wine I want a full pour. The thing is they have the restaurant logo on the wine glass and only fill to the top of the logo. I would guesstimate they are serving around 5.5 oz of wine - max - in each glass.  For the price I pay I want some more please. Maybe I am a lush, maybe I'm not, but I have noticed this every time I have gone there. This will not deter me away from going back but I won't be ordering wine any more...not worth it.  When I'm spending that much on food and appetizers I will save the extra $ for a fabulous dessert.

Myself and the boss decided to try West Town Tavern after hearing it was awarded a Bib Gourmand. I had never heard of this place before and it was a nice surprise to find such a nice restaurant only a few miles away from my apartment. We started with the Gnocchi and the Squash soup and my gnocchi was very good. It is a heavy dish but had great flavour. I'm not a big fan of squash soup but the mrs ordered it and when I tasted it I did think it was good. I ordered the pot roast from my entree and the mrs ordered the sea scallops. The pot roast was a good dish again but no where near the level of Dale Levitskis Pot Roast at Sprout and the mrs didn't finish her sea scallops but that was due to the size of the dish. The scallops were seared perfectly and were tasty.  The quality of food that is put out is very good considering how small the kitchen is and how reasonable the prices are. Both owners of West Town Tavern were there working which I always think is a sign of a good place and ensuring they keep the standards were they want them.

Their menu is incredible.  I had the Duck Confit and the Duck was cooked very well and I liked that they gave me a leg instead of a breast because everywhere else you go they give you the breast.  I think leg meat has better texture so that made me happy.  But the garlic greens and parsnip potato cake blew my mind away.  The greens were mostly spinach and anyone who knows anything about spinach knows that it absorbs flavors very well... almost too well becasue it's easy to over season it.  This spinach was perfectly seasoned with whole garlic cloves and salt.  My friend had the rainbow trout and it was good too, but I only had one bite so I can't say much more.  Next time I go back I will have to try the Butternut Squash Soup with Carmel Corn (what a creative combination, right?).   In looking at their menu again I literally want to go back and try one of everything.  I think my next visit back will be on a monday night becasue I hear their fried chicken is the best in Chicago but it's a Monday night special.  Also, it was a bit crazy on Tuesday night when we went.  The place was packed and there was much confusion upon arrival.  I have a feeling there are a lot of people that come back to West Town Tavern regularly and the hostess seemed to know peoples faces as repeat customers but seemed confused on exactly what to do with that information.  She ended up being really nice.... after she was done being flustered.  Our actual waitress was also very nice and did a very good job memorizing the specials.    One more tip for those of you who can't drink wine without falling asleep (like me).  They have cider and it's good.  I would normally get a Matilda or Guinness, but I really couldn't imagine a beer going better with what I ate then the cider did.",0.9915,0.831,0.142,0.027,0.4976681651681652

The chicken and linguine were saturated with oil...so much so that my daughter commented that I should send it back.   She ordered the turkey leg and the accompanying veggies were also wearing a heavy coating of oil.    I understand the concept of comfort food, but nothing that oily seemed comfortable to us.   The waiter was pretty much absent except to ask if we wanted dessert and to bring us the bill.    We did order dessert and enjoyed the chocolate cake and apple turnover, which were both good.   So dessert was a ""plus"" even though the food bombed.

My friend took me here because it just so happens to be his favorite restaurant in Chicago (I'd say that's a pretty big deal considering the selection in Chicago).

Luckily, we managed to snag the two end of the bar seats which gave us plenty of room. We ordered wine, had some bread, and when our meal arrived I dove right in.

Every time I order steak I am a bit underwhelmed when they set my plate down in front of me, I always think, wow, that's a small amount of meat. But in this case, it definitely wasn't; it was perfect. I received two appropriately sized steaks accompanied by a very very tasty square of cheddar-garlic scalloped potatoes. The Zinfandel reduction was a spectacular addition, oh I almost forgot, and there were a few brussel sprouts on my plate as well, but I ignored them throughout my entire meal, they weren't important enough for me to pay attention to them.

The hostess was welcoming and friendly and showed us to our seat.   The inside is nice and cozy.  The atmosphere is versatile enough to meet up with friends or to use as a romantic date. Our waiter greeted us and began telling us the nightly specials.  He was friendly but seemed a bit stiff and uncomfortable.  He brought bread and water to our table and ask us if we wanted something from the bar.  As we reviewed the menu, the chef came to our table to greet us, which was very nice. The waiter returned to the table to take our orders.  I ordered one of the specials for the night which was white fish with creamy corn along with the recommended wine.  My friend order the crab cakes and a mixed drink. My dinner was excellent.  The fish was light and flavorful and sat on a small hill of creamy corn which complimented the fish nicely.  The white wine was smooth and light and perfect for the meal.  My friend enjoyed the crab cakes and mixed drink as well.  At the end of our meal we were offered a dessert menu.  Although tempting, I was full an opted to have  just coffee. As we sipped our coffee, the chef came to our table again and ask us how was our meal.  She knew exactly what we ordered and asked us about our individual meals.   Once we finished our coffee the waiter brought our check, we paid the bill and off we went.

2010-07-28,4.0,"I was jonesin' for my weekly fried chicken fix and suggested this place to Keri H when we discussed where to go for dinner. She's had this place bookmarked for awhile, and me, well, it had a fried chicken special on Mondays. That's all I needed to know. We got there and were able to score a table outside on one of those rare perfect weather evenings. Our server was cute and very sweet. I saw tons of plates of fried chicken go by being served to other tables so I already had a good feeling about this place. Keri was vacillating between the tilapia and pork entrees and looked to our server for suggestions. She recommended the pork tenderloin and I of course, ordered the fried chicken with no hesitation. To that we also decided to split an order of gnocchi to start. The gnocchi was good, but it was a little gummy and I prefer a straight-up pesto sauce to a pesto cream sauce. It wasn't bad, but I don't think either of us would order it again. My fried chicken was three big pieces and served with garlic mashed potatoes, sauteed swiss chard, a buttermilk biscuit, and some mushroom gravy. The chicken was most excellent, as were the sides. I pushed the gravy to the side as I didn't think it needed it and I didn't want anything adulterating the chicken in its natural state. It was so flavorful and crispy, and good friend that I am, I gave Keri a taste. She liked it a lot and I could tell she had food envy. Can't blame her. I was excited for her dish; I especially wanted to try the cheddar spoonbread. The pork was good, but it was a little dry, as pork sometimes has a tendency to be. The spoonbread was good, but nothing on her plate could hold a candle to my fried chicken. This special is priced at $16.95, which is what I paid for chicken at Kroll's last week. There's no contest that I got my money's worth at WTT. It actually made me feel slightly raped by Kroll's. We both enjoyed WTT, I, a little more, but that's only because she didn't get the fried chicken. I'm sure I can convince her to come back so she knows what she's been missing. West Town Tavern serves delicious comfort food done in a contemporary style with reasonable prices and great service. Their wine list is also first-rate. Unfortunately we didn't get wine because we were still feeling the effects from the previous evening's festivities.  I highly recommend. At the very least, if you're a fried chicken connoisseur like I am, you won't be disappointed. Side note: as I was parking, I couldn't help but wonder if West Town Tavern used to be a restaurant I used to frequent back in the day called ""Jim and Johnny's"".

The second time the service was OK I guess, but not exactly what I would call great.  I thought the hostess was a bit abrasive but I don't know if she was that same idiot that mislead us over the phone the first time.   The specials are reasonably priced, but most entrees are in the high $20s.  Did I try this pot roast?  No, maybe its great...but I'd still bet that there are plenty of better places out there for the $$$.",0.947,0.801,0.127,0.072,0.4909098639455783

Everyone had great things to say about their dinners and I am craving the trout at this moment. For dessert the table had 2 orders of the banana creme brulee, which was delicious, but just a tad too sweet. The bill was more reasonable than expected and the service was shining.

It seemed to have been made up hours before and left to sit in the cooler. For the entrees, I chose a ""special"" lobster mac'n'cheese which the server described as small but rich.  It was, instead, thin and  very watery, not at all creamy, as if the frozen lobster meat, (from the claw, not the body, and quite dry), had not  been properly drained.  Whatever cheese  may have been in it was completely diluted; it was devoid of flavor altogether.  My husband ordered the much touted diver scallops with the risotto.  The risotto was superb, but the scallops smelled so fishy and tasted so off that he had to send them back; and we rarely send anything back!  They replaced it with a new dish of  undercooked  risotto minus the scallops; and, to their credit,  removed the dish from our bill.

Then the entrees arrived !  My husband ordered the Owensboro, Ky BBQ Lamb.  This is not your typical BBQ. Instead of being smothered in sauce, it is smokey and tender and piled atop a wonderful corn cake.  The meat is juicy and tender, the sauce subtle, not sweet or sticky. I ordered the Pot Roast.  They are very proud to tell you that that  this is the signature dish, and with good reason, it is absolutely delicious!  The meat is so  tender it falls apart in your mouth.   The wine reduction perfect.  There are raisins in the reduction which add a slight sweetness, but do not overwhelm the sauce. They serve it with creamy  mashed  potatoes and the most delicious roasted brussel sprouts I have ever had.   *If this was the only  entree on the menu, they would still do a great business!!!!  We ended our meal with the Banana Cream pie and the Bourbon Pecan pie.  Both were wonderful, but the banana pie is a real stand out.  The fruit is caramelized and the pie is topped with salted peanuts.  These two things give the creamy pie a wonderful crunchy dimension that really makes it different from your standard cream pie.

Susan Goss is one of the most studied American Chefs out there,  her style is American Contemporary.  Her menus have American classics like Pot Roast,  Fried Chicken and  Cobblers.  The experience at West Town is the experience you should get at all American styled restaurants but,  rarely do.  There are no giant posters,  no big flags,  nothing shouting America is the greatest!  The Tavern,  is streamlined and elegant,  some wood,  exposed brick and an open kitchen,  nothing to distract you from the task at hand,  eating.

I had the Berkshire pork loin and maple glazed pears,  I also tasted the Trout which was fantastic.   The wine list is fairly priced,  with great choices,  by the glass or by the bottle.  Service is excellent,  we have had the same server on 4 occasions,  I find this rare in this day.

We finally got seated, and we shared the flat bread, and even though it might come out of the kitchen looking like frozen pizza out of the oven, it was so flavorful - I mean all that truffle and that taste of garlic!  The mussels were so good, too - we sopped up all of that sauce and asked for more bread to get every drop. We then shared, the scallops and the pot roast.  I have to say, this is where it started to get a little average for me... the scallops were well prepared, and not over-cooked, which is fabulous, but as much as I love scallops in general, there was nothing all that special about these; and the pot roast, true to all the yelp reviews before me, does flake off and does not need a knife to eat.  However, I found it a little flat in flavor - sorry! - and anything cooked until it flakes off, I think you have opportunity to take on any flavor you cook it in and I just felt let down.  Maybe it was all the hype or it could have been a down night - I don't know.  I am so willing to give it another go with a bigger group and more of the goodness on the menu.  Hopefully sometime soon.",0.9926,0.812,0.151,0.037,0.5607730746619636

The calamari seemed lighter than most and came atop some mixed greens. It also wasn't overwhelming in size, which was nice since we had another app. The potato chips were homemade with various herbs and they were quite delicious!  For my entree, I had the Diver Sea Scallops, which were cooked perfectly. They came over a mushroom risotto, which was also yummy but at first seemed a bit salty and lemony. After multiple bites, though, it was fine. I really enjoyed my meal and would recommend it to others. I did also try a couple slices of the pork. It was good but nothing that stood out.

2009-02-18,3.0,"I was in Chi-Town for business last week just before V-Day.  My business associate decided to take me to this place that he said was the SECOND-highest restaurant by locals.  A tad unfair to the restaurant, perhaps, since my expectations were half way up the Sear's Tower before we arrived.   The entrance was kind of non-descript; despite some glowing praise in here, I'd say the innards weren't what you might call the epitome of deor.  Our table was small, and claustrophobia set in soon with talking hordes on  3 sides of our table: the noise level approached Pumpkins-level at times.  I didn't have to remind myself that this is a ""tavern"" after all - many aspects of it live up to that label rather than a traditional dining room.   I'd say off the bat that the wine by the glass is on the cheating side of town.  We each had 2 glasses, and while I have no measuring beaker handy, I'd estimate 4.5 oz. max.  I am certain we would have been better off with a bottle, both quantity- and price-wise.  We each had a meritage-style blend and speaking for myself I could have easily have compromised.   The wild mushroom chowder was very (too?) creamy and elegant, but it lacked any complexity, thus coming short of making me jump up to shout ""Hallelujah""!   My host liked the pot roast that he had.  I ordered the smoked lamb shoulder as my main dish.  It tasted good, and would have bordered on delicious, but for that rude, rude intrusion/infusion of NaCl.  M-A-N, was it SALTY!!!!   I have no idea what a ""traditional black sauce"" is (I looked up Larousse under sauce noir when I got home, but came up dry), but whatever it was, there must have 4 oz. of pure sodium in it.  My other small complaint is that a cold ""slaw"" type of mixture, and it was COLD - certainly would have been better served in a side-dish.   No dessert for me - just a double expresso.  I'm giving it a 3, but it could be 3.5 stars.  I'll probably go back if I get the chance, although I'm now curious about Green Zebra.",0.9218,0.839,0.096,0.064,0.5581402831402832

I had picked up my dining companion that night, (the lovely and talented Paige W), and we headed out to grab a quick dinner before I hopped off to another party and she to her concert. I had heard so many good things about this place and was truly looking forward to coming here.  Raves about the food and the interesting menu walking in I was thrown off. Perhaps it was the tavern part, I kept thinking it was a bar with really good food. its not. Its warm and it glows, shimmers and shines. sort of a romanticized dining room. The sparkle of the silverware, the images of diners in the mirror, kinda of transports you to some where else. Thankfully it was some where warm and had food. Like Amanda H has stated, get a reservation. We came in shortly after the ""Check Please"" production was on raving about the place. Their dining area was taken with reservations. Sad. The kind gentleman at the door did offer us a seat at the bar, which we accepted. Not so sad.  He quickly got us glasses of water and menus as the bartender/server was running her keister off filling drink orders. Looking at the menu on line, I had some idea of what I wanted. I looked at the wine list, one glass was in order for the night, a nice and warm tempranillo, Paige got some red that our bartender recommended, which she thought was great. I commented to Paige about splitting an appetizer, but we settled on each getting a bowl of soup. With the potato and apple soup slapping me in the face, begging to be ordered, how could I say no? I went with that and the scallops whilest Paige went with the pork. While we chatted, collected our thoughts and adventures of the months past we munched on some lovely warm bread and seasoned butter.  When our soups arrived I looked at it for a moment. It looked lovely, it smelled lovely and guess what? It tasted fantastic. Made to perfect consistency, not too thick, not too thin, seasoned well and finished off with a slight sweetness of apples. I will say the blue cheese croutons were pretty amazing on their own, but blended the earthiness of the potato and balanced the apple well. I think I could have covered my entire bowl with them. Then came our dinner, my scallops with a mushroom and leek risotto was rich and buttery, flavorful with the scallops seared just right. Paige's pork had a great smokiness which blended well with her squash, swiss chard and bacon medley accompaniment. We both did well finishing off our plates but sadly due to time constraints, our dinner had to be cut short and dessert wasn't had to complete the night.  Our server was working it well that night, obviously busy but when she stopped in front of us, she was certainly interested in making sure we had everything we needed and were taken care of, then she rushed off doing the same to her full bar of patrons.

My second trip was on a Monday and we went for the Fried Chicken.  Ok, now I love me some fried chicken (fried anything to be honest).  I thought the chicken was good, juicy and fried perfectly.  However, if you are expecting a little spice...you are not gonna get it.  Besides salt and pepper (and light on the salt), that was it.  I can't gripe about it because I like my food spicy and just because this wasn't doesn't make it bad...just don't go expecting it to be spicy or seasoned beyond a dash of salt and pepper. To say I was disappointed, well a little, but this place is great.  I can't give it less than 5 stars.  My garlic mashed potatoes were delicious as were my biscuit and other plated item (I think kale). Please save room for dessert.  We got the apple tart and the lemon chess pie.  Wow, were they delicious. I love this place.  Too bad it's not in my hood....sigh.",0.9936,0.756,0.219,0.026,0.634431216931217

The entree-- everything was extremely tempting. Know that regardless of the entree you choose, it will be wonderful. I had the pork tenderloin with august squash. My friends ate the trout, tilapia, beef tenderloin, and skate fish special. The menu pairs a wine with each entree for the novice (me). Dessert was banana creme pie with white chocolate shavings (ugh, I DIE!!) and the Michigan apple berry crumble with praline ice cream. Great overall dining experience and will definitely return.

The ambiance is great, i always forget there is a little bar area in the front, might be nice to pop in and have dinner there one night.  Walked here for dinner from our house, seated right away (had reservations). The bottle of wine we had for about $30 dollars was by far one of the best tasting bottles I have had in this price range, and like always forgot to write it down. We started with the cheese plate, then I ordered the spinach salad and the chicken. My fiance had the beef in zinfendel sauce. Wow, his sauce, I could have eaten alone it was so so tasty.

2008-12-30,5.0,"When you think of excellent, eclectic Chicago dining, think of West Town Tavern.  There is nothing more pleasurable than discovering a great little Chicago restaurant in an un-Trixie neighborhood and having a fantastic dinner with near-perfect service.  My pals Sal and Sara recommended this place, and my fiance and I loved it.  The owners are hands-on and exceptionally friendly.  They remember faces and names.  They seem very down-to-earth and very committed to ensuring their diners have a top-notch time.  I made a boo-boo in that I did not recognize one of the owners who got my coat for me, and I tipped her.  AGH.  Totally, socially-inept me.  She was still gracious in accepting it, even though I am a complete moron. The decor is lovely and inviting.  It is not a huge space, but the ambiance is comfortable, cozy, and elegantly homey.  It is not a fussy-dress-up place, but you would feel disrespectful if you showed up in cut-offs and a tank top (okay, not in this weather).  Margie O hit it on the nose that it feels like ""cozying up on the couch with my boy and my dogs in front of a blazing fire.""  West Town Tavern is great for a date place, family gathering, friends' birthday party, etc.  The bar is right up front, and the bartenders are friendly and helpful.  Parking on the street is a piece of cake, even on a Friday night!   We had drinks at the bar (the bartender doesn't skimp on the spirits!) and then we sat down for an amazing meal.  We started with antipasto, gnocchi, and potato chips.  Don't laugh - the potato chips are gourmet and the chef (one of the owners, I believe) puts an amazing coating of balsamic syrup, truffle oil, rosemary on it.  It is so good.  Thinking about it now has me salivating like a dog.  They are not ordinary potato chips.  The appetizers were outstanding. On to the entrees - I had the beef tenderloin (rrowrrrrr!), my fiance ate the tilapia, and I can't remember what my pals ate.  We ate every single bite.  It was that good.  The sauces are so, so, so good and the meat was cooked so tender and perfectly.   For dessert, ice cream and brownies -- yummy, yummy, yummy.  The food is so freaking good.   If this place hasn't been reviewed on ""Check, Please"" yet, somebody should.  West Town Tavern is divine and a perfect reminder of why Chicago is one of the best cities for dining.",0.9991,0.696,0.273,0.031,0.6530780780780784
2008-12-19,5.0,"West Town Tavern is the restaurant equivalent of cozying up on the couch with my boy and my dogs in front of a blazing fire. Both put me in a blissful state of reverie.  I've always been greeted warmly here, even when I've been turned away due to the full capacity (hint: make a reservations because it's a popular place!). The servers are usually friendly and helpful with recommendations, even when I've been part of a large group here.  The food is fantastic. I've not had a bad meal, or even just a fair meal; everything has been superb. I've tried the tilapia, filet mignon, risotto, pasta, scallops - all delicious. I've also enjoyed the burger special on Tuesdays (I think). I haven't ventured much into appetizers or desserts because the entree portions are so generous and I like to save room to enjoy them. Every glass and bottle of wine I've had (and I've had many) has been very tasty as well.  The dining room is warm and cozy, with exposed brick walls, large windows (fogged up during the winter) looking out onto Chicago Avenue, and a beautiful bar located by the entry. The crowd is usually a mix of couples and groups, and lots of lively conversation can be heard, but not at a disturbing level. It's one of those places that you walk by in the frigid weather, envying the diners inside enjoying a glass of wine and a meal in a warm, inviting restaurant.  The bathrooms are located around a corner from the dining room and are clean, large and attractively decorated. No complaints here.  This is a great neighborhood restaurant for upscale comfort food in an unpretentious setting. Take you boy/girl, your girlfriends, your family, whoever you can round up and enjoy a fabulous meal here.  But you should probably make a reservation first, because you'll have a hard time finding a comparable restaurant when you're turned away at the door.  You'll look pretty pathetic with your nose pressed to the fogged-up window, making puppy-dog eyes at the hostess in the hopes that she'll take pity on you and find you a table so you can be one of those enviable diners.",0.9958,0.736,0.214,0.051,0.6403540903540903

The bartender was a ok at first, she got us our drinks quickly and kind of explained the menu. The other 2 friends arrived and we oredered apps and entrees. The food was pretty good, but as the night progressed she got ruder and more standofish.  We finished with 3 desserts which were again pretty good. Overall I liked the food a lot. My pork was  not pipping hot when it came out so I was a little sad, but everyone really liked what they ordered. Our check came and it was $161. My friends and myself are ALL in the ""industry"". Meaning we all work for tips. But the service ended up being so awful that we couldn't bear to give more than 10% tip. Not sure if she was having a really bad night or what but she made the experience miserable. We ended up giving her a $18 tip. It is not my style to tip that amount on a meal that price, but we could not overlook the rude vibe she was displaying. After she ran our cards she proceeded to lay the bill out in front of us and ask if ""this is how much we were meaning to tip?"" None of us knew what to do. It was so beyond rude that we were speachless. And she kept asking over and over if that was the correct amount we meant to tip.......So my friend ended up saying ""yes, because you were rude"". She proceeded to become hot with rage and YELLED at us, she said we were ""little punks"" and that ""she should have carded us when we came in"". We are all in our LATE 20's early 30's!!!!!!

2008-09-04,4.0,"West Town Tavern has a slightly misleading name. There is nothing tavern-like about it.  The space itself is beautiful. They respected the architecture and character of the building they chose and complimented it with their decor beautifully. The warm hardwood floors complimented their unadorned black tables very well and I loved the bar area near the front of the restaurant.  Our meal was artfully presented and innovative. They seem to take classic comfort style dishes and put their own twist on them. I had the post roast and my companion had the pork tenderloin. Both were quite good, but not exceptional. The pork tenderloin came with a cheddar mac and cheese that I thought had almost no flavor. The pork itself was tender and well prepared -- not the dried out hunk of meat you usually get in a restaurant when you order pork. The pot roast was definitely the better of the two. It was a surprisingly sweet piece of roasted beef that melted in your mouth. It was perfectly complimented by the garlic mashed potatoes and zucchini and squash sides. The zucchini was particularly well prepared -- still had a bit of crunch but very flavorful and fresh tasting! I do have to mention the fresh, hot bread they provide at the beginning of the meal with an herbed lemon butter - TO DIE FOR! Seriously, worth the cost of the meal alone. I loved it. This is a great restaurant to come on a date or with an older dining companion, because you can hear each talk and you get excellent attentive service.

Taking into account that point of view about the service and the food, 4 stars. The decor and ambiance is great, however. 5 stars there. I don't think you could really get much more warm and inviting. The highlight is a giant mirror that almost invites you to walk right through it, like Alice into Wonderland. Also, if you sit along the wall, there is a nice wide window ledge where you can put the wine list if the table gets too cluttered, an ergonomic consideration lacking in many restaurants. You could probably put your purse up there, too, if you don't like setting it on the floor. So the food...good but sometimes a little salty. The lemon butter they serve with the bread was salty. So were the scallops, but I think that is normal. The risotto with the scallops was divine, but then again, I don't eat this stuff often. Oh, the flatbread is really great.

The pesto tasted like the one I make at home, but was so much better because I didn't have to make it myself! Perfectly delicious, tender, with just enough sauce. It was probably the best gnocchi I have ever had. YUM! Being the I wasn't very hungry and I knew I wanted to try their dessert, I skipped the entree. Again I asked the server to choose and I got the Banana Cream Pie. This was unlike any BCP I have ever had before. In fact they should give it a fancier name like ""Glazed Banana Creme Tart"".

I'm a big fan of mussles and at other places I'm disappointed if there are some closed ones in the bowl- you know that some of the batch wasn't any good and they serve it to you anyway!  NOT this place. they were all fresh and plump and we used up all of our bread to soak up the chili pepper broth which is part of the fun of ordering mussles!

We wished there was a little more of the trout- it's a pretty light dinner.  There was a ton of lamb shank- I couldn't finish it and gave it to my husband. The potato crisp that the lamb shank comes on was a little salty. I didn't mind but if you need to steer clear of salt, you might want to try another dish. We saw the table next to us oohing and ahhing over a soft-shell crab special which looked great. Next time we're here we might try that one. The only real reason I'm giving 4 starts instead of 5 is that the cocktails were a little on the pricey side.  However, if you want a sure thing in the city- a  wonderful, casual but classy dining experience come here.",0.997,0.737,0.236,0.027,0.5607369614512471

The appetizer mussels are just average.  These mussels are smaller than most I've had...so small that I couldn't really taste the mussels.  And they came out cold.  The mussels came in a puddle of kaffir lime coconut broth which was decent.   I also had the wild boar chops with sausages.  The concept was too interesting to pass up.  Anytime ostrich/boar/venison is on the menu, I'm all over it.   The boar was chewy and overdone, drenched in an oversalted sauce.  The waiter told me that this was ""very popular"", but couldn't figure out why.  The sausage was more successful than the boar chop.  It had a nice texture and served as an interesting accompaniment to the boar chop.  As I was on my 3rd or 4th disappointing bite into the chop, I saw plate and plates of Hamburgers flash by--their Tuesday night special.  I would come back on a Tuesday night just for the burgers because they looked so good.   The one mindlessly good dish is the potato chips.  Think Kettle Chips drizzled with a sweet balsamic reduction, rosemary, and truffle oil (aka ""ketchup for the bourgeoisie"").   The atmosphere is great.  A ""jewel"" in the middle of a transitioning neighborhood.  The brick walls, dramatic curtains took you back to ""old Chicago"".  Lots of character--exactly what this neighborhood needs.   West Town Tavern is a great neighborhood restaurant.  I didn't find the food unique or executed well enough to be a ""special occasion"" restaurant  but not bad.  Agree with D'Elited's review:  The wine list needs some work.",0.9949,0.803,0.176,0.021,0.5460644257703082

2008-04-09,4.0,"We ate at West Town Tavern tonight based on some friends' recommendations - and I have to say, if this is the type direction they point us in, I will listen to them more often. The friends I met for dinner had looked into West Town Tavern on Metromix, so they were a little shocked at the entree prices - Metromix says $9-15, but everything was pretty solidly in the $20 range.  Still, the entrees looked good, so we decided what the hell. Good choice.  My friends had the specials - one was a creole shrimp and tilapia (I think - sorry, I don't do seafood) which he said was excellent, and my other friend had the wild boar chop and sausage.  Now, full disclosure - while I love beef, and I like chicken, meat in general pretty much freaks me out.  I'm not what I would call a 'meat adventurer.'   Still, boar is close to pork, and I can eat pork so I decided to give it a try.  For real, I would order this dish.  The meat was phenomenal, and the sausage was extremely flavorful - it had a strong fennel flavor, and wasn't over-garlicked like many sausages can be.  It also came with sweet potato hash browns, which were great.  The only downside is that it's a special, so who knows if/when it'll be on the menu again. I actually opted for the beef tenderloin off the regular menu - two medallions with a cheddar-garlic scalloped potato, and the meat had a zinfandel reduction on it.  Thoroughly enjoyable - I had to fight off the others' forks, as they kept stabbing at my potatoes. We were headed to a play after dinner, which is unfortunate only because I saw several desserts that looked very tasty and I wish I could have sampled them.  It was also a nice, laid back atmosphere, and I would have liked to just hang out and talk and drink more wine.  There's always next time, though, right?",0.9967,0.722,0.219,0.059,0.5848099816849819

After pinning and pawing, I remembered this gem and booked a rezy. Needless to say, it was a two and a half hour dinner, lots of drinks, delicious food, great times and I really couldn't have been happier.

I don't see this as a flaw for West Town Tavern so much as the bartender. We sat at the bar on a busy friday- we didn't reserve a table and would have had to wait until 10 for one. The bartender was busy, but still pretty quick. There was just a little too much attitude about her- bf is a bartender and she was arguing about drink recipes with him. Oh well.

I had a friend in from out of town and a bunch of us met here for dinner on Thursday.  I have driven by this place so many times and have not even noticed it...a quaint little corner.   The decor is very warm and rustic looking.  Definitely an upscale tavern. Wood bar and soft earthy colors.  The waitstaff is very friendly.  We were glad we made a reservation because they were very busy. With 8 of us eating, we had most of the menu represented on the table.  We ordered the special appetizer (some twist on grits with delicious shrimps) , the mussels (definitely tasty), and the potato chips (ABSOLUTELY wonderful).  My friend Theda's mother was there and she prides herself on being an expert on chips and she could not stop raving about them. I had the scallops that were perfectly cooked and served atop a bed of mushroom risotto.  There was nothing left on my plate; I enjoyed every last bite. Other people at the table ordered steak, pork chop, duck, chicken, there was someone who had soup...everyone was very satisfied with their dish.  All of the dishes were well-balanced with veggies and a rice, risotto, or a potato.  The steak came with delicious looking scalloped potatoes...if it wasn't on Theda's dad's plate I might have been inclined to reach across the table and dig my fork in for a bite! I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu.  Everything looks and tastes as though it is the signature dish of the menu.

The food!  I would come here for the pub chips alone!  The intoxicating scent of truffle oil wafts over you as this big bowl of chips is set down on your table.  They are just SO delicious.  I really want to try another appetizer here, but I can't NOT have these chips!  I like a place with a small menu, because that hopefully means that everything is done well.  On my first visit, my date ordered the lamb, and WOW was it ever good!  And I don't even LIKE lamb!  The meat was so incredibly tender, it was like eating a lamb-flavored cloud.  I loved the BBQ sauce and the corn cake as well.  This dish definitely falls into the ""phenomenal"" category. Ordering meat seems to be a good bet here, as the beef tenderloin was also quite heavenly, in a rich reduction with some scalloped potatoes that almost steal the spotlight away from the beef!  Yum!   I've also had some seafood.  The shrimp risotto special was incredibly tasty.  The shrimp were plump and perfectly cooked, and the risotto was the perfect texture--not too soupy, nor too pasty.  Cheesy with a nice lemony zip.   People don't seem to like the desserts here, but I found the devil's food cake with mint chocolate chip ice cream to be pretty darn tasty. OK, now for a tiny complaint, and my only reason for not giving this amazing place 5 stars.  The first time I went, I ordered the burger, and was extremely excited about it, after reading what Nate S., Sara S., and smeeiff m. had to say about it.  But I just wasn't impressed, sorry you guys!  However, I have had the Kobe beef burger at Sweets & Savories, which remains in my heart as The Best Burger EVER.  Don't get me wrong, this burger was fine.  I like the ciabatta bread, its a nice touch.  And I love the sweet potato chips that come with it.  I thought the patty was a bit thin, so even though I ordered it medium rare, it was still cooked through.  Overcooking good beef is just a crime.

2007-11-04,5.0,"Honestly, this is my favorite restaurant. I have gone several times over the past 3 years and I have never been let down. Everything from their homemade potato chips topped with Parmesan cheese and truffle oil to their scallops is delicious.  One major recommendation: don't make any modifications to the dish that you order. One thing I discovered is that the chef, Susan, is amazing at pairing flavors and really knows what she is doing with the combination of all the flavors on the plate. Even if you don't like brussel sprouts, like me, don't replace them. Susan finds a way to make everything awesome. They also have daily specials which everyone should check out, for instance on Mondays they have fried chicken and Tuesdays they have a 10oz. Kobe beef burger, yum! Oh, and if you're not that experienced with pairing wine and food, they do it for you right on the menu. It's great to avoid feeling like a moron asking what goes with what. The bartenders make great drinks too. I like to go here often because I don't feel like I am breaking the bank for an great dining experience. I think the most I've ever paid for an entree was $23. Obviously if you drink and want to do the whole appetizer and dessert thing you end up spending more, but its still not bad for what you get. The location may not be the best for everyone, but if you drive its easy to find parking. It is on Chicago Ave. so you can take a bus, but that's not for all. The service is always great too.

For those of you who have visited May Street Market (one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago) this reminded me of it, but West Town Tavern is a bit more casual. The Menu: My fiance commented that he thought it was somewhat limited and while there weren't a ton of choices I think they covered it well. Fish people like myself: a few different options such as tilapia and scallops. Carnivores: plenty for you too choose from as well whether it be duck, a porkchop, or beef! Vegetarians: noticed a pasta or 2 for you too! I started with the roasted tomato soup, which had shrimp in it...and it was absolutely delicious! My fiance doesn't like tomato soup, but after trying it he admitted it was pretty darn good! He had a salad (can't remember which one), which he seemed to enjoy as well.   Now on to the main entree...scallops for me (if they are on the menu there is a 98% chance I'm going to get them) while my fiance went with one of the specials of the evening- some type of cod. Both the scallops and cod were cooked to perfection and with the delicious sides they came with (the risotto served with my scallops was pretty terrific) we had no problem cleaning our plates.   As for dessert...i could have ordered anything off the menu! The devil chocolate cake was calling my name, but since my fiance isn't a huge chocolate fan (I'm working on that :)) we shared the apple turnover instead served with caramel ice cream and caramel sauce...so good that I almost forgot how much I wanted that chocolate cake! The service: Elias was our very attentive waiter and while we were unable to understand his heavy accent (I think I asked the poor man to repeat the specials 5 times) he served us with a smile throughout the entire meal! The Price: You're probably thinking that a meal this good with excellent service in a fabulous atmosphere is pretty expressive....wrong! For the quality of the food and the experience we found it to be pretty reasonable. Our meal came out to about $100, but this included salad, soup, 3 drinks (forgot to mention they pair each entree with a wine selection...love it!), 2 entrees and a dessert.  Not bad at all! If you haven't given West Town Tavern a try yet you must go...and look for us because I think we're about to become regulars! PS- For those of you worried about parking situations at restaurants you'll be happy to know there are plenty of metered spots available outside this restaurant! Edit 1/28/08: Another delicious meal at West Town Tavern! This time I ordered the tilapia- delish, although I think I prefer the scallops. But I also discovered their homemade chips- oh my goodness! I broke my weight watchers diet for these chips and it was so worth it....",0.9979,0.766,0.182,0.052,0.6575016534391536

Food was excellent... both the pot roast and beef tenderloin were spectacular.  And the scalloped potatoes - they're perfect! The service was good, although it took our server quite a while to initially get to us after seating.  Once contact was established, though, she was very attentive.

2007-09-08,4.0,"This could be my new favorite place to grab a delicious dinner in a cool neighborhood spot.  West Town Tavern came highly recommended to me and it did not disappoint on a recent visit. The fact that it has the word ""tavern"" in its name is a bit of an ""undersell"".   In my opinion- there is nothing tavern like about it. The space itself is worth writing about- large dark wood bar, tin ceilings, wispy curtains breaking up the space and a large framed mirror on the back wall creating an illusion of space when it is really just an intimate spot. We started with a couple of appetizers, the flatbread and the spring rolls.  The flatbread was sort of like a mini- pizza with a crispy crust loaded with mushrooms, leeks, mozzarella cheese and truffle oil.  I couldn't stop eating it , it was so good.  The shrimp spring rolls were served with a peanut dipping sauce and were also tasty. As for entrees- I ordered the pot roast with garlic mashed potatoes and my friend had the trout that came with fingerling potatoes.  Both were delicious but the pot roast was so tender and flavorful that there was not a morsel left on my plate at the end of the dinner! I like that on the menu- they have paired wines with each of the entree's that they serve by the glass.  Makes trying something new effortless.  With the pot roast they suggested the Hop Kiln ""Big Red"" which was a blended wine of Zinfandel, Syrah, and Cab and was delicious. What would have made it a perfect 5 star rating?   I would have liked the staff  to be a little more engaging with us.  The host and the bartender, while efficient, never really made me feel like they really wanted our business. They went through the moves but a place like this should exude warmth and they portrayed efficiency.  And our waiter- while efficient- really did not know his stuff on the night we were there.  The specials were read to us and when asked what his favorite items on the menu were - he immediately suggested the specials which he just got done with barley being able to explain them to us.  He did do better when he got to the regular menu in being able to offer up a real suggestion. All in all- I thought this place was great.  I will go back to see if on another night the place ""warms"" up a bit to me.  But regardless- the food alone is worth the trip.",0.9947,0.822,0.148,0.03,0.46711234711234706

The rest of the menu ranges between very good and outstanding.  A lot of ""nice"" restaurants have high-quality produce but really don't know how to cook worth a damn, while others get the cooking right but are using ingredients no better than you could find at your local Jewel.  West Town Tavern gets both elements right and the results speak (and taste) for themselves in dishes like the tilapia.  Flavors range toward the bold/aggressive side but they can pull it off.  I personally like the atmosphere a lot too, which is modern and ""urban"" while still retaining a neighborhood-y warmth.  Service is professional and informed without veering too much to the pretentious side.  Basically, they get just about everything right, and this is one of the best restaurants in the city.  In fact, I'd give WTT six stars if they came to their senses and got a selection of draft beers.",0.9941,0.75,0.215,0.034,0.4104857142857143

For my main dish, I had the scallops with mushroom leek risotto.  Anyone who knows seafood knows that scallops are easy to mess up, but they were done perfectly here.  The boyfriend had that night's fish special, tilefish with a curried couscous that was out of this world.

2007-01-04,5.0,You have no idea how good this restaurant is.   Go there.  Eat the food.  Drink the wine. This is not a useful review-- it is a command.,-0.1793,0.746,0.098,0.156,0.30000000000000004
2006-12-19,5.0,"We tried this place on Friday night and were completely blown away. The prices are VERY reasonable, as compared to other restaurants in the city (all entrees are $18-21). We started off with pints of Cooper's Ale, which brought my date back to his time in Australia, and the tavern beer cheese - a ""cheeseball"" made with cheddar, parmesan, beer, tabasco, Worcestershire, and some spices - fantastic! My one complaint about the beer cheese is that I ate too much of it and couldn't finish the fantastic dinner that was about to come. I had steak - peppercorn-encrusted, in a zinfandel-reduction, which came with (sides included! what a concept) broccoli and tavern fries (really oven-roasted potato quarters that were fantastic). I've eaten at the Chop House, Nine, Capital Grille, Grill23 in Boston, LeLan, and I can say that this was one of, if not, THE best steak I have ever had. Perfectly cooked, so tender, I just wish I could have finished the whole thing! He had pot roast that fell apart, it was so tender. Good cappuccinos, and we liked our espresso pound cake with cherry compote and cappuccino ice cream as well. We will definitely be back, as soon as possible!",0.9672,0.85,0.124,0.026,0.526764705882353
2006-12-14,4.0,One of my favorite Chicago restaurants. I love that they use a lot of seasonal local produce. The pot roast knocked my socks off  and it came with the most delish Brussels sprouts. Tuesday night burgers are awesome too.,0.9062,0.751,0.249,0.0,0.62
2006-08-29,3.0,"My boyfriend and I first tried the Tavern a couple of years ago. . . it seemed like a standout place for the area, sort of a diamond in the rough.  The food is good, I'd call it contemporary American (kind if like upscale comfort food, you know, pot roast, turkey meatloaf, etc.). The antipasto appitzer is great to share, the pesto and roasted tomatoes are delicious alone, and the goat cheese just tops it all off. Judging from the mesmerizing aroma of truffles that constantly filled the air, I'm assuming the tavern chips are another popular appetizer.   The soups are good, and paired with another appetizer (such as the gnocchi) makes a decent meal. The desserts, unfortunately, are a little lacking. Nothing too special there. And I think the prices have gone up since my first visit, which I'm sure reflects the rising prices of EVERYTHING and probably can't be helped, but it will keep me from going back as much as I'd like.",0.9572,0.818,0.164,0.019,0.5671579743008315
2006-08-04,5.0,"I went to West Town Tavern a few months ago with my girlfriend based on a recommendation from a co-worker of mine, and we were both surprised with the quality of food, the friendliness of their staff and the price of dishes.  My favorite part is that the couple that owns the place, is usually near the main entrance and graciously thanks us for stopping by. Since our first night at West Town Tavern, I have been back three times, and whenever I try a different establishment, I am usually disappointed and wished I had gone to West Town Tavern instead.",0.8555,0.819,0.136,0.045,0.4616666666666667
2006-07-20,4.0,"One of the best (upscale) casual restaurants in the city, with a great selection of California wines. The food is essentially comfort food, with thoughtful touches--all in all culminating in great flavors. This is definitely a neighborhoody place, where the professionals flooding into the gradually gentrifying neighborhood come to unwind after a day at the office (seriously, if you look around EVERYONE has a glass of wine). This is a place I would take friends for a relaxed night of good wine, tasty food, and great conversation.",0.9875,0.662,0.338,0.0,0.5983333333333334
2006-02-16,5.0,"They nailed pot roast. It's heavenly. If you catch them when they've got crab cakes as an appetizer, get them. It would be really hard for this place to disappoint you. And aside from the incredible food, it feels far away. Like you're in a Gallery district of New York. It's a group friendly place so you can take your team.",0.7436,0.793,0.142,0.065,0.6792424242424242
2006-01-21,3.0,"I visited West Town Tavern not long ago...having lived in the area for over 5 years, I figured I would give it a shot.  I would describe the food as American with French inspiration.  I would also describe it as overpriced.  The interior is elegant, yet comfortable.  The food is quite good, but it didn't blow me away...as the pricing suggested it should.  It would be a good place to grab a glass of wine before heading elsewhere.",0.8953,0.833,0.167,0.0,0.48571428571428577
