2017-03-06,4.0,"First time at Buck's and it didn't disappoint! We arrived at Buck's at 7p.m. and fortunate enough to find street parking only 50ft away from the entrance. On a Saturday night when the Hawks are playing and Division St. bars are packed, I say we got lucky! lol   Immediately upon entering, the restaurant felt warm and inviting! I noticed the lounge area with comfy couches and chairs for a more intimate cozy section for drinks & apps, then the bar to the left that had the Hawks game & Pinocchio playing on the screens, and lastly into the dining room with wood topped tables under the illuminated string lights.  From my chair I also noticed a selection of board games at the high tables nearest the bar and a book shelf full of DVDs and more board games to choose from! Having to compete with Blue Line Club Car & Geek Bar Beta, whom both offer table side gaming,  I thought this a great effort from Buck's in making ones experience a little bit more fun & enjoyable! We ordered: 2 PIECE CHICKEN & BISCUIT- the homemade batter was fried to perfection, not greasy, incredibly crunchy and the chicken was juicy! The biscuit was so soft and came with butter & jam. Please let me note that the butter was among the most decadent and dense I've ever tasted. Very wholesome and very freshly whipped.  MAC & CHEESE- defiantly not your average Mac & Cheese. An array of hearty big noodles in a white creamy cheese sauce, topped with bread crumbs. So incredibly  cheesy that on the last bite it accidentally  oozed onto my shirt!...proud of it! Lol  OG- Pimento Cheese Sauce aka ""The Caviar of the South."" That's exactly what's smothering this hunky piece of white chicken thigh and freshly baked biscuit. A fork and knife sandwich, essentially. The most amazingly crafted and delicious entree at the table. Prior, I was a bit skeptical having read some negative reviews but, it was big and filling, not the size of a slider. I will def be coming back for more!  PECAN PIE- again freshly made and incredibly comforting. Great crust and candied pecans with a dash of powdered sugar.  Price tag for two with non alcoholic drinks   was $57. A great place for southern comfort food rendering your table with a bottle of honey to encourage you to douse your fried chicken. Also, a brunch spot that I hope to return to try. Overall, a great place that pays attention to detail down to the floral china platers your food is presented on.

2017-01-23,2.0,"So I was initially very excited for this; I love fried chicken, biscuits, waffle, and any combination thereof and I was itching for a good iteration in Chicago. Ordered their O.G. biscuit(boneless chicken thigh, pimento cheese, chaurice gravy), along with 2-piece dark meat fried chicken, 'kickin' style. Bib up, napkins ready, I awaited my food. And when I got it I was...instantly disappointed. The O.G. was as advertised, but probably a third the size of what I was expecting. It was a small biscuit, with chicken, cheese, and a little gravy. On a good day, it was probably the size of a slider at your nearest burger joint. And it was $11. Oh well...maybe it would taste really good. The chicken thigh in it though was fairly dry, the biscuit itself was hard, and the gravy was....alright I suppose. It wasn't the best gravy I've ever had, but I did use a generous portion of it to balance out the chicken and biscuit. It wasn't all terrible though. The 2 piece chicken, which actually had the same biscuit included in it, was actually quite good. The chicken was juicy, crispy, and the kickin flavor wasn't apparent at first, but upon each bite you could taste the spices and the juices giving a very apt kick as they hit your tongue(and were soaked into the bread provided). The biscuit here was much better than the one provided in the O.G. for some reason, and I could distinguish its flaky layers as well as the mild sweetness which crisped the exterior.  Overall, a more disappointing experience. Though 2-piece dark meat chicken was actually pretty good, the pieces were on the smaller side(the drumstick was the size of a drummette, the thigh wasn't particularly impressive either), and the biscuits were inconsistent. $9 isn't expensive, but it also isn't particularly cheap for a 2 pieces of chicken. The O.G. was just sad, especially considering I spent $11 on it. The chicken search will have to go on.",0.9809,0.8,0.138,0.061,0.6380208333333331

But the garnish on top was like lentils or something and weren't a great accompaniment. Just a nice sour cream Chipotle drizzle would have been great. Boyfriend had the fried chicken and biscuits and said the dark meat was excellent but the white meat was dry and not good. So - order an app or side and only get dark meat.

But probably the best thing they have are the biscuits. Decent beer list but if I were you I'd order one of their craft cocktails. Carriage House was cool and I always enjoyed my meals there. Buck's is a worthy replacement.  We do a thing where every time the Bears win we order Victory Chicken the next day (idea taken from someone else).

Let's start off with the good; the fried chicken and biscuits were pretty tasty.  I'll definitely be back just for those two.  The biscuits were actually amazing.  Very buttery and flaky.  The kickin' style fried chicken was not spicy at all, but had good flavor.  Since the biscuit was amazing and the fried chicken was also good, one would expect the OG biscuit to be great.  Exact opposite.  The biscuit was soft and mushy while the chicken was just meh.  Pretty standard country fried steak.  Nothing to write home about.  The sides were all pretty standard, except for the collard greens.  The collard greens were quite unappetizing.  Very sour.  Wish the menu would have some sort of description regarding the collard greens.

I hate when the first time I try a place is a to-go meal, but I had a ton of work to get done so I had to concede. The food was ready within 20 minutes of me placing my order, and service for pickup was pleasant and quick. Now for the good stuff: the chicken was awesome! Great flavor, hot, with a crispy coating and juicy interior. Well done! The biscuits were good as well. Flaky with a good texture. The preservatives that come with are also quite good. The presentation is pretty straightforward and doesn't make you put a puzzle together to get to your food. Unfortunately, that's where the good ends. The sides leave MUCH to be desired. The mac and cheese doesn't last like much of anything. I also got the grits, just to try them out, and was pretty unimpressed. If only their cooks knew the magic of actually salting water before cooking the grits or pasta, this review would likely have gone in a much better direction.  But none of the afore-mentioned items were as horrific as the sweet potato pie! Any so-called southern restaurant worth it's weight should at least be able to do partial justice to a sweet potato pie but oh no, not this one. The pie was filled with vanilla extract, while completely lacking brown sugar, a hint of citrus, and the other spices that make a sweet potato pie so awesome. It tasted like unsweetened sweet potatoes thrown on a crust and served. Horrible. Next time, I'll stick with Gus' fried chicken. If this were based solely on chicken, Buck's would win, but what's chicken without it's sides? Gus' manages to get their sides AND their desserts right, even hipsters have to appreciate that.",0.9975,0.668,0.258,0.075,0.6253887269193389

Lastly, the sauces that were provided had too many flavors and weren't to my taste at all. I think Buck's can be summed up as a place with a great solid base with the chicken and biscuits but the sides and extras are a miss, with so much going on that it doesn't actually taste very good.

The first time I went to Buck's, service was terrible.  I shared the kickin chicken meal and had a biscuit and egg sandwich; we had to send the chicken back because it obviously had been sitting there for a while before it was brought to our table.  That messed up the entire experience (though the biscuit was amazing).  I was close to not returning, but the server knew she messed up and wisely comped an appetizer.  My second visit was much better.  I came with a group of 7 or so, and the food came out reasonably fast and tasted really good.   Last week, the third time was the charm.  Alex our server was terrific.  I went back for the biscuit and egg sandwich and the half chicken meal.  The biscuits really are wonderful.  I think I probably like the chicken at Gus's a little better because they have less breading, but Buck's sides are better and the space is cuter.  It looks like the service issues have been sorted out (I hope) so this place is definitely worth a visit!",0.9937,0.742,0.229,0.03,0.491574074074074
2016-08-18,2.0,"I think fried chicken is getting to be the ""hip"" food in Chicago these days, but I've found that few really do it good.  We started with the Devilish Eggs, which were excellent! I love the twist the smoked salmon gave them. Then we got the Mac n Cheese, which had good texture and creaminess, but you might as well call it Mac n Cream bc either the cheese was real bland or there wasn't enough. We topped it with their hot sauce with improved it tremendously.  Main course, I got the 2 piece dark and biscuit. The chicken started off good, it had a good crunch to it, but the flavor tasted like something burnt, and as I ate, I think excess amount of oil in the skin started to turn my stomach. The biscuits were good, though kind of dry, but the preserves you got with it was the star of the entire meal. My husband got the OG which he said was good, but like the aforementioned dryness of the biscuits, said it needed more sauce, which was only on the stop of the sandwich. My stomach didn't feel good at all leaving Bucks, and as far as chicken goes I'd say Harold's is a ton better, tho Honey Butter is still king in my book.",0.9951,0.748,0.225,0.027,0.6522435897435896

The biscuits are great as well (a bit on the sweet side.. but they do a good job on it).  The drinks are good. Bad: 1. No free refills on tea. This came to be a bit of sticker shock. You're charged $4 per drink. Have one ""refill"", that's $8 for you non-alcohol drinks. Also, the drinks are fed through the bar, so the waitress takes even longer to get your drinks situated. When the food is a bit high for what you're getting.. this is completely unreasonable. Stick with water the next time you go.  2. The service, unless you're at the bar, is not great.

The ambiance was super dark.  So dark I had to use my phone flashlight to read the menu.  I wouldn't call that family friendly. There was enough space for us all as we were the only table inside when we were seated My sister and I ordered iced tea. It was so strong it smelled like coffee. We both love strong tea but tea that strong should be served sweet at this southern restaurant and with a healthy dose of lemon in my opinion.  I ordered the fried green tomatoes as an appetizer. They were not hot or crispy when they arrived to the table.  I expected the chicken to take a while but the app took a while too which leads me to believe it sat in a window waiting to be delivered.  The chicken is the star of the show for sure. It came hot, juicy and crispy. The Mac and cheese had a cheesy smokey thing going on and was very flavorful. The greens (though we as a family LOVE our greens prepared with vinegar) were as my 5 year old described ""too strong"". The vinegar was over powering.  The biscuits were amazing, though I would've appreciated them more had they come out hot. The amount of time it took to get the chicken the biscuits (which we had to ask for after the rest of the food arrived) could've been baked to order.  Maybe they were and the aloof,  preoccupied server just didn't bother to make sure we got them. The apple butter they were served with is delicious.  The service was the cause of the 3 star review. The waitress was wack and inattentive and spacey like she didn't want to be there.  She also charged me and my sister's credit card twice for the wrong amounts and I've contacted the restaurant 3 times since Monday and no one has called me back yet to address it.

The restaurant is huge, and has plenty of tables for outdoor seating- perfect for summer days. We cycled through a couple of waiters (apparently we were right in the middle of them changing), and everyone was incredibly friendly and nice. Looking over the menu initially, we were intimidated to see the number of fantastic options available. I stuck with the classic and ordered the Chicken & Biscuit ($9), with two dark meat pieces and kickin' for that spicy flavor. The fried chicken was seriously on point. Golden, crispy, and not over-fried to the point where the batter takes dominance over the actual meat. Despite it being kickin', it was not at all spicy. The biscuit came out hot and steamy, ready to be buttered and consumed. We drank that all down with a few pitchers of Brunch Punch, which tasted like Ginger Beer mixed with Grapefruit. It was a refreshing and tasty way to start our day. Definitely looking to come back again to try more of their items. Everything looked amazing!",0.9886,0.791,0.182,0.027,0.5276753712237583

My bf and I ordered 1/2 bird kickin style, collard greens and mac and cheese. After waiting for about 15 minutes, I realized none of the other tables had food on their tables. I started to notice how antsy everyone was becoming. Everyone kept looking towards the kitchen to see if any food was being brought out. A little later I saw a platter of chicken brought out to a family who has been there longer than us and they had their food wrapped up immediately to go. Uh oh. The fryer in the kitchen must have been broken or something. Service was at a standstill. We finally got our food after waiting more than 30 minutes and the food looked delicious! I grabbed the chicken breast, cut into it and saw pink juices run out and pink meat with a little blood. :( My bf's chicken leg was fine, though. I immediately told our waitress who then took the whole platter of chicken away. The mac and cheese was pretty good, but the collard greens were a little too sour for me. We waited another 10-15 minutes for our chicken to be brought out again. And when I cut into the chicken breast, the meat was pink in the center, again! It wasn't as undercooked this time (no red blood), but I didn't have the heart to send it away again. I also didn't want to wait around any longer. I ate the cooked edges of the chicken breast and called it a day. No apologies for the extra long wait or for the undercooked chicken.

My friend devoured the chicken, so I took that as a good sign. But the clincher was when rando dude literally walked up to the table next to me and stole the left overs that someone had accidentally left in the to go container. All happened in seconds...and in a suit. Well played, sir. The chicken police would never suspect you. Misses: 1) shrimp and grits. How heart breaking. Grits were lumpy and flavorless. And we got two shrimp and two empty heads. What? So weird. We left most of it untouched.  2) the mac n cheese. Say what? I know, I know. The most heart breaking of foods to go wrong. But dear yelpers, pass on the Mac. Maybe just our batch was overcooked, but it was also pretty bland. I almost cried. 3) And lastly, the fried green tomatoes. These had so much potential. Crispy, perfectly fried fresh tomatoes. But then... Dum dum dum ... They throw this awful cold black eyed peas mixture on top. Lordt! No. Skip skip skip. So if you're in the neighborhood and craving a good drink with some killer biscuits, great table service, and a cranky greeting at the door. This. Is. Your.

2016-05-13,3.0,"If I could give this place a 3.75, I would. But alas that is not an option so I will only give it 3 stars. The reason I'm giving it a 3 is because the service was sub par and the music was far too loud. Our server was very kind and made sure we had what we needed, but she didn't go above and beyond. There was no ""how's you food?"" or ""thanks for coming in tonight."" It kinda seemed like she didn't want to waste her time with us. And in regards to the loud music: no I am not an old lady who is super sensitive to noise. I'm an 18 year old girl who wanted to enjoy the company I was with and not feel the need to scream over 80s Rock hits all evening. I understand every restaurant has their ""ambiance"" but I just didn't like this one! The food was very good. My mom and I ordered the kale salad, a half a chicken and a side of mac n cheese to split. The kale salad was fresh and perfectly dressed. The chicken was very moist which is a plus! But it didn't seem like there was much meat on it. The biscuits were good--especially with honey on them! And the Mac n cheese was so-so. Honestly, Kraft Mac n cheese would have been tastier to me. But that's not really discounting the restaurants Mac n cheese because Kraft is legendary. Anyway, the food was filling and fun!

Let me start by saying the atmosphere here is quaint and reasonably moderate in noise level that a conversation can be had without yelling your whole meal. Service blew me away. Very attentive without being overbearing. Super knowledgeable about the menu and passionate about the food. I had the kickin fried chicken and biscuits, devilish eggs with smoked salmon atop and collard greens. Again I cannot stress how delicious everything was. The hard part was stopping myself from overeating. Chicken was succulent with good seasoning marinated in a house made hot sauce. Not too spicy just the right balance. Deviled eggs with fresh salmon=amazing. Biscuits were so fresh and melts upon eating. Greens were great as well with roasted garlic and vinegar cooked into them.   I highly recommend this place to anyone!

All in all with tax and tip, Grubhub collected $70. When our delivery arrived, it was a tiny bag with one side of Mac and cheese. One little side.

A driver can't go back and get the right order no matter what!! WHAT A HORRIBLE WASTE OF FOOD, and how completely frustrating it must be for restaurants. Long story short, Grubhub sucks, Bucks was awesome and had an employee deliver the food directly to us with some extras thrown in. It was above and beyond.

I could eat them all day. But what brings my stars down this much is the service, which I think they are still figuring out. Last time I was there it seemed somehow understaffed (though it was not busy, just steady) and we waited almost 45 minutes for our food with zero acknowledgement that somehow a salad and two biscuit sandwiches were still not on their way. Some random guy walked past at one point and said, ""Still waitin' on your food, huh?""... that was it. We had to ask multiple times for water, and our waitress was MIA for most of the night. I had a hair in my sandwich, which is annoying but I'm not about to throw a fit - but when I told one of the other waiters he said nothing and then walked away and waited for my waitress to show up, which was a little uncomfortable. She took it off the bill and was very polite about it, to her credit. Finally, we gave our card to the waitress and she disappeared with it. Five minutes later and I look around to try to find her... she's standing at the bar chatting with the bartender, clearly in no rush. It was only when I made eye contact with her that she ran the card and then brought the receipt over (sans card, which she had left at the register but was pretty rude about when we asked her to check for it). That's just... not okay. Both from a service standpoint and just the basic etiquette of not standing around holding my credit card. Anyway, great biscuits but not worth the wildly frustrating service and wait times. Hoping that they find their groove at some point and make dining there a more pleasant experience, but for now it's not something I want to inflict on myself or my friends again.",0.9611,0.827,0.106,0.067,0.480976430976431

While the furniture and layout of tables has changed, it had a similar vibe. The front area is now loungey, though, which looked nice and comfortable. There was a ""please seat yourself"" sign at the front, so we did, but we did have a server for our table.  I ordered a glass of wine while my friend had a drink and we both happened to order the same food item: the OG fried chicken sandwich. It was....just ok. Fried chicken was pretty average, the biscuit seemed a little on the dry side, the pimiento sauce was good. It just really wasn't worth the calories to me. I probably wont be ordering it again, but that's because I think I'll only be back to Buck's for drinks-only outings. I think it's a great place for just that, especially because it falls perfectly in the middle between sports bars and craft cocktail bars. It's casual enough, but also nicer than just going to a bar. I can imagine a lot of Tinder first dates happening here.  It wasn't very busy, but then again it was a cold Monday evening. Service was friendly. Prices were fair.

I've never had Greens that were so vinegary in all of my life. Then, they put garlic cloves in there to make matters even worse. Yuck. I had them replaced with grits, which were average because they were far too runny. Also, $5 per side (everything's a la carte) was over the top for the kind of average sides that made their way to our table.  I ordered a lemonade when I first say down.

2016-01-26,3.0,"Buck's menu is southern-influenced with the main focus on none other than the fried chicken. The menu is kept short but several items stand out. We kept our meal simple. We started off with the broccoli cheddar slaw. The broccoli is intentionally half-cooked and it's drizzled with shreds of cheddar cheese, mayonnaise, vinegar, and seasoning. It was unique and tasted great, but I'm a little hesitant to pay $4 for a few pieces of broccoli.  With the main course, we each ordered the two-piece dark chicken in which one was traditional and the other was kickin. Each order was served with their homemade biscuits. I can probably write a paragraph on why the biscuits were the star of the night, but I will keep it short. The buttery-rich biscuits were served right out of the oven. They were delicately browned, with plenty of moist from the steam. Each biscuit had a very fine-grained crumb while staying flaky, fluffy, and tender. You can apply their homemade preserves and butter, but I think they were perfect as is.  As for the fried chicken, if you can't handle much spice, traditional is for you. The kickin' sauce can leave a slight burning sensation on your tongue. The sauces are distinctive but I was distracted by several things. The batter is seasoned but it was also extremely thick. That lead me to believe they fried the chicken on high heat in which the outer layer was well cooked but the meat on the inside was still pink. The dim lights in the restaurant can really be a hazard for such situations. So I would urge you to cut into the chicken before taking a bite. Nobody would want to consume raw chicken meat by accident. Also, each piece of chicken was dripping in oil. Somebody in the kitchen must have forgotten to drain the chicken on a rack because I felt like I was taking sips of cooked oil.",0.8976,0.877,0.073,0.05,0.5372494599417674

I had never had salmon in my deviled eggs and that really changed & elevated the flavors. My friend had the dark fried chicken meal ($9) which came with a biscuit. Very solid chicken! It was moist with great flavor and that skin! Crispy and packed a punch of spices that was just right. For my main, I had the cheese & egg biscuit ($4) then added bacon (for an extra $2). I absolutely loved this! I've been looking for my new go to breakfast biscuit place since Endgrain closed and I do believe I've now found it in Buck's.

The first time was the first week it was opened, after there was a wait at Smoke Daddy and we figured we'd check out another option. I'm so glad we did! Buck's chicken is moist and incredibly flavorful (we all got the kickin' flavor, but the table next door told us that they preferred the overall flavor of the traditional), and prices are reasonable. The portion sizes are also pretty large. I got a 2 piece and my friend got a half a chicken. When they first brought mine out, I was pretty convinced they had given me the wrong order. I got a full breast, broken in 2 pieces and fried, and a large, meaty wing. The 2 piece is nice because it gives you the option of white or dark meat. All chicken orders come with their moist, dense biscuits with butter and preserves (which I'd highly suggest). Another roommate with us got the O.G. sandwich, which she liked so much she got it again when we returned last week.  Drinks were also unique and reasonably priced. I got a $5 Tecate and shot of tequila combo, and roommate got a $5 Rye and Miller High Life.  The second time we visited, we all got the chicken and weren't going to drink since it was going to be a quick visit. When our waitress told us about their $5 40s of budweiser, we changed our minds. She also said since they were big, we needed to stay entertained, so she tossed us a pack of cards to play some games. With the relaxed vibe, it felt like we were sitting in a backyard playing games.  Only cons were somewhat slow drink refills/service a couple times (hoping this is just growing pains) and the paper order forms.

I know a thing or two about great macaroni & cheese, and was very impressed with this side (as with our other sides). To top it off, the vibe & decor is impeccable.

2015-12-17,5.0,"I'm a big fan of good fried chicken, so I decided to meet some friends here for dinner on a Saturday.  In the main dining room, the music is loud, and the tables are large, so be ready to shout at your neighbor.  But never-mind that, I'm here for the food: We tried both flavors of fried chicken.  Both were awesome.  Although I'm usually more into spicy breading, I found the traditional style to be more flavorful and the better option.  The deviled eggs are fancied-up with a bit of smoked salmon that works very well, and the fried green tomatoes are served with a pea salad and hot sauce topping that is also delicious.  We also had a quite good kale salad which really helped lighten up the heavy main dishes.  The weakest dish we tried was definitely the shrimp grits.  It isn't bad, just kind of bland and underwhelming. Overall a great place to get fried chicken and have some drinks with friends.",0.986,0.756,0.212,0.031,0.592687074829932
2015-12-17,5.0,"Best fried chicken in the city! Just like my Grandma used to make, looks like they stole her dishes too. Cute vintage touch. The slaw wasn't great, it was terrific! Light biscuits, killer Mac and best Kale salad I've ever had!! I love the interior, it's warm and inviting. The front of the restaurant is super sexy, I'll definitely be taking a date her more than once. This is my third time visiting. Steve at the bar was super helpful. Can't wait to come back",0.9907,0.539,0.399,0.062,0.5958333333333333
2015-12-13,3.0,This place is pretty mediocre tbh. They have some really good things and some bad stuff. Some of the worst grits I've ever had. They tasted like malt o meal. The chicken fried steak sandwich was ok but the hot sauce really killed a lot of the flavor. The Mac and cheese was fire. Fried chicken is on point and the biscuits are great. I will be sticking to the roost for my southern comfort foods,-0.0369,0.67,0.175,0.155,0.6888888888888888
2015-12-13,5.0,"Loved it!  Came in on a whim after seeing their post on Instagram. The ambiance was very cute and the concept was too.....just pick up a menu/ordering card, a golf pencil, and find your own seat. There were some couches and plush chairs in the front, but they were full, so we went to the back where he wooden chairs and tables were. Got two drinks......I forgot the name but it was with bourbon, honey lemon and spice.....pretty strong and tasty.. The bf got a weird Mexican beer/ jalapeño tequila shot combo....not my taste but it was a decent deal for $5. Ok, so we got a good amount of food:  1/2 chicken- I love crispy skin, and they delivered! Fried green tomatoes- interesting presentation with the pea salad on top, but I thought they ended up going well together. Deviled eggs - came with smoked salmon...solid Mac and cheese - the highlight of the meal. Well, aside from the chicken I guess. Creamy, cheesy, and crunchy. Biscuits - the bf likes biscuits, so he asked a few questions about how many came with the meal, etc. I guess she translated that into ""they must want a extra side of biscuits"" cuz we ended up with 3 extra and of course, a charge for biscuits on the bill. Didn't mind, cuz we ate them all anyway. Lol. Aside from them charging us for the side of biscuits we didn't ask for, it was good and I'll go back.",0.9924,0.795,0.185,0.02,0.5288461538461537
2015-12-11,4.0,"Stopped by Buck's last night for their second day of business as the former Carriage House steps into the light on its own.  I have to say:  my favorite visit to Carriage House was the Sunday southern dinner special, which was unlimited fried chicken, biscuits, greens, you know, the works, for I think $30 or $40 per person. So, that's basically the whole menu at Buck's.  We tried a couple of two-piece chicken combos and the OG chicken sandwich, plus a couple of the $5 beer combos (High Life and a shot of rye, or Coors Banquet and a shot of bourbon).  The fried chicken was incredible; I am a big fan of the breading on Buck's chicken, so that was a win.  We also grabbed an order of deviled eggs and the mac-and-cheese, and both are on point. Food-wise, Buck's is off to a great start, and the kitchen brought out food quickly, so the stumbles that a brand-new restaurant might have were not in evidence last night. The main fail last night was a mix of service and the new space.  For example, our server was at our table a ton.  I'm cool with people checking in on occasion, but at one point, we got maybe three visits in a 6-7 minute span.  Not enough had changed for us to make comments on, say, how a deviled egg was or if we had any more drinks we wanted to order.  Also, little touches like knowing who ordered what...dropping the food off at the right station around our table will hopefully come with time.  Finally, at one point, someone from the kitchen brought out my OG sandwich, but did so without a word, or what I would have done: ""OK...the OG sandwich?  [wait for one of us to claim ownership]  The OG is our blank blank blank, with blank sauce on a blank biscuit, etc.  Enjoy!"" Instead, it was [swooping sound of plate being dropped onto table], server walked away, table left in his wake That was weird!  Also, both my wife and I loved the old space; this one feels more like a lounge that serves fried chicken (at least in the front of the house), almost like Chicken Shop but as if they let you order food and eat it downstairs in the Soho House area.  The space where main seating resides is fine, but save for the bar area, didn't resonate with me in a special way.  (I checked the ""Hipster"" box under Ambience; nothing screams hipster like eating fried chicken on a high-end sofa.) Otherwise, a great start and it's great to have a restaurant back in this location, since it's a three-minute walk from my house.",0.9931,0.857,0.12,0.023,0.49320346320346314
2015-12-11,2.0,"I've heard people rave about Carriage House and was really looking forward to going first the first time however ended up experiencing Buck's on their opening night instead.  Upon my date and I seating ourselves, which is Buck's new seating style, we waited and waited for a waitress to come by to explain the curious new menu format. Finally we had to flag someone down, who then explained that Buck's is the same staff, kitchen, and management - only the decor and menu have changed. She also explained the new menu; It is a questionnaire-like menu where you physically check-off which items you'd like to order and turn it in to the waitress which we did, each selecting two different biscuit ""sandwiches"". She also took our drink orders and left. After waiting a little while for the drinks a different waitress brought the correct drink for my date and the wrong beer for me. She apologized and took the beer back but never returned with the correct beer. My boyfriend finally had to get up and go to the bar, where the waitress was just hanging out & leaning on the bar, and remind her I was still without beverage. Finally, I then received my beer. No joke, the exact same happened when they brought out the food. They plopped down his entree and said mine would be right out. As his meal had a runny egg I insisted he start eating. He was more than halfway done with his food before the waitress even came to check on us. She asked how everything tasted. It was laughable as she didn't even notice that there was no plate sitting in front of me. We let her know I still had not received my food, which she quickly rectified but there was no apology, in fact she seemed confused as though she didn't even place my order with the kitchen.  The cherry on top came after we (once again) flagged down our server and paid... as we were leaving the hostess didn't say a word to us as we left; No ""Thanks for coming"", No ""Come back again soon"", No ""Have a nice night"" - nothing - just silence. We just walked out and looked at each other in disbelief. On a more positive note, the food was pretty decent - though super small serving sizes. The décor was super cute - the beer is served in a mason jar and plates are antique-looking... very casual/farm/chic.  Although we are local I am fairly certain we won't be going back - there are too many options in the area with far better service and equally good if not better food.",0.9898,0.832,0.122,0.045,0.5012966200466201
