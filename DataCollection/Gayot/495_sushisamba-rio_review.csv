The interior is awesome and modern, but I'm never very crazy about sitting extremely close to other couples, which is the setup here. The filet robata with manchego was awesome, so was the sea bass small plate. The giant corn side was interesting, and I had not seen that before anywhere else. We also tried several sushi rolls, and the fact that I cannot remember any of them by name probably signifies that they were really good, but not great.

Such a happy, lively place with a bright colors, trendy decor and good music.  2. The sushi was fresh and well presented. Even though some of the menu items definitely catered to the western palate overall the presentation and flavors were very good making this a place I will come again 3. Good service. The service was quick, professional and waiters/waitresses well informed.  4. Reasonable prices. Hard to find in this part of the city making it another reason to visit.

2014-07-23,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place. My old boss used to go to the Sushi Samba in London every time he was on a business trip, and I figured it had to be amazing in Chicago as well.  The decor of the place is great--- love the Pit area, which really is like a pit in the middle of the restaurant, a little lower than the rest of the restaurant, very cool atmosphere.  Beyond that, everything else was mediocre. I had the Nina Fresa cocktail-- a muddled strawberry martini-- apparently one of the best sellers, but just okay. Nothing special. Ordered the bobo Brazil--- of which I could barely taste the wagyu beef. The veggies in the roll overpowered the taste of the wagyu.  The Samba Rio roll was alright--- I like lobster... it was good. But nothing to write home about. The sea bass on the Robata menu was pretty good though--- that was done well. I'll give credit for that! Service wasn't bad either.  But overall, I'd come here for the ambiance, but not the food. Whatever, I just wanted to try it and see for myself.",0.9908,0.779,0.214,0.007,0.4944331065759637

The manager -- I believe his name was Scott -- came right over to our table with a round of free shots, which had acai puree and rum and were enjoyed by even the less enthusiastic drinkers in the group. More importantly, Scott welcomed the table, congratulated the bachelorette, and kept an eye on us all night, popping over to address a couple of delays and minor service issues. The food was excellent. Everyone at the table seemed happy with her choices. The Pacific rolls were perhaps the best rolls I've ever had. We also appreciated the fact that the menu included  attractive options for three among us who do not care for seafood. Our waitress was sweet and accommodating. One dish came out late, and it was comped. Similarly, one of my cocktails was not exactly as ordered, so my shrimp ceviche (very tasty) was comped. I would also note that our waitress split the bill *by each girl's order* at our request -- this was a lot of work, and very much appreciated, since the cost of each girl's meal and drinks varied enough that it did not seem fair to split the bill into equal parts.

2014-06-30,1.0,"My husband and I chose SushiSamba because we were craving sushi and wanted a place with great food and a cool atmosphere while we were in town from Colorado for the weekend. First, the sushi was good- nothing super unique. We had made reservations, but walking in, the restaurant was pretty empty for prime time on a Sunday evening. This is usually a telling sign for what you can expect of food and service. They have a 50% off check-in deal, but it wasn't even listed on the menu. If you usually order a majority of rolls, this isn't the place for you. The only had about 6 specialty rolls. The service was extremely slow. Our party got a few small plates and a number of rolls. The waitress even advised us to not order too many rolls as it would take a while. They only had one chef making sushi. The atmosphere is cool, but when you are sitting in a brightly lit, empty restaurant the atmosphere is not so fun. I usually am one that likes to pick a restaurant with a cooler atmosphere if the food looks comparable. In this case, I learned my lesson. We had originally been debating between this place and Sunda and wish we would have chosen the other after our meal was finished.

2014-06-12,1.0,"On Monday June 9th, myself and 3 friends chose to have lunch at Sushi Samba. We were attending NeoCon, a 3 day convention, down the street at the Merchandise Mart. The place was not too busy and we were seated around 11:45am. Our waitress greeted us and pointed out the specials they had that day for NeoCon. She mentioned that the bento boxes would be the quickest. All 4 of us decided to go the quick route and each ordered bento boxes. Our waitress, Hayoung, didn't come back until 15 minutes later to take our order. We waited 15 minutes and still had no food. Another 15 minutes went by and still no food. Finally I waved her down to ask if the food was on its way because we needed to get back to the convention. She asked what time we needed to return. Why does that even matter to her? I told her we've been gone too long and still haven t gotten our food and asked if she could just check on it. 5 minutes later, the host comes to our table with 1 bento box. We thought it was one of ours so we accepted it. Then after looking at it we realized that neither of us ordered it. So I waived her down again and explained. She picked up the bento box and brought it to another table and set it down in front of another diner. We gasped. Eew! That diner clearly saw that she picked it up from our table and brought it to him. Poor guy, we could see that everyone in his group got their food except for him. We couldn't hear what they were talking about but she took it back and brought it to her manager who then took it from her. The host came to check on us and explained that it was his first day. Not sure why we needed to know that. Finally our food arrived. It took almost an hour! The place wasn't even busy. We scarfed down our food and asked for the check. We asked if Hayoung could create separate checks and she went ahead and did that. We each paid with credit cards and to make sure she did not mix up the bills, we each folded our tab around our credit card. Guess what? She still mixed up the checks.

2014-06-02,2.0,"I've been out of the Yelp game for a minute, but had to come back to see if our experience at Sushisamba was standard.  The good and only reason I gave 2 stars instead of 1: the atmosphere is trendy and very aesthetically pleasing. However, while the two dishes we stuck around to eat were OK, they were way overpriced for the quality. I've had better sushi elsewhere for much cheaper. The food wasn't the issue though.  The service was absolutely terrible.  Like, really really really bad...  First we came in with a $150 dollar gift card and were told there was nothing on it (I have found out today there is still definitely $150 left on it, but considering I am not and argumentative person, we assumed something was wrong with the card and sat down at our table anyway). It took us roughly 20 minutes just to catch a glimpse of our waiter to take a drink order. He seemed to sprint by our table and, without even stopping, would say he would be right over. I guess that's effort right? We decided to go sans alcohol for a few different reasons and ordered a couple green teas... you know, boiling hot water and tea bags. After another 20 minutes, our tea (not worth $8 dollars mind you) arrived, as well as an additional order of said tea. Everyone seemed very confused about the young couple who wasn't drinking on a Saturday night, I guess. No big deal, double orders can happen. I've worked in a restaurant. I know it's a thing.  However, after our waiter took our order of calamari and 1 roll, we never saw him again until our food arrived. The waitstaff in our entire area of the restaurant seemed very confused. We were offered another tables' meal before we were able to place our own. They brought us double orders of the hot tea that took forever to receive, and water wasn't refilled the entire time we were there.  After an hour and a half, 1 order of tea, 1 sushi roll and small dish of calamari, we got fed up with waiting, paid our $50 dollar bill (remember 2 hot teas, 1 small plate, and 1 sushi roll) and walked over to Zed 451. Our dinner there was incredible, the waitstaff were fantastic and funny, and we STILL spent less than if we would have stuck around for more of the train wreck that night at Sushisamba.",0.964,0.833,0.106,0.061,0.49649240855762594

The service was incredibly slow, both of my cocktails took at least 15-20 minutes to come to the table. The entrees seemed to take even longer, but the bad part here was that each dish came at a separate time, about 3-5 minutes apart. The first person was halfway finished by the time the last dish came. At the end, an extra roll was brought to the table that nobody ordered. When we told this to the waiter, he aimed he was too busy and left the dish on the table. When we got the bill, the extra roll was charged not once,  but twice. In addition, 5 of the drinks (all the same drink) cost 5 dollars more than listed on the menu.

Check in - I hate when people bark out ""do you have a reservation?"" before saying hello, so this was annoying.  Made reso via OpenTable, so we checked in then went to the bar for a drink as we were early. Ambience - Torn banquettes in the bar area, oontz oontz music playing... Drinks -  At the bar, my husband had a caipirinha which was way overpriced ($12) for the dixie cup sized drink he got.  Then, at the table, we were told about a special -  prosecco, St. Germaine & fruit which sounded awesome, however, it was a clumpy mess with hardly a bubble.  The waiter asked how it was and when we told him not good, he didn't offer to get something else, just that he'd let the bartender know.  Later, we flagged down the Manager b/c the waiter was nowhere in sight, and my husband asked for a beer reco...he chose a Japanese beer which was decent, but not great.  Later, when we got the bill, we realized each beer was $12!!!  Thinking the manager could've mentioned the price, at least.  It wasn't worth $12.  Not even $12 for a six pack!! Food - Our waiter kept pushing a chef's tasting menu (yet never mentioned the price) so hard that he must've been being paid commission on it.  When we said we planned to order for ourselves, he seemed miffed and pretty much ditched us the rest of the time.  The sea bass anticuchos were amazing and the wagyu gyoza were good, too.  The rest was marginal.  Asked specifically for one of the rolls to have the salmon swapped out...which didn't happen and when we asked what the fishes were (to the Manager since our waiter was nowhere to be found)...and the waiter told us..tuna, salmon, etc. right when the waiter walked by and he just said..""uh, sorry"" and kept going.   Chatting w/the Manager and mentioned how good the sea bass was and it was the reason for our return, he said he'd sent something over for being return customers.  While we hadn't asked for anything, the thought was appreciated.  Would've been even better if it showed up.  We waited a bit and couldn't stand sitting there any longer.  Got the check complete with $12 beers despite the waiter saying he'd remove them. I give it one star for the food.  Service was terrible and even worse because the waiter had no clue he was not good.

Had reservations and came into SushiSamba on Saturday night for my friend's 30th birthday dinner.  It was a party of 8 (which our server should have easily been able to handle) and although we had 2 people in the group that were gluten-free, they made it not an issue when we booked the reservation. The dinner started at 7 and ended at around 10 (not our choice but the lack of good service). We started with drinks and appetizers and then all went around and ordered in a quick fashion.  The food awkwardly came out because the BF and I ordered meals from the kitchen since we weren't feeling sushi and everyone else got theirs from the sushi bar.  I ended up getting my tempura shrimp and scallops first and waited politely until everyone else got their food.  The next plate to come out was the BF's chilean sea bass (15 mins after mine).  And 15 mins after that, the rest of the group got their sushi boat.   One of the gluten-free people got theirs on a separate plate and it was fine but the other had to reorder hers because of the fact that they stuck her 2 gluten-free rolls in the middle of everyone else's normal sushi.  Just one more delay. The most annoying part is that the server//food runner had no idea why you couldn't put them all together.  It seems like a more common/standard thing lately, properly educate your staff. I have no complaints about the taste of the sea bass or the shrimp/scallops that I had for dinner and the sushi looked quite good.  The dessert was very good also. Here are my main issues with why I'm giving a 2 star: 1. 1/3 of the stuff on the menu as an appetizer that I had asked the server about they were out of.  What?!!  2. The service was exceptionally slow.  I could have fallen asleep at the table if I would have been with boring people. 3. We get the bill and it was an absolute cluster of nonsense.  With having 8 people and 6 of those people being ""couples"", you would have thought the guy would be smart enough to separate these things and also add gratuity (Isn't it normal for groups 6-8 to add that??)  In any case, although the food was fine, I would not come back here.

As someone who works in the food service industry and whose father has 35+ years experience, it was apparent to us that there were an array of problems that would be unacceptable from a dive bar let alone a restaurant that purports an upscale atmosphere.  Our waiter was all over the place and service and food were extremely inconsistent, a sign of poor delegation and planning by the manager.  Two of our orders didn't get put in at all and one came out wrong.  Some of the food was good but some was just bad.  We waited about 30 minutes for each round of drinks which were routinely incorrect, bad, or lacking garnish (a dirty martini with no olives? I think not). The bathrooms and facilities were blatantly filthy and when I looked in one of their coolers, it was moldy and disgusting.  The chairs and tables are too close together and we moved twice and both times had either a wobbly table or at least one wobbly chair.  When we finally settled on a booth, the back of the booth was being used to store unused items and it was extremely dirty.  These are things that just show how lazy the staff and manager are.    Finally, as someone of South American heritage, I can assure you that just because you describe something as ""Peruvian"" on the menu doesn't mean it is.  The ""choclo"" was canned hominy and the Chicha (a traditional Andean drink) was...not that at all.   The most infuriating part was that, even after politely describing all of these problems to our server and, later, manager, no one did a thing or acknowledged their responsibility or even our entire table again.   I gave this two stars because, while most of the food was ok, it's not remotely worth the price or the amount of hair you will tear out just trying to tolerate the experience.",-0.9934,0.832,0.021,0.148,0.6229838709677421

Small pieces of fish, rolls that were mostly made out of vegetables... We could deal with all of that though, Yelp reviews did not promise high quality food in Sushi Samba.

We arrived early and would have happily sat in the bar and had cocktails but they were able to seat us right away. The decor is really inviting. Pretty colors and a combination of comfy benches and chairs. We were seated next to another party of two but despite them being next to us, I didn't feel like we were crammed together. Our server and other staff in general were very attentive. She explained the Brazil, Peru, Japan fusion concept and told us about the menu. Their cocktail/sake/beer/wine list is extensive. We tried the Sambatini to start, which is a cocktail that changes regularly. This one had muddled berries and mint . I personally thought it was a little too boozy for my liking but the hub slurped his down. We sampled other cocktails throughout our dinner and they all were really good. My personal favorite was the Lemon Samurai.  As for the food, hub had the tuna seviche to start, and I had the grilled ika okonomiyaki. The seviche was super fresh and really delicious. My appetizer was one of the most interesting things I've eaten in a long time. It's a Japanese pancake with these huge corn kernels and pieces of squid in it. I was a little skeptical at first but the flavors and texture were so nice. For our main course, we both had the sushi sampler. I loved the neo Tokyo roll and all the nigiri pieces were fresh and had their own little interesting garnishes. I love sushi, and this stuff really impressed me. We also ordered a separate roll to share, the Pacific roll, which was heavenly. It has lobster and asian pear in it...sounds like a strange combination but it works perfectly together. For dessert I had the mochi and hub had the tropical tapioca pudding. Both desserts were really yummy. I really enjoyed my meal at SUSHISAMBA and would recommend it to friends. I'd go back myself just to tackle more of their awesome sushi and drink menus. I also really appreciated that it's a fusion restaurant but they don't force it. Their pair flavors from the different cultures in ways that work without just trying to be a concept restaurant.  One other thing to note in our experience...there was a mistake made on our check [they charged us for dessert which was included in the restaurant week menu] and our server was quick to correct the problem for us.

Our server took our order fairly fast, but the actual service was slow. It took quite a while for our dishes to come out even though it wasn't a busy night for them. When our order came out, I was severely disappointed with each dish. The mushroom tobanyaki (poached organic egg, wild Japanese mushrooms, garlic chip) was way too salty. After the first bite, we all decided that we should send the dish back. When they asked if we wanted a replacement, we decided to skip it as we weren't too hungry to begin with and figured that we could be satisfied with just the seviches and tiraditos that we ordered. We ordered an assortment of four seviches and tiraditos for $33.00 based on our server's recommendation. Unfortunately I did not like any of the dishes we ordered. We ordered the two yellowtail seviches and tiraditos and one kanpachi sashimi tiradito, but unfortunately I don't remember our fourth option--It might have been the salmon sashimi seviche. The fish wasn't fresh at all, and it made me worry that I was going to get a stomachache from eating raw fish that wasn't fresh. Luckily, that didn't happen at all. Apparently I now have a stomach of steel.  I used to work for a destination management company, and I regret that I once recommended this restaurant to some of our clients without having tried this place out myself.

Upon entry, with techno music blaring, it felt like we were walking into a trendy nightclub. The atmosphere was a tad much for my taste. The lighting was pretty nice. Beads hang over the sushi bar, which has old, scratched up, acrylic windows. one could barely see through to watch the chef prepare cuisines. For a place that is trying to be on the hip, upscale trendy side, the place could definitely use some updating. The restrooms are horrible! Dirty and almost no privacy. But when you gotta go, ya gotta go! It wasn't easy using the stall, when you can see people eating in the dining area through the cracks in the door... twas a little awkward. As we looked over the menu, we were disappointed that there weren't many options for sushi rolls, which is what we were all in the mood for. We each placed our orders with the watress, who seemed pretty nice, she kept our drinks full, so service was pretty good. While we waited for our food, my friends kept shaking their heads at the table behind me and kept trying not to laugh. there was a guy accompanied by two women who were intixicated. They told me not to look back because they were giving him a lot of attention. Later I learned that the women also pulled their skirts down to show him tattoos. Whatever, just glad I wasn't facing them. When the food finally arrived, we ate, we were pretty hungry after not eating the whole day. But as I ate my spicy tuna roll... I couldn't help but regret choosing the place to eat. I wished that we had turned around the moment we walked in and instead go somewhere else, anywhere else but this place. It was too late.

We saw our waiter twice and it was the worst service I've ever experienced and I'm not exaggerating.  They messed up each one of our sushi orders (after serving our one friend first and the rest of our food following 15/20 min after). I ordered a simple shrimp tempura and it was disgusting. I had 2 pieces and that's it. It took them 50 minutes to bring a bottle of wine to our table and it wasn't even the one we ordered because it was out of stock. We had to ask to be helped and flag anyone down. We were sat down at 8:45 and didn't leave until 11 because it took that long with all the mess ups. One of our friends had a food allergy and she told our waiter, he even gave her a gluten free menu and STILL brought out food that wasn't modified for her allergy and she was kinda blamed for the mistake instead of the waiter taking responsibility. The manager although very kind and offering us a round of drinks (which we didn't want because we didn't want to be there any longer) was not super accommodating with our bill either. We still ended up spending a lot of money for horrendous service and sub-par sushi to say the least. I never write reviews, this is the second one ever and I needed to do it to give future customers a heads up that they should go to many of the other amazing sushi places in Chicago instead of wasting your time and money here.",0.4634,0.822,0.092,0.086,0.4959054834054834

2013-10-07,5.0,"Yesterday my friend and I visited Sushi Samba in Chicago. It was a special occasion and wanted to take my out of town friend somewhere cool with a great atmosphere. As I live in London, the Sushi Samba there is a favourite of mine and always a place I take friends and relatives. As I wanted to have a proper catchup with my friend in a non-noisy setting, noon was perfect before it starts getting busier in the evening.  I simply do not know where to begin as our entire experience was beyond exceptional.  Food:  I was a little anxious as I believe London is one of the greatest culinary capitals of the world- but I could not have been more wrong. Our meal was simply heavenly.    We had: Kobe beef sushi, Yellowtail taquitos (avocado, peruvian red pepper), Seabass robota (skewers with peruvian corn), El Topo (salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, mozarella), and South American frittata with strawberry prosecco and because we weren't quite full;)... for dessert: Red Chocolate Chili Peppers: Peruvian chili mousse, red pepper tuile, raspberry-red pepper sorbet, chocolate crumble We both commented on the meal even this morning and I was dreaming of the seabass robata and el Topo :) Service:  We were looked after superbly by Ryan and Robert- these guys really need to be flown over to the London restaurant to show how service should be. I have severe seafood allergies and was really impressed how Ryan cared to make sure I would be ok, running back and forth between our table and the chef. I wasn't made to feel like a nuisance, which I sometimes am made to feel, which was refreshing for a change.  Robert patiently and enthusiastically answered (all) our many questions re the menu which he knew like the back of his hand, often recommending things after asking us what sort of things we might like.  They were both extremely pleasant, friendly, and super knowledgeable about everything. I wish every restaurant I ever ate out at could have these two, they really know how to make customers feel special and well cared for. A restaurant with good food is good. But a restaurant with good food and fantastic customer care makes a loyal customer.   ""One cannot think well, love well, sleep well, if one has not dined well.""  - Virginia Woolf Thank you to our wonderful chef who prepared our decadent meals and Ryan and Robert for the care they showed us and for making my dear friend's trip a very memorable one.

Its a really cool, contemporary looking place and is fun for a night out.  The food is great, I've been there twice and loved everything I've tried. The bad.... I had reservations for 7:30pm... We weren't seated until 9:15pm.  Are you joking? I understand with reservations you may not be seated right at the time but REALLY? An hour and forty five minute wait is completely asinine. Upon asking the hostess she just kept saying it will be ready in 10 minutes.. she said this about 4 times.  Ugh.  Honestly, I haven't been back since.  I don't really like waiting that long when I had reservations.  I would rather go to a subpar sushi place and get it right in.

2013-08-23,4.0,"I really love sushi samba and if it weren't for a bad visit last time, I would give it a five. I go a lot and the food is amazing. Yes it is a little pricy but its unique flavors you can't really get anywhere else. I have a ton of favorites on the menu. The best thing is the calamari. The sweet sauce on it is amazing and everytime I get it here I think about how it is the best calamari I have ever had. The sushi sambas in nyc dont have this menu item either so definitely get it here! My favorite roll is the bobo brazil roll which has beef. I love seafood and sushi, but the flavor combination is just awesome in this roll.  The yellowtail taquitos are also awesome, i would get one to try per person for an appetizer. All of the seviches are also great, just kinda small. Tuna tataki is also awesome. The service is usually hit or miss which is my issue. We went on new years last year and had an awesome waitress and the service was amazing. Since then it has been hit or miss. My friend and I came in last minute and sat at the sushi bar. There happened to be water dripping from the ceiling right next to us and we asked to move to another area that was open and they wouldn't let us.  The food came out so slowly also. We ordered a ton of small plates and also green tea with them. Our tea didn't even come out until after our first round of food came out, and that took around 20 minutes! Then when we wanted to order more food, it took another 20 minutes just for our waiter to come over after we kept trying to wave him down. I also never had my water refilled until the end of the meal and asked the waiter and other random people working there at least 3 times for water. I've never been so annoyed with not being able to get water at a restaurant. The food is spicy so they should definitely work on making sure people get their water refilled. The waiter was so unapolegetic saying im sorry we are so busy tonight that is why everything is taking so long. Besides this one experience I will still go back, maybe during less busy times not on weekends.

As for the current aspect, the last time I went the manager told me that they will be undergoing a interior renovation soon now that the place has been open for ten years.

However after this last time I just can't justify going back. Management of this restaurant is horrid. I had a party of 6 and and bill of close to $600 which is what you should expect  to pay at an exceptional  sushi restaurant in downtown Chicago. We started by ordering a bottle of sake. It was about a $100 bottle. The issue was we didn't get it until halfway through our meal because our server could not find a manager to get our bottle. Next we ordered some apps. The problem was they sent out some great apps however not one of them was one we actually ordered. Now on to the sushi. I asked if there was any special rolls. We were told by our server that they once again could not locate management to find out what the specials were. I ordered my usual rolls for the table and they were all delicious. Again a problem...about half the sushi we ordered actually came out. The server apologized and said the manager was going to come over...he or she never did. I asked for the bill, paid and left thoroughly annoyed. It took forever for everything and while the food we received was wonderful the rest was just too horrible to chance going back. Also they have not changed a thing about this restaurant since it opened. Everything is beat up and falling apart. Looks just terrible. Really kind of sad.

LOVED the strawberry cocktail that I had! I think it was called a nina fresa, would highly reccomend it.  For dinner, I ordered the chicken teryaki.  I decided to split it with a friend and was surprised that they called it a ""large plate"" because I could have finished if myself.   As far as positives go, it pretty much ends there. Not that the service was awful, it just definitely needs work.  The host/hostess that were there especially, don't seem particularly enthused with their job.  I feel that in any line of customer service, especially a trendy restaurant in Chicago, customer service should always be above and beyond, really making your customers feel welcome from the moment they walk in the door.  With that said, the host/hostess are the first impression, and they definitely need to step it up.  Our waitress was pleasant, only good things to say about her. Last thing...it was the end of June, on an 80* evening, and the restaurant was uncomfortably  hot.  The seating is so close together to begin with, add body heat, made for a most unpleasant feeling!

(i could review the boys we've dated all day long...and it would probably be the most entertaining day you've had in awhile. fyi).  after we ordered our first drink, our waiter took all of our cocktail menus and with regard to the food menu said, ""i'll just leave one in case you want to order later."" um. it's dinnertime. on a friday. and we never insinuated that we were only drinking. do we look fat or something?! we are hungry, dammit. and we each want a menu. thanks.  we eventually did order. and the food was...tired. and nothing special. not a wow-factor, but we already knew that. shortly after we finished our dinner and had one after-dinner drink our waiter asked if we needed anything else...to which we replied, ""not right now."" 3 minutes later. our bill was placed on the table. um. we still want to drink. so when he came back a few minutes later he asked if the bill was ready for him to take. we laughed and said, we needed another round. this happened THREE TIMES. three times, he put the bill on the table. and three times we each ordered another $12 or $14 dollar cocktail. so let's think about this. (12 x 3) x 3. not necessarily chump change . it was clear the waiter had some place to go. i don't really blame him...if it weren't for my girlfriends, i wouldn't wanna stay there either. and when we asked the hostess if we could speak to the manager, we never saw our waiter again. he really did just wanna get his tip and roll outta there. oh, and by the way, this was the first time in a very long time when a waiter did not receive our usual 20-25% tip.  now, with that being said, the manager was very apologetic and genuinely cared about our complaint. he sent us over another round of drinks and dessert and told us to stay as long as we want. we finished our drinks, looked at our watch (it was shortly after 12) and looked around the restaurant. it was empty. sorry, samba, you're a has-been. thank you for stepping aside for places like Sunda and Roka Akor.",0.9796,0.867,0.098,0.036,0.4144322344322344

So you may find a female attendant in the men's area. Anyway, now for the important stuff we got their Appetizer special and they allowed us to substitute pacific roll.. So we were happy campers. Two of us were stuffed after eating that appetizer special because it came with so much stuff. In addition to the pacific roll it had Kobe beef seviche, sashimi and a bunch of other stuff. But the weird thing is they had tuna and some other fish sliced. But it was king of weird eating that big a piece of tuna without the accompanying rice/roll part of it. So we improvised with wasabi, soy sauce, ginger and whatever else they had on the plate.  For dessert we got the samba split. Totally not what I was expecting. It had carmalized pop corn, banana, berries, scoops of ice cream and brulee. It was interesting. But didn't love it. All in all presentation was great and they have very creative dishes.

Little did I know he had been there before, with another girl, on the worst date of his life. He tells me this as we sit down and I have that stupid smile on my face like ""Look what I did!"" and quickly I felt like the night was going to be dampered. His date was a trainwreck because of the woman, not sushi samba so he swore up and down he was happy to give it a second chance. I tried to reinflate my sails and buried my face in the sake menu.   Highlights are as follows: CHAD! Our server was the friendliest and most attentive server I have had in a long while. He was knowledgable, personable and thorough. He made it clear he would work with the kitchen if we had any special requests and when we dared to ask for a substitute he didn't hesitate. We ended up with an amazing seafood dish big enough to feed a small family for the price of the pre-fixe special. He brought us a sake sample with our dessert which was the perfect end to an amazing evening. Proof that the quality of people you hire will result in a better business. I hope he is treated well and that others can learn from his great attitude.  The manager also thanked us as we paid our bill which was a nice touch.  The food was all fresh and really flavorful. The sake list is massive but easily navigated by the descriptions and assistance from the staff. I am not a sweets person but the dessert was really lovely, not over the top in sweetness which I like. We went on a Tuesday and it was only half full, which I like. I can tell its probably a really fun scene on the weekends andI would consider having a birthday party there. Music was an eclectic world mix and added to the inviting atmosphere.

It was pretty quiet at 6pm, but probably because it was very cold outside. I love the atmosphere inside - it is so hip and colorful! Very creative restaurant. My husband ordered different kinds of foods to try. We started with one order of the yellowtail taquitos..which btw was really good. The taste combinations of taco shell with fish is yum! Then we had an order of yellow tail sashimi tiradito (sp) and salmon tiradito (sp). The salmon one was soo good. I love the mix of the fish with the sauce and nut. The yellowtail was okay, but salmon is a winner!  We ordered 3 rolls - their special spicy tuna, salmon avocado, and spicy yellowtail. My husband really like the special spicy tuna.. I love the spicy yellowtail best. The sushi was really good. We also ordered several pieces of the salmon nigiri, yellowtail nigiri, and striped bass nigiri. My favorite nigiri was the striped bass! YUM!!!  We ended the night with the Samba split which was banana split with creme brulee, berries, caramel corn, and ice cream. This is such a creative concoction of food and I love the mix.  My husband and I had an enjoyable time. Our waitress, Rachel, told us they switched up their menu which is a plus because my experience at Sushi Samba differs than what I've heard from my friends who came here few years ago. Even my husband changed his mind. Rachel was really nice. We really liked that! I like friendly and nice service, so we gave her a good tip. Rachel also gave us each brazillian cookies at the end.

The Coco Leite was surprisingly delicious and we ended up three more at our table throughout the meal! We ended up ordering an assortment of stuff to share as a table: 1) Crispy Taquitos- we were originally going to order 1 Yellowtail and 1 Maine Lobster to try, but ended up getting 2 yellowtail at the suggestion of our server who swore that it was MUCH better. 2) Shrimp Robata - shrimp was a bit bland and didn't make too much of an impression.  3) Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass - great tenderness and always a favorite dish of mine at any restaurant. They definitely didn't fail to disappoint. 4) Unagi Tamago roll and Spicy Tuna Roll - i enjoyed both rolls but again didn't stand out as being amazing. But was solid overall. 5) Sashimi Sampler - Was fresh but nothing amazing again. 6) Dessert (Café com Leite Parfait and Samba Split) - Surprisingly both desserts were quite delicious and perfect to finish the meal. Both were unique and things I hadn't tried before anywhere else. The cafe parfait was not as sweet, but I loved the rich taste of cofee and creme.

They didn't look bad at all, but I hated the way one of the hostesses (or she could have even been a manager looked at us). Yes, one of them even had a backpack but so what.

They have sweet or savory options. Suprisingly they have a lot of options without seafood. The quinoa waffles are gluten free and come with fresh fruit.

2012-10-28,4.0,"I went here a couple weeks ago and it was pretty good!  I tried so many of the sushi rolls, I really don't even know which ones they were and which ones were the best - but they were all good!!  We had the edamame to start as well which was great, and we all had cocktails and they were also delicious. I did think it was a little weird they put lettuce in so many of the rolls, including the california roll - but I think that's just their thing!  Not really my thing, i admit I took it out of a lot of them, but hey, gotta mix it up right? My only complaint is that they were having a problem at the time with their roof, and it was raining outside, and the problem caused it to also rain inside in a certain part of the restaurant.  They sat us too close to the interior rain, and one of the guys I was there with got hit with raindrops the whole time.  We mentioned it, and they comped our drinks which was very nice of them.  Hopefully they have got this issue fixed and know where not to seat people if it happens again in the future. Valet parking was very nice since there isn't a parking lot or anything.  We would definitely return!",0.9873,0.776,0.178,0.046,0.5535714285714286

2012-10-24,4.0,"This place has always been my favorite sushi establishment in the city. I love their sushi rolls and the atmosphere. However, despite all the great times I've had here, sometimes it's overshadowed by a really off night of service. The last time I was there, my group of friends and I had a very pompous waiter who basically tried to convince us to change all of our orders, both drinks and food. He even went so far as to say my friend wouldn't like either of the drinks she was considering, just because he wasn't a fan of them (he told us). Someone ordered a beer that they didn't serve. Instead of telling us they didn't have it, he threw out the name of some Japanese beer, then rushed to go get it. When my friend said he didn't like it, the waiters explanation was, ""Well it's like the most popular beer in Japan."" For $9 each, you would think he could've offered to bring a different one, especially since he didn't tell our table anything about the drink before he brought it opened to our table. So watch out for the bald waiter in there (he's like the only one although his name escapes me at this moment). I give 4 stars because I understand this may not be the restaurant's fault if one server is a totally annoying prick and I've had many who are very nice and not overly pushy.

The food was served family-style, and everything was delicious. I particularly enjoyed the eel and calamari. One interesting note from the evening is that when they brought out the ""main course,"" which was a bunch of meat platters, all the guys dove at it like a pack of wolves. Truth be told, I was one of them.  Sushisamba was also very accommodating in regards to the preservation and deliverance of her birthday cake, which I am very grateful for.

They treated us to an amazing dinner, anything we wanted to order, but made suggestions for us which were outstanding. The service and food were exceptional!  We can't wait to go back and also try their other locations when traveling. Here are some of my recommendations based on what we've had, but I'm sure you can't go wrong with anything you choose off their menu: You must try the Sweet Corn Kakiage appetizer, I dream about this dish! It is so unbelievably good with the sauce! We had the Crispy Taquitos, and the Tuna Tataki which were also extremely fresh and delicious. We also had a mixed sushi plate with scallops, salmon and Neo Tokyo roll. We've tried almost all of their rolls and the presentation and taste have always been top notch, and it is always super fresh! I would have to say my favorite dish is still the Miso-Marinated Chilean Sea Bass. Sea Bass is my favorite fish, and I have never, ever...ever had it this good. Seriously ridiculous how they make it, and all of our guests also agreed with me that it was the best they ever had too!!  We also highly recommend Brigette their event planner.

We sat out on the small patio, which was fine by us, given how much of a scorcher it was that first weekend in August.  Our server was really prompt and attentive, so no problems there. For drinks, I ordered a Pisco Sour, and I believe my friend had a Mango Bubbletail. For starters, we nibbled on the scallops and duck breast - so savoury. My friend had one of the sushi rolls, which she loved. I have a love/hate relationship with sushi (my brain loves it, my stomach hates it), so I opted for one of the cooked Samba Rolls (the El Topo - with salmon, jalapeno, mozzerella and crispy onion), which was delicious.  Our desserts were amazing! I had a wonderful Café com Leite Parfait, while my friend opted for the Warm Chocolate Banana Cake.

Our friends suggested tonight to go to sushisamba. I was skeptical but decided to give it a try. We started with the shishito, which was overcooked and super salty. The sea salt was supposed to be 'sprinkled' on top. I tried the same appetizer at ippudo in NYC and I could not stop eating them. At sushisamba, I only had one piece. The miso soup tasted like soy sauce mixed with water. The cilantro floating on top of the soup was half yellow. How could serve it the way they did? The tofu in the miso soup is not the ordinary soft tofu. It's a fusion restaurant so maybe they did that on purpose? The only appetizer that's good is the rock shrimp tempura. It was crispy and the hint of spiciness adds a kick to it.  Tuna tataki was good but also very salty. The spicy mayo that is used on the unagi tamago was overpowering. It felt like I put a spoon-full of spicy mayo  in my mouth. lastly, the celebration roll... Great presentation but again... Very salty as well. I am not sure what they do but they seem to sprinkle sea salt on EVERYTHING. I really believe that my blood pressure went up after eating there.

The main reason for taking away two stars is that it was SO hot in there, and somehow really humid, even in the back of the place. For a place that looks so sexy, they should know that there's nothing sexy about eating sushi while you're sweating. I asked the waitress for a cocktail recommendation, and she told me she liked the Nina Fresa, which has Svedka Vodka, muddled strawberries, orange liqueur, and guava. Yum, right? It sounded great but I thought it would be too sweet, so I ordered the Chu-Cumber, which is made with shochu, St. Germain, muddled cucumber, and lime. Well she ended up bringing me the one she recommended but I didn't want, but I was too desperate for a cocktail that I drank it anyway.  Kind of a bad way to start dinner! As far as the sushi goes, it was good! I recommend ordering whatever looks good off of the ""Samba rolls"" menu... pretty creative stuff! Here's a quick rundown of what we decided on: -Pacific roll: king crab, avocado, asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema, $16.00 -El Topo roll: salmon, jalapeño, shiso leaf, fresh melted mozzerella, crispy onion, $14.00 (this one was absolutely incredible) -Samba rio Roll: Maine lobster tempura, romaine, avocado, cucumber, tartar sauce, $17.50 The food was very, very good, but again it was just a little hard to enjoy it considering the temperature of the place (and having the wrong cocktail... boo.)

It has a trendy vibe with loungy music and mostly attractive servers. The Caipirinhas they had were good as were the nina fresas, a pink drink made of vodka and strawberries. I proudly downed 2 of them with a mostly male group of colleagues and yes embarrassing photos were taken, but sometimes being the adventurous taster has it's price :) We also tried the Fica Frio, Cachaca and muddled watermelon, which I thought was gross and undrinkable. Moving on to food, we opted for the tasting, $50 per person and the chef brings you sampling from different parts of the menu, sorta like tapas style. We started with Shishito peppers which reminded me a great deal of the Spanish Pimientos de Padron, apparently they are not the same thing but they taste extremely similar and also have the occasional spicy one in the batch. The Chicharron de Calamar was also very good, squid fried with corn flour batter. The sea bass skewers were melt in your mouth texture wise, but way too sweet for my taste. The sushi offerings were distinct, with beef, pear and other interesting ingredients and were very tasty. One member of our group said Sushi Samba NYC is far superior in terms of food quality, is he right? I have no idea. However, I would like to say the owner of the restaurant was very accommodating to our special opentable request for gluten free options. He personally walked over, and walked through the menu in detail highlighting the gluten free offerings, even down to what sauces could and could not be consumed. We greatly appreciated that. Overall I enjoyed my experience and they do have some interesting creative dished, but felt like I paid too much for what I ate, so I probably would not frequent this place on a regular basis.

My three kids have three different sets of allergies, and my oldest wanted to go for a night out to dinner for her birthday. The restaurant told us that the sushi bar was completely peanut and tree nut free, and identified items on the menu that were safe for her to eat. They remade our ceviche without shrimp without prompting to accommodate our son's allergy. And, since we had told them in advance that our nut allergic daughter was celebrating a birthday, they had specially prepared a fantastic dessert for her and made her feel like a special birthday girl, not one who had to be left out. No one made us feel like any of this was a burden.  And their kids menu, while relatively expensive ($12), is a healthy surprise.

We were a party of four that came in around 11pm with no reservation, but we called ahead and were told it wouldn't be a problem and they're open til 1, so I was not sure what the 'tude was all about. That said, the place looks awesome, ""hip"" is definitely the word they buzzword. They play the kinda music you can really dance to, though when we came in a Brazilian classic was playing, so there's a range but it mostly keeps with the hip vibe.  Service at the table: It took awhile for us to get service or even water, which I didn't get because it didn't look like they were that busy. However, once our server came he was quite charming. Even the bussers were very conversational and cool with us. We made friends with one that recommended a few dance places nearby, and we had a blast when we went there.  The Food:  Contrary to other reviews, I actually really enjoyed it! I think we lucked out on our choices because we went completely off the server's recommendations. We started with two traditional rolls and two fusion style ones. The entire table seemed to agree that the fusion ones were the best (like their take on the spicy tuna, I think?). Traditional ones are fine, but they didn't stand out as super exceptional sushi. I like the fusion ones because it's a unique take with great flavors. Make sure you ask for some eel sauce... It's a bit sweeter than soy and tastes fantastic with what we got. We also got the Churrasco Rio Grande, which comes with five types of meat, and we got the steak medium rare because really that's when it tastes best. ;)  There was a delicious smokey spicyness to the chorizo which I liked, but I don't generally eat much spicy food, so if you're used to spicy you might want more heat.  Between the four of us who were pretty hungry it was a good quantity, but to be fair two of the girls I was with eat like birds. I probably could've gone for more sushi.  Drinks: A friend had a vodka tonic, not the best ratios though, bartender. It tasted better when he got a second one with a double shot. If you'd like a traditional Brazilian drink you should try the caipirinha, it's made with cachaca which is a liquor made from sugarcane juice. Yum! Overall thoughts: Sushisamba is a bit schizophrenic -- if you want a traditional Japanese or Brazilian experience I can't say it feels particularly authentic in either direction. If you need Brazilian try a churrasco/steakhouse like Brazzaz. If you want good sushi try Katsu.  Still I'd give it four stars because when we finally had our server he was super helpful and nice, the decor is great, and of course the fusion idea is totally something new and delicious.

2012-07-06,2.0,"Summary:  Fun decoration.  Subpar service.  Drinks are good for the most part, but cocktail menu not foolproof.  Food incredibly overpriced, and far from memorable.  Do not eat here.  Cannot comment on late-night vibe.  Went to Sushi Samba early on a Thursday for dinner (not my choice.)  Thus, I can't comment on the atmosphere of the lounge, etc.  There were only maybe 10-12 other tables while we were there.   Positives:  Certainly decorated with conviction.  That may sound more backhanded than it's intended to - I actually think the decoration is creative and fun.   Some of the light fixtures kind of remind me of the Cheesecake Factory, but overall I appreciate that they're going all-out in the direction of dreamland Scarface decor.   Drinks are good.  Had a taste of a mango caipirihna and a strawberry mojito that were tasty.  Someone in our group really liked some kind of fruit punch with prosecco.  The caliente, which I ordered, was not very good - the aji panca syrup totally overwhelms the other flavors in the drink.  Mango, passion fruit, cachaca and aji panca might be a really interesting flavor combination, but as mine was mixed I got a vague aroma of mango followed by a taste of straight chipotle.   Negatives:  We had a table of 8, and our server seemed to instantly decide that, as gratuity would be included, he didn't have to work all that hard to keep us happy.  Waited a long, long time between each stop at the table - after taking orders, after being asked for the bill, after giving him credit cards for the bill.  And again, it's not like he was swamped while we were there. Honestly, I'm not one to get too worked up about service unless it's egregiously bad.  If the food had been good, I probably would have forgotten all about the service.  The food is not very good.  It's somewhere between adequate and good.  But the prices would make you think you're getting something remarkable.  A few of us shared the otsumami appetizer.  This was pretty good - in fact, the shishito peppers were one of the better things I ate.  We had to ask the busboy to bring the sauce that was supposed to come with the dish, but it was fairly tasty.  Hard to screw up throwing green beans and peppers in the fryer, but hey, credit where it's due.  On the server's recommendation, got the yellowtail tiradito and the celebration roll.  Tiradito was good - fish was excellent, and the sauce did not overwhelm it.  It's $13 for four pieces of sashimi, but it was good.  Also ordered the celebration roll - utterly underwhelming.  They make a spicy crab roll - nothing special - and throw some admittedly very fresh sashimi on top in a relatively attractive way.  $17 for make that is essentially indistinguishable from a spicy crab roll anywhere else with five pieces of sashimi.   To actually order a full meal with a couple of drinks, you're spending easily $65 a head.  There are many, many better options for the money.",0.9987,0.735,0.219,0.046,0.5813375777661492
2012-07-06,3.0,"I come to Sushisamba for the sauce, not for the food.  What sauce makes Sushisamba food so tasty? I am already obsessed with its truffle aioli sauce. It goes well with everything, ranging from vegetable tempura to sushi.  While I enjoy the sauce, I agree with other Yelpers that the food in Sushisamba is average. I am always disappointed that it never has shishitto peppers whenever I order it. In this case, I would recommend taking the peppers out of the menu.  My friend and I enjoyed good service on her birthday - The waiter gave her a free birthday dessert, which I considered very thoughtful, and decided to come back for my own birthday.  However, I was quite disappointed for both the food and the service, when my friends and I came back. We only got our food after an hour that we ordered. Moreoever, my asparagus was not fully cooked. The waiter also gave me tamago sushi instead of tamago sashimi.  Although I like the decor of Sushisamba, I am not sure if I will visit it again.  P.S. Sushisamba serves great brunch.

2012-06-17,3.0,"My cousin invited DL & me to this trendy Brazilian-Japanese restaurant--my very 1st of epicurean Windy City delights.  My eyes became anime-esque just being in this vast & unsurprisingly garish evening atmosphere, emblazoned with eclectic & panoramic colorful festivity.  Noticing an interesting hint of a deceptively transparent unisex restroom, my cousin was quite shocked that a dancing floor didn't exist.  Add that to some club-ish music we coerced to endure & to raise our conversational voices up to both one another & our overly knowledgeable & garrulous waitress. That said, our start was our mini skewered Miso Sea Bass ($14) & Churrasco Rio Grande con Tres Carnes ($39), which were ribeye, pork tenderloin & grilled hangar steak served with the black beans, sautéed salad greens & white rice.  To some delight the flavor of this fish was pretty impressive though barely zingy, & so were the tasty Brazilian ribeye (the middle meat of the Churrasco pic), black beans, dark greens, and the diced tomato & green sauces made for the proteins.  Rooms of improvement to personally justify the not-so-surprisingly number of $ signs are to make the rest of the meats juicier & more sensually tasty.  Yep: that's the most exciting description I can come up with =/. Next down the dinner ""line"" was our Celebration Roll ($17), Robo Duck ($14), and SUSHISAMBA's Traditional ($48), aka their Omakase of a variety of sushi, mini rolls, tempura, & Yellowtail Collar.  Again, the overall excitement I can think of was the vivid colors & thoughtful presentations of the fish, but I must add that the easy-to-fish-out Yellowtail Collar was one paragon of fish meant for virgins goin' spunky with surf food. (""Man, this is hard to describe their flavor,"" I thought to myself.) BUT THERE'S GREAT NEWS: the Sweet Shrimp Head was delish, & that smoky & tender sliced & seared Robo Duck breast, albeit pricey once again, is what this 5 Ft Foodie HIGHLY recommends, if you still want to Samba down. The dessert named Fondue ($7), however, led to a weirdly anti-climatic act.  As lovely as our waitress--& my cousin--presenting out a plate with 3 cupcakes (from a different place where my couz got 'em) with a mini candle, immediately after being placed in our table, we were mind-boggled,  yelp.com/biz_photos/yaWE… .  According to the menu we're supposed to get [satisfying] coconut marshmallow, [unremarkable] passion fruit cake, Brigadeiro, fruta fresca, & [sugar-sickening] green tea ice cream.  I guess Brigadeiro (aka chocolate truffle) was a no show of the night that we instead got some sad pieces of unworthily mediocre brownies.  Plus, was this so-called fondue supposed to come with a sauce cup-size of chocolate soup, rather than at least a bowl sized perfectly for typical miso soup?  What ever the case, except for the cupcakes & coconut marshmallows, we didn't like the end of this glamorous ""show."" Still interested?  If you don't mind giving 13% more than personal value, I think you'll do more than A-OK with Robo Duck/Seared Duck Breast, Sweet Shrimp Head--if there's a separate one in the menu--& this fruity & sleek cocktail I've drank called Mora Negra ($10).  We're glad that my Chicagoan cousin took some good time to dine lavishly with us, yet since there's a disarray of hits & misses, though left feelin' alright, SUSHISAMBA earns fine 3 stars.

Right before I left Tokyo, a friend of our treated us to dinner at a well known sushi bar. We waited outside in a line for at least an hour and half to get into the restaurant and if I remember we had a reservation. The sushi was amazing and large pieces of toro negiri were twice the size of the rice ball below. It melted in my mouth. I have waited 13 years to find a restaurant that even came close to the caliber, that was until I had the opportunity to dine at Sushi Samba.  The restaurant's decor is gorgeous, candy for the eye really. I am a big fan of fusion restaurants . I really enjoyed the plates that delightfully combined the flavors of Japanese and Brazilian.  I had the opportunity to try a couple kinga kogen beers.Fruity beer with rich taste made by packaging ""Weizen"", the traditional beer in the South Germany made of over 50 % of wheat malt, without filtering beer yeast.  The beer was presented in cool blue bottle that fit in perfectly with the restaurant's modern decor. My brother had been raving about the Sea Bass. He was spot on as it was served on skewers, perfectly cooked in a sweet miso base. It was the sushi platter that I can not stop talking about.  Absolutely gorgeous and fresh, beautifully presented. I was able to steal one of the pieces of tuna negiri.My brother is still upset with me for not splitting it with him. I was able to thank the sushi chef in person, and was embarrassed at how little Japanese that I could remember.

Instead of embracing Wicker Park or Lincoln Park or anywhere else he insisted that we spend all our time downtown..which unless you are a. working, b. shopping or c. have a specific reason to head in it just doesn't make sense to do that in the middle of winter..especially when you are 2 southerners who don't understand how to dress warm to save your lives.  So against my will we just spent the entire day just strolling around in sub-freezing temperatures. Then he said he wanted to go to SushiSamba (at 5pm) so since we spent the whole time arguing I decided to keep my mouth shut and not bitch that I WOULD LIKE TO LOOK CUTE IF IM GOING TO A RESTAURANT THAT ISN'T PITA PIT!  UGGGHHH! I was wearing a stupid long sleeve t-shirt, uggs (the fake kind too..kill me), a hideous puff coat, and my hair was suffering from both static and the oily effects of spending a day outside in the city. So we walk into this chic, stylish, beautiful restaurant and I immediately want to cry. I'm a girl. I love to get dressed up. And this idiot (no offense, i didn't mean it) is totally clueless!

The taquitos are tasty as well..small..but tasty. Now my favorite part:  The organic chicken smoked teriyaki skewers under ""anticuchos"". The come with ""peruvian corn"" which is literally huge pieces of corn kernals that are the size of my baby toe.  I could eat the chicken and corn all day long. They are well sauced, tangy, and cooked to perfection. They were so good I ordered more! We ordered sushi as well, it was sort of a sampler with 4 different kinds.

We ordered the Bobo Brazil beef sushi roll - yum!  I was pleasantly surprised at how many roll pieces we got and how tasty they were.  We also got edamame - tastes equivalent to all other edamame I've had.  We also got seared Wayu beef - pretty good. All in all, my expectations were WAY higher than what I got.  I've eaten at several other sushi places around the city and found that they were equivalent to SushiSamba - and a little bit cheaper.  I don't think I'd go back, but it was definitely somewhere I've wanted to go bc it looks so trendy!  The waiter seemed a little bit annoyed that we didn't order drinks and only ordered 3 items - but it was plenty for us!  He really should have just appreciated that he actually had a table to wait on!",0.9471,0.864,0.12,0.016,0.5357142857142857

We made reservations for four - it was short notice for a Saturday night, although the restaurant was only half-full at 7:30 - we were taken to a table squished on the side, only about 6 inches from the next table, and tucked into a glass corner. Not a very desirable spot for it being so empty. We waited a good 5 - 10 minutes for our server, but no one came so we had to go find service ourselves. We asked to change tables, and they accommodated with a better table with more space. The food was good, the prices weren't that great for what you actually got I felt however. You are paying for the atmosphere. It's a kind of place you want to be seen more than have a good meal. It's kind of a loud restaurant, early 20's crowd. A first date kinda place. The good: friendly staff, fast valet, free coat check, and pretty good food. The design of the place was pretty good. The bad: it's loud, the fire alarm went off twice, and the prices don't much match the food. the bathrooms are so dark, I wasn't sure if I was actually hitting the toilet. Apologizes to the guy after me. I also don't really like bathroom attendants. Also should be mentioned that the faucets were actually spigots. That was odd.

2012-01-01,1.0,"I made NYE reservations for my boyfriend and I several weeks ago . I was expecting (or maybe hoping for) an establishment similar to Carnivale in terms of atmosphere and food/drink quality. However, we were quite disappointed by the end of the evening.  The food was lame. We did only order two sushi rolls as we were not that hungry. My boyfriend ordered the Pacific (from the menu: $16- king crab, avocado, asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema), which was 5 pieces of sushi. This was much less exciting than the $5 California rolls I pick up from the local grocery store. First, there were no asian pears present, at least it wasn't noticeable (so then what is the point). As far as the avocado is concerned, it was essentially a smear of guacamole, also barely noticeable. There was a tiny bit of ""crab"" meat (probably the imitation stuff). The remaining 98% of the roll was rice.  I ordered some roll with eel and maybe crab. It was ok but not worth $16 (or maybe $17) even considering we are in the city. I have had mediocre sushi at other establishments where I have said, ""This is expensive and probably not worth it but we are at a nice restaurant in the city so this is justifiable."" But in no way were the prices justifiable, especially the Pacific, which I would not even pay $5 for. My boyfriend ordered some raspberry martini and I ordered two of the bubble tails. These drinks were ok, but again nothing worth getting again. Most of the drinks on the menu looked super sweet and syrupy so I avoided them. The atmosphere was nothing exceptional.  It had a modern yet outdated feel to it, if that makes any sense. It's neither romantic nor trendy. At one point in time, it may have been a swanky establishment but now it has lost its freshness and trendiness. It didn't help that the red plastic coating on our chairs was wearing off revealing the black foam below. Not very classy.  In terms of their NYE celebration, they had advertised samba dancers, drummers and a dj. They led me to believe they would be performing all night. But the samba dancers appeared twice, the first time they danced around for about five minutes and the second time they came out for about 10 or 15 minutes. I did not see the drummers until the end of the evening and I am not even sure there was a dj. The music sounded like it was coming from a recording.  The service was not bad. Our waitress was a very nice girl and kept returning to our table to check on us. The biggest issue with the service was forgetting to bring out a spoon with our ice cream dessert and waiting five minutes to get a spoon as the ice cream melted. This is at least forgivable considering it was a busy night.  In sum, Sushi Samba will drain your wallet and leave you dissatisfied. It is not worth your time or money, especially when there are so many other wonderful dining options in the city.",0.9379,0.847,0.084,0.069,0.48263784146137084

2011-11-07,2.0,"I'll admit it, I'm a cocktail and sushi snob. So I was leery when invited to a friend's going away party here. And it turns out I was right to be skeptical. The service was largely spot on, and the decor gave the loungey vibe I think they were going for, but the food and drinks were the stumbling block. First - the cocktails. So far as I could tell they were uniformly sweet and lacked much finesse. I don't think this was the fault of the bartenders - more the recipes themselves. Granted, I'd imagine much of the clientele consists of twenty-something ladies looking for a party and some nice (or not so nice) boys, but when your drinks tend to taste like Pixie Stix are involved in some way, it's perhaps time to reevaluate the menu. Sake selection was decent, but not particularly impressive in depth or quality, and prices were on the high side, albeit not out of line for the area. When it came time to order up some vittles, we ordered a chicken thigh appetizer off the happy hour menu and a few sushi rolls - steering clear of the larger entrees. After all, standing at the bar attempting to eat Wagyu seems counterproductive. The Japan rolls showed up and the salmon skin was mushy - not tasty and crispy. Our other two rolls, the Neo Tokyo and another roll I can't remember were similarly problematic. While I appreciated the Akira reference (and thanks to all the powers that be that Keanu didn't get that part), I was less appreciative of the rice being mushy and exhibiting a distinct tendency to fall apart at a stern glance. Even forgoing chopsticks and going full on finger-food led to rice explosions. Which is not a euphemism. The fish was good, but not great and the flavors were masked by heavy handed use of sauces and other assorted condiments. And at the prices we're paying - I expect better than that. I can't speak to the Latin American fusion foods on the menu - we didn't try them - but the sushi is a whole lot of ""meh."" Bottom line, get out of downtown and go to Arami, or even Seadog or Coast, if you want to get some tasty sushi. This stuff just wasn't up to snuff.",0.9806,0.822,0.122,0.056,0.5148319327731091

The service was good, and is definitely the main reason why I'm not giving them one star instead of two because the food was one big meh. The fish was ok: nothing special, but not bad. The menu was pretty extensive, but when I perused it, nothing stood out to me that I really wanted to try. We ordered a couple of rolls, both of which came out pretty spicy, and neither of them were described as spicy in the menu. That was upsetting. We also ordered an appetizer of chicken skewers (I don't remember what they were called in the menu), and that was definitely the best thing we ate. The drinks were also ok, but nothing special. It seems to me that this is the type of place people who don't really know that much about good quality sushi go to be seen.",0.9605,0.776,0.149,0.075,0.46158730158730155

It took 10 minutes for our server to take our drink order, despite the fact the restaurant was barely half full.  It then took us 45 minutes to receive our starters and another 40 minutes to receive two sushi rolls.  Our server failed to acknowledge that the food service from the back was slow and instead ignored us.  Several servers bumped into our table and actually spilled our drinks but never even glanced at us.  When our server finally did bring our sushi we were ready to leave having been there for 95 minutes with virtually no attention. We noticed that instead of paying attention to his tables our server was more interested in playing grab ass with the other staff and sitting at the hostess podium scratching his chin-literally. SushiSamba is incredibly expensive with very poor service.  Why go there when there are so many other small, independently owned sushi, latin american and fusion restaurants in the city with much better food and much better service.",-0.7785,0.804,0.084,0.112,0.38853333333333334

It was warm, moist, sweet.. The perfect ending to a fun dinner with the girls. It makes me smile to this day. It's a fun place, I'd come here for a special *fun* occasion.

The bartender was nice and accommodating and the space near the bar is has a great ambiance, as does the rest of the restaurant. I had the miso glazed chilean sea bass that was out of this world. Admittedly the miso sauce is quite strong and I could definitely see people think it is too overbearing on the fish but I personally loved it as it was great with the veggies on the side. Finally I had the coffee homemade ice cream that was amazing, it wasn't too ""coffee-y"" but really smooth and creamy, I could eat it everyday. In terms of the atmosphere it was pretty quiet but it was a Monday night and the hostesses were very sweet in accommodating my friend's birthday with a cute brownie sundae. Only complaint/constructive criticism was that it seemed like our server wasn't really trying and very lax. Typically it wouldn't bother me if I am with a lot of friends, but we wanted to keep ordering rolls/drinks and the check-in was minimal to put in new orders.

The cocktails were well-prepared and innovative (although not cheap) and the sushi was so incredibly fresh and tasty, while the entrees were equally inspired and delicious.

I inquired why we couldn't order a sandwich and the waitress said she'd check.  After coming back, the two sandwiches we wanted were ""unavailable"" Churrasco Burger, and the Chicken Club, despite those ingredients being available on the dinner menu (which led me to believe they were phased out due to their low cost as entree items), and I was allowed to order the Skirt Steak sandwich, which was quite good, even if the mizuna for dipping was in a bowl smaller than the sandwich (so I had mizuna on my steak fries instead).  We also ordered a few rolls, including the Samba Rio roll, which had weird presentation with lobster in two of the roll parts but not the others (but still tasted good), and the Bobo Brazil roll (the Kobe beef was quite good). Due to the miscommunication on menus and sandwich options, the manager apologized and brought us a complimentary Sweet Corn Kakiage. It was quite light and delicious, and the gesture was appreciated.  The service was great after that, although they are a little quick on the draw on taking plates away, not once but three times I had to stop them.  Nevertheless, I would come back here.

We arrived at the restaurant at around 6pm, in which it was almost empty.  The waitress promptly seated us, and we ordered right away.  My friend and I shared two rolls--the rainbow dragon (freshwater eel, red bell pepper, cucumber, mango, avocado, 13.50) and pacific king crab (crab, avocado, asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema, 16.00).  The food came quickly and each roll contained six and five pieces, respectively. There was actually way too little eel on in the dragon to bring out its sweetness.  Meanwhile, the mango (it was too tart) did not mash too well with the eel or pepper.  It was just some weird combination that did not belong perfectly.  It's just like a forced or arranged marriage--while you find affection for that significant other in the end, something just does not feel right.  Something tells you that these ingredients are not soul mates. The Asian pear was sweet and crunchy and was well positioned against the softness of the crab.  I had never really had soy paper before (I always use Nori), so that was a treat as well.  The avocado crema, served on the side was again solid but not amazing.  So good food, but not great.  And overpriced. Oh, one thing to notice, the bathroom was definitely weird.  I will never stop thinking about that--it contrasted so much from the hip interior of the restaurant.  The bathroom was filled with mirrors to the point that I didn't know if something was a door, a wall, or open space.  Even as I write, just thinking about that maze gives me a headache and a shiver.  I felt as if I was lost within a horror movie, unable to find my way out, and surrounded by sinks with handles that look that they belong to a run down basement.",0.7723,0.775,0.121,0.104,0.4360564519655429

I suggested SushiSambaRio before thinking ""oh - they just went to Peru... maybe they don't want to eat Peruvian."" But they actually were pretty excited to try it out. I had eaten here once before for Restaurant Week and had a great experience, so I was excited to try it out again.  The second time around was even better - I can see why this was Heath Ledger's favorite place to eat while in town filming Dark Knight. We came early in the evening, right as the restaurant was opening, and hardly anyone was there. Our waiter was very helpful and offered suggestions on his favorite items.  He also gave a warning when I ordered a spicy drink, saying he had gotten severe heartburn after trying it and saying I should only go for it if I was a huge spicy fan. The food came out staggered pretty well, although we did have some backups that occurred. The first cocktail came out quickly, but then there was a long wait for the second round of cocktails. A big bummer was at the end we said we should see the dessert menu, and then they just brought us the bill instead. I guess they just misunderstood, so we opted to skip dessert (which is one of my least favorite things to do). The Food:  Rib Eye Anticuchos (4 Stars) - Good flavor, loved the corn Duck Croquettes (4 Stars) - Great dipping sauce and tasty, although a bit to crab cakey for me. Chicharron Calamari (cornmeal crusted calamari, tomato, mint, plantain, tamarind) (5 stars) - My favorite calamari in the city that I've found so far. A must get if you are a calamari fan.  Yellowtail Sashimi Seviche (Ginger, Garlic, Soy) (5 stars) I've only had  ceviche a couple times - a couple of decent experiences and one good. The server recommended this dish highly, and it ended up being my favorite dish of the meal.  Even my friend who doesn't enjoy ceviche really liked it. The pieces of yellowtail were big, bold and delicious. Pacific Roll (king crab, avocado, asian pear, soy paper, wasabi-avocado crema) (3.5 stars) This was the item from the menu I was most excited about and it turned out to be my least favorite dish.  It was definitely still good - I like soy paper rolls, and I liked the asian pear a lot, and the avacado and wasabi-avocado crema were nice too. However, the roll was just a little too light for my mood - it was all very neutral flavors.  In comparison to the bold flavors in the rest of the dishes, it was a bit of a downer. Celebration Roll (spicy snow crab maki, premium sashimi, celebration garnish) (5 stars) The server told us this was one of the chef's specialties and that each piece of the roll would have it's own special flavor and magic.  The two pieces of the roll I had were amazing - I want to go back and get this roll just for myself with no sharing required!  Coconut Rice, Purple Potato Mash (5 stars) - The two sides we had were both fantastic. I couldn't pick which I liked more. Cocktails: Samba Juice - I got the Samba Juice when our server scared me out of my original order. It was tasty, but order it only if you REALLY like fruity cocktails. It was definitely fruity, to the max (raspberry and watermelon infused rum, açai, passion fruit, créme de banana, guava) Mojito - Our favorite cocktails of the evening... a very well made mojito. Pisco Punch - My friend had first experienced Pisco Sour's in Peru and fell in love with them. Here, he decided to get the Pisco Punch (basically a Pisco Sour with mango).  He hated it (and the rest of us didn't like it much either.)

In addition to how wonderful the food tasted, our waiter (Chad if any body wants him to serve you next time you go in) was so friendly and attentive that without him the experience would have definitly been less exciting! I just wish more placed hired people like him! And this is a great compliment because I myself am a waitress and I always have great expectations!  The only complaint I might make, and why I gave it four stars, is because the music was a little too loud. I also felt like the atmosphere was already classy enough without the necessity to have modern B96 music playing, if it was european dance I feel like it would have coincided bettter with the style of the place. And aside from the genre of the music the volume also added to the annoyance. We were in a big party so granted we would have to shout to some people regardless, but when I have to turn to the right and shout to talk to my boyfriend is where I begin to wonder.

So basically there were a couple good items on the menu and the drinks were good, but my table ordered a lot of things and only 2 were good.  Everything else was just ok or not very good at all.  More effort needs to be put into the menu and less on things like a see-through bathroom and strange decor.  Just saying.",0.9863,0.767,0.185,0.048,0.5167811355311355

We had a reservation at 8:15, but didn't get seated closer to 8:45.  Wasn't a huge deal as that gave us an opportunity to order some cocktails from the fully-stocked and quite busy bar.  We both ordered a Beijo, which is rum, ginger liquor, elderflower liquor, muddled raspberries, and a sparkling wine float. after getting seated (towards the back, but i would argue that there isn't a bad view in this place... visually stunning throughout), i let my boyfriend take over ordering for us both.  We started with a bowl of edamame.  This was probably the one throw-away dish of our meal.  It was prepared well and was quite tasty, but wasn't unique. Around this time, we also had our second cocktails.  Sluggo had another Beijo, but I moved on to the Chu-cumber (only because the cocktail menu was too expansive NOT to try something new).  The waiter gave me frank advice on some of the cocktails (stay away from the Caliente!, etc...), which I appreciated as I didn't feel like everything was being sold to me.  I wanted an honest opinion and he gave it.  I LOVED the Chu-cumber as it wasn't very sweet, but was incredibly refreshing. We then moved onto lobster taquitos.  Arugably, this might be the best thing I've ever eaten.  Sadly, my biggest regret is that we didn't get more of these.  It was the perfect balance of sweet, savory, spicy, crunchy, and melty.  Absolutely perfect. Next came the sushi.  We ordered three rolls.  One was Kobe beef with chimichurri sauce, one was unagi, and the third was a wedge shaped concoction (that I currently forget what was in it.)  They were all quite delicious, but the Kobe beef definitely stood out for me. We also ordered 2 pieces of sashimi and 2 pieces of nigiri (which aren't on the menu, but they will make for you).  The only misstep of the night occurred here when our nigiri came out as sashimi.  No biggie though. Next came dessert.  I ordered dessert and we had the donuts (vanilla sugar mini donuts with hazelnut sauce to dip them in) and mochi. The donuts were very tasty, as was the mochi, but the mochi felt like it was missing something.  Needless to say, we both ended up dipping our mochi in the leftover hazelnut sauce.  Then we proceeded to fight over who got to finish that with our spoon.  If it had been acceptable, I think one of us might have licked the dish clean. Besides the great food and excellent atmosphere, the service was perfect.  Our server was the perfect combination of attentive/funny/helpful.  We never felt ""overserved"" or bugged by him, but he was definitely there when we needed him.  The busboys also kept our table spotless and clean.  Empty dishes never remained for more than a moment or two.  As a quick reminder, bring some singles for the bathroom attendants.  They TRULY earn their keep as they opened doors for me, turned on and off the faucet and patted my hands dry.

We had dinner reservations for a party of 7 for 7:45.  I and my husband bellied up to the downstairs bar at about 6:30 for some pre dinner cocktails.  Bartenders Zack and Ashley were awesome...very attentive and personable...and made delicious drinks.  We were starving so we also ordered a couple of appetizers...attempted to.  We tried ordering, I believe, 3 different appetizers before being told that they actually had something in house.  Kind of odd that a restaurant would already be out of some food choices prior to dinner rush, but okay.  We got the lobster taquitos and a crab pastel thingy...both were super good...the taquitos being my favorite!!! Our dinner party arrived and we were promptly seated.  However, we were seated very oddly.  They had pushed together 3 tables to accomodate us, however, 2 tables would have been sufficient.  By having us sit at 3 tables, our group was too spread out and the party was separated from one another....hence, I finished my meal and had not spoken a word to 3 people from our group.  Just very odd.   None of us really know how this happened, but we ordered many appetizers and rolls for dinner instead of any entrees.  This is not normally how we do things so it was a fun change for us.  The food was amazingly tasty.  I don't recall everything we got, but I do recall Kani, Unagi pieces, Unagi rolls, salmon rolls, Chilean Sea Bass skewers, Tuna rolls, Lobster Taquitos, some type of steak/pork sandwich, and many others.  There was not one thing that I did not like.  Again...taquitos were my favorite!!! Aside from the odd seating arrangement and being out of several appetizers, our experience here was great.  We have eaten here before, but it has been a very long time.  I am sure we will be coming back again very soon based on this past experience. Oh...many have commented on the decor...I think it is fine.  It sort of reminds me of a Vegas hotel restaurant.  Cutesy...nothing amazing, but not outdated.  However, the ""ice cube"" shelves in the bar area remind me of the Ice Bar in Amsterdam...not a good thing...slightly cheestastic.

My friend made a 9:30 reservation, when we arrived we checked in and were told it would be a few minutes. Well a few minutes turned into a 45 minutes and if we didn't keep checking in with the hostess it probably would have been longer. Why even make a reservation? So off to the bar we started, where cocktails ran about $12. I don't mind paying for a good martini but could barely taste any alcohol. I had the Hakata (grapefruit vodka, yuzu juice & grendadine).  After finally being seated we were brought to our table. Definitely very chic ambiance and Jersey shore beats. Our waiter came over and welcomed us and explained the menu, it was just so loud inside that he was practically yelling.  I decided on a Rainbow Dragon (eel, mango, avo, red pepper, cukes) and a Salmon/Avocado roll. The seviche/tiradito options looked interesting - different fish with various marinades? Would have been cool if he explained this a little more so we had an idea. Or how about some pictures people, no? is that considered not cool or whatever?  Anyway, the rolls came out pretty quickly but I noticed the signature samba rolls had so much packed into it that it took a lot away from the overall flavor. I ended up liking the plain salmon/avocado roll better. My friends ordered different apps, a lobster style taco and gyoza styled dumplings. They both seemed happy with the apps but disappointed in the portion vs price. Also, why weren't we offered the Restaurant Week menu? Not cool.... All in all, the food wasn't bad.

First we enter, some dweebs were talking about how New York has better sushi and this is a chain and Chicagoans think it's the best thing ever.  FALSE. And why were they there?  A friendly girl offered to take our coats and the hostess sat us.  No problems there. Our waiter was extremely friendly. He actually doesn't look like a sushi waiter to me. He was extremely normal looking, down to earth guy.  He laughed really hard with us and was just an A+ server who just brought us things when we couldn't decide, like on saki.  It was excellent. I wish every server was like him. Okay now onto the sushi.  First it is a FUSION. So it's not typical sushi.  So don't order the typical sushi rolls.  We had the most amazing unpronounceable sushi roll. It had jalapeno in it with tuna.  Then we had a roll with cilantro and jalapeno shaped like a triangle.  My cousin loved it, and so did our friend from out of country.  The nigiri, unfortunately, was the skimpiest fish I ever saw. There is the minus 1 star.  It looked like they sliced it like thick salami.  (a slight exaggeration).   But I honestly never had bad sushi here and the desserts are good.

The salmon avocado roll was good.  The fish was fresh and had no fishy smell to it.  But the Hamachi wasn't fresh at all, I could taste the fishiness even when it was masked in all that cilantro and spicy sauce. When the Filet Mignon came out, it was so dry and overcooked I had to ask for another dish.  The sauce that was on the meat was not a good compliment with the meat.  The sea bass was pretty good.  The tuna roll that came with the bento box was also fishy.  I've been to lots of sushi restaurants both cheap & expensive and if you are going to charge these prices for sushi at least give a better quality of fish to your customers.   I'm not going to come back here unless it's for some social function for drinks.  I'd rather go to Sunda down the street.",0.979,0.838,0.137,0.025,0.5210648148148148

I had the monthly Sambatini, which happened to be cucumber infused and absolutely delicious. It wasn't too sweet, which most specialty martinis tend to be.  The sushi was simply the freshest I've ever had. I'll also give the sushi chef kudos for inventiveness. The Chicharron Calamari was delicious and had a delicate balance of flavors.

2010-12-07,3.0,"I guess there might be an issue when I only like the cooked beef items over any of the sashimi or sushi rolls.... I came here with eight other people the other week for a friend's birthday party. Walking in a wee early, a friend and I sat at the bar and ordered some wine and chatted till the rest of the group came by. Bartenders were friendly as was the rest of the staff, not to obtrusive or overbearing which is always a good sign.  When we finally sat down, our server seemed a little bit in the weeds, but certainly did his best to keep up with the multitude of the orders from all of us. The staff was quick to help out when three others showed up towards the end of our meal and even gave the birthday girl a delicious dessert. Well it seemed delicious, since she finished it off in a blink of an eye.  But....  I wasn't a fan of the sushi at all. I split about five dishes with a friend, the short rib bao, really pretty decent, but the sauce they served it with was a bit too sweet and not a lot of depth to the flavor, the short ribs were good and tender and the steamed bun was okay. The Kobe beef gyozas were really good, great flavor, (on their own and with the dipping sauce), and good portion size. The sashimi ""seviche"" was okay, the tuna seemed pretty salty, even for a salt lover like me and too brash and overpowering with soy and spice which made me loose any flavor of the fish. The salmon was pretty good, I enjoyed the sliced oranges in the dish and the citrus was a little strong but it's their twist on ceviche, but not bad. The rolls were okay. I felt like the fish seemed a bit off, perhaps with all the mix and matching we did it didn't pair up that well. I just have had better sushi at other places.  The scene... well is a scene. Trendy, in style and in food, but something is off. It's loud, a bit in your face, a little over the top but when you pair it all together it makes you feel like you are wearing Ed Hardy all over from head to toe, it all matches, but it looks like you are trying way to hard to impress. Not my style at all.  Prices are pricey, but it's downtown sushi, I wouldn't expect it any other way. If I had to go back I would go for the Kobe beef items or some of their more cooked items.

2010-11-20,3.0,"SushiSamba feels like the luxury dining hall of an intergalactic space-cruiser in a red-and-orange future.   Austin Powers would love this place. Swirls of cushioned booths loop organically through the expansive space, surrounding a circular sushi-bar at the center.  The carpets, fabrics, and walls are all in the fire spectrum, and are accented with stainless steel fixtures and stalks of bamboo.   Metallic beaded curtains dangle from the vaulted ceiling, delineating sub-sections of seating, some of which are inset for a more private feel.  Massive hanging light fixtures add to the larger-than-life ambiance, but are not consistent with the plushness of the rest of the decor.   I went for a special event, so we had the run of the whole restaurant.  It is a fabulous venue for a large party - if your organization chooses it for a mix-and-mingle, I suggest you attend.  The layout is conducive to movement, and the location of the bars (one in front, one in back) prevents the traffic jams that can be characteristic of such events.  There is more than enough seating and its easy to survey the entire space from wherever one might stand.   The food that came around was good, but couldn't compare to the richness of the atmosphere, which is only to be expected.   SushiSamba offers a dramatic, visually-stimulating escape from the cement-grey of the city.  I recommend it for a happy-hour drink and highly recommend it for a special event.

In general the food is good, though we all thought the appetizers were better than the main courses. Is it worth the considerable cost? I'm not sure. I was shocked by how bad the service was.  First, I ordered a bottle of wine, the server came back and said they were out of the bottle I requested (a theme at this place) and she offered me another bottle in its place. I only found out later that the bottle she substituted cost $30 more. A restaurant of this caliber should NEVER UPSELL you like that. Ridiculous. Then they were out of almost everything we ordered for main courses including filets, ribeyes, seabass, calamari, etc... So that was a bit disappointing, which I voiced to my server. To which she responded that she would get us some free desserts to compensate. So when it came to dessert time, we ordered and only found out when the bill came that they weren't in fact free. Couldn't really show my displeasure on the bill because gratuity was included. Really disappointed in this place.

While I am still unsure why The Mgr Adam behaved in the manner he did and emailed me an ""apology"" message that really takes no accountability I have to say; there is some good that finally came out of this unfortunate experience. I was given a party as an apology from Sushi Samba. The Director of Operations who was beyond gracious to me, did EVERYTHING possible to give me something back for what was taken away. I believe in second chances and that there is good in people and I accepted the offer to invite some friends and have a nice evening on the restaurant. I invited a small group, you can't recapture the night of the actual birthday nor did I want too. I think some friends were not really into the idea of another party at sushi samba after what took place but a few close friends came to celebrate with me. I have always liked Sushi Samba and I will tell you GOOD people are on their staff. Up in the Sugar Cane Room-I was greeted by Hayes, the dir of operations who was in from NY & Natalie who handles events. They were there to make sure I was situated where I would be happiest. Our primary server was Chad, who really was amazing on all levels. He was ""the best"" and so much FUN he even went so far to escort one of my guest to a nearby atm machine! Brenda also watched over our group with great enthusiasm and attention and another server Theresa. ALL VERY FRIENDLY and ATTENTIVE. Frankie, my favorite bartender came out of his way to extend his kindness, gave me a hug and made sure I felt completely welcomed which I have to say meant a lot to me because he was there the actual night of my birthday.

We were given a beautiful cocktail soiree which included food and Hayes and Chad brought me 3 BDAY CAKES!!!  I never expected the cakes, that Hayes personally picked out from Mandy B's and they were ABSOLUTELY LOVELY. You can get mad and hate an establishment and tell all your friends to never patronize that place....but I am not going to be one of those people in this particular instance.

It is a fusion restaurant, and I have a problem with anyone calling it anything other than that. This said, it's probably one of the better fusion restaurants and, that's saying a lot because I HATE ""fusion"". Especially since truly original food never needs a label. Anyways--it's a fusion most likely because of the large amounts of Japanese immigrants that started arriving in Brazil (and Peru!) during the 1800's and onwards for a myriad of reasons--some of the same reasons are why those immigrants are in the U.S. (and why some aren't due to US immigration quotas). SO it's good when it's not crowded, because they are super quick. We had a pre-theater dinner here, and it just started getting crowded as we ordered dessert, so I could see how this place could become overrated very quickly. I couldn't help but think they may have been ushering us out before the later dinner rush. However, that was nothing unusual compared to the NYC hustle I am used to.  HOWEVER the fusion between brazilian and japanese was certainly interesting. The celebration roll was a favorite, and very fresh. The churrasco sampler of 5 meats was a little pricey, but nonetheless tasty (mm collard greens and orangey-beans...) final verdict! perfectly acceptable, fresh food if you get there around 5:30pm.

The atmosphere was very big city and on this night when a lot of stuff was going on in the city, they had run out of a few food things, so I'm guessing business is good.",0.9575,0.839,0.141,0.02,0.48872460872460866

After 10 min, my friend came and we were seated.  The food was not that special. I will give them some credit though because it was my first time there and the combination of Japanese and South America cuisines menu it was a kind of weird to me.

The whole point of choclo is that it is NOT sweet, it has a delicious meaty taste, very different from the North American corn, don't try to dress it as such! Our server quickly brought a new batch of sugarless choclo and aij panca upon my request. The pisco sour was among the worst I have ever had, and it was exchanged by a caipirinha promptly.

This isn't the first time I've been to a Sushisamba but I couldn't stop my childhood friend from insisting in dining here and not some normal sushi place like Kamehachi or Sushi Para. Nope.  Nope nope nope. (Slap forehead here.) The evening started off well enough. I arrived a little earlier than the rest of my party and gave my name to the nice host up at the desk. He takes it down, gives me some time to find the rest of my party and I come back 10 minutes later with one of my girls and is now greeted by a different woman. A woman with a completely different demeanor who radiates indifference and reacts to us as if it's still opening week and can't keep that sneer off her face. (And again I'm regretting opening my mouth and suggesting this place.) She can't find my reservation but she can find my girlfriend's and we're sat by the sushi bar and within steps of the bathroom. Our server is a friendly girl with a Beckham jersey and black flats that cause her to slide around the floor but her knowledge of the menu and initial abundance of attention is enough to calm down my girlfriend who wanted to leave after enduring the host from hell's brusque greeting. We all order drinks and cocktails and after receiving our drinks, we start to feel how stretched our server is. She can recite specials and recommendations but is MIA for over 10 minutes. The bussers are on top of getting our refills for water and when she comes back, we quickly place our order with her and order an edamame for fear that we'll drink our weight in liquid before getting our sushi. I order the chef's special and I wish I could say it was worth the $45 for a couple pieces of nigiri sushi, an overglorified California roll and a piece of rare beef. When I got to the tuna roll, I got an unexpected surprise caught between my teeth. At first I thought it was a piece of sprout so I just kept chewing on it thinking it would eventually just break apart but after a few more chews, the sad reality set in and I pulled out a short thin black hair. At first glance I would have said it was my hair since I also have black hair but it clearly was stuck to the second roll as well. I pushed away my plate and didn't eat another bite for the rest of the meal.  When I told my server about it, she just offered a sad little ""sorry"" and moved onto dessert.

2010-07-05,3.0,"This place is confusing!! I'm trying to figure out the concept and I think they are trying to figure that out as well.  According to our waitress, Sushisamba is a fusion restaurant but not really because everything comes out of a different kitchen?? WHAAA? I was excited to try the place out based on others opinions and then I was slightly disappointed.  It was like seeing Napolean Dynamite after everyone had already been quoting all the lines.. it's just wasn't all that great and I wish I could of turned it off in the middle.   If all the different items are coming out of different kitchens, I was under the impression that the Japanese would taste like Japanese and the Brazilian would taste like Brazilian, but that wasn't the case at all. The sushi rolls were weird and really didn't taste that good.  The flavors didn't seems to really work together and just weren't that great.  I saw the attempt of the fusion, but it didn't work for me. Along with the food not being up to par, the service wasn't either.  The girl was very nice, but she had to be new.  She wasn't very attentive and didn't know the answer to any questions.  I liked the atmosphere, it was pretty, swanky, and semi-romantic (except for the loud party we sat next to). Overall, I just don't get this place.  I think it's overrated and not worth the pretty penny you'll spend trying it out.

2010-07-05,5.0,"First off, I was kind of avoiding this place. For as long as it opened, the hubs and I vowed we wouldn't go to Sushi Samba to eat overpriced sushi in a nightclub.  Then, our friend kept telling us about the sushi chef, how certain things on the menu were worth it, and how if we went on the early end it wouldn't bug us as much.  Fiiiiinnnnnneeeee, we went. Now, this is where you HAVE to listen to me.  If you want to have a great experience there...then take this one piece of advice.  Sit in David C.'s section.  He is by far one of the best servers I've ever had.  Similar to my other list of best servers (see Purple Pig and Soul Fire in Boston) he has a crazy amount of knowledge about the menu, was able to describe the taste and texture of the food perfectly, and made EXCELLENT suggestions.  Basically, we went with everything he suggested.  As he described some of the items on the menu, we kind of gave him yays or nays and he went from there.... We started with the kobe taquitos.  I am kind of not super impressed when restaurants use kobe beef...but this was delicious.  Next, we had the hamachi kaba robata. Whoa. This was SO good. The fish was rich, delicious, and almost tasted like meat. Yum.  Then, we had a spicy tuna roll (made with chili oil per my request) and then the special of the day.  I don't even know what the name of the special was, but it was my favorite roll there.  It was filled with crab, then there was a seared piece of fish on top..I could maybe have it right now, it was that good. Next, we had the plate (not sure what the name of it was) that had the celebration roll, medium fatty tuna roll, some sashimi and nigiri pieces, and the kobe beef and mushroom ceviche.  I liked everything but the ceviche. For dessert, we had the warm chocolate banana cake. After all the food we had, it was perfect to share...though I could easily eat one by myself.   Seriously, all of David's suggestions were spot on.  He really listened to what we liked, didn't like, and made an entire menu for us that we were happy with.   As the hubs and I were discussing our meal here, we came to the realization that had we not had David C. as our server, we would've gone astray and made terrible menu choices. Had we been left to our own devices, we probably would've walked away like a lot of other reviewers...a little disappointed with the food and sad that we spent all the money.  However,  all of David's suggestions were so great that we left happy, full, and excited about the meal.",0.9962,0.792,0.165,0.042,0.6322612085769981

The delicious cocktails at the bar were followed by a sit-down dinner in the beautiful dining room.  We began with the kobe gyoza -- oh, little pieces of heaven!  Being Korean, I hardly ever get impressed by dumplings outside of street markets in Seoul.  But after the 5th and the last piece of this goodness was swallowed, I found myself wanting more.  The robatas were excellent.  Grilled with some fancy, smokeless wood, the seabass with miso glaze was fantastic.  The meat literally melted in my mouth with just enough flavors from the miso.  (Didn't get to try the skirt steak on the robata menu -- next time!)  The maki rolls were pretty good - not outstanding.

Those of you that haven't been in awhile will want to check it out. Loyal Samba-ites sticking to your fave menu items may want to break from the ritual and try something new on your next visit. I have been to Sushi Samba Rio many times in the past and always had good food, great service, and experienced a nice time overall. So I thought I knew what to expect, but this time was very different... my friends and I were completely blown away by the new menu.  We tried the fried bok choy with roasted garlic and soy. Very simple, very good.  The tuna and avocado salad is sublime! Delicate pieces of melt-in-your mouth ahi tossed with chunks of perfectly ripe, creamy avocado tossed in evoo and and lime. Yum! We had the local corn truffle tempura, which is an interesting take on an ""elote"". Also good.  The green city, which is a new samba roll and a vegetarian's dream, will make even hard-core carnivores do a double take. In addition to all the new treats, we couldn't leave without ordering the sea bass miso. Formerly the sea bass anticucho, now enhanced by the subtle smokiness of the robata grill.  Chicharron calamari is unchanged and still present on the menu. The ever tender calamari is tossed sweet tamarind sauce with tiny diced tomatoes and red onions with crispy plantains. Delightful balance of flavors. Always a winner!     Yellowtail taquitos, as usual, are perfectly balanced spice, crunch, and flavor.  With eyes bigger than our stomachs, we wanted to dig deep and try more ...but it was not meant to be. We had to stop there, and to my surprise we barely scratched the surface on the menu.  Everything we tried was consistently delicious. Sometimes a menu overhaul can cause kitchen confusion causing quality to suffer overall, that is definitely not the case at Sushi Samba Rio.

2010-05-05,1.0,"Just to give the context for this review - my friend threw a going away party for his wife and invited 20 or so friends for brunch at Sushi Samba rio.  Let's just say that what resulted was a comedy of errors so idiotic that I'm sure no one that experienced it will return.  I have never given a 1 star review before, so I feel like this needs to be justified. Also, being a former server I have a lot of patience for service, even if it sucks. Well, this SUCKED. Royally. Let's review our experience: 1. Arrive and are seated in the swanky circular seating arrangement in the center  2. Wait forever for the waiter, who was confused about the brunch deal. We ask him about the menu and he knows nothing about the dishes offered. He then compensates for the lack of knowledge by saying that he doesn't work on Sunday and also infers that he's being ""punished"" by working the Sunday shift.  3. Wait more time for drinks, which are either incredibly alcoholic or taste like they're virgin. More people are seated around this time. 4. We wait forever for our food and the drinks come out extremely slow.  There is literally one other party in the restaurant at this time. 5. Our food comes after a long wait and is.... uninspired and lukewarm. Most people commented that the food was bland and not that hot. They screw up half of the orders so people receive their food even later than planned 6. One of our party doesn't receive his food at all.  The group is itching to leave since the experience sucked.  We request that the meal be taken off of the bill so that we can leave. 7. The manager comes over and offers to rush the food out. We tell him that we're trying to leave - we just want the food off of the bill.  The manager then offers us free drinks.  We respond that we want to leave, and our friend does not want the food.  The manager then offers to get him the food to go, to which our friend responds ""I guess I can eat it in the car"" 8. To make up for the horrible service, the manager brings over a bottle of champagne.  He pops the cork and hits one of the ladies in our party in the back of the head.  He then pours champagne for 1/3 of our party in their dirty mimosa glasses. 9. After all this, he mentions that ""we give champagne toasts to all our big parties."" Hmmm.... I thought we were being comped for terrible service... All in all one of the worst service experiences I've ever had.  I've eaten here on separate occasions - the sushi is mediocre but the drinks tasty. I'm not sure if they don't do brunch well, but everyone we dealt with here was ill prepared and clueless.  Instead of making up for the service, they made it worse...and worse....and worse.  After a while the lack of service was hilarious for everyone there - except for person who threw the going away party.

To begin, I told the waiter it was my friend's bday and he didn't so much as blink, let alone do anything special.  Ouch.  It's also worth mentioning that our table was really really small and practically touching the one next to us.  I would never go here on a date because of the cramped table arrangement. My friend and I both ordered off the prix-fixe menu and started with lobster gyoza.  It was okay but the sauce was NOT flavorful at all.  In fact, I couldn't tell you what sort of sauce it was supposed to be because it was that bland.  And we were each given a 3-piece serving; hands down the skimpiest gyoza appetizer I've ever received. My friend ordered the swordfish entree and said it was delicious.  I opted for the sushi/sashimi chef's assortment.  Wish I hadn't.  Apparently ""what was fresh that day"" was slimey mackeral sashimi (ew) and the grossest nigiri I've ever had: squid + huge shiso leaf + loads of wasabi.  I spit both out in my napkin.  Fail.  The rest of the assortment was good, fortunately.  I enjoyed the maguro and hamachi sashimi and a tuna-based maki roll which also had shiso in it, albeit more successfully than the huge leaf in the squid nightmare. My friend ordered the donut dessert and loved it.  I asked what sorbet flavors they had and was told mango, green tea and passion fruit.  I ordered green tea.  A bus boy brought me mango (which I don't like) and disappeared.  I sighed and ate it to get the shiso taste out of my mouth.

What does that tell you about the place? It made for a pretty awkward atmosphere until people finally started trickling in a half hour later. In the past I had some very nice cocktails at their bar and thought $16 sounded like a deal for the drinks alone - Was I ever wrong! I first ordered a bloody mary, which was all mix, no vodka and a pretty lousy mix at that. The waitress quickly fixed that with a stiff bloody mary... it wasn't very good but I can forgive a bad bloody mary. My friend, on the other hand, ordered two mimosas throughout our meal the first one was nearly all champagne, which isn't all that bad and then her second drink was all orange juice. There was absolutely no consistency. She was far too sweet to say anything about it but she was clearly disappointed. Later, I ordered a glass of orange juice (listed as fresh squeezed on the menu) and I got what tasted like tang on ice. So I asked if they had any fresh squeezed juice and was told they only have ""this stuff that comes in a box"". When I pointed out that it said ""fresh squeezed"" on the menu she apologized and brought me back a glass of ""fresh squeezed"" orange juice from the bar with a disclaimer that it may not taste very fresh because it was made at 6 am that morning. Question: How does juice go from fresh squeezed to tasting like bad concentrate in just 5 hours? Answer: It doesn't! It's not a big deal if they don't have fresh OJ but don't feed me B.S. over it... I find that unforgivable. My entree was the saving grace of the meal. I ordered the baked eggs with polenta, tomato & monchego and I must admit it was surprisingly tasty. They also served a great cup of coffee. My friends entree on the other hand was a stack of really gummy pancakes with a side of thawed frozen fruit. How do you mess up pancakes? SUSHI Samba might have a decent dinner but don't be fooled by their brunch special. If $16 for brunch and three cocktails sounds too good to be true that's because it is too good to be true. There are probably a few tasty dishes on the menu but as far as brunch cocktails are concerned this place is worthless. I would have happily paid $16 for my baked eggs and coffee but the drinks were so bad that I felt like I should have been paid for drinking them.

Rock Shrimp: spicy and delicious.  Some of the best rock shrimp I've had.   Short Ribs: My coworker would not share!  But he said the portion was very small and not as good as he had tried at other Chicago restaurants. Chocolate banana cake: YUMMMMMMMMMM Dulce de leche Ice cream: YUMMMMMMMMMM-O Fondue: HORRIBLE.  The chocolate is not served warm and the rice krispies and brownies were as hard as a rock.  It's as if they were sitting out since 1975.  A serious waste, don't get this for dessert.   So after 2 hours and $550+ later, we were digesting/talking/enjoying ourselves when the maitre'd asked us to move to the lounge where he would buy us a round of drinks.  Are you kidding me???  I know that there was no other nice way for him to ask us, but A. the restaurant was NOT full - the other party could easily have been seated elsewhere, and B. we just dropped major cash and were not ready to leave yet.  I just thought it was downright TACKY.   Food: A- Ambiance: B+ Service: C+ (our waitress and the servers were great...just that darn maitre'd left a sour taste in my mouth) Not sure I'll come running back...maybe for take-out.",0.9869,0.738,0.162,0.1,0.4718485709302037

The tempura fried green beans with truffle aioli was out of this world! the fresh crispy beans were nicely complemented by the rich and creamy sauce. I'd recommend sharing with no more than one other person or you will soon regret your generosity.  The chef's choice sashimi and nigiri platter was perfect for three people to share - as long as you supplement with a few of their dynamite rolls! Each item was as fresh as could be and the accompanying sauce on the rolls were beyond sublime! Our faves were the ones with kobe beef on the outside or fatly filled with unagi and avocado! Yummers!  I am not so sure about the sides though - the Peruvian corn is nothing like the Mexican street corn I was envisioning. They were giant kernels that were reminiscent of hominy and tasted extremely starchy. Not bad but not great.  Service for lunch was quick and efficient.

2009-10-25,3.0,"While I was impressed with the decor, the service was less than meh.  I came in on a tuesday night with a group of 10 people for a reservation that we had more than two weeks in advance.  It turns out they had an event in the main dining room floor and relegated all the 'normal' diners to the rooftop lounge to dine.  The music as way too loud for a dining room and the furniture was obviously temporary and awkward. For our 7:30 reservation, we had to wait an additional 15 minutes to get seated.  It was an awkward night since it turned out that everything came from the kitchen on the first floor and had to be bussed to the third floor in order to get served.  We were served this amazing short-rib dish over sweet corn arrepas that were fantastic.  Unfortunately, most of the dish was cold by the time it was served.  Additionally, we had ordered 2 orders of a seafood rice curry dish of which only 1 was ultimately ordered by the waitress.  We ended up having to share our existing food with the unfortunate person without an entree until they could come up with an entree for her.  The seafood rice curry dish, though late, was very very good.  The coconut milk with the amount of mussels, salmon, shrimp and rice was in perfect ratio.  I also had the sushi samba rio roll that was also excellent.   In conclusion, the food was amazing, but the service was poor enough to deter another visit.",0.837,0.88,0.077,0.043,0.712051282051282

I wouldn't exactly call it an everyday place (as it definitely trends toward the pricier side for what they offer), but it's great for a birthday or some other celebratory affair. The fish is fresh, the steaks and chicken dishes are phenomenal. Desserts tasty, and the drinks potent and flavorful. If you go around Carnavale time, be prepared for a treat. Their lounge is also pretty swanky and the bathrooms are cool. But what I REALLY love about this place? Their Sunday Funday brunch special. $16 gets you an entree of your choosing and three beverages (either the caipiroska, bloody mary, mimosa or a fantastically yummy mocktail). You can also add any of their sushi options, and things like their fresh and scrumptious churros for an extra charge. The food is all pretty tasty and well cooked. It ranges from breakfast staples with the SushiSamba twist to Brasilian staples like feijoada to creative sandwich options. The drinks are all pretty delicious. If you want the biggest bang for your lushy buck, I'd go with the caipiroska, though they're all great options (even the non-lushy one). But after three caipiroskas?

It seems they are good about aesthetics, but content is not their specialty. Take for instance, my bartender was a cutie-pa-tootie (aesthetics). But maaaaaaaaan did he butcher my mojito (content), Yeck. I told him I didn't like it and he offered to remake it which was nice, but I believe it was worst than the first one.  How bout you just get me a sweet vermouth and I'll sit here admiring the view.  Now I would have probably gone back to check out the food, but one thing made me completely change my mind on it. Call it innovative, modern, intriguing, but I am not down for the washroom to be completely open to the restaurant.  It's not really open per say, but it's behind a clear glass wall and it's coed.  You can see people entering and leaving stalls, washing (or not washing) their hands from almost anywhere in the restaurant.  Um. . .how about not! I'll give it too them that the whole place is really beautiful. Even the open washroom is quite nice.  However, I feel I should only be able to see a sign directing me to the washroom when I'm eating.  Also, I'm sure they could find very attractive bartenders that actually know how to mix drinks.",0.9856,0.82,0.149,0.031,0.5896090534979423

Anyways, onto our latest experience.  Our waitress Jodell was really nice - she was very sweet and cute and gave us some really good recommendations.  I hadn't looked at the cocktail menu yet but she recommended the Nina Fresa martini, and it was awesome.  Full of strawberry flavor and strawberry bits in every sip, I barely tasted the alcohol, so either there wasn't much in there, or it was mixed very well... not exactly worth the $12 price tag, but oh well.  Favorite roll of the night was the Samba Rio Roll - this came recommended by our server, and of course she recommended it, it was the highest priced roll at $17.50, but it has lobster and a lot of it. They even serve it with the empty tail shell, and 1 claw with the meat still inside. This roll was very tasty.  Another favorite was the Pacific - with king crab, and the Asian pear gave it an awesome sweet flavor and nice texture. Least favorite roll of the night was the Maya - shrimp with tomato and tomatillo salsa, this tasted like a taco flavored sushi roll, not my favorite, it was kind of gross once I figured out that ""taste"" was taco seasoning.   Another person got the 5 meat platter and everything was so good.  Huge portion of sides.  This platter is huge, definitely enough food to go around for 4 people with the meat platter and 5 rolls.  Bill came to $160 after tax, including 2 drinks.",0.998,0.72,0.246,0.034,0.6600462962962962

The ambiance was amazing, it felt like a lounge. There were tons of people up there, loud club music but it wasn't the greatest place to try and enjoy a meal. Appetizers came out quickly but it took them over an hour before the entrees came out. Midway through the entree, they tried to being out the dessert (probably because we were there for 2+ hours since it took them so long to bring out the food). We promptly told them we weren't ready and the looked pissed. After the entrees, they brought out the same melted dessert they tried to serve us 30 min ago. We all ordered the chocolate banana cake with ice cream, it was literally a puddle off melted ice cream when we got it. The only plus side of the night? Dimitri, the manager of the lounge. He's hilarious.  Brunch:  Brunch was decent. I had three brazillian cocktails, they were perfectly lime-y and minty. The salmon was mediocre, nothing too spectacular but decent.  Happy Hour: After going to all three meals at Sushi Samba, I have decided that Happy Hour is the only time worth going to sushi samba. The food is cheap, it comes fast and it is delicious.

So, my cousin, she wanted a either, a salmon roll only if they could add mango to it, or she wanted the california roll. Stay with me, she only wanted the california roll if they couldn't put mango in the salmon roll. So, the waitress leaves, then comes back and said, it would take a while to put the mango in the salmon roll, so I just ordered you the california roll (but, they could put the mango in the salmon roll)-STRIKE 1!  Next, she brings the rolls, and we had our initial glass of water when we set down. She was EXTREMELY unattentive. I asked for water about 7 times, no lie! She never brought me more water, and I'm seeing every table around us get more and more water. Dude, bad service....STRIKE 2! We decided, let's not wait around for strike three, so we left, something I NeVER do....without tipping. Instead, I wrote on the receipt-horrible experience, will not be back!  Wait, my fellow reviewers, we experienced Strike 3 when we went outside to get our car. The foolish valet asked swore up and down that we didn't pay for the darn car, when they made you pay before you even went in the restaurant AND gave you a receipt as proof of payment.

They seated us in the back and first thing I thought ""Um are they seating the Asians in one section of the restaurant"" since there were 3 tables of Asians in this back section, including us. As the night went on, 2 more tables of Asians were seated around us ... I dunno, maybe I was just being paranoid. We ordered the Sawagani appetizers, extremely expensive and unexpected ... they're actually tiny crabs and looked spider-like. It was actually juicy ...  I don't think I'd eat it again though. Tasty but I think the side of grilled orange it came with was tastier! We also had a roll as an appetizer, the Pacific roll, and it was great. The Asian pear complement was perfect ... I've always been wary to try fruit pairings with non-sweet plates but it was a delicious treat. Onto our entree, my boyfriend had the red snapper which he just loved and I must say, the presentation was gorgeous. I tasted it but I don't even remember what it tastes like anymore - not memorable, I guess. I ordered the duck and first bite ""tasty flavors!"" But the third bite in I was already sick of it. It was too flavorful and overly salty - the duck was also overdone. I have no idea what they were trying to achieve with that dish (there was a poached egg on top as well) but it was a ""no"" for me. As for dessert, my boyfriend had the mango tiradito, which he thought wasn't paired correctly as far as the flavoring goes. The mango slices weren't ripe enough either. I had the custard which was blah. I'll probably go back to try the sushi since that was the highlight of my meal.

2009-05-09,2.0,"Sushi Samba-Worse customer service!!! My family was coming from Connecticut and since my cousin's wife is Peruvian we decided to surprise her with a fancy dinner ......... but we didn't get what we were hoping for. 1. Since we were 9(7 adults, 1 child (3) and a baby) we were taken to the second floor, and actually i kind of like it, it was sort of private. 2. We order afew appetizers to start and right away the order for the main course...... unfortunately when i order the ""Quinotto with beef"" the waiter said that that was something he was not familiar with and had to check with the chef, later he came back and said ""the Quinotto dish is only available alone, the menu you just view was an old menu"" ... o..k... so why  (in hell) did you give me this menu then??  So i order only the quinotto, which by the way i HATE to say that once you change a name to an item it becomes fancier.... the QUINOTTO is the Peruvian QUINUA, this was the rice of the INCAS, not the rice of the JAPANESS people as he was selling it. I was so embarrassed!!! my aunt had no had quinua in 18 years, so this was a treat to her. I had the unagui roll, but it was tasteless, there is not flavor on it, also i order the side salad, which was pretty good, with big pieces of the Peruvian corn(as big as a dime). I don't even remember what the rest of family had, honestly it is better to forget it. For example: we had and appetizer called ""tiradito"" and pay $15.00 for it, this was a Peruvian-Japanness ceviche, there were only 4 tiny pieces of such, we try to share it but we .... Just couldn't...... 4 tiny pieces??? 4?? I had eaten in De La Costa too and over there dishes are very expensive but even the tiniest little thing has flavor and melts in your mouth, I know about food, I am surrounded by it every day, My husband order the beef something, and he was very upset because his plate came cold, and no he had no chance to tell the waiter because after he drop his plate he disappear, until the end of our dinner, honestly they are behind in customer service!!!!! We spend about $600, probably what i earn in a week, and to be honest it was worth it because i made my cousin happy, but i will never come back to this place, water glasses took for ever to be refilled. bus boy was not even around either, and the place was not even full at all. 3. No one offered us coffee.... Really, so we went down to the best natural frozen dessert in town (nest review), and love it. So in other words: -Bad Service -Slow kitchen -Slow waiters -Bad customer service -Table was so dark, not candles on tables. -Very expensive, not worth it for the type of service given -Should spend money in updating those menus??

I didn't want dessert, but everyone decided I had to order something so I caved into peer pressure and ordered the choco loco drink.  I didn't realize it was a martini, but it was amazing.  I thought that the chocolate fondue was bitter, but everyone else seemed to disagree. Due to the copious amounts of alcohol consumed, I had the chance to utilize their oddly unique bathrooms.  I think their entire bathroom setup is a hazard.  The glass is cool, but I'm surprised there weren't any face prints on the glass doorway which really didn't seem to differentiate itself from the rest of the bathroom.  The Mens and Womens bathrooms share a glass wall, however all the stalls are individual.  It's an interesting concept, but kinda odd as well.  Almost like they were trying to be too contemporary.  The rest of the decor in the restaurant was cool, and overall I'm glad we chose to come here instead of our usual sushi establishments.",0.9975,0.776,0.181,0.043,0.5791371158392435

I went with two friends for Sunday Funday, their new(er) brunch service. The inside of the place is quite unique and visually interesting - but I noticed when we sat down that my chair had a big stain in the middle of it, and all of the chairs looked kind of ratty. The best part of Sunday Funday is the three mimosas or Bloody Marys with your entree. The service was great; we always had a new round of drinks the second our old ones were gone. The entrees, however, left something to be desired. I got my old standby of Eggs Benedict, which didn't even include meat - just poached egg, a special hollandaise,  brioche points, and leafy greens. I know that they're trying to be deconstructionist or whatever, but eggs benedict = meat and eggs. There were 3 small ""benedicts,"" which wasn't particularly satisfying, and no sides. I think I read on the menu that it came with french fries, but they were never served. And it was $16. So yeah, ridiculously overpriced. Honestly, the reason to come to brunch is for the ambiance and the free drinks. I still think I might have preferred to gotten a cheap, big breakfast and pay for drinks, though.",0.9551,0.795,0.133,0.071,0.4672171449949228

The mushrooms on top of the tofu were seasoned beautifully, the side items were amazing. The caipirinha could have used a bit more sugar, but still satisfying. Dessert out of this world.

2009-02-24,2.0,"I wanted to love this place, unfortunately it didn't live up to the hype. First of all, my friend & I were trying to plan a surprise birthday dinner here. He called about two weeks in advance and was told we could do a prix fixe menu which sounded like a great option. They said they'd send the menu out so we could approve it and then we'd be set. However, they didn't send the menu out. He called at least 5 more times to request the menu and each time was told it'd be on the way - but he never received it. Finally, the day before the dinner when he called to find out what was going on, they finally sent out the menu. Too little too late though, we didn't have time to have the rest of the dinner guests approve the prix fixe so we canceled it and said we'd just order a la carte instead. Note to Sushi Samba party planners, get your sh$t together. If you can't even be bothered to send out a menu, that's a bit ridiculous. Oh, and we also requested a special desert to be brought out at the end of the meal - yeah, that didn't happen either but more on that later. Ok, so the night of the surprise dinner. As a few of us are waiting for the rest of the party to arrive, we order a drink in the bar. We were quite surprised when the bill came and we noticed they include gratuity - on drinks ordered at the bar. Seriously? WTF. Let me decide what to tip on a drink. Don't charge me a tip based on your highly over priced drink and then think I'll be happy about it.  We finally get seated and that's when the sh$t show started. Our waiter was a complete bone head. No personality and he could not keep the order straight. We'd order two tall beers, and he'd bring a short and give it to the wrong end of the table. Now had this happened once or even twice, I'd chalk it up to a brain fart. But it kept happening ALL night. Oh, and not to mention the bus boy who poured the beer from one person into the beer for another. Yeah, they were drinking two different beers. And when we complained, he brought out one beer and acted like he was doing us a favor. And I'm not really sure we even got the sushi we ordered cuz when they brought it they just plopped it down without saying what it was. To top it all off, we had pre ordered a special dessert for the birthday girl. Even told the waiter at the beginning of the meal to make sure we got it. Yeah, nothing came. We complained again to a manager and he was like la-dee-da, no big deal. It was a 30th birthday idiot, it IS a big deal. They did comp us a lousy dessert but at that point it just wasnt worth it. The only saving grace for this place is the food was above average for the most part (hence the two instead of one stars). The seviche and calamari were excellent. And a few of the rolls we ordered were fantastic - although some of them were just good but not necessarily better then half a dozen other sush places in the city. Overall the experience was just not up to par with what they charge - it's hella expensive. I'm sorry, I don't have an issue paying for a pricey meal when the food is fantastic and the service excellent. We did not experience that though. In fact, I felt like our server was doing just enough to get by. Why? Cuz he wasn't workin for tip. Of course gratuity is included here so he knew he was gonna get his regardless of the service he provided us. Even after complaining twice - he still didn't improve. I am just disappointed in the overall experience and would be hard pressed to go back. Which is sad because the place itself has a very cool vibe about it. But no way am I paying $100 for shitty service and only above average food. You want to charge me those prices, you best knock my socks off on both accounts and that was NOT the case (and my sentiment was echoed by all 10 in our group).

At first our dining experience started out well, we were promptly seated at our table.  Then things went downhill from there. Our waitress (Connie) did not know about the menu.  She did not know if our fish was filleted or not.  What kind of waitress doesn't know about the food you are serving? The menu.  Overall good options, but the price is overrated.  But then again, i'd take advantage of the suckers with the hookers who come here too. Meal: Overwhelmingly diappointing.  You can get better sushi at most places in the city.  The fish was not seasoned at all.  A mediocre dessert just topped of the evening of what I hope will be a short lived memory - much like the roommate from hell. Service:  I've received better service at the drive-in at McDonalds.  First, our waitress (connie) was not familiar with the menu when asked if the fish was filleted or not.  The ""oh sh*t"" look on her face and ""huh"" was encouraging.  What kind of restaurant does not make their staff try the food they are serving?  Apparently this one.  We waited a long time -- over 20 min -- between appetizers and the main course.  When our waitress came to our table she asked ""didn't they bring out your dessert yet?""  Ummm no genius, we haven't even received dinner yet.  The panic on her face and the fact that our dinner came racing out of the kitchen showed the extent that they have things together.  Dessert/coffee service was the straw that broke the camels back.  Our ""waitress"" not only didn't offer us a dessert menu or coffee, but when she finally presented us a menu (due to our asking), she forgot to come back to see if we wanted anything.  After a mention to one of the many hosts, who did offer us a drink at the bar upstairs - which we declined (we wanted to get out of Dodge) - did she finally appear at our table at his urging.  You would think that with all the people crammed into the entrance (hello: fire hazard) that the staff would be eager to turn over tables. Ambiance:  Looks like the Little Mermaid on crack and if her father was a pimp.  But if you like that kind of thing, enjoy this place.  Watch the hookers you bump into, you might catch something.  There are better, classier and hotter places to be in the city.

I added a star to my previous rating mainly because of the Sambatini and the lounge atmosphere.  It's a great place to just relax with friends.   Unfortunately, the food is still overpriced for the small portions.   One thing I was weirded out by was the new restroom attendant.  I don't remember there being one there before.  She's very helpful in finding you an empty stall, putting soap in your hands, and handing you a towel, but really was she necessary?  I've seen restroom attendants at clubs and bars, but now restaurants?  sheesh!

But there are also some great rolls available - a wide selection for any sushi lover. I'm a big fan of the Bobo Brazil - the pesto and seared Kobe-style beef is awesome. But also - the shrimp tempura roll and veggie roll are tasty. Since I'm a fan of the bottle, it's no surprise that I stop and drink the boozies (similar to those who stop and smell the roses).

2008-08-19,5.0,"Samba is a fantastic looking restaurant, both inside and out.  My first ever visit was a success and I hope to return soon to sample more of their amazing Latin-Asian dishes. I arrived with my mom early for a weeknight dinner and was seated right away in one of the most colorful dining rooms in the city.  Bright colored lights and floors make Samba an experience to remember. Drinks:  Both of us ordered the popular Brazilian drink Caipirinha; one flavored with fresh raspberries and the other traditional.  The drinks were refreshing and quite strong.   Appetizers:  Samba has a million different types of tapas-style appetizers on their menu, along with some special sushi rolls.  We decided to share an order of the Samba Rio Roll and the Shrimp & Chimichurri anticuchos.  The sushi was presented nicely with a tempura lobster claw and had a memorable crunch in each roll.  The anticucho, served over Peruvian-style corn, was delicious.  Six medium shrimp soaked in green chimichurri sauce. Entrees:  We split the Miso Sea Bass and the Chicken Teriyaki.  The sea bass is a must order and was honestly the best cooked fish I have ever tasted.  The presentation and plating was phenomenal as well.  The Chicken Teriyaki was super moist and served on top of purple mashed potatoes.  Simply amazing and we cleaned our plates dry.  We also shared a side order of plantains.  I am a huge fan of plantains and these were cut like giant fries and were addicting.  They were also devoured. Desserts:  Shared two of the large sized desserts.  The Treis Leite and the Warm Chocolate Banana Cake.  The first was served with diced mangoes and resembled three small squares of moist sponge cake with a guava foam whip cream.  Delicious.  The Banana Cake was even better; super soft and chocolaty with a small topping of vanilla ice cream.  Again, the plates were entirely cleaned and any food remaining on them was quickly eaten up. Service: Hands-down the best I've had in a long time.  Our waitress showed she cared about our understanding of the menu and was one of the happiest servers I've met.  The front desk staff is a little out there, but really, what professional host or hostess isn't? Overall:  Sushi Samba Rio is a top-of-the-line restaurant and rivals any sushi place around.  Trust me, you will not be disappointed!",0.9944,0.829,0.167,0.004,0.587151841868823

Their cocktails are very good (I've had the Caipirinha and Samba Juice) but to your wallet they may as well be twinkies and steroids. I like the range of appetizers here. Chicharron de calamar is way too large of a serving for one person (so makes a good table appetizer) and is not your usual calimari. It comes off as heavier than most, but also quite flavorful with radishes, sprouts, stewed tomatoes, and plantains to add to the spicy, corn-crusted sea demons. Also things like the edamame and green bean tempura are very good and an inexpensive way to munch on something tasty while sipping a cocktail. The sushi is very reasonably priced at around $5-7 per 6 Maki rolls. Nigri is a bit more. They shy away from crazy combinations and sauces and just give you a nice piece of raw fish, seaweed wrap, thin layer of rice, and maybe an onion or jalapeno or whatever else was supposed to be there. I like the simplicity here. There are also oysters and perhaps even some ceviche on the menu (the oysters are good and run about $2-3 per oyster). Never had desserts. It's very possible to eat here for around $15/person (just get some maki and a beer), but doing the full experience will put you back more like $40/person.",0.9821,0.832,0.138,0.03,0.5234105749323141

An earlier reviewer, Mitz K., said that the place is ""agressively decorated"" - that is the perfect description.  Not so much that it distracted me but it was definitely over the top. The cucumber martini was so good - not too sweet and very refreshing.  I think I had three of them!  (should mention I was on someone else's dime, and therefore could afford so many of these drunken luxuries) We had a bunch of appetizers, the green bean tempura, mini chicken tacos, butter lettuce wraps - all very tasty.  The tempura could have been crispier but the flavors of all the dishes were great. I liked the sushi - ok, so maybe it's not the best in the city but I enjoyed the little touches of sauces and different flavor combinations.  I didn't do the ordering and didn't hear exactly what all the rolls were, but one was unagi and one was a spicy tuna roll.  All were delish. I would go back - and the fact that I didn't have to pay for anything might have enhanced my experience there even more.  But it was fun.

Now, for some reason I always have to comment on bathrooms, but I'd rather not leave it a mystery if this is your first time, because this could really trip a person out.  The bathrooms here are all glass (minus the stalls thank God!) and I wanted to think it was just one of those illusions, but as I was doing teeth check in the mirror, I looked over and saw my guy friend through the glass in the boys bathroom.  The female bathroom needs to be completely off limits to all eyes, ears, etc. of men, and this one just kind of crosses the line.   Anyhow, this place is beautiful and definitely unlike any other sushi place I've experienced before.  This isn't going to be added to my list of staple sushi places, but I'd definitely come back with visitors to try & wow them with the awesome decor.",0.997,0.798,0.195,0.007,0.5838888888888889

We ordered the seared Kobe beef with truffles and mushroom appetizer and I can honestly say it was one of the best things that have ever touched these lips. The edamame was standard, the green beans tempura with truffle sauce was pretty fantastic. Crispy but not greasy at all. The tuna ceviche was not that great. Bland and the pieces of fish were cut much too large, and not that high quality. The size of the fish cuts really threw off the texture of the dish. The Green envy roll was lacking craetivity and looked like it had just been thrown together, but the texture was very nice. The fish was fairly fresh, and they threw in a couple of pieces for free. The salmon was slightly stringy though. We also had a couple of cocktails. I had the pesco sour. I didn't like it personally, but it was because of a certain flavor, not the drink itself  (which come with whipped egg whites on top), the waiter happliy took back the Pesco and brought me a strawberry martini which was awesome. My sister had the cucumber martini tasted very good, but I didn't like the cucumber pulp in the drink so much.

Honestly, my main gripe about Sushi Samba is that I don't remember portions being that small in NY!  Our waitress warned us that the portions were really small and she suggested we supplement our meal with 3 rolls and a plate of sashimi (which they called ""tiradito"" because it's seasoned).  The rolls were ok - nothing special - but the fish was fresh and everything was nicely presented.  The tiradito was also decent, but really not worth $33 since we got 3 carpaccio-thin slices of 4 different types of fish. Onto the Restaurant Week menu (a.k.a. Food for Smurfs).  There were 2 options each of appetizer, entree, & dessert, and so to try everything, we got 3 orders of each split between 6 ppl.  The yellowtail sashimi (er, I mean tiradito)  was again, quite good, though I'm not a fan of adding oil to my already oily raw fish.  The lobster appetizer was better since we got 3 decent size chunks of lobster claw atop a bed of bamboo rice.  Maybe because she noticed our table was all Asian, but our waitress stopped by to ask if we could taste the bamboo in the rice.  Ummm, not really - bamboo doesn't have much taste and we're not pandas.  However, the rice had a nice springy chewy texture and complemented the lobster well. The entrees (black bass & pork chop) came and they were about the same size as the appetizers.  The little square of fish looked very precious in the big plate.  The Kurobuta (the ""Kobe"" of pork) chop was also tiny.  If a serving of meat is the size of a deck of cards, then the pork chop was the equivalent of maybe just a suit within the deck.  Taste-wise, everything was quite good, but it wasn't amazing - if it had been, I would have forgiven Sushi Samba for serving me dim sum for dinner. Dessert was just not good in terms of taste.  The Fuji apple seviche tasted very strongly of alcohol.  The banana chocolate cake was ok, but it was seriously a slice of banana topped with a round of cake the same size.  Baby food! Service was excellent.  Our waitress came multiple times to ask us how things were.  Our bill came to about $57 pp (including tax & tip, no drinks) which was quite pricey considering no one was full.  I would probably come again, but I would order a la carte next time - I think our bill in NY wound up being quite similar, but I remember trying more things and being full.",0.9895,0.837,0.117,0.047,0.4801585266585266

Anything sparkling and sweet is right up my ally, so it was bound to be good, which it was. The boy had a couple kettle tonics. We started with the Amazon platter that consisted of just about everything from the raw bar. Great selection of oysters, lobster, crab claws, jumbo shrimp and ceviche. If the meal continued to be this good this review would be five stars. Since we ordered such a large appetizer we decided to get three rolls. Although I was in the mood for meat and seafood, Kevin was leaning to more seafood. Lucky for me they had the bobo Brazil roll that was topped with Kobe beef. Although it was good it did have too much avocado(gasp! does such a thing exist). We also ordered the tuna roll special. The waiter described it as a dragon roll with only tuna. I got really excited about this, because A. I love tuna, and B. I love dragon rolls w/o eel. When it arrived it had a great presentation, and the tuna was fresh, but it definitely was not out of this world. The third roll we ordered was the yellow tail scallion. I really liked this roll. It was absolutely tiny, but it was great quality.

We didn't order any sashimi (I'm usually disappointed by sashimi from trendy/non-authentic restaurants like this) but the lobster bisque was AMAZING!

2008-01-04,4.0,"Update, May 2008. Wednesday nights at SushiSamba is now a shadow of its former self - bear that in mind when you read my review below.   Sushi Samba Rio rocks.I've eaten there several times, and the food is always excellent, the service fantastic, and the vibe of the place is great. Admittedly I have only gone on a Wednesday night, when at 10.30pm ish an outrageously good Samba band plays, complete with dj, drummers, dancers and the best clarinettist you've heard in your life. If that doesn't float your boat, the fully costumed dancers, breakdancers and the gymnast surely will. On the food front, the sashimi is first class, especially served with a ridiculously good lemongrass sauce. The handrolls are a little on the plain side, but ask for the specials or go with the whole fish. The wine list is terrific with some excellent sauvignon blancs that match well with the food. Even a trip to the washroom is fun with a genteel older South American woman there to help you wash your hands and who always calls you babe (or is that just me?!)  Valet service is very prompt, the host and hostess are excellent and if you get bored (which you won't) head upstairs to Sugarcane the rooftop bar where in summer the roof retracts and you can bathe in both gin and sun. Dinner always costs me more than I think its going to, probably becuase everything on the menu is so good that we just keep ordering more. Go if you want a really fun night with great service, excellent food, great wine and dinner in a restaurant full of life.",0.9964,0.765,0.216,0.019,0.5847718253968254
2008-01-03,3.0,"I can only speak for the brunch, which, at $15, is a steal for this place.  4 brunch items are served family style and you can pick from about 10 choices, including a selection of pastries, granola fruit and yogurt, steak and eggs, eggs benedict, salmon and cream cheese roll, and french toast. The food was very good and we had plenty for 2 people--sushi for brunch is a great idea.  I thought I might get an extra roll or two, but it was so expensive, I couldn't justify spending that much on sushi--especially when I know I can get it elsewhere for less and it will taste just as good. The service was friendly and decent--refilled our coffee and tea frequently, which I'm glad were free refills, as the drinks were expesnive (around $4, I believe). Seating was uncomfortable--we had benches with no backs and the lighting was shining right in my boyfriend's eyes.  We were also unnecessarily close to a group of 4.  Also, while there is a lot of seating, the interior is so big, it seems to take the servers a long time to get from point A to B. Sound--I could hear everyone's conversations.  If I had wanted to be inundated with sound, I could have gone to a diner for brunch. Bathrooms--weird and uncomfortable--the walls are glass, and you can see into the men's and women's.  Isn't the point of having an enclosed bathroom so you can primp and refresh without prying eyes?   I'll probably go back for brunch, but I doubt I'll head to Sushi Samba for an evening meal--if I'm going to spend a lot of hard-earned money, it better be for excellent food, service AND bathrooms.",0.9754,0.863,0.105,0.032,0.5063038548752834

Food has always been fantastic.  Very consistent.  Been there with friends, business colleagues and family and it's always delicious.  I get so sick of ""plain old"" sushi that these kicked-up rolls and dishes hit the spot for me.  If you are satisfied with bland spicy tuna rolls and rubbery sashimi, stay away. Also been here for brunch with friends and HOLY CRAP is it good.  Sushi for brunch, you say?  Yes, I say.  When I've been there they've done some sort of crazy prix fixe menu (VERY reasonable, btw) that includes a morning cocktail.  Everything was delicious, be ready to share.   One star knocked off for the service.  You live in Chicago, honey, lose the attitude.  I don't care how good this place is, these waitresses (not sexist, but my bad experiences have primarily been with the female waitstaff) can be really snippy.  My best friend's fiancee (female) complains about these girls louder than I do.

We were seated at a 10-top, and they definitely didn't bring out enough food.   Specifically, here are my complaints: 1) Appetizers - 2 platter of the following: 2 chicken on a stick, 2 vegetable gyoza, 2 short rib gyoza.  The short rib gyoza was the best part of the entire meal.  Again, all for 10 people. 2) They brought out 1 platter of sushi/sashimi for a table of 10 (21 pieces total: 3 of each - tuna, salmon, yellowtail sushi and sashimi, unagi sushi).  I had ask for an extra platter because we were all eyeing the 3 pieces of unagi on the platter.   3) The Bobo Brazil Roll and Veggie Kun Roll were on our fixed menu.  We did not get these rolls.  After our entrees came out, I had to specifically ask why we didn't get these rolls.  The server said that he would ask the sushi chefs to make us some, then we got 1 Bobo Brazil roll for the entire table.  1.  Rolls were mediocre. 4) The three main courses were also served family style.  2 of each main course for the table.  The Sea Bass was served at room temperature, if it had been even slightly hot, it would have been delicious.  The hangar steak and pork tenderloin were so dry, it was worse than eating cardboard.  Wow, I don't think I could dry out a piece of meat this much if i tried!!!  The chicken teriyaki was delicious, but again, not enough food.  Our side of the table got sides of rice, beans, and green, but the other side did not until the end of the meal.  What shitty service.  Which bring me to my next point... 5) If I weren't staring at the menu, they would not have brought us any food!  A different person kept coming over every 10 minutes to ask if we had received the course, and our answer every time was no.  Then they wouldn't come back with the next course unless we specifically asked for it by name!!!   6) Dessert - stay away from the melon balls.  Gross! The chocolate cup was the best thing out of the desserts. 7) They kept taking my chopsticks without bringing out new ones!!!  LEAVE THE CHOPSTICKS - PLEASE!

About halfway through dinner, I got up to use the restroom and was stopped by a circle (like when someone breakdances).  I think they were pros hired by the restaurant, but this one guy and chick were dancing Capoeira - very very cool.  I stopped to watch for a bit, then went to a nicely designed bathroom, complete w/attendant.  A little bit later they had some full-out Brazilian dancers shaking like salt shakers (not sure if they were actually Brazilian though). Also props to Sushi Samba hostess - I told her as soon as we sat down that we had a birthday boy and they took care of it...brought out some chocolate mousse thing which our waiter said was the best dessert on the menu.   Lastly, there were lots of cute waitresses...clientele wasn't bad either - definitely a see and be seen type of place.  All in all, lots of fun!

The sushi here is for the most part very fresh - I had set the bar lower for a chain, but was impressed. Their list of daily specials also featured a few hard to find pieces, in addition to 'better than average' selections (i.e. Kanpachi). You can get a feel for the 'ambiance' based on the photos, but a bit over the top.

Although I find the overall design scheme to be a bit tacky- (think Logan's run v.s. ikea) it does have a grand allure. Their upstairs bar is a great spot for drinks in the summer time because it has a roof deck vibe- nice cross breeze. The main dining room is open and vast- good for people watching.  The service is great- very proffessional staff. Upbeat, friendly, knowledgable- definately a thumbs up there.  The food however, I do find to be lack luster. I know I am very hard to please when it comes to sushi- so I've tried the food a few times and have always been left with the feeling that i did not just eat sushi.  I think that their rolls are a little overdone as far as the ingredients go. That being said- it must please many because sushi is not for everyone, and their style is geared towards the impurists. I value a freshly cut piece of sashimi anyday to eight ingredient rolls. For sashimi, I think many large scale places just cannot get the fish to the table quickly enough- or have too much stock, tables....   I was told by a sushi restaurant owner that sashimi must be served within 90 seconds of being cut because the fish oils dry up.

Everything was fantastic. The vegetable tempura was crisp & flavorful.  The cucumber roll was fresh as can be.  The Nina Fresa (strawberry martini) was divine.  I'm not a huge sake fan, but everyone seemed to appreciate our 3 bottles). The 2 omakase partakers were thrilled with their meal.  They had a fantastic attitude of ""don't tell me what it is until you bring it out,"" which I admired (simply because I don't think I'd be that adventurous). I ordered a salad - something like Plaintain Crusted Goat Cheese salad - it was HEAVENLY.  I was tempted to lick the plate, it was that good.  & this is coming from a burgeoning salad-snob. The best part of the meal (besides the company & the salad), however, was the dessert that came with the omakase.  It was a mango cake deliciousness.  Seriously, I told my friend, ""I want to just keep this in my mouth ... it's absolutely divine!"" Our server was fantastic, so patient (when it took us forever to order because the sake expert was busy choosing drinks for many minutes), attentive, friendly, & answered all of our questions with a sense of humor & expertise.  He also obliged us by taking a photo of the table (which I normally cringe at the mention of). I agree with one reviewer, though, the bathrooms are weird.  & the attendant does everything but wash your hands for you ... which is weird & a little odd.  & the clear walls are interesting, but me likes my privacy, even if it's only when I'm washing my hands & checking my reflection in the mirror.",0.9971,0.735,0.231,0.034,0.5827572964669739

2007-01-03,3.0,"I was in Chicago for work, was craving some sushi, and got a recommendation for Sushi Samba Rio. An interesting concept -- Japanese/Brazilian/Peruvian. I went with my friend on Wednesday night and reservations on  opentable.com  were relatively easy to make and lots of time slots were available. Immediately upon entering the restaurant, you get the vibe that this is a trendy place to hang out for a drink and a bite to eat. There's a fairly large stage at the back of the dining room. We left around 9.45pm on the Wednesday night when they're supposed to have music and dancing, and the music still hadn't started, so I'm not sure what the actual music start time is. The equipment was all set up and I had seen some girls holding samba costumes walk in, but no music or dancing was seen and it was getting a bit late. From the other reviews here, it looks like there's an upstairs area also, but I didn't notice one, so didn't go to check it out.  Inside, there are lots of large and small tables, with padded sofa-like booths and chairs, so there are lots of seating options. It's definitely a hip-looking place.  Drinkwise, the sake selection is extensive, with prices starting from $30 for a 300ml bottle up to $100 for a 700 ml bottle. Maybe I have been on the West Coast for too long, but I'm used to having my sake served to me in a ceramic cup, not in a sherry glass like they do here. Oh well... we ordered two bottles of different unfiltered sakes and they were both excellent at approximately $30 - $40 per bottle. While the restaurant bills itself is a fusion South American/Japanese restaurant, I would say the Japanese influences outweigh the South American influences at about 65-35. They do have straight Japanese nigiri sushi and sashimi and Brazilian churrasco (BBQ meat). We tried to order the more interesting fusion dishes, but they were still primarily Japanese -- beef tataki, $12 tuna sashimi seviche (South American influences, but basically chopped tuna sashimi with pepper and fruit garnish), $11 yellowtail tartare, $27 crispy red snapper (fried pieces of red snapper accompanied by hot sauce and coconut rice), an eggplant roll and udon with green beans and mushrooms, the $12 green envy roll (5 pieces... mainly a salmon roll with asparagus... couldn't taste the supposed wasabi pea crust or the lime), plus some uni (which was delicious and very fresh at $4 per piece). The food portions are small. We ordered all of that food plus two desserts (an apple dessert plus green tea ice cream) and all the plates left us clean. Total bill before tax and tip was almost $180 for two people. Eeeeks! The food was good, but it's not the best Japanese food or sushi/sashimi I've ever had (but probably the most I've paid!).  I was looking for some really innovative fusion dishes, but I was disappointed, hence the three star rating. The innovation just wasn't there. And, for the price I paid, I would go to my favorite neighborhood Japanese places for a fraction of the price. Having said that, this is somewhere you go for the atmosphere. This is a great place to hang out with friends for drinks and good company. Plus, if you stay late enough, I'm sure the music would pump the mood up some more.",0.9946,0.856,0.113,0.031,0.442907647907648

Overall, I'm glad I tried Sushi Samba Rio, but I don't think I would go back...unless someone else was paying.  ;)",0.9815,0.799,0.175,0.026,0.5810457516339869

I love sushi and I was a little disappointed that I didn't like it here - and it's really pricey.  If I went back I'd probably try their fish or something else besides sushi.",0.4037,0.644,0.2,0.156,0.538888888888889
2006-04-14,4.0,"My 100th Review!!!  For this strange occasion, I shall write about Sushi Samba Rio.  I really enjoy this restaurant.  The ambience is just fabulous!  I like how the decorations are so colorful and funky; sometimes it may look ridiculous, but it somehow works.  Anywho, a couple of friends and i went over for lunch.  We all ordered the bento lunch.  I really enjoyed the teriyaki chicken.  The tuna rolls that came with it weren't too bad.  Service was efficient; nothing too spectacular, but on cue.  The best thing about lunch was the price.  For under $20, all of us had a huge lunch with leftovers.  This is just a fun place to go and hang out with friends, especially if you want a satisfying bite.",0.993,0.659,0.31,0.03,0.6904761904761906

The rooftop on top of this bar is awesome- you feel like your outside without actually being outside! It's a great place to throw a party!",0.9697,0.608,0.314,0.078,0.46291666666666664

2006-04-05,3.0,"Went with reservations with a big group, but they sat us in the lounge area on the top floor. It was hard to balance all of the food on the footstools, knees  and couch-like seating as well as hold any kind of conversation due to the noise level (therefore bumping the rating to a 4 even before we tasted the food). I kind of wish they just did not take our reservation for that night because I think even if the food was perfect we could not have really enjoyed it. However, the atmosphere on that floor is pretty good if you were only interested in drinks and a snack. The reason I give it only 3 stars instead of 4 is that the sushi/sashimi wasn't the greatest/freshest.  However, I must say, their Chicharron de Calamarwas fantastic. Even though I currently give it a 3, I may be convinced to go back (sitting in the dining room) and to try their non-sashimi/sushi items.",0.9829,0.782,0.187,0.031,0.6510416666666667

2006-03-07,5.0,The decor is amazing and I can't say enough about the atmosphere.  It is such a fun place to go and I love bringing out of town guests here because they just love it as well.  The sushi and cooked food is delicious and I don't even mind the higher prices since it is such a fun place to be.  Word of warning though- the bathrooms are a bit confusing- I'm still not sure if I accidentally walked into the men's room or not!,0.9708,0.665,0.271,0.063,0.5657407407407408

2005-09-11,4.0,"When one thinks of Peru and Brazilian, Japanese doesn't normally come to mind. But their big cities are far more diverse than most Americans imagine, and SushiSamba Rio actually does reflect a real-life cultural fusion. I usually prefer my fine dining in more small, intimate settings, but the big, splashy warehouse setting is worth checking out. Its New York branch was once featured in Sex And The City, and its easy to see why -- the 70s-style decor, clientele and food are all diverse eyecandy. And most importantly, the food is excellent, from the raw sushi to Chilean sea bass and churrasco (Brazilian barbecue). Those craving a scaled-down (smaller, cheaper) version they could afford to go to more than a blue moon should also check out Rodan.",0.9436,0.88,0.12,0.0,0.44997668997668994
