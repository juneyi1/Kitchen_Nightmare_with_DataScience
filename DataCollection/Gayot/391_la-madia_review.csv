2016-12-06,3.0,"I am sad to have to drop a star off of my last review but I feel it's necessary after my visit here Saturday night. I have come to love this place and always make sure to dine here when in Chicago.  I had made reservations ahead of time having remembered long lines, and seeing that it was Saturday I thought it would be a good idea. They called to confirm and I thought we were all set. Upon arriving we had about a 10 minute wait, which is understandable, these things happen. I was disappointed with the reception received from the hostess, very cool and not too inviting. She hurried off after telling us we would need to wait (she didn't specify how long) and when she came back a few short minutes later she asked me my name again.  Didn't make me feel valued as a customer. Whatever, she was having a bad day. We were seated in the lounge area, next to a large noisy party. Definitely not the same atmosphere I remembered on previous trips when we had been seated in the main dining area. The curious thing about all this is the fact that the place really wasn't busy considering it was a Saturday night.  It still gets 3 stars because of the quality of the food. Everything is so fresh tasting. The salads are great and are a perfect segway into a delicious pizza or pasta. This night we chose one of the white pizzas.... Wild mushroom and smoked mozzarella.  I love mushrooms and was very disheartened to find there was only 1-2 per slice. When you advertise the pizza as being a wild mushroom pizza it sounds as if there might be more than one variety and for a place with this caliber of food you would expect more.  This is the reason I dropped a star. The hostess was much friendlier on our way out and when she asked how everything was I was honest and mentioned the mushroom debacle. She looked genuinely surprised and told me to mention that the next time I dined there.  That's still up in the air, with all the great places to eat in Chicago I'm not positive there will be a next time.",0.9946,0.77,0.17,0.06,0.4864243766569347

I made eye contact w/our server 5x, but he didn't get a hint to come take our order until my friend said something.  In terms of the food, I would say Osteria La Madia gets 4.5 stars. I had the Frutti di Mare pasta, which was delicious, but the thin-crust prosciutto pizza we ordered wasn't anything phenomenal. The bottom of the pizza was a bit soft/soggy, and I was hoping it would have been more crisp. The bottle of wine we had was great. The ambiance of the restaurant is very lovely and romantic, and even a bit trendy. I particularly liked how they chose to display their wine at the front of the store, as well as how you can see the chefs making pizza (depending on where you are seated).  I asked if the server had affogato, and he said ""is that an espresso with vanilla bean gelato?"".

2016-08-07,1.0,"Let me tell you about our experience: My wife and I arrived around 815pm on a Saturday night. The restaurant looked about 70% full and they say us fairly quickly. We were a bit indecisive picking a glass of wine. The waitress did not seem knowledgeable about the wine menu and so we tried a glass and ended up ordering another. We had a few questions on the menu (it is the second time we had been to this restaurant and the menu had changed). We were informed that the ahi tuna bruschetta was like a tuna poke bruschetta. So we ordered the Ahi tuna bruschetta and 2 pizzas. Our general experience up to this point was slow, frustrating, unhelpful, and every question felt like it was being met w resistance. Literally 40 minutes later our bruschetta came out (we did not see our waitress for that entire time in between). It was not a tuna poke just 3 pieces of tuna on top of 3 crostinis. The presentation, taste, and overall time to get our food was terrible for what we ordered and incredibly slow. We asked the waitress if she had put in the pizza order yet because the appetizer had taken a while to come out. She said she had not because she was waiting for the appetizer to come out. She then proceeded to tell us about a big party that was at the restaurant who ordered a lot of food (mind you the restaurant is about 60% full at this point). Again the service unhelpful, unauthentic, and there was yet another excuse for a question we had. So we asked to see a manager. The manager came over in the tiny little corner we were in with 4 tables of people around us and asked (in a fairly loud voice) ""I understand you are upset that the service has been slow"". We proceeded to explain that the service has been slow, that we felt like every question was met w resistance, that there was just an overall lack of sincerity in our experience.  Without saying so much as I apologize, he caught us totally off guard and goes ""can you give me specific examples of questions and the types of answers you have been receiving?"" Caught a little off guard I was happy to explain the wine choice, appetizer choice, 40min in between ordering and getting our 3 pieces of tuna, and the general tone, attitude, and resistance we received from the waitress. He then said ""oh I am sorry you feel that way what is a fair way to make it up to you?"" So we just asked if we could take our pizza to go. He then again apologized and we responded with ""yes we are disappointed this has been an awful experience."" This is when shit hit the fan. The manager goes, in no exaggeration ""whoa, whoa, that is completely different than what you first told me"". Again, caught a little off guard and get increasingly frustrated and upset we told him that that was exactly what we explained to him. We are now making a scene in front of this entire part of the restaurant and the manager is still speaking loudly with no regard to the other tables around. This manager literally had an excuse for everything that was happening citing the kitchen being backed up, the restaurant being completely full, etc. So we just asked for a check for the 2 drinks and the appetizer. Mind you it is now almost 930pm and we had been there for over an hour. I have never ever experienced such an awful display of customer service in my life. The way that the waitress miscommunicated to the manager our initial complaint, the manager's lack of sincerity in talking with us, the unauthentic nature of his attitude, tone of voice, lack of willingness to help, and excuse for literally everything that we had to say, as well as making a scene in his own restaurant was infuriating and disappointing.  The manager, at this point, did not know how to handle this situation at all, tried to apologize again (little late for that) and so we asked if he could just go get the check. As he walked away the table next us grabbed him to speak w him. Their bill was incorrect and they waited over an hour for their entrees. He immediately apologized and offered to take it off their bill.  He brought us our bill for $40 for 2 drinks and the appetizer which we paid and left. I can't emphasize enough how poorly this situation was handled. It was truly one of the worst displays of customer service and experience that I have ever seen in my life.

The mozzarella was not a fondue - it wasn't nearly melty enough. There was also too little cheese for the tomato sauce or was in. There was maybe one good chunk of mozzarella. The bread it came like, basically a naan, was good though. The tuna bruschetta was just raw tuna on baguette. The tuna was good but it wasn't really anything special. My boyfriend and I split carbonara and wild boar bolognese. The bolognese was out of this world good. The carbonara was served with two egg yolks on top, but the pasta wasn't quite hot enough to get that creamy carbonara result. I also thought there weren't enough peas or pancetta. The service was also slow and the waitress never refilled my wineglass, despite refilling my boyfriend's several times.

They had a pretty limited menu; I couldn't believe they only had 4 pasta dishes (you're an Italian restaurant right?) and if there were any specials my server didn't tell me about them. Their saving grace was their wine menu which I will say was impressive although not too many of them were available just by the glass. I went with the pea and parmesan risotto which was warm (not hot) and probably re-heated, extremely soupy and lacked any seasoning whatsoever apart from the cress on top which I didn't like at all. There wasn't even a hint of parmesan and my server never offered any to grate on top or any black pepper to grind which any decent Italian restaurant would do. I may have chosen badly from the menu with this dish but nothing on there was inspiring me and I wasn't getting any help from the server. It's clear to me why it was so easy to get in here and yet RPM even has a line to sit at the bar - in future, I'll happily wait. The restaurant itself has good decor although they had the big windows at the front open which was a mistake when its 75 and humid outside.

They let us stay as long as we wanted - which was wonderful since we all came from different areas of the state.  My nephew organized the entire party, with the requirement that the prosecco kept flowing the entire time. The staff was very good at filling up glasses and opening new bottles. Cinnamon rolls and donut holes were present on every table before we even sat down. Appetizers were brought out as we were just about to sit down. The waiters and waitresses were friendly and courteous. Getting our food was a bit of a problem. They took our orders and then the wait began for the food.  The first table got their food in a timely fashion. Our table did not get food till after the others were done. I understand they had other patrons in the place...but really...our food should have been timed better. The pizzas were baked fresh in a huge pizza oven. These should have taken only 4 -5 minutes to cook and the ovens should be able to bake more than 1 pizza at a time. Knowing that you are having a party of about 30 people, they should have been better prepared in the kitchen. Appetizers that were pre-ordered were very tasty. The pizzas had a great crust and good toppings. The pepperoni with truffle oil was a bit too greasy. Maybe the truffle oil should have been put into the crust instead of on top of the pepperoni oil.  The pressed brioche panini was very small. If we did not have appetizers ahead of time, that sandwich would not have filled anyone up. The brioche french toast looked marvelous.

I was pleasantly surprised that a semi-fancy River North establishment provided delivery, even if it was through a 3rd party. The meal was delivered 25 minutes after it was placed, and during peak hour. That blew my mind. Now...onto the meal itself. We ordered the Cacio e Pepe (house-made spaghetti), Tagliatelle all' amatriciana, and tomato and bufala mozzarella fondue, which is more like naan and a side of tomato sauce w/ a large piece of mozzarella floating on top. You can choose between small and large for the pastas, and got small for both. There is a price difference of $6. I guess we should've ordered one large to compare the portions. Anyways, small was more like child portion, or anti-pasti size. There were tiny bits of bacon in the tagliatelle but everything else was straight up tomatoes/tomato sauce, cheese pieces, bread, and pasta. The meal that cost maybe 3 dollars to make ended up being over $54 dollars w/ tip and delivery charge. That is why i say i had the most expensive Italian meal of my life.

And it was delicious and we were stuffed. Second experience: WHAT HAPPENED?? I took 2 friends there last night, a Saturday.  Margherita pizza was 10 inches, sparsely topped (each slice was 2 bites, the rest was crust) for $18.  We literally were served 9 pieces of gnocchi for $12 (that's $1.33 per bite, ya'll). Worse, the food wasn't as tasty as I remember.  I complained (about the size), and to the credit of the manager, she agreed that the pasta looked too small and sent out a second dish.  She said they have a new chef and the pizzas are being cooked ""thicker"" so they don't come out as wide - but honestly, our pizza was so thin it could not hold the sauce and mozz (the crust alone was SUPER thick).  The manager was great (and the reason I'm giving them any stars) and also sent out a bruschetta.  That lady needs 5 stars and a raise. However, this isn't a sustainable practice, and for the fact that they had such high variability, I'll stay away and go to one of the other places where I know what I'm paying for.  BTW, my beer was also overcharged ($10 instead of $5) and I had to point that out, I felt like such a bitch, but I just think they need to rethink their practices.  The waiter was also curt when I initially complained - he did get the manager promptly, but he made some comment afterwards about ""getting our little tummies full.""  Which is pretty rude - I'm not complaining b/c i'm hungry and too cheap to order more, I'm complaining because your food isn't worth the money, regardless of how hungry I am.  If they get the quality and service back that I experienced in early June, I'd be happy to go back and hopefully can write a rave review then.",0.9832,0.811,0.133,0.055,0.43657325131009334

So we expressed that we would prefer a regular sit down table so we can actually talk to each other versus screaming across the bar. There was an open table available but they said that was reserved. What the hell? Our reservation apparently didn't matter. So they said there would be a few minutes wait. Almost an hour after our reservation time, we were seated...after being told that they were bumping us UP on the list because we've been waiting a while. Really? So we were further down?

2015-05-01,3.0,"Perfectly located downtown this restaurant had the most amazing looking menu - I wanted to try everything! Some of it shines and some of it was just okay.  Firstly, the ambiance and decor is great, as was the service. We were lucky enough to be seated in the small back room with only 3 tables so it was much quieter than the noisy main dining room. We each tried a local craft beer and liked them both. And we built our own cheese plate which was the star of the meal. We tied the farm cheese and the taleggio. Both were great but the farm cheese blew us away - so creamy and yummy! And it was served with the most amazing bread- made to order. It was more like a calzone with no stuffing. So good! For entrees hubby ordered the pappardelle with wild boar ragu which he said was good but not great- he wouldn't order it again. Our server told him the he should order the larger size since the smaller one was really more of a tapas size. The larger size was a good medium sized portion. Based on this I decided to order several appetizers and sides. Weirdly the portion sizes on these were MUCH larger than his pasta which felt very out of proportion but also meant I ordered WAY to much food! I got the following: - tomato and cheese fondue - this is not fondue. It was a yummy tomato bisque with a tiny amount of cheese grated on top and served with a GIANT calzone- bread. Yummy but not what I was expecting. - grilled artichokes - these were great but it was four quarters of a huge artichoke which meant a very large portion. Cooked well and served with a dipping aioli that was good but didn't add much - I ate the artichokes plain and was happy - side of heirloom carrots with honey - this looked very pretty with multicolored heirloom carrots, and the honey sauce was good but the carrots were not evenly cooked  - some were perfect some too crunchy. I ate a few and left the rest. So now, the next day, I am still stuffed. I ate about half of the food I ordered and even that was way to much.

We had a great large, round table in the back, so it felt like we had our own area and it was easy for us to converse with each other, which isn't usually the case for a larger party.  The food was all delicious--we had the mushroom bruschetta, two pastas (I think the pappardelle and gnocchi), and a few pizzas--pepperoni, artichoke, carbonara, and margherita.  It was plenty of food for nine people and we had close to a pizza and a half leftover. The only downside to our experience is that our waitress was inexplicably rude.  She tried to get us to increase our orders multiple times (to pad the bill, evidently.)  The bottles of wine she recommended were too expensive, and when asked what we could order that would be similar and within our price range, she said ""I don't know"" without offering to ask the manager (or a sommelier, if they had one). Lastly, when I tried to order a mocha after dinner, she said, ""no"" without an explanation. Evidently they don't serve them, but there are more appropriate ways to respond to a request that can't be fulfilled.  The other people in my party especially thought her behavior was strange because everyone else we interacted with (the two people who refilled wine, water, and cleared plates) were polite and friendly.

We split lamb meatballs and burrata for appetizers...definitely recommend. For dinner, we split a triple pepperoni pizza. My boyfriend got a Brooklyn lager that he was thrilled about, and I got the Thai Tea cocktail that comes in a small bottle that I got 3 servings out of. Everything was great. Cons: The bathrooms are single-style, down a crowded hallway. If someone is in there you are stuck pressing against the wall while people come through. Although, the service took away the one star. The hostesses were great and our waiter was knowledgeable. The restaurant was completely filled, and the location of our table was kind of hidden. So, we felt like the waiter wasn't as attentive as could have been... our table was probably looked over. Thankfully they have separate staff running the food, so it didn't delay the appetizers or main course... more the drink refills, water refills, and bill.

I asked our waitress about it, and she didn't say anything because they were about to leave by that point. It's so disrespectful of families to have out of control children in this kind of setting, and it's the responsibility of the restaurant staff to stand up for other patrons. This family was loud, and the kids were way too old to behave this way.

The space is split into two sections, bar side with lots of light and restaurant side with booths and much softer lighting.   We both ended up ordering the Chef's lunch which consists of your choice of soup of the day or salad and a choice of pizza. I decided upon the salad and fennel sausage, onion and gorgonzola pizza.   The salad consisted of little gem lettuce, it feels and tastes like a butter lettuce and looks like romaine  lettuce, roasted tomatoes and a house dressing. The salad was crisp and fresh with dressing on every surface of the lettuce, yet it wasn't too soggy or overwhelming. It was simple and delicious! The pizza was piping hot and a great alternative to Chicago deep dish. All three toppings stood out. The gorgonzola really mellows out in the wood-fired oven. I was worried it would be overwhelming. The crust was thin, light and chewy.  I eat a fair amount of food and was thoroughly full after 3 slices. I  also had a slice of my friends margherita pizza and it was equally tasty. I ordered a Moscow mule which was fantastic!   Overall, great pizza, service and location. I'll definitely be back!!",0.9881,0.82,0.17,0.01,0.5776190476190476

The second time, I purposely locked everything up tight before I pulled-up and handed them the keys. When I got the car home, nothing was missing, but I could not help but notice they had unlocked the glove box and the center console. I mean, that's just stupidity.

2015-01-01,2.0,"I would have given this place three stars, if it weren't for how incongruously expensive our bill was compared to the mediocre quality of the meal. I cannot make an exception for the fact that it was New Year's Eve. For a $75 per person Prix Fixe Menu, a restaurant should have it right.  The beginning was relatively innocuous with a bottle of Nebiolo d'Alba Ochetti and duck confit arrincinis, which were actually quite good. The restaurant had another saving grace in its service, as our waiter and his supports staff were very polite and diligent. However, next came a shared beet salad that was okay and only filled a meager bread plate. Then the shared pizza, which I assume was meant to be a  Neapolitan-style, thin crust pizza. It tasted like Digiorno's or Amy's frozen pizza, which I wouldn't mind if I was scrounging for something to eat at home and didn't feel like cooking. The crust had that thick, doughy texture, instead of that Neapolitan floury, crispy but still soft texture. And, anyone who knows pizza can tell you that the crust is a huge part of what makes any great pizza. But, the entrees and the ""dessert"" were the most insulting.  My girlfriend ordered the scallops and I ordered the wild boar bolognese. Bolognese of any kind is one of my favorite Italian dishes of all time. I have eaten it in several amazing places and have made it, as well. And, I especially am fond of wild boar bolognese. Therefore, I regret to inform those reading this review that the wild boar bolognese was an ABOMINATION. The meat was ground, overcooked to dryness, and tasted like it came from Taco Bell. The bolognese was watery, tangy, and generally foul tasting as if it were made in a high school cafeteria or out of a bottle. Admittedly, scallops are difficult to cook. If over-cooked for even a minute, they will become balls of rubber. However, these tasted undercooked and bizarre as if they had been previously over frozen and tasted gooey in the middle. My girlfriend later felt nauseous right after dinner.  I returned the bolognese of which the waiter seemed to be very understanding. I opted for the steak dish instead, which was recommended medium-rare. It came to me medium to medium-well. Kind of tasted like Salisbury steak, but it was edible. However, the final slap in the face came from the ""desert"" and the manager's attempt to save face with a free glass of very awful Cabernet. First, the dessert was just a bite size cube of chocolate. Nothing says, ""thanks for your patronage, now go die"" like being told desert was included in a $75 Prixe Fixe menu and then getting a meager bite-sized morsel. As far as the free glass of wine was concerned, the manager offered Casillero de Diablo which I used to buy in college for $8 a bottle before I knew anything about what good wine tastes like. It tastes like fruity, death by head ache in a bottle.  All thing considered, the service is great, but the food is very mediocre and over-priced. We definitely will not go back, and I highly recommend avoiding this place.",0.9954,0.777,0.163,0.061,0.5845466797353589

I was somewhat surprised since peppers weren't on the menu, but since that was the only real flavor component I guess I was more thankful than anything.

2014-12-10,4.0,"This is my friend's absolute favorite pizza place in Chicago and I was glad to get a meal here on my short visit! La Madia's definitely got a cool, sleek vibe. The lighting is dim and you feel like this could easily be turned into a happening lounge late at night with its modern, tasteful decor and a bar area that looks like the place to hang out. Yet you the kitchen is pretty visible, mostly out in the open, separated from the tables by a low counter. I had a full view of the pizza oven.  Our reservation was for 5:30pm on a Monday night, which was unnecessary as only a few other tables had customers. We had a very professional, responsive, and efficient server, and overall had a great dinner here. PIZZA * Parma Classic (red. arugula, prosciutto di parma. $19) - 4.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… The best pizza of the night in my opinion! I tend to like reds so I may be biased, but even for a red I thought the prosciutto was sharp and complemented the arugula and fresh tomato sauce really well. Their crust is thin and soft with a crisp, though not quite as fresh-out-of-the-oven as I'd prefer. The outer crust could've done with being a little more stretchy when I pulled it apart, but this is me being picky on a 4.5 star pizza! * Wild Mushroom (white. smoked mozzarella. $16) - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… Not a huge fan of white pizzas, and not a big lover of mushrooms, so this wasn't a winner for me flavor-wise. But it was well made and I will say the mushroom wasn't too overpowering and had a fairly well-balanced flavor. Overall I found it a bit bland though. * Moroccan Spiced Lamb Sausage (white. mint pesto. $17) - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… This was my pizza and it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped! The sausage wasn't very spicy, and its texture was a little chewy, reminiscent of chain-restaurant delivery pizza.  ENTRÉES * Tagliatelle (foie gras meatballs. $14 half) - 3.5 stars pic:  yelp.com/biz_photos/la-m… This was exciting for me because foie gras isn't allowed in my home city of SF anymore. I couldn't really taste the foie gras to my disappointment though - if I hadn't been told what this was, I would have thought it was just regular meatballs. The tagliatelle was not as wide as I've had at other restaurants, but had a texture that was balanced between being soft and al dente. I found the sauce to be a little plain, and rather watery.

After an hour and 15 minutes we called the  delivery.com  number and received little help. They stated they are using a 'new delivery partner' and have had some issues with delivery times. She was completely unhelpful and had no idea who I should call to provide feedback...I mean wouldn't anyone want to know if their customer received such poor service? AND paid a $7 delivery fee on top of the tip... Then the pizzas arrived...cold greasy and just not good. I'm assuming of we had been in the restaurant it would have been better...but the 1.5 hr delivery time killed it. Grease was the prominent taste...   We will never order from here again, especially as long as they use their current delivery service.",-0.8938,0.847,0.047,0.106,0.572465034965035

It is a standby for visitors, and has never let us down. The dough has the unique quality of being simultaneously tender and chewy. I've never been to Naples to have pizza, but until I go, La Madia can be my stand-in measure of top-notch pizza crust. The flavor combinations in both the red and white pizzas are great - some particular stand outs are the taleggio and roasted grape, fresno chile and clams, and the margarita. In addition to the pizzas, the salads are well constructed and a great addition to share. Sit at the kitchen bar, where you can watch pizzas going into the wood burning oven.

My last visit this past Saturday night, I brought my friend who was visiting from London and jonseing for some hometown pizza.  And while La Madia's pizza isn't exactly what we would consider classic thin crust Chicago pizza, I took her here because it is close to my apartment and I've had good experiences in the past. Undoubtedly because of our arrival time (11:30p), we received a fairly cold reception from the guy who ""greeted"" (for lack of a better word) us at the door and who also became our server.  Never smiled, no interaction, and frankly behaved as if we ruined his whole evening by showing up.  He maintained this attitude throughout our visit.  (Maybe early 20s, dark hair in kind of a faux hawk style, in case management actually reads these reviews).

Even if you don't come for an event, and if it's a small group or date night...you will NOT be disappointed with your experience. Put it down. Let's start with the private event coordinator, Julie. She is the most professional, friendly, efficient, event coordinator extraordinaire! And she made planning (for my boo) so incredibly easy and smooth. From what he told me, she was quick to respond to emails and answered all his questions and made all the requested accommodations as best as she could. She deserves most of the credit for this beautiful experience (and maybe a little credit should go to my boo. Good job, honey!) We pre-ordered dishes from the menu for the party and we had dinner family style. This was a genius idea, since we all love to try a variety of dishes, and this way, we were able to try all of the delicious dishes that La Madia is known for. I have to say, all the food that we ordered were phenomenal. I can't wait to go back and dine, again! For starters, we enjoyed the Steamed PEI Mussels, cooked with melted leeks, fresh fennel, garlic, and white wine Brodo. OMG, we all wanted to drink the soup! We had the Beet Salad as well as the Romaine Lettuce Salad. Both were refreshing and delicious. I highly recommend them both! If you had to only pick one, though, I would probably go for the Romaine Lettuce again. I've listed the pizzas in order of most to least favorite, but I just have to add this disclaimer that ALL of them were really really delicious! Slagel Farm Wood Smoked Pork Belly (Tuscan kale, garlic, caramelized onion, caciocavallo cheese), Seasonal Wild Mushrooms (smoked mozzarella), Parma Classic (Mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, prosciutto di parma, arugula), and Clam & Fresno Chilies (Pecorino, garlic and fresh thyme). I think some of them are a tie...I don't know. They were all delicious in their own way!!~ I was too full to try the Tagliatelle and Shrimp risotto...but everyone agreed that it was delicious as well.

2014-07-30,5.0,"Yup, I still love this place. The pizzas here are thin but not as thin as places like Eataly or Spacca Napoli so the middle of the pie isn't soggy. They're baked in a wood-burning oven but don't have too much char which I like because sometimes too much char tastes like you're eating ashes. The crust is tender and chewy so you don't see people throwing away the pizza bones like at some pizza places. They offer a nice selection of red and white pizzas so there's something for everyone. They have traditional and simple options but also more unique, complex pizzas.  My favorites from dinner last weekend:  Housemade lamb sausage, mint pesto, and fresno chilies.  Pork belly, kale, caramelized onions, and garlic.  Carbonara with guanciale, leeks, and eggs.  Everyone raves about the pepperoni pizza with truffle oil. This was good, but I liked the above mentioned pies more.  We also shared the mussels appetizer. The mussels weren't the largest, but what they lacked in size, they made up for with flavor. The generous serving arrived in a le creuset pot filled with a delicious broth made from leeks, fennel, white wine, and garlic. The thick cut toasted bread that accompanied the mussels was perfect to sop up the extra broth. I would order this again.  Another reason I like La Madia is because they always have one red and one white wine of the week. $6 gets you a 5oz pour.  The room is conversation friendly, and the tables aren't crowded together.

2014-07-03,4.0,"The ""Luncheon for Two"", which includes a share salad, pizza and Wisconsin Electric cookies is steal for $19.  You will have to add $2 if you choose anything starred on the lunch menu.  Nevertheless, this definitely is a great deal given the area of the city you're in.  Dining out in the River North area can get quite pricey. In fact, my fiance and I spent more money on our drinks with lunch than we did on our little luncheon (and we paid the additional $2 for it too).  *shrugs*  Priorities, I guess.  Plus, he wanted wine and I wasn't about to leave him drinking alone! For lunch, we shared the organic mixed greens salad, cracked organic egg pizza with prosciutto and black pepper.  The salad came with cucumber, crimini, tomato and herb vinaigrette. The salad was just OK and definitely not something to write home about.  It had an overall bitter taste to it since it had frisee on it.  Also, I guess I'm just used to eating salads with more on them so this felt a little too plain for me.  I wish my fiance and I would have sprung for a more adventurous salad choice. The pizza was fantastic!  Sometimes, it's good to change it up from the deep, cheesy deep dish that's part of Chicago's claim to fame.  I really liked that it was a white pizza.  Let's be real here.  You eat pizza for its cheesy yummy goodness not that sauce.  The addition of the salty prosciutto worked really well with the egg.  My only gripe was that you'd essentially pull off the entire strip of prosciutto when you took a bit of it.  The way it was arranged didn't give you enough meat for every bite.  Nonetheless, delicious pizza and I'd definitely eat it again. The Wisconsin Electric cookies were the perfect end to the meal.  They are butter cookies topped with candied lemon rinds and powdered sugar.  They were also served warm.  My only gripe was that I wish they were either larger or that they served you more of them.  I could have downed handfuls and wanted more. As for the beverages, they do a great job selecting a wine to go along with your pizza if you are into wine.  My fiance tried the one that paired with our pizza (a pinot noir) and he enjoyed it.  As for me, I tried the Crimson Crush cocktail (Citros Vodka, Pomegranate Juice, Fresh Lemon Sour, Muddled Mint Leaves, Gomme Syrup, Soda Water).  It was very delicious and is perfect for a hot, summer day.  It was a tad too strong for me, but I am such a lightweight. Our server was polite and friendly though she didn't check up on us that often.  We were given a carafe for water so there was no need for her to come back with refills.  The ambiance is modern and chic yet warm and inviting with dark wood tables and green and white accents. I'd definitely come back for lunch.  The price is right.  They even offer an $8 valet so you don't get gauged parking your car in a garage.  And, it was pretty dead on Saturday afternoon around 12:30.  Everyone must have been dining at more brunch type places.  That was a win for me since I was actually able to converse with my fiance.

2014-07-01,4.0,"Stop if you're a tourist looking for deep dish pizza.  The thin crust Neapolitan pizza is its polar opposite.  But if you're looking for accommodating host or waitress and good, decently priced food, then this is the place.  Plus, it doesn't seem to be that frequented by tourists, so if you want to go where the locals go, this seems to be such a place. We had been seated and given menus.  When our waitress saw our somewhat crestfallen faces, and I explained that we had hoped to try some authentic Chicago deep dish pizza, she was more interested in our happiness then us eating something there and not being happy - and so made recommendations on where to go have some.  But having walked about a mile in the sauna-like weather, we decided to go with her appetizer recommendation and have a salad.  Then, if we felt energetic enough, we'd go for the deep dish. But then the spinach and taleggio fondue (with a drizzle of truffle oil) came with its big (assumedly housemade) puffy bread accompaniment.  Wow!  Delicioso!  And the HUGE butter lettuce salad (palm heart, radish, almonds, and lemon chili dressing) we shared also won a big thumbs up from hubby.  (He pronounced it not salad-y.)  I thought it was a bit on the bland side and that it could have used a teensy bit more dressing, but liked the flavor combinations (and was scheming to figure out to make it at home). Well, after this, we felt, ""hey, we can still say we had Chicago pizza,"" so we went ahead and ordered the goat cheese, a white pizza with leeks, garlic, and pancetta.  Quite tasty; the combination seemed pretty perfect, with the pancetta adding a bit of color.  Plus, we got to use up the rest of the fondue as we dipped our crusts (and sometimes whole pieces of pizza).  Since we didn't have a fridge at the hotel, we ate the whole thing.  Which, fortunately or unfortunately, killed our ability to enjoy dessert, which looked also inviting. The ambiance was relaxed and was honestly anything one wanted it to be.  Close to where we were in the booth were two couples and an extremely well-behaved and charming toddler.  A few couples.  Two friends.  The noise level was actually not the general roar that we had encountered at other near-packed establishments.  And the decor was modern with lime green accents; quite pleasing to the eye.

But among my friends, it is regarded as being a really good spot for girls' nights, business meals, and dates alike. I really love coming here with girlfriends for vino and pizza that is a little fancier than Malnati's or other Chicago favorites, but delicious nonetheless.  The wine list is really great - I actually haven't tried any on there that I didn't love. The appetizers are really good - especially love the Pizza Fondue that I tried for the first time last night - a bubble of pizza dough to dip in cheesy red sauce.  Usually when I go with friends, we split a salad and a couple of pizzas. One that they are known for, the Tallegio and Three Hour Roasted Grape Pizza, may sound odd but it's such a delicious marriage of salty and sweet that you will understand why it's one of their signature items. Also can't go wrong with the standard margherita but I have tried and loved the Spinach and goat cheese, the kale and pork belly, and a number of the other awesome pizzas.  Bottomline, they have really delicious and creative ingredients that they put atop their chewy amazing crust and I don't think any of the pizzas could turn out bad. They also have some semi-private rooms incase you are interested in planning an event here, which I'm sure party guests would go crazy for! I definitely keep it in mind for parties and such. But even if you just want a fun night out with friends, this place is really fun (and usually not too hard to get in- but recommend a reservation anyway)",0.9989,0.641,0.327,0.032,0.5671957671957673

2014-06-18,3.0,"Coming out of the restaurant, I felt like this was more of a three star experience. It might be because I TOTALLY built up La Madia in my head more than I probably should have. I left the experience without much to say about it, though. I DO want to try it again...because I love the idea of La Madia so much. The ambiance here is really nice. The waitstaff is welcoming and very happy to make suggestions. My boyfriend and I took the suggestion and got one red pizza and one white (even though when I eat Italian style pizza, I think you should go white all the way). We ordered the triple pepperoni and the taleggio and grape pizzas as well as some wine to slurp it all down with.  We really enjoyed the wine and (odd as it is to note) we liked the wine glasses it was served in (we got both red and white). When the pizza came out, I was a bit underwhelmed. The taleggio and grape was tasty, but after a couple bites in, the cheese started to feel kind of hard and not as fresh as I had hoped. We really enjoyed the triple pepperoni pizza, but there was a quality to the crust that made it taste more like a delivery pizza than others I've had at similarly styled restaurants. We were kind of bummed. Overall, for the price range of the restaurant, I thought the ambiance and service were just right. The food, however, just wasn't that good. I want to try it again, to see if maybe this was a fluke. I might not get the wine next time, though, because the bathrooms are single stall. I think that's a poor choice for a restaurant that serves alcohol, but it is what it is. Be prepared to wait for the bathroom if you need to go.",0.8919,0.861,0.096,0.044,0.4118923611111111

My lunch partner did not think it was worth the price for such a ""little"" pizza (he polished off his whole pizza and drink and it cost over $23 w/o tip) and made me stop into another pizza place that sold the hugest, greasiest pizza slice I'd ever seen for $4.95 a slice on the way back to work...  Bottom line, I would come back to this place. Decor was clean and modern, it's dead-ish on a regular work day for lunch, and I did like what I got.

2014-03-26,4.0,This place really has mastered thin crust pizza in a deep dish town.  I came here on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is pretty casual but upbeat. There were four of us. We started off with the beet salad and the chopped Italian salad. I really liked the beet salad. I'm usually not a huge fan of beets but La Madia has it down. The Italian chopped salad is great too.  We then ordered Spinach & Taleggio Fondue with white truffle oil. The green color of the dipping sauce made me a little apprehensive at first.... but it was fantastic. Our waitress advised us to save the left over sauce we had for our pizza. Great advice. Everyone was a fan of the spinach and telegio sauce. So good.  We ordered the triple pepperoni pizza with white truffle oil and a margarita pizza. I personally liked the margarita pizza better than the triple peperoni. I felt as though the crust of the pepperoni pizza got soggy because all of the grease. That's understandable though. I also felt like the only thing I tasted was the peperoni. If you are a huge fun of peperoni this is most likely the pizza you should choose.  Also they have a wine pairing with each of their pizzas which is pretty interesting as well.

The restaurant is casual and stylish, and it's nice to see an affordable but trendy place in the area.  It's a relief from the expensive River North scene! We started with a bottle of wine - they have a pretty big list and denote which ones are organic/sustainable.  Lots of Italian wines.  Several under $40 but don't think I saw any under $30.  Then we shared the beet salad, which was very beautiful with both red and golden beets.  It was delicious and fresh, with nice dabs of goat cheese amongst the dark greens.  Definitely share a salad before you move on to pizzas! Pizzas are 12 inches and divided into 8 small slices each.  We got 2, the Triple Pepperoni and the Lamb Sausage with mint pesto.  The former was a red pizza, the latter was a white pizza, and the menu is divided to specify which is which.  The pepperoni pizza was great although a bit greasy.  Lots of meat which was crispy around the edges.  You could smell the truffle oil as soon as they put it down.  The lamb sausage was also delicious and creative, the mint pesto added a really nice touch.  Pizzas are served with red pepper flakes and parmesan alongside.  The crust was appealingly crisp.  So nice to have a thin crust pizza in a deep-dish town!  This was the perfect amount of food for four girls and we really enjoyed everything.

Get a coke or 2 and you've got a tasty and quality multi-part sit-down meal for under 30 bucks between 2 people ... you can't beat that!

2014-02-03,4.0,"The menu at La Madia in River North has a great selection of starters and salads, pastas and mains, but the highlight here are the pizzas (with the caveat that I actually haven't had the pasta or entrees here, but should plan on making a trek just for those).  As you walk in, you can instantly smell the aroma given off by the wood-fired oven in back, and walking by tables, one can spot dishes that focus on extremely fresh ingredients.  The pizzas are split into ""red"" pizzas topped with tomato sauce, and ""white"" pizzas that focus on the ingredients only.   My date opted for one of the reds, the housemade fennel sausage with sweet onions and mozzarella.  The pizzas at La Madia keep the dough simple and thin, cooked with a perfect wood-fired char on the crust but a nice doughy consistency on the inside.  The sausage was flavorful and the remainder of the ingredients balanced out the pie nicely.  The sausage itself lacked a bit of spice, but that was easily corrected by adding a bit of crushed red pepper.   To contrast, I went with one of the whites - the cracked organic egg, prosciutto, and black pepper pizza. Thankfully, mine was cooked with a bit more char on the crust (I prefer mine with a nice crisp - Sara enjoys a bit more chewiness).  Surprisingly the egg emparted a deep flavor to the dish to replace the usual presence of cheese, and it offset the saltiness of the prosciutto nicely.  Sprinkled with some black pepper to add just the right amount of kick, this may be one of my go-to pies in a pinch.  My only complaint was the full size pieces of prosciutto made it difficult to avoid grabbing the whole piece of prosciutto in your first bite of a slice - I would definitely suggest to cut the meat into slightly smaller pieces to disperse it a bit.   Overall, La Madia focuses on traditional, fresh Italian ingredients and is up to par with the top thin-crust, wood fired pizza joints in the city (Piece and Coalfire immediately come to mind).  With the Honey Butter Fried Chicken pizza on the menu at Piece, we'll probably be making a trek up to Bucktown in the near future to compare, but you can't go wrong if you're looking for pie in the River North area.   pics up at my blog:  eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.9912,0.818,0.137,0.046,0.5196560846560845

It is a solid 4 star establishment and it deserves them. However, the service forces me to give it a 3 star review.  * Asked the server for a recommendation but what I got in return was a dull and uninformative recitation of the menu which I had right in front of me.. A little more enthusiasm would've been nice but, not the end of the world.  * Ordered the crostata because the server actually gave me a more in-depth explanation of it voluntarily, which turned out to be a good choice because as he brought it out to the table, the smell of it alone screamed delicious. But for some reason, the server simply put the dessert down on the table and walked away without so much as ""here's your dessert"" or ""enjoy."" Not a single word. Perhaps he was a bit overwhelmed at the moment, not a big deal.    * 15 min or so later, we were half way done with our dessert and there was clearly half of it left on the plate. My partner and I were trying to take our time, enjoy the dessert and  we intended on actually finishing the dessert that we ordered, and the server came by and asked if we were done, and before we could say no, his hands were already reaching for the plate.. There was a short moment of silence/awkwardness, and the server proceeded to brazenly ask us if we were also ready for the check. At which point, we both felt very unwelcome at the very last minute of our meal, and wanted to leave.  That last part really did it for me and my partner. If we were the last table in his section and we were keeping him there around closing time, I would've understood, but it was around 9pm and he clearly had other tables at the time. It was just confusing and uncalled for, and left us wondering why from a restaurant of that caliber.

I am glad I found this restaurant. They just won a regular.   Thanks so much Ana and Peter. You guys ROCK!!!!!",0.9939,0.802,0.183,0.015,0.5372086247086246

The place has trendy light fixtures and booths but also gives an Italian family diner vibe.  We were talked into a bottle of wine (which wasn't hard) and enjoyed it. We had the special pizza of the day and the triple pepperoni pizza and both were fabulous. The best part about the night - our waiter... I really wish I would have grabbed his name! He paid attention to the fact that we haven't seen each other in ages and he checked in enough (but not too much) which I've experienced at other places. He even overheard that it was my birthday and brought a dessert - and my friends hadn't even told him! What a great gesture. I'll be back again. It's a solid bet for families, couples and close friends as its not too loud and there's a nice wine list. They also dimmed the lights periodically as the night went on which set a nice tone.

It was thin but it had the perfect amount of tomato sauce, mozzarella cheese, and white truffle oil. Perfect for two!  The gnocchi with house-made sausage was paired with spinach and tomatoes in a white sauce. The gnocchi was crafted in-house. They were small, soft, and chewy.     The chocolate polenta cake with vanilla bean gelato was freshly baked. The cake was rich and warm. It was moist with a pleasantly crumbly and grainy texture.

We started with an arugula/apple/walnut salad that was tasty and nicely put together (although the arugula was not at its peak of freshness). There's an appealing array of pizzas, both red and white. Our server characterized the Roman pizza crust as thin, but not crisp; in our view, it was quite similar to Neopolitan pizza we've had at Spacca Napoli recently. Whatever -- it was very good, both in texture and flavor. We chose a lamb sausage white pizza, lightly dosed with fresno peppers -- delicious, not too salty, pleasant mild heat from the peppers.

2013-09-15,4.0,"I am teetering on whether to give them 4 or 5 stars, so if this were a 10 star system, I'd give them a solid 9.   This is my first time there despite my intentions to get there months ago.  I'm sorry I waited so long.  So far, this is literally some of the very finest pizza I've ever had. I qualify it because I've only had one pizza, and I think I should try a few more before giving it an absolute rating.   I had the Triple Pepperoni Pizza.  I honestly had no idea what to order since all the pizzas looked so so good.  So to decide I simply asked what the server what was the most popular and he said it was this one without hesitation.  It did not disappoint. The pizza had pepperoni on every inch of the pizza without overpowering the other flavors of the pizza, including the truffle oil.  I was skeptical about putting truffle oil on a pepperoni pizza because of this.  The chef-owner shows his European training by knowing how to combine flavors subtly and proportionately.  The result is that I tasted great pepperoni which combined with the incredible flavor of truffle oil.  So good! The crust was perfect. A fire oven makes a crust that complements and doesn't take over the pizza.   Because my date wasn't drinking I felt it inappropriate to drink in her presence so I had some very refreshing, fresh Lemon-Pommegranite Lemonade.  It was served beautifully and tasted wonderful, not too sweet. It complemented the pizza.  My one complaint, $5 for an 8oz juice?  Really guys? REALLY?????  Seriously?  It was a rip off of the highest calibre.   The ambience is fantastic.  It is hip, cosmopolitan, fun, serious without being formal.  It's a fantastic place to enjoy a pizza.   Now, if you wonder why I don't complain about the price of the pizzas, they may or may not be overpriced, I don't know.  Nothing pisses me off more than people who THINK they know what something should cost and when it doesn't they complain it is overpriced.  Ugh!  Morons!  I know these guys use fresh ingredients, truffle oil is EXPENSIVE, fresh basil is EXPENSIVE, good meats, pepperoni, prosciutto are expensive!  So to pay $17 for the pizza I had may have been reasonable. The service was barely adequate, but nothing to be too worried about.   Patronize this place.  There's a definite difference between chef-owned restaurants and the rest.  The passion for food shows.",0.9842,0.823,0.131,0.047,0.5965029761904761

2013-06-30,4.0,"Literally my last meal out before I drove out east was at a long time staple of the River North scene that for some reason had always evaded me. Perhaps that's my fault for always seeking out the new without spending as much time on the staples. Either way I was thrilled to try it out before leaving and having friends Kate and Jon show me the way with one of their neighborhood favs. The other awesome aspect of going with friends that know the place is that I could sit back and relax while they did the ordering. And they chose well.  We started with a grilled artichoke, that had some delicious seasonings and dipping sauces. Artichokes have always been a standard feature of any summer dinner growing up. My mother loves to make them simply steamed so any comparison to childhood memories are hard to make but La Madia does a nice job - a good way to wet the palette. The main course was pizza. All kinds of pizza that I didn't choose, but ate too much of. I don't remember the specifics or which one I like most because they were all delicious. I think one was a pepperoni and truffle oil, one had goat cheese and bacon and I know the last one was tasty with hot peppers. They come out fresh and hot, super thin cust authentic style and ready to go. Even though they have a solid take-out business, these are not pizza's I can see doing too well away from the over and transport over long distances. Even by the end of our meal I noticed that they cool off fast, and the thin crust can lose its firmness with the tasty oils and cheese doing their work. So just eat good and fast! We finished off the night, after over eating pizza, with a surprisingly amazing little dish of chocolate polenta cake. Never would have thought of that but it tastes great. Must try. Aside from having a very good pizza oven and a nice wine selection - I think the most understated aspect of La Madia that makes it successful is the ability to truly make it an every night, neighborhood restaurant. It's family friendly, inviting, broad options of other Italian items on the menu, and affordable - easily a place you could call home, or come by yourself, etc. Not sure how I made it living in Chicago without ever trying La Madia, but better late than never, and now I know where to go for good thin crust pizza when I visit!",0.9986,0.757,0.229,0.014,0.5647335398805988

My husband have enjoyed a lot of great food here over several trips.  Everything we've eaten has been terrific.  It's not cheap, but that simply reflects a very typical dining experience in River North.  I give it five stars primarily based on the quality of the food, but the servers I've had here have always been well informed and attentive. Warm olive appetizer:  so simple yet terrific.  Assorted olives delicately tossed with a few delicious spices.  You'll never want to eat cold olives again.   Artichoke appetizer:  good, but messy and a lot of work.  But that's a function of the labor-intensive nature of artichokes, I suppose. The pizza fondue is the one thing I've eaten here that I wouldn't recommend.  It's just a huge hunk of bread with tomato dipping sauce.  Completely superfluous if you intend to order pizza.   The salads we've eaten here are tremendous.  The chefs clearly pay close attention to detail.  The chopped italian lettuces salad is my favorite:  a nice combination of bitter and non-bitter lettuce, complemented by some pears and gorgonzola.  I've tried to reproduce this at home, but remain unsuccessful.  The arugula salad is likewise delicious (a great combination of roasted grapes, arugula, nuts, and cheese).  On days I've been more virtuous, I've added chicken to one of these salads to enjoy as my main course. My favorite pizzas are two white pizzas:  the burrata and the wild mushroom.  I always ask for a side of marinara sauce, though, in which to dip pieces of the pizza.  The wild mushroom pizza does have a rather smoky flavor, which might not be for everyone.   One small suggestion:  if you have leftover pizza, your server will pack it up in a small box that requires him/her to stack the pizza slices on top of one another.  On occasion, I've had servers who've packed the (still somewhat warm) slices so that the cheese on one slice is directly pressing against the cheese on another slice.  This makes leftovers far less appealing, since you have to disentangle one slice from another.  Now, I always try to remember to ask the servers to use some wax paper in between each slice.  I hope that's now common practice here. To my knowledge, there's also only one women's and one men's restroom.  I've frequently observed a small line outside each.  The food makes this small inconvenience all worth it, though.",0.9959,0.783,0.169,0.048,0.5801269841269839

As tables opened up he let us know how long we could expect, and when it was close to the 30 minutes told us we were next. We ordered a sausage & onion pizza, bruschetta, and wine. All was great!

Margherita - You already know this is good. Housemade sausage, onions - Again, please read my previous review. Taleggio and 3 hour roasted grapes - Wow... I would've never thought to put grapes on a pie.  The sweetness of the grapes balances out the bite of the tallegio making this a delicious pie to enjoy.  Very nice combination, unlikely as it would be. Carbonara - I was very curious to see how they would make this one.  Seeing that I've been making a lot of pies lately, learning how to crack an egg onto the pizza to create such a lush, velvety feeling of egg yolk combined with the chew and crisp of guanicale... I knew this could turn out terrible or wonderful.  I""m glad it was the latter.  If you're like me and like mixing your egg yolk into different dishes (over easy eggs on sandwiches, in rice, in pasta, etc.)  this is right up your alley.  Two over easy eggs on top cracked on midway through the cook, and finished from the heat of the pizza, then carefully cut so that the yolk covers a bit of every slice... man, this was soo good. Verdict:  While the dough doesn't have the rise I""d expect of Neapolitan (which to be fair they don't necessarily claim they are, but closely imitate), their traditional pies are enjoyable.  It's their perfect execution of some of the more innovative flavor profiles that make them stand out and gain the extra star since my last visit, paired with our superb service at lunch.

2013-04-24,3.0,"So, a recent dining experience at La Madia really made me reconsider my previous five-star review.  For lunch, I have been mostly pleased as punch. I'd say half the time, we have fantastic service, and half the time we don't. The deal they have, however, is good enough to put up with the not-good service at times. For dinner? Not so much. My parents were in town and I was entrusted with making the dinner reservation for us to celebrate their anniversary. Honestly? It was not good. Despite having a reservation, they tried to seat us at the first table when you walk in the door. You know, that table that is left open for people that don't make reservations? The one that gets the cold air from the front door and the people bumping into them? I'm not a diva, but I wasn't going to let that fly. They were able to accommodate with another table (with minimal grumbling), so I thought we were fine. Not so much. Our server was absent for much of our meal. We had probably six different people attending to our table that did not return if we requested something. We requested ice for our sparkling water (never received it), parmesan/red peppers for our pizza (never received it). When my husband and mother wanted another glass of wine, they had to physically flag down our server. It was kind of embarrassing for me, as I had made the reservation thinking my parents would really enjoy it. The triple pepperoni pizza (the best, in our opinion) was good, but tasted as if it had been sitting there for a bit. It wasn't fresh. The pork belly pizza, on the other hand, was not very good. I liked the cheese on it, but that was about it. The crust was soggy, and the entire pizza tasted entirely of carmelized onions. Just....no. Not good. While this entire experience for dinner was really disappointing, I suppose I would come back for lunch. And they do have fantastic wines by the glass (I've never been wrong with their Wine of the Week). I just likely won't be back for dinner.",0.99,0.826,0.138,0.036,0.5105027401539028

While the food is great, I can't see myself ever going back if they have a staff which is unable to be cordial.  A little professional development might go a long way. I personally don't think we would have had the same type of service if we had gotten there at 7, but coming from someone who has worked in the industry, there is no excuse for that kind of behavior.  While you are on shift, you are expected to uphold a standard which I felt we did not receive.",0.442,0.886,0.063,0.051,0.4656746031746031

Once she brought back our drinks, she asked if we were ready to order.  We weren't because we were taking our time and enjoying ourselves.  She didn't really seem to like this.  We ended up placing an app order anyway just to appease her.  ""Ok, have you decided on anything else?""  was the response to our app order.  Lady if we did we would've told you!  Once she brought the app to our table, she asked again (not trying to hide her annoyance of us that hard) if we decided on anything else.  Still wanting to take our time but seeing she wasn't having it, we begrudgingly told her we wanted a salad.  As for the app, we ordered the spinach and tallegio fondue.  It was AMAZING.  The bread was delicious and even though the fondue was a little runny for my taste, the flavors were ridiculously wonderful together.  For the salad, we ordered the one with fingerling potatoes, pancetta,egg, and other stuff I can't recall.  This was also a home run.  Hands down phenomenal.   For our main dish we ordered the pizza with red sauce, prosciutto, arugula.  The presentation of the pizza was nice minus the fact that half of the pizza was burnt on the crust (like BLACK) and the other half wasn't.  We've had wood fire roasted pizza before and understand that sometimes it might get a little dark on one side vs the other, etc., but this was just black.  We dug in anyway.  Similar to the bread from the app, the crust was delicious.  Soft and yummy.  The prosciutto however was disappointing.  Low quality and just not worth it.  I ended up eating around it.   Once we were finished with our pizza, the waitress came and asked if we wanted dessert.  We did and ended up ordering some chocolate polenta cake.  Before the dessert even arrived, our waitress came up and left our bill - already closed out - on our table.  This is unacceptable.  You wait until everything is served and then ASK if there is anything else you can get your customers.  What if we wanted more dessert?  More wine?  More anything?  It was clear that she wanted to close up all her tables and get out of there.   As for the dessert, it was uneventful.  Apparently it was cooked in the oven in some sort of a clay dish.  How do I know this you ask?  Well I burned my hand on it after trying to move the dish.  Thanks for the heads up, waitress.  You could've told me the dish was hot as all get out.  Ugh. Let it be noted at no point during our dinner did she ever ask how anything was, if we enjoyed our meal, etc.  It was the really poor service that did it for me.   That and the wine, while good, was a little pricey.   I don't think I'll be rushing back.  If you're in the neighborhood I guess it is an ok spot in comparison to what else River North has to offer.  But I wouldn't recommend anyone go running here.",0.9853,0.828,0.107,0.064,0.5002418250299607

We were dining almost 3 hours, which we did not intend on doing.   Overall, the food is was delicious and would probably be the only thing worth coming back for, but to have a wonderful experience from start to end, service is key.  This is where it failed.  The host staff were pleasant in providing us status updates of our seating time, food was great, but Whitney could have done better with a more pleasant attitude.  She attempted to rebound and make our meal experience better by having our desserts come out right away and take our valet ticket so we wouldn't have to pay more than the standard 3 hours, but too little too late.  Regardless of what situation or environment you're in, I expect to be treated they way I want to be treated, it's a simple request.",0.9932,0.832,0.128,0.039,0.46344011544011543

An appetizer, salad, pizza and dessert.  Our table opted for two of each of the fondues for the appetizer portion of the meal. They were both delicious. The pizza fondue had an almost vodka sauce like component to it, it was definitely not your average pizza sauce! The spinach and cheese fondue was literally out of this world, it was so yummy I wanted to drink it. Additionally the portion sizes were enormous. Something I definitely hope to go back for.  For the salads we all opted for the romaine salad with creamy mustard dressing. A bit boring but no one could say no to creamy mustard dressing and crispy pancetta with shaved Parmesan. Our lack of creativity in ordering this course paid off because we all loved the salads and couldn't get enough. For our pizzas we ordered the cheese, sausage, pork belly and artichoke. I tried all but the cheese and they were delicious.  Unfortunately by the time the pizzas came we were all quite full and couldn't eat much. I was a big fan of the pork belly pizza but really enjoyed all of them. Helpful hint: if you order the fondue as an appetizer keep whatever is left over for dipping your pizza in!  When it came time for dessert three of us ordered the crostada and one orders the gelato. All were good but lots was left over because we were so stuffed!  While the food is outstanding I also cannot go without mentioning the ambiance and service. The place has a trendy but intimate vibe to it. I think it would be a great place to go on a date for dinner or drinks. The bar is also very nice. With that said it is also a good place for a girls night out, especially because of the large portion sizes and ability to share.  The service was fine but not exceptional. We were slightly peeved when a server took my dining companions boxed up leftovers and threw them out when we were not looking. We asked about them and were given a fresh pizza but had to wait an additional ten minutes for it, fine but still a bit annoying. I also didn't love our server.

I got the pizza fondue. The tallegio cheese was so smooth it was only perceptible as a cream and the flavor for the fondue came from a pesto like mixture. The pizza bread coming with it was immense. I loved every bite and felt I was full enough to leave after just the appetizer.  I'm not a salad man but liked my chopped Italian lettuce. It had arugula, walnuts and delicious roasted grapes. These grapes made the salad; I've never had anything like them. Warm, sweet and tender. Pizza are the specialty and highlight here as a group we got every pizza offered. The pork belly ended up being the most flavorful. Both the dough and meat tasted smoked and came with cheese still boiling when served. Recommended.",0.9836,0.841,0.153,0.005,0.5529411764705883
2013-02-03,5.0,"I look forward to Chicago Restaurant Week almost as much as I look forward to summer vacation when teaching.  It's the one period of time during the year when all bets are off and I can indulge without much guilt - with consideration to the prix-fixe menu prices. And as a suburbanite who only ventures to the city on the weekends, I select my spots carefully to get the most bang for my buck. La Madia's $33/person four-course dinner was well worth it for me and I would certainly return without that special. My husband and I met up with two married friends from out of town last night who had just happened to experience Ann Arbor, Mich.'s Restaurant Week last weekend. As self-proclaimed foodies these people were looking to be impressed, so I had hoped I made the right decision with going to La Madia. Right from the get-go when ordering a bottle of wine to share, my gal pal in the couple was happy to see a huge selection with some affordable bottles in her preferred year of 2008. As for the food, I'm going to have to do a quick-hit list of highlights because of how much we tasted from each other's choices in our two-and-half-hour long feast: Starters- *Spinach and Taleggio Fondue with Truffle Oil and Pizza Bread: When this came out, it looked like a ginormous calzone next to a pot of creamy pesto. To our surprise, when we ripped open the bread, it was crisp on the outside and light, fluffy and empty on the inside, with steam emitting as if it was just baked. It was like dipping pita bread or naan into the pot of melted herby cheese. *Seasonal Wild Mushrooms Bruschette with Whipped Ricotta and Marsala Glaze: This was more of a small bite portion. It was the perfect match of sweet and savory. Salad-  All of these seemed to be decent size portions with bright veggies. *I LOVED my Heirloom Beets Salad. The beets were ultra fresh and juicy, pairing well with crunchy almonds and smooth, creamy goat cheese. Entree- The stars of the show are obviously the pizzas we had. Among the Triple Pepperoni, Smoked Porkbelly and the Summer Squash, I absolutely adored the Triple P. *The thin crust was super light with flavorful tomato sauce and just the right amount of cheese (I hate when there's too much cheese). But the rich and spicy thin-sliced meat on top with a drizzle of (more!) truffle oil is really the combo of ingredients that set this pizza apart from the others. Desserts- *Bittersweet Chocolate Tortino- Very dark chocolate cake (a bit dry but still packed a punch of rich flavor) with slivers of almonds on top and a creamy ganache center paired well with the other dessert choice I liked... *Gelato of the Moment- This happened to be Chianti (perfect for our wine-loving friends). Not as rich as I thought it would be - more like fruity ice cream, but still refreshing on the palate so I'm glad I got it. Overall, I would definitely return to try other items on the menu. This spot is a hip, modern pizzeria with solid, consistent service despite how crazy busy it got through the night. (I'm talking every table occupied with about 15 people waiting around in the bar and hostess stand area.) So definitely make an Open Table reservation when going during the weekend. I'm sure it's busy regardless of Restaurant Week!",0.9957,0.855,0.133,0.013,0.531489197530864
2013-01-27,4.0,"Excellent thin crust pizza for those of us who don't love deep dish. I came here with friends to celebrate my birthday and we had a great time. I wasn't crazy about the ""pizza fondue"" appetizer that many people commented on... it's just breadsticks with pizza sauce to dip in (it was delicious, just not as exciting as the name implies). It's not that they in any way hide it, they tell you exactly what to expect in the item description, I was just blinded by all the glowing Yelp reviews and ended up being a tad disappointed. BUT! Every pizza we got was fantastic, and we probably ended up ordering most of them because we were such a large party. Because the crust is very thin (like paper thin), some of the guys had trouble filling up on just pizza, so in retrospect we should have ordered some other things as well. I definitely want to come back on a date night.

Upon arrival, the pizza bar was literally just 10 tables bar-style in front of the kitchen.

We got mixed greens salad (very fresh), a red pizza with a spicy pepperoni sausage banana peppers and onions, a white pizza with pork belly kale and carmelized onions, and a italian sausage gnocchi.  All the flavors of everything were really great and fresh. The gnocchi surprisingly came with a super tasty pork broth so it was deeeelish.

They comped us for the two late pizzas; even so, considering my wife's entree and the fact that we ordered her dessert because our dinners came so late, I spent upwards of $60 for basically a miserable experience. On our way out, no one apologized or said anything to us.  There are better choices in the Near North area.

It's a little on the expensive side but not so nice that we felt our 10 month old daughter was unwelcome at 7pm on a Thursday night.  The service was excellent. We were well taken care of and timing was near perfect.  They did something magical to the warm olives. Not only were they extremely warm - definitely the hottest olives I've ever had, they were a little spicy and extra delicious. For your $6, you get quite a lot. Also, the olive oil served with the bread is out of this world. We tried a couple pizzas, one with red sauce, no cheese, banana peppers, and Fresno peppers. We hadn't heard of Fresno peppers but won't soon forget. Amazing. I branched and got the Taggalio (?) and 3-hour roasted grape pizza. Whoa. The best pizza I've ever had. I ate the entire thing. By myself. In one sitting. I don't even regret it, except that now I won't be able to enjoy it again tomorrow as leftovers.  My glass of wine was unremarkable but good. There are some 75 available by the glass, either 4 or 7 oz.  If I had unlimited budget and stomach space, there isn't much on the menu I wouldn't love to try and subsequently salivate over.

Admittedly, there is sometimes a River North-y vibe here--loud groups of twenty-something white women dressed to the nines, people who are there to be seen--these people are serious about Italian-style pizza. I recommend sitting at the pizza bar, where you can see the cooks work--and you get a free glass of prosecco to boot. For two people, we usually order a salad to share and two pizzas, which gives us at least a meal's worth of leftovers to take home. The Italian lettuces and arugula salads are both very well thought out and have a pleasing mix of flavors. Pizza wise, I recommend the simple tomato sauce-fresh mozz-basil pizza, as well as Tallegio and grape and also the heirloom tomato pizza. My partner, who's not vegetarian, has sampled widely from the menu and hasn't found anything he doesn't like. In my opinion, one of the best things about these pizzas is that the flavors are so well balanced. A lot of times, that means that the toppings are less plentiful than at an American-style pizza place. Less really is more.  In any event, get something with 3-hour roasted grapes. You won't regret it. Other pros of this place: they take reservations via Open Table, and the valet parking is reasonably priced.

First time ordered a couple of excellent thin crust pizzas and ate in the bar because the dining room was full. Second time made a reservation and had the ravioli (also excellent).

We came for lunch and ordered the $31 Lazy Luncheon special which comes with two glasses of wine, a shared salad, and a pizza. We thought it might be a cheap house wine but were surprised to be served a quality Chianti. The chopped Italian lettuce salad was delicious and came in a nice light dressing with candied walnuts. Our server recommended the Triple Pepperoni pizza which was drizzled with a generous portion of white truffle oil and tasted amazing. The servers were attentive and knowledgeable about wine pairing options. The prices are very reasonable considering the quality of the food and top notch service we received.

Despite coming in 30 minutes before closing, we received wonderful service, despite a minor miscommunication on my wine order. Highly recommend the pesto truffle sauce and pizza bread. Yes, the pizza bread is dough that's doused in EVOO and topped with sea salt, that you then proceed to dip into a fantastically rich sauce. and yes you will probably be eating pizza here, but if you're on a diet, you probably shouldn't be eating pizza anyways ;)!

2012-07-20,4.0,"Dined at La Madia last night for my birthday. It was our first visit there. We had a fantastic experience and will definitely return!  Food: We started with the Spinach & Taleggio Fondue appetizer. I was not expecting what we received, but it was totally unique and completely delicious. You are given an entire pizza crust which is nicely charred and puffy alongside a ""green sauce"" of spinach, cheese and truffle oil. Next, we split a pizza with half heirloom tomato and pesto and half artichoke and cheese. Pizza was tasty, but honestly not the best I've had (that honor goes to Quartino). The next course was the Chicken, Ricotta and Spinach Ravioli served in Brown Butter Sauce. This dish was crazy. Probably one of the best ravioli dishes I've tasted. The spinach was cooked perfectly and the raviolis were very hearty and earthy tasting. Delicious. For dessert, we shared blood orange sorbet with prosecco. This was delicious and a very unique dish as well. Service: Our server was excellent and made us feel comfortable and not rushed at all. I hate being rushed through a meal and prefer a slow, course by course meal, which is what we received. The host was also very accommodating and offered us great service.  Vibe: The restaurant is a very modern, sexy space. I can see myself coming back for drinks at the bar for sure. Tables are nicely spaced so you do not feel crammed. The atmosphere is a bit loud, but if you're able to snag a booth or table by the window, you will have no problem hearing.  Very good experience!",0.9951,0.705,0.224,0.071,0.630870870870871

The chef came out and talked about each course.  I was impressed with the care he puts into the details.  The pizza dough is kneaded in a two step process, pasta is made in-house and the menu changes seasonally to make the most of local ingredients.  Oh, and he's a big wino, he said there are 300 types of wine, and many available by the glass!  There's a rotating wine of the month (red and white)that are $6/glass. It's impossible to rate everything in order of yumminess, I have to break it down by course.  All are great unless otherwise noted: -Bruschette - 1. Wild Mushrooms, Marsala and Ricotta (one of my fave dishes of the night), 2. Creamed Ceci Bean (like the best hummus you've ever had), 3. Mozzarella di Bufala, Roasted Cherry Tomatoes, Balsamic (good, but blown away the the two above) -Fondue - 1. Spinach & Taleggia with While Truffle Oil (OMG, the ""green sauce"", as we called it, blew the Pizza Fondue (#2) out of the water).  2. Pizza Fondue tasted like tomato sauce, nothing special. -Salad - both the Arugla and Beet Salads were good, but standard. -Pizza - 1. Tripple Pepperoni with White Truffle Oil (normally I don't go with pepperoni because it's pretty boring, but the white truffle oil elevated this to an amazing dish!) 2. Housemade Lamb Sausage with Mint Salsa Verde (this was a very close second, the lamb was delicious and the mint was refreshing) 3. Heirloom Tomato with Arugula and Ricotta (this was very good, but the other two were so good, I didn't go back for seconds on this) -Pasta - we had the Chicken Spinach & Ricotta with Brown Butter Sauce - good but not super hot.  We were so stuffed by this point, though, we let half the ravioli go to waste :( -Dessert - Bittersweet Chocolate Tortino - I would usually rather have an extra app than dessert, but this was amazing chocolate cake.  Rich but not too heavy.  Yum!

Service: we had a reservation for a Friday night, but there was definitely a wait for those who didn't. It seems like a popular place with plenty of people hanging out at the bar, and the host was very friendly while our table was set up, keeping us updated on the situation. Our waiter was great, letting us know that we could do a half-half pizza when we realized how large they were, and warning us about the acidity of some wines when we displayed a clear lack of knowledge.  Ambience: This place is both 1) bigger and 2) louder than I expected. There's a whole other room off to the side of the initial one, and it's definitely a good kind of loud, not the ""screaming to your friends and give up talking"" kind of loud. I didn't feel bad laughing out loud, for example, unlike some restaurants *shoots looks across town* Food/Wine: Oh man. The fennel sausage was AMAZING. Perfect blend of flavors, cheese, sauce, and thin crust. Our eggplant was also good and would have stood on its own, but the eggplant was pretty thinly sliced and didn't always cover a piece evenly. (I'm glad we tried it, but I probably wouldn't get it again.) I've always loved thin crust pizza but hate when it gets too dry or flaky;  La Madia avoided both of these and gave me the best thin crust I've ever had.  Wine: You know it's a crazy wine list when you have to refer to them by 3-digit numbers. I was happy with the Syrah blend that we got, even if I can't remember what it was, and the prices for it are fantastic, at least to my big city senses.

2012-06-24,5.0,"Giordano's, you have some competition for my love. When I first moved to Chicago from Brooklyn, I was flabbergasted that anyone would try to say that their pizza was better than Brooklyn pizza. Then I had Giordano's and my world was never the same and I then understood the meaning of an addiction. Recently, a friend's suggestion to meet for dinner at La Madia upset that dynamic again. La Madia is on like a light! We, four of us, started with a pizza bread fondue that was worthy of an encored. The marinara sauce was perfect for sopping and the bread reminded me of Indian bhatura bread but without having been fried. Just all about love. We had a pizza with grapes on it. Being pescatarian, I am open to anything that panders to my vegetarian palate, but a grape pizza sounded a bit too exotic. After we had polished every slice, it was clear that I could wrap my mind around such a pizza and my finger around slices accordingly. The pepperoni pizza with truffle sauce, but minus the pepperoni, was next and I was again reminded of Brooklyn pizza. Granted truffle sauce is not common on Brooklyn pizza, I folded the slices that I had and smiled as I gnashed away on the slices that I had. Complete satisfaction. Can't say that I will chance going to any other specialty pizza cafes because I don't want to fall out of love with pizzas. La Madia raised the bar for pizza in Chicago. Anything that gives Giordano's a run for its money is stiff competition. Take it from a Brooklynite who appreciates pizza.",0.9912,0.833,0.156,0.011,0.46969696969696967

The beet salad was pretty standard, which is to say enjoyable even if not interesting. I also ordered a Not So Old Fashioned cocktail, which turned out to be not so interesting.  Shrug.

My bestie and I had planned on visiting the very popular Purple Pig this particular Monday evening, but alas no reservations equals no seating for 2.5 hours. Yes, you heard me right--it was a Monday. I'll have to save the Purple Pig for another time, but La Madia was another option within quick walking distance.  We were starving, so you could imagine my happiness to walk in and be seated immediately. Yes! No chaos, no over-hyping, just great pizzas, salads, apps and vibe. To start we both ordered Prosecco and the roasted artichokes. I was surprised to see two, big 'chokes come out! Typically in big cities you pay big buck for teeny portions, but not here! I got right down to ripping, dipping and scrapping the tender leaves with my teeth. They served these treats with a oil-based dip, a creamy aioli-like dip and wedges of lemon. Perfection.  After much deliberation, we decided to share a salad and a pizza--a great choice. The salad was a three romaine chop-like mix with walnuts, gorgonzola and a mustard dressing. It was just OK. I couldn't really taste the dressing (at all), but the salad was wet like it was covered in something--I'm assuming it was oil. The pizza was very good! Chewy, thin crust, just how I like it and covered with a marinara, prosciutto, arugula and big parmesan shavings. I've add similar, better pies in Cleveland, but it was still delish.

It's easily my favorite pizza in the city (deep dish excluded).  We also share a salad as well, usually the one with the organic arugula and the grapes. They also have a great wine menu if you want that as well. But for a week night it's the perfect spot to split a salad and a small pizza with your significant other or a date and not get drained in the wallet.  It can be done for under $35 with tip and you leave feeling full and satisfied.  I would and have sent many people here and they all love it!!!",0.9918,0.717,0.276,0.007,0.5806471306471307

2012-02-11,4.0,"""The Cupboard"" - Google Translate, on Italian setting We wanted to try something new (to us) in the River North area and found La Madia. Gourmet pizza sounded appealing at the time so why not? La Madia is very cozy and cute - their seats are Paul Smith (check out their website!) We decided to go for an appetizer, a salad, a red sauce and a white sauce pizza, and a shared dessert. - Our appetizer was the Pizza Fondue, which was steaming hot bread with tomato sauce on the side. It was good - though it was hard to taste the cheese in the advertised ""cheesy sauce."" - The Nichols Farm Heirloom Beets salad was excellent; I didn't knew about different, lighter beets (I thought they were tomatoes). Portion is reasonable, and the beets are sweet and delicious. Add the almonds and the goat cheese, and it's a great all-around salad. - Red sauce pizza: the Housemade Fennel Sausage & Sweet Onions was pretty good, somewhat normal-tasting pizza because of the standard tomato sauce + cheese + sausage combination. We got what we ordered, and it was a nice contrast to the white sauce pizza. - White sauce pizza: the Taleggio and 3-Hour Roasted Grapes basically was taleggio cheese on a thin crust with raisins. I prefer red sauce, but this was nice to try. Plus, how easy it is to talk about the background of 3-hour grapes. - Dessert: the Caramel Apple & Sweet Cream Crostata, Caramel Gelato was a last minute decision which was basically a crispy incarnation of apple pie topped with ice cream. It was pretty good but nothing extraordinary. A nice touch to the end of a meal. We had a great time at La Madia's - I later heard that their mussels are amazing in case seafood is up your alley.

2012-02-08,4.0,"We finally tried La Madia last Saturday for the first time and really enjoyed ourselves.  The food is good, the wine list incredible, and the Staff is unbelievable!!!  We made a last minute reservation on Open Table for 4.  I called the restaurant about 30 minutes before to see if we could add 2 more to the the table and even though they were booked up they were very nice in accomodating us which is not common in Chicago.   We arrived a few minutes late and half our group was missing but the staff was so polite and seated us when we requested it so we could order a bottle of wine. Our friends ended up being a half hour late and we never received one comment from the staff.  The manager came by shortly after we were seated and politely asked if they could move us to a booth as we were at a table that could expand to seat more people and we ended up with only 4.  We were happy to move to a booth (I love booths!) and he offered us complementary drinks. We started by ordering a bottle of wine.  Their wine list is HUGE... two full long pages with so many options and organized nicely!  We had a hard time choosing so our server offered to let us try a couple.  We tried the red wine of the week which was a nice shiraz (priced at $25/bottle) and a pinot ($42/bottle).  Surprisingly, we thought the wine of the week was much nicer, very smooth, a little dry, not too fruity.  I'm not sure what the usual price is but it was a great value. As for the food, the host recommended we try the pizza dough fondue as an appetizer, and it was amazing!  They serve you a large flat bread crust (lightly salted) with a side of warm tomato dipping sauce which is SO delicious due to all of the cheese and cream... definitely not healthy but tastes amazing!  We had one red and one white pizza.  The red with Prosciutto was very good, just the right amount of sauce, cheese and meat and the crust was nice and crunchy.  We also tried the white Taleggio and 3-Hour Roasted Grapes.  It was good, but a little sweet and heavier with the rich cheese and white sauce.  Next time I want to try the red pizza with Buratta cheese & Fire Roasted Eggplant, unfortunately they were all out, so we'll have to go back.  We also split a salad with our group, the chopped italian lettuces, and it was really good plus plenty for 4.   We were so full at the end of the meal but the desserts all looked so tempting so we ordered a few to share.  We had the blood orange sorbet, blackberry gillato, and an apple pie/crisp... they were all soo good!!  We devoured every last bite! We had a delicious meal, excellent service, and thoroughly enjoyed the ambiance.  We will definitely be coming back and I can't wait to try more of their food.  Plus they have a late night special (after 9pm) for two, $20 for a pizza, salad, and cookies, or $30 with wine for each person.  Sounds like a good deal to me! The reason for 4 stars???  They were sold out of the eggplant pizza!  And there were not a lot of veggie options for pizzas (mushroom, eggplant, or tomato).  I would love to see a pizza with all kinds of veggies, rather than just one!",0.9992,0.764,0.214,0.022,0.5101617063492064

We walked in & they had this cozy little corner in front with a fire place, but we opted for a booth instead. The decor was nice, modern & inviting. Our waiter was very attentive but a little hard to understand because he did talk a bit fast but since I speak a bit fast too I translated for my friends. The manager was really nice too, it was my birthday & he came over to wish me happy birthday.  Pizzas are 12"" and thin crust. We ordered one white pizza (the Seasonal Wild Mushrooms & Smoked Mozzarella) & one red pizza (the La Quercia Coppa Piccante with Fire Roasted Sweet Banana Pepper & Onions). Both pizzas were good, but the white one was my favorite. It was just the right amount of mushroom to cheese ratio. The red pizza was spicy (which we wanted) & the sauce was quite good, but I just didn't like it as much as the white pizza. At the end of the meal they brought out their Electric Butter Cookies with a candle on the plate for my birthday which was really very sweet of them. The cookies were also delicious, the electric part is that they are topped with some sugary lemon zests. They also had a large wine list with lots of good options. I liked that you can choose from getting a smaller glass (4oz) or a larger glass (6oz) plus they have a 'wine of the week' where they choose one red & one white which they sell for $5 a glass.

Thin-crust is my favorite type, and it's done very well at La Madia. Regarding the starters, the Pizza Fondue was a let down. In fact, all seven of us at the table agreed that there's nothing about it that even resembles fondue: there's no skewers, no pot, and no flame. But other than that, it was just like fondue.  The other lackluster appetizer is the Oven-Roasted Globe Artichokes. Unlike the fondue, it's not false advertising. Like the fondue, it's nothing special. Most importantly, all four of the pizzas we ordered were excellent. In the end, that's the number one and deciding factor.

Interior had a good feel, waiter was very nice, and had good recommendations.  Went with a couple of the more talked about Yelp reviewed items, which were also waiter picks.  Started with the mushroom bruschetta and it was awesome.  It had a creamy type of cheese lightly melted under the mushrooms which was a perfect balance.  We ordered 2 pizzas and the Shrimp Risotto.  I really like the Triple Pepperoni and Shrimp Risotto.  The pizza is thin crust which I like being from STL.  Great flavor, and and it was bigger than I thought it would be.  We also got the Lamb Sausage pizza and I found that to be a little on the too spicy side. Very good but the heat lingered a little too much for my liking. They had a nice wine menu.  We didn't really like the $40 bottle that much (not their fault) so we ordered a $60 bottle that was much better for bottle number 2.  I recommend the Terra Valentine (sic).  I really enjoyed that cab and had never had it before.  I think they are one of the main sponsors of Top Chef.

2012-01-15,4.0,"Came here for my cousin and my dual birthday celebration, per recommendations from some friends. However, the pizzas were good, they just didn't blow me away.  OVERALL  I can't help but compare this place to places like Pizzetta221 in SF or Pizza Antica in San Jose. Definitely not as good as those two places, which was a disappointment.  Nevertheless, for thin crust artisan pizza in Chicago, this is probably one of the better places. The FOOD 1. The steamed PEI Mussels with melted leeks, fresh fennel, and garlic were an amazingly delicious and good size appetizer for two. Very worth the $13.  Each Pizza can feed two people. But we decided to try one white sauce and one red sauce pizza to get to taste more of a variety.  2. For the red pizza, we ordered the Parma Classic with mozzarella cheese, tomato sauce, topped with prosciutto and arugula. It was flavorful but a little flat and one dimensional. $16 3. For the white pizza, we ordered the Cracked Organic Egg with prosciutto and black pepper. Again, I've had better cracked egg pizzas. I wish there was a little bit of green in this pizza to give it more depth. $16 Overall, La Madia had a very classy and ""girls night out"" type of ambiance, and there is creativity in the topping choices, but each pizza seemed a little one dimensional to me. I think La Madia can spend some time looking into new flavor combinations and changing their menu up a little.  But until Chicago has more options for authentic thin crust artisan pizza, I would continue to come back whenever I find myself craving pizza that's not deep dish!",0.9922,0.821,0.159,0.02,0.4139256198347108

This is a classy restaurant in the River North area and I love their thin crust pizza with new and creative ingredients. This is affordable compared to most of the restaurants in the area, and it had different types of crowd to ""romantic night out"", ""first date"", ""girl's night"" to ""dinner with the family"". Everyone here seems to be enjoying themselves and the service is pretty good too.  The Food: Starters: Pizza Fondue | Cheesy Tomato Sauce & Pizza Bread  for 8 dollars.

2011-12-17,3.0,"Every November we celebrate our committee's hard work by having our meeting at a downtown hotel the week before Thanksgiving and taking them out for a nice dinner out. We are usually a group of 25 (or so) and our past venues have included Sullivan's, Amano, Prosecco, Quartino's and now La Madia.  I will start by saying the service I received was wonderful. Emily the private dining coordinator was pleasant to work with and made everything a breeze for our party of 28. My only criticism was the lack of follow-up after our event as I did have a few comments I would have liked to have passed along but I suppose that is what Yelp is for, no? The restaurant is rather loud. While we did request a private space the only space available for our rather large group was the ""stage area"". It still in the main dining area so if you are considering this space, keep it mind that it will still be loud making it difficult for your guests to converse. The service was a little spotty. It seemed like it took a little longer than usual to get and receive our drink orders. At the end of the year, we sometimes really like to toss a few back and CELEBRATE but the drinks were not rolling in fast enough to achieve this....a shame since we purchased a bar package.  The food was pretty solid. We enjoyed the variety that was brought to our table. The dining & bar packages they have are extremely affordable. Bread and oil is brought out to every table and they will bring you more if you ask. We we're brought out some apps of carpacio, warm nicoise olives and bruschetta. Warm olives? A revelation! A couple of salads followed the appetizers - an arugula and a beet salad. I love beets so it's usually always a win/win for me.  Starter courses were followed by three types of pizza. Two reds - fennel sausage & onion and margarhita and one white - shaved artichoke. They were all quite tasty. Entrees were up next - tagliatelle americano a chicken milanese. Both of these dishes were tasty enough but nothing you'd go ""ZOMG"" over. Of course we finished up with dessert - a chocolate bomb sort of thing and crostino w/vanilla ice cream. Both satisfied.   The total for the food and 2 hour bar package was around $65 per person. See what I mean about being affordable? La Madia is totally doable on a budget. I just wish this place had not been so loud and that the dining service had been a little more attentive. I do not think that the food was totally comparable to the other venues we had tried in the past but I definitely would not hesitate to come back on my own for a slice (or five) of their homemade 'za, some warm olives and a couple glasses of vino if in the area.

The apple slices and walnuts weren't so memorable. Shaved asparagus and burrata pizza: This was delicious. I would have liked some more asparagus, but still the mild flavor wasn't overwhelmed by the cheese. Nice thin crust, crisp on the edges.

The peperoni red pie is fantastic, and I get gravid cravings for their mushroom/ricotta bruschetta. Dining in is usually a fun experience, and can get pretty damn busy in the evenings. For whatever reason, this place attracts groups of 30-something urbanettes like pedophiles to Bieber concert. So gentlemen ... there's that. Carryout, I tried for the first time this week, and is the reason for my NEGATIVE review. Normally, I can count a single bad service experience against an overall worthy culinary establishment, but there has been a systematic pattern of shitty service. Not from everyone, and on the whole, people seem nice. But it's there, and it's noticeable.  (Also, the pizza came out about 25 minutes after the salad and bruschetta were prepared. Not good. I was told 20 minutes for pickup. By the time we left, it had been 50 minutes after I initially called) It's as if some staff are trying to act ""New York"", when in reality no one in New York actually act that way (Caveat: unless you yourself are acting like a raging asshole). In particular, a taller brunette (with ponytail) server, who was unbelievable rude to my girlfriend as she picked up our dinner. On a slow evening. Without going into details, she was a bitch. When I went in to talk to someone, the very sweet hostesses explained to me that she was in fact, a bitch, and that others have complained about her in the past. She is""sassy"", apparently. When I asked why she was still around, it was reported that she was a good server. Go figure. Anywho, I can't respect an owner who knowingly allows a server to be selectively rude to people, only because she's very good at getting drunk gentleman to spend lots of money. And maybe she has great tits and a sweet ass, but alas, all good things fade in time. At least the server can still have a career at a suburban strip club, where her unique talents can continue to serve her; the owner, however, will only be left with a reputation for rude service",-0.5884,0.718,0.141,0.141,0.49649395743145747

2011-07-05,5.0,"I couldn't be happier with my meal here for July 2011 gurrrl's night!   It is elegant but not overly so, the service was attentive but not in your face, the food was simple but so delicious.   Here is what we ordered to share between the three of us: Starter:  Mushroom Bruschetta (fresh, seasonal mushrooms, toasty bread, so much better than traditional tomato bruschetta) Pizza:     White, Local Shaved Asparagus, Italia Burrata, Garlic (The crust is perfectly crisp and chewy, the cheese perfectly melted, the asparagus present but not over-powering) Main:     Seared Sea Scallops, Creamy Polenta, Brussels Sprout Leaves & Brown Butter - Truffle Vinaigrette (This was a party in my mouth!  Important to note: I typically HATE scallops but try them any chance I get because so many people I know and love enjoy these babies. Well, this was my night to discover the joy of a perfectly cooked scallop paired with a declious, creamy polenta - all my previous scallop experiences have been erased - they were a case of poor preparation. La Madia does it proper!) Desserts:  Seasonal Crostata & Vanilla Gelato (warm, flaky pastry, cool ice cream, hard to go wrong) Blood Orange Ice in Prosecco (cool, refreshing, interesting flavor combo with the prosecco - perfect on a hot summer night) We also tried 3 of their specialty cocktails but I am unable to remember them in great detail.  My 2 favorites were a cucumber based cocktail and a St. Germaine based cocktail. The cucumber was light, refreshing with a hint of ginger.  The St. Germaine was a little on the sweet side, but a nice combo of fruit and sweet flavors.  This place would be great for a date or a large group of people.  The pricing for the quality is unbeatable and the location is prime.  If you haven't stopped in here yet, put it on your list now!",0.9983,0.696,0.267,0.037,0.6177154195011336
2011-06-30,5.0,"This place is amazing. Wonderful wine selection, where you have the option to order a 4 oz, 7 oz or a bottle. Even though we both prefer red, we prefer different types, so I started out with the 7 oz of Tempronilla wine, which was smooth with a spicy kick, one of my favorite wines I've had. Then I wanted something a bit more spicier so ordered a glass of Malbec, which delivered. My friend stuck with the Cab, which he enjoyed. Everything looked good on the menu, but we skipped the salad and apps to leave room for dessert. We started out with the margherita pizza, the crust was perfect, not too thin nor too thick. The ingrediand were fresh and the sauce was tasty. I don't have a sweet tooth so I opted for the 3 cheeses, which were served with honey, almonds and preserves and were really fresh. My friend ordered the chocolate tortino and was savoring every bite, but still allowed me a small taste, and it was decadent. The restaurant looks small from the outside, but there are quite a few tables and it is an intimate setting. There are a few tables outdoors and it was not too crowded for a Monday night so we were able to get seated right away.

2011-06-26,3.0,"La Madiaaaaaaa! Hmmm. AOK.  One of the most affordable ""nice"" dinners downtown (truly)...you can feel all fancy, drink some pretty nice wine, be downtown near all the expensive action, and not break the bank. With multiple glasses of wine and full bellies: $40/pp. (including tip!)  It's been almost 2 years since I've visited La Madia for Yelp Eats Week 2009 where I first experienced ""pizza fondue,"" but it's always been top of mind for casual dinner downtown. When we needed a table for 7 on a Friday night in the area, bingo! Let's do it. That pizza fondue, though simple, is pretty attractive and it remained solid in my memory.  Unfortunately on this trip, I didn't stick with the tried and true. I ventured out into a $24 plate of scallops and polenta, and for all intents and purposes....was lackluster at best. Overdone scallops drowning in polenta that was tepid. Not impressive. I ate it, but I did not enjoy it. Had I been eating pizza that night, my life would've been better. Surely the wine and salads were great (despite them bringing only one instead of two salads, and us having to adjust to get another one to the table).  The service was fine. It wasn't overly masterful, but it works and it can be expected at this price point. La Madia is a great place to share, so coming with a group is fun. They also accommodate large groups very well! She let us split on credit cards (I know, I know, a pain) and was sweet about the million wine glasses floating around.  For pizza and wine and salad? Great. For special entrees? Not so much. I'd stick with your gut and go with the basics here. You'll still get a great value... *Great for out of towners staying downtown, large groups, first dates and girls dinners.

I was given a glass of something that tasted like Manishevitz.  The arugula salad was delicious, as were the artichokes, but our pizza was chewy, as if they had forgotten to bake it all the way through. The heirloom tomatoes were divine, but mozzarella in the caprese was the consistency of old rubber.  I'm pretty sure our server was on summer break and would have rather been on the beach, even though it was raining, for all the attention she paid us.

It's taken me over a year to eat at La Madia again and I had a pleasant time.  La Madia has a great wine list. Everything else (the food, the ambiance, the staff) are ok. Nothing overwhelmed me as being incredible, but nothing was really bad either. We decided to have the ""Luncheon for Two"" with the addition of an appetizer and some gelato for dessert.  The Appetizer: Bresaola, Shaved Fennel, Sweet Peppers, Parmesan. It was good. I like fennel and sweet peppers. It was nice and refreshing with a little squirt of lemon. It was good, but also kind of meh.  Luncheon For Two (A Signature Salad, A Pizza, and ""Wisconsin Electric"" Cookies):  Salad - Organic Arugula, 3-Hour Roasted Grapes, Local Apple, Spicy Walnuts, Shaved Parmesan & Walnut Vinaigrette. This was ok. How do you roast a grape for 3 hours?? Do you use an Easy Bake Oven? The arugula wasn't very ""peppery"", which might have helped the flavor of this salad. It was kind of bland.  Pizza - Housemade Lamb Sausage, Fresno Peppers, Caciocavallo Cheese & Mint Salsa Verde. I liked this pizza a lot! However, the mint salsa verde didn't taste very minty. It was more basil/pesto-y. The lamb was delicious and the peppers were nice and spicy. Yum!  ""Wisconsin Electric"" Cookies - Apparently these are cookies that the owner's mom, who worked for Wisconsin Electric, used to take to her company picnics. Wow, that's quite a stretch for a cookie name. I thought they might have cheese in them, but no. They're the lemon and pine nut cookies, which were better than the last time I had them, but still...meh.  Dessert: Strawberry Gelato. Was this gelato?? It was creamy like ice cream.  Not complaining, though. It was delicious!  So, there you go.  Three stars seems too low and four stars seems too high. They've improved for me, but I won't be rushing back to La Madia anytime soon.  Three and a half stars is about right, but our waiter (Cutie-pie Ben) made it a four star experience.",0.9971,0.77,0.2,0.03,0.6359727891156464

My fiance, however, is more of a beer type, and they were accommodating to his tastes as well.

Delicious pizza bread dipped in tomatoey, cheesy, gralicy sauce...BRILLANT!  As for the salad course, I went with the organic arugula which was good (and probably large enough for a meal for some). For the main course, the shaved artichoke, homemade fennel sausage & sweet onion, and margherita pizzas were my three favorites out of the multiple types we ordered. Overall I am a pretty big fan of pizza and have tried MANY different types, but La Madia really stuck out in my mind as having truly unique and original pizza.

We got the pizza fondue, which is pizza dough fresh from the oven and marinara sauce, which tastes a lot like a vodka marinara sauce from the store. don't get me wrong though, it's good. The bruschetta appetizer selections, especially the one with mushrooms and whipped ricotta sounded amazing. For pizza, it was REALLY difficult to narrow it down because everything looked delish. We settled on the pork belly, kale and caramelized onion pizza and it was really tasty. The crust was thin and crispy but not overdone and the kale, onion, pork belly combo was delish. I wish the toppings were a little more evenly distributed to blend the flavors together but it was not a deal breaker. Depending how hungry you are, you can definitely split a pizza or get your own and have PLENTY of leftovers.

2011-02-27,2.0,"All right. So, as I have mentioned, I hate waiting for a table, especially when I bothered to make a reservation.  And as a lady of advancing age, my tolerance is low for 1) gaggles of straight ladies who are clearly interested in a scene and being seen (as evidenced by their designer jeans and flatironed hair) instead of eating, 2) middle aged suburbanites who are overly excited about being at a trendy place, or 3) did I mention I hate to wait when I have a reservation? Yes, all of the above is about the fact the La Madia is trendy and crowded and has NOTHING to do with the food and a whole lot to do with how I get crabby when I am made to wait.  I had a long time to observe this because of the tale of woe I am about to tell...If you don't like stories about bad service or crowds, you might skip to the bottom. We get there at 7:30, our reservation time.  The hostess lets us know that there might be a wait and asks if we would we like to go to the bar and have a drink?  We oblige.  There is seating in the bar.  My pinot noir is delicious.  We observe the scene described above. Thirty minutes later, we ask the hostess (on her way through to seat someone else) what the story is.  She snippily replies that it ""might be a long wait"".  We order more wine. The manager comes over ten minutes later.  He apologizes and says he will send over some free appetizers for our wait.  He says that Restaurant Week is almost over (forgot about that) and that he's sorry.  Ok, La Madia, classy apology. Thirty minutes after THAT, our free appetizers arrive.  A tinfoil packet of warm olives and two slices of bruschetta.  I hate to be a bitch about these things, but if you're made to wait (now going on) an hour and thirty minutes for an hors d'oeuvre, as a manager wouldn't you choose something more substantial for three people than a few pieces of bread and some olives?  Maybe it's just me, but it seemed insulting.  Yes, I am being a bitch now.  Did I mention it was an hour and a half?  I have low blood sugar issues. Anyway, once we got our pizza, it was great.  The pizza was delicious, the ingredients were inventive and the woodfiring was just perfect.  We spent a bit of time marveling about how hard it is to achieve woodfired pizza perfection and how this was just right in terms of carmelization.  Yum.  The pepperoni with tuffle oil was just amazing and the smoked mozzarella and wild mushrooms was perfect. However, I am not sure I can forgive La Madia for the bad service (snippy hostess looked angrily at our table every time she passed, wine guy unceremoniously dumped carafes of wine into glasses with surly attitude), the wait, or the mobs of twenty-somethings trying to look cool.  I hear it's better on weeknights, so maybe MAYBE we will try it then.",0.9647,0.784,0.124,0.092,0.5910396825396826

Started by ordering a couple bottles of wine for the table, and wanted a little help from our server, but he didn't know much about the admittedly extensive wine list. Still, I appreciated that he didn't just try to sell the priciest bottles.  Food-wise, several people ordered pasta and a few of us ordered 2 salads and 2 pizzas to share. Also the pizza fondue (skip this standard marinara dip and just get a pizza to share if you're looking for a pizza-like appetizer). The salad was good, and the pizzas were decent - I liked the white pizza with artichokes a lot, but it got cold really quickly. The margarita pizza was fine but nothing to write home about (but then again, it was the plainest pizza on the menu, so what did I expect). I didn't try any pasta, but a couple of the girls who had it said the portions were too small even for a girly appetite. It also took a really long time to be served - and this is coming from a girl who likes to take her time between courses and not be hurried along. But again, it was a busy Saturday night and a large table, so... take it with a grain of salt.

They have a very simple menu - mostly pizzas, a few entrees and salad/appetizer options.  Nothing fancy but the ingredients are always very fresh and top quality. I remember having a very simple salad with normal ingredients like carrots and etc, and was very surprised how fresh and refreshing it tasted.  They simply know how to bring out the best in the most basic ingredients.  I highly recommend the wild mushrooms pizza (even meat-lover guys will love this one) and braised short ribs - very reasonable price for the quality of the food.  The extensive wine list is also very impressive.  Simply put - if you can't make amazing pizza and access to amazing and reasonably priced wine immediately at home - this is the place to go, just like the owner promises.   The atmosphere is warm, casual, stylishly simple.  I love how what can be a very awkward long, rectangular space can be transformed into different seating arrangement areas with little nooks.  I love the front bar area with lounge type of seating, all the banquetts, the oval tables for 4-5, love the private dining room and even the chef's counter in the back.  They all offer different experiences.

Anyone not paying attention to the menu would dismiss it as simply being a pepperoni pie with bonus sea o' grease. The chopped italian salad was quite tasty, and many others in my party agreed. Getting plenty of ""meh, I've experienced better when going hungry"" votes from the group was the greens-only salad that I can't even identify from looking at the menu online; it was a bowl of green stuff and maybe a shaved apple or something. It had no flavor. Imagine eating a bowl of oregano and parsley with some endive? I don't know how else to describe it. A lonely frisée salad? A salad mirage where each bite brought visions of flavor only to crush your soul with anything but? Okay, so other than sharply contrasting salads, the food was pleasant and worth a return trip.

2010-10-22,5.0,"I went here with friends/family to grab dinner before going to a show downtown. Two words: Perfect Choice. The place is nice, but I couldn't get a good feel for the ambiance since it was an early dinner. I imagine it gets much busier...but I'd be okay if it doesn't. That would make it even easier for me to come back! Between 4 of us, we shared 1 appetizer, 1 salad, and 3 pizzas. A rundown of the food: Appetizer/Salad - Solid. Interesting choices, tastes. I'd recommend picking at least one to share, just to experience some of the combinations they put together. Pizza 1: Triple pepperoni with truffle oil. One person in our group had been to La Madia before and said this was a must try....she was right. When ordering at new restaurants I like to be adventurous and try things that I can't get elsewhere. Ordering pepperoni pizza to me was like ordering chicken fingers everywhere you go - ordinary. But I guess that's why someone made the word extraordinary, because this pepperoni pizza was different. It stands above the rest. Pizza 2: House-made Fennel Sausage. This was my choice. It was good, and one person at our table liked it the best. In my opinion, while the sausage was very good, the rest of the pizza was bland compared to the other two choices. Overall, good but not special enough to order again. Pizza 3: Seasonal Wild Mushrooms (white pizza). Now, as you read this, understand that tomato-based sauces/dips run thru my veins - ketchup, salsa, and most importantly marinara. Can't get enough of them. Yet, in this case, this white pizza....STOLE. THE. SHOW. One bite in and I was sold - and I hadn't even hit a mushroom yet! Without the mushrooms, this would have been the best cheese pizza ever. Once my mouth made its way over to one of those succulent mushrooms...one of the best pizzas I've ever had! (Throw some of that fennel sausage on this bad boy and I'll be here for it every day!) Drinks: fearing drowsiness during the show we were about to attend, nobody took advantage of a solid-looking wine menu. Next time, I'll be sure to not pass it up.

2010-10-12,3.0,"I have gotten La Madia's pizza for delivery numerous times, but never ate at the restaurant.  That has all changed now. The room is done up in sort of an industrial chic look.  It reminded me of a more casual version of the now defunct Follia.  Also reminded me of any number of modern Italian places I've been to in Rome and Florence.  The wine list is massive, and has interesting categorizations of old vs new world varietals.  Hats off too for having Franciacorta on the list.  It is very rare seeing this Champagne-method sparkling on any wine list in Chicago.  It was also great that the pizzas have suggested wine pairings.  Although. we went against the suggested pairing. To start, Foil Roasted Crackling Nicoise Olives.  Olives with the requisite oil & herb dressing, wrapped in foil, and quickly heated up in the oven.  Still the same as eating regular olives, with the added warmth from the wood burning forno.  Now, why didn't I think of that?  Next up, Bresaola, Shaved Fennel, Sweet Red Peppers, and Parmesan.  The plate arrived looking like carpaccio, except the beef here is cured, instead of raw.  The salty bresaola played beautifully against the fennel and sweet peppers.  For mains, 2 white pizzas.  We had the Wild Mushroom and Mozzarella, and the Laura Chenel Goat Cheese, Melted Leeks, and Pancetta Lardons.  The mushroom pizza is one of my favorites, and it never disappoints.  One thing I noticed this evening, since we were eating at the restaurant, was that there was an extra pungent garlic aroma to the pizza.  Very nice.  Pizzas here are thin crust, but not cracker thin.  The crust was nicely bubbled, and the bottom had a little chewy bite to it.  The Goat Cheese pizza was a variation on classic Alsatian tarte flambé.  The cheese was so mild and tender, enhanced further by the leeks, and the pancetta brought a nice salty punch.  Laura Chenel is the doyenne of American goat cheese.  It doesn't get any better than this.  For dessert, the small Affogato with Chocolate Sambuca Gelato was a nice cap to the meal.  Traditionally, when drinking Sambuca, coffee beans are added to the liquer.  This affogato, with the dark punch of Illy espresso and sugary anise in the Sambuca, was a nice play on this digestive. Why 3 stars?  A great no-frills place for excellent pizza.  For being a mid-range restaurant, they pay attention to artisanal ingredients.  Great for a fun night, or have it delivered when the craving hits.",0.9983,0.795,0.196,0.01,0.5384032634032633

Well, I take that back. I thought the pizza fondue was kind of blah...but other then that it's hard to go wrong.  If you like olives, I would start with them. Served warm and oh boy they are yum yum yum! The bruschetta's are also really good, especially the one with mushrooms (I'm a bit obsessed with mushrooms though...so I usually love just about anything mushroom).  Now on to the important stuff - the pizza! I am not a huge fan of the Chicago style deep dish....I love me some thin crust. And the crust on the pizzas here is perfection - it's thin and a little bubbly in places - so tasty. I've tried probably half of the pizzas and there's not been one that I didn't think was delicious. They just know how to make em here. The right amount of sauce, the right amount of toppings, the right flavors....all of it just makes my mouth very happy!  I also like the ambiance here. It feels upscale but not pretentious by any means. I've gone during the week and on the weekend and it's always busy but you never feel like it's too loud or obnoxious. They have a small bar/loungey area where you can wait for your table too. Although, with a reservation I've never waited more then 10 minutes to get seated. And if you go without a reservation, you can probably get a seat at the pizza bar, which I did one night. It was kind of neat cuz you are right in front of the chefs and you can watch them make the pizzas. Don't sit there if you are stupid hungry though - it'll be torture watching them make the pizzas while you wait for yours! I do agree with some of the other yelpers, service can be bit spotty.

The bittersweet chocolate tortino featured a few layers of cake between gooey chocolate filling with a sprinkling of toasted almonds on top.  I'm a ""chocoholic"" but a scoop of vanilla ice cream would have added just the right counterpoint for this dessert, which was a little too sweet.   Our waitress was friendly and attentive, pacing on the meal was just fine.  It's a little loud but you can still have a conversation without shouting.  They take reservations, so if you plan ahead you won't have much of a wait.  Tables were full on Friday night.   Good place, and reasonable prices.",0.9725,0.876,0.109,0.015,0.5343193843193844

Good for  a group of peeps that are hungry - the sauce was tasty and the dipping bread  (pizza crust) was warm and plenty.  MAIN DISHES:  -Mozzarella di Bufala - this was quite good! Juicy and full of flavor with gooey cheese. I scarfed this down big time.   -Burrata, Wood-Roasted Summer Squash, Market Tomatoes & Torn Basil - not my cup of tea, really, but due to personal preference most likely. My friends like this pizza though  =).  -Fettucini pasta, lamb bolognese, ricotta dolce: Not bad but a bit salty.  I've heard many good things about this place so I'm going to come back to  try some of their other pizzas as well! I've heard some of their less pricey pizzas are quite tasty such as the triple pepperoni and $5 wines!  I definitely love the hip ambiance of this place so there's potential to update my review with higher ratings next time i come =) Note to wait staff - Please improve your service - a bit slow.",0.9892,0.753,0.202,0.045,0.48927203065134095

We got there a little early and grabbed a seat at the bar.  The bartener was SUPER friendly and really knowledgeable about wine.  The ambiance of the place is great. It is definitely what we were looking for. Someplace nice and modern but without having to pay $30-40 for an entree.  We had the mushroom bruchetta as an appetizer.  I HATE, HATE, HATE mushrooms, but I agreed to try it and thought it was amazing. I barely knew I was eating mushrooms at all. For pizza we got one for each of us (4) and had plenty of leftovers. I ordered the triple pepperoni, which was tastey, but SUPER greasy.  The grease was so bad, I probably won't order that again.  My boyfriend got the egg and prosciutto pizza, which was pretty good, but we didn't love it as much as some of the other yelpers have. My friend got the artichoke pizza, and while I don't normally love artichokes I adored her pizza. Her boyfriend got the sausage and fennel, and it was amazing as well.

2010-06-20,3.0,"I was introduced to La Madia by Groupon, and decided to make a special occasion out of it - an exciting roommates' night out!  The interior was chic and fresh, yet the atmosphere was quite bizarre.  The music changed from current Top 40 singles to bubblegum pop to bad 90s jams and random rock.  The light would dim at odd times (perhaps in an effort to create a more romantic mood?).  Our waitress was Stepford-ish and robotic, where she was too eager to serve.  Like I said, chic but bizarre. The food itself was solid and tasty.  We started off with the bruschetta with asparagus, whipped ricotta, lemon oil, & shaved parmesan.  Tasted exactly like it sounds like - delicious!  For our main meal, we shared two pizzas: burrata with wood-roasted summer squash, market tomatoes & torn basil and pecorino with seasonal wild mushrooms.  The burrata with squash, tomato, and basil combination really impressed me.  It's tangy, savory, and juicy - simply delicious, unique, and highly recommended.  The pecorino with seasonal wild mushrooms was also good, but not great.  Overall, La Madia's thin-crusted pizzas are a refreshing change from the dominating deep dish pizza.  Last, we finished the evening with a selection of desserts.  We shared the warm lemon-raspberry zabaglione, strawberry-rhubarb crostata, and bittersweet chocolate tortino.  The desserts were disappointing.  My main issues with La Madia isn't the quality of food, which is pretty solid, nor the atmosphere, which was quite bizarre.  Rather, it's the value for the type of food you get.  The bruschetta was good, but for $7, I expect more than four bite-sized pieces.  Two of the desserts, priced at $7.50 each, tasted barely better than store-packaged sweets.  I expect more.  All in all, the pizza really made this a pleasant dining experience but it's not memorable enough to make me crave more La Madia.  The value's just not there.  That being said, I know they have a late night fixe menu Sun-Thu from 9pm-close for $20, which could be worth it - but I'd probably only go if I'm in the neighborhood.",0.9948,0.72,0.211,0.069,0.54955296404276
2010-06-18,3.0,"Four score and seven years...Yeah, that's about how long it seemed like my meal at La Madia took.  I first visited La Madia last year during Yelp Eats week* and wasn't blown away by the food. After reading so many other Yelper's reviews, I was ready to give this place another shot and this time try the pizza because that seemed to be where it's at.  My friend and I met for dinner around 7 and were promptly seated and offered drinks. I ordered the mixed green salad to start and we got the Classic Margherita to split. My salad came out fairly quick, but after that things went downhill.  At first we didn't notice how long our food was taking, we had a lot of catching up to do. But after a while I noticed him giving every plate of food that passed us the side eye, he pointed out that every time food passed us my voice trailed off mid-sentence. Approximately 1 hour after we ordered, our food finally arrived and we promptly began to devour it. Shortly after we began eating the manager (Jason) approached our table, he apologized for the delay in our food, explaining there was some sort of mix up in the orders and said he was comping the pizza. We had never complained about the delay so we were both pleased and impressed with the proactive approach he had taken, at the same time we were a little surprised our server never bothered to explain or even acknowledge the delay (at least until we paid the check).  So why no 3 stars? After the apology for the delay we expected things to improve, but to our surprise service actually got worse! The people refilling water were spot on, but our waiter barely ever gave us a passing glance; any beers we ordered took a long time to arrive too. After our plates had been cleared our waiter all, but disappeared; he never even offered us a dessert menu, after an inordinately long period of time I had to flag him down and ask for one. The tables around us had long finished their meals and skedaddled; by the time we exited the restaurant we were more than caught up and had been there for nearly 3 hours!  If it weren't for the food it's likely that I would've given this place 2 stars. My salad was fine, nothing special really just a simple mixed greens salad; I would've liked a little more vinegar on it to give it more flavor. The pizza was fantastic and it wasn't because I was ready to gnaw my hand off either. It was perfectly cooked, not overly greasy and had the perfect cheese to sauce ratio. My dessert, the bittersweet chocolate tortino, was amazing; chocolatey, gooey and decadent it was the perfect way to cap off the longest meal ever.  I really don't know what to make of this place; the first time the food was ok and the service stellar, this time the food was excellent and the service abysmal.  yelp.com/biz/yelp-eats-2…",0.9961,0.802,0.152,0.045,0.5074221046443269
2010-06-17,3.0,"La Madia is a nice alternative to the usual River North business lunch spots, with one glaring exception which I'll mention in a bit.  The menu is basically salads, sandwiches, and pizza. The entree salads are enormous mounds of greens piled with toppings. I tried the spinach salad without the shrimp. It was fine but I wish I would have gotten the dressing on the side - it was a bit drenched. The argula salad that my companions selected looked much, much better. Candied pecans, blue cheese, dried cherries = yum.  We shared a regular sized pie with half pepperoni and half mushrooms (for me). The crust is thin but not crispy, and held the toppings well. I wish we would have skipped the truffle oil. I always think this is going to be good and I just don't like it. It overpowered the other flavors and made the slices runny. Otherwise, the pizza was phenom.    I talked everyone into dessert - come on, it's on the company, right? We split the strawberry rhubarb compote with vanilla ice cream. Delish. A must order. Which brings me to the aforementioned downside. A four person lunch of salad, pizza, and dessert took TWO HOURS. Our server was extremely slow to take our food orders and didn't put our pizza order until after we got our salads. And by the way, the salads and pizza took about 25 minutes each to come out once ordered. Hello, it's salad. And pizza. These things do not take long to prepare. The dessert also took 20 minutes.  The place was not remotely busy, at least for the first half of the meal. It's like they intentionally stretched out the meal to take forever. Like, we're here for lunch, not a ten course meal. I'm not saying you should jam us through but come on - we have to go back to work.  I'd love to go back but next time I would specify with the server up front that we are on a tight schedule.

I admit, with wine I'm a bit of a commitment phobe, so having many choices of wines by the glass and at different pour sizes (4 oz, 7 oz) that didn't break the bank was great.   We started with a salad of mixed greens that was a decent size for sharing (probably best among 3 to 4 people, a little much for 2) that was highlighted by the inclusion of fresh-cut small radishes and some mushrooms.  For pizza, the Groupon a few months back was an awesome deal.  We ordered the triple pepperoni and the organic egg (who would have thought to do this?) & prosciutto pizzas.  Didn't know what made the pepperoni ""triple"", but assuming it was the size.  Egg was very unique and delicious on the 2nd pizza.  Portions are definitely generous, I'm a big eater, but 2 pizzas could have easily fed 3 people. Pizzas came out a bit slow considering the restaurant wasn't at capacity, but our server was cute and polite as well as knowledgeable with recommendations on wines without being overly pushy.  Reservations via OpenTable for a Friday night were easy to make a day in advance.  Randomly observation: this seems to be a popular destination for couples and their parents.",0.9935,0.788,0.206,0.007,0.5705729166666665

Our server was very nice and attentive.  I give it to her as we had our backs to her I am sure it can be pretty difficult waiting on people having to sneak up on them.  But she did a great job, glasses were always full, etc. We ordered the Organic Mixed Greens Salad.  It was fresh and tasty.  It is served in a pretty big bowl so definitely something worth sharing.  We also ordered the Triple Pepperoni pizza and the Margherita pizza.  Both very yummy too.  I only wished the bottom of the crust for the pizza were a little bit more crispier.  And for some reason I thought the Margherita pizza includes chopped tomatoes on top, however, it was pretty much a cheese pizza - no tomatoes. The atmosphere was nice and modern.  Had a cool and hip feel to it.  This is definitely a place to go when you want pizza but don't want to walk out feeling 15lbs heavier from the scarfing down a deep dish.   On a quirky sidenote...I am a super germaphobe and I was happy to see the area being bussed down and wiped with a cleaning wipe and not some wet rag, woo hoo!  I thought that was fantastic, I HATE when restaurants use the same rag to wipe down everything, it stays wet all day and they think they cleaned your table down but come on, I am a mother of two who's kids will drop things on the table and eat off of it so cleanliness is important to me :) At the end of the meal the manager came and greeted us and asked us to sign up for the wine and dine club and because we used our groupon we got a nice little deal where we received a $10 certificate to come back.  And not to mention the kind manager was a fellow filipino :)  Bonus points.

Inside, they have comfy armless lounge chairs similar to what you might find in a hotel lobby, along with regular bistro chairs.  As well, their small circular bar offers a great way to meet other patrons and converse with the bartenders, should you be alone and traveling on business.  LaMadia tends to attract sophisticated people in their late 20s and above with a discerning pallet.

I know that you are wondering why give the place 3 stars?  I just know that I will have a better experience when I am in a smaller group and when I order the pizza.

Went for the basic margarita pizza - very good.  Thin crust, a little greasy (grease is good), and flavorful sauce.  Most importantly, the pizzas are HUGE.  I could easily split it someone else, and still have leftovers.  The crust was really the standout - very thin but not crunchy.  The end was like a surprise of fluffy, fresh baked bread. Tried one of the salads too, which was also very good, I'm a fan of anything with raisins and pine nuts in them.  Great place to go if you're downtown and feel like going to an upscale establishment, but not paying up the wazoo for it.",0.9839,0.74,0.231,0.029,0.6773558897243108

The place itself is really cool, especially with the open kitchen and option to open the windows in the bar area.  They also have a great private room by their wine cellar which I've used twice for events, and not to mention a great beer selection and the best damn Matilda I've had in a restaurant.  Perfectly chilled and non-skunky.   I've had an ungodly amount of food here so I'll just review a few: Foil-Roasted Olives-Good, not great. Pizza Fondue-Yummy but a little repetitive since most people tend to get pizza for their main course. Toasted Bruschetta-My Favorite appetizer here.  The wild mushrooms are superb and the whipped ricotta is an awesome accompaniment. Arugula and Herbed Chicken-Nice, but heavy to start. Heirloom Beet Salad and Watercress with Salted Almonds-Such a great salad. Romaine Lettuce with Crisp Pancetta and Creamy Mustard-So good and torn if this or the beet is my favorite salad. Margehrita-Just OK House-Made Fennel Sausage-You have to like Fennel, which I don't, so this wasn't my favorite. TRIPLE PEPPERONI WITH TRUFLE OIL-I LOVE this freaking pizza.  Love is an understatement.  I have dreams of this pizza...but you have to eat it while it's hot. Parma Classic-It was like a salad on a pizza with too much arugula.  No thanks, Goat Cheese and Leeks-Good but very heavy.  Would like to see more garlic.

2010-02-26,5.0,"Until this year, I have always been disappointed by Restaurant week. I have either went to places that did a bait and switch, or places where the food left a lot to be desired. My experience this year could not have been more different. Our diner at Brazaz was fantastic and our experience at La  Madia blew me away.   This is not your parents Pizza joint. La Madia is classy, unique and offers a wonder selection of Italian delights. My first impression of La Madia was that they were trying to be one those artsy New York City eateries. The interior is tacky to say the least. But the wonderful food and great service overshadowed the kooky interior.   The restaurant week menu was pretty extensive. They gave you a wide variety of different choices to choose from. I started out with the Pizza Bread Fondue. It was basically a large chunk of Pita Bread served with a Tomato based Fondue. It was a huge appetizer that could have fed three people.   For my Entree I went with the Triple Pepperoni Pizza. The Crust was thin, almost like a New York Style pizza. The Pie was perfectly spiced and it was cooked just right.   The desert was a slice of American decadence. We ordered  a double layered Chocolate cake that tasted like it was doused with some kind of Liquor. Every bite tasted like a sin. If eating so well makes me a Infidel, I'm all for it.   The bottom line about La Madia is this. The restaurant week menu was awesome. We got fed like a King and Queen for $32 bucks a piece. The food was Delicious, the service was top notch and the atmosphere was fun. I would not hesitate to go back to La Madia.

2010-02-26,5.0,"La Madia was a last minute choice for a weeknight dinner before a movie downtown. I had passed by it before, but never really even looked into what this place was because I don't hang out downtown too often after work. Boy, have I been missing out!! What a treat! The restaurant itself is very winter-friendly and warm. There's a fireplace in the lounge area and booths and tables leading to the back pizza kitchen. Had I known, I would have requested to sit back there, at the ""pizza bar"", where you can dine and watch the pizzas being made. Next time! The menu is simple and fresh. Lots of amazing ingredients put together in just the right way. For instance, the Oven-Roasted, Prosciutto-Wrapped Medjool Dates Filled with Gorgonzola Dolce. Now, I've had ""bacon wrapped dates"" before, but not like this. The salty crunch of the prosciutto was also very smokey. In combination with the gorgonzola dolce, which is a younger, milder gorgonzola that has a soft, spreadable texture and slightly salty aftertaste, was simply delightful with the sweet, baked date. All of those rich flavors in my mouth made me do the table shimmy and wag my tail just a bit. I was breaking each one into the tiniest of pieces to make it last longer. Another added touch to this dish is that the figs are served on a bed of tiny little shredded onions and sliced almonds. Not a morsel went to waste, trust me. One other appetizer not to miss is the Bresaola, Shaved Fennel, Sweet Peppers & Parmesan- this is best described as being a lot like lettuce wraps, except the 'lettuce' here would be salami. And you wrap all the other things up inside and make your own little wraps. Fun and fantastic! The Market Tomatoes, Bufala Mozzarella & Roasted Peppers with Honey Balsamic Dressing was another lovely choice. I was dipping everything into that honey balsamic- sweet and tart, yum! There are probably 15 pizzas to choose from and it is hard to commit! I saw several pass by and tried to check them all out. The one I went with was the wild mushroom and pecorino. This crust could not have been any thinner, it was like eating a cracker, truly. This is why I believe I was justified in eating the whole thing by myself. It really is very light and easy to devour in its entirety.  The wine special on this particular night was ""$1 per ounce"" for the selected wine, which was a syrah blend. Our server offered us up to a 7oz pour or we could order a $25 bottle. It was a good deal compared to the other prices of bottles which were a little higher than I prefer paying. But the wine list was extensive and I did like that each pizza came with a recommended wine. La Madia was a fun new find for me! It has a very loungy feel for after work drinks or a casual date. Very good service, the pizza was GREAT and if you don't go nuts with drinks, it's really very reasonably priced for perfect, sharable portions.",0.9986,0.775,0.191,0.034,0.4771815089672233
2010-02-25,3.0,"I'd like to give a 4 cuz the food was pretty good and the decor was pretty nice in there. However, the service left something (everything) to be desired. It was over 10 min before anyone came up to us and it was some other server just coming to let us know our server would eventually be coming. Maybe. She did show and gave no apology or acknowledgement. On top of that, she was no help on the menu. Whenever asked how something was, all we would hear was ""good"" or ""really good"". So informative. Oh and it was lunch and we were one of 6 tables between 2 servers. Go figure.  The food is pretty good tho. The grape pizza was different but good. The mozzarella di bufalo compana was delicious! I really liked one of the salads but I forgot which - it had pancetta. Very fresh and flavorful. Desserts were good too. We got choc cake, espresso ice cream, and lemon cookies. The lemon cookies were the only actual suggestion the server made and we didn't like them. Ha! The espresso ice cream was just perfect tho!!! FYI it is a bit expensive so be prepared to shell out some major dough for pizza- which is something I tend to have trouble doing usually. The food was good tho.

2010-02-25,4.0,"I went into this meal with a little bit of hesitation, because of what I heard it seemed that this restaurant wasn't really my scene. I should have listened to the age-old advice of not judging a book by its cover, or in this case trendy-hipness.  I heard this was ""a place to be seen"" and I usually try to avoid those.  However, I heard a few good things about the food and I decided to give it a chance.   I went here with a group of friends and we were all impressed with the food.  We had reservations for Saturday night, which was a saving grace because otherwise it would have been an extra long wait for a table.  They were participating in Restaurant Week, but we quickly realized it would cost just as much to order thing a la carte...so that's what we did since their servings are pretty large and in charge.  While there I tried the following things that were delish:  - Pizza Fondue: the dipping sauce is much more tomato-y than cheesy - Bacon wrapped dates with gorgonzola: For reals?!?  There is nothing but right with this app - Fennel Sausage with Sweet Onions Pizza: easy to throw pack the whole pie - Mozzarella di Bufala , Prosciutto di Parma, Tomato Sauce Pizza: salty and scrumptious - Chicken ravioli: good portion, creamy and flavorful - Chocolate tortino: Sweet Jesus...this was crazy rich and amazing! The only thing I tried that was way below-great were their famous butter cookies, not so much: dry and boring.  I should also mention that our waitress seemed to be a little brain dead and not with the program.  I felt like we had to explain things to her multiple times and ask lots of questions.  She also broke one of my big rules: not bringing all the food out at the same time.  For example, two of my friends ordered the prix fix meal so ordered all three courses at the beginning.  However, they brought out their desserts before even offering the rest of us the dessert menu...it was kind of awkward.  I would definitely go here again, but only on the weekend if I'm in the mood to throw on some heels and a face of makeup...and that's not often for this lady.",0.989,0.813,0.137,0.051,0.5834899749373434

Both times I have been at La Madia I left completely satisfied. This past Friday I went with my 12 dollar Groupon for two pizzas. Awesome deal!! I think the two pizzas we got totaled 30 dollars. The service did get a little slow once we mentioned the Groupon. Our olive appetizer took much longer than expected as well. This is the reason for my 4 stars.  Of the three I tried, pepperoni, fennel sausage & mozzarella & Prosciutto, I think the pepperoni with truffle oil wins. But you can't go wrong with any choice!

2010-02-21,5.0,"La Madia means, ""the flour bin"" in Italian.  I had wanted to visit La Madia for quite a long time, and it was just luck that Groupon recently featured La Madia. Coupon in hand, a friend and I set out for a Friday night dinner. I am still a little uncomfortable with the concept of using coupons for discounts at restaurants, so I was glad that the hostess didn't make a big deal about the use of one at all. At about 6:00 PM the place looked almost empty, but apparently, all those tables and booths were reserved. We were seated at the ""pizza bar"", which was fine.  At the pizza bar, we were lucky enough to be able to see right into the wood-burning oven, and watched as pizzas baked at 720 F. We also watched as the chefs created pizza after pizza out of mounds of soft dough, the barest touch of tomato sauce, and some of the freshest and best quality ingredients ever. It was fascinating to witness them toss copious amounts of flour from the bin of flour (la madia) over the dough, and with intense concentration and precision form each pizza as if they were works of art.  We were treated to some complimentary prosecco, and started with some roasted olives and a beet salad. The olives were good, but I really loved the beet salad. Composed of watercress, blue cheese, almonds and red and pink heirloom beets, this salad is out of this world delicious. My mouth is watering as I write this! Pizzas were crisp, tasty and sparkled with freshness. My friend ordered the tomato/arugula pesto/ricotta: very good, with nice contrasts of flavors and textures. I had the egg and prosciutto, which was also excellent. I would like to point out that these are large pizzas, easily 12"" across. The crust is fabulous in itself; rather than just being a ""carrier"" of the other ingredients, it's integral to the pizza as a whole. Lovely wine and a super rich chocolate tortino rounded out our meal, filled our bellies and fed our souls. The quality of the ingredients, the artistry of the preparation and the warm contemporary atmosphere were all outstanding. I will be back again to try their many other offerings.

A friend and I did lunch at La Madia on a Saturday and although I wasn't in a tizzy to go to another pizza place, I was pleasantly surprised.  We went for the pizzas, but I can't wait to go back and try their flatbread sandwiches. The specialty? A good sized list of gourmet pizzas. No, no, not your typical barbecue chicken. Intriguing variations such as triple pepperoni w/truffle oil or lamb sausage w/peppers and mint salsa verde. Superb! I have to mention the spinach salad with shrimp and gorgonzola and tomatoes. Can I just say it was HUGE and enough for 2-3 people to share? You know I noticed the welcoming customer service from the hosts at the door to our waitress. I was pleased we didn't have to fight a crowd and I never felt rushed. The atmosphere was relaxed and not uptighty with an ecclectic crowd of diners.

We sat at the bar, and I was upset because I envisioned a private romantic dinner for us. After five short minutes the hostess informed us they had a cancellation and seated us at a nice table in the back where we could watch the pizzas go in and out of the fire wood oven. Perfect.  Our server, Nicole, was sweet, informative, and attentive. The wine list was extensive and we were very pleased with our bottle. We had a coupon from Groupon granting us two pizzas. Typically when I have a coupon, I get worse service. Not at La Madia. Nicole treated us like royalty. And so did the co-owner, Tony, who came to our table, made a joke and informed us that the organic eggs for our Cracked Egg and Prosciutto pizza hadn't arrived yet. He was apologetic and sent us our Goat Cheese and Melted Leeks pizza first. We wouldn't have even noticed the timing had Tony not informed us, but we appreciated the personal attention from the management and the extra touch.  I was a server for eight years and I have high standards for service. I hate that I don't often receive the level of service I expect in Chicago, a restaurant driven, foodie lover's city. La Madia, however, blew me away. And so did the food. Our pizza was absolutely delicious, with original combinations, and gourmet Italian cheeses not found anywhere else in the city.  For dessert we had a chocolate tortino cake with chocolate ganache and of course a birthday candle. Tony popped by again and gave us two glasses of port to go with our dessert - on the house as an apology for our ""wait"". We loved everything we ate and we loved every bit of our service. It was apparent that La Madia's staff was on the same page - a cohesive unit all working together to give their guests a positive dining experience. They succeeded. Our experience was amazing and I can't wait to go back. That is saying a lot considering I normally don't like to go to the same place twice because there are so many restaurants to taste in Chicago.

The boyfriend and I got water and split a pizza - the fennel sausage one.  I am a huge fan of the cracker thin wood fired pizza, so this was a great find for me. The fennel sausage was crumbly and delicious, and the pizza also had shaved onions on it - yum. They brought it to the table with little bowls of Parmesan cheese and red pepper flakes.  We finished the pizza quickly (because it was so yummy) and then we tried their gelato of the day, which was vanilla with bits of chocolate cake. It wasn't the best gelato I've ever tasted, but it certainly hit the spot. The pizza is definitely the star here - and apparently the pasta from what I've heard (it's freshly made here). The restaurant is bigger than it looks from the outside, there is a fireplace in the lounge up front, and apparently they have a patio in warmer weather. They also have a private room that looks perfect for small gatherings like intimate birthday dinners.

We had the frisée / endive / radicchio / currants / pine nuts & balasamic dressing and it was excellent. The currants really stand out and add sweetness against the balsamic.

We weren't very hungry so we didn't order any apps so I can't tell you anything about that. I think it only took 15 mins for the pizza to get to our table from time of order. The fennel sausage pizza looked a bit sad; it was very monochromatic and greasy. When you picked up the pizza it was very droopy which was disappointing. The fennel sausage pizza wasn't anything special. You couldn't even tell that it tasted like sausage - let alone ""home-made."" The Parma Classic was a different story. It was overloaded with arugula, a few thin slices of prosciutto, and pecorino cheese. It looked like a salad on top of a pizza. The prosciutto was good, but when isn't it good? Overall I wasn't very impressed with the food. I think you can get better pie elsewhere... The wine list on the other hand is quite extensive. The only thing I did right all night was order the wine that they had suggested to go with the fennel sausage pizza. It was tasty and not over priced.

After an exhaustive search of pretty much every restaurant in the downtown area that I thought could possibly handle a party for 30 people that gave us a private or semi-private space, a sit-down dinner and some kind of bar package, I came up with the extremely competitively priced La Madia.  It had everything I was looking for: style, sophistication, great food and they were willing to work with me on my fairly restrictive budget. I spoke with Megan Kirkpatrick, their private events planner, to get the ball rolling.  I couldn't have asked for someone more helpful and lovely.  She was super-responsive, providing me with menu options and ideas and she also made my corporate budget work.  Cheers, Megan.  You're absolutely fantastic! Our bar package was La Madia's Premium Bar Package including pretty much every hard liquor you can imagine (except super high-end whiskeys and ports), beer and wine.  Priced at $29 per person for the first two hours and $6 each additional hour, it's a steal, especially for my hard-drinking work crowd.  For food, I went with the Grande package, which gave me 2 appetizers, 2 salads, 3 pizzas, 2 pastas and 2 dessert choices.  All of this for the extremely affordable price of $28 per person. While all of the food was delicious, there were definitely some winners.  1. Seasonal Mushroom Bruschetta - Perfectly seasoned mushrooms atop a creamy cheese and served on toasted baguette.  Lovely. 2. Romaine Salad with Crispy Pancettta, Market Tomatoes and Creamy Mustard Dressing - So simple, but so well done.  The mustard dressing is arguably the best salad dressing I've ever had. 3. Triple Pepperoni Pizza finished with White Truffle Oil - ZOMG.  Fan-freaking-tastic.  It was hands-down my favorite dish of the night.  I loved that it was slightly crispy. 4. Ricotta Gnocci with House-Made Fennel Sausage and Spinach - I believe I tried this dish at Yelp Eats and wasn't blown away, but this was on point this time around.   How about that service?  Seriously, it was top notch.  We had no less than 3 servers who were maintaining our party all night and they really worked hard to keep us happy.  It's no easy task keeping our cocktail glasses full, and everyone was well-lubricated and satisfied.  The kitchen team even brought out a special, well-done cheese pizza for my Regional Vice President, gratis of course, when he requested it.  Megan also checked in a few times to make sure the food was great and everyone was enjoying their party.  When we didn't meet our food and liquor minimum due to a few no-shows, the server asked me if we'd like to purchase a nice bottle of wine to take home since they always want to make sure their customers are getting something for the money they spend, so we ended up with a lovely cabernet.  I felt incredibly well-taken care of by the staff at La Madia.

2009-11-09,3.0,"""Too late!  You missed it!""  I think I missed the boat on La Madia.  What was once, I divine, a great spot to get some Italian-style pizza and relax with friends is now a trend spot that has forgotten to concentrate on the food.  I was a bit let down. The good: The triple pepperoni pizza with white truffle oil was every bit as good as I had hoped.  The pepperoni dominated the pizza.  I was able to chomp down on copious amounts of 'roni in every bite.  The white truffle oil finished the pizza nicely so as to give an earthy zing to such a familiar dish.  We devoured this. Everything else: was a mess.  The menus still said Summer 2009.  A trifling matter, but a jarring one nevertheless.  We didn't get water for quite some time.  Rather than have it brought to us, we had to ask our waitress and the manager for water - which came after we'd ordered, directly before our food came and after our wine.  Our wine.  Wow.  I expect a place like La Madia, with an open and highlighted wine cellar to focus on pairing wine with the dishes.  I expect the waitrons to know enough about the vino to help me make the selection that best fits my tastes.  Since we were ordering multiple dishes, we disregarded the suggested wine pairing (for individual dishes) in favor of a wine that would suit our collective tastes, palettes and dishes.  We asked the waitress, of a certain type of wine, which was best suited to give us x, y & z.  ""Blank stare....blink...blink...I don't know.""  That's not an acceptable answer.  We wound up ordering an adequate bottle but I was unsatisfied with it.  That dissatisfaction lasted throughout the meal. The other dishes: we ordered the special/seasonal risotto and the arugula & prosciutto pizza.  The risotto was prepared nicely but it didn't taste like much.  I know there were squash elements, but nothing about the dish tasted like ""Fall"" or squash.  It just tasted like a nicely prepared risotto.  The arugula pizza was a slight mess.  It was an olive oiled crust with with leaves, cheese and a smattering of meat thrown on the top.  And it tasted exactly as described.  It was lazy, uninspired and disappointing.  Perhaps had we just had the risotto and leaf pizza, we might have been satisfied.  But knowing that La Madia was capable of that triple pepperoni pizza made me think that something was off.  One of these things was not like the other.  The meal was off balance and the service was just off.

2009-10-19,3.0,"Sadly, I have to deduct a star. I used to dine at La Madia frequently and loved their pizzas and pastas. It was definitely in my top three for thin crust pizza in Chicago. However, last night when I went with a good friend, we were severely disappointed with our meal. The friend who I dined with used to literally eat at La Madia three times a week.  Reason being, not only is he that lazy and doesn't know how to boil water, but because it was really good!  So what led to the downgrade? First, the menu has changed. I understand seasonal menus and switching things up but they removed some of my favorite things including the Elderberry Serum cocktail and the prosciutto wrapped dates. I was a bit let down as I had planned on consuming a few of those tasty cocktails but their other drinks are pretty good as well.   Since the prosciutto wrapped dates were no longer on the menu, we opted to skip appetizers and order entrees to share. We had the fennel sausage pizza  and the chicken, spinach & ricotta ravioli. The ravioli arrived first and while tasty, was a bit salty. I only ate one and a half and decided I'd just eat the pizza. When the pizza arrived, I felt as if La Madia had struck out. A quick look at the pizza and I knew it was slightly overcooked but not enough to send it back and the toppings were skimpy. Upon taking a bite from my slice, my initial thoughts were confirmed. It definitely stayed in the oven a few minutes too long. It didn't taste like the La Madia I had frequented so often in the past.  I'm hoping that last night was just an off night and not the new norm. Perhaps my La Madia excitement lead to my eventual disappointment, but I still like La Madia and will definitely be back.

The staff was very friendly and the service was good.  They had a nice wine selection and we got a really tasty malbec/shiraz blend (although it was marked up about 300%).  We had two appetizers as well.  One was the bruschetta with mushrooms which was very tasty (order 1 for every 2 people in your party).  The other was the artichoke.  While it wasn't like mom used to make it, it was really tasty and came with two different dipping sauces.

Our table of six ordered three pizzas and a calzone, which seemed to be the perfect amount of food.  Everybody enjoyed what they had, and our server was helpful and attentive (even if the service was a touch slow). The calzone was outstanding--the bread shell was tasty and crispy and gooey all at the same time, the filling was cheesy and meaty and perfect, and the tomato sauce (on the side) was tasty.  The buffalo  mozzarella pizza was quite good too--a firm but not crispy crust topped with what was clearly high quality ingredients.   The mozzarella was melted nicely, but did wind up making the pizza (or rather, the top of the pizza) a little greasy.",0.9869,0.837,0.142,0.021,0.5589835164835164

For years I believed Chicago cannot do a good thin crust pizza. I have tried numerous places, ended up being disappointed every time. Trust! For years, I have lived in this snobbery that the only place to eat a thin crust pizza is NY.  Well, La Madia gave me a good bitchslap and disproved my notions.  The husband and I decided to play hooky on Monday. It was a beautiful day to go to work. We both decided to go on a lazy lunch date instead. Wandered around the neighborhood and found La Madia almost empty. Great outdoor seating and a cute interior. We were sold. They have an extensive wine list. The husband ordered a glass of Fournier and I got a Tamellini. Perfect for summer outdoor dining. We decided to order the luncheon for two: a selection of beginner, one pizza, and two cookies.  For a beginner, we split the heirloom beet salad. Soft slices of beets served with watercress, salt roasted almonds, and gorgonzola. Excellent salad. For the pizza, we got the triple pepperoni pizza made with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese, topped with white truffle oil.  The pizza is the best I've had in Chicago.

The pepperoni with truffle oil is full of something special.  The pepperoni is a little sharp and spicy, and the truffle oil mellows out the flavor on the end note.  The consistency of the dough has a nice chewiness, but is still a little al dente.  Just right.  The salads were okay.

The menu runs parallel to the likes of Crust in Wicker Park with a variety of fancy salads, a few calzones and a selection of thin crust, wood-fired pizzas. Except that it's within a few blocks of the Magnificent Mile.  We shared a very sizable salad of dandelion greens, radicchio, endives, black currants, fennel and plenty of pine nuts. Next came a hot, fresh napoletana-style pizza of mushrooms and pecorino cheese with a chewy, slightly raised, slightly blackened crust. We finished with two lemony butter cookies. This lunch special is $15 and meant to be shared...so really, it's $7.50 for one person. How is that possible? I do not know. There are other items on the lunch menu that are not included in the lunch special that look just as good for not much more. A lady seated next to us had a very generously portioned platter of a half-sandwich, small salad and bowl of soup - for $9, I think it was. Will hit that up next time, I think. The only downside to this place as a lunch option is that it seems to take a bit of time, but probably only because the food is fresh-made. So budget your time accordingly - at least a full hour for lunch. But the atmosphere is casual (and comfy seats!), there is not wait to be seated, and there was not a tour group in sight.

The second salad, a baby arugala with cherries and walnuts and a nice vinagrette. Yummy! The bruschetta and baby steamed artichokes were good, just not something to write home about. Now onto the pizzas: definitely great asparagus pizza on thin crust was light, and just enough cheese to bring out the vegetable. The sausage and green pepper pizza was similar: light and not too much meat. The last pizza was pepperoni with white truffle oil. The concept is great but the chef can lighten up on the amount of pepperoni and truffle oil. This pizza was greasy. However, if you're looking for an ""in your face"" pizza, this is it!

2009-03-23,5.0,"There are a lot of 4-star reviews here for La Madia, which I understand, but for me, two things put it over the top into 5-star territory for me: 1. the stellar service, and 2. the super reasonable prices. 1. I went to La Madia not once but TWICE last week. The first time was with a girlfriend. We went after work for wine, and we split the gnocchi and house-made fennel sausage - absolutely delish. I could've easily eaten every bite. My friend wasn't crazy about the first wine she had, so the bartender gave her a few samples until she found one she liked. At one point, the manager (I think) asked us to move down a seat at the bar to accomodate 2 friends, and we gladly obliged; despite the fact that we didn't mind moving one iota, he bought us another round of drinks - that's my kind of service. 2. I liked it so much the first time that I brought my boyfriend who was in for the weekend. We had the ""Lazy Luncheon"" special - a starter, a pizza, wine pairings, and cookies, for $25. Not $25 per person - $25 total. In that neck of the woods (read: dangerously close to the Rainforest Cafe), they could charge a ton more for their (delicious) food, but they don't, and for that, they will be seeing my wino ass parked at the bar quite a bit. On that note, they have 2 wines of the week (a red and a white) for $5 a glass. I defy you to find me another place in River North that charges a mere $5/glass.  So, five stars it is!

2009-03-07,3.0,"When faced with the task of dining at a venue that I didn't personally choose, I get quite anxious.  Fortunately, for the friend's birthday dinner that I attended at La Madia last night, I was somewhat pleasantly surprised that the choice of locales wasn't too uninformed or touristy. Things started out a bit rough.  Half of our party had arrived for the reservation on time, and the other half was about 5 minutes late.  The hostess would not let any of us sit at the table until the WHOLE party was present.  We were told to stand in the crowded bar area until the rest of our group arrived.  This sort of policy may be appropriate at Sunday morning breakfast joints that don't take reservations; here, it made no sense.  Apparently the management prefers the look of a completely empty table versus the half-full variety. Onto the first course ... we had the baked artichoke appetizer, which was quite tasty.  The cooked niçoise olives were also edible, albeit non-interesting. Next, the pizza... The waitress informed us that the pizzas were appropriate in size for a single serving.  I think that she must have this place confused with her previous job at the Pizza Hut lunch buffet - where the clientele usually consume more food than the daily rations for a starving country.  I'll say this:  if you're hungry and don't order appetizers, you could probably down a whole pizza by yourself, but with the pre-entree snacks we enjoyed, I ended up taking half my pizza home. I ordered the home-made sausage, cheese, tomato pizza.  Boring, I know, but I wanted a back-to-the-basics pizza, and as much meat as possible.  The pizza was average; not great, not bad.  They had more interesting choices on the menu than mine; I tasted my date's spinach / speck / pinenut pizza, and found it to also be average, and a bit heavy on the spinach.  I'll give 3.5 stars for the food. Ok, that's all I have to say about the food - but I do have one more thing to say about this place.  Like I mentioned earlier, this was a birthday dinner.  As a result of all the birthday talk, the waitress brought a little plate of small cookies out with a candle for the birthday girl.   I love it when restaurants do that kind of stuff - what a nice gesture! ... ... ... until that plate of cookies showed up on our fucking bill.  I don't give a shit how much it was ($4), but that is just tacky as shit to charge for something that, A) we didn't order, and B) is 'understood' in the biz as a complimentary, kind, customer-winning gesture.  (This roughly equivocates to my subtraction of 0.5 to 1 star on my rating, as well as the chances of me return to this venue to be slim to none.  Homie don't play that shit.) So, La Madia, you started out on the wrong foot, but regained your balance with a nice set of appetizers and some mediocre pizza, and above average table service ... yet at goodbye, all I was left with to say was ""go f*** yourself.""",0.9856,0.859,0.098,0.042,0.5010251322751321

2009-02-23,4.0,"Okay, so if you had to assume what a place with a name like ""La Madia"" was, you could take a first guess that it is a Spanish tapas place.  But no, it turns out it's a contemporary pizza joint. This past weekend we attended my sister-in-law's 30th birthday here, in an area at the back of the restaurant.  It wasn't really what I would call a private room, but it worked quite well for our large group. First impressions were good for me, with a nice urban decor and an inviting fireplace that instantly made you forget about the crappy weather we put up with year after year here.  You could easily lounge by the front with a drink and people watch from the swanky couches or array of stools that surround the bar. It didn't take long for us to be seated, and we were instantly asked if we were interested in any wine or cocktails.  Mind you, our group had planned a $25 / person pre-set menu that didn't include cocktails, so this was the only decision we were likely to make while seated. The meal began with a set of bruschettas (not sure if there is a regular bruschetta AND a mushroom bruschetta to choose from) that were fantastic.  I was quite a little piggly wiggly that day, and wasn't shy about gobbling up someone who didn't want theirs (or didn't act quickly enough).  I was glad to find the recipe for this on the restaurant website.  I'll try to reproduce at home with some quality ingredients and report back on my success.  Anyway, no complaints there, and like I said - would get it again if given the opportunity. Then another starter:  the prosciutto wrapped dates.  I'm convinced that these are in football-sized vats just inside the gates of heaven.  Oh wait, I'm agnostic.  But you get the idea.  I've always been a fan of bacon-wrapped dates, and these didn't disappoint.  My all-time faves are at Cafe Babareeba, but these make the list as well. Our next course was the salad course.  There were two from which to choose.  One which was an arugula herbed chicken salad, that was OK but nothing memorable.  The second was an organic mixed greens salad with cucumber.  Again, although it was fresh, it was more like a stepping stone to the next course rather than anything I'd ever go back for. We had three kinds of pizzas at our table: Mozzarella di Bufala Campana, Tomato Sauce & Torn Basil; Triple Pepperoni, Tomato Sauce & Mozzarella Cheese finished with White Truffle Oil; and the House Made Fennel Sausage, Sweet Peppers & Vidalia Onions.  The pizzas (although thin) are not crispy on the bottom like the ones I make at home or get through takeout.  Now, I'm not the wood-fired expert by any means, so I can't say that's typical of those methods or not.  Nonetheless, I love crispy pizzas but didn't care that this one drooped when I picked it up.  Pretty much the same for each. Now, the taste.  Pepperoni?  Large discs covered the pizza, with an oily texture on top.  Pepperoni is now a rare treat, after learning that it's beyond heavy on sodium and fat, with just four little discs adding over 100 calories.  This was well worth the splurge in terms of flavor: extra salty, which I love. Next in line was the buffalo mozzarella one (what looked like a margherita type pizza with extra cheese and basil on it, so I think I'm reviewing the right one).  Tasty.  Simple, satisfying and something (like the pepperoni) I would have been happy ordering on its own.   The least favorite, but still tasty (again, no complaints or something I would spit out and say 'no way' to) was the sausage pepper combo. Dessert was served but I didn't try more than just a spoon:  it was a gelato that looked like cookies and cream, but I can't remember what it tasted like.  It didn't make me ravage the table, so I can't say that much about it. I think I would definitely come back to lazily enjoy the bruschetta again and branch out from just the pizza to perhaps the gnocchi or the mushroom risotto. For the price we paid in the group, I guess you could say it was relatively reasonable.  But I think the restaurant got away with serving very little for the price.  I didn't leave the restaurant hungry, but things came in small quantities and was staggered (although it was advertised as 'family style' --which instantly conjures an image of Maggiano's-size bowls with take-home suitcases for the leftovers).  So you coddled your food as if you were on an airline flight and were portioning your bites to fit the circumstances.  This was because we had to be polite in our large group.  There's no telling how much food would arrive, or how quickly I'd eat it if we were on our own and manners were limited.",0.9979,0.801,0.145,0.054,0.46777097726464817

We went for the Chef's tasting earlier this month.  La Madia offers a tasting menu with wine pairing on the first Wednesday of every month - an absolute steal for $35 (excluding tax & tip) for the amount, quality, and variety of food!   The pizza (our third course) was definitely excellent - we had chanterelle mushroom and lobster mushroom pizza.  I could have eaten the whole pie! Our fifth course was pork, and it was a bit dry.  The Frogola that was served with the pork was quite tasty and unique though. The menu stated that we'd be getting a cranberry crostata for dessert, but the chocolate cake that the people around us were chowing down on looked so good...so I mentioned to the chef (also a nice touch that the chef was doing some of the serving and explanation of the courses) that the chocolate cake is what I wanted for dessert, and he said that he'd take care of us.  So everyone at our table got the cranberry crostata (which was absolutely excellent), plus we got a chocolate cake for the table!  Now that's service! We were all pretty happy after 5 half portions of wine and beer that was paired with our dessert.  I would definitely recommend the chef's tasting - so don't be surprised if you see me in here on the first Wednesday of every month!",0.9824,0.851,0.131,0.018,0.6274853801169591

The pizzas that followed were very fresh with a crispy crust.  I especially enjoyed the triple pepperoni pizza with truffle oil.  It was a little on the oily side, but what do you expect with TRIPLE pepperoni?  At the same time, the thin crust was crispy with just enough chewiness to create a great mouth feel.  The pizza with grapes was more interesting but less tasty - the roasted grapes were really sweet and tasted more like raisins.  However, the combo was cool enough that I was glad that I tried it. Hostess was really nice and made some beer recommendations for us.  They have a very large and decently priced wine list and if I hadn't been so tired of drinking from the weekend, I probably would have tried a couple of them.  As it was, I was content to have their cane sugar root beer.  I love the root beer and pizza combination - reminds me of childhood!",0.9905,0.781,0.19,0.029,0.576689708141321

My favorites were the spinach/speck (very fresh - highly recommend it) and the buffalo mozarella with basil.

The crust had a nice texture, straddling the line between crispy and chewy.     I had the house made sausage, pepper and onion. The sausage was rich and flavorful, so rich in fact that I think it would have been better enhanced with more pepper and onion (which were slivered delicately for a nice mouth feel) in lieu of the overly ample amount of cheese.  The artichoke appetizer was great, two meaty artichokes suffused with oil and garlic and served with two dippings sauces, one an olive oil with chives, the other a creamy mustard.  The wine list is very long, but with a nice range in prices. There were some 4 ounce tasters for $4 and some bottles as much as $400. I enjoyed the Malbec that was recommended to pair with my selection; $10 for a 7 ounce glass. The dessert, a pear ""tart"" was disappointing. It seemed like a day old bakery pastry (practically had to use a knife to get into it) that was warmed up and served with a dollop of ice cream. Lamentably, I could barely taste the pear.

First Impression:  The restaurant looks great.  The decor is modern, yet casual and comfortable.  It seems to fit with their image of a contemporary pizzeria.   Our party of 8 was sat immediately on a very busy Friday night.  We all got cocktails to start, which were excellent, but things went downhill from there. Food:  The food is passable at best, and certainly not worth the above-average prices. Appetizers: Pizza fondue:  Bread and marinara sauce.  I guess the touch of cream makes it worth $9.50.  I can't believe this was even on the menu. Toasted Bruschetta:  It may have been toasted and crispy at one point, but when it got to our table it was a soggy mess.  The ricotta was in a watery pool of mush.  The entire dish was basically a nightmare. Oven Roasted Artichoke:  This was the best appetizer we had.  The sauces were good and the artichokes were tasty. Roasted Jumbo Asparagus wrapped in Prosciutto:  A simple dish that seems hard to screw up.  How did they manage?  They served rock hard prosciutto wrapped around over-cooked asparagus.  The most disappointing dish of the night. Main courses: I'm not going to go into as much detail here.  The pizzas were good, not great by any standard.  The risotto with asparagus was decent, but a little on the mushy side.  The risotto with short ribs was hands down the best dish of the night. The Ricotta Gnocchi was good, but not memorable. Service: At first our service was very good.  Our cocktails and appetizers came quickly as did our first two bottles of wine.  After that, things started to get missed.  We ordered a glass of wine that never came, even after reminding the waiter 3 times throughout the meal.  We ordered a salad without meat that came only after asking 2 waiters and the manager.  When the salad finally came, after the main courses, one in our party asked if there was meat in it.  The manager grabbed the salad back from the table and stormed away without explanation.  He came back 5 minutes later with 2 salads and nicely put them on the table.  The whole experience was very, very strange.  It just gets weirder from there. We ordered 1 piece of chocolate cake.  It tasted like it came from Jewel.  Then, out of nowhere, the waiter comes to our table and tells us that the Manager would like us to leave.  I'm not kidding.  We were not being loud, we were not acting rude.  In fact, not one person had even made a complaint to anybody throughout the meal, despite the bad food and worse service.  Needless, to say were were all stunned.  We quickly paid, and left the restaurant. All I can say about this place is that none of us will ever go back, and I would encourage none of you to ever go there.  The food ranges from awful to average, and the service is the worst I've had in years.  The only star this place gets it for the wine list.  It's extensive and has a good selection of inexpensive wines.",0.994,0.775,0.147,0.078,0.49400046008741666

We were escorted to a table, a table that was not really a table but a small deuce that was barely nestled into a corner.  Upon sitting, we somehow found a way to hang our coats on our chair and asked for a wine list.   The wine list was impressive, as it should have been seeing the bottles in the front entrance of the restaurant.  Clearly, this restaurant puts an emphasis on their wine selection.  My friend asked about two different wines and the server answered ""well, I am not sure since I have not tried either, they don't let us try anything but the wines by the glass"".   ARE YOU KIDDIN ME?  you are going to have a full wine list, expect to charge a reasonable amount for these wines, and NOT educate your staff?  What kind of place is this?  How can you expect to make any $$ on wine sales if you DO NOT EDUCATE YOUR STAFF!!!  At least, educate them to LIE!  ""I have not tried either"" is a completely inexcusable answer! Short list...... The appetizers are OK at best The pizza, if you don't order anything too complicated is good The crowd is average AT best, dont' come here looking for anything ""cool"" The music is late 90s, I think the owners wife must have her Ipod on To put in all into perspective, I said this, ""i think this place is great for shopping all day and looking for a place to eat afterwards"".  it is an upscale California Pizza Kitchen.   Final thought...as I was leaving, I saw a man in SWEATS wearing a backwards, camaflouge, base ball hat - that was the way I would sum up my night at La Madia!",0.9919,0.873,0.115,0.012,0.5766865079365081

One opportunity for improvement: the server was super-friendly and helpful, but didn't know much about any of the wines they served -- not a big problem, the bartender made up for it and helped him (and us) out. And this is a crazy thing to note but the olives they used in their martinis were fantastic.  No fancy stuffing, just basic jarred Spanish olives with pimientoes, but they were perfect and had an exceptional, unique flavor.",0.9787,0.67,0.285,0.045,0.6789814814814815
2007-11-15,4.0,"La Madia's thin crust pizza is so delicious!!  I went to dinner on a weekday with a girlfriend and we loved the experience.  The ambiance is cozy and the service is friendly but not intrusive.   I would steer clear from the pizza fondue appetizer - it's pretty much just pizza sauce, and not so much cheese - but the rest of our food was amazing!  I had the buffalo mozzarella, tomato sauce and basil leaf pizza, and my friend chose the tallegio cheese and roasted grape pizza - they were melt in your mouth delicious.  The wine list is extensive, and there are pasta options on the menu as well.  But I would definitely go for the pizza.   The valet is $12, but the restaurant is only a block away from the Red Line stop at Grand.  It's also perfectly walkable from the shopping on Michigan Avenue if you need a retail therapy break for a bite to eat.   A funny thing did happen to the table next to us - the waiter accidentally spilled a glass of ice water down the back of a girl celebrating her birthday.  Very unfortunate, but the poor girl was super sweet about it, and I have never seen a manager run across the room faster, to provide his business card and offer to dry clean or replace anything that was ruined.  In the end, she told him it was just water and she was fine, but I thought that was a great managerial response to an innocent accident.   Anyway, I definitely recommend La Madia!",0.9964,0.65,0.268,0.082,0.624910394265233

2007-11-15,4.0,"This review is for the lunch I just had there. The owners invited some of the concierge in the city for lunch today, and I am pretty stuffed right now. This place is 4.5 stars in my opinion. I am ranking it against what else is out there in this area of downtown as well as my favorite thin crust pizza's around the world. What they served up... Arugula Salad- 4 stars, the grapes in this salad were phenomenal, but I thought the dressing needed a little more work. Was more tart then spicy. Oven Roasted Artichoke- 4 stars, The sauces accompanied this dish well. I love artichoke, but wasn't thrilled with the preparation of it. Pizza Fondue-5 stars, Super cheesy(literally), but in a good way. Simple dish, but fun to eat Sausage Gnochi- I did not try this dish, but everyone was oohing and awwing over it. Pepperoni Pizza-5 stars, Wow, there choices of pepperoni were well thought out and the addition of truffle oil made this amazing..even for a non-pepperoni eater Mushroom Pizza- 5 stars, anything will mushrooms has me at hello. Very nice pizza. My favorite of them all Mozzarella Pizza- 3 stars, the Mozzarella was amazing in quality, but the pizza had me wanting more...much more Wisconsin Cookies-4 stars, So simple, fattening and good. I wouldn't order these as my dessert, but I think if they included these as an end of meal complimentary dessert they would go over very well. Pear Pastry w/ Chianti Gelato- 5 stars, OMG, holy shit amazing. I love pears, and Chianti flavored Gelato is fucking genius. Our service was superb, especially for such a large party(16). I eat pizza with a knife and fork, and this pizza is really tough to do that with. Also, the room is very modern California. Not exactly the coziest place, but I kind of like it that way. They do have a pizza bar, which I think is super fun. I also have to give them 5 stars for their wine list. There are some great choices on there. Best part of the meal was sitting between the two owners and hearing their vision and passion for thier establishment.  :)",0.9986,0.724,0.252,0.024,0.6496309523809524
2007-11-13,4.0,"Fortunately I was here specifically for a tasting, so I tried many of the menu items! I'll do my best to give you my take on them and the restaurant. Let's start with the pizza, since this is what they're known for. I found it difficult to pick one favorite out of the bunch. The one with their homemade sausage, peppers, and onions wowed me. I am not usually a huge fan of sausage, but this stuff is awesome. Not too chunky or overly spiced, which I loved. Also the proscuitto pizza won me over. It's hard to handle at first, but it's worth it. Wrestle through!! Apparently everyone at the table liked the salami pizza because they were all raving, but I was not one of them.  Now for the appetizers, order the pizza fondue and the salad with walnuts and pears. Yummy! The pizza fondue is a large portion, so beware. The pastas were excellent as well. We could not get enough of the gnocchi with more of that tasty sausage and the straw & hay pasta was light and refreshing.  The menu may be small, but I've said it once and I'll say it again...If you do something well, stick to it. And they do! That same quote does not describe the wine menu. They have 52 wines by the glass and over 200 by the bottle. BRING ON THE VINO!!  One last important note. The owner sat down with a small group of hospiality professionals for over two hours. I have NEVER seen an owner take the time to do this. Impressive!! They have a dedication to using only the freshest ingredients and providing a fantastic experience. Go in and check it out. Give it a chance, whether it be for the pizza, wine, pasta, or the gelato (which I couldn't stay for, but I heard the burnt caramel is to die for).",0.9944,0.798,0.169,0.033,0.6297902494331066

2007-11-05,4.0,"We were hosting a couple from Pittsburgh this weekend and decided to try something new in the neighborhood and decided on La Madia.  Our reservations were for 10:30 (after seeing The Sparrow at the Apollo Theatre...It was really good!) and we arrived on time to a very busy dining room.  We were seating almost immediately. The menu was simple, but sophisticated.  To start we order the Heirloom Tomato Salad w/ House Made Buffalo Mozzarella and Roasted Peppers.   It was beautifully executed and was delicious.  As far as pizzas go, we ordered the Wild Mushroom, Buffalo Mozzarella with Torn Basil, and the House Made Fennel Sausage w/ Sweet Pepper and Vidalia Onions.  All three of the pizza's were excellent.  We also ordered the Ricotta Gnocchi w/ Sausage which was killer.  Typically you find that Gnocchi is dense because it is made with either flour or potato or both, but this gnocchi was light and fluffy because it was crafted with the Ricotta. With our food we had a Pinot Noir from Friuli that was an amazing value.  The wine menu ranged from value priced to relatively high end and had something for all tastes and budgets.  Very yummy food!  We skipped desert because we headed over to Margies! The space itself was modern and warm.  The music was a little all over the place, but I did hear some Cure and a nice chilled out cover of Bizarre Love Triangle.  The service started off just a tad shaky, but recovered nicely.  All in all a very good experience. 1 Tomato Mozzarella Salad 3 Pizzas 1 Pasta 1 Bottle of Wine ------------------------------------ $100",0.9947,0.762,0.194,0.043,0.6566033966033966
2007-11-05,4.0,"Went here for a light dinner on a Sunday night and thought it was great. My partner and I shared a large salad with a very simple dressing that was just fine. We each ordered a pizza -- a classic margherita with some extra basil and shaved artichoke with garlic. I thought both were great: nice thin crusts, not too much cheese, and a tasty sauce on the margherita.

2007-10-31,4.0,"On my last trip to Italy, I found a small, neighborhood place that served simple dishes prepared with fresh ingredients that you shared with friends over a glass of good wine.  La Madia in River North is just like that place only it's right here in Chicago. I stopped in here the other night to share a glass of wine with a friend to catch up.  We ordered simply- bruschetta to start, followed by a Margherita pizza with homemade mozzarella cheese and one made with spinach, speck and pine nuts.  By the way- if you are a speck neophyte like me- it's kind of like a real fatty smoked bacon from Italy.  Learned something new!  Never mind what it is- it tastes delicious! The best thing about the place?  They must have at least 50 glasses of wine available by the glass starting at about $7 a pour!  So much fun to try out a few different ones and to compare notes. You can create your own pizza with options like Sonoma goat cheese or homemade sausage, order one of their signature pies, or enjoy a panini or salad.  The open kitchen is also a nice touch as you get to watch them cook the wood fired pizzas. All in all - its a bit of Italy with an American accent.  Buon Appetito!",0.9898,0.769,0.199,0.032,0.48984848484848476

2007-10-25,4.0,"Had my first dinner at La Madia last night, and definitely plan to return! This place is about a week old, and the best way to win repeat customers is to give them free stuff!  Before we had even eaten anything, the chef sent over some blood orange ice, which is basically like sorbet.  Yummy!  Fresh and citrusy, and sweeter than I thought it would be.  This is when I started to realize how good my dinner was going to be... I am not a wine expert, but the wine list seemed to be pretty diverse, with some unique selections--Lebanese Cabernet, anyone?  They offer 4oz and 7oz pours of their wines by the glass, which I like.  They also have a variety of cocktails, specially designed by their bartender who has been called The Best Bartender in America, and is apparently a very recognizable name in the field.   Her name escapes me now, but her credentials are still impressive!   My date and I started with the mushroom and ricotta bruschetta.  WOW, those mushrooms are to DIE for, and the ricotta was whipped, making it creamy and smooth and heavenly.  Mmm!   After much debate over which pizza to order, we decided on the salami with basil and truffle oil.  Now, we are both pizza freaks.  I actually have to strictly limit my pizza intake, I love it that much.  I love both NY and Chicago style, fancy frou-frou, cheap $1 slices, everything.  I never thought I would ever describe pizza as light, but that is exactly what this is--light and airy.  Feathery, even!  The salami was literally translucent, it was sliced so paper-thin.  Luckily, they pile alot of it on there!  This is not gooey pizza.  It is definitely cheesy, there was a nice layer of Parmesan on top of the super-thin crust.  I like this pizza because it is tasty and satisfying, without being unbuckle-your-belt filling like alot of other pizzas out there.  The other pizza selections sound quite tasty as well, like the sausage, peppers and onions or the parmesan, arugula and prosciutto.  The gorgonzola and grapes also sounds interesting. Next we ordered the ricotta gnocchi with homemade sausage.  Also very delicious.  I am usually a sauce girl when it comes to pastas.  This gnocchi comes in more of a broth, but it is so flavorful!  The sausage is also great, and the gnocchi had that perfect bite to it.  The portion was not giant, which was nice.  Looking forward to trying the straw & hay pasta next time.  They also offer a variety of panini, which I didn't get a chance to try during this visit.  Dessert.  Our waiter highly recommended the chianti gelato, saying it was the best dessert he's EVER had.  How could we say no to that?  At first I was thinking, wine flavored ice cream, that doesn't sound good at all!  Then he told us it has more of a chocolaty, berry flavor.  I was expecting a big blood red ball of ice cream.  What came out was more greyish, pinkish, with a very unique flavor.  I definitely got more of a strawberry flavor than anything else, but you can certainly pick up a tannin essence as well.  It was very good, surely not like any other gelato I've tried before. The chefs (owners?) were making the rounds, stopping by to check on everyone, and even refilling waters!  I like chefs who come out and talk to their patrons, it really makes me feel like they care about the people they are cooking for, and helps to make people feel welcomed.  A very personal touch. Now for complaints:  This place is barely a week old, so of course there are still service kinks to be worked out.  We had to wait in the bar for a table, and we sat there for about 15 minutes before the bartender had a chance to take our order, which is exactly when we got seated.  Our server was quite knowledgeable about the menu and wine list, and was very personable, unfortunately he was also a bit forgetful.  I was also served a completely cold cappuccino, however he very quickly and apologetically replaced it for me.  The menu says they offer cheese plates, but when we wanted one, they said they don't actually HAVE their cheeses yet.  Hopefully next time!",0.9993,0.764,0.203,0.032,0.5215487528344671
2007-10-25,5.0,"Possibly the freshest ingredients I've had on a pizza anywhere. The service was good (during lunch) and the wait staff was knowledgeable and helpful. Everything about this place is classy, without going over the top. My only (slight) complaint is that on their website they mention they have a ""create your own pizza"" option, and that is not the case. I was able to change their pre-designed pizzas slightly, but there are things they won't do. This is also one of the only places I've found that offers buffalo mozzarella on their pizzas, and it was fantastic.
