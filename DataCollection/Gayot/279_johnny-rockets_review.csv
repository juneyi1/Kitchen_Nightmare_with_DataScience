I could have gone to the Wolfgang PUCK restaurant but I went here instead. The line was crazy long and it was crowded so I figured it would be well worth the wait. The food was not terrible but not on the level of many of the great burger places like In and Out Burger or Five Guys. Being that this was an airport I think the cost of the food was elevated. In a nutshell it was not worth the calorie intake nor the price. Next time at O'hare i will try something different. The location is situated between the B terminal and the E, F terminal.

Food: Original Burger ($5.29):  In the grand scheme of airport food, this burger was ok.  It wasn't Coyote Jack's in Toronto airport, but it hit the spot.  Cooked well, good toppings.  Definitely a step above McDonald's and the price was good for airport food. Vanilla Milkshake ($5.49):  Maybe I'm broken since NYC is the most expensive place ever to get a good milkshake, but I was totally thrilled with the shake.  It was huge and delicious and they spared me of the whipped cream.

All that being said, you have to hope for a good burger flipper, as it's easy for some to overcook/undercook the ground beef when orders get hectic and people are trying to make their flights.  I've also never tried their chicken products so I can't speak for that area.

Warning, this is not fast food.  I waited about 10 minutes for my burger to come up.  Compared to your other dining options like Chili's Too it could be called ""quick"" but this is not the place to grab something hot while running to the plane.  My order was the classic Rocket Burger with the American Fries.   The Fries were just bleah, sized in between a steak fry and shoestring but lacking any real flavor.  I had to add two packets of salt just to get any emotion out of these guys and I usually don't add salt to chain store fries at all.  Even with that the potato reemained rather starchy and not toi interesting. But the burger was bangin'.  Soft white bread roll appropriatlely sized for the two well done and juicy paties.  Fresh tomato and lettuce and cheddar cheese.  Yes cheddar cheese.  Maybe everyone else in the buger loving world know that there was still somewhere to get cheddar on a burger but I did not.  What a totally welcome surprise.  The burger itselt is surely worth 4-5 stars.

It did not take long for our order to come up. They had our orders mixed up on the two trays - my burger had the Onion Rings and the fries were with the Cheese Steak. No problem - easy to switch. But they did not listen and had piled a lot of onions onto the Cheese Steak Sub - which led my colleague to scrape all of the onions off the sandwich. My burger was reasonably tasty. The fries, however, were only lukewarm and tasted like they had been sitting a bit. I did get a chance to taste the Onion Rings, they were crisp and hot - pretty good.

So, the buns were kind of greasy, but they tasted really good.  I could taste the butter they used went toasting the buns.  Maybe not too healthy but it tasted really good.  The burgers were also extra greasy, which was kind of like, yuck, but man, they have some flavor.  Yummy.  So overlooking the grease in it all, it was a very tasty burger.  It just seemed like they need to clean the grill every now and then.  But maybe they do that to add to the flavor....just don't think on it too much and you'll be OK. The fries were actually pretty good.  They tasted fresh and didn't have any oily quality at all. Seating is kind of hit or miss.  How clean the tables and bars are is mostly dependent on how good the customers clean up after themselves.  This is airport traffic so make your on guess as to how well this works out.
