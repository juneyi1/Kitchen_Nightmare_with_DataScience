2005-09-27,5.0,"This is a small, hidden restaurant. Its amazing! This place is really nicely decorated and has a very sophisticated atmosphere. And the food here is very good. They have a large menu, that has many different options. The chocolate chip cookie dough egg rolls are definitely worth a try here! And if you pay your bill in cash, they give you a 10% discount. A great place to go for a yummy meal!",0.9791,0.667,0.317,0.016,0.6174458874458874
