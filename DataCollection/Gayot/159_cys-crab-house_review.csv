2010-08-26,1.0,"This is what I drafted while waiting: ""At the restaurant right now. We've been waiting for nearly an hour for our food. The people who have sat after us are wrapping up their entrees. Oh, now the food arrives. But why the hour wait for a sandwich, lobster bisque, and one crab cake? Bisque is lukewarm and tastes like cream of tomato...crab cake is good but not worth the wait. I really can't tell if this awful night is due to incompetent server or kitchen staff...definitely not returning."" Here are my thoughts now: Now, occasionally the long wait and bad service will happen, and I understand this will really impair my judgment on the food. But really, it's not worth it.  The soup is still the worst lobster bisque I've ever had.  It looks more homemade, but really it lacks in lobster flavor.  I didn't finish most of it even though, after an hour, I was starving.  The crab cake was delicious (full of crabmeat, less bread), but the deliciousness to service ratio is not the kind of the soup nazi or san soo gab san phenomenon.  The service is really that bad, and the food is not enough to make up for it. Now for the service...RE: Whether the server or the kitchen is responsible for the miserable wait. I can now say it was definitely the server who was incompetent. She kept asking us if we wanted drinks repetitively forgetting that she asked before, but still managed to walk over with someone else's drink order.  Thirty minutes past our ordering, we're twiddling thumbs on our empty table when she comes up to ask how everything is. Now, if I were this server I wouldn't ask how my nonexistent food is, I'd update them on how long it is going to take and why and apologize. See at this point, I'm still thinking it's not her fault the food is taking forever - the kitchen might just be busy.  However, after eating OK food, we just wanted the check and made that very clear that we wanted the check immediately.  Ten minutes later she returns asking if we want dessert.  WTF?  No lady, please, just let me go home already. We got an apology from her at the very end explaining it was a bad day.  The manager also checked on us at the end because I think it was quite apparent we had a dose of awful service.  That's a nice touch, but it really doesn't give me any faith that another experience here can improve by much.

2010-08-23,2.0,"I bought a gift certificate for Cy's through  restaurant.com  and was really excited to try it out! I've read other reviews before about it being a bit dumpy, but my fiancee and I thought the atmosphere was cute. When we got there, we asked if they could put the Sox game on and they were nice enough to do so, on a few TVs. However, I was really disappointed in the service. My fiancee got his soup right away, and I got my shrimp cocktail about 15 minutes later, which I thought was odd. Our meals were both OK - nothing to rave about (he had crab stuffed shrimp and I had angel hair with grilled shrimp). But, the service took more than an hour on an empty Saturday evening and we were really frustrated. What capped it off is that our server was hanging out at the bar talking to the bar tender most of the time when we needed bread, refills, etc. Plus, I think for what you get, Cy's is very overpriced. We had 2 drinks, 2 appetizers and 2 entrees. Without the gift certificate it was over $80! I think if you plan to spend this much, you should go to a steak house and have better seafood with probably better service.",0.8979,0.809,0.119,0.072,0.4680357142857143

They are obviously going for an ocean theme, but the wood planks everywhere are old in a bad way. It just feels a little stale and in need of an update. Its been said before but the garlic pita triangles are out of this world. The 6 of us at the table practically inhaled them before we even ordered our dinner. I ordered the crabcake sandwich with a bowl of lobster bisque. The bisque was deliciously creamy, with a hint of heat. The crabcake sandwich, was ok, but a little bland. The fries that the sandwich came with were also average. Others at the table ordered King Crab legs, which looked awesome.  Prices were a little high, considering the casual atmosphere. My meal with the sandwich and soup (excluding drinks) was about $20. The crab legs were $32. You would pay the same for seafood at a more upscale restaurant.  Overall, it wasn't a bad experience.

I went with my mother, wife & infant son on a Saturday around 6pm and was a little surprised at how many tables were open, but with the economy the way it is...  We got the crab cake, shrimp cocktail & oysters for apps and while it the crab cake & shrimp cocktail didn't blow my mind, they didn't disappoint either, however the oysters were some of the best my wife said she ever had. For the main course I got the ""Slab & Crab"" which was BBQ ribs with crab (forgive me oh fooide gods for forgetting which type of crab) the ribs were damn good and the crab was cooked perfectly the veggie side dish seemed to be an after thought, but with ribs & crab galore who cares about veggies?

As for the food...not much I can say here either.  We started out by ordering a dozen oysters and I am pretty sure the ones I got from Jewel and made myself were much better.  Needless to say...we opted to get the $2 burger for our meal which is probably your safest bet at this so-called ""seafood"" restaurant.

2009-08-28,3.0,I've been to Cy's twice now and I think it's pretty good.  It's not my most favorite seafood restaurant in the city but it's worth going back to.  The first time I was there I had the lobster and potatoes.  It was good- I've had better.  I figured the lobster just wasn't in season.  I was dying to try the King Crab but I didn't feel like getting it all over the place.  The Mediterranean nachos were very good and the free pita bread was excellent.  The service was ok- could've been quicker on the drink return. The second time I was there was a few days ago on a week night.  It wasn't very crowded and we had a group of 10.  I arrived last and I must've waited about 15 min before I ever saw a waitress.  I was dying for a beer after walking there and the wait was insane.  We finally motioned her over and it was another 5-10 minutes before my drink came.  We did enjoy the pita bread and the nachos again.  I ordered a steak kabob with mashed potatoes and I was given what appeared to be a beef kabob and a baked potato.  I didn't complain because I was starving and just wanted to eat.  The entree tasted good and I told myself I'd try something else next time.   One of these days I will try the crab legs and re-post.  I hope the service is a little better next time.,0.9814,0.743,0.179,0.077,0.49119999999999997

I actually went around the block an extra time because I thought it was closed. We were literally the only people in the place other than the staff. The plus side is that the small parking lot was empty as well. Note that there's also a sign for another parking lot across the street but I did not verify this. Anyway, the interior feels like any other sports bar with perhaps a more nautical theme. We sat near the entrance but I think there's another larger seating area. There's also outdoor seating, but for whatever reason, the waiter told us it wasn't available yet. I think he was just too lazy to set up a table and go outside to get our orders... He was otherwise pleasant enough but with no one else to attend to was a bit eager. We ordered the lobster bisque, a blackened hawaiian swai (it's a type of flounder, similar to sole) off the menu and crab cakes. The bisque was surprisingly flavorless with too much celery...actually probably the worst I've had, and given that this is a seafood place, not very impressive. The swai was excellent, being both very fresh and perfectly seasoned. I like pretty much any fish blackened, but this was a special treat. The crab cakes were good, but not amazing and certainly not worth 10 bucks a piece. Anyway, wouldn't come back here anytime soon though it wouldn't be the worst. Didn't actually have any crab, but it seemed somewhat overpriced considering the buffet deals you can get at some places (23 for a pound of snow crab??). Could be worse, but could be much better.

On our most recent visit, I discovered a fly in my butter...which I didn't notice until after I had some, partly due to the dim lighting.  Most people would have freaked out, made a scene, called the health department, etc.  I was really cool about it.  The host stopped by because I guess we had that look like we were looking for our server.  He quickly whisked away the fly butter without a word.  We laughed it off.  Shit happens.  The server brought out another butter.  What really gets me...there was no apology, nothing.  They completely blew it off.  I didn't expect my ass to be kissed or a free meal or anything.  But an apology, and maybe a round of drinks or an offer of dessert on them would have been appropriate.  But they charged us full price for everything, and quietly sent us on our way.  Maybe I should have made a scene.  Another time in the dead of winter, it was clearly apparent as soon as we sat at our table that their heat was not working.  I don't know...if I ran a restaurant and knew the heat wasn't working, I think I'd give a heads up to potential customers before seating them.  We sat there bundled up and ate dinner.  Another time, we were having a drink at the bar after dinner.  Some employee...not sure of his function, but he seems to maybe manage the bar or something...was bitching, moaning, and making fun of a difficult customer wihin easy earshot of us and other patrons.  Completely unprofessional.  I totally understand that people suck and it's good to vent to your co-workers, but not in front of customers!

I cannot trust you with the more challenging dishes until you get the little, less complicated ones down pat. Cy's needed to gain my trust back. I called in my order and spoke to some guy who told me - in a rather harsh way - that I didn't need to call in for the lobster bisque and it could be prepared in a minute upon coming into the restaurant.

He wasn't too happy because he found it difficult to eat since they had split the shrimp open but had kept the shell intact. It made for an interesting presentation however was difficult to eat. The crab legs were puny and over-cooked. I've had better. But I still enjoyed them. The ribs were ribs slathered in a semi-spicy sauce. I'm not a huge rib fan generally but I enjoyed them.

So in summary, this place had awful service (for Sunday lunch), mediocre food that made people sick, and was pretty pricey.",-0.3054,0.855,0.073,0.072,0.6160714285714286

The bartender/server was friendly and attentive.  He did make a mistake on our order (wanted garlic mashed instead of baked) and he totally made that right.  Got us the right potatoes just a couple of mins after the main part of the order came and he comped it, so no complaints at all from us on that.

My scallops arrived (in what seemed like an inordinate amount of time) burnt and greasy. How you can manage to make grilled scallops greasy is beyond me. The scallops lacked flavor, but were served with a plastic ramekin of some runny brown liquid. Upon smelling the liquid I determined it to be soy sauce. SOY SAUCE!?! Really? Have you ever been served soy sauce with scallops?  So if you were thinking ""the food is bad, but this restaurant must have SOME redeeming quality"" you would be wrong. To echo elizabeth h., the decorations are straight outta gilligan's island. Now, while this kitchy seaside decor might be cute in a real seafood joint on the east coast; here, its just tacky.

By no extent was it a gourmet experience, but when you're in for King Crab, it doesn't need to be. The less a place does to their King Crab the better. 99.9% of the crab you'll get in the city will have been previously frozen. So, really, you're asking someone to steam it for you and leave it next to some drawn butter. Cy's does this without any bother. The difference in the King Crab you'll get at an upscale place versus Cy's will be minimal (excepting the price). The meat will taste almost the same. BUT, at some fancier places they'll have the spikes on the crab legs cut off to make it an easier and more enjoyable experience to eat. At Cy's, you get the un-trimmed legs, spikes very much in tact. You'll wish you brought gardening gloves. Once you figure out that three layers of napkins will allow you to eat the crab without bleeding, you're just fine. Service, eh... marginal.
