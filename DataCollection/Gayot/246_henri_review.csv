A great friend and I had our own mini degustation with wine pairings that was simply outstanding. As my friend and I have discovered, trusting the server to come up with the menu and the wine pairing creates a winning meal every time. Homemade bread. Diver scallops. Escargot bourgogne. Split pea soup. Duck cassoulet. Nettle Ravioli. Cafe au lait. Banana souffle. Three tier chocolate mousse. One of my greatest French dining experiences in Chicago was at a certain French restaurant in Evanston. After going ot Henri, that Evanston restaurant had competition.

I am very, very, sorry to hear that it is transitioning to another concept but I will keep an open mind. It is so difficult to do fine French in an unpretentious way and this restaurant nailed it.  The night we dined there we enjoyed the chef's tasting menu - lobster mouse, fois gras, cod with fava beans and a rhubarb consommé, squab with ramps..etc., - and all beautifully paired with some organic/biodynamic wines. They sourced from: Gunthorp Farms, La Belle Farms, Maple Leaf Farms, Nichols Farms, Sustainable Greens Farms, and Swan Creek Farms. Again, I am so sad that they are closing.

2014-04-13,5.0,Henri superseded my expectations! They were the only restaurant willing and able to accomodate me and my 18 other guests on a Friday evening  for my fiance's surprise birthday dinner. The ambiance and decor was elegant yet modern. We sat at a table overlooking Michigan avenue in very comfortable velvet chairs. It was very quaint and classy. The staff was very attentive and helpful. A few guests had questions regarding the menu and our waiter explained the entire menu to them. They were also very patient as several of my guests were late.  Now to the food. This was our first time having French inspired cuisine. My fiance and I thoroughly enjoyed the appetizers. We ordered the roasted foie gras (duck liver) and the albacore crudo. Not only were they succulent but the presentation was mesmerizing. They were very whimsical looking. For our entrees we ordered the rack of lamb and the monkfish bouillabaisse. The lamb was very tender and juicy and accompanied by sweet potato. The monkfish reminded me of a soup or gumbo because it contained lots of seafood such as huge prawns and mussels in a broth-like sauce. Delish! For dessert they provided my fiance with creme brulee and it was also decadent! Crispy on top and light and creamy underneath.   The night couldn't have been any more perfect! I felt the pricing was reasonable considering it was an upscale restaurant and the portions were fair. The only downside was that they did not have valet parking!! :( ..By it being located on Michigan Ave one would  expect valet. Fortunately we were able to find parking on state street and walk over after sometime of searching.  One will not be disappointed dining at this lovely one of a kind restaurant!

The foie gras and pork belly were both absolutely delicious.  I wish I could remember the name of the drink I tried (I think it was a winter season drink and may no longer be on their menu), it was served over a bed of warm smoky cedar chips, which sounds like it could be one of the most pretentious drink presentations ever but the taste was absolutely wonderful. The French 75 was not bad either. As for the entrees - the lamb was not bad but the goose cassoulet was all wrong - most of the goose was chewy and the beans seemed undercooked.  Looks like they have changed to rabbit cassoulet for their spring menu, maybe bunny meat will improve their cassoulet situation.  But other than that, my Henri experience was pretty darn nice.",0.9857,0.765,0.204,0.031,0.593576388888889
2014-03-20,4.0,"Had dinner there last week, and both the food and service was great. Smallish room, but nicely appointed. My only concern is their apparent lack of control over who is allowed in. Specifically, there was a couple at a table near us with two very small children (guessing around 1-2 years old). The couple was dressed extremely casually (jeans, polo shirts, etc.), and had two strollers at the table. Call me picky, but if I'm paying $300 for dinner, I expect the restaurant to demand at least dress-casual attire, and no children under, say, 10. Fortunately, these children were quiet, but if they had been screaming, my wife and would have walked out. I realize that class is a waning thing in Chicago, but come on, you can at least try. Letting people like that in is inconsiderate of those who do. If I want to eat in a diner, I'll do that and pay a heck of lot less for dinner.",-0.4138,0.827,0.079,0.095,0.5038095238095238

He was professional, friendly, and attentive. The food, of course, was delicious, but he made it so much better. The owner even stopped by the say hello. What stood out to me most was I mentioned to the waiter that I really enjoyed my drink- a tea based alcohol drink. When we got our check, he cut out the blurb about the drink from the menu and included it for me to take home! It included the history of the drink and all the ingredients. That was truly going the extra mile. This showed me that this is a restaurant that cares about its patrons.

We were early enough that the bar area was empty, so we asked to be seated there.  Opened the lush menu, loved they gave paragraph intro to each cocktail, and then in bold writing, write exactly what was in the drink.  I ordered their version of Hot Toddy.  Easily the best tasting Hot Toddy I've ever had.  It was complex, it was restrained, it was delicious.  On the side, before you drink it, they give you a teaspoon of butter.  Yes, butter, with spices such as anise.  You mix it in and then enjoy the buttery drink.  I easily recommend it during the winter season.  The other drink I got was Spanish Eyes, a riff of Old Fashioned.  Again, refined and complex.  Well crafted and enjoyable.   I would come here again just for the cocktails.  Probably never for the food only because I'm not sure about vegetarian options.  Oh and the decor here is lovely, refined, old world French.  This place is nice, place is one where manners would never be out of place.  You'll do well to dress appropriately.",0.9947,0.787,0.189,0.024,0.5199206349206348

Everything in this restaurant is great except the most important part - the food. I was very underwhelmed for every dish that crossed the table. I expected the food to actually taste good since it's a nice restaurant and my friend really liked it when he ate here. The food was very different from other tasting menu restaurants. Not gastromolecular, but more ""old fashion"" actually. We were the youngest couple or people in that restaurants, everyone else were much much older... Think parents to grandparents. The only thing that actually tasted good were the bread (I ate tons of those!) and the most delicious tasting souffle on earth. My boyfriend was sad to hear that I didn't like the food, but I told him the souffle, ambiance, and service made up for it all. I would 150% come back again just for the souffle. I was detoxing from alcohol, so I didn't try any of their drinks. But Henri is known to make great cocktails. The couple next to us absolutely loved their cocktails.

2013-10-28,2.0,"This was my second visit to Henri. I was looking forward to taking my in-laws who are lovers of French food. To my surprise, they had dramatically changed the menu, removing the Coq au Vin, the traditional French dish as well as the bouillabaisse. The dishes we ordered - my in-laws had the quail, my husband ordered the Ttoro, and I ordered the block new york steak, were quite good. My issue is specifically regarding the service. Our waiter was extremely rude and condescending.  He was terse, looked around the room when speaking to us, and acted all together ""put out"" to be waiting on us.  It was rather shocking and I, having brought family there, was embarrassed.  My father-in-law (a well educated physician) even expressed disbelief that our waiter was treating us as though we didn't belong there. Yes, I don't speak French but I don't speak Chinese or Japanese either and have never been met with such disregard in those types of restaurants because I don't speak the language. Nothing is so expensive as a missed opportunity. I hope the management will take the initiative to correct this behavior. I will not return to Henri but rather satisfy my craving for French food at Chez Joel . . . . .  superb food and outstanding customer service.",0.9611,0.801,0.135,0.065,0.4049715909090909

2013-10-25,2.0,"I dined at Henri alone, hoping to self-congratulate on a work-related triumph.  Expecting to spend major $$$ and also enjoy a great meal, I found myself rather disappointed.   - Ambiance (4/5) Classy and romantic, this is a perfect place to take a date or a cozy intimate setting for some close friends.  However, I personally found the place a little dark-- reading the menu became difficult, and it was very hard to see the food.  Everything on the plate just looked yellowish. - Service (2/5) While the service is professional, I wonder if I did something wrong.  Did I commit a cardinal sin and dine alone, thus robbing the waitstaff of an additional person's revenue at a 2-person table?  The tables around me all got detailed descriptions of their food when served, which would have been tremendously helpful given the poor lighting.  I was also never asked about my food, which would have been rather important, given my comments below.  Did I eat too fast?   - Bread (5/5) Piping hot and with great butter, this was a delight.  In the future, however, I recommend that the staff wait a minute before bringing it to the plate, because it was bordering too hot.   - Soft Poached Egg, $14 (3/5) The egg was poached beautifully, and the presentation gorgeous (as far as I could tell).  After taking a photo, I confirmed that the plate did indeed look colorful.  However, one might complain that the dish as a whole was under-seasoned, with hardly any flavor development.  I could say it had clean flavors, or I could say it was bordering bland.  What saves the dish is the various inventive components.  The summer squash wrapped around the ricotta mousse might have been the best component on the plate.  The mini croutons also added a nice texture among a lot of soft textures.   - Sturgeon, $39 (4/5) The sturgeon was cooked beautifully and seasoned just enough so that there was good flavor, and yet the fish could speak for itself.  The other components on the dish were pretty... but not very distinct, nor memorable.  I'm sitting here right now not really remembering what it is exactly I ate.   - Woodland Mushrooms and Knob Onion, $8 (1/5) Easily the worst item I ordered.  How do you mess up mushrooms and onions?  The mushrooms were so heavily salted that I, a self-professed mushroom lover, could not finish all the mushrooms.  I'm still downing water right now.  And the onions?  I expected soft knob onions, not crunchy, bordering raw onions, that packed that familiar onion flavor... the chef who cooked this ought to be fired.   - Mini Lime & Coconut Profiterole, Free, (5/5) Easily the best item I didn't order.  I suspect it finishes all meals, but it was a welcome surprise.  The gooey lime center and the coconut top all packed a great flavor punch that I found missing throughout the meal.  A great finish, but perhaps too little, too late.   - Value (2/5) Given the significant food errors and the somewhat less exemplary service than what other tables were getting, I find the price tag to be much too high.  High prices demand high quality.  This didn't cut it. If you look at the totality of the meal and the potential Henri exhibits, you might find a 2 star rating to be extremely harsh.  However, the comparative service and the mushrooms really just did Henri in.  Had the sturgeon or poached egg been WOW dishes, we could have saved this rating, but as it stands, I can't give it more than 2.",0.9959,0.769,0.166,0.065,0.6056775453462201

The sweet fruity flavors, tangy citrus and bubbly are pulled together well into a well balanced and refreshing cocktail.   We started out with the Escargot.  They weren't delivered in the traditional dish where the escargot are drowning in puddles of butter.  Instead the chef had a nice butter sauce drizzled on the plate with each piece placed on a crouton and topped with fresh baby greens and dill.  I loved the melding of dill, butter and the texture of the crunchy crouton.  The best way I've ever had Escargort. After asking the waiter reassured me the Chicken would be as good as it sounds I ordered it.  The breast was tender and flavorful with a nice sauce poured on when it arrived at the table.  Next to it was a Truffled Chicken and Veal tongue terrine with greens.  Again great flavors and well paired with the chicken. My friend ordered the NY Steak with sweetbreads.  The steak was flavorful and cooked exactly as she requested.  One side it was paired with sweet breads - again the chef is a master of pairing flavors and textures that tantalize your palate. Wasn't supprised to see Brussel Sprouts on the menu which are poppling up on menus everywhere. We ordered a side of sprouts which were traditionally prepared with a bit of crunch and a buttery flavor but nothing about them stood out to make me beg for more. Triffle was great with layers of creamy whipped custards, cake and a variety of berries and crunchy fruits.  Wasn't overly sweet, flavorful and fresh.  Perfect for a summer day dining en plein air.   Terrace is a bit noisy but you'd be kidding yourself it you didn't think that would be the case given it's on Michigan avenue.  They do a nice job with plants to create a privacy border that provides a break between diners and passerby's on the sidewalk. Inside the restaurant is what you'd expect a formal french salon feel.  The service is attentive and does a good job describing the dishes and helping you choose something that fits your taste and mood.   Most the patrons when we were there were older couples dressed for fine dining and business men.  I'd recommend it for a serious quiet dinner where you want to have a nice quiet meal focused on savoring the food and cocktails. Would be happy to go back since I'm sure the meal will be well executed and flavorful.  Just seems like it's a couples place to go.",0.9978,0.804,0.19,0.006,0.6160493827160493

We started with the White Sturgeon Caviar which was obviously delicious and perfect. Oysters as an appetizer which were excellent. My entree was the duck which was right up there with the duck at the 4 seasons in NYC Our server Mike was wonderful and very knowledgeable about pretty much everything we asked. He suggested a specialty gin cocktail that I tried which was very good. Rene was very courteous and helpful as well. So here is my one minor complaint.  The 2-top tables in the rear of the restaurant are very close together in my opinion.  There was a couple sitting at the table right beside where we were being seated, I asked to be moved. If we had sat there, it would have been way too close. We sat at a 2-top on the other side of the restaurant and both tables next to us were empty. I'm not sure how my evening would have been if it was full and I had to hear the conversations of two different tables. If I (+1) ever come again, which I plan to, I think I'll request one of the 4-tops (if they allow it). So once again,everything I ate here was perfect.

2013-04-21,5.0,"Absolutely incredible evening last night. The wife and I dined at Henri to celebrate our anniversary. I had heard great things about the food and the non-pretentious service - and we were not disappointed.  We enjoyed the 6 course tasting menu with wine pairings and it was excellent.  The wines were expertly matched and were a perfect complement to each course.  The presentation of the Foie Gras with mustard, hazelnut, and gooseberry was memorable, as was a very creative Kampachi with a cucumber sorbet.   While the food was at the level you would expect from a higher end French establishment - what needs to be most commended is the service. Our server Rich was attentive, engaging and very friendly. Jason the wine director personally poured the wine for each course and was very conversational and interactive with detailing each wine.  We spent almost 2 hours savoring our meal and our interactions with the staff - truly a great experience.  The one knock against Henri is that it is a bit small and though we had a reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes to be seated. Normally we don't mind, as we like to have a pre dinner cocktail anyway. However the bar was very small and full with patrons eating at the bar. However, the staff was very accommodating and apologetic and even comped us a couple glasses of champagne for our troubles.  The issue seemed to be that many of the tables were finished with dinner, they just didn't want to leave.  We will most definitely return and recommend.",0.9923,0.793,0.183,0.024,0.5905952380952382

I have noticed some restaurants do not have the same standard of excellence in food and service during promotional times like Chef Week or Restaurant Week. Although this is my first time having gone to Henri so I didn't have any baseline to compare the food or service, I can't imagine the service being any better than the way I experienced it during my visit. The staff really made it known several times throughout the meal that they appreciated us being there with such a gracious and welcoming manner. They are the epitome of extraordinary service.  On to the food and decor. This place is super gorgeous without being too over the top - simple, elegant and pretty.  Out of the items we tried, we really enjoyed the chicken liver mousse and the chicken ballontine on baguette.

Beautiful chandeliers hang throughout the space and the soft blue-grey colors create a dining room boudoir-esque feeling that is comfortable but formal.

Imagine walking into this beautifully lit small intimate setting of a restaurant and the hostess already knowing you who were by name the second you walked in the door. It may have been a guess, but it was still very impressive and made it feel like we were friends upon arrival. What I loved is how small and intimate this restaurant was, it felt like you were in someone's beautiful dining room rather than a restaurant. The atmosphere is beyond romantic, and it will have you instantly connecting and staring off into your loved ones eyes. Even if you are celebrating something as small as your 5 month anniversary, and don't mention it until you get there, they will bring you complimentary champaign to make your night feel special. Another thing I absolutely loved was the waitress herself. She would give you ample time to decide, and would pay attention to when you were ready and would very quietly and intimately come over the corner of your shoulder and ask if you were ready for something else. It was so polite and even when the waitress came, it would never interrupt the conversation or romantic and intimate atmosphere between you and your date. And of-course the food was absolutely delicious. The steak tar tar came with a quail egg to be poured over it, which was so yummy- and I am not use to eating something so different or sophisticated.

I thought the service from our waiter could have been better, but the rest of the staff in the restaurant were all very helpful and nice. The dining area is small, but cozy and beautifully decorated.  I went here for my anniversary and we were allowed to be seated early, given free champagne, truffles for dessert, and a personalized menu that had the date of our anniversary. We were easily the youngest people there, but we didn't feel out of place and the dining experience felt very much private even though we shared a public dining space.  We ordered the steak tartare, lobster, and veal. They were all beautifully prepared and tasted amazing.

All in all, Henri is very good, but it is far from the best restaurant I have ever been to.  If you are looking for a good meal with great service, you should try Henri.  For a truly exceptional experience (flavors and service), you should try Melisse (Santa Monica), Restaurant Guy Savoy (Las Vegas), or Michael's Gourmet Room (Las Vegas).  Still, Henri is a good restaurant with a good price point.",0.9954,0.763,0.214,0.023,0.6146296296296296

Well, I would like to say I was thrilled to break my streak, but it kind of wasn't the case.  Don't get me wrong, the meat was a fantastic cut of meat, the au Poivre they pour over the steak is DEVINE, it was the massive amount of peppercorns on top that tainted the dish...ever so slighty mind you.

For starters, we had the Tuna Pavé and the Smoked Steak Tartare.  Both were absolutely delicious and items we would both order again in a heartbeat.  I loved the richness of the quail egg over the tartare.  The tuna in the Tuna Pavé was so fresh and well seasoned.  For the entree, we had the 14oz Rib-eye and the Venison special.  Both again were very good.  I had ordered the rib-eye medium well, but it came out more on the medium to well-done side.  The venison was cooked to a perfect medium well.  I thought the vegetables that accompanied the rib-eye could have used a bit more seasoning as well as a bit more sauce for the rib-eye.  The butter was suppose to melt over the rib-eye, but the butter was a bit too cold and didn't quite melt like I thought it would.  For dessert, we decided to split a strawberry dish that I can't remember and wasn't memorable.   I had pretty high hopes for Henri, but after the starter dishes, everything else fell a bit flat for us.  In addition, service was a bit slow.  If I am ever in Chicago, I do want to come back and try their brunch as I love a good Croque Madame.

We had a party of eight, so we did the seafood tower, then ordered appetizers and entrees, which we shared a bit so that I got to try a few things. Everything I tried was excellent. Crown tower of seafood -- great way to try a bunch of seafood, though my faves were the oysters and lobster salad, which can be ordered a la carte. There was also some kind of fish that was prepared to look like ceviche. I usually love ceviche, but it wasn't at all citrus-y, so I'm not sure I'd call it that. Smoked steak tartare -- basic but solid, a generous portion. Lobster ""Wellington"" -- lobster and foie gras in yummy, flaky balls of pastry.  Butter poached lobster -- also basic but very solid. I liked the little chunks of beets, and since I asked for no mushrooms they made mine with tiny slivers of haricots verts. Yum. The only thing I would say is that they need to either have a better waiting area, or make sure that the tables are ready at the reserved time. We arrived a few minutes early, but the table still wasn't ready when our reservation time came and went.  Since there was nowhere to wait, we ended up having to stand around by the entrance, right next to other diners' tables, which couldn't have been great for them.

Our waiter steered us correctly. We did not go away hungry!  Hubby had the soup of the day. It was a curry cauliflower with shrimp soup. It had such wonderful flavors and was very rich. I had a grilled calamari in a tomato cream sauce. It came with grilled bread which helped me get every last drop of the sauce. yum. I had a grilled black sea bass for my entree. It had crispy edible skin and a tomato olive sauce/side. Excellent! Hubby had a veal dish. He felt it was a tiny bit rare, but loved it and ate every bit of it. We were celebrating... so they brought us out a creme brulee. Hubby and I don't normally like creme brulee, so at first I was disappointed. As we cracked into the sugary top, I thought we might as well give it a try. OMG! We devoured it! It was a nice large flat one, so we didn't need to fight over the burnt sugar topping.

2012-04-02,5.0,"I was so very excited to try Henri as I know it had the distinction of being picked as the Top 50 Best Restaurants in the World (for 2011 I believe...) Having said that, my bf and I went for lunch on a Friday afternoon, and I was surprised at how small the restaurant was. It is decidedly very French and I am glad we got a seat by the window with great views (partly blocked by the patio) of Millennium Park.  What I am most pleased and amazed is the offer of complimentary still or sparkling water!!! We were offered fresh warm bread with churned butter with a bit sea salt and omg, my bf couldn't stop raving about how tasty the butter was. We would have eaten the butter itself if it didn't make us look improper *pinky up.* We had Rich as our server and he was absolutely fantastic. Everything was Yes Ma'am with a smile! He recommended a white (name escapes me but tell him what you fancy and he will hit the nail with the perfect wine pairing). He provided us specials of the day (soup and main course options), and my bf and I both had the sandwich special of the day which was a white fish ceviche with fava beans and grapefruit in between the most soft and buttery brioche bun. YUM! For appetizers, I had the foie gras which was not HEAVY in any way (2 round pate's) and my bf had the bacon pizza which he devoured the WHOLE THING because it was that good. Rich was very kind in offering us complimentary dessert which just made him that much more wonderful! This place is absolutely darling. The service is impeccable and the opposite of pretention and obnoxious-ness. Every waiter had his part and played it right on time, from the bread being served on time to water continually being poured so that the glass was never empty. Never intrusive, but someone was always there when you required something. It's very intimate and small - just the way I like it.  I would love to come back here and I wish that Henri could pick up and move itself to Toronto. Lunch for two including a bottle of good white and scotch and dessert wine and full course came to $196 which, although expensive, was worth every penny.

The food was good, but I wasn't wowed. Then again, I'm kind of a tough crowd. We all started with their soup du jour which was a celery root and fennel puree with lobster, pomegranate, and pieces of fennel.  I thought this soup was beautifully done and really tasty. The pomegranate was such a unique combination with the celery root and added great texture to the soup.  The lobster was also cooked perfectly. For my main course I had the buckwheat crepes, but I was really underwhelmed. It was good, but I was expecting something with a more complex taste and I felt like the crepe, mushrooms, etc. all blended together in a somewhat bland way unfortunately. It certainly wasn't bad, but it wasn't my favorite. If I hadn't ordered the soup I'd probably be giving Henri 3 stars, but the soup was definitely the perfect thing on a cold spring day!",0.9926,0.692,0.252,0.056,0.6968571428571428

We then ordered the bacon flat bread, which really didn't fit - it was very tasty but just didn't work with the rest of our dishes, and that was entirely our fault. I had the Saturday special, Pork tenderloin, that is now tied for the best pork dish I've had on this planet (the other was from Gerard's in Lahaina, Maui, Hawaii) - I was literally moaning with each bite. My husband ordered the duck, and he said it was the best duck he's ever had - and he's had a lot. We ordered a bottle of the 2009 Gevrey-Chambertin Grand Vin de Bourgogne that was so perfect with our meal - we even took a picture of it so we could remember to buy it elsewhere.  Our wonderful server ended up bringing us the almond cake (not actually the name of it, but those were the ingredients) as a complimentary dessert - I was in HEAVEN! It was the last dessert choice I would have made on my own but probably the best thing I've tasted in a long time - ok, rather since I had taken a bite of the pork tenderloin. We also finished the meal off with a delightful cheese board.  Seriously - mouth watering and a bit glutenous (in a good way) from beginning to end. And what we really loved about it was the fine dining atmosphere w/o the stuffiness. The wait staff was so friendly and laid back, but professional at the same time. The manager made his rounds but in a casual way. We spoke with the very friendly sommelier, who obviously helped us pick out the perfect bottle.

2012-02-05,4.0,"My partner and I went on a recent weekend evening and had the ""Chef's Indulgence Menu"" (i.e., the tasting menu) with wine pairings. Ambiance: I feel ambivalent about this experience. With a broad view of the asphalt face of Michigan Avenue, it's hard to feel particularly cozy in the small dining room. The primary entrance is through a lobby shared with the other tenants of the building. Coat-check is via someone standing at the door (who you think's going to take you to your table). The decor seemed either non-committal or out of the way - I suppose it can go either way. I liked the close seating arrangements, although the wait staff might move about more elegantly in the tight quarters.  Service: Two or three of the courses were brought out without an initial explanation, which came only after our primary server got around to it, and one course left us entirely guessing (though that was fun, too). The timing of the courses was also a bit off - I'm accustomed to the next course/wine pairing following the end of the previous course's wine, but there was both overlap (a new glass of wine while we're still finishing off the previous wine?) and gaps (sitting around waiting for the next course and, I guess?, eating bread). Food/Wine: Generally, I think these worked. In most cases, the food and wine worked very well together - the amuse-bouche, for example, paired a champagne with an oyster carrying a spicy garnish, resulting in what I can only describe as a firecracker, and an unusually dry red that didn't make much sense by itself completed the thought started by the main course. In other cases, we were left guessing.  The food itself was generally quite good. The only course I struggled to understand was the second, consisting of squab (a leg and wing, I think?) with shaved truffle, a poached egg on creme fraiche, and a sprig of a green whose name I can't quite recall. Clever, but I'm not sure it all worked together. Every other course had a coherence and a statement that I could appreciate, well-executed and well-presented, but not adventurous. More wry remarks than revelations.  Bottom line: I definitely enjoyed myself, but I am going to keep looking for a Chicago restaurant that really knocks my socks off.",0.9558,0.883,0.083,0.033,0.43407367324033985

2012-01-10,4.0,"I'm writing this review not because Henri needs more accolades or needs to know how I felt about my recent experience there, but because I'm feeling sentimental and want to relive that night.  It was ten days ago.  You can be sentimental about young memories, too.    Let's talk about the things I saw.  The dining room, which is one large room, has one wall of windows overlooking Michigan Ave. and the southern third of Grant Park.  Inside it's pretty, pretty, pretty.  The chandeliers are embraced with a satiny translucent bronze band, which look attractive and do attractive things with the lighting.  You will look attractive, is what I'm saying.  The color palette is what I'd call femme-mellow: aqua and cream with velvety brown.  Technically, I also saw my husband there and he, too, is easy on the eyes.           Let's talk about the things I ate.  First I had a simple green salad with Roquefort, grapes and pistachios.  Luckily for me, Mr. Beth D. has a thing about fruit in salads so he did not attempt to eat any of mine.  It was a salad made of the Jolly Green Giant's hand-picked, superior mesclun leaves - truth.  Later I flipped a coin and ordered the Sullivan chicken, which would have been phenomenal without the extras (truffles, salsify) but was that much more special with them.  It was so moist and the skin was so light and crisp I actually brought it up more than once afterwards.  Chicken you talk about?  Yes, if it's this chicken.   In case you were wondering, the other side of the coin was the buckwheat crepes with creme fraiche, vegetables and mushrooms.  Next time, little crepes, next time. Let's talk about the fact that there was a girl there in the exact same dress as me.  I didn't care.  I had a river of goodwill hormones flowing through my veins.  Also a strong cocktail (the Negroni, by the way - the only thing I would not order again).  By the end of the meal, we were discussing phase III of our NYE and were both disinclined to leave Henri.  We lingered over our coffee and dessert longer than usual, but I imagine that happens more often than not at Henri.  It took some discipline to get up and walk into the buzzing city night but we rallied.  I hope we can make Henri more than a once-every-365-days event.  S'il vous plait?",0.9969,0.816,0.167,0.017,0.5414596273291926
2012-01-06,5.0,"What an unparallelled dining experience, in all the best ways. At my uncle's request, my husband and I joined him for dinner here on a Wednesday night. He's an experienced high-end diner, and wanted a little something different. Although no tasting menu was offered that night, our waiter tracked the chef down and the chef agreed to prepare a tasting menu ($95). 7 courses, and they even accommodated our request for a mostly vegetarian with some seafood selection. The first course--fresh oysters, with an unusual topping of a vinegared mix of onions, shallots, and was there mangos?--was accompanied by a champagne cocktail with strawberry caviar. Amazing. This was followed by tuna tartar, mussels in gorgonzola sauce (the standout of the night!!), mushroom and barley crepes, lobster, and a cheese course. The dessert was a rich mousse encased in dark chocolate with ice cream and cocoa nibs.  But that was just the food, and we all know that the food is only part of the experience. What put Henri over the top was the service and the wine selection. Our waiter was professional but completely approachable, and incredibly knowledgeable about the food and wine. He brought us wine pairings with each course, including a white burgundy (basically a dry version of Sauternes) that knocked my socks off (we bought two bottles for ourselves the next day). The cheese course came with Domaine Dupage, a great local beer. Dessert came with port. Going here on a Wednesday night was probably a great idea--the evening was slow so our waiter was able to make us feel like we were the most important people in the room (which I'm sure he did for everyone else as well).

2012-01-02,5.0,"Here was New Year's Eve number two with my inestimable treasure, as of two weeks ago now my wife.  NYE #1 was fun and unique, but I wanted to make this one elegant, and at least equally memorable, to celebrate the fantastic year that we had.  Matinee tickets to Elizabeth Rex at one end of our outing, a quiet and romantic midnight at home at the other end...I needed an exquisite dinner in between. Henri turned out to be a sagacious choice to make our New Year's Eve special, not through ostentation or ebullience, but simply by a brilliant execution of the classic fine dining experience. Service was perfect throughout; this staff expertly strikes just the right tone in all aspects.  The smallish space is decorated gorgeously, the music smooth and cool with a twinge of fun and good humor, and the crowd charming and convivial but not boisterous.  Again, the room strikes the perfect balance between calm and intimate and energetic and engaging. Of course the consumables should always be the main attraction, and at Henri they do everything wonderfully.  The French 75 (a NYE semi-tradition of mine) was tempting, but I started with a very nice, modestly innovative and well crafted cocktail called the Henri Presse, made with rye whiskey, lemon, and a couple of obscure French liqueurs.  I am particular about the kinds of cocktails that I consume just before dinner, and I decided that this drink fits the bill perfectly even in winter but would also satisfy on spring and summer afternoons.   The bread is phenomenal, just as at The Gage, but, enigmatically, it seems not to be the same kind.  Am I mistaken?  How could they possibly have found the two best breads in all the land?  Genius, if so.  The chilled shrimp was rather plainer than I expected, but excellent nonetheless.  I eagerly ordered the evening's special soup, a cream of cauliflower over braised whitefish and lobster with shaved black radish and a scoop of caviar.  The soup was absolutely amazing, probably my favorite item amidst a meal comprised only of great successes. I had looked forward all week to the pork loin, but our waiter informed us that the daily special entrees had been set aside in favor of several dishes presented specifically for the occasion.  I found worthy recompense for my disappointment in the marvelous venison loin, with sunchoke and trumpet mushrooms.  My lovely dinner partner shared several bites of her ""Sullivan Chicken,"" both the roasted white-meat portion and the delicious, rich, dark-meat fricasee with winter vegetables.   And of course dessert.  By then I just wanted to sit there and bask in the glow of a magical night out with my beloved.  French press coffee--Kenyan, my favorite--and an imaginatively refreshing dessert:  coconut pavlova with Meyer lemon curd, topped with hibiscus-candied pineapple, and poppyseed streusel and basil sorbet on the side.  Wow. What a wonderful way to spend two hours.  It was the jewel at the center of our perfect New Year's Eve.  I hope to return again soon, special occasion or otherwise.",0.9997,0.648,0.331,0.021,0.6462685202121822

There are white tablecloths, a Ricard dispenser poised at the small bar, and wait staff who spent a lot of time zooming around with their cordless irons.

2011-07-11,5.0,"Thinking back on it, this is a 5 star place; everything was strong and there were simply NO flaws whatsoever. That's just as difficult, if not more so, to achieve than maintaining a few excellent merits.  Food: Elegant, sensible, and well constructed. We started out with a chilled pea soup/puree with various pea related things and a few flowers in it. I was taken aback when one of the ingredients was actually frozen; however, when I bit into it my apprehension ebbed as it created this incredible and instant burst of refreshing, intense, savory flavor (I don't remember what it actually was unfortunately). Otherwise, it was a pea broth flavored with shallots with gobs thick pea puree and flowers, and - well it sounds kind of odd but it was just an outstanding summer dish. We also had the mushroom and raclette ""pizza"" which was HUGE, easily enough for 3-4 people as an appetizer. I hate mushrooms, and even I loved it.  I ordered the veal special with black raspberry reduction, turnip foam, sauteed morel mushrooms, and asparagus. Everything was just perfect, flavors complimenting each other and leaving complex and dynamic lingering flavors in your mouth as I ate it. My companion had a roasted chicken, which, as boring as it sounds, was PERFECTLY cooked. Chicken can actually be somewhat difficult to cook to perfection, too much and it dries extremely fast, to little and you'll be in the bathroom all night. The chicken also came with asparagus puree and these potato disks flavored with butter and saffron, just an amazing side dish. The creme brulee was rich but subtle, and delicate - just as it should be. Presentation was amazing.  Service: this place ran a clinic on good serving. Even had special menus printed up with my name on it for my birthday, and comped the dessert -- classy. Ambiance - very elegant dining room and accoutrements  All in all, nothing made my eyes pop out of my skull in disbelief, but everything they did was perfect. That feat warrants 5 stars. What sets places like this apart is the fatigue your mouth feels after the meal has concluded, as if your tongue had actually exercised while all the tastes  still resonating in a subtle yet noticeable buzz around your mouth.

We've been fans of the fare at its older next-door sibling, The Gage, for quite a while, but the noise & crowding at The Gage are not our cup of tea. Henri is light, open and comfortably elegant. The service was excellent: cordial, articulate and knowledgeable, with no hint of snootiness or austerity. The food was exemplary. Our salads were superb in every respect: a special tomato tart with greens could not have been better, nor could my companion's arugula with stone fruit and pork belly. My pheasant special was as good as I've had anywhere: a perfectly moist breast roasted with a stuffed thigh was plated whimsically with small whole beets, artichoke puree, black currant reduction, fresh red currants, morels and chanterelles -- all superb. My companion's sole meunière was fantastic, as well. Wines are pricey, as is everything here, but the few that we had by the glass were very nice. My only regret is that we arrived a bit late and didn't have time for dessert. I can get good bistro fare at half the price in other local venues (Kiki's, Bistrot Margot, Red Rooster) -- but Henri is well beyond standard bistro. Call it ""haute bistro,"" perhaps -- it is in a league by itself. I cannot afford to dine at Henri on a regular basis, but when I'm looking for very good food, well prepared and presented in a relaxed, conversation friendly, comfortably elegant setting.

2011-05-15,4.0,"Had dinner and drinks with a party of four on Saturday night. Immediately, the staff set the mood with impeccable service. Attentive, unobtrusive, keeping the dinner flowing. You hardly noticed them unless you needed them -- the sign of a great staff.  I gave our waiter, Rich, my cocktail preferences, and he brought one of  best cocktails I've ever had the pleasure to drink (Linch Pin). All of the cocktails I had throughout the night were spot on, but the Linch Pin stood out with its sublime balance of floral gin and Pineau des Charantes with a perfectly paired orange peel. I had the special appetizer (potage aux champignon) and dinner (roasted boar). The soup was delicious -- an earthy, complex dish with a microgreen garnish. It can be hard for a vegetable soup to stand out, but the quality of ingredients shone through here. I had a bite of my brother's torchon au foie gras, which was an immensely creamy yet gamey pate. Top notch. The boar was good, not great. It was a rather lean loin, not terribly flavorful.  However, the accompanying ramps and morels were phenomenal, more than making up for a merely adequate piece of boar. One of my fellow diners had a similar opinion of the dish.  For desserts, I sampled the chocolate tart and a pate au choix with a praline/caramel ganache. I'm not a dessert person, but the quality of both were apparent. I felt like the pate au choix needed something to wrinkle its texture a bit, but was otherwise delicious.

2011-05-14,5.0,"What a gorgeous restaurant, what a gorgeous room, what a gorgeous wine list and menu! Talk about basking in an aura of utter civility. This is Michigan Avenue, baby, take-no-prisoners elegant dining. Step up your game. Dress for it. Act like you belong there. 'Cos well, I - at least - do. At one table, a guy with crazy hair and expensive glasses - the newest sensation of Chicago's art scene with his patrons? At another table, the scion of some giant company, total captain of industry with his well-preserved, subtly Botox'd wife. Another table, old money, speaking a foreign language impeccably dressed, impossibly elegant older couple dining quietly. Loads of accolades for this place: 2011 Best Restaurant, Best Chef, Best Sommelier. Also recipient of Erika G's 2011 of Restaurant Interior I'd Most Want To Live In. Chandeliers, a gleaming bar full of complicated cocktails and handsome waiters, when can I move in? It looked like a European salon, something in a venerable old Amsterdam canal house. Restrained. Strict, yet accessible elegance. Like you were born into it. But, if you think you're entitled to it, you're not - this is not a restaurant for you. Enough about my interior design obsession. To start, I had a delicious glass of Pinot Gris. Dry, woody and what I like to call ""watery"". I know, it's my word for describing wine that makes me salivate. In other words, yum. We started with escargot, because who doesn't love those garlicky bastards. Classic appetizer, and there's a reason. They're wonderful. My entree was the Truffle Poached Lobster. I want to sleep with this entree and rub it all over my body. *ahem* I was edging into inelegant territory as I jammed this bad boy in my eager mouth. Not really, I kept it together - though my eyes were rolling back in my head with ecstacy, but wow. Wow. I've had lobster that was much more expensive than this, and not half as good. A juicy chunk of meat (yum) sitting on a bed of greens and woodland mushrooms. With teeny little beets. Love the beets. My incredibly gorgeous dining companion (she's gorgeous 'cos she's my cousin) had the Roasted Veal Loin. My stolen bite of that confirmed that it was perfectly prepared, juicy and delicious. A red meat alternative, with parsnips and beets. Who knew parsnips were so delicious? I do now! It was around this time that the tall, handsome owner came over to chat with us. 'Cos that's what happens in our world, gorgeous chicks get attention. Very friendly owner, dressed in a suit that required me to order another glass of wine. Yum. Then, being a perfect gentleman, he sent over dessert for us, a sort of hazelnut concoction - mon dieu decadent! I'm in love with Henri.

2011-04-04,4.0,"Henri is the sister restaurant of The Gage, located next door, but it's the polar opposite in many ways.  For starters, it serves (duh!) French food; the noise level is much more reasonable, and the ambiance and service are decidedly more upscale.  I walked in and the decor immediately impressed me. The walls are rich shades of chocolate brown and sea foam green, and the sconces and chandeliers are beautiful. It's quite simply, a stunning space.  I was meeting a friend for lunch and I selected Henri after reading about their Croque Monsieur in the Tribune only the day before. I adore a good Croque Monsieur and was most anxious to try the one at Henri.  Since the sandwich itself is on the decadent side, my friend and I thought it best to split it and pair it with something lighter like a salad. That way, we would still have room for dessert. Oh yes, this girl is always thinking ahead to dessert.  The kitchen was nice enough to split both items in the kitchen, which I always appreciate. We were each given a good-sized portion of a lovely, mixed greens salad, with shaved vegetables and truffle vinaigrette. I loved the salad with its bright and fresh flavors, but I would have liked to have been offered freshly ground pepper and was not. It wasn't a huge deal, but it's something a restaurant of this caliber should always offer.  The sandwich was lush and rich, and came with a side of their delicious frites with garlic aioli. I'm so glad we decided to split the sandwich as it was the perfect amount of food. The ham in the sandwich was salty; the cheese nutty, and the bread was dense and eggy. The Tribune nailed it when they put this on their ""best sandwiches"" list. Next up, I plan on trying their Croque Madame, which is the same sandwich, but topped with a fried egg. How good does THAT sound?  As I mentioned earlier, I am always thinking ahead to dessert and all of their desserts were calling my name (most notably the Paris Brest), but also wanted to keep it on the lighter side. I was most intrigued by the fresh fruit in Chantilly cream. Again, they separated each portion for us, and it was the perfect finale to our lunch--diced kiwi, ruby red grapefruit and blood orange segments, and a few berries, all in a pool of lovely whipped cream accented with notes of vanilla. I may have a hard time ever getting around to trying the Paris Brest since I enjoyed this dessert so much.  The service is definitely fine-dining (they iron the napkins and tablecloths in between seatings), but without the snooty factor. On the contrary - it was engaging and accessible. Billy Lawless, the charming Irish owner, even stopped by our table to check on us. From the moment I made the reservation to the hostess thanking us for coming in when we left, everyone made me feel welcome.  I can't wait to go back.

I had the crisp veal sweetbreads appetizer with caviar and black linguine, which was also great. My rabbit special wasn't spectacular; the braised portion tasted to me like so-so pulled pork from a BBQ joint. My wife's pheasant special was good, though. Finished it off with creme brulee and a chocolate tart, both of which were good. I like that Henri has a selection of original cocktails, and not just beer/wine/liquor. Our server was absolutely outstanding. Friendly, personable, funny, pleasant, helpful but never hovering, etc. My wife and I decided that he was the best server we've ever had in Chicago!  Decor is fancy without being too prissy or rococo. The seats are luxurious and very comfortable. Overall, I'd say that Henri's sister restaurant, the Gage (also headed by chef Dirk Flanigan, one of my favorite restaurants in the city), is better, and certainly more affordable, at this point.

The debonair duo lured me into this sophisticated South Michigan Ave. lair on a blustery Wednesday afternoon with the promise of lobster and wine.

My FFF was already sipping a whiskey sour and suggested I try one of their handcrafted cocktails.  I was spellbound as I watched the rock sugar slowly dissolve in my mesmerizing Apero champagne cocktail: a tantalizing blend of champagne, rock sugar, bitters and fresh kiwi. As I reached for the menu, my FFF informed me that he was going to order for me. Ok, go right ahead playa...and thus ensued the lobster orgy. For starters, I had the lobster and butternut squash soup which was a delicate, yet rich combination of two of my favorite flavors. Next up was the chilled Maine lobster. Need I say more? And for an entree I had the lobster club which was served on brioche with applewood bacon. After I took my first bite, all I could hear was the ominous voice in that video game,  Mortal Kombat, saying, ""FINISH HER!"" So I did. Delicious doesn't even do this creation any justice. One would just have to try it for one's self.  FFF ordered the torchon of foie gras for starters and the sweetbread with vinegar gastrique for an entree. As we sampled each other's food in almost complete silence, we knew the sighs, grunts and groans were code for, ""Life sure is great.""

I've been at Henri for cocktails.  It's my favorite place right now for craft cocktails.  I've been to the James Beard House preview dinner.  But let's not talk about special events here on Yelp.  I had dinner on Valentine's eve, and it was a truly magical evening. Cocktails.  There is an emphasis on grape-based spirits, which no one else is doing here.  At least not at this level.  The Burnham Mahattan.  Rye, vermouth, and tiny, luscious maraschino cherry.  Dutch 75.  Genever, lemon, blanc de blanc.  Like drinking a cool soda on a sweltering day.  Sullivan's Wake.  Gin, grappa, fernet branca.  Refreshing, bitter, a tonic.  Pineau des Charentes.  A perfect aperitif, and an even better digestiv.  Marcel La Pierre Morgon Beaujolais.  Nice young red cutting through the richness of the Wellington puffs.  Bernard Defaix Chablis.  Perfect brightness for the Dover Sole, and Pheasant. Starters.  Smoked Steak Tartare, Quail Egg, Potato Chips.  The beef is cold-smoked, lending an interesting flavor.  The house-made chips made it seem like one is eating nachos.  The meat might be too coarsely chopped, a minor quip.  Wellington of Lobster, Foie, Duck Gastrique.  3 little puffs, not the traditional slice.  I've read complaints that it is too soggy.  I found it just right.  Reminded me of dimsum.  The duck gastrique I wish I can just lick off the plate. Mains.  Dover Sole Meunière with autumn vegetables.  Classic fish.  Sauce of butter, herbs, and lemon supreme, poured tableside.  You know, Meryl Streep as Julia Child in rapture?  It's like that.  The tiny lemon wedges gave a nice kick, and a modern touch.  The Game of the day was Pheasant.  Breast meat seared skin-on, thigh rolled in medallions with a pheasant mousse center.  Hedgehog mushrooms.  Mini beets.  I was in hog heaven. Paris Brest.  A little ring of dough.  Balls of hazelnut cream, with nuts.  A cloud of cotton candy.  And that little hazelnut crusted in spun sugar, the tail sticking out like a comet.  Heavenly.  Celestial.  (See photo). The service.  One feels pampered like royalty.  They were so attentive it's almost psychic.  Our waiter was talking to us, and noticed a slight wobble on the table.  He immediately got an insert, and got down on the floor.  The manager came by to talk to us multiple times over the meal.  When setting up a table, they iron the tablecloth after it's been laid down on the table.  Who does that? Why 5 stars?  The food at Henri is rooted in classic French, with modern interpretations.  Service is painstakingly attentive.  Elegant and chic room.  This is fine dining at its finest.",0.998,0.793,0.18,0.027,0.49439585357952703
2011-01-31,3.0,"I've been dying to try this place since it opened.  The decor is really cool, but for some reason, I think because of the layout, it felt like I was eating in someone's living room.   The iceberg salad was nothing special.  If anything, it was a bit difficult to eat since it wasn't as much a wedge as a few giant lettuce leaves.  The lobster club was definitely a fork and knife sandwich.  While it was tasty, it didn't knock my socks off.  Later on in the day, my friend and I,  who also had the lobster club, wound up not feeling so great.",0.9389,0.763,0.172,0.065,0.5301587301587303
2011-01-31,5.0,"The Gage grows up. Not that The Gage isn't already sophisticated, lovely and fabulous in its own right, of course... it is. However, Henri, the newly minted jewel of Gage owner, Billy Lawless, is positively everything that The Gage is not. Replace its unapologetically masculine dark wood, leather and brass with unadulterated elegance, simplicity and pristine classiness in this next door sexy sister locale. Not to be mistaken as a femme exclusive haven by any means, it's just a different - and far more well-groomed - vibe up in these positively stunning and chic digs. Let me put it this way, you would take a first date to The Gage for drinks, and a fifth date to Henri to seal the deal. Impressive, striking and lovely beyond compare, I'm fortunate to have found this intimate dining gem with my own gem, twin Caroline A. We adored the attention to detail found in the gleaming chandeliers, harmonious tones of teal and white, inviting velvety seating and hand steamed tablecloths of this small, but cozy, space. Henri manages to nattily elevate an already fine dining experience. Fine dining made... finer? Fine by me. Discover beautifully plated French-inspired fare leaning a bit more towards resourceful than traditional. The innovate twist on items such as the fresh Oysters presentation served with salmon roe sorbet, and the lobster and foie gras-stuffed puff pastry ""Wellington"" positively sing on this undeniably appealing menu. Entrées of Fig Glazed Duck Breast with a Goat Cheese Tarte and a more Français-familiar butter laden Sole Meunière were positively rich, but divine to the utmost and executed flawlessly. Twin and I relished (delicately as can be, natch) in each morsel while dually exchanging glances of utter satisfaction and delight at the joy of such tasty gluttony. More, please!  ...and more we had. The ideal complements to such true tastiness were easily found in our Sommelier suggested '07 Jaffurs Grenache - juicy perfection! - and a sweet, sweet treat, the Paris Brest dessert, a light-as-air pastry with a heavenly prailine filling and delicate dusting of sugar. Textbook dining excellence realized. Henri is without a doubt my new paramour, which I guess makes The Gage my old ball and chain. I love them both dearly, but am guiltily far more titillated at the thrill of my new lover.

2011-01-25,5.0,"Pure awesome.  We had a number of different items, which ranged from very good to unbelievable. The foie gras terrine: three thick slices of creamy buttery foie deliciousness.  Served with lightly toasted brioche, this was simple and nearly perfect.  The foie was amazing, but unfortunately it was paired with an apricot jelly that I personally found to be far too sweet and way overmatched for the terrine.  Fortunately it was easy to eschew the jelly for my second piece. The stone oven potato pissaladiere: Don't be fooled, this is a large flatbread.  It's a beautifully done pizza, with a light but chewy thin crust, some delicious sharp raclette cheese, wafer thin potato slices that bring a welcome taste and texture, and very thinly sliced virginia ham that is crisped into a light but salty almost crunchy topping.  Even though this was our second appetizer and probably could've fed my fiance by itself, we were unable to restrain ourselves from finishing this delicious item. The House made pappardelle: wow.  juuuuust wow.  Thick, wide, clearly homemade noodles that had the full mouth sensation of really great pasta, in a divine cream sauce that managed to carry the full flavor of the yellow foot mushrooms, the lobster, and some (cognac?) cream without being obtrusively heavy.  This is a large, delicious plate of food, and the presentation with lobster pieces resting vertically sticking out atop the pappardelle made us gasp in awe as it was brought to our table.  This dish blew us away. The game of the day was a rack of venison.  It always amazes me when restaurants manage to cook a piece of meat so uniformly perfectly all the way through.  My rack of venison consisted of two chops, that were of quite an impressive scale.  Each of these perfectly cooked, rich deep red chops could have eaten three or four standard rack of lamb chops for breakfast.  They were gently seasoned, and served in what I was told was a juniper berry jus, that provided the perfect complement of savory to get in there and stand up to the meat.  Don't ever underestimate venison. Finally, the service and personal touches at Henri were amazing.  I had called ahead to let them know it was my fiance's birthday, and when we got there they presented us with personalized menus wishing her a happy 29th.  They also sent us a creme brulee on the house at the end of the meal (which we were in no shape to take down).  We could not have felt more welcomed.",0.9991,0.739,0.25,0.012,0.6603420908593322
2011-01-23,2.0,"I had a sub-standard dinner here, with defects in both conception and execution.  The first courses were beef tartare and lobster wellington.  The beef was served with a side of potato chips.  The idea was good, but the dish was poorly executed.  The beef had been cold smoked somehow, and would have been excellent if someone in the kitchen hadn't mixed in a phenomenal amount of salt.  The potato chips were undercooked and chewy in the center: so the chef hadn't even bothered to check whether the oil was sufficiently hot.  Lobster wellington was riff on the old beef dish: a small piece of lobster, with some foie gras, wrapped in puff pastry.  I don't see how this dish could possibly work: either the pastry would be undercooked, or the lobster and foie gras overcooked.  The chef, perhaps wisely, decided to go with the former option.  What he should have done is abandon the whole dish and make something else instead.  And perhaps we shouldn't have ordered it, but we wanted to see whether the dish could be made successfully or not.  Not - at least in this kitchen. For the mains, we had quail and Dover sole meuniere.  The sole was prepared in the following way: a fillet was dredged in flour, shallow fried, and then served with additional meuniere sauce poured over it.   In sole meuniere, the fish is usually cooked on the bone, and the reason is that in a plain preparation like this an important source of the flavor and texture of the finished dish is the bones, which make the flesh firm and almost meaty in texture.  And the fish needs a strong flavor to withstand the robust pan-juices.  Cook the flesh away from the bones and it is often slightly bland and spongy (flaky at best) - exactly what happened!  And usually the dish is completed simply with the pan juices.  Pouring additional sauce (presumably specially prepared by the chef) over the fish made the flour soggy and unappetizing. And something was wrong with the way the quail was executed.  There were supposed to be two quail, one stuffed, one plain grilled.  There were one and a half: one stuffed with so much bacon and sweet potato that the meat was entirely overwhelmed, and half a grilled quail.  Neither was cooked even remotely rare (which is what I had asked for, and can easily be achieved). Bill, for two, with wine and some cheese: $450.  I could have made a better dinner at home. Two stars, rather than one, because the wine list was excellent, and the waiters enthusiastic, charming, efficient and informed.",0.9955,0.84,0.139,0.021,0.5300983436853002
2011-01-12,5.0,"My 1,000th yelp review goes to this very special restaurant. Henri is elegant, sexy and absolutely exquisite. I was completely seduced by this beautiful restaurant and hope to come back many times again.  We had a late 9:30 reservation and were seated right away after they whisked our coats into the back. We sat down at our table and enjoyed the gorgeous scenery... high ceilings, sparkling crystal chandeliers, crisp white linens and beautiful crown moldings on the walls with beautiful columns dividing the dining room. The walls are covered with soft chocolate brown velvet, and the sea green chairs and benches give the room a nice vintage charm. Every table is smoothed out with a hand-held steam iron before setting the silverware....definitely something this OCD girl can appreciate. Perfection!!  Our handsome server, Zach, gave us some fantastic recommendations on the menu. Henri's menu offers French inspired dishes that are wonderfully prepared. Our meal included the following: + Wellington - A puffed pastry filled with lobster, foie gras, gastrique. This dish was beautifully presented, hot and melted in the mouth. Recommended by Zach as the one thing we have to get, we loved it! +Oysters Mignonette - We loved them so much, we had TWO orders! Six fresh raw oysters (Kumamoto and the other one escapes me) were served with a traditional mignonette, Meyer lemon and salmon roe sorbet, cocktail sauce and an apricot mignonette. I could have eaten just the oysters all night they were so delicious! + Fig Glazed Duck Breast with a goat cheese ""tart"" with fig and grape + Dover Sole Meunière with steamed autumn vegetables - the sole melts in your mouth with buttery goodness!  + Side of butternut squash.  For dessert, we went with a Paris Brest, a beautiful pastry with a prailine filling. Brests are the best! Totally worth the calories!  Our meal was served with a bottle of a 2007 Jaffurs Grenache, a nice pairing recommended by their sommelier.  Following our dinner, we sat at the bar, and sipped wine and different liquors with the bartender, Clint. The staff was super friendly, chatty and fun.

It was rich in flavor and had a healthy portion of lobster along with delicious house made noodles. For my main course I had the venison chops which were the wild game special for the night. These were cooked medium rare to perfection and were one of the most tender pieces of meat I have ever had (which is saying a lot considering it was wild game). For dessert we had the creme brulee which was very good and paired it with two dessert wines which were recommended by our waiter.

Ok--so Rahm was not sitting with us, but dining at another table a few feet away with two of his advisers, but still he was there and I caught him looking at me a few times (that's right--yes, he did! and not because I was staring at him.) Decor here is beautiful--brown tones, aqua blues, plush seating, tufted chairs, elegant lighting--if only my living room looked like this. Unlike its sister restaurant the Gage, Henri is quiet, serene, and sophisticated, however, we felt like we were the youngest people there. Some of those spry diners were up way past their bedtime.  My friend and I both agreed that while the ambiance and decor were great, the food did not step up to the plate. I ordered the steak au poivre with crushed potato, vegetables, and peppercorn sauce. The vegetables were wilted and the steak was good but not great and the fact that it was served only lukewarm made it that much worse. If it's cold out, serve me my steak piping hot. My friend ordered the fig glazed duck breast with goat cheese tart, fig and grape. Again, it was good but not fabulous and the portion was really small. We shared a side of roasted butternut squash which was not special at all. The dark chocolate tart we had for dessert was probably the best thing we had all night. Presentation and decor alone do not get you points. If the food is not good, I won't be coming back. I'm going to have to disagree with the other reviewers here and even Phil Vettel.

As a nod to my French heritage (OK, more like my British-Hong Kong heritage) I ordered the Escargot appetizer - seasoned perfectly with clarified butter, herbs and garlic - accompanied by freshly toasted croutons. Delicious, so delicious that I was using the side of my fork to scrape off all the baked herb bits onto my croutons!  My main dish was the NY Strip....seasoned and seared perfectly and accompanied by a white cheddar skinless potato. The dish also came with a tarte of sauteed mushrooms on a buttery pastry cup. Tasty.

I eat out often, so it takes an over the top experience to win that extra star and Henri pulled it off without a hitch.  We arrived for our reservation (make one for if you don't, you probably won't get in as this place is intimate and popular) and were quickly greeted, our coats and umbrellas whisked away and then we were shown to a round table for 4 by the front window looking over the park.  The walls are covered in a dark chocolate colored fabric. The flowing draperies, a celadon green, and that coupled with the crisp white table cloths make for a lovely room. Even the chandeliers delight with an interesting mix of crystal drop chandeliers with a fabric shade. Hard to believe that this is by the same owner as the Gage next door with it's dark wood and subway tiled walls.  Our server was terrific! He knew his stuff steering us toward a wine that is bottled for the restaurant (quite nice) and accommodating the varied menu requests from those in our group.  We started with the escargot served with toasted bread and the raw oysters of the day. Terrific.  We also split an order of the lobster pappardelle which came in individual bowls and had the staff pouring over the sauce to each individuals taste. All I can say is ""why did I suggest splitting this?"" it was just that good!  Entrees were perfectly paced. I went with the Florida Red Snapper and my friend had the veal chop. Both were beautifully prepared and again- one of the best meals I've had in a long time. The chef, Dirk Flanagan has done a beautiful job with the menu and his love for food certainly shines through.  Before we left- we had to have the mille feuille (layers of raspberries with cream and pastry). Light and delicious- a perfect way to end our evening.  Dinner with drinks and dessert ended up being really reasonable (around $100) per person which was amazing given the quality of the food and experience.  Many items on the menu are MP (market price) so be sure to ask before you order but most entrees are in the $30 - $40 range. If there was any hitch in the overall experience it is in the parking situation. Know that if you drive- there is no valet parking at the restaurant. You can valet park around the corner at the University Club on Monroe, or you can park it yourself in the North Grant Park parking garage under the park. Go all the way to the south end and take the pedestrian exit marked Monroe Street which will put you street side on Michigan Ave virtually in front of the restaurant. Just know that that option is pricey as it runs $27 for the few hours that you will be there.  The other confusing thing is know that the entrance is through the revolving door to the overall building, not the individual fire exit door that is just south of there. We saw plenty of people trying to get in the other door and confused as where to go.  Finally- we had a chance to meet Billy Lawless, the owner, who was there, walking around welcoming guests and inquiring about the experience. A nice touch, I must add. He was gracious and welcoming, like it was his own home he had invited us into.  Thanks Billy, for a perfect evening. And one final note- when they returned my coat to me from the coat check, I swear it was warm. Illusion or not , being helped into my warm coat before I headed out into the rainy night was just the icing on the cake of an overall lovely experience!",0.9979,0.829,0.152,0.019,0.5698002660689229

2010-11-30,5.0,"Henri is either the most elegant bistro in Chicago, or the highest value fine dining experience in the city.  Its hard to say, but why don't you join me for my dinner and decide for myself?  Either way, you'll find yourself delightfully impressed with your own refined taste. Henri leans toward elegance upon first visit because of the subdued, high end decor of the dining room.  The ceiling and pillars are white and airy, accented by chocolate walls, with chairs a soft, creamy mint and a bit of a lounge to them, making for a very relaxed time at the table.  This is all tied together with a gorgeous hardwood floor.  The room is much smaller than I expected, but that made it quite intimate, yet airy.  Noise levels were quite low, even with the small size of the room.  The air of the room was deliciously elegant with no hint of stuffiness. The cocktail list will make my fellow bourbon boozers very happy, indeed.  Classic cocktails made with rye - I enjoyed both an Old Fashioned and a Manhattan - and a small but unique bourbon list.  For more selections, The Gage, next door, would be more than happy to oblige before or after dinner.  Kelly had a Cinq à Sept, which was good, but being a grapefruit vodka concoction, was a bit tart for my taste. Tonight, being Thursday, I was hunting rabbit.  Rabbit consomme for starters, and the oven roasted rabbit (the Thursday special) for the main.  I highly recommend dining on Thursdays, because the rabbit is some of the best I've had in the city - the loin is wrapped in house bacon, and the skin on the leg is crispy and caramelized and unlike any rabbit I had tasted before. Kelly had the butternut squash soup with goat cheese stuffed grapes, followed by the Dover Sole Meunière.  I can say without hesitation that the Dover Sole was the best fish I have ever eaten - the fish was firm and meaty, just a touch flaky, as it should be.  The sauce had just the right amount of butter for eye-rolling richness while avoiding that overwhelming, stomach weight feeling one can get from inferior preparations. For dessert, we shared the three scoops of ice cream - dark chocolate, vanilla, and pear.  The chocolate ice cream was creamy and rich like a light pudding.  The pear ice cream tasted just like pear - crisp, refreshing, divine.  I never knew ice cream could be so good. The wine list eschews quantity in favor of quality - a little unnecessarily, in my opinion.  The sommelier, Shebnem Ince, limited the list to wines that are produced biodynamically - which, to oversimplify, takes organic processes one step further to include, for example, farming by the rhythms of the seasons.  I've had several biodynamic wines, and while they are all excellent - old world in style, deep sense of terroir, very food friendly - it certainly isn't the case that non-biodynamic wines cannot also exhibit that strong sense of place sought by Ince.  And thus, several excellent wines are eliminated from consideration.   That quibble aside, the Crozes-Hermitage I had was superb.  The wine list appears to be subject to change, because the Crozes I had a mere two weeks ago is no longer on the list on the website.  Henri is tricky, though - they've replaced it with a Domaine de la Janasse - one of my favorite Chateauneuf-du-Pape winemakers, and a rare one at that - virtually guaranteeing a return visit. If you enjoy good wine and cocktails as we do, dinner for two will tally in the $200-300 range, including tip - high for a bistro, but half the price of Les Nomades, Everest, and the other elite French restaurants in the city.  Henri hits a sweet spot which I don't think we knew we were missing, and by doing so is probably the best French restaurant in the city. The only downside, and I leave this for the end, is no valet parking - which is especially irksome because the only viable parking is underneath Millenium Park, more than a jaunt than I would like.  Factor that into your meal when you arrive here, or take public transportation or a taxi.",0.9993,0.758,0.199,0.043,0.529216395418927

2010-11-20,5.0,"Wow!  I would say besides Alinea  (that is really not a good comparison as the experience is so unique) this is the best meal I've had in Chicago.  The waiter, Brett, was probably my favorite waiter of all time- very nice, knowledgeable, passionate and accommodating.  We got there for our 7:00 reservations right on time and were seated in a couple of minutes.  The restaurant is small, but looks very cool on the inside and has a great vibe with just the right amount of noise. I was also very impressed by the extensive scotch list.  I tried both a Japanese scotch that was very interesting, as well as an 18 year Chivas (wow!).  They also have some VERY nice wine by the glass.  My wife was able to enjoy a glass of Chardonnay ($140 bottle) for $18!  The drinks were fantastic throughout the night.  After I finished my 2 glasses of scotch our meal was coming out and I wanted a nice, buttery cab.  They didn't have anything quite like that.  They brought me two different tastes, and neither impressed me.  So they went to the brother restaurant, Gage, and brought me an 8 oz glass of the cab I was hoping for (only $14!).  That's some customer service! Believe it or not though, the best part of the meal was actually the food.  We started with the Torchon Foie Gras.  It came with toasted brioche slices and an apricot marmalade.  Probably the best appetizer I've had in years.  Very substantial (and should have been for $22).  We also mentioned we were interested in splitting the apple/squash soup with wrapped shrimp.  They graciously brought us 2 bowls and split it.  The soup was good, but wasn't great... the only part of the meal that was less than great.  The shrimp bite however was fantastic! For my main dish I got the Glazed duck breast ($29).  It was accompanied with figs, a super thin pastry cracker and a smooth cream spread.  It was absolutely fantastic!  My wife had the Pappardelle which including a pasta base with a cognac cream sauce and a TON of butter poached lobster.  It was fantastic.  While hers was $38, for the amount of lobster they put in it was a steal!   For desert we split a hazelnut cream pastry- it was light, and not too sweet, but quite delicious. Our total bill for the two of us with tax and tip was $275 which is definitely expensive, but you could probably get out of their for under $200 without expensive scotch and wine. The whole experience was fantastic.  It's very hard to get reservations on the weekend, so if you'd like to go friday or saturday you should book 2-3 weeks in advance.  If you enjoy restaurants like Boka, Spring, Nomi, Blackbird- this will blow them out of the water.

2010-11-10,4.0,"In September of 2009 I ate at The Gage prior to U2's opening date of the US tour at Soldier Field - it was a great meal in the most unlikely of spaces for someone who doesn't fancy bars, beer, or ""pub"" food...and the concert was excellent too.  Preferring French to any other cuisine I was particularly interested when I heard that Executive Chef Dirk Flanigan and Chef de Cuisine Christopher Cubberley had decided to expand their line of restaurants one door down from the Gage - a new concept called Henri with a menu ""influenced by the refining principles of classical cuisine."" Named after architect Louis Henri Sullivan, a huge influence on the Chicago city-scape, Henri sits nicely just off of Millennium Park and knowing my sister and friends would not be arriving until mid-day I made reservations for one at noon.  Arriving early I wandered the park for a while before returning to the restaurant where I was greeted warmly and sat immediately - still carrying my bags they were checked at once by a friendly hostess.  Offered the option of a table near the front or the back I chose the back - as it turns out there were only 2 tables open in the entire restaurant. Led through the bustling dining room and seated at a cozy two-top everything about Henri felt the part of classic French Bistro - heavy drapery, velvet walls, hardwood floors, crown molding, crystal chandeliers, and an oyster bar to boot.  With water filled I was handed the daily menu and a cocktail list with my waiter returning shortly thereafter to ask if I had any questions and subsequently to take orders.  Without belaboring service I will note that for a ""bistro"" the service was excellent - water never reached half empty, food arrived with adequate description, and timing was excellent - I was never left to want for anything despite the busy nature of the lunch hour at such a popular location. Merely moments after my orders were taken I was greeted by the bread man - a friendly fellow presenting a single option, but an excellent one.  Described as a ""mini baguette"" and served with a sweet room temperature butter the roll arrived warm from the oven and a crispy golden crust yielded a soft and supple interior with a delicate crumb.  Akin in texture and flavor to Keller's Epi at Bouchon I ended up eating three of these rolls and gladly would've eaten more had I not been trying to pace myself. Arriving approximately 20 minutes after seating my first course was obvious - and at $22 the most expensive appetizer choice on the menu.  Served with golden pan-grilled brioche the Torchon of Foie Gras with apricot and aged balsamic would turn out to be every bit as good as I'd hoped.  Classic in presentation the liver itself was served in three large slices, each topped with salt and pepper plus flowers for garnish.  Perfectly cleaned and nicely textured the unctuous liver paired nicely with the sweet and savory aspects of the fruit and vinegar while the brioche was crisp, warm, and buttery.  Quality ingredients, excellent presentation - exactly what I expected. Finishing up the Foie Gras I sat back and waited for my main course - my other ""must order"" on the menu loaded with wonderful choices.   Arriving piping hot and with a side of crispy pommes frites and ketchup, the Croque Madame with aged French ham, Comte, and Gruyere on Brioche was every bit as classic as the Foie Gras - and every bit as strong a representation.  Thick with a sweet and smoky ham the crisp brioche stood up nicely to Gruyere both inside and out while a layer of Comte coated the top of the sandwich.  Topped with a single fresh farm egg served over easy I sliced the sandwich bite by bite with the provided Laguiole knife and was absolutely delighted - a dish on par with my favorite Croque of all time at The Butler and the Chef and every bit worth the hefty $18.50 price tag. Impressed by the savories I strongly considered dessert until I received a text from my sister saying they'd arrived in town and I was informed by my waiter that the lemon soufflé was only available at dinner.  Sated but not stuffed I opted to settle the bill - a bill arriving with a lemon pate de fruit - and thanked my server and hostess for an excellent experience.  While I'm sure the hype surrounding Henri will wane as the restaurant ages I certainly hope the quality of food and service doesn't change.  While it certainly isn't a cheap lunch, the quality and location justifies the cost and a reservation is definitely worth the effort.  With Irish Pub and French Bistro exemplified one can only wonder what is next for Chef Flanigan and team, but whatever it is I'll be sure to check it out.",0.9993,0.819,0.178,0.003,0.5228134325221704
2010-10-26,3.0,"I really really really wanted to like Henri more than I did and give it a better rating. I'd had drinks at the bar a couple weeks before my wife and I went for dinner and was really excited. Much of the experience was outstanding, but the one flaw was enough to lose big stars.  The room is fabulous - sophisticated, quiet, and elegant. The colors are understated and the materials rich. It is a lovely antidote to the over the top and clumsy rooms I've seen elsewhere. I'd come again just to have drinks and dessert and sit in this lovely room.  The cocktails are really outstanding, and I am a tough grader when it comes to drinks. The Burnham Manhattan is especially yummy - slightly sweet, and lovingly aromatic, but brave enough to let the full taste of Rye come through. My wife, not a Rye drinker, has the Henri Presse which was light, flavorful, and really a delightful surprise. Well done on the cocktail service.  Service was generally top notch. Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive. Not too attentive, just right. We didn't want for anything through out the meal and everything arrived properly in spite of an extremely complex array of dishes and courses (three and a half course).  This leaves the last piece, and the one where Henri let me down. Perhaps after the room and the cocktails my expectations were too high. The food was ok., but not great. While on paper all looked good - interesting new takes on many classic dishes - the execution was not so great. Too many of the dishes were muddled - flavors were indistinct and poorly developed. The Lobster/Foie Gras Wellington, which could have been amazing, was instead bad - soggy crust, filling which not only was not melded together, but actually fought against each. The Venison special - which was pushed by the waiter and sounded fantastic, was also a mess. Whatever flavor was there was completely masked by the overly sweet sauce covering the chop (which was itself only a so-so chop). This was made worse but the sweetbreads which were not crispy (as advertised) but mushy. Several other dishes were similar - not bad, but not good enough for a restaurant of this caliber.  In spite of this review I do plan to go back to Henri - chalking up the food challenges to kinks still being worked out (of course it may just be that the chef and I are not on the same wavelength). The room, style, and overall experience of the restaurant find me hoping that the kitchen works it out. I can see having many a meal here.",0.997,0.708,0.208,0.083,0.5546408411849587

The décor is gorgeous.  Very simple, classy and elegant.  But it didn't have the stuffy, pretentious vibe that sometimes comes along with that atmosphere.  There's a smallish bar right inside the door so if you arrive a little early for your reservation (because you seriously should have a reservation) you can hang out there for a bit.  We were here on a Monday night so it wasn't busy, but I would imagine it's a different story on the weekend.   I'm not sure what was more impressive--the food or the service.  Our eats consisted of steak tartare and crisp pork belly salad for starters, the cassoulet and special (guinea hen with black truffles, chanterelle mushrooms and pea puree) for our mains and a shared crème bruelee for dessert.  Everything was truly great, but the cassoulet definitely stood out.  It's the dish of the day on Mondays and I cannot stress enough, go on Monday! I'm a stickler for good service and it was truly top-notch.  From the moment you walk in til the moment you leave, you'll be well-taken care of but not in an overbearing way.  Our server knew the menu inside and out and offered great suggestions.  The owner also came around near the end of our meal to make sure everything was up to par.  Also noteworthy, the timing between the courses was what I consider perfect.  Starters, mains and dessert took about two hours all-in, which I appreciate.  I hate being rushed and having your main course appear before you're even finished with the appetizer.",0.996,0.749,0.21,0.04,0.6652557319223985

Well out of 4 recommendations that we adhered to, all were not at all to our liking or a complement to our dishes (including the wine).  The evenings Soup was so bland and sparse that one felt that they were just being offered a taste to see if it was ok to serve.  The Escargot was so salty and rubbery that the usual savory buttery texture of the snail became ones nemesis that needed considerable chews.  Served with small croutons of Brioche that didn't complement the dish but took away from the love of mopping up the extra butter, basil and garlic. Second course, more of the same, a filet of Sole with butter and caper sauce nothing special(though large).  The special of the evening the Partridge which was so over cooked that one needed to wrestle with the bird to keep it on the plate to at least taste some of the meat!  Wine suggestion poor, if not so mismatched.

Terrible and totally a waste of my time more than anything else! Four of us work colleagues went in for lunch and two of us who ended up ordering the same dish (the house pasta pappardelle with roasted tomatoes and brie ,for which we followed our server's recommendation), had a terrible stomach upset that evening and we're still trying to recover from it! Blowing up close to $120 on tasteless lunch and ending up with food poisoning is totally unacceptable!! When the dish was served to us, I noticed all the ingredients (cheese and garnish) of my dish had shifted and fallen off inside the plate so the dish looked uninviting to begin with. The dish wasn't nearly half as tasty as our server had made it seem. Not only was the pasta half uncooked and sticky, the brie was all lumpy and melted in one corner of my dish too! There were barely 2 sorry pieces of roasted tomato in my plate and there was no flavor to the dish. We just couldn't tell the chef's intention for creating a dish like that. We could have gotten better, well cooked and more flavorful pasta, at any other place that didn't even boast of a fancy menu.

2010-09-11,4.0,"I took clients to lunch at Henri this week. This place is right next door to The Gage and right across from Milennium Park which is a perfect location. It is surprisingly small, but the decor is light and airy and makes it feel larger. The only discrepancy is the music they were playing sounded like it should have been in an elevator - my clients requested to eat outside to get away from it. The food was absolutely delicious. I had the beef tenderloin sandwich and it was an explosion of savory flavors complimented by hot, perfectly cooked fries. I would recommend eating the sandwich open-faced with silverware because the juices soak the bread and it becomes difficult to eat otherwise. However, though the food was wonderful, I have to say that the absolute highlight of the meal was our server, Dan. He was so enthusiastic and friendly, he actually created an easy ice-breaker between me and my clients. His recommendations were very articulate and decriptive - there was no saving us, we were suckers for this guy and ordered everything he told us to. I'll be asking for him everytime I come here. Also, for those who entertain business lunches a lot, there are a few things that this place does that is exceptional: 1. They bring out bread and put an individual piece on everyone's bread plate. This is so nice because bread baskets can be awkward with people not wanting to ""be the first"" to grab it and/or touch the food with their bare hands. 2. They do not over-carry plates. Sometimes at restaurants, the servers come out carrying so many plates that the people at our table have to help them grab it. It's awkward and distracts my clients from - well - me.  3. They offer sparkling and still water complimentary. It's an elegant touch. It is rather pricey, especially with The Gage right next door. Typically, for a 4-top at The Gage, I'll spend $80 out the door, we spent almost $110 here. That's why I gave it 4 stars.  Overall, a great experience.

2010-08-24,5.0,"I have never had so much lobster and foie gras in my life!  I have been waiting for Henri to open all summer.  So this past week a friend and I went and ordered 8 things off the menu and nothing disappointed.  First, the decor is plush, welcoming and inviting. The walls are lined with a brown fuzzy felt that makes you just want to rub up against them. The overall feeling is one of airiness and light with the soft blue hues in the chairs and drapes. The bathrooms are floor to ceiling stalls with thick wood doors and faux alligator walls. The soap and lotion are the same as what is in The Gage and I just love the smell of both.   Now the food; I started out with the shrimp cocktail and they were  the biggest shrimps I have ever seen. Easily 3-4 bites per each.  There are three dipping sauces that accompany them, a white wine vinaigrette, a cocktail sauce with shaved horseradish and a red wine vinaigrette. The white wine was so delicious I was eating it with my spoon after all my shrimps were gone.  I then moved onto the lobster wellington, they  were so sweet and melted in my mouth.  I liked the pasty that surrounded them, I don't think it was too soggy on the bottom or not crispy enough on the top.  My entree was the pappardelle. I know on the menu it says cream but it wasn't overpowering or too heavy over the dish. Again, the lobster was sweet and savory and I couldn't get enough of it. For our side dish we had the potatoes dauphinoise, and really all one needs in life is potatoes, milk, and cream. This was the dish we were fighting over to eat. Despite ordering other heavier dishes,  it didn't matter when coming to the potatoes.  The drinks; I really appreciate that the cocktail menu has been carefully edited and fits all on one page. I feel I do better when presented with limited choices. I started out with the Kir Royeaux with mirto, made from the myrtle berry. I liked that it wasn't as sweet as I expected it to be and it was a nice cocktail to drink with the shrimp and wellington.  I then ordered the Cinq à Sept (five 'til seven) and again I was pleasantly surprised it wasn't sweet, or as sweet as I was anticipating. Reading that there was basil syrup in there  concerned me because I really don't like basil but I couldn't really taste it in a way that turned me off. Finally I had the Mas de Gourgonnier Rouge red to complete my meal.  It completely complimented the pasta and it was a wise choice to recommend it to me. Finally dessert, we had the mille feuille the layered dessert with layers of puffed pastry, vanilla bean cream and fresh strawberries. When the dessert was brought out I thought there was glass on top of it.  The sugar layer that  is made similarly to rock candy and was a thin clear sheet. We used our spoons to crack straight down the middle and blend all the textures and flavors together.  I just cannot say enough about Henri to express how delicious I found every dish. It really was an amazing experience and it is a welcomed addition to the loop/Michigan Avenue dining. I cannot wait to check out their lunch menu and bring more friends there.  Henri showed me his teeth and I loved it!",0.9986,0.806,0.179,0.015,0.49333467850416984
2010-08-22,5.0,"So here we have it folks. Finally a new french restaurant is added to Chicago's fleet of fine dining. When I think about it, how many french restauarants are even left in chicago? We're not talking about bistros and brasseries, we're talking classical haute french cuisine...Exactly, not many. True, Dirk Flanigan doesn't stick to all the rules with his new fare, but some rules are meant to be broken. Walking into this quaint white table cloth, plush turquoise accented 65 seat dining room, I felt as if I were stepping into what I imagine a french grandmother's living room would resemble.  Greeted promptly and feeling right at home, the ""snootiness"" was immediately tucked away. While waiting for my party to arrive, I grabbed a seat at the bar.  The cocktail list should definitely not be ignored.  After some thought and persuasion, I wisely chose the Manhattan.  It wasn't the Wild Turkey Rye which sold me on the decision, but the bitters really brought out the flavors and set the bar for other manhattan's I've encountered in my day.  Lastly garnished with a brandied luxardo cherry. Damn good The party arrives, we grab a seat in the corner and start studying this wonderful play on haute French cuisine.  Our orders went as such;  Cold apps: Steak tartare, oysters(B.C. and New Haven) paired with black velvet(guiness and champagne) Hot app: Wellington (lobster and foie gras in a phyllo pouch with a gastrique) Tomato Pissaladiere (tomato pizza) topped with madeira house cured Duroc ham and arugula Main Entrees: Prime burger with short rib, tomato jam, Sartori cheese on a potato roll Quail with a mix of vegetables Pork loin with greens and potatoes boulangere Side dish: amaranth (never arrived) Wine: 2008 Pinot noir Central Cali Coast Before I begin to break this all out.  I want to tell you about the oven which many of these dishes are prepared in.  It is a stone oven, which has the capability of heating at such high temperatures that it will actually put a nice sear or crisp on the proteins and pissaladieres.  We ordered everything all at once, in order for them to bring it out in a timely manner.  We were then accompanied by the sommelier, who suggested a wonderful biodynamical 2008 Pinot noir from central California. The smoked steak tartare came out served with the traditional quail egg, cornichons, potato chips and seasoned with a little black pepper.   The smokiness was a nice note of flavor to accompany the sourness of the cornichons and the sweetness of the quail egg. The Wellington was alright in my book.  I'm not a big fan of phyllo in the first place, but the lobster and foie gras sold us on this decision.  The delicate lobster flavor was not able to stand out over the masking greens and foie. Now for the oysters.  A little advice is stick with the Kusshi Oysters.  They have a wonderful clean and fruity flavor.  Especially when they are paired with a black velvet. Pissaladiere is a french term for pizza.  Informed by our server that, it is traditionally served without cheese, but at Henri it is served with cheese.  I'm all for it. Dirk or his boulangiere has this crust down to a science.  Thin and crispped by the stone oven, and the slices were able to hold all the amazing toppings without drooping.  I would order this pizza again in a heart beat. And finally the main entrees.  Lets start out with the prime burger. A thick 80/20 prime beef patty with shredded short rib, salty and nutty sartori reserve cheese (wisconsin cheese which resembles a sarvecchio flavor) , tomato Jam on a potato roll served with a cup of pommes frites.  The burger was actually one of the main highlights of the meal. A beautiful and juicy medium rare with all the robust flavors were matched perfectly.  Remember, bar seating is available.  I might consider a pizza, burger, beer night once or four times a week here. The quail was the game meat of the day.  Quail is a very sweet and tasty bird, the only problem is that they are so damn small.  The only way to eat it is to pick it up and go to down.  In this setting, I held back and challenged the two fowls with a knife and fork.  It was a very light dish, not overcooked and dry as I'm used to quail being.  All the vegetables were cooked to the right toothsome texture and I was content. The Pork loin, rather massive and grand was something we were all looking forward of snagging a bite of.  When ordered, we went with the Chef's recommendation of medium with a nice pink hue.  Unfortunately, it was a tad cooked more than we would have preferred.  It was still very tasty, but on the dryer side.  I didn't get to try the potatoes boulangere, but my friend said they were amazing.  With a level of service from every staffmember uncomparable to most of the restaurants I've recently dined at; managers, bussers, sous chef of the gage, server, bartender and sommalier  I would go back even if the food wasn't as amazing as it really was. Great first night, may it only get better",0.9987,0.837,0.135,0.028,0.5222458011633269
