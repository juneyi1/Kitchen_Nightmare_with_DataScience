2009-04-28,3.0,"I would probably give this place 2 and a 1/2 stars really if there was an option. It was ""ok"". The appetizer is what got it as high as it is with me. We ordered the paneer pakora and they were pretty yummy :0). The downs.... I like my food so hot it makes me sweat, mission not accomplished. Not even close. In fact my wuss wuss wuss of a boyfriend who does not even like pepper in his food because it is to spicy could eat it. Also it wasn't very ""saucy"" I would say it was more ""chunky which is weird. We came with a group and one of the people I was with got the wrong order and another persons food came out 15 mins after we all got ours. I had the benefit of living right by an AMAZING Indian when I lived in Michigan. This is probably one of my favorite foods to eat, I am newish to the city.....so to Gandhi thanks for your so-so effort but I think I will keep my search going for better Indian in the city of Chicago.",0.9226,0.866,0.107,0.027,0.6283809523809524
2008-11-21,3.0,"I have had mixed experiences from this place.  We really only go there because it is one of the few places that has mutter paneer on the buffet all the time.  The food is generally pretty good and spicy, save for the one time it tore my stomach apart for the next week.  That was a few yrs back and I have been back and it has been fine.  Cooks move on too I guess.  The part that bothers me is that they never seem to have naan when you want it.  I had to keep telling the lady to have the guy make more.  It gets a little annoying.",0.8016,0.854,0.109,0.037,0.4192307692307693
2008-08-16,4.0,"I really like their buffet here.  I live one block from here so I have tried about 10 other Indian Buffets on Devon.  This one is my favorite.  The food is really good, the service is good and friendly and the place is clean.  And I can honestly say that not all of the Indian places on Devon are clean.  I am so glad that I tried this one.  I will always go to Gandhi when I am in the mood for Indian food from now on.",0.9725,0.697,0.274,0.029,0.6431818181818183
2008-08-04,2.0,"I had the worst mutter paneer I've ever had in my life here. The sauce was -extremely- watery and flavorless. I'm not kidding, the naan could not pick up or soak any of the sauce as it just dripped off. There were fewer than five small pieces of paneer. On the other hand, the naan was light and chewy (though it's hard to botch up such a bread). I'm glad I only ordered one dish. It would've been a waste to try others. (Btw, it's ironic that this restaurant named after Gandhi whose entire life was dedicated to non-violence towards others, including animals, isn't pure vegetarian. Just an observation though.)",0.0268,0.828,0.078,0.094,0.6570512820512822
2008-06-09,5.0,"i used to live a couple blocks away and this was my favorite Indian buffet on a street jammed with some other very good buffets.  The keys for me at Gandhi are the nan, the tandoori, and the best mango chutney I've ever had.  You won't be disappointed.",0.9011,0.729,0.236,0.035,0.615
2008-05-25,4.0,"Gandhi has one of the better buffets for lunch. I love their samosas and dal, and the saag paneer is great as well. The beer is also perfect with the buffet. The owners are wonderful and informative. My only gripe with the place is that it takes me ages to get up there from my Hyde Park apartment. But it's all a part of the adventure and it's still worth the trip.",0.9747,0.713,0.287,0.0,0.7071428571428571
2008-04-12,4.0,"I have only been here for lunch. They have a wonderful , reasonable lunch buffet . It's not huge, but it does have enough variety and it's very fresh, they cook only a small amount at a time so the food does not sit and sit under the heat lamp (gotta love that). They have the usual suspects, the most popular Indian dishes  (I'm not even going to begin to slaughter the names of the dishes) Warm, yummy Naan bread.  Delicious Tandoori Chicken. Delicious rice,  Spinach and cheese, Lentils, Goat Stew (don't make that icky face, it's really good!) The same little lady is in the kitchen cooking every time we go. And it's good to see that the locals DO eat here. Oh man..it's lunch time, my mouth is watering.",0.9885,0.733,0.237,0.029,0.6797619047619047
2008-02-08,5.0,"As I have time to get into Yelp and start thinking of the places I really enjoy going to, Gandhi comes to mind.  Just a low key, small restaurant with locals enjoying their dinners. Quiet, shy ESL waiters who know what they are talking about menu wise, are incredibly attentive yet don't hover.  I hate waiters who hover - "" HI !!  I'm Chip and I'll be your server tonight :) !!!!""    GREAT tasting authentic food at very reasonable prices.  Others say portions are kinda small? maybe but perhaps that's why it's so inexpensive.  I just order a couple of extra entrees or sides of naan, and problem solved. BTW - Ice cold Indian beer and frozen mugs.  Don't go here if you are looking for atmosphere, excitement or people watching.  Do go here if you love tasty Indian food and just want to chat with your friends in a quiet restaurant.",0.9784,0.764,0.197,0.039,0.6340350877192984
2006-05-28,5.0,"Great tasting food. Of all of the Indian restaurants along Devon, this is the one I keep coming back to for sit-down meals, especially with guests from out-of-town.

2006-04-01,2.0,"Ok so I stopped by this place on a whim the food is average but the food portions (at least for an indian food restuarant) was pretty small they say it serves two people but I could of eaten both enetry's by myself if I wanted too. I got the tippooori chicken and a rice and lamb combination, I mean the food was average but it could have been bigger not to mention that the service was a little slow and you had to ask for all the ""little things"" like bread, water, yogurt, stuff like that, the inside was decorated ok but could have been better. oh well I suggest the sahri for better quality and service just my suggestion though.",0.9723,0.798,0.19,0.012,0.5425
2005-10-25,3.0,"I don't really like this place that much..the fact that it is completely empty 98% of the time is kind of weird. The food is okay..I think Tiffin or Sabri down the street are better options. But it is pretty reasonbly priced, so it doesn't hurt to give it a try..you just might like something!",0.4003,0.717,0.147,0.136,0.6269841269841271

2005-07-27,5.0,This place has amazing food with a good variety of both meat dishes and vegetarian.  They have a lunch buffet that makes my mouth water just thinking of it.   It is a great introduction to Indian food if you aren't too familiar and it is a bargain.  The clientele is a mixture of locals and people willing to make the trip for some wonderful food.,0.946,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.75
