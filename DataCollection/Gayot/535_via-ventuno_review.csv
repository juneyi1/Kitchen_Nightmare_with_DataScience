However, it is the interactive history lesson is what saves this place. Who knew there was a secret door in the wall right beside the band. Wow! Juan and I were given a tour and into the super skinny tunnel that once led to the kitchen (where Al Capone made his escape years ago). Today, it now leads up stairs into a little room above the kitchen, and you can see all the culinary action. Come dressed nicely.

2009-06-01,3.0,"Second chances are completely and totally a part of my doctrine, and so Via Venuto shall get one most assuredly. JK's breathtaking design is enough to float me back in for cocktails and bruschette.  In fact, that's what I would truly use these new digs for. . . aps, cocktails, sultry legs slung over each other on the patio. Breezes and vino, though in the Eden adjacent to the main dining room you lose out on the velvet touches Kleiner restaurants are so famous for.  We had an early Sunday dinner with the mum and were eager to try what we hoped would become a regular hang out. Previous trusted Yelpers had all but sold me on what would be nothing short of amazing, but from the onset our server was aloof and less than thrilled to help us with our very minor requests (Parmesan cheese from the 100 lb. wheel they had in plain sight and closing the door on a very cool May afternoon). Parmesan cheese at an Italian restaurant. Can you imagine the horror?? She scoffed throughout our experience, and I wasn't sure why. I mean, have you met me?  Maybe the two tables she had was too much to handle. Or maybe her dog died that morning. Like I said, second chances mos def. The food, with the exception of the cute, safe and round arancini (and they were crunchy and special), was all stuff I could make at home. And stuff my mom makes better (her bolognese runs circles around the one here and at Gioco. Actually, it's better at Gioco). I almost insulted the chef and asked for salt because my Risotto of the Day (asparagus and Rock Shrimp) was b-l-a-n-d. So sad, because the ingredients had a lot of promise. And at $21 for teensy shrimp and perhaps two stalks of asparagus, well, I was feeling pissy. But Via excels at starters and I would have ordered five more of the Bruschette Special: mozzarella and prosciutto. Salty and melty and so, so, so good with a drizzle of sage butter. I loved bopping along to the sounds of funk and swing playing (loudly) over the speakers. I wanted to run up and down the hallowed halls of VV and pretend it was my living room and I was having a grand dinner party with a guest list ranging from Justice O'Connor to Liz Phair. It would be an amazing fete at VV. Unforgettable, because the ambiance is delicious. But the food wasn't. Not this time.",0.9951,0.747,0.186,0.067,0.5347305343235577

2009-05-11,5.0,"Well, Jerry Kleiner has done it again.  Via Ventuno was a recent dining experience for me and a real treat I might add! This phoenix of a restaurant was born out of 21 and has the signature ""Kleiner"" look and feel to it, though I really felt like I was back in Park 52 in Hyde Park (you know...the southside....the place more of you northsiders should check out) as the design resembled it somewhat, which is a good thing. This restaurant will house a significant number of people both inside and out as the patio is just about as long as the inside and I cannot wait till it gets warm enough to try it out. As we were seated, the general manager, Robert, came to our table and introduced himself and welcomed us to Via Ventuno.  Natalie was to be our server.  We talked for a moment about the changes and specials and our drink order was taken.  This particular evening I was lucky enough to actually meet Jerry Kleiner as he was dining with some friends at a nearby table.  He welcomed us and also talked about the vision of his new creation and the changes that occurred from when it was 21.  The most interesting thing Mr. Kleiner had to relay about Via Ventuno was the menu pricing.  He had tailored it in such a way to provide the best dishes at very reasonable prices....in other words affordable. All the food was amazing from the appertizer to the entree!   Valet parking is available for $10 which is fine, but a tad expensive considering how far south you are from the loop.  I think this should be $8 With the expansive patio, this should be a real ""must do"" on your Yelp bookmark list!",0.9627,0.895,0.105,0.0,0.48932900432900434

Our main courses were also excellent.  My father and I had the halibut special and my father kept commenting on the combination of ingredients.  He never does that.  My step-brother had the gnocchi which was amazing. We didn't leave too much room for dessert but had sorbet and an apple tart.

2009-04-21,4.0,"We had an amazing time here.  Our server Lakeria was the sweetest ever.  She went out of her way to do things for us.  She even showed us this pretty cool private room.  The room prolly seats around 6 comfortably.  It over looks the kitchen on the second floor.  Pretty neat.   We went there not know what to expect.  We didn't know what to get since everything sounded so good.  Decided to try the chef's tasting.  Executive chef James Kilberg is one awesome chef.  He came out and chatted with us, asking if we had any allergies to anything.  We said no, and for him to just surprise us.  We were pleasantly surprised.   We had the stuffed calamari for starters.  Delish - juicy and not too chewy.  Then we had a celery salad.  Sound okie dokie, but was really good as well.  Then we were served 2 different pastas.  I had the mortadella tortellinis and my brother had the homemade pasta with ragu sauce.  Again very good.  Following the pastas we had halibut and seabass.  Seabass was awesome.  Halibut was a touch dry, but still good.  You'd think we were stuffed by now, but we still had dessert.  My brother had the cheesecake.  It was different.  I had the ice cream trio.  Lavender, cinnamon, and some sort of fleur flavor.  My favorite was the fleur.   Over all, the service was great, food was served nice and hot, and they had some good music.  We found ourselves bopping to some of the songs.  You would think Frank Sinatra would be in the back ground, but think Al Green, Michael Jackson, and a lot of other stuff.  It was definitely a happy environment.",0.9971,0.768,0.227,0.005,0.6564285714285714

2009-04-09,5.0,"Amazing.   I visited Via Ventuno for a special event and got to experience a custom tasting menu, so I can't comment on the regular menu, but what the chef put together for our group absolutely blew me away.   The first few courses were my personal favorites:  langoustines with pea tendrils and fava beans, foccaccia stuffed with some type of cheese (forgot the name) and speck served with arugula and black truffle shavings, and pasta (looked like tortelloni but I forgot the exact name) stuffed with foie gras.  There were a few other courses, all excellent, and we finished up with an amazing creme brule. Justin (who we decided to call Yoda) selected wines that went beautifully with each course, and I really enjoyed listening to what he had to say as he presented each selection.  Mark deserved the highest ratings as a server.     I can't wait to come back and try out the regular menu.",0.9866,0.815,0.185,0.0,0.47158478776125845
2009-04-07,4.0,"Apparently I like Italy more than I thought: the cheese, the wine...the men.  It's all here.  And then some!  Via Ventuno is a rare find.  This place was fantastic. Seriously.  I find no fault--starting with the sweet hosts that greeted my friend and I, to our server, Mark, that provided stellar service.  The space is gorgeous--I don't know what Room 21 looked like, but it's incredibly warm and inviting.  It felt like I was sitting in someone's posh mansion library.  Loved it.  Their menu is extensive, but not intimidating.  We got to taste an array of their dishes including:  *Special bruschetta of the evening (taleggio, truffles, and honey--amazing!!!)  *Stuffed calamari (::sooo good:: very tender; a must try). *Pork, beef and more pork (basically a variety of cured Italian meats). *Butternut squash ravioli (my fave pasta--it was divine!) *Handmade spaghetti *Campari cheesecake (not your typical cheesecake, yet really good). *Panna cotta  ***Side note: They have several gelato and sorbet selections, none of which we tried, but with flavors like Nutella gelato and Limoncello sorbet, it'd be worth a trip back just to get my sugar fix! We also received superior service from the Beverage Director, Justin, whose expert beverage knowledge was outstanding.  He hooked us up with some killer Moscato d'Asti.....and it left me lusting for more.  Of him.   So lets recap: Beautiful space, awesome food, fabulous drinks, dreamy men, no Janet Jackson music.  I dig.

2009-03-30,5.0,"I visited Via Ventuno with friends on Friday night with high expectations for Kleiner's new place. Having been to Room 21 several times before, I was thrilled with that ""awe factor"" that Kleiner seems to effortlessly achieve at all of his restaurants. The decor is much warmer with fascinating artifacts plastering the walls (that are apparently from his personal collection). Signature details remain recognizable, but there are numerous differences such as book shelves that divide up the room and i think the walls were redone to make it feel more cozy and comfortable. We started at the bar with signature drinks and wine. The bartender was gracious and the cocktails were very unique. Not being a big wine drinker, i was impressed at the accessibility of the wine list. A simple list that breaks up the mostly Italian wines into categories such as ""robust"" or ""subtle."" With my always-on-a-budget price point in mind, this made me feel comfortable as I felt I could make my own selection and not look like a total novice. However the list is so reasonable (most bottles in the $30 and $40 range) we were more than happy to take a recommendation from our waiter. He was very knowledgable and presented us with a fantastic bottle for a great price. The food is exactly what I look for in a restaurant. I'm somewhat of a commitment-phobe, so I love to order many things and try a bit of everything, as opposed to committing to one entree. Although my friends don't always share my viewpoint it was extremely easy to find things to share on the menu. We got a fantastic eggplant parmesan, a cranberry and boar sausage (that even my devout Catholic friends couldn't resist trying on a Friday during lent!), a tasty beet salad and a white bean bruschetta served on a perfectly contrasted crispy bread. The items i was most impressed with were the fried rice balls with porcini mushrooms and a creamy white cheese (these were a great size at only a few dollars a piece!) and the AMAZING parmigano reggiano that is chipped away from a giant cheese wheel right in front of you. This crumbly and nutty cheese is probably the best cheese I've ever tasted, and at only $4 for a plate it merited 2nds (and we even considered 3rds!).  I'm disappointed that we were on a time crunch and couldn't stay to try everything, but I'm already trying to get another group together to go this week. When I heard that it was the first Friday they were opened, I was shocked. It felt like the restaurant had been around for years! Well done, Via Ventuno - you found yourself a regular customer in only your first few days of opening!",0.9984,0.767,0.2,0.033,0.5599004504267662
2009-03-29,3.0,"I need to start this review stating that I came here on the first Saturday night service. That being said there is a great deal of potential for the ""new"" Room 21 space but there is room for improvement in several areas. I love the space. Those Kleiner fans like me won't be disappointed. The space hasn't changed too much since its Room 21 days, but there is an added warmth in the dining area with book shelves now filled with decorations. The gorgeous patio and bar space remain as they were - no need to mess with something that's already perfect, right? The service needed work. Our waitress needed to be better informed of the menu items and specials. We asked her several basic questions (what is the calamari stuffed with? what type of coffee do you brew?) which she had to go investigate - fine when there were only a few tables, but as the night got busier we saw less and less of her. The bussers also needed a lesson in table numbers as our neighbors appetizers were placed confidently in front of us even after we stated they weren't ours. Again, room to grow. The menu has traditional Italian dishes from a variety of regions - arancini from Sicily to Emilia Romagna's cappellacci and tortellini. Some were better than others. I enjoyed the hearty bean soup and my warm aracini (risotto ball with mushrooms lightly fried in bread crumbs) but thought the  bruschette could have been better (loved the smoky eggplant spread but the bread wasn't crispy just mushy). They have a nice mix of entrees - pastas, fish and meats. I enjoyed the cauliflower cappellacci with delicious bits of pancetta and tomato. Veal milanese was crispy and flavorful but might have needed some additional dressing to go with its ample arugula garnish. Pumpkin ravioli were creamy and delicious. The dessert menu looked good but with our waitress nowhere to be found we decided to take a pass. Oh, they do brew Intelligentsia too if you're wondering. So the highlight of the evening was seeing Mr. Kleiner himself. This must have been a special soft opening of sorts for industry types because the boss was greeting his guests in the dining room. My table was lucky enough not to just talk with him, but to have a tour and hear the story first hand of the restaurant space. Truly a unique experience. I will definitely go back to Via Ventuno again, but I'm going to wait a few more weeks until they get their service and menu in better order.",0.9989,0.762,0.226,0.012,0.5332251082251083
2009-03-26,5.0,"As soon as I heard the news that Via Ventuno was finally open, I couldn't resist my urge to check out Kleiner's new spot on its' first night. I had been to Room 21 several times  and even before I visibly noticed the specific changes in decor, the overall vibe of the room felt so warm and inviting, dark and cozy. There are many new changes; bookshelves, walls, beautiful antique armoires, pictures and trinkets in every corner. You can spend all evening just looking around. The host staff was so friendly and excitedly gave us suggestions of a couple of their favorite things on the menu as they walked us pass someone standing behind an antipasti station in the dining room. Just seeing the beautiful veggies, meats and cheeses was enough to warrant ordering EVERYTHING(and we practically did)!!!  I was just as torn with the menu, where ordering everything wasn't going to be an option in this one visit.  We decided on the arancinis for apps(they were $3 each). yummy! and the best part is you can order them each individually. I highly recommend the eggplant parmesan. Its just like my grandma used to make.  The bruschette is made to order and each one more delicious than the next. And at a price of $3 or $4 you can order a few and not break the bank!!! the ingredients oh so fresh. we were in heaven. And the prices and sizes make it perfect to try a bunch of things and share! The celery and date salad had the perfect bitter crunch mixed with the slight sweet of the date, which made for a refreshing taste and a perfect compliment to any app or dinner item. The veal milanese was even better than the ones I've had in Milan. It had an awesome crunchy texture on the outside and with the arugula and lemon..perfecto. My friends had the butternut squash ravioli, which had just the right tenderness and sweetness as well as the pan roasted salmon, which did not disappoint. Overall, we had a terrific experience. The staff from the minute we walked in the door, were amazing. The hostess' were cheery and friendly, our server was so attentive to everything we needed and we even got a visit from a manager whose knowledge of wine blew us all away. In fact, we wound up ordering a simple $30 bottle of a subtle red (the wine menu was very non threatening) and when it was presented to us, were treated as if we had ordered a reserve. We absolutely loved our overall experience and felt like you got sooo much more for the price we payed. what a fun night out!!! A beautiful atmosphere, incredible food, a gracious staff(and it was the first day).

2009-03-25,2.0,"I simply adore innovation and am taken when someone has determination - which is why I have always been a supporter of Jerry Kleiner's ventures. Truth be told, I've been dining in his restaurants consistently for probably over a decade, as many Chicagoans have, and have experienced anything from above average to damn good each of those times.  This time around, however, the empire falls short.  I respect that Jerry has revamped the old Room 21 space (minimally) and has re-concepted to a more approachable and understandable (and affordable) rustic italian spot. That being said, sometimes, when things don't work out the first time around... there's a reason. Room 21, in my opinion, didn't quite do it as the food was just not good enough for its price point. Ironically, it's the reverse with Via Ventuno - the affordable quality is virtually apparent.  Food was meh all the way around - olives with white anchovies ($3) were a small handful of mediocre olives with 3 pieces of anchovies anyone can buy in the grocery. The eggplant parmigiana app ($7, I believe) was presented as a nice cube of layered cheese and eggplant on top of red sauce and looked good, but was average at best (my dining companion commented that Riccobene's was better). The boar sausage with beans ($9, I recall) was probably the best of the items as it was lean and boar-ish without the game quality. Bruschettas (ranging from $3 up) were poor - think toppings one can buy in pre-packaged contained in the supermarket. Fish was ok - but nothing spectacular.  I will, however, bite my tongue when it comes to the bar and dessert. The cocktails are fun and interesting and the wine is just fine. The beer selection drew a heavy emphasis on italian beer, so that was nice to see. Desserts were fantastic! Really. Try the campari cheese cake (think perfect ricotta cake with just a hint of campari on the topping, so nothing to be afraid of) and the fig tart. Desserts were the best edibles of the meal.  Service was attentive, not too fussy and friendly - certainly no complaints on that issue.  Quite honestly, I'm not sure I'd come back, which is a shame because the room was beautiful, the service wonderful and the desserts incredible.... ok, maybe I'd return for a sweet and a glass of port.",0.9972,0.749,0.206,0.045,0.5153998778998778
