The food was not the most amazing I've had in similar caliber restaurants, but it was still delicious. The standouts in appetizers were the spinach gnocchi and truffle fries. I got the skatefish (partly for the name) which was well prepared and melted in the mouth (always a good sign). The other entrees that I tasted were equally delightful. No items were overseasoned, as is apparently occasionally the case according to other reviews. Service was excellent, both before the symphony and after when we returned for dessert and digestifs. While my dessert (marscapone) was scrumptious, I regretted not getting something a little more chocolaty, especially after seeing my companions chocolate items. Lesson learned. I don't live in the income bracket that allows for meals here for which I pay, however I would be more than happy to come back in similar circumstances. Especially with the same group of people.

2012-02-25,4.0,"This review is for my experience at the wine bar. I'm yet to experience any of their culinary offerings. I'd never heard of this place prior to stopping by about an hour before a CSO concert featuring renowned guest conductor Alain Altinoglu. There's actually a door in this joint that's adjacent to a hallway which leads directly to the CSO. ""A neat discovery"" I thought to myself."" The ambiance is warm and a tad homely, what with the well laid out furniture and minimalist interior decor. I was a little taken aback to discover that the clientele is skewed towards an older demographic. As a matter of fact, with the exception of another couple, I got the impression that i was the only soul under 55 years of age in the joint, which was fine by me because I was in my pre-symphony mode if you know what I mean, and hence the last thing I needed was a rowdy gathering of rambunctious, hormone-ladden youngsters killing my buzz.    Anyways, I made a bee line for the bar, plonked my merry ass into a comfortable stool, and with much gusto, and against my better judgement -- I was initially inclined towards pinot -- I proceeded to order my first drink of the evening, a properly shaken vodka martini. The bartender had the good sense to ask me whether I would like any particular brand of vodka with that, and whether I'd like olives with that, to which i nodded in the affirmative. Suffice it to say that this guy actually did a good job of lacing my vodka with the perfect proportion of vermouth, and garnished the said drink with 2 spherically impeccable, and quite palatable olives. I took one sip of this exquisite delight, and I was ready for Bizet's Symphony in C. The drink was so good that I didn't bat an eyelash when my tab arrived, and I had to fork out a double digit pay for the experience.  The wine list was extensive and well-priced.  Now if you are wondering why I have dwelt so emphatically on the quality of this singular drink, I will say that while such drinks as the martini are rather common and easy to make, I have been disappointed by many mixologists in some of Chicago's upscale establishments. cheers!",0.9884,0.825,0.137,0.038,0.46825980392156863
2012-02-24,4.0,"So I never even heard of this place before and it took Restaurant Week to get me here. Daddy liked. We came here for a group celebration and it was great. I wasn't really fired up to eat here until i tried the first course, the Pork Testa. It was freaking serious. The pork  was cooked to perfection and the sauce and green leaves and stuff on top were the perfect extras.  2nd course: Balsamic Glazed Short Rib Panini. If you've never had it....get it. The peppers and sweet onions were perfect with the tender short ribs. I mean it was slamming. I would say it was the best thing on the menu, but a couple people got the Amber fish (not sure that's what it was actually called) said it was insanely good.  3rd course (Dessert): Tartufo (I think it's German). It was a chocolate cake (without flour apparently, but who cares) with cherries on top and the smallest sorbet ever. I love sweets and I was still blown away by how good this was. Overall, this is a great place and I would definitely recommend it for an upscale lunch/dinner. BOOOOM Rhapsody!",0.9943,0.735,0.251,0.014,0.4694958847736625
2012-02-23,3.0,"Went here for lunch during Restaurant Week. The food was decent, although I snuck a peek at the regular menu and was sort of sticker shocked. My flat iron steak would be $18 a la carte. It was not worth $18. My two shrimp appetizer was $12. $6 a shrimp? Really?  I'm glad it was all part of the $22 prix fixe menu. I'm not sure what my tartufo dessert would've been but clearly I was already ahead. The ambience is nice but the service, despite our showing up at 11:30, was painfully slow. If I want to pay $25 for lunch in the loop for equally slow service, I'd much rather go to Mercat. Their food is heads and tails above Rhapsody's!",0.3981,0.829,0.088,0.083,0.4723701512163051
2012-02-21,2.0,"The good: The braised rabbit first course was fantastic. Service was courteous, attentive and reasonably knowledgeable. The mediocre: both our entrees were ok. I had stuffed capon, which goes against my usual don't order chicken at a restaurant rule. The polenta was nice, but the chicken itself was a little dry and the mushrooms stuffed inside were sparse. She had the pork chop and it was ok, but excessively fatty. Where there was meat, it was tough. Tasted ok, but nothing special. The bad: We went to Rhapsody for restaurant week, and given the vast amount of choices for restaurant week, I really wish we had gone elsewhere. You see, Rhapsody chooses to do the $44 option for the 3-course prix fixe. This was included in restaurant week last year in order to attract more higher-end restaurants. However, in almost every case, it is break-even or cheaper to order the exact same dishes off the regular menu. As an example, lets say you got the roasted beets, the pork chop and a dessert. On the menu, that's $10, $24 and $8, bringing us in at $42. If you had ordered that via the special Restaurant Week prix fixe, you'd pay an extra $2. In fact, assuming you don't want a 10 oz. sirloin ($34 on the menu), you'd be hard-pressed to come up with a $44 order, and it would be easy to save yourself at least 10 bucks ordering off the regular menu. Very disappointing. I mentioned this to the server at the end of the night, and she hadn't realized it, though did promise to take it up with the manager. I haven't seen any amendments to their menu, though. All in all, the food was good, but not great. Definitely not worth blowing a restaurant week visit, considering the price issues. Had they participated in the normal restaurant week $33 price point, it'd be worth it. At $44, I couldn't help but feel they got me in the door with the intention of taking advantage of me.",0.9225,0.808,0.114,0.078,0.5490799113167535

Rhapsody had an opening around 8:00, which is what I was looking for...so I booked it.  Sadly, my friends were not fans, but I enjoyed my meal. We started with a Blange wine recommended by the server, who was very helpful and knew the wine list very well.  This was a perfect fit for us.  My friends ordered the gnocchi (spinach and cheese I believe).  I hate gnocchi, but they said it was some of the worst they have had and was undercooked and raw.  Our server was great. He noticed one of the girls was not eating it at all and offered to take it back.  VERY attentive.  I had the skate wing and it was amazing. It was like a mild chicken-fish taste and texture. And it came with capers, green beans, and potatoes.  The potatoes were a little undercooked, but the capers with the fish was just an awesome combination.   Overall, great service and a tad pricey---but some great menu items.",0.9922,0.671,0.257,0.073,0.6100732600732601
2012-01-22,1.0,"Friday evening was maybe the 10th time I've had dinner at Rhapsody, and it will be the last. The waiter was fine, but don't waiters pour the wine any more? That aside, service was good, except he asked ""How is everything"" AS THE FOOD WAS BEING SERVED, so how would we know? He quickly disappeared and we had to flag down the bus boy to get the waiter to come back: my sea bass was raw in the middle. It was presented on a lovely plate surrounded by giardiniera, but when I got maybe 2 inches into it I hit a pink, hard center. Couldn't cut it with the knife - it hadn't cooked through. Now, sea bass is a very thick fish, but it can be done - and to have a kitchen with the reputation (and prices) of Rhapsody send it out wrong is, well, wrong.  The manager came over, apologizing, but very chilly. The waiter later told us that HE had to fight to get her to comp that dish - all she wanted to do was send over a lousy dessert. Really? For four people? Seems like she had a busy night, having TWO TABLES send back underdone sea bass, and she was cranky about it. So when management tries to placate a dissatisfied customer by turning rude, condescending, thoughtless and unfriendly, it's time to make a change.  You guys ARE trying to partner with Symphony Center guests, right? Or to make enemies of them?  And serving the sea bass the second time after slicing it in half and broiling it was just plain stupid. No self-respecting chef at a fine dining establishment would ever dare present something so shameful. It was as though they were saying,""See what you get for sending it back?""  The rabbit gnocchi was good. Wine was good. Front of house, not so good. General vibe for Symphony Center subscribers - we're tired of having you here!",-0.9829,0.756,0.086,0.158,0.4136228951926627
2011-12-21,4.0,"We had a pre-performance meal on a Sunday night, so my parents treated the wife, my brother and me to dinner in the city. It wasn't mind-bogglingly spectacular, and it was pricey, but overall I had positive impressions of the food. For appetizers, we shared grilled calamari, the marinated seafood salad and roasted beets, although that one was mostly consumed by my brother. The calamari was very tasty and tender, not rubbery. I appreciate that. The marinated seafood salad was interesting (cold octopus... again, interesting) but held its own. And what little I had of the roasted beets was really good. For whatever reason they really overload on the pine nuts here. Moving on, dinner was spinach ricotta gnocchi for the wife (I'm not a gnocchi fan, but it had a good, deep spinach flavor) and cacciucco for me. Cacciucco is a Ligurian seafood stew, and although the broth wasn't 5-star material, I really liked how the seafood was breaded and pan-seared just right. At some point a piece of the sirloin ended up on my plate, and thankfully, it had the best crust of any sirloin I've had in recent memory... and I don't even really like steak. I had bits of the capon and skatewing, and both were good (the latter being a very flaky but tender fish that had goodly amounts of flavor). I ordered truffle parmesan fries... the parm was very good. The truffle, I could barely tell was there. My wife said it was there, so I took her word for it. Although somewhat thinly cut, they were still nice and tender on the inside. They came with ketchup and an aioli sauce that tasted a bit like Caesar salad dressing. For dessert, we had the torrone tart (served with an excellent coffee gelato; the crispy texture of the tart was a nice surprise as well) and ricotta fritters (good for people who don't like chocolate, but I can't really get into non-savory uses of ricotta... also, the vanilla gelato was speckled with vanilla beans and fantastic).

I came here on a whim with my mom on a cold evening as neither of us wanted anything too over-the-top but didn't want to go the chain restaurant or hotel bar-eats route. I remember coming here over the summer and enjoying the cocktail offerings, but had not eaten anything. I am pleased to say that the food offerings bumped this place up another star in my book, as did the ability to get a table on Friday night with only a nominal wait time. The wines by the glass offerings are solid. Both my mom and I started off with glasses of red--valpolocella and malbec, if I remember correctly. We shared the roasted beet antipasti, an excellent dish as it allowed the flavors to really show through. We both ordered pasta for a main course. My mom opted for the pappardele with wild boar ragu and I had the maccheroni, with mushrooms. Now, I will state that I have not ordered pasta in a restaurant in over a year, as the portions tend to be mountainous. The plates at Rhapsody made for a refreshing change as they were perfectly portioned and well executed.  Just when I thought the meal couldn't improve, it came time for dessert. Our server, who had been very attentive, though not hoveringly so, throughout the meal, clued us in that we could order gelatos or sorbets by the scoop, as the option of ordering a trio might have been overwhelming. My mom went with the cranberry sorbet; I went with the salted caramel gelato, a perfect finish to the meal. In fact, the gelato was so good, I almost wish Rhapsody sold it by the pint.

The decor is modern and tasteful. The menu is now Italian themed. There is a little outdoor sitting area attached to the restaurant which looks pretty in the summertime, but I never see anyone use that space, ever. I've been here a few times, and all the meals I've had here were mostly good, but pricey for a regular lunch. Service is attentive. They have a wide selection of drinks and cocktails.  Most recently I came here for a holiday party, where we were seated immediately upon arrival. We started off with the truffle parmesan fries... delicious!! Definitely a must try, with a classic aioli dipping sauce. Half of our table got various pastas or proteins and I ordered the marinated seafood salad like a dumbass.  (It was December and it was the holidays, why I bothered trying to have a light lunch still eludes me to this day...) Please do yourselves a favor and order the pastas or the protein dishes when you come here.  The seafood salad, though plentiful on the seafood, is super extremely heavy on the olive oil and very under-seasoned.  The seafood itself (which included an assortment of octopus, calamari and shrimp) was overcooked and rubbery. They also peeled the tomatoes in the salad, which lent to a slimy over slimy texture. Yick. Never again!!  I would come back to try the pastas. I'm hoping I just picked a bad dish last time.  It's a good place to keep on the lunch rotation since I'm in the area but I wouldn't make a special trip otherwise.",0.9876,0.797,0.154,0.049,0.455893511250654
2010-12-08,4.0,"My husband and I went to Rhapsody on a very cold night--it's proximity to the El was key for us--it's literally 100 ft. away from the train. The restaurant was dead, even at the prime hour of 7 pm, but a few tables of folks were in the expansive dining room. As another reviewer mentioned, there was no music, and so it did seem like a room full of silence except for the obnoxious conversation of a group of ladies nearby comparing how much money their husbands spent on jewelry for each of them. Fortunately, both the hostess and the waiter were quite friendly. We were immediately brought nice bread/focaccia (though it would've been nice if they were warm) and water. The wine that we ordered was fine (a cab and a zin) though as typical for restaurants, quite overpriced by the glass. We didn't do an appetizer as entree portions seemed to be very generous judging by other tables. I'm glad we didn't as the entrees were very big. My husband had the steak, which came with spinach and roasted potatoes, and I had the swordfish, which came with Israeli couscous, a tomato sauce base with green olives and caper berries. The steak, though with very typical accompaniments was good (so says my husband--I don't eat red meat), and came out piping hot, which we appreciated. My swordfish was delicious and sauced perfectly. My only complaint was that the caper berries, which are typically quite salty, tasted as though they had been packed in salt. Whew--lots of water needed! We had dessert--a chocolate concoction that was to come out with meringue and vanilla gelato. The chocolate cake was more like a dense brownie, and though there was some espresso flavor, I found it to be kind of leaden and not too tasty (it was also cold--straight out of the fridge). The accompanying chocolate sauce was cloyingly sweet, and the ice cream was somewhat freezer burned. I'd avoid dessert, or go for something different next time--like the poached pears. All in all, it was a nice dining experience--quite expensive, but we had a Groupon that helped out on the price. I also might try some of their appetizers as an entree if I were to go back again--next time in the summer or fall months so that the atmosphere could be enjoyed more.",0.9943,0.824,0.141,0.035,0.5492916666666666

I finally had an opportunity to try the food here after years of just passing by.  I would say that Rhapsody is on the higher end of places I've been to.

I had an opportunity to try the grilled baby octopus (for the appetizer) and roasted autumn squash ravioli. On a food rating scale for the appetizer, I'd give it a 3.5/5. It was grilled very well but the accompanying citrus, celery, borlotti beans, & parsley did not go well together. As for the ravioli, I'd give it a 5/5(!)...tasted like warm pumpkin pie with hints of cinnamon as a result of the brown butter sauce. There were a few leaves of sage that garnished the dish. Crispy and perfectly accompanied the dish. The ravioli filling just melts in your mouth. I remember saying something like, ""It's so good, I don't want to eat it too fast!""

2010-08-15,1.0,"A ONE-STAR REVIEW! My first ever. And I've had some pretty nasty food in my life. I guess this place deserves only one star because it is verrrrrrry mediocre food (at best), but pretends to be something much different than that. And, worse, it has the haughty air that no restaurant deserves to have. I have been to Rhapsody twice. Once, early when I moved to town, I was at a show downtown on a Saturday night with a guest and they wanted a cocktail after our show let out. Since I was new to town, I didn't really know where to go -- we walked past Rhapsody and went in. It was maybe 10:30 at night, and their bar was filled with people -- no chairs, and the possibility for quiet conversation. So, I approached the maitre d  and explained that we would like to sit in the restaurant, but were planning on having just a cocktail. His response, ""Welllll, I guess so. But, it's going to take a while for someone to take care of you because we'll take care of the real customers first."" Niiiiiice. This, mind you, when their restaurant section was 2/3 EMPTY. So, we roll our eyes and go in anyway. The service wasn't horrible, and our server was helpful. We had one cocktail each plus a cheese platter. The cheese were nice (but overpriced), but the bread basket was skimpy and we had to ask for more. My friend had a prosecco and I was fearful that they would serve something flat this late at night, but, they didn't. The SECOND time I went back, I went for a business lunch. My workplace was taking a small group of people to Rhapsody for lunch. Great, I thought! Now I can try it for the food, and, won't have to pay for it myself! OK -- I don't eat meat. And, there isn't much on the menu for this caveat. I had the one thing available to me -- a gnocchi dish. Everyone else had lunch salads overflowing off their plates. Some had an accompaniment of fries. From here, I should have taken my cue -- people who have been here before, and they order the salad. Uh-oh. My gnocchi dish -- from the lunch menu, and costing more than their sandwiches -- came out with about 6 small gnocchi. That's it. No side dishes, nothing. It was supposed to be gnocchi in browned butter with toasted pine nuts. How hard it that, right? Well, each one of my six gnocchi was burned, as were my pine nuts. Burn the pine nuts, people, do it again! I was so frickin' hungry during this lunch (which is quite embarrassing in a business setting) that I stole my table-mate's fries. The fries are worth getting, by the way. But I had hoped to have a real meal. So, this place sucks. And it sucks because the food is of mediocre quality. But it also sucks because it is resting lazily on its burnt and well-placed laurels. It thinks it has its market cornered and identified -- only ""old"" people go to the symphony, right? So, let's prepare a menu for them. While that may have been true a decade ago, it is no longer true - especially at the CSO. C'mon, Rhapsody, take advantage of the tremendous opportunity you have available to you! Fantastic location! Partnership with the CSO! Great visibility! HUGE space! Now, just make some good food (and train your staff to provide better service) to go along with it.

We ordered the Wednesday ""bucket of bubbly"" special, and it took them 15 minutes to actually find the champagne. We waited about 20-25 minutes before anyone took our order. We'd intended to stop by for drinks and appetizers and catch an express train home afterwards, but soon realized that wasn't going to happen. It took two hours to wrap things up. BUT -- the food was fantastic. Started with the lump crab cake--delish. Tried a grilled romaine salad for the first time and enjoyed it despite the anchovy garnish.

2010-07-16,2.0,"Pros: Truffle fries are excellent Cons: This special friend of mine that I go to 1st base with and I asked to be seated outside. We were seated only to realize we were stuck between the noisy El tracks overhead and a really loud group of drunk middle-aged waspy types. Yes, Docksiders and Polo shirts and white wine were present at their table.  We were prepared to deal with the unpleasant din in exchange for dining al fresco (which, btw, is NOT the same as the soft drink Fresca). Every so often the noise would cease and we were able to enjoy the silence, but as minutes passed with a waiter or two walking right past our table, it appeared words were very unnecessary. After about 10-15 minutes of this, we went back to the host stand and asked to be reseated inside, hoping for a server. While a light calorie free soda with a hint of grapefruit may have made it tolerable to remain outdoors, we made the decision to forgo the garden in favor of some service that may actually allow us to utilize the groupon we were toting. Totes. This worked in our favor, as we did eventually receive some food and drinks.  With the exception of the truffle fries, the food seemed either underseasoned, or just oddly seasoned. The Berkshire Pork Loin could have been a great dish, as the pork was cooked perfectly, but it was served with this really bitter spiced fruit. I don't understand who thought that would be a pleasant combination.  The asparagus ""salad"" (as pictured in the photo section of this Yelp page) could have been delicious, but instead was hilarious. A very small amount of asparagus spears were topped with what was essentially a Scotch Egg, less the sausage, and half a slice of bacon. Despite being what was probably pound-for-pound the least healthy ""salad"" ever invented at the time, somehow it tasted almost like nothing unless your bite was fortunate enough to include a piece of bacon.  What really chapped our asses though, was the double espresso. They were out of espresso glasses. Fair enough, bring it in a coffee cup. What arrived at our table, however, would be an insult to the entire House of Maxwell. I don't think it would pass for espresso or even coffee from a vending machine in a blind taste test.  At the end of our meal, I went in search of the loo and was invited to use the public water closet in the lobby of the adjacent building. Picture the best condition you've ever seen a port-o-john in.

It's walking distance from our office, but just far enough away that it's never one of our usual dining destinations for special occasions. On that note alone, it was nice to go someplace different for a change. The four of us couldn't be more different in our food habits. One of my coworkers is a vegetarian, another doesn't eat any vegetables, anything with sauces, or basically anything even remotely more adventurous than a hambuger. My boss, who's on a perpetual diet, always orders a salad; the funny thing is she's one of those people who thinks a barbecue chicken salad or a cobb salad is a ""diet"" choice. Then there's me: all I want is good food that's well-prepared. It doesn't have to be anything fancy; I just don't want anything mediocre. Life's too short for that. We arrived for our reservation and I was pleasantly surprised at the space. It was lovely, airy, and modern. Fancy, but not too fancy, and there's an outdoor garden adjacent to the dining room. The vegetarian and I both ordered the spring asparagus risotto. My unadventurous coworker, to no one's surprise, ordered a burger. My boss, however, deviated from her standard salad, and instead ordered the crawfish and rock shrimp po' boy, proclaiming this to be the ""cheat day"" of her diet. Uh huh. I was really excited for the risotto as the menu description sounded postively mouth-watering: creamy risotto, fresh asparagus, goat cheese mousse, crispy shallots, orange syrup, and fresh herbs. It arrived and it looked wonderful. Sadly, it looked a whole lot better than it tasted. The risotto was glue-y (the result of not being cooked properly), and the overwhelming taste was sickeningly sweet. I'm not sure if that was from the orange syrup, but there was absolutely no balance of flavor in this dish at all. It was utterly disappointing. My coworker that also ordered this dish didn't comment to me one way or the other, so I have no idea if she liked it or not. My other coworker was nice enough to give me a taste of her burger and it was very good; as were the fries. I'd probably give this place another try and order that. I was hoping dessert would be my salvation, but my boss declined before I could order anything. Sigh. This could only mean one thing - that cupcakes from Sugar Bliss were waiting back at the office.

At $12 a piece, the cocktails aren't good enough for me to spend my money on, but they are quite good. Bar Menu: Rhapsody serves up a great burger.

While i would give their burger a 5-star rating, other items on the bar menu are more in the 3-star category, and the shrimp cocktail is pathetic. Service: Top notch!

The interior always seemed so quiet when I went, which can be a minus, but really seemed to fit the atmosphere. I think it would be a great place to eat before a symphony. They also have an outside seating area which is nice for a little more casual dining. I really enjoyed their bread. The crust was so crispy and the butter tasted so fresh that it made the whole experience really enjoyable. Usually I can't help eating the bread and always feel guilty about it, but not this time. The pate was also quite nice, some sort of amalgamation of different things, not like a normal pate. The pork belly was pretty good too, just the right amount of crispiness in the skin. They also managed to keep it from becoming too oily. They have a wide selection of desserts, including brownies with bacon bits. I had a blueberry sorbet that was lovely.

My boyfriend ordered the game hen and it was also delicious.  I ususally am not a fan of creamed veggies, but the side of creamed corn his entree came with was so good I was scraping up the stragglers from across the table when he was done.

As far as the food, the bar menu offers about 15 items, all of which range from $7 - $20 and could be described as rustic gourmet. We both love the bread that is brought to the table, sliced, warm and crusty along with a little dish of butter.  I usually get the soup  and Rhapsody does a great job with it. Yesterday it was a spring pea soup with a bit of parmesan and nuts swirled in: simple elegance. Grandma got a flatbread with carmelized onions, taleggio cheese and arugula with fig vinegar. The sweetness of the onions complemented the richness of the cheese and sharpness of the greens  beautifully. I liked the fact that the arugula was plentiful, if a bit unwieldy (hence the ""rustic"".)  For dessert we split a selection of petit fours. They were a generous portion but next time I'd go for something else, as they weren't  classic tea cakes but miniature brownies, cheesecakes and cookies that were overly sweet and kind of meh, like they could have come from Costco. We also each got a glass of Rose wine  that was very nice (chosen because it was the cheapest glass at $7)  but succeeded in getting my 95 pound grandma slightly drunk, which though fun can be a little perilous due to her limited eye sight.

On my most recent visit- we did not have to rush to get to the symphony- so once 7pm rolled around- we pretty much had the place to ourselves.  We started with a couple of appetizers- crab cakes that were quite good and a blue cheese fondue served with crispy bread. What can ever be wrong with CHEESE? Nothing says my Wisconsin trained palate!  Then on to dinner. I had the striped bass and my friend had the sirloin. Ans as sides, we added on some of the best mashed potatoes I have had in awhile (you could taste the butter and cream) and some fresh asparagus. While not a fancy dinner with swirls of sauces and decorated plates- it was satisfying, delicious and just what I expected.  We finished catching up over some coffee and by this time we were the only people in the place, but that didn't matter. They didn't make us feel rushed but just the opposite- they took the time to make sure our coffee cups were full and even comped us their Chocolate Symphony dessert which was an amazing concoction of lava cake, a chocolate peanut candy bar along with a chocolate lollipop. Yes- there really is such a place as chocolate heaven.  Next time you have tickets to the Symphony or are just looking for a place to grab some simple food without all the foam puffs and swirls that are all the rage these days- check Rhapsody out.

The service was just ok.. and compared to other fine dining restaurants that are still kind of fun and casual, Rhapsody felt a bit stuffy. Lots of suits in there. Still, we had a good dinner. For a starter we split a daily special of seared scallops. I haven't had scallops in a really long time and these were really good. The portion was a bit small. I think the dish was $10 and you only got 2 scallops. For wine we split a half bottle of Matanzas Creek Sauvignon Blanc. It was nice and crisp and refreshing. For an entree mom got the pork tenderloin that was cooked with apples. I got a wild striped bass. Surprisingly, after our starter, the entrees were pretty good sized. We each enjoyed what we ordered. We also split a side of first of the season peas with mint, almonds and preserved lemon. They were so fresh and flavorful. I spotted a dessert next to us that I thought looked interesting, so we ordered it to finish off our dinner. It was called chocolate symphony.

2007-03-01,4.0,"I work on Jackson and met a friend here for a quick lunch mid-business day.  We were seated immediately, it was spacious, not too loud, and brightly light from all of the large panelled glass windows.  Our server was attentive but not pushy and I had an incredible winter vegetable risotto.  My friend had the lamb shank sandwich which comes with everyones' fave....sweet potatoe fries!  Highly recommend for a nice lunch on an hour time crunch (excuse the rhyme).",0.9549,0.787,0.213,0.0,0.6465079365079365
2007-01-25,3.0,"Stopped by for a snack before meeting a friend at a gallery.  We sat in the bar and had the steak frites which didn't really seem all that special or worth $14.  Noticed that they charged $10 for a bottle of Flat Tire beer... I don't drink but I know enough to know that is insane.  But to be fair I haven't actually had dinner there yet, so my review is just based on the bar appetizer experience, I'd still give it a chance for a dinner.",0.5346,0.802,0.124,0.073,0.43705357142857143
2006-02-08,1.0,"Although this upscale restaurants is considered to be one of the best restaurants in Chicago, I will not be going back.  We must have been there on an off night because my friend and I both ordered the salmon medallions and when they were served, there was the most offensive smell coming from the plate.  It smelled awful and no one at the table wanted us to eat it.  I hate sending food back at restaurants and have only done it one other time, but we had to because it was that bad.  They didn't seem to notice the smell or think anything was wrong with it, and when they brought it back, I'm convinced they brought us back the same thing because it was even worse.  The other people at the table had us send it back again because the smell was making them lose their appettite.  We stopped at McDonald's afterwards for food.",-0.9571,0.799,0.047,0.154,0.4213541666666667
2005-12-08,4.0,"To prepare for the Y-Me race, Rhapsody was offering a special pink drink where the proceeds went to the Y-Me race.  Hence, I came here ready to drink pink with some friends and we had a blast.  Dessert was beautiful and it was a shame to ruin its appearance to finally eat it but it was delish.  Lovely place to unwind after work or getting into concert mode.",0.8338,0.763,0.178,0.06,0.6316326530612245
2005-11-01,4.0,The atomsphere of the restaurant is very elegant and is a great place to stop before or after a show at the Symphony Orchestra.  The food is very unique and tastes great! The bread and salads that start out your meal are very fresh. It does get very crowded before and after a big show so if you plan on eating here you may want to attempt to make a reservation.,0.9271,0.772,0.2,0.028,0.65
2005-10-28,5.0,"I have been here several times for post-concert relaxing. Attached to Symphony Center, it's great in the winter to head right there. Beautiful ambiance and if you get there at the right time, you may see members of the orchestra.  This is a great place for any post-theater outing, not just the CSO. Tasty coffee drinks (alcohol & non) as well as artistic desserts. Not too expensive, the desserts are the kind you want to look at for 10-minutes and feel bad when you dig in and ruin the design. They taste as good as they look!",0.9516,0.72,0.217,0.063,0.6281746031746032
2005-08-19,5.0,"Located in Symphony Center, home of the city's orchestra, this is a fine-dining destination unto itself. The primarily contemporary American menu is inventive and stylish, but your best options are old-fashioned standards like turkey pot pie with a sage-infused cream sauce and grilled loin of lamb. Be sure to save room for dessert - the fantasy sorbet plate, including mango and coconut flavors topped with threads of spun sugar and surrounded by a mosaic of fresh fruit, is as beautiful as it is delicious. When weather permits, there's a beautiful garden for alfresco dining. Non-ticket holders would be wise to make a reservation for post-curtain time, when the dining room clears and a sense of calm-after-the-storm prevails.",0.9921,0.711,0.289,0.0,0.6546296296296297
2005-07-30,5.0,"Rhapsody is located behind Symphony Center, so it is a natural thought to dine here before or after a concert. The beautiful interiors are fancy but still casual, and may keep you from wanting to dine in the lush and secluded outdoor garden. The fresh bread is delicious, along with the marvelous main dishes. My lamb shank was an enormous plate, whereas my girlfriend liked the shrimp but wished the serving were larger. My fancy dessert featured three mini-treats on the same plate, a better deal than a plate of cookies.",0.9807,0.742,0.258,0.0,0.6016666666666667
