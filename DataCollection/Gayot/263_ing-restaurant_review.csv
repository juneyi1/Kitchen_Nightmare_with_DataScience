Some way better than others, but overall experience was outstanding. The decor mixed with the server's head to toe black attire made me feel like i was in a modern art museum. This place is all about the experience -- which is a huge part of what molecular gastronomy offers. It's visually and sensory pleasing. The miracle berry was something else! It's from Africa and they dried it to prolong its shelf life. Eating it turns anything you eat that's acidic to sweet tasting -- I was blown away! It's always the little things that captivate you. Loved every part of my experience from start to finish. The meal was also more affordable than other high-end, experiential restaurants.

2014-06-07,1.0,"We came for the Salvador Dali special for Restaurant Week. And have been trying to blot it out of our collective memories since, while simultaneously regretting the hasty decision to mortgage our children to pay for it.  The only good thing I can say about the overall experience is that the waiter brought a second plate of lemons to extend the miracle berry pill experience beyond the two slivers of citrus provided by default. (Hey, folks, do you realize that the taco place two blocks down will give you these for free? Yes, heroically, even as we suffer through the Great Lime Famine of 2014. As for the miracle berry tablets, they can be bought off of Amazon for ~$1.40 each.) The slimy ""melting clock"" applique on the second course was roughly the texture of snot, and tasted about the same: bland while simultaneously obstructing and sliding down your esophagus... a little like diphtherae (don't scrape, you'll just make it worse). The tables are about two feet apart and the wait staff cultivate a smug self-important veneer. Something like, ""I work at a fancy restaurant, but I could not care less about customer service because it interferes with my sherry-sipping art student"" attitude.  The main course, a chorizo stew, was an inferior version of homemade, i.e. impossibly salty. In spite of this, water refills were infuriatingly slow. As we slowly died of internal desiccation, dessert finally arrived: a mangled piece of stainless steel supporting what could generously be described as two dots of Trader Joe's cherry and apricot jams and one dot of Trader Joe's cookie butter. This, friends, is what passes for luxury and innovation. I, lolcat, am not amused and would rather scavenge my owner's still-hanging duck prosciutto from the patio hooks than pay another $60/person to come again (and that's not including tax or tip). As I sit, still gulping down my Pedialyte, forever rehydrating (FOREVER rehydrating), I beg you to reconsider your kidneys. By the way, I still have one child remaining.

A friend and I came here for the Salvador Dali inspired menu.The dishes were artfully presented and the descriptions sounded creative. But taste was just not there. The first course was a beet salad which came with a miracle berry pill for ""flavor tripping."" The server instructed us to tasted the profile of dish before the pill, then to take it and re-taste the dish. All of a sudden, everything tasted sweet, and the dish took on a different personality. Flavor tripping was definitely the highlight of the meal. While it is a unique idea, the bottom line is that it is gimmicky, and cannot truly enhance an otherwise normal dish. The second course was a tomato and sausage soup that was pretty unmemorable. The dessert course was an amalgam of unidentifiably-flavored schmears of sauces and a long slice of nougat. It looked lovely but tasted average. iNG wants to be creative, but sacrifices taste for presentation. This is a shame since it has to compete with lots of nearby restaurants that strike a great balance between taste, creativity, and artistry.

2014-03-28,1.0,"Completely SHOCKED at the positive reviews for this place. Quite honestly, I think this place is a borderline scam.  The profit margin they must make on each diner must be MASSIVE and they make the dishes ""creative"" to distract from the fact that nothing tastes good and they are serving you two bites of bland chicken and fish. We were not impressed at all. We went for the Chicago ""beer menu"".  It was really expensive for what you get and we almost left hungry.  Not a single dish amongst the 6 was memorable or made an impression on us. Nothing tasted great.   Plus, for $300 bucks for two people - and bite sized portions - there better be some steak, lobster, truffles, etc....but I think the best protein based dish we got was some variation on beer can chicken.  WTF? Not to mention, drinking 6 different beers in a sitting isn't for everybody especially the ladies at the table.  It's trying to be some fancy, foodie spot but the food just falls well short for it to be that type of place. The decor and ambience are also lacking.  It's super bright in there and has some sort of weird red theme.  The whole feel of the place is awkward  and we all couldn't wait to leave.  When we finally got to the Aviary next door afterwards, it felt like a relief. Finally, I have a suspicion that gratuity was added for our party of four and our waitress didn't point this out so we tipped on top of that.  That is just unethical if you ask me. Not that the service was bad - but if gratuity is included (especially for a smaller party), I think the server needs to speak up on that.

My issues with the restaurant were that the portions were teeny tiny, and I left needing to go to another restaurant for more food.  The price for the food and beer pairing was $120 (20% gratuity was automatically added in for a party of two which I found very strange).  You should never leave a restaurant hungry after having spent $120 a person.  That's just pure ridiculousness. I also saw the other items we missed from not having the 10 course menu, and they were equally small.   So essentially the flavor was great, but the value was missing.  I think if I had been satisfied when I left I would have given them 4 stars, perhaps 4.5, but u less you have money to burn, you will be pretty unsatisfied when you leave.

For me, I'd never been to a molecular gastronomy place before and was quite concerned by what I was getting myself into. I had seen the menu ahead of time and wasn't quite I was going to like what was coming. Fortunately, I was wrong. Upon getting there, I was up for switching to the six or seven course menu, but because my friend was sticking with the four, we couldn't eat without matching courses. So four it was! And they were all good. The menu changes, and I don't remember most of the details after a month, but I'll share what I remember: 1) The miracle berry, which turned sour into sweet, was incredible. The first course was a beet dish of some sort and I hate beets - and yet this tasted great. Certainly enhanced by the berry. Sucking on a lemon wedge after consuming the berry made the lemon taste like lemonade. Crazy. 2) Everything was beautiful. Highlight for me was the dish that looked like the melting clocks painting of Dali's. It was some form of goat cheese panna cotta with some roasted potatoes and mushrooms underneath. There was also a chickpea curry dish. Dessert was on the weak side, from my POV, but still was beautiful and interesting. Not sure I necessarily need to go again - although with a seasonally changing menu, they probably are worth a ""summery"" look - but I was glad I at least experienced it once.

The good: The food was amazing.  Some of it was really good, and some of it was fantastic. We went to the Dali menu, and it was indeed Spanish and slightly surreal.  Real, earthy flavors of Spanish cuisine spiraled with a very Dali'esque eccentricity.  The fish stew for example.  A simple concept.  Very clean flavors. Exquisitely prepared and surprisingly Delicious. The flavor trippings were mind blowing.  The beet dish was fine.  You try it, Ok, and now take your magic pill (hehe) and HOLY SH*T! Unbelievable.  Its like everything comes to life.  Everything makes sense.  The other flavor tripping dessert was also awesome. We Want More Flavor Tripping! I loved the bean dish as well. Other than that, the other dishes were also very good.  I have to note the dish with the food swirling in the air and served in a battle ship board game type metal box with a spoon suspended in air. A bit odd, and a little too silly.  You sank my rosemary spoon! My real criticism with the food is that many of the dishes felt in ways reflections of other dishes.  But with Spanish cuisine, there is the expectation of some repetition. There was maybe tiny bit too much in some of the dishes.   Seriously though.  More flavor trippings. The not so good.  The service was Very friendly.  They were great people and always treated us with respect.  However, they were clearly rushed.  Its as if someone took off work suddenly and everyone else was scampering to cover. They needed at least one or two more pair of arms to cover the load and the restaurant wasn't even that full.  Sometimes we waited very long periods of time before courses and sometimes they were every prompt.  At this level of dining (and to get 5 stars) there needs to be some consistency here. Aside from the service (which was both helpful and friendly), I was not especially impressed with the overall atmosphere and decor.  The seats are not especially comfortable plastic, and I feel like for the ultra creative tone of the food, the decor could be a bit more edgy and notable than the standard brick wall and the single large red bubble window (which I dig).  Some of the wine/beer pairings were a tad bit off as well (especially the sweet German semi-dessert wine in the middle of the meal) while others we perfect. Overall, great dining experience which definitely caters and lives up to the expectation of a Moto, Alinea, Next, L20-Lite.  But for the price-point... can you really complain when that's what we ALL knew going in?  Of course not.

2014-02-06,3.0,"Let me start by saying that this is an experience, not just a restaurant and if you are looking for a steak and potatoes, with big portions, do not come here.  I came for restaurant week with my sister and had a great 4-course meal ($44) and added the drink pairings for $20.  I was a little sceptical going into dinner and thought I would need to stop and get food on the way home because the portions would be so small.  That being said, I left not just satisfied, but full and the food was delicious.   The service was satisfactory, but I would have liked an explanation of how things were made or why they were made the way they were.  The atmosphere in the restaurant is pretty minimalist, but seems like it's trying a little too hard in my opinion.  The tables are also pretty close to each other, although there are not a lot of tables in the restaurant.  I still felt as though I was on a date with the couple sitting next to us, so it was a bit awkward.   I think the restaurant would have gotten 4 stars if it weren't for the situation with the valet.  When we first pulled up there was no sign for the valet, so I initially pulled up to Aviary, next door and asked if I could valet there.  He politely directed us back to iNG and went to get the valet for the restaurant.  When we had paid the bill I gave our waiter the valet ticket and we slowly finished the last of our drinks and got our coats from the hostess. And then we had to wait for 30 minutes to get our car.  The hostess went out to check on the valet and invited us to have a seat at the bar along with the 2 other couples waiting for their car.  There was another man outside, who I can only assume was the valet supervisor.  He gave a couple coming in a valet ticket, but didn't bother to help the actual valet with the cars, just directed him on what to do, even though he saw 3 couples waiting for their cars.  I was just disappointed having a great meal with good service and then having it end on such a sour note.  I will note, the actual valet going to get the cars was extremely pleasant and friendly.  I think they just need another valet on duty, or a manager who is willing to help out when necessary. The menu changes here quite frequently, but below is my attempt to describe the 4-course restaurant week menu, as best I can. We started with a beet salad and puree with a beet and honey drink paired.  This course came with the miracle berry where you ate a bit of the meal and then put the miracle berry on your tongue to dissolve and then you eat the rest of the meal.  I was amazed, the miracle berry really does make everything sweeter.  They give you a lemon to try before and after eating the berry and it was amazing because the lemon tasted like lemonade, I couldn't get enough.  The beet course was good, and got better after the berry, but the drink was not so good, although it was served in a cute honey comb cup. Second course was a cheese and mushroom and potato and two kinds of sauces.  When you mixed the sauces and the stuff together it was delicious, although I wasn't a huge fan of any of the components individually.  This course came with the most delicious beer, brewed here in Chicago.  I think I might go pick up a 6-pack of it, and I'm not a big beer drinker. Third course was a bean stew.  Let me start by saying that I do not like beans.  I do not like any kind of bean, cooked any kind of way.  This stew, however, was delicious and I almost licked the bowl.  It was a little spicy with a great garlic toast and chorizo and some kale in it.  I still cannot believe that I ate that many beans, and I would do it again in a heartbeat.  This was by far my favorite course.  It paired well with a nice red wine. Fourth course was dessert course and had a marshmallow encased nut bar and four or five different sweet sauces.  It was delicious, the only thing I wish was that the dessert had a bit more crunch.  The crunchiness of the nuts was taken away a bit by the marshmallow. Overall, a great meal.  The servings are tiny seeming (except the bean soup, which was generous), but I left not just satisfied, but full.  The restaurant would have scored a 4 if it weren't for the horrible valet situation.  I'll try it again for sure when they have a different menu to try.",0.9993,0.787,0.178,0.034,0.5505977496483825

Also, the wine/beer/cocktail pairings were superb.      The problems started on first impressions (isn't that the most that sticks to your mind?). We came in and the hosting staff was just acting weird; we came in 1/2 hour before our reservation to have a drink at the bar and when we told them that, they just looked at us with a confused look on their faces; not a smile, not much of a reaction, they just stared and mumbled something that I couldn't hear. I went ahead and showed myself to the bar because they were creeping me out. I sit at the bar for a good 5 minutes and the bartender with the big Yosemity Sam mustache didn't even make eye contact. We finally got some drink menus and ordered (drinks were delicious). When he was pouring the drinks, he attempted to mumble what was in it; the dude could not even look at us while he was talking.

2014-01-27,5.0,My brain exploded at dinner and I'm still trying to piece it together to write this review. I was here during restaurant week for the 4 course Dali tasting menu.  Start with flavor tripping on the miracle berry eating beets. Beets are one of my fav foods but the miracle berry took the dish to another level. Insane. Crazy. Even a piece of lemon is a completely new experience. The melting clocks on the potatoes and mushrooms was a work of art but also delicious. The tuna fishing was a beautiful firm fish on a puréed potato in a French onion broth. Dessert was nougat with apricot and pistachio butter. Service was beautifully curated and not stuffy in the least bit. Don't expect to be super stuffed after the four course tasting but it's the perfect way to be satisfied but still wanting to come back to see what is in store next time. It's a total steal for restaurant week.,0.9851,0.736,0.206,0.058,0.6380808080808081

2014-01-03,5.0,"Last night I dined at Ing and had the 10 course ""street food"" tasting menu with pairings. Ing stands for ""imagining new gastronomy"" and today Chef Havidic and the talented kitchen at Ing restaurant showed me what that means to them. I'll admit to being slightly biased. I am an intern at Ing's predecessor next door, Moto and I see most of the Ing team on a daily basis in staff meetings shared by the sister restaurants.  I tried my best to remain objective and was just that much more blown away.  The first course to hit the table was a flavor changing ""Som Tom"". On the plate was a bed of green papaya foam, topped with a spicy Thai swimmers crab salad, and seared grape tomatoes that tasted like grapes after taking the miracle berry. The dish transformed from light and citrusy to sweet and umami.  To eat such a complex dish while using the miracle berry is an amazing epicuri-surreal experience to have. It was also paired with a flavor changing cocktail called ""Spirit of Siam"", a combination of lychee, coconut, ginger and lemongrass flavors. It was absolutely bright and refreshing and delicious.  The second course was probably my favorite savory course of the night. ""Elotes"" a take on the Mexican corn on the cob. There where mounds of roasted corn with a corn butter and chili gels. Also on the plate, there were a few bites of huitlacoche gel, a corn fungus known as the Mexican truffle. This dish will give me good food dreams for the next few days probably.  ""Falafel"" was an amazing deconstructed fresh pita with falafel. There was a baba ganoush puree, brunoised cucumber and a Greek yogurt sauce that was made in house with a 100 year old culture. I wanted to soak up every last drop of sauce with the fresh house made pita.  Paired with a light bright brut cava with lemony notes that complimented the fresh house made Greek yogurt and pita delightfully.  With a name like ""poor man's lobster roll"" I had no idea what to expect for the next course. Although I was not expecting that the monkfish would have the same appeal as lobster in a lobster roll, (hence ""poor man's"") it was cooked perfectly, and the other components in the dish really bumped the dish up. The fish was topped with bacon lardons and laid on top of a few huge swirls of a celery root/onion puree that was buttery and delectable. There where also spots of bacon citrus sauce that I wish had come across a little more strongly. The dish also included potatoes prepared different ways; roasted fingerling segments, crispy thin strips of potato, and a purple Peruvian potato salad with chive batons.  It was a gorgeous presentation and paired well with the 2010 Ravines, Chardonnay from the Finger Lakes in New York, which was bright and airy. It had notes of citrus fruit and almost had a sweet quality to it. It felt very balanced and very inline with the flavor profile of the dish.  The ""Street Tacos"" course was kind of an insane take on tacos, dehydrated-puffed-crispified mini tortias with mole verde, pig face -cojita- crema, and slices of fresh avocado. Topped with a crushed dehydrated chili that imparted texture and flavor. I liked the playfulness of the dish and the ability to build and customize your own taco, or to simply taste the ingredients individually. It was a fun and interactive course. Paired with a Oaxacan dark ale by 5 Rabbit,  called 5 Vulture locally made in Illinois using a similar process to mole, which gave it strong mole flavor which was beautiful with the mole in the dish itself.   ""Fork Roast"" was one course that I was really looking forward to after seeing some pictures of it up on Ing's Facebook page.  There was a char siu-fried rice-dumpling with ""forbidden"" black rice, crispy duck leg confit (oh my god yum), seared duck breast, pork sausage won ton, and bok choy puree. The confit just melted in my mouth, and the flavors in the forbidden black rice dumpling really packed a punch. That element of the dish had some heat to it, which I like a lot. It was really nice to get a bite of some of the rice with a piece of the seared duck breast or confit on the fork. I had fun mixing and matching bites with this course.  The pairing for this course was a beer that tasted more like a wine than a beer. It was a really interesting beer; I had never had anything like it before.  ""Korean BBQ"" with short ribs, roasted nori, sautéed spinach, glass noodles, sautéed miatake mushrooms... It had the comforting feel to it of being at home on a rainy Sunday and ordering Chinese take out. The toasty umami flavors were so rich and inviting. By this point in the meal I was feeling so full from the rich flavors. This course had a wonderful red pairing. This was a great cap to all the savory courses.  ""Snow cone"" was the first desert. This was a miracle berry changing course, as it started off as very tart and much like a refreshing palate cleanser, it moved into a sweet rich desert. The plate looked just gorgeous. There was a plum lemon ice in a crunchy waf",0.9993,0.775,0.189,0.036,0.4847034408890079
2013-12-22,5.0,"To call Ing a restaurant is unfair. Ing is an experience - whimsical, alcohol-fueled, surprising, and most importantly: delicious. As a relative noobie to the molecular gastronomy scene I was expecting an excellent experience, but I was also prepared to experience pretentiousness, food that is made to look good rather than taste great, and tiny potions. Ing is none of these things, and completely changed my perception of this style of dining.  The Salvador Dali-inspired tasting menu dishes were astoundingly creative, taking inspiration from Dali's works and quotes and transforming them into food and drink. Not only was every dish aesthetically amazing, it was nearly impossible to select a favorite. Nearly everything on every plate was lick-the-bottom-of-the-plate delicious (and in solid quantity). The alcohol pairings were spot-on and bountiful. By the end of the meal you're a solid 4-5 drinks in, and the cocktails are no-joke strong. Some dishes are paired with a pill, one that changes the taste of the food for a mind-blowing before/after tasting experience.  Extremely creative and delicious food, strong expertly-paired drinks, all backed by inspiration by Salvador Dali.

The first  3-4 courses of nightmare before christmas started strong, but then quickly dropped off. I would also recommend not getting the drink pairings. They don't tell you that you can do this, but it was itemized on the bill-and they were almost half the price. This would normally be reasonable, but they are very far from a full drink (eg 1/4 of a beer). I kinda felt gipt from that...and most of the specialty ones were kinda gross. You'd do much better by ordering a bottle of wine or couple beer/cocktails you actually like.",0.9583,0.791,0.18,0.029,0.4747619047619047

I felt like flavor was sacrificed for inventiveness. To be honest, I prefer to have the street food items in their original form! The korean barbeque dish was way too salty. Otherwise, everything was well seasoned.  I didn't enjoy the decor very much. It felt tacky and not modern to me. The place was also way too quiet and pretty empty.  The service was amazing.

Most of the courses were ""deconstructed"" versions of dishes we recognized. Really creative, and a great night. The best part was the miracle berry that made everything sweeter! What a cool concept. The only thing I would say is that the portions were REALLY small. It was 10 courses of literally 1 bite each. Everyone (even the small females) in our group was starving afterwards. In my limited tasting menu experience, there's at least one course right before the palette cleanser that is substantial.

2013-08-21,5.0,"I have enjoyed all of iNG's themed menus in the past year, but their new Global Street Food menu is definitely my favorite thus far. This new menu is simply fantastic, available in both 6 course ($85) and 10 course ($105) versions. I went with the 10 course menu, of course. Here are the courses in Chef Tim Havidic's delicious new menu: 1. Som Tom (with miracle berry flavor tripping) Very nice, delicate balance of flavors. Really nice way to start the meal. Green papaya foam is a great idea and very tasty. Really enjoyed the Thai swimmer crab and thai coriander in this dish. iNG's ""Spirit of Siam"" pairing: a light and fresh way to start, and really compliments the dish nicely. I like how the lemongrass can be utilized as a straw as well as an aromatic and flavoring agent. 2. Elotes   Smells great (I always eat with my nose first). Corn salad is very tasty, and the huitlacoche custard is incredible. The Polenta tuile is delicious, too, and a very nice way to provide some crunch and sweetness to counterbalance the acidity of the corn salad. Vegetarians especially should be really excited bout this dish. 3. Falafel Beautifully plated deconstruction of falafel. Invites the diner to take control and decide how they want to go about eating it, which I always appreciate and embrace. Really enjoyed the eggplant in two different forms (fried and puréed as a baba ghanoush of sorts). Tzaziki yogurt sauce is excellent, and is made in house. I really appreciate the balanced complexity and visual artistry of this dish! 4. Poor Man's Lobster The monkfish is out of this world delicious. Wow. I really appreciate all of the accompanying elements, too. A few potatoes on the side would be sufficient anywhere else, but the iNG team is clearly going above and beyond with the multiple forms of potato and celery root, as well as the brioche pudding. Moto-like complexity and masterful combination of flavors---this is instantly one of my favorite iNG dishes of all time. Bravo! 5. Street Taco Another instant classic crowd-pleaser. So much flavor, but also such balance between everything on the plate. There is nothing else to say except this is a phenomenal dish. The Five Vultures beer pairing with this course is a really really nice beer on its own, but even better as a pairing with the taco. Fantastic. 6. Fork Roast Very generous amounts of duck, which I obviously appreciated, along with the different forms of duck for variety. Bok choy purée and rice are very nice accompaniments to the duck. Paired very nicely with Duchesse de Bourgogne Sour Ale. 7. Korean Barbeque The kalbi is melt-in-your-mouth tender and delicious, and the other elements on the plate are great accompaniments to the short rib. After the very rich duck course, this restores a lightness that helps segue to the desserts.  8. Snow Cone (with miracle berry flavor tripping) Plum! Really happy to see this, as I hardly ever see plum featured outside of a Japanese restaurant, and it seems there is so much potential for plum, especially with a dessert. Goes great with the almond waffle cone, which I also really enjoyed. This is a very aesthetically pleasing and inviting dish, especially with the edible lily petal. Also tastes really good on the miracle berry---a winner for all of us who don't love sweets, but still want to enjoy some tasty desserts. 9. Cannoli I particularly enjoyed the maraschino cherry and espresso reductions. Everything goes well together on this dish, and I liked the texture that the crushed cannoli shell and cannoli shell powder added to the cheesecake. Paid with the Nora spiced ale (Italy). I really liked this pairing and how it works with the pistachios and cherry, especially. 10. Churro I loved the cardamom and lime ice cream. Nice use of cinnamon in this dish, too. Really attractive, elegant plating. I like the way something we are all familiar with (a churro) is presented in a way we have not yet experienced. Paired with a mezcal horchata: now that's the way to end the meal with a bang! As always, my service at iNG was excellent. Trevor Rose-Hamblin is one of the most passionate and guest-oriented General Managers in the city, and his leadership rubs off on the entire service team at iNG. Also, iNG is happy to customize any menus for you if you have any food allergies or other dietary restrictions.

Started off with the whole miracle berry tablet thing which is kind of cool the first time but not really that interesting.  The first dish wasn't actually that different before and after and it looked ridiculous in a giant bowl.  It wasn't bad. This corn dish was actually really good, though I am not familiar with the dish it was trying to emulate.  It also didn't feel deconstructed like most of the menu. Again, none of the food was bad, but why am I eating a tiny deconstructed falafel sandwich of unexceptional quality? I actually can't recall the lobster roll, must have been just OK. Street tacos that are worse than actual street tacos, nuff said. Hey the first interesting dish in awhile.  Small array of things.  Dumpling was mediocre, char siu duck not char siuy, but good, and finally an unexceptional pulled duck.  The actually deep fried rice cube was intriguing but had too much carbon on it. Last savory dish was highlight.  Best jap che, gal bi whatever I have tasted.  Only dish that hit my expectations of the menu.  Reminding me of the street food while doing its own thing and of course being delicious. This snow cone was not as favorite as the last dish.  Didn't evoke snow cone as much as fruity Drumstick. You can call it a cannoli, but where was the tube? OMG they ruined churros.  Not sure why it was labelled as churros and then a bunch of other stuff dwarfs the churro. All the desserts were kind of typical hoity toity stuff t hat you have had at any Michelin restaurant.  Strangely only Topolobambo had an exemplary dessert worthy of a star, too bad the rest of the meal was a let down.

2013-08-05,5.0,"Over the past couple of years now iNG has been one of my favorite restaurants. Some of the friendliest staff in Chicago as well as incredibly creative, interesting (and generally delicious) cuisine. Every couple of months not just the menu changes completely, but the entire theme (i.e. Wonder Years, Nightmare Before Christmas, Scorsese, April Showers etc.). This whimsical aspect of the dinner leads me to really become excited about my visits.  Last year iNG came into their own and had some highly memorable meals, but earlier this year they lost a lot of talent and took just a small step backwards; I still enjoyed the first couple of menus of 2013, but not as much as last years'. Last week they rolled out their Street Food themed menu and this is definitely among iNG's best. They have reloaded with new talent and once again are firing on all cylinders. Newly named executive chef (Tim Havidic) is young, passionate and extremely talented; he has a real winner with his debut menu. Not to be outdone, iNG also landed a top notch pastry chef in Natalie Zarzour (former proprietress of highly acclaimed Pasticceria Natalina). This menu featured the best desserts I have ever consumed at iNG. Much like Moto brought on board Claire Crenshaw from Tru to elevate their desserts, now iNG's sweets are at the same level as the savories. The current menu is a success on every level. Ten courses of deconstructed street food; seven savories and three sweets (think Falafel, tacos, snow cones). Each course retains just enough key elements of the dish it is representing to be familiar, but is modern, whimsical and complex. Despite the myriad of ingredients the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts and I found all ten dishes to be hits; the first course sets the bar quite high but there is no drop off. The $105 price tag includes pairings; a mixture of craft beers, wines and unique cocktails that aside from an overly bitter horchata cocktail were all enjoyable and enhanced the meal. A less expensive six course menu is available upon request. iNG also does a wonderful job with non alcoholic pairings as well as accommodating allergies and even aversions. The current menu also features flavor tripping vis-a-vis the Miracle Berry with a couple of courses whereby the berry tricks your tongue into interpreting acidity as sweetness (resulting in a sweet element to these dishes without added sugars).  While iNG also lost some front of the house and bar staff that I had grown close to over my frequent visits, they have retained some key people that have been involved since the opening led by Trevor Rose-Hamblin (one of the best general managers in Chicago) as well as Jojet and Nathan. iNG has a solid track record of adding people who excel at being personable yet professional resulting in polished service yet an extremely warm ambiance and comfortable dining experience; the new hires appear to have these characteristics. We loved the Street Food menu so much we already made reservations to return next month and cannot wait to see what Chefs Havidic, Zarzour and company come up with for the fall.

2013-08-01,1.0,"I was so excited to go here for dinner after a romantic day out at Navy Pier. I was excited to try everything they had and the menu sounded interesting. What a letdown. I have no idea what these other reviews are about because the meal was not worth what we had paid for it. I had walked out there thinking that I would have better enjoyed a meal from a chain restaurant. Don't get me wrong, the service was amazing and most of the wines were really great. They start the meal by Developing Your Senses. They have this beet root vegetable mixture that you try then you place this tablet on your tongue and let it dissolve. The flavors change to sickingly sweet yuckiness. You try to take a drink of the wine pairing only to gag further on the sweetness.   Next, The Hidden Valley serving. The cauliflower was roasted to perfection, it had that brown butter flavor and melted on your tongue. The sauce with carrot and broccoli was good but not great. The Shrimp Cocktail was ok, nothing rememberable. The drink on the other hand was pure horseradish. I found myself choking a bit on the first sip of the intense black pepper flavor. Alphabet Soup was the dish I was a bit afraid of but it was amazing. I greedily drank the whole thing and was hoping my partner in crime wouldn't like it so I could have his. I thought that it was a bit of a stretch to call it Alphabet Soup, you're going to give beer to a kid? I love duck. Love love love duck. The Duck Waffles were a huge serving but there was nothing amazing about it. It was good, but dingy diner that is open at 4am after a long night of drinking good(get food in your belly regardless of what it is) not something you would eat when sober and come back to enjoy again good. The Honey Pot was the single most disgusting thing we had while we were there. Lavender is amazing in soap and lotions. Unfortunately too much of it tastes like soap in your mouth. The lavender foam with the too pungent cheese and then the ridiculous glob of honey. This just didn't mix well and after a small taste, neither of us touched it. I felt like he was trying to show what an amazing chef he is and how creative he is but this was the single worst thing that has ever passed my lips. I felt like my taste buds were in the Vietnam War of the culinary world.  Banana Spit was ok. I didn't get too much of the banana split flavor but it was good. The Root Beer Float meringue was dry. I think a bit overcooked, passable. Nothing to write home about. What was horrific was the drink, they need to take a sip of that before serving it. I never leave alcohol behind but that was just too severe. I think they attempted to sterilize my taste buds.  The Almond Joy was thankfully pretty good. I was scared by the end to see what new terror they would inflict on us. Thank God they ended on a decent note.  Overall, save your money and go somewhere else. If I am paying 160 a person with tip, I better be wowed and this definitely didn't do it.",0.9979,0.676,0.222,0.102,0.5772026992615229

2013-07-09,4.0,"Chef Homaro Cantu's family was homeless for much of his childhood, and the majority of his diet consisted of ""leftover junk food"" served at shelters. Cantu developed a taste for junk food and noticed that the rest of America seemed to share a passion for unhealthy foods high in things like sugar and fat.  When he opened iNG Restaurant in 2010, his aim was to try to recreate some of his favourite bad-for-you foods using only the healthiest ingredients. The 10-course meal I had was based entirely on favourite childhood foods, most of which were apparently dreamed up by Cantu's 7-year-old daughter and all of which were made solely from vegetables and other healthy ingredients.  Some dishes were not so successful (even the help of the Miracle Berry did not endear me to the broccoli ice cream or the Space Invader-shaped litchi-beet gelatin).  But others were plate-licking good, including the Alphabet Soup, The Three Little Pigs, the Duck Waffles, and - my favourite by far - the Hidden Valley ranch-charred broccoli-carrot.  And it was definitely the most fun I've had eating any meal in a very long time. The HIdden Valley Ranch-Charred Broccoli-Carrot is charred broccoli, carrot slivers, and cauliflower florets topped with pea shoots and flower petals and served on a bed of vegan ""Ranch"" dressing.  It looks like rabbit food, but it tastes surprisingly different than what you might expect from a dish made almost entirely from fresh produce.  The delicate texture of the veggies makes them seem as though they have been battered and deep-fried, and combined with the incredible sauce you have a healthy dish that tastes as good as a basket of hand-cut fries dipped in mayo.

The theme of the menu was the miracle berry, which is basically a powder that you can eat which will turn all sour and bitter foods into sweet and delicious flavors! We got the 3 course menu with the alcohol tasting with each course.  On the menu: Wings: The meal was started off really well with homemade noodles, served with a jalapeno and siracha mayo. It was then topped with shredded duck and parmesan. On the bottom of the plate, there was even some apricot puree. This was really good and I just wish I had more of it! This was paired with a Hop Zombie beer.  Korean Beef: The short rib was cooked to perfection so that it fell apart when you cut into it. It was cooked with soy sauce and they served homemade kimchi with it. This was served with Pic Saint Loup wine and I ate this really slowly just to savor every bite.  Lemon Tart: This is where the miracle berry played in! The dessert had a lemon tart with a graham cracker, and there was a pomegranate sauce on the bottom, and it was served with a coconut foam. Everything was really sour or bitter when we had it, even the drink. They paired this with a lemon drop that had a gel on the bottom that was supposed to taste like lime. You can see the powder in the spoons in the back of the third picture and when I had it and tasted the dessert again, all of my dessert was super sweet! It was such a cool experience and I am so happy to have gone here! The restaurant is really well decorated and they even have this graffiti mural right in the middle of the restaurant.

Boy, what a great decision - couldn't have had a better experience here.  We arrived promptly at 5 PM with a group of 6, and in spite of some time limitations (2 of the group needed to be out the door by 6:30) the staff made every accommodation to complete a 6 course tasting menu for us in the limited time.  They were also incredibly sweet about one of our party being a vegan, and made her a custom tailored set of dishes. The current theme of the menu is a childhood throwback,  doing grown-up takes on childhood classics (alphabet soup, rootbeer floats, almond joy, etc). Everything that was put on the table was incredible (though I did find the ""miracle berry"" aspect of the theme a little silly). I loved that the drink pairings were a mix of beer, wine, and cocktails - not just one or the other.

2013-04-26,4.0,"Went here with the boyfriend to celebrate our anniversary.  I mean, what better way to celebrate than indulge ourselves in great, highly recommended food?  We thought iNG would be perfect for this event. First off, I would like to clearly state that iNG changes their menu once every 6 weeks (as told to us by our waiter) and we dined there during The Wonder Years theme.  Childhood meals didn't seem too appealing but what the hey.. it's ""iNG"".  Should've went with my instincts.  We did the 10 course meal with 8 pairings for $105.  A friend of ours told us to do the 6 course because 10 was just too much.  Wished the boyfriend thought the 6 was enough cause we would've saved a pretty penny. Anyway, we were greeted wonderfully.  The host took our coats and sat us two at a 6 top (VIP service.. whattt).  We were then quickly poured a glass of champagne to kick off the celebration of our anniversary (which the whole staff knew).  Service was phenomenal.   The first course was Developing Our Senses where we were first introduced to this well-known ""miracle berry.""  This miracle berry reminded me of a tiny sweet tart.  That thing was awesome.  It played with our taste buds and made everything we ate afterward taste sweet.  We both seemed to enjoy the slice of lemon more than the actual soda that was paired with this berry - go figure.  But very cool nonetheless. The second course was a veggie dish - Hidden Valley ranch-charred broccoli-carrot.  This dish was by far THE best veggie dish I've ever tasted in my life!  There were dehydrated carrots and charred veggies topped over two, amazingly made purees.  So good I stopped to enjoy the taste of every single bite.  Heck, I even wanted to pick up the plate and lick the remnants of the puree - that's how good it was!  Good thing the plate was like 5 pounds, or else I would've totally done it. The rest of the courses were just ""meh"".. Maybe the veggie dish set the bar too high?  Not sure.  Overall the experience was wonderful at iNG.  Would I recommend it?  Sure, if you did the 6 course meal and dined when the menu actually seem appealing to you.   I would've given them four stars but I can't honestly say ""Yay, I'm a fan!""  Definitely an experience I would not pay again to do at iNG (or won't let my boyfriend pay that much for a dinner like this - poor guy).  Not here at least.",0.9989,0.722,0.256,0.022,0.5514536767087789

Next up was my favorite - the ""Korean Beef"" with cucumber kimchi and ginger. The ribs were so incredibly tender, it literally felt apart as soon as I poked it with my fork. The cucumber kimchi was an excellent, refreshing complement to the beef. Featuring ""Miracle Berries,"" the dessert was definitely the most fun part of the meal. For those who haven't experienced the miracle of these berries, what it is this berry in powder form that turns everything you eat sweet (it's heralded as a diet trick because people can lose weight by consuming less sugar without losing the sweetness).

We were seated promptly for our 9:00 pm Friday reservation but would have preferred being further back in the restaurant away from the door with its consistent draft.  Currently, the Chef is promoting a new cookbook focused on a ""miracle berry"" that is supposed to be a healthier substitute for sugars and sweeteners. That's fine but when I say promoting ... I mean shameless PIMPING. At one point we were given a drink from a recipe ""that can be found on p. 285 of the cookbook.""

It's sort of what I pictured the Korean eating establishments from Cloud Atlas to look like. Moving on... As far as the food, the savory dishes were all very good save for one slightly overcooked shortrib on an awkward plate. The deconstructed duck wing was probably my favorite of the evening. Hubby ranked the venison sausage as his favorite dish. The desserts, however, were far less successful. The deconstructed yogurt parfait was fine but the deconstructed buckeye with a balsamic cocoa miracle berry sauce is one of the worst desserts that I have ever had. It's not that we don't like buckeyes ... they were the favor that I handmade for our wedding. This was just bitter and not tasty, which was evident to our server ... who graciously brought out a grapefruit dessert for us so that we didn't leave on a ""bitter"" note. The grapefruit was more successful but needed to be eaten carefully because it really needed to have all of the components in each bite or else it tasted off and out of balance.

2013-02-20,3.0,"[ January, 2013 ] The miracle berry at iNG creates an interesting dining experience of would-be bitter and tart foods. I had a limited response to the berry, which made certain courses of the dinner slightly unpalatable throughout the course of the evening. Service was decent; what really rubbed me wrong about iNG was seeing the ""iNG Cookbook"" menu printed on cheap, 20lb white paper using a Color Jet printer. No forethought had gone into the design or printing of the menu, and since we were there on the night that didn't have a specific ""theme"" for the food, it really made errors in iNG's food and service more profound. Hopefully it was an oversight as the printer didn't deliver high-quality menus that I'd expect when paying for an upscale dinner. All in all, four people ate rather well, but we all agreed that there would probably be no return visits...unfortunately.",0.1945,0.839,0.086,0.075,0.4409013605442177
2013-02-18,5.0,"It's early in 2013, I've already decided this was the most incomparable meal of the year for me.  Haven't been to iNG Restaurant since it was Otom. And, after having read about the Miracle Berry and it's affect on one's ability to taste sweet and sour, I was more than curious. I opted for the 10 course tasting menu, with pairings.  1st course -- Capon Puff / Lemon Drop The lemon slice I was given tasted as expected -- lemon, sour, sharp.  After the freeze-dried Miracle Berry coated my tongue as instructed, I re-tasted the lemon and was immediately dumbstruck. I wouldn't say ""lemonade"", but, the sour was gone, & it had a sweet citrus flavor I find hard to describe & believe.  I also tasted the lemon drop before & after - before: sour, almost acrid / after:  perfect, refreshing, sweet - the sour note was now a slight back-note. The Capon Puff was nothing short of delicious - tender puff pastry, delicious filling, & the consomme was smooth and light. 2nd course - Crab Rangoon / Copain Chardonnay First I tried the orange sauce. ""Wow,"" is all I can say, especially with this miracle berry thing going -- absolutely no hint of sour, but a beautiful sweet, orange-y, citrus flavor rang true.  I was so enraptured by the sauce I almost forgot about the crab rangoon.  It was a perfect, crispy little bite - how do they get the crispy crust so feather like?!  Oddly enough, the wine (chardonnay) did not have that familiar ""cut"" at the end, no ""oaky"" flavor (it was fairly muted) - was this due the miracle berry? 3rd course -- Wings / Three Floyd's Alpha King I'm a fan of the 3 Floyd's Alpha King & expected the bitter note to be muted or gone, due to the miracle berry.  However, I think it wore off at this point & tasted as I know it.  The ""wings"" was not as one would think -- it was duck confit on house-made udon.  Three courses in & I've selected my favorite - it is this course.  The udon was tremendous; I could eat a large bowl of this & be satisfied.  Chewy but perfectly done.  Duck confit was stellar; a perfect accompaniment to the noodles. 4th course -- Pizza / La Chouffe Golden Ale Deconstructed pizza; probably the most fun, playful, cool & inventive of the courses (very Moto-like).  Pepperoni powder is, well, just crazy.  The venison sausage is delicious; I wanted more.  At this point, I'm wondering if the miracle berry has completely worn off? 5th course -- Venison Bratwurst / Stillwater Farmhouse Ale Here's where Moto's influence is obvious - the dish arrived in a large smoke filled globe.  The cold smoke was intended to flavor the bratwurst - it smelled fantastic, but, I hardly noticed it as a flavor.  I did, however, smell it later when I got home...in my suit.  Best part of this course is the house made sauerkraut.  Best. Sauerkraut. Ever. I was told the aioli was flavored with yuzu, but it was hard to tell.  Although the menu says there are peanuts, I'm pretty sure those were cashews.  This was my least favorite course. 6th -- Korean Beef / L'Ostal Cazes Minervois This was the most tender, most flavorful, short rib I've had.  Although the spicing isn't what I call Korean, necessarily, it was nonetheless delicious.  The house made kimchi wasn't spicy enough but was still tasty.  The sambal sauce was sick! I could've used a bottle of that to take home!  This was my 2d favorite course of the evening.  Also it wins best pairing - the mineraliness & boldness of the Minervois went together perfectly with every aspect of this course. Now desserts.  I'm given a 2nd ""dose"" of the freeze-dried miracle berry & lemon wedge.  Still works exactly as it did the 1st time! 7th course -- Lemon Tart I tried the tart BEFORE I took the MB & as described, since no sugar was added, it was very, very tart.  After the MB I couldn't stop eating it -- so delicious!  This course really made me a believer.  So much so that all I could say was, ""This doesn't make sense.  This miracle berry makes no sense."" 8th course -- Yogurt Parfait / 'Orange Creamsicle"" "" The orange creamsicle is the drink of the night!  What a fun drink!  It seems so sweet& no sugar nor simple syrup nor any other sweetener was added.  Again, ""it makes no sense.""  Since I did tell the server when asked before the meal I am lactose intolerant, the yogurt was substituted with some additional sorbet -- my favorite part about this course was the rosemary in the granola.  Brilliant! I can't tell you about the rest, as I'm at the end of my 5001 character limit.  Go try this, you won't regret it. The Miracle berry is, well, miraculous.

2013-02-05,5.0,"On Friday February 1st my wife and I were lucky enough to try two of the new dishes that will begin mid March on the Wonder Years menu.  Think back to when you were a kid and all of the same foods you would eat over and over again.  This menu does a great job bringing those back but with a few ADULT twists!   Before I begin I wanted to thank Emilie Bishop (our cocktail specialist) for an amazing first drink at the bar.  If you haven't tried one of her drinks you are missing out.  She made us each a kimura (grapefruit juice, lemon juice, st germain, campari, and campari spheres).  One of the best drinks I have had in a long time.  She also made us the cocktail for the new menu.  I will review that below. Dish #1: Shrimp Cocktail Margarita (my name for the dish) Remember as a child thinking you were so cool because you liked shrimp cocktail!  Well here is a grown up version of this with a little kick to it.  The shrimp is served cubed and mixed with tabasco sauce and other spices.  The rim of the small margarita shaped glass covered in horseradish salt.  At first I thought it was one large piece of shrimp but quickly found out it is actually 4 or 5 smaller pieces.  The first taste immediately brought back my childhood but then the kick of tabasco made me realize again that this is the adult version.  The next bite I added some of the salt on the rim and that gave it even more flavor.  I demolished the dish very quickly after this because everything was so fresh and the flavors together were perfect.  This dish is going to be a huge hit in my opinion. Drink #1: Bottle Mary (again my name) What better way to start your meal than with iNG's version of a bloody mary.  Excited?  Well you should be because you have to drink it out of a baby bottle!  Don't cheat and take the nipple off!  This drink was made with celery root instead of tomato juice and was very spicy.  I had never had a bloody mary before but really loved what Trevor (the mastermind of this drink) did to make this enjoyable.   Dish #2 Deconstructed Candy Bar (again not the actual dish name) I was very excited to try one of the deserts off the menu and what better desert than a candy bar (while flavor tripping)  This dish was presented with all ingredients separated on the plate.  They included: coconut macaroons, miracle berry chocolate sauce, and most importantly broccoli ice cream.  As a kid I would have had nothing to do with this but now that the miracle berry is in play I bet I could get my younger brother to try this without hesitation.  While flavor tripping the ice cream tasted just like pistachio ice cream.  I couldn't taste the broccoli at all!  The macaroons gave great texture to the desert and the chocolate sauce tasted like the most expensive chocolate I had ever eaten.  FYI the chocolate sauce is made with zero sugars!  There were nuts as well I believe.  Honestly can't remember because once again I ate the dish so quickly because I enjoyed it so much. Overall I gave both dishes A's and can't wait to come back to try the full 10 course menu.  I would also like to add that I am in no way affiliated with the restaurant or chef Cantu.  I am just a customer for life who appreciates a good meal and great service.

They had the miracle berry menu when we arrived and decided to do the wine pairing. The miracle berry was a completely unique experience and was quite interesting. The food was good. I guess after eating at Moto a couple of nights earlier, going here was not comparable. I think if I had come to iNG first, I probably would have liked it better. My friend does not eat pork so they changed the menu for him slightly but it was still good. I do have to say that some of the dishes were fantastic while others were just not very good at all. The desserts were a disappointment. The wine pairing was pretty good but nothing really mind blowing. The amount of alcohol that was given to us was a lot smaller than we expected so we ended up getting drinks on the side as well. Service was very good.

2013-01-20,1.0,"We (two foodies who recently moved to Chicago from NY) were very excited to try ING, after we'd heard excellent reviews. However, we were dearly disappointed.  First, the food- the miracle berry is exciting and very cool; it is definitely a very different experience from anything else you might choose to do with your dinner. In fact, our favorite part of dinner was tasting lemons before/after the berry. Outside of that, the food was ""tasty"", but not much more. Out of our 6 courses, I'd say we enjoyed 2 of them, and ate the rest of them because we were hungry and they were there. They were not remarkable, and they cost us $220... (!). We literally headed straight to the bar across the street once we were done, and ate delicious empanadas for $3 a piece. That should tell you something, after a $220 meal! Drink pairings were tasty, but the staff was not generous pouring them out (one time they brought out a small bottle of belgian beer, poured us each a few sips, and took the remainder back. What- you can't just give us the rest of the bottle??). The ambiance was terrible, and on a Friday night!. The decor is cute but nothing more, and the space had bright lights on with dubstep in the background... Far from what we were hoping for. On top of that, it was nearly empty (four couples total) and you could hear what everyone was saying.  The service was very attentive, which may be the one good thing we can say. But-  perhaps they were compensating for the food- they were TOO attentive (""we're trying to have a conversation!""). Even after the meal, when we were sitting and talking, they came over and suggested they take our coat-check tag and bring us our coats.

2013-01-04,5.0,"I've been a great admirer of Homaro Cantu's work for years and have been dying to go to either Moto or iNG. The recent package deal in celebration of Cantu's new book that included a signed pre-release copy, a cooking class and a full 6 course meal provided enough motivation for me to grab a friend and head on down to the city to experience it firsthand. Walking in, I had the same feeling as Charlie Bucket had stepping into Willy Wonka's chocolate factory. We started with the cooking class where a highly energetic and knowledgeable Cantu dazzled with demos that included the Miracle berry, enlightening us on its properties and potentials. The berry, if you have never heard of it before, contains a complex protein called miraculin which essentially makes you taste sour foods as sweet (makes a lemon taste like lemonade) and is the focus of both the book and the new menu.  For the meal, we opted for the 6-course with pairings rather than the full 10. One thing I should mention before I begin my full overview of the dining experience is that we are under age, and got non-alcoholic pairings with our meal. The mixologist, Emilie, invented 6 custom virgin cocktails to perfectly accompany each course. Not only did she successfully create pairings off the top of her head which completed the dishes, but they were also really good.  Course 1: Capon, feta, nectarine and cherry filled puff pastry resting in consume. Eaten with MB. - although it was small, it was packed with flavor. I had a bite before and after eating the MB and it the change was incredible. Whale at first the fruit was distracting, the MB took away the tartness and amplified the umami, so overall a great start. Pairing: Virgin lemon drop. Indescribably amazing with miracle berry- had multiple dimensions of flavor that I was not expecting from such a simple drink. The MB tricked my taste buds into sensing it as sweet rather than sour, yet still left me with a bite on the finish, so it was great both as an accompaniment to the dish and as a palate cleanser after. Course 2: Venison bratwurst over sauerkraut with aioli and peanuts. Still under the impression of MB when I ate it. This was probably my favorite dish of the entire night, since I am a big game meat fan. It was brought out with a big glass orb over the plate which was filled with smoke. After the waiter set it down, and lifted the orb, the smoke streamed out over the plate and surrounded the table filling the air with a woodsy bbq smell. The MB made the sauerkraut taste both sweet and umami so when all the elements were eaten in unison, it was a symphony of flavors. This dish was probably one of the high notes of the night and left me quite satisfied. Pairing: ginger drink of some sort which was really interesting with the MB and actually paired quite nicely with the venison. Course 3: Pizza- flat bread pizza with aioli sauce, pepperoni, kalamata olives, mushrooms Fontana cheese and micro greens. This was probably the low point of the night and really let me down. Not only was there nothing special about 4 squares of pepperoni pizza with veggies (you can get it for about $85 less at dominoes) but it was overwhelming and almost unpalatably salty. I seriously considered sending it back, and it really put a damper on the rest of the night. Pairing: Once again Emilie amazed us with her powers with an impromptu virgin cocktail based on a sweet red currant reduction. This really offset the saltiness of the pizza, and was quite refreshing. Course 4: Short rib with cucumber kim chi and sambal. This dish was refreshing after the pizza we were served the course before. The short rib was softer than butter and the kim chi was so good with the cucumber.  Pairing: I forgot exactly what was in it (it involved orange and chi), but it was quite tasty. Course 5: yogurt parfait with cactus pear sorbet and granola.  Pairing: Orange Creamsicle drink which was like a dessert in itself. Course 6: finished with the 'Buckeye' course which heavily used miracle berry with a sugar free peanut butter ice cream, sugar free sourdough doughnut and a balsamic/oj chocolate sauce. This was amazing. Before the MB it tasted disgusting but afterwards it tasted like a billion calorie guilty pleasure ice cream treat which proved MB's promise in fighting obesity and diabetes. The service was impeccable. Our servers were attentive and knowledgeable (however I noticed they gave shorter explanations to us than to adult guests because of our age) and were highly enthusiastic about their work. I also thought it was cool that one of the head chefs, Trevor, was a server too. Finally I have to commend Emilie on an impeccable job coming up with 6 brand new virgin cocktails that went perfectly with our food, completely on the fly. In addition she was really friendly, and really put a smile on our faces :). Overall this was a meal that I will remember for a long time, and I would even go as far as calling it inspirational.

The rest of the courses are pretty good. Perhaps my expectation was low, but the courses' progression is pretty well thought out. I know one of the complain of this restaurant is the progression of the dinner, that the dishes come out too slow.

2012-12-14,1.0,"Hey, do you enjoy mediocre, gimmicky food and slow service? Do you have $300?  Then I've got a recommendation for you!!   We had the 10-course meal at iNG tonight, which took nearly four hours. Three of the ten courses were tasty, and the other seven ranged from decent to nearly inedible. Again, you're paying $300 for two (with drinks and tip), so you generally expect more than 30% of your meal to be a hit. The last course was the coup de grace: tiny pastries flavored like Pine-Sol. Service polite but maddeningly slow.  If you're drawn by the novel idea of ""flavor-tripping,"" know that this mildly entertaining gimmick involves one course out of ten and makes a lemon taste sort of sweet for a little bit. But it generally doesn't make the food taste better.  iNG basically strikes me as a place for foodies who don't really care how their food tastes as long as it's presented in haute cuisine fashion. I thought it would be fun, but I was wrong. I filled out a comment card left with the check, and to his credit, the manager called, apologized for the poor service and offered to comp our next meal.

2012-12-11,5.0,"Ahh!!! Sister restaurant to Moto except with flavor tripping awesomeness!! First of all, I was very happy to find out that there was A Nightmare Before Christmas menu. I LOVE the film and love love love the fact that iNG does themed menus! i mean, come on that's pretty amazing right?? I was so happy to get the 10 course menu here. I often found myself disappointed whenever I looked down at my plate and the food was gone.  Super friendly and personable wait staff. I got there a little earlier and had a drink at the bar. The bartender and the manager as well as some of the wait staff came over to greet and also to check in to see if I needed anything. It made me feel wonderful. They were so attentive to my needs. Going in to dinner now: the first course called so endearing named Jack's Lament came out in a smoking glass bowl. The server set it down in front of us and oh my goodness the aroma! It made my mouth water. The food itself was even more amazing. The baozi bun with oyster mushrooms with soft and fluffy. I have never had octopus so tender before. They did an amazing job with the octopus, the flavor was astounding. And the broth!! I really wanted to lift up the bowl and drink everything, but alas I had to stick with the spoon.  The next course had yams and maple oats with different types of herb purees. Each bite was full of savory and sweet flavors. I'm pretty positive I finished the course in about 3 bites. And like I said before, was very disappointed I had finished it so fast haha. The pumpkin course, the cocktail that went along with it was sooo good I was sad it came in such a small portion. Don't get me wrong all of the pairings were spot on. But this was subtle and so tasty. The pork belly was tender, the purees and the hash amazing! The silver claw hand was a nice touch, my date wanted to take it home ahah. Finkelstein soup was such a surprise. It was at first a slight disappointment when I saw how little the beaker was but there was so much flavor and that carrot chip??!  Frog course: I had never had frog legs before and although I was hesitant i was keeping an open mind. And let me say, it was another very nice surprise. It was lightly fried and very tender. Although this was considered my 'least' favorite course, I liked everything so much that the level of my like of this course was still very very high (if that makes sense). Holiday trees was super adorable. Each bite represented a different holiday. Easter, St. Patrick's Day, Halloween, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. They were small bites but same as said before sooo much flavor. The deviled egg might  have put me over the edge on the full scale but I couldn't stop eating!!! Desserts!!! First dessert had miracle berry. There were really cute little gin and tonic snowmen with a shadow made of lemon powder. The miracle berry definitely made it much sweeter since so many elements if not all were rather tart. Such a fun dish!  The roasting chestnuts course!! Ohhhh my goodness! The bread pudding was a real nice balance with with cooler creams and sauces as well as the ice cream. Very creamy, made me feel so warm and cozy inside. There was a cool center piece that was brought out and set on the table. When the food came out the server had a torch in his hand and he torched a couple of the spices in the bowl to give a really nice sense of sitting by a fire. Next course we had Jack's Return with mix your own egg nog. The egg nog was super smooth and nice did not taste overly boozy. I was concerned when I heard Maker's Mark that it would overshadow any other flavor and was very happy it did not. The course came out with a large chocolate coffin kid with a side of Bangladesh bay ice cream. There was mintiness as well as a nice ginger note with dried mulberries. This was by far my personal favorite dessert. My date and I had a long debate on which was the best dessert and its a huge toss up between the chestnuts and the coffin one. I could have definitely licked the plate after this, I demolished this course if I do say so myself :) Alas, the very last course. It came out with a box wrapped up like a present. Very cute presentation! There were small bites on the dish beneath it. Some were gels, there was one that looked like a kiss and another piece that was a cake. To be honest with you, this was my least favorite, only because I felt like this should not have been the course to end with. I enjoyed a couple of the gels but my least favorite gel was the chocolate one. The kiss was a birch meringue that tasted very much like root beer and the server had made a comment that it would act like an after dinner mint. Which worked. Again though, still my least favorite. It was anticlimactic and I felt like this was definitely subpar compared to the other courses. However!!! Everything was so fantastic that to be honest, it didn't even make a dent in my experience.

2012-12-07,5.0,"I have a habit of adding ""ing"" to nouns and adjectives to make them verbs. Strange, but I'm a creative type which attracted me to the ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" menu at ""iNG""- it's fate. The setting is a bit banal and sterile. However, it's pragmatic because it provides a blank canvas and doesn't detract from the food.   Anytime there's a tasting menu I get apprehensive yet I needn't fear. Chef Homaru Cantu is a visionary. Each serving and drink pairing perfectly encapsulated the ""Nightmare Before Christmas"" themes of naughty and nice, black humor, and gifts with surprises. It was all so elaborate and impressive. However, please don't think he sacrificed substance for style because the food was ""Nom Nom Noam..Chomp-sky Chomp-sky Chomsky."" It all looked so beautiful and sinister and really incorporated seasonal flavors. Favorites were Jack's Lament with its funny Jack Skeleton head and eastern taste, the gin and tonic snowman running from its own shadow (stupid me. With the outline it looked like a police drawing), and Chestnuts on an Open Fire which was so whimsical and cozy. I love they integrated sinister fire (the cinnamon bark and chestnut on a literal fire) and soothing ice (chestnut ice cream). AwesomiNG.",0.993,0.651,0.259,0.09,0.7396825396825397

They were so nice that I feel a little bad leaving a negative review.   I agree with the other negative reviews on here and thus won't belabor the details of why I did not enjoy my dinner at iNG.  The main issue is that they seem to have thought through every minor detail except for the taste of the food.  We had the 10 course tasting menu and ended up skipping 3 of the last few courses because the wait between each course was painfully long, and each course seemed to taste worse than the last. Really, that's what it comes down to -- the food just doesn't taste that good.  For example, Catherine's pasta was ok, but they spoon oil on to it straight from the candle burning on the table.  The result is that it ends up tasting a bit burnt -- like the smell that results when blowing out a candle.  They seem so preoccupied with the ""shock"" factor of spooning what looks like candle wax onto your dish that they overlook the fact that doing so actually makes the dish taste worse.  Also, the last course involved a chocolate ""cake"" in a ""petri dish"" that had the blandness and dry consistency of crushed up chocolate grahm crackers.   My husband and I decided at the end that our experience at iNG was really more like taking part in a social experiment than going out to dinner, in that we felt like the whole experience was some sort of secretly televised prank.  Sorry, iNG.

Every person in the restaurant was consistent from the women who greets you at the door to each of the 5 people who waited on us. I was impressed that each of them were completed coordinated in knowing who was serving what to us. Lastly, they asked if we were taking a cab and after we said we were, the hostess was waiting outside in the windy cold weather across the street with the cab door open waiting for us to get in. The food was especially creative in keeping with the Scorsese theme and Howard Hugh's OCD theme. Each dish was very detailed in its presentation down to a couple pleasant surprises which I'm not exactly sure how to describe. I loved the food tripping thing....it's a powder type of substance that you let sit on your tongue for 20 seconds and it then turns tart foods into sweet. The wine and beer pearling was excellent. The only downside is that they could do a bit more to swank the place up. The chairs are kind of cheap looking. The 10 course meal ended up being $220 before tip. Not bad for a place like this.

I've never been to Moto, but I hear it's hella expensive, but this was only $100 with the Living Social deal (6 course version is $80 normally). It's been a while since I've had a meal like this, and probably the first that I'm reviewing something like this. I'll probably need all the letters I can get so, without further ado: SLEEPS WITH THE FISHES To start things off, you get a clear bowl with a black forest inside with a clear plastic wrap over it with 2 shrimp chips lying on top. They're the size of a Taco Bell Cinnamon Twist and it has the same consistency. It's drizzled with garlic aioli powder, but honestly, it tastes like a regular shrimp chip you can get at your Asian market. The power adds a very tiny garlic taste, but easily missed. Part 2, they take the plastic wrap off, and suddenly the bowl starts smoking! It's a seaweed forest underneath, and in the middle are 2 small dumplings each skewered on a chopstick. They're a bit bigger than a sharpie marker cap. It was pleasant, and had a real smoky flavor, but it didn't taste infused, more like forced. Definitely not liquid smoke, but tastes a lot like it. The sauce in the middle is pretty interesting, because it's got the thai chili flavor but none of the spice, amongst other things. DINNER IN PRISON Bunch of things on this plate. There's a piece of pork belly wrapped in, um, ham? And there's a cured ham piece too. You can tell I'm a very sophisticated guy, right? They're both very salty, and I wish I didn't drink all my Riesling in the last course, because it would've gone very nicely. It's not unlike any other cured meats I've had, so can't say it was anything spectacular. The scene this depicts, apparently, is somebody slicing garlic with a razor blade. This course comes with very thinly sliced elephant garlic chips, which pack a delicious garlic taste - make sure you have wine, or else this ruins other flavors for a few minutes. 9MM Essentially, it's a crepe with a piece of gun-shaped cheese on top. The inside has a plethora of ingredients minced and cooked together (i.e. onion, basil, eggplant, and more). It made for a decent combination, but I really couldn't tell you what was in it; they all sort of blended together. Seasoning was good. COLOR OF MONEY This was weird. You get what looks like a mozzarella ball and a parmesan shortbread, and they're in a small pool of basil tea. I spooned the basil and was like Whoa! That's basily, but as the course went on, it started to mix well. The cheese ball is actually a mushroom mix but it's densely covered by the mozz. The mushroom ""stuffing"" was good, but seasoning was a little light. When you add the mozz, it practically engulfs the seasoning and it becomes very bland. CATHERINE'S PASTA There's a candle on your table that they put out and drip on your pasta! Apparently, it's some kind of oil. The pasta was seasoned quite well, and was very buttery. The mushrooms were fantastic too! BUT, don't know if it was that candle oil, but something gave it a very light chemically aftertaste. It's not glaring, but barely noticeable. CANOLI VEAL Homerun! Shredded veal inside of a canoli-looking crust, but it's way more crispy and chewy than a canoli - practically eggroll-y. The veal is great, but the mascarpone cheese adds this incredible buttery taste to it that makes it incredibly delicious! Every bite had the buttery flavors, meaty textures (like a tender pulled pork), and a beautiful crisp too! Perfect! INTERMISSION You get this sorbet that feels like foam. It tastes disgusting! Some bites were like fruity ocean foam! You put the Miracle Berry powder in your mouth for 45 seconds and things really do change! The sorbet goes from disgusting to acceptable, but there are some pockets where I still got the salty flavor. It's a fun and cool experiment, but taste-wise, this began the decline. DIET SANDWICH Lemon poundcake acted as the bread and there was a deep fried sage leaf and a flat piece of, I think, earl gray ice cream! It was really bizarre, but tasted pretty good. There's no gnawing on that sage leaf, it was crispy, and bit clean off. The clean taste of the sage complimented the ice cream and made it taste even colder! This was fun too. TAXI DRIVER Served on a whiskey barrel plank, there're different geletin cubes in different powders. Nothing special. AVIATOR The devil's food cake with earl gray icing and kaffir lime drops was an interesting combo. That earl gray gave it a bitterness that was actually quite welcome. It complimented the chocolate cake very well. The cotton candy tastes like regular ol' cotton candy. COM-ING AGAIN? HappyIExperiencedIt,ButNotComingBack",0.9992,0.765,0.186,0.049,0.5351617163030209

2012-10-21,5.0,"I ate at ING this week, and not knowing what to expect, I was pleasantly surprised. Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed a cool decor that took me back in time to the era of John Dillinger.  On the front wall, clips from The Aviator and Good Fellas, and the service staff dawned their best gangster garb.  Once I was sat, I was greeted by my server, Scott, an he informed me how the ten course tasting menu was going to be laid out for me that evening. I particularly enjoyed his explanation of when the miracle berry was going to enter and how it would change the rest of my courses. This was the part I was most thrilled about, because I have never had a course change flavors right in front of me.  The first course was sleeping with the fishes and it came in a beautiful glass bowl with seaweed and smoke hovering on top, all I needed was a pair of concrete shoes I was set. The course was a rock shrimp fun-ion like chip with a rock shrimp mousseline filled with lightly pickled cucumber and a white truffle aioli. Separately each component was good, but together, they were amazing. It was a very exciting start to my meal.  Next was cured meats, my favorite! Dinner in prison is a course based off the movie Good Fellas. Starting off was a piece of house made sausage focaccia with a light, buttery texture (and this is saying a lot, growing up in an Italian/ Irish household). Along side I received house made lindenspeck, spicy coppa, jowel bacon and 5 year aged ham with a pomegranate marshmallow, whipped parama butter, roasted tomato sauce and garlic chips thinly sliced with a razor (just like the movie!). This was my favorite course of the evening. A perfect Italian antipasti course.  Shortly followed was none other than a taleggio gun in the 9mm. Underneath was a savory crepe stuffed with an eggplant caponata with olive oil and two sauces. I was so excited about a cheesey gun that I may have forgotten what they were. Together the course was the perfect blend of sweet, salty an spicy with a crunchy crepe exterior.  The color of money, or what like to call the inverted arancini. The fried mushroom risotto was enrobed in a layer of hand pulled mozzarella on top a basil tea with savory shortbread. I have to admit, I was a little skeptical about this course, because I thought the arancini would become soggy under the cheese, but it wasn't! It was still extremely crisp and reminded me of my summer in the south of Italy and a wonderful seafood dinner I had on the docks of Sorrento.  And finally, a pasta course!  Catherine's pasta was a wonderfully al dente fettuccini with chanterelle, caramelized fennel with a mushroom sauce. Plus, wait for it... A basil candle topped it off. Granted, yes, I knew the candle was edible from previous reviews, but still, pretty freakin awesome. I think I may have scares Scott with my enthusiasm. This course was a great transition into every Italians favorite delicacy, cannoli. This particular one was filled with milk braised veal breast, Marsala Demi, yellow pepper sauce an whipped mascarpone. I've never had a savory cannoli before, but after mixing the veal with the yellow pepper and Demi, I am a converted woman! Now, the moment I had been waiting for, flavor tripping! The first dessert acted as a palate cleanser and appropriately named intermission was a lemon pizzelle ( made using a real pizzelle press!) lemon sorbet and grapefruit foam. Scott told me to try half of the course, eat the miracle powder and then finish it. The difference was night and day. Fresh and acidic before and light and sweet after. I was ready to go or my next dessert Diet sandwich was like thanksgiving desserts in one bite; pound cake, cranberry, safe ice cream and pumpkin mouse with more pound cake, what's not to love? And based off Howard Hugh's was The Aviator with cotton candy Kleenex, a dish filled devils food cake and a mint ice cream topped with kaffir like ""bacteria"". All the flavors together made the perfect balance of what reminded me of earl grey tea.  All and all a very wonderful meal, but what I enjoyed the most was the service staff. I got the privilege of interacting with all of them at one point and they were all extremely nice and clearly love what they do",0.9993,0.752,0.21,0.039,0.5688988095238096

I was taking a little bit of risk seeing as how it is a bit pricy for our budgets & that it was my first time there as well. The risk paid off. Service was excellent, we opted for the ""director's cut"" (i think it was called), extended menu for $99 each and we all thought it was well worth it, also we were very happy that we got the extended menu because some of our favorite dishes were on that version. favorites: the 9mm was awesome with the telaggio cheese gun & some nice spice in the caponata.  I liked The color of money a lot. Catharine Scorsese's Pasta dish might have been the favorite of the night, if only there was more of it... but then again 10 courses is a lot of food. Diet Sandwich, Taxi Driver, and the aviator were notable as well. Service as i mentioned was excellent, even though a couple of us switched to the non-alcoholic drink pairings midway through our meal, which i assume is kind of a pain, our server was completely accommodating and insisted that it was no problem.   I would say that i consider myself something of a foodie & I was very impressed with this restaurant and especially their attention to details.  I never would have guessed that it was their first night with that new menu if they hadn't told me.  The knowledge of the menu and execution was very well done.

The Martin Scorsese dinner was $100 including 10 courses and six pairings.  For the complexity and novelty of the dishes and the overall experience, this is a tremendous value.  It's casual upscale and is very approachable. iNG is playful, and innovative modernist cuisine.  Occasional dishes fall flat but some dishes really shine.  The friends I brought to the dinner were smiling from ear-to-ear with some of the courses and really enjoyed themselves. I'll be back.... and I'll bring more friends.  It's a fun dining evening when you hang out at iNG. I'd really give them more of a 4.5 because there was a bit of a long wait between some of the earliest courses but I'm rounding up rather than down just because my guests all had such a great time here. Also free WiFi and they will respond in realtime to tweets.",0.9944,0.818,0.17,0.011,0.44970486111111113
2012-10-01,4.0,"Please note, this review is NOT of the food, just drinks... My good friend from NYC came to town this past weekend and wanted to get together with some folks here in Chicago. She and her friend got tickets to NEXT at the last minute, and it was decided we would meet somewhere close by for drinks before they left. We nixed The Aviary, just because we didn't think we'd get in and so it was decided to try out iNG. Honestly I didn't know if iNG even had a bar for us to sit at, so I was a bit skeptical. I was *this close* to not wanting to go, but I love my friend and didn't want to miss the chance to see her. I'm glad I went. The bar space for iNG is tiny. I know it's not meant for folks to actually go there just for drinks like we did, but rather probably for people to hang out while they wait for their table. Granted the place was about half full, so there would be no need to wait (maybe the poor reviews are making an impact?) My friend had the Gin and Tonic in Ice and loved it (not a fan of gin and tonic myself.) Two of her friends got The Kimura - one felt it was too sweet, but the other liked it. The last of us got a bourbon and ginger (he's from South Carolina, so it seemed like a go-to), but he thought the bourbon was a little too sweet as well. I had the Lambic Sour Ale. In fact I had two, because they were so delicious. Will I go back there? Not likely, but it was good to say I've been there even if it was only for drinks. The bonus? Met a couple really awesome people, so I can thank iNG for expanding my social circle :)",0.9981,0.719,0.254,0.027,0.5147222222222222
2012-09-27,5.0,"It's unfortunate there are so many negative reviews of iNG. We had such a memorable, wonderful meal here last fall. The dining room was sadly mostly empty on a Tuesday night, but that translated into extremely attentive service. I rarely leave a speck of a tasting menu uneaten, but the portions were extremely large and not only did they bring out a second order of braised beef because mine was mostly fat, but I literally could not eat about half of it because I felt so full. We noted how comparable the taste was to Alinea, at a fraction of the price (although a fraction of Alinea is still a lot). It could be that the lack of interest in the restaurant left them no choice but to go the LivingSocial route and couldn't maintain the quality. Hopefully these deals drum up more interest and allows iNG to refocus on what it's capable of accomplishing.",0.7895,0.805,0.113,0.083,0.542731829573935
2012-09-19,2.0,"Man, it's been a while since I've written a review however the more I think about this, the more disappointed I am about my iNG experience.  Through no fault of the restaurant (that I'm aware of): It all started when I hopped at a LivingSocial deal and it went down hill from there. The deal was originally advertised as a 2 for 1 deal, which is why I bought it. I'm a little tired of this genre of the food scene and the cost associated with it but this pulled me out of my shell. Until I realized later in the day that the deal had changed at some point and was simply a $99 for one, major disappointment. I bought a second one because I'm not eating alone, after LivingSocial was zero help. Sigh. On top of that, when I got to the restaurant come to find out that the menu was $99 anyway. So where was the deal here? I mean, if I wanted to go to your restaurant and was really excited about it I would have gone already without the deal, but fine. Let's get this over with.   Little did my guest and I know that we were going to experience first night of the new menu surrounding a movie theme. The meal itself started strong and course after course went down hill from there, each course progressively weaker than the one before. The highlight I would argue was the pasta dish with the button mushrooms, however as someone who makes their own pasta... put some more pasta in the dish. It left me wanting much more.  Plating:  The basil tea dish: a bowl with lower sides would be great. Especially since you have to get in there with a knife to chop of the food. Way to high, I felt like I was doing surgery on my food with my hands up high.  Whatever was served on the long piece of wood: Make sure your waitress clears off a spot on the table before they show up having us scramble to move all the glasses and silverware for them.  Petri dish desert: See below. The last drink and desert was my low point. First of all, the drink was horrible, if I wanted to drink something that tasted like nyquil, I would do that. But I don't like drinking nyquil, ever, which is why I use the liqui caps. 2 sips and I ate the mint in the drink to attempt to get rid of that flavor. Second, mechanics. If you are going to serve a sponge cake topped with ice cream in a petri dish, with the ice cream on top... you know that the lid is going to stick. Giving it to the customer who is going to become frustrated as the waiter stands over you waiting to pour some green stuff on top of the ice cream results in the customer giving up and eating it upside down. As I watch this green stuff get spread out on my dark brown sponge cake I said to myself this would be so much better looking if it was on top of the ice cream. By the time I put my spoon into it I realized this serving dish with this food was a very poor choice. I seriously struggled to keep the ice cream in the lid of the petri dish, the whole thing is full of course trying to spoon out something on a low lipped dish is going to spill over. After another sip of the drink and I was done.  Service: 1) Nothing bothers me more than a waitress who walks up to a table interrupting a conversation of two people who appear to be engaged in what they are talking about to apologize about being scatter brained, unorganized or any thing along those lines. This happened more than once, enough for me to comment about it to my guest which for me is a good indication that the waitress needs to pull her self together. 2) Watching food come out of the kitchen, seeing the dish, realizing that they are looking at my table and them looking uncertain if the dish should go there. Or having the food come up too the table only to get pulled back by the unsure waiter/waitress. Then seeing the food make it's way back to a computer where they check where the food should go, and having it come back to the table. Seriously, I'm paying for you to deliver a seamless meal. Check where your food is going before you leave the kitchen.  3) Service seemed quite slow. Either put more food on the plates or be quicker about picking up empty plates and getting on to the next meal. It was a pretty long meal considering the amount of food that was served vs the time we sat there. 4) While I do agree that at this price point I shouldn't be pouring my own water but come up with a better solution to the chaos of the wait staff vs the water people. More than once I thought a bottle of water could just be left on the table for someone passing to pick up and pour if they saw the glass was empty.  Overall: The food was ok, the service was a train wreck although tolerable. Combine that with my LivingSocial experience. Having been to variety of the Michelin starred venue's in town now, I can say it is highly unlikely that I will be back. 3 stars for the food, 1 star for the service which averages out to 2, +0.5 for the gun coffee mug.",0.8422,0.839,0.084,0.077,0.45282557720057726

2012-08-24,1.0,"I haven't written a review for a long time but felt compelled to after my dinner at iNG. Quite frankly, I am surprised by the amount of good reviews. I think that people are blinded by the silly tricks and unnecessary hype.  More surprisingly, diners around me were oohing and aahing at puffed rice and nacho cheese. Seriously?! Just because they throw some flavor changing miracle fruit and liquid nitrogen does not mean the food is 'out of this world' as one person put it.  We had a total of 10 courses. I won't bore you with the details because they really aren't worth mentioning. Nothing completely stood out and the silly tricks were not innovative and did nothing to enhance my food experience. I just have to mention that my friend (who is usually easy to please) pointed out that her mother could make a better pork belly, blindfolded.  I think the best thing from all 10 plates was a little piece of potato I got. Yum. Everything was so mediocre and just OK... Sort of like ""I reheated the leftover mexican food in the microwave and it was OK"" or ""I may have left it out in the sun for too long but it tasted OK"". I compliment the wait staff on their energy and enthusiasm though. And finally, I will end with the story of a conversation I overheard from the table next to us.  Man: I really liked this dish. It is a stuffed pepper, isn't it? I really loved the heat from the pepper. It was spicy but just enough that it didn't overpower the flavors. What kind of pepper is it? Waiter: O... Well... It is a sweet bell pepper....  I had the dish. There was no spice at all. IT WAS A SWEET BELL PEPPER. DAMNIT. Stupid man!!",0.9929,0.723,0.201,0.076,0.6024305555555556

I am not going to give a course by course run down, but overall the dishes exhibited more creativity than great flavor.  Nothing taste bad, a couple were really good, the rest were average.   After being described a dish with 19 adjectives, I was expecting more flavor and more complex flavors.  Another thing that really sucked is 3 of the drink pairings were beers or ale.  I don't drink beer or ale and can't stand the taste.

The menu progressively gets better with each course, the highlights for me being the final two...the butter and french toast (tastes like a dreamsicle!!) and the asian cracker jack.  Each course plays off the Miracle Berry experience. Some prior reviews describes Miracle Berry as a ""gimmick"", but I wouldn't. It's really a fabulous tool that allows one to change the food tasting experience. In this case, it changes the sweet/sour tasting experience in a very positive way. To me, the highlights came out in the drinks, and especially so with the Flemish sour ale!  This tasting menu experience is probably one of the better values you'll find. You really get a sizable amount of food and plenty to drink throughout.  Overall, my wife and I just had a fabulous time. As described above, the food/drinks were fantastic and the value was great.

2012-07-06,4.0,"iNG remains a not-so hidden gem among the chicago food scene with a great innovative menu that affords great value. From the team that gave us Moto, comes iNG, which for the summer menu is a 6course tasting with included drink pairings. All for $75 (yes, they can do an all vegetarian or gluten free menu too). The food combines molecular techniques but doesn't overwhelm or insult you with excessive foams. The focus remains on the food and flavor experience. I went there in late June with a friend (who requires gluten free) and was pleasantly surprised.  Here are some highlights, the first course was a delicious cobia ceviche which had great pop. The catfish corndog - fish-n-chips was lightly fried and the meat tender, yet not fishy. The short rib was tender, flavorful, and packed the right amount of heat with the jalapeno powder. Desserts were off the chart, especially the orange-lemon french toast. The carbonated orange was amazing. The lemon ""butter"" bar and toast was a perfect marriage. The only complaints were that sometimes there was an excess ""powder"" component and the 2nd dish would have been better without the fake sushi (bacon wrapped watermelon).   The staff is knowledgeable and Trevor wants to make sure all diners are satisfied. He helped us out when by mistake one dish was served with a gluten component (malt vinegar). He quickly rectified it and appologized. He went out of his way to make it up to us.

Every course was truly unique and memorable, but the highlights were the watermelon ""sushi"" wrapped in coconut rice and bacon, the short rib with ""corn bread"" three ways (a powder, a sauce and some hard pieces that had been frozen with liquid nitrogen), and a French toast dessert, which came with a big lemon mousse cake made to look like a stick of butter and an orange that had somehow been carbonated, baffling even my Physics-teaching husband. The service was also impeccable, with clear explanations for every course and how they were meant to be eaten. When one drink order took too long to come out, the waiter comped it even though we didn't complain.

2012-05-10,2.0,"Walking into iNG yesterday I was excited. After seeing Chris Jones on Top Chef with his inventive ideas I was expecting bright colors, smoke and lights...the big guns to come out. Sadly disappointed. If you're doing a pairing menu...let me forewarn you. Unless you'd like to be crap-canned by the end of your meal, don't bother ordering a cocktail to start. You won't need it, I promise. Each course is paired with a booze...from white to pink to red wines, a mixologist experience and at least 2 beers. You'll be praying for a loaf of bread by course 4 if you decide to order a cocktail in addition. I know I was. Walking in, we were seated and served an amuse bouche. A bit of thai-chili spiced popcorn. Eh...Graham Elliott has these guys hands down on popcorn. It was unimpressive. The menu was cool. Origami-folded cubes...autographed from the chefs.  Ceviche. It was pretty, but literally two small mouthfuls, more of another amuse bouche than course. I appreciated the fact that I could taste each ingredient individually. But I'm hungry. Served with a roset wine. I finish my dish before I finish my wine, so I find myself gulping the last sip of wine to move forward. Strawberry Rhubarb. A piece of delicious poached salmon with two mixed green salads and rhubarb chips. With this came our first dose of M Berry on a rice chip. We were told to try the dish first, then eat the chip with the M Berry and finish the dish. This course was also served with a cocktail you mix to your liking. It combined a bitter beer with a sweeter cocktail. The flavor-tripping has begun...but I have to say, I didn't get the effect of this round of M Berry...but there was more to come. the thaw. BORING. Literally three cube-sized pieces of pork belly (more belly and less pork by the way) in a boring, almost oily brown broth. It had small bits of carrot and long maitake mushrooms and a cilantro-like green on top. Where's the bright colors and amazing presentation? Paired with a Belgium Ale. Better than the dish. Baozi Gyro. Three bite-sized gyros. Served with another Belgium ale. These were good, but still lacking the caliber I was expecting out of CJ. One served with hummus, then tzatziki, then tabbouleh. In my opinion they progressively got better. But by this time, you're 4 cocktails in...I needed a little more substance. April Showers. Interesting concept. It was a deconstructed chicken pot pie. One side was a pounded out chicken cube (very tender) with ING seared into it. The other side was a potato cake, that I couldn't even cut with my knife...and I swear it was bread. The famous flavor foam was frothing from each square and underneath was a creamy cauliflower goodness. The server also brings two plastic ""shampoo"" bottles to the table and says, ""no shower is complete without a little shampoo and conditioner"". Then squeezes a green and white cream onto the chicken. I just have to say I'm disappointed. White chicken with white foam and white cauliflower on a white plate, accented by a guac-colored green paste and another white.  Did I mention I'M STARVING??? And now onto dessert...   Another cool thing about iNG, was our M Berry tab, served with slices of lemon and lime and a shot glass of soda. You're told to let the tab dissolve on your tongue, then flavor the soda water to your liking. Again, this was their opportunity to be awesome. Instead of bringing dried up bar lemons and limes...bring me a range of things to try with this M tab. Let's test this baby! This M Berry tab really does mess with your taste buds.  By this time the M Berry is just about worn off...but makes the Reisling that this dessert is served with like drinking liquid sugar, kind of cool. May flowers: Cool idea. Served in a clay pot, this is a layered dessert that resembles key lime pie. Probably the most hearty portion of the entire meal. Very tasty. Our next dessert was a play off a Cadbury Egg. Two halves of a dark chocolate egg filled with a cherry-flavored brandyish inside. Barely edible. Too strong with booze to enjoy. This was served with a shot of creamy cherry-flavored brandy...probably meant to be the liquid form of the dessert. Also barely drinkable. Looking around at the other tables, I'd bet that there were others that agreed. Our final dessert was the Easter Egg Hunt. This was a chocolate-shell with a chocolate cake interior (think cake pop). The plastic egg (the most colorful thing on any plate throughout the evening) was opened to cherry-flavored cream and graham bits. I don't know if my taste buds were dead at this point...but to me this dessert was flavorless. The cake center of the chocolate egg was surprisingly dry and the sauces were flavorless.  For a chef I admired on Top Chef for his grape leaf edible cigars and just all-around OUT THERE ideas, I feel like Jones conformed to the masses. And conformed poorly. With so many super high-end restaurants on this block, I feel like iNG is definitely the ugly stepsister to Moto.",0.9973,0.805,0.139,0.056,0.4928912783751493

And for a small footprint, the layout offered great flow and excellent noise control. Our service was excellent, and the drink pairings were a lot of fun. There was only one wine I wasn't crazy about, but this may have been due to popping a Miracle Berry earlier in the meal, which I opted out of later on. I'm not a huge fan of the ""berry effect"", but glad I tried it. The first 3 courses were worth the price of admission. We especially loved the sweet potato course and could have eaten a foot-long brat from the 3rd course. Unbelievably yummy! The turducken course wasn't our favorite, though we really dug the brussel sprouts and purees. And who doesn't like crispy bacon?? I still had a bit of beer from the brat pairing, which made this course a bit more exciting. Our least favorite was the final course. Although labeled ""figgy pudding,"" the crisped rice through me off, and the overall flavor profile wasn't extraordinary. But, I liked the idea of all the pieces and parts. ING is a fantastic value, and after meeting the chef and hearing his thoughts about food, I will definitely go back.

After reading about the salad in the box supposed to having smoke when you opened it, I was surprised this didn't work for any of us.  This tasted like a greasy caesar salad bite that melted in your mouth.  Even though I have to say, it was one of the best things of the night. There was a nonalcoholic drink served with every course.  They were all way over sweetened and tasted like syrup.  With the miracle berry, they were even more sweet.  The girls even agreed they were too sweet! All food was served room temperature.  The restaurant was also kept cool, so you had nothing to keep you warm during the 2-1/2 meal. 2 courses with cheese was too many for me.  Neither excited me.

Sweet potato chain tasted like it was boiled, due to them soaking in water for days to be able to carve the chain.  Pretty, but not so tasty.  The vanilla parsnips with the hazelnuts were the highlight of the dish.

Ditto for faux waffle and bacon.  The service was outstanding - even got a personalized tour of the kitchens afterward, and we felt very welcomed.  There were 3 issues with the dinner.  First, the duck with noodle dish that average - comparable to what one would get in most Chinatown restaurants.  Second, (and an item I brought to management's attention, but have not heard back after a week); the origami-folded menu featured a seasoned ""packing peanut"" that was essentially seasoned Pirate's Booty that had been dipped in liquid nitrogen that, while I was assured it was safe, actually left my tongue cold-burnt for 2 days.  Finally, alcohol was a requisite part of the tasting menu, which is a problem, especially because I don't drink much, and we ended up paying for drinks that we barely touched.  Again, it's difficult to negotiate these matters when on a date early in the dating process.

Proceeded to wait and wait for someone to come back.  Finally 15mins go by, the server comes over and asks if we have questions about the menu.  We say no.  It was a six course tasting with drink pairings for $85.  Now the drink pairing really wasnt that exciting.  I would have rather paid more and gotten more to drink because the problem was with the ""food tripping"" you couldnt get just a standard glass of wine on the side because the pill altered the taste of everything.  I definitely would have liked more to drink with each course.  The menu was called food tripping.  Weird thing was, no one explained what that meant. First course...came out with a cocktail that looked similar to the one I had at Aviary.  Sidecar of booze & glass of shaved ice.  Dump it in, stir & dissolves...drink.  Well it was pretty disgusting.  It tasted like a so-co lime shot but in the drink form....yuck.  The sweet potato came out with a side plate of what looked like an aspirin & lemon.  Cool presentation.  Blah, blah, blah about how potato link was made from the same piece...ie potato.  As the server was walking away, I was like & what is this side plate for?  He was like ""oh, that's the most important part.  It's the miracle berry that you take to make sour things sweet.  Have some bites of your food, then let it dissolve, then try the food & see how it changes.""  Cool concept...POOR delivery!!!!  The first course tasted like sweet potato...nothing exciting at all.  Definitely didnt taste any white truffle or goat cheese in this presentation...it all just tasted like sweet potato. Second course...this was actually really good.  The server mispronounced the sauce and said 'sriachi' when it's sriacha....this seemed to be a recurrent theme all nite to point where we thought they were doing in purpose for the experience but later realized they were not.  Also saying 'balsimic' instead of balsamic.  Also, I didnt pick up on the Dr Seuss themed ""roast beast"" and they didnt explain it.  I actually was like ""what is roast beast?""  Third course was brought out to us before the wine pairing came out...again, it was just annoying.  It was almost like they were rushing us through the meal...slow down junior.  We were trying to enjoy...however it was difficult.  This was a duck ramen soup like.  Again it was just ok.  It lacked flavor.  There was absolutely no pizazz.  The soft boiled egg was good in it.  It was like high class ramen....but not necessarily better. Next up was their 'surf & turf'. Short rib & salmon.  The short rib was pretty fatty.  The sauce made this dish & at this point I was looking for something substantial.  The salmon was actually really good, but it was a VERY small portion... Cheese course...this came with a ""redose"" of the pill all crushed up on a spoon.  So there was two real cheeses, two fake cheeses....the sharp cheddar or whatever it was was fantastic.  The fake cheese tasted like gritty applesauce and lemon mush...and it wasnt any better after the chalky redose of the pill.  It was Blah...ugh, thinking about taking that crushed up pill is giving me chills because it was that bad going down... Dessert was this disgusting take on breakfast.  I just didn't understand the concept of making everything look like breakfast but not taste anything like it.  There was a cookie shaped like bacon.  It had no bacon flavor at all & tasted like shortbread?  But it wasnt good shortbread.  Sunny side up looking egg...the yolk was a mimosa something & not sure what the egg white was but it was a gelatinous disgusting mess...blah.  The egg looked really good but was my least favorite on the plate.  It did not taste good or flow with the other pieces on the plate.  Waffle had a piece of 'butter' that was actually some sort of ice cream...that was good, however the waffle was mushy, creamy weirdness???  With a little maple syrup and cinnamon flavor?  I didnt get it....I really didnt....

2011-10-02,5.0,"Finally got around to Date Night last Thursday and spent it at iNG.  It was absolutely outstanding.  Lots of fun & funky touches -- the origami menus, the pipette of delicious soup -- and also absolutely amazing attention to detail.  It was simply a knock-out meal!! Food: I'll try to streamline this a bit, since there are DETAILED food reviews already in here, and say that 4 out of 4 courses were DELICIOUS, satisfying, and creative.  Especially the poke tuna, the black cod, the noodles, and the waffle.  Like, everything I ate. Drink: Wine pairings were spot on --such that I'd like to go out and buy pretty much everything we drank.  Super reasonable prices -- not cheap, but very affordable, and some unusual choices (that all worked). Service: Excellent.  Friendly, smooth, deeply knowledgeable.  Trevor took exceptional care of us. Setting: The vibe to me is very euro, which is lovely.  We could have been at some hip spot in Amsterdam. Parking was tricky.  But oh well. Oh, and the desserts are so much fun!!  The place is not exactly geared-for-kids, but we're thinking of bringing our kids here, just for that so-called waffle.  Passion fruit ice cream disguised as butter?  Awesome. P.S.  We did the 4-course chef's menu, and I had several dietary requests, and they honoured them all without batting an eye (while keeping my husband's food just as it comes without all the restrictions).  Like I say, attention to detail.  Mmm.

We ordered a third dessert to split among the 4 of us (nutella oatmeal cookies) and it was probably the best of the 3 desserts (I know, we're pigs).

2011-09-24,5.0,"iNG was amazing! This was the best meal I've had in some time and for that it gets the honor of being my 400th review! Yelp on~! When my friend and I heard about the Miracle Berry ""Flavor Tripping Menu"" we knew we had to get to iNG and give it a go. I've been wanting to try iNG for sometime (ever since I tried their dish at Bacon Fest)  and miracle berries are just so cool! Since iNG is in the meatpacking district, it's pretty easy to find parking. Aviary is right next door, if you want to go for drinks before or after dining! We got there right at our reservation time at 7 and were stead right away. It was pretty dead in there, much more so than I would think it would be...but it was a weekday. We were seated at a picnic style table and it was kind of a weird setup shuffling into the table. Either way, we sat down and the amazing dinner got started! We had an amazing server who fully described every step and course of the menu. He was very thorough and just great in describing everything. He first brought us our menus in a cute little oragami style cube with an amuse bouche in it. Amuse bouche was cool...tofu and a tube filled of yummy liquid! Before we started dining, we were brought the miracle berry tablets, lemons to make sure the tablets had taken effect and a Tequila Sunrise drink. We were told to drink the drink before & after the tablet...it was so cool! With the tablet, it just tasted so sweet~no liquor taste at all!  Our first course was Oyster with uni, foie gras and smoking Dogfish beer pairing. The presentation on this course was so cool with the glass for the beer coming out upside down with smoke inside. It really enhanced the flavor, plus the beer while tripping on a miracle berry made for a much richer taste. I don't usually eat oyster and have never eaten foie gras, but this dish was amazing.  The second course  was Baozi pork buns with enoki mushrooms, melted scallions and black vinegar\which was another scrumptious course! Absolutely delish with the softest buns I've ever has! And the enoki....ahhh...I just adore enoki! The next course was Cod with shiso, scallop, edamame, and white soy fume. I don't normally like fish but this turned out to be my favorite dish of the whole night! The shiso the dish was in just added to the flavor so much! I was a bit apprehensive about the duck dish since it listed white chocolate as an accompaniment and I hate white chocolate! But this course was just another fabulous tier on the tasty cake. The duck came with sweet peas cooked into little pancakes which were phenomenal, tokyo turnips, white chocolate and mint! Yum!  At this point I was so full, but the most visually appealing course of the night was the dessert called 'Breakfast'. Take a look at the picture I posted...can you imagine all of this was actually dessert food!? It was such a mind *&^% and just so cool!  The breakfast dessert had Lychee, coconut, a bacon cookie with sour cherry sauce to be like ketchup for the dessert. I left so please and so stuffed! This was such an amazing experience that I am planning on taking out of town friends!

The menu came out folded, oragami-like, with an amuse bouche poking out of it attached to a test tube containing sauce (to squirt in your mouth when you pop it in). I was ready for the pretentiousness and the crazy-looking, bad-tasting food to commence.  I was wholly wrong. Our server was super nice, and very calm - especially when my cousin lost her collective shizz all over him about something small.  Such a pleasant guy, and he made the meal so nice! They didn't rush us out, and the meal was pleasantly long and we received our courses slowly, and paced well.  This is a place to enjoy a meal - have your night revolve around this restaurant. Side note - they make their noodles in-house, so have a noodle bowl.  It was neat to see the chef/cook/dough stretcher pulling and lassoing the dough across the room all night. I ordered the baozi buns, tako taco, cod, and then the waffle for dessert. nothing waky-tabaky looking either: very straight forward food. I think my mouth had an orgasm with every bite from every course. By the time we finished, I was the one squirting. This place is a MUST! The only drawbacks I see are the seating - we had a booth to ourselves, but the seats were like couches that sucked you in. It was hard to get out of the booth.  Not that I was trying to leave! Also, the other seating is family-style which I don't like for quiet, long meals.

Food: I was concerned the food was going to more clever than good. The food was not only presented well it also tasted good. I had the poke, which was fresh and light. The soba noodles were in a cold broth, with crispy Kale and corn. The beef rib was tender with a balance of fat and sauce that completed the meal. The wine pairings came quickly and with each course.

To summarize:   Food was decent, somewhat creative and inventive.  Some risks were not worthwhile.  A better explanation of the use of the miracle berry tablet would have made for a more enjoyable experience.  ...Service was some of the worst I've had, which made for a poor experience.  Explanation below: Bad service.  Waiters look like backstreet boys with their mics.  Waitstaff were serving patrons across the table, fumbling with plates, stretching from behind me to serve my wife sitting across from me, virtually tossing the plate in front of her.  It seemed like some of these guys never worked as waitstaff.  The baozi buns, very poorly mispronounced by all the staff (like were were in Alabama or something...nothing against Alabama, I've never been); it was comical, though they were tasty.   Drink parings arrived prematurely to the lagging food; that we were often finished with our drinks before the food came out.  We thought the drinks were separate courses of their own because of the lag.   Menu was based around the miracle berry tablet, which we knew little about at the time.  The waiter did a poor job explaining the purpose of it and how to utilize/taste it in different ways with the food to change our experience.  He was so vague that many of us didn't know what to do with the tablet so we just ate it.  Later a 2nd tablet came out and was just left there on on the table; we weren't sure whether it was extra or to be used in another course.   I expect more from the Moto guys.  Maybe we had some new staff, hopefully they'll work out the kinks.

2011-08-22,4.0,"If you're like me, you probably end up eating out often, and inevitably you'll start to feel as if you are eating at the same places over and over, even when visiting a restaurant for the first time. When this happens you are in a rut. If you find yourself in a rut, head to iNG for a creative menu, in friendly environment. After all, what gets you out of a rut faster than Cantu and his molecular gastronomy. We went with the 8 course tasting menu, which lasted a little under 2 hours. If you're not willing to invest that much time (and money) I'd recommend the a la carte menu. I loved the poke tuna and the baozi buns are definitely not to be missed. The Japanese shortrib looks like it came straight out of that drive-in restaurant from the Flintstones. It was huge and definitely worth checking out. Desert was a hit of molecular gastronomy. The breakfast, which looks like a sunny-side up egg, with bacon and hash browns, is actually a pineapple penne cotta with a coconut macaroon and a cookie for the bacon. The waffle is a reconstructed Boston cream doughnut with banana and chocolate and is absolutely amazing. Don't skip the sweet treats at iNG. My only complaint was that our party of 4 made a reservation for 9:30 and didn't get seated until closer to 10. I'm fine with making a later reservation, just let me know. I'm not a huge fan of places that take reservations but can't hold reservations. So minus points for that.  On the plus side, however, the service was great and the friendly bartender made waiting for a table a much more pleasant experience than it could have been. I'd also recommend keeping an eye on what you're spending. I personally didn't mind, but you can wind up racking up quite a tab here before you know it (which I think is reflected in some of the negative reviews). So if you're counting your pennies order smart and keep track of what you're eating and you won't be so upset when your tab comes. I thoroughly enjoyed my trip to iNG. The menu was creative and fun, and the staff was knowledgeable and friendly.

The hostess couldn't understand or appreciate how this could be the absolute worst beginning to what is supposed to be a pleasurable experience. We left starving and went to Publican where, in less than 5 minutes we had a complimentary assortment of goodies in front of us. Here's the long story:  I had a 9:15 reservation at Ing this past Saturday. My bf and I had just enjoyed a wonderful show at the Aloft Loft (highly recommend it) and we were excited about trying out a new spot. We walked in at 9:10 and the hostess informed us that the guests at our table were taking longer than expected, ""You will be sat closer to 9:15"". She ushered us to the ""bar"" -a long red table that faces a wall. We asked if we could wait outside where there were a dozen empty tables. We were offered some water and given drink menus. I was starving and had already enjoyed some wine at the show so I choose not to continue drinking on an almost empty stomach. My boyfriend ordered a drink. Fifteen minutes later the hostess assured us that it wouldn't be much longer. I asked for a dinner menu so that when we were sat we'd be ready to place our order right away (I had a birthday party I still needed to attend).   We were checked on periodically for the next 30 minutes or so. I was asked probably 5 more times if I wanted a drink. No. I don't. I want food. After an hour of waiting patiently, the hostess came out to inform us that our table was being set. Then, minutes later a group of three people (wearing flip flops and Disney shirts) walked up and began debating whether they should check the place out. Clearly, they did not have a reservation.  I thought, good luck with that. Minutes later the hostess came to show us to our table -a long communal table that appeared to have two too many seats at it. As we sat waiting to be greeted by a server, we both noticed the apparently reservation-less party of three sitting comfortably at a table large enough to seat 6. My bf pulled the hostess aside to express his disappointment. How is it that she thought seating a party without a reservation before a party with a reservation (who waited 70 minutes for a table) was good service? Her answer: They are a 3 top.

The owner (Homaro Cantu) was walking between restaurants and stopped by our table to introduce himself and describe what was about to happen. He was very friendly and answered any questions we had.  I had the Skinny Margarita into Tequila Sunrise. The drink came out in a glass with accompanying test tube filled with liquid. I dropped the test tube in the glass and it mixed well together, making a delicious margarita flavor. Then I sucked on the mberry that was given to us at the beginning of the night. It tasted like a mellow sweet tart. After finishing the mberry, I took another sip of the drink. It had transformed into a much sweeter drink. Not knowing if my mind was just playing tricks on me, we were told to bite into a lemon. The sour/bitter taste of the lemon now tasted like lemonade or sugar covered lemon.

2011-05-29,4.0,"I am a big fan of doing tasting menus/chef's choice menus whenever I can because it really does tend to show off the best parts of a menu.  Also, I think some chef's really enjoy preparing foods for those that want to experience the best.   Before walking into iNG I had already decided against the tasting based on other reviews of how the ""tasting by the hour"" worked.  However, our server explained to us up front that it would be $45 for 4 courses and $80 for 8--there was no nonsense about ""by the hour"" despite the fact that the menu said they offered ""by the hour"" dining.  We decided to go ahead and try the 8 course tasting since our server confirmed that a few of the things we really wanted were on the tasting menu.   As for the quality of the food, I think that it was quite good. The duck and cod, in particular, were very flavorful dishes without being overly gamy or fishy, respectively.  The only dish that left me wanting was the oyster but only because I'm not a huge fan of oysters; however that was made up for by the amazing aromas of cherry wood smoke in a glass over which a sample of Smutty Nose Porter was poured.  The beer itself probably wasn't the best beer I've had, but in combination with the cherry-wood smoke it was absolutely delicious.  This reminded me of something Moto would have done--combinations of taste and smell to provide a wholly different experience. The atmosphere of iNG was very modern and kind of fun, but not very warm.  The hard seats look uncomfortable but actually end up being quite acceptable, even for a 4 hour sitting.  One suggestion on seating: if you do not like communal seating and you are in a group of 5 or 6, call ahead to request a booth (they refer to this as couch seating).   We had a great time here and I think I would be willing to go back, but only with people that had never been here before. It is definitely a place to try once, just like Moto.

My friend and I were seated at the communal table closest to the noodlemaking station. It was fun to watch, but the results from that station left a little to be desired. The noodles were cooked properly, but the broth was bland. The accompanying tempura'd rock shrimp were delicious, though the lemongrass ""sticks"" on which they were skewered were too crumbly to allow one to pick up a skewer to eat the shrimp. I had to use the chopsticks to support the skewer. This restaurant does enjoy showcasing the molecular gastronomy. I think the gelatin cased liquids (sauce, essence of coconut, lychee ""yolk"") seemed repetitive. The soup in a pipette with a small cube of tofu was made too special for what it really was. The breakfast themed desserts were cute, but the novelty didn't make up for the average taste/texture of them. The Japanese short rib was outstanding, but the accompanying fritters were unevenly cooked, the ""al a dente"" soybeans were too dente and the purple potato mash a bit flavorless. Wine offering were very good and the staff did a great job suggesting pairings. I was also happy with the hendrick's gin cocktail. It was an unusual blend of flavors. I don't think I'll go back.

2011-05-07,2.0,"Apparently, ING is short for disappointING. We waited over half an hour to be seated, despite having a reservation and there being plenty of empty seats. Meanwhile, I ordered the Black and White cocktail with bacon-infused bourbon, maple and cinnamon. Tasting simply like bourbon and maple syrup over ice, it lacked any nuances of bacon or cinnamon and was downright saccharine. It would have made a better dessert than an apertif. DisappointING. We decided to order one hour of the chef's tasting menu for $45. The first tiny course was tasty (egg omelet with wasabi tobiko and shiso), but we waited 20 minutes for the second course, the konbu noodles to arrive. This was the most substantial of the three savory dishes, and again, it was good, but it didn't knock our socks off. Finally, we had the wagyu beef. The best part of that dish was the garlic eggplant. So disappointING. Then came dessert. Pasty creme anglaise painted across the plate with a piece of ice cream molded to resemble a waffle and a dollop of banana sorbet ""butter"" on top. Besides looking unappetizing, the ice cream tasted like uncooked waffle batter and I was mystified by the cream with ice cream with sorbet combination. The dessert took about four bites to eat, which would have been disappointing if it had tasted any good. If a ""chef's choice"" option is offered, I feel that it should feature the chef's best dishes. In offering a gimmick such as ""eat by the hour"" (and it is a total gimmick, we were told we would have at least four courses in that hour, possibly more, then proceeded to wait 20 minutes between the first and second course) you're asking diners to trust you to choose the dishes that will please them most. The diner should not come away feeling like they just overpayed for a substandard meal. Based on the four courses we had, we won't be going back to ING. If repeat business is important, the chef needs to make sure every dish offered is outstanding.  I suppose what's most disappointing about our experience at ING is that we've come to expect more from Homaro Cantu. My husband and I enjoyed a meal at Otom a couple of years ago, and for our money, Moto is still the most flavorful, fun and interesting meal you can get in Chicago (I'm looking at you, Alinea!) so we were expecting ING to be a similarly fun and delicious night out.

So we did just as Richard S. proposed and ordered the whole menu, including cocktails.  We contemplated eating by the hour, but every person gets the same thing, so if you have a large group it doesn't make sense, but I think it is a fun idea.  The transition time between plates was not an issue, things came out timely. I can honestly say that everything was amazing.  Oddly the only plate I thought was not good was the wagyu.  However, the soy rice crispy was pretty good.  I think the highlights were the following... -Baozi buns - I could eat 20 of these -Oyster - dude, it's served with a smoking glass that they pour beer in!!!  This is definitely the best presentation item on the menu. -Poke - a new age chip dip -Okonomiyaki Sake - it comes out on a huge deer lick of pink Himalayan salt! -Cod - the best ""entree"" size item served, possibly the best thing we ordered. -Waffle - a frozen waffle-like thing that melts in your mouth, I felt like it was something in a Willy Wonka movie I have to give special attention to the soups.  My thinking is the next place that these guys open up should be a soup counter.  From the pre-dinner shot glass to all 3 of the ""BoiliNG"" soups... each one was magnificent.  We all said that we were going to try to come back, belly up to the ""bar"" and just get a soup. You really can't go wrong here.  I can't compare it to Moto or any other equivalent place in the city, but from a guy who doesn't do this ever, it was my top dining experience in Chicago, possibly ever.   Recommend!!

You can choose to eat ""by the hour"" (their version of a set course dinner) or choose to eat a la carte which is what we did.  First the space. This certainly takes minimalism to a new level. One wall is tiled with mini white tiles waving like the sea. The other? Horizontal planks running from the front to the back of the restaurant. There are two large communal tables and a series of large booths. The clear plastic chairs add to the minimalist feeling (almost felt like a 60's theme) and I almost laughed when they told me I could wait at the bar, which just looks like another communal table as the libations are hidden behind a wall giving those at the bar a wall to stare at.  But the real action here is in the front windows of iNG. There, Chinese noodles are being made from wheat dough that is stretched, pulled and ""thawked"" until it turns into these wonderful noodles that you can have during the ""boiliNG"" course. Pretty cool but the all that boiling makes the place a little humid as the night wears on.  So on to the food. The menu comes in an origami box which you unwrap and find a sake cup in the bottom which is quickly filled with a sip of miso soup, Tasty and a good portent of things to come.  We ordered a couple of the starters (ahi poke and baozzi buns with short rib), the la mien soup and the glazed cod. The ahi poke was delicious- large chunks of tuna sitting on a bed of sticky rice with an avocado puree. Too stiff to eat without your fork as the crackers served with it crumble but delicious nonetheless.  The la mien was delicious with pulled pork and mushrooms although It needed to be a little warmer and since we were splitting it- I wished they had split it at the source rather than having us pour it between the two bowls provided. It would make a great take out item on a cold Winter's day.  And finally the cod. soy glazed and served over what looked like a large edamame stuffed ravioli it was quite good although a little fishier than I would have like. My friend had the Wagyu beef that was served on a hot stone and spritzed by the server with a Japanese whiskey before serving. Good but not remarkable.  And finally- you could really see the playfulness of the chef they share with Moto with the dessert special of the day. Called ""breakfast"" this plate of an ""egg, bacon and hash brown"" was really a flan with a pineapple anise yolk, a bacon cookie with the hash brown being a delicious macaroon.  Service was attentive, the food was good, but the whole experience felt a little over done for a place that seems to crave minimalism. Maybe the concept was lost on me but given the food was pretty good- I guess my issue is that the place doesn't invite you to sit,linger and enjoy. More of get in, experience, and get out.

The la mien noodles were soft and not bouncy/spongy enough. It might have been overcooked that's why. The broth was also very salty. We really liked how they did the egg though. Each order came with a boiled quail egg that is cooked in soy sauce. A small hole is poked into the egg so that the soy sauce can penetrate into the yolk. We popped it into our mouths and the soy sauce + yolk flavor came bursting out. That was neat. The duck was also very good. I love my duck medium rare and it came out perfectly. Definitely worth trying. The sake okonomiyaki (Japanese pancake with salmon) was OK although I wasn't blown away. I've definitely had better okonomiyaki elsewhere. The boazi buns were pretty good.

First of all, I thought the place would be a bit more sophisticated than it actually was. I think the place was trendy but too casual. It has wood panel walls on one side and tiles on the other, so the place is kind of loud and it takes away the romantic feel right away. Second, the tables are good for groups, but not so much for dates. They have a long community table in the middle and if you sit facing each other, it's actually kind of far and you need to speak loud to the person across. Again, not so good for dates. The menu, they folded the menu into a cube shape. When you open it, it has a sake cup inside so you'd take that out and the waiter would pour miso soup into the little cup for you. That was creative and I'm sure a lot of people would be impressed by it. But for me, it was a little too much gimmick and the miso soup tasted average. But it's just me! I thought the menu was too small, they basically had 3 items on each category, e.g. 3 items for appetizers, 3 items for cold dishes, and 3 items for hot dishes, etc. So there wasn't too much to choose from.

2011-03-22,2.0,"Allow me to present an iNG-ified guide to my experience at Homaro Cantu's suffix-centered, loosely Asian restaurant. SERViNG In a parallel universe, there's a perfect balance of service that falls between the overly casual, gregarious ""let me sit next to you in your vinyl booth while I take your order, sweetie!"" style and the disconnected, aloof service that we received at iNG. At least half of their servers are former high school football coaches, it seems, and have that same gruff, ""Give me forty pushups before I place an origami amuse-bouche of flavorless miso on your table!"" approach to service. We ordered the four-course prix-fixe (the ""one our experience"") and explained that Bil is a vegetarian who can eat fish, but he is also lactose intolerant so steer clear of the cream, too, please. Disregarding that, he brought Bil one vegetarian dish when the rest of us ate fish and a tofu version of another dish that was made with fish originally. Plus, there was a giant dollop of coconut-flavored whipped cream on his plate of dessert. LOOKiNG I wasn't fortunate enough to visit Otom in its heyday, but I have been to Moto and appreciated its austere, minimalist décor. There's really not much to love about the appearance of iNG -- a wavy, white-tiled wall on one side, wood paneling on the other; uncomfortable red couches and watermelon-colored shell chairs provide the backaches that will turn into stomachaches later (if you're sensitive to kimchi). Not impressed. EATiNG Which is not to say that iNG's food wasn't good. It was. For the price, the quality of a quorum of dishes was outstanding. The tuna and avocado starter was a great balance of flavors, and it was followed up by an amazing popped kale, mushroom, and kimchi soup that was doodled on by some inky hand-pulled noodles. The main dish (for the cow-eaters) were lightly seared beef skewers that were tender but devoid of the sort of flavor one might expect from such high-quality meat. Even worse, a brown rice crispy treat (read: par-frozen square of unseasoned rice deep fried and panko-d to death) was hardly touched by anyone at our table. On the plus side, the collateral damage of an umami explosion huddled in the corner of the plate. It was the best part of the dish -- an awesomely overwhelming ride for the taste buds. I wasn't sure what it really was, but it was great. Dessert was the sort of science-kit kitsch one expects from Cantu: a dehydrated waffle with mango and olive oil ice cream and syrup. It was good -- too sweet, but playful enough. DRINKiNG Chef Cantu has plugged several unique features of his newest restaurant that aren't exactly in place yet -- namely, the magic berry tasting and, in the case of last weekend, the home-crafted beer flight. My heart sank when our waiter growled that the carbonation wasn't right this week. Instead, three of us had the wine flight with our meal, which had a few missteps (especially, in Bil's accurate assessment, the white paired with the kimchi soup course). The first -- a ginger-infused bubbly -- and last -- a figgy mead -- were the standouts here. I will one day return for a taste of the beers. CROWDiNG It looks like word of mouth is keeping the masses away -- when we arrived at 8, there were about three other tables with guests sitting at them. The restaurant slowly filled to about 80 percent capacity, it seemed. This does not bode well, especially when its Achatz-approved next-door neighbors have their open house parties.

Another strange thing to point out is that the restaurant does not use its nanobrews for the drink pairings (and the waiter poorly tried to explain why so basically I have no idea for the reason). Other than these missteps, the food was generally very good.  We did the order by the hour thing, and they graciously allowed me to do a pescatarian menu.  The two standouts were the poke (avocado with a homemade sesame wonton, Asian omelet, and seaweed salad) and the waffle (coconut, mango sorbet, and stout syrup).  My brother had the normal tasting menu and he said that wagyu was inedible.  He did not eat the beef and because of it, could not eat anything else on the plate.

I think I will start with my ""concerns"" I am calling them concerns because one issue is something that I believe they can fix, the other is a style choice that one either enjoys or not. So here goes; the restaurant itself is very modern and spare in a functionally challenging long narrow space. Their solution is communal tables. WHICH I HATE. Despite an almost empty restaurant, we were seated smack up next to a crying baby ( why WHY would you bring a baby to such a very ADULT restaurant - I am saying that emphatically because I love kids and this is not a kid friendly place) To be fair we asked to be moved and they did move us, but not without a lot of confusion. Which sadly brings me to my real complaint. The service is really poor. There are a hundred (OK I am exaggerating) waitstaff and they are so busy herding chickens that no one is really making sure that you are having the sort of dining experience one expects in a not inexpensive restaurant.  I wasn't sure at any given time who our server was, we had so many people picking things up and dropping things off, often with no explanation at all.  We chose the by the hour tasting menu with the wine pairing. The wine pairing was delicious, but delivered so poorly and erratically that it became a distraction instead of a compliment to what was an absolutely EXQUISITE meal. The meal opened with a light and creamy white miso soup amuse bouche ( cleverly concealed in an origami menu) followed by a tuna tartar on sticky rice with a creamy avocado topping. Along side was a cucumber seafood salad with sesame oil and tobiko. OMG it was stunning... next up was the much touted konbu ( I can still taste the puffed kale, it was so yummy) the dish was beautifully executed. I also loved the Wyagu beef presentation on the sizzling hot rock, spritzed with Japanese Scotch. WOW. I also enjoyed the playful take on the waffle desert which was actually an ice cream.  From start to finish the food was beautifully conceived and executed. I enjoyed every delicious bite and totally appreciated the thoughtfulness of each dish.  So at the end of the day ( or this uber long review) they get a 2 for service and a 5 for the cuisine - hopefully over time they will be think ING about the service as much as the were clearly think ING about the food!",0.9969,0.741,0.191,0.067,0.5759888888888889
2011-03-19,5.0,"This place is great.  It is obvious how much thought went into designing the menu. Very creative dishes that were just as much about substance as they were about presentation.   We chose to dine by the hour so we were able to sample a good portion of the menu.  Everything was incredible! The Cod, Baozi Buns, and handmade Udon were among the standouts but the one that really surprised me was the Tako Taco. They poach the Tako (octopus) in a way that gives it such a rich and meaty flavor. Hands down, the best way I've enjoyed tako meat.  Desert was pretty clever as well. The waffle dish remix was a major hit! The service was fantastic as well! (Thomas, Mario and Nate)  Everyone was so attentive and genuinely excited about their menu.  Top notch!

2011-03-13,4.0,"Bottom line: I had a fun meal here.  I've never been to Moto, but when my wife suggested we check this out one day after work, I was all for it. It seemed like an interesting concept and while pricey, not crazy expensive.  We made reservations, but when we got there 40 minutes early they seated us right away. We started with a glass of wine and the beer flight. I thought the beer flight was cool. Belgium and Bancock, pretzel and mustard, an old fashioned, and my favorite IPA with indian spices.  We opted against the per hour which was five courses an hour at $45/hr. For apps we went with the buns which had some heat and the oysters which had foie gras and uni. They both came two per order. The oyster was smokey and had a rich texture. I enjoyed both.  Next up was the la mein. Fresh noodles in an ox tail broth with a quail egg, mushrooms and pork belly. The pork belly was melt in your mouth good. The noodles had a sesame oil taste which I grew up with and enjoyed, my wife not as much. Another winner for me.  At this point, we realized that sharing one entree was not going to be enough, so we added the waygu beef to go along with the duck. Well worth it. The beef was tender and delicious. It came with a rice ""crispy"" and veggies. Best thing we had.  The duck was good too. It came with an indian flavored flat bread with an egg yolk in the middle.  We ended with the chocolate churro dessert. I forgot the name. It was ok. I could have skipped this one.  Our service was great btw. Trevor, I think? showed enthusiasm for the restaurant and was very knowledgeable.  I'd give it a go if you're interested. The portion to $$$ isn't great, but we had a fun time. That's pretty much what it's all about, right? Oh, I forgot to mention that it can get loud as hell in here and the seats are a bit uncomfortable. I tried to discreetly tell my wife that Mancow was sitting behind us. She couldn't hear me, so just as the place gets quiet, I yell ""that's Mancow!!""

I saw absolutely no one in the restaurant talking up the food or being excited about what was coming out.  They only have 13-15 items total on the menu and they should make those really shine.  If not, this place won't last 6 months. Also, the interior design they talk about so much looked like Ikea at best.  Sorry, but I will be ""passING"" on ever going back to this place.

We opted for the ""chef's choice"" by the hour--we should have been told that it was not ""chef's choice"" but a prix fixe as every other table who chose that option got the same exact thing.  The choices were fine, but it was poor form for the restaurant to pretend the chef was choosing our meals based on what he had in the kitchen and our preferences and not just share the prix fixe menu. Our food got delivered to the table next to us TWICE.  We waited an additional 10-20 minutes each time.  No apology until we said something, and, then, when we already had received the dessert course and had ordered a second dessert off-prix fixe that we wanted to try, the server's idea of making up for it was to bring us a THIRD dessert.

2011-03-06,2.0,"I was so excited to try iNG and have been bugging bf about going since they opened.......we finally decided to do date night there.......and regrettably I have to say I was incredibly underwhelmed on all sorts of levels.....   We got there at 8pm on a Wednesday.....restaurant was full-ish but def not packed. They seated us at the communal table in the front.....we had space on either side of us and both couples left shortly after we got there.....but wow can I just tell you that the chairs at that table are some of the most uncomfortable contraptions I've ever sat in! Pretty to look at.....but a bitch to sit in for longer than 10 minutes. The change-over from Otom was subtle.....still sleek, modern and low-profile......but also very very loud.....diner beware!   The menu presentation came as a little folded origami box.....which when opened had a small shot glass inside that they waiter then poured some broth into and voila.....amuse bouche and menu all in one! As much as I liked this little trick (and I def did) it was the only fun thing reminiscent of Moto during the whole meal.  On to the food.....the menu itself is divided up into 5 sections: Heating, Cooling, Boiling, Melting & Sweetening....this is what we got:   Poke (avocado, sesame wonton): Easily the best thing we ordered.....base was sticky rice, stacked with Poke tartar and topped with delicious whipped avocado....served with sesame wonton chips. I could have eaten a whole plate of this to myself......flavors and textures were perfect-o.....my only complaint is that there were only 2 wonton chips and they were too thin to scoop with.....boo :(   La Mein (pork belly, dark soy egg): So I'm a huge ramen fan...let me rephrase....I'm a huge fan of fantastic ramen....but will sway to ""just good enough for not being in Japan"" on most ramen occasions. My mouth was watering just looking at the description for this dish and knowing that they pull their own ramen noodles was about enough to send me into hyper-drive.....but guess what?? It was terrible!!! The broth was so salty I only ate about 6 bites and had to pass it off to bf.....As for the actual components of the soup.....pork belly, mushrooms, egg & I believe some short ribs......maybe they were tasty but I honestly couldn't discern any other flavor except for salt, salt and more salt. Then the noodles, oh lord the noodles!! No elasticity or any kind of firmness to be found.....there was no way to eat them with chopsticks, they just completely fell apart.....I can't believe they pull their own noodles......in my opinion they'd do better off pulling them right out of a bag of Maruchan. The whole dish was just blasphemous!    Wagyu (firebrick, ponzu, soy rice krispy): I actually really really liked this dish.....all 2 measly strips of it. They bring a little firebrick to the table and cook the wagyu while they tell you about the dish......but the actual beef was literally two extremely thin slices about 3 inches long and 1 inch wide.....imagine a shorter piece of bacon and you'd be right on.....our waiter had said that the larger plates came with 3oz of protein.....and I did not bring my digital scale but this did not look like 3oz of meat. Anyway....the flavors were good and I fell in love with the soy rice krispy which was really a risotto ball coated in panko and fried...yum!!   Cod (shisho, lemongrass, longganisa): This was also good.....but just not great.....bf said he liked this better than the wagyu (but maybe it was b/c his piece of beef was so small he couldn't taste it). Cod came in a shallow broth....which made it a little mushy by the time bf passed it to me....I did like the little homemade ravioli filled with cheese that came with it.....but other then that not a memorable dish for me.   My last disappointment was with our waiter. I am usually a fun, chatty and engaging diner and true to form that's the mood I was in that night.....but our waiter wasn't having much of it and was, to be honest, kind of a jerk. He didn't seem like he really wanted to be there or at least not waiting on us and when I had questions about some of the menu items and wines I felt like he might have well have ended each response with ""Idiots""....that's how much attitude this guy was throwing. I'm sorry sir I didn't realize that my meal came with arrogant, condescending service...otherwise I would have asked for it on the side. Overall.....If I could go 2.5 stars, I would.....just for the Poke, the Wagyu & the risotto ball....still, those few shining stars are not enough to bring me back. What should have been a fun, romantic meal full of delicious surprises was just an uncomfortable, mediocre dinner with lame service.

2011-03-04,3.0,"iNG appears to be tryiNG to briNG modernist gastronomy to the masses.  Like a magic show or spectacle, there are flourishes of wonder. Saucepans of liquid nitrogen brought to your table, a frozen foam is dished on to your plate, the visual equivalent of a margarita, shaken tableside: heads can't help but turn. Skewers of wagyu sizzle on a brick as the server turns them once before plating them tableside. A tumbler of hickory smoke is lifted as oysters, dressed in foie and uni, are placed in front of you; the smoke rises, evocative of a wintery, savory fire. The vacuum sealer, the key tool of the sous vide kitchen, is used with a liberal hand; garnishes as well as center-of-the-plate items get the treatment, if only, in some cases, to have all cellular structure flattened and smoothed. But as a whole, it simply doesn't mesh. Flavors are out of balance; too much acidity, too little umami. Noodles are mushy, not chewy. ""Popped Kale"" loses its charm as it soaks up the broth it sits in. There are textural contrasts a-plenty: crunchy vs saucy vs chewy, but not enough to overcome the overall execution.  There's a lot of flash. A lot panache. And an obvious expertise with the contemporary tricks of the kitchen. Too obvious, at times.  The most successful dish of the night, by our reckoniNG, was a simple black cod, shellacked with a soy-based glaze and dressed with fried sweet potato and perched on two dumplings in a fragrant broth. There was no flash or flare, smoke or explosions, but it was delicious.  Sometimes the most simple things can be the most memorable.",0.9525,0.856,0.093,0.051,0.49885714285714294
2011-03-02,5.0,"Otom to Ing.  Yes, incredibly fast makeover.  Mind bogglingly fast.  Though they kept the most important piece: Chef Thomas Bowmen. I thought the interior was a bit...lacking.  It looked like those ""Expression"" brand Intellgentsia coffeeshops meets Avec.  Something like a woodsy, cozy, bright red, futuristic restaurant.  Not sure if I quite get it. The service was absolutely impeccable.  My water never stayed empty for long.  Their spiels were well rehearsed, they got their shit down. So the food I guess is best described as modern asian fusion.  They handpull their own noodles which i think is pretty amazing.  Not sure who else does outside of Chinatown and Takashi. So the food.  I did a tasting and drinking tasting menu. Baozi - the buns weren't the pasty white color you would traditionally expect from baozi, but man; it was good.  The texture of the buns were so soft with the perfect amount of give.   poke - I felt the avocado...I think mousse was a bit overpowering.  I would've like to been able to taste the fish a bit more clearly. japanese omelet - I got a bit lost on this dish to be honest la mien - la mien is the original ramen.  that is to say Chinese ramen; although the Chinese invented it, it's more associated with Japanese ramen.  The noodles were nothing like Japanese ramen.  I found them to be delicious though.  They were thicker and less eggy, rather than having a springy texture they were more savory and starchy.  The broth was delicious, and the pieces of pork belly were huge.  Really really good dish konbu - I didn't enjoy this dish as much.  The kale and the kimchi dashi just didn't meld very well in my mind. wagyu - they source their wagyu from one of the few grass-fed only wagyu providers in America.  Quality of meat was fantastic, and the grass fed flavor lends to a ""meatier"" flavor, while being very tender. duck - some of the best duck I've ever had.  perfect smokey outside, tender inside. waffle - got a little lost in this dish.  It's like a reverse waffle, but it didn't quite come together for me. tiramisu lapsaing - it was a green tea tiramisu, not too sweet, perfectly decadent.  The lapsang was so interesting, it was sour, sweet, salty, and super smokey.  Never had a dessert encompass all those flavors. Booze: Also, try the beer flights. They brew all the beers in house.  Seriously some of the most interesting stuff i've ever tried, and they are constantly trying new things out.  Some of the stuff they had was indian pale ale (pale ale with actual indian spices, not to be confused with a run of the mill IPA), a sage witbier, pretzel & mustard beer, lemongrass beer, and an amazing coffee & doughtnuts stout.  One of the best stouts I've had at a brewery in the city.  Probably the best even... The sommelier Garrett is amazing.  He pairs the libations with the food very well.  Not only was wine in the mix, but so was African honey mead wine and cloudy junmai sake.

Highlights of my meal: The house-brewed nano-batch beers.  My faves were the barley & tea, the precint, and the old fashioned.  The Precint is a dark coffee stout I wish they serve at Lavazza.  Wouldn't mornings with a flaky croissant be so much better?  There's also the Old Fashioned.  It's only on preview right now.  All the ingredients of an Old Fashioned was added in the brewing process, in bourbon barrels.  Is it a beer?  Or is it a cocktail? Baozi Buns, Pork, Enoki, Melted Scallions.  The filling is in a jumbled pile.  The baozi, a buttery brioche, sits separately.  A shot of sriracha in the pork jolts everything into perspective. Tuna Poke.  Served as a mock sushi, with rice in the bottom, and an avocado mousse acting as wasabi. Udon, Rock Shrimp, Coconut, Vietnamese Coriander.  2 of the cooks at the front kitchen (as in street view) were hand pulling noodles all night.  Nicely fried tempura rock shrimp.  A coconut encapsulation mimicking poached egg.  When you poke through it, the membrane even looked like egg membrane. Duck, Fried egg, Puri, Longganisa.  Knockout dish.  Seared duck breast with orange gastrique, a nod to duck a'l'orange.  Filipino longganisa presented as crumbled sausage.  A crispy duck 'chip'.  Indian puri bread with a fried quail yolk, done 'egg-in-the-basket' style. Waffle, Coconut, Mango Sorbet, Stout.  Waffle dough ice cream, shaped like a waffle slice.  A square pat of mango sorbet mimicking a pat of butter.  Stout sauce.   Why 4 stars?  Molecular gastronomy doesn't have to be mind and body exhausting 20 course events.  It can be casual and really humorous like what iNG is presenting.  It would be interesting to see how the by-the-hour and pricing options work.  Would also like to try the Miracle Berry chef's table once it's available.  iNG has mad geniuses in the kitchen and at the bar.  Go if you like tasty food that will make you smile.",0.9945,0.825,0.155,0.02,0.4602770562770563

It was an a la carte menu where you could pick and choose items to order off the menu as you would in a normal restaurant. Between 2011 and 2013 I had been back 3 more times to iNG for amazing, innovative, exceptionally cool dining experiences (an entire menu based on miracle berry flavor tripping, a global street food theme, and one other I can't remember).  All three times were a 6-8 course meal with amazing portions, taste, & service for around $80. Looks like things have gone downhill for this place, which is really unfortunate since it started out so great! Hopefully reinvention will bring everyone back to the original plan that rocked my socks! While iNG is still ironing out some of the exciting future offerings (can't wait for the Miracle Berry flavor trip!) it's amazing right now.  For anyone who's looking for that molecular gastronomy experience but doesn't want to pay through the nose, this is a good place to start.   The menu is interesting and exciting and, while the portions are small (aka normal), the price is very reasonable.  I had an appetizer, an entree, and a full dessert (plus split another dessert with my friend) and my bill was $50. If that's not a great dining deal (in Chicago) (in a new hip restaurant) I don't know what is. Have to give props to the service.

Fulton Market St. here in Chicago!  It's a Japanese style menu, with a Moto twist to it.   I had dinner here, and got to sample quite a bit of the menu, as well as some in-house brewed beers.   The space was really transformed into something flowing and bright.    One entire wall is wavy translucent small white tiles that makes you feel as if you were dining  in the clouds.   The table are an interesting and comfy mix of half white chairs, and half plush red couches.  Ceilings are high and open, with small lights hanging about two feet down from them.    What really makes this place stand out though is the tri-fecta of food/drink stations within it.   In the front window you can see one or two of the chefs whipping up Japanese noodle dishes.  All of the noodles here are fresh.  REALLY fresh.   Made on site, in front of your eyes, you can watch as they roll, pull, twist, and dangle in the air, giant strands of noodles about to be thrown in water for your enjoyment.  In the middle of iNG, you will find the 'bar', which consists of a very snazzy red glass top, and some sort of see through red orb behind it (where the drinks are made).  I could see this being a great spot to grab a coctail and nibble on an appetizer or two.  The final 'station' as I call it, is in the far back where you can watch another chef or two, cook up some real surprises, ala Moto style.   When I was there, they seemed to really enjoy us walking up to each 'station' and talk about what was to come, and how they created the dishes so far.  I liked this!   You got to get a glimpse of what was going on behind the curtains. Now, to the good stuff.  The food.  Let's start with the menu.  This is iNG, so of course it's gotta be different from the rest.  Drawing on the Japanese themed influences, they have disguised their menu as a piece of origami, delivered to the table on a plate, with a dipping sauce that reminded me of sweet thai chili sauce.  You open the box, to discover the menu, and a crispy duck spring roll inside (in a wrapper).  Read the menu while you eat the roll.  Loved it!   Next up was a small salad type dish, that consisted of some cucumber and seaweed salad, and 3 different  variations of  a Japanese omelet.   There was a yolk version, an egg white version, and then a very traditional rolled version.  This was a refreshing start. After that, the real fun started.  Courses came at nice pace, and each was impressive in it's own way.   There was a blue point oyster topped with foie gras and uni mousse, which was served with a tall beer glass filled with smoke (think of the smell of an amazing beach campfire, and that was it!).  You turned over the glass, they poured a shot of red ale into it, you ate the oyster, drank the ale, and took it all in.  Great stuff!  And I don't eat oysters! Other highlights included pork belly steamed buns, a miso marinated black cod with an edamame dumpling, and a HUGE duck dish complete with duck breast, duck sausage, a quail egg, and some kind of Indian bread.  That one was a bit strange for me, and the only entree that I didn't find appetizing.    Desert was good, but could've been better.  It was a Japanese matcha (green tea) cake tiramisu.  On the side was dried pineapple powder that could've easily stole the show from the cake. So there you have it.  The full review!    Should you try iNG?  ABSOLUTELY.   I think you'll be impressed from the second you step in the door!    OH, I almost forgot to mention that they do a very cool in house beer flight, and on the night I was there, they had four offered.  Each served in a small shotglass size cup.   Varieties included Sage and Green Tea, Indian Spice, a wheat version, and a espresso and glazed doughnut porter.  Watch out!",0.9931,0.907,0.088,0.004,0.48748611111111095
2011-02-14,3.0,A lot of potential but not quite there. There were some items that were very good and others that missed completely. On the positive the nano-brewery beer and the staff were amazing. Maybe given some time this place will really shine but right now it's still an unpolished gem.,0.9323,0.714,0.24,0.045,0.6230241187384046
