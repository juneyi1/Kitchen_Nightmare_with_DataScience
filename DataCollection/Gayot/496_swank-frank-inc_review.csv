2007-01-03,4.0,"I was so happy when this place re-opened with VEGGIE DOGS on the menu! Basically that's why I'm giving it 4 stars. This is just a standard fast-food place, but they do have a good amount of options with hush puppies and sweet potato fries on the menu. I mostly just go here for the veggie dog, which is actually really good I think mostly to the yummy bun that they use.

2006-11-07,3.0,"EDIT (04-19-07): This place is now CLOSED! Don't get me wrong, I preferred the hot dogs and pizza from the Underdog cart outside Flash Taco (directly across the street), but this place had pretty decent food. And what are they putting in its place? A Bank of America. There's already another bank across the fucking street. Man... Eat shit.  ~*~*~*~*~*~ Their cheese fries are good. So are their mozerella sticks, as well as their gyros. Awesome greasy food to cut the aftermath of binge drinking. Heck, I've had these 3 menu items sober and they're still pretty good. Kinda overpriced. I've had stuff comparable for cheaper. But, when you're drunk, you fork over the money for insanely delicious, greasy food.",0.9722,0.714,0.214,0.072,0.6854166666666667
2006-10-10,4.0,"My love for hotdogs aside, Swank Frank is bitchin' because it's the only place I've found that serves fried Twinkies outside of good ol' Louisiana.  Yeah, I said it--I ate a fried Twinkie, with my dad no less, the fellow who has crossed gluten and white sugar and dairy off his Christmas card list (and no, it wasn't because of the Twinkie). Sugar + fat + fried +chocolate sauce and/or powdered sugar = disgustingly indulgent.  It's like looking death in the face, shrugging your shoulders with indifference and continuing down your path of damnation.  It tastes good, sort of... warm, gooey, sweet--but you can't help have the nagging sensation that 10 years of your life just went down the drain in a giant glob of trans fats. Anyhoo, eating a fried Twinkie is a surefire way to get your daily caloric allowance while upping your chance for a massive heart attack.  Actually, I might be wrong about the caloric allowance part because, I ain't gonna lie, this thing makes its way out shortly after it's made its way in.",-0.8205,0.755,0.104,0.142,0.4937908496732026

2006-08-07,4.0,"This was the group's last stop this past Friday evening.  I have to say, as hot dog joints go, Swank Frank's is right up there.  If you've been to a Chicago hot dog stand, then you know the menu.  I don't need to tell it to you.  Is there a law that dictates what these places serve? What I liked about Swank Frank's was the dude behind the counter.  This guy actually took joy in conversing with the drunk asses, rather then loath them.  Our group, collectively probably did 3 Jager-bombs a piece, so we were all lit and somewhat confused about our order.  The guy behind the counter was patient and helped us remember what we had ordered, not 10 minutes prior.

I've only had a burger since their remodel which makes them look retro instead of just run down.  I probably would never eat here before midnight but once the restaurants are shut down this is an awesome place to grab a fanta grape soda and a Gyro. Speaking of the Gyro, aka. the belt buster, this is bigger and better tasting then any Gyro in Greek Town (they fry the bread a bit, yum!). Since their remodel I notice they've posted quite a few vegan and healthy oriented items to their menu.  I believe I saw a Jerked Chicken Sandwich on Ciabatta, I will post another review after trying that.",0.9402,0.876,0.109,0.015,0.47185185185185186
