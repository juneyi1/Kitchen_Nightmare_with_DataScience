Alas, I could have TOTALLY passed on this dubious honor. What we had: Amuse Buchë--I can't rightly say WHAT it was... Polynesian Chopped Salad--Decent, as far as taste goes. Portion size, is another issue, altogether! Szechuan Blue Crab Cakes--Two small, somewhat dry cakes, no evidence of Hoisin or Szechuan flavor, at all... Roasted Halibut--This entree was laughable! There was a sweet pea purée, some friseè, and about a 2.5 oz. halibut fillet on a 10"" dinner plate. Korean-Style Fried Miller Farm Chicken--One (1) chicken thigh atop a 2"" diameter rice cake, topped with a tablespoon of coleslaw w/apple. Caramelized Banana Tiramisu w/Macadamia Nut Brittle--THIS was the best thing I had all night! It was approximately 3 oz., but about what I would expect as a dessert portion. The Macadamia Brittle was a standout! I must say that if we had not consumed several slices of the bread that was brought to the table, and drunk copious amounts of water, we would surely have needed to stop by Portillo's, or somewhere, on the way home!",0.8494,0.832,0.112,0.056,0.6597001763668431

We saw the bar area completely empty so we asked if we could just sit at the bar.  She said she'd have to check with her manager.  After leaving and coming back, she told us that a table opened up and that we could be seated in the dining room.   Seemed a little fishy to me.  So, this didn't start our dining experience off to a great start.   The place was nicely decorated but it seemed very stuffy.  It was so quiet in there that you felt you needed to whisper.  Our waiter was even quiet and would whisper when telling us about the menu and taking our order.   We ordered the Crab Cakes as an appetizer and they were very good as the other reviewers have mentioned.    I ordered the Salmon as a main dish and the water asked how I would like it prepared and he suggested medium so I went with that, but the Salmon seemed to be more rare than medium. It was a little too raw for my taste.  The apple tart pastry that came with it was good tho.  The presentation of the food was nice.   My friend ordered the halibut.  She said it was ok, but that she's had better.  Her presentation of the food was just average as well.  Her dish came with these noodle things that unfortunately looked like little magets so it wasn't that appealing.   We also split a side of the Truffle mashed potatoes and they were unfortunately really dry and not moist at all.   We didn't order dessert, but we were given little chocolate cupcakes that were on the house, but they were nothing special and were even a little dry.   The whole time we were there, the restaurant never filled up and there were so many open tables that it put a bad taste in our mouths that we were originally told that they were booked for the night.   When we got the check there was a note in there about an 18% gratuity added to our bill because we had a Groupon.  It was fine considering we usually tip 20% anyway, but it was just strange.  Overall, it felt like they weren't very inviting to Groupon users.  They probably shouldn't have offered one in the first place.   Our waiter overall was nice and attentive but he was a little on the weird side.   In a nutshell, it seemed to be just an average restaurant for being so upscale.  I can't say that I will ever go back.",0.9803,0.86,0.093,0.047,0.5195842836408874

The server who served our table was either on drugs so he did not know what he was doing, or he simply doesn't like his job. He should take an ENGLISH CLASS so he know how english should be spoken in this kind of setting, because I do not expect HIP-HOP style english in a fairly high-classy restaurant. Well I don't even know his name he did not introduce anything at all, all he said was that the five course is the five course designed by the chef (so u won't know what you will be eating, except he mentioned the 3rd course would be lamp). Other than that he barely says anything to us during the whole meal, except that I can smell his strong cologne whenever he passed by our table. Well, come on, I get way better service from Mcdonalds Burger King. You are kidding me if you are trying to sell a classy restaurant image, this is a joke because your server failed.  Or is it because I'm Asian so you guys don't think I should be eating in a classy restaurant?  PS: Food, if simply talking about the food, I would give it 1 star on my Cod fish (the halibut which i was going to order was ""no longer available""). 0.5 star was for the Chef who came out to say hello.

Zealous is my new go to spot and thanks Eddie for hailing a cab.  Very nice added touch.  There is a reason why Zealous has been open 19 year,0.958,0.807,0.163,0.03,0.5511769480519482

It made me wonder why it took so long to get back there. The food was beyond exquisite, the presentation...beautiful, and the service...attentive but not in you face. This is always a stop worth taking, and not just once in a while. The Zealous experience merits repeat!  For creatively intense vegetarian dining options, no one does it better than Chef Taus. This always makes my wife happy (who is always in search of new and distinctive tastes)! Chef Taus came out into the dining several times during the evening. He was very engaging and interested in his diners which to me is tells something of his passion and commitment to creating something wonderful (in food and atmosphere) for his diners. As for wines...not a better cellar around, and the pairings are done perfectly. I love my wine, but leave your own cellar selections at home. You don't need them here.

Postscript:  I got a call while driving a few minutes ago from the owner, Michael, who first thanked me for my review, and then started to complain that the review was inaccurate ... He went on to say that the reason the corkage fee is so high is because he doesn't want people to bring their own wine (so why target customers via Groupon?).   Then he told me he was 'saddened,' by the disrespectful review I posted, and that it would be better if I didn't return to Zealous.   I wonder if this guy Taus calls every bad reviewer to intimidate/shame them into removing a bad review?

He wanted to take me some place a little fancy and, I think, he wanted to trump his birthday dinner at Topolobampo. All I can say is ""well played."" Everything we had was wonderfully prepared. The vegetarian tasting menu is delicious. My husband was pleased as well. Though he opted only for a burger rather than the tasting menu, he thought it was amazing. It was delivered medium rare rather than medium, but he still thought it was really tasty and juicy. He really enjoyed his starter as well (something involving potato and octopus, I think). The desert was lovely and they personalized it for my birthday, which is very nice. Although it never seemed like any of the portions were large, when I left I was so full it was ridiculous.

It's not Zealous, it's Groupon. Place blame where it's due, people. That said....A LOVELY PLACE! The servers were VERY attentive, yet oddly, not *too* attentive, but just barely, AKA the perfect amount of attentiveness. I looked over my shoulder at one point, looking for the bathroom; someone was at our table lickety-split. Yet, we were given enough time between appetizer and main course, and they gave us breathing room between ordering the app and ordering the main course. We got the crab cake appetizer. I wasn't quite sure what to expect, it was great, soft and flakey where it needed to be, lovely flavor, and great presentation. I had the Cassoulet for a main course. The last time I'd had this, I was in the S of France (where the entree comes from) at a friend's wedding, catered by a professional chef the family knew. It was BETTER than the entree I had in France. I'm not saying the dish I had in France wasn't good, I'm saying this one was outstanding. My GF got the Australian Beef. The filet was amazingly cooked, the pork was oh so tender; it was in short perfect. We got some type of chocolate tort or something for dessert, which was also amazing.

Maybe I'd go back since the first time was absolutely amazing. the 2nd time when we had the tasting groupon it was a 2 star experience. Took us 25 minutes to get drinks from the time we sat. Service was polite but spotty and the food was mediocre for a regular price tag of $90 - I wouldn't pay the $45 dollars that we did actually pay for the groupon.  I thought it was stupid that Zealous didn't accept credit cards for our drinks and extras - not becoming of a high-end restaurant. Plus it didn't say that we couldn't use credit cards in the terms of the groupon. If Zealous can't take the credit card fees then don't give the deal.

The dishes were flat-out bland and unmemorable. They first served us an overcooked sablefish with a slaw that needed a kick to it. This dish was then followed by a not-so-bad duo of duck breast and a taco that seemed more like a spin-off of a vietnamese crepe. The duck was nicely done, but the taco had bones in them!!!!! The main course was a duo of under-seasoned short ribs and tenderloin with a rather bland gnocci. The chimichurri sauce smeared in the bowl (yes - the chef decided to serve a meat dish in a large, serving-sized bowl, which made it difficult to manage!) did not help the lack of flavor in this dish.

2011-12-04,3.0,"Great food, awkward, amateurish service, confused, suburban environment. A slowly dying concept which has lost it's artistic inspiration. It's hard to be fine dining when that niche is so saturated in Chicago. It's clear that you used to be really upscale, and now you have a good concept, but a lot of execution problems. Your decor wants to be so modern and minimalist, and then there's these random suburban touches like the blinking gaudy white plastic christmas tree and the Sinatra playing, Your staff is clearly all on their Very First Full Service Position. They've read the training manual, and are very nice and enthusiastic, but have no polish.  The slate trivet to put the amuse in is a very cute concept, but the way your staff clunks it down lopsidedly, halfway out of the hole, with a loud noise, ruins the whole ballet of it. Have them dine out at someplace like Tru once, where the menu is not nearly as thoughtful as yours, but the service is the epitome of polished. Silence and timing and all backwaiting hands on deck at the same time. All plates hit together, and WITHOUT a clunk. When your guest reminds you twice that they have an allergy to mushrooms and asks if it is possible for them to participate in the tasting menu, coming back and assuring them yes and then immediately presenting them with an amuse-bouche that is full of mushrooms is... yes, a bit of a faux pas on a slow Wednesday when your front waiter isn't exactly slammed.  Also, the lack of wine knowledge is atrocious. For one thing, $10.99 retail ($30ish/btl in-restaurant price down the street) Gruet is NOT a good, lovely, or elegant sparkling wine to start with. It is not like champagne just because it is made in method champenoise. It's, at best, a ""good value"" by-the-glass pour, and at worst, a terrible way to open a $45 wine pairing. That would buy me 5 whole glasses of $9 crap like that - how about do half-pours, because it's a tasting menu, and pour me something that would sell for $18 a glass? You could pour half glasses of some cheap actual champagne like moet imperial ($29 at binny's on sale! by the WHOLE glass for $18 at nacional 27 up the street!) and still make a plentiful margin on that. Gruet. Seriously. What a waste of money. Anyway. What was insulting was your waiters stuttering attempts to fake pretension over terrible wine. He was reading the back of the Veltliner bottle at the table. He couldn't at least have read it in the kitchen and memorized a few quick keywords on his way out? He then told me the Lan Rioja was ""from Crianza, Spain."" My date looked at me and deadpanned ""I've heard you've been to Crianza before. How's the weather?"" Why do I say I would reccomend this place, but I wouldn't go back? The food. The food is good, and some of the vegetarian concepts, namely the first course salad with masala crisps (please educate your servers on some good verbiage for how to describe masala, or send them back to the suburbs where they can explain to people who've never had masala before that it's ""kinda like a curry-thing."") are extremely exciting and outpace the meat option. I was very disappointed by the second course being ""vegetarian by subtraction"" - just not putting the duck on the plate - but all the designed-to-be-vegetarian courses were excellent. I would recommend the restaurant to anyone looking to take a vegetarian on a fancy date for some honest-to-god thoughtful, well designed food, warn them to buy some real wine and bring it themselves and pay the corkage fee, and expect inexperienced-but-trying-really-hard waitstaff to give an approximately suburban experience. Southern Wine and Spirits teaches a wine class most Mondays for industry people - I suggest sending your servers to it. Also, please get some real ice cubes. The big hunks. Check out Whistler or Violet Hour if you don't know what I'm talking about. Not the little chips. It's trendy, but you're trying to be trendy (from your mostly-minimalist-modern-bamboo-garden decor, anyway) so do it right. Or reconcept. Consider taking the table cloths off, lowering prices, and going in the Longman+Eagle direction, with stellar food and pub service. You'd probably make more profit. With the larger sections and higher resos that would get you, you could probably also retain better qualified FOH staff - jaded 30 year old industry hipsters who actually know their wine, rather than fresh-faced-I-was-a-busboy-until-last-month kids. I suppose everyone has to start somewhere, but that somewhere can also be, like, Big Bowl. You'd still need real ice cubes, though. Best of luck.",0.9968,0.762,0.153,0.086,0.48690917107583775

This place had a total of 15 people there on a Thursday night at 7PM. So (as a former server) I anticipated excellent service as the servers did not have many tables to juggle, however the service was inattentive and so off their game it actually may keep me away from the delicious food for a next visit. My parents decided they wanted the 5-course tasting menu and due to my gluten allergy (which they were accommodating towards) I could not have the tasting menu and ordered a la carte. While I am about having an experience with a meal and needing breaks between each course, this meal took 3 hours to eat!  Firstly, the server messed up the fact that my parents wanted the course menu not me, somehow he only brought out only ONE of the TWO tasting menu courses, so my mom had nothing to eat for the first 20 min. Though it was quickly resolved, it left a bad taste as that set the tone for the rest of the night.  My dad ordered a cup of coffee and it took a half an hour for him to get it! 15 min to get the cup and cream itself, then another 15 min for the coffee! And my dad only got his coffee after he had to ASK to have his cup filled.

2011-04-03,2.0,"My friend Cristin and I had the groupon for the 5 course tasting menu. The first course - Thai Bouillabaisse was really good.  The second course duck rilette and duck breast was not very good.  The duck rilette was extremely gamey and the duck breast was super rare.  I eat most of my meat rare or medium rare but this was very rare. The third course was the worst - pork loin and pork shoulder with spoon bread.  The pork loin was so tough I could barely eat it and the pork shoulder was dry and really strong tasting. The spoon bread was so dry it was not edible. I ate barely anything and I told the server that it wasn't very good and he said ""Oh maybe the next course would be better.""  The next course was a palate cleanser of lemon sorbet and cut up fruit - the sorbet was so so sour and how do you call that a course.  The desserts - banana tiramisu and some chocolate thing were OK but I didn't like them enough to even finish them.  The macaroon and a itty bitty chocolate cupcake at the end is delicious but hardly made up for the meal.    While we paid $40 for the Groupon I was certainly expecting a great meal and it almost felt like a throw away meal.

2011-03-28,5.0,"SP took me there this past weekend for my birthday and we had an excellent time. The food was great, the ambience was great and the service was great. There was nothing more we could've asked for.  This was our first time at the restaurant, and luckily, it was Chicago Chef Week so a tasting menu was availble for $33 per person. The tasting menu featured smaller portions of items that were available on the regular menu, so we didn't feel like we were missing out on the regular offerings. Being the gluttons that we are, however, we did add two additional appetizers and boy are we glad we did because they were the best parts of the meal.  The menu has a nice variation of seafood, meat and vegetarian options, each representing a unique take on American cuisine. The attention to detail is apparent in the sauces that accompanied not just each dish, but each item on the dish. This was especially true of the Duo Seared Sea Scallop, Braised Pork Belly and Parsnip Puree. This was our favorite appetizer and highly recommended to anyone who hasn't tried it before. The sea scallop was literally the largest scallop we've ever seen in our lives and it was encased in some sort of foam. The texture of the scallop was unbelievable. It was melt-in-your mouth creamy and decadent, and was unlike any other scallop we've ever eaten. The combination with the parsnip puree made it out of this world. The pork belly was scrumptious as well, cooked to perfection, and paired well with the scallop. The Cheese Assortment is also one that we really enjoyed, as each cheese was memorable and delicious. Be warned, however, that the pieces are a little on the small side, so that by itself as an appetizer might be disappointing. The rest of our tasting menu was very good as well, but the two appetizers described were the ones that truly stood out. The restaurant is known to have a notable wine list and we were happy to find affordable bottle options. Our server was very knowledgeable about the wines and with his help and knowledge of how each wine tasted, we were able to select one that we really enjoyed. One thing that both of us really liked about the restaurant was the decor and ambience. The space itself is very open and had an airy, lofty feel. The bamboo and skylights in the middle of the restaurant also gave it a very trendy but zen-like atmosphere. Candles spread throughout the restaurant provided a sultry atmosphere and centerpieces on each table again remind you of the attention to detail that is prevalent. The service was impeccable as well. The meal started off with an amuse bouche (carrot and maple butter gougierres that tasted they were filled with creamy cheese) and a delicious warm, moist, dense and chewy roll that is a recipe passed down from the chef's grandmother. The servers were not overly fawning but were instead, unobtrusively attentive and very personable. I was pleasantly surprised when my dessert came out with ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate on the plate, and again when two additional little tidbits (bite-sized chocolate cupcake and a mini raspberry pastry) were presented after dessert.  All in all, we had a great experience and recommend this place for foodies, couples, and anyone looking to impress.",0.9989,0.796,0.189,0.016,0.6348902295961119

The food is Asian fusion, so whenever the menu mentioned Korean or Thai inspired dishes, my friends were curious to try them out to see how close they were to authentic food.  (Sadly, there were no Filipino inspired anything, so I couldn't do that.)  The dishes all looked intriguing...so it was a little hard for me to choose.  In the end, I decided on the beef salad with the sausage and leek pancake (delish combo) and  the whitefish with cauliflower, beans and potatoes (wish there was more cauliflower, but tasty other than that!).  Dessert was the same for everyone - cheesecake and a chocolate cake.  This felt like a very ""grown-up"" meal and I was glad that we chose to come here - because, let's face it, I probably wouldn't come back here since it is pretty pricey.  Ahhh, dreams. BTW - If you come here to people watch, you will be confused.  It's a random mix of regulars, really affluent looking couples and...transplanted River Norther's.",0.9816,0.818,0.153,0.029,0.6716931216931217
2011-02-27,4.0,"We went to Zealous last week for Restaurant week and I have to say overall I liked it, but I don't know if I'll be back.   When we got there I felt like I had pulled into some back street and someone suddenly departed downtown magically in a half block.  It was very residental and we were able to park on the street directly across from the restaurant.  I don't imagine the valet offered gets an over-abundance of work here. We walked into the bar while we waiting a minute or two for our table to be prepared and we both loved the feeling of the restaurant.  Large and open with great decor and comfortable seating with the ability to sit down and not hear all of the conversation occurring next to you (a benefit or downside depending on your tendency to eavesdrop).   The restaurant week menu was generous and I chose the szichuan crab cakes for the first with the pork tenderloin and braised shoulder for the main course.  We also had a bottle of pinot grigio as well.  I will say the wine menu was extensive but I've decided not to look up the retail for our wine and depress myself seeing as how the Segura Cava Reserve bottle for $55 appears identical to the $7.99 bottles we purchased at Trader Joes a couple weeks ago. Our server was timely and service throughout was excellent and friendly.  I enjoyed my appetizer very much and my wife enjoyed her entire meal.  I think my one issue was that my appetizer happened to be larger than my main course.  The two tiny slices of a fraction of tenderloin and small cube of shoulder looked like they should be from the degustation menu.  I mean seriously tiny like three colored squiggles and a two peas on a plate in Demolition Man tiny.  It was literally smaller than any other course we were served except the amuse bouche. Aside from that the meal was very good with an amuse, 2 course, a pair of desserts, and a few tidbits with the check as well.  We would be back but at $150 with tip for two of us during restaurant week it fell into the special occasions budget and for special occasions we can get more for less elsewhere.  Overall though I wish I was rich enough to A. Live in that little residential enclace in the middle of the city and B, Afford to walk over and have dinner there regularly.  In that case I'm sure we'd be there all the time.  But until my numbers come in we'll have to keep exploring.",0.9979,0.775,0.194,0.031,0.41853521750580575

Both my husband and I were SO impressed on every level with this restaurant. The waitstaff was so incredibly attentive. Our water glass was kept full the entire time. The staff was friendly and the chef even brought out one of our courses. We had the vegetarian 5 course meal. My husband was just as into the food as I was. Every single course was delicious! MY only complaint is that there was too much food!  I was expecting the courses to be small plates of food, but they were each a pretty good size. So by the end of the meal I could barely take another bite. My favorite dish was the butternut squash soup. I also really loved these pancakes with sundried tomatoes and goat cheese. The dessert plate was heavenly. So overall, Zealous gets five stars from both my husband (who is incredibly picky so five stars from him says a lot) and myself. One thing I do want to mention is that we would typically never go somewhere for dinner that would cost $85 per person, but we went to Zealous because we had the Groupon.

Szechuan Blue Crab Cakes - it is only a ok. crab is fresh. however though the temperature is not warm enough. plus the interior temperature is so cold, the crab cake becomes ice cold half way we are through it.  entree: 1. Sesame Crusted Chilean Sea Bass - it is also a ok. for that price, i would expect it to be at least slightly better than your regular restaurant.  2. Seared Sea Scallops, Prince Edward Island Mussels, Potato Gnocchi & Puttanesca Ragout - the seared sea scallops are too raw, prince edward island mussles taste just like regular mussle. potato gnocchi is really so so, even those at olive garden taste better than this. overall, i think anyone can cook better than this.  dessert: 1. Brûléed Key-Lime Tart - this is even worst. brulee is too sweet while the key lime tart is hard as rock. even those key lime pie/tart i had on american airlines business class is way better than this.  conclusion: food is mediocre, i mean it's ok but then for the price i would expect at least slightly better than that. service has way too many room for improvement. i will never come back again.  good luck to those of you who decide to eat at this place.",0.9875,0.775,0.15,0.075,0.5338150738150738

It's just really gorgeous inside and you can see part of the expansive wine rack/closet from the dining room too. The food is also very good although portions are not large. I still left full though but not gross full, which is a good thing. One friend and I had the beef filet and the other had the pork chop. The pork chop was gorgeously plated, but tough and chewy (not in the good way). And the beans that accompanied it were cold and hard. On the beef, it was very nicely cooked and the mushroom lasagne was really, really good. I was very happy with my meal, even if it was a little light on the beef. For dessert, we split the key lime tart brulee with fresh berries and it was very refreshing and not heavy (thank goodness).  Here is where the meal took a bit of a turn. We went as part of the Groupon, which was treated as cash off the bill but any remaining balance had to be paid in cash. We were unaware of this before we arrived, leaving us to rotate out to an ATM once the bill arrived, which was pretty embarrassing but easy to resolve. Then, when getting cash at the bar, we could overhear the bartender and waiters gossiping and talking about patrons within earshot of the bar patrons, making my friend and our table wonder if they were separately talking about ours.

Same with restaurants, for me.  While Zealous was terrific in all regards, it just didn't have that 'oomph,' that indefinable something that made it zing.   I enjoyed it well enough while I was there, but in thinking about it in retrospect, it was... the sun slipping slowly beneath the horizon--like the end of most days--rather than a grand, riotous display of a glowing, fiery ball sinking into a tranquil, tropical sea.

My husband chose the 5-course tasting menu for $85 and I chose to order a few appetizers, since the server said that the vegetarian tasting menu I was considering had some of the appetizers on it but some of the dishes were made up on the fly.  Since we were at a new place, I wanted to know what I would be getting.  The amuse bouche was a carrot-ginger panna cotta with an agrodolce sauce--refreshing and nice.  Then, my husband and I split the gravlax flatbread.  The salmon was very nice, but the flatbread itself was rolled out unevenly so that one side was nice and crispy, but the other was too thick and hard.  The arugula, egg and caperberries were nice accompaniments, though nothing surprising.  I had a harvest apple cocktail, which was a nice match for the salmon.  My husband had a Sapphire martini with a twist that he said was made very well. The second dish was the cauliflower soup.  It was poured tableside over some garnishes, but the soup was so incredibly thick that it completely covered the pretty garnishes.  After eating the salty salmon, it was kind of hard to taste the soup because it was so subtle.  I really thought the soup was too thick, though it managed to be light at the same time, which was good. I tried the Polynesian chopped salad, which had a tasty lemongrass dressing.  I like my chopped salads to be a little more integrated--this salad has rather large pieces of red cabbage, some of which were hard to eat.  The hearts of palm were fresh and very good.  The fried shrimp that came with the dish were tasty, but unremarkable. Finally, I had the blue crab cakes with baby bok choy and soy mayo.  The crab cakes were just ok.  They were well-seasoned, but not crispy and I thought the crabmeat could have been of better quality, especially for $13 for 2 pretty small crabcakes.   My husband liked his diver scallop (biggest scallop I've ever seen in my life) and he said the duck breast was cooked very well, but that the little potatoes that came with it weren't crispy and fresh, as they probably should have been.  He said the beef tenderloin was pretty much cooked perfectly.  The sorbet that came with his meal had a terrifically smooth texture and intense flavor that was complemented by the subtle ginger syrup.  The fresh berries, however, were not the best pick for garnishes since they're out of season and don't have much flavor.  His duo of desserts included a dense Valrhona chocolate dessert that was a bit like a brownie, but I didn't catch what it really was.  That was ok, but I really liked the espresso sorbet that topped it due to the great, smooth texture.  It was called a sorbet but it was light-colored and a little bit creamy, so I was trying to figure out what else was in there.  The other dessert was a key lime cheesecake that was nice and tart and creamy.   Altogether, I felt that it was pretty expensive for the level of execution.  For that kind of money, I think I will dine elsewhere next time.  It was not bad, but just didn't wow me.  We met the chef on the way out and he was very nice.  I really wanted to like the food better, but unfortunately didn't.  Oh well, thank goodness there was a Groupon!",0.999,0.78,0.189,0.031,0.5746225595020776

Comfortable chairs and booths, high ceilings, and an almost zen-like garden surrounding a special VIP table. Finally a visible beautiful wine cellar to round out the smoothness that is Zealous. I will also note that the music was great, nothing like eating a fine meal listening to Bush, Phoenix, and some Talking Heads.    Service is top notch! From the hostess, to the manger and chef greeting us at the table to say enjoy and thanks for coming. Our waiter also gave great recommendations on food and wine pairings. As for the real reason why we bother to write these reviews... the food. It was a most certain 4 out of 5 stars for me. Everything from presentation, taste, texture, freshness, and even smell were all very very good. Somehow it was just missing that one little thing that tips the scale over to 5. They get points for making their menu seasonal and serving an amuse bouche at no cost is very class. Followed up by good broccoli soup, Miller Farm Chicken Breast (Confit Thigh, Paprikash, Farmer Cheese Pierogi & Sauerkraut Puree), Roasted Halibut (with Savory Cabbage, White Beans, Confit Fingerling Potatoes & Blood Orange Emulsion), and to finish it up with the Madagascar Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée with House-Made Cookies.

In terms of the food, I don't remember everything we got, but nothing stuck out as memorable.  The crab cake sandwiches were a bit bland - I think crab cake should not be paired with bread, but that might just be a personal preference.  I ordered the filet as my main course, and it was just very regular - nothing stood out about it, as it was just like many other beef filets I've had before.  Dessert was also plain.   Probably would not come back to this restaurant at this price point.  The food was decent - no complaints really, but just probably not worth the price you will pay.",0.4849,0.837,0.09,0.073,0.49351473922902483
2010-10-03,2.0,"My experience at Zealous last night was disappointing.  The space is beautiful and the tables are far enough from each other that it feels intimate even though the dining room is very large.  We arrived exactly 5 minutes after our reservation and were asked to wait at the bar.  After 10 minutes we were seated... it seemed like a ploy to make you order a cocktail, which I did.  The bartender used a different vodka than I had ordered, but not a big deal so I didn't send it back.  For the appetizer I had the lobster bisque and my date had the salmon flat bread.  The soup was flavorful and the tiny potato salad was a nice touch, but the temperature of the soup was lukewarm.  It was freezing outside and I was really looking forward to some HOT soup, so that was a major let down.  The salmon flat bread was outstanding.  For our entrees we had the braised oxtail with rigatoni and the 'signature' sea bass.  The braised oxtail was good but under seasoned.  It could have been great with the addition of some red pepper flakes and herbs.  The sea bass was also good, but not memorable enough to rave about. There are too many amazing high end dining establishments in Chicago to forgive failed execution at Zealous.  Our water glasses remained empty multiple times and our server was similar to the lobster bisque...lukewarm at best.  Oh, and the best part was the bottle of wine we ordered.  We ended up drinking much less than half of the bottle (since I felt compelled to order a cocktail after being forced into the bar) and the server never even mentioned it.  As probably most yelpers know, it is customary to at least ask the diners if they would like to take their wine with them...especially at high end establishments like Zealous that include $1000 bottles on their wine lists.  It's a little shady that our server never even mentioned it... or offered to fill our glasses before we left.",0.9929,0.807,0.155,0.038,0.44287819889860697

We were seated in the large table in the middle surrounded by plants, just under the skylight.  Overall the food was decent but not impressive. The menu felt uninspired, as if they just put together ingredients that are usually paired together. That's not to say the food wasn't properly prepared; it was, but no element made the dish stand out, or gave me some insight into the chefs style. The butter poached lobster with braised short rib appetizer, for example, was succulent and tender, but there was nothing special about it.  The flavors weren't memorable.  It was as if they wanted to put impressive ingredients on the menu, but didn't know how to lift it to a higher level. The duck flatbread appetizer, however, was one of my favorites of the night - good combination of flavors with the duck, cheese, and apples. The venison was just ok, not very flavorful, although it was cooked very well.  The vegetarian options were also mediocre, as were the desserts.  I did enjoy the mini chocolate cupcake we got as an amuse bouche, but it's kind of sad if that was one of the highlights of the meal.

I had ordered the lemon + basil martini.  I don't usually drink martinis and, since I'm a lightweight, was overpowered by it.  It was good, just incredibly strong and I wanted to be able to walk about of the place and wake up the next morning for work.  I sent it back for the rose wine, which was perfect especially with the entree. The service was spectacular!  And we received a complimentary plate of tiny desserts.  I wasn't a fan of the pecan cookies and, due to my girlfriend's allergies, she couldn't have them either; but the brownie-cupcakes were fantastic.

2010-08-29,4.0,"Thank goodness for Groupon - I never would have considered being able to afford this place without it. My girlfriend and I went here around 9 pm on a Saturday night. The decor is the modern minimalist with the incorporation of organic textures and colors (browns, grays, etc). They have a bamboo garden blocking off a more private party table in the middle - which is cool except you have to duck under the branches every time you walk by. Plus some of their plants are dying - they need to do some pruning. However, the wood ceiling with the beautiful skylight is awesome, and their huge glass wine ""cellar"" is also attractive.  The service was fantastic. The waiter was attentive, friendly, and helpful. My girlfriend ordered a citrus and basil martini, not realizing that it was going to taste like citrus and basil gasoline if you aren't used to drinking martinis. So even though there was nothing technically wrong with the drink, just that it was too strong for her liking, he was kind enough to replace it with a wine and not charge us. The food was also great. We decided to split several apps and an entree. Blue Crab Cake ""Sandwich"" with Dill Toast and Whole Grain Mustard-Tarragon Sauce - A little awkward to eat, but very flavorful. I felt some bites had a little too much dill, but for the most part it tasted quite good. It was well cooked. Duo Seared Sea Scallop, Braised Pork Belly and Sunchoke Puree - We ordered this because they were out of the lobster. Nothing mindblowing, and the scallop was just...okay. Not bad, but not terribly exciting either. Polynesian Chopped Salad of Romaine, Hearts of Palm, Panko Crusted Tiger Shrimp, Macadamia Nuts  - The shrimp served with this were FANTASTIC. Crunchy and flavorful. The salad was surprisingly large and had good flavor - lots of tasty macadamia nuts in there. I would have liked a few more hearts of palm. Also has some nice goat cheese crumbled on it. Tagliatelle Pasta with Braised Baby Goat Ragout, Artichokes, Olives, Tomatoes & Aged Goat Cheese - This was good. The goat had a nice flavor without overwhelming the dish. They were even kind enough to pre-split it for us, as we were sharing it. Fresh artichokes and high quality green olives. Good dish, well rounded in flavors. Sharing all of this between two hungry people left us full and we even had leftovers. At the end of the meal they brought out a complimentary dessert of two small pecan cookies and two small brownies. Free dessert?! Hell yeah.

Super high ceilings, big windows to let in lots of late afternoon light, has a very upscale feeling. The service was phenomenal. we were literally the first people in the door for dinner (@5 on a thursday) but we were still treated like we were VIP- which was great because we were using our first groupon and were unsure that we would be treated the same as the other early bird table who was paying in cash. Our server, whose name i cannot recall, was more than helpful offering suggestions and telling us what the weird plate with the whole in it at on the table was. (its where they place your first course, something i can't pronounce or spell but was very good).  The food was unexpected but in the best way.

We were seated in a room, with two large tables.  The chairs were spread far apart and felt a little too conference room like.  Soon, we shuffled and moved the chairs closer so we can chill.   Had to wait for a bit for for service, but our server was courteous.   Ahh the food.  We pretty much tried everything on the Chef's Week Menu, except the pork since most of my friends don't eat pork.   The amuse bouche was a piece of salmon rested over flavored mayo.   I tried the 'Vegetarian ""Taco-Dosa"" Cipollini Onions & Roasted Tomatoes with Blue Goat Cheese'.  The idea sounded interesting, but the execution was not what I expected.  The presentation was good, but the flavor was questionable.  There was a sauce with curry/spice flavors which overpowered the little filling in the Taco-dosa.  The taco-dosa itself was good on its own. I tried my friend's 'Blue Crab Cake ""Sandwich"" with Dill Toast and Whole Grain Mustard-Tarragon Sauce'.  I liked it, but wouldn't say it was amazing.  The tarragon and mustard overpowered the crab flavor.  The 'Mixed Baby Greens, Roasted Beets, Spiced Hazelnuts French Feta Cheese and Hazelnut Vinaigrette' wasn't all that memorable either.   I got the 'Eggplant Gâteau with Greek Style Green Beans, Petite Tomato and French Feta Cheese Salad'.  The Gâteau was an interesting twist on a Lasagna, cut into two small triangles served with cherry tomatoes.  I didn't love it, but it was OK.   I also tried a bit of the 'Grilled Beef Filet with Mushroom-Potato Lasagne, Honey Glazed Carrots & Red Wine Reduction'. The beef was so so, but I loved the small portion of Mushroom-Potato Lasagna.  As the server informed us, at Zealous, medium well is really medium rare elsewhere.   We also ordered a side of fries, which sounded really good.  And it was.  Sad to say, this was the best thing we ate that night.  It came with a mayo with Horse Raddish and Mustard, which was a very good accompaniment.   There was a long pause before the dessert arrived.  The dessert was a small piece of cheesecake and a bread pudding.  The bread pudding was a bit dry and cheesecake was, well just cheesecake.     The real surprise was the final amuse bouche.  It was small chocolate cupcake with a devilish chocolate frosting.   The place has an extensive collection of wines and a few by the glass.   The small portion size is a probably because of the Chef's Week menu ($30).  But I can't say the flavors of the dishes I tried would make me want to go back there again.  I wouldn't write it off completely, but Zealous wouldn't be on my top list of restaurants either.",0.9972,0.787,0.178,0.035,0.513034632034632

2010-03-27,2.0,"Here is a copy of my complaint that I emailed to the restaurant over a week ago WITHOUT a response...no meak apology, no email back saying thank you for your insight, nothing... To whom it may concern:                                                                         My boyfriend and I ate at your establishment last night, Friday March 19, 2010. We were very excited given the excellent reviews however we left extremely disenchanted.                                    We were promptly seated at 7:23pm but with no menus. We sat conversing with each other wondering where are menus were for a good 10minutes before a server brought them and asked what we would like to drink. Another 15 minutes later our 2 drinks were finally brought out but our server did not even ask what we wanted for appetizers or even explain what the soup of the day was. We had to ask another server if we could please order. We were planning on meeting friends after dinner and we were on a modest time constraint of 9pm which we notified our server about.                                      Given that it took so long to get our drinks we did not think we would have time to get appetizers so we forwent them and went straight for the entree. My boyfriend had the sea bass and I the Amish chicken. We were not served until 8: 34pm ( I had been looking at my watch because of our time constraint).  Our entrees were very good but the service was less than attentive. We had to ask AGAIN for our waiter to bring our check. We had to forgo desert because we knew there would not be enough time.                                 I really would've liked to speak to the manager at that time but no one was in sight. As we left, no hostess or waiter even bothered to blink an eye as if to say, ""thank you for dinning with us"".                               Overall this was a very disappointing experience. All we had were 2 drinks and 2 appetizers and we were at the restaurant until 9:15pm. The restaurant was not overly crowded but we sure left feeling under appreciated and unimportant.

2010-03-21,2.0,"Two words:not impressed.  The good thing about this place was that it was easy to find street parking - literally across the street. We checked in with the hostess who brought us to our table and left us right away, before we were seated and with no menus.  Strange, maybe this is how this place operates... We got seated and one of the waiters brought us our menus.  I scanned the cocktail list and ordered the sparking z (it was a hard decision with the lychee martini glaringly at me but i wanted something sparkly and fruity).  Sparking z was perfect for what I wanted but it felt light on the alchohol cuz I finished it quite easily.  For appetizers we ordered the crabcake sandwich and seared scallop. Portions were quite small. Yes, fancy restaurants give smaller portions because of the quality of the food but I wish they could spare a bit more.  Crabcake sandwich was good but crabcake was size of a half dollar.  Seared scallop....yes, singular, you get 1, was nothing special. Paired with the scallop is a thick slice of roast pork meat - eh, reminds me of the chinese roast pork without the crispy skin so whats the point? For entrees, BF ordered the ribeye and I ordered the sesame crusted sea bass that people have mentioned on yelp.  Ribeye was good, cooked exactly as requested and the spinach and fried potato sides were quite tasty.  However, I was less than impressed with my entree.  Presentation wise it wins some points with black and white sesame over the fish with rice noodles and red coconut curry.  However, in tasting the dish, it left me wondering what was so contemporary american about it? Is it not just a fancy (smaller portion)version of a rice noodle dish I can find at a thai restaurant, which would provide me with triple the portion size with a much better curry? The fish was not that great - low on flavor, high on sesame. Same two words: not impressed.  Amazingly, BF and I were both stuffed without finishing our entrees so asked our server to pack the remainders (probably doesn't happen often).  We scanned the dessert menu but nothing stood out and we decided to just call it a night.  We paid our bill and were about to leave when we realized we never got our to-go bags!  Took awhile to get our server back to our table so he could get us our to-go bags.  He apologized and said he forgot and went to get them. He returned with two boxes and no bags.  Seriously, people must not take anything to go because they don't offer bags.  We felt really contemporary american walking out with two boxes in our hands.   Thank you Groupon special but we will not be coming back.  If you're comparing this place with Spring, definitely choose Spring.",0.9938,0.837,0.124,0.039,0.4357298136645963

2010-02-19,2.0,"This review is for restaurant week. We were greeted by an apologetic hostess who said that there would be a twenty minute wait despite our reservation that we had made a month in advance.  We had also noted a special occasion when making our reservation and no mention of this was made during the experience.  Also during the meal, the chef came over and talked to the patrons at every single table on our side of the restaurant except for us!  This seemed a little odd to say the least... The decor in the restaurant is very modern and it is an aesthetically lovely place to spend the evening. The restaurant week menu included a variety of interesting options and our server happily answered my questions. We were served an amuse bouche to start off, which was a mango gel with red bell pepper salsa and lime.  This seemed to be a very strange amuse to me and would have done better as a dessert amuse as it was very sweet and tart (not a great start!) For our appetizers we had the crab cake sandwich and the vegetarian dosas.  The crab cake was amazing and had a rich mustard tarragon sauce.  The dosas were interesting and provided a light start to the meal. For our entrees we had the gemelli pasta with rock shrimp and red curry sauce and the sea bass.  The sea bass was perfectly prepared with a sesame crust.  It was served with vegetables and pan fried noodles that were tasty, but the dish was not amazing.  The pasta was completely lacking in flavor and was a big disappointment.  I think was an excellent example of ""fusion"" cuisine gone wrong--it just wound up tasting bland and like nothing at all. The desserts were a ""surprise"" and we saw several different versions served across the restaurant.  We were presented with a duo of a key lime tart and a banana tiramisu.  The tart was light and refreshing, but the tiramisu had a flavor that was definitely off.

Since he actually did a stint early in his life in some of Devon's Indian restaurants, he understands Indian spices and flavors - something that is almost lacking in Zealous' ""normal"" menu.  He also understands vegetarian food.

2009-12-18,2.0,"I've had this place on my list since it pretty much opened, but never got around to visiting until a Groupon offer finally pushed me to give it a try. After reading mixed Yelp reviews, I was a little concerned but tried to keep an open mind. Unfortunately, after our experience I'd have to agree with the mediocre reviews--it seems that we must've missed their heyday by about 7 years.  I would have given this place at least a 3 for the food if the terribly lackluster service hadn't been such a drag on our overall experience. We had reservations at 7 the day after Thanksgiving. When we arrived, we were seated right away by a friendly enough hostess. (The dining room was maybe 1/4 full and only 1 or 2 new tables came in during the course of our entire meal.) That was pretty much the high point of our service experience. After we were seated, she left us with a wine menu but no dinner menus. Not a big problem, we thought maybe that was left to our server. A few mins later a woman who we thought was going to be our waitress stopped by, but she just brusquely asked if we wanted water (in fact, I think her exact words were ""Do you want water?"") After she filled us up (literally, if not figuratively...) we were left sitting there for about 5 loong minutes. A waiter stopped at the table next to ours to get their orders but didn't even glance over at us (granted, that couple also looked like they'd be waiting for awhile). After a few more mins (and a 2nd tour to our neighbors' table), he stopped by and asked if we had decided on what we'd like to drink---no mention of the menu. My husband ordered a glass of wine and the waiter just left...When he came back w/ the wine STILL sans menu, my husband finally had to ask for them point blank. The waiter went to get them but didn't even offer an apology. Once we finally had them in hand, we saw that the menu offers a la carte dishes as well as some tasting menu options. Our waiter didn't even bother explaining or mentioning the tastings...I had to, again, specifically ask for more information. We ended up ordering a la carte and shared the Tuna Tartare and Scallops w/ Pork Belly appetizers. Both were pretty tasty, although the blinis that came w/ the tartar were kind of an odd pairing (the dish really needed some contrasting textures) and some of ours weren't completely cooked so we were biting into raw, mushy dough. Not good. For entrees, I had the venison and my husband had the beef filet. The entrees were pretty decent but nothing to write about. They needed a  little more punch or flavor--SOMETHING to make it stand out.... For dessert I tried the ""coconut tour"" which was basically coconut flavored panna cotta w/ (really undercooked) tapioca balls and a huge mess of funnel cake on top. Another odd combination...(There was also a really long delay between when we were given the menu and when the waiter finally came back to take our order). Others have mentioned the extensive wine selection. The wine room is pretty impressive, although oddly enough our waiter didn't know the proper pronunciation for Gruner Veltliner. I'm not trying to be a snob pointing this out...I wouldn't have known myself except that I happened to have recently read an article about this wine, but if you ARE trying to promote yourself as having a notable wine list above and beyond the average restaurant's, at least make sure your staff can properly represent that (and also maybe have someone double check the spellings on the wine menu...). The restaurant space itself is really beautiful and has a lot of character. I think that's probably the best thing going for this place. It's sad to see how a restaurant that opened to some fan fare several years ago has dwindled to this. I'm actually surprised they've managed to stay in business....Unfortunately, there really isn't anything that would entice us to go back.",0.9915,0.824,0.116,0.06,0.45814400530025523

2009-12-01,3.0,"Like many of the most recent reviewers, I came to Zealous because of the Groupon. I work in the area and I had wanted to try this restaurant for a while. I had noticed that they had a 5 course tasting vegetarian menu, which led me to believe that this would be a relatively vegan-friendly restaurant. As a vegan, solid fine dining experiences can be few and far between (with some exceptions).  When I called and made my reservation, they said it would be no problem to accommodate my diet. Perhaps I'm living in a fantasy land, but I was hoping that would mean I would have more than one choice for my dinner option. This was not the case, so I decided to have the chef create a five course vegan tasting menu so I could at least get some variety. My boyfriend went with the vegetarian five course menu.  Things started on a relatively good note. The amuse bouche and the first course were delicious. We were also able to get a decent bottle of Pinot Noir for $35. The salad course was great, though nothing too exciting. The let down here was the main course: root vegetables cooked in parchment paper. It was so bland. I was desperate for some salt or really any seasoning. There were also two dessert courses that were fine, but the vegan options seemed like an afterthought.  All that being said, my vegetarian boyfriend really liked his food. If you are vegan, probably better to invest your money elsewhere.",0.9865,0.803,0.159,0.037,0.5295405982905984

When seated, we were asked for water preferences.  I asked for sparkling, but my friend wasn't even noticed.  I needed to call the first line server back to get his still water as he wished.  Not an issue, just not expected at a restaurant as such.

The food however was sub par.  Everything on the menu sounded appealing and amazing.  It took forever to decide.  We started with two appetizers.  The veal sweetbreads and the scallop aside porkbelly.  The sweetbreads were tasteless.  There was no flavor at all.  I've never experienced such bland sweetbreads.  This was common amongst all the dishes, except the scallop and porkbelly.  Of course the porkbelly is naturally flavorful. For our meals: I ordered the venison loin with apple pierogis and I believe it was supposed to be a caramelized sauerkraut.  I don't even think it was put on the dish.  The Venison also did not have any flavor.  There was a pomegranite foam ontop, it didn't serve as much flavoring at all.  The pierogis were also hard on the outside. My friend had the Chilean Sea bass which he heard so much about.  He gave me a piece.  It was well cooked.  The naturally buttery and soft flavor was present, however it was interrupted by the crunchy sesame seed crust rested amongst the top of the filet.   The noodles which accompanied the fish were very good I must add.  They reminded me of the wide noodles which are often served with the thai dish Pad-see-ewe. The portions are the right size.  They leave you feeling comfortable and not stuffed.  The dishes were served asthetically beautiful.  It made the food taste a lot better. When the bill was received, the waiter gave us a couple petite fours.  They were pleasantly soft, fresh and not too rich.  A perfect end to a not so perfect meal. Now the big question...

We made a reservation for around 6:30 pm, which was fairly early for dinner at the restaurant. I don't think they started getting busier until we were finished with our meal. Be forewarned that this is not a cheap dinner! The food is a bit overpriced for the portions, but I guess it's expected from a more upscale dining venue. But I did expect a bit more food! At least the decor and service made up for it! The decor is gorgeous with just the right amount of lighting for a romantic dinner! It's a good place to take a date! I loved the service and since we were meeting up with some friends for some more food afterwards, they were nice enough to allow us to share a few dishes without an extra cost at splitting plates! Of course, we ordered a reasonable amount of food for all of us!

The first time, I remember loving it: I had some kind of great steak entree of which I've since forgotten the name. The second time, I still loved it.  The groupon made it super-affordable.  I went on a Tuesday night at 8pm, so I expected it to be a little empty, but we were literally the only people there.  The wait staff was really nice--seated us in a nice semi-private area, so I never felt like they were hovering.  Amuse: Free cream puff!  Tasty. App: Mango pancakes with foie gras for me, cheese for the Mr.  Omg the mango pancakes were AMAZING.  Smallish portion, but worth every penny.  Every bite with an explosion of delight.  GET IT.  I may or may not be drooling while writing this review. Entree: I had the surf and turf, and Mr. Me had the Chilean sea bass.  We both got tired of our entrees before we were done.  Mine didn't strike me as anything special--fried fish and not-very-interesting short rib.

2009-11-17,3.0,"Let me set the scene: it's a Tuesday night at a AAA rated 4-star restaurant and there's only 2 other tables in the main dining room. The space has beautiful skylights, bamboo garden area and lots of cushioned, elegant, purple seating.  When I arrive with my trusty brother/dining partner in tow, we wait patiently at the hostess stand...there's no hostess. A server's assistant comes by and seats us. We wait patiently for a waiter. We see him and he is gone. This pretty much the rule of thumb for the evening. There was a larger party in the private dining room, but my biggest impression from this elegant 10 yr. old establishment is that the service was not of a particular 4-diamond caliber. Aside from the ho hum service the food was good. There were a few things I oohed and aahed over though. I LOVED my seasonal soup, a cauliflower so smooth it was almost like a sauce. Almonds added a lovely smokey compliment as did the duck rounds. I opted for the beef medallions which didn't require a steak knife (good thing too because the not so friendly server's assistant informed me there are none at the restaurant) which had a lovely potato ""lasagna"" with mushrooms. Wine list was very impressive as was the selection of teas. The coffee sadly was Starbucks so no big whoop there. The desserts looked lovely and were larger portions, but the little one-bite desserts presented before the check were all I needed to cleanse my pallet. I can't say that I'll be going back to Zealous. The food was good and the space was attractive but nothing stuck with me calling me back for a second helping.",0.9956,0.743,0.218,0.039,0.5602150537634408

I was so tired of asking that I was about to just stick it under my chair or the table, but finally they brought me one. The atmosphere was typical for this kind of restaurant. We had to be toned down and not be in our usual boisterous craziness mode. I ordered the 5 course with no wine pairing. Each dish I got was okay. I wasn't blown away by any of it. The scallop was so so, I've definitely had better. The duck was okay, not a big fan of it because it's so fatty and unhealthy, but it was decent. The short rib and filet were good too. I've given up red meat almost completely and I'll eat it at rare occasions, but this was just okay to me. The sorbet was good and dessert was good. My boyfriend got the sea bass off the menu which was pretty good as well.

2009-11-09,4.0,"Like others, we decided to try this place because of the Groupon deal. I would give it 5 stars because the food was amazing but will go with 4 for two reasons:  1) For the menu pricing, the decor of the restaurant needs some work. While cute and cozy, the bamboo in the middle of the restaurant looks like it is dying. The centerpieces at the tables are little square vases that are filled with black glass gems and a single yellow flower. I didn't really get the color motif they were going for since their furniture was more of a purple theme. The black glass gems looked like boba and was actually kind of ugly. Maybe this is because I'm from LA but I definitely would expect more from decor/ambiance for the prices you pay. 2) The wine list while being extensive is majorly overpriced. There were bottles that were triple the price. We would have been okay with double the price but triple the price at a restaurant with that sort of ambiance (refer to point #1 above) seemed a little absurd. So, we ordered Grey Goose martinis instead which were $12 each and perfectly made. Now for the fun part, the food! Appetizers: + Duo Seared Sea Scallop -Braised Pork Belly and Sunchoke Puree: Scallop was perfectly seared and pork belly melted in our mouths. If you're not a big pork belly fan, do not get this dish because it is one serious piece of delicious, yummy fat.  + Yellowfin Tuna Tartare + Avacado Mousse + Caviar: Perfect combination and tasted wonderful but could use more of the little pancake things.. they only gave us 3.  Entrees: + Sesame Crusted Chilean Sea Bass with Pan-Fried Rice Noodles and Red Coconut Curry Sauce: Fish was perfectly cooked and was perfectly flaky and fresh. I asked for the red curry sauce on the side just in case I didn't like it but it was not too strong or overpowering. I didn't use too much of the sauce though because there was so much flavor in the noodles already that went well with the fish. + Seared Duck Breast with Shiitake Mushroom-Confit Mushu and Hoisin Glaze: So good! There were 2 pieces of seared duck breast with 2 wraps of the chef's version of peking duck. Duck breasts were tender, moist and they were perfectly cooked. Dessert: + Caramelized Banana Tiramisu with Macadamia Nut Brittle Crust and Chocolate Biscotti: YUM! The macadamia nut brittle crust was a good contrast to the soft tiramisu. Beware, if you like sweet desserts, this one is not for you though. Food was superb! Loved every course and everything I had.",0.9988,0.755,0.223,0.022,0.565966386554622
2009-11-08,2.0,"I'm always a little stumped when I come home from a restaurant and I find glowing reviews when I found the restaurant positively inadequate.  Were we at the same restaurant?  Do we just have different expectations? Like my food having any flavor?  Like many above me I had the $75 for $35 Groupon which is what inspired me to try this restaurant.  It's located on a rather deserted stretch of Superior, no problems parking here.  We were eating early so I wasn't surprised that we were among the 1st patrons of the evening but I was a little surprised on a Sat.night that the restaurant was about 3/4 empty when we left at 7pm. The complimentary rolls with sweet potato butter and balsamic reduction were bland, bland, bland.  Even the butter had no flavor.  We started off with the white pizza with Rock Shrimp, Fresh Ricotta, Mozzarella, Lemon Zest and Arugula  ($12).  It had an interesting flavor but was rather heavy on the cheese and very light on the shrimp.   I don't think appetizers are meant to be shared although this one was large enough for the both of us. My entree was the Hot Pot of Grilled Cobia, Maine Lobster, Shrimp Dumplings and Warm Yuzu Ponzu  ($32).  Even when I was ordering it I wondered if it was a mistake, it sounded delicious on paper but sometimes you just know that you shouldn't order something.   Sure enough, when it was placed in front of me, I was shocked at the small portion size for the price but it might have been OK if it tasted good.  But it didn't, it was SO bland, I was desperately searching the room for a salt shaker which of course a restaurant with this level of pretension wouldn't have.  I was really glad that the chef, who had stopped by the table next to ours to see how their meal was, didn't stop by ours because what could I possibly say to him?   My husband had the Prime 16 oz. Rib-Eye with Creamed Spinach Gratin and Truffle Potato Croquettes  ($39).  That was very flavorful but really in a city where we have some of the best steakhouses in the country I don't see coming back here for that.  We passed on dessert, I felt like I had already invested enough in this experience. The service was a little snooty at first and the interior of the restaurant is oh so trendy New York wannabe.  No return visit is in the cards for me!",0.9852,0.791,0.134,0.075,0.5587318121693121

2009-10-05,4.0,"I had never heard of this place until they showed up on Groupon, and I'm very glad they did! My wife and I came here for my birthday on Saturday. The clientele is an interesting mix of senior citzens, young hipsters and business people. We arrived at 7:30, but the dining room didn't fill up until almost 9, making me feel like I was back in Spain.  We ordered the five course vegetarian menu with wine pairings and added an optional cheese course too. The wine selections were perfection and complimented each course exquisitely. I was especially surprised by the Sauvignon Blanc, a varietal that I rarely enjoy,  but it was perfectly balanced and really made the squash soup it was paired with shine. Next, we were treated to a little Mediterranean influence with some stuffed grape leaves and beet salad, followed by a lasagna/spanikopita type creation, all of which were wonderful. Cheese, sorbet and dessert rounded out the evening with a surprise mini cupcake and chocolate at the end for a journey of flavors from savory to sweet to heavy to light. The pacing between each course was also spot-on. It would be difficult to leave this place without a smile on your face. The reasons for not going five stars are all front of house related. The front door could use some repairs (and has probably gotten them already) because it had nearly fused itself shut and guests frequently had to be helped through by each other or the Maitre d'. Our waiter was not always at our table when we were served each course (never a good idea), so we didn't always get the chef's description of what the course was. Riedel makes little tiny water glasses. If you're going to use these, be sure the wait staff checks them frequently, or your guests will have empty glasses, as I often did during the meal. Also, just one piece of bread? Why not keep my bread plate full, or match a bread with each course? We had enough butter for half a dozen rolls. I definitely recommend Zealous. Despite a few kinks in service, the quality coming out of the kitchen easily overcomes them. I look forward to going back.",0.9933,0.824,0.144,0.032,0.5136437908496733
2009-09-26,4.0,"Let me just start by saying that the food here deserves 5 stars.  I have to knock off a star though because I'm a little bitter.  It's funny how one little thing can tarnish an evening.  Let me explain... We dined at Zealous at around 8:00pm on a Saturday night.  I noticed that we were the youngest couple there by about 20 years (we're in our 30's).  No biggie.  Our food was outstanding.  The part that really still bugs me is that the manager went around to check on every single other table in the restaurant except for ours (and there weren't that many that were occupied).  Yeah, I know, probably just an oversight, right?  Nope, he looked over at us, and veered right to the table seated next to us.  I really can't explain why I'm so annoyed by that, but it made me feel like when I was a teenager shopping in Saks...like I wasn't worthy.  F that.   Anyhow.  They don't do specialty cocktails at this place, which is kind of disappointing.  I think they count on people ordering bottles of wine.  My martini was ok, but wine is probably your best bet here. I started with the mango short stack with foie gras.  It was an excellent dish with an unexpected combination of flavors that totally worked.  Mango, onions, foie gras...all delicious.  I loved it.  My bf had the yellowfin tartar.  It was light and refreshing. For the main course, I had the venison and the bf had the filet.  My venison was perfectly prepared and had an excellent taste.  The sauerkraut puree was a nice compliment and the apple dumplings were a good contrast.  The filet was a bit overcooked and dry, but the mushroom lasagna that accompanied it was delicious, although very rich. We decided not to stick around for dessert.  Our service was very good and the food was excellent.  I would probably go back if I felt like a valued guest, but I didn't, so I probably won't.",0.9974,0.741,0.221,0.039,0.6572117794486217
2009-09-23,3.0,"I dined at Zealous with my wife this past Saturday, the 19th.  This was my wife's birthday and we were looking for a new place to try.  After viewing the menu online, we landed on Zealous.  We made  reservatinos for 7:00 pm on a Saturday night, expecting the place to be packed.  When we arrived, I think there were maybe four tables at most.  It may have got up to 9 tables at the peak of our meal. Anyway....the food.  The food was OK.  I've been to a lot of restaurants in Chicago and have a lot to compare to.  However, I tend to rate based on my perceived value.  For example, I may rate a $5 taco joint over say Charlie Trotter's just because the food was amazing for the value. Based on that, I think Zealous is overpriced.  The food was good, but not great, and I've certainly had better at that price point. I had the mango pancakes with foie gras.  Good, but not out of this world.  It's also an $18 appetizer.  I also had the venison loin, which again was good, but certainly not the best I've ever had.  This was $34.  It was cooked perfectly, but it came with apple dumplings which tasted like mini apple turnovers.  A little to swee for my taste.  It also had a lavendar foam on top, with a saurkraut puree.  Weird combo that didn't work for me. My wife had the white pizza appetizer which was good, but boring.  She had the sea bass which was again cooked very well....just a little underwhelming. For dessert we had some kind of cheesecake (it's slipping my mind at the moment) with berries backed into a pastry.  The center of the pastry was frozen, which was dissapointing. We left full and happy, but just a little underwhelmed.  This place has the potential to be great, but something's missing.

2009-09-12,2.0,"It semi pains me to give this place two stars, for two reasons. First of all, a part of me thinks it deserves three stars. Second of all, another part of me thinks it deserves one. First, the bad: the service. was. awful. I mean, not even remotely good. We were seated, and were pushed in to a cocktail right away (with no menu, etc)... which is fine. And from then on, we were forced to wait. And wait. Wait for our drinks, then wait to have our order taken.... and even wait to get our bread (even after my girlfriend informed the waiter that she was starving and just wanted a piece of bread). On top of the waiting, the server was just plain amateurish. His demeanor was more fitting for a pub than a restaurant that proceeded to drain $200 from my pocket. And I quote: ""sir, how are you enjoying the uh... uh... what are you having again?"". My water glass sat empty for half the meal (I finally had to ask for a refill), and the waiter completely forgot about our side of truffled mashed potatoes (which he proceeded to pretend that he of course remembered, and then brought out when we were 3/4 done with our meal). NOW just to be clear I'm not especially demanding about my service: I want water, I want the waiter to remember my sides, and I want him not to slap me on the shoulder after recommending a dish.  He also came over and basically forced my date to wolf down her amuse bouche before she was ready (the item was still on her plate when he proceeded to ask if he could take her plate -- she kind of hesitated, to which he responded ""come on, it's one bite""). To put this all in context, this was a Friday night, and the restaurant was *maybe* 50% full. They're obviously not ready for prime time. That being said, the food was good. Not great, but good. The foie gras app was decent -- but the foie was a bit overcooked in parts, and ... kind of bland. The crab cake app was very dill heavy, but tasty. The surf 'n turf was great 'n bad. The short rib was excellent, and the ""crispy skate wing"" was really ""deep fried bland skate wing"". I had the prime rib eye, which I'd say was the highlight of the meal. The steak was cooked perfectly, the demi-glace was very good, and the deep fried truffled mash bits were excellent (though not the classiest accompaniment).  We also got a side of the truffled mashed potatoes... which were very good (despite coming out when we were practically done with our meal).  So, the food was good -- but for these prices, I want to be wowed. The execution here was ok, the creativity was essentially non-existent, and the service needs a whole lot of work. This place charges top dollar (nearly), and there's no way I can justify eating here over any similarly priced establishment.",0.9285,0.815,0.103,0.082,0.567825543797766

OK - I do want to mention one odd thing, the food runner/front of the house person sort of made me feel like I was in Soviet Russia... she didn't speak to us, just militantly took our dishes away without a smile. It was... interesting. From here on out i will refer to her as Svetlana. But OK - enough about that, onto the big enchilada, the food.  We started with an amuse bouche, a Gruyere and carmelized onion tart, which was scrumptious, and the perfect one-bite size.  We decided to go with the 5-course tasting menu, it was our anniversary after all.  The first course was a seared scallop on top of sweet corn puree and chopped heirloom tomatoes.  It was a delight.  I asked Svetlana for more bread to soak up the sweet corn puree (alright, I know, not the best manners in the word, but it was just so GOOD! - it might have been imagined but i swear i could see her eyes saying ""Pshh, americans"") The next course was a delightful Veal ravioli.  Svetlana sort of muttered the components, unfortch, so I can't recount them here.  The texture was just really interesting, and they really were excellent.  They had some sort of compote on top of them, something perhaps with nuts and tomatoes.  Anyway, I could have stabbed my fork into both of them at the same time and been done with the whole thing, but i minded my manners and savored them slowly.  The next course was the steak course, now OK. i LOVE steak.  I could sleep on a slab of meat every night and feel good about it.  This steak was pretty awesome.  Cooked Medium Rare, some good saucy stuff around it, roasted carrots, the all American meal. EXCEPT... these ""truffle potato fritters"" they brought out.  You guys, i drive buy a popeyes everyday on my way home from work, if i want a friend ball of potatoes, i'll stop for some, I don't except that on my plate of $29 meat.  Really, these tasted like something i'd get in my $3.99 value meal. I would have much rather had truffled mashed potatoes. Ok - enough about the potatoes. The next course was palate cleansing lemon sorbet, which was a nice, tart treat.  Then the dessert... keylime tart and a small piece of cheesecake. As a girl who likes variety, i like that they gave us 2 mini desserts to savor.  I sort of wish someone would have offered me coffee, but i mean, that's really more my fault for not demanding that Svetlana bring me some (I was just so INTIMIDATED!)  We ended up spending $160 after tax and tip, and our $75 groupon taken out.  Pretty much what I expected for choosing the 5-course menu.  I really think they have something good going on down there, and hopefully Groupon will get them the business they need to stay alive.",0.9987,0.766,0.2,0.034,0.4489953388762912

Zealous is an anomaly in that everything in the place, except for its semi-limited bar selection, is to the nines.  The wine menu looked overwhelming but the actual booze at the bar seemed a bit skint.  Back to the anomaly, this is by far one of the nicest restaurants, aesthetically, in all of Chicago.  The central table covered by bamboo is really quite awesome.  The wine room/upstairs cellar makes me want to get drunk and it is obvious that every aspect of the place had considerable thought put into it.  Which is why it is so strange that more people haven't caught on to it and even more strange that we were the only ones in there on what should be one of their busiest nights. Now, to the food I got the oxtail tacos to start, which were cooked perfectly and had some really nice flavor.  The rest of the table had some scallops, sweet breads and some sort of salad.  Sweet breads were tasty but when isn't brain tasty?  For the main course I went with the Duck, totally awesome, the moo shu type wraps the veggies came in would have been better as more moo shu and less tortilla.  The lady had the Sea Bass which was advertised by the waiter as the house specialty, it was good but would have been better without the crusting of panko or whatever it was, the flat noodles underneath it were great.  Not sure what everyone else had but it looked good and there were no complaints. Dessert was passed on by most but what did come looked pretty tasty. Zealous, would have other jealous, if anyone ever came by. RrL",0.9938,0.757,0.179,0.064,0.5663020163020165

2008-03-14,4.0,"I had dinner here last night and really enjoyed it! I agree with the other reviews. Why aren't there more people in this restaurant? We must have been one of three parties there. But then again, it was 7:30 on a Thursday night.  The decor is simple, contemporary and very comfortable. I loved the timber loft ceiling contrasting with the elegant white linens and baby tulips at each table. The music was great, but could have been louder due to lack of patrons. They have a fabulous wine cellar in the back. Best of all, the tables are pretty well seperated. I hate it when tables are cramped!  I started with a Tanqueray and soda (I'm trying really hard to be good) and my friend had a whiskey and ginger ale. Drinks were strong - very tasty! For dinner I had the venison. It came with fingerling potatoes and cooked apples. I'm quite picky when it comes to eating meat and venison always has to be cooked just right. I got it medium-rare and it was perfect! I thought the portion sizes were just right! My friend got the filet mignon. He ordered it medium, but it looked more like medium rare. It was very good as well. After dinner our server brought us some petit fours - the chocolate cupcake is fantastic as well as the raspberry jelly thing.  Service was very good and our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and offerings.  Zealous is a great place for a business dinner or lunch, but probably not intimate enough for a date.

2008-02-25,2.0,"Went with a bunch of friends for dinner after work on Friday.  The place was DEAD...and the service reeked of desperation.  The waiter was very nice and all, but pushed the expensive tasting menu so hard that it felt like his job was at stake.  He made a really big deal when two people only wanted appetizers and dessert, even when the other five people at the table ordered full dinners.  One gets really strange vibes when you place your order for an appetizer and the waiter asks, ""Really?"" three times.  Come on, dude.   The food was...eh.  It wasn't bad, but for the prices they're charging, there is much tastier and more creative food to be had in the city.  The amuse bouche was a cucumber slice with a couple of cherry tomatoes and some basil oil.  I don't expect revelations every time I eat out, but this was so uninspired and utterly disappointing.  The cheese platter was unassuming (for $12, I'd expect better cheeses than the mild, tasteless stuff they served).  The white pizza was good, but again, not worth the $13.  Save your money and try other restaurants - there's a good reason why this place is empty.",0.9635,0.769,0.153,0.079,0.5315972222222222
2008-01-05,4.0,"The first time I ate at Zealous was years ago when the Chef /Owner had moved it out to Elmhurst.  I remember telling myself that I was surprised that a restaurant of this caliber was out in the ""burbs"" and not in the city.   Well fast forward many years and I had the chance to eat here the other night.  Now located in River North in an old warehouse, (see- I thought this was deserving of a city location!)  Zealous makes its mark by delivering great food and drink in a relaxing environment.   We sampled a variety of things on the menu- my favorites were the chopped hearts of palm salad and Asian crab cakes as appetizers.  I could have stopped there but we moved on to the entrees.  All were delicious.  We had the Amish chicken- tender and moist, the Grouper that had a macadamia nut crust on it and also a filet.  We tried both the sweet potato fries as well as the garlic Romano fries with our dinners and decided both were so equally good that no favorite could be chosen.  Since one person in our group always has to have the cheese plate- we also had a chance to sample that as well.  And you can't talk about the food without mentioning the great warm rolls that they serve.   In fact- I'd like one of those now! The wine cellar at Zealous has over 750 bottles of wine so there is sure to be something that you like.   My only surprise?  It was that the place was not busier on the night we were there- but that may be due to it's kind of out of the way location.  Check out Zealous.  You'll be happy you did and it will go on your list of places to visit regularly!",0.9953,0.79,0.198,0.013,0.6476884226884227

You sense right from the get-go that this will be a GREAT experience.  From the hint of dill in the warm dinner rolls to the fabulous taste of the muse.  The wines by the glass are modest in price, not the $14 as quoted by another review.  My $8 Buglioni 'Clandestino' Bianco was so good, I will be ordering a case of it for my home consumption.  My wife's Malbec was a nice compliment to the veal dish we ordered. We ended up ordering wine,  two appetizers, one dinner and one dessert.  The Seared Sea Scallops with Ragout of Cannellini Beans and Crispy Pancetta Bacon, were amazing.  Even the Cannellini beans melted in your mouth.  The Truffled-Sweet Potato Risotto with Seared Duck Breast and Apple-Fennel Salad was good, but not great.  I found the risotto a bit too dense and dry and the duck breast a bit bland, especially in light of the scallops that were so flavorful. Our waiter Anthony praised our choice of the Braised Veal Cheek Papriks with Potato Gnocchi and Royal Trumpet Mushrooms.  We now know why.  The veal is as tender and tasty as any meat item I have ever ordered.  Although served as nice sized chunks of veal, you can cut it with a fork!  As a nice touch of service by the kitchen; they split/served the order in half for us so we could each eat from our own plates instead of the usual clumsy sharing ritual. After we had already ordered the Apple Tart they brought by a free mini-dessert sampling (the names I don't recall) but the bit size items only served to build our anticipation for the Apple Tart.  But, the Apple Tart did not live up to the anticipation, however.  A bit too doughy and it would have benefited from being served warmer. On the way out Chef/Owner Michael Taus was there to greet us and ask about our experience.  We gladly stated that it will not take us another 16 months to return.  With 20% tip, this wonderful culinary experience was a mere $107.",0.9954,0.833,0.156,0.011,0.7030612244897959
