2017-07-27,1.0,Ignored straight to my face and it feels racially motivated. 07-27-17 @ 5pm. came into get a drink before a training and both the bartender (the larger guy) and the barback looked me in the face and ignored me. They went to the white guy next to me twice but didn't give me the time of day. The man who got to order even turned to me and told me he'd never seen someone be ignored like that and was rather appalled. I decided I wasn't going to spend my money if they didn't think it was good enough for them. Can't help but this this was racially motivated.,0.3427,0.772,0.12,0.108,0.42857142857142855

I'd been past this location many times but never had to time to try it. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was how big this place is and how much seating there is inside and out. I was debating on a salad or a sandwich and ended up going with a chicken salad sandwich to go. I should have figured but was taken aback for the $9 something price tag for just a sandwich (yup, no drink or chips). Eep. The ciabatta bread was actually pretty good but the chicken salad was not as good I was hoping for, esp. at $9. Thank goodness I didn't get that oatmeal cookie I was checking out. I'll have to rethink this as an option. The outdoor seating (at least, when it's not hot and muggy) and view are pretty tempting.",0.9787,0.835,0.15,0.015,0.5901515151515152

They had a problem with the fountain drinks, and when my friend ordered a Sprite, all she got was unflavored carbonated water, but when we brought up the problem with the server, she was nice about it, and she brought a new drink out. As for me, I kept ordering different beers, but the server had to keep coming back to let me know that they were sold out. After my fourth failed attempt at ordering a beer, the bar manager came out and politely waited for me to pick a beer that they had in-stock. Minus a few points for the drink snafus, then plus a few points back for the excellent service.  When it got a little chillier, we moved inside. Baci's interior is both chic and cozy. The puffy booths are clean, classy, and roomy. The only thing that takes you outside the stylish atmosphere is the weird arcade game (there's a random deer shooting game? I find it difficult to believe that anyone actually plays it). They close their regular menu and start serving bar food at 4pm, but on Fridays, they're open as late as 1am, depending on how busy it is.
