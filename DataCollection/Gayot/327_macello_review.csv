2017-06-17,5.0,"Macello became a secondary option for dinner because the original restaurant we chose ended up having too long of a wait, so I was already less excited to go here. To my surprise, I had a fantastic experience. Service was too notch as everything was consistent and quick. The ambience was very pleasant. The food was wonderful. I had the margarita pizza with mushroom, arugula, and prosciutto added. My friend had the Tartufata pasta that had mushrooms, truffle oil, and sausage. It was all delicious. Nothing we had was over seasoned as that's an issue I always encounter when I go out to eat. Everything tasted fresh and did not go home feeling heavy from all the food. I normally don't leave yelp reviews, but I think Macello definitely deserves more than 4 stars.",0.9454,0.825,0.167,0.009,0.5774509803921568

2017-04-03,4.0,"On West Lake street but flying below the scorching hot Fulton Market restaurant scene Macello's is a warm, inviting, classic Italian place.  We came here for a large group business dinner and the staff handled all 15 of us easily - an impressive feat in and of itself. The room is inviting, with a comfortable bar on one side and the flame from the wood oven near the back. We came on a cold March evening and it was the perfect antidote to the outside.  On ambiance alone it gets 5 stars.  I feel like this place was channeling one of the owner's grandmothers. We had a spread of appetizers for the table.  Fried Calamari and Stuffed Eggplant both disappeared quickly. We also got two of their outstanding pizzas - Margherita and Barese (Artichoke and Olive).  Also terrific right out of the wood burning oven, which always does the right trick for the crust. I couldn't track down everything that our table ordered for entrees but I did see that every plate was cleaned, which is impressive as portions are similar to what I imagine the previously mentioned grandmother would have served. Tons of great pasta choices so making a choice was difficult.  Since I'd never been here before I opted for a classic to help me baseline the kitchen.  I opted for Cavatelli al Forno which was again straight from the oven.  So rich and delicious, with a silky sauce that perfectly complimented the wonderfully toothsome pasta.    For desert, we were presented with a delicious assortment of sweets including an absolutely fabulous Tiramisu.  I would go back just for that. For a warm, inviting, delicious classic Italian dinner I can't recommend Macello strongly enough.   In particular, it has a tremendous selection of vegetarian options to go with the seafood and meat selections, so it will likely please everyone in your group.",0.9986,0.678,0.285,0.038,0.6065972222222223

2017-02-27,1.0,"Very disappointing.  We have been going here for several years and although it was never a 5 star restaurant, it was generally good food and a pleasant atmosphere.  Sunday night was a far different story.    We ordered beer and an appetizer but the drinks didn't come until we were done eating the appetizer.  I guess it takes a long time to open a bottle of Peronni.  And of course the waitress was no where to be found to even attempt to get her attention and remind her.  Then we ordered a couple of pizza, in addition to other entrees for the main course, and the pizza's came out burnt.  They were delivered by a bus boy, not our waitress and by the time she came by several minutes later -- Everyone was more than halfway through their meal -- and we had to leave shortly to go to a Blackhawks game.  We complained about the pizza, and they did make another one that we took to go -- but no manager ever came up to apologize, and they did nothing else to try to make up for the poor service and poor food.  By the way the images below are of the less-burnt of the two pizzas.  The totally burnt one they took away Forno Rosso just a couple of blocks away on Randolph is a far, far better option for pizza -- as well as good service.",-0.8072,0.843,0.064,0.093,0.5276086956521739
2017-02-09,3.0,"Nothing short of a disappointment here; from the service to the food.  Service was slow at best. Took about 8-10 minutes for our waiter to greet us. Then took about 10-12 minutes to get the check after asking for it. Overall there was so much opportunity to do better here but the waiter seemed more occupied with chatting then providing service.  Our food was a follows: Macello Salad - Great. Not too heavy on the dressing. Great ratio of basil and arugula. Fresh and delicious.  Italian Wedding Soup- Half way decent but more like eggs chicken broth and hamburger meat. Extremely heavy on the eggs which overpowered the rest of the soup. The meatballs were a bit bland and were just balls of ground beef with no flavor.  Margarita Pizza- Outstanding. The sauce was not too sweet and the pizza was cooked perfectly. By far the best part of the meal.  Baked Pasta- Meh, average. Can't even remember what was in it. Just pasta, sauce some meat and big chunks of cheese on top. Not worthwhile at all.  New York Steak- Horrible. Closer to roadkill then anything else. I bet the steak at Applebee's would be 3 or 4 times better then whatever this was. The meat was dry and tough but the sauce on top was nothing but salt and disgusting.  I don't even understand how this can be classified and solid as a NY steak.   I would love to give this place another try but frankly it's probably not worth it. With so many other good places in the neighborhood (especially Italian places) I probably won't return.",0.9948,0.71,0.22,0.07,0.50487012987013

We were seated with no wait on a Friday night. Our server was friendly and explained the night's specials to us. We ended up ordering the appetizer special of the night: prosciutto wrapped scallops. The scallops were and serve over a bed of saute spinach and a red sauce. They were tender and cooked just right. The prosciutto made it a bit too salty for me, but I did like the crispy smoked flavor from it. The spinach and red sauce didn't do much for me.  Their Italian wedding soup reminded me of an egg drop soup. The meatballs were fantastic while the broth itself was decent. For entrees we had cavatelli al forno and pork chop. The cavatelli al forno was a mild bolognese sauce baked with mozzarella. It was tasty in the sense of all the mozzarella but the bolognese itself needed more flavor. The pork chop was a HUGE disappointment. It looked beautiful seared and served over asparagus and mushroom risotto. I had asked for the pork chop to be cooked medium, but mine came out extremely well done. The inside was dry and tough to eat even though it was served over a sauce. I only ate a bit of the pork chop and continued to pick off my fiance's cavatelli instead.  I really wanted to like Macello's but the food didn't blow me away, however, our service was fantastic.",0.9822,0.831,0.132,0.037,0.5471230158730159

I added arugula on top.  I'm a sucker for burrata and this was really a great pizza.  I asked the server what his opinion was between 2 of my pizza choices and he said this was the best and it really was great.  The burrata dollops kind of melted into the pizza since they were added after it was cooked.  It had tons of flavor and great texture.   Our other friends shared the sea bass dish that they said melted in their mouth and one got the spinach salad with goat cheese that she loved--I'd definitely try it. The other got the arugula and it looked a little plain and needed more parmigano.   No dessert needed, we were full, but they were nice enough to give us each a homemade limoncello which was delicious.   I've been here several times and have had good meals.  It was a Tuesday night with a Cubs game on, so it was pretty empty.  It's a cool spot, service was very good and friendly.  It's in the farther western part of the west loop and on Lake St. which is pretty dark there.  My friend walked over and got a little nervous where she was and heard some noises in front of her and she almost stepped on about 5 rats scurrying in front of her.  GROSS!  But that's unfortunately city living for you near the el on dark Lake Street!",0.9986,0.691,0.263,0.046,0.5167714285714285

We made a reservation for 7:30, and ran into a traffic problem. They were more than happy to hold our table for us as it wasn't a busy day.  The waiter was nice enough once they took our order, but they seemed to be annoyed that we were taking our time to order (most of us hadn't seen each other in 2 years, so we were catching up). There was 2 waiters who were standing right at the foot of our table glaring and pointing at us.  I ordered the amaretto sour drink, and while it was ok, it wasn't great. I wouldn't order it again. They seemed to use a bottled sour mix which isn't the same. The Italian wedding soup- while the meatballs were perfect the broth was bland and the cheese they put on it was kinda gloopy. I ordered the Pizza Barese, but instead received the Pizza Pugliese. Due to the group I was with I didn't want to complain so I ate it. The mortadella was tasty, the burrata did not add to the pizza. It did not spread well and so when you reached that spot it sorta overwhelmed the rest of the pizza. The crust was very good. Everyone else seemed happy with their pizza's. The waiter gave us some kind of lemon shot that was very good, and my friend got some ice cream and he liked it. I might be willing to try them again for things other than their pizza, but overall I would say they are just kinda average.

We interacted with him , joking around , exchanging barbs .  He was superb . Now the food ; appetizer was a flatbread with a cheese similar to goat cheese but creamier; two bottles of an excellent Cabernet later our entres arrived. Must inform you that most dishes are finished in a coal fired oven.i don't recall what we all had but the consensus was outstanding . I'm going to long with this review but Macellos ' deserves to be discovered to a wider audience. This place is six stars out of five.

While I differ with Chicago's rating, I did enjoy a recent visit to Macello. VIBE: Whimsical, rustic, funky: the large colored globes suspended from the lofted ceiling and the bold murals on some walls set the tone for comfort & fun. SERVICE: Brisk and attentive. GOOD: Pizza Pugliese, featuring very good mortadella (alas, no pistachios, though), burrata, and a light tomato sauce was delicious; the thin crust was perfectly cooked. Not Neapolitan, just an excellent thin crust pizza. On Wednesdays, selected bottles of wine are available for half price. (My suspicion is that these selected bottles are marked up since they don't appear to be part of the standard wine list, and the listed prices are notably higher than most of the regular list. Whatever -- we enjoyed the wine.)  NOT SO GOOD: Grilled octopus was a little chewy, but still tasty. We'll be back, for sure.

2016-01-31,4.0,"Went here during Restaurant Week, so I'm not sure if my experience will be representative of the rest of the year. We started with a Insalata Spinaci - baby spinach, mushrooms, pine nuts, goat cheese.  Very small salad.  Not really a fan, but I normally don't do salad at restaurants. For my pasta, I chose Trofiette con Pesto.  I've had trofie with pesto in Italy, so this was a nice throwback.  They're tiny, twisted noodles.  I would have preferred them more al dente, but I enjoyed the dish. I followed that with Pollo Limone - They went hard core with the lemon flavor.  Might need to dial that back a notch, guys.  Still, it was pretty good, and the acidic lemon helped knock down the flavor of the grilled asparagus, which I liked. For dessert, I went with the special of the day, a chocolate lava cake and an amazing scoop of vanilla gelato. Service was fantastic.  There are lots of servers and bussers to take plates as soon as you're finished. We also appreciated that they carry some Banfi wines.  My fiancee and I stayed at Castello Banfi in Tuscany, so it's always a nice romantic throwback whenever we can drink that stuff.  A bottle of Banfi Centine (a crisp but smooth white) was $25. The Restaurant Week dinner menu is $44/person, so with wine and tip, our total was $150 for the two of us.  Had we gone another time, we probably would've just done pizzas or something.  The Restaurant Week menu is a ton of food.  My fiancee took just one bite of her second course before boxing it up to eat later.

2016-01-23,3.0,"I'm going 3 because I liked the atmosphere, but I wasn't impressed with the food. Macello is #2 on Chicago Magazine's pizza list, and I feel this place was most ill-ranked of all those I've visited.  The space itself is lovely - starkly white, 50s-ish Italian kitchen in the vestibule, and contrasting-ly dark and rich in the dining area with bright colored globes floating above.  I ordered the suggested Pugliese - and what I got was a flat pizza with a filmy layer of what seemed like ordinary ham on top.  It struck me as oily upon sight, and salty upon eating.  Maybe I should give it a second try with some topping more to my liking.   Side note:  They did give us Limoncello after our meal.  Not sure if that's customary, but it was very much appreciated :).",0.9822,0.749,0.213,0.038,0.48410493827160483
2016-01-20,2.0,"It's been over 5 years since I've been to Macello - and now I remember why. We got there and for some reason the hostess had already seated another party under our reservation. There were a few tables open so normally this wouldn't be an ordeal but we stood there for 10 minutes while she attempted to figure out the seating system on their computer -- as opposed to just getting us a table and dealing with their tech logistics on her own time. Very strange way to start - unfortunately it was downhill.  It took another 10 minutes for anyone to come to our table with water or bread, take our order, etc. The busser who eventually did, turned out to be the only capable person in the restaurant and essentially saved us from walking out of the restaurant. He was the only person (aside from when the waiter finally took our order) to come by the table at all for the entire meal.  The food was pathetic. The calamari was edible but basic. The pizza (I can't even be bothered to look up the one we had) was a giant sloppy mess. Over salted, burnt on one side, just, no. I'm not even going to bother.

It was about 4pm and the hostess asked us if we had a reservation, which we didn't however there were only 3 tables occupied. She made a face when we said that we don't and said that she'll see what she can do. Seriously?!!! The place was empty! Do they not want customers? That's a first for a restaurant business. When she came back, she seated us at the table which was at the corner close to the door so if anyone walked in, they would have to walk pass us. Again, the restaurant was almost empty... I asked for another table and after: ""one moment"", she moved us to another table. The restaurant was loud and the menu not very impressive for Italian place.

In an unassuming part of town on West Lake Street away from the glitz of Randolph Street, Macello does not disappoint. Entering the place you'd think you were lost as it's a deli counter filled with burratta, cured meats, olive trays, etc. It's like a throwback to those deli's you used to see on The Sopranos.  Looks like they'd make one helluva sandwich! Enter the main dining room thru large plastic (which keeps the cold / heat at bay) and you are immediately greeted by the smell of burning wood from their wood fired pizza oven that sits squarely in view. On a cold winter day it is a smell for sore noses (what?) Service is friendly and attentive. Water glasses always filled, cocktails never empty, food placed properly on the table, from the right, not reaching across anyone to put it down elsewhere.  Our water was always around with a win recommendation or dish recommendation and definitely didn't steer us wrong. Cocktails range from $10-$12 so just slightly lower than at say the G and the G. Wine list is varied with decent bottles (not going to blow you away) but affordable for Chicago ($40 and up).  Food was solid as my two buddies and I shared three meals. We started with a flat-bread with Serrano ham, arugula and burrata and it was terrific. Slightly crunchy crust and enough cheese to make for a nice melty, sloppy starter.  We then moved to cavatelli with grilled seafood in a white wine and garlic sauce with cherry tomatoes. The light sauce nicely complimented the seafood and pasta, not overwhelming the fresh favors of clams, mussels, calamari and scallops that accompanied the pasta. We finished off with the Americana pizza. Sadly this was the weakest of the three as the crust was burnt. Not in a good was like wood fired crispy but black. The topping were plentiful but I had a hard time tasting the pizza over the charred flesh of what was to be a wood fired pizza crust. We finished off with a Tiramisu which was light and a good size for sharing among three somewhat full gents. The dining room was large and dimly lit with high ceilings and a few TV's over the bar which was kind of a bummer as a place like this shouldn't have them in the dining room. I guess if you sat at the bar (which is in plain view of the main dining area) you'd want something to do but it did distract from the ambiance.

This is a great place if you are looking for an authentic italian pizza experience. The seating is centered around a wood-fired pizza oven which ups the cozy factor of the restaurant by at least 110%.  The waiters are all very italian and all have a lot of knowledge on the food Macello serves, so don't be afraid to ask questions like we did! There will be some menu items that look unfamiliar! The pizza was fabulous and the flavors were true. I recommend keeping the toppings to a minimum and let the wood-fired flavor truly shine. I eyed some of the pastas and appetizers being carried to nearby tables and I'll admit I was a little envious, it all looked amazing! Now, for dessert. I had just polished off a whole pizza and my stomach was pleading me not to even look at the dessert menu, but I didn't listen. As I glanced, I asked the waiter about the marscapone semifreddo, which had a name I would butcher the pronunciation of and he replied, ""you HAVE to try it!"" Seriously, one of the best desserts I ever had! Think if cheesecake and gelato had a baby, so good!

2014-05-20,4.0,"My wife and I have been to Macello twice and have had two completely different experiences. The overwhelming quality of the first experience pushes the rating up to four stars,  the second alone would score a 2.5. The food on our first trip through was fantastic as was the service and wine selection. We shared a flat bread appetizer which came fresh out of the brick oven. It was tasty and we'll prepared.  My wife had the fish special which she loved and I had a risotto special which was well balanced and cooked perfectly. Our wine was suggested by the waiter and hit exactly what we told him we were looking for... Price was fair with a100% markup over retail (cant stand when I pay $45 for an $11bottle of wine). The ambiance was quiet,  friendly and inviting. A five star rating for sure.  The second trip had the same quality service from our waiter and well paired wine. We shared a flat bread app again (a special) and it was great. That unfortunately is where the similarities end. My wife had a pasta special. It was cooked well and presented nicely however it was too spicy for her to eat. I love spicy food and tried it... found it spicy but palatable. .. However with as much heat as it had it shouldve been mentioned when describing the special.  I'm sure they would've exchanged it (to their credit) but wife didn't want to hassle with it.  I had the sausage and fava Risotto. It was cooked well, if not a bit overdone (mushy) but there was so much cheese added, the only taste that made is way through was the Parmesan... so much so in fact that strings of melted cheese pulled from every fork-full. Salty, cheesy,  bland. The final issue was with the crowd. We came in at 7:00 on a Thursdsy night and the dining room was mostly full including one party of roughly 16 diners. Im fine with loud crowds, im fine with people enjoying themselves at dinner in an animated fashion. What Im not fine with is people screaming out loud, whistling (two finger whistle, not melodic), throwing things around, etc.. they were terrible. We complained and the response was ""well they're drunk... they've been here since five o'clock."" No attempt to quell the behavior, no compensation, not even an apology. Friends of the owner? Not sure... Understand you want to keep a large party spending a lot happy but not at the expense of the other forty diners.  In short, I guess I need another visit to figure out if this place is jekyll or hyde... but the first visit was wonderful so I am giving Macello the benefit of the doubt for now.",0.9944,0.772,0.173,0.055,0.5928122192273134

2013-01-16,5.0,"I just had an amazing lunch, my first visit here, and had to tell somebody! I work right around the corner, but never thought to give them a try until today.  It looks from the outside to be more of a sit-down restaurant, that might make me stretch my one-hour lunch.  I decided it was worth a try for something new. The exterior of the restaurant/small shop is unassumingly charming, just under the el tracks.  The shop is tiny yet  appealing, showing off artisanal sausages and cheese, which I intend to go back for.  There's a neighborhood-appropriate meat rack hanging from the ceiling, indicating to me this is one of many local converted warehouses.  This Union Stockyards used to be just around the corner, after all! Greeted casually by the host and led into the main restaurant, I found the décor masculine but comfortable.  I was pleasantly surprised by streaming natural light let in through the glass roof.  Exposed brick walls and dark wood abound, and the floor is concrete flecked with colorful tile shards.  Painted globe lights lend an ever-so-slight feeling of Carnevale to the atmosphere.  It feels totally Chicago, with a little Italy thrown in.  Soft modern Italian music played, giving me the feeling of being transported to the Continent for lunch. I ordered from the lunch menu, which seems to recommend paninis pretty heavily.  I'm not a panini gal, so I ordered the Bucatini alla Boscaiola (with mushroom, sausage, red wine, and a touch of cream, $11).  To keep it cheap, water was my drink.  Warm, homemade bread was brought to my table, along with a nice olive oil and freshly grated Parmesan for dipping.  I didn't go hungry while I was waiting, and I wasn't disappointed when the main course appeared.  An enormous round pasta bowl arrived with steaming hot, slightly wine-purple, creamy, perfectly al dente noodles, hunks of homemade sausage, and wild mushrooms.  A scoop of cold tapenade sat atop the noodle mountain, adding a welcome acidity and textural contrast.  The aroma was rich wine and earth, but it wasn't heavy.  I barely held myself back from eating it all in one massive snarf. The service was attentive, filling my water, and whisking my leftovers to a little box when I had to leave.  There was no rush or fuss, but my server was there when I was ready to go.  I couldn't resist a double espresso for dessert, which was necessary to ward off a food coma at work.  The mug was warmed prior to pouring the coffee, so it arrived Vesuvio-hot.   I couldn't have been happier with my lunch today, and I'm certain I'll go back again.  For under twenty dollars, including tip, I had a delightfully indulgent feast.  In this neighborhood, it's nice to have a gourmet option that isn't impossibly expensive.  I can't wait to go for after-work wine and appetizers!",0.9976,0.81,0.172,0.018,0.5192745426616393

I have eaten dinner at this restaurant at least eight times over the last several years and I feel that the Pugliese cuisine here is absolutely delizioso.   My favorite appetizers to share are the Barese sausage with fava beans and bietole along with the steamed mussels and claims in a white wine sauce. I also can't resist having a nice glass of wine with a little prosciutto and melon. The soup I tried here was also one of the best soups I have ever had and it has inspired how I try to make soup at home.  As for the entrees, the beef sirloin my husband had was out of this world and the seafood risotto and the farro with porcini mushrooms we have tried have been similarly divine.  Finally, a small glass of limoncello or an Italian-style espresso with a heavenly slice of tiramisu or a scoop of gelato make for a sweet end to a wonderful meal.  I was recently at this restaurant with my best friend of thirty plus years who was visiting Chicago from Mexico City and it was a perfect evening.  It made me feel good to have taken her and her son to a restaurant that showed Chicago at its very best.

2012-09-18,3.0,"We stopped by here for a work lunch, choosing it for want of something ""different"" than the standard city fare. We joked on the cab ride out that this was certainly an off the beaten path place - it took 10 minutes and more than $15 to get there!  SIDE NOTE if you took a taxi to get here!!!! When you're done eating, you're out in the boon docks. Be prepared to walk a ways to find another cab. ATMOSPHERE: Interesting. They invested a mint for a stone pizza oven which is located right on the dining floor, and it was interesting to watch the chef make the pizza right in front of us. One wall of the dining area is an elaborate display of wines, which is lovely, but I didn't get the amateur paint job on the remaining walls and the overhead globes. It felt like a high school art project, and I'm not sure how the effect ties in to an italian eatery. I found it a bit weird. Additionally, the chairs are solid wood and weren't comfortable to sit in, another drawback for me. FOOD: Good. The restaurant boasts they are open for lunch, and yet there was no lunch menu. There were 3 of us dining (work colleagues), and we uncomfortably agreed to share a couple of dishes (our waiter insisted the portions were huge and we do this). We chose: 1) Margherita Pizza as an appetizer - Paid full price for the pizza. It was decent, but frankly I expected more, as it was their highlight. The crust was very good, but the flavors were missing. The pizza sauce was flavorless, not nearly enough garlic or spice, and the cheese just mediocre as there wasn't enough. As for basil, there was one VERY large leaf in the middle of the pie, but apparently none on the rest of the slices, which was a dissapointment. If this is their claim to fame, they've a way to go. 2) Barese Sausage and Fava Bean Risotto - the menu and the server neglected to mention this was a red wine risotto (which I do not care for because of the almost sour taste it leaves). The sausage was a bit overwhelmed in the dish, when it should have been the star, and the fava beans were slightly mushy, as was the risotto itself.  Either the dish had been premade and sat too long (which I find odd because it was lunch), or the chef overcooked it, but either way another ""just miss"" for  me. 3) Gamberi Pomodorini (with shrimp) - An elegant dish, my suprise favorite as I normally don't care for seafood and pasta dishes. The flavors were vibrant, the pasta perfectly cooked, and the shrimp large and fresh. This dish was the clear winner, although another shrimp or two would have been a smart choice. SERVICE: Fair. We could not really understand our server, he was quiet and had a thick accent. We had to ask him to repeat something more than 3 times even though the restaurant was empty save for us. He also didn't seem to have strong menu preferences even though we asked, and did his best to ""undersell"" us (get us to order less) which I find odd, given they are in need of profit to survive. VALUE: Slightly expensive. I get the whole ""authentic"" vibe, and the artsy way they've set up the dining floor, but frankly the food fell short on execution, and therefore the prices weren't acceptable. At $24, my risotto had better be perfection on a plate, and this wasn't.  I'm hoping with time and experience they will improve. It was a nice break from the mainstream, but this place is too far out of the loop with only mediocre food to survive with these prices unless they raise the bar REALLY far.",0.9972,0.774,0.161,0.065,0.5475918028903103

I normally do not dine at Italian restaurants outside of Italy because quite frankly, I can make much better Italian food at home.  Be mindful, I am an Italian American, my family has owned an Italian restaurant and if I can't make it, I can always ask my 80 year old mother.  Anyway, that all changed last night.  This is the rare place that after you eat there, you cannot wait to share it with your friends and family! I am even going to share Macello with the biggest critic of Italian food I know, Mom.  Believe me, that is worth 7 stars. I went there with 6 of my close friends. someone suggested Macello so I just went with the flow.  It was a great call.  We started with the wood burning brick oven pizzas.    This is not Chicago pizza, this is Naples Italy pizza.  Wafer thin crust covered with the perfect amount of sauce and cheese.  We tried 3 different pizzas and they were all fantastic. We ordered the speck and mozzarella and stuffed artichokes for an appetizer.  I have been eating Italian food all my life.  I knew this was going to be a special place after this course. The speck is a thin slice of pork belly wrapped around a fresh piece of mozzarella cheese.  It is placed in the oven to sweat the meat and soften the cheese.  This blew us away.  The stuffed baby artichokes were excellent.  Best stuffed artichoke I have eaten, hands down.  We ordered 2 more of each of these! At that point, we ordered the several dishes and just passed them around the table.  I am having a difficult time choosing my favorite.  The mushroom farro is a must have. When it was placed on the table the aroma made your mouth water.  The beef Milanese was superb, the meat melted in my mouth.  The lamp chops were cooked and seasoned to perfection.

The rotating specials have always been great.  Last time in we tried the lamb chops which were succulent and well-seasoned.  We've also tried a couple of different risottos and they have all come out just-right (it's so easy to over or under cook risotto).  I've yet to try the pasta so may have to do so and update this review at some point. Separate from the restaurant they have a deli in the front.  Lots of salads, antipasti, and desserts.  All have been great, but be prepared to wait a moment for the manager to figure out where the serving utensils and boxes are--this part of the restaurant is still working out the kinks.

2012-05-13,3.0,"We had an expensive hit or miss experience at Macello. I'd go back, but just to sit at the bar for pizza. On the positive side, the Neapolitan-style pizza here is very good. It is not the same quality as Ciao Napoli or Spacca Napoli, but it is a great option in the neighborhood. We also had a grilled seafood appetizer served with cannellini beans and rapini that was excellent. Service was friendly and the waiter gave us some complimentary limoncello at the end of the meal. Everything else was just average and expensive. We had the tuna special, which was served with a nice seafood risotto. The tuna was overcooked, which can't happen at $30+. It was a basic preparation, which you could get most anywhere. The risotto eclipsed the fish and would be a better option on its own. The crudaiola pasta was solid, but not exceptional. The cannoli were awful (seriously, they shouldn't even be on the menu) and the spumoni was as good as whatever you can buy at the store (no way was this made in-house).  Oddly, the cocktail menu is part of the dessert menu. Had I seen this list when I first sat down, I probably would have started my meal with a cocktail. This should really be on the table with the wine list. Throw in a few glasses of wine and we were almost at $200 with tax and tip. The quality of the food did not make this anything close to a good value. I also have a philosophical objection to paying this much for food, regardless of quality, when it is served in a room with TVs showing sports. Sitting at the bar, watching a game with a pizza and a drink would be a much more preferable, and far less expensive experience.",0.9944,0.824,0.16,0.016,0.5057839620696764

But no, just high quality.

The courses were timed well, allowing us to finish our food and bottle of wine at the same time. A very reasonably priced wine list too - several bottles in the $20-30 range!

2012-01-19,5.0,"I go out fine dining about four nights a week. I usually spend two of them at Macello. This is my favorite restaurant with the most authentic Italian food you will find in America. Every dish is a blend of four, five, or six flavors. No soggy pasta with some sauce spread on top here. The pastas are real Italian ""al dente"" and they are mixed with wine sauces, white beans, cherry tomatoes, muscles, etc. You won't find these dishes anywhere else. The prices and portions are most reasonable.  Forget location, location, location. Macello's is in an old butcher shop on Lake Street just west of Racine. It is an oasis under the el tracks and light industry surroundings.  This place would be an ideal set for a film. The  main supports of the roof are exposed wooden arch trusses with skylights. There are gears and shafts attached to the trusses as a remembrance of times past. With wood tables, chairs, and shelves, an immaculate concrete floor decorated with splashes of coloring, balloon lighting, some modern art and the wood burning ovens in the background you get all the ambiance of a Rocky Mountain ski resort.  The owner, Joe (from Bari, Italy) is almost always on the premises riding heard over everything that is going on in the place from the cooking to the serving, to the bar tending, to the greetings - you name it; he's involved and readily accessible. It's an all male European style server cast who know their business and how to make your evening a delight. The charming and sexy females attend to the bar.  Joe is from the old school - he makes sure his customers get more than they pay for and he is rather liberal with an on the house, after dinner, homemade limoncello. Joe loves what he does and it is reflected in his product, his staff, and the atmosphere. The wine list is superb and there is one wall with shelves loaded with wine bottles.

I had read that the pizzas were amazing and just like in Italy, so I was excited to try them out. Unfortunately I can't review the pizza because we never got it. After waiting for 45 minutes and the server never coming back to give us a status report, we called him over and he said we were next.

2011-03-22,5.0,"I really wanted to like this place, thinking it is a hidden West Loop gem, and it is...kinda. The decor and ambience was lofty, casual and fun with the hanging globes and coloful murals; yet it had a non-stuffy Italian sophistication with the wine bottle display. The focal point is the wood burning oven---which produced a classic neopolitan style pizzas. The sauce in flavorful and was a great suace to creamy fresh mozzeralla cheese ratio. Overall, food and wine and ambience make this place a definate go- to. My problem was with the service. I went on a Monday night, 4 other tables in the restaurant, and although we placed our drink order and recieved bread promptly, we had to wait almost 30 minutes to place our  food order and almost another 40 to get our 2 pizzas. The wait seemed absurd for a quiet night especially when our server was in eye's sight most of the time and did not bother to atleast come by and let us know about a delay, or apologize for an off day. When we finally received our food (after slowly finishing a entire bottle of wine between the two of us), we wanted to ask for some chili flakes, but couldnt't flag our server down-- he never bothered to check on us at all. If the service and speed improves, this place has great potential. EDIT: Have gone back a few times since I wrote the first review and service has been on point. Actually love it for carry out/delivery.",0.9762,0.873,0.114,0.013,0.47175925925925927

Only a block from the hustle and bustle of Randolph Street, this unassuming restaurant is not only hard to see, but because it has a deli feel in the front of the restaurant, you can't see the tables behind the curtains in the back of the house. Wanted to find a new place to eat this past weekend but not have to deal with big crowds and a wait. I drive by this place and knew that it had closed for a fire but it has re-opened.  It is the perfect size and perfect buzz level to have a conversation with your fellow diners. The design of the space is unique, combining the heritage of the stockyard/meat packing feel of the area with the modern vibe of an Italian restaurant. You are greeted with a Bueno Sera upon arrival by Matteo and shown to your table. The service is stellar and the food is off the charts, especially the pizza. Man, the pizza. Also, topped it off with some cannoli's and the ice cream that tastes homemade.  Highly recommend Macello, I will definitely be back.",0.9523,0.877,0.099,0.024,0.5131228956228955

The restaurant itself is on a super-quiet stretch of Lake Street  (under the ""el"" tracks).  The building is an old slaughterhouse from the late 19th century and has a  white-tiled,  old-fashioned delicatessen in the front.   It's a cool building with ample (and FREE) street parking.

2008-02-24,3.0,"Normally, an Italian restaurant that is only ""pretty good"" would be two stars, but Macello gets three for being mildly original as well.

There's a whole variety of Puglian (Puglanese? Puglitalian?... From Puglia anyway) wines by the glass or the bottle. So if you're into Italian wines, you'd enjoy looking it over. As far as the food goes, it's a little hit-or-miss. They have a pizza oven, and the pizzas are above average. I had fish, which was done well-- cooked whole in the oven, then fileted tableside. By far the best thing we had was a dessert I'd never heard of: croccatino. It's a semi-fredo with walnuts and caramel and love. It went so quick we had to order a second. The rest of what we had was not as impressive. They make a big deal about this Puglian (Puglanesque?) sausage they use in a couple dishes, but it has a funny, not pleasant taste. The girlfriend had it in risotto, which would have been ten times better if they'd left it off. And we split a salad (the ""Macello"" salad, so you'd figure it would be a good one) that was basically a pile of arugula with almost no dressing. Our server was great-- very attentive and fun-- and the decor is nice. It's a converted brick warehouse with these big colorful light balls hanging from the ceiling-- very warm and inviting.

(some italian guy named macello did instead) 2. was boyfriend trying to sound more suave by changing his name to an italian seducer? 3. did the flower shop screw up the card..? well we ended up at macello that night and yes, the flower shop screwed up, and yes, the flowers were from boyfriend who didn't change his name to create some kind of romance novel fantasy... let me start with the good: i love love loved the atmosphere (i could do without those lit up balls on the ceiling reminiscent of marche and red light)...but it was old, rustic, dark inside...perfect for a v-day dinner. the hostesses and our server were nice... but let me get to why a restaurant is a restaurant...well yea, the food: it was not that good at all...the pasta not quite al dente, the sauce was suppose to be a white wine/olive oil sauce but ended up being a marinara, the bread was stale and had been reheated (my rule of thumb usually and especially for an italian place is, good bread = good food), the parm was fresh (+), the high grade buffalo mozzarella that was on the caprese salad was awesome (+) - it was like a ricotta consistency, the lamb chops my boyfriend got were flavorless, the rapini was over done and reduced to a shredded mess covered in olive oil, they didn't have 1 pinot noir wine by the glass on the menu (wtf?), and the dessert was merely a done-up hostess chocolate cream pie...oh, in the shape of a heart. i heard the pizza was good, but we never tried that. i love the location, tucked away on lake street in the quiet west loop...but the food did not match the price or atmosphere. it was too expensive for what we had to eat...(and when i mean had, well it was in front of our faces and we were hungry)- next time i'm sticking to the usuals for italian - la scarola, volare, quartino or my aunt and grandma's kitchen.",0.9981,0.763,0.208,0.029,0.4911706349206349
2008-02-19,5.0,"I took a friend here for his birthday and it was a big hit. I spent a great deal of time in Italy, and the food here was probably the closest I've ever had to authentic Italian cuisine. I absolutely loved the decor, the service was excellent, and the wine list was impressive. I wasn't a huge fan of the traditional presentation of the fish (there were still bits of bone in there even after they fileted it) but it was all delicious. I'll definitely be back!",0.9564,0.748,0.22,0.032,0.5958333333333333
2008-02-17,4.0,"Oooooh, mama likey! I knew it was love when we walked in 20 mins late for our reservation (I wasn't about to leave home without catching the end of Project Runway, no apologies) and the hostess poo-pooed our tardiness away with a ""oh, it's no problem, we have your table all set"" and lead us right to a cozy table in the back, ready to go. What? That never happens! Bonus in my book. Yet, I wasn't too sure what was going on with the music back there. It was concert-loud one minute, then totally gone the next. Uh, what? Whatever, I didn't notice after a few drinks anyways. Speaking of, the cocktails were delish, to say the least. So much so, I ordered a martini with our chocolate gelato! Hey, vodka is the new cappuccino, ya know what I'm saying? The brick oven pizza was excellent and the boy was loving his fillet with mushroom risotto and zucchini (also cooked in the oven.) I had the orecchiette pasta dish (which was lovely) except that I mistakenly thought it was a vegetarian dish but came to the table with three large sausage-esque meat portions that I was more than bummed about. We couldn't figure out what the hell they were? Mystery meat? Not so bonus. Our service was stellar and we're pretty sure we weren't charged for the half bottle of Chianti we ordered either. Bo-yah! That made for a bigger tip for Dave, who was actually a very punctual, very tall, very attentive server. Plus, $8 valet? I don't even think I bum will park your car for less than $10 bucks these days.",0.835,0.848,0.086,0.066,0.5096531820669752
2008-02-13,3.0,"After reading about Macello on Metromix, I was very excited to see what it was all about.   Maybe I built myself up, but I left a little dissapointed. Decor: The interior is stunning.  I love the urban, rustic look of the old meatpacking factory with the big fireplace and open kitchen.  Unlike other reviewers, I didn't have a problem with the furniture besides the fact that the tables were packed a little close together and my highbacked chair kept falling over when I got up to use the restroom.  Beautiful bar area with a nice open feel to the room. Service: The hostesses and bartenders are beyond nice, although I had called to see if they could accomodate us 20 minutes earlier than our scheduled reservation as we had someplace to be after dinner, which they said they could, only to arrive and wait 25 minutes for a table.  Our waiter was very attentive, although his wine recommendation was just OK.  Granted, it was a Friday night and busy, but like some others, I didn't feel that the service was keeping pace with us.  They may have checked a number of times whether or not we were enjoying ourselves, but appetizer plates were left empty for a long time on the table and our entrees took forever to come out. Food: We enjoyed our antipasto plate; however, they fell down on the entrees a bit.  My boyfriend ordered the bone in filet, which came highly recommended; unfortunately, it was a little over-cooked.  My fish was fine, although uninspiring. I have friends who have tried the pizza and loved it and the wine list is decent and includes many reasonably priced bottles, so I will definitely be back for a more low-key meal. My recommendation would be to try it out.  I think this place has all the potential in the world to be great, but they're still working the kinks out.",0.9955,0.781,0.187,0.032,0.5630409356725148
2008-02-08,1.0,"A group of friends and I pick a new restaurant to go to each month and this month, I chose Macello.  I was very much looking forward to it.  When I went to make a reservation using Open Table, I tried to make a 7:00 reservation, but the only available times were 6:00 or 8:00.  We arrived at 8:00 to find a restaurant that was 70% empty.  It remained this way the entire time we were there.  Our waitress had the personality of a rock.  I would never hold that against someone.  What I would hold against a server, however, is not even apologizing after a two foot long string of gum came out from under my plate as it was carried away.  This was totally disgusting.  Everyone at the table was shreiking.  The waitress was standing right there and said nothing.  I was appalled.  I have had better customer service at McDonald's.  Although the food was not bad, I strongly believe this place will not last more than 6 months.  There are far too many other Italian options in the city that are a better value and have much better customer service.  I am embarrassed that I chose Macello for our February dinner.",0.9065,0.818,0.12,0.061,0.546223927587564
2008-01-31,3.0,Decor: Like the meat packing vibe. Love the custom made globe lights. Comfy fireplace in the winter. Stupid high chairs fell over twice. Splat!! Food: Pizza is great. Tangy sauce is yummy. Pastas are hit or miss. Beef spicy roll is flavorful. Appetizers ok. Service: Sloppy. Spilled our wine. Couldn't offer decent wine recommendation. Wait staff appeared unhappy with their job.  Probably won't be back unless I am taken there.,0.8802,0.711,0.198,0.091,0.6340740740740742
2008-01-21,2.0,"We tried this place out a few weeks ago and were pretty disappointed.  The interior looks cool, but I agree with the reviewers that say the high back wooden chairs are long on style, short on comfort.  It's a bit cramped, a bit loud, but the music was good.  The waitress seemed a little confused, but she did try very hard to be helpful.  She didn't know anything about the wines but she called over someone who was more knowledgeable.  Wine selection was decent.  For food we had the pizza for an appetizer and I thought this was just ok, not as great as some of the other reviewers.  For dinner we ran the gamut between the four of us - sea bass, veal chop, in-bone filet, risotto with sausage.  Only the veal chop was outstanding.  I had the risotto and the sausage came in these little balls - it was very weird looking and tasting.  My husband had the filet and it was just so so, ditto for the sea bass.  Maybe if we had stuck with pasta we would have had better luck.",0.9634,0.762,0.162,0.076,0.5658012820512821
2007-11-11,2.0,"I have to say I was excited about going to this place, as the one print review I read was wonderful.  Unfortunately, I came away with a different opion... Decor: Agree with the other reviewers that the interior is stunning.  A beautiful rustic look with some modern flairs, most notably the lighting.  Unfortunately, I found the hard wood backed chairs to be uncomfortable and never got comfortable throughout the meal. Service: Our waitress seemed unsure of what we ordered while ordering it, and had to come back to check.  Throughout the meal, I felt like the staff was hovering around the table (it was a slow night), but never felt the service was keeping pace with us.  They may have checked a number of times whether or not we were enjoying ourselves, but appetizer plates were left empty for a long time on the table. Food: The salumi & cheese plate was uninspiring.  The olives were bland and a bit chewy.  The salad (rustica) was good, but the presentation was poor. The risotto zampina was delicious, if a little salty.  I'd get this dish again, it was that good.  The bone in filet was outstanding.  It holds its own against the steakhouse in Chicago that I've been to (Shula's, Ditka's, Custom House, etc).  Perfectly prepared, and a fantastic cut of beef. I've heard the pizza is the reason to go here, so I'll probably head back again.  The wine list has a good breadth and depth, and I'm not sure the waitstaff could choose a wine to match a meal better than I could. If you're in the area, try it out.  Who knows, when I go back for the pizza, I may have to up my review rating.  My advice though? Go during the week when it's quieter as I could see this place getting really loud if it got really crowded.",0.9864,0.773,0.157,0.071,0.6260510510510511
2007-10-30,3.0,"I love the decor of this place.  The large globe lights are very colorful, and the pizza oven gives the place a warm feeling.  We went on a Friday night, no reservations, around 7pm.  It was pretty busy, very loud and we had no trouble getting a seat right away.   I had wanted to try the pizza, but we ended up getting salads, which I'd recommend skipping.  Both were way too simple for the price.  I had the house salad which was just romaine leaves drizzled with olive oil and a wedge of lemon on the side.  That's it.  Not a whole lot of flavor going on there (I'll give the menu credit though - it's exactly what it said it would be.  I just imagined that was the ""basic"" description and there would be a little more to it.  My mistake.)  My boyfriend's salad was equally underdressed.  Next time we'll try the pizza or antipasti platter.   As for entrees, those were more successful.  I hade the orcetti (sp?) with beef, excellent flavor, very tender chunks of meat, well-cooked pasta, a nice dish.  My b-friend had the seafood pasta, which he said was ""fine"".  I asked him to elaborate and he said it was ""fine, just fine"".  He finally said he was a little suspicious that it was so inexpensive, with the variety of seafood it included, especially when a comparable seafood dish on the menu cost more.  But he said it was good, nothing outstanding, but good.  He liked my entree better.   We shared a bottle of wine - a very nice red, very reasonably priced.  For dessert we had the panna cotta and we both thought it was very good.   Service was good, friendly, well-paced.  I thought the salads were overpriced but the rest of the menu was reasonable, about the same as other Italian places in the neighborhood.  We'll definitely be going back to try the pizzas and a couple other things on the menu.",0.9949,0.787,0.179,0.034,0.5380505952380954
2007-10-05,4.0,"I just went here over the weekend as it is around the corner from my condo in the West Loop and I thought it has potential, it is a rustic Italian eatery in the Warehouse District with a Puglia-inspired menu... These are the pros-  1) really cool atmosphere with fun lighting and the views of wood burning pizza ovens, almost romantic in a city kinda way;  a little lounge in the back of the space also a plus for waiting or apps/wine 2) food suprisingly good- we had the beet salad with gorgonzola (very fresh), antipasto plate, oriochetti with meat (can't remember the name), and margarita pizza ( I felt it was a bit burnt from the oven but my hubby said that is the flavor some time??) but the cheese and sauce was tasty 3) Bottles of wine prices very reasonable. 4)Parking - easy, they have valet but really no need as there is endless parking in the evening Cons-  1) Almost empty - I can't stand being the only people at a restaurant (I actually will leave) but there were a few other tables...so we stayed. 2) a tad pricey, however we did get alot more food than normal (I like to try everything) and we did have the leftovers the next day for dinner... but it was $82 for two with only one glass of wine. 3) Wine pours by the glass - small, I recommend a bottle.... Pro /Con?- Under the el on lake and elizabeth, maybe more of a destination place for some, but not for West loopers!   So go check it out, I can't wait to see other reviews!!",0.9295,0.908,0.073,0.019,0.4865333333333334
