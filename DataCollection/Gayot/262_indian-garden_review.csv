2017-08-24,4.0,I have been going to the IG for at least 10 years.  Always very good. The lunch buffet is an excellent option to the burgers etc. also very nice people.  If you are an Indian food novice the lunch buffet is a perfect way to try a variety of Indian dishes.,0.9285,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.836

2017-08-17,4.0,The Indian Garden was a very delightful place for Indian cuisine. I visit mantra often with my friends and I have to say their garlic naan is some of the best naan Chicago has to offer. Every dish I order has a beautiful flavor profile and is made to my preferred spice level. The paneer and chicken dishes are my personal favorite. I've eaten at many Indian restaurants and I just say Indian Garden has a lot to offer! Check them out for awesome food!!,0.9758,0.756,0.244,0.0,0.75625
2017-08-13,1.0,"We had a pretty horrible experience here. I see that many people seem to like this place, so I'm willing to consider that it might have been a fluke.  Our waiter was really unnecessarily rude. One of my companions mispronounced a word, and instead of taking it in stride or politely correcting her, the waiter then assumed that she had never had that item before, and asked who had told her about it. It was a strange assumption to make.  She then tried to ask if she could specify the spice level of her dish. Instead of just saying that that wasn't doable, he told her she must want another dish, but didn't actually explain the ingredients or the difference between the two. She was confused and said she just wanted the item she ordered, with a medium spice level. He said okay, leading us all to think that it was.  Another member of my party asked if their dish (which is a mild dish to begin with when prepared normally) could be made as mild as possible. Again, he easily could have just said that's not doable, but instead laughed at us and rolled his eyes.  When our food did arrive, the first member of my party got a different dish than she requested - the one he had told her she must have wanted. If preparing what she wanted the way she was asking was an issue, he should have told her it wasn't possible, instead of ignoring her and assuming she wanted something she already said she didn't.  Another dish we received (murgh makhni) was horribly, intolerably, salty. It was impossible to taste any other flavors. The person who ordered it was ignored whenever they tried to tell the waiter about it.  Then, he came back over later and told (not asked) my friend that she was done with her drink. He grabbed the glass without waiting on any confirmation from the person, who then had to argue to get her half full drink.  The prices are also ridiculous- vegetarian dishes cost equal amounts as meat dishes, despite this never being the case at abut other Indian restaurants. However on top of that, none of the entrees include rice or bread. You have to order those separately and pay an additional 4-5 on top of an already inflated cost of entrees.  If either the service had been good or the food had been good, I could have justified the cost. But you can't have your waiter treat customers poorly AND serve subpar food AND charge upscale restaurant prices.",0.9639,0.841,0.101,0.058,0.5686274509803922
2017-08-11,3.0,The reviews are pretty much spot on.  It is on the second floor. The stairs are steep. We went at lunchtime on a Friday. They had two buffet lines. The longer one was fir all the vegetarian dishes. I tried them all and they were all good and hot. Fresh hot naan served at your table. You could watch them make the naan through the windows behind the vegetarian line. The left line was the carnivore line. One fish dish. Two chicken dishes. One goat dish. The fish was full of bones so be careful. Two desserts--the milk/rice/almond concoction and the dough balls with a pistachio in the middle that is in a syrupy/honey. Service was just fine. Quick to clear the dishes and keep the water glasses full. The food is on steam tables so it is plenty hot.   The place was clean. The food was good. It was very popular at lunch time. Large groups of people kept coming in. Buffet for the three of us with water to drink was 60 bucks not including tip. Enjoy.,0.9568,0.864,0.122,0.014,0.5744306418219461

2017-08-01,1.0,"Really Bad Service - awful experience! This place deserves negative stars.  There was no assigned server and the servers had no clue about the menu. The drinks that we ordered, never arrived. We were unable to get additional bread/dishes during the meal, as there was no one to take the order; even after asking repeatedly. The lady taking the order refused to call the manager when we wanted to provide a feedback and finally got us a check which was not for our table. The attitude was that the $8 discount at the end makes up for the horrible evening with atrocious service -- they really managed to spoil a family get together.",-0.9696,0.812,0.0,0.188,0.7208333333333333
2017-07-31,1.0,"The only reason I gave this restaurant 1 star is because the app doesn't allow you to give a restaurant negative stars.  We came for a family dinner on a Saturday evening with an 8 PM reservation. The entrance was decorated with traditional gold statues and lotus petals, adding to the overall ambience. The restaurant didn't seem to have waiters or waitresses assigned to table as they were really just fluttering around from table to table. However, they certainly weren't understaffed.  We began by ordering a paneer tikka, bhel puri chaat, and a beer for drinks. The paneer tikka was very dry and the presentation looked as if the food had just been thrown onto the plate. We asked the server for mint and tamarind chutney, as the menu stated they were supposed to be included. Our server just nodded her head and brought it after we reminded her 3 times and we had finished our appetizers. The bhel puri was under seasoned and lacked unity with the seasoning because the vegetables were roughly diced and too chunky for the dish.  For the main course we ordered the black daal, shai paneer, and kofta. The black daal and shai paneer was pretty decent but lacked a sufficient amount of salt. The kofta had become soft but the taste of the gravy was good as the tomato and garam masala added a base to the dish. About halfway through the entrees, we asked a different server for the menu to order another naan (bread) as the ones we had ordered already were finished. This server also just nodded his head and said he would send someone over with a menu. The same thing happened once we asked for onions with yet a third server. After about 20 minutes, no one had come with the menu and we had to eat the rest of the food without any naan.  Once we were 'finished', we called our server for the check and told her that she hadn't brought our drinks, onions, lemons, or menu for another naan. We requested to see the manager as 3 of their servers hadn't gotten our food. She said that there was no need for the manager and that she could take care of it. She even went to say that we hadn't even ordered a beer and that it wasn't on her writing pad. She ended up coming with the cheque with a 10% discount and telling us that she just 'forgot' the beer and that it was in fact on the menu. We opened the bill and told her that she had brought the wrong bill, yet another shocking mistake. The total bill came to $89.90, which wasn't at all worth the trouble.",-0.9133,0.919,0.026,0.055,0.5137238095238095

When asked, was told that they got it from yogurt bucket. Just wish they do better job on not serving spoiled food.  Rice - we had to pay for side of rice, didn't come with the above entrees by default. Most places, rice is served along with entrees.

2017-01-31,3.0,"This review is for DELIVERY only.  I've ordered delivery a few times from Indian Garden because the price is less than some of the other Indian restaurants in the area. The first thing to note is that if you call them, be prepared for awful service. I have gone back and forth between determining if the man on the other end is deaf (I repeat my order multiple times) or just does not care (he is very rude and abrupt). Thankfully, they are now available via Doordash and a few other delivery apps so you do not need to interact with them at all. In addition, if you use the delivery apps, your food will arrive within 30 minutes but calling them will often lead to you waiting 45+ minutes.  Food - the food is delicious and they have a great variety of North Indian dishes. Rice is not included in any order, so remember to order that as well. The samosas are not very oily, something that is common with Indian restaurants. The chicken and lambs are marinated well, remain juicy, and also reheat well (if you have leftovers!). The naan's and roti's are soft - you can tell they are made fresh when you order. Please note that food here is not very spicy. I once requested for the Chicken Tikka to be spicy and it was delivered with pieces of jalapenos (no joke).  Overall, go ahead and place an order. Just do it via a third party service.",0.9794,0.859,0.119,0.022,0.46019999999999994

Still trying to be nice, because we're all humans and make mistakes, we looked over the bill again and found that it was actually their mistake. We asked to see a manager, and she came out, she apologized for the mistake, but told us that we had to leave because we had stayed longer than expected and they needed our table. WTF??!! I go to many different restaurants and I have NEVER had a place tell me that I had to leave. My fiend got so upset that she was on the verge of tears.  First the waiter made a mistake and blamed us. Then when we spoke to the manager, she apologized but told us to Leave. Worst customer service that any of us had ever experienced! The manager told us to email her and we could come back for free drinks. We never did this because when you are treated that way, even if it's free, you never want to go back.

I was the only one there eating by my lonesome and it wasn't too crowded. So the best part of Indian food for me, is naan. I love naan so I was really hoping to have some for lunch. I had already eaten one plate of food from their lunch buffet and your supposed to get a basket of naan since your paying almost $20 for their buffet..well after 20 mins of being there still no naan. I sat and waited 10 more mins..still no naan. Asked the waiter again and he said he'd bring it..10 more minutes got up and asked the lady at the front of the restaurant if I could please get naan. She apologized and said she'd bring it right out for me.  I figure I'd believe her and went up to get my second plate of food, thinking that the naan would be at my table. Nope. so now I've been there 40 mins and a guy comes out with three baskets of naan. and gave a basket to people that are on their second basket of naan and then put the other baskets on empty tables. I'm looking around like REALLY?? I got up for the fourth time and said I've still got no Naan and it's been 20 mins since you didn't refill my water glass. Finally got naan and water after waiting 40 mins. So sat there waiting for my check, of course the waiter didn't come and I didn't want to wait another 10  mins to just be forgotten about. They treated me like I didn't exist. This is my third bad experience here, with their service. Food can be great but I'm never walking foot in this place again.

2016-08-21,1.0,"2 Words - Bad Experience!! We came here on a Sunday for a late lunch - 2-ish. They have a lunch buffet but we did not feel like having a buffet and the options did not seem appealing, so we decided to order ala carte. Buffet consisted same old mutter paneer, pulav, pakora, etc etc. pretty basic. We ordered a dal tadka, a side of rice, saag paneer, naan, raita and masala papad. We were only 3 ppl and yes the food was too much to eat. We waited for a few minutes, and the food was out quickly - not too long. Masala papad was not the conventional - papad was a bit brown than you would normally find (probably fried for a few extra seconds but not burnt), amd the onions, tomatoes were just sprinkled on top like they did not know what to do with it. The papad was all twisted and turned... So no - not what you expect!! The food was kept on the table where they found place to keep it, they were in a hurry to coose coz they close at 3. I took rice and dal - Rice looked stale - a little yellowish brown, broken and dry like you would find a 2 day old rice warmed up. Dal was stale too and spoilt - it was stinking - YOU TASTE YOUR FOOD BEFORE YOU SERVE IT - that is the #1 rule in restaurant business!!! Saag paneer was nothing special. The raita was ""oh so sour""; none of us could eat it - it can numb your senses. The waitress apologized for the dal and gave us free dessert but we couldn't enjoy the dessert coz of the experience. Overall, it was like they did not want to cook food and serve coz it was too late for lunch.

The entrees don't come with rice so you actually have to order it and pay for it separately, which I think is silly considering most other places will include rice for free.  The food was okay in my opinion. We asked for extra spicy but it didn't pack much flavor or heat. I think the flavor palate has been adjusted from traditional Indian to blander favors to better suit the patrons. If you're looking for super tasty and spicy Indian food, then you might want to consider going elsewhere. This place is good if you're looking for a more Americanized Indian food experience.  The people were friendly but it took half an hour more than they had previously estimated to have my order ready. I didn't dine in however I did like the decor and ambiance of the place.

He apologized for missing my first email and he invited us to the restaurant for a dinner. ========================== We placed a catering order with India Garden for a party at our home with 20 guests. We ordered 3 appetizers, a couple main courses, breads and rice and dessert. We also paid for a catering service which included delivery, a catering helper and serving dishes.  Pros:  - The manager was helpful in helping us pick out a menu - Pricing is reasonable - The food was above average Cons: - Quantities provided were abysmally small. Both main courses ran out and this was not something that we could solve for during the dinner. This was after 2-3 family members did not eat in order to try to get our guests to have sufficient portions - I emailed the manager to share our disappointment in the serving sizes.

First it took a while for anyone to even come to our table (the restaurant was maybe 25% full), then when we finally ordered they messed up a couple things. We asked for no butter on the naan and asked for a serving of rice. Naan came out buttered and the rice didn't come out at all until we reminded them after about 10-15 minutes of waiting. Then when the bill came we were double charged for the rice, which was ironic. As for the food itself it was subpar. The chicken tikka was pretty good and the naan and samosas were great. However the paneer makhani was bad. It just tasted like they put cheese in presto tomato sauce or something (as an Indian I can tell you that's not how it's made haha). To top it all off I woke up the next morning feeling absolutely terrible with stomach issues.  I will say that the manager was accommodating when we expressed our displeasure and even offered us dessert on the house, but at that point we just wanted to get out of there.

2016-05-04,4.0,"Please excuse me as I'm catching up on some older reviews. This place is such a treat in such a large city. On a weekend getaway with some friends, we craved some Indian cuisine. Lucky us, this place had a lunch special we could not refuse. After walking all morning and visiting touristy attractions, we certainly worked up an appetite. This location is a bit tricky as it's not storefront and could easily be missed. You'll walk through a set of doors and enter a plain white environment. You'll then turn to a stairwell and walk up a flight of stairs since this restaurant is on a second floor of another building. But once you enter the doors of The Indian Garden you're immediately taken into another culture. The place is decorated top down. Walls are painted and cracked to give you that clay-like mural look. Accents of gold and red hues left and right. The entire room is basically one big rectangle, but the space is used perfectly. Buffet style containers line the wall with names of each dish. It's really well done. While there were more than 15 different dishes to choose from, I sampled the ones I was not familiar with. Each plate I loaded 4 different variations with Basmati rice in the middle. Each bite is amazingly flavorful and to be honest, once you start eating so many different dishes on one plate, they started mending together on taste. Indian food is very flavorful and potent. Out of all the ones I tried, the best would have to be the Chili Mushroom. It had such a savory kick to it. The mushrooms were fresh and the spice level was perfect. Just to the point of ""makeyousweatbutnotreallyimfineitsnotthathothahaha."" My advice for future guests, try having two items on a plate with rice separating them. Give yourself time to really try and taste every flavor. Oh and the Na'an bread. They do an AWESOME job bringing our fresh bread. Don't be afraid to gobble that up and ask for more. It's the perfect thing to have to clean your plate! This was a perfect lunch spot. You're able to try so many different kinds of dishes you're not accustomed to. If you're weary on trying Indian cuisine, this place will have you hooked.

You can put together a decent lunch.  I would never order goat, but at the buffet I tried it twice -- some was tender, some was not, so I still don't know if I like it. They should rotate the rice more frequently so it doesn't dry out. The desserts are COMPLETELY forgettable. Everything is labeled--that's helpful. Staff is sometimes friendly, but not always. I like the decor here, big plate glass windows, lots of light and lots of Indian accents. Points for that. Choose wisely at the lunch buffet and you'll be OK much of the time. Vegetarians welcome.

2015-09-05,4.0,"This is a good restaurant, but it has its quirks.  However, if you are in the area and looking for Indian food, you will probably be happy with this choice. As a local, I am surprised there are not more Indian restaurants in the loop area.  In fact, my normal ""go to"" place closed about six months ago.  So I was interested to sample this again since I hadn't been here since many years ago.  So here is my view.  I ordered the Eggplant dish, Baigan Bharta, and it was just delicious.  I found it mildly spicy, but very tasty.  I would definitely order it again.  My dining companion ordered Shrimp Bhuna, and I found it very tasty as well.  The rice is a separate al a carte item here, so we ordered one rice between us and that was sufficient for us.  However, you are missing something if you don't order the naan (bread).  I had the garlic naan and I loved it.  The other bread we ordered was Kandhari Naan which included pistachios and almonds - it was just as good. Truly, the food is good here and I think you will be pleased with it. The service is adequate and functional, but I would not call it warm.  As one other reviewer commented, ""They do the job.""  I agree with this assessment.  The water person kept my glass full which is essential in a restaurant serving spicy food.  You will do well with the water.  I ordered Iced Tea and my dining companion ordered Mango Lassi.  I was not offered a refil on my iced tea and I suspect they don't do refills - not sure on that.  Therefore my recommendation would be that you forego the drinks and stick with water which will be in abundance. Now let's talk about the atmosphere.  The restaurant is on the second floor and there are quite a few steps to climb to get up to The Indian Garden.  I have bad knees and I really had to take my time but I made it and I would do it again.  However, if you are handicapped or otherwise need assistance for stairs, you may want to make another choice.  Also, it was 82 degrees outside and I was rather surprised they were dependent on open windows for ventilation.  I suspect their air conditioning may not have been functional, but it was a humid evening and noticeable.  One might observe that it added to the Asian subcontinent atmosphere through environment - but I am being nice.  It was hot and I wish the air conditioning had been on. All in all, the most important thing, the food, was so good, any other shortcomings were worth being overlooked.  If the restaurant would make some improvements in their experience through things they can control, e.g. more attentive service and air temperature, I think that I would have given them a higher rating.  But it is a winner with respect for the food.   So my line for this restaurant is ""Go for the food, not the experience.""  ;-)",0.9969,0.804,0.158,0.038,0.523641975308642

But I feel I needed to write this to forewarn people before they go to this place. Many Chicagoans and foreigners might like the food but what they are liking is the idea of Indian food which in it's essence is spectacular. However the execution of the idea by this restaurant has been appalling. If this food was an ambassador of India then people out here have been fed lies since it's inception. We tried 3 appetizers and one dessert. Let me begin with the Paneer Tikka (Cottage cheese). We paid $18 for something that tasted like an eraser, we could have got a cheaper one at staples. Paneer is supposed to be soft and melt in your mouth. The Chandni Chowk Aloo Tikki sounds and looks great in theory however in practice it was a mash of bullshit. The pattie was terrible and lazily prepared. The samosas were mediocre at best, however no where close to how it is supposed to be. I forgot about the poppadum, it was not fully cooked and had corners which were raw not roasted. However the cook was more generous with the Gulab Jamun (dessert.) Probably too generous because he burnt the dish. And the server had the audacity to bring the burnt dish to our table and   place it there in a nonchalant manner. The service was alright.

There are many stairs to go up and the elevator is there yet hidden and not easy to use.   Second, if you are going for the buffet it is best to go when they first open.  What they do is make huge trays of food and leave it until it is nearly empty or empty.  If you arrive after 130 for a buffet that lasts until 300 generally you will be getting food that has been sitting there since the restaurant first opened.  Perhaps they can make smaller portions and replenish the food more often for freshness? Third, it would be best to train their valet and ensure that they are available for a full shift.  Valet is $12.  A previous post said it was $10. The valet came up to our table during our meal and asked if we were leaving as he needed to go and do something for 20 minutes.  I understand emergencies come up, however there should be a back up valet to help.  Why would we be rushed out of a restaurant when we are trying to enjoy our meal?   We said that is fine that we are not in a hurry.  Yet, after 20 minutes the valet is there at our table again handing us the key to our car.  In the restaurant.  And, still charging us the $12 and lacking politeness.  I don't blame the man, although I wish he had a much better attitude for customers in the way he spoke to us.  It is the responsibility of the valet service to have back up personnel in place.

The wait staff is friendly, prompt, and courteous, and the dining room is charmingly furnished with brocaded pillows and fresh flowers. The parking garage construction out the window is not exactly a great view, and I'd suggest the restaurant add some blinds to their massive picture windows. Still, while this would be an obvious improvement, the unfortunate view did not detract from the food. On my last visit, we sampled their samosas, keema naan (stuffed with minced lamb), chicken tikka masala, and lamb rogan josh with a side of basmati rice. Dinners also come with a heaping selection of chutneys and papadums (that crispy flat bread). Everything we tried was tasty, although the rogan josh was a bit greasy while the keema naan was spicier than I had anticipated.  I particularly loved the tikka masala and vegetable samosas. It is pretty expensive, though. $14.95 for an entree that pretty much requires that you order a side dish as neither rice nor bread are included is a bit high for Indian food. The Indian Garden does have a welcoming decor and staff, but there are surely better values in town. I have yet to find one in Streeterville, though --especially one so close to the AMC.

Really liked the eggplant pakora, potato fritter, and mango chutney for my appetizers. Naan bread came quickly to the table.  The chicken curry was the pick of the main courses - fall-off-the-fork chicken with a creamy sauce. I tend to prefer lamb, but thought the lamb rogan josh a little bland in comparison. As for vegetarian options, the lentil curry was very flavorful. My least favorite curry was the paneer in a tomato sauce, which was too much like soup for my liking. Overall, a great atmosphere and very good selection of food. If I am in the area again, will definitely go back.",0.9693,0.786,0.18,0.034,0.5615686274509804

I was a bit disappointed with the experience here though. The service is fantastic - everyone is smiling, the ambience is expected, albeit a little stodgy and clunky. There is a great variety of foods, but it's more vegetarian-friendly than I'm used to. I would say there were more vegetarian dishes than there were meat dishes, which is great except that the flavors were just missing some. The desserts tasted off, like spoiled milk, and for the prices they charge for a lunch buffet, I think I may try this place one more time but won't be returning frequently. However, take this review with a grain of salt, because my Indian compadres that I went with love this place more than other Indian buffets they've been to in Chicago. As vegetarians, they really appreciate the number of dishes and the flavor more than anywhere else. The only thing they complained about were the desserts.

It was to my dismay to return to find that I had a groupon collecting dust, soon to expire. From the get-go we were met by an indifferent and confused maitre'de. We were told a twenty-five minute wait, while ten minutes later, a fellow was told it was an hour. I'm sure our wait would've been substantially longer if people hadn't walked out in frustration. Once we were finally seated, our server was MIA after nibbling through all of our papadum.  The only reason why this place gets bumped up to 3 stars is the food. My favorites were the murg sagwala and garlic naan. The tandoori chicken was a little too dry for my liking.  If I have a hankering for Indian, I'll do carry-out.

NOW i understand from my own experience this place has the potential to be amazing but the consistency is lacking so badly it just may not bloom into a staple in our indian cuisine rotation.  we were welcomed with friendliness and smiles and open arms which promptly disappeared after we flashed a membership card that touts a discount; i donate to an organization that shows me some love for showing some love including a 1 time deal to dine at indian garden and receive $12 off our meal, ANYTIME, excluding buffet - easy being this place is just about as pricey as i've seen indian dining get and we were going for dinner after buffet hours. we had no idea it was restaurant week, but since our order was similar to the prix-fixe mix we asked if we could apply this discount to the fixe-prix offer and our server said, ""let me check"" and came back a moment later saying ""NO"" with kid mittens. which we were totally OK with. so we ordered saag paneer to share, rice, keema samosas, naan. (TYPICAL OF US: depending on how filled we felt after splitting first round, we would've either added another entree eventually, or dessert, or a masala coffee.) and after we placed our order the server came back and asked for our membership card and rewards brochure and took it away to be analyzed at the managers conspiracy round table. then the MANAGER came back to dictate to us some FALSE fine print made up on the spot. he said we had to order two entrees to get the discount. the discount clearly states: ""ANYTIME, VALUE TO $12; EXCLUDES BUFFET, ONLY ONE MEMBERSHIP CARD MAY BE USED PER TABLE"".  we were not as irritated about ordering another entree as we were about the dishonoring the discount and about it being the third time returning to our table with some garbage excuse on why. for the first time this year we were a SLIVER away from walking away from this place and going somewhere else. when i offer my charity, i don't tell the receivers that they can only apply my charity if xy+z=a/b-c. indian garden agreed to print their charity in some brochure and now they want to be indian givers about it?  we stayed, begrudgingly though at this point. they serve poppadums with tamarind, mint, and apricot chutneys. after about 10 mins apparently the appetizers were ready so the server came to clear our table of the plates and chutneys.... but LEFT THE PLATES teetering on the corner of our table?! WHY?! we felt neglected at this point. then our keema samosas were brought to us. Caleb swallowed his whole within seconds and was ogling mine already. i may eat as slow as a snail, but the waiter snatched my plate while i was in midbite and maybe half finished! they snatched it before Caleb could even attempt to peck at it himself! apparently the entree was ready even though we weren't. we felt devalued at this point. then the saag and mutter paneer dishes were brought out with the rice and naan. together we ate maybe half of the saag and a quarter of the mutter and were full. we really didnt need the second dish. i am 99% sure they used canned peas in their dish - it has a distinct taste i hate. if you are going to call yourself fine indian cuisine please use frozen or fresh! we pecked some more at the saag just to finish it off.... and we agreed, the saag is probably one of the best we've ever had. the mutter however, surprisingly sat in our fridge a few days before we attempted another go at it.  i don't care how good a restaurant's food may be - poor service,  haggling prices, and ethically challenged principles will keep us from stepping foot in their door again!",0.9977,0.795,0.149,0.056,0.46455538996522616

2011-12-28,3.0,"This place is not as good as it used to be :( The first time i came here was in Jan 2010. Although the service was spotty, the food was impeccable! I still remember the bf and i ordered dinner plates combos. the portions were so huge and we had leftovers that lasted 3 days! The food was also so well spiced, it was heated up the right temperature and it was not overly spicy, nor oily. Fast forward 2 days ago. We decided to go in on christmas after exploring the Willis tower ( which is a must btw!) It was really packed only a half hour after opening. We served and seated immediately. Our server, who was very nice , took our order and we were excited to get some indian food! First of all, it took 25 min for the appiteizer to arrive! I could not believe it and mid-waiting i had half a mind to leave. We got the ""dahi puri"" appy, which was their version of chaat. It consisted of multiple layers- chickpea curry, yogurt and fried chip type things. It was very filling and an average rated dish at the most. Entree-  the bf got rogan josh ( lamb curry). From my understanding, indian food is meant to be shared. So, when we saw his rogan josh curry, i was surprised because it was enough for one person. Small portions when your paying 16$ for an entree, is not acceptable. PLUS, unlike other indian places, their entree DOES NOT come with naan/roti or rice. I have NEVER seen this happen before- they always give basmati rice. ( Which btw is 4$ extra) I got the meat combo plate- tandoori fish, chicken, sheeh kabab, naan, rice and a veg curry. I was kinda dissapointed in the veg curry because it was pretty much the same chickpea curry that was in my appiteizer. The kabab was okay, but the tandoori fish and chicken were drier than a post menopausal woman. Ive never needed so much water to push down the chicken and fish. They were spiced pretty okay, but were not succulent meat pieces that im used to at other indian places. This combo plate was the only thing i think that was worth the money (21$) NOT because of the TASTE ( which was average) but because of the amount of food.  Besides the food, the ambiance is sweet, romantic. There are candles on the table, dim lights, the whole shebang.  The area is neat and the bathrooms are clean and well stocked. The owner came around from table to table making small talk, which i thought was nice. Parking- very hard to find , so brace yourself, Overall, i think i may give it another chance.

However, one thing I cannot stand is dishonesty.  I call this dishonesty stealing.   Our waiter was nice to add sodas that we did not drink, added an extra side that we did not order and was nice enough to upgrade our rice to the more expensive order.  I agreed to the rice, but not knowing that it was $4 more and after he took the menu.  Would you really question the difference and look cheap by asking?  Most people won't...that's what they bank on. I take part blame for that and recognize that I fell for the slick move to upgrade.   I didn't bring up the Naan because we ate it thinking that it was just a bigger order of bread.  So the total of the bill was added/padded by $8.50.  It's not the amount, it's the principle.  I asked another person that worked there and could hear this person say under her breath ""Again?!?!

2011-11-15,1.0,"I have never been here, but after an attempt to organize a lunch for my job here, I am now positive that I will never eat at this restaurant.  I called the restaurant to ask for more information about their lunch buffet since I needed to organize a lunch for about 50 students. I have read reviews, and also been to their website, which is poorly designed but did mention that their lunch buffet is 13.95/person. Pretty cheap for the area, I thought. And the location would be perfect, since I was looking for a more downtown/central place.  After talking to the manager or whoever picked up the phone, he assured that they had enough space for more than 50 people - actually he mentioned something about their facility can hold 100 people. To confirm, I asked him how much is the buffet. Before I could even finish my sentence, he said: ""It's 20 dollars per person."" ""Oh, ok. But on your website it says the buffet is only 13.95"" ""Yeah yeah but you have a big group. I have to hold the table for you."" ""I'm sorry, I'm just a bit confused. What do you mean hold the table? ""We HAVE TO hold the tables for you. We can't use the table for other customers."" ""Uhmmm sure, but we'll make a reservation and show up on time. And I'm not sure why it says 13.95 online?"" ""That is for walk in customers only. If you have a big group we will have to hold the tables for you and can't use it for other people."" ""Yes, I understand, but we will pay for everyone in our group."" At this point, I wasn't even sure it was worth it arguing with him. I might not understand this correctly, but I've planned many lunches before, and never have anyone raised their prices by 6 bucks (that is 50%) because a big group is coming. I wasn't asking him to hold the ENTIRE restaurant for me, and from what he said, we'd most likely be occupy less than half the capacity.  Moreover, he was really rude and short on the phone. I felt like I was bordering him the whole time and he kept cutting me off before I finished my sentences.  So instead of asking him about his experience in the restaurant industry and more importantly, customer service.

It may be because I have had my palette spoiled by the excellent Indian cuisine in England available but this place doesn't cut the mustard. It doesn't even cut paper. The taste and the creaminess texture of the curry was missing. This part is key for a curry to taste good and work well with the naan and rice. It was a bit too watery for my taste. I haven't tried many Indian foods in Chicago and there are some reasonable places on Devon but this doesn't stack up to that. My Indian friends also agree that US Indian food isn't up to scratch.

One thing that stands out from other buffets is that this one separates out the meat dishes from the vegetarian dishes. They are at completely different stations (though both included in the same buffet price).  I found this extremely helpful as it allowed me to better gauge my options before loading my plate (I love buffets for their variety, but rarely eat more than a single plate).  I think this would also be very helpful for vegetarians. The food itself was very flavorful.  There were plenty of the standard dishes as well as a few unique things, such as a tandoori chicken and mango salad. The veg and meat dishes had a very nice amount of spice- plenty to provide heat but not enough to require me to engage in over-active carb consumption to counteract their powers.  I was in heaven. The decor is also wonderful.  It wasn't your standard hole in the wall, nor was it your standard nondescript white linens restaurant.  The decor was vibrant and rich, a perfect setting for a date night, meal with friends or simple escape from the office.

I returned with another guest for the buffet. She loved it, and I thought it was average.

2011-02-22,3.0,"Restaurant review Craving curry... you will not be disappointed in Streeterville. There are so many different Indian buffets to choose from including this establishment. I have only been to the lunch buffet and honestly for someone that likes curry but couldn't name the different types or variation of indian dishes, the lunch buffet is good enough. It is $11.95 for lunch which includes a wide spread of dishes including the chicken tikka masala. There have been many variations of this dish since I first visited this restaurant from the generous chucks of dark meat chicken to the cheaply shreaded version. Nevertheless they have your spread of spinach curry w/ cheese and multiple other vegetable curry dishes. Service is average (waiters requiring prompting if you want more naan). Dessert is your typical flare of rice pudding and fried donut in syrup. All and all slightly above average for the price. P.S. you also get a serving of tandoori chicken with your meal Pro: occasionally good chicken tikki masala depending on which version they are serving Cons: busy restaurant, average wait staff, selection of food is slightly less than other indian buffets around this area Hidden gem: Northwestern University ID nets you 10% off your lunch/dinner bill.

But, on one particular evening I was struggling for something that would completely impress a 17 year old boy from Oregon that did not involve skateboards, snowboards, video games, or illicit drugs....so I hit up GROUPON! I had a $30 Groupon that I purchased for $15. Love that! Anyhow, I met Mr. Tommy (Significant others' younger brother...) at the Capital Grill where I was predrinking prior to our ""date."" We walked down to the Indian Garden and were pleasantly surprised with the eclectic decor. It was awesome.

Also it seems to be a pattern that in Chicago, you pay extra for rice in Indian restaurants, which seems strange to me (all the Indian restaurants I've been to in other cities have offered unlimited rice for free). I mean, how much does it cost to make rice--probably pennies. But, oh well.  All in all, great meal, nice setting. I will definitely be back.",0.965,0.79,0.14,0.07,0.603422619047619

Indeed as some reviewers point out their entrance is quiet.  It's not a large store front marquee but after a quick set of stairs you enter a very welcoming Indian restaurant.  The décor was quite nice, authentic feeling but not cheesy which is easy to do.  I saw everything from a shirt and tie to shorts and t-shirts. Their bathroom was very nice too.  I don't like bowl sinks but I know they are classy.  A nice decor and very clean.  They even had a little seat you could put down for a child.  The handle to get out of the bathroom was a bit odd though as it was just a small screw on handle from a hardware store. I'd like to warn you that they do not cater to American attitudes on service.  Our waiter didn't bring us a check until we asked.  Our first idea in America is that our server is poor.  I'd remind you that in many parts of the world it's considered rude to rush a dinner guest.  Our waiter was always nearby and all it took was a polite glance and he was at our table side.  They have an extensive menu and I look forward to trying more in the future but here's three things my girlfriend and I tried along with a reasonably priced glass of wine.  We tried the Papad Rolls from the appetizer menu.  They had a wonderfully crispy yet not oily fried wrapper. The interior had a nice potato with other veggies.  It wasn't land mark food but it was tasty and something different.  It was great with the Raita from the accompaniments, a chilled yogurt with slices of tomato and cucumber.  Alone it was a bit tart for my likes but worked great as a sauce.  I guess that is why they call it an accompaniment.  I saved the best for last; the house special shrimp.  The rice wasn't cooked very well in my opinion but the sauce was good enough to buy and drink!  The shrimp tasted of a marinade of fresh basil and bay leaf as they were added to the sauce fresh before serving.  There were whole bay leaves that while you wouldn't normally eat were perfectly tasty.  The shrimp weren't cooked perfectly or poorly but their flavor was fantastic. All in all India Garden offered a nice atmosphere, a huge menu, an authentic feel,   and great prices.  I'll certainly be back the next time I'm in the market for Indian food.  Besides, I left way to much of that menu untasted (incidentally, I make up a lot of words) Prost, Cheers, Salud, Bon Appetit, and all those great wishes!",0.9992,0.72,0.245,0.036,0.5324478657543175

These were very carefully prepared --- not too greasy, not bland, and quite tasty and delicious.  I learned from them that the fish dish is supposed to be enjoyed with rice, so that came with it, whereas the chicken dish we could choose either rice or bread --- we opted for naan, which was the puffiest naan I have had! it was quite decadent actually.  The complimentary papadams (savory fried crackers) and chutneys (sauces to go with that) were great appetizers as well. On top of it, the wait staff was very friendly, letting us choose the remaining table or to wait for another table (we picked the one that was there, which was well located), and letting us stay until closing time while continuing to refill our water as we chatted.  The decor seemed a bit excessive at first, but it was comfortable and the ambiance was pleasant.  Finally, the prices were not expensive at all, especially given the quality --- we paid about $20 each.

2010-03-10,5.0,"Brace yourself for an Indian Garden lovefest. This post is long! My first experience at the IG was most likely motivated by gluttonous curiosity at their $12 lunch buffet (11a-2p, all-you-can-eat, beverage included, and they put down complimentary sizzling Tandoori Chicken and fresh naan at your table). The lunch buffet is a great way to try out different dishes without wondering if you've ordered the wrong thing, and best of all, its QUICK! Go in, get seated, grab a plate, stuff yourself, wait 10 minutes, stuff yourself some more, pay your bill, and then slowly saunter out of the building in a walking food coma. Upon entering, you see the attention to detail that has been put into decorating the place (through the many statues, colors, choice of furniture, and large picture windows), which all leads to a very pleasant and engaging ambiance.  The owners Anu and Arun are awesome (Anu will probably give you a big hug once she gets to know you), and they're very involved in making sure customers leave happy. The manager Joseph and hostess Jenny are great also, and always greet us with huge warm smiles when we visit.  I'm a seafood fan, so when we go for dinner I always order their shrimp tandoori (HUGE tiger prawns) and their amazing lobster curry, served with white rice. My wife usually gets the Murg (chicken) Vindaloo, because she loves spicy foods. And believe me, the vindaloo is HOT!  I suggest ordering a mango lassi and sipping it intermittently during spicy dishes.  If it's your first time going for dinner and you're unsure of what to get, I would suggest trying out one of their specials (the Tandoori mixer is pretty good, you get samples of tandoori-ed chicken, lamb, shrimp, some naan, and some other scrum-diddly-umptious foods). If you can finish that special in one sitting, God bless you. That's a lot of food. All in all, my wife and I love Indian Garden. Since my first visit many years ago, I've been back more times than I can remember for both lunch and dinner, and its my default place to bring out-of-town guests. The food is great, the place is lovely, and the people there make you feel like they're truly glad you stopped by.

I work about 3 blocks from here.  They do the lunch buffet, but I needed something I could eat at my desk so I ordered take out.  I ordered a vegetarian entree and a side of rice.  I have to say I was a bit surprised when I picked it up and it was $20!  Partly my own fault as I didn't look at prices or a menu when I ordered (I eat Indian food fairly often). The food was good (but not amazing) so I can't complain about the quality.  Part of the problem is they don't have a 'side' of rice so they gave me enough rice to feed a family.   I realize most Indian restaurants charge seperately for rice, but usually you can get a single portion.  What am I supposed to do with a pound of rice?!  Not to mention, it's not as if the entree portion was so generous that I'll get multiple meals out of it. Probably a decent place to go for dinner in the area, but I definately wouldn't recommend it for a take-out lunch.",0.7851,0.855,0.086,0.059,0.5442460317460318

I've eaten at a smattering of places up on devon, and this place puts them all to shame in my book. Everything here is solid, I don't think you can go wrong with a single dish. Of course some things are better than others, and it also comes down to personal taste, but if you like Indian food, you'll love this place.  Oh and not that it's that important in comparison to the food, but the atmosphere is very nice also. Quiet, peaceful, elaborate decorations, with a decently interesting view of the street below. As I said the food is pretty solid, I used to go with my standard chicken tikka masala and saag paneer, which are great here, but then started branching out to discover that the other dishes are just as good. In fact I think the chicken badami might be my new favorite dish. Soft, succulent chicken that practically melts in your mouth in an ""almond sauce,"" which has a strong butter/cream flavor, not completely unlike Alfredo sauce. Possibly the best savory sauce I've ever tasted in my life. Also the gulab jamun (pastry soaked in syrup) is very good, and the rasmalai (""cottage cheese"" soaked in a sweet milk/cream, my personal favorite) is the best I've ever had.

2010-02-09,2.0,"A year ago I would have given an extra star but it seems there is some cost-cutting going on nowadays. I have never set foot inside the restaurant but have sampled their wares often in the past, thanks to my trusty keyboard and the folks at  diningin.com . The order would usually be in the $80 range: a standing order for Lamb Vindaloo (Indian Hot), Chicken Tikka (or CT Masala), a posse of Papadums and several cubic yards of basmati rice. The papadums would come with huge bowls of blow-your-head-off salad, which would induce coughing, choking, knee-slapping, eye watering and howling- fantastic!! I used to joke that the lamb vindaloo had only the one chunk of potato to qualify the ""aloo"" part of the name. It was 95% percent a meat dish, in a volcanic lip-smacking sauce and hit the spot. The food was delightful but the service was a crap-shoot. After waiting an hour for delivery we'd find that the papdums were back at the ranch and the meal would have to go cold while we waited for another driver. Sometimes they omitted to pack an entree with the same result. They were forgiven as once all in the same room at the same time the dishes began to dance and sing. Of late the attention to detail hasn't improved and the ""aloo"" is now the predominant partner as the meat percentage shrinks. I could live with that if it was the same meat as of yore,  but when you have six chunks of meat and you find yourself suffering jaw-ache as you chew, and chew and chew and finally spit the thing out in a napkin....it's an appetite killer. Ratio is about 66% ( with 5% margin of error) lamb in the tummy, 33% in the napkin on it's way to the landfill. Some nasty cuts of meat, with sinew, fat, gristle, trying to remain incognito under a tasty thick sauce. We have gone back to Gaylord (which we left when they closed for their move to Walton St) where we pay considerably more but are well rewarded with quality produce.",0.8624,0.839,0.092,0.069,0.4644230769230769

2009-11-08,4.0,"Summary: I wanted to give Indian Garden 5 stars for the food and ambience, but I have to strike it back to 4 for lackluster service. Quick note: the only way to get to this restaurant is up several flights of stairs. May not be accessible to the handicapped, elderly or people with health issues. Ambience was of a quality I never see at a Devon Indian restaurant. Many ingenious uses of candles, great view from window-front tables, a very comfortable place to wait for your table with pillows and magazines to read. Indian nick-nacks and musical instruments everywhere, nice statuary. I felt instantly at ease. Food was all excellent: temperature hot, well prepared, and properly Indian spicy. We had mango lassi and masala chai to drink. Appetizers were amazing: mirchi pakora and paneer pakora, both pakoras are frequently not on other restaurants' menus. Our entrees where the Bombay Kadhai Gosht and Paneer Bhurji. Just delicious. Kudos to the kitchen. The downside was the service. We didn't seem to be assigned a single waiter. Somebody always came by to fill up on our water except for a long gap when we got no more water. A lady who appeared to be the owner or manager stopped by early in our meal to see how we were doing. Wait staff, whenever they came by, seemed lifeless and uninterested in what they were doing. Nobody smiled. They took my empty chai cup and never inquired if I might have wanted more chai. No wait staff ever seemed to want to stay at our table a single instant longer than they absolutely had to. Maybe the weird service has something to do with the credit card slips. There is no separate line for tips on the credit card printout. Maybe the waiters get stiffed on tips as a result? Bathrooms seem dirty and unmaintained, in contrast to the remainder of the restaurant. When we are at Navy Pier next and looking for an alternative to the usual boring chains at the Pier, we will come back to Indian Gardens, but for the food not the service.

We were helped promptly, but the waiters were not especially friendly and the food was not on par with other Indian restaurants I've been to, in Chicago or elsewhere. I love Indian food, and we seem to eat it in almost every city we visit, so I am not a newbie to the cuisine, and this was just a disappointment. My friend and I eat Indian food regularly, and neither of us had ever had our dishes quite so spicy without directly asking for it. The waiter did not ask either of us if we wanted it spicy or mild, and in most Indian restaurants, if they don't ask, they prepare it in a mild-medium level. I am pretty good with spicy foods, but my paneer makhani (my favorite dish in the world) was almost inedible. My friend went with a relatively fool-proof dish of chicken tikka masala, and it was also firey hot. No one at the table ordered anything spicy specifically, aside from my fiance, who had lamb vindaloo which was only a shade or two hotter than my paneer and my friend's chicken. Additionally, I was not impressed by the fact I was not offered a refill on my soda, which seems like a standard when you charge $2.00+ for a glass of soda that is mostly ice.  I'd like to think they were just irritated that people came in off the street just a half hour before closing and that is why our food was so off, but in a city with so many great Indian restaurants, I won't be going back to find out.",0.9733,0.81,0.126,0.063,0.5128944773175542

I once listened to NPR once and a piece describes that after age 47, most people that age stop exploring new food and new music.  With that nugget of information, I was glad to pop my Indian restaurant cherry at Indian Garden. We had a table of about 10 or 12 people and the entire restaurant was very ornate with Indian art on the walls. In the waiting area there are plenty of seats, a coatcheck, along with a bar should you feel like imbibing. After being seated, we checked out the menu and ate the bread appetizer that they served up quickly. I ordered some Aloo Tikka and Seekh Kabob and a giant bottle of Kingfisher. The service was great and my water glass was never empty no matter how much water I drank. The Aloo Tikka is a fried potato dish and was so tasty that I did not bother to share any with anyone else at the table. Some other people at the table ordered some appetizer and ordered too much and I was able to dip my bread and eat some more. The Seekh Kabob was excellent and nicely charred. The meat wasn't chewy or bony and was marinated to a state of deliciousness that I must learn how to cook. I have a greater interest of learning how to cook Indian cuisine thanks to Indian Garden.

He recommended the $16.95 House Specialty plate which included more entrees than the RW menu had. He said it would be a great way to try a lot of things - sold! We spent some time translating the RW menu from the regular menu, so we new what to expect. We had the #4 appetizer (fried potato and veggie rolls) and then a cart full of deliciousness. Lamb curry, chicken & mahi served on a steaming platter, this delicious pea/tomato sauce dish, naan, and basmati rice. Freaking perfect! I could not have asked for a better sampling of food.

Unfortunately after having moved away to the desert, great Indian food is impossible to find. I decided to try this place, the decor and overall environment is stunning. You can tell that most of the items came from India and/or neighboring countries. The waiters were extremely polite and courteous, unfortunately the party I was with wasn't as interested in the food as I was.  Based on their fear of ""heat"" they mentioned repeatedly they wanted their food mild. Ha ha. I sampled the Murghi Makhani with chicken breast cubes and holy God, it tasted phenomenal, I ordered Tandoori Naan and ate happily. Unfortunately my other party members could barely down their food, they ordered the tikka chicken and chicken biryani- which I sampled, I must add delicious.  I think a suggestion could be to add either a naan/roti or some basmati rice as a side to some of their main entrees, and possibly mention the heat factor of foods so customers aren't terrified or have a bad experience.
