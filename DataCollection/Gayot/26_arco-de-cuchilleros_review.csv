But while it could do with a makeover, the food was amazing. I will definitely come back just for that.  We had the avocado and shrimp, and the eggplant with goat cheese for appetizers. Both were well flavoured and seasoned. My top picks for the evening were the beef tenderloin and the crepe with apple and goat cheese. Defintely get the dessert here, that was what most people seemed to be ordering. We had the honey pecan tart, which comes with caramel on the side. The caramel was too sweet for me, but the pecan tart was delish, comes with chocolate too for the cacao lovers. We also had the half sangria, which is the just right quantity for 2 people, who don't want to be under the table post dinner  I would say the place is good value for money, we paid about 50 for the whole meal, for 2 people.",0.8557,0.865,0.095,0.039,0.47874149659863946

A group of 9 of us made a reservation for 9:00pm, and were not out of this restaurant until midnight due to the terrible service. Firstly, the waitress took forever to take our order. Secondly, somehow communication between our waitress and the cooks went haywire and we didn't receive our food until over an hour later. And our dishes came out in very spaced out times. When I say spaced, I mean we would finish one tapa and have to wait another half hour before the next came out. I don't even remember what we ordered because we were all so pissed about the service. The manager came out to talk to us, apologized, and somehow STILL there was miscommunication between our waitress and the cooks. We were waiting on our last tapa and the waitress had thought we already received it...TERRIBLE. To top it off, they ""kindly"" gave us a 15% off deal for our next visit. I wanted to laugh out loud.

My last visit had literally been 4 or more years ago, and indeed I did recognize at least a couple people still working from the old days. Unfortunately that is really all I recognized. The food is generally ok, but many of the old dishes that I loved are gone or have been retooled with not the greatest success. The prices are still fairly reasonable, but the portion sizes also seem to have decreased. We had 5 dishes (shrimp with chili flakes, potatoes allioli, lamb, empanadas, and bacon-wrapped dates), and all were decent but only the lamb and empanadas stood out as really being prepared nicely with bold flavors. In addition there were some facilities problems during our visit. Mind you this was a cold, cold, cold Saturday night in January, but there were major temperature fluctuations in the back of the restaurant even though we were well away from the front door. Also there was a constant leak dripping water from the ceiling onto a rag near our table. A couple of times my arm got splashed with water from a source I would not like to think about. The visible microwaves in the kitchen (noted in several other reviews) are also a constant source of distraction when thinking of how your food is being prepared.

2013-01-17,2.0,"I'm a big fan of tapas and even willing to shell out when they're good, but Tapas Gitana was a disappointment. I arrived a little before our 7:00 reservation, and the manager couldn't find my name in his ledger. I can't entirely blame him for this confusion, because I had canceled our reservation one week earlier and rescheduled for that night. Still, I went through the proper process for this and confirmed the new reservation. Nevertheless, he actually went to the trouble of locating my first reservation email as if to prove that the lost reservation wasn't his fault (""See? That's why I don't have your reservation--it was for last week""). I pulled up the correct confirmation to prove to myself that the error was THEIRS and not mine. The lost reservation meant we were seated in the back room, which was cold (this was in November). A table of four near us kept their coats on for their entire meal. For drinks, I ordered a pitcher of white sangria. The waiter brought out red, and I didn't bother correcting him. It was still very good, just not what I ordered. We tried the oven baked goat cheese (queso de cabra al horno), the avocado filled with shrimp (Aguacate relleno), seafood stew (Menestra de Mariscos), grilled jumbo sea scallops (Vieiras Con Espinacas), and the confit of lamb (Nido De Cordero). The goat cheese itself was good, but the garlic bread that came with it was tough, as if it had been toasted and then reheated in a microwave. I did not try the avocado filled with shrimp, but I can emphasize that it was a single shrimp on top of an avocado. It's a good thing we didn't plan to share this dish or else we would've been very sadly cutting one tiger shrimp in half. The seafood stew was the most disappointing to me. It didn't taste like it had been flavored with any spices--just like someone had cooked seafood in chicken broth and dumped in onions and peppers. It wasn't bad, but it reminded me of some of my experimental days in the kitchen when I randomly throw different vegetables and meats in a pot and see how it turns out. Basically, it was very amateur. The one dish I liked was the Nido de Cordero. However, it felt like a very small serving (I know, tapas), and I left not feeling particularly satisfied but having spent more than $70. Tapas Gitana isn't terrible, but there are countless better restaurants in the city--better tapas and better Boystown eats. I see no reason to return.",-0.8713,0.793,0.092,0.115,0.5043853715728716

In our recent visit the staff was detached, despondent and indifferent to the point of literally abandoning us for extended periods of time while we ate at the bar. In fact all the staff seemed unhappy, perhaps the emptiness of the place on a Friday evening had something to do with it. The food was very average and pricey,  not the case under the previous ownership when it was Arcos de Cuchilleros and despite having the same chef.  While the menu offers some classic spanish tapas it also offers items that do not belong in a spanish tapas restaurant, not very authentic. The owner is definitely not spanish. The ambiance bordered on somber even with the Spanish music playing in the background. The restaurant does not seem to have much of a connection with the neigbohood judging by the sparse clientele which seemed to be from other areas or visitors. It is sad to see what once was a gem in the neighborhood, with good food at a reasonable price and a fun staff go down so much in the last year...it needs management attention ASAP.  If you are looking for Spanish food in town I recommend researching other options.",-0.9045,0.846,0.05,0.104,0.3189189616967394
2012-10-28,3.0,"My boyfriend and I went because we had a groupon. When we got there they seated us right away, however, the tables are extremely small there is no room for even the plates --makes for a very uncomfortable dining experience.  The food was ok but you could see into the preparation area and there were 2 microwaves that you could see the chef putting food into. Really weird because it's not something you want to see when dining out. Steak dish was good. Salmon (cold) was very good. Scallops were grainy and didn't taste fresh. The black bean soup with chorizo was horrible because there was no chorizo in it and the black beans were ground up and had no flavor - it was like eating baby food.  Trying to find parking is horrible. We drove around for 30 mins before we decided to just go into a lot which you had to pay $15 flat rate for 24 hours because you couldn't choose a time frame.

2012-10-18,5.0,"Overall great experience! My girlfriend and I were starving and not in the mood to mull over the menu, so we entrusted the bartender with placing our order. I wish I could remember her name because she was friendly, attentive and provided us with a fabulous meal.  The music in the place was an eclectic remix of hits and lesser-known goodies from 1990s to present, at the perfect volume (meaning you could have a conversation with the person next to you while talking at a normal level). The service was great and we never felt rushed- the bartender checked back in when she should and never hoovered. The busboy politely asked if we were finished with a plate or dish before even reaching for it.  When you stop in (and you should- no, you HAVE TO, stop in), try the following: - Sangria: mixed on the spot and fruit cut to order, no ice in the pitcher so it didn't get watered down - perfection! - Vieiras con Espinacas (scallops with spinach): cooked perfectly and the reduction it was served over was so delicious that we sopped up every drop with our bread  - Nido de Cordero (confit of lamb): the best dish that we had! The seasoning on the lamb was flavorful and sweet, but didn't overwhelm the dish- you could still taste the shoestring potatoes. - Aguacate Relleno (avocado with prawns): Refreshing palette-cleanser; equal parts prawn and avocado and very tasty - Datiles con Tocino (bacon wrapped dates): The bacon overpowered the flavor of the dish. It was good, but I've had better at other places. - Empanada de Dos Solomillos: Average.

2012-09-21,1.0,"Four of us walked into Tapas Gitana at around 9:00 on a Saturday night and the place was packed. After sitting at our table for about half an hour without anyone greeting us, it was obvious that service was in the weeds. When our server finally arrived to our table, she mentioned the bartender was a no call no show that night and they were slammed. The staff was having a rough night, so we were still willing to give the place the benefit of the doubt. As we sipped on our Sangrias an hour after being seated, we noticed that the restaurant has an open kitchen with a microwave sitting out for the entire place to see. If you are going to have an open kitchen, why in earth would you let customers see it? This was a complete turn-off. We ordered a bunch of tapas, all of which we thought were average. My husband and I do not eat ham, and we ordered a dish without it. Apparently the ham was really cooked into the dish and flavorless, because after we took a bite of the dish the server came over to our table to warn us that they accidentally made it with the ham, which initially we did not notice. Now, I understand that this happens, and although it upsets me, there is nothing that can really be done about it at that point. I was, however, unhappy with how the restaurant dealt with the situation. The owner came to our table and although she apologized, the situation was brushed off. She offered to make us a new one, but did not make any compensations in hope that we would decide to return.  In summary, we all agreed that we would rather spend our money at a tapas place that does not serve above average food and treats their customers with more courtesy.",0.6954,0.915,0.044,0.041,0.422310606060606

2012-07-15,1.0,"Well, I ate here once about a year ago and enjoyed it, but this past Friday I went back and had one of the most spectacularly awful evenings I've had in a restaurant in a long, long time.  I was dining with a friend, who arrived before me and told me he was on the back patio. After finding him, I went in to go to the bathroom. Coming back out, I was surprised to find a shirtless drunk man arguing with the manager, who was telling him he had to get out. The man walked upstairs to the 2nd floor, which is apparently where he lives. My friend said that while I was in the bathroom he had wandered into the back patio ranting about the restaurant and even sat down at someone's table. (I was amused to see that his victim posted a review here as well... See Laura T's remarks below...) After that the evening just went downhill. First, our waitress only came to the table every 10-15 minutes, if we were lucky. We had to order the next round of drinks when the 1st round was only half done in order to avoid sitting drinkless. They brought us the wrong dish at one point. We were there for 90 minutes and had only 3 tapas dishes.  Shortly after sunset, the lights for the entire back patio went out. So we and the other diners were sitting there in the dark, with only tea lights to see by. We had to hold up cell phones to read the menu and order. Periodically, a guy from the restaurant would come out and flick the lights on and off for 5 minutes, trying to get them to work; this was really annoying. We were outside in the dark for 45 minutes or so. At no point did anyone from the restaurant ask us if we'd like to move inside. The other, wiser diners eventually left, so that we were the only table remaining in the back. We paid our check (nothing was comped; no ""here's a dessert to make up for your trouble""; not even an apology) and tried to leave. Why, you might ask, do I say ""tried""? Well. There were 2 doors into the restaurant. The 1st we tried was locked. As we were approaching the 2nd, it was slammed in our face. Yes, really! And, there was no handle on it from the outside (is that even legal??) So there we were, effectively locked out on the patio. We started banging on the door, and were let in after several minutes. The waitress defensively said that she had shut the door ""just for a minute"" so a table inside could blow out the candles on their birthday cake. Sure, don't mind us, we'll just hang out on the patio in the dark! I see that other reviewers have noted poor service at this place. Well, they're not lying. I think the only hope for it is to replace the entire wait staff and management.

Regular Thanksgiving black Wednesday is for amateurs.  So I arrived before her and decided to have a drink at the bar. It was unfortunately really dead in there but the bartender (I forgot his name) was really friendly and I got a split bottle of cava to pass the time. My sister arrived and we decided to sit at a table.   We started off with the mushroom caps (I LOVED the red sauce that they came with) and the Tortilla Española, the potato in a tortilla. Both were great, the mushrooms had a very little fungal taste, the were night and juicy.  We also ended up ordering the tiger shrimp sautéed in olive oil garlic and chili peppers (almost like a shrimp scampi), the Grilled Slices of Chorizo, the bacon wrapped dates, and the stuffed avocado (my fave of the night).  Everything was delicious and amazing.  So after a few bottles of wine we decided to move to the bar and have some martinis. I opted for the prickly pear that comes with the wine soaked pears as a garnish because I didn't want anything sweet. This was also delicious and I only wish we HAD been there on Wednesday because they are half off. We sat around forever talking with the staff and having a great time.

The food was pretty good and we were saying that we can come back, until the bill came. The waiter, whose name is Kyle, charged us 22% gratuity on the entire bill. It was for a party fewer than six. When questioned he said that on Travelzoo the gratuity is 20%. This can't be true, and is not written anywhere in Travelzoo. While it is perfectly fair to pay gratuity on the full amount of the total bill before discount, and I always do, there is no reason why Travelzoo customers should be required to pay more than the customary 18%. In any event, there is no justification for the 22% written on the full amount of the bill. In the end he adjusted it to 20%. Actually the amount difference in gratity is not the issue and I am usually a very generous tipper, but yours truly doesn't want to feel ripped off.

2011-07-28,2.0,"I have to echo the recent reviews citing poor service; sadly that was our experience with dinner at Tapas Gitana on Fourth of July weekend. We dined outdoors in the patio, which was a nice feature, though a bit noisy from the bar over the fence. Sadly it went downhill from our initial positive impression of the patio. When the waiter took our drink menus, my wife asked for a recommendation on which Cava to select (the first section of the drinks menu was titled Cavas, i.e. sparkling wines from Spain). The waiter had no idea what she was speaking about and when we explained and pointed to the menu he claimed none were available. I went with red Sangria (which was decent) and my wife with iced tea. We ordered seven different tapas and none were bad, but only two would I classify as good (the Beef Tenderloin with Horseradish Sauce was our favorite and the Warm Goat Cheese was tasty as well). Despite decent food, the unsatisfactory service overshadowed the cuisine and fluctuated from poor to absent. A few of the highlights (well, lowlights): *My wife finished her ice tea and our waiter walked by the table multiple times ignoring her as she tried to get his attention for a refill; we eventually were able to flag down a busboy. And my wife is far from shy. *There was a long pause after our sixth dish. Eventually the waiter came over and asked if we wanted anything else. We indicated that we had not yet received our Beef Tendorloin. He meandered off and more than ten minutes later another waiter came out and said he had already brought us that dish (he had not) and eventually almost reluctantly set down the long awaited Beef Tenderloin.  *The few times we did see our waiter he acted bored, disinterested, and cold. While he was not overtly rude he did not introduce himself, make any recommendations, check on us to see how the food was, or ask if I wanted more Sangria when I finished my glass. The only time he seemed remotely chipper was when he dropped of the bill.

Service: They have their own online reservation system... which seems to not have transferred to the paper system they were using for reservations. In the end we only waited about 10 minutes, but it was annoying b/c they insisted that i had made a reservation at their other location (looking back at my confirmation email, i did NOT do such a thing). The whole service was really rushed and fanatic, there were either REALLY long pauses in between drinks/ plates, or too quick where our itty bitty table was overflowing with too many things and we couldn't eat fast enough. Literally, my dining partner and i were stacking up our plates on top of another and/or skipping plates and just eating out of the original dish. just very chaotic.  2.

Drinks- eh. their white wine sangria wasn't really sangria at all. to me, sangria is wine steeped in some fruit for a while, but they just put chopped fruit into a cup, and poured white wine for us at the table. not impressed. but i did get a good buzz so whatever.  5. Food- i was really excited; this was one of those places where you just get so excited to try everything, and you can't just limit yourself to 2-3 dishes.

Michael Buffer steps in ""Let's get ready to RUUUUUMBLE"" (Zoning back) For some reason Tapas and I have always had this love and hate battle. I first thought that maybe it has to do with location but then ""Twist"" disproved that one evening with some awful dishes. Then I thought maybe it's what I order so I started ordering the same things and that didn't work. So maybe it's some small detail that is either spot on while cooking or missed horribly. But for the first time I got a little of both at Tapas Gitana. First off, I have to say that the service is fantastic here! Very friendly, very attentive, and they give great recommendations. Second, their Sangria is bloody amazing (yes, talk like a Brit good)!! As for the food I got both mouth watering and oh my god get this out of my mouth (that's what she said! Hey-o!! Um, wait... I don't I said that right?!). Prices are a little high but you do get nice portions. Pollo Al Curry -curried chicken salad with red grapes, scallions and celery. Not bad but not amazing though I've actually spat out others (I know dramatic but whatever). Tilapia Al Caparas -grilled dusted tilapia served over sautéed vegetables with a white wine, artichoke and caper sauce. Very nice balance of flavors and the Tilapia is cooked very well. I would totally get this again. Aguacate Relleno -half avocado filled with avocado, tiger shrimp, scallions and cilantro, served over baby greens with a brandy mayo sauce. It was uh interesting, not bad but it was all about texture and nothing else because the avocado masked everything. Ensalada Marinadas -baby artichokes, roasted red and green peppers, roasted eggplant, fresh garlic in a sherry/ balsamic vinaigrette. Not being a fan of eggplant this was pretty good and it smelled amazing which eggplant almost never does (thing babies diapers).      Tomate Y Queso Con Aceitunas (-vine ripened tomato, fresh mozzarella, topped with black olive and roasted red pepper relish and fresh basil. Total fail, I mean really??! The mozzarella wasn't fresh and the black olive overpowered everything even the red pepper. Patatas Bravas -Fried potato dices served with salsa brava, a spicy tomato sauce. Oh how I love and hate this dish in general. It's very, very fickle. Potatoes undercooked or over, sauce too spicy or no spice at all, and the worst part is that it is only at it's best when piping hot. At Tapas Gitana they are excellent!!    And the winner... TAPAS!!

He ran to the bar and brought us new glasses to try the white (we had red before) and a small pitcher of the sangria. He then went on to talk about how the sangria was made and the quality of the fruit. We then ordered an amazing desert it was like a rasin bread with vanilla ice cream and carmel.

2011-02-10,4.0,"They say appearances can be deceiving and that is certainly true of this restaurant. On the surface, it appears to be a humble neighborhood-type of establishment that doesn't compare with some of the bigger names out there (i.e., Babareeba, Iberico, etc), but once inside, the menu tells a different story. Alongside traditional dishes such as jamon serrano, patatas con alioli (garlic potato salad) and calamares a la plancha (grilled squid) are unique creations featuring ingredients such as duck breast, lobster, and lamb confit. Many of the dishes also feature an updated, upscale twist to more traditional tapas, particularly in the presentation of the dish. SP and I went for the first time a few Thursdays ago and were pleasantly surprised. The restaurant itself provides a warm intimate environment that resembles a rustic spanish kitchen. Ideal for couples or small groups, but perhaps less so for large parties or anyone seeking a ""trendier"" atmosphere. We tried the sangria, which was tasty and refreshing but definitely on the lighter side. We ordered five tapas: - Patatas con Alioli: garlic potato salad - Endibias con Naranja, Queso y Almendras: Endive leaves with goat cheese, mandarin oranges, almonds and a citrus vinaigrette - Empanada de dos Solomillos - beef and pork empanadas served over tomato basil sauce, topped with horseradish cream - Carazon de Alachofas: Baked artichoke hearts stuffed with manchego cheese and topped with grilled tiger prawns and herbed alioli  - Special menu item (don't remember the name): marinated anchovies layered on top of vine ripened tomatoes, avocado and other forgotten deliciousness, drizzled with olive oil  SP loved the the potatos (surprise surprise) and I thought the baked artichoke hearts were superb. We both loved the anchovy/tomato special and thought the empanada was good as well. The only dish that I thought was lacking was the endive dish, as the mandarin oranges were too ""juicy"" and overpowered the other flavors.  SP was so impressed with the food overall that we decided to try dessert. We settled on the Pan Perdido con Frutas y Chocolate, which was a spanish style banana and chocolate bread pudding with dried cranberries, served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce. It sounded delicious, but it was just ok. The dried cranberries (imo), tasted like mushy rasins and the tartness detracted from the richness of the bread pudding.

2010-04-29,3.0,"I have been to Arco a few times over the years, but it's never become a go-to place for me.  Mainly because it is not enough of a destination place, and I don't live in this neighborhood, therefore, little chance of impromptu dropping in.  So, on a Saturday night after attending an event, my friends and I found ourselves craving food and wanting something casual.  Arco to the rescue. We had a humorous encounter walking into the restaurant.  There was no host or hostess, so we told the bartender that we are a party of 4.  He had a look on his face like he was pondering some existentialist dilemma.  I think he mumbled OK, and proceeded to leave the bar and check on an empty 4-top that was set up and ready.  So after leading us into thinking that it might be our table, he then motioned to 4 other folks at the bar that their table is ready.  Finally, another staff came and told us that there is a table leaving soon, and that they would seat us shortly. So, we had the de-rigueur Sangria at the bar.  Pretty decent, nothing outstanding for a red sangria.  For the 4 of us, we got:  Montaditos (tomato bread), Tortilla Espanola, Datiles con Bacon, Calamares ala Plancha, Berenjena Formentor, Pollo ala Navarra, and a salmon dish on daily special. The tomato bread, one has the option of having cheese, chorizo, jamon Serrano, or sausage.  We ordered Manchego and jamon Serrano, but somehow it came as chorizo and jamon Serrano.  We started eating and didn't realize the mistake until the waitress came over and had a look of horror on her face.  (One would think ""facial expressions"" is part of their employee training.  Perhaps Ms Tyra Banks stopped in and gave a demo).  Anyway, we didn't mind as much, so continued eating our double meat sandwich.  The Tortilla has a slight eggy spongy feel to it, unlike most tapas places where it feels like a brick.  Quite nice.  The Datiles are good, except after having had the ones at Mercat and Avec, theirs doesn't compare.  And maybe comparing it is not fair in the first place.  Anyway, on to the Calamares, the best dish of the evening.  The squid is cut into florets, lightly grilled and swimming in splashes of olive oil and lemon.  It was a rainy night and this transported us somewhere along coastal Spain.  Sitges, maybe?  Next came the eggplant fritters.  Crunchy batter enveloping tender roasted eggplant.  Hamburger places should seriously start selling these instead of onion rings.  The sauté of chicken and ham in the Pollo ala Navarra was ok.  Nothing interesting about sautéed chicken with ham.  The special of salmon came pristinely poached, in a bed of creamy dill sauce.  The fish was very tender and the sauce flavorful.  Probably not particularly traditional, but a nice touch after a lot of salty pungent flavors. Why 3 stars?  It is a nice casual neighborhood place.  On a Saturday night prime time, we didn't have to wait that long, even though the place is tiny, and the weather is too fickle right now for their back patio.  As I have mentioned, the food is good, but not extraordinary for it to be a destination place.  If you live in this neighborhood, I can see Arco de Cuchilleros as a casual week night haunt.",0.9959,0.805,0.142,0.052,0.5440242763772175

Queso al Horno - Okay, so you know how most places float a little cylander of goat cheese in the middle of a sea of tomato sauce? Arco replaces the goat cheese with a mix of blue cheese and homemade cream cheese (way better than Philly, sorry Philadelphians) and covers the tomato sauce with it.  It's richer and more flavorful and just plain better.

The price is a little higher than other tapas places in the city, but the atmosphere and the quality of the food are worth it.  If you go there in the summer, sit out in the patio, it's so lovely.

This is one of my favorite tapas dishes typically, I always order it, and it's much better at Cafe Iberico.  The bacon-wrapped dates came on a sauce that was super sweet.  The super sweet sauce/date combination was just too much sweetness.  When they served the chorizos, they lit the plate on fire, so that was neat, but the fire did not burn off the excess of oil they used.  The chorizos and vegetables were swimming in a bowl of oil, so it was slimy.  This plate was actually inedible I thought.  I wished they had had a beef tapas on the menu.  While they had lots of seafood tapas, I also missed a calamares fritos option.  They serve Torres Sangre de Toro by the glass pretty cheap, so that was the one highlight.  I have been to only one other Spanish tapas bar in Chicago, Cafe Iberico, and Cafe Iberico is MUCH better.  Super packed and long wait, but at least you get good food.  I will not be back to Arco de Cuchilleros.",0.9824,0.791,0.153,0.055,0.5223518518518518

Grilled prawns (also a special) -- definitely the best dish we had.  Pork tenderloin -- this looked like an early bird dinner special at the golden nugget.

Pork loin -- This looked like some kind of beef stew concoction your mother made you sit at the dinner for three hours until you finished it.

Scallops in saffron sauce -- not too bad, the scallops were pretty mushy and didn't taste all that fresh, but the sauce was good.

I was running a few minutes late and still a bit hungover from the night before, (yes, I was out with yelpers and yes, the last few hours were fuzzy). I quickly made my way here and immediately spotted my dinner companion sitting at a table right by the bar. As we sat and chatted we noticed our server was hustling his butt off, he was not only the only server but also the bartender. Impressive. The rest of the friendly staff helped out, getting water, bringing dishes out and cleaning up as he hustled around, no worries there. Also, there is an open grill however, the wide windows in the front and the airiness of the space also lent itself from leaving and not smelling like said grill. I like that. Cozy decor, but open especially with those front windows ajar and the nice weather, gave a little feel of not being in Chicago. I like that too.  Jennifer was sipping on some sangria, the thought of which made my body quiver, and not in a good way, so I decided to stick with some soda water. As we munched on some toasted bread, we pondered the menu. Plenty of hot and cold items, some large plates, soups and salads. We settled on four small ones. Of course the traditional dates wrapped in bacon though these came with a brandied cream sauce, of course tasty and wonderful salty and sweet combination, but I would have been fine with out the sauce. There was a tart with raisins, spinach, splash of olive oil, really light and refreshing, though I thought for some reason it was missing something. Perhaps something of a little more substance. There was slices of eggplant, battered and fried, covered with small slices of smoked sausages and tomatoes. This was probably my favorite, perhaps it was the sausage but I think the combination of flavors and it being fried helping my condition. We also got their cheese plate, three different types of Spanish cheeses and small thin slices of Granny Smith apples. I don't recall the names, but there was a aged drier cheese, a soft creamy one and a more of a firmer soft cheese. (Does that make any sense?)  We skipped dessert, (I know, I know... pick your jaw up off the floor), based on our fullness.

Dates with bacon: The sweet  and rich flavor combined together is an excellent jump start to the meal. 2. Cold selection of olives: Between olives and olive oil with bread, it almost cleanses the palate for when the hot tapas dishes come out. 3. Salmon cured with capers: Oh my goodness, the Jew in me want to kiss this man. With a very light oil, the intense flavor of the salmon comes through, only to be sparked by the capers. 4. The fried eggplant with Spanish sausage: Not deep fried thank goodness and a nice change up from all the brandy cream sauce floating in your stomach by now. 5. Hot cheese dip in a earthern casserole: Now I'm lactose intolerant but I'll dig into this no problem because of the combo of baked tomatoes and basil reminds me of the best part of having pasta. I could go on forever and I usually do about my favorite foods but I do recommend trying the server's favorites' because they always know what's good that day and have some sangria-it's better than most.

Very Chicagoish in the sense it is definitely a neighborhood place without attitude. Cool mix of folks.  If I had one suggestion, it would be that the decor needs updated, even if it means just painting the place. It is starting to look a bit worn... But the food was great.

Plump, delicious, and creamy. - Chorizo con pimtentos - Chorizo and sweet peppers, flambeed in brandy - This dish come out spouting flames. As a result, there are a whole lot of ooooo and ahhhs! from other diners. It was certainly impressive to see a pyro flame show on my dinner table, but the actual chorizo and sweet peppers were nothing too special. Let's just say the chorizo was on the bland side. - The Eggplant Dish - Oh God! Oh God! The eggplant is so good! It's battered, fried, warm, moist, and melts like butter. The sangria was great. Not too sweet, and after a pitcher per person, I was incredibly happy. And by happy I mean drunk. One star off for being slightly overpriced in my mind.
