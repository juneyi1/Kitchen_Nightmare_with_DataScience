2008-03-25,5.0,"So sad about this place.  My boyfriend and I pretty much ate here all last summer when he lived in Lakeview.  I loved the pierogi sampler...each piece was like a yummy little surprise.  I had never had deep fried pierogies until I came here...I was actually hesitant to try them but once I did, I never went back.  Mmm...And the best part was the onions and bacon that they topped them with!

2007-09-24,4.0,"This was the first place that I ever tried Pierogis.... In fact the only place that I have ever had Pierogis, so I don't have much to compare them to, but they were pretty tasty.... With that said, They are _CLOSED_.  I don't really know what happened, but  a few months ago, there was a sign into the window advertising the space for rent (while the resturant was still open).  The sign went down for a few months, but now it is back with a few smaller notices that by order of the courts, the landlord has taken over possession of the business.....",0.6486,0.956,0.044,0.0,0.3401709401709402
2007-09-02,4.0,"I can't believe it took me so long to find this place, its practically right across the street. They have great pierogis among many other items. My friend and I split their Pierogi special which was a mix of 12 of their wide variety of  ""flavors"". My favorites were the potato and cheese and the spinach. I wasn't a fan of the sauerkraut and mushroom but other than that, everything was good. We also received a bowl of their tomato soup.

2007-08-23,3.0,"I'm so torn on how many stars to give this place. My taste buds say YES! but my insides say NO!  On one hand the boiled pierogis I had here tasted wonderful and were full of flavor. On the other hand even though they were boiled, they were so greasy I left with some serious stomach pain. Pain that lasted me the rest of the evening.

2007-08-21,5.0,"I love the Pierogi Factory!  The staff is great, very accommodating, and they always have great specials.  As Jean A. mentioned, it is surprising to see so many reviews on here, because this place is rarely packed!     I definitely recommend the mushroom soup, any of the pieorgis (get them with bacon and onions on top - YUM!), and their polish sausage. Awesome food, great service, and reasonable prices.  Be sure to check this out next time you are in the Belmont area.",0.9759,0.683,0.274,0.043,0.609920634920635
2007-08-17,4.0,"Oooh, I will be back to this  place!!   I am surprised to see so many reviews...the day I was there, it was totally empty...wasn't there during the height of dinner or lunch hour, but still.... I was pleased....my grandma was 100% Lithuanian, and they must have swapped recipes with the Poles, because she did this whole ""genre"" of food.  Kasia's does a good one in the Jewel freezer, but these are waaaaayyy better.  I ordered the sauerkraut ones, after discovering they could be made for me even though they are not on the menu (huh?).  The girl at the counter was very nice in all respects.  I got them to go, since I wasn't going to sit in an empty place and eat them.  Half of them didn't make it to the Belmont L a block or so away!  They were hot (made after I ordered them), just crispy enough (I had 'em fried...there's also a boiling option) and tasty, with not too much oil.  I do feel they could be a little less expensive, at about $5 for six of them.  $8 for 12 is a bit better deal.  I look forward to the next time I go!!",0.961,0.85,0.12,0.03,0.4796296296296297
2007-08-04,5.0,"This restaurant is very clean and well designed, cleanliness extending into the bathroom. I had fantastic pierogis (my first). My friend and I ordered the Mix n Match, 12 pierogis (6 types) for $9.99. I have to say, I loved the mushroom and sauerkraut ones the most. The sauerkraut is not pungent at all, so if you don't like it normally (I don't), it is still very edible in this dish. My second favorite had to be the potato and cheese. Note- there were 'potato and cheese' types as well as 'potato and cheddar'. One was creamier and one had chunkier bits. You can ask the cashier which is which. They were both absolutely delicious, I was too busy enjoying them to decide their names. My third favorite was the meat and spinach type. It was a very unique taste and I think this pierogi and the sauerkraut one are the choice if you would like to have a new experience. They are very good so even if you are picky or not adventurous, it won't hurt to try one. The last two types were 'spinach' and 'meat'. What can I say, they were spinach, and they were meat. If you don't like spinach, try it anyway, it doesn't have the normal tangy taste. Both were very well seasoned. For all of these I had to decline bacon because I do not eat it and the onions I passed up on because I was going to be out talking to people all day (hah). Lastly the Mix N Match came with Sorra soup. It was good and nothing to be afraid of. Despite its broth look it has lots of flavor. I found part of an egg, some rice, carrot, and a peppercorn in it. Again, don't be scared. I AM SO SAD TO SEE THAT THIS PLACE IS CLOSED!!!!",0.9869,0.819,0.141,0.04,0.5689337822671156
2007-07-26,4.0,Give me sum more!!  I'm so happy I finally came here. They have a huge selection to choose from (compared to the taste) and their so good!! The mushrooms with Spinach are my fav and the meats ones are really good 2!! The potato were OK and the sweet cabbage I did not like at all! I didn't get to try the soup but if u buy a dozen u get a pea and barley soup!! Def. worth the trip!!,0.9366,0.755,0.227,0.019,0.6499999999999999
2007-07-24,3.0,"Hmm. I was here about 6 months ago and I just came here to write how the pierogis I brought home for takeout were soggy and underflavored. I was disappointed and expecting more, since everyone in the place was Eastern European and no one was speaking English. That's usually my sign that the ethnic food I'm about to eat is going to be badass. After reading the reviews here though, I'm inclined to go back and sit down for another shot. Why not? Pierogis are awesome, and it's super cheap. How could that NOT be worth another shot.",-0.5258,0.845,0.056,0.099,0.3868686868686868
2007-07-23,4.0,"The pierogis are fresh and damn good. The potato and cheese taste like home-cooked mashed potatoes in a thick pierogi skin and I'm absolutely able to knock back between 6 and 12 of 'em...but that's OK cause a 6-piece is only 4.99 and a 12-piece is 7.99. Cheap, non-processed food-yay! The dessert pierogis are pretty good too. They use fresh fruit, but the sweet cheese pierogis are the best cap to an already tasty meal. The service is friendly and pretty quick, especially when it's not crowded (which it usually isn't). There are a cozy amount of tables if you want to dine in (I'd say about 4 tables and 4 seats at a counter), but I usually grab a to-go order. The menu is pretty simple...If they pad it out a bit more, this place would be nigh on perfect.",0.9903,0.722,0.267,0.012,0.6173913043478261

2007-07-14,4.0,"Just ate there tonight. YUMMY. I had the potato/ cheddar & the meat pierogis, fried with bacon on top. They were crispy with out being oily, and were so good! My husband had the polish sausage and the potato pancakes-I think that this was one of the best sausages that I have eaten in a long time :).

I ordered 12, but I wish the option to order 8 was on the menu. 12 was just too many. I got the potato and cheese version fried and ate there while reading a book. The woman working the counter was super sweet and seemed very happy that I told her it was my first time there. Seeing the little Yelp sticker on the door warms my heart.

2006-12-03,3.0,"First let me say I'm a huge fan of Pierogi.  My mom makes a mean batch occasionally, and though she's neither Polish or Russian, she's never let me down. The Pierogi Factory let me down, or perhaps I chose poorly.  I walked past this place while exploring my new neighborhood and decided to try it, since I'd never heard of a restaurant specializing in pierogi.  I asked for some meat treats to go, and hauled them back to my apartment three blocks away. I won't say they were soggy, but they certainly weren't crisp.  The meat was over-seasoned and I felt bamboozled.  I think next time I'll order the cheese and potato and eat there to get them as fresh as possible.  I really want to bump this review up and put this in my list of favorites because it seems like it has great potential, and other reviewers really seem to like it. Regardless of the above, the prices are *highly* reasonable.  Cheap is the key word here, no matter what you decide to eventually order, so you can't really go wrong with trying out different things until you come across something worth the trip. And don't stare at the hotties, it's not polite. ;)",0.9742,0.805,0.153,0.042,0.4807328208190277
