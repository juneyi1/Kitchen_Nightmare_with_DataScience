2011-03-13,4.0,"Sorry to hear it closed.  A solid restaurant in wicker park for many years. I understand why though after eating there in Dec 10.  My table had a wide variety of food since we all had the big tasting menu with wine pairings.  Everything was well prepared and tasty but with few stand outs. Nothing seperated it from the other fabulous restaurants in the city.  While I found the ambiance cool a decade ago, now it seems dated, especially with it half full and a completely empty bar. When it first opened it was like Sunda or any of the other Rino restaurants are now, bustling and great seafood.  Anyway, enough with the nostalgia.  I'm waiting for a new great restaurant to enter the great space so when I head to WP there will be a new destination restaurant in the area!",0.9874,0.753,0.224,0.024,0.4958677685950414

Having said that, the food actually was really good.  I feel bad that the chef is being represented by such a group of goons at the front.  They need to get over themselves quickly and learn how to treat people.",-0.2665,0.766,0.108,0.126,0.4404444444444444

2011-01-07,5.0,"UPDATE: I just read others' reviews - Spring is CLOSED?! Wow, I am sooo disappointed. Please re-open! Pleeeeease! I wish I could give Spring more than 5 stars. My husband and I have been twice now - once for NYE dinner in 2008, and once to use our Groupon (which they still partially honored even though we had stupidly let it expire). Both times the service was impeccable, the food out of this world, and the cocktails creative with clean flavors. Since Spring isn't a place you can visit everyday (or at least I can't), I hate to recommend dishes that you won't be able to get in the future. But my favorites so far were the coconut lemongrass soup with mushrooms; the fig and blue cheese tart; and the short ribs. Really though, I've never had a bad or even mediocre dish here, and the servers are really good at talking with you about the menu and making recommendations, so ask for their help if you're teetering about your order.

My experience, this was a terrible place for food, we had a fixed menu of items to order for the 3 course meal, appetizer was thai soup, nothing spectacular. The main course i had steak, which was terrible, i have had better servings from Mcdonalds. Appetizer was something i could not remember apart from the terrible taste. We complained to the manager about the food and taste, and were given complimentary doughnuts, which in all our opinion, was the best dish for the night. Would never try this place again.

My mom and I used to eat out often, primarily on Tuesdays.  We first ate at Spring not long after they opened.  It immediately became our favorite restaurant.  Unfortunately, I couldn't afford to eat there as often as I would have liked.  Spring remained Mom's favorite until her passing almost two years ago. After her death, I almost exclusively dined at Spring alone.  I could still see Mom sitting across from me, bemoaning the fact she forgot her pocket flashlight and straining to read the menu.  Dining here reminded me of all the great meals we enjoyed over the years.

They have a decent wine list, and the food is good. But there are at least 75 restaurants within a mile of this place that have ""good food"" for literally 20% of what you'll pay to eat here.  While not to everyone's taste, their decor is unique and interesting. I always enjoy the desert.  But we're in Chicago here. When you're spending over $200 on a meal for 2, you should have a perfect and unforgettable dining experience...and there is no shortage of restaurants in the vicinity that are equipped to provide that to you.  Sorry to see you go Spring, but I'm afraid that too many of the people who talk your restaurant up enjoy talking up expensive restaurants far more than dining at them.

2010-12-16,4.0,"Had the four-course tasting menu-- a bit pricey but I guess not really for this type of place.  The Amuse Bouche was a really interesting mix of textures and flavors (I think it was a Hamachi sashimi bite?).  My strategy for the evening was to start out light and get heavier towards the end of the meal because I wanted some steak if I was going to pay a lot.  So I started out with the oysters which were very light but not really all that memorable (though still, as with all things that I will criticize here, pretty good).   I had the brussel sprout salad next with tiny bit of ""Thai"" pancetta and I think this was my best course of the night-- a great balance of flavors and textures, kind of fun to play with as you are eating it.  My girlfriend had the apple-ginger soup which was excellent and was surprisingly not salty.   I had the ny strip for my third entree with oxtail tortellini which was very good.  This was a dish that was not overly seasoned as well so you could really make out the flavor of the meat.  The tortellini were little bursts of flavor along the way, enhancing the flavor of the steak.  Overall I was really happy that nothing was too salty in this meal, which seems to be the go-to for higher end cuisine-- just ply them with salt and fat and they'll be happy.  My girlfriend's gnocchi was better than my steak as it was light and fluffy, and the added twist of sesame flavor in the dish really made it feel like something new. Desserts were fine.  I had apple cider panna cotta which was a bit dull and I didn't think the acid flavor of the cider worked well with it.  However, the Mexican donut on the side was excellent and made the panna cotta much better when eaten together.  My girlfriend got the ice cream trio which was flavorful but nothing new to me.   All in all it was a great experience for someone who would usually spend about $30 on two people for a meal, and doesn't like fancy artifice or gimmicks.  Wish it would stick around for another visit.",0.998,0.77,0.21,0.02,0.5183971291866027

But really it's an honest mistake and I don't fault the guy for being too embarrassed to have us leave, so I decided to do what I do whenever confronted with an unexpectedly expensive restaurant, order a salad and side dish.  The salad was something that sounded great, with pear and napa cabbage and a buttermilk dressing. When it came out it looked like it had been made 3 hours ago, and was the soggiest, nastiest, limpest thing I have ever had to politely choke down in front of a date. The side of potatoes cooked in duck fat with shiitake mushrooms was just okay, if not a little oily, even for duck fat. I like food. I like spending money on good food, and when by myself (and planning on it) have no trouble dropping a lot of cash on a heavenly gourmet meal. I would hope that that when the salad is $14 it will be at least decent, not something that looks like it came out of a bucket like bulk restaurant coleslaw. It was really enough to put me off this place.  My date seemed to enjoy his meal, including the lemongrass coconut soup and some selection of the sushi.

Amuse bouche:  a shot of carrot ginger chilled soup.  Delicious.  I was trying to lap up every last drop. Bread: A crackery-type of flatbread served with white bean dip.  Pretty good, but sometimes I would just rather have some warm fluffy bread. First course:  Off the prix fix: my fiance got the farm egg raviola, which I thought was delicious, but basically was an egg inside a ravioli, so when you cut into it, it oozed like a sunny-side up egg.  I got the short-rib dumplings (there were 4), which everyone else at my table liked, but I thought were too salty.  The salt, in my opinion, overpowered any of the other flavors.  My dinner-mates basically agreed with me, but stated that they liked the saltiness. A la carte: My mom got the crab and scallion pancake, which I thought was delicious and a generous portion.  My dad got the eel maki roll, which was pretty good, but we wished had more eel. I was starting to notice that the portions off the prix fix menu were smaller than the a la carte options. Second course: Off the prix fix: my fiance got the sea scallops with oxtail and mushrooms.  He loved it.  I tried it and thought it had great flavors and the scallops were cooked well.  I got the barramundi with lobster gnocchi.  Mine was also delicious, and I don't even like fish that much.  But they cooked the fish perfectly, and the gnocchi and haricots verts that came with it were also delicious.  I gobbled up my entree and was done before everyone else. A la carte: my dad also ordered the barramundi, and here's where I truly noticed the disparity. It was the exact same dish, but with 1.5 times more fish and gnocchi.  I finished my dish in like 5 minutes, but my dad still had half his left.  And normally my dad is the speedier eater.  My criticisms aside, it was still a great dish.  My mom had the halibut with yukon potatoes, which she also enjoyed.  I didn't get to try it, so I don't have anything particular to say about it. Dessert: Off the prix fix: lime panna cotta with coconut milk + side of doughnut.  The doughnut was delicious, and that was my favorite part.  The panna cotta was light and tasty, but I got a little tired of lime halfway through, so I gave the rest away to my dining-mates.  My fiance got the white chocolate dome which had a good rich white chocolate taste, but also managed to be light. A la carte: my parents shared the chocolate covered cherry, which was a chocolate and cherry dense tarte with creme-fraiche ice cream and coco nibs.  It was good, but very rich.  They couldn't finish it and eventually traded us for our desserts because they couldn't handle the decadence of it. End of the meal favor: a shot of hot chocoate, which was a nice little treat. Overall:  Pros: almost everything we had was delicious. Cons: The prix fix menu didn't have a lot of options. And for the second course, it only offered 2 seafood dishes and a vegetarian dish.  It was not possible to order any meat.  The dishes we had were good, but I kinda wanted to have the option of ordering chicken or beef.  Also, if you ordered a la carte the same dishes that were on the prix fix, it would cost you about $68.  But the normal cost of the prix fix was $59.  This might lead you to think that the prix fix is a better deal, but then you realize that they are pretty much giving you smaller portions of everything.  Depending on your level of hunger, this a pro or a con.  The other possibility is that we got smaller portions because they knew we had groupons, which they asked us about when we made the reservation.   I would definitely check out Spring.",0.9994,0.775,0.205,0.02,0.5843167701863355

Reflective thought...Even though something may sound unusual, exciting, different....it may taste completely simple and not like anything special.  Ok, I digress... We started off with drinks.  FAR EAST SIDE FIZZ: Sake Vodka, Cucumber, Lime, Lemongrass Light and refreshing much like a Mojito. I liked it. TEA ROSE: Tea Infused Vodka, Elderflower Liquor, Lemon  Tasted like flowery tea with a kick...interesting, but not my thing. Free shot sample: Chilled smoked leek soup...I was licking the little shot glass and really  wanted a whole bowl of the stuff!  It was great. We were also served some sesame pita/crackers with some sort of gingered potato puree to spread on the crackers...it was nice. 1st course (the fiance was greedy, so he ordered 2 extra items so we could try a bunch of different things: Kusshi Oyster - bloody mary'/grated fresh wasabi Too fishy for my taste, but the fiance liked it. Pacific Tuna Tartare: banana miso sauce/toasted cashews/olive oil poached shallots DELICIOUS! Fresh, tasty, combined w/ banana miso...just outstanding. Farm Egg Ravioli: brown butter/hazelnuts/white truffle oil/smoked potato Simple and not impressed.  Tasted like an egg yolk inside a ravioli. Crispy Pork Belly: Chinese steamed buns/pickled cucumber/Thai basil & cilantro  Nice, but not outstanding. 2nd course: Australian Barramundi: Maine lobster/potato gnocchi/sweet curry/citrus/cilantro pesto.   Killer combination.  A crispy yet tender and flaky fish on top of little gnocci, with a superb sauce.  It was truly top notch. Seared Maine Sea Scallops: braised oxtail/wild mushrooms/sweet soy/baby bok choy Tasty sweet scallops + tiny mushrooms in salty beef broth.  A nice combination of flavors. 3rd course: Panna Cotta with a little doughnut WONDERFUL!!! Creamy, smooth, tasty, cool, with a warm sweet doughnut. Mmmmmmmmmm...doughnuts......sorry, I had a Homer moment. Ice cream dome with some sort of jam inside, with berries and gingered fruit.  It was tasty, cool and the jam inside was a nice surprise. Not as good as the panna cotta. Free shot sample: A shot of bittersweet hot chocolate.  It was too thick, sweet, bitter....yeah, not sure.  I just know I could not drink it after the second sip...Maybe I was just full from everything else we ate... The service was good.  Everyone there was very attentive and nice. We still spent a chunk of $ even with the Groupon, but it was a good experience and we enjoyed the food.",0.9981,0.727,0.208,0.065,0.6274943310657596

Aside from the street presence, our dinner was great.  The waiter was really professional, and very, very attentive.  Our wine and sparkling water glasses were never empty, and although our meals had already arrived, our bread and dip were refilled.  Even better, they brought by three small samples from the chef: potato and leek soup with saffron and a creme fraiche topping, pesto covered lobster, and hot chocolate with orange. Our main courses were amazing, and desserts were delicious also.  It may not be Spring's fault, but their oysters were really tiny...

2010-08-21,4.0,"We went a few nights ago and I'm glad we at least went once.  We had one groupon so we were able to order something off the menu too. Glad we did.  Spring had burrata on its menu.  Of course, the other place that consistently has a burrata dish is Green Zebra.  The first time I had burrata, it was with satsuma tangerines and probably was the best way to eat this cheese.  Spring matched it with heirloom tomatoes and the taste was savory but not as great as if it was matched with satsuma tangerine. We also ordered the lemongrass soup.  As other people have said, and has I tasted it, it was exactly like Tom Kha soup at a Thai restaurant.  I would skip this if you are going.  The raviolo was good, but had the same taste it did at Green Zebra. From the Groupon, we ordered the Eggplant Masala.  Now, there are many instances where I have a issue with the texture and consistency of the eggplant (who in a Indian story, is the royalty of vegetables as it is the only one with a crown.  This dish was never an issue.  The masala and the sauce gave the dish a punch and paired well with the eggplant. I enjoyed my cocktail, it was the classic aviation with crème de violette.  If only I had my aviators (and a silver streamlined plane that H Hughes had....) Don't skip the dessert.  The white chocolate dome was as cute as anything round, but the taste was delicate and restrained.   I tried calling to make reservations, but they were closed on Monday.  So instead, I made the reservations online.  Very easy and they call the day to confirm your time. We got there 10 minutes earlier than our reservation (7pm), but were seated promptly.  It was empty when we sat, but started to fill out soon after.  The service was impeccable and our waiter was friendly and unobtrusive.   As for the cost, I don't understand my fellow yelpers about being surprised when the bill came.  Spring is expensive.  But you know what you are getting into it when you want to come here.   I wouldn't come here often as I find that Green Zebra is as good and gives a bit more choices for those of us that are vegetarians/vegan.

2010-08-21,4.0,"I came to Spring a few nights ago with a Groupon and thought that the food, if pricey, was delicious, and the service great.  We came on a Wednesday night around 7, and there were only two or three other groups of people in the restaurant.  However, by 9ish when we left it was definitely filling up.  After ordering, the server brought out a shot of a creamy cold onion-based soup as well as some crispy breads with a bean/sesame paste.  Both were delicious.  I always like restaurants with little surprise tastings that you weren't expecting.  For dinner, we ordered the burrata/heirloom tomato/watermelon salad, the cold coconut/lemongrass soup, farm-egg raviolo, and eggplant masala.  We got the white chocolate dome for dessert. With the exception of the raviolo, which I found to be underseasoned and bland, I thought all the food was outstanding.  The flavor pairings were creative and well executed.  The burrata/tomato salad was fresh and light, with little cubes of watermelon providing bursts of sweetness in every bite. The lemongrass soup was good... it reminded me a lot of a tom kha soup that you would get at a thai restaurant with slightly different flavors.  Less sweet and more spicy, perhaps?  It was a little weird for me; my mouth really wanted it to be a tom kha soup for the first 70% of the spoonful but then at the end there was this unique spicyness.  Anyway, it was interesting and tasty. I had big hopes for the farm egg raviolo, as I have had something similar at Green Zebra and loved it.  However, here it was very bland.  Even a little salt would have helped to waken up the flavors.  I wouldn't get this again unless I knew it would be different. The eggplant masala was delicious and i loved the presentation.  There were tempura green beans and mushrooms on the side, and the eggplant itself was thinly layered into a brick.  The flavors in this worked really well, and I would certainly order it again. The white chocolate dome was amazing!  I can't even remember much about it.  just get it.  It doesn't matter! After dessert we got surprise shots of a mexican hot chocolate.  Maybe not as good as ""the mexican"" at Hot Chocolate, but it was a great way to end the meal.   I also tried two of their cocktails; an aviator and a tea-infused vodka drink called the Tea Rose  Both were very well made.  Cocktails here are 12 dollars but so are good cocktails with quality ingredients anywhere you go. Yes, Spring is expensive.  This will not be a regular occurance for me!  However, the groupon allowed me to get a good idea of what their menu offers without breaking the bank.  Given the chance, I would definitely visit Spring again.",0.9964,0.817,0.16,0.023,0.5573166946048304

My fiance ordered the Farm Egg Raviolo - brown butter/hazelnuts/white truffle oil/smoked potato.  His appetizer was much better than mine.  For dinner he got the Eggplant masala with cilantro, yogurt, and grilled garlic scapes.  He liked it, but I wasn't as much of a fan.  Probably because of the cilantro.  Dessert he got the white-chocolate dome with strawberries, rhubarb, and rosewater.  His dessert was also excellent. I wouldn't go back to Spring for anything in particular.  The service was excellent and out waitress was very patient in explaining the menu and helping us decide on options, but the food was lackluster.  I was hoping for something better.  I am glad we had a Group On, because with the 2 cocktails we got, our bill would have been well over $200.  We still tipped on the original bill (pre Group On) so it was still pricey.  I just don't think  the food is worth the money here.

2010-08-12,4.0,"I wish I could give this place 4.5 stars because I think that is what it was in my mind. I came here on a groupon - the 3 course prix fixe meal. I ended up getting the tuna tartare, sea scallops, an order of the crispy pork belly steamed bun, and the lime panna cotta with doughnuts for dessert. I think because it was our first time there, the chef gave us a small shot sampler of their chilled soup. How nice! For the first dish, I had the crispy port belly in a steamed bun. I think the pork could have been slightly more tender, but the flavor and especially the entire combination of the pork in the bun was really tasty. Next up was the Pacific tuna tartare with banana-miso sauce, poached shallots, and cashews. Interesting combination that was pretty good all together. After that was the Maine sea scallops, with roasted mushrooms, braised oxtail, and sweet soy. Although the dish was good, I think that the soy made the dish a little bit too sweet. My friend had the barramundi dish, which I tried a bite of, and I think that the fish in combination with the vegetable it was served with was very delicious. I wish I would have gotten that instead! The Lemongrass and kaffir-lime panna cotta, with passion-fruit gelee and crispy brioche doughnuts came next. The panna cotta, kind of like a soft flan type of dessert, was really delicious. Lime with passion fruit gel on top. This light mixture of flavors really hit the spot. I was not as impressed with the doughnut part of the dessert but the panna cotta more than made up for it. The dessert wine pairing for this was really good too. A Columbian sweet reisling that tasted like sparkling juice to me. To finish, the chef sent out some hot chocolate shots. Tasty. All in all it was a really solid meal with excellent service and a nice modern but not too flashy environment.

I was here last week on a double date with my boyfriend and his roommate, but I'd been before a few years ago when I lived in Wicker Park and my parents were visiting.  The decor and the ambiance are very hip. I got to the restaurant about 15 minutes early, but about 35 minutes before the rest of my party.  The hostesses were very friendly when I walked in.  They took my umbrella and pointed me to the bar.   I was the only person sitting at the bar, and I asked the bartender which drink was her favorite. She didn't seem in the mood to chat, but recommended the Tea Rose.  It was delicious. I ended up having two while I was waiting for the rest of my party to show up.  Eventually everyone arrived, and we sat down at our table. They bring crispy flatbread and a white bean hummus-type spread to the table instead of traditional bread and butter. It was delicious and I loved that touch.  We ordered a bottle of wine and some appetizers. I got the coconut lemongrass soup, and it was phenomenal. Very different than anything I've ever tried. My boyfriend got a maki-roll for his appetizer.  It was good, but it was so big that it was hard to chew. I tried putting the whole piece in my mouth, and ended up embarassed and chewing on it for over a minute.   For my entree I got the Baramundi with lobster and gnocchi. Delicious. My boyfriend got the scallops and those were delicious as well. Perfectly cooked, which can be tough for scallops.  For dessert we split a Chocolate ganache with cherry sauce on top.  It was good, but nothing to write home about.  As you can probably tell, there is nothing wrong with the food. Everything tastes really good, and is cooked well. My only complaint is that for 4 of us, the bill was about $360 pre-tip. I paid for my drinks at the bar, and we only had one bottle of wine.  I knew what we were getting into because I'd been before, but my boyfriend and his roommate had no idea, and were a little shocked when they saw menu prices and the final bill.

2010-07-24,5.0,"I have been to Spring twice, both times for an anniversary dinners with my now-fiance, Allen.  The first time we went was for our first anniversary way back in December 2005, and we went again last month because I picked up the Groupon. I am not the type of person to give 5-star ratings out liberally, but Spring really deserves it.  I don't remember the exact details of our December 2005 meal, but the fact that any of it sticks with me at all says something about the quality of the food.  I remember an amuse bouche of some kind of maki, some kind of scallops, some lobster dumplings, some kind of white fish, and duck.  And then the meal was capped off with a shot of drinking chocolate.  Like I said, I don't remember details of the preparations, but holy shit they know what to do with duck!  I would definitely get the duck breast here again if I was to return. Anyway, fast forward to a meal I can actually remember the details of.  Like I said, we got the Groupon, so we went with the prix fixe menu and decided to each order different things to maximize what we were able to try.  We started off with a chilled onion soup amuse bouche with Thai basil.  Allen and I could have eaten several bowls - it was so good, and a great start to the meal!  The bread service was also really good and different.  We got flat bread crackers, which Allen loves, with a white bean-sesame oil puree that was really delicious.   For our first course, one of us ordered the braised short rib dumplings (I looooove slow-cooked meat), and the other got the tuna tartare (I also love raw fish) with banana miso.  Both were really good, and the banana flavor was definitely present and surprisingly pleasant and harmonious in the dish.   No duck on the menu, unfortunately, but we made out well anyway.  For the second course, we got the barramundi, which was served with yummy little parmesan-potato gnocchi, cauliflower, green beans, and a cilantro pesto.  This was also really good.  The fish was cooked really well, and I am a huge fan of cilantro, so the twist on the classic pesto was really clever and worked for me.  I will also say that I thought I was not a fan of cauliflower until I recently learned that I just wasn't eating cauliflower that was prepared properly.  After having a delicious preparation at our wedding caterer's tasting and getting some in my produce boxes and being determined to eat everything in them, no matter how much I thought I didn't like the vegetables (roast the cauliflower along with its greens with olive oil, garlic, and green onions in the oven and season with salt and pepper - it's delicious!), I have determined that I do actually like properly-prepared cauliflower.  Spring properly prepares their cauliflower - it doesn't cook the texture and flavor out of it.  The other entree we had was the seared sea scallops with roasted mushrooms, baby bok choy (one of my faves), and braised oxtails.  If there is some sort of option for you to get braised meat at this restaurant, do it.  They do such a good job, and I think that oxtail is the king of braised meats because it just gets sooooo tender in that preparation.  The scallops were perfectly seared, and the mushrooms were interesting!  I don't think there is anything I could have asked for that would have improved either of these dishes. Then, we had dessert.  Generally, with dessert, if there's no chocolate, I'm not as interested, but these were good!  The lemongrass-kaffir lime panna cotta was delicious, and it came with some fried dough - what's not to like?!  I'm not a huge fan of white chocolate, so I didn't have high hopes for the white chocolate dome, which I thought was going to be just a hard dome of white chocolate, but it was actually ice cream (or something like ice cream)!  With strawberries and rhubarb!  Which was delicious!  It wasn't super white chocolate-y, either, so I didn't have a problem with it. We had another drinking chocolate shot, this time it had a little hint of orange in it.  I love chocolate, and this was delicious.  I can always drink a ton of drinking chocolate.  Always.  We didn't have any drinks with our meal, but they did have an interesting cocktail menu that I'll definitely try if I go back.  The restaurant itself is a little pricey (even with the Groupon, which saved ups about $60), so unless you have a lot of money, this should probably be reserved for special occasions.  I'd love to go back some time, but I hear Shawn McClain, the proprietor, is leaving Chicago and closing his restaurants here! Hopefully this rumor isn't true, and we can return because this is really a great restaurant.  If it is true, get there while you can!",0.9995,0.746,0.207,0.047,0.4705510333288111

As for the entrees, the scallops were pretty good, but the mushrooms in the dish outshone the mollusks.

The decor is very minimal, and feels a little like an office space rather than a resto, but there was still a nice ambiance, probably due to low lighting, white tablecloths and tables that aren't too close together like at some places. To start, i had the raviolo which was very tasty, but not nearly as good as the raviolo from The Bristol - that one had much more flavor.  Also, i found it difficult to eat this dish out of a deep cereal type bowl.  BF had the tuna tartare and he loved it. Then we had the Thai coconut soup (so delicious!) and pork belly buns (so yummy and larger than we thought - this was very filling).  For my entree, i had the Australian Barramundi, which is a very light white seabass, on top of gnocchi and some spinach i think.  The fish was cooked perfectly, but the gnocchi didn't add anything to the dish.  BF had the scallops which he loved but he didn't care too much for the oxtail underneath the dish.  Dessert was surprisingly yummy...white chocolate ice cream dome w/rhubarb and strawberries (so light, refreshing and really, rhubarb is grossly underrated when it comes to yummy desserts!) and the key lime panna cotta - this was the best panna cotta i have ever tasted!  The doughnut on the side of it was too doughy though and not very good. Our service was excellent; our waiter, whom i'm pretty sure was French, had the most pleasant accent and was very helpful.  I had a yummy cocktail too - the Tea Rose, which had sweet tea vodka and St Germaine w/lemon - my two fave liquors in one cocktail - SCORE!  I would like to go back to Spring if it doesn't close...for those of you waiting to eat there w/your Groupon - you'd better go now!  Oh, and take the blue line...it's very convenient. :)",0.9978,0.741,0.217,0.042,0.5395575142450143

We got the additional items and the wine pairings off the ""favorites"" menu, which turned out to be an excellent idea.  I passed on the Lemongrass Prawn soup (i just had eaten waaaay too much soup that week) but I hear it was a mistake because the others went Gagapalooza over it.  Furthermore, we drank most of our wine without knowing what it was, as our server forgot to tell us what we were drinking.  Which was too bad because his voice was rather calm and soothing, like an MD going over your options with you. The oysters we started with were pretty good, and the Crispy Pork Belly/Steamed Bun was somewhat overcooked, but still savory nonetheless.  The Farm Egg Ravioli was full of truffle goodness. My entree was the Seared Maine Sea Scallops.  I completely forgot that they sat on a bed of braised oxtail, which by far was the best thing I ate that night.  With mushrooms, soy, and baby bok choy, it was one of the most flavorful things I've tasted. Apparently my dessert (which two others picked) was a big hit with the group.  Unfortunately, I really wasn't feeling the Kaffir Lim Panna Cotta and switched desserts with Baby Bok Choy, who had been eyeing my brioche donut like a salivating dog.  I liked the White Chocolate Dome I then got from him, but now I kinda feel swindled.

My husband had tuna tartare (good), Seared Maine Sea Scallops/braised oxtail/wild mushrooms/sweet soy/baby bok choy (very good); I had Braised short-rib dumplings with pickled orange rind & a coriander reduction (good but a bit too salty), Barramundi/Korean spiced potato gnocchi/brussel sprouts/almond/grilled scallion (good); for dessert we both had Kaffir Lime Panna Cotta w brioche doughnuts (excellent). The meals were good but not great & well worth it with the discount, but I would NOT return & pay full price (it wasn't THAT good). Spring's cuisine has simple, clean flavors (all well & good) BUT, at the price points they charge, I expect more sophisticated & intricate flavors; flavors that make each bite SING in your mouth & have you wondering what is this delicious morsel?",0.9459,0.786,0.146,0.068,0.5638982070561017

From the very first bit of our amuse bouche to the delightful sip of hot cocoa at the end of the meal I was thrilled with the meal. Beyond the food, our service was spot on. If I had one complaint it is that the pace of the meal was a little slow. The dining room was not packed and yet we had to wait just a few moments too long between each course. My fiancé and I both noted the extra lag between courses. The dining room itself was beautiful and the site of passing feet on the sidewalk above was an interesting sideshow to the meal. The guests at Spring were a mix of hipsters from the neighborhood and some younger families with a surprisingly high number of younger kids for an upscale place on a Thursday night. The best dish of the night without doubt were the scallops - probably the best either of us has ever had. They came with an amazing helping of pulled pork which sounded like an odd pairing of rich on top of richer but it worked.  We will be back again soon and hopefully often.",0.9728,0.828,0.151,0.021,0.39260208926875595

So in addition to the three course prix fixe, we all had the additions, which sounded too good to pass. However, we did end up with way too much food and wine. OMGSOSTUFFEDandDRUNK.  The oysters were absolutely delicious. Mattycakes didn't like his though.  The tuna tartare was light and fresh. Even better than I remembered.  Next we had a delicious soup (somebody please remind me what kind!) and the pork belly bao. The pork belly was overcooked, but it was still very good.  I had their sea scallops. If I wasn't so full, I would have been able to finish the whole thing. Three large scallops were cooked perfectly with BABY BOK CHOY and braised oxtail and chanterelle mushrooms.  The Kaffir Lime Panna Cotta was a nice way to end our meal.  We did the wine pairing for $18, and while it was good, we had no idea what we were drinking for most of our dinner.  Here are some ridiculous things said by my dining companion, Mattycakes. ""Are your scallops boring?"" ""No thanks. I hate Reisling."" ""Yeah. These scallops are kind of boring.""

2010-07-12,4.0,"(Still) like a Spring chicken.  Once upon a time Spring was my favorite restaurant in Chicago. I must have been here for at least a half dozen various birthday parties, on multiple business dinners and for countless dates. Hey, a lame duck boy is most easily remedied with McClain braised duck and gnocchi. True that! Granted, those were many moons ago as reflected by my lack of Yelp review for them and that this most recent visit to use my quickly snatched up Groupon was the first one in almost 6 years. Whoa.  I'm sad to say this review may be too little too late as we found out this past week that Spring restaurant is actually for sale. The almost 10 year run was certainly a good one and if you haven't been yet, you should certainly get in to sample some of Chef Shawn's original creations that put him on the culinary map before Green Zebra and Custom House were ever fixtures on our food scene. Try to not mind the slightly tired decor or the fact that this locale is not nearly as well-trafficked as it once was. Lackadaisical service (ahem, our server neglected to announce 3 of our 4 wine pairings) and very quiet, very vacant surrounds are now what accompanies the fortunately still fabulous food.  The Groupon 'favorites' 3-course prixe fixe menu with optional app, mid-course and small entree dish additions as well as a wine pairing (yes, we did all of the above) were a fantastic - though truly gluttonous - way to try one of everything before bidding a fond adieu to this classically delicious eatery. With only the 'bloody mary' Kusshi Oysters dish being debated on tastiness, the rest was all agreed upon as absolutely amazing and looked a little somethin' like this......  * Farm Egg Ravioli/brown butter/white truffle/smoked potato // Whoa. It was to-die-for. Perfect, comforting, rich, lovely, truffle wondrous.  * Crispy Pork Belly/Chinese steamed buns/pickled cucumber/Thai basil & cilantro // Slightly overcooked, but incredibly savory and tangy in porktastic flavor.  * Lemongrass Coconut Soup/prawn dumplings/Thai chili/shaved shiitake/kaffir lime // Best.Soup.Ever. Don't miss this luscious, creamy, spicy, sweet, filling fabulous treat.  * Seared Maine Sea Scallops/braised oxtail/wild mushrooms/sweet soy/baby bok choy // BABY BOK CHOY!! The best Lollycakes nickname yet gives birth to itself.  * Australian Barramundi/Korean spiced potato gnocchi/brussel sprouts/almond/grilled scallion // Mmmm, light, fresh, flavorful, gorgeous. Delightful Summer dish award.  * Kaffir Lime Panna Cotta and White Chocolate Dome Desserts // Panna Cotta for the win! Twas the darling of our sweets lovers. So good. So full. So indulged.

2010-07-09,4.0,"Our experience at the spring room was a mixed bag.  A few things were just amazing.  A few were underwhelming.  We had a 5 course tasting. First the less favorable things:  In terms of the dining environment, I liked the decor.  It was modern and chic.  And it really did give off that ""fresh"" feeling you'd expect.  However, for whatever reason, though we were there at peak, the restaurant was relatively sparse.  And that never feels right.  As for the food, the quality was great.  However, there were a few things, I discovered, my wife simply did not like.  This may not reflect on the dishes themselves, but just a personal preference.  For instance, I really liked the oysters, but she is just not a fan.   On the positive side, we were floored by the toro that was used in one of our dishes.  It was sliced thinly with just a touch of olive oil and scallions, served with baby arugula with a balsamic drizzle.  It was amazing... among the best raw fish I've had.  We also really enjoyed a seared skate (I think it was skate) that was just crisp on the outside but fluffy on the inside.  Perfect. The wine selection was par for the course.. not remarkable either way.  But serviceable.  As for the wait staff, unlike some of the other reviewers, we felt just fine with them.  The initial wait for the first course was longer than we had hoped.  But they were friendly enough.

So I'm thinking ok no biggie . . .  we sat at the bar and fortunately the bar tender was nice.  We ate off the menu.  Food was not all it was hyped up to be and the portions were tiny.  The ravioli appetizer ($14) was a single 1 inch by 1 inch piece of stuffed ravioli that looked pretty, but really?  The rest of dinner was so so.   The whole time we had been courteous to the rude host at the front desk.  As we were walking out we did not receive the expected ""thanks for dining with us""  Instead the host made a snide very insulting comment to us.

2010-06-28,1.0,"Terrible. Maine scallops with oxtail: Our fist reaction was that it was one of the saltiest things we've ever eaten - we couldn't even taste the scallop itself. I then tasted a fellow patron's skatewing - water was immediately required; in fact, one of the owners of that skatewing reported that it was ""so salty that it was bitter."" However, the service was so slow that we didn't want to send it back and wait for replacements (plus I was with individuals who don't believe in sending food back). Let's remember that there does exist other flavors besides salty, and that high blood pressure is a serious problem in this country. My one star is for the diligent water replenishment (which was greatly appreciated given the mountains of salt we ingested) and the desserts (panna cotta and white chocolate dome), which were both fairly good. Note: My original 1-star review along with a couple other 1- and 2-star Spring reviews were counseled into another thread; however, in the interest of being fair to Yelp users looking for food info, I had to pull this portion of the review and move it back onto the Spring page - because the food was indeed terrible.

Spring did a fantastic job with the Groupon and I have no doubt they will do an equally great job with Yelp Eats. They had a special menu with the Groupon choices as well as a few add-ons and some inexpensive bottles of wine. They really embraced the Groupon experience. I had the Braised short-rib dumplings with pickled orange rind and a coriander reduction as an appetizer which was good. It wasn't anything special but it was good. Incidentally, this choice is not on the Yelp Eats menu.  For my main, I went with the Maine Diver Sea Scallops, roasted mushrooms, braised oxtail, sweet soy which was fantastic. I am not a big fish fan but the scallops were perfect, the oxtail was simply exquisite and the flavors blended together quite nicely. For dessert, I went with the Lemongrass & Kaffir Lime Panna Cotta: passion fruit gelee, brioche doughnuts. My girlfriend had the other choice: White-chocolate dome, with strawberries, rhubarb, and rosewater; so I got to try both. I really liked the panna cotta and the brioche doughnuts.

2010-06-21,5.0,"We did the 5-course tasting menu, where the chef basically just cooks whatever he feels like (they ask about allergies or dislikes before he plans it out, but we just said go for whatever.)  You get:  1 cold appetizer, 1 hot appetizer, a fish course, a meat course, and dessert.  Except I feel like there were more like 8 courses because they threw in little extras along the way.  You don't find out what you're getting until they bring it to the table. The first thing they brought out were little shot glasses of a chilled soup.  It was some sort of potato soup.  It was really good.   Then they brought out two oysters for each of us.  (menu says:  Kusshi Oyster 'bloody mary'/grated fresh wasabi) My first time ever trying oysters.  My husband has had them before and was not a fan.  He  LOVED these though.  I think he said those were his favorite thing from the whole night..  I liked them.  Not bad.  They tasted really fresh.   They also brought out this cracker type bread with a hummus-y dip with sesame seeds in it that stayed on the table the whole meal.  None of this counted as one of the courses. So the cold appetizer was tuna tartare with banana foam and it had nuts mixed in.  SO GOOD!  And I hate tuna.  I mean it is not the tuna I am used to.  More like sushi tuna I guess.  Tuna steaks?  I loved it though to my surprise.  I am going to have to try to order that elsewhere.  Apparently we were supposed to use the chopsticks for this because they took those away after but we used forks.  Whoops! The hot appetizer was a soup (menu:  Lemongrass & Coconut Soup -prawn dumplings/Thai chili/shaved shiitake/kaffir lime)  LOVED it.  Wanted to pick it up and drink it.  The fish course was halibut with mushrooms and asparagus and onions and pasta stuffed with a really smokey-tasting cheese sauce. The fish was good (I liked all the vegetables and pasta better though) The meat course was duck!  Which I have not had before but I liked it.  It was sliced up, like tenderloin and on a bed of mushroom-y risotto type stuff.  And there was edamame.  We really liked it.  We were starting to get nervous at this point because it was like 7:30 and we had tickets for a show starting at 8, so my husband  asked the waiter if we would have a hard time getting a cab, and he was like, what time is your show?  And we told him 8 and he was like, we will get you there.  Then there was dessert: a chocolate brownie/mousse situation and SHOCKER, I loved it.  It had little crystals of salt on top which I think was the key to my enjoying it.  It also had some kind of ice cream situation that I tasted but did not like and a miniature oreo cookie type thing that I did not like that much either. The brownie thing was awesome though. And then they brought us a little shot of hot chocolate.  When we walked out the door, there our cab was.  It was a great experience.  Our cab driver drove like a crazy person and got us there right on time but we both almost barfed up our very fancy meal in the car.",0.9971,0.759,0.172,0.069,0.6219642857142859

2010-05-02,4.0,"Spring is one of those restaurants where it's absolutely impossible to enter without expectations.  Unless you can flaunt a couple benjamins without a batter of the eye, most diners likely enter having read at least some of the plethoras of reviews about the restaurant, both on yelp and in more conventional sources.   The experience of Spring really starts as soon as you enter the restaurant.  The decor induces a sense of zen and calm, and the soft, beat-ful music in the background creates a nouveau atmosphere.  Seating in the dining room leaves lots of room to maneuver, and the lighting adds an over-arching atmosphere that this is the place to relax, forget about time, and indulge in the gastronomic senses. We came with the Groupon deal, and both had the 3 course meal.  We also opted for the $18 wine accompaniment.  We chose the braised short rib dumplings and tuna tartare for appetizer, seared scallops with oxtail and barramundi with gnocci for the main course, and the panna cotta and doma for dessert.  The appetizers were good, but not what you would expect of a place like Spring.  The dumplings were more salty than most would have preferred, and the tuna tartare, while delicious, did not scream ""i want more there isn't enough gimme more.""  The main courses, however, were exactly what the appetizers weren't: full of flavor, distinctness, and left you wanting for more.  The oxtail were braised with some delicious mushrooms and the scallops were seared to perfection.  The barramundi had a crisp outer and the gnocci were just chewy enough.  Both dishes were also accompanied by some asian vegetables.  Added to the zen feel of the restaurant, at this point we decided Spring must have been started by an upscale Asian couple.  The dessert, however, was very European.  The doma was light, chilled to perfection, and the panna cotta came with a donut that had its hole plugged with a mini-donut hole.  We loved that it was still warm when we got it. All in all, the food was very good...but not great.  What made the meal was the great atmosphere and wonderful staff.  Our server explained each wine accompaniment to exquisite detail, and our water glasses were never even near the half-empty zone.  Then there were the little things, such as the busboys delivering dishes to the diner's left side.....both diners' left sides, and the additional taste portions of the chef's latest creations, and the overall clean feel of the area. All in all, the only reason that the dinner did not warrant a 5 star rating was because of its exceedingly high expectations.  Had this been any other restaurant, this would have been a easy 10 stars out of 5.  However, given the fact that our dinner, had it been without the Groupon offer, would have been $200, we expected to leave the restaurant vowing to return.  That we only did so under the premise of another Groupon offer made this, unfortuantely, a 4 star experience.  Nevertheless, come restaurant week or another similar offer...count us in!",0.9927,0.866,0.105,0.03,0.5151694139194137

Again, another episode of standing and waving was required.   Ridiculous.   Then we were seated.  First I have to say we were seated at a weird table - it was kinda in the middle of an aisle-way and was separate from the other patrons - it felt like they had set up folding chairs and stuck us there (which wasn't the case)....it was odd.  Our waiter was very nice and gave us some recommendations....sadly, the food was terrible.  I would have dumped a cup of salt on my fish just to give it some flavor.  Yuck.  Very bland.  On top of that, they forgot my side order, which was very frustrating.   At the end of the meal (which none of us took more than 3-4 bites of), the waiter asked if he should call us a taxi.  We said that would be great.  He told us the hostess would alert us when the taxi arrived...twenty minutes later, still no taxi.  The waiter - who SUGGESTED the taxi - forgot!  UGH!   One star for the decor in the bar area and one star for having food that didn't give me hives or food poising.  Bland food and ridiculously terrible services gets you 2 stars.",-0.9349,0.81,0.08,0.11,0.6661695906432749

I walk in, say I'm there to buy a gc, and I'm told I have to wait 20 min until he can help me.  Ok...there's no one around, no crazy rush, nothing, but no reason is given.  The wait wasn't doable for me, especially when I'm depending on CTA buses to get me home.  So I'm told I can come back and get it another time.  Hmm...I don't live close by, her bday is in a couple of days, and why should I be inconvenienced?  Finally the guy offers to send it next-day air, but immediately starts hemming & hawing - wants to know if my friend lives close by and it can be dropped off instead, why can't I just wait the 20 min, blah blah blah.  I said no, next-day air is fine.  I whip out my cc and driver's license, making it super easy to get my addy and take my payment.  Again he tries to take back the shipping offer. Just my luck some customers come in and he walks away, ignoring me while he checks their stuff, seats them, and shoots the shit.  The best part is, another staff member offered to do it for him so he could finish helping me out, and he said I could wait.  At least I know he's friendly w/ some people.  Of course, he comes back and starts the 20 min argument again.  At this point I've been there for a good 10-15 min and I'm done.        The best part - this guy is Fletcher, their manager.  My girl now knows she is forbidden to talk to me about this place, and if she eats there, I don't need to know about it.  I refuse to be treated as a disturbance - and at this point I had to make a decision between getting my friend the perfect gift, and giving my money to an establishment that made me feel like shit.  Sorry chica, but trust me, there's a better place out there, and I'll find it.",0.9966,0.699,0.215,0.086,0.5882653061224491

The creme fraiche and wasabi dip for the tuna roll was good. The bean dip for the crackers was very oily.  And then ... A HAIR in the bean dip. Pointed this out to the waiter and did he apologize? Not really. He took it away and had the bus boy bring more. Did the manager come over to say anything? NO. Wasn't looking for them to comp anything but they could have said ""Coffee is on us"". Did they ? NO  The manager asked how dinner was as we were leaving and when I said ""fine except for the hair in the dip he was surprised and said ""nobody told me about that"". I told him the waiter never apologized and because of the way it was handled I would never be back even though the food was good. At that time the phone rang and instead of letting the one of the 2 women working at the desk with him to answer it he chose to ignore us and answer the phone.  Now I see why the waiter never did anything more because that's the style and attitude management teaches their staff. It's too bad because they have interesting menu and would have liked to go back and to try other items. If you don't mind that you that you could have hair in your food and not have the staff recognize that and that it doesn't belong then feel free to go to Spring. If you are looking for only eatable items in your food then you might want to stay away until management decides they need to pay attention more.  As a side note, This was for a 6:00 reservation and the restaurant was maybe 1/3 full and never did the manager come by to see how dinner was or if everything was OK.

Which was too bad, because this is a pretty great place. The service was phenomenal - probably among the best I've had anywhere. And I don't get the sense that our server's attentiveness was just a result of the fact that it was a slow night.

Staff was helpful and friendly but didn't hover or over-explain ever detail of our meal. For starters, I had the lemongrass and coconut soup (it had a light spiciness to it which was delicious) and my husband got the grilled octopus (good but nothing special). We shared the organic green salad (which was definitely a good sharing size). It was really nice - fresh, lightly dressed, and quite tasty.  Our main entrees were the Australian Barramundi for me (served with Korean spiced potato gnocchi/ Brussel sprouts/almond/grilled scallion) and the Bouillabaisse for my husband. My entree was good. Everything blended well together. My husband enjoyed the bouillabaisse, which was full of a lot of different kinds of high-quality seafood, though it could have used a little more broth.  Overall, our experience at Spring was lovely. It's a bit on the pricier side, so it might be best as a spot to go for special occassions, especially if you live in the neighborhood.

The pork wasn't crispy and it was smothered in an Asian-style BBQ sauce that was too sweet and could have easily come out of a jar.   I had the Lemongrass & Coconut soup next.  It was creamy and perfectly spicy.  The shrimp won-ton was just average but that didn't matter.  The soup was the highlight of the course.  My fiance had the sweet potato soup.  The soup was poured onto fried apple fritters.  The mix of sweet and savory had her wanting more. The entrees were next.  I got the duck and she got the sea bass.  The duck was expertly cooked.  The meat was tender, gamy and melted in my mouth.  The skin was moist but still a little crispy and had just the right amount of fattiness.  Unfortunately, the sea bass was a little bland and while the thicker parts were cooked just right, the thinner parts were overcooked and dry. My dessert was the Grapefruit Sorbet.  It was served with thin slices of kumquat and grapefruit all in a shallow pool of tea infused champagne.  One bite and I went into autopilot.  Scoop sorbet, put in mouth, repeat.  It was a perfect palate cleanser.   The fiance ordered the Sweet Bites; a three part dessert consisting of an apple turnover in a thin eggroll shell, something that can best be described as a deconstructed Snickers bar and an ice cream sandwich made with butter cookies and amaretto pear ice cream.  The sandwich was definitely the best of the three offering more than just sweetness. Final verdict: Staff was wonderfully friendly.  Duck was the best I've ever had.  Great soups.  Great desserts.  However, Spring lacks the consistency that one would expect from a restaurant of its caliber.  Perhaps my expectations were just too high after having eaten a bunch of times at Green Zebra.  Economically speaking, the bill that I paid at the end of the night was not justified by the meal I ate.",0.9983,0.769,0.209,0.022,0.6186926406926406
2010-02-23,5.0,"Spring - congratulations, you are my favorite restaurant in Chicago. Came here on Sunday to use my groupon - late, but they still accepted it for $50 off.  From the second we walked in from the snow/slush mix I could tell that this place was different.  The host took our hats and jackets and hung them for us, while engaging us in light conversation.  ""Did you walk here?"" he asked.  I WISH - but just to be asked that question set my heart ablaze with excitement.  Could this restaurant be the one?  He helped both of us to ge seated, an unusual treat since I rarely have my seat pushed in for me.  Our server, Christo, came quickly and was quite attentive throughout the evening.  He helped me to select a beer, a blonde ale which happens to be France's only distinctive beer style.  I really just wanted something to sip throughout the meal, and I was in the mood for beer.  My guest and I had decided that we would split the pork belly appetizer and then I would get the sea bass and she the duck.  After hearing that they had a tasting menu, I opted for that instead of the sea bass.  I pushed that voice out of my head saying, ""but the cost, the COST"" and went with it anyway.  FYI, the tasting menu is $75 for six courses.  Shortly after ordering we were served some crispy flatbread and white bean puree.  The puree was incredibly addictive.  They made it with sesame oil, which is the first flavor to hit your tongue.  By the time you are finished chewing and swallowing the bread/puree mixture, your mouth is ready for another hit of the sesame oil.  We ended up going through three bowls of the puree.  Extra points to them for offering more!  Shortly after ordering, while eating our bread, the server presented us with samples of butternut squash soup, with apples and raisins mixed in, compliments of the chef.  What???  OK.  I'll sip this delicious sake glass full of soup.  My first dish was an oyster, which was naturally salty and served with bloody mary wasabi on a bed of sea salt (separated by the shell).  I ended up eating the wasabi first then putting some of the sea salt on the oyster (oops) so this dish was a bust but the oyster itself I could tell was tender and naturally salty.   They served my second dish, ""charred tuna sashimi nicoise"" and the pork belly at the same time.  I'll start with the crispy pork belly.  It was just the right amount of crispy, and the flavor of the pork melted in my mouth.  The buns were chewy but equally melty so the chewiness offset the crispiness of the pork wonderfully.  The pickled cucumber threw my head for a loop because it was exactly what it should have been.  Oh how my taste buds delighted in the flavor.  Now on to the charred tuna sashimi nicoise.  When the server set the plate down, I was scared.  I enjoy sushi, but get nervous for sashimi - well before this.  The tuna was charred with black peppercorns which gave it a spicy flavor while the tuna tasted flaky/mushy.  The egg, potato, and tomatoes on the side each provided a different flavor/texture accent, so that there was this crazy balance of flavors and textures on the plate.   The third dish served, the fam egg ravioli was another excellent balance of flavors and textures.  The chef included ox-tail with it, on their menu they offer it as vegetarian.  In fact, I was thrown off at the time.  I was satisfied with this being my meat dish.  My barramundi was served at the same time as my guest's duck, and we shared both.  The duck was tender with a crispy crust.  The barramundi was flaky, well seasoned, and the sides complimented the barramundi and kept the focus on the fish.    After about twenty minutes of letting the fish sit, the server came back, this time with a short rib!  I was shocked.  Another course?  But I was already full!  The shortrib was very tender, juicy, and savory.  My guest's eyes lit up upon tasting the meat.  Fantastique.  Finally, for dessert, they served us dark chocolate fudge (I think it was fudge).  My guest doesn't like dark chocolate but she loved this dessert.  It just goes to show that if you keep an open mind, you never can know what you might enjoy.  Actually, I said finally but just as our meal opened with a sample of soup, our meal concluded with a sample of hot chocolate spiced with sage.  Another sample?  As our server brought it out, he intentionally stated, ""with this last course, your tasting is complete.""  So all told, I had an 8-course dinner - and easily the best meal I've had in my life.  EVER. yes, EVER.  I've had food that was equally well prepared before, but not in such a welcoming, friendly enviroment.  My guest and I were both wearing jeans.  I was wearing a polo and my hair was probably disheveled, but it didn't matter.  They were just as happy to serve us as we were.  And that's why I love Spring.  I love you.",0.9988,0.84,0.135,0.025,0.509697760382692

Let me start out with a bit of advice- LET YOUR SERVER PAIR YOUR WINE!  Their wine list is extensive and full of gems I never would have thought of trying with my meal.  We both agreed that the food was amazing, but the wine pairing enhanced the whole experience ten fold.  Not only that, but our server (Mary) was so knowledgeable in her craft that I felt like I was attending a prestigious wine school.  A ""gamey"" sake to accompany the earthy flavors of the sweet potato with the hamachi tuna and a sake referred to as ""divine droplets"" to accompany my light and creamy yellow tail maki.... genius!  I could go on forever.... But instead I will delve into the foodgasm that occurred in my mouth from the least likely source.  I don't eat bacon because, for lack of better words, I think its icky.  I know that statement stirs up strong emotions for some so please don't hate me.  When you are having a grown up dinner at a restaurant like Spring and they bring pork belly to the table, you can't play the icky card.  You have to eat at least a bite..... and Ah Mah Gawd.....it was fantastic!  The crisp of the bacon, the sweet of the sticky buns, hot of the chili sauce and tang of the pickles.....it was ridiculous.....I went back for a second forkful.  (I also ate the octopus.  Read the above story again and replace bacon with octopus.) The surprise fave item of the night was the lemongrass coconut soup- it is such a perfect harmony of amazing flavors in your mouth- sweet, and salty with a perfect little shrimp delight packaged in Won ton.  I never expected to be so enthusiastic about a soup course.   Of course I had to have a bit of desert, accompanied by a delicious port- it was a take on a smore with little salty butter cookies with merengue sandwiched between served on hot melty rich chocolate.  Phenom!  Totally worth nearly exploding. So, when you are lucky enough to have a dinner at Spring, let your server pair your wine, order things you wouldn't normally eat, and just like Green Zebra- put a little of each element of the plate into each bite and you too will blush at the table.",0.999,0.749,0.24,0.011,0.5523333333333332

In their regular menu, there are several delicious and varied vegetarian options. For the Valentine menu, our friend got a sheet of selections that was about a third the size of ours. One choice for starter course, maybe 2 for the entree?. That seems a little thin for me.  Before the courses came out, we all got a shooter of the Butternut Squash/Coconut soup. Delicious. Made everyone disspointed they hadn't chosen that for their soup/salad course. My first course was the Foie Gras Gyoza, a sort of mini pot sticker or dumpling filled with the Foie Gras. Light & delicious - it was topped with some toasted pumpkin seeds and the presentation was spectacular. Next course was soup/salad - I was the only one who had actually chosen the Squash soup - and it was even better in a larger portion. Topped with some small slices of green apple and some scallion I think? just delicious. Entree course for me was the Maine Diver Scallops. Just divine. On a bed of delicious mushrooms (chanterelles, I think?). Just a light sauce over the scallops, not too sweet, not too salty. Dessert course - I chose the Chocolate Mousse cake, which was light and delicious. It was presented with a savory foam which we couldn't decipher. I thought it tasted like hops, so maybe it was an ale of some kind? We all tried it, and thought it was interesting - not gross or anything, just not our style. From the moment we walked in the door, the service was impeccable. From free coat check, to the host who engaged our pregnant friend in conversation about her due date, etc, to the staff at the table. My fear was due to the ""coupon"" we would be treated differently somehow, and that was not the case.  We all agreed it was a lovely experience, and we will defintely be back.",0.9966,0.812,0.17,0.018,0.5687012263099219
2010-02-16,4.0,"What a swanky date place!  Very thrilled that its emphasis is on seafood and Asian-fusion cuisine.  We thought the service was great too.  The hostess offers to take your coat at the door, and our server was extremely friendly and polite and checked on us at the right times.  He wasn't difficult to flag down either.  He even asked all his patrons if they wanted him to hail a cab for them at the end of their meals. The dining room is sunken in, so naturally, it has tall ceilings, and it can get noisy.  You are also seated pretty close to the party next to you, so although it's dim and you dine by candlelight, it's not a totally intimate dining experience. For our appetizer, we had the pork belly buns (3 for $13).  This was probably our favorite.  No complaints at all.  The meat was crispy on the outside and tender and flavorful (sweet & tangy) on the inside.  For our entrees, we ordered the scallops ($32), which is a unique spin on surf & turf (4 Maine scallops on top of braised oxtail).  It was definitely the better of the two entrees we tried, but it wasn't perfect.  The scallops were seared just right, but the oxtail sauce was a little too sweet and heavy.  The Pacific sea bass ($31) was also seared to a medium crust which was great, but the egg pasta it sat on top of didn't taste good.  I wasn't a fan of the tapenade.  For dessert, we ordered the trio of  ""sweet bites"" which weren't all that satisfying either.  I would suggest passing on desserts. Be sure to make reservations no less than a week in advance if you want a normal time for a weekend dinner.  I called on a Tuesday, and their only available seating was that Saturday night at 9:30pm for our party of 2.  Also, parking is difficult in this area on the weekends, but they offer valet service.",0.9694,0.811,0.131,0.057,0.6076631393298059

When we sat, we immediately were served flat bread with some good butter. The server was very helpful in describing the menu and helping us choose what to get.  He also brought out a taste of the organic greens salad, which had butternut squash/candied hazelnuts and a great fruity dressing.  This was very good.  For variety's sake, we ordered other starters. I started with one oyster (I love that there was no minimum), which was great.  We also got the farm egg ravioli, which had a subtle but delicious flavor.  Our other starter was the sweet potato soup, which was also very tasty. Mains: Sea Bass - I liked everything about this dish.  All of the flavors worked wonderfully together Barramundi - This was also an exceptional dish, with delicious ""korean spiced"" gnocchi and Brussel sprouts on the side Dessert - we didn't order dessert because we were so full, but our server brought us something anyway.  I think it was a shot of hot chocolate, which was the perfect amount to finish the meal. Cocktails - We each got one cocktail.  The Tea cocktail was good, but I only had one sip.  I had a cocktail that was similar to an old fashioned, which was awesome. The service was also great.  My water glass was never more than half empty.  Also, our server checked on us an appropriate amount of times.  I feel like we had a total of 3 tastes, but I cannot remember the one other than the salad and chocolate.  If I remember, I will add it.  The ambiance and music selection was also excellent.",0.9965,0.771,0.21,0.018,0.6262962962962964

P is for Pacific Bass.  A seared fillet served with tagliatelle pasta, artichoke, parsley and lemon emulsion.  This was a deeply sensual dish, full of robust flavour and textures.  My favourite part of the meal for sure.  R is for a kick ass risotto!  with lovely, huge chunks of Maine Lobster - combined with Madeira and cauliflower foam it was on par with my risotto.  And no one makes risotto like me. For realz, yo.    I is for the ""Intentional"" Chocolate Mousse Cake, served with hazelnut espuma and pralines.  This was the only disappointment in the whole meal, as the chocolate flavour was too mild in my opinion.  I had been hoping for something a bit heavier and richer.  But the tiny cup of hot chocolate they gave at the end totally made up for that!  It was so creamy and decadent.  Yum! N is for Natural decor.  Lots of wood and glass in a very clean, modern style.  I disliked the lighting as it seemed too dim and had a fluorescent quality to it which was displeasing.  Especially in the restroom - do we need to have a dimly lit bathroom?  Um, no.  Light please! I need to be able to find the soap dispenser! G is for a Great time.  I really enjoyed my experience at Spring and liked the highly attentive service.  Plus, it is honestly the only place in the midwest that meets my rigorous New England standards when it comes to seafood.  Spring is pricey but worth it for a special night out.  I would definitely go again.",0.9711,0.833,0.13,0.037,0.6393897852988761

The Mousse was actually the white frosting/icing part and not the chocolate cake which was dense and dry. The other dessert Pineapple upside down cake was another dry cake, chopped pineapple, which tasted like canned but not even sweet. It was accompanied by an ice cream I can only describe tasting like Murphy's Oil Floor soap. Really. On Valentine's Day the dessert course should have shined. Service was attentive and good.

The Food: 5 stars for the food.  A couple people had been telling me how great Spring is.   They were right about the food.   Based on the food itself, I would say this is one of the top 5 American cuisine restaurants I have been to in Chicago.   My favorite dish was the scallops with braised oxtail.  It is an odd sounding combo, but it works so well that it is one of the best surf and turf dishes I have ever had.  The Service: 2 stars for the service.  For this class and price range of restaurant, I expect impeccable service.   The waiter that took the order was great for that portion of the meal.   He helped me figure out my order and recommended dishes that were great.   However, his service and other servers service were horrible throughout the rest of the meal.  I was left without silverware for 2-3 dishes and had to  take silverware from the unused table next to me on the multiple occasions.   Servers weren't even around enough for me to flag them down to deliver me silverware!  I could understand this if it were a very busy night of service, however, I went during the middle of the week and the restaurant was only half full.  Mediocre service at a lower price point, I can deal with.   Crappy service at Spring means I will not return.",0.9559,0.82,0.125,0.056,0.4835945767195768

We started with the complimentary white bean puree and crackers.  I liked it, my fiance found it salty.  We were also given an amuse soup shot- squash and coconut, I believe, with a spicy aftertaste.  The menu has several appealing vegetarian options, all thoughtfully indicated with a (V) symbol before the name, which was great- no having to guess about ingredients!  For appetizers, I had the delicious Organic Greens Salad with tangy ginger dressing and apples, butternut squash, and sweet hazelnuts.  Very good, and a bigger portion than I had been expecting.  I followed this with a new sweet potato soup, this one vegetarian but with the same apple fritters as the old one.  It was creamy and flavorful.  The fiance had four oysters to start and followed it with the grilled octopus, both of which were proclaimed delicious, although he preferred the oysters slightly. For my main course, I had the farm egg ravioli- it's literally just one big ravioli, and it was delicious.  The egg inside runs out when you cut into the ravioli and mixes immediately with the truffle and brown butter sauce.  Fiance had the Australian Barramundi and exclaimed about the crispy outside and flaky inside.  We followed it up with a dessert each- the pear tart with transcendent gorgonzola-fig ice cream for me, and the chocolate cake for him.  My dessert won hands down.  We also had a good bottle of South African Chenin Blanc for dinner, and each had the recommended dessert drink accompaniment, which meant rich port for me and a strong aged brandy for him.   Finally, after having found out that we are planning our wedding (because we were looking at invitation samples before the food came), our server brought out complimentary smores from the kitchen.  Paired with spicy hot chocolate, it was the perfect end to the meal.  Overall, we had impeccable, friendly service and delicious food.  I can't wait to go back.",0.9973,0.798,0.177,0.025,0.483458660680883

I initially took this as a bad sign (if you're dead empty and offering groupons to drum up business, chances are you're doing something wrong), but the place was fully packed by the time we were done with dinner. We ordered some kind of egg ravioli to share, each got sweet potato soup, split the roast organic chicken, added a side of fingerling potatoes and then splurged on 2 desserts--a lemon pound cake with flavored whipped cream and a tray of mini desserts like mint ice cream sandwiches. On top of that, they brought out a free soup shot at the beginning, some pita chips and hummus, and closed with a shot of spiced hot cocoa. Overall, a great experience and truly amazing meal with so many different flavors, though not quite amazing enough to justify paying full price for it.

2010-02-12,5.0,"My lesson learned from the Spring Restaurant is that looks can be deceiving. The place is stuffy, I mean Bushwood Country Club stuffy. The staff was cordial enough, but none of them were smiling. Our server even had a European accent (even though he is probably from Grand Rapids). I'm a big fan of fun dining experiences, so it disturbed me that the staff was so stoic. But like I said, looks can be deceiving.   The Decor is a bit much. It's that Art Deco, linear crap that usually annoys the hell out of me. Spring had the look of a restaurant in a real fancy hotel.   The food on the other hand is out of this world. The atmosphere may not have been fun, but the food definitely was. There was a set menu for Valentine's day weekend. They gave you three different choices for every course. Each course seemed to get better and better.   I started out with the Foie Gras appetizer. If loving Foie Gras is wrong, I don't want to be right. I know all the arguments for the banning of this delicacy, but it tastes so good that my conscience is clear. For those of you who have never tried it, it tastes like the richest, creamiest liver sausage that you have ever eaten.   My second course was Squash-Coconut soup. You would think that this a strange combination, but it worked quite well. The taste and texture were wonderful.   For the main course, I had their BBQ short  ribs. Picture the most delicious, Pot roast ever (Carolynne's description). It was basted to perfection.   My choice for the desert portion was the Chocolate Mouse. I'm not a big desert guy, but the mouse a rich and creamy delight. It was a wonderful encore to our meal.   The bottom line is that Spring is all about the food. It's an example of a place that is actually worth the hefty price tag. Unless I inherit a trust fund, I doubt if I will have the chance to go back anytime soon. But If I was entertaining clients, Spring would be at the top of my list of diner choices. The staff was prompt and attentive and the food was unique and delicious.

We had a party of 4 (reservation) and when the other 2 arrived it took a little while for us to get seated which was slightly annoying.  Here's what was ordered (or brought out to sample) and what the general verdict was for each dish: Grilled octopus - I didn't try it but the others didn't like it all that much. Crispy pork belly - Really great. Moist and tender with great PORK flavor, the sauce it was served with had a nice kick and the cucumber added some nice contrast. I could have gone without the potato thing though. Sweet potato soup - Apparently very rich and creamy. The fritters served with the soup were good, I was told. Lemongrass/coconut soup - Not really a fan of this. The lemongrass flavor was alright but the coconut was pretty overwhelming. It would have been nice to have some more spiciness in this. White bean puree - Decent. OK to munch on while waiting for the starters but it was pretty uninteresting. Pacific sea bass - Fish was underseasoned but nicely cooked. Eating the fish with all the other stuff (pasta, peppers, etc.) helped but I still feel it could have used more seasoning. Roasted organic chicken - Chicken was cooked well. The white meat was very moist with great flavor, and the sauce it was served with was very nice and flavorful. NY strip steak - The steak itself was good. Nothing spectacular, it just tasted like good (not great) steak. The short rib dumplings, however, were amazing. The balsamic/mushroom reduction was very very good and really helped bring the whole dish together.  Hot chocolate w/curry spice - I liked it. It tasted pretty much like you'd expect.. hot chocolate with a hint of curry. The others didn't like it though. Sweet bites dessert - Trio of small dessert bites, two pieces of each kind. Unfortunately I don't remember what one was but the only one that I really liked was the ice cream sandwiches. The apple turnover was OK. The service was fine but nothing special.

BF and I ventured over for an early Sunday dinner (made reservations for 6:30 but called to change it to 6 with no issue) and the place was pretty quiet but filled up as we enjoyed our meal.  i ordered a tea rose cocktail and MY GOODNESS was it delicious! it is the best cocktail i have ever had; i am a big fan of tea and the name of this just lured me to ordering it and i was not disappointed.  the subtle sweetness in the tea infused vodka (i swear it tasted like it had lychee or something) tasted almost like heaven - yelpers are right: the cocktails here ARE delicious! it definitely made me a happy girl (asian flush as well).  For appetizers, we started off with the foie gras gyoza that everyone raves about plus 2 oysters for moi! Unfortunately, I think these were both overrated... gyoza was good and i understand foie gras is expensive (and perhaps I don't know how to appreciate it) but you get 4 small pieces and it costs you $20 bucks. i would quickly trade that $20 and pick up 4 packets of korean dumplings at hmart and have the BF's dad make me some fried maandoo.  as for the oysters, nothing spectacular either altho it tasted fresh but the oysters are more the size of clams than a typical oyster.  For the entrees, we ordered the scallops and ny strip.  omg, the scallops were sooo good and the oxtail with mushrooms that came with it were equally as delicious. i definitely recommend this dish - you might not think scallops can fill you up but the scallops are huge! i ""forced"" the bf to assist me in finishing this.  however, do not order the ny strip... bf wanted heavy meat and not fish so ordered the ny strip.  it definitely lacks a lot of flavor and should just be taken off the menu - not impressed especially if its one of the most expensive items.  we were too full for dessert but our waitress gave us free smores in celebration of my birthday. they were pretty darn good too.   throughout dinner, we got free samples such as their butternut squash/coconut soup (i am not a fan since i dislike coconut but bf enjoyed) and their hot chocolate (not a fan because it tasted like it had herbs in it and did not go well with the smores).  i have mixed feelings about spring, some things were pretty fantastic (cocktail + scallops) while others things were subpar (steak) with lots in the middle (gyoza + oysters).  not sure how likely i will venture back to spring since a full meal will cost you quite a bit but its definitely a place to try at least once (and maybe for a light meal + drinks)!",0.9991,0.729,0.242,0.029,0.6259214420231369

Our server spoke softly and with an accent, and I didn't catch 25% of what he said to us, but just nodded instead of making an issue of it.  But, the food was really great.

The little waiting area you walk into is excellent. A rock garden makes the place feel calm and cool. You immediately see the large bar that is set at an angle with little zig zags allowing for a nice seat for two if you like. We were taken to our dining spot and this leads to one of my first problems with Spring. The communal dining is a little too close in my opinion. My wife and I were sat just a couple of feet away from a group of four. It was hard to feel like our conversation was between us and that the group's was theirs. Our server was excellent. Very informative on the menu, not afraid to make suggestions, and happy to chat. We both started with cocktails. My wife had The Kingston which had a cinnamon flavor to it. I enjoyed the Sazerac which is a whisky drink with a hint of absinthe. Both were outstanding. We were provided an amuse bouche which was a potato leek soup that also had peanuts in it. Very excellent and I would've happily eaten a whole bowl's worth. The bread and white bean puree that was provided is the other negative in my book. The large cracker is too large and heavy for my taste and the puree had little flavor too. We then had the Foie Gras Gyozas which were good but not amazing. I'm glad I had them but wouldn't order them again. My wife ordered the scallops with ox tail which were outstanding. I had the barramundi (a white fish) which was cooked perfectly and the gnocchi it came with was great.

We passed by the restaurant several times because I honestly didn't think it was a restaurant but a spa. Once inside the decor is beautiful and the zen garden gives it that feng shui feel. The lemongrass coconut with prawn soup was awesome! We also order the tuna rolls which was very fresh. For an entree my friend had the sea bass which she said melted in her mouth and I had the steak. I felt that the steak was not as tender as I would have liked it but I still thought it was great. The staff was so friendly and made sure our needs were constantly met. I really cant wait to go back for the atmosphere alone is worth it,0.9929,0.718,0.256,0.026,0.5592903828197946
2010-02-04,1.0,"Went to Spring tonight after reading the many good Yelp reviews of this place.  The oysters were good, however everything else was WAY OVERPRICED and not great. At all.  Here's the rundown. Yellowtail roll: I think it was like over twelve bucks for this sushi roll that I'd have maybe paid $5 for...tasty, but nothing to write home about. White bean puree: it came with the bread, tasted out of place -they could have kept that. Was that bread from Trader Joe's? really? Skatewing: The skatewing was pan fried nicely...but they serve it on some ""buttery grease stuff"" with apples and sunflower seeds. FAIL. Bouillabaisse: Tasted like it was microwaved from frozen, Olive garden wouldn't have served that. :-( Foie gras: it was foie gras wrapped in potsticker dough, what a waste...all grease, no sweetness or richness to speak of. After all this we decided against dessert after seeing ""curried chocolate"" on the menu. There is nothing wrong at all with spending an arm and a leg for good food and service, this place is not horrible, but try not to go anyway.

I had a groupon that needed to be used so we went on a Sunday night with reservation through opentable to get 1000 pts. You can skip this place!  The food was bland and boring and over priced.  When our waitress came by to ask how our entrees were and I started to say that mine was disappointing she had already moved on the the next table.  Very inattentive for the place not being that busy.  The only things that were good were the cocktails (over priced at 12.50 each but really good), the surprise bite from the chef, the pork belly and a surprise hot chocolate taste (about a thimble full).  Everything else we ordered was awful including the scallops that they are known for.  If you are looking for a place to go for an expensive romantic dinner go somewhere else! I have no problem spending a lot of money on good food, but this place just made me feel ripped off when I left even with my groupon!",0.7196,0.831,0.099,0.07,0.5938596491228069

I loved the seafood-centric menu ... great for someone like my wife who is a pescatarian and is used to only having 2 or 3 choices ... not the case at Spring! I won't bother saying what we had to eat or making any recommendations because our conclusion was that we would like to try everything on the menu ... but suffice to say that I'll have a hard time NOT ordering the same thing the next time because it was so delicious. As far as atmosphere, service, and over-all experience go, we were completely satisfied.  We were initially seated at a table in a high-traffic area near the kitchen / buss tub area and when I asked to be moved somewhere more quiet, we were immediately given a corner table in the quieter and cozier front room ... no attitude at all ... which was a pleasant surprise.  Also, the chef was sending out little sampling flights all night and they were fantastic and really added to the experience.  Our server was very warm, very accommodating, and very knowledgeable about the menu, and the front of house staff were attentive and helpful as well.

Oyster was fantastically fresh but extra treatment didn't wow. Tartare of Prime Beef: 'pho spice'/lime & palm sugar dressing/crispy rice. Crispy rice was really a thin cracker. The tartare alone was delicious, add the pho spice & dressing, WOW. Foie Gras Gyoza: charred tataki of prime New York strip/smoked apple. Not as good as we had hoped but hey how bad can foie gras be?!! Crispy Pork Belly: Chinese steamed buns/ pickled cucumber/ Thai basil & cilantro.

Incredible soup but got this nagging feeling I get this (sans dumpling) at my local Thai joint for 1/5 of the price. Malted Sweet Potato Soup w/roasted pork shoulder/potato & apple fritter. The ehh item of the night. Where was the roasted pork shoulder? Fritter tasted a bit burnt. Australian Barramundi: Korean spiced potato gnocchi/ Brussel sprouts/ almond/ grilled scallion. Spring dehydrates kimchi then pulverizes it and uses as a spice, really couldn't taste it unless sampled gnocchi separately, but didn't matter as the dish was a terrific finish to our evening. Our lead waiter was warm & very informed. Serving staff was not knowledgeable and had no presentation skills, i.e. ""here is the fish"" (you think????).

2010-01-16,5.0,"Realizing our Groupon was getting ready to expire next month, my wife and I decided to go check out Spring during the middle of the week.  We trekked out through the snow and slush for an evening at Spring.   I have to say the journey was definitely worth the reward.  This is one the best total dining experiences my wife and I have had since our anniversary at Alinea last June.   The meal started off with an amuse of garlic foam which was unexpectedly mild and smooth.  This was followed by the arrivals of the first round of cocktails, a sazerac for myself and a Salty Seal for my wife.  The Sazerac was solid - not the best I have had in the city, but well made.  The Salty Seal was good, if not a bit strong.  For apps I ordered the pork belly with steamed Chinese dumplings, which was a rather large plate of food for an appetizer.  My wife had the yellowfin roll, which was nicely prepared, just as you would expect.   At this point I was ready for another drink.  Noticing the lack of whiskey cocktails on the menu, I asked if they did any spins on an old fashioned.  The waiter said no, but picking up on my like for the whiskey did recommend the off-the-menu Bangkoked Manhattan.  It was a devine twist on a manhattan, replacing half of the sweet vermouth with a dry vermouth they infuse with a collection of asian spices.  Mmmm...I would return just for that drink alone.     The bread arrived, which was a cracker with mustard sauce.  This was good, but not exactly what I expected in a bread.  We both tried it and liked the flavors, but would have required a few more drinks to compensate for the dryness.  The main courses quickly arrived, so we really didn't have any time to worry about this , and as such weren't really disappointed.  My wife had the boullabaisse which was chock-full of seafood goodness in a mild curry broth.  I had the Maine sea scallops which were perfectly seared and provided a nice light accompaniment to the previously mentioned pork belly. It was now time for dessert.  My wife got the house tea (prepared as loose tea steeping in a small pot) and small bites, a trio of asian american fusion, with wanton apple fritters, sweet doughnuts and a chocolate peanut butter bar.  My wife's favorite was the apple fritters, but I preferred the chocolate peanut butter bar (not a big surprise.)  I ordered the Kingston Cocktail, a mix of Barbera d'Asti, Rum, Lime, and Cinnamon Bitters.  It was a sweet, slightly fruit drink that perfectly ended the night and helped steel me from the cold we were about to embark back out into. We definitely plan on returning to Spring.  This was quite a delight.  Every dish was a hit for us (save the cracker) and we would gladly pay more (sans Groupon) for this quality experience.",0.9974,0.779,0.178,0.043,0.4404369440083726

I think my mistake was that we didn't get dessert the first time. I felt it was the dessert that really brought things together at the end. We started out with an amuse of the mushroom cream soup. Very tasty! Then we ordered the foie gras gyoza - not that spectacular. I was really looking forward to trying it since almost every other Yelper raved about it, but I didn't find it flavorful or memorable at all. The gyoza wrapper was too thick and the stuffing was a little runny and bland. Didn't hit the spot for me. I really liked the thick cracker and sesame spread and pretty much ate all the crackers while waiting for our main dishes to arrive.  My friend ordered the ahi-tuna, which was a great solid dish. Two large slices of tuna steak were topped on a bed of flat, thick pasta. Yummy. I ordered the duck. It came out medium-rare as recommended by the chef, but I found it a little too rare for me which made the meat hard to cut. The duck was okay, but whatever the duck came with was amazing. Reminded me of a fancy stuffing. For dessert we had the poached pear with gorgonzola ice cream and the three sweet bites dessert. The poached pear was really good but the ice cream takes some getting used it. It had made savory components in it which threw my taste buds off. The three sweet bites dish was amazing - and actually, we should have just shared that one. It came with two bite-sized versions of each treat. There was crispy apple tarte - which was very good, two ice-cream cookie sandwiches, and the best were the two pieces of caramel covered nougat treats that tasted just like snickers...only better!

It is one of those places that would probably be more for a special occasion... the decor is clean, contemporary, romantic and quiet - the food is a little bit fancier and definitely a little bit pricier. (I had a groupon for and dinner for two including a bottle of wine was still over $100, which meant the meal was about $200 with tip.) But I do think it was well worth it! We started with a tuna tartare appetizer. Very fresh and flavorful. We also got raw oysters, which, how can you go wrong? For the entree, I tried the scallops and they were delicious - the oxtail was also quite yummy! (Not the best scallops I have ever had, but still pretty darn good!) Also tried the barrimundi, which was good but not great. We also tried the brussel sprouts on the side, which were just okay. For the dessert, we had a very refreshing grapefruit sorbet! Overall, a great meal. It is the perfect place for a nice date! I also like the fact that they bring out little extras, like a tasting from the chef or a shot of cocoa.

But then the bread came, which was a large this flat cracker that was difficult to eat and not very satisfying. I'm definitely not a fan of the cracker for the bread. The drinks sounded great on paper, but lacked in flavor. The drinks with lemongrass needed more lemongrass because they were overpowered by the ginger. The tuna tartare appetizer was very flat and needed acid. Luckily I had a wedge of lime on my drink and I squeezed it on to the tartare and it made a huge difference.The scallop appetizer however was wonderful, great flavor and beautiful searing. The halibut fish was good, but not great. The gnocchi that came with were flavorful but overall the dish was composed of such muted colors that it could have used bright garnish or vegetable. The filet and potato pancake were good, but again very minimalistic.Overall, it was a mixed bag, just like the amuse, bread, and drinks.

I had it once before at their Alchemy happy hour they did for a while and was torn whether or not to order it. When I didn't, the waiter was nice enough to bring us a smaller portion for each of us on the house. Definitely an extra star for that! For our entrees we ended up splitting the scallop with oxtail, which is their signature dish. My boyfriend isn't a huge seafood person so would have liked to see more oxtail, but the dish was very good. Lastly we had dessert. I had enough wine at this point not to remember what we had, but I'm pretty sure it was good. They also brought out a little chocolate truffle type thing that said ""Happy Birthday"" and a little cup of hot chocolate on the house. Everything was great!  The thing I loved about this place was that they really make it a nice dining experience. They don't rush anything and make sure you are taken care of. Now I did go on a slow Tuesday night so perhaps this is different on a crowded night, but I am definitely going to test it out another time.

Yes, it makes me sing. This place is THAT good.  Upon entering the restaurant, the decor makes absolutely no mark on me. It's almost like Le Bernadin in NY...simple, straight lines, no flair, no fun. Almost boring...but maybe they do that so their food will stand out even more? Because after the food was placed in front on me, the background just faded away. Our group of 5 decided to go all out, so we tried a bunch of delicious things. I love amusing my bouche, so their lil cup of yumminess before we got down and dirty was great.  Appetizers: - Foie Gras Gyoza: o.m.g. superb. - Crispy Pork Belly: delish! - Tuna Tartare: tasty, but nothing you can't get elsewhere - Tuna Sashimi: they gave for free! how could I NOT like it? - Kusshi Oyster: friends had it and said it was good. not amazing tho Soup: - Lemongrass & Coconut: very good and had some small dumplings in it Sides: -Scallion & peekytoe crab pancakes: pretty good Entrees: - Seared Maine Sea Scallops: da BOMB. i love scallops and these were perfectly seasoned and perfectly cooked - not rubbery at all! - Duck Breast: a disappointment. Ordered medium rare (as it should be) but it was dry and  not the greatest. - Halibut: enjoyed by a friend w/ no complaints - NY Skirt steak: also enjoyed by a friend w/ no complaints Desserts: I can't find the dessert menu, so I don't remember exactly what we had. We had 3 or 4 of them.  - The chocolate stuff was good. - The pumpkin something or other was just ok. - Their ice cream was tasty (different flavors that came w/ different desserts, but all great) - They ended it with a rosemary chocolate amuse bouche. Not sure I liked it very much - made me feel like it was almost too savory with the rosemary.  Anyhow, I would say this was a 4.5 on my list, but because they put up with our obnoxiously loud group (in a normally very serene setting) I have to round it up.

We ordered apps and they so graciously split them onto two plates...which is always just so nice and unexpected. First course was the steak tartare...delicious. Second course was the charred ahi tuna nicoise...mouthwatering. Third course was the Apple, walnut truffle soup...yummilicious. Forth course, I got the barramundi with gnocchi, bacon and pear and my boyfriend got the scallops.  The flavors of both were perfect. Fifth course was the flourless chocolate cake...decadent! We also paired up our food with a bottle of delicious red wine that was recommened by our server.  He also gave us complimentary glasses of dessert wine....LOVE the moscato!

To make dinner even greater, the server kept bringing our table (as well as the others) samples of delicious soups, crackers with dip, and hot chocolate after our meal.  And these were not just ordinary samples but rather bursting with exciting flavors and again brought out with the most creative presentation.

It's an old Russian bath house and they did a great job of preserving the old tiles and brass and keeping the place clean, bright, and still very romantic but could have been a little dimmer. Music was pretty bad but you tune it out after a while.  We had a short wait at the bar and the bartender was great, offering up wine by the glass. Side note, the hostess staff do a great job of keeping you updated on your table.  The menu is very Asian and fresh seafood influenced. Had a foie gras gyoza appetizer that was so tasty. it came with a charred NY strip tataki and was prefect bites.  I then moved on to the lemongrass and coconut soup which was so fresh and light and full of flavor. You really do taste everything which most soups you don't. The GF had a simple salad with a bit too much fennel and the miso dressing was a bit sweet.  For the main course I let the waiter talk me into the Barramundi that's served with a parm gnocchi and a touch of curry broth...AWESOME. the fish was so tasty, light, and everything really complimented each other. I give props to the waiter for knowing his shit. Great call. The lady ordered sea scallops that were equally great, cooked perfect, nice sear on top.  Some of the best scallops I've ever had. The beauty of this place is each stage of the meal gets progressively better and you find yourself saying how good everything is.   Great service, great food.  If you are up for dropping some bucks on an incredible meal you can't go wrong.   I judge a place more on how each stage is as opposed to one great dish and this place gets it right.",0.9985,0.722,0.254,0.023,0.5670386904761905

What was more surprising is that the place was dead. The front bar area was deserted, and only a few of the tables around us in the dining room were in use.  It was the service and food that really disappointed us. My girlfriend ordered a glass of sparkling wine and after a few minutes of drinking it, a bug flew into her glass. We apologized to our waiter and showed him, so he took it away. With the high ratings this place gets, we expected them to bring a new full glass. Instead, our waiter came back with the same glass--without the bug--that had been topped off with a little bit more wine. You could see the lip marks where my girlfriend had been drinking out of it a few minutes ago.  We tried to forget about that incident and move ahead with our meals, but the entrees were nothing impressive. We should have just cancelled our orders and left.

You can expect really really tasty, interesting flavors with Asian influences on small portion plates. Minimal but sleek atmosphere. Great service. All around solid. I have to say as far as fancy dinners go, it wasn't quite as impressive as say , my experience at MK, which is a little pricier I believe. But the food was very good. I'd have to say the standouts were the cococut soup and the desserts, of which I tried 3. The mint ice cream tasted like actual fresh mint. Nothing like mint ice cream you could buy in the store. And the corn fritter dessert was fun in an classy county fair type way. The appetizers we had, the pork belly and scallops, were really good, but really just barely a tasting. The most unexciting part was actually the entree. I had the duck and sweet potato. It was good. But honestly. I could have just eaten the soups and been happy. The entree is where I felt this could have been a 5 star place easily. The atmosphere is ok I think. Some people really love it. I didn't think it was anything special. Just simple and tasteful.

You're not going to order any starters?"" When we said no he would not stop pushing us.  He then told us that the portion sizes for entrees were really small, the wait for food was at least 30 minutes (we didn't even wait that long), etc. etc.  We still said no thank you, that would be all.  He then remarks, ""I've never had a table order just entrees before.""  I'm a waitress, and I'm sorry but not ordering appetizers is completely normal and perfectly acceptable. How desperate.  You can only imagine his reaction when we skipped dessert.  We dared ask him to take our photo and he made it very clear he was not happy to, despite how pleasant we were towards him.  My mother used a groupon and accidentally tipped twenty percent off of the discounted amount.  This was when he got angry and asked her if everything was okay.  Immediately after he left she realized her mistake and grabbed him back so she could fix her error.  She explained to him her error and that she would like to fix it.  He made some really snutty and rude remark even though she was offering him more money for his tacky service.  I'm sorry, but that is just unacceptable service.  You should walk away from a restaurant feeling good, which Spring failed to do.",-0.9308,0.713,0.129,0.158,0.6050818452380953

Having just gotten back from visiting the Tokyo fish market, I was craving seafood in the worst way.  (Apparently I didn't get enough fish in Japan, but whatever.)  I was hoping that Spring would take care of this little problem for me and oh man, did it ever.  We started off with a bang by ordering the seared tuna steak (heavenly I tell ya, heavenly) and the lemongrass and coconut soup.  The tuna steak melted in your mouth and I wanted about 3X more than we got, but I had to save room for the deliciousness that was to ensue.  The soup had the essence of Tom Kha, (which is quite possibly my favorite savory dish in the whole world) but it was tweaked to have a distinctively different flavor.  We followed this up with the crispy pork belly which was done perfectly.  Completely a traditional Chicago dish that was prepared masterfully and I would highly recommend ordering it if you visit this eatery.  After that we got the Maine sea scallops and the Alaskan halibut which were both indescribably wonderful.  The scallops were seared so that they had a tender center and a slight crunch on the edges which was amazing.  The halibut, oh man...  I've never had halibut this incredible.  For dessert, we got the corn cakes and the almond butter cake.  Both were unique and perfect and we loved them.  The almond cake is served with fruit sorbet and chilled sweet cream which, when mixed together, creates an awesome flavor explosion.

I was hungry, my husband wasn't, so we decided to sit at the bar at Spring last Saturday for drinks and appetizers. Our bartender was fabulous--(she had long brown curly hair). I ordered champagne, my husband drank beer.....and we nibbled on appetizers to get a flavor of the restaurant. I ordered everything, and my husband just taste tested each as they came out. I got the Coromandel Oysters (NZ)....they were fine, but at $3 each, I wanted them to be more unique tasting (I should clarify that the sauce be more unique--like maybe a cool sake cucumber sauce).  I can easily eat 2 dozen gulf oysters (being from Louisiana) for $10 total if I want boring. We then had the Tuna Tartare...all of the ingredients sounded really interesting....but again it wasn't. It was actually fairly bland, and moreover, didn't taste as fresh as I would have expected coming from a Shawn McClain establishment (like Custom House or Green Zebra). I actually said to my husband that the Tuna Tartare I had last week at the Cedar Hotel (you know, the old Melvin B's) was better than Spring's. Really? A bar on Rush street with better Tartare than Spring---huh? Ok, so I gave it 3 stars because the other 3 apps made up for it. The Foie Gras Gyoza's were my favorite... exciting, unique and tasty. The Crispy Pork Belly with (chinese steamed buns) was fabulous--at least the belly. The buns again were really bland....maybe a little ""somethin, somethin"" to kick it up a notch, like sake or vinegar or some chili sauce to give those buns a kick. And lastly, the Lemon grass and Coconut Soup was terrific. So, 5 stars for our service! 3 1/2 stars for our food. 3 stars for the atmosphere. Again, to go with the theme of some of a couple of our appetizers, the atmosphere to me was a little bland, a little boring, kind of like a fancy Ikea with a darker stain on the wood...not to mention a little un-nerving to find out it was a former bath-house in the middle of eating my oysters. Something about eating in a place where dirty guys bathed themselves a century ago is not a turn on to my taste buds--but that's just my silly opinion.

I had the thai lemongrass soup with prawn dumplings, and even my husband (who hates prawns) thought it was delicious. My husband had a chilled corn soup with avocado and crab-again, delicious. He ordered the strip steak entree, and I told him that was a bad idea given that we were in a seafood restaurant. I was so wrong. The peach and mustard seed accent was outstanding, and the meat was fabulous. I ordered the sea scallops over the braised oxtail and mushrooms. The scallops melted in my mouth, although I found the meat a bit heavy. Portions were perfectly sized--I was too stuffed for dessert (must go back for those). Americans are too used to enormous portions--this was the perfect amount of food. We had a groupon and I am sorry that I didnt buy more than one.

2009-09-09,3.0,"Spring was really good! We went to celebrate my husband's birthday and utilize a Groupon purchase. We noticed that 3 tables around us had their Groupons sitting out too, which made me smile. Ambience: I love that Spring is in this old bathhouse. The interior is very clean and modern, but still feels very soft and organic. Service: The best service. Everyone there is just so goshdarn NICE. Our server was so knowledgeable about all the menu items and very engaging in conversation, acknowledging my husband's birthday , suggesting menu items for us, and sending out dessert at the end of the night.  Food: Delicious, seasonal and fresh. I started with a yummy cocktail (The Aviation - very prohibition-era and delish). We had the pork belly and octopus appetizers. The octopus was fresh but the pork belly was amazing. You have to get this! They also brought out an amuse of their potato soup - mmmmm. For our entrees, I had the skatewing, which was just very lightly dusted in rice flour, so it didn't taste very heavy. It was a little salty, but it balanced so nicely with the crab salad and grilled watermelon it served with. My husband's entree won out though -- he had the special, which was a sturgeon served with some little caviar and I can't remember everything else, but it was AWESOME. We also shared the side of crab + scallion pancakes, which were just okay, and not really necessary. After dinner, they brought us a little drinking chocolate & some homemade almond nougat, both really good. We split the tasting of ice creams for dessert (meh).

2009-09-04,3.0,"Spring is a nice-looking restaurant with OK-food. It puts up a nice front, but falls short of the fine-dining experience it advertises. We came with a Groupon, so we saved a lot of money, but I couldn't imagine shelling out top dollar for this place. The restaurant is elegant and modern, a nice-Asian fusion look. But I don't think atmosphere is as important as service and food, both of which were lacking.  We sat down and had to wait about 10 minutes for someone to offer us a drink. I had a question about one, server goes to ask, and we wait another 10 minutes. Finally a different server takes our drink order (honestly we couldn't even spot ours on the floor). Btw, I thought every server knew the best way to get a good tip was to make sure your guests are liquored-up! Apparently our server didn't connect these dots, so we were drink-less (and peeved) for about 25 minutes. Food was high quality but very salty (what a waste!). I had the scallops appetizer (friend had the octopus) and we both had the same reaction: good, but salty. Same goes for the entrees: Barramundi was good, but the sauce served with is was, again, overly-salty. However, the dessert was a sweet spot: almond-butter cake served with mascarpone and cherry sorbet. Very delicious.  Great service may have made up for the underwhelming food, but instead we were left disappointed. I will say that the other servers seemed delightful -- we must have drawn the short straw.

I get that people in restaurant service are busy, there are a lot of details to get spot on, and quite a few moving parts and people that need to be aligned to get it right. That said, I was sorely disappointed by the service at Spring and, as much as I wish it didn't, the lack of it took a chunk out of my otherwise nice experience. Or server, though knowledgeable about the menu details when asked, give the distinct impression that the table we were occupying better be turned over as soon as freakin' possible. She was consistently half-turned away from out table or looking over my shoulder at another of her tables. The boyfriend and I both ordered martinis to kick things off and they were delicious enough that I wanted to savor them before moving on to the rest of the meal. Too bad. We got our oyster appetizer (amazing, by the way) two seconds after our cocktails arrived. Not a huge deal, since martini's and oysters are about as wonderful a pairing as one can have, but it would have been nice to let my drink give me its love on its own a little bit. The true foul was when our entree arrived 90 seconds after our appetizers were cleared, when I still had half a glass of gin in front of me. That's all sorts of wrong. First, I like my martinis and I want to enjoy it in all its glory, letting the gin make its way to my brain. Second, gin and halibut don't particularly mix. Third, it takes away from the wine that I was planning on enjoying, which, in this case, I never got around to. We ordered dessert (in case you lost count, that means we had three courses) and no, joke, we were out of there in 50 minutes. At a place where the entrees are $35, the timing of courses should be a true consideration. I shouldn't have to be the judge of when to put my entree order in; that's why the server gets a tip. In this case, not a huge one. If I try to separate the food from the rest of the shenanigans, it was really quite good. The buttermilk dumplings I had with the halibut were incredible and the panna cotta dessert was the best panna cotta I've ever had.

For an appetizer, we shared the Foie Gras Gyoza, topped with tataki of steak, shaved onions & cherry.  My personal thought was that the foie gras filling was a little bland, the steak did nothing to add depth to the gyoza like our server said it would and I think a little more cherry would add a nice punch of flavor to the gyoza overall.   For entrees, I had the scallops with ox tail & mushroom.  This was a very good surf & turf dish.  Very well done, I liked it a lot.  It had a good balance of sweet & savory.  My friend had the halibut entree.  Overall, the entree was good but the fish was definitely overcooked.   For dessert, we shared a nectarine sorbet served in a large bowl where green tea was added table-side.  The mixture of the sorbet, green tea, and fresh blueberries was delicious, lots of bright flavors going on, this dessert best describes the nameplate.

It was especially bad from my angled booth seat that had me staring at my boyfriend's head centered between 2 awful collages mounted on a diarrhea-mauve colored wall. Together we had the Coconut & Lemongrass soup and the Sashimi Yellowtail to start. Soup was okay. Yellowtail was room temp and would have been better chilled. Also ordered the Foie Gras Gyoza. Definitely my favorite thing. My bf had the NY strip. Not special. If you want steak, spend $10 less and go to Tango Sur for a meat&potatoes heaven. I had the Alaskan Halibut and was not motivated to finish it. All and all, if I had made any of that for dinner at home I would have patted myself on the back. But for fine dining, educated cooking? Bleh. I thought they might have an awesome pastry chef or something and ordered the Malt Chocolate Bar. It was a lot like a desert you buy in a plastic clam-shell container at Dominick's or something. With tip (we did like our server) and 2 glasses of wine, our bill was $200.  The worst part?

The cold plate we ordered, yellow tail sashimi, was missing a zing... it was basically just raw fish on a plate, which don't get me wrong, i'm cool with, but it needed some cider vinegar or sooomething.  The pork belly and dumplings were seriously good, and again seriously interesting, and had an excellent presentation.   We shared an entree, the artichoke ravioli, which was OK... the artichoke stuff in the middle sort of reminded me of kindergarten paste, but it was light and pretty tasty, save for the not-so-becoming texture.  So you say Lindsay... this all seems pretty positive! Why take away a star? Well, as a lady who likes her wine, i was very upset to find that there wasn't a REASONABLE bottle of wine on the menu to order.  I believe the cheapest bottle of white was $37, and i'm sorry... give me a a $25 bottle of wine to suck down with my dinner, when i'm already paying a good amount for the food.  We ended up ordering $12 glasses of sauvignon blanc... so yeah, even the glasses weren't cheap.

We had a vegetarian in our group so we chose the place because they seemed to have plenty of options for her, based on the online menu. When we got there, we realized that they had taken off all of the vegetarian appetizers off of the menu. We had planned on splitting a couple of appetizers but we didn't want to get things that she couldn't eat, so we didn't bother. Normally, this wouldn't have been a huge deal, but we were let down when the entrees came out and we realized that they were the size of small appetizers. I would expect a restaurant with a tasting menu to portion their food like this, but since Spring does not have a tasting menu, I didn't think that I would still hungry after eating my entrée. The scallops, the most expensive item on the menu ($30), were simply three medium-sized seared scallops over a small bed of mushrooms. It was embarrassingly small for the price. I got the Alaskan Halibut, which was served over a few gnocchi with an onion broth poured over the top. The broth was delicious tasting, but it was lukewarm. The halibut was over-cooked and nothing about how the dish was put together was particularly inventive. The vegetarian ordered the scallion and crab pancakes (she will eat some seafood) but didn't like them. I gave it a try, figuring that she was just a picky eater, and the flavor wasn't bad but the texture was off. They were almost gummy tasting. Long story short: the food isn't good enough to justify the incredibly small portions at such high prices.   Aside from the food, the service was spotty. Our waitress would disappear for long periods of time, leaving the non-english speaking bus boy to handle everything.   We split a chocolate mousse for dessert, which was good but not enough to save the rest of the meal. To top things off, the waitress came over and asked if we would need a cab. We said that we would when we finished. As soon as we got our glasses of port, the waitress came over again to say that our cab was waiting out front. I guess they wanted us to leave? Ouch.",-0.1408,0.882,0.056,0.062,0.5330629041740153

Our server was very kind and attentive, and gave wonderful advice about the menu , drinks, and wine. We started off with the lemongrass and coconut soup which was sweet and rich, with the tiniest hint of heat. Delicious!! For our entrees we split a gnocchi with mushroom sauce dish and the black cod. I usually avoid gnocchi, as most places cannot cook it correctly, and its terribly inedible. But not at Spring!! It was just perfect, with a tasty brown gravy.  The cod was very flavorful with a terrific sake glaze. And dessert....heaven.  The richest chocolate chocolate and more chocolate.

We were kindly asked to have a drink at the bar.  We were appalled by the service at the bar. We were ignored for a good 20min before the bartender finally found the time to take our order. My partner's beer arrived first, but I had to wait 10 more min for my prosecco. Unprofessional. Unacceptable. Things got a lot better once we were in the dining room. My seared tuna sashimi was sublime. My partner's eel maki was very mediocre: mushy bland rice, and the eel has a weird caramel aftertaste.  For entree, my partner's braised short rib was much more successful than my branzino. My fish was overcooked and over salted. I had a bite of the short rib and wow was it delectable. As a hospitable gesture, they offered a glass of red to accompany ribs. Thank you! Our side of scallion pancake was a little gross: it was too fluffy and drizzled with an overly sweet hot sauce.  Our bill was $180 after the said dishes, a really nice bottle of white, a forgettable chocolate dessert, and a 25% tip.  Aside from the unfriendly service at the bar, we also really disliked the decor. The ceiling was very low and the layout was a little awkward (there is a row of tables zigzagging in the middle of the dining room).

Incredible the burst of flavor in that tiny serving. 2- Oysters (3) on a half-shell with something mildly spicy. Yum. 3- Tuna tartar with some fried crispy thing. About two tbs. and I could have had a whole bowl of it. So fresh, dressed perfectly. 4- This looked like a tiny pork burger in appearance, it had two buns, fried pork that was Thai-spiced and spicy (but perfect heat). Delicious. 5- I can't remember if it was an Artic Char, but it was somehow shredded to look like a comb. This was placed on top of some tomato mixture with nuts. [Note- each dish presented the diner with a whole new flavor to the palate]. 6- A bowl of Ramen noodles, with some Asian dressing/broth, boneless short ribs that fell apart, and a quail fried egg on top. Beautiful. Scott said to mix it all up and he was right. At this moment, I was actually close to being stuffed.  7- Square fried donuts with cream, huckleberries and coconut ice cream.

2008-12-15,5.0,"I have to admit I have been wanting to try this place for quite some time. One of my sisters and her husband came here and have been raving about what a wonderful time they had. This was like 4 years ago. Just ask them about Spring and their faces light up, their eyes become distant and a smile came over their faces as they recall that night. Well, they are in LA now and far away from this place... plus the 10 below wind chill. Not that I am bitter about that...no.. not at all...I'm too cold for that... I came here last Friday with a friend for a little get together dinner, catch up conversation and to have their ""Best of"" tasting menu. $45 for 4 courses, quite a bargain considering this was a wonderful time, great service and well some memorable food in a beautiful environment.  Walking in, I was the first to arrive, I decided to sit at the bar, perhaps start with a glass of bubbly, as I pondered over the drink list and the wine list, I spied a glass of bubbles I was willing to savor the flavor with... when my friend arrived and we made our way to our table. We decided that a bottle of red not white would be appropriate since Hades seemed to be freezing along with the rest of Chicago. Our server was quiet, friendly but reserved. Allowing us to be the focus of the night.  We started off with an amuse bouche of a savory sponge cake, shallots, carrots and wasbi creme fraiche. Lovely, light and delicate and perfect start to the night. Second course was a tuna nicoise salad. A simple seared tuna with micro greens, sardines, grape tomatoes, fingerling potatoes, simple dressings and half of a quail egg soft boiled. Simple, briny with the sardines, but a solid progression from the amuse. Then to a delicious and understated Tom Khai soup. Slightly spicy and rich coconut broth, shitake mushrooms and rice noodles. My friend wanted to bathe and drink it all day, I don't know if I could bathe in it, but have it all day... yes... I could do that. Then the main course was a seared scallops with braised oxtail, sauteed broccolini and shitaki mushrooms. The scallops were perfectly cooked, the best I have ever had. The sweetness of the broccolini and the oxtail just paired so well with scallops, my only regret that there wasn't more. Oh wait.. there still was dessert. A chocolate cake, surrounded in vanilla ice cream, covered in white chocolate shell, with peppermint bark on top, melted chocolate peppermint bark on the side and mint foam on top. I have to say the only thing that annoyed me about this dish was the foam. It was mint, but spearmint, (the true flavor of mint plant), but a. it just wasn't playing well with the peppermint, b. I hate spearmint, so it was about the only thing about the dish I wasn't crazy about. In fact it was about the only part of the entire night I wasn't crazy about.  I was crazy about the rest of the night. The place is trendy, but relaxed. It doesn't make you feel like you are in a stuffy, too cool place, but rather a very hip home. They really take care of you here. The service was wonderful, the decor is great, the meal phenomenal and the night just great. A couple of things also to note. At the end of the meal and night, you get an amazing small shot of hot chocolate and warm towel to wipe your hands clean and to warm your nourished self. Savor that hot chocolate, it is delicious. I think the tasting menu is a great introduction to Spring. You get a taste of what they have to offer with out feeling like you are spending boatload of money. Yet after a taste, I can't wait to come back for another night, another meal and what I am sure will be a more wonderful memories.",0.9993,0.757,0.219,0.024,0.6153421278421278
2008-11-26,4.0,"Spring stands just on the cusp of five stars.  I don't believe in giving the ""best of the best"" rating after one visit; but if I ever return and have another near-perfect experience like I did three days ago, they definitely will get the bump. Service was high quality:  not stellar, but exactly what you would expect at this price level.  Atmosphere was cool--not really cozy but not quite slick or ""hip"" either.  I think that they were going for something like ""urban zen.""  I liked the decor and the lighting.  Two detractions:  1.  It was COLD in there; and 2.  The dining room was nearly empty at 7 pm on a Sunday.  We appreciated the quiet, but would have liked a bit more vivacity in the room. The food is clearly the star of the show at Spring.  Culinarily speaking, this was one of the best meals of my life.  First, an amuse bouche of roasted brussels sprout with pistachio chutney and a creamy sunchoke puree:  a delicious little morsel which built anticipation for the gustatory wonders to come. I ordered both the lobster wonton and the hot and sour mushroom soup for starters.  The wonton came first and elicited several moans and sighs of intense pleasure (read into that whatever you like).  After I had devoured the wonton itself, I actually used some of the table bread to sop up the heavenly basil broth with which it had been served.   Next came the hot and sour mushroom soup with pork belly and tiny slices of quail's eggs.  Amazing, and ALMOST as good as the wonton.  We're talking about the difference between an A and an A+ here.  Again, I used the bread to empty the bowl.  Uncouth, I know, but I couldn't allow a micron of this stuff go into the dishwasher. My main was the black cod with crab, shallots, and a sesame/black-bean glaze, served with scallion pancakes.  It was just as good as the rest of the food, and a more generous portion of fish than I expected.    I also tried my girlfriend's prawn dish, and although I don't recall the accoutrements, the prawn itself was so perfectly cooked (it's easy to miscook shrimp) and wonderfully flavored, that I had second thoughts about my own dish.   We had tentative plans to dessert elsewhere, and after three perfect courses, I didn't want to press my luck.  Next time, I'll get one of their desserts or fancy cocktails.  I did order an oolong tea to draw out the denouement of the meal.  I felt that the tea-to-water ratio was too little, but that's a minor quibble after a meal of such sterling quality.  They brought us each a little cup of minty hot chocolate which finished off the meal perfectly. I STRENUOUSLY recommend Spring to anyone looking for a classy, modern, but unpretentious experience.  The food is outstanding--don't wait for a special occasion.",0.9989,0.759,0.215,0.026,0.5012457482993197

2008-11-24,4.0,"I've passed by Spring many times while socializing in this part of Wicker Park, but have never really thought of trying out this establishment. As noted by other Yelpers this is a reconverted turkish bath house and the folks at Spring have created a open bar and eating area that allows for a roomy dining experience.  Muted earth tones and sleak lines makes this have a look and feel sort of the 30s speakeasy rather than a comtemporary eatery. Staff is nice........young.......professional.......and some very tattooed.   The food is fusion based with the menu being fish heavy at this visit.  Staying with the seafood theme, we began with oysters topped heavily with caviar and were good, but considering they were from British Columbia, I expected them to be a bit more briney, but were not.  tuna tartar is a definitely must try here. Having had fish for dinner the night prior had me looking at the only two meat dishes with my choice being the duck.  It was cooked perfect and very tasty.  Wild mushrooms were a great side dish.   Dessert was an ice cream trio and were complex in flavor and a great closing to an overall great meal.  Wine selection was very good as was pricing.  A pinot noir was selected and a nice choice for the meal though we did have to ask to have our glassed refilled once which is why this does not get 5 stars.  At these prices I expect service to be perfect....just like the food.

2008-11-23,5.0,"Spring has been on my list ""to try"" for a long time and finally, last night I had the chance to experience it.  Located in what used to be an old bathhouse (you can still see the original subway tile on the walls), it is a beautiful space with a bar in the first room and then the dining area in the second. Soft wood tones give this place a feeling of tranquility from the moment you walk in the door.  We were seated promptly and began to look over the menu. I knew that this place did ""fusion"" food- you know, that interesting pairing of things that sound like they shouldn't go together and yet when you taste them you wonder why you didn't think of it. There were so many choices that it was hard to choose, but since neither of us had been here before- we wanted to taste a range of the menu so we ordered things to share.  First up- an ""amuse bouche"" from the chef which I still don't know what it was but it was some type of fish topped with a creamy sauce. I knew we were off to a good start.  We began with the oysters that were topped with caviar and mignonette sauce. Very good. But the real winner was the ahi tuna tartar which was so good I wanted to order another one as my entree. But I didn't.  Now on to the entrees. I ordered the scallops with braised oxtail and wild mushrooms (sounds odd but it was amazing) and my friend had the duck which was equally as good. We split a side of wild mushrooms to go with the entrees which were prepared with herbs and shallots.  Finally, we squeezed out a smidge of room to split dessert which was a trio of ice cream- flavors that I had never tasted yet heard of, but it was a perfect way to end our dinner.  The wine list is solid with many choices and ranges of pricing. We went with a mid range Pinot Noir which they decanted for us and didn't over power our food choices. The service was attentive without being overbearing.   Dinner for two with drinks, dessert and wine came to about $100 per person which is average for this caliber of meal. So the next time you find yourself in this neighborhood looking for a great dinner- look to Spring. It's interesting combination of tastes is sure to please everyone in your group.

2008-11-23,5.0,"I will admit to being slightly turned off at the thought of a seafood restaurant, no matter how upscale, being located in a renovated bathhouse.  One look at the menu, however, and my stomach promptly overruled my inhibitions.   Also helpful in getting my lady and I in the door was Spring's genuinely good idea of having the Violet Hour's mixologist whip up a small menu of specialty cocktails, followed by hiring one of my favorite bartenders to prepare and serve them. The bar irself is ... zigzaggy, I guess, which actually makes it possible to sit with a group and not leave the people on the ends feeling isolated.  It is separated from the dining area, which is also quite smart on Spring's part, allowing for light fare and exceptional drinks with a friend in the front or a full-on fantastic dining experience with a man or woman you wish to have sex with later in the back (and believe me, if you eat here with someone and do not then immediately run home to copulate there is something wildly wrong with you). We chose to sit at the bar to better enjoy my friend's skills with booze, but went right ahead and ordered entrees after about three minutes of poring over the menu exclaiming ""Oh my god that looks amazing"" and ""I don't know what that is but I have an erection"" etc.   The scallops with braised oxtail might actually be the best thing I've ever had in my mouth, especially in a bathhouse.  The prawns were also glorious and there was some sort of black bean and sake glaze on my cod that deserved an award.  Everything was prepared perfectly and basically fell apart in my mouth.  Topping off all this amazing seafood with equally delicious cocktails (full of bizarre infused liquors and elderflower and whatever) was almost too much. Thai basil chocolate shots and garam masala chocolate squares constituted dessert and by that point I really had to leave before I gave into the ghosts of the building's past and went and fellated the chef.

2008-07-31,4.0,"We've been meaning to go to Spring for years and I can't, for the life of me, remember why we put it off.  We had a great dinner and a wonderful time. We were momentarily tempted by the Tasting Menu-- a very reasonable $65 for 5 courses.  Since there was no printed menu to accompany it, we half-hoped it was a Thyme Cafe-style Tasting, ie. pick your own from the ala carte menu.  Even more intriguing, the Tasting is a chef's surprise.  The chef will put together a 5 course tasting based on his whims, your strong preferences and any other reasonable extenuating circumstances.  Looking at the menu, however, we just couldn't turn down the opportunity to try as many different things as possible, so we created our own multi-course Tasting. First course: Cold apps.  The Hamachi sashimi-- each slice served atop a thin tile of perfectly pink watermelon and the Hamachi tartare, a special.  We hadn't intended to double up on Hamachi, but the preparations were so different, it didn't seem redundant at all. Second course:  Warm apps.  Smoked eel with pork belly and a perennial Spring appetizer, the Maine Scallop and Yukon gold potato ""ravioli"".  I'm not quite sure why this was dubbed ravioli, but it was terribly delicious and made us regret not ordering Shawn McClain's signature Maine Scallops and Oxtail entree.  I was also intrigued by the Lemongrass and Coconut Soup (highly recommended by the server), but, as comfortable as it was in the dining room, it was 90 degrees outside and I just couldn't do it. Main course.  Cod with Black Beans and Skatewing with roasted cauliflower.  I've requested a copy of the menu from Spring, because unfortunately, my detailed memory of this part of the meal was wiped clean by the very enjoyable Saumur rose  and bottle of Albariño we had with the meal.  I'll update when my memory is jogged, but in a nutshell, everything was lovely.  My skate was sauteed in the traditional manner, served atop its accompaniments.  The sauce was below the skate and rather salty on its own, however.  Once I toppled the presentation tower and swirled the components together a bit, the flavors cohered much better. Dessert: Quinoa poundcake with apricot compote and ginger ice cream.  Who knew you could make poundcake out of quinoa?  It was delicious.  We enjoyed this with the recommended wine, a late harvest Verdelho from Australia. There was Verdelho left in our glasses when the food-runner brought our tiny sake cups of ""chocolate soup"" (served without explanation along with warm towels in a bamboo box).  The chocolate and wine together was so splendid that when we gushed about it to our server, he brought us another round and explained that it was infused with tarragon-- an herb I could taste once pointed out to me, but had tasted hazelnutty with the wine. The service was excellent-- our server was affable and read us perfectly, giving us a wealth of information, suggestions and even recommendations for an after-dinner drink location nearby.   All the extra touches (the chocolate soup, the warm towels, the way the hostess went to the front door and opened it for us on our way out) went a long way toward making a nice evening out more memorable.  The space itself is lovely, though I can imagine that it might get loud if busy.

2008-06-10,4.0,"Let's make this clear: I am new to seafood.  Besides the occasional maki roll, I never touched the stuff until about a year and a half ago when I started experimenting.  I still am wary of a lot of it; I can do crab, lobster, salmon, and very mild fish.  That's abou it.   Spring has an incredibly seafood-heavy menu.  That's kind of its thing.  So, I decided to be brave and just try things. All the food was fantastic, except for the...i think red snapper? that my friend ordered, which we all decided smelled revolting and sent back.   The service was okay.  We all ordered an appetizer, a main, and a dessert, and asked the waitress to pair them with wines and she kind of looked at us like we were crazy.   Seriously, you work here, this is what you do, it isn't a ridiculous request.  Then she was kind of strange the whole night, and at the end sort of mumbled an apology and said she was having an off evening.  Huh?  Strange. The ambiance is very nice, kind of neutral colors and relaxed.  It actually made me a little sleepy.   I'd imagine this would be a great place for a date - wasn't the best pick for a bunch of friends looking to have a fun night.",0.9792,0.787,0.164,0.049,0.5458463949843261

2008-05-23,5.0,"Have been here twice for special occasions and was thoroughly impressed both times. Hubby & I brought mom here for her day last week, and we were thrilled with the experience. Hubby commented that Kirk E was probably the best server he'd ever had, and I agree--attentive and extremely knowledgeable, particularly when it comes to beverages (he and hubby, a former bartender, had a detailed discussion about Manhattans and rye whiskey). Yet he was not at all overbearing, arrogant, or pushy. We were fortunate to be seated in his section.  As for the food: Absolutely outstanding; my top choice for seafood that isn't breaded and served on newspaper with fries. The meal opened with a unique tuna roll amuse bouche. Hubby & I shared the softshell crab special starter--a pleasing blend of subtle taste and texture. Mom's lemongrass coconut soup was a substantial, heartily portioned symphony of clean flavors--shrimp paste, kaffir lime. My barramundi was spectacular, flavored with chili and roasted garlic. Spring's version of miso black cod is innovative, with black beans and a lovely fresh note of soy ringing through the dish. I'm not a fan of skatewing (hated it at Bistro Campagne), but mom's portion was quite nice and well flavored (my issue with skate is mainly textural). Dessert was a sublime conclusion. My white chocolate affogato was creamy, yet refreshing, served with tarragon oil (?) and coconut milk with a side of sugared donuts. Yummy (though donuts don't appear to be Spring's forte). Mom's roasted banana toffee cake was sumptuous, paired with a Chinese hot mustard ice cream that added an appropriate hint of mischief. The meal ended with a shot of thick, rich hot chocolate scented with orange and lavender. Atmosphere is a subdued sophistication that provides a quiet backdrop for Spring's excellent service and extraordinary food.

2008-05-21,5.0,"I think I ate the exact same thing as Rich E in the review below in my most recent visit, and enjoyed it thoroughly. I haven't had a bad dish there.  Black cod, barramundi.  I think the time I had the arctic char it was a little overcooked, but every place has an occasional miss.  I like how they'll incorporate some staples of Asian food into their dishes.  Other reviewers have said those elements are overpriced, but it's the fusion of them with the other flavors of the sauce / broth that makes it unique.   The tasting menu picks a few items from the menu and usually adds one dish that's not on the menu.  While each serving looks small, in the end, the richness of each dish leaves you practically stuffed. We stop by about once every month or two for dinner or even just dessert and cocktails.  The staff are all very friendly, and their desserts have great combinations of flavor without being over-the-top rich.  House made ice creams flavored with spices, little donuts, cute pastries. Clientele is a mix of 30-ish couples, groups of 30-40-ish women, 50-60's couples (a surprise to me too, but more because we don't see ""that type"" in Wicker Park) with more groups of 6-8 on weekends.  You can also eat at the bar if you can't get a table.",0.9722,0.837,0.127,0.036,0.498
2008-05-14,3.0,"FOOD:     The appetizers were better than entrees by a HUGE margin.  My baked unagi appetizer was DELICIOUS and came with PERFECTLY cooked scallops and then some rather negligible noodles.  The lobster soup was also yummy, though a bit too heavy for my taste.  The entrees were not so marvelous.  I had the special of the night-I can't remember now but it was some sort of grilled bass over wild mushrooms.  The fish was overly salty and grilled in a style that reminds me of street food you can buy in Asia for about fifty cents.  The wild mushrooms were pretty good.  My date had another fish dish that was over gnocchis; I didn't quite find the gnocchis to my taste and again, the fish was a bit too rich but it was better than my grilled mess.  For dessert, the squash custard was MARVELOUS.  It was unique and I'd never tasted anything like it; my apple dessert thing was yummy, but nothing extraordinary. AMBIANCE:     Really nice, gorgeous restaurant.  Full of stuffy yuppie types.  (I think my friend and I were the only people in there under the age of 30.) SERVICE:     Very good.  My water glass was always full and someone always ran over to light our candle when it went out.  I wouldn't expect anything less from a place who charges what they do. BANG FOR YOUR BUCK:     So-so.  The food was severely over-priced, but the beautiful ambiance and excellent service balanced it out. TRY:     Baked eel appetizer (perfect unagi over scallops); squash custard cake BOTTOM LINE:     Over all, I was somewhat disappointed with Spring since I had always heard such great raves about it.  It's not bad, but nothing overwhelming compared to other restaurants in its price category.",0.9966,0.72,0.227,0.053,0.725278911564626

The ambience is quiet zen, with frosted glass, warm wood, and soft lighting, creating a romantic atmosphere.  It's spacious, so patrons aren't rubbing elbows with one another, creating an area perfect for a bit of privacy during conversations. Service is top-notch.  Glasses are filled before it's empty.  Dirty plates are cleared away immediately.  Bread crumbs are swiped away with more slices to fill empty plates.  And the courses are brought out in a timely, well-paced manner. And the food!  When I say that this is one of the best seafood dishes I've had, I don't mean just seafood in Chicago.  This is definitely one of the best seafood dishes I've had in the world.  Shawn McClain knew what he was doing when he decided to open Spring.  And it makes sense that he would open a second branch in Paris, France.  Lucky for us Chicagoans, we can book a few days in advance; Spring is booked for months over in Paris! Kushi oysters were fresh, with a delicately briny flavor.  Maine sea scallops were cooked just right, not rubbery at all.  And the scallops weren't too salty, but had a clean, fresh flavor; sweet soy didn't mask the taste of the scallops.  My friend had the barramundi, which she thoroughly enjoyed. The meal totaled just under $120, including a bottle of wine, for two people.  Considering the quality of the meal, the impeccable service, and wonderful ambience, it was worth it.",0.9924,0.798,0.178,0.024,0.5808595683595683

Don't get me wrong--I'm as game for chocolate covered fois gras as the next girl (yes, I'm talking to you, Tru)--but sometimes I want my dinner to bec comtemplative and quietly fascinating rather than the adventure of a lifetime.
