2013-12-16,3.0,"We considered The Tasting Room for our wedding ceremony and reception. They would provide a wine-centric loft-style space in the West Loop neighborhood of Chicago. Their shelves of wine bottles, exposed brick walls, and unmatched furniture was sure to provide a memorable setting for our important occasion. The Tasting Room is eclectic and a wonderful venue for DIY-lovers who want independence and quirkiness in an urban setting. I enjoyed chatting on the phone with the owner and later we loved meeting with an employee who gave us a tour. They both did a phenomenal job of painting a realistic picture of what our wedding would be like. It would have open seating and there would either be a buffet dinner or stations that encourage mingling. Although there would be space for getting ready, it's small and pushed us to think about preparing somewhere else.  Our turning point was after I spoke with the chef. We had a wonderful conversation about the food and our vision for the evening. I expressed that we were open to all kinds of food but that it was crucial that it be amazing. The chef told me that he was going on vacation for a week and that he would be back in touch with me upon his return. That was the last time either one of us heard from ANYBODY at The Tasting Room. We already had an idea of the quality of their food and our wedding plans at The Tasting Room hung on this chef. We ate dinner there after our initial tour and tried many menu items. The food was good but unimpressive. Service was nice but casual. It matched the venue and we understood. Unfortunately, when it comes to our wedding, we really wanted delicious memories and we needed reliable people at the venue. The failure of following through on the promise of assembling a menu resulted in a poor impression of the service we could expect later on.",0.9758,0.821,0.131,0.048,0.5566308243727599

Cheeses and meats, while they may add up quickly, are all really phenomenal.  By the time you order a few, you end up with a huge cutting board of cheese, meat, nuts, bread, and dried fruit.  It's seriously a meal in itself.  The chocolate fondue, yep, do it.  Their dining menu changes often, fyi.

2013-01-13,3.0,"My friend and I went this place last night. Wine and appetizer was great, service, not so much. Great wine menu and if you drink and appreciate wine as much as I do, there is something on the menu to your liking. I was not disappointed with my wine flight or my glass of Bordeaux that was a perfect compliment to the taste of Paris appetizer. We sat at the bar and the bartender plopped down the menus (dark long curly hair). Never asked if we had questions or if we had been to the tasting room before. We each ordered a flight and made it known we wanted to order food. Twenty minutes later (I worked in a bar for years and honestly it was not that busy) I had to literally wave my arms in the air to get her attention, and she reluctantly put down her wine glass and came over, annoyed.  When i tried to get the woman's (who i think was the barback) attention who was drying glasses, who was literally 1 foot away from us, she acted like she was deaf.  Fearing our bartender was not going to return, and because i was starving, i quickly placed my order. The bartender never removed the menus from the bar, weird. That didn't happen until we were almost done with our food. There was a man behind the bar that came over twice, smiled and asked if we needed anything and how everything was. He also asked if we had any questions. He was friendly and professional and had the demeanor that is necessary when you work behind a bar. (Hint: If you are pleasant and helpful, you will get a nice tip) I will return because of his service and he was also why I still tipped 20%.

This was a surprise date for my husband, so he drove and I was navigator. Not sure what my problem was that night, but we couldn't find the place to save our lives. I had to call 2 times to figure out where it was. Honestly, it's not hard to find, I was just being a moron. The reason I say all this is because in reviews I read, people were complaining about how they never answer their phone and how the customer service is sub-par.  This was not the case for us. They were so helpful in the midst of me having no clue where I was in the West Loop AND they kept our reservation after being 15 minutes late which was incredibly kind.  Let's get to the experience. We walk into a cute lil bar on the bottom floor, but the hostess takes us upstairs to a super sweet lounge type room. It has exposed brick walls, leather couches and chairs, and fantastic art on the walls. There's a great view if you sit by the windows, which we did not but we still were pleased. The playlist was perfect for taking my husband on a date. It ranged from Led Zeppelin to Smashing Pumpkins, to Oasis. So fun.  There were so many fantastic looking wines, we didn't know what to choose. Our waitress was awesome at helping us hone in on a decision. I ordered the 2008 L'Ecole 41 Seven Hills Estate Syrah, Walla Walla, WA and the hubs ordered 2010 R & T 'The Loop' Cabernet Sauvignon, Paso Robles, CA. We loved them both but if you go you GOTTA get that Cabernet. SO smooth, SO good. You'll love it. We also ordered the Espana tasting plate that went well with our wines.

We walked in as a huge group, and the hostess impatiently told us the bar is all the space they have available. There were 5 open seats. A friend who'd been here before knew about additional upstairs space and inquired, but was told ""the bar is all we have"". Fine. Just as we started to order drinks, the hostess came back and told us she put together a space for us upstairs and asked if we'd like to close the tab or transfer it upstairs. Thinking it's easier with a single check, we said we'll transfer and started to walk upstairs. Lo and behold the bartender charged at us and DEMANDED that we close the tab first. We told him what the hostess said and he insisted. Then the hostess came out behind him and said yes it's better to close the tab first. Ok fine. But can we go upstairs, put down our coats and drinks, and then settle the tab? These people are acting like we are walking out without paying, when we're walking upstairs in the SAME BAR!!! I hate being yelled at, especially when it's not my fault. If the employees of an establishment can't learn to communicate effectively with each other, it's their problem, not mine!!! Anyhow, imagine our surprise when we walked upstairs and found it HALF EMPTY! We settled our downstairs bill and waited FOREVER for the rest of our drinks. No wonder every other place on restaurant row is filled to the brim on a Saturday night except this one. What a joke of a place. I'm sorry I walked in.

It has the old exposed brick thing going on and looks cozy and romantic.  For our ""festivities,"" we happened to go upstairs, which was very cool.  I noticed more couches around, and they were the good kind of big leather chairs and couches. In our section, this is what we got, and it was very comfortable. Their wine, beer, and liquour list is huge and impressive I thought. The food list is also rather good and has some great things on there. We had the grilled cheese & tomato soup, short rib croquettes, and the duck prosciutto. Overall, everything was good. Not amazing, but good.  I thought the grilled cheese & tomato soup was actually pretty sizable and there were a number of croquettes. Not a lot of duck prosciutto, but if you know anything about this, you know how expensive it actually is. So the price was fair for what we got.  I also tried a slice of the margherita flatbread, which was also pretty good.  Pair that with a small handful of beers/wines, and the entire price of $50 after tax and tip was fair. Overall, this is a nice place. The food is pretty good and the drink list is nice.

2012-08-07,1.0,"I go out to eat in Chicago an awful lot, and I rarely try the same restaurant twice. But I had been to The Tasting Room once last year, and the food was so delicious that when I was in the area, my boyfriend and I decided to stop back in.  The restaurant was entirely empty, so the host told us we could take a seat anywhere. About 20-30 minutes went by, and no one came to take our drink order. I went back up to the host and informed him that no one had been by our table, and he said he would send someone right away. Some time later, a bus boy came by to take our order, and while he was great and I appreciate that he took the initiative to serve us, it seemed a little odd since we had yet to see a waiter all night. We ordered several dishes, and a wine flight each. When our wine came out, again, the bus boy came and just set the wine down, as it's not in fact his job to present the wines. No waiter came to present or describe the wines, which is kind of the entire freaking point of going to a restaurant based upon wine tasting. When the food came out, again, no waiter came to see us. An incredibly long time passed by, and no one checked on us a single time or even brought us the check. Now at this point I probably could have dined and dashed, and maybe at THAT point someone in the restaurant would have noticed our presence. I went to the host to tell him that after two flights of wine and several rounds of food, we had yet to in fact see a waiter. He gave me a pretty half hearted apology, and eventually brought the check out. And despite my pretty visible frustration with the fact that I dropped well over $200 on dinner and was not given any form of service the entire night, he didn't really seem to care. He just kind of said sorry, didn't take anything off the check, ran my card and left it there.  I have never, ever been so disappointed by service. And for a restaurant that kind of revolves around the experience of learning about and tasting the wines, it is wholly unacceptable that this aspect of the experience is left out. If I wanted to just have wine plopped down in front of me, I would have gone to a significantly cheaper BYOB. And for a customer to complain, and the staff not act on it whatsoever is just completely inexcusable. This place has great food, but this is just no way to run an establishment.

So, when I stepped into this place I sorta expected something a bit different than what I got. Let me explain... They have the main level that has different rooms for people to hang out in. This is where you will find the bar. Then, there's the upstairs. Now, this space is odd. Layout, design, lighting, and overall feng shui is off. You can choose between leather couch seating with a coffee table perhaps to cozy up with a date. Or, if you want to just eat, taste, and view the skyline... there are cocktail tables situated by the only windows with views of Sears/Willi Tower/Hancock. Warning: the tables and the windows don't exactly line up so really only ONE person in you party can take advantage of the view. Sorta takes the fun out of it a bit. There's 2 canvas paintings, an imitation plant in another corner, an interesting 70s-type bar, and can lighting. Ok, I know, this is a wine bar so... let me move on to the wine/food... Wine flights offered here aren't bad -- 2/3 are from the same region or country though. Not sure if they change their flights from time to time. You can opt to pair their vino with their cheese flights for extra moola or choose to share one of its small plates or apps. I had the Italian flight. I know there's more to Italy... We shared the flatbread pizza and scallops. Medium-sized pizza had spinach, carmelized onion, crimini mushrooms, and sundried tomatoes.  A step above the scallops that are served on a risotto pancake. Probably the risotto was what let me down a bit.  If you don't want wine, they have other stuff you can imbibe in for sure. Outdoor patio seating might be nice one a cooler Summer or Fall day in Chicago. Just not sure when or what I'd come back for.",0.975,0.885,0.101,0.014,0.4691570881226054

After trying to finish the Chicago small-plate staple, Bacon-Wrapped Dates which, unlike other places, has almonds encased in it, I probably have overdone it by ordering more wine flights -- this ""Boutique"" creation I impulsively decided throw in was described on the menu as Truffle Tremor which got me curious since I am a fan of all things truffle but no matter how ""velvety or earthy"" it was just as described on the menu, the goat cheese wasn't the best pick for myself. This, however, is a mistake on my part as they offer 14 other choices of Boutique goodies altogether but I was too tipsy from the 2nd serving of wine (this time the 2006 Ruby Port) to pick a good selection from that lot for myself. Nevertheless, it was an enjoyable experience and I would not mind coming back with more folks to sample more of their well thought out offerings of wine flights.

Prior to our visit last night, our out of town friends, my husband and I would have given the place five stars. No question.  Since last summer, they have gone under new management and changed their menu.  We asked our waitress what happened and she explained the new manager chose to remove some of the options--we're talking wine here--that ""weren't moving"" and make the selection appeal to the general public while keeping a few fun things for the wine nerds.   We are not said wine nerds, but we do enjoy wine and recognize an excellent glass when we taste one.  The new menus are easier to read and make a quicker decision, but the fun is gone.   We had the same, extremely knowledgeable waiter the first two times we visited who took the time to recommend a flight or bottle for each person in our party--and he never steered us wrong.  I loved that I was learning about the wine, enjoying the atmosphere and eating great food. Last night, while the atmosphere was the same and the food was still excellent, our waitress was friendly, but not very helpful.  Granted with the now limited wine flight selection, we didn't need much direction.  Needless to say, we were also disappointed when our wine arrived.  It was nothing special, especially the first glass of the Iberian flight and Pinot Noir flight.

If you have the opportunity, ask to be seated upstairs. We were lucky enough to snag one of the couches and it provided a great setting for sharing food/wine and talking to each other. It almost felt like we had our own section of the upstairs. We left around 9pm and it was pretty full by then with a good crowd. I thought the service was really good. I realize that there are a lot of mixed reviews on this by other yelp-er's so I had pretty low expectations (especially when using a deal), but I was pleasantly surprised. Our waitress had a great knowledge of wine and was attentive enough without being overbearing.  The food was delicious. We started with a cheese and meat tower. The waitress had a few recommendations on the cheeses and the ones she picked were my favorite. The tower came with bread, nuts, cranberries & apples (i thought only the tasting plates did when browsing the menu). We then ordered the Shrimp & Chorizo flatbread and the short rib. The menu we had in the restaurant was different from what I saw online, but if you go, I'd recommend either. After much back and forth, neither of us could decide which was more delicious, but we both ate until we were well beyond full. I was also pleased with the portion size. For $10-15 flatbreads/entrees at a wine bar, I was expecting tapas sized portions. The flat bread was equivalent to about a small pizza and the short rib could have been a full entree (before the cheese and meat). The wine list was very extensive and ranged from about $35 a bottle up to $700 or something absurd that I would only laugh at.  Somehow even with the deal, we ended up spending much more than anticipated, but it's a wine bar and I guess that is to be expected.

Thank goodness I didn't come here on my own and was just here for a holiday party because then I would've been pissed at having come out of my way and paid for such awfulness.  Where do I begin--the clueless hostess downstairs who didn't hear us and still asked ""for how many?"" after we asked where the private holiday party was located. Luckily her not so dumb sidekick heard us and led us upstairs, those stairs are narrow and can be treacherous if inebriated. The downstairs area was definitely not bumping on a Thursday night, which just kind of looked sad. Our holiday party was sectioned off to use one side of the upstairs space, the side with no windows and a bunch of ugly couches lined along the walls.  The party was supposed to include 3 hours of open bar and passed appetizers for I believe $60 pp. I had no problem with the open bar, but the appetizers were pathetic, non-existent and downright unacceptable! If you're charging that much per person, you better bring me something more than freaking bruschetta!!! They were supposed to also serve flatbreads, of which I only saw two, which were devoured by people before they got a quarter of the way into the room. And then they brought some pathetic-looking ceviche-style shrimp which just looked and tasted disgusting. I got one (just ONE) piece of a lamb chop and that was the only decent thing I got all night. They did not serve enough food, enough of the good stuff, with enough frequency. I would stay away from this place for private parties, you won't get your money's worth. Don't they know that you have to feed hungry people to soak up some of the alcohol if there's open bar for three hours, otherwise they get really drunk and stupid really fast.  To top off this lovely (sarcasm) night, I had to stand out in the brutally windy, FREEZING cold on the corner of Ogden and Randolph for 10-15 minutes to hail a cab in the middle of this no man's land in the West Loop.

My husband and I came here the Monday following our wedding (I called it our ""honeymoon dinner"") to enjoy a leisurely dinner and watch our new rings sparkle in the candlelight.

A glass of cava to toast our new (legal) life together and we were off to the tasting. We enjoyed the mussels (served in two styles), the spring tasting menu, and the Spanish tasting menu. We over-ordered, as we tend to do, but enjoyed every last morsel brought to our table.  I highly recommend the Spanish tasting plate: It does everything tasting is supposed to do. Surrounds your tastebuds with a variety of flavors, textures and smells. We loved the peppers stuffed with goat cheese as well as the sliced chorizo and the Spanish olives.

We were seated upstairs on a large but somewhat worn couch that would have been fine if we were just drinking, but because we wanted to dine as well, a coffee table wasn't quite what I had in mind. There were a number of high tables and chairs in the room that gave it more of a neighborhood bar feel, rather than the intimate experience I was seeking. The Tasting Room does offer some nice flights, many of which have amusing musical names. Because we were celebrating an anniversary, we both tried the champagne flight, followed by Riesling flight for me and a glass of Burgundy for him. The wines were very good, and I will hand it to The Tasting Room for a strong selection. The food was somewhat hit or miss - my fish was rather bland. At one point I actually joked that Gorton's makes it better. I also ordered a selection of five cheeses, however, which were very good (and the portions were larger than average!). My boyfriend tried ordering three different items that were all unavailable that evening before settling on the foie gras. The restaurant gets a bit loud, and with the couch/coffee table arrangement, the waitress was struggling to hear us. That aside, she rarely checked on us and we did have to ask for items, such as another glass of wine, several times.

2011-04-17,3.0,"8.15 Saturday night. Two of us.  We were shown to a sofa in the upstairs room. It was a comfy sofa and had a huge wooden table on which they placed drinks and food. The sofa afforded us a strange view of the backs of the stools on which the majority of people were sitting at high tables. Most people had their coats hung on them, so it sort of felt as if most folks were about to leave, waiting for a train, plane or the like..  The huge table was knee high and many a passing guest came away bruised as they spilt our wines.. Super selection of wine flights named after actors and singers. The Champagne flight ($22) was Nina Simone. There were small plates and cheeses and the menu talked about the homemade meats and charcuterie. So much so, they even have a separate tasting for housemade tapas. So I ordered this..but none were available except the Fois Gras pate (which was good).  We ordered 5 cheese ($25) as well. Cheeses were good portions and came on a two-level wooden platter.  Service started attentively but lost the plot a bit as it got busier.  There was a strange arrangement with a big sofa and comfy chairs facing some plastic chairs for a party of 12, I would guess. But the party never showed so the bus boy unceremoniously stacked the plastic chairs and carried then through the room. We ordered the Fish and Chips, but the chips (fries) were black at the ends and the fish was unseasoned (no vinegar or salt offered). And then the penny dropped: the fish didn't look as if it really wanted to be there and neither did the staff really.

2011-04-11,2.0,"On Monday April 4th, I wrote and emailed this letter to the owner of The Tasting Room, to express my and the rest of the party's feelings about the manager's attitude during a party I organized on April 1st. Unfortunately I have not received an answer, not even an acknowledgment of the letter, that is why I'm publishing it here (and giving the restaurant 2 stars) ""Re: Bachelorette Dinner Party at The Tasting Room Dear Mrs. Fotopoulos, I had recently the pleasure to organize one of my best friends' bachelorette dinner party on Friday, April 1st, 2011. When faced with such a great number of restaurants in the downtown area, The Tasting Room came to mind easily, since I had experienced with pleasure great service, ambiance and style the few times I was there with my husband and one other couple. I thought to myself that this would definitely make a great spot for our group of 14 guests. In my initial conversations with Angela DeSanctis I have communicated what I envisioned for the party. I mentioned that one of the things I absolutely loved about this restaurant, and that actually was going to help in making my final decision when it came to The Tasting Room, was the skyline and the ambiance. Angela responded that she could not guarantee it, but that she could not foresee any impediments in getting that. She was very prompt in her responses, and very professional. Things looked really happy and bright...except for when we arrived at the restaurant. Instead of the almost certain ""skyline"" we expected, we were given the back corner of the upstairs area - a larger sofa (to accommodate three guests), one more leather chair (to accommodate one guest), a leather love seat (to accommodate two guests) and the rest of the seating for our party guests was comprised of black plastic chairs (the type that are extremely uncomfortable and inappropriate for such an event). Those chairs were supposed to accommodate eight more people, more than half of the number present at the party. My disappointment was immediate and voiced the frustration that these chairs are uncomfortable for dinner seating to the servers. I expressed my wish to have some of the leather chairs adjacent to our seating - that were empty and stayed empty until 10:10PM, even though the guests in our party arrived at 6:30PM. After the servers checked with the manager, they informed us of the manager's disapproval. I insisted that I would like to talk to him. Courtesy requires, from my experience with restaurants and customer service, that when the manager on duty is asked to talk to guests, he or she introduces himself/herself first. Not only did the manager who came to talk to us did not introduce himself, but he was very rude and unprofessional, and immediately ""expedited"" the problem by saying that chairs could not be moved, even if no one was seating there (turned out that entire back area was empty for the next four hours we were there). He then added, in an aggressive, unfriendly and careless tone that there was nothing he could do at that point, and seemed unwilling to do anything for us or suggest a solution. Still frustrated with the response, I looked around the room and spotted a round table with four leather chairs that seemed much more comfortable than the initial ones we found when we walked in the room. Fortunately and probably noticing my escalating frustration, the servers moved those chairs to our tables. Then they proceeded to bring a few others, which were still uncomfortable and mismatched the look of the restaurant and the comfortable level of the leather sofa and chairs. Despite the frustration in the beginning of the night caused by the manager's behavior and demeanor, my guests and I had a great evening and enjoyed the great wine and food your restaurant provided. Our servers deserve a great deal of appreciation. They were constantly checking with the group to make sure everything was great, and their services were professional and prompt.  I could not, however, let this incident pass without voicing my frustration at your manager's attitude. After the party I have done some research and found on Yelp similar reviews of customers dissatisfied with the service and manager's attitude when trying to organize parties at your restaurant. I loved your restaurant up to this point, but this experience left a bitter taste in my mouth. I hope that by bringing this to your attention it would help your business in the future, and that other customers will be able to enjoy a great restaurant.

I also loved that the flights had fun names, after musicians.  I had the Aretha Franklin, and it was sweet and sassy-like the singer herself.  2) The food.  OMG-delicious.  I had the tomato soup with the grilled cheese sandwiches.  The sandwiches were a little on the small side, but for $8 it tasted more gourmet than other soups or small plates I've had at other places.  I also had the scallops in a pancetta bowl with fancy grits.  The scallops were amazing.  Scallops can sometimes be hard to do great-but the Tasting Room succeeded!   Things I did not like: 1) The service.  Maybe it's a testament to the food and wine, the place was packed and the servers were extremely busy.  I think that if the place hired a couple more servers and chefs, this would get a 5 star rating from me.  There was also a private party going on upstairs-so that might be why our service was so-so.  Our waiter knew an extensive amount about the wine, and was great at making suggestions-however it took forever to get our food, and we had asked for coffee, which he forgot.  I'll have to go again to see if this is something that's a standing problem, or was an off night.  2) The dining room.  It was cold!!!  Because of said private party upstairs, we had to sit on the ground floor.  We weren't even that close to the door, but it was cold, really cold.  I dined with my winter coat on.  I'm sure if I go  back in the summer, I won't have this problem-but it kind of soured my experience.   Overall, I would go for the food and wine.  Maybe what I experienced were one off or seasonal incidents.  It was worth going to to check out.",0.9847,0.875,0.105,0.021,0.5432407407407408

If you're not picky on wine and just want a hip, social, and modern atmosphere, this is a good place for you - great views of the city. But if you're here for standout wine and food, this place is not for you.  We ordered appetizers and wine flights and truthfully everything was just ok. There were definitely Wine Flights that were super reasonable (11 dollars for 3 tastings) but none of the wine selections left a memorable impression.  What we tried:  -The IGGY POP WINE FLIGHT( South American Wines - all Argentinian) - all the wines, while full bodied and chilled perfectly, had a rather dry finish on the palate and not much complexity. Almost like the wines were too young to open.  -The SLY STONE WINE FLIGHT (Spanish Wines) - was a $17 flight so we were expecting quality. ""Ehhh"" again, the selections were not standout, seemed too young to open, and very dry. We've had plenty of Argentinian and Spanish wines in our lifetimes to know that these were not memorable selections.  - Their BURGER was pretty decent  - my husband liked it a lot. Although it's on the ""Small Plates"" menu it's pretty much a regular sized burger. And the handcut fries that come with it are very good and crisp. It's a good deal for what you get.  -I was hoping their BACON WRAPPED DATES would be standout but they are just ordinary. I'm biased because of Cafe Babareeba's dates.

Nice staff, delicious food (menu is always changing which is cool because you can always try something new), and yummy wine of course.   The atmosphere is so cozy... great view of the city from upstairs where there is a bunch of comfy couches. Really relaxed place great for socializing and hanging out with a couple glasses of wine and grazing on some tasty food with great friends. I always go with my girlfriends, but I can see it would be a perfect spot for a date.  They have flights, glasses, and bottles (I think half bottles too) - staff is great and if you need some direction in choosing a wine just ask the wait staff or bartender.

Let me begin by agreeing with many of the reviews that complain about the lack of responsiveness--y'all need to call people back when they leave messages with reservations. Word. But this annoyance aside, this place is charming, cozy, fun and a real neighborhood gem. I ordered the Ella Fitzgerald flight: prosecco, cava and sparking pinot for only $10. A winner. My friend ordered the Sly Stone flight, a lovely selection of Spanish reds for $18. Numity num num.  We then ordered the PEI mussels--darn tasty--and the cliche but incredibly delish fondue. If we weren't ladies we would have been dipping our fingers into the fondue pot when we ran out of the apples, chicken, potato and bread slices. Alas, the price one must pay for keeping up appearances. More wine was ordered and we talked and laughed while toasting to the lovely city view. With a Groupon this came in just under $100 before the tip. I'll be back!",0.9415,0.811,0.126,0.063,0.5387218045112782

I tried calling for reservations all day, and no one picked up the phone. I had a Groupon to use, and I thought that if I would come around dinner time, they'd be able to fit us in. And we were more than willing to wait for a seat. When we got there, we were ""greeted"" (if you can even call it that...) by a hostess with a snooty attitude. She asked if we had reservations. When I told her I was trying to call all day and couldn't make one, she told me that  they were all booked for the night. BUT...then she mentioned we could sit at the tables without menus on them, meaning those tables were not reserved. And there were quite a few of these 'open' tables. So why would she give us attitude and tell me that they were booked, if there were plenty of open seats?? We ended up sitting on a loveseat with a table, and it was actually very nice and cozy. The service was sub-par. The food wasn't bad, but again, nothing to rave about. Maybe we weren't dressed ""classy"" enough for this establishment.  Or maybe they knew we didn't have a reservation, so we lost their respect.

Since we had a groupon, we decided to give this place a try for happy hour.  2 flights of wine, 2 small plates, and 2 additional glasses of wine = $100.  Even with the groupon, this place is not worth the price.  The wine was average, the sevice sooooo slow and the food not inspiring.  Come on, $15 for a simple flat bread!  The view was nice but there are so many better places on Randolph with better food and service.",0.9231,0.834,0.132,0.034,0.430026455026455

I am still a wine novice -the menu of wine flights does a good job of giving a description of each wine.  I wouldn't mind a little more substance and a little less of the semi-inane anecdotes that accompany most of the descriptions. For food we ordered bacon-wrapped dates (delicious but not any more so than anywhere else), cheese fondue (great for sharing and very tasty), the brie and walnut flatbread and the green and white flatbread (which comes out with large onion rings thrown on top of the pizza -an interesting flavor combo that somehow worked).  The food was all very good, complemented the wine tastings well, and proved to be generous enough portions to satisfy the five of us.  Very reasonably priced also.   One caveat -they are impossible to contact!!!  Our reservation was for 8pm for 6 people -I tried calling earlier that evening to change it to 5 people, and sat on hold (without ever speaking to anyone) for several minutes before hanging up.  I tried calling again closer to 8 as it looked like we would be a few minutes late -again, couldn't reach anyone.  It worked out fine -it wasn't a big deal that we were a little late or had a smaller party, but if I had had a real issue or question, or had wanted to change/cancel the reservation, there would have been no way to reach anyone.  I asked the hostess about this when we arrived, and it basically sounds like they just ignore the phone when they get busy.  That was the only real negative to start off an otherwise lovely evening.",0.9926,0.795,0.154,0.05,0.47503875968992254

I would say everyone was satisfied. The view from the second floor event room was very nice. The ambiance was great. The bartenders did a good job keeping up with the demand.  The not so good: the layout of the room. Concerns were expressed about how the room was laid out before the event. They were all ignored and the anticipated bottle necks in the flow of people were created. Decent food but nothing to write home about.  The bad: Concerns were raised earlier and throughout the night that were not rectified by management. The event was completely understaffed even though less people showed up to the event and we overestimated the number we gave them by about 20%. We specifically stated that though this is a tasting place, we wanted the guests to leave feeling like they had dinner. Yeah..... some people didn't even get food. How is that possible?! Dessert was left in a corner of the room right next to coat check. So, unless you were leaving before they kicked us out, you probably won't notice they were there. The food came out sporadically, at best. Kitchen was obviously not prepared for the event.  It is clear that the Tasting Room have no experience whatsoever with events. So, if you are looking to do one there, either be incredibly specific about things such as how many waitstaff, how many platters of food (and have someone count them as they comes out). how often they should be coming out and how large are the portions (you should NEVER have to worry about these things but.... live and learn) and have that all in your contract.

The menu has a great variety and I believe anyone would be able to find at least one dish that they like. I suggest trying their Tasting Plate to get good value on the charcuterie and their specialties.  We ordered mussel 2 ways, blowtorch beef salad and the house tasting plate. The mussel with moody blue cheese & belgian pale ale taste much better than the vin blanc. I find the vin blanc a bit too sour for the mussel. I ended up picking the mussel from the vin blanc, dipped it in the other sauce and have a very happy time. Blow torch beef salad was wonderful! The vinaigrette was perfect and I couldn't stop eating it. The tasting plate has very good variety and is big enough to share with 2-3 people. I think if we hadn't had those two dishes first we'd still be full. The tomato bread was THE BEST. We couldn't stop eating that bread with the cranberry peppercorn butter. The roulette was done very well and has very strong taste just the way it's suppose to be.  We glanced at the wine list and they have big selection and various flights at reasonable price.

The Tasting Room has the downstairs with a bar and the upstairs restaurant and lounge area that contains high top tables as well as couches.  The upstairs also contains the unimpeded fantastic east view of the city skyline.  Throw in the dim lights and candles, as well as the drinks, and I think you're in like Flynn.  Don't mention it.  Do send drinks though. The Tasting Room has changed its menu since the time I had dinner there.  It now consists of small plates.  I perused a menu just for kicks.  There wasn't much on it that I would have considered eating.  I have to say I prefer the limited menu they had prior to the change.  Your taste may differ.   There is a fine beer list in addition to the wine that seemed to be the initial draw of The Tasting Room when it first opened.  I had an Allegash White based on some comments I'd recently read on Yelp as well as a Goose Island Winter something.  The Allegash was only okay.  I wouldn't take two steps toward Belgium looking for another one.  The color of it was its best feature.  The Goose Island was better.  My friend ordered something that ultimately showed up in a cognac glass.  Whoops.   Considering the changed menu teeming with dishes I'd never eat, I don't know if I will return to The Tasting Room for dinner.  I may return for drinks.   If you're looking for a quiet, romantic and almost private venue for a date and you have an adventurous palate, then do consider The Tasting Room for your destination.   Four stars.",0.9927,0.858,0.132,0.01,0.47048340548340545

The wine menu is pretty extensive as I tried to go through it carefully a few times but eventually gave up amidst the conversations going on in my party and dim lighting.

It is probably appropriate to share among four people, but I'll admit, I'm a pig and ate about 2/3 of it myself.

The salad was also pretty good (yeah, I ate about 2/3 of this, too).  Two stars off for the reservation process. The entire process. I hate calling and leaving a blind message with no one following up with me. I also didn't like that all the tables on the second floor were reserved (including the prime window seats with an awesome view) and were completely empty the entire time we were there.

Lately, I've been all about the beer, and have woefully forgotten the beautiful bottles of ruby red and crisp white wines that started me on the path to appreciating a quality adult bev (I shudder to think I could still be my 21 year old self who thought TGI Fridays' pina colada was the best thing since sliced bread). Thanks to the Tasting Room, I've been reminded just how good a few glasses of vino can be.  After arriving around 6 p.m. last night, Kristina C. and I were able to sit right away, even though we were restricted to the main floor because a private event was going on upstairs.   We then proceeded to be dazzled by their swoonworthy flight list - finally deciding on a floraly white wine flight for me (Willamette Valley Viognier was by far the best) and a Pinot Noir flight for KC. After deciding a few nibblies were in order, we opted for the bacon wrapped dates and the pretzel baguette (WITH cheddar ale sauce). The bread was hot and delicious, and the dates were complemented by a really nice peppery sauce. Two great choices, among what appeared to be a multitude of great choices. Even though we were able to stop ourselves from ordering the cheese plate, it's at the top of the list for next time. Sure, $30 - 35 a plate is a bit steep, but it isn't just ANY cheese - this place offers a full page of choices, along with delicious sounding accompaniments that are sure to help you get your money's worth.

A coworker had a birthday get-together here, we knew there'd be a big group of us coming in and out, so made a reservation for 20, thinking we could mingle in the main area, order from the bar, and enjoy the view. We got there and they had stuck us in the very back dark corner, w/no view. We tried to move and were told there were other parties coming (who never showed therefore the area we wanted to sit could have worked).  We thought about leaving, but decided to stay for a drink. We were then told they only allow ONE check for the entire party and only 3 credit cards. The upstairs bar wasn't operational so we didn't even have the option of going to the bar and ordering on our own. This policy was not told when we made the reservation, therefore out of the 20 - 30 people who came throughout the night, if they didn't have cash on them, we were footing their bill. They refused to budge on this point, and we ended up being $300 short. Our bill was over $1000, and we weren't given advance warning they wouldn't allow more than 3 credit cards or let us order from downstairs?  The wine tastings were also disappointing, I got a $21 french Chardonnay flight which was completely ordinary. My dad was really excited to come here because he is a major wine guy, and he was incredibly disappointed with his flights as well, and my coworker didn't even finish one of her reds because it had no body or taste.  My final issue was we had ONE server. One. Who also had a party of 8. When you have a huge party and people are ordering flights of wine which take forever, this shouldn't be.

Top tier was soft, sliced breads (thank you for no hard, hurt the roof of your mouth crostinis!), the bottom held the cheeses, chorizo and olives we selected.  All delicious - the olives were HUGE - and the colorful and tasty scatterings of dried apricots, dried cherries and cashews were wonderful. Highly recommend the bacon wrapped dates and the bbq chicken pizza flatbread!!  Our entire group was so impressed with this operation from start to finish.  Will definitely be back!!",0.9959,0.7,0.261,0.039,0.6217485119047619
2010-06-01,4.0,"A lovely evening of cheese and wine? Well, of course.  The Tasting Room deserves more than a fleeting glance, it's perfectly understated, mostly free of tourists (they flock eastward on Randolph) and settled sweetly into a nice, soft routine of good music, conversation...and ya know, impeccable wine and cheese.  Cheese flight: $25 seems steep, but it's probably a good investment if you enjoy things that knock your cheese-lovin' socks off. We selected 5 outstanding cheeses...aided by our very cheese-tuned server. Copious bread to match, nuts to garnish....and nary a speck left. Jellies wine flight: oh, the cheeky names amuse me. The wine washes over me in waves of delight, a flight...if you will. I will.  *2005 Mount Eden 'Saratoga Cuvee' Cabernet Sauvignon, Santa Cruz, California *2007 Chateau Montelena Cabernet Sauvignon, Napa Valley, California *2006 Amavi Cellars Cabernet Sauvignon, Walla Walla, Washington State By the glass, these selections would cost approximately $68 (for 3). The flight? $23. Just enough to tickle the wine lover, while pleasing the pocketbook keeper.  Open 10 years on the oft forgotten stretch of Randolph...well, that's quite an accomplishment.

The other dishes we shared were not as great.  The garlic-wasabi wontons that accompanied the tuna tartare was the dish's selling point, yet the wontons turned out to be bland and incredibly oily - I'm not sure they were drained properly after frying or seasoned at all.  The hummus was served with an assortment of vegetables and toasted pita.  There was nothing wrong with the dish, but it wasn't memorable.  Your money would be better spent on something else.",0.8655,0.865,0.096,0.04,0.6008730158730159

2010-05-01,2.0,"So last night my fiance and I went here for my birthday dinner. In reading the menu, I was really excited, I thought everything sounded really awesome. Well, whoever wrote the menu is a genius, or...the restaurant stole the menu from somewhere else and is using it as their own. The service was laughable - glad I was in a good mood last night to put up with it. The hostess who tried to sit my fiance and I, and another couple at the same time failed miserably. It was an awkward dancing around tables, trying to understand whom the hostess was trying to sit where.  Next up, our waitress. Nearly, the most personality-less person we may have ever met. And the description of the wine flight, though she may really have known her stuff, made me yawn and gaze out of the window into the distance. The service itself was really really slow. It had been 45 minutes already, the waitress kinda walked by the table and didn't say a word. My fiance was starting to peer around the restaurant hoping to see if our food was somewhere in the distance. And we got there early mind you, it was not very busy yet. The food is southern comfort, and I can't stress that enough. It is not really New American, so don't be misled by what the menu would make it out to be. The quality of the food was good, but it never went above and beyond. It sat at good, and never impressed - except for a particular mushroom on the plate which was great, but it was one mushroom out of a plate of fried chicken on the bone, mac and cheese, and cornbread waffles. My fiance was fairly disappointed. My skirt steak was not the best cut of meat, often being very chewy. The presentation of each plate of disorganized and didn't follow the theme that the menu would indicate.  The menu says cocktails. But each cocktail was served in a martini glass with a flower! Every drink had a flower! Why?! This is annoying. If you say cocktails, make one. If it's a martini, say it's a martini - because then I know I'm getting something fruity and sweet, and it will advise me to order off the beer selection instead.  I would have to say that if this place were scaled back, redesigned, lowered their prices by five to ten dollars a plate. Maybe it would be worth it.",0.7883,0.857,0.084,0.059,0.46992259876875253

Subsequently, Brooklyn engaged us about our wine palates, was very knowledgable about wines, enough to make additional suggestions about a variety of different wines.

We talked for awhile, had a flight of wine and then just as we were getting ready to leave, she puts down in front of us a wine that she had heard us talking about, a wine we had been lusting over, a wine that is one of my friend's favorites; The Chateau Montelena, Cabernet Sauvignon. Could our night get any better?  The answer was yes. Because even though the retail wine shop next door was closed (it was after 9) they sold us two bottles of this impressive wine to take home. And the price was reasonable. While it sells for $30 a glass in the bar, she sold it to us at the retail price of $44 for the bottle (versus the $120 that was on the bar's menu) Perfection!

This was the very first stop I made with my girlfriend when we came to Chicago on vacation. I had been told that this was quite a romantic spot. I am happy to report that this place did not disappoint.  When you first enter, you're in a small bar area. This would probably be the more typical place to go if you just wanted to have a couple drinks and head out. However, where the place really shines is upstairs. It's a beautiful open space, with large window panes. There is a view of the city that is truly gorgeous at night, and thankfully gives you something better to look at than the parking lot below.  There are cozy couches, tables for two, and another smaller bar in this space. The lighting is low and candlelit, which makes it a great date place in my book.  I think what I appreciated most about this place was that it was a great blend of casual and upscale. It's casual without being a dump, and it's upscale without being pretentious. I am far from being a wine connoisseur, but the staff here was very good at running through their recommendations and backing it up with terms that didn't make my head swim.  My girlfriend and I ordered a cheese fondue and some white wine. It was brought to us in a timely fashion and was very enjoyable.  After that, we had crème brûlée to finish, and it was great. I'm sorry that I can't comment on any of the actual main courses, but I can definitely vouch for the items I did have. Again, it is very date friendly, and it was fun to share fondue, wine, and crème brûlée by candle light, overlooking one of the most recognizable skylines in the US.

The Tasting Room is a little off the beaten path and was a pain to get to by public transportation (and involved the bus dropping us off in a semi-sketchy area).  Parking seemed to be plentiful, but who wants to teetotal when you're visiting a wine bar?  Fortunately I'd worn my comfy walking heels and once we got to TR I was in heaven.  We had reservations for 8 on Saturday night, which we wouldn't have needed.  One advantage of being out of the way is the Tasting Room is very uncrowded.  The hostess tried to seat us at a table but cheerfully accommodated our preference for a (super cozy overstuffed) couch instead.  From our couch we could even still see a little bit of the Chicago skyline! The Tasting Room's wine menu is, understandably, huge.  Our waitress gave us plenty of time to peruse, dropping by periodically to see if we were ready to order but never making us feel rushed.  We both opted for wine flights to start (mine the pinot noir, his the malbec/rioja).  All of the flights have these cutesy pickup line names, which I'd normally roll my eyes at, but which actually work in this context.  I didn't really care for my date's flight, but mine was quite good.  When those were polished off, I opted for a second dessert wine flight and he ordered the full glass of one of my first flight selections.  I do have to say, the flights are a way, way better deal than the by the glass selections.  A flight glass isn't significantly smaller than a regular glass and most flights are cheaper than many of the glasses. Plus I really enjoyed the option of a dessert wine flight.  Dessert wines are something I never think to order and this allowed me the opportunity to sample several different types (though I'm still a red wine girl, for sure). By this point we'd hung out long enough and consumed enough wine to be hungry.  My formula for total bliss is pretty much wine, couches and cheese - so the cheese flight it was.  Our five cheese selection came out on this adorable multi level wooden serving contraption with several varieties of bread, nuts, and dried berries.  Everything was very good (with the exception of one of my cheese selections that tasted like, to quote my date, ""car exhaust""). The Tasting Room is a fantastic spot to take anyone - during our several hours there we saw friends chatting, date nights, and even one group that seemed to be a ""meet his parents"" for a young couple.  It was even enough to melt the cold, icy heart of this reviewer.  Apology accepted, dear.",0.9971,0.816,0.158,0.026,0.468476240312975

TR is a great place to go with a group of girlfriends for wine & appetizers, or on a date for a romantic night out. I wouldn't recommend it for singles looking to meet people or people looking to have a crazy night out. I'm a wine lover, so to me their wine menu  is paradise.  I love the flights and the extensive selection of wines by the glass.  I've found that their bottles aren't too crazy expensive either.  I love that they have South American wines on the menu.  Food-wise, I usually stick to the cheese plate, bacon-wrapped dates, flatbreads and a recently-discovered guilty pleasure--arancini.  They are a Sicilian speciality - little balls of risotto and mozzarella cheese, breaded and fried. The TR does theirs with rabbit sausage as well.   A little taste of heaven.   I recently went to the TR/Randolph Wine Cellar's Third Tuesday tasting.  We had a great time and learned a lot about the wines.  Conveniently, all of the wines from the tasting are available for purchase after the tasting next door at Randolph Wine Cellar---and, they were all 10% off that night!  I also learned that if you live in their zip code (60607), you automatically get 10% off of all wine purchases at RWC.  Such a smart idea.

2009-07-30,4.0,"Great place to go for drinks after work with the girls.  Their specials are great - Monday 1/2 price on all their glasses of wine, Tues - 1/2 price bottles (but only good if you and your friends like the same wine), Wed - $5 summer cocktails/sangria and 1/2 price flatbreads. Location - they have a parking lot, last night was not crowded, but that last time I went on a Monday it was packed, I could barely get my car in and out.  Street parking nearby is decent, but the neighborhood gets a little shady at night.  Greenline is like 2 blocks away, but if you stay out late and you're a girl, travel in packs as you walk underneath, Lake St and the park are not places you want to be alone at night. I've been here on a Monday night to enjoy the 1/2 price glasses of wine. They have a humongous wine list, if you don't like one wine, it's only like $5 so try another!  I went with 3 other girls, we sat upstairs on the lush couches.  We all had about 4-5 glasses of wine each, got about 2-3 plates of the 5 cheese tasting plates, ended with the chocolate fondue.  Everything was wonderful.  What's nice about the tasting plate is if you don't like one thing, there's plenty of it to go around so just move on to another :)  At the end of the night it was $50/person after tax/tip - when you think about it - it's actually pretty darn reasonable. Last night I went with 2 other girls and we sat outside because it was nice out, and to enjoy the Wed special of $5 summer cocktails/sangria and the 1/2 price flatbreads.  If we go back, we're definitely going on a Monday, it's a much better deal.  Cocktails weren't that good and neither was the flatbread.  We tried about 6 drinks on the summer cocktail menu - they need to stick with the wines.  The drinks weren't necessarily bad, they just weren't that good.  The sangrias were decent, but they were both very sweet and didn't have much wine in them, and they had a TON of ice!  Very little liquid and no fruit.  The grossest drink we tried was a toss up between the Diz, which was their watermelon drink with a black pepper rim.  Every time i smelled the pepper I felt like I was eating 5spice chinese chicken.  The other gross drink was the Monk, it tasted like you were drinking a handful of basil with each sip - blech. We got 2 flatbreads to share.  They are a decent size, a little under 12"" in length, it was definitely enough for the 3 of us to share and get pretty full on.  First one we got was the Wild Wild West which has roasted chicken, dark chocolate mole and shaved cocoa goat cheese.  It has bacon but we decided not to get bacon b/c one of my friends doesn't eat pork (in hindsight it would have tasted MUCH better with bacon - bacon makes everything better!).  It was okay, it had a decent amount of toppings, but it was too dry.  The 2nd flatbread we got was the Cedar Smoked Garlic & Rapini.  This was actually really good (but probably compared to the other flatbread). This bread has spinach, fennel, onion, ricotta, tomato & peppers.  There was a sh*tload of toppings on this, and it tasted really really good, very pizza like.  We were pleased.   As we sat, we decided the cocktails were not good so we switched to wine, and we were getting alittle hungry so we decided to get a 5 cheese plate.  We should have stuck with getting the non-special items as we enjoyed the regular menu items so much better.  But now we know and won't be like ""we need to go there on a Wed night now!"" so we're sticking to Monday nights. Service - wait staff here is very knowledgeable and very helpful. They're not the most attentive, both times I felt like I had to flag down our waitress to get some help, but oh well.  Bus boys fill up water glasses on a pretty regular basis.

2009-07-26,3.0,"It's hard for me to convince my husband to go out on a school night but with the help of my two friends who just started dating one another, they were able to get him out for dinner at the Tasting Room at Randolph Wine Cellars! I have been here on one other occasion but never had a chance to eat their food - so I was very excited to try their small plates.  As always, I asked for the waitresses recommendations and I could tell from the way her eyes lit up that the food would be really great! We started off with their wine flights, all creatively named.  Mine for instance was called, ""I lost my number can I have yours?"" featuring three wines from around the world, all dry and earthly. From looking at the menu, it was obvious that this would be a tasting night - since many of their dishes are small plates and great for sharing.  Our starter dish was theTuscan Wild Game Sausage - a combination of duck, wild boar and rabbit sausages.  It was delicious! The crust was nice and flaky, the ragout was slightly chunky and sweet.  I love the saltiness of the sausage and the sweetness of the sauce. The other recommended dishes were: Miso rubbed berkshire pork belly Ceviche, ceviche, ceviche Lemongrass and basil Prince Edward Island Mussels. Foie gras smothered flat iron steak Unfortunately, the only impressive food that we ordered was the flatbread.  It was all downhill from there.  I'm not sure where the executive chef, Marc Kuchenbecker was that night because all of us felt that the rest of the food was a HUGE disappointment. Let's begin with the mussels.  They were nicely presented but there was almost no broth. Maybe a 1/4 cup at the bottom. The mussels were dry and shriveled looking and when I took a bite of it, it was cold and the broth was extremely bitter. As though there was too much lemongrass overpowering what little sauce there was. Ceviche - ok, it was fresh but really not impressive.  It was $14 for a few tablespoons of unexciting fish. Foie gras flat iron steak - cooked medium rare. Again - served lukewarm. I feel like I cannot even remember if this was good or not because I was so disappointed with the food temperature that it was the only thing I could think of. If there is a pet peeve of mine when it comes to food is COLD FOOD.  I want my food piping hot, fresh off the stove.  This was absolutely a huge disappointment. Miso rubbed berkshire pork belly - finally a dish that came out piping hot (but only after my friend mentioned to the waitress that the food was coming out cold and the food was not very good).  I really enjoyed the root beer foam (even though I'm SO OVER foam) but it was unique.  It cut the fattiness (deliciousness!) of the pork belly and again was a great taste sensation of sweet, a little tart and salty. I'm rarely a winer in restaurants when I'm not happy with the food - I'd rather keep my mouth shut and just never return again (yes, passive agressive...) but as I mentioned above, my friend pointed out the problems with the food and she promised to take care of us the rest of the night with some more selections from the house. Ok - so Chef redeemed himself.  The food came out hot and tasty!  Five hour braised ribs - very tender and flavorful.  I would recommend this dish over the flat iron steak. Country Fried Catfish - again, served very hot. The catfish was wonderfully fried with a very light dusting of flour.  The corn fritters that accompanied the dish were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. There was also a mound of stone ground mustard on the side of the dish to dress up the catfish.  I think the catfish really needed the mustard because the fish itself was bland. Perhaps that was the intention of the dish - to use the mustard to spice it up. I would recommend this dish as well, but as long as you like mustard. Peach and Corn Soft Shell Crab (not on the menu) - wow, this was impressive.  What a delight to see an in-season fruit served with a crunchy soft shelled crab!  I loved this one and if I could do it again, I'd order it and eat it all by myself. Sooooo...I'm really glad that Chef gave us the opportunity to make a difference in our experience. We all agreed that had that not happened, we'd probably never return - at least not for the food.

2009-07-21,2.0,"Decent wine? Okay. Customer service? Not so much. If you're looking for both, there are better wine bars in the city.  It all started after a member of our group choked on one of the pork belly appetizers being passed around at a tasting. While another friend acted quickly and proceeded to give her the Heimlich before she turned completely blue, no one on the staff bothered to make a move, not even an ""Are you okay?"" after my friend was breathing again. We probably should've taken that as a sign, yet we returned for another visit last week. We had a nice enough time, even though our waiter attempted repeatedly to up-sell to us (""We're out of that wine, but we have a similar one"" - a similar one for $4 more per glass).  After our evening, I got home and realized I had accidentally left my backpack there. I called the next day as soon as they opened, described my bag and where we had been sitting. The gentleman who answered the phone politely asked me to hold. After waiting on hold for several minutes, a woman came on, asking, ""Can I help you?"" ""Um, yes, I was holding for someone who is checking on a lost item for me."" I explained the situation again, to which she impatiently replied ""Well, I'll take your number and have someone call you."" What just happened? Is the guy still looking for it? Are you too busy because you've had a mad rush of people at 4:00 in the afternoon?! Anyway, hearing nothing after three hours, I called back and got the same individual. After listening to my spiel again, without missing a beat, she replied, ""Yeah, we haven't found anything like that."" Why do I suspect she never checked and was blowing me off? When she asked if I'd like to leave a message for the bar manager, I was directed to his voicemail. In my voicemail message, I explained the situation AGAIN said that I'd appreciate if they could check for it and let me know either way.  Needless to say, four days later, I still hadn't heard a peep. I figured I'd give it one last shot, so I called back yesterday and asked for the bar manager. The woman who answered seemed willing to respond to my situation and assured me she'd look for it herself in the places it might have been stowed, as well as asking the evening shift when they came on duty. She then said, ""Either way, you'll hear back from me before 4:30"". Well, you can guess what happened. 4:30 came and went and nothing. I got to work this morning and surprise, no messages.  If I left my backpack there, it's my fault. But is it too much to ask for a simple response? Either, ""It's here, come and get it"" or ""I'm sorry, we've searched and it's not here.""

2009-05-03,2.0,"The girls and I decided to meet up for drinks after dinner.  When my friend suggested The Tasting Room, I was already dreaming of the delicious port I would have to finish off my evening. The place has a nice atmosphere, modern and spacious.  I guess I missed the view, even though we were sitting upstairs.  The hazards of sitting with your back to the window I guess.  I did get to see a girl fall off the couch and french braid her bf's hair, though, so we'll call it even. The wine list is extensive, with a lot of options that were new to me.  I was eyeing one of the dessert wine flights and asked our server for her opinion.  I told her the flights sounded good, but I didn't want anything overwhelmingly sweet.  She just responded that they were all sweet.   OK, so then I was looking at the ports.  I love LBV ports, but they didn't have any.  They did have a couple of options that I knew nothing about.  When I asked our server specifically about them, she just responded that she doesn't care for port.  Ummm...ok. She'd already come and gone twice and I still couldn't decide at this point, but I figured I would try the white port.  When the server came back, I asked again.  She didn't know anything about that port, except that people seem to like it.  I asked about another and she didn't know that one either.  She then pointed to the most expensive port and said she heard that one was good.  Yeah, no.  I decided to go with the white port out of sheer frustration. Call me crazy, but if you work in a wine bar, shouldn't you know something...anything...about the offerings?  Maybe the training sessions should be focused more on the wines than up-selling techniques. Overall, I was not impressed.  My port was mediocre at best and left a bad taste in my mouth.  Disappointing, especially since it wasn't cheap.  My friends' food looked good, but I don't think I'll be back to find out.  Darn, and I was really hoping my 100th would be a great one!",0.9841,0.767,0.152,0.081,0.498663101604278

Now the bad news.  The service was terrible.  Our server had a very laissez faire attitude from the beginning of our night all the way through the end.  He was unhelpful with the wine list, took a long long time to greet us and take our order, and well, frankly didn't seem to give a sh*t (among other things). When asked for more bread (the cheese comes with 3 little slices) he didn't manage to get it to us until after we had PAID our bill. When we mentioned our dissatisfaction he simply said, ""I was in the weeds"". What? First of all...it was slow. Second, you never say that to a customer! An apology would have been nice but alas, too much to ask. The food: defiantly a miss. Bacon on the dates was undercooked. The mussels were just OK.  They came with some nice crusty bread for sopping the sauce however there was less then an inch of broth.  I don't understand why they would even bother with the bread if they skimp on the broth. Plus, isn't that one of the most fantastic things about mussels...soaking up the broth with some crostini or bread?!? The flatbreads: steer clear unless you like Celeste pizza or some other frozen brand of pizza.  Cheap ingredients= not so tasty food. The one positive on the food aspect is the cheeses and cured meats. Delicious! Unfortunately, they can't take credit for that.

2009-03-16,2.0,"Can great wines, a good cheese selection, and good waitstaff make up for really poor management and forgettable food? Go to The Tasting Room and find out for yourself. Just don't go for dinner.  Here's what they advertised: ""To celebrate our transition from 'wine' to 'wine & dine,' The Tasting Room will host a public launch party on Thursday, March 12 from 5:00-7:00pm. Guests will sample new menu items, and sip on seasonal cocktails and a selection of fine wines from our by-the-glass list. Admission is complimentary, and by RSVP only. Space is limited and on a first-come-first-served basis."" That's what management wrote. Sounds good, doesn't it. On the phone requesting a reservation, they blatantly lied about how sold out it was and what an ""event"" it was.  So our innocent group arrived and sat at one of about four occupied tables at this ""reservations-only sold-out"" event. We were immediately told that nothing is free, they ""may"" pass some food samples later, and wines by the glass (not bottles) were half price. Such a deal - $12 and $18 glasses of wine for ""only"" $6 and $9! It looked and felt like any other night in an empty bar when you arrive before anyone else. We did eventually see some free hors d'oeuvres passed to other tables, but not ours. One time we managed to each get a small piece of a flatbread being passed. And the final, most unbelievable, evidence of poor management: A server later brought out another flatbread sample, offered me a piece, then walked away without offering the ladies at our table a piece. I looked around in amazement as he offered the tray to another couple, hoping he'd then come back to the ladies' side of our table. That would have been poor service, but something of a recovery. Nope, on he went to another table in the opposite direction. Where did they get this guy, and has anyone ever considered training their people to (1) serve the ladies first, or, (2) at least serve the ladies at some point! Everything we saw on this first night of introducing a new full dinner menu showed how poorly management is running this restaurant.  Now, the other issues. Décor - terrific. It's really a warm, comfortable space, both upstairs and down. That's unchanged from when it was a wine bar only. Tables have been added, but the décor remains the same.  Food - horrid fried green tomatoes (and the waiter's recommendation -he should stick to recommending wines). A Denny's couldn't do them any worse - all breading and tasteless. Nice flatbreads, but nothing special. Porkbelly - all porkbelly is good, but their mediocre cut of porkbelly, coated in root beer foam, is the worst good porkbelly I've had. Still tasty, but everyone else's is better. And luckily you couldn't taste the root beer. Apparently The Tasting Room's food focus will be another chemistry class restaurant, looking to reach deeper into its diners' pockets to pay for the latest & greatest that comes out tasteless.  Their cheese selection is excellent, which we ordered and let sit for an hour so the cold cheeses would warm up. The Epoisse is absolutely perfect. All the cheeses are good. The wine selection is extensive, and our waiter very helpful in matching each of our interests with wines by the glass. Excellent wines.  My suggestion: Go for the wine. Go for the cheese. Go for the great waiters. For that they can have four stars. Don't go for dinner. Go early and have a few small plates, or late and just have wine and cheese.

However, I have to take off a full two stars for their business practices.  The woman we worked with, Elisabeth, while very friendly and enthusiastic, was the source of a lot of problems.  We had a hard time ""pinning her down"" on prices, which led to a lot of confusion and conflict later on.   For instance, we had agreed to a certain price for five hours, but she later said the price was for four hours.  We stuck to our guns (I had extensive notes from our meeting and I know we were right) and she gave in, but it was unpleasant.  As another example, about a week before the wedding, we specifically told the Tasting Room that we would pre-pay our balance, or pay after the event (and put our credit card down for insurance), and they agreed that was fine.  However, they confronted us with the bill -- as if we were deadbeats -- in front of our guests at the end of the night.  We eventually worked everything out, but it was extremely unpleasant, and really put a damper on our wedding night.  I can say, however, that Nick, who is the manager, worked with us in good faith, and we appreciated that. All in all, here is my summary:  We had a beautiful wedding reception and we and our guests absolutely loved the food, the drinks, the setting, the wait staff, the decorations, etc.  It was gorgeous.  But make sure in dealing with the Tasting Room event staff that you get everything in writing and that you're not timid about pinning them down on prices and how the transaction will work in terms of timing and payment, etc.  If you have any questions, please don't hesitate to send me a private message.",0.9952,0.764,0.179,0.058,0.5770899470899471

As seats?  Awesome.   We sat down on a comfy couch and were immediately pestered by an overly friendly waiter.  Some might call this good service, but really, I'd like to look at the menu before I order, thanks.   After much hemming and hawing, we each ordered a glass of wine and a flight of 5 appetizer-y things (4 cheeses, 1 bowl of olives).  For $25 we assumed small portions, but when the food came out, it was definitely a reasonable amount.  Plenty of cheese accessories- bread, fruit, nuts.  Yum!   Our bill for 3 glasses of wine and the (well presented) flight of 5 was $78.  Not too shabby considering we did order some of the more expensive wines and we both walked away sated.   The bad news: some people at the Tasting Room might think that sitting on a couch with a date means that it is ok to play tonsil hockey and put their hand down the trousers of their date.  Guess what- dark lighting, good music and wine do not equal public couch fondling.  Take it somewhere else.  I will definitely go back, especially on the Monday and Tuesday nights that are advertised as being half-price glasses and half-price bottles.",0.9815,0.82,0.135,0.045,0.48127572016460907

It was my first time there, but I envisioned it to be a little less crowded.  However, my group of co-workers and I sampled 30 great wines.  We each bought at least one bottle.  It was a great event and we all clearly enjoyed it.  The appetizers they served were pretty tasty, but the wait staff for the tasting did not come around too often.  Though the focus was on the wines during the wine tasting, it would be nice to have sample a few more appetizers.  Of the appetizers I tried (caprese salad, bruschetta, and pizza), I did enjoy them.   The atmosphere was very cute!  The exposed brick added to the comfortable feel of the Tasting Room.  There was also a wide selection of wines available for sale on the first floor.  I was torn between giving the Tasting Room 3 stars or 4 stars.  The wines we sampled were GREAT and there was a wide selection available for purchase.  The Tasting Room has a great view of the skyline and a great atmosphere, but it's quite a walk from the loop.  There is ample parking in the area though.  People from my group were hungry as we came straight from work, but the food was not served often.   I guess for now I'll rate the Tasting Room 3 stars, but I'll have to go back to either try some more of their food or do another tasting.",0.9967,0.787,0.195,0.018,0.45890937019969286

The Tasting Room is Hands down one of THE best wine bars I have ever been too and I have been to a couple in Chicago so far. I like wine bars for different reasons. The cheese, wine, crowd, and ambiance. I loved everything but cannot comment on the food as I didn't order anything. The space alone is an ideal spot to spend a evening with good friends or a date. The low candlelights make the room cozy. The view is nice, as well as the lounge chairs and couches, its just the perfect spot for a mellow night out which I am a huge fan. We stayed for a few hours and had several wine flights. My favorite was the Porturgal red flight. I had never really had wine from this region, and the selections were rich, smooth, with a slight sweet after taste. I found it so good I ended up getting 3 more glasses of one of the tastes and then taking the paper home so I can remember what to buy next time i get some vino.

This started with me working with Chris and booking the room. It would take nothing short of two day turn around to get him to respond. At first I was OK I had other venues to book, but then became annoyed I was chasing someone down to give them business AND AN OPEN WALLET! Finally the manager stepped in, Brenda, I thought wonderful! Now we are getting somewhere. She explained they were in transition.  Things progressed from there, however towards the end what a mess.............They booked us for a party by the hour per person! I have never heard of such a thing. its wine tasting not an open bar for gods sake! Elizabeth the coordinator made an error in not billing us for the Tenderloin.  She then sends us the tackiest note saying they made this error but yet wont charge us. I thought to myself, then why are you telling me this? of coarse we were concerned at the quality of service we would receive. Brenda assured me it wouldn't and that the email should have never been sent. ugh OK.  So we get our bill, we were charged for the tenderloin afterall, when we were told we were not, per person charge was completely incorrect, and we just shook our heads going what on earth happened here? I asked for the same receipt my manager received and went over the numbers and they did not balance. Per person was off for the wine tasting, and not even in the same realm. Trust me!

Second time on another's dime, we had a private wine tasting in the upstairs back room and it was superb.  The instructor was uber-knowledgeable and answered all of our questions, no matter how inebriated we were.  A drunk co-worker asked if good wine should taste like cat pee, to which everyone burst into laughter.  But she actually backed him up and said that strong reds sometimes have a desirable cat pee odor.   Another reason why I like white wines better... ""Sir, the Tidy Cat 1995 Vintage?"" The food we ordered was very good and the experience was really cool and personal.  Hope I can do it again and I highly suggest everyone give it a try.

Good stuff:  Most of the staff know a lot about wine.  I really don't know much (I just know what I like, haha), so I appreciate that they are usually free with their recommendations. Tasty European cheese plates.   It seems cozy no matter where you sit; I've spent the most time downstairs and find all of the seating areas to be nice (bar, couches, cocktail tables).  I was upstairs only once, which I'll address later on. Not so good stuff: Pricey.  We've splurged a couple of times on expensive bottles that turned out to be rather ""eh"". The food selection, while interesting and delicious, will not satisfy your hunger.  NOT a dinner place. Finally, I was not happy with their ""Third Tuesday Wine Tasting.""  It's held upstairs in a lofty bar area with nice views; and while there was certainly enough room for everyone to mill around, I felt the event was way understaffed for the amount of people there.  I estimate that there were over 100 guests and only 6 tasting tables, with one staff member pouring at each (except for the bar, which had two).  The event cost $30, which is reasonable considering the amount of wines they were offering for tastes (more than 30, i think), but it was very difficult to get through the throngs of people milling around the tasting tables.  I tasted about 10 wines before I got tired of waiting around with an empty glass in my hand.  (I'm not the type to elbow my way through a crowd for two fingers of wine.)  I also didn't feel there were enough appetizers floating around.  We were like seagulls attacking the waitresses when they came out of the kitchen, and it seemed to me that the apps stopped altogether a little more than halfway through the event.  Boo!  Instead of relaxing, my friends and I started to feel stress about jockeying for tastes; so we left once we realized the apps were done.  We won't attend another one. All that said, if you take it for what it is, it is a very nice place.  As a pre- or after-dinner spot, its a good place to gear up or settle down.",0.9671,0.818,0.121,0.061,0.5861861861861862
2007-06-23,4.0,"Why hello Tasting Room! Where have you been all my life? Ended up here with a friend last night after a delicious meal at Red Light and I will never again eat on Randolph Street (which I tend to do often) without stopping for some wine at The Tasting Room after.   I loved the cozy, yet elegant atmosphere of this wine bar.  Brick walls, hardwood floors...why can't I find an apartment this gorgeous? I was ready to move right in!   The menu had a lot to choose from and we thought it was a nice touch that the various wine flights were named after Beatles albums.  I went with the please please me, which turned out to be a little dry for my taste. And my friend went for flights that were all Rieslings that were a little sweet for her taste. However, the waiter did warn us about the dryness and sweetness of the wines so we can only blame ourselves for not knowing what we like.  I think it may be time for me to take a wine class? So if you're looking for the perfect date spot...THIS IS IT! My friend and I were enjoying a girls night out and have to say we were a little out of place among all the couples around us...especially that couple right across from us who simply couldn't keep their  hands off each other!",0.9939,0.775,0.21,0.015,0.624792960662526
2007-06-18,4.0,"It is what it is. The Tasting Room is the quintessential wine lounge, with a no-holds barred interest in libations.  Limited scotch and beers serve as alternatives, but there's no question as to the first love of this establishment:  Vino.  What other venal interests might be tickled?  Cheeses, chocolates and tapas-styled eats as well as personal sized pizzas fill the menu and are served on segmented plates allowing small morsels to be presented in style, as the diner pairs them with wine, be they served as flights, by the glass or by the bottle. My friend and I took advantage of a half-off Tuesday deal and enjoyed a '98 Chateau La Nerthe Chateneuf du Pape.  He was non-plussed -- whereas I'm biased towards Rhone Valley vintages.  Surprisingly light, the wine went well with our tastings, including 2 pizzas, crab/artichoke dip, date/bacon wrap, scallop/bacon wrap.  It decidedly didn't go well with the Vermicelli/Duck Confit.  It brought out rather -- unwanted flavours in the Duck, nulling the wonderful duck-fat...   The decor is very self assured.  Dark wooden tables, with numerous couches and sedan chairs with long windows stretching to the ceilings.   The music was smooth, and a bit non-descript, but decidedly did not interfere with the attention to the dining -- or wining, as it were.  Views out of the windows were met with fresh foliage and a reasonable view of the city, given that we were on the second floor.  The general mood of the waitstaff is that they know that ""you want to be there.""  If that gets your goat, it might annoy you.  I found it a little amusing. I've been rather spoiled by smoke-free lounges as of late, and the amount of smoke in this establishment was a bit much for me.  The ""smoke-free"" section isn't protected by either laminar flow or negative pressure differentials -- so it's non smoking, but smoky. So what's the hook?  Good wine that can be available at reasonable prices paired with competent morsels of flavourful food of many different persuasions.  Yes, even chocolate fondue.  Decadant dining made available in your own neighbourhood.   It's also a brilliant environment to lounge with a date...  Which the two of us discussed quite amusedly. What are the lows?  Smoke and service (leisurely rendered). Still, the ambiance, food and wine selection warrant a 4 from me!",0.9924,0.785,0.155,0.06,0.5066017316017316
2007-06-11,4.0,"I hit up The Tasting Room/Randolph Wine Cellars recently when I had to do some ""research"" for an article.  Since I'm new in town, and a complete dolt to boot, I took the green line out to Ashland/63rd. (Anyone remotely familiar with Chicago will tell you, there ain't NO wine bars down that way. The correct stop is ASHLAND. Full stop. Godspeed.) By the time I got back on the el and went all the way back through the Loop and got off at the correct stop, I really needed a drink. Unfortunately, I got bad directions from a lady at a bus stop, who sent me roughly six long, limping, platform-sandal-shod blocks in the wrong direction. Roughly 2 hours after I set out for Tasting Room, I found it. The smile of the welcoming hostess was like a beacon to port in a hot, hurty-footed, booze-free storm. :-/ So yes, I ordered the Regal Beagle champagne flight and charcuterie board. The Tasting Room doesn't really do meals, per se,  so don't go ravenous for real food. The various cheese and meat boards, however, are excellent for sharing with friends while you sample the vins. The champagne flight was incredible, and has introduced me to my absolute favorite tipple, the Marquis de Sade Blanc de Blancs Grand Cru, an uberdry bubbly with a nose of toasted nuts that was equally arresting on the palate... Right, the bar. Stylishly appointed, though rather small downstairs as it shares half its space with the wine cellar on the other side. Staff was very helpful (in the bar and in the shop) and full of tips--for instance: did you know that, as long as the bar is open and you know what you'd like a bottle of, you can get stop in and get your hooch--even after the wine shop itself is closed. Just tell the bartenders. Someone will go get it for you and ring you up in the bar. How great is that? I'm actually going to brave another trip.

2006-09-16,4.0,"Great place.  Great atmosphere.  Great mix of people.  I've only been here a few times, but always have the best time.  The areas are set up so that groups can sit together intimately, but also very comfortably.  Plush sofas are great for cuddling next to dates, and it is never terribly crowded.  The wine selection is excellent!!!  So is the cheese.  Fondue is to die for.  Haven't had anything else on the menu.  Great date place!",0.9888,0.594,0.357,0.049,0.6730769230769231
2006-08-22,4.0,"I really liked the interior of this bar, or should I say, tasting room. We had a very large group, and they were able to accomidate. They actually set up a space for us because we called ahead of time. We had several bottles of wine from the extensive menu. The staff is very helpful and attentative. I loved the couch- super comfy! I would go there for after work drinks or a night cap, although it is quite a ride from downtown- its not walkable from the loop. Funny thing is they do not serve shots. One of our friends asked for a round of shots as part of a toast and the bartender thought we were nuts. So instead, it was a round of champagne. I'll say that I am glad they said no to shots- the champagne (veuve) was far better!",0.9785,0.772,0.199,0.029,0.5654761904761905

2006-02-13,5.0,"It's on Randolph street west of downtown.  Good idea to take a cab there since you will be drinking lot of wine here especially on Mondays.  Try to go upstairs to find a table or comfy couches.   I had to ask the waitress what to order since I have no idea with wines.  She knew everything about the wines and food.  She was talking too fast on cheese tray descriptions I lost track of what she said.  I tried out some cheese and peanuts (spicy). Good atomosphere and wine tasting was okay.  You can order 3 different wine by the glass to try for under $20.   I would go here with friends before dinner.  One more thing, you can bring your own wine or purchase from wine store next door but they charge corking fee.",0.4854,0.919,0.056,0.025,0.6000000000000001
2006-01-21,4.0,"A great place to taste a variety of different wines, and possibly munch on some appetizers.  The upstairs area is very comfortable...with couches and big, comfortable chairs.  Great for intimacy and groups alike.  I highly suggest that you go on Monday...the wine is half-price by the glass!!  The servers here know what they're talking about, and can give you a description of every wine on their extensive list.  Also, you have a great view of the city here.",0.953,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.5923333333333333
