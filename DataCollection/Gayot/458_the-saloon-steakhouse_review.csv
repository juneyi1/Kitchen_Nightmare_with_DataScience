2014-01-09,4.0,It is with deep sadness and regret that I announce this hidden gem and most underrated steakhouse in the great city of Chicago has closed its doors. The Saloon will be greatly missed and was one of the last old school throwbacks of its kind. The best old-fashioned I ever had and one of only 4 establishments in the city where one could get a bone-in filet. RIP The Saloon.,0.6712,0.751,0.146,0.103,0.48181818181818187

2013-12-29,4.0,"Do a Yelp check-in and get a free dessert! So, I think the food at the nearby Rosebud Steakhouse is a notch better--but I love the quiet 60's ambiance of the Saloon. You feel like you are joining the Rat Pack! (look it up kids, before the brat pack, there was the Rat Pack...) You walk past a wall of signed baseballs, past the tiny bar with apparent regulars, into the 60's style steakhouse. Our service was just adequate..and the bartender could not make hubby a Sazerac.  They were out of some of the small filet...the waiter said it had been a busy weekend. Hubby had the dry-aged Kansas City, I had the New York strip.  Both were cooked to our liking.  The obligatory humongous baked potato was fine but no serving spoon was provided for the chives, etc.  My steak knife was missing. Lots of little service flaws. Nothing traumatic though. We had key lime pie for our free dessert--it was decent.

2013-11-26,1.0,"Unfortunately, we didn't have a good experience here :( Would've given two or three stars if not for the food poisoning. It was our first time at this restaurant. Went around 5:30 on a Saturday evening, and the place was fairly empty when we got there. Felt rushed by the waiter the whole time. He kept coming by before we'd had a chance to really explore the menu, finish eating, etc. I guess he was attentive, but maybe a little TOO attentive. Ordered the caesar salad to split with my husband. Quality was average, definitely not worth the $9. I ordered the 8oz. petite filet mignon, cooked medium. The filet was pretty good and very tender, but what ruined it for me was the charred outside. Too burnt, which added an unpleasant charcoal taste. My husband ordered the cowboy rib-eye steak, cooked medium rare. It was also charred on the outside and rather burnt. The inside, as he described it, was quite rare and rather game-y in some parts. He was going to overlook these details, but woke up with food poisoning at 4am the next morning. NOT OK. He called the restaurant to see if they'd be willing to offer some sort of compensation, but never heard back. We did order a banana cream pie for dessert, and we enjoyed that a lot. That, and the corn chowder soup that came with our entrees was pretty good, as well. In the end, the food was only average and not worth the prices they were asking.

I had the Dry aged Kansas City and my friend had the Buffalo Ribeye.   I had my heart set on the bone in filet but his description of the Kansas City was so good.  We both got them medium rare and they were perfectly cooked. Tender and delicious!  We had the mushroom medley and the au gratin potatoes on the side.  The potatoes were cheesy and creamy and perfectly cooked.  The mushrooms were buttery and had the right amount of seasoning.   The meal was perfect!  For desert we had the Key Lime pie and the Chocolate brownie.  I was stuffed by dessert but my friend insisted.  They were both so good.  The brownie had a wonderful chocolate gelato that just melted into it.  And the key lime pie was tart with a crumbly crust.  Mmmm!   I read some of the other reviews, maybe I just came on a good day.  I loved it.  It's not my favorite steak in Chicago, but between the service and the food, It's a steakhouse I'd definitely go back to!",0.9981,0.792,0.204,0.004,0.5998451413085559

2012-07-13,2.0,"This review really hurts me to write. I have been a MAJOR fan of the Saloon Steakhouse for YEARS. Living in Los Angeles, I've always included the Saloon Steakhouse on my don't f with me list of places I must go to when frequently in my beloved Chicago. Tonight changes it all. It seems even the locals have moved on to other places since the place was only half full, if that, on a Friday night in the summer. The GM, although charming, was somewhat under-dressed also acting as hostess. What happened to the women in the nice dresses? Yes, the Saloon is know for it;s lack of snobbery, but I expect a little more image polishing for a place that offers a $55 dollar steak.  I made reservations almost a month before indicating that I was visiting from LA and requested a booth. We got a table on the upper level with no reference to my request. It seems The GM later realized her mistake and offered to buy us a desert and offered my friend a glass of champagne. Keep in mind, my bill was almost $300 for two people. Smart girl.   The food was very good as always -- you can't change a great thing. I only say very good because the deserts were just okay. I had the bone-in filet -- a steak I live to eat and gladly pay $55 to eat. It was perfect, albeit not quite what it used to be given the grizzle component. Martinis were good -- scotch was weak. Our server was sweet as can be, but totally intimidated by her job. She has only been there since November. Every dish delivered was to the wrong person and there were only two of us. On a $300 tab for two,  I expect more. A small issue was her not showing us the choice of steaks in their raw form. We noticed every other table received that courtesy before ordering.  The music is just crazy. We had everything from Michael Jackson to Elvis. Pick a play list and stay with it! It did nothing for the ambiance - but was very, very present.   They seated an obviously very, very intoxicated patron behind us who was nearly disruptive with his frequent outbursts of  insane laughter. I'd say, ""We refuse the right to refuse service to anyone,"" -- but, the place was it was half empty. Cha-ching. Luckily, he left in record time - bill in hand.  So, in chatting with my friend afterwards, we concluded that the experience was just okay. Going to a restaurant is so much more than the food and this one is on its way out without significant change. That hurts me to write since I can't even recall how many people I referred to the place that left delighted. I just can't do that anymore.   The Saloon is suffering from a dramatic decline in management disciplines.

We had reservations for 5pm, and showed up at 4:50pm, the place was empty as we were 1 of 2 tables sat.  We were expecting to eat and have plenty of time to make a 7pm show down the street.  We were greeted quickly and offered drinks, ordered a bottle of wine, which also came out quickly.  After that, we waited until 5:30 (40min after seating) to get our order in (still only 2 tables sat).  We ordered calamari to start, I ordered lobster bisque and Wagyu tbone for my main course.  My wife ordered the Wagyu meatloaf and a salad. By 6pm we had been served our soup and salad, and bread (70min after seating), and yes, these came out before the appetizer.  Our waiter came around to tell us our steaks would be out shortly.  I asked about the calamari, and he said it was coming out now.  10 minutes later our calamari comes out, and 10 minutes after that we get our main dishes.  It is now 6:20 and my wife and I shove what we can down before having to run out the door to catch a cab. Now to the food, the lobster bisque was mostly just lobster flavored, but tasted good.  The calamari was nothing special, but not sure what you can do to make it special.  The steak was salty, I have had similar tasting food at lesser restaurants for a quarter of the price.  My wife said the Wagyu meatloaf was delicious, but was only able to take a few bites before having to go. Bottom line, I'd go somewhere else if looking to sit down for a nice dinner.  I won't be back.",0.8286,0.9,0.063,0.038,0.5325543797766019

Grab the lobster mac and cheese while you are at it and your meal will be complete.  After your meal grab a few at the bar.  The bar is great, old school bartenders can mix up any drink you want and if you can build a relationship with any of them they will serve you well past closing time.

If you make a reservation, you can request a banquette (my preferance) by the window, which makes you feel as though you are in an elegant drawing room, being served delicious food and drink with no effort.

It came with a glowing pink ice cube which made the drink look special. My man's was called The Vesper and was a combo of gin, vodka and lillet blanc. Now, he seemed to like it, but honestly it tasted like Windex to me! LOL For food we had the Grilled Seafood combo which was scallops, shrimps and calamari. It was very good although the portion was quite small. For our entrees we had the porterhouse and the buffalo streak, both were perfectly cooked and well seasoned. Mine came with a mushroom crust, the man's with a white truffle sauce. The mashed potatoes were excellent, creamy and garlicky and the asparagus was grilled perfectly.

I felt so bad when they were clearly not wagyu, but tough and gristly. Neither of us wanted to make a fuss, and spoil my birthday dinner, but I have to admit- we each only finished half and packed it up and *gave it to the dog*. Before we went home we stopped someplace else nearby that we have gotten really luscious wagyu and had wagyu carryout at home, while the dog gnawed on whatever awful cut they served us. She had it in her back teeth chomping on it, it was so tough :(  Anyhow, I feel bad, cause I know he'll see this, ( the evening turned out great regardless ***heart***) But unless they pick up their game, don't bother, find a more reliably rated place. (I'd tell you which beef place in the Gold Coast, but then you'd probably think I was the competition.)

2010-09-22,2.0,"After reading the reviews here, I'm rather sadenned by my experience.  Last Friday night (9/17), my husband, his family, their friends and I went to Saloon Steakhouse on a recommendation from the concierge of our hotel.  We all came from out of town for the weekend and were looking to have a good weekend in Chicago.  We needed a place that could accommodate 16 of us, and they had room at 7:30, so off we went. Let me begin by saying, my rating is based on the food (which was fine, nothing special, and therefore slightly over-priced, but it IS Chicago, and the neighborhood is fantastic - but there are much better places for steak, within a few blocks of here), but mostly based on the service. We did not know that the waiter could not do separate checks for each couple, which I was willing to overlook, considering there were 8 couples, and I don't know many places that will provide that many checks for the table (although apparently the night before, Carmine's had provided 6 checks for 6 couples - but I wasn't expecting the waiter to be able to do that), and he did over to break it down into 3 checks.  The manager was brought over by the waiter to explain to us that it was not the restaurant's policy to do separate checks.  I am not going to fault the restaurant for that (though I know many in my party were grumbling). And it went downhill from there.  One of the gentlemen in our group is hard of hearing and asked the waiter about the beer selection.  The response was, ""There are too many, and I'm not going to list them all.""  When asked if he could give some of the beers, an exasperated sigh began a listing of five beers.  When the gentleman asked him to repeat them (notice, he is hard of hearing, but if you don't know him, you wouldn't know; waiter wouldn't know, but shouldn't be so impatient) he was told, ""You need to decide now or I'm going to move on.""  Then, when the gentelman asked for a beer, he was ignored, and the waiter refused to bring him any drinks.  Luckily, for him, at least there was water. When my sister-in-law got up to use the restroom and asked where the women's restroom was located, she was told by staff at the restaurant, ""We just use the back alley.""  Is this someone's idea of a joke?  Really?  We came here to eat.  That's just gross. I understand juggling orders for 16 people can be a lot.  There was only one waiter serving us, and I get that tables that were smaller parties seated after us may have gotten their food faster, but trying to ask for more water, sides, etc. was like pulling teeth.  At one point, we noticed our waiter was having a very heated argument with another waiter, and we were thinking our waiter was pissed that he was having to serve our table.  One woman had ordered a baked potato with everything except chives.  Her tiny potato (compared to the two other potatoes at the table) came absolutely bare.  Apparently the waiter forgot the stand with the toppings (sour cream, bacon, butter, and usually chives) which the other two people with baked potatoes received.  When the lady asked for butter, the waiter acted as if it were her fault because she hadn't wanted chives.  It took him a few minutes, but he eventually brought the toppings stand. As I mentioned, the food was fine - I had lobster bisque and something else (it doesn't even come to mind), and my husband had prime rib - but I have had better.  The service was what was truly lacking, and it almost put everyone in a sour mood.  We were in town to celebrate a special occasion, and this was not an auspicious start to the weekend.  It may have just been our waiter, but I wish whatever was bothering him would've been put to the back burner because it just wasn't worth what we ended up spending for dinner that night.  I can tell you that EVERYONE in the party felt that the waiter had certainly not deserved the automatic 18% gratuity for the large party.",0.9837,0.86,0.089,0.051,0.41237213403880074

Med-well burger was beet red and skirt steak salad was the same (was also supposed to be cooked med-well). Here's the kicker, the condescending waiter had the nerve to tell us both dishes were med-well and it was light pink. Both dishes were so rare bloody juices were dripping onto the plate. Maybe he thought since it was a table of women we could try to tell use the food was cooked correctly. I understand kitchens make mistakes. No big deal, it can be cooked more. But don't tell me some B.S. response that it's cooked med-well. Just take it back to the kitchen quickly. Don't argue.  -Lastly, at the end of the meal we asked for separate checks.

2010-04-14,4.0,"The Saloon Steakhouse (or at least the bar area for I got no further) is worthy of a review if only for the list of characters that frequent this place.  We stopped in on a Saturday night after dinner in the neighborhood. Now I don't spend a lot of time in this area, but if I ever want a ""flash forward"" to life for the rich and aged in Chicago, this neighborhood is certainly it. The average age at the bar had to be 65 and only because my dining companion, the bartender and I brought it down by many years.  We grabbed a seat at the bar and ordered a couple of martinis. The bartender was great . . . .quick with a quip and a cold drink. I stole a look around. The walls are covered with pictures and artifacts; signed baseballs from the Cubs, signed pictures of the famous who have gone before me, and white draped tables in the back with that masculine steakhouse feel.  But the real character in this place comes from the patrons. The guy sitting net to us used to be a bartender on the Queen Mary . . . oh the stories he was telling. I could have listened to him and his accent all night. The senior next to me could barely stay on her stool but she was having a great time and the guy on the other side looked like an aging opera singer with all of his get up on.  If you drive, the Seneca Hotel (this restaurant is located in it) has valet or there are a couple of parking garages located just east of the location. Use the one furthest to the east as the one in this block will run you a small fortune and they take cash only! But as an aside- if you are a car aficionado, this garage is full of ""fancy cars"" that nearby residents store here.

2010-01-24,4.0,"Steak.  You cannot beat a good steak dinner.  It's something to think about from the moment you make your decision to go to a steakhouse to when you go to bed.  It's a process...an experience...and event.  And man...when you get a good place...it's just awesome! The Saloon WAY over delivered for me.  There were four of us and we were seated promptly and settled in with some cocktails.  I really like steakhouses and have to various places all in the country.  Harris' in SF still ranks at or near the top for me, and Charlie Palmer's in Vegas is probably the absolute top.  But The Saloon is not trying to be Charlie Palmer's...it's just a classic steakhouse in Chicago.  Fairly dimly lit and windy in its layout, the common characteristics are there: some booths, a long bar, tables, and lots of staff moving about.  There was a good vibe right when I walked in the door. The Staff: Our waitress was fantastic.  She was attentive but not overly pushy.  She was nice and personable enough, but did not spend too much time at our table.  But most of all...she was super informative.  She came around with a platter of steaks and her knowledge of the cuts of meat was as good as any I can remember from any place I have been.  She also had no issue with any questions we asked and had the right answer.  Our water service could have been a little more punctual, but that also could have been that we were just drinking a lot of water.  Very small thing...was not a major issue at all. The Food...easy stuff first... Bread: Below average.  Nothing to write home about. Cocktails: Martini's...good and large.  Blue cheese stuffed olives are always a plus! Salads: All steaks came with house salads which were fine.  Nothing extravagant, but still a good salad. Sides: Potatoes au gratan: Good.  Creamed Spinach: Good.  Fries: The fries were awesome.  Shoestring/thin cut fries with truffle oil.  Absolutely awesome.  Must have item off the menu. Desserts: I myself more often than not just go with a scoop of vanilla ice cream.  So I had that but at our table we had key lime pie, flourless chocolate cake, and the vanilla ice cream.  The key lime pie was reportedly comparable to what you would get in the keys...but not spectacular.  The desserts were good, but they were not on par with the rest of the meal. The Steaks: the following were ordered: KC strip, NY Strip, 2 Wagyu beef rib eyes. I had one of the rib eye's and I am going to say that it was out of this world.  Stratosphere type stuff.  I had never had Wagyu beef before primarily because I normally just the rib eye.  But, this seemed like the right time to try it and it was awesome.  The beef itself has a different texture than a standard rib eye (or any other cut for that matter).  It is a little hard to explain what the difference is, but the meat feels ""softer"" in some ways.  It is definitely less chewy (even less than a VERY good rib eye) and it feels as if it is melting in your mouth.  The taste is fantastic due to the low temps that the fat begins to breakdown at and seep into the meat itself.  One thing that surprised me a bit was that it was less salty than a normal cut of beef or rib eye.  I found this to be neither good or bad...it just was what it was. My steak (rare) was prepared perfectly and across the board I was satisfied with my steak.  I tried a bite of the Kansas City and the NY Strip...both very good themselves. In summary....this place is very good.  It's great to get to have dinner and drinks with friends in the first place...but when the restaurant itself over-delivers like this, it makes it even better.  Next time I am in Chicago I would have no problem returning to The Saloon!",0.9945,0.803,0.128,0.069,0.5671858465608466

It was dry (even though it appeared to be cooked properly - med rare) and it lacked any flavor whatsoever. It didn't even taste like they used salt and pepper. The waitress asked how everything was- I told her the truth. My steak was not good. I had 2 bites. Everyone at the table ordered steaks. The filets seemed to be the only ones that were good. Even the wagyu beef my friend had was so-so. On the positive side, our waitress was very knowledgeable and attentive. The sides were also very good.

I then had the flatiron steak for my meal and it was decent but nothing spectacular. The truffle has browns that came with it were disappointing since they were oily and soggy.  The service was friendly and attentive but my friend noticed that when her and I were talking the server would come between us to deliver something or refill drinks. Yes, I know the proper service of delivering and clearing but it did not apply here. Also,  there was so much open space around us.

2009-04-19,4.0,"This is what a Chicago steak house should be like. Cozy ambiance, attentive staff, from hostess to bartenders to waitstaff to bus persons. Nice choice of steak cuts, from common to uncommon (dry-aged KC strip, bone-in filet) and a nice additional selection of non-beef, from chicken sandwich to BBQ ribs. I think the place would have been perfect, except for the table of 8 or 9 that was seated next to us not long after we arrived -- but that's always a problem because they have to speak up to be heard from one end of the table to the other, right? Tiny selection of beer, but the Matilda Belgian Ale was a hit with everyone. Wine list is a little pricey, especially at the top end (why do restaurant owners feel it necessary to more than double the cost of a bottle of $130 wine?), but the selection was diverse and we enjoyed the Girard Petite Syrah. We didn't really understand the Prime Carpaccio Roll. It was supposed to be a kind of sushi/maki roll, with carpaccio taking the place of seaweed, I guess. But there was too little carpaccio, and too much bland rice to make that work. The aioli was also not that special. I recommend going back to the design kitchen for that... As for the meal -- I agree with someone else's complaint that they are not letting the steaks ""rest"" before serving -- or not letting them rest long enough. But what a tremendous hunk of filet! The twin filets were perfect for the wives, and I really enjoyed the dry-rubbed BBQ ribs - with or without sauce. They WERE a little over-cooked and truly dry, but the taste was delicate and the sauce great. A tip -- the wedge lettuce salad is buried in chunks of blue cheese and plenty big enough to share (and for $9, it should be!). A second tip -- this is in the Hotel Seneca and is a favorite of folks avoiding the public, like movie stars in town...",0.9867,0.82,0.134,0.045,0.58171768707483

Let me first explain that we have been coming here for at least 6 years and it used to be one of our mutually favorite places to eat when he's in town. We started the night off at The Saloon's bar, like we always do when we make a reservation. We were rushed into our table, after explaining that we wanted to finish our drinks. Irritating, but we shrugged it off. Little did we know, that's wouldn't be the extent of our poor experience. I ordered a bone-in fillet to be cooked medium; it was well done and was bland. My dad, on the other hand, ordered a bone-in fillet medium rare. His was also really overcooked (well done) the first time, so he sent it back. The server returned with another steak and watched as my dad cut into it. It appeared medium rare, which was fine so the server left. A few bites in and my dad got really irritated --- they rushed the second steak and nuked it like a Ruth's Chris steak --- completely refrigerated in the middle. This, folks, is not how a steak should be cooked. The server proceeded to argue with us about the quality of the second steak. I asked if there was a manager, implying that I would like to speak with one. Instead of calling the manger over, she pointed out both of them (""they're right there. The guy in the white is a real gentleman""). I explained that we've been coming to this place for 6 years and that the food was not the quality that we've expected. I asked if the ownership changed, as well as  if the head chef was on vacation; she still didn't get my drift. What topped it off was was the fact the the guy who was sitting at the table next to me, who claimed he had been coming to The Saloon for 11 years, tapped my dad on the shoulder and mentioned that he also had to send his meat back. This man also spoke of better times at the good 'ol Saloon. It didn't stop. This clearly wasn't the staff's night.

Everyone from the host, wait-staff, and the busboy were incredibly attentive and good-natured. This ranks highly among the best dining services I have experienced! The decor was tasteful; the recessed lighting was pleasant and the portraits of Chicago personalities were a nice touch. The atmosphere was very cozy and comfortable. The vibe had the right balance of liveliness and privacy. The Twin Filet Mignon cost $21 and the Mixed Grill was $26. These are great prices for high quality and excellent portions. Dessert was very reasonable at $6.95 and amazing.  I am not a steak aficionado but this is now a restaurant that I would recommend to many people. It's a rare combination of quality and value.",0.9914,0.789,0.211,0.0,0.6563899613899613

2006-02-28,4.0,"i had the new york strip, dry aged for 21 days and my sister had the wagyu ribeye. both very good steaks, but i'd say the new york strip was better than the wagyu ribeye. this just might be the best new york strip i've ever had.  we had the bacon vinagrette for salad dressing and that was good. for sides, we had the mashed potatoes (awesome stuff) and the asparagus (nothing special). i'd definitely recommend a visit and if i lived in chicago, this would be my choice of steakhouses.",0.9745,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.5512554112554112
