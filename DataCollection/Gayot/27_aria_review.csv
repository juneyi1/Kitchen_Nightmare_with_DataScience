The food was bland. We had sushi as a starter and then an entree. I had the veal osso bucco. It lacked any flavor.

Service was ok. We were greeted, orders taken and our appetizer (naan & hummus) took forever! They apologized when it arrived and said they were taking it off the bill. This was a blessing as it arrived burnt and we realized after leaving the lunch, they never gave us hummus! I ordered the tandoori salad- and I wish I hadn't. It wasn't good- no taste and the chicken was burnt. My friend ordered the shrimp app and salad. Both were just ok.

The decor is beautiful.  The cocktails were standard, but doesn't have some of the fresh ingredients you find at bars and lounges where you would find a mixologist. Some munchies are provided if you belly up to the bar.  The scene has the restaurant-attached-to-the-hotel feel, and wouldn't necessarily be the sushi bar you would want to visit if you were a foodie sampling what Chicago has to offer. You would find guests in their über casual day clothes with kids in tow here. A single nice local who lives downtown seemed to be enjoying a drink and having a friendly conversation with the bartender.  The Fairmont location is in the heart of downtown, so no easy parking without a little walking. There of course is valet for the hotel, which you can use as well.

There weren't that many people in the restaurant, and the waiter took a long time to take our order. The decor seemed outdated, and as my friend said, looked similar to a bowling alley with the colors; it was a sleepy sort of atmosphere, but it would be great as a romantic date night. Parking was easy to find, since it's not in a very busy area. We ordered naan, Brussel sprouts, the lamb shank, endive salad, and creme brûlée. The cocktails were so-so (I had the katan, which was good but seemed lacking in substance - it just tasted like any other cocktail in a bar). The endive salad was our least favorite, since it was difficult to eat the endive as it was presented in whole pieces. However, the lamb shank was amazing - the meat was so tender it came off the bone easily. The Brussel sprouts were perfectly cooked and not soggy. And most of all, the creme brûlée was an excellent finish and made up for the service and ambience.

But bar and sushi bar still open so I camp out at bar to watch Rose Bowl and hopefully eat some good sushi as promised.  Don't see edamame on the menu but -- once someone paid attention to me -- asked and they said sure. Turned out she wasn't bartender so next the real bartender came in and asked what I want. Edamame. Great. 20 minutes later it showed -- all oiled up and garlicky. So I guessed they didn't have regular steamed edamame.  I order a roll to get started then I decided to ask bartender questions about sake, other rolls, appetizers, etc. terrible mistake as she decided to be challenging, argumentative. She clearly didn't want to be here on New Years Day not to mention she had raging cold or sinus infection so I really didn't want her anywhere near my food, in the off chance I could talk her into taking my order.  After much jousting with her finally picked another roll and -- they started vacuuming. At 5:30! Closing time? There's nothing like a vacuum cleaner 15-20 ft away to make perfect ambiance. When I asked about it bartender said (really), ""well it's not bothering me but if you insist I'll ask him to stop."" As I'm trying my best to finish and get out (rolls were decent, but hum-drum) she challenges me about my not eating edamame. ""Would you have preferred our regular steamed and salted edamame?"" Well yes but no one gave me that choice.  So if you're staying in this aging Fairmont and get stuck in snow storm and are starving, good luck at Aria.

(Note to self: communication is key.) My friend got strong recommendations from other friends, who are now suspect in our eyes. Principally, we couldn't believe the service. Vice-principally, we found the food not worth the price. And dean-of-studentsly, the table was sticky. Specifics: When we arrived at 11:15 (for an 11:30 reservation), we found only two other parties in the restaurant. One party, an older couple, kept looking meaningfully between the credit card folder on the table (which sported a credit card) and the service station where a busser desultorily dried off some water glasses. The other party was a young family with a screaming baby. Fortunately, we had nothing scheduled for the day except spending some time catching up with each other. Unfortunately, this describes the waitstaff as well. We waited a solid 15 minutes to be acknowledged, got water and caffeine another 10 minutes later, and sometime around sunset got our mimosas. Months later, someone arrived to take our order, which was delivered to us in time for me to give  parkchicago.com  another paycheck. Once they brought us food, we understood Cervantes' maxim ""el hambre es el mejor salsa."" (""Hunger is the best sauce."") And yet. We tucked in, got a few bites down, and looked across the table to see if maybe the other person had gotten something better. No, sadly. Though I'm loath to admit being able to make the comparison, we could have gotten food of the same quality at Applebee's. Then the check came. My friend paid, but in our debrief on the way to the car it became clear to us that the bill was not appropriate to the experience.

With this plate, you get a combo of all rolls, and was satisfying for just two.  Mixed drinks were decent, but not great.",0.9498,0.834,0.121,0.045,0.6136925647451963

How about a hangar steak salad or perhaps Kung Pao chicken? Umm... salmon? A $16 house Dragon roll?  That's a bit how Aria's menu reads. It clearly wants to be a modern, Asian restaurant. and has not a big menu but is alllllll over creation. On one hand, as a hotel restaurant, you have to appeal to a lot of people but on the other, you should have your own distinct voice. If I walk in and see a beautiful sushi bar but am seated in the main dining room away from it, and am then handed a menu with burgers, Chinese food, items verging on Tex-Mex but have to ask for the sushi menu separately, then we have a problem.  Service was friendly if not a little sloppy and forgetful. My hangar steak salad desperately needed a steak knife but I was more than halfway through before the server came back to check on us.

A few other items of note: don't call a lady in a cute polka dot dress and her collared shirt and tie-wearing companion, ""guys"". If my iced tea sits empty for more than a few minutes, refill it.

We deliberated a bit on whether to give it a try: On the one hand, it's a dreaded ""hotel restaurant"" and the reviews are kind of a mixed bag; on the other, the environment fit what we were going for (fancy, romantic, trendyish) and the Asian-inspired menu looked intriguing, so why not? We started with drinks: I with a raspberry champagne cocktail that was a bit on the ""too sweet"" side, and he with some kind of hoppy beer. (We declined to order second drinks because they were expensive and not really worth it.) The naan with four dipping sauces was a fun way to start the meal. We also shared a small plate of pork and shiitake dumplings, which was a tasty combination of flavors and textures, sweetened just slightly by tiny mango pieces and bourbon soy sauce. But our entrees were the real standout: I ordered the seared diver scallops with pork belly, winter kale, chinese mustard spätzel, and parsnip puree. I love every one of those ingredients on their own, and combined, they were magical. The diver scallops were buttery and perfectly complemented by the smoky pork belly, leafy kale, creamy puree, and the comforting, starchy spätzel. I ate EVERYTHING and wanted to lick the plate afterward, but decided to restrain myself in front of my new husband. (Decorum, or whatever.) He got a fish entree with some kind of Thai basil sauce, which was also delicious. We topped dinner off with a delicious chocolate pot de crème. It was really rich and indulgent, a perfect way to end the meal (and our post-wedding weekend). Brava, Aria!",0.9894,0.838,0.145,0.017,0.5751683501683502
2013-03-18,4.0,"I have to give fair warning for the next stop for restaurant week.  It is really good food.  The Google directions to get there are horrid.  I parked to eat at Aria about 30 minutes before my reservation and was 15 minutes late.  Aria is in the Fairmont hotel, and it was pretty much dumb luck that I ended up finding the place.  Once I got there, they were closing up from the lunch service but seated me anyway.  The place is very flashy yet elegant.  The first thing you'd probably notice would be the marble tables with peach accents.  The person who designed this place wasn't afraid of color and shows it with the vibrant black and red carpet up to the red overhead lights contrasting from the dark brown curtains.  The decor definitely fits with that Asian mindset and I must say I was reminded of my travels to Hong Kong by the warm and inviting atmosphere. The Thai Ginger Kitana, immediately jumped out at me from the cocktail menu.  The drink was one of those dangerous types where the presence of alcohol goes completely undetected.  All you get is the tangy taste of sweetness combining with fresh lime juice and a little spice from the ginger.  Think of it as a limeade with a little bit of a kick.  The naan, is the bread offering there.  The naan is some of the best I've had and a welcomed change from the normal bread and butter that you normally get before a meal.  The naan stands up on it's own but it would be foolish to pass on the four tasty accompaniments.  The spicy spicy tomato chutney was my favorite, followed by the curry lentil.   The spinach and yogurt sauces were also good but not as memorable. The beet salad scored extra points for presentation, displaying the bright colors of the beet are easily noticeable   The sweet beets go well with the spicy arugula.  The candied walnuts at sweetness and crunch and the tangy vinaigrette. Next up was the short ribs.  In this dish the star of the show was the greens. They were tender but not cooked to death, had a porky taste to them that reminds me of the greens I enjoyed in my childhood (and still do today).  The subtle soy flavor in the background added something that made these greens probably some of the best that I've ever tasted.  For me, the greens stole the show, which is a pretty tough feat to accomplish considering how good the perfectly cooked and shaped little spheres of potato were.  Not to mention how aggressively seasoned, yet tender the short ribs were. For desert, I was served a platter of truffles.  One garnished with sesame that was made with dark chocolate  that was so decadent that you could feel the richness of it before it hit your palate.  The other dark chocolate truffle had a rich fruit flavor to it.  My favorite had notes of coffee cinnamon and you guessed it caramel with milk chocolate.  The only truffle I didn't care for was the white chocolate which was overwhelmingly sweet and tasted like a Hershey's cookies and cream bar minus the cookies.  It was the only thing of the day that completely failed for me.",0.9985,0.765,0.189,0.046,0.5507309941520467

The real disappointment of the night was the duck pho. Pho with seared foie gras, duck leg-foie meatballs, and spiced duck breast priced at nearly $30 a bowl should be out of this world.

We started our courses with the Yuzu Pickled Beet Salad which consisted of candied walnuts, aerated chevre, petite citrus greens, and a soy balsamic reduction.  I am a beet fan, so this was certainly to be good.  There were several varieties of beets, red and yellow, citrus grass that was not overbearing, and the balsamic reduction and the aerated chevre were an amazing combination. Having food allergies, I informed the waiter.  He was so accommodating and knowledgeable of menu, he quickly assured me that I would have no problems at all.  Chef de Cuisine, Tommy Greer delivered my salad  to the table and introduced himself.  An amazing culinary genius, he told us about the evening's menu and made suggestions on which dishes would alleviate any concerns due to my allergies. For our entree, we both selected the Thai Curry Shrimp, which consisted of red curry, local vegetables, honshemeji mushrooms, and hearts of palm over a bed of basmati rice.  I can not boast enough about the wonderful layers of flavor and texture this culinary masterpiece contains!  The red curry was not overbearing, a hint of sweetness and smokey goodness.  The vegetables were perfectly blanched, not al dente, just the right tenderness without being ""mushy"", and full of flavor!  Each bite to the bottom of the dish, provided an explosion of amazing flavor!  I truly did not want to reach the end of the course. For dessert, my cousin had the flour-less chocolate cake over a caramel and banana mixture. She said it was wonderful! Again, with my allergies, I was not able to eat it, so the waiter suggested another wonderful supplement.  I had a scrumptious chocolate mousse with green tea ice cream. Service was wonderful.  The staff was warm and inviting - we were even an hour and a half early for our reservations!  They promptly accommodated us, and told us it would not be a problem!

We sat at the table for 20 minutes without so much as a hello from a waiter, we weren't even given a drink or wine menu. I finally waived down what appeared to be a manager, since he was wearing a suit, and asked him if we could order drinks. He brought us drink menus and took our drink orders.  It took the drinks 15 minutes to get to the table. Our reservation was at 7:00, we didn't even order food until 7:45.  20 minutes after the drinks came they brought bread to the table, appetizers followed. The only decent thing was the naan bread they brought to the table. The appetizers were terrible. I had Ox tail wanton soup and my wife had a beet salad. Her salad greens still had the branches on them, and there was no seasoning. The salad tasted of nothing. My soup was so salty I could barely eat it.  Then we waited for the main course. We didn't get our main course until almost 9:00. I had short ribs and my wife had curry shrimp. I have eaten plenty of short ribs during my time in Chicago, and I can say what ever piece of meat they served me was not short rib. It was tough and tasteless, no seasoning what so ever. My wife's shrimp was just spicy and mush, no seasoning. The desserts came out almost as soon as they cleared the table. The desserts were one of the better things we had. I had some sorbets and my wife had a chocolate banana cake. They were good, but nothing special. The manager finally made his way to our table to ask us how our experience was and I told him honestly that it was terrible. He apologized and said our second round of drinks were free. He went on to explain that they get busy and backed up for restaurant week. That night, the place wasn't half full. If that was busy for them, I would hate to see the service and food on a night when the restaurant was actually full.  Overall Aria was the worst dining experience I have ever had in Chicago. The restaurant can't decide if it wants to be American, Japanese, Sushi bar, Indian, or Greek. It seems to be having an identity crisis. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this place.

For starters, make sure you know that it is in the Fairmont Hotel because otherwise you may be walking around for a bit. The prices are RIDICULOUS! There is no middle ground. Every meal was about $30 and that's fine, just there are about 10 options on meals. Never before have I felt that I looked at a menu and really not liked anything or felt like paying that much for it. Our waiter was okay, nothing special. The ambience was fine, but outside the hotel it was so stranded. I picked this restaurant because it was falsely advertised as being on Mag Mile and thought we'd see the crowds of people outside. nope, randolph and columbus was rather empty. Here's the part that REALLY ruined our night. I got an appetizer, miso soup, $6. My bf got an appetizer of $9, lobster bisque. Our bill was $30 no tip included yet. Why? Oh, because they charged us $10 for the water they brought to our table. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? for drinks we said, ""water only please"", and yet we didn't ask for mineral or anything, they just brought out water but charged us $10? That's sketchy. You don't charge for water, or if you do, you say you will. Most people assume water will not cost $10 especially when we drank one glass.  I choose this restaurant, next time I am choosing something I am familiar with. Do not go to the restaurant. I don't know how the bar sushi area is. But after the restaurant, not trying it.",-0.9577,0.864,0.036,0.1,0.5194083694083693

2012-07-22,2.0,"Went to Aria, the restaurant, as opposed to sushi bar, on a recent trip to Chicago.  It's not something I would repeat.   The ambiance is fine -- dark, quirky.  Seems like the Fairmount is trying to out-W the W which is a little annoying but, okay, whatever.   Service was perfectly fine, attentive without being cloying.  And the wine list is very good.  In fact, the wine was the best part of the evening. We had the spicy tuna tartare and the quail egg pork belly stack for our appetizers.  The former was high quality but not very interesting and the latter was the best thing all night -- an interesting blend of flavors and textures. For our entrees, we had the short ribs with thai basil potato mash and apple kimchi and the halibut with tomato broth and succotash.  The short ribs were nothing special but certainly edible.  The halibut offered a large portion of fish but the broth was strong and almost unpleasant.  I spent most of the meal attempting to fish out the cooked portions of succotash (the asparagus was almost raw).

2012-07-22,3.0,"When you go to a restaurant that specializes in Asian cuisine, especially in an expensive part of Downtown Chicago, you expect the sushi to be superb. First off I ordered Ikura which IS salmon eggs, and it has been salmon eggs at every single sushi place I've ever been too, and that is a lot.  They gave me masago instead, and the server didn't get it at all when I tried to explain what Ikura was - large orange salmon eggs.  The dragon roll was also lacking in eel, and very mundane, as was the boring, flavorless spicy tuna roll.  They reminded me of the kind of sushi I could buy at the grocery store.  In fact, I've had much better sushi at a Japanese grocery store I frequent.  I ordered jiambhong, which is a Korean spicy seafood soup, but it wasn't spicy, and rather bland and the noodles were a little raw.  I asked for spicy sauce on the side to liven it up.  My husband ordered short ribs and loved them, so all was not lost.  I heard that chef Chan left Aria the day before we came (bummer!!), so that was depressing.  I hope the new executive chef gets things right.   We did have very good service despite the fact that our server had no clue what Ikura was, but he was very nice, attentive, and even got our parking ticket validated.  We also enjoyed the free orange bark dessert, and the flat bread that came before the meal, although the toppings left much to be desired.   Nice atmosphere, although the repetitive music was a bit annoying.",0.9841,0.807,0.145,0.048,0.5416558961871462

We ordered the Aria, Tokyo, Crab Squared, and Dragon rolls along with some nigiri. First, however, the waiter brought out some fluffy but crispy on the outside nan with a quartet of sauces that were great (cilantro, cucumber tzatziki, something lentil, and tomato jam) which was a great start.  I loved the Tokyo and Dragon Rolls (the shrimp in the Dragon roll is soooo good), and the others were pretty good I just didn't like them as much.  I had a really fantastic piece of salmon nigiri too.  I would've given this place five stars, but we waited a REALLY long time for the sushi to come out.  We waited at least 35 minutes after ordering to get the rolls, if not longer.  To make matters worse, after already waiting a while the waiter told us it would be coming right out and it was probably another 15 minutes after that. I don't know why it took so long, but I wish they would have just brought out one roll at a time or something to not keep us sitting there for 40 minutes without our food.

There is a nice cocktail, wine and beer selection.  The Hemingway daiquiri is quite nice, with a (housemade?) maraschino cherry that is to die for.  We shared a few appetizers.  The pork belly w/ kimchee and quail egg was delicious, as was the soft shell crab and the razor clam gratin.  The sweet pea chawamushi (egg custard) w/ sweet shrimp was weird but not in a bad way.  The entrees were also very good.  I had the cumin crusted lamb loin.  The lamb was cooked very nicely and was very tasty.  It was served with puffed wild rice that was also delicious but there needed to be more of that.  Pad Thai was good, but Pad Thai at a place like this?  That's like seeing Spaghetti-Os at Spiaggia.  The Singapore vermicelli is an upgraded version of this tried and true noodle dish; it was good.  The short ribs, famous for making a winning appearance on Top Chef, did not disappoint. Desserts were the highlight of the meal.  Outstanding.  The dessert choices were traditional Western desserts with an Asian twist.  Our favorite was the pineapple-honey granita with coconut ice cream.  The coconut panna cotta was garnished with a ""chip"" made from carrot cake.  Unique and tasty.  The chocolate pot-de-creme came with housemade Pocky that was flavored with Sichuan peppercorns.  Interesting and delicious.  Service was informative and attentive.  There were a few gaffes - some of our food was overly salted and we had to send back but overall, a nice place for modern Asian food.",0.9988,0.705,0.275,0.02,0.5776190476190477

The bibimbap had pretty presentation, and the flavor was there, but it's not the best bibimbap I've had.  The biggest letdown was the dessert, and it's the main reason for this low score.

I definitely did not leave disappointed and also thought the meal was filling enough.  Ryan and I did the wine pairings with the meals when in Rome, right? We made sure to get different things so that we can taste from each others plates. The naan with sauce sampler was a nice spin on 'bread for your table'.

I went with the beet and goat cheese salad and Ryan went for the lamb rib. Oh, they tasted so good. Of course I liked the rib better and the crunch to it. My second course was the braised short rib and Ryan had the scallop. Both were equally tasty. I am not a big fan of kimchee, but I liked the one here. The puree with the peanuts was so delicious. The scallops were also quite tasty. I loved the mushrooms with the mascarpone polenta was yummy. The desserts were great. Ryan's chocolate mousse was a choco lovers dream. I couldn't really taste the pomegranate gelee but that didn't take away from the dessert. I went with the pineapple chili granite and liked the idea of sweet with a bit of heat. The cookie with fig and the sorbet did help to cut out some of the bite. I don't have a super fancy palate, but I loved pretending like I did. Everything there was delicious.

2012-02-21,5.0,"I visited Aria during Restaurant Week and it did not disappoint. I'm very surprised at it's 3 star rating on Yelp, which I believe does not reflect the food. Of course, we were excited to see Top Chef Beverly Kim, but left more than impressed with our entire meal. I'll sum up the entire night, from beginning to end.  I'd recommend Valet Parking at the Fairmont Hotel, but it's not absolutely necessary. We opted for a parking garage, which led us to an interesting route through the Aon Building to get to the restaurant. Not a big deal and probably saved us a few bucks. We arrived at the restaurant through the lounge. We had no idea we were in the lounge/sushi bar area, and were not greeted by any hostess. This was awkward, which led me to ask a server where to check in. She directed me to the actual restaurant. This was a rough start, and really my only knock on Aria. Once we were seated, the ambiance of the restaurant was really nice and good for a date spot. The food was the star, however, so I'll recap out entire meal. We came for Restaurant Week so we did the 3 course pre fixe menu with the addition of the Quail egg and pork belly kimchi stacks. These can't be put into words words. Simply Incredible! The kimchi is made in house and the combination of flavors exploded in your mouth. We were later told this is Chef Beverly's signature dish and you can tell she puts a lot of love into this. It shows her Asian roots.  The naan that comes out first can't be overlooked. Came with 4 sauces. The fresh tomato was my favorite and there was a good curry lenitl(?) dipping sauce that was also good. The others were a yogurt tzatziki sauce and a cilantro jalapeno sauce. It was a nice, light start. For the rest of the meal, I started with the Hay Roasted Baby Beet Salad. I would never order a salad, but my friend opted for the Mongolian Lamb Rib so I wanted to try as much of the menu as possible. I've never had Beets, but these were awesome. Really nicely marinated and the goat cheese spread had me scraping my plate with the bread. Her Mongolian Lamb Ribs were the star appetizer, however. Really tender and the glaze on top was delicious. Great start.  For our entrees, we had the Cape Breton Scallops and Braised Beef Short Ribs. She cooked the short ribs on the show, so these were a must try. They did not disappoint as my ribs were perfectly cooked and really tender. The apple kimchi was a delicious pairing when eaten together, and the whole dish had a slight kick to it that was great. It was really good. The scallops that we shared were also perfectly cooked and delicious. It seemed small for an entree with only 2 scallops, but maybe that's just because I could have eaten 10 of them they were so good. Again, our plates were completely empty. For dessert, we had both the pineapple thai chili granite and the chocolate caramel  mousse. The thai chili granite was interesting. It was a pineapple sorbet kind of, which was sweet with a spicy kick from the thai chili. I'm not a huge spicy fan, so that was unexpected, but we were just trying as much of the menu as possible. It was still a nice dessert. The mousse, however, was the perfect ending. It was definitely for chocolate lovers so beware. Roasted almond ice cream that came on the side was the perfect pairing. We were pretty much fighting over the last bite.  Lastly, Chef Beverly Kim stopped at our table and was really sweet. She was really nice and humble for her recent exposure on Top Chef. She was busy working throughout the night and we watched her prepare some dishes at the salad station (I think) and you could see her put the same love into her dishes that she did on the show. She took a pic with us to end the night and tweeted at us to thank us for coming. Overall, it was an excellent experience.",0.9995,0.754,0.222,0.024,0.6068376068376069

2012-02-12,2.0,"Meh about sums this whole place up. Our service was TERRIBLE. Probably the worst I've ever had at a place that offers a tasting menu. There was 3 of us and the big round table we sat at was so huge we were yelling to have convo across the table. We all ordered the tasting menu and the portions are huge for a tasting menu so by the time the last course came around (5th) we were already stuffed. The food is really good and the ambiance is pretty romantic. But I will never go here again because the service was worse than McDonalds. The waiter got many of our courses wrong from what we actually ordered and we had to try and remember what we ordered for each course (there were options for each one) because the server had no idea what went where. The person serving the food had no idea what dish was what or what was in them which made our confusion even worse. We opted for the more expensive tasting menu that had wine parings with them. We didn't get our first wine paring until the 2nd course and our 2nd wine paring didn't come until after we were done with the 4th course. So we drank red wine with our desert. Totally not a pairing I would suggest to anyone. The server tried to make up for it by giving us some desert wine as well, but it fell short because that stuff is too sweet and I don't drink it. Plus the chocolate deserts we ordered- way too much sugar. And the service of our desert came 30 min after we were done with our final main course. S-L-O-W. And to top it all off, we had to ask them to clear a bunch of dirty plates that were piling up at the corner of the table. Come on Aria- stop charging 5 star prices and giving up 1 star service.

In any case, if I had to break this rating down separately for food and service, the food would certainly get a 4 (maybe even 4.5!) while the service would barely be reaching a 3. I just don't think it's fair that, when you're paying $22-30 for an entree for lunch, you should have to ask your waiter for refills. We were constantly sitting with empty glasses.  However, the food far outshines the service, and we both fell in love with our meals. I had the kung pao chicken, and my boss had the special indonesian rice dish (nongeng or something like that). He said it was the best meal h'e ever had there, and he's no stranger to the restaurant, so that was good to hear. I'm also a huge fan of the naan and the special sauces they serve with it.

With every restaurant within a mile-radius sporting a two-hour wait, we made a reservation with OpenTable and sauntered down to Aria on the recommendation of a friend.  The place was only about 1/2 full, offering plenty of four-tops, yet they sat the three of us at a round-table suited for 6-7. Feeling like it was to keep the kid away from the couples out for a romantic evening, I didn't say anything. However, it's also not like we brought a toddler along. I would have appreciated it if they'd treated us like a three-top of adult diners.  Our server was personable and professional and he treated our son like an adult, which we all appreciated, but the service was a bit slow  - even for a high-end restaurant where it's to be expected. Some of the food was quite good. The appetizers we had (dumplings and tuna) were the highlight of the evening, along with the naan and dipping sauces. My husband will eat anything, but he enjoyed his fish and my son liked the sushi. However, my kung pao chicken was nothing to write home about.

I don't know.   But I digress...  after 20 min of waiting to be greeted we finally flag down the ambiguously hosty guy to ask him for our server.  He stated that he was more than happy to get our drinks for us so I ask him for a drink menu.  He states that there are drinks on the back of the food menu.  When I thank him but ask for the complete drink menu he proceeds to point to the bar and state that they have a full bar and that he can make whatever I want.  After explaining to him 3 times that I really just want to see the COMPLETE MENU OF HOUSE SPECIALTY DRINKS, he finally reaches behind him and grabs the menu, places it in front of me and then says he'll be by in a few minutes to get our drink order.  Wait, where is our server this whole time?  MIA, that's where.  SO we finally order drinks with our server after another 5 minutes, but, don't worry, you can't specialize any of the breakfast drinks on the menu because they're already PREMIXED.  $10+ for a premixed drink?!?!  Are you kidding me?!?!  That's the most ridiculous thing I've heard in a while.  Once we finally got the remiss server in front of us, we order our first round of food.  Chicken N Waffles and fish tacos...  because I would call those New World Asian Cuisine.  The drinks and tacos were fine but I don't think that my dog would eat that crap.  The chicken was fried WAY too long and it was hard and dry, plus the flavor was horrible.  There was some orangey glaze that just further pointed out the flavorless nature of the waffles.  Tacos, fine... the first time.  Oh yeah, we got the same dishes twice.  They were embarrassed so they told us to just eat them anyway.  We took them up on the taco offer but refused the chicken and waffles.  We were subjected to that torture once, no thank you on round 2!!  Then they took my husband's silverware and didn't refresh our drinks or water.  Second course comes out, but not before the people next to us asked us to let the server know that they left because they hadn't been greeted for 30 min.  They brought us sushi with no chopsticks that was far from fresh and some other unmemorable dish.  My husband asked for coffee, which was lukewarm.  Yes, apparently you get cold coffee without even having to specify it here, way to anticipate our needs on a warm day such as this!!  Then we got some cinnamon rolls that were actually... wait for it... wait for it... good.  I know, hard to believe, right?   On a side note:  the wrong food was served to EVERY table around us.  Instead of letting it slide and taking one for the team, the server proceeded to run over and, in a tsking tone, take the food off of the table and serve it to the appropriate table. Okay, so here's the final score: -Ambiance: 2 -Service: -1 -Menu: -1 -Presentation: 1 -Value: -3 Yeah, I wouldn't come back here if someone paid me.  If anyone from Aria reads this just know that you should be ashamed of yourselves for preying on tourists with your sub-par food, dismal service, and utter misrepresentation of the Chicago culinary scene.  Revamp your menu, pay attention to your dishes, and treat your customers with an ounce of respect if you expect to survive in this market.

And even then it was difficult to taste anything very kimchi-ish about the kimchi. Still, I loved it. Unfortunately, a tamarind glaze did absolutely nothing to make some wild Alaskan halibut taste in the least bit Asian -- and the Maple Leaf Farms duck vindaloo (with duck confit, samosa hash, English peas) was very poor as a duck dish and a disaster as anything suggesting vindaloo. All in all, I was rather sorry I did not simply go to the attractive looking sushi bar in another nearby room -- although they had no customers when I entered the hotel and the same number when I left.

As a huge sushi fanatic I def. recommend this restaurant for delicious sushi.  I ordered the Dragon Slayer and even brought home 2 extra rolls.  Each bite was orgasmic like eating sushi should be!  I also tried the duck and if you like indian spices and flavors you will like the duck.  My husband ordered the Steak and that had some Thai flavors.  For desert we had the Instant Karma and Chocolate cake with Coconut Sorbet.  The Instant Karma was delicious! It is a cheesecake made with mango and kiwi fusion. I enjoyed the Coconut Sorbet much more than the chocolate cake.  The chocolate cake was loaded Caffeine.  The Coconut sorbet was the perfect combination of creamy and frosty!

For some reason, artificial right angles bother me. I know it's weird. Maybe I am innately attuned to feng shui. In any event, I appreciated the layout... and the design. Think deep reds, blacks, lacquers, banquets, and the like. I can see how this would be a fun group night out dinner or a good second or third date (not a first).  Speaking of firsts, my group started with a basket of naan and several sauces. The spicy green sauce was best suited for my taste buds, but all the options were good ones. I had tuna tartare on the brain, so I ordered that and the shrimp tempura maki. My tartare was missing the blood orange and didn't taste as fresh as I was hoping. Don't mistake me; it didn't make me ill... but it didn't quite sate my craving. The maki was, likewise, serviceable but not memorable. In fact, my favorite portion of the meal was my pink lemonade. Yes, I ordered a pink lemonade with tuna tartare and shrimp tempura maki. I might be pregnant. Our waiter was helpful, chatty and very pleasant.

All in all, a very nice meal, especially at restaurant week prices.  I would hope the portions would be a little bigger off the regular menu, because though I was quite full at the end of the meal, I may have felt a little overcharged if I had paid full price.",0.9948,0.801,0.166,0.034,0.5989703253096109

I think my boyfriend described it best as, ""It looks like something a kid would bring their dad to eat - look what I made!  It has fruit and brownies and rice krispy treats on it!""

The small white truffle polenta cake and baby squash with smoked tomatoes that came with the fish were the best part of the dish.  The seared lamb loin was the only entree worth ordering, however the tomato pilaf it came with was incredibly bland, no taste - none of us ate it after trying it once.  And to top the night off, the desserts were absolutely pathetic.  The fondue was a small bit of chocolate which wasn't even warm with a few pieces of fruit and other items, ie: small brownie, marshmallow, cookie, pretzel - cookie and brownie were hard as a rock.  I mean, it would have been fine if I were making that at home or at a restaurant that wasn't this EXPENSIVE but they really REALLY were sad in their presentation and execution.  The other two desserts were a ""red velvet cake"" dessert and a passion fruit and banana panna cotta with coconut tapioca. I put the ""cake"" in parentheses because it was a pudding.  Both served in a rocks glass, the red velvet was just super rich chocolate pudding with whipped cream on top.  Compare that description to the one given on the menu which stated ""warm chocolate red velvet cake, caramel custard, vanilla cream, almond biscotti"".  There was NO CAKE, no caramel.  Chocolate pudding and cream on top.  The best thing was the mini almond biscotti on the side.  And the panna cotta was 2 slices of banana amidst tapioca and creme, no passion fruit of sort to be found.   Overall, the bill including tip was $200+ (without any alcohol).  Absolutely ridiculous.  The food was in no way, shape or form congruent to its price.  Given the vast array of items we tried and how only 2 were somewhat decent, I would NEVER suggest this restaurant to anyone else.  Even on Valentines Day weekend, one would think the food and prep would be better.  UCK.  AWFUL!   Save your money, this place was a waste.",0.2899,0.821,0.091,0.089,0.5032551184725098

I have no transition here, but I'll just say that the decor is gorgeous in a way that's not at all gaudy. Seeing as how we were celebrating, we decided to start with some wine and a couple appetizers. The wine selection is sufficient with many quality choices that won't break the bank. The cilantro-cured salmon carpaccio was good, though I'll admit I've never particularly been a fan of cold appetizers. The wild boar ribs on the other hand were spectacular. Part of the ribs were like pork belly, which I love, and the rest of it were tender fall-off-the-bone meat with a great sweet bbq flavor. For the entrées we got a wide spread. The more fusion oriented thai chile smoked rib eye, which was a bit salty to my taste, but a nice cut of meat, to the star of the show: my wife's Michigan venison with beets (sorry, I can't recall the full dish name). The short rib pad see eew was much more traditional Asian (yes, I know how ignorant and ridiculous that sounds, just deal with it) and just as delicious and well prepared.

2010-12-27,1.0,"Jeez.  Where to start on how Aria gave my family the worst Christmas dinner ever. How about from the beginning? We made reservations weeks before Christmas to do their Asian Prix Fixe menu for $45/person that also came with a movie pass for the AMC River East.  Three, 3, THU-REE times they called to confirm our reservation and our menu selection and every time we said yes.  When we arrived at the restaurant, guess who had no reservations listed for us?  That's right.  Aria.   3 confirmation calls and no reservation in the system.  As a result, we also received no movie pass since they had run out. Fortunately, they had a table for us...a giant round table in the center of the restaurant where you could comfortably seat six but could only awkwardly seat 3.  Either 2 people could sit next to each other with one person far on the other side of the table, or all three of us sitting next to each other giving some other table the opportunity to watch us as if we were their Christmas dinner theatre. I spoke to the manager to see if we could move, and he moved us without a problem and promptly apologized.  No apology necessary, just needed the move. Either way, we were visibly disappointed with our experience so far which is the prime chance for the server (who saw this whole thing go down) to redeem the place.  Think that happened?  No way. We were given our menus as we switched tables, but didn't approach us for a drink order (more on that in a minute) nor for a food order for 10 minutes (we timed it), yet he was setting up a giant round table in a room next to our table and was at every other table in the section. Let's start with the drinks: The water was fine....and that's all I can speak for because NOT ONCE during the entire meal did the waiter provide us with a drink/wine list nor ask us what we'd like! The only drink we were offered was a sip of ""bubbles"" out of some novelty sized champagne bottle to celebrate the holiday by the restaurant ""wine pro"" - NOT EVEN OUR SERVER! While the Prix Fixe option was still...well, an option for us (minus the cost of a movie, but f*ck me if a movie costs $8 in this city), we examined the full menu as well.  My mother chose the turkey dinner option for a whopping $28 and when she brought up her nut allergy, asking if anything in the meal contained nuts because of her allergy, our server...wait...this is getting it's own paragraph... When my mother asked if anything in her meal contained nuts BECAUSE OF HER ALLERGY, our server scoffed and said, ""I don't know what in that meal could possibly contain nuts.""  Considering the amount of stuffings we've encountered in our lives that have, we kindly asked him to check anyway. The turkey dinner was ok. Let's get to my meal: Appetizer - Veggie spring rolls with a spicy brown mustard.  The veggies were bland and ALL you could taste was the mustard.  And, yes, it was quite spicy. ***NOTE*** This is when the bread, an awesome (and the only redeeming meal point) nan was delivered.  Yup - AFTER my appetizer. Dinner - Basically Duck in an orange sauce with bok choy and ""fried rice.""   Gross.  The duck was barely warm, and the bok choy and fried rice REEKED of fish.  I asked the server if there was any shellfish involved in this preparation as I too have food allergies, and he said, ""I don't know. I think it's just our brown rice.""  So the MUSHY, watery, ""fried"" rice and the soggy bok choy were nothing special. Dessert - Honestly, by this point, I had asked for dessert to go and for the check because the whole meal was terrible and the server NEVER answered my question about the possibility of nuts in my pumpkin cheesecake. Meal verdict: Save your money.  You see your busboy and food runner more than your server (whom, to their credit, were working very hard). Now, you might be thinking, where was the manager in all of this?  Well, I'll tell you.  Nowhere.  At the END of the meal he came to see how we were doing, and obviously we were doing bad... So I spoke to him on our way out.  I thanked him for moving our table, but calmly expressed my disappointment (and I NEVER complain - I've been in the industry for a while) in the meal and the service.  His immediate two responses were: 1) telling me ""he's been having a lot of problems with that server,"" and 2) giving me a business card saying it was his, even though the name on the card is Robert Warsaw and he said his name was Scott (so did his name tag) and promising me free dinner the next time I go back. Honestly, it's going to take a lot to bring me back there but for a free meal from either Robert or Scott a return might not be the worst thing.

Things only got worse...our waitress was friendly but it took 20 minutes for her to come over and take our order, another 20 for half of us to get our drinks, and another HALF HOUR for her to bring the rest of the drinks - which only happened after we saw them sitting on the bar for 15 minutes and pointed it out to her.

First-off, our waiter seemed to have come from a weird Seinfeld episode of a hell date or awkward run-in with a stranger.  You know, one of those characters who is socially challenged and talks like a martian and a little cross-eyed?  Yes, this was him.  He started us off on the wrong foot trying to promote this distilled diamond vodka that he was trying to pawn off for $15 a glass which he tried to convince us was a steal.  Ummm, no thanks.  This is where I think Aria went wrong.  The decor and clientelle were both upscale and the bar looked inviting; however the staff just tried too hard where they were almost pretentious; but at the same highly untrained, unrefined, and clueless to the point where they made the whole experience feel tacky. The entire night continued with our dinner interrupted by this yahoo refilling our wineglasses when refilling was not needed, if only to eavesdrop in on our conversation.  He would then slur something inaudible and skitter away and I think fart, because it smelled kind of weird the entire night. The food was not entirely all that bad; however, I would not come back given the lack of attention to detail and cost.  $225 for 4 of us, with a glass of wine each. Housebread:  Naan-like, hearty and warm.  Very good actually especially with the 4 dipping sauces. Mushroom Soup:  Very good and just like homemade; therefore made with at least a stick and a half of butter. Citrus Calamari: Too saucy which caused the entire dish to fall flat.  The sauce overpermeated the squid and caused the batter to become soggy. Shortrib: Had the bubby's and was pretty impressed by the complexity of flavors and the flaky moistness of the meat. Chow Mein with BBQ Duck and Lobster:  I was pleasantly surprised with the amount of lobster in this dish, and the duck was tasty but slightly dry.  I would like to see this with udon noodles and a bit spicier for the entire umami balance. Fiery Noodles:  I didn't get a change to sample this dish but my friend said the meat tasted like dog. Creme Dessert with Crumbs:  Very good, but a little heavy.

The decor is something interesting, inspired by middle eastern lounges with ottomans and exotic looking fabrics.  Do I actually know if they were exotic, or if they were expensive?  No, for all I know - they got them from Target or Ikea.  It's dark in the bar area, so you must note that all of the pictures I took had a shutter speed of at least 1/13 of a second all the way up to 8 seconds.   The actual sushi bar itself is well inviting enough.  The obligatory clear display with the fish and condiments, little soy dispensers, and some creative lighting.  Nothing too great, nothing too bad. Service was excellent, I thought.  I called down from my room at around 830 to see what time food stopped, and the person who picked up addressed me by name.  Sure, she had caller ID, but it was a nice touch.  My server was also very attentive. I ordered something traditional - the Aria Sushi Sashimi platter: tuna, yellowtail, salmon, and shrimp.  I wouldn't call the place pretentious - presentation was simple and it wasn't gaudy, and the freshness of the fish was just fine.  Nothing negative to say about the quality of the fish either. Alas.  Pricing causes the 3 star rating.  My 8 oz bottle of Diet Coke was a whopping 3.50 (more expensive than six flags) and my platter (see pictures) was 28$.  Had the platter been 15, 18, even 20 - I would have been ok, but close to $30 was a little exorbitant.  However, since it was a holiday, I splurged on myself just a little bit.  I wouldn't do it again, but it was a different experience at least for one night.",0.9452,0.867,0.1,0.033,0.5864452798663325

Naturally, I looked up the reviews on Yelp and it seems as though my fellow Yelpers feel otherwise, Mostly based on service though.  We were early for our 9pm reservation so we sat in the bar and had a few drinks. My roomie had a cucumber and pomegranate mojito and I had the bubbles and raspberries. MMMMM! The ""mixologist"" was friendly but not too tentative, especially being that it was pretty quiet in the bar. And we ordered a round of shots, but they were more like triple shots in tumblers. We were absolutely starving so my roomie still had a little in her glass that she did intend on finishing, but the barkeep took her glass away! I kind of wanted to say, ""pay attention!""

The spicy beef tataki was excellent.  Our server was pretty good, but he kept trying to upsell everything in an obvious way to someone else who also works in the food and liquor hustling atmosphere.

2008-12-27,3.0,"Christmas Day fell on a Thursday this year and I just started my new job. So I would be spending 2008 Christmas as an ""orphan."" Thanks to bad weather, flights at O'Hare were all canceled before X-Mas Eve. As a result, some of my friends ended up as ""orphans"" too. We all decided to celebrate X-Mas Eve at a restaurant. Naturally, I Yelped Chicago restaurants. I made a couple of suggestions (Aria was on the list) and the group decided on Aria. I was slightly concerned because Yelp reviews on Aria were extremely divided.  We arrived early for some cocktails. The place was dead silent. A funeral parlor has more energy. Now, this is what happens when you dine on out X-Mas Eve--defintely not Aria's fault--the city was also quiet. However, it does kill the celebration part when you are the only patrons. The server was polite. We shared a bottle of warm house sake. Pre-dinner drinks turned out to be a good idea. Thankfully, there were a few other tables by the time we sat down for dinner.  Dinner is where I start to understand the mixed reviews on Aria. The cuisine is characterized as ""culturally inspired"" American food. The chef's food, however, is not culturally inspired. In fact, I question whether he has indeed even traveled outside the US both physically and spiritually(based on his food). So you can imagine what his interpretation of ""culturally inspired cuisine"" might be. France, Korea, India, and Japan are just a few of the countries represented on the menu. Avoid them.  Stick with the American inspired menu items. Cause it's not Aria, it's America. Aria is an entirely different food experience when it comes to the American menu items.  Unfortunately, my friends chose not to heed ex-Chef Max's advice and chose Chi Gae and Mezze as main courses, respectively. They were both disappointed. The Chi Gae was overwhelmed by Kim Chee. Should it surprise you that a non-Asian chef doesn't know how to deploy Kim Chee properly? The Mezze platter tasted bland and the portions were too small. The naan bread came with four dipping sauces--all were extraneous.  I, on the other hand, followed my own advice and ordered the one American item on the menu: Pork Chop. The grilled Berkshire Pork Chop with Braised Belly came with an intensely flavored luscious Parsnip puree. The texture was excellent. The chop was beautifully cooked and hot.  Our table waited a bit too long for our main courses so the chef sent out a complimentary trio of side dishes in cute cast iron pots: truffled polenta, spiced yam puree with coconut foam, and cheddar yukon mashed potatoes with savory crumble. These were all winners at the table.  As I sat there, I couldn't help but wonder the potential of this restaurant. It boils down to basics. Aria wants to be something it's not. It's the white person with Chinese character tattoos that doesn't even know where China is. It's the SoCal Asian with blond hair and colored contact lenses that doesn't speak her own language.  And Aria is that creative wanna-be don't call us fusion even though we ARE FUSION restaurant. As a result, the place lacks the very thing it strives to be: individual.

I've never understood places that basically turn the lights off to create an atmosphere. Usually because the darker a place is, the more they raise the prices.  It's something that New York City hotels specialize in but they're followed in this sin only by upscale sushi places.  And Aria amps that trick up to 11! I also want to mention, and this is an important consideration in the winter, there is also none more cold! Aria hosted the Thank Goodness It's Over event for the Chicago region of National Novel Writing Month.  We weren't in the apparently ultra private back room and the back bar area they provided us didn't provide that much privacy for a group of 30 or so. Though excusing that, Aria does get props for going all out for us in some ways.  They created event cards and two cocktails specifically for the occasion (or at least they themed two drinks for it). One thing they didn't bother to create was a special menu.  It was their usual sushi menu - which contains not a single vegetarian choice.  They will make an avocado, cucumber, or asparagus maki upon request for $6.  Which was much cheaper than their normal, very average (according to the meat eaters of the group), sushi.  And the maki was nothing special either. If I didn't know better, I would think this was just an mediocre, albeit expensive, hotel bar.  Though come to think of it, to hide that fact might be why they keep the lights so low.",0.9207,0.85,0.099,0.051,0.4763340548340548

On my recent trip to Chicago, I skipped breakfast because my shuttle came at 7am sharp and the driver gave me exactly 3 minutes to get downstairs. When I arrived at the airport, I did not feel like paying $7 for a dinky bagel. My flight was 4.5 hours long and I totally forgot that they don't even serve peanuts on American Airlines anymore. When the stewardess came around to serve the drinks...I was asleep. I woke up a tad hungry and rather pissed because they missed me and forgot to bring me my water when I specifically asked them to. The second time they came around serving drinks...I was asleep again...arghhhh... By the time the plane landed, it was already close to 4pm and my stomach was growling. I caught a cab to the Fairmont expecting the ride to be a mere 30 minutes. Nooooooo.....it started to rain and we hit rush hour traffic. My 30 minute cab ride turned into 1 hour and 45 minutes. At that point, I was so hungry my eyeballs were bulging out looking for chip crumbs or leftover m&m's on the dirty Chicago taxi cab floor....ugh.... When I finally arrived at the hotel and was checked in, I nearly knocked over the poor bell boy shooing him out so I can go downstairs to Aria and satisfy the voracious beast. I ended up ordering the tempura roll, unagi roll, and the shrimp and scallop curry udon. The sushi was, eh, just okay--not extraordinary and not bad. However, the udon was to die for.

First let's talk about the service.  It's probably the worst service I've had in a very, very long time.  When we first walked in the hostess was anything but friendly, but fine she sat us.  Of course she gave us dinner menus and I know that's pretty hard to confuse breakfast menus with dinner menus at 9:45 in the morning.  My boyfriend went up and got us breakfast menus and she looked at him like it was an inconvenience for him to come up to her.  The waiter took forever to get to our table and wasn't very on top of his game.  Our food took forever to come out.  At least the waiter told us that and suggested that we go to the buffet and get a muffin or something.  He said the kitchen was backed up.  I'm not quite sure how that could happen since there were only 6 tables in the whole place.  But whatever, the service could have most certainly been better. Next, let's discuss the food.  It was average at best.  Once we finally got our food, my plate was super hot.  The only reason my plate was as hot as it was because it sat under the heat lamp waiting for my boyfriends food to finish.  I knew this because 1) I worked in restaurants for 6 years and 2) the hollandise sauce was the same consistency when you let cheese sit and you need to stir it again.  I was pretty disappointed, but it had taken so long to get it I didn't want to send it back.  Well that and the eggs were not poached correctly.  It was awful.  The only good thing I can say about the food was that because our food was taking so long and the waiter suggested we go back to the buffet, they had fruit and nutella, now that was cool. Finally, let's talk about the atmosphere.  Okay we're at a nice, expensive place, I would expect it to be clean.  There were so many spots on the glasses I was in shock.  I mean sure you can have one or two, but there were so many that some of the glasses looked foggy.  There is no way that the staff didn't see that.  Plus the silverware was so bizarre, it was super long as, but whatever I'm sure it's because Aria is supposed to be trendy.  But the part that really got me beyond the ridiculously long silverware and the spots all over the glasses was the dust on counter that I know during the evening houses the bread and wine glasses and water.  There was so much dust that I could see it in the light.  Clean your place Aria, you should know better.

2008-02-24,4.0,"Two friends and I lunched at Aria on our first restaurant stop during Chicago's Restaurant Week. For $21.95, we were treated to a delicious three course meal. I was a tad disappointed that Aria didn't give us any options on the Restaurant Week menu, but thankfully the three dishes were all very good.  We had Mushroom Soup Your Mother Never Made for our first course (yes, that's the real name). My friends enjoyed the soup very much - they finished their bowls - but as someone who normally doesn't tolerate mushrooms, I was only able to eat half. It was creamy and the mushrooms were finely processed. I loved the goat cheese toast that came with the soup. Our main dish was the Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai. The pad thai was yummy - the noodles weren't clumpy and the peanut sauce wasn't overbearing. I appreciated that I didn't get the greasy feeling after I finished. For my favorite course - dessert! - we had four sorbets - mango, pineapple, blueberry and passionfruit. The sorbets were nothing to really write about. It tasted like any sorbet you could pick up at the grocery store. What I did love was the orange-rind waffle cones that were served with the sorbets. I could have eaten all of them, but I didn't have any more room in my belly. Plus my black shirt made it difficult to eat them without making a powdered sugar mess! For $21.95, the meal was a deal. I'm sure they shrank the portions, but I definitely feel I got my money's worth. Only tiny complaint was related to the service. Our waiter didn't refill my water glass nearly enough. Plus it took the valet about 15 minutes to get our car.  I had a great time eating at Aria and catching up with good friends. Decor, ambiance and food were above par. They even played some solid R&B/hip hop music. I'd definitely like to come back one night to check out the bar/lounge.",0.9968,0.744,0.213,0.043,0.5263817663817664

And I have to say that everything great that I have heard about this place is not enough to do justice. The decor is absolutely amazing and beautiful. The wait staff was one of the best that I have ever encountered, better than Signature Room (who, in my opinion, have one of the best around).  They started us off with naan, so being Indian,  we loved having this traditional dish. They had an excellent wine list. My problem is that  there are very few places that I actually enjoy because the food is usually bland. But it was the food that completely blew me away, every morsel that I tasted had so much flavor and on top of the great food, the chef kept sending over small dishes to dine on that weren't part of our order.  Overall, this had been one of my absolute best experiences at any restaurant and I would recommend this to anyone celebrating a special night.

The flatbread to start came with four spreads: cashew, lentil, spinach, and yogurt with cardamom. We followed with organic salads which were good enough and then I had a garbanzo-dusted Scottish salmon with an olive tapenade and a hummus sauce. Never seen something like that listed on a menu. It was cooked perfectly. My wife had the Argentinian steak and the fries were gluttonously good. So why not five stars? The place just didn't energize me. It was very nice looking and the staff was polite, even if they were overly stiff. It's sort of like the Fairmont Hotel (where this is located) tried desperately to create a hip, young restaurant and instead ended up with a stuffy fancy-hotel spot that happens to have cooler decor.

We've only ever eaten at the sushi bar, and every time we go we polish off a couple bowls of the very addictive snack mix they bring you. I like the sushi bar, it's plush and has a nice atmosphere. Though we've never eaten at the actual restaurant, we have sampled one of their appetizers, the hot and sour baked rock shrimp -- and let me tell you, you have GOT to try it.

As my date and I were still in the slightly nervous, getting-to-know-you stage, our server was instrumental in creating an atmosphere that was romantic and memorable, while being uncliched, non-pressuring, and still laid-back.  I had the cod, which was very good.
