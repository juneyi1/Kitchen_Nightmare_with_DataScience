With that said, I can't really complain about Rockstar Dogs.  It's a block away from all the bars/clubs in the Noble Square vicinity and open late on the weekends, and their tolerance for the drunken crowd is above and beyond graciousness.  I wandered in close to 2 am on a snowy cold day and sloppily ordered some fries, paid $2, and, within seconds, received a huge bag hot crispy fries, fresh off the deep-fryer.  Tasted wonderful given the circumstances of my visit - an escape from a blizzard-stricken night and too many High Life's.   I don't think this place is that expensive - let's not forget that the $6-8 price tag for hot dog, fries and drink also includes the heinous Chicago tax rate.  Yes, more expensive than Hot Doug's, but you can get drunk service, and you don't have to wait 30 minutes in the cold for it.

I was excited to see the names they gave their hot dogs, but I was pretty disappointed. They were really lame. Totally basic names. The Led Zeppelin. The Ramone. The only clever one was the Justin Timberlake dog because it was covered in cheese. While discussing the crappiness of the names with the guy that worked there, I managed to come up with some good ones of my own. My personal favorite was The Minor Threat, which I decided could not be accompanied by a Coke. (Get it?) At any rate, the guy was cool and was wearing a Damned t-shirt, so I had didn't give him too much trouble. I decided on the Ramone, which is simply a hot dog with a normal yellow mustard, a duesselldorf mustard, and sauerkraut. It was fantastic. Every dog comes with fries, and the fries were seriously some of the best I have ever had. After everyone got their food, we went and sat at the outdoor seating and pretty much shared everything. Everybody loved what they got and said they would be back. We also made tons of friends as the masses passed us as they left Pitchfork. I will certainly be back to this place. The food was delicious. I know some people are all pissed at the theme, but give it up. Everything is themed in one way or another. Do you think if you go and eat at Chili's that you are really south-of-the-border?

2008-04-16,3.0,"Way too expensive, I will stick to Costco's $1.50 dog & coke. Stripper pole is a waste of space however it is what made me want to go there, so I guess it pays off for them. Lots of variations on the dogs but they should let you add a dog for a cheaper price. Also Justin Timberlake is not a Rock star, maybe a pop star but since they named the cheesy dog after him I understand the concept! The Los Lobos was good, bacon wrapped with jalapenos and onions, but once again about $3 too much. Very small place, they should have window service.",0.5255,0.929,0.052,0.019,0.564
2008-04-11,1.0,"i really wanted to like this place but couldn't. crappiest fries ever. said fries come with your $7 (!!) hot dog, stupid little pastry-type box to transport the dog, fries and can of cold soda in so that conveniently when you arrive to your car/home/etc. everything is at same temp, lukewarm. yum. hot dog bun is the cheapest soggiest thing ever. to top it all off, it took 15 minutes after ordering to get these 2 crap hot dogs. the place is tiny, so you pretty much are smashed against the stripper pole or the wall covered with pictures of washed up rockers. this place is a mid life crisis incarnated into a restaurant. never again. hot doug's can and will NEVER be in competition with business owners who just don't care, or aren't smart enough to figure out the details.",-0.9295,0.815,0.056,0.13,0.6098739495798319

2008-03-21,3.0,"Here's the deal.  I was ready to hate this place.  I was sitting at the Chipp and heard the guys at the bars read the article in the Sun Times.  ""$7.00 for a f'ing hot dog,"" they cried, ""You have to be f'ing kidding me!""  I had to agree.  Using a Benz to deliver food (albeit with diesel-fed chip oil) - a bit too rich for the 'hood at this time, I'm afraid.  And then you take the fact that I have not once, but twice, attempted to drunkenly go there only to see that they were awaiting their food license.  Bad marketing, honey. Then it opened.  And there are still come bumps.  No delivery yet.  The guy kept calling me 'bra' or 'bro.'  He didn't stand on my (and I think the neighborhood's) side regarding neighborhood 'redevelopment' (okay, I can forgive him for that, but I do fear the glut of empty luxury condos blocking my view).  He called and said I needed to bring exact change because they didn't have their change yet.  You've got to be f'ing kidding me. Here's the deal.  All hot dogs are $6 or $7.  Instead of just getting the dog, though, you get a neat little box with your chips (fries) and soda along with your dog.  They don't use polystyrene cups like every place in the universe.  And the chips are reasonably good - once they were a bit soggy, but the other time, perfection in a fried potato.  I will sort of gripe that they don't grill their dogs but boil them (I think), but it was still a good dog.  They are on the correct side of the Ketchup on a Hot Dog argument. I'm going to give them a few more weeks to get a bit better.  They're a definite addition to the Chicago/Ashland corner.  I'm so happy it wasn't another discount shoe store or dollar store or what have you (not that you could do it in that space, you know what I mean).",0.9666,0.81,0.124,0.067,0.6308712121212121

2008-03-16,2.0,"Now there's a lot of places in Chicago to get a good dog. This is definitely not on the top of my list.  Let me start off by saying this place is loaded w/ potential. I like the rock-themed menu and decor (although not too original...hello kuma's corner) and I think the stripper pole awkwardly placed in the front is pretty funny.  However. Fries had good seasoning but were more soggy and limp than a...ugh well let's just leave it at that. They offer tots as a side. Sweet! No wait. More like WAAAAAY too salty. And usually I love salty stuff but these were way over the edge. I could almost feel my left arm start to tingle after one of em. Soggy too! I thought this place was going to be more along the lines of Hot Doug's, offering different and sometimes exotic encased meats. It's mostly different toppings on your standard dogs. I got the ""White Stripe"" which was a brat w/ mustard and onions. It was ok. Edible at least, unlike the fries and tots, but nothing to yelp about. I believe it was the owner who rang me up when I was there. He seemed friendly but left me waiting a smidge too long while he was on the phone to take my order. Not cool. I also felt like I had to wait a smidge too long for my brat to finish. He probably sensed this because I was reassured that it was coming shortly and that the brats sometimes take a little longer. Or maybe I'm just a smidge too impatient. I'll take Hot Doug's (even with all the effort) or even Al's Beef over this place. But I gave it two stars cause it's new and maybe they just need to iron the kinks out. Plus I loved the fact they included a guitar pick with my order...perfect to scrape the mustard crust off my jeans because I didn't get any napkins! 42/52",0.9908,0.829,0.142,0.028,0.5633689839572192
2008-03-16,2.0,"I am excited to see new additions to the neighborhood, and Rockstar dogs certainly does a lot to make the Ashland/Chicago corner look better. But as far as actually adding to the neighborhood....eh, I'm not sure how I feel about this place.  The decor is great, it's nice to see the rundown corner building given a new coat of paint and a fancy neon sign. But $6 for a hot dog & some fries with a fancy name....not so great. There is only one dog that departs from the norm (Los Lobos), the rest are just standard variations (cheese dog, chili cheese dog, tofu dog) with pretentious names.  If it's 4AM and you need something to soak up the alcohol you just consumed at Relax or 5 Star and/or you feel like taking a spin around the stripper pole, go for it. But if you just want a good chicago-style hot dog and it's daylight hours, go down the street to Chicago Carry Outs (Chicago & Wood) and get yourself a cheaper and tastier dog.  Don't get me wrong--I don't think Rockstar is all bad--the owners are very friendly and the place is super-cute. I also think it's good for new businesses to move in the neighborhood, just less good if they sell basic products for high prices. I hope this isn't a sign of where the neighborhood is headed. I like the small shops with good prices, and hope that's how things stay. Unlikely I know, but a girl's gotta have hope.",0.9783,0.849,0.145,0.006,0.5730181921253349
2008-03-16,4.0,"Update: So I wanted hotdogs for my meal of the day and went back due to the fact that it's super close.  I got the flaming lip again since I wanted spicy stuff. Oh yeah they got it right this time! The hot stuff was yummy gardiniera! Totally spiced up the whole thing! The owner was there so maybe that what did it.  The fries seemed different . not as soggy, saltier and with some skin on.  Really good. I also got hashbrowns, Well they are hashbrowns. I know when I'm drunk, there is something about hashbrowns that makes you feel better.  So yey! Totally improved experience! Yey overpriced food.  So why all the stars? I like places that are open late. Especially in this neighborhood it would be nice to have more places that don't close at 5pm. Then more places will be tempted to stay open later!  ;) I got The flaming lip. But there was nothing flaming about it. Dog with cheese. The hotdog had a nice smokey flavor to it but nothing super amazing about it.  I liked the cute box you get your food in. But putting it into the paper bag i got was a waste since I removed it from the paper bag while ripping it.  Fries were ok.  So yey the cute box. Yey smokey, yet not too impressive hot dog. Yey ambiance/stripper pole. Yey late hours. The person behind the counter was totally nice and so were the cooks in the back. It looks like a fun place to go to get some food after drinking too much.  I agree about buying 2 hotdogs though.  And didn't realize they had hashbrowns!",0.9896,0.777,0.18,0.042,0.6228120978120979

I only ate the tofu dog, and it just wasnt good.  the bun was kind of soggy, the tomatoes were large and overripe, the pickle was bland.  just not good in my book. Also you can only get a meal for $6, no option to just buy the hot dog on its own, so if you want to get two hot dogs, you are stuck buying twice the amount of fries and drink, and its another $6, which is just a bit excessive - but he did mention that they are changing that.   i know this place is just opened, so i may venture back in a bit and give it another try since its in my neighborhood, but for now id say: just stick with hot dougs.",0.7924,0.89,0.08,0.029,0.7550865800865801
2008-03-14,3.0,"**UPDATE** I convinced my boyfriend to return to Rockstar Dogs after our ill-fated first visit (see  below/original review).   The menu was brief, and everything was named after rock stars/bands (a less-metal version of Kuma's).  I was expecting something a little more...I don't know...""exotic"" but it was pretty standard fare.  There was, however, a daily special called the Richie Sambora - Italian sausage covered with roasted red peppers and goat cheese.  Mmm!   We both got that.  For $7 it included some damn good crinkle fries and a can of Dr. Pepper.  I was so delighted to find a little ""prize"" inside - a hot dog charm in my boyfriend's box and a RSD logo button in mine.  Sweet.   Service was quick and just friendly enough. (we were there around 8PM so it wasn't exactly crowded).  Got home and enjoyed our quickie dinner.  The sausage was kind of ""eh"" but anything with roasted red peppers and goat cheese is good.  I dug the fries but the boyfriend thought they were too salty.   I completely understand all of the parallels between Rockstar and Hot Doug's, but unfortunately for me, RS is open past 4PM whereas HD's is not.   And on a completely unrelated note - why a stripper pole?  Really.  Is it there in case you didn't get your stripper pole fix down the street at Five Star? I'll check out Rockstar Dogs again, but only when I can't get my Hot Doug's fix. ***********************************************  I was SOOO excited to hear there was a new late-night hot dog joint near my place and even happier to hear that it was a bit ""fancier"" than say, Underdogg.   I read articles online and even browsed the menu before deciding to go for a late dinner before hittin' the bar with my boyfriend.  Driving down Ashland you can see the lovely neon sign glowing from blocks away.  We parked, crossed the street and see a typed sign: ""We are awaiting our license.""     WHAAAA?? I thought this place opened on Monday the 10th?   Don't get me wrong, I'll try this place again (and edit my rating accordingly).  But I simply cannot understand how a place can open for business one day and three days later not be open due to license issues.   I was super disappointed.   We ended up driving through Burger King instead.",0.9949,0.819,0.15,0.032,0.5181089165464166
