2009-10-03,4.0,"Republic Pan Asia is also managed and owned by the owners of Rise on Southport. I like Republic for a number of reasons.  To begin with, the atmosphere at this place is great for going on a date. The outdoor seating blends in well with downtown Chicago's electric nightlife. The staff is friendly, and very knowledgeable about their Pan Asian dishes. If you are shopping on Michigan Ave, and looking for a unique place to eat, Republic is a really good choice.  I'm also impressed by the vast selection, and unique combination of Asian inspired food. They serve fresh sushi, as well as special Thai and Chinese dishes. My favorite is their lobster Bisque soup.  If you are going on a date, or just partying with friends, ask for a seat on the second floor near the window. Ontario street is bustling with action and the tables on the second floor ensure you won't miss a thing.  Another quality I like about Republic is the decorations and architecture. The dining room downstairs is a little more decorated with modern art. However; upstairs is the place is where I like to be. The large dining room has light wooden floors, with very little art work on the walls. Your eye's attention is centered on the main windows over looking the city. If you are looking for a little romance, or even just a place to take friends, I would check this place out.  The restaurant can be a wee-bit expensive, but you I think the prices are compatible with most downtown spots.",0.9749,0.859,0.141,0.0,0.4770114942528736

The decor is cute and modern (not cheesy asian with a bunch of red ornaments with chinese characters on it. i hate those!), and they had great music.

The highlights of our meal (consisting entirely of miso, seaweed salad, and sushi -- the basics) was the soy sauce mixed with sake, which is delicious, and their very aesthetic choice of sushi wrappings. They often use colored soy paper instead of nori, so the color of sushi wrappings essentially involves every color imaginable. My Sa-B roll, which was tempura salmon and jalapeno etc. and delicious even though it tasted like a tortilla, was neon lime green on the outside! FUN! The only reason I give it four instead of five stars is because aside from some signature makis, this place is a bit pricy for regular ol' sushi and sushi dishes. One would imagine a classy place like this could splurge and make their own tamago, for instance, instead of using the regular old comes-in-an-eggy-loaf kind, or that they would serve real seaweed salad that wasn't dyed (even whole foods serves that). Kudos on using real wooden re-usable chopsticks and having delicious sake though -- it was melt-in-your-mouth salmon.",0.9927,0.786,0.201,0.013,0.476810989010989

One of my companions got the pad thai and it was really good.  I believe you can judge all Thai cuisine based on the caliber of their pad thai.  This one was exceptionally fresh and none of the important ingredients (kafir lime leaves, cilantro, chili) were skimped on.  The chicken was good n' moist too.  It's pretty expensive for lunch, but I'm betting if you're feeling swanky or going for dinner it's worth it.  You do get what you pay for after all.",0.9823,0.811,0.172,0.017,0.666845238095238

Bonjour, it's our Friday night, too. The food was good overall, but when we tried to get the check, someone had to get up out of their seat to get it as she wouldn't even come to us. Our drinks weren't comped (as promised) so she had to go back and get that taken care of. Gratuity was included despite the fact that we were five people instead of the required six for gratuity included.

Did I mention it was my birthday? Alas we were in the mood for a long evening at Republic and gradually ordered drinks and appetizers once seated up stairs.   At 8:55 PM, the manager sauntered over to our table to inform us that at 10 pm we needed to be ""OUT"" due to a private party they were having up stairs. She went on to inform us that two hours should be enough time for dinner and asked that we order in the next five minutes.  WHAT????? Seriously????  We weren't sure what to think of this. I blame it on the area and how painfully rude and thoughtless servers can be in that area. But this is the manager representing their restaurant. You're shaking your head asking, ""so what's with the two stars"". Well the meal that was rushed out to us and practically thrown down our throats was very good.

We were greeted right away, told the specials, and our drink order was taken. Drinks came out fairly quickly and our food order was taken. From there it went downhill. As the restaurant got busier our server got more and more flustered and it seemed like he wasn't all that experienced on the computer so it would take him forever to put in an order.

Two separate times, folks were practically knocking each other out just to get a piece of food. They would bring out one tiny tray for 100 people. It was literally gone within the minute. Luckily Quartino is just down the street and we satisfied our hunger there later. I finally decided to give it another chance about one month ago. We went for dinner and had a wonderful time. The food was great. We had the sendai beef (unbelievable), mini chicken rolls (tasty), and one of the noodle dishes (ok). The real highlight of the night was the service though. It was seamless. Everything arrived at the just the right time, our drinks were never empty, the waitress was pleasant, and I noticed the manager adjusting the curtains at just the right time to create ambiance. Impressive! My last visit was just the opposite. It started off with the $11 martini at the bar which did not even come close to reaching the top of the glass. Then we get to our table and it went downhill. The waitress was just plain poor. Each time we ordered a drink we waited 15 minutes or more to receive it. I get CRABBY when I get thirsty! Then in the middle of our miso soup, she interrupts us to take our order. She was abrupt and mumbling in her service approach. We sat with a pile of dirty plates as she walked past us numerous times. She finally peeped her head around the corner and asked if she could bring us the check. She never asked if we wanted dessert or an after dinner drink. We did.  It's a shame.

At 7pm on a Saturday evening it was fairly quiet, the service was fine, nothing amazing but nothing to complain about either.  The menu is pretty good, a lot of small plate appetizers to choose from, and a very large sushi menu. They also do pretty good noodle dishes. We ordered two appetizers, a salad and two noodle dishes. It was a little too much food for us! But it was all very delicious.  We'd definitely go there again, I guess the 1 missing star is because it doesn't have a cocktail menu but this is a restaurant rather than a bar.

So she'd always ask how we'd like it and I'd be like ""it's pretty good!"" when in actuality I wasn't very impressed and gave them 3 stars on yelp.  One day we were in the car driving somewhere and we were debating where to go for breakfast the next day and one place was mentioned... ""I dunno... when you can't get omelettes and pancakes right, you might as well hit up an IHOP... OOOH!"" ... a quote from a not-so-positive review... subsequent words after that were words such as ""liar"" and ""betrayed.""  We went to Republic that evening... .... and I've been afraid of reviewing this place since. In all honesty, there is no reason to order something like pad thai at a fancy looking Asian place.  Unless you hear that it is the absolute best ever, stay away from stuff that you already enjoy at a far cheaper place.  If you're going to a place like this, get something that at least sounds fancy, like the pan seared scallops or carpaccio.   With that said, the food was solid and the service was great that day.  The most memorable thing there was actually this roll that had cilantro in it.  (rainbow roll?  o_O)  I think it's pretty pricey for what they give, but it still warrants a recommendation.

2007-06-21,2.0,"""Eh"" is all I can say about this place.  Had dinner here last night and the place is still on not its game from a service standpoint and there are better places for Pan Asian food. The best things about the night- the appetizers and the rolls were good.   The lettuce wraps were quite tasty.  Try the tuna tartare served with little crisps, very good.  The spicy tuna roll was also good (maybe I should have stuck with tuna for my entrees!) Since I was with a couple of other people we ordered 4 entrees to split so that we could taste a variety of the menu.  I really wasn't thrilled with any of them.  The Kobe beef shoulder, while done perfectly, came with a ginger sauce that was over bearing.  The hot pot with beef (really spicy!) was okay but the peppers in it over took any other flavors.  The noodle dish (kudon?) also was overwhelmingly saucy and only had a couple of shrimp in it.  The best thing?  The Kobe beef steak served with sweet potatoes but I could get that at a steak house. The wine list also needs some work.  There was nothing really interesting on the list and the bottle we ordered really wasn't that good. Service was mediocre at best.  My drinks came twice without lime and the coffee was lukewarm.  In fact, when we ordered coffee, the waiter told us that the machine was not on (it had just been installed) and he wasn't sure he could make coffee.  Here's to tell you- you can't.   I don't know if they were short servers, or what, but the bartender was clearing tables, people I never saw before were bringing our food and the person I thought was our waiter was MIA most of the night. My advice- if you go- go for a cocktail in their very nice lounge area and order a couple of their appetizers.  Maybe that way you won't be disappointed!",0.9841,0.838,0.121,0.04,0.5463082437275987

He repeatedly called the female members of our party ""my darling"" and intoned that he just wanted to make us happy. Attentive = good; Stalkeresque = bad. Also, our lunch took over 3 hours. The decor is ok, but seems a bit too zen/spa-like for a trendy restaurant. The first floor is also VERY sparse - seemed like there should have been more tables (not that I mind the uncrowdedness).  I should note that I am, in general, wary of restaurants purporting to excel at multiple types of asian food (i.e. one stop Thai/Sushi), and am not a huge fan of the owners' other outposts (Shine/Morida, Jia's).

2007-06-02,1.0,"Not a great place Here's a review of our first and only visit to the Republic. I will just list my impressions in order 1: We had to confirm our 7:30 reservation on Saturday Night but the place was half full at most - why the pretentious attitude? 2: We purchased a bottle of Cloudy Bay wine - highly recommended by our waiter. It had a screw top. When he went to open it, he was surprised himself. In an attempt to cover his amazement he claimed ""most wines are going with the screw top now."" We found this odd as the Trader Joe's next door still carries two-buck-chuck with a real cork.  3. Our appetizer consisted of two of their signature sushi rolls. Mine had a large, gray hair protruding from the side. 4. In an attempt to wash down the piece that I had already started to chew, I grabbed my water glass. There was some black, gummy residue on the rim of the glass. It looked like someone had peeled off a sticker and then washed the glass. How many more things could go wrong here? We cut our losses, paid our bill and left without delay. After our complaint to the manager, or waiter offered no further apology and did not stop back by our table as we attempted to finish our wine. Bad experience, we would not ever go back despite the manager promising to ""take care of us"" if we returned. I wonder what he meant by that.",-0.2071,0.778,0.114,0.107,0.4450848385331144

2007-05-07,4.0,"At the suggestion of Yelper Andrea W., I waited a little while for the restaurant to work out their kinks before coming to Republic.  For a new restaurant, I had a very nice dinner, although I did come on a slow weeknight. The whole place has an Asian zen, feng shui vibe to it.  The high ceilings make the place seem huge.  The ground floor bar is huge and in the center of the place -- I think people will find this place to be a good happy hour venue.  This restaurant leases space from a hotel, so don't be surprised if you see tourists or business folks hanging around here. I sat on the ground floor and noticed that there is plenty of space for huge groups, and one was seated next to my table.  There was a huge plasma screen on the wall above the bar that was showing ""Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon,"" which is good if you're stuck at the bar waiting for your friends to arrive. The food was pretty good; I am a fan of Jia's, Shine and Rise so they didn't disappoint in the sushi category.  I enjoyed the sushi (I don't remember the name of the roll I ate), crab rangoon, and the pad thai.  The menu boasts an array of Japanese, Chinese, and Thai food, just like Rise/Shine.   My server gave me a tour of the restaurant, which I thought was really considerate.  I thought the upstairs looks like a great eating area, and I saw the smaller rooms where you could hold private parties.  The restaurant is quite big, and there is a cute little bar upstairs for the private parties.  I think you can rent out the entire 2nd floor, for a big reception or dinner party.  My server was very attentive and responsive, and we never felt rushed nor did we feel like we were waiting for him.  Overall, it was a pleasant dining experience, and I'd definitely return to try other menu items and to sit upstairs.  Of course, I was there on a slow night, so I'd like to see how they handle a busy crowd on a weekend night.  Since I work nearby, I am also thinking about trying them out for lunch as well.  I'll re-post if I do.",0.9968,0.796,0.194,0.01,0.4974891774891774

At first glance, after being seated upstairs, it almost felt like the place didn't know what to do with all the massive room... but it was very trendy and cool inside. As far as my dining experience... that's another story! Our waiter was just off his game, and it was one bad thing after the next. My friend ordered a soda, which never came and she had to remind several different staff members. Ten different waiters and managers were bringing food to our table, and I got the feeling that I waiter was afraid of all our complaints. My friend ordered Miso soup, after asking about any peanut ingredients due to a food allergy. She never got her soup, so we complained the waitrer, who then told us the chef said he would not bring out the soup. My friend literally had to demand the waiter to get her soup. This was turning into a scene out of Seinfeld- NO SOUP FOR YOU! We were also told that the traditional maki rolls came as an order of 8, but when they were brought out, we discovered it was only 6. After all of this, my friend orders some hot tea-- the tea kettle was completely leaking all over the table, on the floor and down to the people eating across from us. At this point, it was just embarassing. And I won't even start on the fact that they didn't have packets of sugar- only granulated brown sugar. The waiter picked up on our frustration and brought a round of comp martinis for us. But once the bill came and we had complained to about 6 different managers, we found that many items were not comped, which we then had to get the manager to adjust our bill. I will say one of the female managers offered her apologies and acted extremely professional, in the hopes that we would come back. But after 2+ hours, we just wanted to get out of there! I liked the different japanese entree selections in addition to the sushi rolls on the broad menu, but this place needs to get their act together. It's like every waiter seemed to play dumb.

Service was incredibly slow, but I'm hoping it will get better with time. ____________________________________________________ Whoo hoo- first to review! Not to be confused with the cheesy sounding club on Fremont named Republic....the forces behind Rise and Shine recently opened this Pan Asian restaurant in River North.  I""m a little disappointed that they didn't name this restaurant to go along with the Rise & Shine theme, but I guess Republic sounds slightly cooler than Goodnight or anything else I can think of.   I thought the swanky atmosphere was cool-  not exactly a warm, cozy environment, but it was exactly what I expected from a restaurant connected to a hotel (The Four Points by Sheraton). The menu was very similar to Shine's menu and although the Chinese food looked tempting I was (as always) all about the sushi.  I was thrilled to see my favorite Shine roll, the honey roll, on the menu with a few other interesting specialties.  Everything was delicious! 4 of us enjoyed the sushi, which wasn't an option for the 1 pregnant member of our party who was happy with the pad thai she ordered. So why 3 stars for a cool atmosphere and excellent food? The service was AWFUL!  I tried to give them the benefit of the doubt since they only opened their doors a week ago, but it was hard to ignore bad service after they made us wait at the bar for our table when the restaurant was empty, messed up our entire order multiple times, didn't ask us if we wanted dessert when they knew we were there to celebrate a birthday, and so on.  Our flaky waitress was nice enough and very apologetic for all the messups, but it was a laughable matter by the end of the night. My personal favorite part of the evening was when she pointed to a salmon roll and told us it was a tuna roll...if you're going to work at a sushi restaurant you may want to learn your fish!
