2014-09-25,4.0,"My roommate and I decided to try 2 Sparrows for Sunday brunch a couple of weeks ago. Have got to say I am still basking in the afterglow. We only had to wait a short while before we were seated, but the service was a little disappointing. I asked our server about some of the dishes, and my initial indecision seemed to cause her some anxiety. So the absence of a fifth star in my rating was mainly due to her lack of assertion. My roommate and I ordered the strawberry rhubarb french toast and the chilaquiles respectively, in addition to the orange marmalade pop tart and a cinnamon roll to share. First of all, the cinnamon roll was absolutely sensational-- sweet and laced in tang from the goat cheese icing. The pop tart was also very good, though I wasn't as partial to the slightly bitter and pervasive citrus flavor as I thought I would be. While we waited for our main entrees, both the manager and the owner (who was equipped with a dustpan and broom I might add) greeted us. I was immediately impressed by their demeanors, and when they informed me that all of their ingredients were from local farms, it certainly appealed to my love of the bougie and bucolic. But now the ENTREES. My roommate's french toast was gorgeous and ample-- strawberry rhubarb jam over brioche capped by a dainty dollop of chantilly cream and almond slices. I had the most massive chilaquiles (a pair of eggs, tortilla chips in a tomatillo salsa with melted cheese, aioli and black beans. As someone who has been told to ""eat like a Polish truck driver"", I was surprised at my only being able to consume half of this gorgeous monstrosity.

My sister and I were seated promptly. The ambiance was pretty inviting with an open and modern space. We waited quite awhile for our server to come. Luckily, a busboy had already filled our waters. I even noticed that a table seated after us was taken care of before we were. I actually saw another waitress glance over at us while we were just sitting there with our menus closed and told our waitress that we needed to be taken care of. She finally comes over and takes our order. While friendly, she didn't really check up on us. Our food also took a tad long to come out. Also, I felt a drop of water come down on my shoulder and noticed that water was dripping from the vent above me. I didn't asked to be moved as it wasn't constant, but that is something they should already be monitoring. Also, it was awkward to see a waitress in training, as she shadowed another waitress around like a puppy dog.  I had the brisket hash while my sister had the veggie quiche. To my disappointment and surprise, my hash was one of the most bland things I have ever had...and I usually think a pinch of salt is too much. I don't understand how the braised brisket had zero flavor. I even cracked a bunch of fresh pepper on there, and it was still lacking in flavor. The only flavor it did have was the pickled veggies and it contrasted the dish in a bad way. Also, they left in some fatty bits, so it was hard to chew as it was unappetizing. They also did not know how to cook the egg, as the whole thing was nearly well done and the yolk was not oozing at all. My sister's quiche, along with another's that I saw was burnt, like overly burnt on its crust. She also did not find the inside to be all that good or flavorful. Mediocre at best. The only good thing was her tangerine ginger tea, in which it came out in the whole pot and not just a cup, which was nice. Took another while for our waitress to come by to get our check, as I noticed was the same for the table next to ours, as they seemed annoyed as well. Slightly less than 'fine' food and service.

It seemed like a nice trendy place and when I looked at the menu, I could tell exactly what type of restaurant it was. One of those ones that has unique menu items and tried to cater toward a younger crowd.  We had a large group of 7 so we opted to split the group and sit at two different tables. My tables waiter was Aaron and be was one of the worst servers I've ever dealt with. He didn't greet us with his name, didn't introduce the restaurant or anything, clicked his pen when I was indecisive on what I wanted, and the list can go on but I will get to that in a little bit.  We finally order and I got the regular eggs Benedict while everyone with me got the blue crab special Benedict, a chicken sandwich, and a Mac and cheese dish with two sides of tater tots. After 20+ min of waiting for our food, I call Aaron over (which I didn't know his name until I looked on our check) and asked how much longer it would be. He replied 'idk'. What...? Like at least tell me that you will check with the kitchen or something! He then told me that there was two orders ahead of mine. That doesn't mean anything...a kitchen doesn't make a single tables food and then move onto the next. That doesn't even make sense.  When he was finally starting to bring the food out, he gave everyone the wrong food. The Benedict was alright, regardless if there was barely any hollandaise and it didn't taste like hollandaise...I almost sent my food back but we didn't have time and he probably wouldn't have been understanding about it.  The tater tot side is a joke, they are $4 and you literally get 4 tots that are not even really big and they come with a house ketchup but Aaron didn't even offer conventional ketchup when my friend asked for it.  He never came and checked back to ask how everything was and he wasn't friendly at all. I've had some bad servers but never one like Aaron. And that says something.

Speaking of fillings, there was very little veggie content to speak of. Fiancé ordered the traditional breakfast plate (bacon, eggs, and toast).

Teach your servers and staff to always be on the lookout for patron's needs, and how to manage multiple tasks more efficiently.

I got the Old School breakfast - eggs were good, bacon was crispy and warm, english muffin was so-so (a little soggy by the time it got to me).  My mom ordered the Benedict, and although she didn't have any rave reviews about it, she must have liked it because it was gone before I could get a bite.  The star of the meal was my aunt's dish, the Shrimp and Grits.  This grits were so creamy, the shrimp perfectly cooked, and the collard greens with the sauce brought the dish together in a perfect meld.  The sauce had a little spice which paired well with the creaminess of the grits.  I would highly recommend this, and will definitely order this if I go back to 2 Sparrows.   Overall, some hits, some misses.  The restaurant does have an interesting cocktail menu though, so I may go back to try that out.",0.993,0.817,0.167,0.015,0.44887096774193547

2014-05-04,1.0,"I've been wanting to try this place for awhile. I finally had the opportunity. They don't take reservations which is understandable but there was 6 of us, so I knew it was going to be a wait. The wait wasn't too bad considering, but that's because we had to crowd around a small table. The waitress was by far the worst part of this whole experience. She came by, got our drink orders, 3 waters, 2 coffees and 1 tea. She forgot the tea. Not a big deal. Everyone makes mistakes. Finally comes back with the tea. At that point my friend wanted a beer and asks what lager she recommends, she says they're all good, and then he asks, ok, which ones are the lagers, and she comes back with a ""I don't know"". She gets our food orders, walks away and never comes back. Seriously. We never got a refill on our waters, coffees or teas. A runner comes out with our food and my eggs are very over done. I wait for awhile for the waitress to come back and check on things, but she never comes. Finally, I flag down a bus boy and ask him for new eggs. He comes back less than five minutes later with another batch of over cooked eggs. At that point, I was too hungry to wait so I ate my steak and eggs without the eggs, so just steak. The steak was cooked nicely but the fries were soggy. My friends who ordered the chilaquiles were both disappointed. They said they were missing salsa, which is kind of an important ingredient. My other friend ordered the pork belly and was not impressed. Someone did order a special, which was a biscuit sandwich and she really liked it and I got the bacon donut on the side which was great. Once we were finished and our plates were cleared, our waitress miraculously appears and makes sure we pay the check. Never asked how the food was or if we needed anything else. We paid (no tip of course) and got out as fast as possible. It was awful. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.",0.9757,0.796,0.135,0.069,0.5591319945486614

Sad I couldn't get my omelette fix, I ordered the two eggs and toast minus the bacon/sausage with fruit. The dish came out and the eggs looked pitiful - loosely scrambled and way smaller than the traditional two eggs at most places I've been. The toast was thin and brittle and the fruit - a bland combination of grapes, apples and bananas which felt like a pre-school snack. Done with the meal, I passed this place off as trying to be high brow with complex menu offerings with no cooking skills to back it up. Even worse, when we got the bill, they charged me $8 for my cappucino! I go to the Starbucks down the street often and pay half that price for the same exact thing! I was shocked and asked for an explanation and they said they charge $3 for an extra shot. At $8 it nearly amounted to our dishes of $10 and $12.

Saturday mornings are devoted to waking up semi-early for brunch to start your weekend right. 2 Sparrows did the opposite.

My brunch buddy ordered the daily quiche that came with a fresh garden salad, and I had the biscuits and gravy. We sampled each other's plates and both agreed that the food was a bit lackluster all around. I did not understand why they plated the biscuit and gravy in a bowl with the green salad because the greens were mixing in with the gravy and it looked totally wrong.

2013-10-07,3.0,"Only speaking of the brunch experience, I guess this is all my fault. Why brunch?  I can cook an egg, I can do lots of stuff, but nope.  I keep cramming my self loathing ass into restaurants full of hungover servers and bitter cooks forced to work the restaurant equivalent of the USPS Christmas rush. I don't even share most of my disappointments, some say the restaurants are not that bad, it is just that I am an asshole.  This may be partially true, but I feel, like I feel. The ""Pop Tart"" with mushrooms and goat cheese, come on really.  All you have to do is cook some minced mushrooms til dry, and fold in some goat cheese, then wrap it between some pre-made puff pastry, easy right?  Oh by the way, heat it up next time, cold mushroom duxelle not so tasty. Poached egg?  Sure, but I would rather you ask what kind of egg before you scurry away.  No thanks, golf balls are not my style, can I get another egg.  The table next to us amusingly ate the white around the green bulbous yolk with out skipping a beat.  I imagined a pot of simmering water filled to the rim with rock hard unborn chickens bobbing around while some yearling cook drooled over the pot gauging how many people will dare send the egg back in some calculated risk game. Lamb sausage gravy on biscuits?  Sounds great but unfortunately it tasted like mutton grease gravy,  this may have been a staple on some Athenian sheep drives but to me it was not very fitting of the upscale surroundings.

2013-09-28,2.0,"In short, mediocre food, poor service, and high prices. We went towards the end of the brunch hour, were greeted by a friendly host, and were seated promptly.  We were given menus and I was a little surprised by the prices - $8.00 for a bowl of soup?  I was willing to overlook that, as I was excited to support 2 Sparrows since they use local/regional products like produce and Sprecher soda.  I opted for the grilled cheese with homemade tots ($9.00) and my mom ordered the chicken sandwich with fries ($11.00).  We each ordered a cup of chicken noodle soup. After placing our orders, our waiter stopped by the table to ask us a few questions that he should have asked upon taking our orders like, ""would you like to add any bacon to your grilled cheese?"" or ""did you want any sauce for your sandwich.""  We responded no to these questions, and resumed our conversation while waiting for our meal.  Time passes, and we find ourselves wondering about the ETA for our soup.  Just as we're about to ask, our waiter brings out our meals sans soup.  We remind him that we're missing our soups, and he comes back a few minutes later with one cup.  At this point, we remind him that we're still missing a cup of soup.  Instead of immediately returning to the kitchen to request the soup, he goes to the cashier station to check the bill, drops off a few things, and then he informs the cook.  Halfway through our meal, my soup finally arrives. Both my mom and I were disappointed with our meals.  While the portions were good, my mom said her chicken sandwich was nothing special and she disliked the chicken noodle soup which should have arrived before our main courses.  I was not a fan of the soup either - $5 per cup of chicken noodle made with macaroni noodles; to me, it was no better than Campbells,  Although I enjoyed my grilled cheese which combined goat cheese, gruyere, and cheddar on a baguette, the homemade tots were bland and tasted overcooked.   The total of our meal came to $36.00.  We asked the waiter if he could adjust the price of the soup as it wasn't brought out until halfway through our mea, and he had admitted that he ""completely forgot"" about it.  He removed one of the soups from our bill leaving us with a total of $31 and an unsatisfied feeling.",0.6855,0.86,0.078,0.062,0.5690331890331889

I still had to go ahead and try the maple bacon doughnut, and with that, they almost made up for the somewhat egregious hash brown misstep.   The doughnut was hot and fresh with this awesome maple glaze.  Salty and sweet a combination that can't be beat.  I want to go back to 2 Sparrows, next time I'm avoiding the hash though, and sticking with their homemade poptarts and doughnuts.  I had a friend who visited there that said the waffles were really good so I'm guessing they excel more in sweet breakfast, which I am not a huge fan of sweets.",0.9887,0.756,0.182,0.061,0.6136973180076628

There where many issues that made the meal and experience disappointing but the biggest failure that night was the pig. Some parts where tough and chewy others where  mushy and grainy and it was all served cold and looked very unappetizing. It really had no flavor and did not come with any sauce, I don't think good barbeque needs sauce but this one did. We did not even finish it which is highly unusual as I love pork, but my dog was happy she got left overs, and I can say she liked it, but then again she likes sniffing butts too. Honestly I would of been embarrassed to serve the pork I received to anyone. I attached pics of the left overs as they say a pic is worth a thousand words. We asked the server for different meat after explaining the problem but the replacement pork she brought was just more of the same. This pig roast was a disservice to the pig and the farmer who raised it. Some of the side dishes where good others where only fair but the truth is with such horrible pig what's the difference.  The other big problem was the service, they threw down all the food so fast after we sat down we did not even have a chance to get a drink prior to the food starting to come.  I think any restaurant should at least serve you your drink of choice before they bring on the chow. We told our server to slow it down but I could see they just set our food on the  kitchen counter and brought it later and now everything was cold.  We spent a lot of money that night and the menu that sounded so good did not come close to meeting our expectation.

The prices are a bit higher than you might be used to (aren't they always for organic?), but the food and drinks are excellent.  I had a handmade Back Patio soda with strawberry, rhubarb, lemon, and basil which was very refreshing and less sugary than most soft drinks out there.  I also had a grilled cheese sandwich with egg that had a nice blend of cheeses.  Sharp, but not overpowering.  But the meal truly shined with the addition of the tater tots.  They are huge, and the shredded, flaky potato has such an interesting and delightful texture.  I could eat them all day. I will say that portion sizes, while satisfying, aren't huge.  I also have to mention that we waited for quite a long time for our food to come.  If you are extremely hungry, I'd say move along and maybe save 2 Sparrows for a day when you have time and enough companions to hold a long conversation while you wait.   One more thing to mention is that the noise level in 2 Sparrows is pretty high.  I'm not sure if it's the acoustics of the room, or that we just had a particularly noisy group of fellow diners, but it was very difficult to hear the people next to me.",0.992,0.785,0.18,0.034,0.6037908496732025

I was impressed, especially when they offered a dark or light roast for coffee - finally, someone gets my coffee obsession. We started with the infamous homemade poptarts - yes I said homemade. We did the strawberry with balsamic glaze which was deelish. I probably could have just eaten 3 of these and been happy. They had a few different savory renditions as well, and it sounds like they try to change it up.  As for the main event, I ordered a chilaquiles style dish which was served on tortilla chips & added in chorizo. They added queso and a yummy aioli which made the dish a complete mess but very tasty. The man friend went with a pork belly sandwhich which was good but A LOT of porkbelly.

The first thing we ordered was a Maple Bacon donut to split. After doing research and reading other reviews, we decided that this was a must. At $4 it was a little steep for a fairly tiny donut, but we appreciated that it was completely homemade and full of flavor. I wasn't too sure about bacon on a pastry, but now I'm a believer. The salty-sweet combination was perfect. I had the brioche french toast. The bread was soft and delicious and was served with a dollop of honey mascarpone, which combined with maple syrup was really enjoyable. The portion was pretty large and I had some trouble finishing it, but it was too good to leave any behind. I have to say that I also appreciated the coffee that was served. I don't know what it was, but it definitely wasn't standard diner coffee and was definitely fresh.

I went here a few weeks ago with a large group of friends, yes the wait can be long but it is well worth it. If you are going to a restaurant during typical breakfast, lunch, or dinner times, expect to have some kind of a wait. We ordered the doughnut and both types of home-made pop-tarts as appetizers, all three were amazing. For my entre I had the root vegetables and gnocchi, so flavorful and spicy, the gnocchi was filling without being too ""doughy"", I had plenty of left-overs for another meal. My boyfriend got the biscuits and gravy, made with lamb instead of sausage and unlike regular biscuits and gravy this version was in no way greasy or flour heavy. It had a wonderful flavor and paired with the mixed greens was a perfect combination; a bitter astringent flavor to balance the richness of the gravy. One of my friends order the quiche, which was also perfect and had the proper consistency. 3 of my friends ordered the stuffed peppers, which were OUT OF THIS WORLD.... That dish was my favorite! The food was so wonderful we just had to try each other's dishes.  The coffee was also excellent and the service was superb. I guess the only complaint I would have would be that there is nowhere really to wait for a table, everyone just seems to crowd around the front door... which is not the owner's fault more the architect or interior design, they should have hired an interior designer like me instead, but I do love that the restaurant is sustainable.

2013-02-06,4.0,"I have to admit with some of the reviews that this immediate area is in dire need of some brunch places. I mean, hello? Most people completely miss the perfect barometer that Starbucks presents to anyone wanting to open a restaurant: the Emm Theorem states that the more dawdling traffic a given Starbucks gets is in direct proportion to how much business a non-hoity-toity restaurant can get. That aside, this is a good place that I just happened to run across while bypassing the overcrowded Starbucks. The place was virtually empty, as it was before the lunch rush. The server was great and attentive, and the menu was simple, uncomplicated and descriptive. I ordered the Cuban sandwich and a side of Tater Tots. Now, these tater tots are not the squat little potato cylinders of sadness that your Mom used to serve you when she was out of ideas for dinner. Let me repeat: these are not your mama's tater tots. These exemplars of potato flesh are about the size of a baby's fist, browned to perfection and constituted of what appears to be potato noodles. They are heavenly. I ordered a side or them, as my brunch partner kept sneaking them from my plate. The Cuban sandwich was good, but I have discovered that I do not particularly care for pork belly. If that makes me a bad foodie, so be it. I can take fat if it has been smuggled into my food; I mean, you cannot order anything fried and not expect there to be fat. I just don't want to see it. And that's pretty much ewhat pork belly is: fat that sits there and essentially says, 'screw you, healthy boy; I'm fat, I'm where its at - so get used to it'. My personal revelations about pork belly aside, the sandwich was good and the fresh bread was perfect. I didn't have any drinks while I was there - it was not even 11 am - but I suppose this would be a good joint for a sit down with a few friends. The atmosphere is designed to present warmth (dark brown wood and orange-red highlights, something that everyone seems to be doing in a misbegotten pitch to recover the 1970's), and it's a worthy place to visit.",0.986,0.82,0.127,0.053,0.5272197420634921

Not too strong in either flavor and the donut was fluffy compared to dense like traditional cake donuts.

The first time I went there and looked at the menu I was amazed at how everything looked so good. There are so many items on the menu that I wanted to try and I went back enough times that I was able to try all of them. Everything they make is fresh and truly homemade. For instance the ketchup is homemade and you can really taste the difference. It tastes unlike any other ketchup I have ever had. The first time I went there I had some BBQ pulled pork on a bun. The bun was great as it was very soft and fresh. They bake their bread daily. Some of my other favorite items are the Benedict which comes with pancetta and poached eggs. Very similar to the Benedict is the Parisian Gnocchi which also comes with pancetta and poached eggs.  The desserts are also wonderful. They make these homemade pop tarts with different fillings and icings. For instance they had one with Nutella and raspberry icing. The entire reason I went there and maybe the most famous dish there is their maple bacon donut. I highly recommend it.

We had brunch and enjoyed a creative modern take on locavore American food.  Service was swift and attentive although one item came out cold, but was promptly taken back and a replacement - not just a reheat - sent out. The cherry and fois gras pop tart gets fun novelty points and is on par with other restaurant made pop tarts I've had, but it's more of a way to highlight pastry dough than the fois gras...don't choose it for the fois. (I realized while eating it that a savory pop tart is basically an empanada) Chilaquiles were great overall and an unusual experience for us since they were served with green salsa and the chips didn't seem to be marinated - everywhere else we've ever had them the tortilla chips are marinated in a red sauce. I have no idea if this is creatively modern or some other Mexican tradition we weren't familiar with but it was still delicious. One note on hours: we tried to go to this place on Thanksgiving morning; we figured they might not be open but both their website and their answering machine said they were open and didn't list any special holiday schedules.

We ended up splitting the shrimp and grits and the steak and eggs. Shrimp and grits were fantastic. My only issue is that the dish was expensive and only included  four underwhelming-sized shrimp. I think a couple more would have seriously added. The steak and eggs was definitely nontraditional. It came on top of bleu cheese grits that were good, but had a very overwhelming flavor. The red wine aioli was so tasty and added to the beef. I also truly enjoyed the greens on the side that had a light and refreshing dressing. Overall, I liked 2 Sparrows, but will probably not return anytime soon. I'm always a little concerned when deciding on what I'm going to order is too easy...there wasn't a ton I just ""had"" to try on their menu.

The options seemed unique and delicious so I put me my name down for the wait (30 mins on Sunday, not bad). They allowed us to leave and walk around and offered to call when the place was ready which was nice. We finally got seated and our waitress was nice and knowledgeable about the menu. That is about where the great experience ended.  I ordered the Parisian Gnocchi and after pushing from the waitress added pancetta (extra $2) to the meal. After about 20/30 minutes our food came out. We were a table of 4 and 2/4 of the dishes came out cold, so we had to send them back. Then once I got my food back, I noticed there was now only 1 egg on the dish instead of 2 which I had gotten on the cold plate previously. Sent back again. Then (by this time half the table had finished their meals) I noticed that mine came without pancetta. At this point I told the server it was alright I could go without it but she insisted on bringing it out. By the time the pancetta came out I was the only one left eating and halfway through the gnocchi dish. Unlike what the waitress said, the gnocchi was fine without the added meat and the extra up-spend was unnecessary.  When we got our bill I was charged in full for everything, including the pancetta I received at the tail end of the meal after sending my dish back 3 times. I know that it is not guaranteed that you should get a price reduction with bad service, but it would have been a nice gesture. As we were walking out we saw the manager of the restaurant and I kindly told her that I had to send my meal back three times, and instead of offering an apology or even being friendly she just responded with ""we are well aware we are having kitchen problems today thank you"" and walked away.

2012-10-24,4.0,"The menu falls somewhere between hipster foodie and, ""Hello!  You're the best breakfast ever!""   The menu may be slightly different than what is posted online - it's somewhat fresh.  Less like a hirsute guy from the 70s with his shirt unbuttoned down to his waist to show off a tacky medallion type of fresh; more like seasonal local farmer's market items and chef disposition fresh.  Or for those of us diners who like to be surprised, serendipitously fresh For example, on the morning I was there, Buttermilk Pancakes were actually Lemon Poppyseed pancakes.  Magical-sounding, yes? The anti-cupcake/pro-doughnut factions out there will be happy to know that they make their own doughnuts.  For the so trendy, you're last month's news, they have a maple and bacon doughnut - with bacon crumbled on the outside like chocolate sprinkles.  If doughnuts, cupcakes, and bacon make you despondent, they also make their own pop-tarts.  These too come in trendy flavors, but doesn't Blueberry Ginger or Wild Mushroom and Goat Cheese sound appealing regardless of the hipster-ness? I opted for the Eggs Benedict.  I 86ed the House Made Pancetta (fancy bacon) and subbed the House Cured Salmon (lox).  The Hollandaise comes on the side; you mix it yourself.  Well, it's hollandaise and spinach sauce in one and some sort of very mild southwestern sauce in the other.  If you're from the Southwest, you'll roll your eyes.  It also comes with a salad.  If you're not keen on dressing glazing each individual baby spinach leave, ask for it on the side. My Lox Eggs Benedict was lovely.  It was almost like getting a bagel and lox with poached eggs on top.  I also loved that my breakfast came with greens.  I ordered a tea, which was near perfect.  Jasmine Green, and it came in an iron teapot.  For a square meal, it was very hip.  (I know, wittier than most.)",0.9861,0.848,0.134,0.018,0.5135521885521886

2012-09-20,1.0,"If I could rate 2 Sparrows with negative stars, I would.  Let me begin by saying that as a Chef & Culinary School graduate I know how long it takes to make all the food on the menu, and how to appropriately & efficiently run a busy restaurant.  Aside from having a nice atmosphere and cool photography on the walls, I found 2 Sparrows to be completely underwhelming and quite disappointing. My boyfriend had been telling me about 2 Sparrows (the maple bacon doughnut to be exact) for some time, so we decided to go for brunch around 11am on a Sunday.  After a 30-35 minute wait at Starbucks (and some great people watching), we walked back to the restaurant to be greeted by the hostess.  We were seated promptly, and then the real waiting game began. It took 10 minutes for the water to be poured in our glasses, and then another 10 minutes until the waiter came over to briefly introduce himself and take our order.  We immediately ordered everything we wanted, apps, entrees, & ""cocktails"" (more like watered down juice).  10 more minutes for bland & boring cocktails, and then an additional 20 for a maple bacon doughtnut, which in my opinion is offensive to all other doughtnuts. Overcooked doughnut, burnt bacon bits, and poorly executed frosting was just setting me up for further disappointment. Follow that with another 45 minutes for entrees that were still nowhere to be found, I decided I'd had enough.  It was to the point that the people sitting next to us got their food before we did (people that were sat well after we were), so I put a $20 on the table for the drinks and left. Being a Chef, I understand when the kitchen gets backed up, and I also understand when the staff gets overwhelmed by so many clients at one time.  However, there is no excuse for slow and unfriendly staff, waiting 10 minutes for overpriced and under cocktailed ""cocktails"", overcooked doughnuts with burnt bacon bits, and not pushing out scrambled eggs, toast, and bacon in a matter of one hour. If you are looking for an enjoyable brunch with great breakfast cocktails, friendly staff, and timely service, I do not suggest you try 2 Sparrows.",0.8405,0.86,0.087,0.053,0.44486531986531985
2012-09-16,1.0,"Let me preface this review by briefly discussing my first two trips to 2 Sparrows.  While there are no shortage of breakfast places in this neighborhood, there are definitely fewer options when it comes to upscale brunch places that use locally sourced ingredients.  My first trip here was about four months ago and I left quite impressed.  My friend and I split the maple bacon donut, which came out warm and fluffy with diced of cuts of pork belly on top of a sweet maple glaze.  I followed this with their pork belly biscuit served on homemade english muffin with pickled onion and some of the best tater tots I've ever had.  All of this was complemented with an expensive, albeit delicious, bloody Mary that was served with a beef jerky swizzle and pickle.  I left so impressed that I returned a few weeks later, but left questioning my choice.  While the maple bacon donut once again impressive, the rest of my meal was borderline inedible.  I ordered their corned beef hash, which looked and tasted like something that came out of a can of dog food.  With every bite the temperature varied as if they blended the main ingredients at various points of preparation.  I left underwhelmed, but vowed to give the place one more opportunity. Today was that opportunity and it was the final one I will ever give to 2 Sparrows.  My girlfriend and I walked up at 11:15 and being a Sunday morning, expected and were greeted to a wait.  We put our name in and were told that it would be approximately a 20-25 minutes wait and that they would call us when a table was ready (a practice that I wish more restaurants would adopt.)  We walked up the street to grab some coffee from Starbucks and after more than 30 minutes had passed, we figured we'd walk back and check on our table, which turned out to be perfect timing as the hostess was walking outside to find us as we walked up.  We were promptly seated and this is when everything began to go wrong. We waited approximately 10 minutes before the waters at our table were poured and another few minutes before being greeted by our waiter.  Seeing how busy the place was and having ample time to review the menu, we decided to place our entire order at that time.  We ordered cocktails (bloody Mary for me, a grapfruit-based drink for her), the aforementioned maple bacon donut, the ""old school"" (scrambled eggs, toast and bacon), and a grilled cheese with egg, bacon and tater tots.  At this point, we were both hungry, but not upset with the wait since it was clear that the small kitchen was being inundated by the large brunch crowd. Nearly 15 minutes later our drinks finally make it to our table.  For $10 per cocktail, one would expect a high quality drink, but that is not what either of us received.  Her drink was watered down and flavorless while my bloody was the exact opposite and wasn't enjoyable until some of the ice had melted, and even then it paled in comparison to what I could make at home in a few seconds with grocery store ingredients.  About 10 minutes after this (30+ minutes after sitting down for those of you keeping count) our donut arrived.  Right away I could tell something was amiss and as soon as I cut into the donut, I figured it out.  Someone had left it in the deep fryer for way too long so it felt like we were biting into a stale donut that was not only barely room temperature, but was covered in what looked and tasted like bacon bits as opposed to the thick cuts of belly that usually accompany it.  We continued to wait and figured that this meal could be redeemed by the main course.  After nearly another 30 minutes had passed we looked at each other and agreed that neither of us were still hungry.  We could hear the women at the table next to us grumbling about the long wait and when their food finally came out 10 minutes later, I was able to flag down the waiter and inquire about our meal as the couple on the other side of us had received their food, despite sitting down well after we had.  Now remember, we ordered scrambled eggs and bacon and a grilled cheese with tater tots.  These are not complex dishes that should take an hour to prepare and serve, even with a packed house.  When another five minutes had passed and despite the waiter assuring us that the food would be out immediately, we left cash on the table for the bland drinks and overcooked donut and informed the hostess that we would be leaving.  We are not the type of people who have unreasonable expectations and we were willing to give the benefit of doubt to a staff and kitchen that were perhaps playing catch up on a busy Sunday morning, but as my chef girlfriend commented as we walked out the door, in no restaurant anywhere in this country should it ever take more than an hour for the dishes we ordered.  There comes a point where you can no longer justify all these shortcomings and that is the reason why neither of us will ever be returning to 2 Sparrows.",0.987,0.881,0.078,0.041,0.42491776630330835

My guest and I started with a maple & bacon donut and a blueberry & ginger pop tart. Cooked to order, the donut struck the perfect balance between sweet and savory.

And we probably waited another 30 minutes for our food once we ordered. A tad long on the wait but again, it's Sunday brunch so I understand. They serve Metropolis coffee which is a big bonus for me. The menu looked delicious, but unfortunately seemed way overpriced.  As mentioned, my dining companion and I went on a Sunday morning for brunch. We shared a blueberry and thyme-infused lemon pop tart which was delicious, though a steep $4. A tad pricey for the pastry but I'd probably pay it again as it was very good and not many places are doing homemade pop tarts. For our entrees we ordered the duck confit hash and their pancetta breakfast sandwich. The duck hash was quite disappointing. For $13 there was hardly any duck. I had to fork through the sweet potato hash to find the few very small chunks that were interspersed in the dish. I also barely saw any egg. Very basic salad greens accompanied the dish so it was disappointing to pay that much for a pile of sweet potatoes and some salad.  The pancetta breakfast sandwich ($10) was served on a cracker-like biscuit. I don't know if the cracker-like element was intended but crunchy is not my ideal biscuit texture :) Two pieces of pancetta, a sunny side up egg and a couple pickled onions between the biscuit made for a well-flavored sandwich but the crunchy biscuit crumbled into several pieces when I bit into it. The sandwich was served with a side of roasted potatoes that were pretty good. I think this place has a lot of potential but the quality and portions of their dishes seems to lack consistency. I saw plates with mounds of chilaquiles and fat stacks of pancakes topped with lots of blueberries. However, the ingredients on our plates were a bit skimpy for the amount we paid.

After a 30 second discussion that we can't go to Frances every Saturday we decided: ""fine, we'll stay.""  Result:DING-WRONG CHOICE My husband and I were full of mixed emotions as we sat and waited 45 looonggg minutes for our food to arrive. First emotion: I'm so hungry I'm going to eat your face off. Second emotion: why the hell is this taking so long? Third emotion: BUZZKILL. I ordered the fancy falafel burger which tasted like the heated up boca burger I make at home every night for dinner in the microwave. My husband ordered the duck confit hash, which looked like the last time he had the flu.

Overall, I have had a few things but I prefer lunch over breakfast so I have become a fan of their corned beef sandwich.  I love it.  And I love that they make their own pickles and give the option of a salad instead of french fries like every other place.  And this is a real salad, not some browned iceberg with a few carrot sticks. They have a bar which is nice as well as some la-ti-da coffee if that's your thing.  I prefer tea which comes in its own pot especially for you.  The place is a little pricey and for everyday breakfasts, I hit Stellas on Broadway but for a nice change of pace, closer to home, this place rocks.  It's always busy unless you get there before 10am.",0.987,0.82,0.169,0.011,0.5114734299516909

I'd definitely recommend it again. I'm pretty sure my friend got the regular buttermilk pancakes but the honey mascarpone sauce was such a nice touch. There is quite a wait to get in on the weekends.

Fast forward a few months and I tested my luck again, this time on a weekday with four friends.  The restaurant was about  1/2 full, so I was excited for their second chance!  We decided to forgo the ""appetizers"" and order four meals to share.  Again, we had to wait about 40 minutes for our food to be served, which I pre-warned my guests about (however hoped it wasn't true this time around) and again, my coffee cup was empty for most the dining experience.  As three of us were receiving our meals, we were informed that they ran out of the fourth meal and if we would like, could order something different!  I was appalled; they had 40 minutes to inform us that we needed to choose a different dish - but instead chose to share this information, as everyone else was being served.  Lucky for my table, we were all friends and willing to share what we did receive - we were not willing to wait 40 additional minutes for another entre.   Overall the lack of service overshadows the great food.",0.988,0.801,0.144,0.055,0.5348125996810208

If you don't like trendy or organic, maybe you should stick with McD's. I've been here about 10 times now. However, if my last visit had been my first, I probably wouldn't go back. So this is a plea to the management: fix the kitchen support now, or this enterprise will fail. This should be a 5-star review, not a 2. First off, the floor staff has always been at a minimum very good to wow, enthusiastic. I'll take enthusiastic--it's fun when the staff loves the food and drink. So no complaints there. But the kitchen. Ugh. We were there during Sunday brunch, and I'll just list the sins: 1. Out of soup. Again. Hello....you still have almost 4 hours left in your serving day. MAKE MORE SOUP. 2. It took an hour to get our food. An hour for breakfast stuff--really? And I didn't have my soup. 3. My order was messed up. I knew the server knew that the small change I had asked for wasn't done because as soon as I got his attention and he saw my plate, he knew right away what was wrong. Sucky kitchen strikes again.  4. My order was cold. Obviously it was cooked first and then sat about for 45 minutes while my dining companions' was prepared. Oh, and it was wrong. 5. My order was improperly cooked. I have ordered eggs over easy at this place at least 5 times, and I know what to expect. Flat, crispy hockey pucks is not on the expectation list. And it was cold and the order was wrong. 6. I had the steak and eggs, which is one of my favorites. Their cows must have gone on a diet. The steak was about half the size of all previous encounters with the dish. Of course, I should have made a fuss, but given #2, and our schedule, we barely had enough time to scarf it down (lose more points for not being able to enjoy the food). To their credit, my companions' food was tasty and hot. The coffee (Metropolis) is always very good. I'll give it a couple of more tries - I want this place to thrive.

Way to take the cheapest ingredients and charge way to much for them. When I told our waitress I was vegetarian she expressed that I could also get a veg version of their eggs benedict. I decided to go with that... and I shouldn't have.  What a disaster. A soft French baguette cut in half was the bread. That on trying to cut your first bite everything toppled over and in no way shape or form looked like a benedict any longer. They mine as well left everything separate on the place and let you cut pieces to assemble a bit yourself. On top of it... I felt like I was eating cardboard. Thank God they still poached the eggs because the creamy yokes and how empty my stomach was were the only reasons why I forced the meal down. Btw... their benedict cost $12 bucks! NOBODY and I mean nobody charges that much north or river north for such a dish... completely absurd.

I was then brought the sandwich that had been sitting on the warming shelf for 30 + minutes along with the check, which Hector let us know he had applied a discount to for the wait.  I explained that I had seen my sandwich sitting up there for a long time.  Again, no explanation or apology - in fact nothing, Hector disappeared, never to be seen again.  We ended up leaving more of a tip then either of us wanted to - because we couldn't find Hector to get us any change!

They've been getting press, we thought, ""Well, we're going into town...let's eat!""  A Saturday late morning wait was a reasonable wait of 15ish minutes.  We were seated, and our waiter was pretty gregarious. We placed our orders for the donuts, as well as some of the housemade sodas: for him the ""Cool as A...""

Honestly, these were the highlight of the meal, especially mine. Fizzy, fresh, with a unique herbal undernote, it woke my palate up. The famed donut didn't keep the flavor parade going, though. This was a cake donut, and while I usually love cake donuts, it seemed that this one really should have been raised. It also tasted a bit stale. The glaze crackled but clung to it (vs. falling off in chunks, the sign of bad icing job), but the maple wasn't very strong; likewise, the bacon did not have the salty ""oomph."" It was just...pallid.  I also tried to eat it slowly, because I'd ordered some homemade tater tots, which just weren't arriving. The waiter kept swinging by, bowing and scraping, and I finally asked him to cancel the order since I'd finished everything else...right as they arrived. Timing is everything, folks. By then we were pretty much ready to blow out of there, but the things were roasting hot so we had to wait a bit.

The Parisian Gnocchi dish was excellent: a poached egg with hollandaise sauce on top of grilled asparagus served with Parisian gnocchi.  The grilled asparagus tasted great, but what I really appreciated was substituting the Parisian gnocchi as the starch for what would ordinarily be some form of breakfast potatoes. The thirty-minute wait around noon on Sunday was less than ideal, but not that bad in itself.  Once inside, the service is friendly and accommodating, but the air conditioning and ventilation were a little weak for a rather hot spring day.  All in all for brunch, I would put 2Sparrows just under the old Jam location (which I was extremely impressed with) but a class above Nightwood and The Gage.",0.9972,0.737,0.237,0.026,0.5452777777777779

I started with a cup of fantastic coffee, and ended up ordering the daily special.  This was a salmon benedict with a salad on the side.  The salmon was on some sort of toast, not an english muffin.  It was served with two shot glasses of hollandaise, which initially looked the same, but on pouring turned out to have either chili oil or some sort of pesto inside.  I was very disappointed that my poached eggs' yolks were completely cooked through - that golden runny yolk is why eggs benedict and breakfast in general is so good.  I think the salmon was smoked - the flavor wasn't too strong though.  Overall the dish was pretty good. I liked the hollandaise with the pesto and avoided the chili oil - it was way too heavy for 8:30 am.  The salad was baby spinach with lots of red onion, pickled beets, and pickled ramps in some sort of vinaigrette. I enjoyed the salad, but it would be difficult for someone who does not like a lot of raw onion, especially for breakfast. You'd need some serious listerine before going on with your day. I think the whole thing would work better as a salad with the salmon and poached eggs over the salad with crostini on the side, and losing the hollandaise all together. The yolks with the vinaigrette would be dressing enough.  My last visit was at lunchtime and I had the veggie burger. It was pretty amazing as far as veggie burgers go, with lovely fresh sweet corn and actual pieces of real veggies! None of this textured soy protein crap. Came with some sort of avocado crema. The tots were nicely crisp with real potato texture, and came with their homemade ketchup which is interestingly spiced - still trying to figure out what was in there.  No issues with service - excellent both times, helpful, prompt, and friendly. Today, I was a little confused by the number of people who came to my table, I think there were four different guys. But they were all nice, so I just went with the flow.  There are still lots of things I want to try on their menu, the lamb sausage gravy and biscuits, the pancakes....I will be coming back. Next time I am going to come with someone so I can split one of the delicious sounding doughnuts or pop tarts. :)",0.9968,0.747,0.192,0.061,0.5493392228686347
2012-04-22,1.0,"I didn't order a cocktail with brunch today.  Turns out that was a big mistake.  A cocktail would have numbed the pain of just how terrible my food was.  I know what you're thinking, ""Come on, was it really THAT bad?""  All I can say is yes, yes it was. Did you know that they serve fat sandwiches in Chicago?  No, I don't mean big sandwiches, I mean fat sandwiches, like when you put a large strip of lard on a biscuit.  Mmmm, right?  Yuck.  Let me start from the beginning... Everything looked good so I had some trouble deciding.  Usually, though, I try to order something different that I can only get at that particular restaurant.  I decided to try the foie gras and cherry pop tart to start out with.  For the main course, I narrowed my choices down to the veggie burger and the belly sandwich.  Ultimately, after a recommendation from the server (and the fact that I saw 3/4 of a veggie burger left uneaten by a diner at another table), I went for the belly sandwich. Let me start out by saying that I'll eat anything.  The weirder, the better so I'm definitely not a picky eater.  The first things to come out were the pop tarts.  My friend's nutella and raspberry tart was ok for me but my foie gras tart was just plain bad.  The tart was mostly sour cherry but it was not good paired with the foie gras.  The ""foie gras"" had the consistency of small chunks of ground beef so looking back, it was probably good that there was so little of it.  Come to think of it, if Kellogg's came out with a foie gras pop tart, this is probably what it would taste like.  Maybe they were going for good old authenticity?  I could only manage to eat a few bites. For those of you hanging in there to see where to get that fat sandwich, here it is.  The belly sandwich is supposed to be pork belly, egg and onions on a biscuit.  My first thought when it came out was, ""is pork belly supposed to be this white?""  No, but fat is, and that's exactly what was on top of my biscuit, a big, thick strip of pure fat.  This is not my first rodeo, I know that pork belly is supposed to have a good amount of fat but this was ridiculous.  Trust me, I tried every which way to find any meat and I was only able to salvage about 1/8 of a bite...and that wasn't good either.  I probably should have sent it back but I wasn't confident that anything else would be good either.  So I ate my store bought biscuit with the egg on it and tried to get over it.   I left the tater tots for last, my only hope for salvaging any part of the meal.  They were ok but we spent most of the time trying to figure out what exactly was in their interesting homemade ketchup. So in summary, if you're going to serve a fat sandwich, at least try to brown the fat so it looks like meat.  Oh, and if you go there, drink heavily.",0.9881,0.845,0.108,0.047,0.4513986468904502

Its a cute little place, modern decor and various lighting options based on where you sit.  The menu is simple but unique.  They make their own pop-tarts, how cool is that?   The first day we tried them I was starving for some french toast.  We look over the menu, spot an amazing concept (maple glazed doughnut with bacon) and then placed our order.  I ordered french toast, yep, thats it.  It doesn't come with sides, like most places serve, but im sure I could add them for an additional price.  My girlfriend orders the quiche of the day, which looked amazing on the gentleman's plate next to us.  I had the regular coffee, but my girlfriend wanted the coffee from Ecuador.  Which promised a more bold and full bodied taste.  I thought the regular coffee was just fine. Our server is good and the staff making sure waters stay topped off are on point.  No complaints about the service at all.   Our food arrives in decent time, no long waits and they were busy.  At first glance I can see that the French Toast is a little under cooked, but that does't worry me because it happens a lot.  It depends on how undercooked it really is.     I start to tear into the french toast and immediately feel that the bread is a little old.  The crust part of the bread is extremely hard to cut.  I look closer and its soggy, way undercooked and im not willing to risk salmonella poisoning.    I asked the server to return it and mentioned why I was not happy.  Really having my heart set on French toast i couldn't find anything else I wanted.  I did try a bite of my girlfriends keish, it was awesome, but I forgot the type.  Our server returns later to tell us the whole meal was comped! I stated that was not necessary at all, I would definitely pay for what was eaten.  he told me that it was no big deal and it was already approved.  They didn't want that to deter us from returning.   So,  the next day we gave them another shot.  Service was consistent, but the food, again, was not.  :(  My biscuits and lamb gravy sounded amazing.  I took one look at the biscuits and my heart sank.  I know exactly what shelf and what frozen bag those little biscuits come from.  don't believe me? well, they were cold upon my first bite.  not room temp, actually cold.  However, the gravy was tasty and I just blended it together to warm up the biscuits.  A manager came by, asked us how we were and i told him my dilemma.  He said he would mention it to the chef, but that was it. sorry 2 Sparrows, i want to like you, but I can't.  I will say that your maple bacon doughnut is good, but for the price and size, it isn't worth it. :(",0.9899,0.777,0.14,0.083,0.5074801094962386

2012-02-27,5.0,"Since there are 2 Sparrows, let there be two reviews! ~~5 Course Wine Pairing Dinner~~ I made a reservation four days in advance and was glad I had finally got through the busy phone lines to save my spot.  For roughly $75 2-Sparrows offers dinner and drink pairings once a month.  This February they had wines from Girasole Vineyards in California which were perfectly paired with five food courses. 1st: Leek, shallot, frisee, hazelnut w/ 2012 Pinot Blanc 2nd: Sturgeon, blue crab, sunchoke, black trumpet mushroom w/ 2009 Chardonnay 3rd: Squab, cippolini onion, beet, white bean w/ 2009 Pinot Noir 4th: Venison, red wine risotto, collard greens, parmesan w/ 2008 Zinfandel 5th: Tangerine, ginger, honey, almond w/ 2012 Muscat Canelli (See photo:  yelp.com/biz_photos/jOus… ) A few memorable moments: -The bar manager, Daniel, was extremely accommodating and friendly.  He chatted the night away with each and every table, which was appreciated. -Diners were not limited to one glass of wine with each course.  The staff kept pouring...  Cheers to the night, I say!  The wines were not outstanding, I'll admit that there are much better wines coming from the lands of California, but the Chardonnay and Pinor Noir were my favorites over all. -The second course of Sturgeon fish was the best one, hands down.  According to Daniel, the huge fish came straight from a river in Washington state, the fresh flavors proved this to be true.  The nutty, buttery flavors of the Chardonnay with the mushrooms and crab accents were a match made in heaven. -I had never tried squab before (a domesticated pigeon that never flies--basically; I had only seen it on Chopped) and I will admit that I was pleasantly surprised.  It was like eating dark meat from a chicken or duck, but a comparable size to a pheasant.  The fact that the chef gave several cuts of the breast was welcomes, but also a mini lollipop drumstick, I was in love.  Not to mention that the white bean spread was a delectable addition. (See photo:  yelp.com/biz_photos/jOus… ) -The venison was tasty but quite rare for my liking.  Although the dishes were made for a large group, it would have been nice to have the option of medium rare or medium.  Otherwise, it was accompanied by the best collard greens which were cooked perfectly, along side the rich cheesy risotto.  (See photo:  yelp.com/biz_photos/jOus… ) All in all, it was well worth the money and delicious.  I can say that the chef has a truly talented palate and art of cooking.

First i love the decor, the gorgeous warm tones and reclaimed wood bar top, definitely gives a very inviting vibe Service was fantastic as well, the staff there was helpful, friendly and made great recommendations I had the maple and bacon donut , fresh squeezed pink grapefruit juice and the single origin coffee this morning and that probably would have been enough for breakfast but being a first timer, i had to try somethin else and i had the shrimp and grits. Boy everything was so tasty, i polished off the donut in no time (it does have a very different texture than donuts i had at donghnut vault or Nana, nonetheless very good) and the shrimp and grits were awesome as well (esp the kale).

2012-02-26,1.0,"This place needs to fix their wait time issues. I've visited numerous times and each time decide out of sheer hunger or frustration, to go back home and eat some pinche toast. They take your phone number down, smile, and then just pretend nothing ever happened and never call. It would be a different story, perhaps, if they offered coffee while you wait, or if the food was to die for (which, in talking to those who had made it to the other side, was not the case).  Instead it seems the priorities are more focused on cultivating a clashing, but in their minds super cool, eclectic aesthetic to the place.  Even that doesn't work though, as it's sort of a ""let-me-lift-up-my dreads-to-show-you-my-new-sparrow-tat"" appearance mixed with concrete slabs (of the ""it's unfinished for a reason"" variety), and mid century glam madmen secretary looks.    Try less on that, harder on the basics.

2012-02-25,2.0,"Based on other reviews, I was looking forward to brunch at 2 Sparrows but was disappointed. I went on Saturday with a friend, arrived around11am and only had to wait about 20 minutes. I had the Belly Sandwich which is a homemade biscuit, pork belly, sunny side egg,pickled onions and tots.  I had my eye on this dish amongst others but decided to go with it based on it being one of our waiter's recommendations.  The biscuit was nothing noteworthy, especially being homemade.  The pork belly was a bit on the dry side (a difficult feat given the fat content of pork belly).  The tots although also homemade, looked very appealing, presented as small bites in a bird's nest pattern,  were so salty they were inedible (and I like salt, especially on potatoes). To top it off, the entire thing was luke warm. The pickled onions were hands down the redeeming element on the plate.   My friend had the chiaquiles and while I only had a bite of a tortilla chip with some sauce, which was good and the chip appeared to be homemade, she said overall they were ok and she had had better. Now admittedly, I do have some culpability as I didn't send my plate back nor say anything to the server.  This is something I rarely if ever do, and my dish it was almost bad enough to do so, but I didn't want to make a fuss nor wait for another meal to come out. Overall, while the space is cute, it has a good vibe and the service is good as well, I won't go back nor would I recommend 2 Sparrows as the food just wasn't there.",0.9832,0.8,0.147,0.053,0.5769841269841269

While I am thrilled that there is a new, unique brunch place in this location, I still think they are missing some important things. I would have given my first experience only 2 stars, but I forgave their mistakes since it was right when 2 Sparrows opened... SERVICE: To begin, the hostesses are extremely snobby and rude. It is a stark contrast to the servers, who are all laid back and covered in tattoos. I just don't see how the two personalities work together? The service is fairly slow, and both times I had to remind the servers to bring my drinks or food out, or refill my coffee.  FOOD: 2 Sparrows cannot serve me a single dish without making a mistake! The first time I went there, my friend ordered the eggs/sausage/salad basic dish. She has a severe milk allergy, and while 2 Sparrows tried to be accommodating, they still ended up serving milk (butter) in her meal, which they took off the bill. Also, the fresh-squeezed OJ was extra ""tart"" that day. The second time I went there, I ordered the Market Salad WITHOUT goat cheese, and it arrived with remnants of goat cheese on it (like it had been accidentally added and then removed), and without walnuts as mentioned on the menu. I didn't complain but I have yet to have a great experience with the food... the maple & bacon donut is incredible (YUM!), the drinks are good, but the main dishes always come out in error. Coffee is great. PRICE: very expensive for the service, though the prices seem low for the quality of food they claim to offer.

2012-02-13,5.0,"I've been here about a dozen times.  And to speak bluntly,  I feel like I have taken breakfast restaurants for granted for far too many years.  It is so nice to see fresh offerings that while are still comfort foods that I relate to, deviate from the norm.  I also love that every time I visit that the menu has changed up slightly. I see most people griping about wait times....  Most of my visits have been weekend visits where, yes, it has been slammed but I have never once waited for a seat.  If you are eating solo or with a companion, there always seems to be an available seat at the breakfast bar.  The bonus to sitting at the bar is you are always 2 feet away from a very attentive bartender.  I've found the bartenders to be a blast to talk with and it is by far my preferred seating. Foodwise,  I can't help but find myself ordering the chicken sandwich with homemade tater tots.  droooool.   Its little things like the homemade ketchup that make me feel spoiled (other than the bristol, I can't think of anyone that makes their own ketchup).  And concerning price, I think that sandwich is like 10 bucks which if you think about it is, what, a 2 dollar premium over eating at denny's....  sold.  It certainly makes some of the sides like the bacon donut or pop-tarts seem a bit expensive but they are freaking incredible. Drinks:  they got that too.  Actually they have a pretty solid beer list.  Double actually, I'd be hard pressed to find a better drinking establishment before noon.  While I stick to mainly being a beer snob,  their bloody mary is puts a devious grin on my face.  I also have to admit that I have told the bartender a few times to surprise me, which has made me question my hops and barley tendencies. decor:  Its hip.  Nothing about it is in my face that makes me feel uncomfortable,  but it is all custom and I couldn't even guess where or how any of it was sourced....  ya, I'm kinda  a dork about that stuff, and omg its the little things like seeing LED bulbs in everything and someone making the concious decisions that the dining area needs warm white bulbs and the kitchen cool white.",0.9855,0.805,0.141,0.053,0.5602453102453102
2012-02-12,2.0,"We went here this past Saturday. We have been wanting to go since it opened but each time we attempt to do so, we are told the wait is an hour and a half. On cold days, we can't do this with kids nor do we really want to wait THAT long. Reservations would REALLY be a good idea here and it will become obvious why in the rest of my review.  After waiting 20 minutes we were finally seated. One should know though that this place is LOUD. So if you are looking to have a decent conversation, find another place. But we were OK. with this as we arrived with our twins and it is nice to have them drowned out a bit from time to time. We love them but it can be a nice break.  On to the food. We ordered well enough, drinks, meals and then the waiting began. And we waited, and waited, and waited. 35 minutes later we had our kids french toast. REALLY? But, the kids loved their french toast. four pieces, stacked and lots of syrup and fruit topping. My wife ordered the eggs Benedict. There were pretty small portions for her and she is a pretty small woman. Not something I would recommend if you are really hungry. Also, she felt that they were pretty uninteresting and lacking any real flavor.  I ordered the steak and eggs. Wow...what a disappointment. The greens were nice with great flavor. The potatoes were underdone other over done. Mehhh. My eggs were over cooked on the bottom and runny on the top...how DO you do that? My steak was medium rare but it was more just uncooked in some spots and rare in others and crisp on the outside. Very uneven cooking. Again...not sure how one does that  also.  Bill was $60 bucks. I can easily say that the atmosphere is a nice improvement over the other brunch dinners in the area but by way of food, the less hip dinners have them beat hands down.  Why.....I believe it is their inability to master the crowd and turn over. The no reservations leaves them with folks waiting a long time to sit, then they sit and sit and sit. Which makes it really hard to hold off the new visitors for any realistic time frame. Then things on this day were turning over at the same time and order were coming in like crazy. The kitchen was rushed to get the food out and the quality fell through the floor.  I should have sent back my food honestly but I was hunger, my kids were fine and we could get out of there asap.  I have to say, this place was really not worth the hype. It is JUST NOT WORTH IT! Sorry....we really wanted to like this place. There are so few nice somewhat upscale brunch places with some interesting things but until they figure out how to manage the crowd and turnover so that it doesn't impact the quality of food delivered to the table, I am not certain the rush will last. We experienced the same thing with ""Community"" restaurant in our neighborhood on the UWS of NYC. Same problems type restaurant.

2012-02-05,5.0,"People tend to complain that there is a long wait (30-60 min) to get into this place, but I want to reassure you that is very much worth the wait. I love, love, LOVE 2 Sparrows for two reason: 1) it is delicious and modern while still keeping the ""classics"" classic, and 2) all the food is made fresh, and bought directly from local farms, which is something that not nearly enough restaurants do anymore. Thought the food is not labeled as ""100% organic,"" it's as close as it gets without there being a big, green sticker on the packaging. As a student studying environmental science and agriculture nutrition, I approve of this establishment. I'm acquainted with several of the employees there, so I get to hear about the menu and business as a whole very often. If you want my recommendation on how to get a table without the long wait on the weekends, you should go before 10am, as 10:30-11am is when the lunch/brunch crowd comes in. If you go anytime after 11am, don't be upset about the wait (since I warned you). Weekdays aren't as busy (so it's a shorter or no wait), but it varies day by day. Finally, food recommendations... When my sister told me that 2 Sparrows was serving a glazed maple and bacon doughnut, I was both shocked and appalled at the sound of it.

2012-01-24,3.0,"A friend and I decided to try out 2 sparrows for brunch on Sunday. We arrived at noon, expecting a wait and we were told it would be 45 minutes. However, they have come up with the most ingenious (and now, seemingly obvious) idea ever: they take everyone's cell phone numbers, and call you when your table is ready! Not only does this free you up to head to the nearby coffee shops or stores, but it makes the small waiting space much less crowded. Genius! So we were indeed seated 45 minutes later. I absolutely loved the decor - very lofty, lots of exposed wood, is a very nice space. Our waitress was lovely and super friendly. Unfortunately, by the time we were seated (around 1pm), they were already out of most of the things we had wanted to order, including the much-touted pop tarts. But we settled on a few cocktails (great cocktail, wine and beer list) and placed our orders. Then we waited. And waited some more. And sucked on our ice cubes, hoping they would mitigate the deep and aching hunger in our empty tummies. Then we waited a little longer. Then, out came our cocktails! About 25 minutes after ordering them.  We tried to sip on them but they were so yummy (and providing some much-needed calories) that we were already a little buzzed by the time our food arrived, which was about 45 minutes AFTER our cocktails arrived. Our waitress, again, was very nice and apologetic, but to be honest I didn't think the food was even worth the wait. It was definitely yummy, and the prices aren't bad, but I don't think I'd wait another 2 hours to eat next time.",0.9949,0.751,0.196,0.053,0.5566666666666666

She told us the wait time, and didn't even ask if we would like to be put on the wait list. When we were seated, it took forever for the waitress to get over to us, and when we ordered, it took her forever to tell us they were out of homemade tots and the salmon burger, which was fine, but it meant they did not plan ahead for the holiday crowd. Also, the menu was already pretty limited. The waitress was actually very courteous, however it then took a very long time for the grilled cheese I ordered to come, though the blend of cheeses (including goat cheese!) was very creamy and tasty. We did order dessert, and my brother's gelati also took a very long time to come. The prices were steeper than they should have been, the waits were too long, the hostess too unwelcoming.

Love that there is a small area to sit and wait (though small) and even the Sunday paper for eager brunch eaters to read while they cool their heels. There were not one, but TWO hostesses working the Sunday rotation courteously taking names and phone numbers. 25 minutes. That was the amount of time AFTER the 45 minutes we waited. We drooled eyeying other diners food and planned what to order. Rats. They're out of foie gras pop tarts (my main reason for dining at 2 Sparrows!) and the quiche of the day. I satiate my appetite with the homemade doughnuts which as other reviewers mentioned are sadly dense. That quality would be welcome for a cake doughnut, but a yeast doughnut? It should be light and fluffy! The chocolate blueberry sauce on top was nice, but didn't add much and ditto for the maple bacon. I did fill up on my bowl of biscuits and gravy. How can you make biscuits and gravy lighter? Well, the folks at 2 Sparrows have managed to do just that with a lamb based gravy, biscuits (suffering the same fate as the too dense doughnuts) and a lovely side of mixed greens. I loved the atmosphere - the space is beautifully designed and warm. This is also one of the prettiest brunch spot bathrooms I've seen!

Either way, a connoisseur of chicken sandwiches, he ordered that. He was not at all impressed. He said it lacked any flavor and overall was just bland.  I was in the mood for breakfast and with the waiter's recommendation, ordered the eggs benedict. The twist is that it has pancetta instead of canadian bacon- which I'm not a fan of anyway so was happy with the description. Also the waiter said it comes with two type of hollandaise- scallion and red pepper. Cool, right. Well, I get the plate and seriously, the english muffin the eggs are supposed to sit on were the tiniest things I've ever seen. The fresh greens it comes with (a plain side salad, with bland balsamic dressing) overwhelmed the plate.  I had 2 tiny poached eggs with basically no bread underneath and a SALAD for breakfast. The pancetta was just tiny pieces, yes little pieces of bacon underneath the eggs. It was weird. One of my tiny poached eggs was overcooked and didn't run when I broke into it - which is the best part! The 2 kinds of hollandaise also wasn't that inventive. Both were indistinguishable and also bland.  As for the service. That was the only redeeming part of our meal. Our waiter was super nice. Brought us over some food while our food took forever and took off my meal from the bill.  Overall, there are many other great brunch places in the city.

Both were good, but not amazing.  They ran out of quiche *cry* but redeemed themselves with the belly sandwich, corned beef & hash, and their homemade tater tots.  Oh those tots. More on those later. The sandwich was pretty damn tasty. Pickled onions are always a win. I'll agree with the other reviewers who said the biscuit is a tad on the dry side -- but that's what runny egg yolk is for. If you're a fan of corned beef & hash, try their version, they make a fine one (topped off with some really fantastic homemade sausage). Now onto those homemade tater tots. These finely shredded, deep fried globules of goodness are a must-try. You will not want to eat tots anywhere else again. My eating partner-in-crime was still raving about them the next day and figuring out how he could recreate them at home. That's when you know something's good.

It's at the bar that I met the head chef (Chef Ellis) and the GM.  I got a background of where they started out from and how this place came to be.  They were trained at highly rated restaurants, Charlie Trotters and L20, but wanted to start out on their own.  They scouted locations and found this one after going to the AT&T store across the street.  The name came from the Chef after he was getting a tattoo and saw 2 Sparrows.  The GM looked up what two sparrows represented, and in Greek mythology, two sparrows equal both love and agriculture.  It fit their passion and love of food, and their belief in serving freshly daily delivered food from local farms.  I personally love it that they support local IL farmers and do them a great service by creating great dishes.

2011-11-29,2.0,"I was really excited to try 2 Sparrows after reading about it in several food blogs and getting a wholehearted endorsement from a friend who had gone before.  After all, the two guys who opened it used to work at Trotter's.  The menu looked absolutely amazing...I mean, foie gras pop tarts?  Sign me up! Disappointing pretty much sums up the whole experience.  We were expecting a lot after the hype, and unfortunately, 2 Sparrows just wasn't that great. We started out with the foie gras & cherry compote pop tart.  It was piping hot when it came out, and I immediately cut off a corner.  All pastry, no filling.  Understandable...the corner bites always lack filling.  I cut off another section and I start to see some red jam from the compote.  Still not enough for my tastes.  I keep cutting until I reach the middle and I finally get some semblance of filling, but I still don't get any foie.  The BF is doing the same on the other side of the pop tart and told me that he got a little bit of foie but not much.  Don't get me wrong, the pastry itself is delicious, but come on now, if I ordered a foie gras pop tart, I'm expecting some foie gras in my pop tart.  Pass. The BF ordered the belly sandwich.  It was underwhelming and completely bland & underseasoned.  Ya heard of salt & pepper??  The homemade tater tots were one of the highlights of the meal.  They were crispy, fresh, and different.   My steak & eggs were meh.  The sunny side eggs were way too runny - the whites weren't set.  The steak, which I requested to be medium rare, came out medium at best.  And the texture of the meat was kind of weird.  Stringy, tough on the outside, and just not very good.  The roasted potatoes were pretty standard.  The side salad was pretty good. We also ordered a side of the sausage, which was the second highlight of the meal.  It was great - flavorful & wonderfully seasoned. Look, I understand that 2 Sparrows may have been over-hyped but I expected a lot more from two Trotter alumni. I get that you use locally grown, seasonal, farm fresh ingredients, but it means nothing if you butcher the seasoning & cooking.  2 Sparrows is not the only brunch place that uses high quality ingredients, and for the price I paid, I was extremely disappointed.  I would definitely make the slightly longer trip to the Publican for brunch next time.",0.9781,0.8,0.121,0.078,0.5524973835688122

My husband's sandwich was fine.  Nothing special, just fine.  He also ordered a side of potatoes and those were not fine.  They were a tad on the raw side.

The tiny squares of bacon gave the donut the perfect amount of salt kick.  *Do not order the savory mushroom pop tart. It was very bland and not good (okay, it sucked). *For the main event, order the shrimp 'n grits. I could probably eat this all day. It had the perfect amount of spice, the grits were creamy, and the shrimp great.  *A side of bacon will not disappoint.  *What will disappoint are the tater tots - as others have said, they are just not good (and having a bad tater tot is a new experience for me). Another review said they were too crispy, well mine were not crispy enough, and bland. Also, the house made ketchup did not do it for me. I was craving real ketchup, which they did not have! They just couldn't get these right. *My brother had the egg sandwich and did not speak until he finished. And when he spoke, he ordered another bacon maple donut. He ate until he was nauseous.

I was told that the chef trained or worked at Charlie Trotters, and it just didn't seem like a professional chef created the ramen dish that I had. The broth was bland, no flavor... it was like colored water. And there was barely any meat or veggies or anything. Maybe it was a mistake to order ramen from this kind of place. Also tried the corned beef hash. Again, it wasn't that great. It was different, which I applaud them for trying to dress it up, but it didn't work for me. What was good were the donuts.

The place was still crowded but we were seated right away.  The decor is awesome, reminds you of a bird nest with the artwork but so modern looking and colorful. My first complaint was the wait to get the food. It took an hour for a Salmon BLT and a Veggie Burger. Our waitress was kind enough to keep checking but it was still ridiculously long.  We heard the women next to us complain about the level of salt in both of their dishes and sent them back. Unfortunately we had the same experience with the Salmoon BLT. The amount of salt on it was unreal but we were so hungry after the hour that we happily ate it. The veggie burger was delicious great flavors. My only gripe was that it fell apart easily and was a little hard to eat. The tater tots aren't worth it. They're not really tots so much as large potatoes and you only get 4. The size of them makes them incredibly awkward to eat.  I wanted to love this place but unfortunately I only liked it.

I was confused by what just happened so I went up to the server and asked if I could just have it back and she said no she was ordering me a new one.

I was pretty disappointed with my experience here yesterday, but I will give it another try once they've been in business for a little longer. The decor is beautiful. I love the wood panelling on the walls and ceiling, and the color scheme of grays and reds is really appealing. The room sets the mood. Unfortunately, the food does not meet the expectations set by the decor. I got the corned beef hash. The salad and sausage were great and the poached egg was perfect, but the hash (the main part!) was sub-par. It was dry and not very flavorful. It's supposed to be comfort food - it should have simple yet strong and familiar flavors, and it should be fatty enough to melt in your mouth. I am concerned that maybe Two Sparrows is fat-phobic. I want my food to be fried in real butter or animal fat, not cheap canola oil.  My companion had similar complaints about his meal - the flavors were not strong or creative enough to justify the price. But really, creativity is not the problem - it's satisfaction. This meal just did not satisfy the way that even cheap diner food can.  For all of this, it just wasn't worth the price. Breakfast for two (no sides, a non-alcoholic beverage each) came to almost $40 with tip. That's crazy for breakfast unless it's satisfying and memorable.",0.9901,0.749,0.183,0.068,0.6271121351766513
2011-10-23,4.0,"Let me begin by stating that I never patron restaurants during their bustling hours. I prefer to enjoy my meal when a space isn't packed full of strollers, ladies who brunch or the church choir. That said, I had a fantastic experience at 2 Sparrows. I went with a friend on a weekday, off-peak hours and the place was sparse. The decor is gorgeous and clean and our server did an excellent job at greeting us and explaining their menu items right down to each fresh ingredient they use. We began with coffee and fresh squeezed orange juice. Both were excellent. We were also informed that they'd be obtaining their liquor license which made us all the more apt to return. We split the maple and bacon donut. I must say it was rather large and in charge and the bacon was extremely salty. In this case it was balanced by the maple so it wound up being fairly good. Not certain I'd order it again but I'm glad I tried it. I ordered the pork belly sandwich as my main entree and it was fantastic. Again, the pork belly seemed a bit on the salty side but it was balanced by the other ingredients on the plate. I enjoyed the house made tater tots and ketchup as well. The portion size was perfect. I feel as though most breakfast joints over do it and leave me lethargic and ready for a nap rather than appropriately full and ready for a stroll. I really enjoyed my experience here and hope others will give them a try when the servers and kitchen can offer their best service and the masses aren't flooding through the doors and muddling it all up. It's no secret that the wait is long when a place is chock full of patrons. It's also no surprise that certain aspects of a new restaurant fly under the radar when the dining area is at capacity.  2 Sparrows, you are a welcome addition to the neighborhood.

We decided to try and grab a quick brunch today (Saturday), but we quickly discovered that like many of the trendy restaurants in this neighborhood, the wait to get in can be off-putting. This was also the case with 2 Sparrows. We put our name in, but the wait was around 1 hour long. I have been to a lot of breakfast/lunch restaurants in the area, but I have never had a wait of up to an hour! Nevertheless, we decided to give the place a chance and walk around the neighborhood a bit to kill some time. We were called almost exactly one hour later.  Once we were seated, the waiter took our order (Eggs Benedict with greens, and the Belly Sandwich along with sides of bacon and sausage). One hour later, we received our order without our sides (and we noticed few others around us who had ordered after us, received their meals before us). After having to essentially wait two hours for brunch (we were fast approaching late afternoon at this point), we found that the food was definitely not as good as other breakfast/lunch restaurants in the neighborhood (i.e. Francis, Melrose...). The coffee was really terrible, tasting very burnt, the only real positive thing about the meal was the freshly squeezed Orange Juice.  For the amount of time we had to wait, and the quality of the food, I think 2 Sparrows is very overpriced for what was delivered. The only reason I'm giving them two stars is because the service was very good. Now, I do understand that this place has not been open very long, and perhaps they are still breaking-in their kitchen staff.

A friend and I decided to share one thing from the breakfast menu and one thing from the lunch, plus the much talked-about maple-bacon donut.

The maple glaze and the bacon was fantastic though, and I'm willing to consider that the dough's saltiness was not intentional. If it is, that won't be a donut I'll order again. For breakfast we went with the pancakes with pear and they were delicious; everything I like a pancake to be (dense yet also fluffy, full-bodied vanilla flavor, able to be eaten without butter ), complete with warm maple syrup.  Our lunch option, the grilled three-cheese was intriguing and had the potential to be great but lacked in sufficient amount of cheese, plus the bread was incredibly greasy. The tator tots also had the potential to be fantastic but they too were greasy and had that distinct taste of oil that has been used too much and needs to be replaced. Either that or the fryer wasn't hot enough and the tots soaked up too much oil. The homemade ketchup was good and helped save the day for both the tots and grilled cheese. Overall, I'll be back to see if today's food errors were a one-off, but it was a disappointing first run, especially after an hour long wait.

They had a welcoming attitude and made a effort to come outside to check on people waiting. When my friend and I finally got sat, we started off with a maple & bacon doughnut. Mind you, the menu says doughnutS but for $5, it was ONE fried piece of dough. The maple glaze and bacon bit was amazing, but ONE, yikes! I ordered the Noodle Bowl and my friend ordered the Shrimp Grits. Grits was decent  with okay texture and flavor, but my noodle bowl was hardly like the description. I agree it did have ramen noodles with the egg, pork and scallions but the 'broth' was merely water with oil and 3 random chili flakes. It was beyond bland and tasteless. It was really bad. The ambiance was nice and the acoustics absorbed some of the sound which was nice. Even though the tables were situated really close together, I wasn't able to hear (not that I wanted to) other tables conversations.  There were other items on the menu I would try, but I'm in no rush to go back .",0.9726,0.814,0.149,0.037,0.577536231884058
2011-10-13,5.0,"My wife and I went to 2 Sparrows after it was recommended by a friend.  To start, we had the Maple Bacon Doughnut, which was absolutely amazing.  I had the Biscuits and Gravy and my wife had the Pork Belly Sandwich.  We were both thrilled with our food, both dishes were delicious, and we found ourselves taking multiple bites off each others plates.  The Tots were amazing, and these aren't Napoleon Dynamites tots, these are large gourmet hand-made Tots.  Awesome.  The service was friendly and fast, the decor is very modern and clean.  We also felt it is a great deal for the money.  We highly recommend to anyone who is looking for their new favorite breakfast/lunch spot in Lincoln Park.",0.9907,0.714,0.286,0.0,0.6575411255411255
2011-10-08,4.0,"I'm sitting on my couch at midnight on a Saturday (technically, Sunday) eating my leftover shrimp and grits from 2 Sparrows. I knew it tasted amazing when I ate it earlier in the day, but I was too full from other items on the menu to properly enjoy it. Now as I am eating it, Im kind of blown away. As a Southern girl raised on the Gulf Coast, I generally enjoy both the main components of this dish, but the flavor profile of the shrimp and grits here was spot on.  The reason I was too full to enjoy my main dish earlier was because  I sampled some other dishes on the menu during today's soft opening. The chicken sandwich from the lunch menu was great. The chicken was seasoned well and cooked perfectly. It was dressed with crispy onions (yum) and an apricot chutney which complemented the sandwich. I loooved the foie gras and cherry compote pop tart . I wanted to stuff them in my purse. Overall, I was very satisfied with my meal and look forward to going back once they are officially open.",0.9887,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.5066666666666666
