2017-07-26,5.0,"My SO & I were in the city for the weekend & usually on our way home we make a stop in Uptown to either eat or do some grocery shopping. This time, we did both. He leaves it up to me based on what he tells me he is craving so I can find a place. This day, he wanted some bon bu hue. I found this gem on Yelp & felt it was something to try because I wanted some pho. I'm usually picky with my pho & thought I found my best uptown pho spot, which is Uptown Pho, but this pho is definitely a runner up or pretty close to it. The bun bu hue was also definitely good! Very flavorful, with a lot of fixings. Didn't even need anything added. Now as far as my pho, the broth was very flavorful & the only thing they gave me to season was hoison & siracha. I had to add for the chili oil. Now honestly, even with those items & added some lime, it was yummy! I'm one of those that add a lot of different seasonings in my pho & if I would've known that's all they offer for those ingredients, I wouldn't have even wanted to try it, but this proved me wrong! We almost passed by it because it didn't really stick out, but it's nicely & modernly decorated inside & service was great.  This will be another option for us while in Uptown.",0.9873,0.836,0.142,0.022,0.571875

The dining area is bare bones, which is fine, and the prices are low.

2017-06-07,5.0,"I ate in argyle so many times but I rarely come into Hai yen. Recently, my sister dragged me here because she was craving their bo la lot (beef wrapped in a leaf that I don't know the name of). I'm pretty sure every Vietnamese person on argyle knows that Hai Yen is known for their bo la lot. We came in one night, ordered the wraps with bo la lot, and other Vietnamese dishes. Let me just say, it was so good that I came back two days later.  What you do is you wrap those beef in a spring wrap with veggies and whatever you want to put in it, and then dip it into fish sauce or mam nem (shrimp paste, fermented fish, pineapple, etc). TBH mam nem is the best thing to eat wraps with. But there's a bad smell to it, so if you can't take it, I suggest you going with the fish sauce. You do have the option of getting both or just one. The place is clean and the waiters are also nice. They are very generous with their veggies which I am so thankful for. The wraps are just not good if there isn't enough veggies and I'm glad the owner understands that.  I'll be coming here again soon!",0.9931,0.785,0.191,0.024,0.563562091503268
2017-06-03,3.0,This place was indeed hidden well. On the other side of the argyle train station toward the lake is where this location can be found. Since the street has been recently redone it does look better on that side of Argyle which I have hardly been on.  The inside of the location seems pretty nice. Can have maybe a party size of like 60 people.  Since the resturant isn't that huge.  The food there is mainly Vietnamese food and it was a nice experience. I mainly didn't order appetizers but my friends did and they got some intersting orders. One of them was basically a the material to make spring rolls and you had to do it yourself. So that was fun experience to do. I mainly ordered the typical pho noodles. Mm it was ok. Nothing really amazing about seems like any basic pho noodles.  The service was very nice. They were patience with the whole group I went with and because we called in the huge group they gave us a very slight discount on drinks.,0.9855,0.79,0.19,0.02,0.5543650793650794

We ordered the appetizer this place is known for (bo la lot) which is served with vegetables and rice wrapper. We also ordered fish clay pot with cat fish and salmon so hot and sour soup. Both fish types were fresh.  The only gripe I have is that the salmon soup was not hot enough to my tasting. The Malbec wine glass was only 4 bucks.  That's an added bonus since most Vietnamese restaurants don't serve wine.,0.5994,0.924,0.058,0.019,0.7000000000000001

The quality of the food tastes a lot like home cooked (main reason why I love this place so much). After eating out 5-6 days per week, sometimes it's nice to have a home cooked meal. We usually order the same dishes every single time; the beef salad, the Vietnamese sour soup, the catfish in the pot and the fried red snapper. The beef salad and the catfish are my all time favorite dishes and I would highly recommend this place to those who are in the area.  As for the restaurant itself. Used to be a little bit run down, however, they did some remodeling and now, the place is noice.

2017-05-14,4.0,"TIP: Link your credit card to Yelp and get 7% cash back if you pay the Hai Yen bill with the linked credit card. GREAT STUFF (so far until I try more):  - Ba la lot wrap ($14) - you wet the rice paper wrap, place flat on your plate, add your bo la lot/veggie/herb fillings, roll it up, dip in sauce, and nom nom nom! - Young banana blossom salad with shrimp ($10)  - Vietnamese iced coffee This is the type of Vietnamese food that I've been looking for outside the Bay Area! SKIP: - Pho - broth was lacking depth, soup was lukewarm and not hot enough to wilt the veggies. Go to Tank for pho. - Combo stir-fried flat rice noodle with shrimp, fish, chicken and veggies was super over sauced, had really over cooked, tough, dry meat. This was the worst dish I've had in Argyle. Service was cold and non-existent even though the restaurant was not that busy compared to its neighboring restaurants in Argyle. But all of its customers during my visit were Vietnamese so that was a good sign. It took them a long time to take our order, the server forgot one of our dishes even though she repeated it the order back to me, no water refills, and wouldn't respond when I called the server over for a to-go box for leftovers (so I had to go ask another server by the kitchen myself).

Most Vietnamese restaurants tend to have same kind of circle tables with uncomfortable chairs. Not this one! The interior was clean, open, and had comfy seating chairs. The only weird thing is that their menu is sheets of paper stapled together. We order rolls, seafood hot pot, and shrimp. The rolls were very tasty. It was just like 'summer rolls' but replace the shrimp with beef. My partner really enjoyed them surprisingly since he has that undividing love for summer rolls. Then, came out the hot pot! Why doesn't anyone hot pot anymore? They provide the raw meats to you, the broth, mini burner, and noodles. The broth was awesome. Most places would load it with so much oil that it would flim the top of the broth. Not this one. Out came the salt and pepper shrimp. I didn't know they would be breaded but the shrimp was still moist. I would probably say it was my favourite part of the meal. The service was standard which is good for a busy brunch hour.

Other than that, everything else is pretty average. The thing I disliked here is that they wouldn't let me order my sliced beef noodles with bun bo hue broth. They made it seem like a big deal that I said forget it. Appetizers like spring rolls and egg rolls were average. Papaya salad was not bad, but I definitely had better.

The pictures did not do us wrong, because we did really enjoy this dish. The broth is tomato based with a slight crab flavor. It was not fishy at all and the ground up meat accompanying the the chunks of soft and flavorful tomato was delicious! Overall, this was a very good dish and makes me interested in trying the other Bun Rieu from other Vietnamese restaurants to compare. The Vermicelli with Sausage wrapped in Hawaiian leaf was very good! The fish sauce on the side used to pour on top flavored the dish. The noodles were plentiful and not overly cooked or undercooked. The veggies made this one of the more healthy dishes. The real star were the sausages! They were sweet, smoky, and very delicious.

I watch as multiple waiters and waitresses clean up other tables, get menus for another party, and walk around the vicinity of my table. They did absolutely nothing to even acknowledge me.

He gave the most half-assed apology I've ever received. By now you would think that since they've apologized, they'd be more attentive to me. Absolutely not. In fact, I actually saw a party that came  before me get seated, have the waiter take their order and the food come in ALL BEFORE I even got to order. Or rather, I would say if I had got the opportunity to order. I've had bad service but this honest to god was the worst I've ever received. No hyperbole here.  You know what the problem was? I think I had it figured out: I came alone. I saw other groups get inexplicably faster service even though they came much later than I did. This is unacceptable on all fronts. In the end. I walked out. Normally I wouldn't even write a review without tasting the food... but I wasted at least 45 minutes just waiting for them to get their act together. You could argue that I should have flagged them down earlier (keep in mind, I DID DO SO at the halfway point) and that I should have taken more initiative, but I disagree. The overall response I got was of indifference even after I expressed disappointment for the lack of service. No, screw that. This deserves the lowest rating I can give. I don't care how good the food is supposed to be. I felt outright disrespected.",-0.988,0.787,0.073,0.14,0.5111449864498644

The chicken curry was also pretty good with moist chunks of chicken breast, taro, potato, and carrot in a fatty-but-tingling yellow Thai curry broth, but I couldn't help but feel that the flavor tasted like something out of a jar.  Maybe I'm totally off base here but although it did taste good, the sodium content was way off the charts meaning there was either too heavy a hand with the fish sauce (or salt or soy sauce), or there was just something jarred about it.

2014-07-27,3.0,"I came here with a Vietnamese friend for what he promised was the best ""crispy pancake"" ever. (Not that I would have a chance in hell of knowing the difference.) he apparently comes to Hai Yen a lot and knows the owners so our service was pretty good. We started with the special cocktail, spiked limeade which was a little on the sweet side. we ordered 4 fat spring rolls to start. Made of incredibly fresh veggies and a decent amount of shrimp in each, these were awesome. Also got the Vietnamese marinated grilled beef which came with fresh rice paper for rolling and 2 plates of lettuce w/ fresh veggies, mint and cilantro leaves, and marinated carrots, onions, and lotus slaw to put on top. You put the raw beef in the pot for grilling then assemble your own roll with all the veggies and stuffings. Good luck getting it to your mouth w/out spilling all over your outfit. TIP: DO NOT WEAR WHITE HERE. I dumped about 1/4 of all I ate down the front of me during the course of the meal. Entrees were the crispy pancake stuffed with shrimp and bamboo shoots. This came with lettuce leaves you could use to wrap the pancake in and for dipping in the spicy sauce. The lotus salad was probably my favorite dish of everything. Sweet, spicy and crunch, with cilantro, lotus root, carrots, cabbage and shrimp, it was great. Overall, it was a very good meal with TONS of fresh veggies and protein options. The only really downside was walking into Hai Yen you are hit in the face by the overpowering smell of fish sauce. If I were alone, I would have turned around and left. It was seriously gross. After I curbed my gag reflex I (kinda) got used to it enough to stand it for the next hour of eating. However, I was not sad to walk back out into the fresh air when I left !!!!

I'm torn between wanting to come here again because the food was just that good but the service was just that bad. I came here on a Sunday night with a group of 7 around 9pm. My first problem: I stood around by the door for a good 15 minutes with no one acknowledging me or saying anything despite passing me. I could also see that there were patrons who were wanting to pay and were near the cash register but also no one was acknowledging them. I figured it was them being busy so I didn't think much of it. My family and I sat down and were perusing the menu for a good 20 minutes. No one ever came by to ask us if we were ready to order despite no one having their menu open. We had to track down someone who had to find someone else to take our order - sounded messed up to me but again, trying to take this experience in stride.  The rest of the evening just continued to be similar. I felt like we were ignored. Just simply a group of 7 sitting in the middle of the restaurant. After our order was taken, our food came out unevenly - one entree came...then 5 minutes another 2 came...then 10 minutes another 3 came...I did not understand how a bowl of pho that already has pre-made broth and noodles takes almost 40 minutes to place on our table. Everything that we ordered from drinks to side dishes took us asking them twice before they brought it out to us. At one point, we ordered a extra side of raw beef for pho and the cook had put it straight into the wrong bowl of pho...when we brought this to the attention of our waitress, she simply asked ""Ohhhh, I thought you wanted it. Can't you just take out the extra beef and give it to the other person who wanted it."". SERIOUSLY?????? WOW...just wow...owners if you're reading this and you should, you need to train your waiters and waitresses to be more diplomatic and professional. I know it's Argyle but service should not be like this ANYWHERE. Needless to say, I felt like I was working by eating at this restaurant.  It's like they had no leadership or organization in this restaurant and the waiters were working hard but not in an effective way.

Next we received the papaya salad which was finished by the time the snapper, vermicelli dish, and beef fondue arrived. But we still hadn't received our drinks so I flagged down another waitress who was very helpful and got the drinks out right away. (But it's a little late when your main dishes have arrived) Unfortunately I did need to point out that while we had received the main ingredients to the beef fondue(meat/veggies/spring roll wrapper), they hadn't yet brought out the broth to cook everything in. She acknowledged that and had the broth brought out right away. The snapper was a little too crunchy and the filler was a little dry because of it, the ingredients of the vermicelli bowl were fresh but the noodles were a little overcooked, and the beef fondue was not as great as I had remembered it from previous visits. The service was a bit all over the place and while I would like to visit again, I would be hesitant to do so since it took two hours to get all our food and leave. My parents were good sports this time around, but I think it's a bad sign when you've asked for your check and 5 minutes pass by and you have to walk yourself over to the cashier to ask for it and hurry up the process.

2014-01-25,4.0,"When driving to Argyle, my friends presented me with a choice.  Quick eats or quality eats. Being that my hunger was manageable (and that I had never been here before) I choose the latter, and it slowly became a very eventful night.  They referred to this place as the 7 ways beef. And after a brief explanation, I was game. As if 7 different beef dishes wasn't enough, we also added 2 appetizers to a table soon to be filled with food. Being that the weather was pretty rough, there was little to no wait and the food service was excellent. Here's what we had.  Iced Coffee - it was definitely strong in both of the crucial ingredients. The coffee itself is strong and bold, and the condensed milk is applied very generously. Might want to wait for the ice to melt a bit before taking big sips. But it was expected.  Goi Cuon Fresh Spring Rolls - it was definitely above average.  The rolls were tight and had a good mixture of meat/vermicelli/veggies. The dipping sauce was probably what made it above average.  Bahn Xeo Vietnamese Crepe - this was probably the biggest let down of the meal (there weren't very many). I think it has more to do with having had many different places that offered better versions. This Bahn Xeo was not as tasty or prepared as crispy as I'm used to. So I left a bit disappointed.  7 ways beef - 2 orders for 3 people  Salad - there were slices of beef tossed in a carrot and radish salad to start our meal off. It had a vinegar base and most likely had fish sauce as well and really kicked things off well. It was both refreshing and delicious. At this point they brought out lots of veggies to make rice wraps with the meat they were about to bring out. So basically you dip the rice wrap into the water to soften it up, add veggies/meat, and the wrap to dip in the fish sauce.  Fondue - it was like having a little mini hotpot strictly for a few slices of beef. It was interesting, but nothing amazing. Kind of like the pho without the noodles.  Meatball - was pretty flavorful but might have been overshadowed by the other stronger tasting meats.  Hawaiian leaf beef - this was really good, and kind of made the entire experience really enjoyable. I think eating it alone would've been a bit too much, but wrapping it in the rice paper and adding veggies to supplement the strong flavor made it a great combination.   Beef sausage - it was kind of similiar to the leaf beef, but I think the leaf beef did more for me. It wasn't bad at all, just maybe overshadowed.  Lemongrass beef - I thought it was a bit rough, but it was a nice alternative to the bold flavors of the sausage and the leaf beef. Probably something you want to eat right away before it gets time to cool. Beef Congee - it reminded me of the congee my aunt used to make (Tze Zhou style), where the rice is not full broken down and the broth and rice are seperate. I was never a big fan of that growing up, but this works well at the end of a big meal. The warm, sweet broth and rice almost soothes your stomach into submission.   Overall, this place is a sweet find if you have time to experience all 7 ways of the beef. I'm sure their less epic offerings are good as well, but when you have time its worth exploring. It's not terrible on the wallet ($24 a piece after tax and tip with three people).

2013-08-21,5.0,I don't want to say too much about this place for fear of it getting too busy. At any rate here I go. This is a great Vietnamese  joint. Most of the Vietnamese places I have been to I don't feel like they care about me being there. Maybe the older Vietnamese restauranteurs acted this was forever? Either way they are super nice here and were very helpful with the menu selections. The food is always top notch. They have these sort of mini meat rolls that are rolled in seaweed and grilled. They taste so darn good I could eat like 20-30 of them. We felt at home here and have been here many times. It is so worth checking out. When you walk in you think that its going to be old or average but the food is top notch. Don't be fooled. Go eat your hearts content and when you see the bill your not floored. Very inexpensive.

First, I usually order beef and meatball pho.  When you order Pho, you have to expect it to lose a lot of the temperature needed to really cook the meat.  You must immediately reheat to a near boil.  Then add the meat, noodles and fixings (jalapeno, super fresh herbs, bean sprouts, lime, hoisin and sriracha). Next, I like to order bun, which is a vermicelli salad.  I always order with thin grilled beef, which is seasoned perfectly, egg roll and if I am feeling it, grilled shrimp.  The ""salad"" also comes with fresh cucumbers, bean sprouts, lettuce and carrots.  It also comes with peanuts, but I typically ignore those.  I do not like peanuts in my food.  To finish, it comes with a fish sauce that really compliments the dish. Finally, I have tried some other dishes and side dishes and each, from what I can remember, were good quality and delicious.

2012-12-12,5.0,"I had an absolutely fantastic meal here last night with two friends.  With all the choices on Argyle, we felt super lucky that we chose Hai Yen, because every bite of food made us feel so glad that we had ordered it! Two of us came early and waited a while for our third friend, and the servers were really nice about it and brought us tea with little slices of lemon peel at the bottom - so delicious on a freezing night.  Once our friend came by, we started deciding what to order.  Enter Rashid - probably the most helpful server I have ever had at a restaurant like this.  Ridiculously friendly, he asked all of us about our tastes and preferences, and made great recommendations all around. We started with the Bo La Lot, three pieces of ground meat formed into a sausage and steamed in a green leaf, served with a dipping sauce.  As everyone has said, they were delicious, and not something we would've thought to order without all the recommendations, so thanks Yelpers!  Everyone immediately wished there were more of them, but we had lots of other food coming so no time to fret! Next we got the Banh Xeo, a rice flour crepe filled with shrimp and bean sprouts - it was supposed to have pork too, but I didn't see any!  It was served with lettuce, fresh basil, fresh mint, some pickled carrots, and a tangy dipping sauce.  This was really hard to eat, fell apart as we cut it into three pieces, and I was bummed about the apparent lack of pork and total overload of bean sprouts.  However, when you get a bite of crepe, shrimp, sprout, herbs, lettuce, and pour dipping sauce over it - that stuff was GOOD.  I felt it really needed the sauce, and was a bit bland without it, but everything together was a really excellent bite of food.  Only thing that could've improved it was...pork!  haha. So my friend got the tamarind soup and beef kabobs.  She wanted a small soup (to pair with the kabobs) but they brought her a large and it was HUGE, so they brought bowls for all of us to share.  My other friend ate so much tamarind soup that she barely touched her shrimp noodles.  I got a noodle soup, which I'm not sure was on the menu - the server went and spoke with the chef about what would be best that day, and what I got was a steaming hot bowl of light, clean herbal broth that was thicker than most broth, filled with slurpable rice noodles, laced with delicate crab meat, and dotted with pork meatballs.  The addition of cilantro, and a small bowl of fish sauce with chopped thai chiles that the server brought me was just what the dish needed.  That stuff was absolutely delicious and soul-warming.  I tried the tamarind soup briefly, it was very interesting and a cool spin on the usual hot and sour soup, but I preferred my dish.  It was so hot I practically burned my tongue eating it!  My eyes watered a bit when I got a Thai chile on my tongue so if you order those, watch out!  But the broth is totally bland and needs something if you want a spice kick. Prices were really reasonable.  Only $8 for my beautiful bowl of goodness!  Rashid asked for all of our names and chatted with us briefly and told us about an upcoming food/wine pairing dinner at Hai Yen.  He was just such a great, knowledgeable server.  You should ask for him if you go there.  I would ask for him if I came back! This was one of the best meals I've ever had at a restaurant like this (like, an inexpensive, non-fancy place that also does takeout and delivery of Asian food).  Just like Rosded is my favorite cheap Thai, this is my new favorite Vietnamese.  Beeline here if you're on Argyle!",0.9989,0.787,0.186,0.028,0.5818187123334181
2012-12-10,5.0,"I tried Hai Yen's new tasting menu with wine/cocktail pairings Saturday, and it was an absolutely sublime experience. By any standard, it's the best tasting menu I've had. Whether comparing it to the ""molecular gastronomy"" of Moto, or to the ""fine Mexican"" of Sol de Mexico, this tour of Hai Yen's wide ranging menu proves their ability to transcend - fully and completely - the low expectations that can sometimes dog my adventures in Argyle or Chinatown. Don't get me wrong - they do Argyle/Vietnamese staples fantastically well. This is now my go-to place for Bahn Mi because the bread is so fresh and flavorful, while the vegetables that come with it so arresting in their flavors. If you're not afraid of spice, the hot peppers in these can burn your tongue off - in the best way possible (my wife picks them out). I particularly like the steamed pork sausage and the lemongrass beef. And it's this earthiness and down home simplicity that's really on display in the tasting menu - where a simple tamarind broth (expertly paired by Rashed, their sommelier, mixologist and all-around cruise director) became a surprise with every bite. With the palette evolving with the wine between the broth, vegetables, tomato and shrimp - each becoming an unexpected locus of startling flavor with each spoonful. This was followed up with an appetizer again paired flawlessly with a sparkling white that brought out the snap in every single crunch of bean sprout. It was a beginning to a meal that set incredibly high expectations that had to be met and cleared. Which it did, in my opinion, with room to spare. A couple of courses in, both me and my former work buddy Janet were both stuffed with food and a little woozy from the generous wine ""tasting portions."" And yet the food kept coming. The real highlight for me was the steamed seabass - with a sauce that I would dare anyone not to soak rice in and keep going until it's all gone. And yet as flavorful as it was, and as much as it was finely made, it didn't necessarily trigger for me the countless Cantonese restaurants in Singapore and Hong Kong that I've been to that can do this flawlessly. Rather it reminded me to my mom's home cooking - of how she would make it for dinner, and sometimes have leftovers for lunch, waiting for me when I would come back from school, she having picked out the bones, even as I would attend more to the book I was reading than to her or the food. I don't now remember what I read as I sweated from walking in the heat, head above the steaming food, but I remember that taste of fish in rich savory sauce. By the time the tasting menu got to the short ribs, I was full to the point of being beyond eating, and yet, after a couple of bites, I couldn't stop myself from tearing each piece of short rib off the bone with my teeth and fingers, scooping the sauce up with the lettuce leaf below, and licking each digit clean after. Yet the most unexpected part was still to come - for all this, course after generous course of superb cuisine (most of the last two dishes Janet had to take away), and each with its own wine or cocktail, the total bill came up to a total of $60 a person. If I had gone to say Saigon Sisters downtown - first of all the food would not have been at this level, and they would have charged half again as much just for that - before the alcohol at double or triple the price. More than anything else - the tasting menu here is a steal. Too good to be true, and you'd best take advantage of it before some fairy god-mother in too-tight Spanx waves her glitter wand goodbye to this impossible fantasy. What you have to understand is that none of this takes place in an ultra modern space of pristine white, steel, glass, or wood paneling. It happens in a slightly aged place on Argyle across the alley from a Vietnamese supermarket and the other sundry gaudily lighted stores surrounding it. Yet the place feels cared for, spotless, and without rough edges - if they had existed, worn down with use and years. It was close to Christmas, so the season's music was playing, yet it wasn't booming or blaring like I've heard of Tank Noodle, nor was the ultimately very depressing 10 year old pop standards of the day on a relentless loop like at Pho 777. There'll be people who pre-judge this place because of where it is, its outward appearance or its decor. But if you come here with good company for good company, and you're looking to have it enhanced with impeccably cooked food - made with care and feeling, paired with beverages that exhibit an unmatched understanding of the elemental flavors of Vietnamese and Asian foods - this is the only place in Chicago I'd ever recommend going to, and spending a very enjoyable quartet of hours being reminded of home.",0.9975,0.869,0.113,0.018,0.48798335738335746

A couple of years back the wife ordered this dish at a Vietnamese place out in Oregon.  Even though we'd lived a number of years in New Orleans, where we frequently ate Vietnamese food, we'd either overlooked or never encountered bo la lot.   Anyway, a great discovery.  Bo la lot is quite a bit like a Vietnamese version of dolmas/grape leaves:  a spicy beef mixture or sausage rolled inside little lalot leaves.  Fragrant, savory, and just slightly sweet, it can be delicious.  The reason we chose Hai Yen on this visit to the Argyle strip was the presence of bo la lot on the menu.  (And because it had solid Yelp reviews.) So why the hell did I order pho dac biet as an entree instead of ba la lot?  Mindless force of habit, I reckon, because I'm a pho addict and don't get to have it very often in the town where we now live.  Anyway, it was a mistake:  This was a subaverage bowl of pho, with tough, overcooked beef flank and a rather pallid broth.  I must give credit for an extra fresh and bountiful garnishes, though.  And it was a generous serving for $7.50. We did order bo la lot as an appetizer.  And it was excellent.  There just wasn't enough of it. Service was good, but not great.   For whatever reason--and FWIW--the ratio of Caucasians to Asians seems higher than at most restaurants in this corner of Uptown.  I should note that the decor at this Argyle location is not nearly as slick as that depicted on Hai Yen's website, which must be the Clark location.

We've had a few minor bad experiences with orders wrong, items missing, and late delivery times, but the place has always made it right. Until now. Our 18 mo daughter is allergic/intolerant to MSG. Within an hour she violently throws up and it's a nightmare.  We love Asian food but as you can imagine, this severely limits where we can eat from. However, we've always been able to order from here via grubhub a light chicken and veggie dish (and I follow up with a call) asking for NO MSG. Whenever I order, I specify it is for a child with an allergy and it's never been a problem since by now they know us from ordering so often.... before about two weeks ago.  Grubhub when I told them what I think happened (that there was MSG), called them. The manager acknowledged that they made my daughter's dish with no MSG but the cook knowing this THEN put a sauce with MSG in it on her food. And sent it out.  All I knew was my kid was suddenly terribly ill. Hai Yen couldn't even explain why they did this except the manager said to the person at grubhub they thought nothing bad would happen. Like I was weekly asking ONE dish to be made this way via order and phone call on a whim???? Even grubhub was stunned that they admitted this to them. Grubhub's legal department contacted us to follow up and took all this very seriously! The manager from Hai Yen told grubhub they would follow up with us with a phone call. We're not looking to sue or anything, but we CERTAINLY did expect at LEAST an apology from a place we've ordered from for years. Never got one. They've done nothing.  Grubhub is as shocked as we are and we will never order from here again. BTW all their soups and everything else in the menu has MSG (and we know this so our daughter never eats what we eat).

They serve all of the cuts of meat that you would expect in an authentic pho joint - tendons, tripe, round, flank, etc. - which I think is a good indicator of whether it will be any good.

2012-01-03,5.0,"Good stuff. The relatives in Chicago always recommend this place as their go-to spot. Amusingly, I thought of gentrification when I walked in, because there were definitely more white folks than Asians, at least when I went. (I saw the review by Binh below- I do know what she is saying with Asian restaurants giving more preferential attention to white patrons over Asian/Asian-American patrons. On our visit, the wait staff was fine to my uncle and me - not overly friendly or as chatty as I saw with some other non-Asian tables, but attentive enough and competent in serving food and meeting requests, so I can't make any conclusive judgments. Was good enough and better attention than other Viet restaurants I've been to in the past). Anyhow, it's mainly the food that's to be reviewed, and for that, I would say it's definitely a spot to hit up for tasty Vietnamese food. Good traditional options, too. It was hard to choose. 7 course beef (you should always try this specialty if going to a good Vietnamese restaurant) was pretty good for sampling. A lil pricier at $18 (additional $2 if an additional person is sharing) but a good specialty. Ca kho to - fish cooked in a clay pot - was yummy. Might be sweet for some folks' tastes, but I liked it (I had the catfish ca kho to). They also had a sweet holiday deal for $2.50 banh mi (usually $3.50). I liked that bo lot was an option. So was chao tom (sugar cane sweetened shrimp). I didn't get to the sandwiches til much later that eve so they were in the cold and in a bag for a while so I can't be a good judge since eating it cold is not the ideal experience. I ate the bo nuong - beef - one and it was pretty good. Maybe will try another time fresh. Note that they put in jalapenos, so if you don't like spicy, ask for them to leave those out when you order. I would eat here again. Right off Argyle, so it's also convenient. I also like that they offer side orders of take-out like grilled beef by the pound (grilled beef aka bo nuong and pork cooked Vietnamese style is always likable).

Squeeze in some lime, mix in a little plum sauce and fiery sriracha and its the perfect winter lunch. I sat and ate my soup in the window, steaming up the glass. Two glasses of wine and an empty bowl later I ventured back out into the cold gray winter streets, full of pho and inner warmth. Fantastic.",0.9042,0.855,0.112,0.033,0.5476190476190477

2011-01-10,3.0,"My review is based pretty much solely on the food I had at Hai Yen. I have to admit that our service was pretty sketchy but it was a crazy night. There were several large parties the evening we dined. We all knew this going into it. I think we all learned a lesson that night.  That said, I thought the food at Hai Yen was pretty good. Being the meat eater that I am, I decided to go for the 7 courses of beef. That's right, SEVEN COURSE OF BEEF muther truckers! The cost for this insanity? Fifteen dollars! Now, I have to say if you are thinking you are going to be served courses of beef individually seven times, you're not.  We started off with a trio of beef appetizers. We all dug the beef wrapped in a Hawaiian leaf as well as the beef skewers. The meatball was our least favorite however when dipped in the broth that was brought to the table (we'll get to that in a bit) it was much better. We were also served a beef and mango salad which was really delicious. We were brought soup. We also dined on rice crepees which is where the broth comes in.  Raw thinly sliced beef is brought to your table along with a steaming pot of broth for you to cook your beef. Fixins' are also brought to your table such as the rice paper, variety of herbs & veggies and sauces. I really enjoyed this course of the meal. Somehow we missed the fondue course. I'm not sure what happened. It was OK though b/c we had ordered appetizers - spring rolls and more Hawaiian leaf wrapped beef (so good!).  Hai Yen is not BYOB but you can bring booze for a corkage fee? I think? I'm not really sure how it works. We brought booze, we drank, we drank some more...and then we drank some more so we were happy. I thought the food was pretty solid at Hai Yen and I would definitely go back for some more of that beef mango salad and those rolls.... and now, to the tune of ""Hey Jude"".... Hai Yen, it wasn't bad I ate your beef rolls And I felt be-tt-er Remember, banh uot isn't a sin Then you begin, to make it better Better! Better!

That is why I ended choosing #28-ish that indicates hot & spicy from the ""Traditional"" section on the menu.  Needless to say, I don't recommend the 7 course beef dinner its just not what I expected. In addition, I don't recommend this place for extremely large groups, don't get me wrong the waiters do a great job but they just could do so much.

I ordered the banh bot loc and the banh beo and banh bot loc combo.. It sucked but was edible. The banh bot loc sucked the most, they didn't know how to wrap it so it was these long logs that were rolled. WTF. They're also suppose to be a little chewy- these were really soft and just not great. The sauce needed more fish sauce because it was on the bland side. Now that my curiosity is satisfied, I would never order these again. I also ordered the hu tieu mi my tho dac biet, (soup with clear noodles and a bunch of stuff in it, with tomato sauce) which was ok but satisfying cuz it wasn't bland and had lots if meat- but took forever to come out. I had to ask them about it as my dinner companion was finishing up their entree already. WTF. I hate that. Plus it said it came with a quail egg, but mine didn't have one, I looked. Anyway, I would like to give the place another chance and try other stuff like the vietnamese crepes and vietnamese bbq but service was slow as fuck and too bad they didn't have the usual Vietnamese condiments already at the table like most restaurants do. Because this would save the annoyance of trying to flag down a server for their attention. It takes a long ass time to get their attention, we tried multiple times.  I wasn't all that impressed and there's no need to go out of your way for this place. It's barely average at best.

2010-09-14,4.0,"We set out to the Uptown location (not as upscale as the one on Clark Street) to what is known as the ""Little Hanoi"" strip on Argyle. Lots of ethnic restaurants and little shops with Buddhas lined the street. We entered Hai Yen and were immediately greeted by a friendly waitress. The restaurant was very clean and welcoming, decorated with many plants and pictures.  It was pretty busy for lunch, but we didn't have to wait for a table, a pleasant surprise on a Sunday. The crowd was a mix of larger families dining at large, round tables in the center of the restaurant, while couples lined the smaller, outer tables. There were instrumental ""love songs"" playing softly in the restaurant, and this soon became an amusing 'name that tune' activity throughout our meal - Celine Dion, Whitney Houston anyone?  I looked around and figured that by the looks of everyone's overflowing plates, this place must serve huge portions so I was going to pass on an appetizer and focus on navigating my way through the 100+ item menu. Fortunately all of the dishes and ingredients were listed in both Vietnamese and English. Given the fact that I'm a picky eater who takes little risks with food, I was predictable and naturally skipped traditional Vietnamese fare such as the pho and opted for item #66 -TOM XAO LA QUE - Basil Beef, which came with sautéed onions, basil and hot peppers, along with steamed vegetables served with a side of rice.  We waited a while for our meals to come (by this point, the restaurant seating was pretty much full). Our meals came and the portions were so large that we could barely fit all of our plates and fixings on the table (I blame Dave since 70% of the table was his stuff).  The Basil Beef was splendid. The beef was cut into bite-sized pieces and was very tender, marinated in a tasty sweet/spicy marinade. The vegetables were also very fresh and tasty, and the white rice was piping hot and fluffy. I liked that the rice was served in a separate container so I could add it to the beef/veggie mix as I pleased.  The waitress was very nice and even asked if I wanted some extra rice since I was running low. Our water was also filled regularly the entire time which I appreciated since my meal was a bit spicy.  Overall, Hai Yen had tasty food, and large servings all for a very affordable price. Yes, the service was a little slow, we were in no rush and the environment was very comfortable and casual so it wasn't that big of a deal.

2010-07-19,4.0,"Before we came here I was silently despairing for Vietnamese restaurants in Chicago.  Both places we went previously, both highly recommended and lauded by Yelpers, were either average or disappointing, so I was about to slink back to Denver with my tail between my legs and announce to Denver Yelp that it should feel lucky for its fantastic Vietnamese food. Hai Yen changed my mind (well, Denver should still feel lucky, but Chicago has put forth a strong contender).  Its lotus root salad was incredibly well balanced, which is very hard to do when something contains both mint and cilantro.  Neither of these herbs overpowered the salad.  Delicious strips of shrimp and tender meat were scattered through the salad and it was all accompanied by an especially tangy fish sauce. The pho broth was the best I've had anywhere.  I could have happily drunk it plain.  But we ordered the special with everything, so it was garnished with about a million different cuts of beef (the only thing I couldn't find was tendon, but my dad said he ate it all by accident so I assume it was good).  The beef was thinly sliced, not tough like it can easily get.  The tripe was gathered in manageably small clumps so it didn't get stuck in your throat like it can easily do.  Whoever arranged this bowl of pho was clearly thinking about the comfort of the eater rather than some purely aesthetic presentation of the bowl.  It also came with a pre-arranged dipping bowl of sriracha and hoisin instead of having the bottles on the table, which was a little weird, but okay. Our third dish was salt and pepper shell-on shrimp, which is the only reason this wasn't a five star place for me.  The shrimp was not that fresh.  Not bad-tasting by any means, but blandly not fresh, and that makes all the difference in a delicately spiced shrimp dish like this.  It would have been perfect otherwise, with the frying somehow softening the shells but not overcooking the shrimp or being too heavy on the fry coat.  My favorite part was eating the garlicky crunchy shrimp legs - yum! Afterwards we refreshed with an avocado-jackfruit smoothie and a pineapple-mango-coconut smoothie.  Out waiter was nice enough to give my dad's girlfriend a sample of the guanabana smoothie before she committed to ordering it, which was good because guanabana turned out to be soursop (I only know it by that name) and, well, soursop is one of the only things on Earth I don't like.  Each smoothie comes with some cuts of random fresh fruit on top.  Mine was watermelon, honeydew, canteloupe, and mango. This was one of those meals where you feel fantastic after you're done, even if you're really really full.  For me that's the sign of a perfectly balanced meal.  I'd come back all the time if I lived here.",0.9954,0.766,0.164,0.07,0.6533870214752567

My boyfriend called ahead for reservations, because he knew that the place was going to be packed. First thing I noticed when I was going in, decent amount of people, but only like a table or two with white people, and a few here and there of Vietnamese people. With that said, the interior looked like an upscale version of a pho place, but that's basically where it stopped. I was kind of irritated with the service; the table behind us, sitting near the window was kind of loud and obnoxious. For one thing, there were two guys that kept walking back and forth from the kitchen to that specific table, either they knew the owners or they worked there but were on their off time. Another thing was that the girls could NOT shut up, and kept going on their random in and out of Cantonese, Mandarin, Vietnamese and REALLY broken English. I really wanted to say something and see if they talked shit back and whipped out my Los Angeles ghetto arse attitude, but just basically said to my boyfriend out loud in Cantonese that they were ditzy and the bad kind of ditzy. My boyfriend told me about the seven courses of beef, and I thought at first, ""OMG, seven different places of beef. I think I'm going to have Mad Cow disease after all of this."" But it turned out to be seven ways of how the restaurant prepares the beef. Because service kind of sucked, we often got our food last, even though we ordered before the bigger table. * The beef salad reminded me of the Vietnamese vermicelli, without the egg roll. My boyfriend claims that the beef was prepared with lime juice, but I felt like the beef was boiled. * The other five beef plates were the rice paper spring rolls. Didn't really like the beef with peanuts; felt it was a little on the dry side. Did love the little beef rolls. They should have given a little less rice wrapper and more veggies. * The rice porridge with ground beef was something I was not used to. Seemed like all they did was took the leftover rice cooker rice that was stuck on the bowl, poured some water to rinse it, and served it.

But really, spring rolls are hard to mess up. Also ordered a bun dish. The presentation was interesting... all deconstructed on a plate. It looked really cool but it was hard to eat. The grilled pork had a fantastic flavor and overall it was a decent dish. We also had a stir-fried wide noodle dish and that was tasty. Overall, the food was good but the service was pretty lacking. There were only about 3 tables in there being served and our waiter didn't come back to check on us until we flagged down another waiter.

2010-02-14,5.0,"Welcome, Year of the TIGER! In Vietnamese tradition, Tet is the biggest and most important holiday of the year. Things blow up in epic proportion with a non-stop array of firecrackers. I decided to spend Tet with my family for a dinner at our favorite Argyle restaurant, Hai Yen! I knew something was amiss when there was a family of nearly ten people blocking the door waiting for a table. Every table in the restaurant was taken and we were lucky to call ahead to hold a table. We arrived and the busboy was busy at work cleaning up the table and there was a small reserved sign on the table: reserved for us, booyaw!! We ordered the five course menu and I added some hot and sour soup and crispy egg noodles with seafood into the mix. Whenever my family eats at Hai Yen, the folks tend to go overboard ordering the same food over and over again, so I had to switch for a change of pace. The goi bo salad came out and it is a shredded vegetable salad with a dab of sourness and I watched everyone devour theirs. My hot and sour soup came out quickly and I slurped on my delicious soup with great texture while everyone chitchatted.  Vietnamese fondue consists of a small pot on a burner on the table, raw meat, a healthy dose of veggies and of course rice paper to get your rolls going. You take the flat round eye steak and dip it into the fondue pot and watch it cook. After the steak is ready, you dip your rice paper in water to soften and loosen it up.  The next step is the fun part: Stuff your roll to the brim with steak, mint leaves, lettuce, cucumber, and roll it up! Use the water to seal it up and hope nothing rips! The untrained will have stuffed too much ripping the paper and having a roll looser than a bad sushi buffet! An expert roll will look like a spring roll, full of nutritious veggies and fondued steak ready for hunger killing bites! Too many veggies? Well no worries! There is bo la lot, some heavily marinated beef in sausage form grilled over flame to give it that extra fresh from the BBQ flavor. The meat is smoky and should whet your appetite if you are part of the anti-veggie committee. Following bo la lot comes bo bi tet which is marinated steak on a stick equally smoky and ready to rock your socks. In between they will chuck you some big curled potato tasting crispy things. If you are unfamiliar, these crisps are actually shrimp chips. YUM. To conclude, you get Vietnamese rice porridge after all this veggie and meat eating! By leaps and bounds if you like vegginess and need the flame cooked meats, you will do well to get the Beef 5-Dish special!  While everyone else was frenzying their 5-Dish Beef, I was working slowly at my seafood crispy egg noodles with glee. A giant heaping of stir fried veggies and seafood on top of a giant nest of egg noodles greeted me. Crispy, chock full of flavor and giving me veggies and seafood, I was happy that they can make one of my favorite dishes gracefully. The seafood eggrolls were legit, but by this point I was too full from everything!! The service is great and you get a fresh pot of tea when you sit down. The water is refilled at a great clip even on Tet when the restaurant is jam packed to the brim (and understaffed since it is a high holiday!!!). We passed our Tet in great fashion with a two hour dinner and a nice night of eating and being a family: the way it should be. One last thing I failed to mention: Hai Yen is BYOB!!!!

2009-12-27,4.0,"Ahh...my first Yelp review.  Hai Yen is located on Argyle in ""Vietnamtown"" as I call it. There are many Vietnamese and southeast Asian restaurants, stores, and bodega-type shops on this stretch of road. There is plenty of street parking (Pay to Park boxes) for Hai Yen and the other places in this area. This restaurant has a good amount of tables and a friendly, attentive staff. The menu is easy to follow and understand as everything is numbered with each item having a short but accurate description. The menu at this location is HUGE and has over 100 items on it. My personal favorite is the #71 (BO LUC LAC: Tender cubes of filet mignon marinated in red wine and sauteed in butter and garlic, served over a bed of watercress.) as well as the appetizer #1 (BO LA LOT (3 pcs): Grilled marinated beef wrapped in an aromatic Hawaiian leaf.). The 71 comes on a huge plate with big chunks of beef (not sure if its actually filet mignon, but still good beef nonetheless) and tons of onion, watercress, and cucumber resting under the beef. I definitely recommend this item for someone who doesn't like traditional Chinese food as it is basic but still very tasty. Sometimes the food takes a while to prepare (my roommate and I waited about 20 minutes after ordering until our food arrived) but it is well worth it.  Average menu item at Hai Yen is about $8-15, so you won't be spending too much if you're looking to go on a date. This place has a very small bar (not many options) and they gave me a can and glass when I ordered a Coke, so its not a fancy or deluxe restaurant by any means (but still clean and well-kept!). There are plenty of tables for two as well as big round tables for groups of 5+. I definitely recommend this restaurant for a low key relaxing meal. It is almost a hidden gem of Uptown/Edgewater as no one I went with had ever heard of it.

As you can probably figure out, that's what I ordered when I came here the last time. (I came here at least twice). Their spring rolls are delicious. The lotus salad with shrimp crackers (I think that's what you'd call them?) are very, very delicious. Reminds me of the Vietnamese food I ate in San Jose back in California.  The canh chua is good, but it's not as good at the one they serve a few blocks down the street at Cafe Hoang. The portion is also significantly smaller than the portion at Cafe Hoang, so if I crave canh chua, I'd probably go to Cafe Hoang. Both places charge around the same price for different quantity and quality.  The claypot catfish is also very good here. I love it.

2009-05-21,4.0,"Hai Yen, a neat and clean restaurant on Argyle's Little Hanoi row, serves in my estimation the best beef noodle soup (pho) in the city. The pho varieties they serve cover the usual spectrum from those containing a lot of unrecognizable beef parts  (tripe, tendon and the other unidentifiable bits and pieces that are integral to an authentic bowl of pho) to those with meatballs or even a vegetarian soup for the less adventurous. At ~$6-$7, it's a fantastic deal, and the pho comes with a generous plate of fresh veggies to garnish your soups with - a nice contrast to the anemic plate of bean sprouts and lonely lime wedge -- or god help us all, lemon wedge -- you might find at lesser establishments.  However, it's not their pho that keeps me coming back but their Bo La Lot: meatballs wrapped in aromatic Shiso leaf, aka Hawaiian Basil, barbequed to a charred crisp that you wrap in rice skin -- imagine a fresh summer roll with pork/beef meatball in place of butterfly shrimp -- as a reward for your efforts. (Ask for a demonstration if you're nervous about attempting this this feat.) Fantastic.

My beef isn't with their food.  I'm soured by their drinks.  The water tasted very off...my friend described it as ""toilet water"".  Not that she's drank out of the toilet, but she said it reminded her of the smell that bathrooms have.  I agreed that it was an apt description. My roomie ordered an avocado bubble tea, while I went with the mango-coconut.  The menu said their shakes were made with fresh fruit, but I highly doubt that claim - both our drinks had this unpleasant, grainy texture to them.  Also, my drink was as yellow as a highlighter, while his was so sugary sweet he could only drink half and started checking his teeth for cavities.

2009-04-07,4.0,"Fee Fi Pho Fum- I smell the broth from a Vietnamese kitchen!  Dumb, yes, I know- but it is what I think of when I see the word ""pho""- which is even dumber (grammatical mistake pun intended) when you consider it is more properly pronounced ""fuh"" than anything else. No matter, because it is the thought of pho that brings on a giant-sized appetite.  A few words on my experiences with pho:  Pho is something that I discovered about four and a half years ago. At the time, I had limited exposure to Vietnamese food, with eating only a couple different simple noodle dishes and spring rolls and egg rolls. Even then I could recognize that I had been missing out on something spectacular.  The first time I ordered pho was simply out of embarrassment for never having it before. I had heard someone talking about how much they loved it and at that time I was trying out new things in order to broaden my horizons. It was love at first sight, bite, whatever. I believe that within two weeks of having it once, I had it another three times- making it something that I couldn't get enough of.  That particular Vietnamese place we used to haunt is now long gone, and for a while we were not going anywhere to fulfill my obsession with pho. Luckily, my wife and some of her friends had a joint craving for that delectable, beefy, soupy stuff and decided to head up to the land of pho (aka Argyle Street) one evening. Upon much research, something she is very good at due to her academic background, she decided to go with Hai Yen.  I knew this place was good after she came back and told me how much she loved it (odd cuts of meat, while she is brave and tries them, are not typically something she craves).  She too caught the pho bug at this moment, much like I had about four and a half years prior. All of this evidenced by the fact that less than 24 hours later, she was back here for another bowl- this time with me in tow.  My grateful soul was eager to try things out here remembering just how good that last place did it.  Here was even better. That beef broth walks so many fine lines- no, struts them, and does so with grace.  The heavenly broth is packed with rich, beefy flavor, and yet is not too dense or thick- in fact, it is a mostly clear broth. Big, bold flavors, yet you can taste individual bights of vegetables and noodles and cuts of meat separately, and subtly. Each bight brings something new to your palate.  If I could give one recommendation for anyone that wants to try something daring and delicious (and the stuff to brag to your friends about)- order the Pho Dac Biet (Hanoi Specialty). It comes with just about every cut of beef you could imagine- a rich cluster of beef tendon, tripe, meatball, rare beef that cooks in that hot broth, and a more cooked cut as well. All bits unique and delicious!  Accompanying the pho is an array of fresh cut stemmed basil, bean sprouts, hot peppers, and a combination of fish or hoissin sauce with some hot chili sauce- perfect for making it as spicy and flavorful as you like.  If you haven't noticed, I have spent the majority of this (already too long) review talking about one simple dish. There are dozens offered here too- which makes me want to go back and try out more. Decor is nothing special, but there seems to be plenty of room to fit quite a lot of people in there. Service is standard for an ""ethnic"" restaurant- which is to say nothing spectacular. But this is the type of place that you go out of your way for because of the food.  Well worth the trip, and it feeds my giant craving for pho.",0.9986,0.759,0.181,0.06,0.4669846819846819

2009-03-09,5.0,"Came here for an early dinner on Saturday night and had the best Vietnamese meal I've ever had. The place is pretty clean and while I didn't use the restrooms, I wasn't afraid to do so like I am at some ""authentic"" places. The service was so-so, but I'm never concerned about service when I go to these small restaurants, so that was fine by me. There weren't any major service gaffes, though we did get iced coffee instead of hot, but we were fine with it and didn't even mention the mix-up. (The coffee is great! It's super strong and mixed with condensed milk.) The food was awesome. On a couple recommendations, we ordered the BO NUONG CUON BANH TRANG as an appetizer which was a make your own beef spring rolls kind of deal. The meat was AMAZINGLY good and the rolling at the table let you customize how much of each ingredient you put in. Very nice and fun interactive food choice. Yum! We also ordered the same sort of thing, but where you grill your own meat at the table to share and that came out with the appetizer.  It was called NHUNG GIAM HOAC NUONG VI. We did the grilled rather than the fondue version. It was good, but more expensive and not as tasty as the appetizer version. Next time I'd stick with that only. I had the Pho tai which was exactly what I had been looking for in Chicago. So many other places had disappointed me, that I almost didn't bother trying it here. I'm so glad I did. The noodles were awesome and chewy the beef so thin and the broth was amazing. I like that they portion the hoisin and chili sauce for you with your veggies so novices know what to add. Overall, it was delicious.  My table mates also enjoyed their meals as well and I tried some BO LA LOT (beef wrapped in an aromatic leaf) from my boyfriend's noodle bowl and LOVED it. It was juicy and delicious.  I will definitely be back for the pho and the beef roll-your-own spring rolls.

2009-02-14,5.0,"I was badly in need of Pho and I always go for Pho Ga only (Chicken Pho). their Pho bowls are huge and single-size only. This is a more upscale vietnamese restaurant in that they mix Hoisin sauce and hot red sauce in a small dish and serve with the Pho, whereas usually the sauces are provided as condiments. The chicken breast meat was clean white with no fat or gristle, just as I like it. It was the best Pho noodles I've had in chicago, but that doesn't say much because I don't have much to compare with. Their vegetarian spring rolls were okay. Nothing fancy. I was cognizant of the salmonella outbreak in peanuts, so perhaps that was why I couldn't enjoy the spring rolls. The best part of the meal was the Vietnamese style hot coffee. Usually this is served with the coffee dripping slowly on a bed of condensed milk and a flask of hot water separate, meant to be mixed at the right time. That is the authentic method IMHO. Hai Yen serves the hot coffee mixed. But it is AWESOME. The best Vietnamese style hot coffee I have ever had. And I have been drinking Vietnamese style hot coffee since 2000. Moreover, I roast my own coffee beans at home (I don't brew Vietnamese style though), so I know great coffee. And Hai Yen serves great coffee.

For $5.99 you have more than enough to be satisfied. We were sit at the big table of six but were still able to talk and spend a great time.

The broth wasn't the most flavorful, but at least it's vegetarian.

Finally, they bring you down gently with a congee that is warm, smooth, and has little bits of beef in it.  Delicious.

Tasted good here, very fresh, but I'd say it wasn't worth paying more than it usually costs. Service wasn't that great.  They seem to get quite busy around dinner time...7pm ish. The second time I decided to get carry out.  They must have had a birthday party that day or something and it was extra busy.  It took more than their estimated 15-20 minutes to prepare the food I ordered. I got their Thai Tea, Item #55 (includes Banh Beo (6 pcs), Banh Bot Loc (3), Banh Nam (2)), and their Bo La Lot  (3 pcs) appetizer.  I thought I would be adventurous and order things I've never ordered before and that were authentic vietnamese dishes so that's why I ordered these.  I heard good things about the Bo La Lot especially so I got that.  They were all delicious.  I would definitely order it again.  They ran out of Banh Nam though so I only had the first two of the combination in #55.  They're like little rice cake things.  Bo La Lot was meat wrapped in hawaiian leaves and then grilled.  Good stuff too.  I paid about 13.75 with tax for everything.  Thai tea was okay, too much crushed ice leftover though.  It would have been even better if it was just all cold liquid without any ice left in it. I normally don't get tapioca balls but got it this time and they were good too.  Not too chewy and not too soft.  Sometimes people don't cook it enough (so there are hard parts in it) or overcook (so its too soft) but this was neither.  I would have liked it a little softer though.  I think the thai iced tea is still best at Dong Ky down the street.  They have been making theirs a bit too sweet lately however.  I ordered carry out on a Sunday night around 7:30pm and it was pretty busy.  No lining up past the door or anything but tables were filled up.  And the waiters and hostesses seemed in a hurry.  I had to wait a while even though I called my order in before I came.  Wasn't very friendly there either.

2006-09-09,4.0,"i went here for the special bo 7 mon (seven beef course) because my relatives were massively craving for vietnamese food, and plus, we wanted to see how vietnamese food in chicago compared to california. bo 7 mon is basically seven different courses of beef where you wrap it in rice paper with lettuce and all the trimmings, and dip it in the special fish sauce - kind of like a springroll, but better. the overall taste and presentation of it was pretty good. it's good, but it doesn't compare to a restaurant in calfornia called anh hong. it's pretty good for a city that doesn't have a huge vietnamese population like california has. one of the courses, i remember, was a bit on the dry side where i had to majorly dip it in the fish sauce for me to swallow.  i'm vietnamese, so i love that fish sauce and i'll heavily dip my food in that fish sauce. the only thing that bugged me about that place is that they didn't bring enough sauce out to the table of nine that i sat in. they brought out two little rice bowls worth thinking that it'll feed us all. we asked for a couple more because we just eat a lot and they came back with one more. my uncle was upset and asked how come they didn't bring more than that. because we were seated in their upstairs dining, the server replied that because he had to go up and down the stairs a lot and it gets very troubling or some shit like that. well HELLO!? if he just came up with a lot, then we wouldnt have made him go up and down the damn stairs. why is he acting like it's a burden for him? oh yeh, another thing, he also said that he can't bring out a lot because he'll get in trouble. wtf? i don't get it. the upstairs dining is made for big parties and big parties = a lot of food and attention. but whatever, it's not like im going to come back since it's in chicago, but if i were to ever come back, i'll be sure to eat the other dishes instead because it seems better than the bo 7 mon. overall: clean place. haven't seen the bathroom yet, so i don't know whether it's clean or not. the location is placed in an area where my sister said that if it was vietnam, it would be the good parts of vietnam (um, ghetto? not poverty.). parking is on the street. servers were pretty attentive and nice except for whatever was mentioned above and pretty good food.",0.9961,0.753,0.184,0.062,0.5323372206025268

2006-07-31,3.0,"Rarely has a restaurant that was previously high in my book taken such a drastic turn for the worst.    This past Sunday, I had lunch with six other people at Hai Yen.  This was my fourth or fifth time eating there and I had been pleased with the food/service in the past.  However, this time around, Hai Yen really dropped the ball.    After ordering drinks and food along with the rest of my table, we waited about 20 minutes before everyone's food came except mine.  Because our server's tray was full, I thought he had to make a second trip to get my food.  5 minutes went by -- nothing.  10 minutes -- still nothing.  At this point, I noticed people who had sat down after us were beginning to get their food.  Every time a server came out with food, I kept thinking, ""Finally it's here!"" only to see the server bring the food to a different table.  15 minutes passed -- still no food.  At this point, I am none too pleased to say the least.  When I inquired as to the whereabouts of my food,our server looked at his fellow server in a confused manner before cleverly deducing that he had given my food to the wrong table.  Seriously?  That's your brilliant excuse?  Hai Yen is not a very big restaurant and there was only one other party eating there that had as many people as we did.  How hard is it to remember that dish #81 (braised pork and shrimp) goes to the party of seven near the door?  I could blame the other table for accepting food that they didn't order but they were probably just greedy bastards who though they could get their grubby hands on some free food.  No, I blame the server, especially since it should've been obvious to him that everyone else at my table had gotten their food except me.  After our server realized his mistake, he didn't offer to comp the food or give me a free dessert or anything like that.  He just said he would put the order in now and get it to me when it was done.  Thanks for nothing.  To add insult to injury, when I finally got my food, it was bland, dry and not tasty at all.    While I don't expect stellar service when I'm paying roughly $10 for lunch, I do expect to get my food in some timely manner.  And when that doesn't happen as a result of a mistake on the waitstaff, I would expect any decent restaurant to make it up to their customers so that they don't leave the restaurant with a bad taste in their mouths.  The fact that Hai Yen failed in that respect means I will never go back there again and never recommend the restaurant to any of my friends.  UPDATE (08/29/06): The manager from Hai Yen e-mailed me and personally apologized for my experience.  Regardless of why it happened, she indicated that it was unacceptable and invited me to come back again for a free meal on them.    I know a lot of Yelpers have had to deal with owners harassing them after they posted a not-so-positive review of their establishment.  So I think it says something when a restaurant's manager goes out of her way to apologize to a disappointed customer and try to rectify a bad situation.  I've bumped up my review to three stars (from one) and I look forward to dining at Hai Yen again in hopes that my last visit was merely a fluke.",-0.9156,0.808,0.088,0.104,0.5456245890861277
2006-07-22,5.0,"Oh My!! This was awesome.  The sea bass is indeed the Chilean sea bass also known as the toothfish. They aren't nearing extintion... just over fished. See this website here ~  state.gov/g/oes/rls/fs/2… . It was decently priced around $15 and very tender and buttery. It was a bit sweet for me but it was good.  I tried the filet minion with the tomatoes, it was decent but what really stood out was the lemon grass chicken... it was so tasty and the wrap appetizers. I really recommend this restaurant... especially because it is so reasonably priced and so tasty! The wine is a great bargain too... not marked up a ton like most places at around $4 a glass.",0.9752,0.812,0.188,0.0,0.6052083333333333
2006-05-23,5.0,"One of the best damn restaraunts in the City.   I always bring out of town visitors here.    All the veggies are always so healthy looking.    Try the Fillet Mignon something (don't remember the actual name...the one with tomatoes in it), the Lemon Grass Chicken, and the Steamed Sea Bass with green onions.  Especially the Sea Bass, since it's nearly extinct (and you'll know why after you taste this delicate, buttery fillet steamed in a subtlely delicious tea/chicken stock-like broth and covered with beautiful scallions.   It's like giving your tongue a hug!   Seriously, even if you don't usually order fish at restaraunts, do not visit without trying the steamed Bass.  Once you try it, you'll carry around the sense memory with you forever.   [NOTE: I've just been informed that this probably is NOT the CHILEAN Sea Bass which is being fished to extinction.  I don't remember if the menu describes it as Chilean or not.  If not, then order guilt free.  If yes, then order once, so you can brag to your grandkids, ""I had Chilean Sea bass once.  It tasted good.  In your FACE, grand kids.""  If you're there with a bunch of meat eaters the 7 courses of beef is good fun.  It lacks the variety of the rest of the menu but it's so viking!  Bubble drinks are hella good too, with big chucks of fresh fruit all laying on top, all saying, ""Don't eat me; you'll spoil your appetite.  Oh, wait...we're not sweets, were healthy.  We taste so good we got confused.""  Basically, there are a ton of places for good Pho, Bale is the place for Vietnamese sandwiches, and Hai Yen is were to have an awesome sit down meal with company.  Take out of towners to Hai Yen, and then walk 2 blocks to the Green Mill and tell them how Al Capone used to hang out there.  They'll be all, ""Holy crap, this is the coolest!""  and you can be all, ""Oh...do you think so?""  If you don't like Hai Yen, you might want to check your head for GIANT IRON BARS sticking through it, because there's clearly something wrong with your brain.",0.992,0.795,0.164,0.041,0.5956456456456456
