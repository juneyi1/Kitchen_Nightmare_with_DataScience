2007-07-13,2.0,"This restaurant might even have good food. I don't know. They didn't let us in! Since it's right across from Mon Ami Gabi, we decided to give it a try one night. But they didn't let us in since my husband didn't have a jacket on. The alternative was to wear one of the jackets that they keep there for people who aren't properly dressed. It kinda grossed me out and we decided for Mon Ami Gabi instead.  So, not sure about the food. But the surprise and the rejection didn't quite work for me and I'm not going back.",-0.2822,0.883,0.048,0.069,0.4249206349206349
2007-05-16,3.0,"It's one of those restaurants where food is good, price is high, and you come home hungry. I went there for my birthday and we had the signature menu (however it's called, the fixed tasting menu). portions were sooo small that at one point we got the seafood carpaccio and I thought the plate was empty!! carpaccio was so thin and small that it was almost translucent. They do a good trick though, they stuff you up at the end, with a bunch of tasting chocolates and cakes...of course that's the cheapest stuff and they give you plenty!",0.6884,0.903,0.067,0.03,0.51125
2007-05-04,4.0,"Great food and a chance to try some thing that is new but not too fru fru.  Menu has recently been updated from traditional French cuisine and now includes Spanish and American influences. A place that you do not visit for the food alone but for presentation and the entire eating experience.  Be ready to spend +2 hours and at least $150 - $250 per person (depending on appetizers, entree, drinks, desert, etc.) Tip: Definitely go for the the souflee, which needs to be ordered at the beginning of the meal.",0.81,0.861,0.113,0.026,0.38450413223140495

2007-01-30,4.0,"Definitely fine dining.  Everything was delicious and if you go with someone with a big wallet you will have no worries here.  They have a fantastic wine list, delicious food and impeccable service.  Our waiter was older but here that truly did stand for experience.  He knew EVERYTHING, from which wines to suggest to the history of the restaurateurs who opened Ambria (did you know they own many other restaurants in Chicago including Mon Ami Gabi and Emilio's?).  I went with my family and it was very nice, however i don't think i would ever use the word ""fun"" in describing this place ;)",0.9441,0.787,0.182,0.031,0.666025641025641
2006-11-30,5.0,One of the nicest dinners I have ever had!  I had a 5 course dinner with wine pairing that was out of this world!  The prices are steep but the education and the tastes are steeper!  This is a lettuce entertain you restaurant so it is a good place to use your gift certificates or get your boss or folks to foot the bill;),0.9328,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.8
2006-10-24,1.0,"Largest disappointment ... the star is only for semi-decent food. This place is a large room that looks like it has not been redone in years ... great ... how the hell is that romantic?  It was full of old people and snotty waiters.  Then the food was only average with a price tag to match that of restaurants that actually serve quality food.  The waiter wanted us out before we sat down, his recommendations were horrible and the people sitting next to us were depressingly stodgy. If you want good food I can give you 100 places in Chicago that have it ... if you want nice servers with cheaper food I can perform the same feat.  If you want bland food with poor service and old people everywhere glaring at you ... well hell try this out.  Just make sure you are prepared for the hefty price tag that comes with the 'fine dining' experience.",-0.34,0.732,0.146,0.121,0.55748556998557
2006-10-03,5.0,"Sammy F. is right in that this restaurant is definitely a bit older. I was worried at first that my boyfriend had taken me to an old people restaurant, but I was very pleasantly surprised by both the food and the service. Our waiter was a friendly old guy who told us the whole story of the restaurant, and in addition to him we had several other people making sure we had water, bread, wine, etc. We were seated in a semi-private dining area, and when the waiter noticed I was cold, he had the heat adjusted to make me more comfortable. We shared the prime rib for two, and it was a LOT of food...I'm used to trendy places where they give you 3 bites of meat, but this was a big ol' piece of steak and was very tasty. We also got a chocolate souffle for dessert, which was delicous. We left very full and happy...highly recommended",0.9787,0.83,0.16,0.009,0.474063492063492

This is old world eating at it's best. my wife and I are in our late thirties, making us the youngest couple there that night which we thought was amusing.

I'd give it 5 stars for the wine list alone!!!!!!   The Food is really really good.  Yet, the atmosphere is OK.  The decor has an Older feeling.  It's dark ... dark woods and antique feeling furniture.  It is still very romantic.  Good for Couples!  it's also Good for business if  your fellow businessmen like french food!  proper attire required!",0.9767,0.678,0.322,0.0,0.3679487179487179
