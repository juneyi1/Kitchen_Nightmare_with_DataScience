Shefollowed me outside and then started banging on my passenger window! This was my third time there, the food is not badand i dont care for the servixe but you never know whats behind the scenes, who's cooking your food, or the sanitary conditions.

2014-02-02,3.0,"This was not a memorable experience whatsoever. My family decided to go there since my mom didn't want to cook. We always drove past the store, but never really noticed it. My mother said she loved the food the one time she decided to pay the restaurant a visit. I was never a big fan of Asian cuisine in general, so it better be one hell of an eat. I was surprised to walk into an empty restaurant on a Saturday night, so it was already an awkward experience. The service was unpleasant. The server/owner was not relatively talkative and didn't seem to want to be there, or to serve us in general. He served us our food, and quietly returned to the front counter. Never asking if everything was okay, but he did always refill our drinks. For my meal, I guess the Pad Sew was relatively okay but I've had better. My family seemed to enjoy the meal. I don't remember them reflecting much on the food, as if it was just another eat. And we haven't really returned there since.",0.7963,0.775,0.122,0.102,0.47301587301587295

It even has a memorable name. As my Thai friend Veera said, it was named after him on Miami Beach.  We decided to finally eat here tonight. Places like this intrigue me and I've been burned before. This time, not so much. Our Host/waiter seemed very nice. Service is pleasant but at a minimum here. Not a lot of conversation or checking up on us, but our food came out quickly and we always had water.  We ordered pad thai (just ok. a bit mushy and a tad too sour), curry chicken and penang beef. The curries were pretty good with the penang beef being the standout. That said,we eat Thai food a lot and I can't say either curry looked or tasted authentic to us. Either way, whatever it was, it was good.  I'm not sure this will pull us away from our regular Thai joints, but for one night it did the job.",0.9679,0.859,0.129,0.012,0.556068376068376

I also ordered a Thai Ice Tea for $2,25 then ordered one to go w/ no ice and they charged me $3.50 for that one!!!  I asked why it cost more and I think he was trying to say it's more because there is no ice and you get more tea when there isn't any ice.  You've got to be kidding me.

I absolutely love the Kao Pad Thai which is their Thai Chicken Fried Rice. I've checked out several other Thai places around the Chicagoland Area, none of which have chicken fried rice like this. It's kind of like a version of their Pad Thai but with rice, instead of noodles. Everything else I've ordered here is so good and the service so fast. Other favorites are the Mee Krob, Satay, Kai Cashew, Neur Nam Mun Hoy & The My Choice Supreme.

I'm glad I stayed.  I'm not very experienced with Thai food, so I can't compare with many others, but I really liked the food here.  I had Pad Woonsen, my girlfriend had Pad Kee Mau Kai and we shared a Chicken Satay and it was all very delicious.  The prices are very reasonable.

2010-11-16,3.0,This place did not live up to my expectations. I was really looking forward to trying some good thai at a new spot and was a little disappointed. It wasn't horrible but it didn't live up to the rave reviews. I tried the highly suggested Meekrob and it was definitely different and ok it did taste like the noodles were stuck together with ketcup. The basil chicken with noodles they were crispy and I do like my noodles with a little crunch but they were way to oily. Maybe I just hit up the spot on an off day but I don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon.  Oh and how could I forget on the way out I did notice that the handle to push the door open on the way out was one of the bars they use in the handicap stalls.

The plastic table cloths, simple decor, and wood paneling...yeup. Staff that barely speaks English...yeup. Person who takes your order jumps into kitchen immediately to cook your meal...yeup. Person you pay your bill to is eating lunch at the table right next to you..yeup. And best of all, you walk in and smell the grease...oh yeaaah.   Here's the thing though...don't order the pad thai unless you really like your pad thai really kethup-y. Same thing goes with the kao pad thai, which is basically ketcup fried rice. (I like it cuz it reminds me of grandma..) The nam sod, usually one of my fav dishes to order, is only ok here, since they overloaded it with ginger and white onion, and it crowds out the vinegar chicken taste.  The star of our platters: the basil chicken noodles..which, to note, is on the BACK of the menu, with the drinks/desserts/sides. The wide noodles are not soggy, but they are fried so that there is a slight crisp to them. And..surprise..you can actually taste the basil and it makes this dish quite tasty.

If you are going in to this experience expecting world-class white golve service then keep driving. But if you are a fan of serious Thai cuisine, then pull over because this place does not disappoint. Ive never had anything bad on their menu, but the standouts for me are Chicken Satay, which is always juicy and tender, Kai Thom Ka blows me away every time. Pad Eggplant; Amazing. Chineese Brocolli with tofu. Awesome. Basil Chicken Noodles: Drool.. Please ignore the Yelpers who post negative reviews of this place because the service is not what they expected. This place is literally a Mom and Pop operation. The owners live above the restaurant and  may sometimes have their grandkids milling about the dining room.

2010-03-09,3.0,"Not just a Thai restaurant with a wild name and shabby look. Anytime I drive by this area I always ask my navigators if they would like to stop and try out Thong Thai. I make a joke like; I bet they serve the food in a thong! Most times just the exterior look of the place is enough to deter them from trying it. Still I've always known at some point, I would check them out.  Let's get to it. Gaudy pink tablecloths adorn tables with glass table tops and a single bud vase with two bamboo sticks facing each other in the shape of a heart. Old school 70's wood paneled walls reminding you of your parent's basement making you wonder, why don't they update? Few Asian or Thai art pieces decorate a few walls. An Asian restaurant of this caliber isn't complete without its cracked seat bottoms; that of the old green vinyl booth seating, with off green tape for sealing. Seating at the table is comfortable and a lot more romantic with the view of the leaning tower of Pisa right outside.  Food choices seem much more authentic then the dishes you could commonly find at any other Thai restaurant. For my first time, I got an appetizer, noodles and an entrée. The value was the noodles, Rad nar priced around $7.50 a larger portion than the entrée Neur pad khing (ginger and beef) which cost a dollar more and came in a container the size of an average vitamin bottle. When you see a dish served in the restaurant it's grossly larger in comparison, or is it? Both dishes were bland, separately they weren't that great. Threw it into the wok with some chili paste and mixed it all together with rice, that made it a lot better. The appetizer.. was a bad choice, if I see Egg roll or spring roll, I'll go for it. What I didn't pay attention to was the wording. Popea Sod and Popea Tod. Sod is a spring roll with Chinese sausage in it with vegetables. Tod is a deep fried egg roll. You see? Deep fried. I ordered the Sod and was unpleasantly surprised to see that it's merely an uncooked egg roll. How's the food otherwise? It was okay, better than average. No offense to the locals, because that's who typically frequents the joint. I guess to a local that's not had Thai from Chicago, it would seem like this food is rock star. The place is kinda off the beaten path in that, most don't see it and if they do, won't stop to try. You can expect to find a cozy restaurant with a sweet proprietor that is happy to see you walk in. When busy he'll go to the back and help in all the cooking. Doesn't take long to get served food, roughly fifteen to twenty minutes. You can expect a quiet time in there without much distraction or bother from the host. For his entertainment there is a small flat screen mounted showing Thai serials and news. I think I could give them another try, this time ask for extra spicy and for a recommendation.",0.98,0.863,0.096,0.041,0.39459064327485366

My finace and i love thai food and must have tried about 10 places before we found this place and absolutely love it. The only place i like better is Wok-N-Fire in addison but as far as food for the price though thong thai can't be beat. I also don't agree with the other reviewer about getting the order right. She orders no egg and not tofu in her pad thai however i keep everything in mine and we both order pad thai A LOT. Not once has it ever been messed up. Also i find it odd that someone would review a place without eating there, some of the best places to get food at look like dumps.

A couple bits of advice:  - order the meekrob. Delicious.  - order the thai basil chicken with noodles. Make sure you specify ""noodles"" three or four times or you'll get the one with rice.  - if you're doing pickup and they say ""20 minutes"", make sure you add another 20 to that total. I have spent what feels like years of my life wasting away in there waiting 15-25 minutes longer than I was told.  - you will not understand the owner answering the phone. No one does.  - he will get your order right probably 70% of the time. Ask for more than that and you WILL be disappointed.  But... yeah... the food's delicious.
