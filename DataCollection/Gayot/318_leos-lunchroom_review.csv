2012-03-22,5.0,"I was one of the original investors in Leo's in 1988 or 89 (I forget now). The food got to be the best when Dave and Sheila brought in Donna, who had cooked at a place in L.A. called ""Citi"" (sp?). Donna went onto Bite on Western Ave next door to Empty Bottle. I don't know where she might have gone to from there but I think she is still in Chicago.   I guess the building was worth more to sell than to operate a restaurant and it seems to be an extension of the sushi place next door (the former Bop Shop).",0.5789,0.907,0.065,0.028,0.23888888888888893
2008-04-04,5.0,I miss the days of leo's before it was sold to the group that eventually ran it into the ground. It was never the same after they cleaned it up and brought in that lame ass wait staff. I still haven't found a substitute for Leo's weekday breakfast.  Sunrise isn't cutting it for me.,-0.7601,0.835,0.024,0.14,0.5916666666666667

2007-02-03,1.0,"Closed?  I'm shocked.  Their ""sausage"" patties were so greasy and spicy I almost coughed one up.  I expect the other patrons here are too young to have had real food yet.  Or they just need something to replace the alcohol in their pores.",-0.3182,0.946,0.0,0.054,0.39499999999999996

2006-05-30,3.0,"What happened, Leo's? You were one of the best eateries in the neighborhood and then you had that weird makeover that included matching tableclothes and the awful mural of Chicago airbrushed onto the walls inside. Then, in the blink of an eye this past fall/winter season, you were closed. All of your breakfast, lunch, and dinner gubbins hit the spot. Your spicy turkey patties were exceptionally delicious. I pine for you, Leo's Lunchroom. I hope you are sipping on a cool drink out of a colorful aluminum tumbler in Restaraunt Heaven.",0.9184,0.789,0.165,0.046,0.5875

2005-09-16,3.0,"Does it make me a cranky old hipster to complain about change? Because that's basically what I've got here. The old gritty Leo's was so lovely and cheap; there wasn't anything else like it in or around Wicker Park. Now that new ownership's come in, they've cleaned it up so that the SWP/yuppie types that live in the area now will come there. It's not terrible. But it's not my favorite thing to see either. Gentrification has brought some good things to chicago, but the stripping and replacement of culture has just got to go. Wicker Park is slowly losing interesting bits of character that made people want to move there in the first place. Now that Leo's is out of my luncheon rolodex...it's across the street to Smoke Daddy, or nowhere else.",0.4965,0.86,0.081,0.059,0.5682983682983683
2005-08-27,4.0,"Despite its history as a small, dingy place, Leo's has long been a favorite breakfast spot, particularly with outdoor seating. The grungy days of the guy with the big mustache taking orders with photos and odds and ends flaking off the walls may be over, but the food is still great. My longtime favorite is the sweet potato breakfast burritos.",0.9489,0.775,0.225,0.0,0.5791666666666667
2005-08-12,4.0,"The first time I was taken to Leo's lunchroom, I absolutely loved it.  The spinach salad was tasty and giant, and my friend's soup and sandwich were both simple and good.  The atmosphere is homey and funky and laid-back.  I like the wood-paneled walls   The staff are straightforward and down to earth.  This is a great casual place to relax at.",0.9516,0.716,0.264,0.02,0.5967813051146386

2005-07-11,3.0,"Considering the ""old"" Leo's Lunchbox was my favorite place to eat in Chicago, I was a bit reluctant to try the restaurant since it got a new owner sometime last year. After being unable to get into a number of other places late one Friday night I found myself sitting in the new Leo's dining room. Overall the place is a bit less grungy (one of it original attributes, in my opinion) and the staff is more serious, but the food is still creative, delicious, and ample-portioned. I would skip dessert, however. One of the few carrot cakes I have ever disliked. Instead, I would recommend going to the Alliance Bakery across the street.",0.8911,0.805,0.142,0.053,0.49024064171122994
2005-07-08,4.0,"Some of the best chili I've ever had in a restaurant!  Great sandwiches and awesome chili with friendly service in a comfortable, clean atmosphere.  This place would be at home in New Orleans (something that can't be said for alot of places in Chicago) and they wouldn't have to change a thing.  Chili comes in vegetarian and meaty versions.  Leo's doesn't skimp on the good meats and cheeses, either.",0.9771,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.6380681818181817
