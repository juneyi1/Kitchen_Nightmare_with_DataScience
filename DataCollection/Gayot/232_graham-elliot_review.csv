2014-08-02,2.0,For the last couple of years I've watched Grahmn Elliott  on Master Chef and  knew he was a good chef. I went to his restaurant in Chicago  Tuesday night  and was very disappointed . 11 course tasting menu with a wine pairing . The portions I know are small but these were so tiny that it was insulting .you are left wanting taste . I've had tasting menus before but never that small . I will say the Lollipops were very good . 3 people and one wine pairing came to $700 . So not worth it,-0.4789,0.845,0.061,0.094,0.48216666666666663

2014-06-06,2.0,"Looking for a place to dine in Chicago, a local Fort Lauderdale chef recommended Graham Elliot.  Michelin Star? Done! Let's do it. First, the wine. Given a $25 corkage fee, we ended up taking two bottles of wine to the restaurant.  They did a nice job decanting them. As for the food, we did a tasting.  The oysters were great as was the lobster... so am told.  It was so small when the wife offered a taste I politely declined in fear of eating half her lobster in one bite. Part of the problem with the food was not the quality of the food but the temperature.  The execution was just not there as we had some our plates come out barely warm.  I remember my wife telling me she left hungry which was disappointing.  Chicago has so many good restaurants we doubted we would ever return.   The restaurant is now closed... so I guess we won't!",0.4238,0.861,0.078,0.061,0.42916666666666653

2013-12-31,5.0,"***While my first Graham Elliot experience was a little disappointing, my most recent experience with their tasting menu included some of the best and most progressive cuisine I've had in Chicago*** My first experience with Graham Elliot several years ago was fine but definitely a notch below the other great Chicago restaurants I tried at the time (Ria, Avenues and Longman & Eagle).  I ordered a la carte though and did not opt for one of their more ambitious sounding tasting menus.  I always felt I missed out on something by not trying their tasting menu; in addition, the restaurant has received so much more acclaim since my first dinner there.  Because of these reasons, I was intrigued to give Graham Elliot another shot especially since my experience with their cuisine actually faded and became less impressive over the years. I am glad that I gave Graham Elliot another shot because the restaurant is truly one of the very best restaurants in not only Chicago but the U.S.  Their tasting menu unveils one excellent, exciting and creative course after another with each course utilizing fresh and high quality ingredients.  Presentations reveal the kind of inspired by nature and attention to detail that are hallmarks of great West Coast restaurants. Their spot prawn course was both a showcase of the very progressive cuisine you will find in San Francisco as well as the fresh and vibrant ingredients you get from California farms.  The spot prawn was perfectly cooked (tender and moist) and it was paired with really good caviar, prawn mousse, lightly crispy plantains, and exceptionally cool and vibrant avocado ice cream.  There was also great diced fruit and vegetables to brighten everything up. I also really liked their showcase of various beets in a beautiful presentation.  Their smoked salmon with cream cheese, dill and bagel crisp was a perfect bite; it was also fun how they maintained a tried-and-true flavor combination while moving it forward by intensifying the flavors as well as introducing new textures. Their corn soup was perfectly sweet and velvety, but there were also upscale garnishes like panna cotta and incredibly soft poached lobster to elevate this popular summer soup.  Octopus was nicely cooked here and came with saffron and pepper to provide a good spicy note. Their melon sorbet and cucumber intermezzo was one of the best palate cleansers I've had--a very refreshing course but also a truly distinct celebration of the mild cucumber and the unique flavor of melon. The second half of the menu revealed more great courses including crab with really nice morels (a great ingredient that is local to Chicago) as well as a creamy and beautiful snail risotto.  The fish (halibut) and meat (lamb) entrees were both nicely cooked and presented, but they did lack the wow factor of the other courses.  Still, they combined with all the other plates to create a truly generous amount of high quality food. Their cheese course was one of the best I've had.  It was a fun take on a cheese plate served as a soup-like presentation with warm, gooey and pungent-in-a-good-way epoisses cheese (my favorite cheese) with crunchy pecans sweetened by orange and vanilla. Desserts were perfectly satisfying though not exceptional.  There was a very good blueberry mousse (not too tart), which came with a really good, fragrant and very creamy basil ice cream.  There was also angel food cake highlighted by raspberry, rose petal and lychee. There were several other tasty courses throughout the dinner like a fun foie gras ice cream sandwich. The dining room was the same as my last visit.  It is a nice room that is upscale but still casual with lots of attractive wood.  It is located along a great looking street. Service was very good--very pleasant and polite staff and even pacing between courses. Prices were high but given both the amount of food, the variety of ingredients and the many premium ingredients used, Graham Elliot is actually a much better value than several of its peers (both in Chicago and San Francisco). Graham Elliot seems to have really evolved over the years (they have done away with a la carte menus); the food was both exciting as well as just simply delicious food cooked and plated with precision (while utilizing the very best and freshest ingredients).  Of the many great restaurants in Chicago, only a select few are able to match the great fruits and vegetables of California and Graham Elliot is definitely one of them.  Graham Elliot is closing temporarily to make way for a new interpretation elsewhere.  I really look forward to trying whatever it becomes.  Graham Elliot is one of the few restaurants in the U.S. worth a special trip. I am not sure what the parking situation is.",0.9999,0.683,0.307,0.01,0.5724649556792415

2013-12-20,5.0,"I refused to read the reviews before we went in so we were totally unbiased. Reading them afterward, clearly some love it some don't, we're clearly on the love it side. First off, lots of people have seemed to complain about the service, we thought it was phenomenal from the get go. From Chef Elliot walking into GE right behind us, taking a picture with us and telling us to make sure and get a tour of the kitchen after, to being seated 10 minutes before our reservation, to just a down right all around welcoming and outgoing staff. You'd have never guessed this place is closing in less than 2 weeks based on how awesome we thought the staff actually was. Also enjoy the trendy type decor, good music and feeling like everything didn't need to be white glove while enjoying this level of food. Also the kitchen was something awesome to tour, if you're a foodie, this was a well oiled machine that was cool to see.  15 courses, how does anyone leave hungry (as a few other reviews have said). I'm a fat guy, none of the plates are huge, but for the love of god it's 15 plates of food art unlike you'll see anywhere over half of which have different proteins and are more than filling. after like 7 courses the wife was ""hungry too"" then by the end she's like I'm so full, but it was all so great.  Some of my favorites were the deconstructed ceaser, kobe carpaccio, the prawn with an incredible avocado sauce, the salmon, the pork with the sauerkraut foam was insane, the venison, I really could go on forever. The sauces were all excellent and always complemented dishes well. Only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the cheese (I'm weird and only really like bad processed cheeses). Food was that of what I would expect from a 5*. We joked that if we won Mega Millions this week, this is the type of place we'd love to come to as the menu changed. We still make it a few time a year place if not for the closing.  Anyways, I'd tell anyone to get into GE before is closes in less than 2 weeks. We're even thinking about doing the NYE last dinner there (though it's almost booked up). I understand why they got 2 Michelin stars and while the price is steep, this dining experience was well worth it. It was well worth it.

2013-12-07,1.0,"Had the 10-course tasting menu with the wine pairings. Expected much more from a 2-star Michelin restaurant. The lamb cutlets were so bad (with undercooked potatoes) we had to send it back - tough, chewy and charred-flavor. Chef did send out sturgeon dish as replacement - which wasn't great either. Halibut was good but too salty. Enjoyed corn/lobster soup. Radish/beet salad very pretty presentation. Octopus was interesting but a bit salty. On upside, wine pairings were very interesting. Desserts were very good. But definitely expected way better for $250/meal.

2013-12-05,3.0,"My first experience at Graham Elliott was over the summer where I had a wonderful dining experience with memorable dishes and great service from beginning to end- definitely a 5 star experience.  I loved it so much that I raved to my friends about it and several of them tried it out multiple times and loved it just as much as I did. Fast forward to this past weekend... A group of us were looking for a good restaurant and heard that Graham Elliott was closing.  The other couple we dined with had not been before and were interested in trying it before they closed.  So we made 7:30 reservations on a Saturday night and arrived a few minutes early and were told that they couldn't seat us until exactly 7:30.  Ok, that's fine.  7:40 rolls around and we're told that the table that's reserved for us is finishing up and she'll keep us posted on the wait.  8pm and still no sign of us getting seated any time soon.  We call the hostess over and inquire and she assures us that we will get seated soon.  We point out tables that are open and she tells us that it's reserved for an 8pm party and we quickly remind her that our reservation was at 7:30.  She repeatedly told us that it was an extremely busy night- but isn't that what reservations are for?  To not have to wait for a table?  I don't think she was trained for these types of situations because she would mumble out excuses and walk away,  avoided making eye contact with us as she walked other people to the table and never offered to comp us our drinks.  Finally around 8:15ish we get seated.  Our waiter for the night was kind of a jerk about it when we mentioned that we had waited 45 minutes for our reservations.  He just casually said- we're busy tonight.  Yes.  And that's why we made reservations. Our whole group was pretty ticked by that point, especially since the staff didn't seem to care so there really wasn't much hope for saving the night.  Out of the 15 course meal- some were really good, others were ok, none were bad.  Considering the service and food, this experience was a 2 at best. With a bottle of wine, tax and tip it was about +$250 a person.  You would think if you're shelling out that kind of money we would 1. be seated at our reservation time and 2. be treated courteously.  We joked that the staff probably don't care about service anymore since the restaurant is closing....  I really wanted Graham Elliott to leave on a good note but this sour experience will make us double think dining at any other Graham Elliott restaurants....

2013-11-15,5.0,"Immediately upon entering, we marveled at the spacious, open layout that allowed seating for 115 people. With its exposed brick walls and ductwork along with artwork featuring found moss and other items from nature, it was much more modern than your typical upscale restaurant. As our server approached us, it became evident that this would not be one of our typical upscale experiences. The server was wearing jeans and a sport coat with funky black and white sneakers. Elliot apparently wants to buck the idea of fine dining by playing indie rock and having his staff wear more relaxed attire. He feels that his restaurant should be an artistic outlet that is constantly evolving and what you witness at Graham Elliot is his expression. We went with the 15-course tasting and then it began. The first course was orange with blackberry, thyme, and tarragon flower. The second course was a beautiful, artistic presentation of radish, kohlrabi, yellow & red beets, and chamomile with vinaigrette. This was a very complex dish that we found to be very good. Next, was one of the coolest looking dishes -- a tofu disk served on avocado mousse with cilantro and on either end was a tofu mousee in a crispy plantain with pickled jalapeno. We thought the tofu mousse had a great texture that went well with the avocado mousse, but the tofu disk needed something else -- maybe a little more herbs. For the fourth course, we had tiny circular grilled egpplant with crispy fennel and ratatouille in a bell pepper sauce. The eggplant was meaty and when paired with the smoky sauce, was quite delightful -- a hearty dish. For the fifth course, we were served a cold carrot soup with crushed almonds, chervil, and tarragon along with a saba vinaigrette. At this point, we were super impressed. Next, we had an intermezzo of cucumber sorbet, coriander, melon, and compressed cucumber. Delightful. For the seventh course, a simple dish of cherry tomatoes with cucumber, olive oil and flowers was served. This is the point at which I started feeling full and realized we were only halfway through!  Next, we had grilled summer squash, kombasu, and samphire (a sea vegetable) in a ponzu sauce. The ninth course was when they brought the spongy morel mushroom dish out. I love the distinct taste of morels. There were full morels standing on the plate with some morel slices, crispy artichoke, borage (an herb), pickled pearl onions, and dollops of black garlic sauce. What really surprised us about this dish is that there was some sort of morel-based paste inside of the morels -- completely unexpected and delicious. We marveled at how minimally cooked all of the dishes had been thus far. The chef cooked them just enough while preserving the texture of each vegetable and mushroom and never overcooking anything. It was pure perfection. The tenth course was a risotto cooked in a vegetable stock with runner beans, and pea shoots in a parsley sauce topped with crispy onions. So many tastes that meshed together well. The eleventh course was one of my favorites. Here we had seared cauliflower with lobster mushrooms, artichokes, and purple potatoes. The mushrooms were served over a delicious potato puree. Besides being on the salty side, I absolutely loved this dish. The twelfth course were tiny little bites of elderflower panicotta with compressed rhubarb and celery set in an agar gel. You can't really see it, but all of those little bites are sitting in a sort of vegan jello that caught us off guard! As we finished our wine, the server offered to pour us one of the dessert wines to pair with our dessert courses. We thought that would be great. I must say these next three dessert courses really blew us away. For the thirteenth course, we had apricot sorbet with an olive oil gel over crushed hazelnut served with meyer lemon gel and a vanilla bean skewer. Next up, a lavendar streusel with strawberry gelatin served with sorbet, compressed strawberries, and borrage flowers. And finally, the grand finale -- just the picture of this makes me say ""wow"" all over again -- a chocolate explosion. Here we had chocolate mochi made with cashew butter and gold leaf, chocolate ganache, chocolate sorbet, chocolate powder, and passion fruit gel. So despite our first reaction to the casual atmosphere, I would say we were pleasantly surprised and incredibly impressed. Each dish was impeccably prepared with minimal cooking and presented flawlessly. The service was beyond excellent -- everything was on point as we were served on right and dishes collected on the left. I mean, the service was completely flawless. After our meal, they even presented us with a list of vegan restaurants to explore in the city -- they really went above and beyond. The sommelier was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful. And the price for all of this was reasonable at $165 per person. All-in with a $140 bottle of wine, tax, and tip, we spent about $660, but was one of the best meals we've ever had.",0.999,0.853,0.136,0.011,0.5316113945578232

2013-10-11,4.0,"It's not often I track down 2-Michelin star restaurants when dining on vacay so this super short trip to Chicago last week was made that much sweeter by the visit to Elliot's namesake establishment in the heart of Chi-town.  I'm sure many of you recognize his moniker from MasterChef, Top Chef Masters, Iron Chef, and multiple James Beard Foundation nominations, but what you probably don't know is that Elliot garnered so much attention this year with an extra Michelin star (added to his previous 1 star in 2011 and 2012) that the restaurant even hosted an intimate birthday dinner for President Obama himself.  Oh yeaaaaaah, sounds like the swanky kind of joint I'm totally into!   Refined yet unpretentious, the clean modern interior is totally not what you'd expect from all that star power, but celebrities and locals alike frequent the spot for Elliot's take on fine dining with an artistic culinary twist. Lollipop starters...a perfect balance of flavors to cleanse the palette before 19 courses of pure decadence!  Salmon- their take on bagels and lox.  I love smoked salmon so this pinky-sized portion was all I needed to get the flavor packed in just one bite.  Such a focused effort for something so teensy! Radish- beautiful presentation of all the radishes in season...fresh and tangy, I could start off all meals this way.... Spot Prawn- my FAVE dish of the night!  That avocado schmear was cut to precise perfection!  Nary a line out of skew and prawns served 2 ways impressed me to the core.  A little caviar never hurt anyone, right?? Octopus- It wasn't quite as charred and crispy as I'd like and the smoky flavors overpowered the dish; however the presentation was stellar.  So much so that I instagrammed the *ish outta this stunna and received rave oohs and ahhhss... Carrot- Chilled soup with marcona almond crunch.  So nutty so gooooooood!  Now I crave cold carrot juice all the time.  Handful of honeyed nuts on the side and I could re-create this sucka with some Naked and it's ON! ;D  Cucumber- Sorbet tastes like it looks...fresh and healthy. Foie- Their take on a fancy fig newton.  Fresh fig paste sandwiched between a luscious creamy cut of round foie gras.  Since SoCal banned this baby, I take all I can get!  Ingenious concept, incredible presentation! Halibut- the BEST Halibut I've ever had in my life!  The fish was cooked perfectly and those homemade halibut noodles had me wondering what else they could make with just one protein... Morel- mushrooms served with fresh dungeness crab.  At this point I was sooooo FULL so anything heartier than the fish above I forced down along with some cava.  Not my favorite dish since I'm not a fan of the spongy fungi but a definite substitute for a meat dish...eh, next! Snail- with risotto and crispy rice.  You can't tell but the little chunks of snail were peppered throughout the rice.  You get hit with that woodsy fragrance first then slammed with the creamy texture.  So rich and vibrant, what I imagine summers in Provence would taste like. Lamb- served with purple potatoes and mash.  Too bland for my taste, the protein could have used a tad more seasoning but by this time I didn't care...I was craving desserts already! Epoisses- unpasteurized cows milk cheese served with nuts and honey.  OMG I've died y'all.  Literally DIED as the server scooped a dollop onto my bowl and I nearly fell over from the fumes.  Now I want this dish for breakfast, lunch, and dinner...and dessert.  Mix it all up:  Heaven in a bowl! Strawberry- cheesecake, sorbet, and yogurt-covered served with pistachio sponge cake.  Beautiful summer presentation, light, bright, and refreshing paired with the milk crackers. All-in-all I felt the culmination of the experience coupled with the stellar presentation outshined the cuisine itself.  The most memorable dishes for me were the prawns and the melt-in-yo-mouth, I-could-die-and-call-this-my-last-meal cheese bowl.  The desserts seriously had some points of sheer brilliance with the chocolate plate containing more than 15 various elements and the strawberry perfected to showcase a myriad of techniques and flavors.  If you're looking for a fun-filled 3 hour meal that's ALL about culinary skill and prowess, you're sure to find it here at Graham Elliot. *Insider's tip:  They take same day reservations but be forewarned, these spots book up fast.  Come early with a party of no more than 4 people and enjoy the Chef's tasting menu which may include little extras that they add just for kicks.  As traditional tasting menus go, all guests must order from the same menu (Tasting 12 courses/Chef's 20 courses) but tell your friends this doesn't come cheap.  At $165 a pop you'd bet I'd lick the plate right down to the porcelain hunnies!* Bon appétit mes amis!",0.9989,0.794,0.163,0.043,0.5345431668602398

2013-09-23,1.0,"We were very excited to try Graham Elliot as we have eaten at many fine dining establishments including Gordon Ramsey's, Emerils and others over the years. We love to go out and try new places when we travel so when we made our reservations we were very much looking forward to the experience. But we were very disappointed.  We arrived on time and were seated fairly promptly. The manager ( I think James) came over and brought the menus and wine list. Beside our table they had the server station and there were two bottles on rose open. When I asked the manager / server about them and what was the difference of the two ( as I recently strayed from reds into blushes and am less familiar with them)  he very rudely informed me that one had bubbles and one did not. ( silly me I guess for asking a stupid question ) His snide comment was not appreciated and clearly this man should not be in the role he is in. Graham Elliot needs to find better service orientated staff then this guy. Things were about to take a turn for the worse. I was not in the mood for a lot of wine this evening but wanted to enjoy the pairings to the food which we wanted to order the Chef's Tasting Menu. I asked if it was possible to share one of the pairings with my husband so as to enjoy the pairings but not get too tipsy over dinner. His response was that he didn't care what I did with the wine but would not provide additional glassware. But then he treated us like trash. We decided to leave because we don't need to be treated like trash when we plan on spending upwards of $500- $600 for dinner. Sharing the wine pairing was not about saving money it was about not wanting to get tipsy over dinner. We planned that if we liked any of the wines we would just order an additional glass.  The manager here is a complete jerk and with the unemployment situation in Chicago surely they could hire someone more suited for the position.  I complained to the Ritz Carlton Concierge regarding our experience and they called over to the restaurant. They were told that it is a ""Chef Driven"" establishment and that they had strict rules about wine pairings. Fine to have a Chef Driven restaurant but let's not forget without clientele there would be no restaurant at all. With so many wonderful options in Chicago I would not waste my time here - go elsewhere where the staff actually want you in their establishment - maybe somewhere that is ""Customer Service Driven"" and not ""Chef Driven"" The next evening we went to Alinea - let me tell you it was a night and day experience with staff that wanted to serve us from the moment we stepped in.

Being told that we couldn't be seated until our reservation time (in a nearly empty restaurant) because ""the kitchen can only handle so many tables an hour"" seems like a recipe for insolvency. Bar staff was aloof and not particularly engaged; he seemed more interested in the art of the cocktail than making a good drink.  We had the tasting menu + pairing. The wait staff was nice, if a bit pretentious (as is the food, truth be told, but tasty all the same). They even threw in a course from the nicer menu because we asked about it. Well done. The sommelier was eager to explain the pairing and engage in a way that was *not* douchetastic. Finishing with some really excellent and unexpected sake was a great touch.

For all other items, they are salty, the fish was soo overcooked. one of the seafood made my friend, vomit, literally. to be honest, it was a torture towards the end of the 4 hours, i cannot wait to ask for the bill WHEN they served the last item lollipop.

That said, a few dishes did stick out in my mind: - Prawn + avocodo - Warm cheese over candied pecans - Cucumber sorbet -- they should package this and sell it in pints! - halibut with strips of fresh pasta (with halibut mousse in it) The carrot soup (which was more of a bland carrot juice) was my least favorite.  But overall food was quite good.  Service just needs a little tweaking.",0.911,0.871,0.089,0.04,0.5913690476190477

At $250 per person, there's no excuse. I should've known something was off when the restaurant was only half-full on a Saturday night. The Good: The food was pretty good. I have no complaints about the flavors-- balanced, super refined. You can taste the expertise behind each bite. Each teeny-tiny bite... The Bad: I read the reviews here before I visited GE, and let the complaints about portion size slide off my shoulder. Uh, mistake. All of these reviews have a point. The vast majority of the portions consist of 1-3 humble bites. It's like a meal of 15 amuse bouches. By the time I realized that all of the courses were minuscule, I actually started laughing when the staff would bring out the next one. These people have to be joking. For reference, Alinea left me stuffed and my average B-Dubs intake is 12 wings. The menu selections were also too light for my taste. We got to the ""bulk"" part of the meal at the 8th course. There was halibut, mushroom soup, snail, and lamb. I really wanted more red meat, a bird, something! We were hesitant about ordering the wine pairings, because we didn't want to leave drunk. The sommelier assured us that the pairings added up to only 2 FULL GLASSES OF WINE PER PERSON. This is a lie. Point blank. There was a lot more wine than that (which some people may consider a plus, party on). The barrel of wine coupled with inadequate amounts of food even led one of my friends to throwing up right after dinner.  And my final major complaint: They pace the courses verrrry slowly. It really emphasized the unpleasant feeling of hunger throughout the experience. UPDATE 7/9/2013: Ugh, some butthurt Yelp user by the name of Gabe G. sent me a note regarding my review: ""Stick to steakhouses.""

The only decent item was the lamb and the desert plates.  The rest was so small, we really couldn't distinguish anything in the plate.  And by the time we reached that point of the meal, we were over the experience.   When we were told the lamb was the last savory meal, I was even more disappointed since we were not full.  I really never experienced that at any restaurant and I usually only eat an entree.

2013-02-04,1.0,"As a former chef who used to make a living creating amuse bouche & courses for tasting menus at Gramercy Tavern (NYC) and The Everest Room (Chicago), I thought that the food I received at GE was exquisite. There was true artistry and amazing technique on the plate. The sunflower sunchoke 'risotto' was so yummy I wanted to lick the plate clean. The 'egg' course with caviar & sorrel was perfection. The expertly cooked cod had a texture to coo about, and the beef melted in my mouth. Sadly there was not nearly enough of any of it. When the waiter announced that we were on our last savory course, which was less than 1/2 the size of a deck of cards, I almost started crying. Thank goodness for the great good humor of my husband we laughed about it instead. Graham Elliot will be a standing joke for us for the rest of our lives.  I have been plenty sated after tasting menus at Trotters, Tru, Trio (when Achatz was there), Per Se, the list goes on & on. I was once so stuffed at Alinea I could barely taste the amazing dessert courses. I am a 6 ft tall 135 pound woman, not a linebacker or big guy, and I was so ravenous after this tasting menu (and sloshed from the wine pairings) I demanded to be taken through a McDonalds drive thru on my way home & inhaled a Big Mac. I hadn't touched McD in years, but I was so hungry I didn't care. I witnessed great art at GE, but to leave such a meal not just unsated but ravenous must be considered a failure.

2012-12-21,3.0,"Dinner of 12/19/12 I really thought this review would be different.  I was prepared to love it  and be really impressed.  We opted for the tasting menu and wine pairings.   The good: AWESOME wine choices.  100% worth the price for the pairing.  It was fantastic.  Service was really attentive--honesty it was a bit hovering for me, but that is to be expected from this place so I don't judge them for that.  Cool look and atmosphere was good.  I like that it isn't overly fancy and the music was played at the right level to drown out other tables conversations so you don't have to hear them.   Not so good:  The courses weren't fantastic.  Some were better than others but some were not totally ""cooked""--they did substitute one course for us so that was great.  But we felt like the lobster was just a tad underdone and our duck breast was a little less than room temp.  It just wasn't cooked perfectly in more than one course.  For the money and the reputation you have to be on point with that.  I enjoyed the desserts.  We really didn't like the cauliflower and we really like the sweet breads course.  So it was just all over the place as far as consistency was concerned. Ultimately we also felt that the portions were just a bit too small.  I know its a tasting menu and I have been down the fancy pants road before but it was really not adequate.  Its a simple thing like this: 2 pieces of sweetbread should have been 4; the one piece of duck breast was good sized but the fried dark meat was too small; the lobster was probably big enough but the beef definitely wasn't.  The best portion size ended up being the chocolate dessert.     We left unsatisfied with a $600 bill for 3 people.  It was a splurge birthday/christmas/going away dinner so we were going to go big on the expense but it isn't acceptable to leave the restaurant a little hungry when you spent $200 a person.   I wanted it to be great and really wasn't---I would not recommend this to an out of towner.  You can get way better food for less money in a different style OR you can get way better food in the same style for pretty much the same price (though reservations might be harder to get).",0.9971,0.743,0.208,0.049,0.46339653145208703

The dress code is ""smart casual"" but while we were there it was definitely more on the casual side.  That's actually my preference, so note to self for the future: no need to break out the fancy jeans. Food wise we only had time for the prix fixe menu as my friend had to leave to catch a flight.  I had: - Amuse - white soy jelly I think with yuzu.  I really didn't care for this at all.  The flavor reminded me of Chinese herbal jelly medicine or something.   - Pear - this was beautiful and the flavors complemented each other really well.  I loved this dish, my favorite of my 3 courses. - Beef - I would've tried the duck but I had that the night before.  The meat was tender and well flavored, but overall didn't make me feel as though I was trying something new and inventive.  The dish came with pine needles and a pine cone for presentation and aromatics.  While it looked attractive, it was a little annoying to avoid the pine needles when I was trying to combine all the flavors in one bite on my fork. - Carrot - This dessert was perfect for me as I'm not a fan of the overly sweet.  This dish definitely had more character than the beef and was not as rich as the chocolate. - Ending Yuzu - they brought another bite with the jelly and said that this bite was sweet rather than savory (maybe I mixed up which one was sweet/savory between this and the amuse) but I really hesitated to put it in my mouth.  It again was really not good.   My friend had, (and I tried bites of): - Cauliflower - this was stellar.  The cauliflower terrine in particular was inventive and delicious.  Gave the dish a richer quality.  An absolute standout. - Monkfish - The monkfish and rutabega were cooked to perfection, though similar to the beef I'm not sure that I would say the flavors were very exotic. - Chocolate - the ganache was very rich and while it complemented the flour-less chocolate cake well, there was a little too much of it.  My friend left some on the plate as it got a little too rich for her. She agreed with me on the amuse and the ending yuzu.  We just really didn't care for the flavor profile at all. For the price I think it's worth a try.  No need to wear your stretchy pants as the portions will not leave you overstuffed, but rather pleasantly satisfied. I'd be more inclined to try the tasting menu if the amuse and ending flavors weren't so off.  On the plus side, all the actual selections we made were superb.   Probably would've gotten 4 stars if not for the miss on the yuzu.",0.9977,0.712,0.21,0.078,0.5733572497461387

I was a fan of the decor.  It was not what I was expecting but I think the warm colors and exposed brick made it nice and cozy, not uptight.  I was surprised that is was only about 25% full on a Thursday evening.  It is quite quiet in there, which I liked but the strange music selection, not so much.  I have to say the service was impeccable.  The dishes came out very promptly but not in a manner that made us feel rushed.  The attention to detail in explaining the dishes was much appreciated and the staff was extremely pleasant.  Service was on par with Trotters.  Also the plating was absolutely perfect. The three of us got the tasting menu with wine pairings.  To be honest, none of the pairings stood out to me.  I love it when you have a great pairing that just makes the dish transformed but none of us thought any of them did that.  I like how they compose the wine list though...all Pinot Noirs and Rieslings.  They want to showcase the difference in the grapes based on where they're grown.  I think that was a clever idea.  They also chose wines that were good values, 90 pointers that are around the $25 mark.  I think that's a good idea since many times you can never actually buy the wines you get at some of these places due to the limited cases produced.  That being said for an extra $55, not sure I'm getting my money's worth but that's not too big a deal given that I did enjoy most of the wines. The food was just not there for all three of us.  We all found the amuse bouche off putting.  It was very sour.  I know it's supposed to wake up your pallet but I'd prefer it in a smoother manner.  The first course was a cauliflower dish that was stellar.  I absolutely loved it.  I was hoping it would go up from there but that was the high note for me on the menu.  The sweetbreads were good but tiny even for the tasting size.  There was a butternut squash soup that was unbelievably aromatic and we all were just wanting to smell it all night.  Unfortunately the taste was not nearly as good as the nose.  Not that it was bad, nothing we had was, but just underwhelmed is the best way to put it.  The worst dish was probably the lobster as all three of us had overcooked lobster.  The rest were good, even some great, but nothing that blew me away.  If I went back I may try to sit at the bar and try something off the prix fixe menu.",0.9949,0.766,0.159,0.075,0.5122140120415984

2012-11-11,1.0,"To be honest even if I would have read the reviews beforehand I would have still chosen to go. Afterall, I loved his Grahamwich, he is a Michelin star awarded chef, and my picky brother (but great taste palette) said it was one of his favorites in the city.

My boyfriend is so easy to please when it comes to food, he is so gratefull, so to have him dissapointed as much as he is with this restaurant, just reinforces my idea that this time at least, I am not just being overly critical. I love to eat and cook. It is my favorite passtime- hobby-passion. However, Friday by far we had the most DISSAPOINTING culinary experience ever. We opted for the tasting menu and pairing both just AWFUL. Our eating experience: To start they offered what they called Yuzu and according to the waiter it was meant to clean your palette. It was just sooo yukkk. It tasted like smoked very salty fish but preserved poorly. Following came a bite of 5 textures of cauliflower in butter gelatin. I don't get what could possibly be found interesting in it, despite how increadibly small the portion was. Next the sweetbreat, that was nice. Just hoping at this point that the bites get a little more significant. Now the butternut soup: Half a cup of just coloured water, it even lacked salt. No taste, nothing Brrrr. I really can't believe my brother recommended this place to me. But after reading about 30 reviews just now it seems that it used to be good. But let me continue: The Celery. It was a mousse -ok taste- just like celery. Not so contemporary any more.  Next: Overcooked 2 nickle size pieces of lobster. Seriously? We are almost through the menu and starving, not to mention not being even a little impressed or surprised by anything at all.  Bite size Monkfish well done. Not the best I've had but nice. The beef -poor-, no glory to it. The  boiled carrot with crunchy coconut. Is it only me that finds this all together to be a mock. Yuzu again? IT IS UNEATABLE. And to finish: A huge white empty plate, ...wait no ...there is some chocolate there in that edge. Yumm. So after these appetizers we left the restaurant with over $400 dollars less in our pockets (will pay that any time for a good experience), as hungry as when we walked in and having to run to have dinner elsewhere and get drunk to forget the experience. The pairing wasn't of the wines listed in the web. From 6 pairings- 3 were rieslings. Trying to clean out your cellar? All but a riesling from Michigan were pretty plain.  I mean isn't it hard to pick such wines that have nothing to say.  However, his wine list that I went through had no excellent references.

When our anniversary came up this year, I thought - why not go with our old favorite?   Well, as we discovered, it isn't our old favorite, and isn't even worth going to anymore. The place has always been expensive, so I wasn't shocked to see the price tags on the new tasting menu format. I was disappointed that the bottomless truffle and herb popcorn basket starter had been replaced with a single salty/citrusy gumdrop with foam on top. It didn't even taste great. It was like a gummy cough drop in taste and filling.  So, we went with the three course prix fixe. In the past, three courses at GE was about the same price tag and always was plenty of food. I got the cauliflower and my wife got the butternut squash, with the idea that we could each taste from both. When the dishes came out, we just started laughing. The cauliflower was made five ways (I couldn't have imagined beforehand how you could possibly make something five ways and NOT give a decent amount of food).  One of the ways was pickled, and it was orange cauliflower. There was one small sprig (less than a bite) and two little crumbs of that kind. I had to scoop the little crumbs into a spoon to taste because they were too small for a fork. There was one small sprig of fried cauliflower, so small that we couldn't even split it. Three thimble sized drops of purée and two matchbox sized terrines. I have no idea what the fifth was - if it was there, i was too small to see. The only part we could legitimately split for tasting was the terrine. It, and the remainder of the cauliflower was mediocre.  My wife had the squash soup. Flavor was ok, but it was less than a cup of broth with a few seeds floating in it. I had one spoonful and it drained a third of the dish.  My initial laughter at the comical size of the dish had moved to disappointment.  We both got the braised beef cheek main course.  I had hopes that there would be decent portions. My hopes were lost once I saw the waiter approaching. Two cubes of meat on each plate, each with about three bites of meat. As for the potatoes or turnips or whatever else was supposed to be on the plate? That was all less than one bite, split up into a few little thimble sized drops scattered around the plate. Again, flavor was ok, not great.  I wasn't even close to being full after that dish. I felt like I do at a wedding after cocktail hour and a few pieces of finger food.  The waiter sold us both on the carrot cake dessert. As with all other courses, he listed so many ingredients and portions of the dish, I couldn't imagine how it could be small. Well, as it turned out, it wasn't carrot cake at all. He had told us it was somewhat of a deconstructed carrot cake. Well, this was a few shavings of carrot over some crumble of gingerbread, I think. Probably 1/4 of a carrot in total. The whole thing was three bites. Maybe one raisin.  We ended with another salty gumdrop. Not exactly a resounding finish. My wife didn't even eat hers because the first one wasn't very good.  As we left, the host gave us each a little cookie in a bag. Going with the theme, it was smaller than any cookie I'd ever seen. Worse, it was bland and dry. I'd rather eat something from a middle school bake sale.  The part I've yet to mention is the drink menu. The beers are decent, and not entirely exorbitant ($6). The cocktails are interesting and tasty, but offer a tiny serving for $13. Nonetheless, the cocktail and beer were the only areas of the meal where I felt it was worth the high price.  We were both still hungry at the end of the meal. We stopped at Dominick's to get some carrot cake, since we had been excited to have some but disappointed by the dish at GE. I also had to get some crackers to eat after to be even close to full.  This place used to be great. The president even thought so!  Why on earth did you mess it all up and go to this stupid new prix fixe format?  If you're going to do that, at least give decent portions. $75 is a lot to spend for a three course menu. I'd gladly so it if it were worth it. In this case, it isn't. We shouldn't have to go to the grocery store afterwards to get some more food to fill up. Sadly, we won't be back unless the format changes back to the excellent restaurant it used to be.  For the price, I'd recommend a lot of other restaurants over this one.",-0.9442,0.868,0.059,0.073,0.48493780166193956
2012-10-08,2.0,"This is not the review I expected to write.  My family and I are big fans of Fox's Master Chef so we had high expectations for this restaurant, not to mention that Graham Elliot is a Michelin starred chef.  We arrived at 8pm on a Friday night with a guest to find the restaurant quiet.  Only two were seated at the bar and the tables were spaced out quite a bit giving the impression of an empty room.  We started with a bottle of champagne that was barely above room temp. Champagne is supposed to be served at 45°F and perhaps it was. But, I like my champagne cold as if chilled on ice.  We did not make a fuss because we were celebrating a special event with our guest and did not want to spoil the mood.     On to the menu;  there were three options.  A price fixed menu for $75, a nine course tasting menu for $110, and a mystery 15 course tasting menu for $160.  Wine pairing was available for an additional fee.  Normally my husband and I would have ordered the tasting menu but we settled for the price fixed menu as my sons wanted no surprises.  The menu consisted of three courses with three choices available for each course.  We presumed that everything on the appetizer and entree section of that menu was included in the other menus so we coordinated to insure that one of each item was ordered.  I felt awkward taking out a camera to photograph the food so I will do my best to describe the dishes.    First an amuse bouche was brought out.  It consisted of a small button sized gelé with a citrus foam.  My son said it tasted like a 30 year old sour gummy bear. lol  He wasn't far off.  It was very salty, so I did not care for it.  My appetizer consisted of a slice of a roquefort custard tart topped with small slices of pear.  The presentation was beautiful.  The taste was not.  I love roquefort and was looking forward it. But, the cheese completely overpowered the pear.   This was a big miss.  The broth appetizer was just under a cup sized portion.  I found it a bit sweet.  My husband loved it.   Because it was so small I didn't ask for a taste of the cauliflower appetizer.  It was two matchbook sized squares of cauliflower, maybe even smaller.  It did not look appetizing at all.    The three entrees were sturgeon, short rib (I think), and lamb.  I ordered the sturgeon. It was placed on a green apple salad.  It was delicious.  The portion was rather small considering it was the second of only three small courses.  The short rib consisted of two 1.5"" x 1.5 "" x 1"" sized portions of beef garnished with an 8"" pine branch and small pine.  The presentation was stunning.  My husband enjoyed it.  Too bad the garnish was not edible.   For the lamb course, imagine two small handfuls of two inch long McDonalds' french fries placed side by side on the rim of a plate.  Now imagine these fries are strips of lamb.  There was nothing on the middle of the plate and not a drop of sauce for additional flavor.  The lamb looked like the garnish sitting on the outer edge of an empty plate.  That was either a big mistake or a big miss, maybe both.  I don't remember what the verdict was on the taste.   On to the desert course.  The waiter recommended the carrot dessert.  It turned out to be the worst of the three.  It looked like semi dehydrated carrot slices sprinkled on a plate.  It was more of a punishment than a treat.  The chocolate dessert was surprisingly generous in comparison to everything else. It consisted of two large tablespoons of delicious chocolate ice cream and several pieces of chocolate cake, imagine very large crumbs of cake.  I had some chai panna cotta type matchbook sized dessert.  Delicious, by far the best of the desserts.  The night ended with a stop at the hotel bar for a burger and fries.    Bottom line, the more I though about it ,the more offended I felt.  The price fixed menu is really a three course tasting menu.  It should be removed from the menu altogether, because it guarantees diners will leave hungry and disappointed. When a Michelin star restaurant asks top dollar for three very small courses of rather ordinary ingredients (ie: cauliflower, roquefort, and chocolate cake) it had better be spectacular.   What did I learn?   1) Read the Yelp reviews more carefully.   2) When a restaurant only offers a tasting menu, beware. They are not interested in repeat customers.  Why go back when you have already tasted everything on the menu?  Final note:  I went back to the Master Chef episode that showcased three dishes from this restaurant.  None of them are currently on the menu. However it is evident the portions were doubled, at the very least ,for the show.   Now I feel duped as well as offended.",0.9942,0.812,0.122,0.067,0.48863662131519287
2012-10-06,5.0,"We went to celebrate a retirement and an birthday. We loved it. We had the prix fixe for $75. Three courses each. I had the beginning of butternut squash, a delightful soup with bird's nest soup.  Janet had the pear which was tasty and a visualizer feast too. The middle was soft lamb with a cracker that I couldn't place. The best lanl ever. Janet had the amazing sturgeon with smoked grilled flavors. The end was carrot and graham crackers for m y dessert and Janet had the chocolate which features four types. A Metropolis Coffee in a press was the final beverage. $192 including two beers without the grats. The midwestern theme of the food reminds us that some of the best food need not come from the coast. Service was propmpt at 5pm. I would only say that the site tells you show up 15 minutes early, but then people were told to wait outside. How does that work in the winter.

2012-09-21,3.0,"Graham Elliot was the classic example of a celebrity chef whose food is more interesting than good. Two days after our meal - two ten-course tasting menus - the restaurant announced that its Executive Chef and Graham Elliot were parting ways. The following summarizes our experience: -The number one drawback is that the portions are super small. I am over six feet tall, and weigh less than 175 lbs. Yet, I left this meal wildly hungry. The portions are truly a huge issue.  -The number two drawback is that there are various people buzzing around who are tasked with explaining each course to you. Unfortunately, none of these people spoke English fluently except our server. Bottom line, we were served complicated dishes and yet we were left wondering what we were eating. -Under no circumstances would I recommend eating here a la carte. This is a ""go big or go home"" format. -Presentation was fantastic.  -The menu at the restaurant varied from the menu online. It was like 75% the same. -We received zero pressure to do the wine pairings. I have found that's not always the case in Chicago.  -I recommend declining the wine pairings because Graham Elliot will not serve you enough food to balance all the alcohol. People at neighboring tables who ordered the pairings were getting bombed. From our window seats, we witnessed other people stumbling outside as they left. -The highlights of the meal were the goat cheese and the halibut. The goat cheese course was not even on the menu and tasted nothing like goat cheese in its traditional form. Whatever was done to it, it was awesome.  -Graham Elliot parked his Prius illegally in front of his restaurant and spent a tremendous amount of time standing by the bar. He did not do the rounds as I have seen other celebrity chefs do. But I don't blame him. I wouldn't do the rounds, either.  Throughout the meal (experience?), we were served a crazy mixture of textures and flavors. Probably the best way to sum up this place would be to quote the great Ken Griffey Jr. during his appearance on The Simpsons: ""Wow, it's like there's a party in my mouth, and everyone's invited!""",0.9907,0.846,0.131,0.023,0.4704545454545455

2012-09-16,1.0,"Seriously one of the worst meals I have ever had. I have no idea what the hype is about with this place. First of all, half of our party was 20 minutes late for a 7pm reservation. The half that was there was not seated, and then when the other half arrived, they said we had to wait until 8pm. At 8pm we were seated at a table that had been empty the entire time we sat at the bar. The staff was pretentious, as was the presentation of the food--a group of waiters came to the table, each with a plate, and they fanned around us setting them down one at a time, as if they were performing a synchronized swim. The food was minimal, and we all were dreaming of getting a burger at Portillo's on the way home. More attention was paid to the artful presentation of food--7""  plates with a tiny bite or two of something in the bottom corner, and small dots of reductions fanning up the plate. The whipped oyster cream left a nasty taste in my mouth, as did the courses that had ash--yes, literal ash--sprinkled on them. Not sure why anyone would want those tastes lingering. I suppose this is a place foodies would like, but if you want to have a satisfying meal that's more about you than the chef and staff, go somewhere where good food is the draw. We paid $500 for this meal (w/only one glass of wine)--yes, that's right, $500!!! Crazy.

2012-09-14,4.0,"My wife and I were joined by another couple tonight at Graham Elliot and indulged in the 14 course repertoire menu. We arrived a bit early and took a seat at the bar while waiting for our friends. Walking in I noticed that Graham Elliot is considerably larger than most of the fine dining venues I have frequented in Chicago (referencing the restaurant, not the owner). The tables fortunately are spread out a bit, but the restaurant and bar area were a bit on the noisy side. There is a modern, funky vibe. I perused the cocktail list (which had some interesting combinations) and ordered a Port Royal consisting of whiskey, rum, allspice, and some citrus which was very pleasant. In addition to cocktails there are several craft beers and a nice wine list (cocktails run $13 and wines by the glass average $16).  We were seated on time and handed menus; there is an a la carte option, a nine course tasting menu and the fourteen course repertoire; I strongly would discourage anyone from ordering a la carte as you would have to spend far more than the cost of the tasting menu in order to have enough food to suffice as a meal. The entire table must opt for the same menu; the tasting menu is the size of a small to moderate meal in a more traditional restaurant and the repertoire adds up to the size of a moderate to large meal - make sure you are in for the long haul though as you should expect at least a three hour culinary journey with the repertoire. Dinner includes complimentary still or sparkling water and at the end of the meal French Press coffee is available for $6.  Our server got off to a bad start in that three in our party do not eat foie gras and this was one the only course on the repertoire we wanted substituted. Our waiter informed us that no substitutions were possible for this course. We were rather taken a back as most restaurants are more accommodating of what seemed such a reasonable request and the server came across as rather smug to not at least check with the chef. We informed him that we would opt for the tasting menu instead (as no foie was on the shorter tasting menu). He departed and the mood at the table was dampened. A few minutes later he came back and announced that the Chef had informed him that he would be willing to make a substitution for the foie. Fortunately for the rest of the evening service improved aside from a couple of minor gaffes (i.e. one course was delivered and explained while one member of our party was in the bathroom). On a positive note the service was very attentive and on one occasion when my wife accidentally spilled her nearly empty glass of sparkly our server replaced it with a full glass without charge (I was tempted to spill my glass of wine as I was down to the last couple of sips, but opted to not push my luck). In general the food was quite interesting and had beautiful plating and some exotic flavor combinations. We learned that they had just rolled out several new courses tonight as part of their Fall menu. Chef Brochu took over the kitchen a few months back and his influence was pronounced; this was definitely a high caliber meal. At this price point ($145 for the repertoire) I had lofty expectations and while this was overall an excellent meal, I have had slightly better tasting menus in recent months at lower price points such as at Goosefoot, Boka and Next. For me there was definitely some courses I loved, some that were decent and a couple that were just OK. My favorites on the night were the broccoli course that had the most delicious cheddar cheese powder, the cheese course coated with ash and the dessert course with sassafras, root beer powder, almond cake and plum sorbet. The egg course with truffle and Parmesan and the pork belly course with chicory and huckleberry were quite good as well. The food (but not the experience) reminded me of Sprout and of El Ideas (which happens to be the venue Chef Brochu worked at just prior to transitioning to Graham).  Graham Elliot was nearly at capacity tonight and Chef Graham himself was in house. He is a larger than life figure and made rounds mingling with lots of the patrons. I was able to spend a few moments with him on the way out. I am glad to have finally experienced this venue and in most cities this would be among the very best, but Chicago has so many awesome restaurants that at this price point, as much I as enjoyed myself,  I just  do not see myself becoming a regular.",0.9985,0.837,0.134,0.029,0.5008230530644324

The food is incredible.  The menu is set up to do the tasting menus.  If you go and order a la carte, know that you will leave hungry.  However, we did the 8 course tasting with the wine pairings and left feeling pleasantly full.  The flavors in the dishes are incredible, and the portions are perfectly thought out to not over-power with the strong flavors.  While the food was awesome, I think that the flavors are too strong to have larger portions. Service is something that I have not experienced in any other restaurant in Chicago.  From the call to confirm the reservations when they asked for dietary restrictions, allergies or preferences, to being asked if we were on a time table or could enjoy a more leisurely meal, to the detailed descriptions of the food and drinks, the entire staff at Graham Elliott showed their pride in the restaurant.  Can't wait to come back!",0.9932,0.84,0.147,0.013,0.528078078078078

To be fair, we walked in without a reservation on a Friday at 7:30pm after attending an art show at a gallery in the lower level of this building.  We knew it might be hard to get in but figured we'd chance it. The hostess was very polite when she explained that we could not be seated at a table but did explain that we could be seated at the bar or the large communal table in the bar area. We were pointed in the direction of the bar and left to fend for ourselves. This was actually better than I expected, I hadn't thought we could get in at all.  I am nerdy about food and was so excited to eat here!

2012-08-13,4.0,"We were in Chicago for the weekend and very much wanted to try a Graham Elliot restaurant.  I can say that this restaurant did not disappoint, but a couple negatives keep me from giving the highest marks, particularly compared to other high-end establishments. We decided for once not to give into complete decadence and each went with the 5 course tasting menu instead of the 13-course chef's menu.  My wife and I also upgraded one aspect of our respective meals; she requested the winter truffles on her risotto and I asked for the Wagyu beef.  Oddly enough, we each thought little of our own ""upgrades"" but appreciated the other's.  Unlike her, I found the winter truffles wonderfully pungent and well worth the cost.  As for the Wagyu beef, I've sampled it numerous times at different establishments and think I really just don't have an appreciation for it.  Since I normally prefer to tear into a leaner New York Strip Steak as opposed to a Ribeye, maybe this is just a matter of taste, but regardless, I thought that was money not well spent. Now, I'm normally a big eater and have come away hungry from some high end establishments, but I can honestly say that we were well-fed here.  However, I did find it odd that they offered no bread or amuse bouche, and I'm disappointed they apparently stopped serving the truffle popcorn. As a final positive note, I did also want to give my compliments to the bartender.  The Old-Fashioned cocktail I had at the beginning of the night.was seriously one of the best I've ever tasted. A couple of issues stop me a little short of giving the full five stars. First, when we arrived, the restaurant was only about 50% full.  And yet, we were shown to a small table when I saw other couples at larger tables.  Later, I saw other couples being led to larger tables as well.  As I've said in past reviews, I seriously wonder if my reservation through Open Table somehow keeps dooming us to worse seats than if we just called ourselves.  Next time, I plan to do that instead of using Open Table, as I'm getting pretty sick of the second class citizen treatment that seems to follow from using their service. Second, the plating of the food, while initially beautiful and artistic, eventually conveys a vague sense of dissatisfaction.  The general idea is to load it all on a side, or corner, and leave as much open plate space as possible.  Gorgeous at first, like viewing modern art on a canvas, but eventually makes you start feeling like you're getting very little food.  Again, with no bread, amuse bouche, or popcorn, a sense of scarcity is created, which probably influenced the criticisms along these lines by other reviewers. Third and finally, I had the hardest time understanding our servers.  I'm from the Bay Area, California, land of many, many accents, and I'm generally pretty good at deciphering all of them, but for some reason I just could not understand some of the things our servers said.  Might not be their fault, as I did go swimming earlier that day and maybe had water in my ear.  On a related note, while service from our waiter was fine and he was friendly enough, isn't it normally the waiter's job to explain the dishes?  At least that's been my experience at other places. So overall, a very good place with some nitpicky issues.  Definitely a Chicago gem worth visiting.",0.9966,0.757,0.17,0.074,0.48823387582881256

We went the tasting/wine pairings route, which was very enjoyable. Every dish was unbelievably complex, ranging from edible flowers (who knew?) to fantastic wagyu beef and halibut. The wine pairings were great, and married with their course astonishingly well. The final dessert pairing was a little different, I think it was Pedro Ximenez or something. A very thick, raisin flavored sherry, comparable to maple syrup. My wife wasn't the biggest fan, but I though it was a cool twist. The staff graciously substituted a lighter wine, as they quickly noticed she wasn't too happy with it. Pretty cool in my book; without asking they brought her a secondary, more palatable option. Everything about this place was the tops (including the bill!). We will for sure be back, but it may have to wait until tax season LOL :) Thanks Graham Elliot for a wonderful anniversary dinner!",0.9983,0.654,0.323,0.022,0.6194565696649029
2012-07-31,5.0,"It's hard to know where to begin with this review. First, I am perplexed at the negative experiences described by some of the reviewers. I don't know where you ate, but you must be getting GE mixed up with someplace else. I took my wife here to celebrate our 5th anniversary, and we're still talking about it days later. It was great in every aspect. The service here is like a well oiled machine. The wait staff is extremely attentive and on top of your every need, but manage to do so without hovering at all. They were all friendly, and knowledgeable.  As for the food, it's really an experience more than a meal. For those who ""left hungry,"" you must be morbidly obese. We were both prepared to need to get more food after leaving here when we read the reviews, but neither of us were hungry at all. We did the tasting menu, and had a hard time picking a favorite. The presentation is immaculate, and the flavors are hard to express in words. I've never before wanted to savor every bite as much as I did at GE.  The tasting menu is on the high end price-wise, but very, very worth it.",0.9822,0.817,0.146,0.037,0.4614166666666667

In terms of food...Heavenly!  The food was excellent.  We did the food tasting, which was a 7-8 course meal if you include the interim chocolate foam dish which is supposed to cleanse the palate.  Yes, the food portions are small but that is what is expected from a multi-course fine dining restaurant.  Surprisingly at then end of the meal I didn't feel hungry, but I wasn't stuffed either.  But the quality and detail to the food was top notch.  Every bite was full of flavor.  Every taste sense was going crazy, from salty to sweet, bitter to sour and of course the new sense umami...and boy was some of the dishes savory and delectable.  The truffle mushroom risotto was to die for.  My wife loved the pork belly and the wagyu ribeye was AMAZING!!!   Because we had such a wonderful experience I had to post something here because I didn't want anybody to miss out on this wonderful gem of a restaurant.  It's definitely Michelin star-rated for a reason.  We definitely will be coming back.   Thanks to the wonderful staff at Graham Elliot for a wonderful and memorable 5 year anniversary.",0.9989,0.677,0.283,0.041,0.6424651924651924

2012-07-21,5.0,"A legitimately underrated spot in Chicago. Everyone has probably seen Graham on Masterchef and wondered how good his restaurant is.  I can definitively say that I absolutely loved it. I ate at GE while on a swing through the mid-west and GE had the unenviable situation of being my dinner reservation the night after I had my mind blown eating at Alinea and while certainly not on that level, the food was quite good. I loved the foie gras lollipop with pop rocks...never would have thought of it but was quite delicious.  Truffle butter popcorn was great...probably ate too much of it. The plates are small, but if you get a tasting menu, you get a ton of them, and the dishes were very nicely balanced and the presentation was beautiful.

2012-06-26,5.0,"Graham Elliot has been our list for a long time since it's a name often spoken in Chicago foodie and culinary circles. I'm also a devoted lollapalooza participant and admire the work Chef E has done with Chowtown. Another catalyst to try the flagship (I've been to grahamwhich and want to try the Bistro) is that an unusually large number of people in recent months have given high marks to ge. I'm very suspect of the entire Michelin Guide rating system but especially so when they give our their ""stars."" I can say I completely agree that GE deserves a star and is one of the best dining experiences we've had in the past year. There is a lot to love about the experience but most important is that the food lives up the high marks and delivers interesting yet not complicated courses. In addition to the food I really enjoyed the atmosphere and especially the soundtrack - it was as if they were playing my iPod or Pandora station all night. I'm not one to usually notice the music (unless it's painful), but Erica definitely got sick of me saying ""that's another great song!"" (It also makes sense given the combined affection for all things Lolla). The service was very good without being in the way or noticeable - they were all very well trained. Why did I love the food so much? There wasn't any one course in particular that caught my attention and screamed ""this is amazing!"" But when I'm enjoying a 10 course meal, consistency (no bombs) and an element of surprise are key to having a good time and keeping your attention. I really enjoyed the pea (soup) course (reminded me of my mother's pea soup) and the risotto - super rich with parmesan, basil and truffle. The main courses of halibut and beef were spot on and fun. My beef was slightly under-cooked to my enjoyment but the flavors were very nice and simple - letting the food speak for itself instead of trying too hard. One common theme throughout was flowers and floral notes. I liked having that commonality with each course and something to tie them all together. We started with 'sparklers' - something oyster tasting, the foielipop (foie gras with pop rocks) and frozen orange juice. 'Pea' was next and it was soup form but with really tasty treats on the plate, especially the ham. Next up was 'crab' with some interesting sauces but the best part was the powered bbq sauce/flavor. 'Risotto' was next and I'm glad they put it right before the intermezzo. It's a delicious and perfectly cooked risotto but extremely rich and flavorful. One of the best courses of the night. I honestly don't remember what was in the intermezzo besides a lot of flowers and some white powdery substance that really does numb and clean your palate. 'Halibut' was also one of my favorites but mostly because of the vegetables and not the fish. I liked the halibut, it too was perfectly prepared and tasted great but I was captivated with whatever they did to the vegetables and the powered brown butter. The beef course was probably my least favorite but still very good. The meat was under cooked for my taste but I really enjoyed the bites of medium cooked  and thought the onion, chive and thyme seasoning was a nice addition but did not over power the natural flavors. The final three courses were 'cheddar', 'doughnut' and 'chocolate'. Of the three, the cheddar course was my favorite because it was the cheese course but done with a lot of small parts that all combined for an interesting experience. The mini biscuit was awesome and I really liked the small bits of chorizo and sauce. The chocolate was rich and good but my favorite was the apricot sorbet and fresh apricots with small pieces of chilies.  I thought our entire meal top to bottom was fantastic and completely worth the price. It's a sophisticated and special restaurant without feeling fancy. The menu is playful and creative but approachable in execution and presentation. It's exactly what I would look for in a meal of this length and price range for the occasion. I just hope it doesn't take me a year to return.",0.9997,0.693,0.278,0.029,0.5970833333333333
2012-06-18,3.0,"Perhaps I expected too much. When it comes to fine dining, I have been lucky to have tried a lot of amazing places (Per Se, French Laundry, Eleven Madison, Gary Danko and the list goes on) so forgive me if this is me being a little picky.  Had a 9pm reservation. They were not ready for us. The guy at the host stand was wrestling with the curtain in front of the coat check trying to find someones coat. He sent us to the bar while he wrestled some more and eventually found that coat. Good for him. Why was I still standing? By 9:20pm we finally sat. Things  must have changed. The music was not ridiculously loud as reported here on Yelp. It was absolutely perfect. We did not order until 9:45pm.  The menu was set and as such our waiter balked at my request to add some of the famous popcorn to our tasting menu(which we offered to pay for of course). He went back and forth, getting it ""approved"" and such to finally come back and say they would do it. Phew. Did not realize it was such a hard request.  For the record, that was one of the meal highlights! Incredible.  We brought our wine and the corkage fee was a good rate of $ 25.00 The tasting consisted of the following: oyster- great pea- went perfectly with the Iberica ham lobster- my absolute favorite. It was awesome carbonara- was amazing but would have liked it hotter. It was barely warm. The rest: redfish, jidori, cheese and milk was just OK. Now I know these places have small portions. Been there done that. I usually get upset when people complain at leaving hungry. I always tell them they are not grasping the concept and that this is not meant to be an all you can eat buffet. Thing is that this time around, I DID leave hungry. Most fine dining places bring out some intermezzo items which when combined with your amuse bouche and maybe bread, round out a meal. This time around, not so much. As much as I was able to enjoy the courses I favored, I was left wondering "" what if this is as good as it gets"". It finally came a point where I said "" yup, that was as good as it got"".  It started lukewarm, became sizzling hot and died out only a lonely cold memory.  Therefore,  3 1/2 stars to the good courses, the service and ambiance.  Next time, will spend my time and money elsewhere.  Disappointed.",0.9879,0.812,0.136,0.052,0.6075471698113208

When my husband and I travel we like to eat at places of highly acclaimed chefs. We went here for our last night on vacation in Chicago and definitely were not disappointed. It was probably the most expensive meal I've ever had but we ordered the full tasting menu (which is think is 12 small dishes per person) along with the full wine & spirits pairings. Each plate was a completely different experience. One thing I appreciate is when A. the waitstaff is very well informed about what they are serving and B. the chef is completely innovative. Each thing we had was something we would have never thought of, for example, the split pea soup with marshmallow cream. It was a dining experience to say the least. I think when you go somewhere like this you need to make it about who you are with and the time you have to just sit and dine together. Graham Elliot makes this experience exactly that. It was so fun to try new things and talk about it and just share that moment. Downside, the wine and spirits pairings....while everything complimented what we were eating, due to the small food portions we were completely wasted by the time we left.

Service at GE is a symphony of precision without pretense.  The jeans attire on all staff is a terrific way to respect a serious endeavor, fine dining, without the nose-in-the-air demeanor of too many Chicago establishments.  There were 12 courses in the Repertoire menu (who's counting) and yes I understand these are not large servings (please see any Bucca di Beppo for the gluttony size portions) however they were perfectly sized and well timed.  Do give yourself ample time on this menu and I suggest the wine pairings to accompany.  Learning about each dish and why this or that particular wine was chosen, always adds to the pleasure of the dish and meal.  This evening was no exception--we traveled the globe and the pairings were spot on, every time.  Obviously influenced by Jamie and perhaps her work at Avenues in The Peninsula or just years of wine study. Decor is warm, not euro-neuvo-cold; plenty of wood, good sound, great windows with plenty of natural light.  I don't particularly mind the menu changes as I think it keeps the offering fresh and of course seasonal.  The amount of edible flowers was impressive, as was the truffle course, foie, crab and beef.  I enjoyed the ""sparklers"" to start and loved the ""doughnut"" to finish.

For me, liking only half the servings (out of 12) is not a good percentage for the amount of money being spent.  I wanted to like this place but I can't recommend this place in good conscious.

This was my first time dining here, so I can't really diss this tasting menu focused incarnation, but I do understand why some people are not happy with the change. Our waiter was quick to point out that the tasting menus were carefully thought out, which I don't doubt, but I wonder if it was meticulously planned to be repetitive. My wife and I opted for the 14-course Repertoire menu, which in retrospect was entirely gluttonous. The pea soup and carbonara both had prosciutto or a similarly cured ham. There were at least 4 dishes that incorporated a sorbet or ice cream. And OK, it's spring time, but that doesn't mean edible flowers, onions and ramps have to feature so prominently in everything. On their own, these are all relatively minor details, but even as delicious as everything was, my palette definitely tired of all the similar flavors and textures by the end. Of the 10 savory courses, the most interesting dishes were definitely presented in the first half (see: ""Popcorn"" and ""Lobster""), by the end it was a lot of classical flavor pairings and heavier sauces. The most pleasant surprise came during the dessert sequence; I definitely enjoyed the savory nature of the 3 desserts. ""EVOO"" gets two thumbs way up from this guy.

Endless amounts of truffle popcorn was complimentary, there were plenty of a la carte options to choose from, the service was warm and friendly, and we walked out not wanting to eat for the next week. We couldn't wait to go back for more! Last night we took a group of friends to dine at Graham Elliot and were underwhelmed to say the least. Apparently a new chef was brought in a numerous changes have been made. They now only offer four appetizers and four entrees a la carte, and are really pushing the tasting menus. The appetizer and entree portions were smaller and more pricey from what we remembered. And, the biggest bummer is there is no longer complimentary yummy popcorn brought to the table. Our service was just average. In my opinion, for these prices one should have more food options available, excellent service, and not leave hungry.

2012-04-21,4.0,"This place is amazing in a lot of ways.  A couple dishes are disappointing, but for the most part, the food is exciting and delicious.  I'll put aside the price tag, since that's just the way these places work.  The service was pretty good, although I have to say that some people were a bit affected, and our sommelier/waiter(?) was a little breathless and nervous...maybe a bit hyper.  (He once asked me how I liked a dish and then literally walked away before I could even answer.)  But, this staff has obviously been very vigorously trained, and they run a tight ship.  Most were exceedingly friendly and helpful.   (BTW, they invited us back to the kitchen after our meal, which was cool.  I'm not sure if they do that for everyone or if they did it because it was my dad's birthday, but it was nice.  Unfortunately, the kitchen was basically all cleaned up for the night, so there wasn't a whole lot to see, but we appreciated the gesture.) Let's get to the food though.  We had what I believe is a brand new spring menu (as in I believe it was announced in the last few days).  Keep in mind that some of the dishes are way more complicated than I'm able to describe.  (3+ hours of eating lol.) Radish with yuzu reduction/gel?: An amuse bouche.  It's fine. Oyster: Smoked oyster mousse with some greens.  I really liked it, but the boyf did not, and he loves oysters. Popcorn: This was so great.  Popcorn gelato, cheddar powder, cheese frico.  LOVE. Pea: One of my favorites!  Pea broth with jamon iberico (omg yesssss), lavender, crispy shallots, some flowers etc.  Amazing.   Lobster: Also a favorite.  Beautiful butter poached lobster with a lobster butter type sauce, tarragon, lemon gel, lobster gelee, and a small piece of lobster sausage.  LOVE. Crawfish: Okay, but not my favorite.  Crawfish tails and a tiny piece of frog leg in a sort of creole crawfish emulsion with dianthus and other foliage.  Sauce was too salty, greens were too aggressive.  It tasted like eating something from the garden that you shouldn't eat...like the bitter taste is supposed to be a warning not to eat it lol.  (Just a note, I did get really sick of eating flowers on basically every dish.  I know this is supposed to be a spring menu, but enough already.) Carbonara: I really loved this.  Deconstructed carbonara.  Pappardelle pasta, parmesan and cream sauce, guanciale (cheek bacon...ommm nom nommmmmm), parmesan-flavored ""egg shell,"" and an egg yolk.  Mom and boyf didn't like it, but neither one likes soft eggs.   Foie: Okay, yell at me if you want, but I really didn't enjoy this at all.  In fact, it was one of my least favorite dishes.  Szechuan braised foie gras over tiny diced mushrooms, asparagus, and scallions with a cherry thyme gel.  Sounds great.  Didn't like it at all.  The texture of the foie was really not enjoyable.  It kind of tasted like eating albumen or something (that white goop that seeps out of salmon or pork, etc., when you cook it too fast. Just not pleasant.)  The boyf and I both were not fans, but my parents both liked it. Intermezzo - (not on the menu, but a palate cleanser basically like a sorbet) Blood orange ""popsicle.""  Meh, fine. Crab: Really, really good.  It's also beautiful.  Piece of king crab with artichoke puree (I think?) mustard, mussel gel, dill, and leek chips.  (And some other stuff I can't remember.) Redfish: My absolute favorite!  Amazing piece of redfish with flake salt over what I believe was a pomme puree with ramps, roasted tomatoes, capers, caperberry, etc.  So beautiful. Jidori: Half good, half bad.  A sous vide piece of Jidori chicken breast (the skin still on, which is kind of not the best with sous vide, but the taste of the chicken was great), confit leg and thigh in aspic (awesome), chicken liver mousse (really good), vidalia, etc.   But the sauces...no me gusta.  Blueberry gastrique, and some other stuff I can't remember, but it was really sour and bitter and just generally tasted gross together.  Blech.   (Now start the dessert courses) Cheese: OMG, my favorite dessert.  The first of three gelatos.  I can't remember what kind of cheese was used in this one, but it was a triple cream.  The gelato was over peanut puree and a bit of jelly (couldn't hear what kind), and crispy something (again, couldn't hear what it was, but it was effing awesome). E.V.O.O.: Really interesting.  I first took a bite of the olive oil gelato, and it was interesting, but not necessarily something I'd want to eat a lot of.  BUT, then I tried it with the almond cake, and it was awesome! Milk: ""Milk"" gelato with chocolate ""shortbread,"" crumbled oreos and oreo cream pure.  Pretty great. Doughnut: Really interesting and tasty.  You get an espresso cup with a piece of espresso gelee in it (and perhaps chocolate powder?), and then you add a hot ""doughnut cream,"" which is like a really nice custard that tastes like funnel cake.  Really cool, and a nice little finish to the meal.",0.9996,0.721,0.231,0.048,0.645153693266901
2012-04-03,2.0,"We went here this past week not really doing much research; sometimes I prefer to not research on Yelp beforehand so I don't sit and agree with problems people point out. The problem is, it seems this restaurant has experienced a drastic change in what it was and what it is now. From reading the reviews, it seems like there used to be a regular a la carte menu, where you'd order your $20 appetizer and $35 entree and call it a day.  Now you have a choice between three tasting menus, conveniently the prices left off of their web site but were for the 5 course $75, for the 10 course $125, and for 12-15 course the $150.  Wine pairings were tiered accordingly, $100, $75 to match the 10 course, and $50 for the 5 course. We were told most people do the middle option, which leaves you at $200 a person, plus the initial drink they hit you up for ($15-20--more on that later) plus tax/tip. So all in all, you're looking at most people on average are spending $290/person with wine pairings. The service really, really rubbed me the wrong way. I'd say it was downright sleazy even. Upon seating, before we were given a drink or food menu, we were asked what we'd like to start off drinking. We asked and were given the wine menu but still not told anything about the food, nowhere did a food menu come along. We're dropping $1200 for 4 people and you don't have the decency to bring us a food menu along side the wine menu so we can appropriately pair a $150 bottle of wine with our meal?  In $$$$ restaurants I would expect an offering of the sommelier even.  Strike. A normal server at this point would've said ""have you been here before?"" ""no, well, what we do typically is a tasting menu with wine pairings"" ... Instead, our hipster server got us to take down our drink order as fast as possible, knowing that was adding another $100 to our check, even though the meal was set up to include an abundant amount of wine pairings. A few of us wanted Champagne, so we debated on a $200 bottle of Champagne but ultimately one of us got their only Champagne by the glass ($24), another a $15 cocktail, and two of us a nice rose sparkling ($20).   Only at that point did they bring us the food menu, after we had ordered the first round of drinks. 'Oh look, hey it's not only not a la carte and is a tasting menu, there's a wine pairing menu.' SLEAZY. There's no other way to say it, this was sleazy service. And if I had to guess, very deliberate. Upon getting the tasting menu options laid out before us, we were told most people do the wine pairings. We were told they also may do other creative cocktails other than wine, or beer even, though(none of that was actually true, it was straight up wine, which was fine). One thing that stood out about the menu was there wasn't a single red meat item on it.   So we could've easily ordered 3 really nice bottles of white wine, maybe one red, and called it a day, and still been out even or ahead of where we were.   Insult to injury? The first wine that came out in our wine pairings was a glass of Champagne for everyone, after we had just ""done"" that round essentially. Also, to clear the air, I've had a lot of haute cuisine meals in my life, and even more than my share of tasting menus in this style.  I'm comfortable spending $300/person on a nice meal, a unique experience, and I understand portion size in tasting menus. I'm not one of ""those"" people whining because of those issues.  I get it.  Out came the food course by course.  Pretty much every course was two 15 gram portions of some protein with some highly concentrated flavored gel.  It is what it is. I can't even remember much of the specifics, there was a lobster nibble early on, and even though we didn't order the full menu they gave us foie lollypops.  They were probably the only thing I'd really remember in a few months, the foie a very ""user friendly"" mousse style that could've been any other mousse, coated in pop-rocks. Typically I giggle at people who say ""we went out and had a real meal after"" because this type of menu didn't fill them up, but GE's didn't have a single red meat item or a single protein course that was more than one bite, so in this case I actually get their sentiment.   The music was off-putting, for my 30 year-old-ears I could stay home and listen to Sleigh Bells too without having to yell over it to converse with our friends from out of town.  There were 2 times during our meal where someone made a quick break to the bathroom after finishing our course, but the servers still brought our next course out and explained it while that person was missing. Considering they had taken away the menu when we ordered, I find this to be of bad service. Even if there were menus for that person to come back and ""catch up"" on what we were looking at, a place of this caliber would typically hold back on delivering the food to the table until everyone is seated back again. 2* = ""Meh.

As far as the newly designed menu, go all out and get the Repertoire (we had the spring 2012) -- two dishes that were only offered in this option were two of my favorites -- the popcorn course (perhaps to make up for taking away the free popcorn -- boo! hiss!) and the foie course (ah, foie and cherry. you are my peanut butter and jelly).   I was pleased that foie-llipops were still offered (a nice surprise since it wasn't listed in the menu).  They offer it as a ""course within a course"" before the foie course.  But my question is since the foie isn't offered in all the menus, do you not get the foiellipops otherwise? A shame, because they are so awesome.  Also I think they rotate the flavor of pop rocks coating, but word to the wise, watermelon is the best! P.S.

We had the tasting menu and were blown away. The delicious popcorn to start your meal was a great informal touch which really made me love this place.  Fast forward to Valentine's Day when my wife and I returned. To our surprise a new chef, tasting only menu, fewer tables, and a cleared out bar area completely changed the restaurant. It was a huge bummer - the food was overly formal. For us we were sad the original restaurant is gone. The price for the new ""5 star"" experience is not worth it - I'd rather go spend my money at Bonsoiree, Per Se, Del Posto, or many of the other top restaurants that charge $150+ a diner.

I'd just made a good amount of money from a recent project and wanted something different and on the expensive side. The food itself was rather good. It was presented in a very good manner and the taste was exquisite. The servers were very well trained and knowledgeable when they brought us out our food. They would tell us what the dish was and what was the best way to eat it get the full flavor profile. Make sure you pay attention because the way you eat it actually has a lot of impact on how it tastes. Certain things are meant to be eaten together in the same bite to give it its maximum use of whichever ingredient. My only complaint about this place is that the portions were small but then again it's fine dining and that's the trend nowadays. Smaller portions.,0.9772,0.831,0.146,0.023,0.5244903926482873
2012-03-10,1.0,"I am sad about having to write this review. I have been to Graham Elliot a few times before and I loved it. It was fun. The food was delicious as well as creative and whimsical.   Instead of bread they served amazing truffle popcorn.   It was great. So last night we saw there were open reservations and decided to bring our friends to try it. I will go into more detail, but I left just depressed that the great restaurant that used to be there is essentially gone.  To begin, you now may not order a la carte, which I usually have no problem with, just noting the change, and in this context I have a bit of a problem with it because it is somewhat inconsistent with the fun, somewhat casual experience I had at the restaurant before. Also, I can't say for certain that nothing on the menu is the same, but I can say that all my favorite dishes are gone. No Caesar. no cheddar risotto. As mentioned before, no popcorn.  Much more importantly, the food was just totally uninteresting.  Instead of being creative and whimsical it just seemed overworked-complicated for it's own sake, not because it added anything to the dish.  And honestly it just wasn't good. It was boring and under seasoned.  At some point I just started leaving food on my plate because I just wasn't particularly interested in eating it.    Overall, I just went home sad.  I loved this place, but it's a completely changed.  It seems to want to be a standard fine dining restaurant, but the food, aside from not being what it was, is just not good.  I will not be going back.",0.8624,0.696,0.171,0.133,0.5669940476190477

As others have said before, the portions are ridiculously small.  Many courses were only 1-2 bites, including the ""amuse bouche"" that ended up being the first course of the meal, as opposed to an unexpected bonus.  The courses were very good, but certainly not worth a $400+ tab (pre-tax and gratuity). If you're looking to drop that kind of money in Chicago, you'll be much happier at Moto, or even more traditional places like Spiaggia or Everest.

2012-02-15,4.0,"What a difference a year makes.  I took my wife to GE just over a year ago for our anniversary and had a true 5-star experience.  The five course tasting menu was simply amazing.  There was the deconstructed and oh so flavorful caesar salad; a fantastic Thai-inspired squash soup spiked with curry, lemongrass, and kaffir lime; the gorgeous wagyu beef and deeply flavorful truffle consume that I still dream about to this day; and finally a creative take on s'mores for an unforgettable dessert.  Throw in some great cocktails and a dinner soundtrack of Girl Talk's ""Feed The Animals"" playing in the background and I was hooked.  This was not your typical white table cloth fine dining experience and I loved it.   With such a great first experience, we decided to come back about a year later for the wifey's bday.  By this time GE had restructured their menu so we went with the more extensive Collection Menu.  Instead of walking away discussing yet another amazing dinner, we left scratching our heads wondering, ""What happened?""  First off, where was GE's famous truffle-parm popcorn that started our meal last time around?  Maybe they don't serve it anymore or they just plain forgot.  In either case I would normally give this a pass (it is just popcorn after all), but what really struck me was the food, both in terms of taste and quantity.  In general, the food just lacked the balance and pop of flavor that makes your eyes big and your head nod after the first bite.  To compound the issue, when we did encounter a dish we liked (the lobster risotto, for example) there just wasn't enough of it to enjoy.  Plating was artistic and, at times, playful, but the use of large dishware that had more white space than food only served to highlight the size of each course, or lack thereof.  I can appreciate proper portion size over ten courses, but we were honestly still hungry when we left.  Even the best course of the night, a reinterpretation of steak and eggs cheerfully presented as a smiley face, just didn't have the depth of flavor that I remember from our first meal here.   Being my wife's bday, the kitchen was kind enough to send our table two foie gras lollipops coated in pop rocks.  Strangely enough, the pastry chef wasn't in that night (so we were told), hence the foie instead of a baked good of some sort.  That's a win for me, but not so much for the bday girl who isn't particularly fond of foie.  I'm not deducting stars on this point (I can't personally knock free foie), but just an interesting close to our meal given how different it was from our first experience.   Averaging out these two experiences leaves me with a 4-star review.  I haven't completely written off GE because of our last dinner, but I'm more inclined to continue exploring Chicago's rich culinary scene before coming back here.",0.9964,0.818,0.153,0.029,0.4794028722600151

2012-02-11,2.0,"READ!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Chef Brian Runge, previous head chef of Graham Elliot, has left.  Unfortunately, so has his great tasting concepts.  My boyfriend and I have been going to the restaurant for the past 6 months regularly and have been very pleased with the food concepts, freshness, service, and overall more relaxed feel for a 1 star Michelin restaurant.  Regrettably, these attributes have vanished, and all that's left is a nasty bixxhy manager, not-surprising food concepts and a crumbling reputation. Oh, and the price have gone up while the food portion shrunk!  I give 2 stars only because the waiters are still great, and the freshness of ingredients is still there.  But, if you have tongue, and prefer not to over pay for crap on a plate, then avoid this place. New Menu Concepts: Ice cream with everything ( i guess its always safe to just serve dessert for nearly every course) Under cooked vegetables (nice and crunchy) CURRY AND YOGURT!!! (it sounds bad because it is) New Manager Attitude: She told us the chef was being uneasy in letting us share their 14-course tasting menu, which we did often while  Brian was the chef. Eventually she told us she's going back to talk to the chef again to see if anything could be changed, but never came back to us with an update and then the course started. As a manager, who told us she worked at Avenue before, it is supposed to be her responsibility to check on customers to make sure they enjoy the food or ask how's everything as a courtesy, OR just hanging out in the dinning area so that people can see her if we have questions! The only time she talked to us was the time she told us the chef was unwilling to let us share the 14-course tasting, and THAT WAS IT. Even when we were getting our coats to leave, she said nothing to us nor looked at us even though she was standing right at the desk! WHAT A PROFESSIONAL SERVICE?! Was it this difficult to even say ""have a good night"" to your customers? Unbelievable!  I will be willing to give this place another try if the new chef acknowledges his defeat by changing his approach and menu and better customer service from the manager.

The decor is clean and modern, the servers wear jackets and ties with jeans(nice, yet approachable) and the music provides a great vibe. I really dug the overall feel of this place! -The flavor combinations were excellent. Everything was unique, well thought out and tasted great! There were definitely stand outs (my personal favorite was the cheese course - it was a cheese ice cream with peanuts and some sort of sweet sauce reminiscent of PB&J that was the perfect combination of sweet and savory) The likes: -I liked leaving feeling not overly stuffed. I didn't leave hungry, but I definitely would have had we went with less courses. I honestly don't know how someone could be full with only 5 of their courses because each dish has TINY portions (like 1-2 bites each).

Instead of getting the wine pairing, we got a bottle of wine instead. First thing they did was got us 2 amuse which was ok, nothing outstanding but it was a nice gesture to start. Here is the menu below cesear-it  was very inventive and a nice surprise because you think every cesear salad would be the same. It look and taste great sunchoke soup-Look very nice but all of the parts didn't really matches together plus I am not a big fan of sunchoke.  turbot-This was the WORST dish on the nite, most of the people didn't finish it plus I thought adding sea urchin would enchance it but it didn't. It was bland and i had to force myself to finish it wagyu-The dish look gorgerous but it didn't really taste that good. I am surprise because normally i would lick up any wagyu meat but this dish didn't really shine chocolate-again it look great but it wasn't rich enough for me. I got to try a few more dishes such as the hen and vension but all of the dishes were a great disappointment. Either it was seasoning correctly or the flavor doesn't really hold well together.

With every single plate we got, there were always a amuse in between which was nice but feel like more a force then feeling more natural. The lollipop foie gras w/the rock candy was ok but I had sooo much better at Brazar in LA. At the end of the meal, I got to go back in the kitchen to meet the Chef of Cusine and he talk w/me alittle and asked me about my meal and I just say I wish I try more things and he say if I knew you were outside then I would gladly send more things out but guess the STUPID front of the house people don't communicate these things to the CHEF.

It was bad and we just wanted out. He brought us 3 desserts anyway (I wish he had just comped an entree) and the desserts were all just okay, and one was actually plain bad.

Unfortunately, I think the restaurant is going downhill as quickly as Elliot's ego is inflating. The food was good, but nothing earth-shattering. The waiter was fine, but hardly on par (i.e. nowhere near) with the cost of the meal. Sprout, where we dined shortly before, was considerably better.

While I was researching restaurants in Chicago I wanted to try, I realized I wouldn't be able to eat everywhere. I was on a few waiting lists but managed to get a reservation for Graham Elliot. The day of my reservation, I was trying to contact one of the restaurants for it seemed something had become available. But no one was answering their phone and their voice mail was full. I was distressed. I didn't know what to do. So I tweeted it. Chef Bowles told me not to come in. He rather the reservation go to someone else who really wanted to go. Well, who said I didn't really want to go? I just had 3 nights. I had to make the most of it. And after a somewhat disjointed meal at Moto, I was ready to see why people are talking about this resto. And why President Obama made it his restaurant of choice when celebrating one of his birthdays. I just hope I think they're as awesome as they think I am (cough). My dining companion wanted to do a tasting menu. I wasn't keen on the 5-course so we went with the 10-course. Our server was very enthusiastic. We admired the single diner next to us for dining alone and doing the wine pairings. How wonderful. When we got a course, she got a course. The kitchen seemed to be working well but then it got a bit tangled up at the end and it took a while for our beef to reach us.  Earlier in the night, I had enjoyed hanging out at the bar. My cocktail was delicious. I didn't think the music was too loud which seemed to be the complaint about restaurant. Service was quite friendly and most of the dishes worked for me.  Now would I be joining Chef Bowles again? It's hard to say. After all, I don't live in Chicago and there are a bazillion restaurants I want to try. He's just going to have to deal with that.

2011-12-19,4.0,"I had a very pleasant birthday dinner here with my boyfriend last night, even though I was a little bit skeptical due to some of the under-whelming reviews on here from previous posters.  It seems like the restaurant is pretty hit-or-miss, but we luckily had one of the better experiences. First, the pros: - We had the ""Collection"" 10 course menu, and while the portions were small (as many of the previous reviewers noted), I was still completely satisfied by the end of the meal.  I would definitely NOT recommend anyone come here for the 5 course menu as you can pretty much expect to leave hungry unless you already ate beforehand. - In addition to the 10 courses, we were served several amuse bouches, which were great little surprises and really served to highlight the various ""intermissions"" between the appys, seafood, and meats. - Great service overall - my water was always refilled very quickly, and the servers were all very pleasant - i had noticed that the foie gras lollipops that everyone raves about was no longer on the menu, when to my surprise they brought out 2 for my boyfriend and I before dessert as a birthday surprise!  It was very nice of them and I really enjoyed the extra touch, plus they were absolutely delicious! Now, the cons: - While overall the dishes were all well-done, there wasn't really anything mind-blowing for me.  There was nothing I just felt like I absolutely had to have again.  The pumpkin was probably my favorite part of dinner - I felt like the deconstructed caesar that everyone raves about actually wasn't that impressive, and the anchovy was a bit jarring. - There were definitely a few cracks in the service here and there - at the start we were told to wait at the bar while they got our table ready, even though there was obviously plenty of tables available, and then they made a mistake when we asked for sparkling water and they brought out still.  It also took quite a while each time for them to bring out the next course, which can seem longer when the portions are so small! Nothing crazy, but also not what I'd expect from a Michelin-starred restaurant. Overall, I'd say while it's a very decent restaurant, there are many other superior Michelin 1-stars in Chicago.  Especially for the price, I would probably eat at Schwa or Next again next time.",0.9981,0.75,0.216,0.034,0.5065359477124182

Last night, we  enjoyed ""the collection"" and were not let down. The team at Graham Elliott tested and tempted our tastebuds with creative combinations, perfectly cooked food and ""all"" enjoyed. There was not a single dish on the menu that didn't work for us.  The service was excellent, the environment was casual, relaxing and unassuming. Why the 4 stars and not 5? Wine. We did the pairing and I was woefully disappointed. Nothing was bad, but nothing really stood out. I felt about halfway through that this pairing menu was the ""value"" menu, maybe their goal was to let us experience regions we may not have tried on our own, but they should have stated that. I still feel let down by it and while I will certainly be back, I most definitely will be skipping the wine pairing.

2011-12-04,5.0,"I had been to GE years ago, before there was a tasting menu. I was a little nervous going into the experience there because of some of the hit-or-miss reviews, but I can't complain a bit about the food - it was fantastic! My first piece of advice - DINE A LA CARTE. We were a party of 6, and it was explained to us that we had the option to go a la carte, or with a tasting menu but that all of us had to get the same tasting (15, 10 or 5) - I'm not positive that's a hard and fast rule, but we quickly ruled that out as an option - we all have very different dining preferences. We ordered appetizers and entrees, and the server, after noting that we had 3 caesar salads and 2 pumpkin soups ordered, gave us a great suggestion - to do a tasting course of the salads and soups for everyone at the table, keep the other two a la carte apps ordered as 'table orders', and then all get individual entrees. That suggestion made the meal! It was a perfect way to sample a lot of things, but only the things that appealed to us. Here is a breakdown: FOOD - Caesar salad, as everyone has said, was good. Solid flavor, and the mascarpone crouton was delicious. We had the tasting portion and as others have noted, it was totally odd that it arrived on a giant plate, but whatever - that's how all their tasting courses come.  - Soup (Pumpkin) was fantastic. I am not the biggest fan of pumpkin, and this is one of the best soups I have ever had! Great balance of salty (from the pepinos) and sweet ... the marshmallows are to die for. This is definitely a must-do on the menu - Mochi - I would never have ordered this but I LOVED it. There were 3 asian-inspired, dumpling-like offerings - fig, chestnut and ricotta/honey - they were all fantastic and well-worth trying. - Lobster Risotto - cooked perfectly, just a bit to much of that sea taste for my preference; others liked it. - I ordered the PORK. It was hands-down the best entree at the table. Tender, juicy, with a subtle coffee and plantain flavor - really superb. - I tasted the scallop and swordfish entrees. I am not a fan of scallops, but these were delicious and perfectly cooked. The swordfish was probably the biggest fail of the night, and not because it was bad, but because it was average. The flavors were not balanced as well on on the plate.  - We shared the chocolate dessert, and were highly unimpressed. Just not worth it. Besides, after having the dinner, you really don't feel like dessert anyway! Overall, great experience. The unique flavors totally trick your brain into thinking you are full by the time you get to the 2nd tasting course - really phenomenal job. One note - they were no longer doing the popcorn. Total bummer. I don't know if they felt it was getting too gimmicky or people were just filling up on it. Instead they offer tiny rosemary popovers, which were good, but not compared to the popcorn!; and a tiny bread course - ours was a miniature version of a loaf with goat cheese butter and persimmon glaze - again, amazing but not the popcorn. I'd like to see them offer a choice of bread or popcorn for the table.  SERVICE From the time we arrived the staff was friendly and casual. I felt very comfortable the entire experience. Our table setting was a bit odd - we were 6, and half the table was up against a large curtain with the kitchen or dish washers behind it - kind of annoying at first, but quickly overshadowed by the great food and service. We were a bit of a rowdy bunch, and our server handled us perfectly - he was super professional and informative, offered us several options, and also had a sense of humor with our group. Again, top notch service. My suggestion is to definitely check this place out - the innovation of food and friendly service are worth it - but go a la carte and get what you want so you leave happy!",0.9991,0.718,0.208,0.074,0.582587012987013

2011-11-22,2.0,"Where to start on this one...... There was a strong debate internally in my mind about giving this 1 star.  But I just can't, because you can obviously see the skill in the preparation of dishes. First, the good: Loved the decor, great vibe inside, a truly buzzing dining room. Serious, serious cooking skill shown in many of the dishes.  Undeniable. The rest: Simply put, the food was literally hilarious in how small the portions were.  I am NOT one of these guys that needs to walk out near death from being stuffed.  I have eaten at some of the best restaurants in this country, where you can see some pretty small portions, especially on tasting menus, but this was actually hilarious.  It doesn't help that they use this monster of a plate, like the size of a serving tray, that makes the portions look all the tinier (I'm sure this is some type of ""artsy"" deal, but it was pretty hilarious in reality). We did the 5 course tasting menu ($75/person).  All of the dishes are really skillfully done, and many of them are a ""play"" on something else.  I'll explain as we go.  I was immediately irritated though when we all said we weren't too hot on the dessert option, and they said we could substitute another one for $5 each.....Um, ""but the desserts are the exact same price""....""well it creates difficulty on the kitchen staff"".  Seriously?  I could not stifle my laugh (they eventually did not charge us after I was incredulous at the absurdity of what he was saying). The first dish was a deconstructed Caesar salad.  Pretty cool honestly.  It's difficult to describe it, but you can see the skill in how it was made.  Again, let's just start this off here, it is minuscule.  When you have dishes this small, you really have to blow me away with taste, not necessarily the amount of work it takes to make it, which I can appreciate, but if the flavors are just OK, what was the point of the work?  I'm not paying you to paint me a painting, or to create some ""food sculpture"" for me to marvel at, I'm paying (a lot) for you to blow me away with flavors.  This didn't.   The next dish was a pumpkin soup.  This was absolutely the highlight of the meal.  Stunning flavors just blew the table away.  And after the amusing first dish, we felt we were back on track with this one.  Cinnamon flavors, hints of marshmallows, and many other flavors really popped.  It was really spectacular on all levels. Next came the first ""entree course"", which was a scallop dish.  I was trying to keep my eyes from  bulging out of my head, to see less than 1 full scallop on my plate.  I mean the absurdity of serving someone less than 1 scallop is just amazing to me.  But I was able to control myself long enough to hear the explanation.  A long-winded, pretentious description, basically told you that this was a play on clam chowder.  And boy was it ever.  It was literally shocking to see all of the ingredients on the plate that would NOT be in a chowder, yet literally taste clam chowder.  But then we all realized, who the hell wants to taste clam chowder instead of a stunning scallop dish.  I mean, huh? But we had the main entree coming, and being starving, I was sure we were going to be satisfied at this point.  A dish of wagyu beef, bone marrow, potatoes and quail egg was sure to be amazing.  When it arrived I had to grab the table, because I literally was going to fall to the ground laughing.  There could not have been more than 2 ounces of beef on my (massively sized plate).  This is not an exaggeration.  The description was that it was a play on breakfast, and that we may immediately think of bacon and eggs, ""Enjoy"".  And again, it was almost shocking.  It tasted EXACTLY like breakfast.  The marrow foam they made (again amazingly crafted, real skill here), combined with the wagyu beef, egg and potato, literally tasted identical to eggs and bacon.  And again I ask....who the F wants to taste bacon and eggs instead of superbly made wagyu beef and bone marrow?  If I want bacon and eggs, I'll go eat bacon and eggs.  At this point I was just literally in disbelief. To top it all off, I really thought the service was pretentious, with most of the servers really having this smugness to them.  Living 10 years in SF, and eating all over the US, I'm not impressed by you, or your attitude.  The more smug you are, the more absurd you seem, because there are so many amazing restaurants that the service is opposite of that.  I love servers who are excited about the dishes you are going to get, excited to tell you about them, and genuinely pleased when you are pleased.  You aren't doing me a fricken ""favor"" to serve me buddy, I'm paying top notch dollars for this service, so save the smug attitude. Overall, I would never go back here.  Way to many places to try next time I'm back in Chicago.",0.9985,0.795,0.155,0.05,0.5695714285714285

2011-11-20,5.0,"To celebrate my brother's birthday, we went for the repertoire tasting menu. Instead of truffled popcorn, they gave us a couple of cheese scones. They were good, similar to the ones served at Province, though I found myself missing the popcorn. The bread course was a persimmon bread sandwiching butter. It was a play on temperature. Tasted pretty good, though for those of you from Taiwan, the presentation would remind you of beetle-nuts. The first few appetizer courses (plus the foie-llipop upon request) were heavy on sugar, walking on the thin line between sweet and savory. As such, it was a bit hit or miss (but even the misses, such as the mochi course, were conceptually engaging). The foie course with huckleberry jam was the one stand-out among the sweet-savory concept. The tartness of the berries paired well with the foie. The lobster course was another great appetizer - perfect execution on risotto complimented by a umami-rich lobster-amanac reduction. I dream about that dish.   The appetizer courses came out pretty quickly. We breezed through the first nine courses under an hour. The waiter seemed to notice that we were trying to catch our breath between courses, and slowed down the pace for us for the rest of the meal. The main dishes really sang. The kitchen could cook seafood like nobody's business. The swordfish and the sturgeon courses were some of the best fish dishes I've ever had in this country. The only exception was the scallop course, which was a play on ""clam chowder."" The concept was fine, but the deconstruction was not successful (the ingredients didn't come together in a way that would make an impact).  After the seafood courses came a cup of herbal tea with matsutake mushroom shaving. The waitstaff presented it as a ""novel"" flavor profile. It was good, but the flavor-profile was not new to me. It reminded of the Chinese-medicine-style (dang-gui based) soup that you cook duck or lamb in. Very nostalgic and heart-warming. The guinea hen course was a knockout - tender with a great crust, accompanied by great flavors (though the kale was slightly salt-heavy) - the dish just worked very well. The pork course was presented with three medallions on top of one another. Each slice tasted different - the bright cilantro, the slightly-bitter coffee, and the sweet plantain made this into a trio-tasting experience. The wagyu dish was a play on steak and egg - a very successful deconstruction dish. The only disappointment was the beef itself - it was not very marbled and didn't live up to the expectation engendered by the word ""wagyu.""      The palate cleanser before the desserts was a shot of warm apple cider. Worked well. The desserts were of a good progression of flavors. We started tart and spicy, continued to creamy and nutty, and ended with rich and chocolaty. Very accomplished pastry chef!   Decor was contemporary chic in a lofty, gallery-like space, the waitstaff was dressed in suits and jeans, and the background music selection was not what you'd find in fine-dining restaurants. If they were going for a casual-fine-dining atmosphere, they've hit the nail on the head. Service was very attentive and accommodating. Our glasses were never empty, and our several requests (including an odd one of charging the valet on my card - I didn't have enough cash) were granted with grace. You could tell the waitstaff was trying very hard to make the evening special. I quite appreciated the intuitive and the can-do service philosophy here.  Graham Elliot is a place that truly shines when you approach it  via its long tasting menu format. The courses were portioned sensibly, and the progression of the meal made a cohesive and compelling point-of-view. Chef Runge continues the mission of deconstructing the classics and elevating the mundanes, but with a wider range of ingredients and with a more multicultural flavor-profile. While not every course was a home-run, the menu never failed to be engaging. The evolution of the kitchen was apparent, and I really liked this reincarnation. This menu reminded me of the former Avenues under Chef Duffy. Mark my words - Graham Elliot is well on its way to receiving that second Michelin star.",0.998,0.818,0.153,0.029,0.5357517922994115

2011-10-25,4.0,"This was such a cool treat for me and my fiance as we celebrated our recent engagement via The Repertoire menu. The food is creative, fun, tasty, and playful. It's familiar, unlike the mystery menu at Alinea where you aren't sure what or how to eat what's in front of you (don't get me wrong, LOVE me some Alinea - just comparing). Service is good - I like that they are casual-cool. It's not as theatrical, polished and rehearsed like other places, but you will be taken care of, which I suppose is what matters. The ambiance is interesting - rock music is playing throughout the speakers and the crowd is everything from an 8-year-old in a tutu at the table next to me, or a group of 4 middle-agers with 20 glasses of wine on the table. All in all, it was a lot of food in the end, I left feeling like I could take a break from eating for a few days and be fine. My only point of contention? The custom menus they left with us to take home ""Welcomed"" my fiance by name at the top, but not me .... at all.

2011-10-23,5.0,"Came here during a trip to Chicago with a friend.  Didn't have reservations on a Saturday evening, so we just showed up at 5pm when the restaurant opened and got a table.  We had a great server - Whitney - who happily guided us through the menu options.  Originally we were going to go for the 5-course tasting menu as the others had dishes that would not have worked with me due to allergies, but the restaurant still had substitutes for me, so we went for the 10-course Collection menu. Before the actual dining experience we had read about the foie gras lollipops which were not on the menu, so we ordered it.  Oh yeah, it really came in a lollipop form, with watermelon-flavored pop rocks around it.  That was definitely something new (and tasty)! Now for the actual Collection menu.  Some favorites: - Pumpkin soup:  it would have been tastier if I followed Whitney's instructions to slowly mix everything so the flavor would come through, but nevertheless it was YUM. - Caesar salad:  whoa.  That was definitely an interpretation.  Normally anchovies are not my thing, but hey, it was a good mix. - Foie gras:  mixed with huckleberries and buckwheat bread.  miam miam. - Scallops:  with popovers - who knew that would work great? - Chicken (hen):  came with a pre-dish thing with matsutake shavings, and then the main course - with more matsutake! - Wagyu:  it's wagyu.  How can't you not like it? So after this we took a long, long walk back to the hotel.  I don't think we worked it off...  So with top-notch service and great food, I'll be back.",0.9905,0.862,0.138,0.0,0.48803661616161614
2011-10-21,2.0,"I am so disappointed writing this review right now...About five courses through the 10 course tasting (the collection) we were ready for it to be over. We just got home from dinner and felt the need to write a review right away. My boyfriend and I had two nights in Chicago and we decided on this as one of our dinners. I wish we chose differently. I was really trying to go by the good yelp reviews and really liked the idea of this place, but it just didn't measure up. Seriously, please listen to me when I say this...listen to the bad reviews on here, they are true. All of them. Our dinner took SO long (3 hrs)...and not a good long, like we are drinking wine and enjoying ourselves and taking our time. The kind of long that we were sitting around looking at our watches waiting for our courses to arrive. The first plate that arrived was so scratched it looked like it had been in circulation for years.  After the 4th course, we asked the server if it was supposed to take increasingly longer in between each course. He told us that the kitchen go slammed...the restaurant was half full! Really? How do they handle a busy night? Or do they even have a busy night? It was Friday night at 9:00 and there were plenty of open tables (that should have been a sign...), it just didn't seem right. I had asked around to other foodie friends, and even chef friends and nobody seemed to have heard anything about it, or they just said oh, its good. I should have realized why nobody really had anything to say...because there's nothing to say. Should I even tell you about each course? I don't know...I guess I will since we got a menu to take home. I'll keep it simple, the good, the bad, and the whatever: The good: the amuse with caviar and pickle, the crab, pumpkin, lobster risotto (pretty good), canape with lardo dates and almonds, intermezzo, and the chocolate. The bad: swordfish (undercooked and one of us had a bloody vein in the tiny piece we got-don't you think you'd get a prime cut for the price?), scallop (mostly raw and one was gritty), waygu (pretty much raw, tough, and the marrow foam was flavorless), bitters. The whatever: the bread, caesar, and hen. I can say, though, that the customer service here is really great. When my boyfriend asked where the bathroom was, one of the bussers/runners showed him to it, rather than just pointing. Our server was very friendly and was super knowledgable. Our meal was taking a really long time so I mentioned something to the server and then the manager came over shortly after. He wanted to apologize and offer us a drink on the house. It was much appreciated, and made up for the kitchen being so slow but didn't make up for the disappointing food.  Honestly, just take your money elsewhere. I am sure there are plenty of amazing restaurants in Chicago that are so much cheaper and have way better food. We went to Girl and the Goat last night and it was unbelievable and 1/3 of the price.

All of the entrees were fantastic, but what was really fantastic was the canape - the little treat from the chef prior to the seafood entrees, the introduction to the things that dreams are made of.  we were served mussels in ale - YES, beer!  OH MAN, this was a salty crunchy treat sent straight from heaven.   swordfish - this was cooked medium rare, almost to the point where I was scared to eat it, but thank goodness I did!  The piece of fish just melted in my mouth.  The chorizo paella gave it the perfect amount of spiciness and texture.   scallops - there is nothing bad i can ever say about perfectly cooked scallops.  the little popover bread that it was served with was the cherry on top. The chocolate dessert was so freakin' good.  There were so many intricate levels to it, crunchiness, sweetness, tartness, nubs ... oh nubs.

2011-10-14,5.0,"Go big or go home - 5 courses is half-assed - could be hit or miss, 10 courses will give you a clue, but if you really want to know a place, may as well go full force: 15 courses (20 tastings when you add everything + a bonus goody they comped me). Atmosphere:  Spacious, dark, relaxed, hip. Jackets + jeans + Converses. Eclectic upbeat music. Casual fine dining that is actually casual and fine.  Service:  No idea what people are upset about - staff was nice as could be, knowledgeable, attentive but not annoying, and service was impeccable. I was in a rush and asked them to crank it and they paced it just right. It slowed down a bit as it got busier, but my pants were getting tight by that point, so it was OK.

Protein and cakes are not their strengths - the stuff that comes with them are what win me over.

Awesome:  - Pumpkin Bisque (seasonal variation of their corn bisque) - fun mix-yourself dish, best soup in while. - Seared Foie - a perfect foie, and I've had a lot of this stuff. - Marcona almond/Medjool date/Lardo canape - %$&^#@.

Very good: - Choco panna cotta/white choco-coconut gelato - best of the desserts. - Wagyu/bone marrow foam/sous vide egg - Steak and eggs people, done really really well. - Sturgeon, roasted apples/turnips/Chanterelles - Buttery, earthy. - Seared scallop/clam veloute - Delicate, buttery. Good: - Deconstructed Caesar & Twinkie - The salad is pointless, but the crouton filled with mascarpone made me happy. - Swordfish paella - Fish was OK, but everything else was incredibly complex and flavorful. - Roe/dill butter - Bouche was amused - Hot Toddy - A nice seasonal transition to desserts, very tart OK: - Persimmon cake/chevre butter - Berkshire pork - a bit bland, but good plantains - Lobster risotto - a shade undercooked, nothing special,love sea beans though - King crab/celery brulee - oversalted normal crab salad - Rum sponge cake/brown butter ice cream/passionfruit - cake was dry but ice cream was tasty. WTF: Interesting flavors, not sure if I like it or not... - Guinea hen/parsnip veloute/Tea with mushroom shavings - they wanted it to taste earthy or like the woods, which it does, but do I want to eat dirt and trees? - Sponge cake/bergamot/absinthe ice cream - very complex, don't think they make sense together. - Mochi trio - honey, fig, chestnut - each savory and sweet. very interesting yet bizarre, I'm confused.

2011-10-11,2.0,"For as many ""to die for"" reviews as i've heard, I was definitely disappointed. I've eaten at three other restaurants that were recipients of the coveted Michelin Star and this one was by far lacking. The meal was in no way deserving of the price. Seems like the price was increased by 30% after the star was awarded. $75 for a tasting menu is a given for a great restaurant, but not for what I received. I payed $125 for the tasting menu at L'Atelier de Joel Rubechon at the MGM and was so much more impressed. Not only with quantity of portion but wow factor. The food at Graham Elliot just didn't have the flavors that made me think, wow, this is amazing. I'm sorry but for $125 for 5 small portions and a 1/4 glass wine tasting pairing is just not worth it at this restaurant. I booked a reservation 3 weeks in advance for 10 people for my fiance's 30th birthday party, and managed to get a waitress whose attitude seemed to exude ""I'm getting your 18% percent gratuity no matter how bad I am."" Waited 20 minutes and had to remind her about a drink order. The bill was over a thousand...service? Where? Zagats was wrong, Michelin is wrong, Good Morning America is wrong. Chicago foodie bloggers are wrong. Or maybe they were right 8 months ago. Regardless, this restaurant has fallen off its course and will quickly loose the star if it hasn't already.

I didn't come in with ""high expectations"" but I knew that Graham was awarded a Michelin Star so I did think that it would be a decent meal.  The first thing that threw me a little was the price.  I knew it would be a lot, but I was only planning to get one entree a la carte, but the rest of the table wanted the tasting menu ($75) and all of us had to get it so I was out voted. As tasting menus go, the portions are small - I understand that - but sometimes they are way too small even to get a real taste of it.  The first thing that I noticed it that everyone's portions were HORRIBLY inconsistent.  On the first appetizer, the bread had literally no butter while the fellow next to me had a huge chunk.  I had one less slice of beef for the entree... a whole slice goes a long way in a tasting menu.  One of my dishes didn't even have the garnish!  I expected a lot more quality control, but it was as if they were rushing all this stuff out.  Missing a garnish seems like a pretty big flub.   The best thing I ate all night was actually the untraditional ceasar salad with an anchovy on top.  Quite tasty.  Everything else was just filler and honestly just not that great.  I'm not really a food snob or anything, but at the price you're paying you should expect a lot more.  Honestly, I expect this place to lose their Michelin Star soon.",0.9755,0.778,0.152,0.071,0.5116666666666667

The bf reserved a table for us spontaneously on a Wednesday night, and though I was tired from teaching all day and had to wake up at 5am the next day, I was definitely glad that I took the time out to have this delicious meal.  (NOTE: be sure to take time out if you're planning on having one of the full course meals!  We had the ""tasting"" section of the menu which took about an hour/hour and a half.) The one thing that I loved more than the meal itself was the fact that the servers focused the meal on the EXPERIENCE of eating the meal.  They each explained what ingredients went into each dish and explained how to eat each course to maximize the taste and sensation of each dish.  Awesome. The taste...oh my GOD, the taste!  Each dish was as unique as I could imagine.  The watermelon consomme, which was one of my favorite palate cleansers, had the sweetness of watermelons (along with cubes of watermelon bits sitting at the bottom!) and the spiciness from the jalapeno oil.  Although the sweet/spicy pairing has been done, this is something that was truly remarkable.   My absolute...I lied.  My TWO absolute favorite dishes were the deconstructed salad and the ""sea"" dish, which was halibut.  The deconstructed salad played on the sweet/salty pairing, but also played on different texture as well.  I loved the softness of the baby anchovy, paired with the crunchiness of the baby arugula and THEN the crunchy outside layer of the homemade twinkie AND the soft, moist inside.  The halibut dish was absolutely to die for.  I never EVER order fish at a restaurant, but if I did, this is what I would hope it would taste like.  The fish was cooked to perfection--flaky, yet still moist and soft.  Paired with the sweet crunchiness of the diced green beans and almonds, along with the sauce, this was tied with the deconstructed salad in terms of taste and texture.  Funny enough, salad and fish are the last two things that I would ever order at ANY restaurant.  Graham Elliot, you have restored my faith in good fish and a good salad. There is just so much to tell about the tastes, textures and overall experience, but I'm going just going to say one thing: YOU NEED TO GO.  Make a reservation for a special someone and yourself and eat your heart out.  Though it was a bit pricey, it was definitely worth every single of my boyfriend's penny (=P). Oh, and did I mention the nicely dressed servers?!  Nice, clean jeans, crisp white shirts, topped off with blazers and an oversized ""ge"" belt buckle.  Pure awesomeness.",0.9975,0.801,0.181,0.018,0.5778977482465856

2011-09-07,4.0,"I perused a few other reviews before writing mine, and I must agree with those that made the observation that Graham Elliot is a must try, at least once.  I received a $250 gift certificate to GE, and after doing a little research and talking to friends who had dined there, I was really excited to get to experience this restaurant. Since we had a nice amount of money to spend, we decided on the tasting menu, ""Experience"", which is $125 per person. This is a 10 course menu, and considering that GE has a seasonal menu of 15 items, I figured this would be a great way for my husband and me to try most of what they offer. The ""pass out"" is a bowl of popcorn, but obviously not just any popcorn. It was topped with truffle butter, shaved parmesan, black pepper, and chives and was beyond amazing. My husband asked me if he would be in trouble if he picked up the bowl of popcorn and tipped back the last few morsels, and the answer was obviously ""yes!"" but I totally understood why he wanted to! We ordered the ""mocktail"" of the day, which was a cucumber limeade and it was sooo very tasty.  Out of 10 courses, there were several that stood out. The 'deconstructed caesar salad' was really good, served on top of a brioche twinkie. It was also a really great introduction to the coming courses, each with unexpected mixture of flavors, most that were pleasing, and a few that were not my cup of tea. The next course was 'corn bisque'. They brought a bowl to our table that had a few odds and ends in it and a smallish marshmallow. The server then poured a bisque into the bowl and told us to stir until the marshmallow melted. This course was a delight to my sense of taste, smell, and sight. I wish I could have had a lot more of this dish! A few courses later was the ""alaskan halibut'. If I could go back in time, I would have ordered this and the corn bisque from the regular menu instead of the tasting menu. So unbelievably good, every bite was delight followed by delight. They served it with several dots of sauce, and trying a bite with a new sauce brought out something new each time. It's too bad that it was only a total of about 4 very small bites. Maybe only two bites for the hubby! The 'bison loin' was another pleasing course. Paired with baked beans and pepper salsa, it was a big kick of flavor, especially compared to a few of the previous courses. So, again, out of the 10 courses, 4 were standouts for me.  At about course number 4, my husband said ""You know, this meal is actually going to be 11 courses."" I said ""What?"" He said, ""Course 11 is when we stop and grab a burger on the way back to the hotel.""  He was already pretty certain that he was not going to be satiated by 6 more courses.  Service and atmosphere were great. Our server was fun, the casual hipster atmosphere definitely took what could have been a stuffy experience and made it laid back. The music though was very loud, making conversation at our intimate table for two a challenge. It wasn't long before we were talking to the tables around us, it was just too easy to eavesdrop on other conversations since you had to speak loudly to be heard. This also made it difficult to understand the service staff when they were giving details about each dish. Speaking of which, the table next to us also ordered the ""Experience"" tasting menu. We overheard them saying about mid-way through that they were going to need to stop and grab a burrito on the way home. So clearly, we weren't the only ones who felt that the portion sizes were too small to satisfy.  When we received our bill, it was just over $300. Once the tip was added, it amounted to a very expensive meal, at least for my budget! Thankfully, we had our gift certificate, but I couldn't help but thinking about how I would feel if I had to pay for the entire bill. Hungry and broke. Would I go back to Graham Elliot? Only if someone else was paying for it. I am glad that I was able to try it once, because it truly was an 'experience'! Graham Elliot deserves all of the accolades he has received, he's a culinary genius. I would definitely recommend GE, but with caution...",0.9987,0.816,0.153,0.03,0.47338812298812305
2011-09-06,3.0,"Atmosphere: Casual and hip. Good space between tables. I was a bit underwhelmed with the popcorn. Stale. It was seasoned beautifully but it had gone stale. Disappointing.  Decided on the 10 course Experience. Definite highs and the occasional low. Almost every course was excellent. The corn bisque was the most surprising. On paper, it sorta made me cringe. It was probably one of my favorite courses. The wagyu tartare and sweetbread schnitzel were definite highlights of the night as well. The dish i found most disappointing was the jidori chicken. Undercooked in the center. It was a tough, translucent glob. I did take a small cut off the a side that was cooked through. Maybe i was already turned off, i just didnt like it.  Service: Eh. Our waitperson seemed to rely heavily on the servers and bussers. I asked a busser if we could order more drinks. He said ""yes"" and nothing happened. I dont think he spoke much english. After 30mins, i asked one of our plate servers if we could order more drinks. She went and found our MIA waitperson. After that, she was a lot more attentive. I didnt point out my undercooked chicken just because a 10 course tasting is about 3hrs and our server was just not there for me to point it out.  Cocktails were inconsistent as well.

We arrived at 8:15 and he gave us quite a bit of attitude, but sat us. My boyfriend made the reservation as a birthday treat, and must have mentioned it when the reservation was made.

My wife made reservations, but there must have been some sort of glitch with Open Table because when we got there they had no clue who we were, but the staff was amazing about it. We stood at the bar while the hosts went to work trying to find a table for us. Bar tender heard our plight, and gave a couple glasses of champagne. We eventually got seats at the bar and the host told us it would be 45 minutes. 20 minutes later he said it would be 45 minutes.....  We asked if 45 minutes really meant 90 and he said maybe. So we decided to eat at the bar. We ordered some apps, but they brought some extra ones to try and make our experience the best it could be. Food was excellent. Ordering a la carte is the way to go after you've done the experience or repertoire once.  We went back a couple weeks ago and it was just as good. The same server who asked about the flavors was there. This time she only asked about the flavors once. We still were given a sabre of a meat knife, but it makes much more sense proportionally speaking with an a la carte portion as opposed to the tasting menu portion. The drinks as always were amazing. We ordered the Wagyu tartare and the Deconstructed Cesar. Both were excellent. I had the Jidori Chicken which is a playful interpretation of southern fried chicken. Delightful!

2011-08-17,5.0,"Given the long nature of our dinner (15 courses plus amuse bouche and intermezzo spread over 4 hours), I'll share the highlights (good and bad) and spare you the uninteresting.  I labored over whether this was a 4 star or 5 star experience, but settled on 5 because if you walk in knowing that you're going to pay a lot ($459 in my case for 2 people), then you can just focus on the chef's food; in this case, although not every dish was great, I could taste Graham Elliot's personality (even in the not so great dishes).  That's not something you can say about most restaurants, and in this respect, I think he succeeds.   We ordered the REPERTOIRE (the ENTIRE menu).  It's a lot of food, despite the small portions each dish comes in.  I was food fatigued at the end.   FAVORITES: 1. wagyu tartare (asparagus salad + pommes frites + roasted porcini + bearnaise yolk) Just after being confused by the Tomato Panzanella, the wagyu tartare came out and wowed.  Composed elegantly and certainly not confusing to eat.  The bearnaise yolk was perfect and added a certain refinement to the dish.  The flavors married together perfectly to create something new, and I can honestly say the wagyu was necessary in the dish (sometimes it's just an expensive ingredient tossed onto the menu to connote high quality).   2. corn bisque (spiny lobster + toasted coquito + vanilla marshmallow + micro chervil) This dish is served without the bisque at first and they come by to pour the bisque in.  This was wildly successful-- if each ingredient were a color, imagine closing your eyes and seeing a different color pop into your head every couple seconds, and then have all of them come rushing into your mouth at the same time in a blend.  Coconut shined through especially bright, and the bisque... oolala good. 3. ricotta and beets (this was a special on the house) Very, very small portion.  Beets perfect and how did he get the ricotta to be SO EXTRAORDINARILY fluffy? 4. local whitefish (smoke mussel + potato confit + artichoke relish + lemon sabayon) The fish was slightly crispy on the outside, perfectly cooked on the inside.  The mussels were so tender, I wasn't even sure they were mussels!!  And the potato confit was poached in duck fat, which made them absolutely decadent.  And sabayon that's properly whipped and not in the least bit runny -- A+. 5. king salmon (blis roe + garlic scape + shaved fennel + dill crema) Easily the winner of the night.  The salmon is sous vide, and it literally melts in your mouth.  I've had awesome salmon belly that basically melts in your mouth, but this took things to a whole other level.  (Discarding all dirty images from your mind for a second), this was a party in your mouth.   MISSES: 1. tomato panzanella (baby arugula + grilled cioppolinni + ciabatta vinaigrette, caper powder) Served deconstructed.  It was a classic Graham Elliot concoction right off the bat.  However, I hate food that looks pretty but confuses the eater.  Was I supposed to eat each component separately?  Was I supposed to eat them together?  Which components together?  Each item was great, but I'll never know what they were supposed to taste like together.  Also, the caper powder was literally smeared onto the plate with a finger (the smear was so small I almost missed it).  It actually looked kind of like the plate was dirty.  Fail. 2. deconstructed caesar (gem lettuce + brioche twinkie + white anchovy + parmesan fluff) Aside from a successful sauce with the familiar Caesar flavors but much more softened and refined, this fell on its face.  The brioche twinkie didn't deliver in spite of its inspiring name, and the rest was just bland.  The dainty white anchovy was delicious on its own, but didn't help the dish.  Although it's touted as a Graham Elliot favorite, I can't see why that's the case, except perhaps it's easily the item on the menu with the highest mark-up. 3. jidori chicken (dirty rice + country pate + fried okra + gizzard jus) The skin on the chicken was crispy and nice, but the chicken itself dry.  The dirty rice was crispy, but didn't add a needed texture and once you dug your fork into the dish, the rice scattered everywhere. 4. the desserts I thought they were all misses (or at the very least, unspectacular; downfall of all the Top Chefs, no?).  The basil ice cream actually tasted like basil, which was cool... but their strawberries tasted like canned ones.   All in all, a meal I'll never forget.  Well done Graham Elliot.",0.9989,0.759,0.181,0.06,0.6191182165232799

He suggested skipping the Prix Fixe menu (he had the Tasting) and just ordering the best dishes. He felt the Tasting wasn't worth the $75. So our party of 4 agreed. Our server was very friendly and liked to use the word ""sexy"". When  I asked for a nonalcoholic drink, he said, I'll bring you something sexy...you'll love it. He brought me something that tasted like a mojito-I'll call it a faux-jito, which I did enjoy :) We started munching away on our truffled Parmesan popcorn. My friend, who hates onions of all kinds, made a face when he saw it was covered with scallions. The waiter saw right away and brought a non-scallioned one out, just for him. My friend was very happy. They gave us an amuse bouche of watermelon gazpacho. It was weird.  We ordered the foie gras lollipops, which isn't on the menu but my hubby said we should try it. It was very fun to eat, with the pop crackles, sweet and salty taste. It wasn't very ""foie gras-y"", more on the very heavy creamy-side with just a taste of foie gras. We all got the Caesar Salad, which we all liked. I noticed that the tasting portion def had a smaller crouton/twinkie and just one bit of lettuce than the a la carte order. Next my friends split the wagyu tartare and I had a shrimp appetizer. They liked the tartare. The shrimp was a more fancy version of a sweet and sour fried shrimp. Tasty but nothing ""new."" It was $15 for just 2 pieces so quite small portions. Next we had our entrees. A friend and I ordered the pork belly, the other 2 had the halibut. I was excited, until I moved the fried egg and uncovered 4 small pieces of pork belly. Really, so small? The pork was flavored with chorizo and some pork belly foam? the puffed hominy was yummy, and reminded me of tamales. So overall a ""latin"" inspired dish. My friend's halibut was ok but I thought it was a bit dry. They liked it though. Finally, we ended with the flourless cake, split by the four of us. It was ok, nothing special. I didn't like that ice cream that came with it. Reminded me of cough syrup. Overall, we paid around $95 including drinks and tip pp. Not bad, and I think a better value than the tasting.

The tempura fried shrimp in a squash blossom is the best of southern meets Japan and whet the appetite even more that the amuse (a watermelon shooter). For entrees, the chicken with dirty rice is  a whimsical play on a rilette and a deconstructed chicken jambalaya. The fried okra was crunchy and without any of the normal slime; something not easy to do.  The only complaint is that, due to puffing the rice, it was a little dry and could have used another sauce. To a southerner, dirty rice is a long time and cherished comfort food, usually learned at the feet of a grandmother and to play with and update it take some big brass ones but it did not disappoint. I was glad, however, that the bartender warned me about the rice texture since it wasn't mentioned on the menu so I knew what to expect. The pork belly with chorizio broth and fried egg is off the hook. After the description do I really need to say anything more about this  dish??   The peach sazarac is now what I measure all other deserts by.

(this is free if you have a dietary restriction) The ceaser was delicious, bisque awesome(I love the little marshmallow), Jidori chicken absolutely perfect, we added the Carolina shrimp, bison was good and ended with the flour less chocolate cake and french press coffee.   Overall with drinks our bill was around $115 per person which I thought was more than reasonable, the food was delicious and we were quite full afterward despite the small portions that come with fine dining.",0.9956,0.749,0.213,0.038,0.6196969696969697
2011-07-08,4.0,"Had the 5 course tasting menu.  They just started this summer menu this week.   - As usual, there's the deconstructed caesar salad and I loved the Spanish anchovy that comes with it.  Beautiful presentation.   - Creamy corn bisque with lobster bits plus a vanilla marshmallow.  Loved how they poured my soup using a beaker.  That was the highlight of our meal.   - Halibut served with very fresh, finely chopped haricort vert with a leek brandade.  The halibut is good but I would have preferred it to be more tender.   - Bison loin served with pea sauce, texas onion ring and a spicy sauce; it was my least favorite course as the bison was a bit tough.  It just didn't feel special or I call it a typical Bobby Flay dish.     - Then we each had their foie gras mousse lollipop sprinkled with rock salt and strawberry (or watermelon??) pop rock.  That was very delicious and well worth $5 each. - Flourless chocolate cake topped with root beer gelatin, cherries cooked in port,, rootbeer ice cream and some port sauce.  I don't like root beer but that was amazing when combined together.  Chef uses sassafras(?) which is the leaves that gives root beer taste to make this dish.

2011-07-06,3.0,"A friend of mine took one look at their website and came away with something like ""Bistronomic?  Casual Elegant? What does that even mean?"" Ourselves, we were in Chicago for a week of eating, and growing increasingly suspicious of one of our reservations where apparently the star chef had, unbeknownst to us, left in a huff months earlier.  We needed a replacement on short notice, and we recalled fondly meeting Graham Elliot at a food event on the west coast, where his foie gras lollipops rolled in pop rocks were the hit of the evening. This being one of the later days of that week, we rolled into the restaurant admittedly somewhat the worse for wear, but game to give a fifteen course tasting a try.  At 10pm.  This was perhaps a miscalculation.  They were quite happy to oblige.  I mean, certainly we were not going to insist on any such thing at such a late hour. It would seem to me that one of the pitfalls of what they are trying to do is related to expectations.  You take away the stuffy surroundings, the jackets, the white tablecloths and the hushed aura of awe that surrounds fine dining, and suddenly the expectations change.  You don't expect to wait quite so long between courses.  You are perhaps less forgiving of a quality over quantity approach. Meanwhile, if you advertise a new type of fine dining, if you advertise challenging the status quo, if you advertise food as art in Chicago of all places, you had better stand ready to deliver.  And you had better offer something in exchange for a rather hefty price given the lack of white tablecloths, elaborate floral displays, tuxedoed servers and other expensive things like floorspace. Admitting that we were perhaps a little tired out from a week of eating, that I've had to refer to photographs to remember some of the dishes, and that 10pm is not exactly the right time to start a tasting menu of this magnitude, I have to say that I did not leave impressed.  I did leave full - fifteen small bites will do that to a person - but I did not leave charmed or impressed. I am not going to run down the entire menu piece by piece.  Partly because that would be pretty boring.  Which is sad.  Though relatively careful in execution, the platings were boring - not artful - and invariably on the exact same plate all through the meal.  Little did it seem to matter whether we were having sablefish or lamb, a chunk of protein in a corner of the plate was surrounded by accompaniments which were neither particularly clear in taste nor particularly adventurous in their pairing.  Maybe I was just tired, but I should not have to think *too* hard about whether a picture I took was of the fish or the foie.  I certainly should not have to think too hard about it when I am actually eating the dish.  And I have *never* had so much trouble remembering the details of a particular dish given a picture I took ... the platings and flavors were all way too similar. We admit we came late, tired and with high hopes.  We left even later, full, still tired, and somewhat disappointed.",0.1563,0.795,0.108,0.097,0.5322843986079281

Our server made it seem like if we didn't upgrade to the ""experience"" menu then we were missing out and would be disappointed.... kind of made me feel like I was buying a car. We agreed to add on the octopus to the tasting menu. For the rest of the meal she was nice and attentive though.  I won't go over each dish but I will say that the amuse bouches were the better parts of the whole thing. The caviar amuse with garden sorrel and panna cotta was very tasty. I also enjoyed the caesar deconstruction with the brioche twinkie.  When the onion soup came out I was excited. There was whipped marrow in the bowl with gruyere and then a beaker of broth to the side for us to pour into the ingredients - great presentation but unfortunately the flavor just wasn't there. The broth was very bland and the ingredients were not potent enough to make up for it. I didn't have the nerve to ask for a salt shaker but that's what I was thinking as I struggled through it. Neither of us ended up finishing.  Skate was decent, chicken was pretty good, and the chocolate ganache dessert was enjoyable. I wil have to say I've had much more flavorful/satisfying, relatively bigger portioned, small plate multi-course experiences at a more reasonable price. I just felt like I would have been happier purchasing a small TV for my kitchen which I could have easily covered with the amount I paid when the check came.

2011-06-26,5.0,"We came to Graham Elliot with high expectations and were not disappointed.   Environment: The look of the place is very elegant, yet not pretentious at all.  The music is also great and adds to the hip ambiance.  The tables are spaced out a few feet from each other, so this creates the perception of a more private dining experience.   Cuisine: We had the 5-course tasting menu.  For $5, they would substitute a dish with anything you would want to try a la carte from the same category.  The food is designed to surprise your palette, with descriptions of the dishes giving only a vague idea of what is to come.  I found the taste very intense at every bite. The tasting menu has smaller portion sizes for each course than the corresponding a la carte dish, but we felt we got the right sampling of every dish. While we were browsing the menu, they brought us truffle oil and Parmesan ""fluff"" popcorn, which is the best I have ever had.  We had a couple cocktails and I would recommend the one with rum and ginger.  We also got an amuse of chive panna cotta and caviar, which was a nice touch. The first course was a deconstructed Caesar salad.  The lettuce looked like it was vaccum-packed into a rectangular shape and served on a top of a cream-infused fried brioche with an anchovy.  On balance, the taste basically adds up to a classic Caesar, which is the point, so I would say it was a well-executed dish. The second course was an onion soup with chive panna cotta and some picked onions.  Interesting and refreshing spring soup, but I would recommend they serve it a little warmer and with some sort of crouton for texture.  My wife substituted her onion soup for the foie gras and that was just magical!  The combination of strawberry and rhubarb with the foie worked perfect.  There were also some ""crunchy bits"" (not sure what) that worked perfect with the rest of the dish. The third course came after a canape of pickled strawberries.  We went for the default fish course, skate confit.  The skate was made into a roll and served on a ""salad"" of ham and fava beans with mustard.  There was also another sauce in the ""salad"" that to me was the best feature of the dish, but I cannot make out what it was. This was my favorite dish of the evening and the one I wish was a bigger portion. The fourth courses we chose were the veal and the lamb.  The veal was served on a (perfectly executed) schnitzel of sweetbreads.  The asparus it came with was very tender (and tiny).  The lamb was served with peas, morel mushrooms and eucalyptus froth.  I found the peas a bit bland, but the lamb was perfectly cooked. The fifth course we had was the chocolate, which came after an intemezzo of cherry soda.  There was a scoop of raspberry chocolate icecream, and a scoop of milk chocolate sauce served on top of a chocolate ganache.  The salt and ancho chili were a great touch. Service: Our server was very low-key, gave us space, and was informed about the dishes.  Silverware changed for every dish as it should be, and busing was synchronized.  We did not feel rushed or pushed to order anything we were not inclined to order. Overall, I would say this is the perfect restaurant for foodies on a special occasion.  It captures what I think the contemporary Chicago dining experience should be: understated elegance, innovation, and impeccable quality.  We are definitely going back!",0.9987,0.829,0.169,0.002,0.5553271784904439

Our server had a HUGE attitude the entire night, he barely smiled and when he did, you could tell it was not sincere.

I told him I didn't care and that I needed another chicken cooked at 165. If you are going to serve poultry less than well done, you NEED to inform your guest of the way chef prepares it, that way the guest can make an educated decision of whether or not they feel comfortable eating almost raw poultry (aside from duck).  This place has such good ratings and I would agree that although the food is tasty, it's WAY over priced with the smallest portions and if I had a different server, I may not have minded the price or portion.

Salmon was cooked to perfection, chicken was paired with a buttery kale or whatever green veggie that was (the important thing is that my husband actually ATE it!!!), foie gras danced on my tongue and all the desserts were a fairy tale delight.  It would take forever for me to describe all 20 courses.  So all I can say is that if you love trying new dishes then this is the place for you.   If you want steak and potatoes, or pasta and salad or are looking to stuff your mouth with pizza, do NOT come here.  Cause you're not gonna find it.",0.9821,0.84,0.16,0.0,0.5967474747474749

The casualness of the restaurant was a bit of a surprise, but really helped to make the experience feel comfortable and unpretentious.  Our server, Mitch, was personable, knowledgeable and attentive, as was the sommelier, Rob. I loved that they checked on us frequently and went above and beyond to make sure we had a great experience. Bonus, I don't think I've ever had wine pairings that went better with each course, Bravo! The tasting menus are amazing and I'm so glad we did that rather than ordering ala carte... we even ordered extra dishes before we couldn't bear to not try the salmon.

2011-05-30,1.0,"Graham Elliot was one of the biggest dining disappointments of my life.  In short, the menu is full of unsuccessful recipes - flavors that don't excite the taste buds and ingredient combinations that emphasize irony and surprise at the expense of pleasure - all at a mediocre quality and at prices that are far too great for what the diner gets in return.  Almost every aspect of the restaurant is amateurish. My date and I each had the 10 course ""experience"" tasting menu.  Of the ten courses, only one was delicious - the final one, a chocolate dessert.  The rest ranged from mediocre to just plain bad.  I should say that I love this genre of food, lest you think I am not a tasting menu type of guy.  A similar tasting menu at Alinea was one of the best dinners I've ever had.  This restaurant is trying to be another Alinea, including matching Alinea's high prices, but the expertise and exquisiteness of the food at Alinea is totally absent here.  While you'll find a dollop of foam here and there, the more interesting techniques of molecular gastronomy were non-existent in the items we received.  The quality of the ingredients was much lower than similar restaurants, like Alinea, and the chefs' skills and techniques pale in comparison.     In fact, one course included a small piece of foie gras, from which the vein had not been removed.  Removing the unpleasantly flavored and textured vein from foie gras is a very elementary chef's technique.  I've never encountered one in a restaurant before.  The other most incompetent kitchen gaffe was that all courses lacked proper seasoning.  The absence of a bit of salt from the lamb, especially, left the meat's flavor dull and lifeless. Other courses tasted dull and uninteresting as well.  Ingredient combinations that sounded interesting simply didn't work.  Most bites tended toward bitter or overly herby.  Temperature of food was a problem, as was pacing between courses.  We sat at our table for almost four hours.  At one point, the kitchen had made a mistake and a course was skipped.  To make amends, our waiter brought us extra glasses of a wine pairing, which was nice, but before I could stop him, a distracted busboy snatched away my half-full glass, wasting the remainder of the good wine and souring the experience further.  I wanted to mention this to our waiter, but he didn't appear at our table at all between the sixth and 10th courses, and only reappeared to deliver the check after disappearing for the final hour and fifteen minutes of our stay. With our disappointment in the quality of the food, the $400 bill (including a $52 bottle of wine and our tip) was difficult to justify.  I sincerely hope that this review doesn't fall on deaf ears and that improvements are made.  Failing that, I at least hope that I prevent a few other people from wasting their money.",-0.817,0.795,0.096,0.11,0.5429925303454716

Maybe this place used to be the cat's meow, but it was a far cry from it on this occasion.  The drinks were decent, but nothing you can't get at another upscale bar in the neighborhood.  If you go, I would encourage getting the dishes (versus the courses menu), but even that was wildly overpriced for what you get.   I must say I walked in and thought ""wow, I can't believe it's more busy on a Saturday night at 8pm"", and I left saying, ""no wonder this place isn't busy"".  If you end up footing the bill, consider yourself warned.",-0.0843,0.896,0.054,0.049,0.49380952380952386

Wasn't sure what to expect going in, and found that my fear of items being too gimicky was totally unfounded. The three dishes I was particularly nervous about, were the truffled popcorn, which was addictive and fantastic, the foielipop, which I could have done without, and the twinky ceasar, which was really yummy. The rest of the dishes on the 10 course each had a truly delicious component in them, but were sometimes surrounded by too many superfluous additions. Some worked, but many lacked a coherence between each of the ten layers (ok, I'm exaggerating) in the dish. But as I said, when it worked it worked. The desserts were outstanding. You can tell the Chef has a sweet tooth throughout his savory fare, and he really employs this passion perfectly in the desserts! The service was really great from the get go, starting with a cute bartender that made exceptional cocktails.

We dined fairly late on a recent Saturday night and were thoroughly impressed by the atmosphere, the service, and--most importantly--the food. We started with cocktails at the bar because our table was just a couple of minutes slow, for which we also got a compliments-of-the-kitchen amuse, so no complaints about that, and then moved on to a series of a la carte dishes. Everything we had from the new spring menu was faultlessly well prepared and delicious, with a great blend of flavors and nicely contrasting textures. Particularly memorable were the crab starter and the thyme dessert, although really every dish was one I would not hesitate to order again. Service was attentive without being annoying, and we, being mild misanthropes, really enjoyed sitting several feet rather than inches from the closest table. My husband, who once declared that he was into fine dining but not into tucking his shirt in, was particularly pleased with the overall lack of pretension.

We were here on a Saturday night when I was in town, and he made reservations about two weeks in advance, since he knew I am a top chef junkie and this place was amazing.  The restaurant was buzzing with a lot of the tables filled, bar busy, a beautiful crowd, and somewhat awkward first date at the table next to us. I was a little worried, because I have reduced my red meat intake and he is a pescaterean, so this place did not seem like it would be a good match for us.  However, was I wrong!  The updated Spring menu had many options for us, and we were pleased with everything we had.  We did the a la carte menu, because the tasting menu just seemed like a lot going on... and lasted like 3.5 hrs! That's a long time to eat. - Truffle Popcorn:  Yep, everyone talks about.  No bread bowl here, but popcorn + cheese + truffles. What's not to like!? Delish! - Amuse-Bouche:  The amuse bouche was a minty-chive custard of sorts that was springy and fresh.  It set a perfect tone for the rest of the meal and definitely was light.  And I guess they knew we liked it so much, because they accidentally brought a second amuse-bouche for us which we happily enjoyed too! - ""Crab Cake"" :  This is a delectable soft shell crab served split in half that was tasty and light.  It had a beautiful cucumber gelatin type cubes that was complimented well with a tangy slaw.  Yum!  I had a couple bites, and since soft shell crab sent me to the emergency room one time, I refrained from wanting to eat more of it. - Foie Grois: First, foie grois on it's own.. it's delectable to begin with.  The time when Chicago couldn't serve it.. well that was a sad time.. and GE has done it right.  This was spectacular and creamy, but there was a beautiful sear on it.  It was served with fresh strawberries and this fantastic crumble and rhubarb thing that was tangy, and taken in all together. YUM YUM YUM! I wanted to lick my plate.. but you know.. we're in public.  By far.. my most favorite thing! - Grilled Mackerel:  This beautiful piece of fish was beautiful.  Served with an amazing fennell ratatouille and this saffron essence thing happening.  It was a clean, and fresh dish. - Alaskan Sable: How pretty can it be! This dish was gorgeous dish.  Served with buckwheat gnocci that I thought may be heavy, was a nice light starch and these perfectly cute mushrooms that would make any smurf happy.  Topped with a gorgeous dashi foam for that slight asian kinda influence.  A great plate of food. - Lavender Brulee:  Any form of brulee, I am a sucker for.  But this was a beautiful ending to our meal.  It was spring spring spring on this menu with a lovely blackberry reduction spotted on the plate. Exquisite. Graham Elliot lived up to the name and the hype.  It was fantastic and WOW what a pretty and strong dirty martini they serve up!

The BF and I did the Tasting Menu, so we tried the Deconstructed Caesar, the Chicken Noodle Soup, Crispy Black Bass, Wagyu Flat Iron and Chocolate Gateau.

So first off, the decor, furniture and general vibe of the restaurant suck. It's cheaply done, naked in appearance, and not in a cool modern way. The restaurant almost looks like a middle-aged bachelor pad who has a folding table in the corner and his tv on the floor, just not at all what you would expect for the price you're paying for your meal.  Which brings me to the prices, they are NUTS, totally bonkers off your head crazy. Let me re-iterate that I'm ok paying a lot of money for dinners that are worth it - Alinea was amazing, Graham Elliot is a wannabe that doesn't even come close.   Here's the difference. Alinea is DELCIOUS, it taste good.  FYI, just because you put foam on something, and made it look pretty, you can't just stop there....try making the food TASTE like SOMETHING and then we can talk.  Instead, my conversation with Graham Elliot was very one sided...I kept asking for food that tasted good, and he kept bringing me out dollops of purees and foams on un-seasoned, tasteless mini-portions of meat and seafood. And the whole time, the restaurant tries to come off with this edgy/alterna music vibe (the menu, the interior music, the wine list, it's all themed this way, and the servers and staff all are wearing skinny pants to hammer this home), but really it's the most pretentious place I've ever been to. The servers are cold and stiff. I couldnt' get a smile outta them, which was the only thing I could do to make light of the otherwise dismal meal. Out of the appetizers, my group tried the fluke tartare, hog ear, empanadas, ceasar salad, and chicken noodle.  Out of those, the fluke tartare, hog ear and ceasar salad were good-ish. The chicken noodle was warm gravy with completely tasteless chicken and apparently celery FIVE earth-shattering ways...yet I still couldn't find 1 way that tasted good in this soup. The gravy, err I mean ""veloute,"" was more lawrys-inspired than french fare. Now to the entrees. We ordered the Faux Lobster (Monkfish), Wagyu Beef, Venison, and Black Bass.  The faux lobster was gross. I can't think of a better, food-critic-y way of saying it. The monkfish had zero seasoning or sauce to speak of. It had lobster-roe cream goo all over it. The texture of the monkfish was as if it had been boiled for an hour...yes it kind of had the texture of lobster, but it had no flavor to speak of, an insult to the lobster if I ever saw one. After attempting to eat it, I gave up and asked to switch for the Cod.  Thank god I did because the Cod was great!  The other entrees, black bass, beef, and venison were ok, but completely devoid of flavor and dry, dry, dry. The smoked leeks on the black bass were raw, and unedible. The beef had no sauce or jus to speak of, and was tough and unsesasoned. Overall, the dishes at Graham Elliot lacked any semblance of brightness or crisp-ness in flavor (stand outs from this were the fluke tartare and cod). Everything was muddled by some foreign dot of goo on the plate.  Perhaps this review makes me sound un-refined to some of you. Look, I own skinny pants too ok!? Trust me, it doesn't matter how refined you make a plate look, if it doesn't taste good, you might as well throw in your napkin and call it a night.",0.9475,0.858,0.086,0.056,0.5581857956857957
2011-03-28,5.0,"One of my new favorite restaurants!  We went here on a Friday night for my husbands birthday...and both loved it!  The service was great, very professional.  I made a note that it was my husbands birthday when I made the reservation, so they added some nice extra touches which I greatly appreciated.  I also requested to sit in the back room (I think it's called the library) which they accomodated, and I would definately reccommend...you still feel like you are in the main restauarant, but tucked away a little so it's more private.  The only frustration of the evening was the loud and obnoxious foursome next to us, who kept getting up to smoke throughout their dinner, so would come back smelling like an ashtray as we were eating, but I guess the restaurant can't do anything to prevent that. We did the 5 course tasting, which was the perfect amount of food, and each had one mixed drink and a glass of wine (on the expensive side, or we probably would have had more...since the meal lasted a couple hours).  The food was expensive, but worth it since every bite was so, so, soooo good.   Very creative and fun menu.

2011-03-23,5.0,"This is Chicago dining in full force. What do I mean by that? I mean an urban, design-oriented space, well-executed dishes and impeccable service. In Chicago sometimes the food is a bit too ""messed with"" for my palate, but generally creative, and served in very ""design-y"" spaces with excellent table service. Fluke tartare - flavorful fresh fish, transparent, well married flavors. Excellent. ""Game birds"" - squab breast w quail egg - don't remember the preparation very well, but I remember thinking ""how clever"" and ""how delicious"" in quick succession Deconstructed ceasar - tight bundles of romaine hearts in three neat stacks, one atop a ""brioche twinkie"" and all of them topped w a tiny little anchovy fillet. More clever than delicious, but still good, and will definitely elicit a chuckle Chicken noodle - was almost over a cold, so figured this would be perfect. It was. Chicken stock reduced till thick poured over small packets of flavor, such as a carrot ""marshmallow."" Delicious and clever. Sweetbread empanada - love me some empanadas, and these were no exception. Possibly the best dish of the night -- certainly the most beautiful. Plate once again peppered with little flavor packets that kept you guessing but never unhappy. Delightful. Hog cheek - the only dish that may have been a bit overdone. Flavors seemed too concentrated, too salty, and not in balance. The wine list showed immense creativity and broad knowledge. One of the most interesting lists I've read in a very long time. The beer selection is also deep and fascinating. Some dishes were paired with beer rather than wine (appropriately), which showed ingenuity and expertise. The one cocktail I had wasn't great, though the liquor list seemed well chosen. Service was unobtrusive and prompt. I could find no fault. Despite a few missteps, my overall experience was exceptional and memorable. I would recommend this place enthusiastically.",0.9987,0.65,0.301,0.049,0.6498150510204083
2011-03-21,5.0,"Thoroughly impressed with Graham Elliot--an extremely high level of service mixed with delicious and incredibly innovative food in a casual, but still carefully maintained, environment. Dinner started with a small, complimentary bowl of seasoned popcorn with truffle oil.  I have had a similar appetizer at Crop Bistro in Cleveland, but instead with a balsamic vinaigrette.  The Graham Elliot version nailed the seasonings perfectly.  It is probably a good thing you only get a small bowl, as it would be too easy to fill yourself up snacking on this popcorn. We decided on the five-course tasting menu with two courses we particularly wanted added on.  The first of these add-ons was the ""Foie-lipop,"" a lollipop of foie gras with its edges covered in a thin layer of Pop Rocks.  The smooth taste and texture of the foie gras combined with the rough texture of the Pop Rocks, not to mention the coating's contribution of sound and touch (the popping in your mouth) make this an extraordinary dish.  Throw in the fact that it was only $5 each, and I should have bought a couple for the road. The next act came in the form of the Deconstructed Caesar Salad starring an amazing ""Twinkie"" crouton--a long crouton with a firm exterior filled with a Caesar salad dressing-like mix.  The amazing crouton was accompanied with a small wedge of lettuce topped with an anchovy to complete the scene. Soup followed salad in the form of Chicken Noodle Soup.  The soup tasted fine, with the carrot marshmallow adding an appropriate amount of sweetness, taste, and body to the soup (you stir the marshmallow into the soup until it dissolves).  I was distracted, however, with the choice of bowl for the dish.  While I understand a wide bowl is needed to lay out the components of the soup (including a small slice of chicken with its edges wrapped with a thin layer of pasta) before the base is poured into the bowl, this makes the soup slightly annoying to eat.  This is not to say its a very difficult dish to eat, but certainly the choice of dishware should be at least neutral to, if not enhance, and certainly not detract, from the food being consumed. The second addition of the night came in the form of the Hog Cheek--one of the a la carte items split into three (the number of guests at the table) and integrated into the tasting.  The accommodation to add the dish was a part of the superb service we had (more on that to follow).  Unfortunately, I was not that impressed with the taste of the dish--it failed, in my opinion, to accentuate the tenderness and, frankly, fattiness of the hog cheek (which is why folks go for the cheek meat in the first place).  I would recommend passing on the accompanying pork rind. Back to the script with the Black Bass with Leek variations.  The fish was cooked just right, and the smoked leek topped with thin fried leek strips was pretty good.  I was not ""blown away"" by this dish as much as I was with many others, but it was certainly passable. Wagyu Beef with separate sauces of trumpet mushrooms and arugula puree.  Outstanding.  The (relatively lean) cuts of Wagyu beef were perfectly cooked, and I loved the trumpet mushroom sauce.  This was a great end to the main portion of the meal. Dessert was an assortment of chocolate items, including a tasty chocolate ribbon and a very tasty chocolate crisp.  I really appreciated the perfect port pairing with the course. A word on the service: Excellent.  And I do not mean just in terms of ""casual"" or (rather) ""trendy casual"" dining.  The service was in the same class as service at the highest levels of formal fine dining establishments.  Water service was almost too attentive--my glass was barely ever less than 80% full.  Plates were placed and removed from each setting fairly simultaneously.  When I accidentally put a droplet of sauce on my shirt, the waiter, who must have seen me addressing the stain with my napkin (or else sensed a disturbance in the force), brought a small glass of soda water and clean napkin to the table without even the slightest prompting.  Upon seeing the three of us looking confusingly at the check, another server apparently checked the bill on the computer, saw that it had charged us for the wrong bottle of wine, came over, and addressed the matter--again, before any of us had even raised the issue.  And, finally, the offered tour of the kitchen (which we accepted) was insightful and much appreciated. Criticisms?  This is probably splitting hairs, but I thought the pacing of the dishes through the courses could have been improved.  While a short respite--to enjoy wine or contemplate on the superb dish just consumed--is desirable, I felt we were waiting a little too long in between courses.  Taking the tour of the kitchen, I became more attuned to the constraints on pacing, but I cannot fully let the restaurant off the hook for this relatively minor offense.",0.9989,0.8,0.157,0.043,0.5965034364261167
2011-03-21,2.0,"To start, we had to reschedule our reservation because one of the couples in our party was in a fender bender on their way into the city.  I was informed that due to their policy there would be a $200 charge for the cancellation. Excuse me?  I understand if you were a no-show but we gave them several hours notice.  Not only that,  the hostess tells me she's been turning people away all night. I then queried, can't you give our table to the millions you've been turning away? She didn't get it.  I then spoke with the Director and explained the situation and that we would reschedule in a few weeks.  Although, it may be their ""policy""  it's not a good one to make a first impression for a restaurant charging exorbitant prices during a recession. Moving on to the the meal.  Let's just say the 2nd course had more personality than the server for our table.  She barely engaged in any conversation with our table of 4 and tried to take our plates before we were even finished...SEVERAL TIMES!  When you are paying that kind of money and the portions are small, they should give you ample time to savor every last bite and then ask if you are finished.  I guess when you have a 9:15PM reso they just want to get you out of there(we didn't even order the tasting).  For all the hype and $500 later, we were sorely disappointed.  The food itself was mediocre at best.  I would like to be served the meal that earned them a Michelin star, because it wasn't the one we ate!

2011-03-15,2.0,"I hate to be a hater but this place isn't worth all the hype (or the heap of money they charge for the food) - Hubs and I decided to try GE on our way home from an after charity event on a Friday. It was 5:45pm so we didn't think stopping in without a resie would be an issue. The place was virtually empty, expected. When we asked for a table, the hostess said she would need a minute to check and that we were welcome to have a drink at the bar while she found out. A drink at the bar while waiting for a table, I understand. A drink at the bar while waiting to find out if you even have a table for us sounds like a very transparent (and poor)  upsell technique. So out of principal, we purposely did not order a drink while waiting. Now, let me be clear - It is completely against my better judgement to sit anywhere and not have a nice cocktail in hand, especially at a swanky bar. I was just annoyed by the fact that she wanted me to buy a drink while she checked to see if she could even seat us at all. Ok, so Strike 1 for GE. Shortly thereafter, said hostess finds a spot for us and we sit for dinner. Delicious chive popcorn on the table helped us ease into a more relaxing state of mind. Then, the opening of the wine list...no bottle of wine under $79. Look, we aren't cheap people and we know good wine (I mean, we got married in Napa and all). We know well enough that it's not difficult to offer a decent wine selection in the mid $40-50 range. Ok, so whatever, not THAT big of a deal - We order a nice bottle and continue to enjoy our popcorn. Then we start noticing the fruit flies. Yes, fruit flies - PLURAL. We saw at least 3-4 buzzing around our wine and food as well as that of the other patrons. Seriously? You don't put a wine for less than $79 on your menu and you have bugs flying around your establishment? A serious Strike 2, GE. We try to ignore the flies and continued to shoe them away for the rest of our meal. We ordered 3 apps and an entree to share as we weren't starving but wanted a taste of everything. We enjoyed the fluke tartare which was definitely different. The sweetbread empanada was nothing special and the deconstructed cesaer was much fishier than anticipated. We shared the cod for dinner was was very good, but per the other reviewers below, nothing all that special.  We would have had dessert but hubs was so grossed out by the bugs he just wanted to check to get out of there. Strike 3. Of course, it's not necessarily GE's fault that hubs didn't want to stick around but it kind of is. The total bill? $287 for an ""nothing special"" meal with fruit fly friends.  At least the expensive wine was good. Definitely won't be visting again.",0.9962,0.756,0.168,0.076,0.5776357142857144

I wanted to feel the same, but I'm sure the Obamas received a bit of a different treatment.  Perhaps they were actually seated at their table at their reservation time? Or received the right entree? Or were asked how they'd like their wagyu beef cooked? Service aside, the food hit so far on the salty end of the taste spectrum that a potential party-in-my-mouth became a test of endurance.

2011-03-11,2.0,"When did it become acceptable to feed people next to nothing and charge them an entire two-week's paycheck for those crumbs?    In sum, my husband left the highly lauded restaurant still hungry and we actually had to order sushi right after spending about $200 and about an hour and a half of our valuable Friday relaxation time in the cramped, cacophonous and just overly snotty rabbit hole. Upon arrival, we were greeted with three hostesses, each on vying for the crown of Miss Most Tattooed. Though we were on time, we were asked whether we'd like to have a couple of drinks at the bar. I instinctively thought that perhaps the restaurant was packed and our table wasn't ready. Nope, upon a closer inspection, the restaurant was about 90 percent empty on a Friday night at 7pm. Needless to say, we passed on drinks. The tattooed hippie chick led us to a tiny table up against a wall--you know, one of those tables where the hostess actually has to pull the table out to let you in. That's enough for me to turn anorexic, let alone want to eat at the restaurant. After snuggly fitting into the seat and having been boxed in by a tiny 24 inch wide table, my better half and I were ready to be wowed.  Our waiter arrived and clearly appeared to be on speed as he threw the menus at us and tried to run away without saying much. My husband valiantly tried to ask for a recommendation on a beer and actually had his eyes on one but the waiter resolutely told him that he'd like it only if he have a love affair with ginger and tried to dissuade him from that $12 beer to better one, say the $17 dollar one. Nonetheless, my husband ordered that supposedly gingery beer that turned out to be not gingery at all and quite tasty, actually. I, on the other hand, ordered something that was to be a peachy-esque mojito but turned out to be nothing more than a sugary, syrupy mess of a margarita. The following vodka martini came out in a scotch glass. Really? I had no words. To start, we were served popcorn with chives and black pepper and somewhere in there was to be truffle oil. You'd have to be Magellan to find that truffle oil in the popcorn. After filling up on the corn, much like little piggies in a pen, we wanted our dinner. Well, by the end of the meal, we were still wanting our dinner. As an appetizer, we wanted to share the fig and ricotta cold plate. The two figs were the size of two green table grapes. The ricotta was the size of chewed up piece of gum. Miniscule and unappetizing and certainly nothing to share--unless you're a mouse. Next, my husband had a deconstructed caesar salad with a twinkie and an anchovy. The lettuce was literally a rectangle about an inch wide and two inches long. That's it. the anchovy was sliced in thirds with each third sitting on that lettuce something or other. Oh, and that twinkie thing--it was no bigger than half of a small apricot. All this brouhaha over something that tasted just ""alright."" According to my husband, ""Nothing special."" I had the squash soup which arrived in a beaker, all 2 ounces of it, and the cold concoction got poured over a tiny marshmallow. How quaint.  At this point, I was waiting to be wowed by something--hopefully the entrees. Nope. That's a no go. My local whitefish (where the hell is it local from?-- if it's from Lake Michigan, well, that would explain the taste) was so tiny and so bland and so unseasoned. Now I'm no Barefoot Contessa but come on, throw some kosher salt on that puppy! The only good thing on the plate was the hot sauce which I'm sure was there to mask the taste. Oh, and the fish was about half the size of my iphone. I refuse to talk about the granola-like stale quinoa that was hiding under the fish. My husband had some highly-acclaimed wagyu beef that was cooked for 15 hours. I think our cats' food smells and looks better than what was placed before him. Because he was hungry, he ate it all up within two minutes. And at this point, I gave him half of my entrée because I just about had enough and I felt bad for him. The man's a mathematician. He works 12 hour days. He gets hungry. No, we don't want dessert or coffee or anything else. No, we didn't like our three waiters or the food coming out within minutes of each other. No, we don't think any of the accolades for the restaurant are deserved. Oh, and no, we don't want a picture with the rotund chef on the way out and oh, by the way, he didn't get to be blimp-sized from eating at his own restaurant.

The food just matches the ambience -- you have comforting, familiar things listed like wagyu steak or chicken noodle soup, but these things are just a starting idea of what you end up again. the dishes are so artfully constructed (a bit of molecular gastronomy, a bit of hyper-expensive, traditional classy dishes), with a twist of sorts, so what you get definitely crosses the line into, not just ""classy"" chicken noodle soup for example, but something altogether new. Honestly, a little hard to put into words, but I was just plain old EXCITED for every course that was coming my way. But the five star moment?

Here's what we had: (BTW the night/menu was dubbed 'i just dined in your arms tonight'- a valentine's day rock ballad inspired extravaganza- I mean really, that's f'n great, the songs playing would coincide with the course you were eating, genuis!) first course- fluke tartar, rose hips and cactus pear paired with a drink called rosie's hips, a nice cocktail light with a touch of citrus. second course- in house made (of course) yam gnocchi with a creamy taleggio cheese sauce, shaved truffles and chives. Paired with a robust chardonnay from burgundy. third course-foie gras, pie streusel crumbles, preserved bing cherries paired with a a cocktail that was served in a beaker, it was pink and a touch sweet. fourth course- skate wing lightly breaded, ham hock chunks in a smoky sauce with hazelnuts paired with a nice pinot noir. fifth course- braised short rib, vegetable confit and coddled egg, paired with an amazing grenache that would blow your socks off. sixth course- pink cotton candy, ginger brulee and caramel glass paired with an 11 year old dessert wine. I'm a big critic but everything including the entire staff was really great, they're totally educated in the food and was just as excited as you to be there experiencing it. It's very contemporary, aesthetically pleasing small artsy plates that are totally unpretentious and totally amazing. Go!!",0.9893,0.823,0.161,0.016,0.5464460784313724

2011-02-10,4.0,"Can't really describe what it is, but Graham Elliot has a very unique ambiance.  They totally do their own thing and seem almost snobby in doing so but they're able to pull it off. The popcorn that they start you off with is totally cool and tastes amazing. It's nice to have a place that doesn't go the normal boring bread route, and plus popcorn doesn't fill you up like bread does. We started with the Deconstructed Caesar Salad, which was really cool too.  I loved the brioche twinkie, totally innovative.  The twinkie filling was a little heavy on the garlic though, almost overpowering.  The romaine was a little bitter too.  But the twinkie makes the dish completely worth it. For the main dish, we had the cod and the beef filet. The cod was very nicely cooked, crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  There were a ton of components on the dish like wheat puree, herbs, sauces etc., most of them I didn't even know what they were but each had its own distinct flavor that combined to make a phenomenal dish. The beef filet medallions were ok.  The beef was kind of dry and tough.  This dish also had a bunch of other components, I especially liked the roquefurt panna cotta.  So creative. For dessert, we had the pineapple and the cocoa gateu.  Honestly, these weren't that great.  They looked cool but the flavors were too bitter and salty and the portions were like the size of sprinkles honestly.  I may be unrefined in my taste, but I like my dessert sweet and filling. The alcohol infused brownies they give you at the end were really good though. Overall, Graham Elliot is a very chic and super creative experience.  They could do better on some basics like not overpowering with certain flavors and cooking beef right, but the ambiance and creativity totally covers for it.",0.9979,0.693,0.254,0.053,0.6438988095238095

2011-02-08,5.0,"It's a Monday night and I'm at dinner at Graham Elliot. I wish I could say this was typical, that I'm at nice restaurants on weekdays all the time, but alas, it's a special occasion. I have brought my boyfriend here on a Monday night because his birthday this year happens to fall on a Monday. And whereas, I wish I had the former lifestyle (grand eating with minimal budget consciousness), I think I am in good company given our President also chose to his special occasion (birthday) dinner here not too long ago. The restaurant is on a lovely city block. With chunks of soft snow falling on a chilly, winter evening, it feels like a movie lit with street lamps and a backdrop of elevated train tracks. We enter the spacious loft that holds an air of elegance and refinement, yet possesses a hint of mischievousness. We are seated right against the crystal clear front window.  Our server has an easy-going niceness about her. The beer options are excellent (the wine selection, expensive). I had heard about the tasting menu but figured it was not an option for me since I am pescatarian and am allergic to shellfish (restrictions, restrictions). I am seriously surprised when the server let's us know that they can accommodate and would be able to adjust the tasting servings for me, as well as serve my boyfriend, the regular tasting menu. Nice! The infamous truffle popcorn they give you to noshe on lives up to its hype. The amuse-bouche servings were a play on the midwest apple-pie topped with cheese, a sorbet that was a nice cleanse of the palet, and a little mint brownie. The tasting menu was $75 and my pescatarian accommodated one consisted of caesar, celery soup, bass, cod, and cocoa dessert. Both the bass and the cod were cooked to perfection and believe me, I don't just throw a word like perfection around lightly. Plus, I eat a lot of fish, so I really do know. Every tasting dish was YUMMY. The birthday candle with dessert was a cute gesture. All in all, it was a standout, memorable, dining experience. Very glad to have celebrated here. Am looking forward to coming here on a weekend to see what the experience is like when it's really buzzing (my boyfriend thinks the quality of the food would suffer on a busier night). My friends are visiting from out of town soon, that's a special occasion right?",0.9981,0.745,0.216,0.039,0.6548848770277341
2011-01-29,2.0,"It might be the celebrity chef's name that brought me here (plus, word on the street was President Obama came here to celebrate his birthday), but it's also the reason my experience here last night was even more disappointing then it might have been otherwise. The look and feel here is certainly appealing - dimly lit and spacious, it's a great spot for a quiet, intimate dinner. The service was also out of this world - our waiter was energetic and very knowledgable -  definitely one of the highlights of the evening.  The trouble came when my parents and I started our search for a bottle of wine to share. Now, regardless of what your annual income is, I'm pretty sure most everyone can agree that a bottle of wine doesn't have to cost $100+ to be good.  I sense Graham Elliot never got that memo. Not only was 98 percent of the wine on their list in the triple digit price range, but their cheapest wine was $62 (and it was a white wine). I'm sorry, but ridiculously expensive wine does not a good restaurant make. I'm pretty sure it just makes said restaurant look pretentious and obnoxious. What would it hurt to offer wine in a range of price points - catering to more than just 2 percent of the population who don't bat an eye at spending hundreds of dollars on a few drinks? Needless to say, we did not order a bottle of wine. My dad and I went with beers (which were pretty decent), and my mom opted for a glass of wine (at $15 a pop, still ridiculous).  As for the food, the duck roulade was forgettably bland but the foie gras lollipops were interesting (I mean, they were sprinkled in POPROCKS! How fantastical is that)?  So the foie gras part may not have been quite so awesome (and the salt was WAY too heavy), but it certainly wasn't bad. I tried the white fish as my entree, and while it did melt in my mouth, the combination of eggplant and couscous created just an okay meal. The butternut bisque was the best part of my night - creamy deliciousness with a hint of marshmellow stirred in. I could have doubled that serving and opted out of the rest of the dining experience.  Finally, my parents ordered the beef, and requested it be cooked ""medium plus."" Yet, the cook apparently preferred to make it medium rare, so that's how it came out. My question is, who was paying for the meal here? And who were they trying to please?  Clearly not the customer, who will likely never return.",0.9976,0.768,0.19,0.042,0.6174823633156967

And when I was there, I was on a date with a guy who gives me massive rose colored glasses. But still. I get so annoyed at people who go to a place like Graham Elliot and then complain about the food to cost ratio. We had the 10 course tasting with pairings...yes, the courses are small. But the tastes are amazing and you don't leave hungry. If you want big portions, there are some lovely steakhouses in Chicago. The pairings were very unusual - at least to me. There was one snafu with the dessert pairing, but the waiter and mixologist were so sweet and apologetic and quick to bring us an additional dessert and cocktail that it was almost a *positive* part of the experience.  I don't think Graham Elliot takes itself too seriously at all. All our waitstaff was friendly and casual, but on the ball. My favorite part of the evening was when the busboy noticed that my date was coming across the table to sit next to me on the banquet between courses. He wordlessly, and with a cute twinkle in his eye flipped the table sideways so we could enjoy the rest of our meal without the back and forth.

No amuse bouches and I suppose on NYE, everything has already been made in the back, which is a bit lame when you're paying this much.  Some of the dishes were awesome - like the lobster with tapioca dish, but others were unimpressive (some type of fish wellington).  Overall, the service was decent - a bit of a rush since they were trying to make the late seating, but we got a tour of the kitchen which was a nice finish to the night.

The restaurant was very nice and modern/ contemporary and the ambiance was relaxing. We were taken to our table and a minute later a basket of popcorn was placed in front of us. It was one of the most exhilarating tastes ever, for popcorn that is. The popcorn had fresh ground pepper, chives, parmesan cheese, and the best ingredient ever, truffle oil. Such an orgasmic combination of flavors! I could have eaten that for dinner and skipped out on the meal but I didn't of course.  For my starter I had the cheddar risotto. It was a playful take on the classic Mac and Cheese. The cheddar risotto was creamy. Nice balance of saltiness and sweet (apples). My entrée was wagyu beef, powder foie, and truffle consommé. The wagyu was cook perfectly but it wasn't as tender as I had hope. I tasted more like tri tip than wagyu. I can honestly say, forget the wagyu and just give me the truffle consommé. The consommé was rich and just with each spoonful was a burst of great flavors. I also stuck my fork into the venison chop for a taste and thought that the chops tasted better.  Overall it was a good dining experience that served good food. I must say, the food was good but it wasn't anything out of the ordinary. It was good solid American food and it was done right but I wish that there was a wow factor. Great service and I had cold but lovely evening.

Very interesting twist on a regular salad and I felt like I was tasting something made on Top Chef. 2. Butternut Squash soup. Honestly, I make it better. It was overwhelmingly gingered...chunks were floating in it. Im a big ginger fan but this was too much! Blah 3. Scallops. They were alright. Pretty room temp if not cool. They had some type of topping with walnts and a bunch of other things. I didnt really like the walnut/scallop combo.  4.Wagyu Beef. Another highlight. It was cooked perfect and very tasty with little poatotes in the au jus. We wished we wouldve ordered this as an entree and skipped the tasting. 5. Smores.

My boyfriend and I went here for our third anniversary.  He works at Sepia, so he's waited on a few of Graham Elliot's employees, so the place was talked up to us and with good reason.   Immediately upon arrival, we were wished a happy anniversary.  Upon being seated, we were immediately given a complimentary glass of champagne (my boyfriend doesn't drink, so I got two!  woo!) and a complimentary order of the Foillipops.  I had been looking forward to these so hard, so after the initial disappointment of not seeing them on the menu, the shock and delight of not only receiving them, but receiving them for free was fantastic.  I'm not delusional, I saw plenty of other tables with champagne and Foillipops, so this wasn't just some sort of anniversary special - no, they treat all of their customers this well!

2011-01-03,5.0,"Graham Elliott is one of my favorite restaurants in Chicago. To put it bluntly, it's great! I love it. It's truly food as art at a much more affordable price than you can typically get this kind of food for. I really appreciate what Chef Bowles is doing with this place. He has taken his high end food out of Avenues at the Peninsula hotel, (which I had the pleasure of eating before he left and he was equally as fantastic there,) and brought it to River North where it's not required to drop $250+ on a tasting menu to sample. Chef Bowles' attitude about this place is also fantastic. Servers are required to wear jeans and gym shoes to make everyone comfortable about the casualness of dining there. High end food without the B.S., I love it. No need to get dressed up in an uncomfortable suit just to eat good food.  To start, the dining room is great. Large, open, not too crowded. Nothing I hate more than restaurants that pack you in one on top of the other so they can have as many tables as possible. I love the addition of the extra tables in the bar area that you can grab in case its packed and you don't have a reservation, or you just want to grab a drink and something small off the menu. Not too many fine ding places accommodate that. The servers are all cool and relaxed, fun to talk with, and very professional at the same time. Like a Jerry Kliener staff without the uppity attitude. The range of music coming from the staffs personal favs is a nice touch too. Most importantly is the food. Some people may think it's a little on the pricey side, but I challenge those people to prove it. The prices may seem a bit high upon a first glance at the menu, but they are no higher than any of the other popular River North spots in the same area. The food is also more inventive and unique than it's competitor's. I've eaten here 6 or 7 times since it opened, the menu is always completely different and it's always delicious. I've never tasted a dish I didn't like. In fact, on more than one occasion, I've tasted something that someone else ordered and it completely changed my mind about something I would never order myself. Graham Elliott has the ability to change a dish so much, you may not recognize it at all, but then you taste it, and it's spot on. The plating is completely unique and inventive, and the food tastes as good as it looks when you receive it. Chef Bowles has been doing food as art before it was popular and he's one of the best in the business. I haven't yet had a chance to do the newly introduced tasting menu, but I look forward to the day I finally get around to it. Not only are the starters and main courses great, but the pastry is wonderful as well. Two desserts I will never forget in my lifetime are the spiced rice krispy squares and the whimsical take on strawberry shortcake I had. Unlike a lot of his celebrity chef competitors, Graham Elliott can almost ALWAYS be spotted whenever you're eating in his restaurant. I don't know how much that has changed since he became a father and opened Grahamwich, but every time I dined there, Chef Bowles was in the kitchen and out on the floor. I'm a total food geek and when Graham Elliott first opened, I was one of the first people making reservations. It was slow my few first times there because word had still not spread about this amazing restaurant. My server at the time noticed how much I was enjoying my meal and offered to take me back into the kitchen to meet the chef. After I was done geeking out, I was able to meet Chef Bowles and briefly talk shop with him, and what a nice man he was. Not your typical egotistical a-hole chef, but an all around nice guy to have a conversation with. He seemed real down to earth and that makes me respect him and his food even more. I eat out 360 of the 365 days of the year. I vacation to eat elsewhere. Living in Chicago allows me to sample so many different restaurants that I literally never have to eat at the same place twice. Very rarely do I return to a restaurant frequently, so when I do, it's special to me. Graham Elliott is one of the few I will go back to again and again. Great food, great service, a real unique experience without all the fluff.",0.9986,0.831,0.149,0.02,0.5646092503987241

It honestly felt like torture after the 3rd course, all 3 of us just wanted this experience to end. The curry soup was the worst of all, first they brought the ingredients on the plate and then dumped the actual liquid soup from a beaker into your plate making a butchery of the flavors. Almost all of the dishes were too salty and they used too much purées and sauces smeared on the plate. They even managed to ruin the wagyu course, they bought a nice arrangement only to be bathed by another liquid concoction that was poured onto the dish to flood the delicate meat.

2010-12-04,2.0,"I deliberated for a long time about how to rate this restaurant. In part, I kept excusing it as better than what it actually was because I had been so excited to come here. It was my boyfriend's first time visiting me in Chicago since I had moved here and he shelled out A LOT of money even though we're both kinda poor right now. So needless to say I kept needing to make this evening feel special.  I ended up choosing two stars instead of three solely based on the price. It ended up at about $100+ per person which may seem reasonable for 2 drinks, appetizer, main course, and dessert, but I have had equal amounts of food at equally nice places for significantly less. Now if I had had a mind blowing meal I wouldn't have even taken a second look at the price, but it didn't.  The appetizers were equal to things I've made in my kitchen. They weren't bad -- I would even say they were good, but nothing amazing. And I've routinely blown my mind with my own food, so you'd think a place with this much prestige could manage. We had the cheesy risotto and some type of curried soup (it was either pumpkin or squash but I cannot remember). I would give this section alone 3 stars. For the main course we had the suckling pig entree and the wagyu beef. The pig would have gotten 3 stars on its own, the beef 4. The pig was forgettable, and simply A-OK. The beef was REALLY nicely cooked and had a nice subtle flavor to it. Both portions were SUPER small. My boyfriend tried to joke with the waitress about the size. She coldly replied that it was because the quality was so high.  Now to dessert... we had the roasted pear (2 stars) and the s'mores (5 stars! No 10!). The roasted pear was a waste of money... absolutely underwhelming. However, the s'mores were hands down the best thing I have ever eaten. I feel extremely guilty now that I didn't share more with my sweetie who was stuck with his subpar choice. I am a bad girlfriend, but those s'mores were SO DAMN GOOD.  The extras: The popcorn at the beginning with truffle oil and Parmesan had a great flavor, but was awfully stale. I ordered a champagne-based cocktail (The Elliot Spritzer... props for the name) which just tasted like champagne. Good champagne, and well, I like champagne so I can't complain too much, but not what I was looking for (I really like well thought-out cocktail flavor combos). My boyfriend had a beer that the waitress recommended, and it was really really good. They can't get too much credit since they didn't brew it, but props on the selection.   All in all, the food is better than the two stars I gave it, but it is accurate of the ""Meh. I've experienced better"" that Yelp attaches to the two star rating. I have had better for less. Some things were better than others, but apart from the s'mores nothing was so amazing that I need to go back.

I got asked for a Ketel martini and was told they don't carry popular spirits but their own unique collection.   The waitress recommended some special vodka that was distilled 16 times from corn in Sweden or something and it was AMAZING.   Probably the best vokda martini I've ever had.  I wanted a beer afterwards and they had two only on tap - some wheat beer brewed by Goose Island for Graham Elliot (I forget the name) and the Goose Island Bourbon County Stout (drink with caution).   Now to the food: - Caesar salad: The cruton was a delicious brioche ""twinkie"" (yum) - Bisque: Think Thai curry with tiny squash and tiny marshmallows melting in it (my favorite dish of the night) - Scallop: I'm not a huge scallop but these were cooked perfectly - Wagyu: Foie Gras powder - amazing.  - Smores: The homeade graham cracker made it  They serve Metropolitan coffee and I needed some espresso after that Bourbon County Stout (which I later found out was 13% alcohol.)  Overall, this was a great experience, great food, and great drinks.  Needless to say we had a great night and loved this place.   Pro-tip:  The website is cool but completely inaccurate on the menu and drinks (which are probably changed on a weekly basis)",0.9976,0.745,0.217,0.038,0.6908730158730158

2010-11-07,2.0,"This experience was less than we had hoped for. To be fair, our visit was on a Friday night around 7:30pm and we walked in without a reservation. The hostess was very polite when she explained that we could not be seated at a table but did explain that we could be seated at the bar or the large communal table in the bar area. We were pointed in the direction of the bar and left to fend for ourselves. We were okay with this entered the bar area filled with excitement for a wonderful meal.  When we first arrived there was a group at the communal table and our party of three were able to find three seats at the bar.  We grabbed a seat and waited! The bartender was engaged in a conversation with another member of the service staff at the time and then moved on to other customers (with drinks) at the bar. When he did come to take our drink orders I would not call the interaction friendly, he did not really greet us or welcome us to the establishment. This is something I consider standard even if you are visiting a 'dive' neighborhood tavern the barkeep will say hello and welcome you, this is hospitality 101 folks, it went from bad to worse when our orders were non-alcoholic in nature. I am normally one to have an adult beverage or two but this particular evening happened to fall on the eve of the Hot Chocolate 15K and I did not want to compound a poor pre-race meal choice with alcohol!  Back to the story, our entire party ordered diet cokes and said that we would like to eat at the bar and would like menus. He did quickly bring us menus and vanished again. After sitting for approximately half an hour discussing the menus our drinks had yet to arrive. At this point we were ready to leave and began discussing other nearby options. At this exact point the group at the communal table were seated in the dining room and we decided to give Graham Elliot another shot.  When we sat down at the table the experience did improve dramatically. The waitress was quick with the menus and shared her knowledge of the menu with us freely. The bartender even brought over our diet coke's that were ordered 40 minutes earlier. The atmosphere was generally pleasing but I would have to say the music was a little on the loud side. This opinion was reinforced by all members of our party, one who had visited before and been seated in the dining room said that she found the music on the loud side then. We all agreed that it would have been nice to be able to converse a little more easily while enjoying such exquisite food.  The food was excellent. Even if it is common knowledge, it must be said, the truffle oil popcorn is an excellent way to start things. From there I went with the deconstructed Caesar and it did not disappoint. Each bite was perfection. After the Caesar it was on to the wagyu beef, also excellent.  My two star review has little to do with the food and everything to do with the level of service and atmosphere. In fact the food saved the second star. It is unacceptable to treat (well) paying customers in such a flippant manor. My dining dollars are better spent at other establishments.",0.9985,0.791,0.175,0.034,0.5432887774993038
2010-11-06,4.0,"I loved the food here!  We were given complimentary popcorn seasoned with truffle oil, parmesan, and pepper, which was a great, tasty starter.  We went with the five-course tasting menu that came with a deconstructed caesar salad, butternut bisque, seared scallops, wagyu beef, and s'mores.  We also ordered the fois gras with pop rocks, which was amazing.  The lettuce of the caesar salad was perfectly seasoned and came with a delicious brioche twinkie.  The scallops were cooked to perfection with a sweet coffee sauce.  This is the best scallops i've tasted.  The wagyu beef was perfectly cooked as well and came with a warm, comforting truffle consommee, root vegetables and sprinkled with freshly shaved truffles.  The s'mores came with a delicious peanut butter ice cream.  The only dish I did not love was the bisque because of its strong ginger flavor.  The presentation of the food was interesting.  All of the liquids came in science lab glassware - think Erlenmeyers and beakers.   The only downside was the portion sizes for the five-course tasting menu are very small.  I felt bad for my husband because I knew he left hungry.  If we go back, which I hope we do, we will either order the ten-course menu or order a la carte, which apparently is larger portions. The wait staff is dressed casually and lends an unpretentious vibe to what should otherwise be a fancy restaurant.  Our waitress was friendly and helpful.  We were served by a number of other people throughout the meal and they were all very nice.",0.9956,0.735,0.234,0.031,0.6208024691358024

We even ventured into the fois gras lollipop with pop rocks as an amuse bouche. And, amuse, it did. We couldn't stop smiling.  But on to the serious part. I had figs with curiously whipped balsamic, marzipan powder, light ricotta as a starter. Potent flavors, but in a gentle portion, sweetly laid out in a crescent  on the plate. My honey got the deconstructed caesar salad, also tasty, and the waygu beef w/ potatoes and parsnips, covered with a truffle consommee. I had scallops (mmmm) with salsify gnocchi, and maybe a squash or pumpkin puree smear. Very tasty. Also got a good wine recommendation that worked with both courses.  I loved this place, it was on the casual side for atmosphere, but I like effort placed in food first, service then focus on the atmosphere. I felt comfortable and think you could go fancy or in dressed-up jeans, with anything in between. I would definitely go for drinks here. Just know (if you have hearing problems), the music is a little loud, and the room a little echo-y, so I won't be taking my in-laws here. For my fun-loving friends, willing to compromise on portion size for flavor, I'd take them in a heart beat.

2010-10-20,2.0,"I was so excited to try Graham Elliot after all the hype. My husband and I love to try new places and were up to splurge on a nice meal. We have never been more disappointed with a fine dining experience. The decor and atmosphere was cool and relaxed with mirrored shadow boxes of gourds and potatoes. We both ordered the tasting menu, which sounded like a bit of everything. We put our drink order in right away (we didn't drive and were ready to have a good time!) but 20 minutes went by before we saw our waiter again. Instead of bringing our drinks, he was there with our first dish. The popcorn we had been munching on had gotten us very thirsty. The caesar salad he delivered only angered us more. Apart from being two bites of food and plated on the very edge of a huge plate, the brioche part (about 50% of the two bites) was partially frozen and completely stale. I tore up the top of my mouth eating it, which ruined the rest of my dining experience.   The squash lemongrass soup and scallops were the best parts of the meal. The soup was flavorful and made me want to have a piece of bread to wipe the bowl with (maybe that stale piece of brioche would have been better with this course...) And how could you not love scallops? The short rib entree was about three bites of really tough meat and connective tissue that was very hard to chew. The flavors were good, but it was not pleasant to eat.   The desert was much better sounding then tasting and did not provide much flavor. Overall, our experience at Graham Elliot was: 1.Tiny portions of poorly prepared and presented food. 2. TERRIBLE SERVICE- except the excellent bussing. The waiter never checked on us until it was time for us to tip him. When we told him we were not satisfied, he joked that we should order the full experience menu next. NO THANK YOU. 3. Not at all worth the hype. Go somewhere else where more thought and care is put into the food and less into the ""cool-ness."" Did I mention that we stopped for beers tacos right afterword?

2010-10-20,4.0,"My BFF and I went here for her birthday dinner. It was a Tuesday night @ 6:45 and the restaurant only had about 8 other patrons. It did get a little busier later in the evening.  When using OpenTable, I requested they do something special for her- but they didn't bring out ANYTHING or mention it once, especially at an establishment of this caliber, so I was kind of disappointed! Even Cheesecake Factory brings you out a [complimentary] small sweet treat.  We ordered the 5 plate tasting menu. All the entrees were delicious. I know what a Caesar salad is made up of, however when the dish came- it had half an anchovy lying across the top! Thus, while eating it, it was a VERY sharp fishy flavor. AVOID this dish if you do not like seafood. The curry butternut squash was phenomenal! This was only my 2nd bowl of this type of soup in my life and I LOVED it. They brought it out in a beaker (different & pretty cool), explained what was on our plate, then poured it in. It could've been a bit hotter though, it was lukewarm nearing cool. The scallops were cooked PERFECTLY, had a slight bounce to them, tender, and not chewy or fishy. The wagyu beef was good, the potatoes were just right, not too mushy or overcooked, and the truffle consomme SOUP- this is where the money was at! They give you that spoon for a reason, after one sip, I had this urge to put the bowl to my lips and throw my head back! Since I am a dessert person, this dish was my runner up. Dessert was my favorite part of this entire meal! We had smores, sounds simple, but it wasn't. There was chocolate ganache, a tiny scoop of (half-melted) vanilla ice cream- but ice cream nonetheless,  peanut butter crème (not aesthetically pleasing though I must admit), cracked pieces of graham crackers, and perfectly roasted cube shaped marshmallows. DELICIOUS, much better than camping! I ordered a Diet Coke in the beginning which cost me $3.50 because it came in a little glass bottle- SKIP IT! I also ordered coffee- an additional $4- but it came in a French press and a little hour glass (like the kind from a board game to let me know when it would be ready). I loved it- this was worth the $! I am a huge fan of Dunkin Donuts coffee, and this was mind-blowingly delicious with 3 packets of Splenda & some crème. TRY IT!  BUT I don't understand the plating. They used huge dinner plates but only put food on a tiny portion of it. I understand presentation is a big deal, but all the white empty space is a waste IMO- plus it makes your portion look TINY! Also, the wait time between dishes a tad bit longer than I would have liked on a slow Tuesday evening- can you imagine how it would be on a Saturday night?! FORGET IT! I would have liked for them to leave the popcorn tray so we could have had something to nibble on. Let me tell you, they have some superb busboys. They are very attentive. Filled water very quickly, folded our napkins almost immediately, cleared our plates quietly- I appreciate that b/c I also serve P/T. We sat near the orange drape that led to the bathrooms; everyone who passed made it a point to shut it ALL the way- which was appreciated since I could see the bathroom doors. The waiters wear GE's brown t-shirt with jeans. So it does give off a laid back feel to the venue while maintaining a classy dining experience. Hostess greeted upon entry and when leaving. The music is just fine- not too loud or disruptive. Lighting is dim and romantic. Overall, good experience. I left happy on a full tummy.",0.9989,0.769,0.19,0.041,0.5757561132561132

(We think he thought he was special b/c he was wearing skinny jeans and Converses.  We didn't have the heart to tell him so was every other 20-something urbanite across the country.) - We sat for another 15 min before our drinks even arrived.  - We then waited 20 min before our waiter returned to take food orders.  We were dumbfounded at this point.   We couldn't even enjoy conversation b/c we had to yell to hear each other over Radiohead wailing through the speakers.  - We were never thanked for coming in, apologized to for all the delays, or simply told to have a nice evening.  The food and marriage of flavors were gratifying but not worth the prices ($35 for small entrees), and they were ruined by the nasty service. We could've been treated better at nearby Ed Debevic's. It seemed to us that Graham Elliot can't decide on an identity.  It's one part insouciant hipster, other part establishment snob who disdains customers like my friend, a fashion exec albeit with a non-starched style of dress.   Either way, pretension without excellence is annoying.   Grow up, boys.",-0.4723,0.771,0.11,0.119,0.5646616541353384

Graham Elliot totally changed my opinion on this style of eating. I went with a group of co-workers last night with reservations for 7:15PM. We were promptly seated in a comfortable corner. First, I have to say I love the atmosphere, decor, and music. It's a cool mix of jazz, lounge, and rock music. Who would have thought that would go well together?  For starters, our waitress brought of some crazy good truffle popcorn with black pepper. WOW. All four of us were starving and dismantled the popcorn within minutes. For a drink, and I had a killer dry vodka martini. I was a little confused by the menu at first, but our waitress quickly explained and walked us through the process. How thoughtful! I went with the deconstructed caeser salad. Insane. I loved it! It had some weird ""twinkie"" bread with cheese in it.  Appetizers and salads are easy to order, but I was getting a little nervous about the main course. Everything was meat. I had to ask about a vegetarian dish and I'm so glad I did. The waitress recommended an orange tofu dish that isn't on the menu. Seriously, probably one of the best tofu plates I've ever had. I'm a foodie, by means of trying new restaurants of all different types, but I'm not a food snob.

Although I was sad there was no Tuna Sashimi, they have great options... we did the Tasting Menu - so here goes: Two things to try: Butternut Squash Soup (thai-ish style) was excellent! Lemongrass marshmallow and curry 'chips' make this a really unique take on a butternut squash. I tend to like spicier dishes, so I could have done with more of the curry pieces, but overall enjoyed the soup.  Scallops - prepare yourself to want to lick the plate! They were perfectly cooked/seasoned and paired with a fennel salad (can't recall exactly what was in it) that was perfect harmony  Unfortunately our meal was cut short due to my sister getting a migraine mid-meal :( BUT the staff was gracious enough to pro-rate our bill.  One other note, when you do the tasting, you have the option of having them do drink pairings. The pairing with the ceasar salad was great - a Sauvignon Blanc that was spot-on; the drink with the squash is made with bitters, which my sister was not a big fan of. I thought it paired nicely.

Also, pet peeve: each time we were served a dish they placed it in front of the wrong person. Quite an accomplishment for a table of 3. The presentation was beautiful and the food was in tiny portions, which is nice since I don't like big heavy meals. The signature popcorn you're served was odd to me. It was soggy, lacked any crispness and epitomized mediocre. Literally, it was soggy popcorn with some cheese shaved on top. Not a fan. I thought the scallop appetizer was OK; the deconstructed caesar salad was excellent. I ordered the ahi tuna entre, again just OK. I tried some of the chicken... what a mistake, I wish I got that! It was so delicious. There was a bit of brown foam with it that had the most magnificent flavor. I would've ordered the foam and drank it out of a jug-if possible. In short, the chicken would be the only thing I would go back for.  Half way through dinner all of the lights went out and the wait staff freaked out. We sat in total darkness for about 10 minutes. Did they forget to pay their electric bill? What's with that?  Last thing I have to say about Graham Elliot was it was SO overpriced. It was not that special. Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it.",0.9682,0.78,0.134,0.086,0.5900026455026456
2010-09-15,3.0,"I read many reviews before deciding to visit Grahm Elliot last weekend with my wife but wanted to try something a little different.  I always enjoy new flavors and was pleased by most of the combinations. I can honestly say "" the corn soup is AMAZING!"".  ....... .........I never thought I would write such words!!!  First, I did not find the music to be too loud, the patrons were much louder.  The bartenders were very nice courteous and helpful to questions.  The waiters spoke too quickly and very rehearsed. The restaurant felt understaffed and you waited for service then the food abruptly was presented and off they went..  The food was very original, high quality and many flavors were presented....  a true test of culinary creativity. Some of the combinations tried a little too hard, that does not bother me.  GE is stepping out of the box in many ways with his food creations and with that there will be many successes and some flops...... time will be the judge of that!  I am torn on the overall star rating....  Quality 4 stars  Creativity 5 stars  Service 2-3 stars  Atmosphere 3 stars  This one is a coin toss if I will go back!  I really love new and daring flavor combinations!",0.996,0.737,0.248,0.015,0.5411174242424241
2010-09-14,4.0,"The other night I had a gaggle of girlfriends in from high school celebrating a bachelorette party for a college friend of theirs. The bride was very nice and invited me along even though I had never met her prior to that evening. Before I met them at the club, however, they decided to do some sexxytime games and present openings at an apartment in River North. I decided to opt out of that part of the evening and strolled into Graham Elliot for a drink instead.  It was late on a Saturday and they were about ready to close but they didn't give me dirty looks or anything when I sat down at the bar which I was thankful for. The music was good (Arcade Fire and Band of Horses to name a few) and the bartender fixed up my drink (vodka and diet) quickly and it was nice and stiff. He made some small talk with me which was appreciated but not necessary. Luckily I'm not someone who really stresses out about going to a bar or restaurant by myself so I didn't need rescuing but his conversation was friendly-chatty and not the ""oh-this-poor-lonely-girl-needs-company"" kind of chatty. Perfect tone. Other employees walked around taking care of their closing duties and they were all friendly and didn't make me feel uncomfortable in the slightest. I sipped my drink until I heard from the ladies that the festivities were moving to the club so I settled my tab and cut out of there so they could finish up closing.  I realize my time there was brief but everyone was so nice and the drink was good so I wanted to give Graham Elliot some credit where credit is due. If they had turned me away at the door because they were closing I probably would have stood on the street corner for about a half hour twiddling my thumbs and avoiding drunk dudes (one of whom ripped my water bottle out of my hand and ran away as he passed me just before I went into GE. UGH) so I am appreciative of the shelter and booze they provided. The drink price was a little steep but I was expecting that.

Our waiter was knowledgeable and attentive as were the rest of the wait staff. I liked the music/ambience and did not find it too loud. However, for the price they charge, I would like to see a little larger portions. Luckily we all had a snack prior to coming here, but everyone at the table was barely satiated when we left and we all had the 5 course tasting menu. The wine list is really hard to follow with all their ""rock"" jargon. I gave the waiter a hint on the range that I was looking to be in for the wines ($60) and he didn't take it. He kept recommending $100+ bottles and offering to drop the price a little. I asked about getting one of the bottles that they sell by the glass and he said, just multiply it by five...

I was so excited to go to your restaurant, had heard about the rissotto with cheez-its...and I left with an emptiness it my heart, stomach and wallet.  I know it's fine dining, but your portions are SMALL. Here is what we ordered: - Hushpuppies appetizer (2 hushpuppies) - Scallops appetizer (2 scallops) - Pork Entre (3-4 thin, small slices of pork) - Chicken and Gnocchi Entre (4 of the smallest pieces of chicken I have ever eaten with 6...I counted...6 pieces of rice gnocchi strategically placed on the plate, with foams)  - 2 cheap beers Total Cost = $130 (and the rissotto wasn't on the menu) Graham, you are a large man, and you clearly did not get that way eating your own portions. I wanted to love it so bad, as I love my personal vision of Graham Elliot, and this stop was to be the highlight of my trip. And it was the lowlight of the trip.

2010-08-31,5.0,"I thought that my meal at Alinea would have been the main highlight of my dining experience in Chicago, but a last minute decision to eat at Graham Elliot ended up in two visits for two different tastings within the span of four days (they changed it up for me my second time there).  I was not disappointed either time! This is definitely a casual place with upscale food.  You would feel comfortable showing up in shorts or jeans, but once the food hits the table, you find yourself looking over your shoulder for the maitre'd who has noticed how underdressed you are and is now bringing you a jacket and tie (no, the maitre'd never came).  Yes, the music is loud, but it's a great way to shatter any notion of pretention when you've got Metric and Postal Service blasting the night away. But onto the food.  You can't go wrong with the 5 course tasting.  The brioche twinkie in the deconstructed caeser provides a fantastic bite as you break through the crisp, fried crust and into a warm, oozing center of marscapone cheese.  The tuna sashimi, however, takes you in a whole other direction with the light, acidic notes of passionfruit barely gracing the fresh pieces of fish, and then kicked into overdrive with a spicy passionfruit sorbet laced with roasted red pepper and red fresno chili! The sweetbread hushpuppy was good, but the corn bisque was the show stopper and an absolute surprise.  Who wants hot soup on a warm summer night?  This guy does, if it's laced with corn nuts and chipotle adobo!  The lime crema added perfect notes of acidity in addition to the spicy and crunchy bits, but nothing could compare to the huitlacoche marshmallow - an amazing blend of earthy and sweet that catches you off guard when sampled on its own, but melts beautifully into the creamy, decadent bisque and enhances the natural sweetness of the corn even more. The Alaskan halibut was really the most well executed piece of fish I have had in a very, very long time.  Although I loved the earthiness of the chanterelles and the sublime smoky champagne beurre blanc below, this dish really shone in my eyes because of how well it showcased the halibut and the perfection in execution.  The Hawaiian ahi was my other ""sea"" dish, was also nicely done, but nowhere near as transcendent as the halibut. Both the wagyu steak and grilled lamb were phenomenal.  Even the fingerling potatoes were basted in the wagyu steak juices and dressed with truffle oil, making them a strong contender for my utmost affection.  The lamb was simply outstanding - sous vide'd and perfectly seared, this lamb was unequivocally AS tender as the wagyu beef, and equally as delicious.  You can't go wrong with either one here. And finally, dessert.  The strawberry shortcake was pleasant and certainly fun with the addition of lavender gelato and a balsamic reduction, but the chocolate torte took savoury sweetness to a whole new level.  There was a bold intensity to the salted caramel underlying each bite of cream cheese ice cream and dark chocolate torte.  Although not an unusual concept to salt your sweets, there was just something about the way they brought out the deep richness of the chocolate that made me stop and take notice. What can I say.  I still play these meals over and over again in my head.  The perfectly executed proteins, the breath taking flavour profiles - very few places have caught my attention like Graham Elliot has, and I can't wait for the next time I get to go back.",0.9995,0.752,0.236,0.012,0.567992424242424

When reviewers say that Graham Elliot is a playful take on gourmet, they really mean it. I mean, what hauty restaurant would have something like Arrogant Bastard Ale on their bar menu? My boyfriend obviously ordered that just to be able to say it to the waitress.  I adore the truffle popcorn that they serve in place of bread and butter.

It's a larger space than I expected, the tables are evenly spaced and the colors are neutral but interesting. I really liked that the menu's are located on LP covers (even if mine was Barry Manilow). I had the North Bridge Fizz for a cocktail and it was very good, but my wife's Anise in Wonderland was phenomenal. We each started with the froie grois lollipops which I thought was very cool whereas my wife wasn't a fan. I then had the twinkie ceasar salad and my wife had the pea soup with the mint marshmallow. Both of these were huge hits for us. I then had the pork tenderloin for my entree which was good but not amazing. I can't recall what my wife's fish dish was but it tasted very good. We then each ordered a dessert. All I can recall about mine was that it had a cardamum ice cream that was divine. My wife's had a cream cheese ice cream which was too powerful and muted the flavors of the other items on the dish. You're probably wondering based on that review why only three stars. Well, my wife hit it on the head when she said ""I was able to eat my own starter, entree, and dessert...and that NEVER happens."" The size of the plates are small, and we both agreed this is a great thing. I hate leaving a restaurant feeling like my stomach is about to explode, but I also think the cost should be comparable. There are plenty of places I've eaten in the city that offer comparable portions (or even larger) for a better price. Graham Elliot is a very cool dude (he even stopped by my table to shake my hand!) so it's nothing against him. It's just going to be difficult for me to revisit knowing the cost and portion ratio.",0.9922,0.783,0.163,0.054,0.7012820512820513

2010-07-17,2.0,"My wife and I are diners that have experienced great restaurants in many parts of the world. This is my first review of any restaurant... I felt compelled to write because it is rare for me to feel so ripped off. After watching a piece on Nightline about the chef on 7/15 I sat down and made a rez on Open Table for Fri night (7/16) without reading any reviews. I expected an expensive meal, but my philosophy is that any individual that has special talent, whether a chef or a dentist, has the right to charge premium prices for their personal labor.  We decided on the 5 course pre fixe( if the price was marked on the menu, we didn't see it or care) to sample. We were concerned about too much food but the server assured us that she never had a complaint from anyone feeling ""stuffed"" after. That was an understatement! First, he popcorn tasted stale. Then the caesar was a disappointment. The pea bisque that followed was excellent and an adequate portion. The halibut was excellent quality but was the size of 3 postage stamps. The first pieces of Waygu beef mere melt in the mouth, but most were chewy.  The strawberry shortcake was a joke with 3-4 slices of strawberry that would not account for one large strawberry.  All of the presentations were very artful, befitting the district where the restaurant is located. However, like some of the art in the nearby galleries, this restaurant experience would be best for those who don't mind buying the sizzle at a high price. My guess is that many who give this 5 stars would give the same to the ""Emperors New Clothes"". We went expecting a ""Fifteen"" experience from an eccentric chef and were disappointed by the food and the $240 tab that included one glass of so-so cabernet and a 20% tip. (The service was good but I got the feeling I was being ""sold"" ala Mortons... when I explained that I didn't drink and was fine with ice tea, I was encouraged to try a ""peach non-alcoholic drink"". I passed but reflected on that later as at least a  $10 add to the tab)",0.9919,0.839,0.139,0.022,0.48361794638110434

I had dinner here with my girlfriend ordered 2 appetizers and 2 entrees and after we had spent 126.00 I had to go to 5 guys for a cheeseburger all-out and fries. The food comes in portions fit for Keebler elves. The food does taste good. We had the deconstructed Caesar and duck satay for apps which tasted great. The portions were not as egregious as the main course.   My girlfriend had the pork while I had the lamb. The pork was definitely the heartier of the 2. The lamb was essentially equivalent to a single skewer worth of food including vegetables. Bottom line I believe a restaurant should leave you feeling satisfied. I'm not looking for a buffet, but I do expect that I will not be hungry after a dinner service. Perhaps I'm supposed to order the 165 per person tasting menu.

2010-07-13,4.0,"Awwww I LOVE this place!! They're food was fun, innovative and extremely special! It was just what the boyfriend and I were looking for for our last dinner in Chicago - a feat that seemed hard to fill.  Major, major kudos to the backup server/pt filipino-looking bartender (he looked it.. i didn't ask... but he did work as both a server and bartender). If it weren't for him, I think the boyfriend would've walked out after the first taste of strange and stale popcorn and the overly expensive menu. Thank goodness he came to our rescue though, because our meal was truly memorable. As explained by our new friend, the tasting menu was simply ""the chef's best of"". If you want to get an idea of what he thinks is best, just order parts of that. We did exactly such for our entrees, ordering both the halibut and wagyu steak. Since he also recommended that we get 1 dish from both the cold and hot menu as well, we go the sashimi and the duck... a blend of light and heavy... summer and fall... yummy and yummier. =) What can I say except that it blew our minds away. The pairing of the sorbet w/ the sashimi and the liquified avocado was essently like a cool cucumber splash on a hot miami day. If you're into fashion, it was like wearing bright lime green against everything dreary and grey. It was like a kick in the face to say ""HEY! Wake up!! It's time to eat your meal!!"". It was really just that special! As for the halibut and the steak... oh the heavenly party in my mouth that took place after a meal from those two. Separately, every ingredient seemed ok but together they seemed strange. Thankfully, GE did it just right though, and was able to pull it off in a way that was like a roller coaster cab flying through the air as if it were never to fall crashingly to the ground. It was like Aladdin's magic carpet... a method of transport to your own lovely dream. And the portions... well the portions were perfect! There's nothing I can't stand more than the over-abundance that the USA is, especially when it comes to food. WE DON'T NEED ALL THAT FOOD!! That said, the portions were served perfectly. We walked away feeling full, but not to the point that we needed to sleep.  My only complaint, though, was that the wine was just too damned expensive!! I know the restaurant was more fine-dining than it was a regular night out, but for me to find nothing less than $70 for a bottle of red was insane! My boyfriend and I both expected that there'd be at least one bottle for around $50. And for a meal that was that thought out, having just 1 glass didn't seem fitting. If there were wine, I think my meal would've been a full 5 red stars. For me though, a meal just isn't a meal w/o a nice glass of red.

2010-07-08,4.0,"Service from the bar to the table was EXCELLENT.  The bartenders were chatting with us as we enjoyed our drinks.  We were seated when our reservation was up and they were able to accommodate our request to sit by the window. The popcorn at the beginning of the meal was AMAZING.  There were three of us there to celebrate and indeed we did.  We decided not to go with the tasting menus and just ordered a la carte and split the items.  We started with the tuna sashimi and and beef carpaccio.  Both were really well balanced with only slightly overpowering by passion fruit of the tuna.  Other than that, PERFECTION. Next was the pea bisque with the mint marshmallow.  It was interesting, but a bit salty.  I'm glad it was there to try, and we ate it all, but I don't think I'd order it again.  The sea scallops came out at the same time.  These were seared perfectly, but I found the combination of the almond with the scallop to be too heavy.  The other people at the table enjoyed them both a lot. Then came the seafood.  We went with the kajiki, halibut, and salmon.  The kajiki was ever so slightly overcooked for me, but the flavors were spot on.  The halibut and salmon were also great, but the kajiki was definitely the winner of the group.  I would order any of them again though.  The halibut and salmon were cooked to perfection. When we got to land, we went with the wagyu beef, the pork, and the lamb.  Lamb really isn't my thing so I wasn't a fan, but the rest of the table really enjoyed it.  The wagyu was MELT IN YOUR MOUTH.  I could eat three plates of that myself.  The pork was a little odd for me, though.  It smelled really strongly of barbecue which is not a bad thing.  The texture was a little strange for me but the flavor was good. Last but not least was dessert.  We went with the strawberry sponge cake and the dark chocolate torte.  The strawberry dessert was delicious and had a really pronounced strawberry flavor.  The chocolate wasn't as great as I was hoping, and I think it's because it tasted like there was liquor in there.   Overall, the tab came to about $500 with gratuity and 2 bottles of wine.  I would definitely come back here for another meal!",0.9979,0.791,0.194,0.016,0.49189189189189186

2010-07-01,4.0,"How I'd describe the restaurant: Creative delicious cuisine that's ""fancy food without being stuffy."" Recommended for: people looking for a fun special occasion restaurant who are feeling a little more adventurous than usual. Pick MK if you like your American food more ""classic"". (i.e. larger portions) I must agree that the popcorn is addictive but our waiters were stingy when it came to re-filling our basket. Our first basket, despite the kernels being cold and starting to stale (i.e. getting chewy and undesirable) was still full of flavor, delicious and pungently awesome. If you happen to get a fresh basket, you'll find warm medium-sized plain popcorn, evenly coated with a light film of truffle oil, salt, and pepper. We had 3 but I wish we had a 4th instead of that mediocre pineapple dessert.  Carrie me Home cocktail: The most unmemorable cocktail I've had at a fancy restaurant. It was a little disappointing. White Tuna Sashimi ($13): A. This was not only a stunner, but incredibly delicious to eat. ""sashimi"" instills the idea of Japanese cuisine, yet when you actually combine all the elements of the plate together into one bite, the flavor screams CEVICHE!! The fish itself was extremely fresh and the flesh was actually the sweetest element on the plate.  Scallop Almondine ($15): B+. Apparently, this was such a successful entree from the winter menu that they decided to move it into spring as an appetizer. Despite the fact that the scallop itself was seared to perfection (browned on the outside but still soft, tender and juicy on the inside), the sour blood orange based topping was not anything I'd ever order again. Great Lake Whitefish with red lentil, curried cucumber, currant chutney, chai froth ($28): A+ Awesome. This Indian-themed, Asian inspired seafood dish really hit home for me. Personally, I am the hugest fan of pickled vegetables and Shanghainese vinegar (thank my Chinese heritage), which I'm guessing was what GE marinated their sour berries in. The rest of the dish, including the pureed lentils, fried curry cauliflower, and pan-seared fish were actually one the heavier side, so to have some acidity from the cucumbers and berries really made this dish sing for me. The individual elements of this dish were prepared perfectly including the tender yet crispy outside of the whitefish. However, I can see someone who's not too crazy about Indian spices or tart flavors be too fond of this dish. Pineapple dessert ($10): Never again.  RATINGS Taste: 4/5 Plating: 4.5/5 Originality: 5/5 Value: 3/5 Service: 4/5 Overall, the dishes were either a hit or a miss. He either nailed it, or it just...didn't work.

2010-06-25,2.0,"I went to Graham Elliot for family member's birthday.  First I have to say I was very suprised that they were unwilling to accomadate a reservation of 11 people, with out us booking a party room, and we would have a minimum purchase of $2500.  I thought this was insane considering it was a weeknight. I figured most resturants would be more than happy to have a bigger party as this brings in more revenue for them.  However this was not the case here, to top it off when we arrived the place was pretty much empty.  People didn't start coming in until we left.  Now for a resturant that charges an arm and a leg you would think that they would be a little more accomidating.  I was just a guest at the dinner, but if it was up to me I would have cancelled the reservation and took my business someplace else.  As far as the food, for starter I had the ceasar salad, which was not really all that.  It was pretty much pieces of lettuce with anchovies on top with a piece of bread on the side.  The bread was good, however I really didn't get to eat much of mine, as the waitress said that they are unable to give us an extra bread for my 8 year old  niece. I was really supprised by that, we were more than willing to pay for the piece of bread, but she said no we would have to order a whole $15 crappy salad, just to get a piece of bread.    Then I tried the pea soup, after reading all the great reviews on it. It was ok.  It was good, but there was something about it that you could only have a sip or two of. I can't put my finger on it but no one at the table was able to finish the soup. Which was kind of suprsing because the portions are fit for a mouse. The main dish was great. I had the chicken. It was awsome.  Everyone at the table pretty much devoured their dish.  However it was not the least bit filling.  Then on to desert.  I had the pineapple, which was blah... I don't think anyone was really blown away with the desert. I must admit that the busboys were very attentive, and our glasses were always full. Everytime a dish came the waitress did come and explain to everyone what everyrthing was, which was somewhat annoying as everything she told us was on the menu. Overall, I must admit for the amount we spent (about $1000) for a party of 8, I am deeply disappointed.  We could have easily went to another establishment and have been accomidated.  For that kind of price I think we should have left full and satisfied, which we were not. I really don't care what tv show the owner/chef was on, he needs a reality check. Hey  This is Chicago, the city of big shoulders, and real appitites.",0.9896,0.829,0.121,0.051,0.5258771929824559

The tuna was fresh, citrus infused and had clean, distinct flavors. The caesar was a great attempt at reinvention but the pea soup app stole the show with its creme freche marshmallow and warm, sweet broth. Then onto the curried duck satay and fish courses of halibut and sturgeon; a mix of sweet and salty fish with great morel mushroom and demi glace. The chicken was a precursor to the wagu beef and truffle puree..which was fantastic. The strawberry and lavender dessert topped the chocolate and salt caramel offering and to say the least we were not disappointed with anything.

2010-06-18,5.0,"I think the lesson you can take away from reading the reviews for Graham Elliot here on Yelp is that ""fine dining"" isn't for everyone.  I'm not sure how you can go to this place and get miffed that the portions aren't huge for what you pay.  I would think it's kind of expected.   That said, what I experienced so far exceeded my expectations; especially after being prepped for a 3-4 star experience by Yelp. I made a reservation on Open Table.  I can't recommend Open Table enough.  I've had nothing but good experiences with them. We were seated immediately and served the popcorn.  Our waitress was great.  She was the appropriate balance between service and explanation.  We started with cocktails.  My wife had the Anise in Wonderland, and I the Man-jito.  The Anise was excellent.  The Man-jito lacked something... it didn't taste any different than a regular mojito to me (certainly not any more manly...). We opened with the Asparagus terrine, and the Sweetbreads.  The Asparagus was electric.  The Sweetbreads were excellent.  I am a texture person, though, so I had a bit of trouble with that, but the taste was so good that the texture was easy to ignore. My wife them moved onto wine, and I moved onto the Whip, a whiskey cocktail that was stupendous. For the main dish, She had the whitefish, I the Heritage Pork. People: THE HERITAGE PORK AT GRAHAM ELLIOT IS WHY WE KILL PIGS.  I hate to put it that way, but damn.  For all I love about bacon, this pork trumps all. The whitefish was the polar opposite.  By that I mean the Pork was what made the pork dish.  Everything else, including the sweet potato waffle were but bit players on the plate.  The whitefish, as with all well-prepared fish, was largely flavorless, but the supporting players on that plate made the dish. We then moved onto dessert.  We both wanted the chocolate dessert, but I couldn't abide ordering 2 of the same thing, so we got a chocolate and a strawberry.  The strawberry dessert was sponge cake, strawberries, lavender, and sour cream.  It was excellent.  However, the chocolate dessert with its salted caramel, almond cookie and apricot jam nearly stole the whole show.  It was astounding. I added one more cocktail, a northbridge (gin, egg white, rosewater) that I wasn't crazy about. Now for the exceeding expectations part.  On OpenTable, I mentioned it was my anniversary.  The waitress came over with our bill and offered us a kitchen tour.   We got to tour the kitchen, get our questions answered by the chef de cuisine(!).  And, we saw Patton Oswalt at a table by the kitchen and as we were being led out of the kitchen, the waitress said, ""Graham Elliot is at the bar if you want to say hello or ask him any questions"".  Sure enough, there he was. We didn't take any of his time, but damn, they really opened the kimono for us.   The bill was $187 before tip.  Keep your own counsel as to whether or not it's worth it.  It's a hell of a dining experience (certainly a good dinner to commemorate our 10th wedding anniversary (sorry, ladies)), but if you're looking for big portions, imagine how far $187 will get two people at claim jumper (or at Old Country Buffet for that matter).",0.5579,0.833,0.084,0.083,0.5833436061801446

I enjoyed the presentation of the dishes, including the desert that looked as if it was balancing itself on the plate!  The beer list was different- which is a good thing. It also included a couple regular staples. Wines here are plenty, but by the glass, your selection is limited.   As for the place, we went on a weird night. The crowd was weird! We sat by a couple that was groping each other, that at one point, I thought the dude was about to ""finish"" with the help of his date.

2010-06-10,4.0,"*Belated review - actual visit was the weekend of 5/7/10* I set Graham Elliot in my sights soon after I found out we were heading to Chicago for a couple days of R&R, but I have to be honest, 1) I'd never heard of GE prior to seeing him on Bravo's Top Chef and 2) My first choice was actually Rick Bayless' Frontera Grill (booked). This dinner was our second night in Chicago, and since we'd had a wonderful experience at Blackbird the night before - my expectations were running quite high. The decor is cool with a nice color scheme (dark browns with pops of kelly green, mid-range/low lighting) and fun vibe - fairly loud music and chatter from other patrons.  We got seated at a booth/chair table near the front window. After some discussion with our friendly server, we decided on the tasting menu, adding on the drink pairing, and a starter of 'fois-lly'pops and cocktails.  While we waited, we munched on their addictive truffle popcorn - yum! 1) Fois-lly pops are a Willy Wonka-meets-haute-cuisine-ish  concoction of fois gras shaped into a circle, with watermelon Pop Rocks (remember those?!) around the edge, stuck onto a lollypop stick (see pic).  Whimsy at its best and delicious to boot. 2) Caesar salad w/mascarpone stuffed 'twinkie' brioche crouton, parmesan, a whole anchovy, paired with 2008 Brokenwood Semillon from Hunter Valley.  The flavor of the dressing was too subtle for me and the twinkie, although a creative and unique idea, was just good.  I was left wanting more (see pic). 3) Spring pea soup w/mint marshmallow, paired with Hitachino white ale from Japan. I loved this course. The soup was served from a beaker and poured on top of the mint marshmallow which slowly disintegrated into the soup, adding just the right amount of sweetness.  The beer pairing went perfectly with this dish. 4) Halibut with morels, fiddlehead, with a cabernet sauce, paired with 2008 Meinklang Pinot Noir from Burgenland.  I liked this halibut a lot, so much so that I missed taking a pic of it to share.  The morels were a great ingredient in this dish, very woodsy and lending a good texture contrast to the soft fish.  The pairing was well suited (mostly due to the morels I think). 5) Wagyu with sunchoke, watercress, pecorino, paired with 2006 La Spinneta Barbera from Piedmont.  Umm...'Please sir, I want some more' a la Oliver Twist.  Delectable. 6) Chocolate/almond/apricot/caramel, paired with a rare wine company serical Madeira from Portugal.  I will remember the flavor of the chocolate for some time, it was creamy but not soft and had a slight saltiness to it that went perfectly with the other ingredients on the plate.  I got a cute lil candle on the plate as this was an early birthday celebration dinner ^_^ Overall it was a delicious meal with well timed courses, great service, and perfect pairings (the beer/soup pairing was a nice surprise).  The portions are very small as you can tell in the pictures, but the flavors pack a big punch (except for the salad - I wanted more oomph and mascarpone). Thanks to the keepsake menu, I was able to note the above detail of each course. This tasting menu meal was the perfect precursor to the rest of our evening...which included Bin 36, Wiener's Circle, and White Castle...yes, as the night wore on and more alcohol was consumed, our culinary tastes went straight to Munchieville.",0.9992,0.784,0.207,0.009,0.5107032967032968

My dining companions also had the duck satay and the asparagus terrine- everyone loved their dishes. For the entree I had the Great Lake Whitefish - the chai foam with the fish was a great pairing. For dessert we shared the dark chocolate torte and were very happy with it as well. What I liked about the food here is that every bite had a unique combination of flavors, textures and temperature.

2010-06-04,1.0,"Hello, We visited Graham Elliott at the suggestion of my fiancee.   We entered the restaurant and were greeted at the host stand in a rather curt manner.  They asked us to leave by 7 PM because they had a reserved guest coming for restaurant week.  They redeemed themselves by seating us in a table for two by the window on a wonderful afternoon.  The atmosphere is energetic and the waitress was really hip and cool.  The service was outstanding.  Our water glasses were always filled. The silverware was changed at each course. The table was wiped down in between courses as well.   From the beginning, the prices seemed high for fine dining in a bistro atmosphere. As the meal progressed, my opinion of the place deteriorated.  We started with Foie Gras mousse loillpops coated in pop rocks.  They were overly salty and devoid of the flavor usually found with foie gras. The pop rocks actually saved the appetizer, but neither of us finished it. Our next entree was a cold beef carpaccio.  The presentation was awesome.  The appetizer consisted of four cracker sized portions of beef sliced lunch meat thin and placed on top of cream cheese (it may have been mozzarella but it lacked flavor).  I know that marbling of beef indicates extra flavor, but this ratio of fat was a little unappealing. We then had our hot appetizer, pan seared scallops.  The waitress did explain that these small plates were not meant for sharing.   Again, the presentation was incredible.  However, it is hard to taste an appetizer when one is served only two scallops. By comparison, if you order pan seared scallops at other restaurants in the area, there are usually 5-8 large scallops served.  They are prepared the same way, but the presentation isn't as good.  Personally, I prefer a little less eccentric presentations with more food of the same quality. When dinner came, the halibut was a 2 inch by 2 inch square.  Given the $31 price, we figured at the time we ordered that the plate would be large enough to share.  The last few times I was charged in this price range for halibut, it was for a decent size filet, presented elegantly with enough accouterments for sharing. It was also at restaurants (Morton's Roy's, Hugo's Frog Bar) that are at the same caliber Graham Elloitt claims to be minus the trendy atmosphere. As dessert came, I was dissatisfied, but not angry.  When it arrived and I saw that we paid $10 for two peeled strawberries, a half a scoops of melted lavender ice cream, and a few crumbles of angel food cake, I was mad.  The presentation was incredible, but I am not one who likes to pay $122 to eat the creation of someone playing with food. When the bill came, suffice it to say, I was livid.  A four ounce soda pop with ice was $3 per serving. Thus, I paid $6 for a can of Coke. I drank water through out the meal to keep my palate fresh and saved the coke for the end because 1) I limit alcohol to special occasions and 2) there was so little starch in the entrees that I actually began to feel dizzy.  I honestly felt ripped off. The portions were so small that I actually had to order a pizza later.

We also got the shashmi, the spring pea bisque w/ a marshmallow in the soup, and were all flat iron steak excellent.

This meal started out great: - sweet bread hushpuppys were great minus the fennel pollen, girlfriend loved the white tuna sashimi, scallops with brown butter were good. Almost forgot I had some foie gras lollipop with pop rocks on it. Super rich, but fun and only $5.  Then our entrees came.........hers - sturgeon filet. i thought it was really good, she liked it but said she would not order again. small portion.  mine - Wagyu beef flat iron. Not only was this a super small portion but its almost like the emphasized how small it was by putting it on the biggest white plate i've ever seen and putting the entire entree to a single far side of the plate. It looked like they forgot to put the rest of the dish on my plate.  Our server started so many of her sentences with ""Chef says...."" that my first thought was ""chef does not want me to leave here on a full stomach.""  After we got our first courses the meal was on schedule for 5 stars.....then the entrees came and left me almost mad that ""chef"" served us such small entrees.  The vibe in here is great. Big laugh of the night is when I asked our first server how a PBR could be the most expensive beer on the menu ($9)? He went off on a real funny tangent about how places are think they are being hip or cool by adding PBR to their menu so the chef wanted to make a statement by adding it to the menu with such a high price.  To sum up the review - I am sad that I chose this place as my last dinner in Chicago. We had to get a late night burrito from a tiny taco shop because of how unfulfilled we were. That should never happen after eating at a restaurant like this. I live in Southern California and my last meal in Chicago was a completely average carne asada burrito that I can get on any corner in my neighborhood.

This mad cap with crazy spectacles reminded me of my mad scientist chemistry teacher in 10th grade. The over prevalence of breakers (as decanters, soup serving 'bowls') only added to my suspicion that here is a gastronomy expert and we were in for a ride tonight. Waiting for our friends to arrive, we then sat down at the bar for some cocktails. I had the anise in wonderland (I've been on some sort of an anise craze lately) and my wife had some other sort of citrus goodness with a whipped egg-white to boot. When we got to our table, I was first impressed that every ingredient in the food were things that I truly enjoy to cook. I was a little saddened that we could not order the tasting menu (my wife, a pescetarian did not want the Wagyu beef) but we all seemed to order enough of the menu to get a feel for what Chef Bowles is trying to accomplish.  The meal, as always starts with his playful popcorn infused with  truffle oil and parmesan. As an homage to chicago, I ordered the caesar salad with the deep fried twinkie (a lovely fried Brioche infused with goat cheese).  My wife ordered the spring pea soup with a mint marshmallow that added a lot to the flavor. The wines we ordered were just as exciting as the food itself. From small batch wineries in Europe we picked out a nice bottle of white and red wines.  Onto the scallops- they were cooked to perfection with a lovely caramelized crust. Underneath these scallops was a lovely green bean and almond smoke. The flavors worked perfectly. It was gone in seconds. I then had the Wagyu beef. It was so tender, I did not need to chew it at all (not sure why they gave me such a manly knife). My wife's Halibut was again perfectly cooked and the morel and peppercorn dust made for a great dish. Desserts-what can I say- you can't go wrong with almonds, chocolate and apricots. The marzipan was lovely as was the little chunk of chocolate. Our friends had the strawberry and lavender ice cream/ chartreuse which was a lovely way to end the evening.

We had an early reservation because we made it last minute, but despite being pretty empty when we arrived, Graham Elliot had a great, funky, energetic atmosphere.  Good start! Our server came over and introduced herself, explained the menu a bit, and dropped off the popcorn that others have (rightly) raved about.  I was starting to wonder if we could order more, but then our appetizers arrived and I was distracted. Why?  I had the spring pea soup and OHMYGOD I want to eat it every day and bathe in it!  A great balance of sweet and salt, and the mint marshmallow added just enough mint to enhance the taste of the soup and not overwhelm it.  Must. Have. Again.  My companion had the beef carpaccio which was pretty stellar on its own, but came with a horseradish custard type thing that was pretty much to die for. As my entree, I had the wagyu flat iron beef, which was lovely.  I'm glad our server warned me against getting it medium well (it's lean and can get tough) - it was still plenty cooked for me, and the consistency was perfect.  My companion had some sort of fish - I'm very allergic, so I tune all information about seafood out, so I can't tell you what it was, only that he said it was phenomenal. We went sort of opposites on dessert - one of us went for chocolate, the other for pineapple.  They were very, very different, but pitch perfect.  The whole night was a great experience!

Then when I said I wanted it to be dry (absence of vermouth) he sat there and explained to me what that meant. Yeah, I know Captain Obvious. Is it me, or is it easier to say ""dry"" as opposed to ""please leave out the vermouth"" I felt like I was being judged for not ordering his way.

We sat at the bar and drank and ate like royalty! I started off with the Smoke Monster-the only lackluster part of the night.

The atmosphere is pretty laid back while giving the appearance of a nicer restaurant. Probably more a commentary on the friendly staff and their easy-going approach, which are always welcome.  As for dinner, the portions and shorter menu were done well. I had the Waygu beef which was decent and prepared expertly. Not the greatest steak ever, but served with a potato confit and a foie consomme that went together smoothly. Well balanced, and not a massive honkin' plate to stuff you before attempting dessert. Wifey enjoyed the white fish (local-ish from Michigan I think?), which is a new addition to their Spring menu apparently. Had a bite, thumbs up if you can still find it. One thing that fell flat in our humble opinion were the foie gras lollipops with pop rocks, a 'signature app' that our waiter recommended. I tried to come up with an analogy, but the closest thing I landed on was imagine a half stick of butter sprinkled with crunchy candy. The fat delivery system was served cold, and was too rich in a couple of bites to really enjoy. Think I had a minor coronary after my second bite, which if it had tasted good may have been OK. I vote 'pass' on that science experiment. The saving grace was naturally the popcorn, which on our night was a truffled variety. Ours was tapdancing in truffle oil and shavings - really, really good. Almost forgot the drinkity-drinks. Before dinner, I tried the Smoke Monster, which lived up its name. Nice Dharma reference, can't go wrong there.

My husband and I both did the five course tasting menu. Between the two of us we tried the caesar salad, macaroni, bisque, scallops, beef, chicken, and chocolate dessert. The caesar salad was the perfect opening note to our meal - I especially loved the brioche crouton. The macaroni was perfectly cooked and had a great flavor due to the truffle oil in it. The bisque was simply delicious - it had different flavors depending on if you got a bite with marshmellow or potato skin. The scallops were definitely the highlight of the meal for both my husband and I. They truly melted in my mouth, which is the sign of a perfectly cooked scallop to me. My husband loved the beef dish and didn't even give me time to sample a bite. My chicken was perfectly cooked - the little cake that came with it was a great side and I loved the almond sauce that I swirled my chicken in. The chocolate dessert with Guinness ice cream was a great way to close the meal. I am glad the dessert was so small because the chocolate was a bit rich for my taste, but then again I am not really a chocolate eater. We sampled four cocktails during our two hours at Graham Elliot - the Summertime, Rapper's Delight, Wine and Roses, and Grapes of Wrath. My favorite was the Wine and Roses and my husband loved the Rapper's Delight. The cocktail menu is very inventive and it was hard to pick because they all sounded so interesting and unique. Prices were definitely on par for the experience and quality of food - our bill was $202 before tip which is exactly what we estimated we were going to pay. If you are looking for a great, trendy, unique, and modern fine dining experience, I highly recommend checking out Graham Elliot.",0.9979,0.782,0.21,0.007,0.7135507246376811
2010-04-04,5.0,"Had an outstanding dining experience here last night. Between my wife and I, we tried the Bisque, Macaroni, Risotto, Scallops, Beef, Chocolate, and Pear. The Risotto was just OK, but everything else was so delicious. The vibe of the place is very cool and they had some outstanding local craft beers as well as good cocktails. Yes, the portions were somewhat small, but the prices didn't seem all too high. Some of the dishes seemed to be on a completely different level of complexity from anything I had had before. The pear dessert kind of scared us at first because it was served and there were two pieces of blue cheese gelato, some pear slices, and a bunch of lettuce. Each on their own, they were a terrible dessert. Yet somehow when you put them all together they tasted awesome and ran through multiple flavors lingering in your mouth. It was amazing. I usually hate mushrooms, but the macaroni had them in it and it tasted great. The beef was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  For 3 starters, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, 3 cocktails, and 2 beers, it was about $205 with tax and tip. We heard the spring menu would be debuting soon and want to go back already! I also read that GEB is opening up a sandwich shop sometime in spring so that sounds exciting as well. Great experience.",0.9936,0.725,0.218,0.057,0.6139583333333334

2010-04-01,3.0,"The presentation was exquisite.  Definitely as promised; progressive yet traditional, upscale yet casual.  But when it's all said and done, form must always follow function.  And Graham Elliot just tries too hard... Here's the breakdown: 1)  The carpaccio is a little too much with the saltiness of the meat (just not as naturally flavorful as I would like) but still delicious when complemented by the sweetness of the sauce/reduction. The piece of cheese underneath might be unnecessary but good nonetheless.  2)  The bisque, trust me, is worth getting seconds.  Fresh bacon, fingerling potato that's an explosion of deliciousness in your mouth, and a marshmallow (yup, that's not a typo) all in a creamy potato bisque? Pure awesomeness.   3)  Duck was slightly overcooked but went well with the complementing sides.  The texture reminds me of traditional carnitas (not the Chipotle kind, ew). 4)  Risotto has a lot of seafood essence to it; mussels, fried calamari, if you like that sort of thing.  I prefer a more traditional risotto with more infused flavor and creaminess.  But there was one thing, a little fried orange slice or something, it was chewy and tart and slightly sweet, very interesting...   5)  The beef entree is somewhat French traditional with a foie gras twist, which is always a nice little surprise. Comes over a baby carrot puree which, by the way, I didn't realize how much I loved baby carrots until I tried this.    6)  I'm not usually a fan of lamb but it's not so lamb-y, which is a good thing. It was chewy but the puree underneath is also, as expected, creamy goodness. 7)  Carrot cake is a good balance between traditional and progressive flavors.  All the traditional flavors you'd expect is there, but it's deconstructed. 8)  The chocolate ganache is rich and delicious but a little bitter.  Probably a sign a higher quality cocoa? Idk, it was chocolate. All in all, the decor and service is on par with four star's around the city.  Where it loses it's touch, though, is when the food just doesn't meet the same high of standards.  The overall flavor was just mediocre and for the price and experience, this spot isn't worth a revisit.",0.9975,0.769,0.207,0.025,0.566808510638298

2010-03-28,3.0,"Hubs and I went here for my birthday dinner and were sorely disappointed. Here's a breakdown: Ambiance -  Lovely decor, lovely lounge area. Great music (alternating Shins and Postal Service, among others).The ""party-of-2"" seating area made me feel like a sardine. I know, I know...lots of places are like this. But this was tighter than any place I've been. I didn't appreciate the older woman sitting next to me coughing and blowing her nose in my direction. Whatevs...I can deal with that. Service -  In the lounge area = speedy and friendly. In the dining area, our waitress was awful. Just plain awful.  Aside from the occasional smile, she barely gave us the time of day and at times was downright rude. We were left waiting numerous times (between finishing our meal, getting our check and leaving, it had to be a 25+ minute wait). We had to wait at least 10 minutes to order dessert. Funny thing - the table right next to us was getting superb service from her.  OH...and trying to track down someone to refill my water glass was ridiculous. We were 3/4 of the way through our meal before anyone stopped to give us water (and it was the only thing I was drinking). Food - So...here's the deal. We kinda expected a bit more molecular gastronomy. Not so much. Fine, whatever. My favorite dishes were definitely the appetizers and desserts. We had to-die-for potato bisque with a surprisingly tasty marshmallow foam and very rich mac-n-cheese for apps. My dessert of the pear and frisee with Gorgonzola ice cream was dreamy. The rest of the meal was disappointing. The popcorn 'bread service,' while very flavorful, was cold and a stale. Bummer. For the main entree, I got the Wagyu beef. The beef itself was fall-apart-amazing and the foie consomme was very tasty. The rest of the dish did not mesh with my palate. The root vegetables were strangely flavored and really turned me off. I could barely eat them. The hubs' dish (the pork) was good but he wasn't blown away. So...overall...would we go again? Probably not. The service was pretty wretched and while the apps and desserts were tasty, the entrees themselves weren't worth it.",0.9261,0.855,0.092,0.053,0.5232188999630861
2010-03-28,5.0,"Overall great experience, great food, loved everything.  First let me just say I love the popcorn/bread coarse, as others said the popcorn came out slightly cold, but the flavor more than made up for it.  apps Beets - great salad, when you got a bite of everything together (the marmalade was a little bit overpowering,  but as long as you got only a little bit in each bite it really brightened the dish)  Duck - good, not especially memorable, but I cant think of any complaints about the dish Mains Chicken - Recommended by the waiter, good and really fun, the foot beer bbq sauce was great and the greens and grit cake went perfectly with the chicken. chicken was also cooked well.  Beef - Beef was fall apart tender, melt in your mouth goodness. the Foie Consomme also added this great flavor to everything.  the little slices of confit potatoes underneath everything were ridiculously good.  Scallops - Perfectly cooked, perfectly seared evenly on both sides, beautiful color on all of them, and they tasted really fresh. everything else on the dish went really well with the scallops without overpowering them.  dessert Chocolate - really beautiful and fun dessert. extra points for the chocolate covered pop rocks.  everything else we went there on an Wednesday night so it wasn't too busy, we found street parking on the same block. wait staff was really nice and attentive. atmosphere was great (its hard not to like a ""fine dining"" place that plays Sufjan Stevens and Jimmy Eat World) 2 apps, 3 mains, and one dessert came out to about $160",0.9985,0.64,0.312,0.048,0.6202380952380951
2010-03-28,3.0,"If I was to rate this place purely based on the overall experience, it would be 5 stars because it was a really fun night. We took an out of town friend here based on a suggestion from a friend so it was a first time for all four of us.  Our waiter was awesome - he was super friendly, very knowledgeable and dare I say, a rather entertaining fellow. He suggested that we all try the tasting menu to fully experience the menu as Chef Bowles intended it, so we took his advice.  This restaurant is definitely meat-centric, so we were very intrigued to see what they would produce for a group consisting of 2 meat eaters,1 total vegetarian, and 1 pescatarian.  Ironically, the pescatarian (me) and the vegetarian left the happiest. I wouldn't say that many of the dishes were *truly* mind blowing, but the fish main course that I had was exceptionally prepared. My meat eating companions did seem somewhat disappointed by their beef though.  Our out of town friend was a chef from the Philippines, so we asked if they would allow us to see the kitchen for her benefit, and since it was a slow night, they obliged. That was really one of the highlights of the experience also - it was a gorgeous, immaculate kitchen and all the guys working back there were very nice and humored all of our questions, etc.  Now, I am really not one to comment on price very often as I know that all good things usually come at a price. But, I really felt like this bill here was a little bit over the top, considering the food and very casual atmosphere. We only had 1 bottle of wine between us + 1 glass (I'm the lush) and the bill for 4 people + tip was about $550.  I'm not sorry I went here, but I'm not sure that I'd return. There are more intriguing food experiences to be had for this price, but the service is great and it's probably worth a try if you have the $$$$ just based on the ""fun factor"" at least.",0.9963,0.793,0.191,0.016,0.4980555555555554
2010-03-21,5.0,"Graham Elliot lives up to the hype!  I had a great date night on a Friday.  I was surprised at how easy it was to make reservations through OpenTable last minute. Easy parking in the vicinity.  When we got there, the atmosphere was just right.  Definitely not empty, plenty of people sitting at the bar, dining space was maybe 3/4 full. Decor I liked Graham Elliot as soon as I stepped in.  As Kevin T mentioned, it's looks a lot like how you might want to decorate your own loft.  Trendy, fashion-forward, subtle and not in your face, yet oozes the vibe that you're in a fine dining establishment. Service We were greeted nicely at the door.  The menu was simple, yet hard to understand at the same time so I tested our server.  He was very knowledgeable, both in terms of knowing the beer selection and explaining how each dish was prepared.  My water glass was never less than half full, food was brought out in the right order in appropriate intervals, and the preparation of each dish was explained as it arrived.  We were even offered a second popcorn with white truffle oil.  Fantastic service. Food Why is it that beet salad always comes with blue/goat cheese? I'm not a fan...but their salad was still good.  Their seafood risotto was off the hook though.  Prepared bouillabaisse style, it had a fishy taste to it (stock), but in a good way.  The calamari was perfectly battered very light with a thin fried shell, and there were some nice chunks of fish. My gf opted for the sea bass, which was tender but definitely pedestrian next to the lamb that I got.  Leg of lamb...chopped!  From the presentation, it was prepared the way duck is usually served.  The pieces were carefully placed over a batter of whipped potatoes and sausage.  I left Graham Elliot a happy man, and didn't have to sell any organs to pay for it.  Entrees were all ~$30, appetizers ~$10, with beers for $6 and cocktails in the $11 range.  It's not cheap, but you definitely get what you pay for.  Awesome experience.",0.9944,0.822,0.167,0.012,0.5656256921373201

2010-03-08,1.0,"In a word: no.  Went there on Saturday night and was disappointed on three different levels: 1) The food just wasn't that interesting.  We tried the tasting menu, which is usually the chef putting his best foot forward.  Too bad for him.  We knew that the portions would be small, so we even ordered some extra dishes to supplement the tasting menu - more on that later.  The Caesar salad was nothing special, and potato bisque was decent but it's not something that you couldn't have a million other places; the scallops themselves were fine but the almond paste was way too overpowering, and beef was actually quite good, and the chocolate dessert was too salty for my taste and the guiness ice cream going annoying after the first bite.  We also had the risotto (horrible and overcooked) and the mac n' cheese, which was something I could make at home - save for the unnecessary truffle foam.  We were waiting the whole time for it to get good, and it was just nothing special.  And the drinks were watered down and tasteless. 2) I get that this is supposed to be a tasting at a fine restaurant and if you want a huge bowl of pasta or a whole slab of ribs then go to a chain family restaurant - I get it.  But the portion sizes were ridiculous.  I kid you not - the caesar salad (tasting menu, remember) lettuce leaf - note the singular on ""leaf"" - was the size of my thumb.  The entire time we were eating, we were hoping that the portions would get just a little larger so that we wouldn't have to stop for more food on the way home.  We even added two dishes to the $70 tasting menu.  No such luck, and then the worst happened.... 3) They served my friend her beef and literally have of it was fat.  Remember that the ""regular"" beef that we had was only 5-6 bites to begin with, so her losing those three bites was upsetting.  And the beef was honestly the bright spot in the entire meal.  We were so hungry and disappointed that we politely pointed out to our server that we had been served a portion that was too fatty.  He honestly had no idea what to do.  We just asked if she could have another piece and he said he'd have to check.  He came back and said ""that's the way it is"" and instead offered to give us free dessert wine. (??)  I'm not sure in what language beef = port, but whatever. We had gone for my friend's birthday, and needless to say, I was embarrassed.  The whole thing was a joke and I think this restaurant is a little full of themselves.  I can deal with the snobby attitude on the portion sizes and even the ""we serve fatty beef"" response, but then the flavors better be damn good.  And they simply weren't. Over spending $400 on three people, we had to head down the street to Elate to finish up dinner.  We spent 1/8 at Elate that we did at Graham Elliot and we were fed, had good drinks, and a wonderful server who had a great attitude.  We should have gone to Elate for the entire meal...",0.9851,0.781,0.131,0.088,0.566837606837607

He told us we had to from one or the other.  Even more disappointing, I only heard about the foie gras pops when he told the other table.  The restaurant presents it's self as an elite high end establishment, promoting a name chef.  Everywhere you look, are his initials. They even sell GE belt buckles.  However, when the food is that much of a let down, it's pretentious and cocky.  I would much rather go to Sepia or Fontera Grill.",0.4228,0.874,0.07,0.056,0.5330718954248366

Uh, thanks? Their beef tartare - served italian beef style - was the best dish of the night.  It was very flavorful and all the tastes fit well together.  The scallops were also cooked very well.  Tonight was the last night of the fall/winter menu, so whoever goes after this will get to experience a new menu.  The London Calling pimm's cocktail with cucumber soda was tasty.  Presentation is impressive, but in the end falls short of amazing.  We probably won't be back...",0.9891,0.721,0.248,0.03,0.46422176308539953

I had beet salad w/horseradish foam and picked pear - lovely light combination of bitter, sweet, and sour.  My guest had gingerbread sweetbreads - sounds odd but is truly delicious - light, sweet, and very intriguing.  Deconstructed beef stroganoff - wonderful rare beef with rich mushroom spread and yummy, just slightly crispy spaetzle - perfect for a 10 degree evening. The wait staff is pleasant and well informed.  Always with good wine recommendations, terrific knowledge of an admittedly challenging menu, and classy but not stuffy service.  The room is lively but not obnoxiously loud - this is a restaurant for grown-ups, not the post collegiate set.  It's a fun restaurant with a unique menu of innovative comfort food (and beyond) that always keeps me excited with the new possibilities.  I will come back here again and again.",0.9984,0.66,0.319,0.021,0.6514581714581713

The servers wear brown shirts (a coincidence that that is my favorite color methinks no) with matching belt buckles and jeans. It is nice to feel relaxed when you are about to break trail on a fantastic gastronomic journey.  The libations sadly were not as good as what I have experienced at the Bristol but 'Ruby Slippers' is worth trying. 'Some Like It Hot' ehhh not so much.  To begin we tried the beet salad -- super yum and I don't really like the root. We had the cheddar cheese risotto -- tasty, the apples really made this interesting.  For entrees my dad had the Beef Stroganoff -- that was a loin of kobe cooked to perfection. His dish was an 'A' in my book. My mom had the Colorado lamb with smoked tomatoes. She was a little disappointed in how smoky the tomatoes were -- she gave it a 'C' in comparison to the rest but I reserve the right to grade her dish at a 'B+'. I had the Pumpernickel Sturgeon. I told the server that it was the fanciest reuben I have had in my life. That's what it reminded me of...caraway seeds, sauerkraut jus. Grade: out of this world!! Skip some grades Graham Elliot, you graduated early!  I loved the individual french presses for coffee complete with a sand 'minute glass' timer.

Just a little! But the last time i went the popcorn didn't seem just as fresh, and the menu had changed. Pork on a bone thingy was gone, replaced with another pork dish.

We asked our server to pair wines with our courses because I was too lazy to look at the wine menu and she seemed to know what she was talking about.  She did an excellent job!  The wine she poured was only $10 a glass and matched the courses perfectly.   My arctic char was surprisingly robust.  I was expecting a small fish portion, but the slab of fish took up most of the plate.  I am not a scallops fan, but I was told that they were also very good.

The pork belly was a good solid dish.  I think the popcorn had a little too much truffle- I think it would have been better if it was more subtle.  It was also pretty loud and somewhat difficult to talk- I did enjoy the modern music selection.  I totally loved rocking the Cure songs.  Also had a nice wine selection.    Overall it was a good solid meal that I can't find much to fault.  I may not go back just because there are so many better restaurants in Chi town and there was nothing there that really amazed me.  But then again since its a seasonal menu maybe I'll try again in the spring.   Just a good solid meal and a nice atmosphere.,0.9945,0.646,0.318,0.035,0.4948275862068965
2009-12-30,4.0,"A rare thing happened: I made a mistake.  I made a reservation at Graham Elliot on a Tuesday, and then arrived with my party of 4 on Wed, precisely 24 hours late.  Luckily, the very gracious host was able to seat us right away in any case.  But I felt that I owed GE. The popcorn has been discussed- obviously great.  I typically get annoyed by the overuse of truffle oil, but it was appropriate here. I started with the heirloom beets, accompanied by hazelnuts, pickled pears and horseradish foam.  The beets were excellent and everything on the plate complemented them.  Presentation (as with all of the dishes) was excellent.  I also tried the chestnut bisque, which was delicious, though almost too sweet for my taste. GE got back at me for my missed reservation during the entree portion.  I ordered the arctic char but received the chicken dish. But I like how he serves revenge: Upon informing the waitstaff of the mistake, they couldn't have been more gracious and apologetic.  I received the char a few minutes later - it was really really excellent - and got dessert on the house.  In the end it wasn't a big deal and I got a free desert.  The caramel apple desert with peanuts and apple foam was, for this non-dessert person, a lot of fun.  The caramel and peanuts seemed to pop off the plate and the apples (sous vide?) were of perfect tenderness.  The apple foam was nice, but superfluous.

2009-12-19,5.0,"I have been wanting to go to Graham Elliot for about a year now--and that desire has been particularly acute since we stopped in for cocktails over the summer... The truffle parmesan popcorn was fantastic, as were the cocktails. Our waiter helped us pick out a series of dishes, and we put the drink pairings into his hands. We started with the Italian beef tartare and the beet salad, which was paired with a nice rosé.  Monica loved the beet salad, I thought it was just okay (there was kind of a cloying top note that bothered me, but I couldn't put my finger on what it was).  I thought the beef tartare was awesome.  It was served on a little roll with finely chopped giardiniera and provolone foam.  There was some sort of red pepper sauce too, and it all worked together fantastically.  The rosé paired nicely with both dishes. Our hot courses were risotto and duck confit ravioli.  The waiter paired the duck with a madeira and the risotto with a hard cider.  The risotto was an homage to Wisconsin--cheddar cheese, artesian sausage, apples and Cheez-Its.  Rich and creamy and perfect.  And the cider took the whole thing to the next level.  This was a superb dish.  The duck confit ravioli, however, was nothing short of spectacular.  The raviolis were steamed then baked?  And they were topped with some blanched greens and pomegranate seeds and accompanied with a pomegranate sauce.  Now, when this was served I must admit that I thought ""sigh, pomegranate seeds are so 2008.""  Well, pomegranate like this exists outside of what happens to be popular at the moment.  Transcends it, in fact.  There were so many rich and varied textures and the tastes were well matched.  This has to be one of the best single dishes I have ever had in my life.  Fantastic. Our main courses came with a black beer.  Again, it worked well.  We had the lamb and pork belly (Yeah.  Again.).  The lamb was excellent--flavorful and exquisitely cooked.  It was served with chickpeas.  The dish was again complicated, but whimsical and well rounded.  I really liked the pork belly.  It's funny, though I enjoyed the pork belly at Kith and Kin and at Publican more, the Graham Elliot pork belly had a completely different taste and was a much more complete dish.  It came served with a root beer barbecue sauce.  It was cooked sous vide and then seared--which resulted in a crispy outside and a buttery inside.  Very good. The waiter comped us a couple of glasses of sparkling wine, and talked us into a dessert--some sort of pumpkin spice cake.  Excellent. Graham Elliot was better than I expected it to be (and I had pretty high expectations).  And, to be honest, you'd be hard pressed to find such fantastic food in such a fun place.",0.999,0.764,0.224,0.012,0.6242597402597402

We had a bit of a hiccup, they kind of forgot about us, but otherwise the service was amazing. We gave our waiter pretty much carte blanche on wine selection, and he passed that little test with flying colors, I really appreciate that our waiter had the chance to pad the bill and didn't. Not only did our wine open up and pair differently with each course it was a really delicious wine at a really reasonable price. Also! You don't have to have a few hundred dollars in your pocket to have a beautiful dinner here. The stroganoff dish I had was probably about $30 as an entrée, and it paired perfectly with the $11 cab our waiter recommended to go with it.

2009-12-15,4.0,"""I think this popcorn is coated with COCAINE,"" says Kristin M. as I reseat myself at our sleek table at ultra-sleek Graham Elliot. Indeed. And if by cocaine, you mean parmesan, chives, sea salt, black pepper, and other spice goodness, then YES. Cocaine. Crack. Don't want to stop eating it. Graham Elliot would have been a five star experience if it had only consisted of a cool waiter continually bringing us baskets upon baskets of this stuff. Other things that were five star-worthy: the London Calling, a fantastically drinkable mix of plymouth gin, ginger water, apple syrup, and cucumber soda. Light, yet strong with unique elements, this cocktail is a winner. The Beef  stroganoff--oh.my .lord. This ain't your typical old, heavy stroganoff. It's been deconstructed to a certain extent--shallot compote and sour cream at the bottom of the heap, with a layer of chanterelle mushrooms, a layer of peppered spaetzle, topped with slices of lovely medium rare, tender-as-can-be beef. I could eat it ALLLLL day long every day. Four star worthy: our starters. The cheddar risotto (bratwurst, chives, cheese, and cheez-its!) and chesnut bisque (it's like dessert soup!) were solid choices that we were very pleased to taste. Our server was super cool, very attentive, and we could tell he was enjoying chatting with us. We like attention! Less-than-desirable: the Some-Like-It-Hot. There was weird clear SPICY jelly at the bottom of the martini glass, and Kristin M. does NOT do spicy. ""I don't think you're ready for this jelly..."" Also, the bussers tried to serve us TWO, count 'em, TWO dishes that we didn't order! We were like, uh, nope! Sorry, not here. We'll take it! But not here. Also, the caramel apple dessert was too complex. I either wanted it to be a taffy apple or a slice of apple pie, and it was really trying to be both. Not quite. So, in Yelp Math, this experience equals 4 stars. Maybe four and a half for the caramel corn they tried to send us away with--and I still swear, that it tastes like BACON!

The waiters were knowledgeable but not intimidating, with their converse sneakers and hipster haircuts.

2009-12-08,5.0,"Our extremely generous Chicago hosts treated us to a fantastic dinner here; we never would have ventured into the land of $12 cocktails and deconstructed beef stroganoff without their assurances that it would be worth the plunge.  GE's mixologist started us off with unique and flavorful cocktails. I'd love to be able to make her London Calling at home but would probably drown in a pitcher of it; I wouldn't mind if that were my last drink on earth or my first drink wherever I end up after that.  Our apps were the traditional, nontraditional GE fare. My fave was the chestnut bisque; so many layers of flavor that changed with the melting of the marshmallow. I ecstatically savored the pork belly and grit entree which evoked wonderful gastro-emotional memories of my first bacon wrapped scallop. Their are some some experiences you can never recapture in life: first kiss, first dirty martini, first bacon wrapped scallops accompanied by dirty martinis and then lots of kissing and now GE's pork belly. Holy crap!  And the beef stroganoff was a perfect dish. I don't remember the cut of meat but it was worth the price and more. If I knew that every bite of the pricey tasting menu would meet the expectations created by these entrees, I'd gladly fly back for a visit just for that meal.  This is not my regular type of restaurant. I'd probably show up if they had happy hour prices and if we lived in Chicago, but wouldn't pay the regular prices unless it was a super-special occasion. But I am glad to know GE is out there, forever reforming his menu to keep those of us who consider ourselves home chefs humble.  We ended with the chocolate torte. It looked pretty on the plate but had sounded kinda typical for a nice restaurant in the menu description. I actually thought it looked dry and consciously decided to finish it to avoid insulting our generous hosts. Then after one bite, the forks began to duel over equal shares. There was enough for 2 to share but I sure as hell didn't want my husband to get even an extra bite in. My host reiterated his GE/fine food mantra for a fifth time that meal: ""I don't share!"" He obviously learned that lesson long ago watching bitterly as scrumptious GE bites left his plate.  The service was also fantastic; the GM repeatedly checked on us and all the other diners, unobtrusively stepping in if guests seemed to have questions about the menu or if glasses were empty. The waitstaff was well-versed on the menu items and gave some great suggestions.  The only thing that would have made this experience better would have been an appearance by the chef. He walked through the dining room once, leaving us hoping he'd return to let us thank him for the incredible dinner. Instead, he disappeared into the kitchen never to emerge. I'd seen him on Top Chef Masters and loved his personality. If he's anything like that in person, then I missed a big part of the GE experience. Honestly, if that funny, down to earth guy on tv showed up table side, I'd go back to the restaurant repeatedly.

2009-12-02,5.0,"Congratulations Graham Elliot, welcome to my Top 3 Restaurants in the city of Chicago. Love this place.  I came here the other night for about the 7th time this calendar year.  I would have given this place 5 stars back in May when I first came here, but I've been busy.  Why do I keep coming back you ask?  Because it's that good.  Let's look at the Top 3 things I like about  this restaurant: 1) The atmoshphere.  Cool location, an energetic vibe, and super warm and knowledgeable staff.  They aren't too pushy, and they get a feel for you and the group that you're with rather quickly. They always pop up at the right time in a conversation, and they know their wines up and down, side to side.  These guys must go through 6 months of training before actually being assigned their first table. Some  of the best in the buinsess.   2) Versatility.  Over the past year I've met up here with Friends from college I hadn't seen in years, dates with girls who weren't worthy of a  Graham Elliot type evening, but were able to walk out all the better for it when it was all said and done, business dinners, and a party.  You can bring family members here when you are looking for a place to take them for the night when they come to visit. Feel free to suggest to your boss to talk Q4 strategy here. This place has got your back, no matter what you have going on. 3) Staying power.  This place will be here for a long time. This won't be a big city restaurant that is hot for 18 months to a year and then flames out as being a place that is no longer hip to go to because ""only tourists like that place.""  That to me is a sign of a top notch restaurant. I knew it the second I first stepped foot in it.  As far as food goes, it is excellent, top-notch! I've had everything on the menu, as it changes every now and then. It's all fantastic.   The menu is unique in that it offers dishes that combine several foods you wouldn't expect to be grouped together. For example, ""The Wisconsin Cheddar Risotto""  which consists of green apples, glazed onions, bacon, and cheez-its.   Just writing about it I can still taste it now. It is surprisingly delicious and all of their dishes follow suit.  If you want to change things up a bit and try a new  place and Graham Elliot is one of your options, you can't go wrong, I promise.  Enjoy!",0.9976,0.79,0.187,0.023,0.5110181176847843

After seeing Graham on Top Chef masters I was even more intrigued and I was on the edge of my seat all day waiting for dinner time! Nothing disappointed here at all, it was fabulous.  There were three of us dining and we each had a drink, an appetizer and an entree plus two desserts and two coffees. Drinks were great all around, they had a good selection. My sister wound up getting a dirty martini but said it was perfectly done. My mom had a martini with some sort of pear liquor that isn't on the website but was on tonights menu. I had the London Calling and it was so much better than I had expected it to be! The popcorn on the table was fun, tonight it was drizzled with truffle oil and sprinkled with parmesan, chives and pepper. I loved snacking on it when I was perusing the menu.  Appetizers consisted of the following: Roasted Baby Beets--amazing. The horseradish foam and the pickled pears combined with the roasted beets, goat cheese and micro arugula was delicious! I think I stole more than my fair share of bites off my mom's plate and I don't really like beets...at all.  Wisconsin Cheddar Risotto-delicious. My sister can be a fairly picky eater so I was thrilled that she agreed to come to dinner and even happier that she wanted to lick her plates(s) clean. The risotto tonight had bratwurst instead of bacon and it was so good! I loved the combination of cheddar and apples plus the smokiness of the brats. She ate it very quickly so I was only able to swoop in for one bite but by the looks of things it was a winner. Sweet Potato Bisque--Awesome! This was right up my alley of tastes and I couldn't wait to try the homemade marshmallow plus it was such a chilly night that bisque was the perfect thing to try. The corn nuts added a nice crunch and swirling the melting garlic marshmallow into the soup gave it a pretty look but also made it taste so good! There was a chipotle jam in there as well and while I'm the last person who wants any extra spice it went so well together I dealt with the slight heat that was trickling down my throat. My sister also enjoyed it and ate a few spoonfuls and she isn't one for sweet potatoes.  Arctic Char Fillet--very good! Mom cleaned her plate and didn't have much to say aside from the turnip bits were overly salty. I'm pretty sure that was the only downside comment of the night. The brussel sprout bed sprinkled with bacon rocked and gave the plate a nice pop of color.  Wagyu Beef Stroganoff--YUM! Again I have to say that my sister is picky and once again wiped her plate clean. She didn't even say anything about the meat being on the pink side because it was so good! I did manage to grab a bite and the meat was perfectly tender and the peppercorn sauce was perfect. Glazed Pork Belly--Delicious! My pork belly was so tender it was falling apart while I cut into it. It melted in my mouth and was perfect with the dandelion greens and the butternut squash. I savored every bite and even parted with two so my mom and sister could try it. We all loved it! I wanted more when my plate was clean! While the dessert menu didn't scream to me I knew I had to try something so I went with the Caramel Heirloom Apple while my sister had the Pumpkin Pound Cake. The apple one was delicious, the salty carmel on the plate was calling to be licked right off but I was pretty sure I'd get some strange looks if I did that so I scraped off as much as I could. The pound cake was the lightest poundcake I've ever had and was so yummy I could have enjoyed more! The foams on both were a perfect accompaniment.  Needless to say I LOVED this place and would highly recommend it to most people.",0.9995,0.747,0.224,0.028,0.6490918367346938

2009-10-26,4.0,"Within minutes of arriving into Chicago on a rainy, cold, and late Thursday night, BrianQ and I knew we'd be fiending a delicious and satisfying meal at an upscale joint, not too far from our downtown hotel. Refusing to settle on the first thing we stumbled upon, a little research prior to arrival led us to make a reservation at Graham Elliot. After GE's appearance on Top Chef Masters, I was excited to see what his self proclaimed ""bistronomic"" restaurant concept was all about and try a bite at his quirky food combinations. We were seated immediately and served his infamous truffle popcorn; regular popcorn lightly tossed in truffle oil, pepper, and Parmesan cheese, in place of the classic bread/butter combo. I don't even like popcorn, but could not stop munching on this stuff. Twas excellent, but be forewarned - just like Orville Redenbacher's version, that of GE will work up a thirst. Not to worry though; the cocktail, beer, and wine selection at GE looked pretty solid. While I didn't try any of the cocktails, the house mixologist put together a pretty impressive and unique menu of drinks, including one with potato and cream cheese in it! (albeit $11-15). We started our meal with 2 appetizers. Being that I'm a huge risotto fan and an even huger cheese-o-holic, it was clear that the marriage of both would create my adopted lovechild, an obvious first choice appetizer; cheesy risotto with caramelized onions and bacon. We decided our second appetizer, duck confit agnolotti, with much less certainty, but dived in anyway because the ingredients (duck, gorgonzola, fresh made pasta, port reduction, kale) sounded great alone. Ironically and unexpectedly, I have to say that I was turned off by the risotto, but licking the plate of the duck confit. The risotto was primarily flawed due to excess....bacon. I was overwhelmed the in-your-face flavor and 1 cm cubes of pork mixed in with an otherwise texturally sound classic. Yes, there can be too much of a good thing, and this was definitely a prime example. I did appreciate GE's use of apple chunks, pearl onions, and cheez-it's in it though, as each of those somehow enhanced the texture and created a favorable taste contrast. The duck confit was wonderful. The duck was perfectly cooked and fatty for my taste; the homemade pasta tasted fresh and light and the gorgonzola offset the sweet port sauce nicely. A great, well-rounded starter.  Similar to our appetizer selection, when deciding entrees, our first choice, grilled Colorado lamb, was a no brainer, whereas our second choice, deconstructed beef stroganoff, came to us after much deliberation. And similar to our appetizer experience,  I was turned off by the lamb but begging for seconds of the beef and licking the plate clean. The lamb was cooked very well and quite pretty to look at, but the accompaniments and sauce had no place on the plate. I get that GE was trying to go for contrast, bold flavors, and wild combinations when he paired the lamb with cracked wheat and Clementine marmalade, but, no. The Clementine marmalade was far too tart; at first taste, I puckered my entire face (documented by BrianQ). The cracked wheat was okay, but added nothing for me. The endive was awkward on the plate, hard to cut, and kind of bland. Now onto the highlight of my meal- deconstructed beef stroganoff!!! What a creative, delicious, and phenomenal creation. The beef was cooked medium rare-ish and placed on a creamy/herby sauce (think ranch), paired with exotic brown mushrooms and sweet pasta chunks. The thing about this dish was that together the components created a heavenly bite, but each could stand alone as well. The dish made sense - on the plate and in my tummy . Also -great selection of music playing throughout the entire meal. -nice waitress (friendly chicagans or amazing service?) -spot on beer pairing suggestions as evidenced by brianQ's ale. -warm lighting and atmosphere, yet swankay decor. After having 2 superb dishes and 2 not-so-great ones, I give GE 4 stars; we may have ordered the wrong items, but a great restaurant is never hit or miss - it's always hit. At the same time, a GOOD restaurant will always have a few 'hits' so awesomely catchy and hittish, that they compensate for the misses.",0.9994,0.734,0.222,0.044,0.6306821779044001

For entree, I had the glazed pork belly with dandelion greens & butternut squash.  That piece of pork belly goes down in history as one of the best pieces of meat I have ever eaten.  It was perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, and most of all - delicious.  My husband had the sturgeon.  It came on a bed of napa cabbage and potato puree.  The flavors on his dish were totally different from mine, but just as good.

2009-10-15,4.0,"The interior of the restaurant is gorgeous. Only problem:  they seated us weird.  My friends made reservations here for my 27th birthday (last week)  knowing I was super intrigued as G. Elliot was on Top Chef Masters.  Got dressed and went out to meet them - only a group of 5 - so it wasn't a huge group.  I was confused as to why the rest of the diners were seated in the area away from the window except us.  I looked over and most of them looked like people engaged in business talk.  There's a chance my friends requested a table where we could better converse - hopefully that's the reason.  Otherwise, it's just weird. The waiter bothered me somewhat because he carded only me. I really hate that.  If you're going to ask someone for their ID - you should card the whole group - unless you're out with your parents and their friends.  Oddly enough, it took him 5 minutes to figure out the birthdate on it and I didn't get the obligatory ""happy birthday"".  I'm thinking he never actually found the birthdate on the I.D. He wasn't all there I think.  That said here's why I gave it 4 stars instead a confusing 1: Drink: London Calling - not a huge fan but it might have to do with the fact that I don't exactly love gin.  The waiter suggested it.  I can pretty much drink any drink so finishing it wasn't a problem - it was good.  Just not good enough to order again.  I continued with Champagne for the rest of the evening. Food (Apps & Entree & Dessert):  Signature Caesar Salad - SOO good. It's deconstructed so you get a whole (but tiny) anchovy and a giant twinkie-like brioche filled with a cream. It was AMAZING. If you get a small bit of every part in each bite - it is seriously delicious.  Who ever thought I'd rave about a Caesar Salad!  Beef Tartare - It was just what it was.  I can't really rave about it since there was nothing truly exciting and noteworthy about it.  But it was good. Lobster Corndog - Most of my table loved this but I was just ""eh"" about it.  The pancake batter around the lobster mash-up masked most of the lobster for me.  I believe this is seasonal so it might not even be there anymore.  Arctic Char - it was amazing. I rarely order fish at a restaurant but one person at the table said the fish was really good there.  She was right.  However, I got to try a little of the scallops from someone else as well as bison which came with root beer reduction.  I could REALLY taste the rootbeer - not sure how I feel about it but the bison was fall apart delish. Both were seriously juicy and delicious as well.  The scallops were very large in size. Like GINORMOUS. Not-Sure-of-Name Dessert but it was a described as ""GE's version of PB&J"" - it included PB gelato and that was probably the best part.  We also ordered the strawberry shortcake - and it was deconstructed too.  It was SOOO yum.   I am officially a big fan of deconstructed food - I love the idea of piecing it together to offer a similar but bold-er taste to its original.  The interior of the GE is warm, inviting but contemporary.  It feels new-age Chicago.  Not the old-school Gold Coast stuffy sugar-daddy-filled gross Chicago.  I'd definitely go again - but maybe on a busier day.  It was nice to have good conversation without shouting but hard to fully feel the true atmosphere of it",0.997,0.752,0.174,0.074,0.6268266565885613

Absolutely amazing. I followed that with the Rissotto, which was cooked perfectly. It has apples, carmalized onions, bacon and ready get this cheez-it's in it! How fun is that? It totally worked too!

There was the chocolate cake pieces which was paired with sweet and salty pecans, butterscotch briittle, cocoa brittle, pistachio gelato and some sort of a yogurt ice cream.

He started with the duck confit, which he said was just absolutely incredible!  It was done very differently....the duck was stuffed into tissue paper ravioli. For his entree he had the squab. It was a really NEAT take on a Thanksgiving dinner. For his dessert he had a take on a pumpkin pie. Which was very, very good. Not as good as my chocolate cake though!!! ;) I would certainly recommend this place to anyone who is in the mood for some creative delicious food.

The food was great.  We shared the caesar salad, the beets, the risotto, the duck confit, the cod and beef stroganoff.  Everything was good but I think the standouts were the risotto and the duck confit.  You could easily smell the smokiness of the risotto and it tasted as good as it smelled.   We also split the pumpkin pie sorbet for dessert - I love a good pumpkin pie and this didn't let me down in any way.      One comment about our server - even though he very knowledgeable and helpful, I couldn't help but feel like he was trying too hard to be ""cool.""",0.9903,0.76,0.201,0.038,0.5882748538011696

It's inventive, surprising and I laughed out loud in happy surprise more than once.  The atmosphere is relaxed and the music is great! Very fun.  We drew a bad pick with our waiter, I think since many of the others seemed more relaxed and fun. Still, he was fine and polite, though a little pushy with the alcohol. If you ask me 4 times if I'd like another drink and I say no each time, why do you feel the need to keep asking? The tables are much closer together than I thought as well. We could hear the people at both tables next to us quite clearly though we had a bit of trouble hearing each other.  We started with the caesar salad which might've been my favorite thing. The brioche ""twinkie"" with parmesan fluff was tasty as well as fun. The dressing was the best caesar dressing I've ever had.  We also had the sweet corn soup (delicious and so fun with the marshmallow and corn nuts!) and the kung pao sweetbreads (pretty good, and I liked the peanut brittle addition). At this point, we were really looking forward to the scallops and the bison with rootbeer bbq sauce.  The bison was our least favorite, but it had my boyfriend's favorite component (root beer bbq sauce). It was pretty tasty, but we even left some on the plate. The onion ring and slaw were pretty good, but nothing seemed very interesting, and the onion ring didn't have much onion flavor.  The scallops were much better and cooked perfectly. The potato salad they were served on was tasty and the fried pickles were a great touch. I'm still not positive they were my favorite combination, but I definitely liked trying something new! Despite my feeling that our server wasn't too happy with us, he brought us complimentary half glasses of bubbly and foie-lipops (foie gras mousse with pop rocks). These were definitely interesting and another instance where I laughed aloud at the  quirkiness, but it might've been too rich for me since I left half of one on the plate.  For dessert we went for interesting rather than creative with the halva (supposed to taste like peanut butter, jelly and banana sandwich, GEB's favorite dessert). It was interesting and kind of fun, but at this point, maybe I was just getting tired of trying to get all the components on the plate in one bite, but it wasn't spectacular.  I really enjoyed the place and love the idea behind GEB's philosophy of relaxed fine dining. I'm really glad we went, and though we probably won't be back (too many other places on our list to try!), I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a food adventure. Oh, and because I was trying to get an idea of prices and couldn't find them anywhere, appetizers are $10-16, entrees $30-40ish and dessert $10.

2009-09-23,4.0,"foie-ly pops foilli pops foielli pops Is that how you spell it?  Who knows because they are not on the menu, allegedly not always available; except for when the moon and the stars are aligned just right...  These wonderful little gems are nearly unexplainable; I will do my best; creamy, light, complex, simply delightful!!!  A Foie Gras moose on a lollipop stick rolled in strawberry pop rocks!  One of the best flavor texture experiences I have ever had....  Foie Gras 7 stars! I have debated whether or not to even review GE because I find it ego driven and unfortunate that GEB himself is a vocal critic of the masses writing about his food, as if the only people that should write or speak of his food are professionals or something, then I remembered I am a foodie and even if he is shortsighted and old-school he still puts out a darn good food experience so I will not throw out the proverbial baby with the bath-water (like he has)....  moving on... There were 4 of us my good friend Miss M and her amazing parents!  Luckily we are all foodies and all like to share, so we all ordered different things then passed the flavor and excitement around... After the goosey goodness we moved on to 4 appetizers  Sweet breads Kung Pao A lil crisp on the outside, a lil chewy on the inside and huge on flavor!  Just genius!  Sweet Breads 5 stars! For the first course I really believe this was everyone's favorite... Well wait there was sweet corn bisque brought with only one spoon, by the time we saw our server again to get more spoons-lets just say it had all disappeared.  I did not try the bisque, I am told it was amazing...  I did not want to share a spoon, I don't know why ... White Tuna sashimi...  I must say of all the small plates this one was mayhaps the least moving...  The tuna was good but not exciting, one of my favorite sashimi and sushi proteins is Escolar/Super white tuna, I have had it all over the country in so many preparations, I am hard to impress on this front...  It was good though for sure!  Tuna 4 stars! Our final small plate was a main Lobster corn dog, really quite good!  Fancy this a little underwhelming, don't get me wrong, I liked it, I guess deep-fried is not my lobster preference; I don't know what I was expecting?   The best lobster I have ever eaten was still crawling off my plate (long story)... If I want Lobster fair-food style I will go for a Lobsta roll off the side of the road in Maine...  Lobster 4 stars! Main courses A wonderfully executed duck dish, having just had my favorite duck the day before, I was extra critical, and you know what?  GE delivered, juicy not fatty, flavorful and not overcooked!  Duck 5 starts! Pan seared scallops again a home run!  Not an out of the park home-run, but really freaking good!  It has become increasingly hard to get 5 stars out of me because to do so it must be in my opinion as good as it gets!  My favorite scallop is served up raw in a roll named for an amazing rock band.  I have been told it is in poor taste to mention other restaurant names while reviewing a restaurant, so lets just say when eating the aforementioned maki roll ""Nothing Else Matters""...  GE Scallops 4 and 1/2 stars! OK wow! yeah! that! good! more please! again! and again!  My favorite dish was a tie!  Two dishes that I could keep coming back to over and over again... The deconstructed gyro and the pork loin... Both worthy of 5 stars! Gyro, lets just say roasted watermelon!  I didn't understand either, hey why do I have to understand something that tastes so amazing!  I just can not fathom a gyro ever surpassing this one... The same goes for the pork loin this was my curve ball order not exotic at all in any way!  I thought to my self; this is going to be out of this world and it was, holy life changing pork experience batman!  This review is already wordy and windy, I purposely removed details of every ingredient in every preparation, and as the menu is always changing...  Guess what?  It doesn't matter anyway...  This all just proves that GE puts out a rock star flavor and texture experience no matter what he is cooking! Oh but I am not done yet! All of this food was nibbled on while slowly sipping a wonderful Pimm's preparation from the mixologist.  This was the best Pimm's preparation I have ever delivered upon my taste buds...  Drink 5 stars! We ended this gastric excursion with a deep chocolate cake and goats ice milk preparation that was truly divine! Dessert  4 and 1/2 stars! GEB  wake up!  Without everyone talking about your food no one would be eating it!  So whether they are talking about it at a cocktail party or online, just be happy they are talking about it chill out and enjoy the ride!

2009-09-21,4.0,I was only in Chicago for the weekend and was referred to Graham Elliot for my dining pleasure.  At first glance I knew I would enjoy this place the ambiance and table set up were great.  When we first were seated we were graced with some champagne and some yummmmy popcorn! I then went for the amazing Caesar salad which had amazing visual appeal the brioche Twinkie is a great idea and was great!  The pork loin went great with the bottle of wine that we ordered and all the melded together for a perfect meal to a perfect start for a night out on the town.  I truly cant wait to come back to this place and enjoy even more of what they have to offer!,0.9941,0.678,0.322,0.0,0.6229166666666667

The flavors go so well together and melt in your mouth.  Scallops are phenomenal and the appetizers are unique and tasty.  We had the lobster corn dog (how cool is that) and the white tuna sashimi that came w/a passion fruit sauce..ohhh so yummy. I'd go here again in a heartbeat if I had the chance.  We were celebrating our anniversary so Graham Elliot signed a menu for us.  Great personal touch.  We even saw him roaming around the restaurant w/the Operational Manager (his right man).  Our waitress told us all about the structure of the place and how Graham Elliot is opening up a sandwich (Grahamwich) place in downtown soon.  We'll check that out too once it's here.",0.9843,0.801,0.185,0.014,0.46428571428571425
2009-09-15,5.0,"The last time I visited my lover, (see original review for the continuance of theme, kthanxbye), and apparently I was nervous. Just a tad bit. See my lover has left others uninspired, some full of spite and not so lovely vibes. They left complaining why in hell did we go there? So when I, two clients, two significant others descended upon G.E. last Friday, I was just hoping this night wouldn't end is disaster. Okay if you call a disaster a hang over the next morning and memories of the night before with everyone leaving with smiles and friendly faces and ""We should do this again!"" coming out of their mouths, then shoot.... it was a disaster. When we arrived for our table of five, my girlfriend and I were the last to arrive. We ordered a drink each and then sat to discuss the plan. Oh wait... they have tasting menus now? The majority of the table threw up their hands and called for a ten course tasting. Sure! Let's do it. Oh and spirit pairings for each course, sure of course! I am sure they will be 1/4 pours or 1/2 pours. I'll be fine. Yes. Famous last words.  I won't go through the entire ten course, but they weren't 1/2 pours they were full. I was schlitzed by the 5th course. So things got hazy when I had the glazed buffalo steak, but the caprese salad was amazing and inventive. Hand pulled mozzarella on a sliced tomato, micro basil, and on top of that balsamic sorbet and drizzled olive oil. Simple, true to form, but playful all in the same breath. The kung pao sweet breads were really good, but sadly I was wishing for heat. The seafood was well done, by that I mean very expertly cooked. The halibut course and the scallop course were great, while the dessert and land dishes were lovely. I will say though the duck, could have been cooked maybe a minute more. It was a little too rare for me as well as ... dare I say? (Dare! Dare!) A little too fatty, (insert audible gasps here). I know.... I know....  The tasting menu is decided by the chef, (yes, Graham was there because we saw him at the end of the night), but really it was all good.  We also tried the lobster corn rolls, which was met with mixed reviews. Um, it is a ton of lobster with a little breading. Not earth shattering. But hey, I loves me some lobster so I was happy.  The wine pairings were great and went well with everything. I will say the were some interesting conversations about the smell of some of the wine, (the pinot won for best wine and I am trying to figure out what beer we had, everyone loved it), but really, what I was most worried about, was one of the best things. The service. Perhaps it is because we got the ten course tasting menu with the spirit pairings, but really, I never felt like we were ever abandoned. In fact I felt like we were treated better then ever.  Maybe I have some good karma. Or perhaps its because I was there... (okay that one was a stretch), I really don't mind. I was reaffirmed in my faith in my lover, as whorish as that lover can be, over the top, full of ways to tantalize, torture, whips and chains, bag of tricks I was completely satisfied.

Our reservation was for 9:15pm and it was packed but they got us in right on time. The appetizers for our table of 4 were great -- lobster corndog, tuna sashimi were great -- wings were spicy hot but in a good way. The entrees were where it all fell short. It took an incredibly long time to get our food and when it came it was obviously reheated. The steak with root beer BBQ sauce was a bit on the sweet side and the beans definitely tasted reheated.

2009-09-14,3.0,"I have eaten in Graham Elliot twice and on both occassions I thought the food was only average. For me, the truffle popcorn is a poor alternative to the amazing bread that Graham does bake when he wants (the bread in Avenues was amazing). I started with the sweet corn bisque which was pretty average. Different with the garlic marshmallow in it, but not better than regular sweet corn bisque that I have had. My gf had the beef tartare which was the highlight of the dinner. Very small portion but really delicious. The pan roasted scallops are oversized and tastleless. Really poor quality and they tasted as if they had been frozen. I was really surprised that GE would use such poor quality ingredients. The bison skirt steak was tasty but the accompanying baked beans and onion rings were poor (The Kerryman bar just 3 blocks away has much better) so again an average meal that with wine and gratuity will cost about $100 per person. The ice milk is tasty but the chocolate cake dessert is basic and totally overpriced for what you receive for $10. I have eaten Dale Levitskis food and in my opinion he is a better chef than Graham Elliot.",-0.5557,0.808,0.09,0.102,0.5908769230769231
2009-09-14,3.0,"This was our big night out spot while visiting Chicago.  Overall, a good night--no real complaints, but I just wasn't blown away either. Upon arrival, I was struck by how orange it is in there.  I wondered if it was a Halloween theme, but remembered it was September, so that didn't make sense.  I like the reflecting artichoke images, very cool. We ordered drinks immediately and, even though I tend to avoid gin due to bad nights in the past, I had a blueberry gin cocktail that was amazingly delicious.  I could have inhaled about 6 of them.  The popcorn is a nice treat--good flavors, except it was a bit stale and seemed to have been made days ago. We decided to go a la carte, so we could share dishes.  I started with the tuna sashimi appetizer with pureed avocado and passion fruit.  The passion fruit dollops were amazingly incredible, but the fish had barely any flavor.  I also had the corn soup with a garlic marshmallow.  It was good, but nothing amazing and I got tired of the same bland flavors as I kept eating it.  The star of the night was the bison steak with the BBQ sauce that tasted of root beer.  The meat was perfectly prepared and was juicy and delicious.  I could have eaten it every day.  We also ordered the PB&J dessert, which was good and creative, but not my thing.  It made my friend very happy, so that was nice. The service was strangely attentive and absent at the same time.  Our water was refilled almost immediately after each sip and my empty plate was removed quickly, but I often had to wait quite a while for a glass of wine and was almost done with one course before it arrived.  It was, however, a nice big pour.  Our waiter was friendly and helpful, however. I'm glad I went and had a good meal overall, but next time I'm in Chicago, I think I'll check out other options.",0.9962,0.715,0.215,0.07,0.5831944444444445
2009-09-13,5.0,"I went to Graham Elliot recently as part of my birthday celebration, and I could not be happier.  From the friendly and accessibly service to the laid-back atmosphere, everything exceeded my expectations. And the food was no exception!  I could list everything we ate that night, but as the menu changes frequently that doesn't seem necessary.  Here are some highlights: The cocktail menu has something for everyone and every one I tried was delicious and unique. From the savory Peaches and Herb to the tropical Almost Paradise, they were all tasty and fun. Favorite: Blueberry Hill-sweet yet tart, lovely blueberry compote, I could have had four more! The sweet corn bisque could not have been seasoned better. Every bite was like a celebration in my mouth that I just wanted to eat and eat and eat. The corn nuts gave it some texture, and the garlic marshmallow was different and worth it. I had the the sea scallops for my entree and I never knew fried pickles could go so well with anything. Each bite of every ingredient together was great and the scallops were cooked very well and melted in my mouth. Dessert was good, not totally mind blowing, but I loved the use of ingredients and the plating was beautiful.  If the blackberry panna cotta is still available, it is a must try for berry lovers (of which I am one!). All in all, it was a whimsical and satisfying dining experience.  The portion sizes are on the small side, which I think is perfect because you can try more.  It is also on the pricey side, but I think that is reflected in the quality of ingredients.  They have a tasting menu option ($75 for five courses) and I think it'd be worth a try. I plan to go back when the menu has been changed up and I already can't wait.

And in case you are curious, no, I did not say anything to him or embarass myself.  It is weird how these cooking shows have made chefs into psuedo celebrities. So I came here with a friend on an early Friday evening.  The atmosphere is really relaxed and the bar was vibrant.  Started off with some cocktails; the tainted love and the london calling.  Both were really good, not overly sweet, well balanced without being too boozy.  Tried the tuna appetizer, salmon and scallops entrees, and strawberry shortcake dessert.  Delicous!  The scallops just melt in your mouth, and they were served with a pork hash.  The shortcake dessert was quite tasty, albeit tiny.  Don't plan on sharing dessert if you want more than a mouthful. Overall, graham elliot is a fantastic experience.  Not someplace I'd come on a regular basis, but once in a while.  Would definitely come back and sit at the bar for drinks.  There is some good mixing going on over at the bar.",0.9569,0.835,0.128,0.036,0.4432905982905983

2009-09-02,3.0,"Great concept -- mediocre execution. My boyfriend and I visited Graham Elliot on August 6th -- a Thursday night.  Before I launch into a review, I have to say our expectations were set for a fun, funky meal of interesting flavors.  I'll admit, it was a higher expectation than you'd have of a chain-restaurant or a hot-dog stand.  We were there to try some innovative and interesting food minus the pretentious atmosphere.  This is something that Graham Elliot advertises.  We were looking for a special date night out while visiting Chicago, and having read and heard about Chef Bowles, I thought this was the perfect spot. I have to say, however, I was disappointed.  Overall, the imagination was there with the dishes, but the execution seemed lacking.  Let me explain what we had and where it was good or where it fell short: ""Amuse-bouche"":  We ordered an amuse bouche each -- a fois ""lollypop"" covered in watermelon-flavored pop-rocks.  We were adventurous and wanted to try something new.  I wish our server had mentioned it was fois-mousse as I'm not always such a huge fan of the texture and would have re-thought the decision.  Even so, I think my expectations were high based on the fois-lollypop I had at Bazaar in LA (wrapped in cotton candy) which was divine.  Both my boyfriend and I felt this fell short with the flavors although the novelty of the poprocks was interesting.  I question the concept of an amuse bouche being made to order and think perhaps it might be termed something else.  Yeah...I'm picky....but something rubbed me the wrong way about ordering a dish that -- in concept - is usually a gift from the chef meant to tease your taste buds for the meal to come.  Maybe they should call it something else instead? Appetizers: Corn-nut bisque:  This was served so that the server (or expiditer in our case) brought out a bowl with the ingredients and then poured the soup over.  The soup itself was a great consistency and the corn and corn-nut flavors were good, but whatever was added that included the smokey chilpotle-like flavors were completely over-powering.  There was too much of that stuff in the bottom of the bowl -- rendering the soup way over-seasoned.   House ceasar salad: This was super creative, with two rectangular wedges of ice-berg on top of a savory ""twinkie"" filled with garlic cream.  On top were white anchovies and it was served with a lovely green (garlic?) sauce.  Honestly, the ""twinkie"" was heavenly, and I really appreciated the mild flavor of the anchovies.  And rectangle one of the salad was great.  Rectangle two was as hard as a stone.  I'm not sure if it was just cut out of the center of the head of lettuce or if it came from some sort of iron-injected super-lettuce, but I couldn't cut it to save my life.  Neither could my boyfriend.  And he has the forearms of a god.  Alas...I digress. Mains: Root-beer BBQ steak: The BBQ sauce on this dish was absolutely magical.  My (English) boyfriend absolutely hates root-beer and loved this, and the meat was extremely tender, to boot. Decontrstructed/Reconstructed Lamb Gyro:  Again -- absolutely delicious sauces and the meat was cooked nice and rare -- the way we like it.  The Tzatziki sauce had some mystery ingredient we couldn't place.  We were practically licking the plate.  One minor note was that the ""pita"" that was on the plate was hard as a rock, though. We both had desserts -- the chocolate ""stick"" dessert which had pretty good flavors although wasn't anything we haven't had before.  We liked the banana-halva dessert. Ok -- now that I've detailed the food, there is one other thing that really bugged us.  Having left the restaurant feeling meh about some of the food -- the waitor and his attitude really bugged us.  Perhaps it is part of the schpeal, but he had to tell us the entire back story of the restaurant and just how acclaimed Chef Bowles was.  (We already knew about him.)  I don't know how to describe it, but the entire schtick -- with the popcorn down to how our server had to explain the casual attire -- it felt gimmicky.  It also felt pretentious.  The entire point of this place -- from the popcorn to the servers' attire was meant to be the opposite, but when we had to hear for 10 minutes about how Chef Bowles was gone that night preparing for Lalapalooza and how the staff was going to help him tomorrow...and wow...isn't that so wonderful...on and on and on....it defeated the purpose.  It was self-congratulatory and had absolutely nothing to do with the nitty-gritty -- the food.  Overall, having dropped around $170 there for two meals and drinks, I felt that we could have had a better meal without the dripping pretentiousness elsewhere.  I guess for that price, I would have expected the appetizers to sing and the waitor to be less-- I don't know...meh. Perhaps this was all because the head chef was out.  When the cat's away, the mice will play?",0.999,0.804,0.16,0.036,0.5516721728563836

Originally, I was ready for bland with a side of nothing, but this got my hopes up.  I was excited.  I was going to get the full Graham Elliot experience. What I got was grilled zucchini.  That's what you get when you go to any random place and they aren't prepared and just throw something together.  It didn't have any interesting flavor pairings, just couscous and a sauce that was pretty mild.  Plus the portion was less than what my co-diners had with their expensive cuts of meat. Similarly, the popcorn in vegan form just was without things.  The non-veg popcorn has truffle oil on it.  Come on, mushrooms are vegan! The slight uptick was dessert.  Frankly, you just have to attempt it and you'll score points.  It was berries and bananas with prickly pear sauce and foam, and banana sorbet.  It was pretty good and they got a star just for that.

I took my m-i-l here for her birthday.  We each got 1 cocktail, 1 appetizer, 1 entree and coffee (no dessert, no wine) and the total came out to about $170.00 with tip.  Just be aware that you are making an investment when you come.   My brother and sister-in-law accompanied us to dinner and they are vegan.  When I called ahead for reservations, the hostess was very sweet and said that they can totally accommodate our vegan guests.  The chef made a vegan-version of one of the appetizers, a completely off-menu vegan entree and a vegan dessert for them.  The vegan alternatives were thoughtful and had some effort put into them, and I thought it was really nice that they would be so accommodating. Though the restaurant did remember that we had two vegans, they completely ignored my m-i-l's birthday.  The hostess had specifically asked if there were any special events associated with our dinner when I called to make our reservations, and our reservation card had the birthday/vegan information on it.  Though the waiter addressed our vegan needs right away, there was absolutely no mention of my m-i-l's birthday at all. For a restaurant that is so interested in providing a fun, welcoming atmosphere and so willing to accommodate their guests, I was really surprised about this oversight.  I have to say that it was disappointing enough to cost a star in this review.",0.9522,0.849,0.11,0.041,0.6362301587301586

Soooooo.... What to say about Graham Elliot? There was not much say beyond: we loved every minute of it! From the first step in, it was apparent that this was our ""type"" of place - from the casual but fun staff to the loud (maybe mom and dad wouldn't appreciate it -that- much) and Lolla-like music, we knew we were in for an experience of the write-home kind! Now we're foodies, yes. And we usually set high expectations for the food on a menu like this, so we were quite impressed that our waiter, Clint, not only sold us on the tasting menu, but also encouraged us to let him drive the ""wine"" pairing (which he amended with the addition of some mighty fine white beer). We also ""added""  lobster corny dogs and   may have depleted of GE's amazing truffle oil and pepper popcorn baskets several times over. Delish! The tasting menu (detailed in much better fashion than I could do justice in many reviews before and after mine) is very hearty and for $75, a more than a deal! My personal favorite was the cole slaw on the root beer bbq steak - so much so I grabbed GE as he was headed back to the kitchen to tell him he had stolen this Texas girl's heart with a piece of home. And, to add icing to a decadent cake, GE stopped and chatted with us for several minutes (priceless!). So, this may not be the place to celebrate your grandmother's 90th birthday, but if you're looking for a fun and lively dinner with some darn tasty and innovative food - don't think twice.

He sent us to the bar, got us a bottle of champagne and worked on the seating adjustment.  As someone who expects much more than great food for an optimal dining experience, I was truly impressed.  A 5-star restaurant is NOTHING w/o impeccable staff. The mixologist's drink menu was impressive to say the least.  Every drink, just like every dish (as I would soon discover), is premeditated from top to bottom.   Yes, it's true...the popcorn on the table does in fact rock.  Parmesan, cracked pepper and truffle oil popcorn...only a top chef master would think of that one.  ;-) I got the white tuna sashimi as an appetizer.  It's made w/ dark chocolate pieces, guacamole mousse, plantain chips.  It was a culinary masterpiece.  The lobster bisque looked and smelled amazing.   My entree was the bison and it was also cooked and served to perfection.  The deconstructed gyro is so creatively brilliant, in my opinion.   Strawberry shortcake was out of this world!!!   I'm sure the menu changes regularly, but you can be sure that every genius dish will be made meticulously with only the finest ingredients.

It was delectable and creamy with a central garlic marshmallow. So far, so good. THEN, to top it off, the bisque contained Corn Nuts! Who would've thought that? That was the defining moment for me as far as his genius and innovative use of ingredients.  The substitution of truffle and parmesan popcorn for bread was another one of his avant-garde calls. The only thing funny was that it tasted VERY SIMILAR to the foccaccia served at Avec. I know the ingredients are similar, just wasn't expecting that.  The service was attentive and friendly. Not stuck-up as I was expecting.  I want to give GE 5 stars, but.......wasn't a fan of the lobster (sorry, Graham). Don't get me wrong, the lobster was very tasty and the edamame spread was delightful, but the lobster meat was stuck to the shell. It was semi-embarrassing battling the hell out of this dead lobster as other diners glared on. In the end, the lobster won. I had to leave 50% of the meat behind. I know. So sad, so sad.

For main  courses we had the halibut, which was beautifully cooked and flavored and the pork loin, which was done well, but again standard fare.

2009-07-31,5.0,"Everything was amazing, from the parmesean-truffle oil popcorn that begins each meal to our chocolate dessert.  We ordered the five-course tasting menu and my only complaint is that the tasting menu does not offer anything that is not on the regular menu so we could have just ordered two first courses, two second courses, and two different desserts and would have had the same amount of food but would have gotten to taste one more dessert for the same price, possibly less.  I guess I'd rather have more samplings and smaller portions for a tasting menu but that's an ordering lesson learned for next time.  That said, what we got was so good.  Every bite.  We started with the white tuna sashimi appetizer, two beautiful pieces of fish with spicy avocado mousse, mango puree, cocoa nibs, shaved radish, plantain chips and some citrus oil.  Transcendent!  Second course was a spring pea bisque with a lavender marshmallow and what tasted like sorrel, but may have been pea shoots.  The marshmallow lent a little sweetness, but not a lot, and the lavender was just a hint to let you know its there but not making you see purple.  Third was a crispy piece of halibut with a unique smoked eggplant puree, served with Israeli couscous and zucchini, grilled fennel and a tomato marmalade.  This was my absolute favorite.  I'd never had smoked eggplant and it seems like an odd pairing with fish but it lent an earthy richness that made this the best fish dish I've ever had.  Fourth was a beautiful bison skirt steak served in a rich root beer reduction sauce.  Last was a cake composed of white and dark chocolates and some frozen concoction.  I think what I liked best was that each composition was carefully calibrated as to every ingredient so that the diner tastes every single component, no matter how subtle.",0.9955,0.806,0.173,0.021,0.43077431827431834

I took my boyfriend to GE for his birthday dinner and we were not disappointed, though I will say there were a couple of blah dishes.  The steak tartar appetizer was bland--the sauce that accompanied it didn't do anything for what I'm sure was a great cut of beef.  I also wasn't overly impressed with GE's desserts.  I call them ""concept desserts"" in that they were interesting to look at, but when it came time to eat them there was nothing fantastic there.  I was waiting for a surprise with each bite and there wasn't one.  Regardless, I do like the fact that everything GE serves makes you think...the plating is always interesting. Now on to the positives.  The popcorn...mmm...seriously good stuff, people!  Granted, if I hosed my popcorn in butter and oil at home and then put cheese on it, it'd probably be equally tasty, but still, props where props are due.  I think we ate two baskets. Our mains were also delicious.  They are no longer on the menu, but I had a fish dish and my boyfriend had GE's take on BBQ and wow.  I think his mains are where he really earns his rep.  It's hard for a restaurant to live up to so much hype, but I must say, I still think about that meal and smile. Finally, the drinks were really inventive and I loved the two I had (one was Blueberry Hill, the other is no longer on the menu).  If you like to experiment with martinis, GE is the place to do it!  If you don't, they have a great wine and beer selection for you to choose from.

The combination of flavors and infusion of unusual ingredients make the dining experience really fun.  After every dish, you're anticipating for what will come next. The truffle popcorn was definitely unique and the flavors were great; however it was stale. I wonder how awesome it would be if it came out freshly popped.   We had the corn bisque and the sweet bread as starters.  They were both very good.  For the entree, we had the halibut and the duck.  The halibut outshined all the dishes.  I just loved the harmony of flavors that came from the cous cous and the smoked egg plant. The earthly flavors just married so well with the grilled halibut (so fresh by the way).  I don't know what spices were used but everything just worked.  The duck was great too and I loved the presentation, which kind of looked like a paint palette.  If you're into sweet and sour kind of intense Asian flavors then you will like the duck.  However, the halibut was memorable. I do appreciate that GH is going for haute cuisine without the stuffy, intimidating atmosphere.  The servers were very attentive and our glasses were filled after every other sip it seemed like.  They  also offer free in-house sparkling water.  Every dish is served with an explanation of the ingredients.  The prices were also haute cuisine and I felt it was a bit inflated though.

They were very welcoming, our table was ready on time, champagne on the house...I really didn't have much to complain in the service/hospitality department.  What saddened me, as much as I wanted to like this restaurant, was that the food was not that tasty and of course, at a place like this, the servings were on the small side. Eat that truffle oil/parmesan popcorn to fill up if you are not ordering more than an entree!! For appetizers we ordered the Kobe beef tartare and the scallops. The scallop was on a potato salad and was drizzled profusely with bacon. The flavors just didn't mesh well...I would go with the beef tartare, which was a nice portion and had a light and fresh taste to it. For our entrees, we got the tamarind lacquered duck and buffalo strip steak. We enjoyed both of these, but I liked the duck more because the salad and coconut rice worked well with the curry. The buffalo was a little tougher than I thought it might have been.  For dessert...if you don't like the idea of having your dessert ingredients separated and deconstructed on your plate..leaving the serving to your imagination..do not order it here. Otherwise, my dessert was a close second favorite to the duck. My husband got the bittersweet chocolate cake and I got the panna cotta. I loved the panna cotta with lychee bits and sunflower seeds, the textures and flavors were mysteriously vonderlicious together.

2009-07-12,4.0,"From Austin and in town for a Guy's Trip. Most of the group were not Foodies but we picked this as our place for our ""big meal"". We heard about Graham from some readings and personal reviews.  Make no mistake - This is a date place or for two couples. We knew that but wanted to try their food. So not complaining.  Food is out of this world! I mean it is one of the better combinations of price and food I have had in a while. The menu changes all the time so ask advice when you go. You can eat food that would cost you 1.5x more at this place - that is value.  Good:  - Appetizers - Tartar and Tuna  - Appetizer - Foie Gra with pop rocks - i know it is strange but it was killer  - Bison and the Lamb (deconstructed Gyros - way good).  - Wine list - not too pricey for the selection  Poor:  - Service - it is all over the reviews of this place that they have too many people per server. I could not agree more. (examples - taking drink orders and not coming back for 15 min with the drinks, stacking the apps and the main courses too close together, taking the wine orders and disappearing but returning with the wine and then leaving the bottles on the table for 5 min unopened - just seems like people are swamped.) I really hope that GE reads these reviews and realizes that he has some of the best food in town and it is getting dragged down by not adding one or two more servers to the room. I have been to Spiaggia, OTOM, MOTO, Sepia, etc. (I get to town a bit and always eat out). This place really stacks up and is not off the charts expensive but you have to fix the service ratios or the loyal ones will stop coming. Judging by the number of comments on service with specific examples, this cannot be just a bad server.

Unfortunately, nothing really came together.  The Foie-lly pops were OK, if you're into that sort of thing, but neither of our entrees were really that spectacular.  I had the lamb, my wife had the halibut.  Both were average, nothing terribly exciting.  And were priced into the high $20s.  The Mexican chocolate cake with the horchata milkshake for dessert was really tasty, though... but really didn't make up for the average entrees.

2009-07-10,5.0,"Last night was my third visit to Graham Elliot.  The first was with clients/friends and it was wonderful and then I went back with friends, sitting at the bar having wine and selections of items from their Hot and Cold sections of the menu. Lynn their in-house mixologist diva and Jeff,  the dapper and friendly manager, totally took care of us - and a ""glass of wine to catch up"" ended as a 2 1/2 hour session full of wine, yummy food, and a good natter.   Last night, a different group of friends and I arrived early - straight after work - and decided to sit out on the patio. I have to preface - whenever this group gets together- our cheeks end up hurting because of how much we laugh together.  There is no such thing as an ""inside voice"" to be had between the four of us - so being outside, was good for all parties involved.   Our server was Jason and he was courteous, attentive,  funny and really helped to set the stage for the entire evening - it was quite clear we were going to be a handful - but hopefully a fun one.   I chose a glass of rose (it was the first summer like day in quite a while) while my other diners each chose the specialty cocktails:  the Blueberry Hill, Strawberry Fields (how did the creme continue to stay on top of the glass, even whilst being consumed) and another lovely drink, the name of which escapes me at the moment - but tasted like summer in a glass - both bright and fresh.   Needless to say, though my wine was lovely, I was a bit jealous.    Jeff, the manager, stopped by to say hello - remembering me from the time before - and ensured that we were well taken care of, and showcasing the care and hospitality that made me want to return.   As we discussed menu options, Jason approached, and proving that we are a handful (and even knowing that the menu had just been changed a few days before) we tested his menu knowledge with lots of ""this or that?"" questions - and he passed with flying colors:  he highly suggested the caesar salad  (and the bisque, but that was already decided upon) and the walleye, and as you will see, he was also a great salesman.   Our dining experience started with Chef's famous amuse - the foie gras mousse lollipop, with fleur de sel and ""rimmed"" with poprocks.  It was the perfect combination of savory, salty, sweet and velvety texture was enhanced by the popping of the pop rocks.   Next, we were treated to this lovely sweet corn bisque - that had a garlic marshmallow (!!), a chipotle marmalade and corn nuts.  After ""completing"" the dish by combining all of the elements - we were all impressed with the sweet corn flavor, accented by the heat of the chipotle and the crunch of the corn nuts  Also taking care of our table was Jonathan - who was also delightful and attentive.  Next, we had Chef's take on Caesar salad - a brioche twinkie filled with an herbed mascarpone, topped with a romaine heart dredged (?) in the anchovy garlic goodness that is their caesar dressing - and topped with white anchovies.  I have never been one for anchovies - but these totally changed my mind about the little darlings I ordered the pine nut crusted sole served with polenta and sauteed swiss chard, served over brown butter and then topped with a raisin compote.   The sole was perfectly cooked, and when combining the fish, the crust, and the raisin compote - it was the perfect combination of buttery crust, sweet and rich raisins, with the flaky fish.  Truly lovely.  And, the polenta was perfectly prepared and the swiss chard provided a slightly bitter balance to the brown butter sauce.  One of my friends had the halibut (which was moist and flavorful) with Israeli couscous (with zucchini) and caramelized fennel - really light and tasty.  One other ordered the walleye (suggested by Jason) with artichokes, orange puree and a black olive ""paint"" on the bottom of the plate - once again, impressed with perfectly prepared fish.  The other person at the table, couldn't decide between the halibut or the bison skirt steak and allowed Jason to pick for her - and she didn't know what was coming, until she received a different knife from the rest of us.   The bison was accompanied by baked beans, an onion ring, fresh chimichurri, and incorporated Sprekers root beer - which you could really taste and was, once again, cooked to perfection.  Not quite finished, we decided to sample three of the four options:  the deconstructed strawberry shortcake (the cake was so buttery and moist and dense, yet light all at the same time), the dark chocolate cake (rich and dense - with ice milk - a playful take on cookies and creme) and the darjeeling pana cotta - with both fresh raspberries and coulis and some sort of sorbet/gelato that was tart and sweet, and played off the silky texture and flavor of the pana cotta quite well.  And though the music is not played on the patio - from my previous visits - Graham Elliot has the best playlist of any restaurant in Chicago.

2009-07-09,4.0,"Dear Graham, You had me at truffle oil popcorn. Your staff didn't bring just one basket, no. We finished it in 5 minutes flat and they kindly brought us a second basket! How could I possibly say ""no""? Yes, I do love truffle anything and would probably seriously consider purchasing truffle scented lotion if it were on the market, but truffle popcorn? Simply delicious. I could go on and on about the foie lollipops too. Melt in your mouth goodness with a little sparkle of pop rocks.  After my mouth watering treats the BF and I got down to business. We considered the 5-course tasting meal but none of our ""must order"" items were on the list so instead we ordered everything a la carte. Here was our breakdown: *Buffalo Chicken deconstructed with celery 5 ways - what you can do that many crazy things to celery? I guess so. The meat was tender and succulent and the Stella Artois foam though interesting didn't dazzle my tastebuds *Scallop - this is one huge scallop with some potato salad & fried pickles on the side *Pork Chop - wow. Can pork be cooked this delicately? I was expecting a huge chop o meat, but instead was greeted with small cuts of pork that melted in my mouth. *Bison skirt steak - our server described this as ""Cowboys and Indians on a plate"". I thought it was an interesting concept. The steak was really tender. *Deconstructed strawberry shortcake - beautiful presentation, the strawberry gelato was wonderful...there really was not enough of this dessert for two people though! Ok Graham, now I know you're scratching your head wondering why I didn't give you my full 5-star rating right? Well your food is great, your decor is interesting (I feel like you could have pushed the envelope a bit more but maybe you wanted to keep things clean so the food was the star right?), but your service? It needs work. Like my Yelp colleagues have mentioned here they just aren't all that attentive. Sure the busser with the food have an excellent and passionate description of what we were about to eat, but our waiter? Nice, but he kind of forgot about us and left to go chat with his compatriots in the corner. This is the kicker...we were celebrating my BFs b-day and I wanted it to be special...I put that in my Opentable reservation. Didn't you see that? I mentioned something when I went to pay the check and the waiter brought out some champagne. Thanks but a little late. I probably will come back and visit you to see what's on tap next, because let's face it you're one talented guy and you cook some rockin food.

2009-07-08,3.0,"I knew what I was getting myself into, and I should've known better. My husband and I had 7:30 reservations. When we arrived, we were seated immediately.  The restaurant was busy and we were excited to start our meal. Then it began....the notorious lackadasical service. I witnessed it, experienced it, lived it, and am here to tell the annoying story about it. First, there were a million people in chocolate brown t-shirts.  Who is the server? Who are the bus people? Who is going to answer my questions about the menu?! WHOOOOOOOOO?!!! Someone comes and fills my water glass, but there is no menu.  A different person hands us the menu, but doesn't stick around to discuss anything.  Ten or 15 minutes after we've been seated, the server comes over to introduce himself and take our drink orders .  I get a beer, the husband gets their sparkling water (which is super filtered and looks deceptively still in the glass but is crazy bubbly). Great. Thanks. Some more time passes and we get to talk to our server and ask him all the questions about the menu.  Apparently, the menus changed to the summer menu the night before, so we were excited to try the new food. We started with the infamous popcorn.  It's delish.  It's nicely seasoned with the truffle oil and chives, and it's got this nice earthy/salty flavor. I started with the scallop appetizer which was awesome.  It was perfectly cooked, well seasoned and all around delicious. My husband had the ceasar salad which was also great.  The whole thing just worked.  The twinkie had this cheese filling thing that was good and it had a great combination of flavors. We tried a third appetizer, the buffalo chicken....which was ehh.  It basically was DOUSED in hot sauce.  I love buffalo wings, but I prefer them to be mild as opposed to hot hot hot.  I like the taste of the hot sauce but I don't want to be overwhelmed by it, especially if it's Frank's or some other store brand hot sauce.  I could be wrong, but can you at least make your own, or change it up a bit?  The roquefort mousse was different and added a lot of flavor to the dish, but the whole thing was just meh. For our entrees I had the halibut, which again, was cooked PERFECTLY.  It came with this tomato jam, israeli cous cous with grilled fennel, and smoked eggplant.  My plate was almost licked clean.  My husband had the deconstructed gyro.  The dish had pieces of lamb, with feta, tomato and some pickled cucumber.  My husband thought the cucumber was good and the dish was good, but underwhelming.  Yes, it was plated differently and the meat was different than the normal gyro, but nothing about it was spectacular.   For dessert we had the deconstructed strawberry shortcake.  Again, yes, it tasted good, but nothing about it was stellar.  When you got a bite of everything it was good, but what was there that really set it apart from the other strawberry shortcake you've had?! Not really anything aside from the plating. Now, on to the service.  When you are paying as much as you are paying for a meal like this, a lot of the overall experience depends on the service you get while at the restaruant.  The intial flurry of people  ""helping"" us made us feel like everything people said about the bad service was wrong...until we moved further along into the meal. After our appetizers, we had the entrees, but the server didn't come to ask us how we like our meals soon enough.  He came and asked about my husband's lamb, which he thought was a little undercooked, about 5 min before he was done.  Fine, he offered to have them throw it on the grill (which I am convinced that restaurants really just put it in the microwave) when there were 3 pieces of lamb left on his dish.  Really?  REALLY?  We get WAY better service at places where the meals are a fraction of the cost.   After our entree plates were cleared, we had to wait 10 min for our dessert menus, then another 10 min to get our order in.  When the waiter finally came around, I said, "" We thought we lost you!""  He replied, ""I thought I lost myself!""  Umm...WHAT?! What does that even mean?!  How is that ok? Then, here is the kicker...I stood up to track down the waiter to get my own check.  Yes, ladies and gentlemen, at the end, I was my own server...it got that bad. The whole thing wouldn't have been so bad, had I not seen the terrible inefficiencies in the restaurant. There were a lot of people ""looking"" busy, and by that I mean walking up the restaurant empty handed, and coming back...you guessed it, empty handed.  It was like the servers were being assigned tables as they came in instead of having areas.  So, it meant that my ""server"" was all over the place. I know the restaurant isn't that large, but come on...there has to be a better way.  From the beginning game of who's who to the end when I had to stand up and get the check, it was all off. I was glad to have the experience, but service left me feeling disappointed.",0.9989,0.799,0.155,0.045,0.5868977928637021
2009-07-07,3.0,"Maybe it was all the hype I heard before I actually visited, but Graham Elliot didn't quite live up to my expectations.  I will admit that at least part of this is due to the fact that I am a vegetarian and there was only one veggie option on the menu (an appetizer) and only one other that our waiter said could be customized veggie (another appetizer), which left me with basically no choice in what I would be eating and not a lot of food, either.  The asparagus salad with frisee, a soft-boiled egg and parmesan foam was good but not great- this was the app with the optional bacon powder withheld, so maybe that made the difference here.  The split pea bisque with pea tendrils and a lavender marshmallow was truly excellent and innovative.  My boyfriend had the foie gras (not in lollipop form!) and the sweetbreads- liked both but raved about the sweetbreads.  For dessert, we had the deconstructed panne cotta and weren't impressed.  We enjoyed the signature cocktail list very much. Raves and gripes- I thought the decor was surprising, witty and cool.  The music was sort of loud but I loved it.  Anyplace that can go from ABBA to Dashboard Confessional is fine by me!  Service was pretty bad- the couple next to us, who were doing the tasting menu, were so disgruntled about it that they complained to the manager.  We had to constantly search for our waiter with requests about actually finally ordering a drink or getting our water refilled after a looooong time without any.  Also, we didn't get any popcorn!  I didn't even realize I should have asked for it until reading other reviews here today.  Boo!  Overall, I think this place is worth a try for the novelty factor, but come prepared for a long meal and don't bring your vegetarian friends.",0.9809,0.791,0.144,0.065,0.5813636363636363

As far as food, we tried many, MANY of the items on the menu.  Aside from the fact that my dinner date and I were being little piggies, she knows the owner/chef from a previous life and he was very generous to us with various small plates of yummy goodness.  Every dish was plated and presented beautifully.  I wasn't sure if I should eat it or photograph it.  But eat we did.  The split pea bisque was sweet and creamy, beef tartare was fresh but could have used a little more zippy zest or something, but the kung pao chicken was my absolute favorite.  For entrees I'd suggest the pistachio stuffed pork chop and definitely don't skip dessert.  The chocolate cake could satisfy any sweet tooth but I really loved the simple deconstructed strawberry shortcake.   Summary:  great food, pleasant service, generous owner, and excellent atmosphere.  Be prepared to spend a little more but I think you'll find it money well spent.  Skip the romantic dinner for two and come here with a group of friends to have a glass or three of wine and eat away your work week stress or just to kick off the weekend right.",0.9971,0.759,0.219,0.022,0.5920634920634921

2009-05-27,4.0,"What a great restaurant!  I went here with a friend this past weekend and had an excellent time.  We were had a stylish restaurant with gourmet food at not-too-steep prices in mind, and Graham Elliot did not disappoint.   I'll start with the food.  Tables receive complimentary gourmet popcorn (in place of the standard, boring bread basket) with a different flavor each day.  Ours was chive-flavored, appropriately crunchy and delicious.  It's the perfect pre-appetizer nibble that won't you fill you up before your order arrives.  Better yet, popcorn refills are free!  I chose split pea bisque and escargot for my meal.  The portions were perfect - smaller than the huge entrees you see at many restaurants, but large enough to feel appropriately full when I was done.  I usually like to order appetizers and salad/soup rather than a full entree, and the ""hot"" and ""cold"" sections on the menu did not disappoint me.   Drinks are also excellent.  Several interesting wines by the glass and fun cocktails with a fresh twist are available.  I was pleased with my wine selection, and my friend ended up foregoing dessert in favor of a cocktail because she was so intrigued.  Although neither of us ordered dessert, we also received a complimentary sample of three tea-flavored sorbets that were delicious. Graham Elliot definitely caters to the young, stylish, late-evening dining crowd, and the place was still relatively full when we arrived for our 8:30 pm reservation.  Decor is stylish without being tragically hip.  My only complaint on the space is the noise level.  Music and conversation bounce in all directions off the low, wooden, beam-lined ceiling, which makes hearing your companions quite difficult, although we became used to it as the meal progressed.   Finally, service is also friendly and accommodating.  Initially, we were worried that bad service was ahead when we had to ask another server to send ours over to take our drink order after we'd been seated for several minutes.  She was very apologetic upon her arrival, however, and made up for it with prompt, proactive service and a cheerful demeanor, so we chalked up the beginning as a fluke.   Definitely check out Graham Elliot if you're looking for fine-dining food with a more laid-back atmosphere and price point.  I'll be back!",0.9971,0.75,0.208,0.042,0.5933063791554358

I had the Molten Chocolate cake for desert which was even better than the entree.  Caramel was added to the side as well as a small ""glass"" filled with a milk shake.  Better experienced firsthand than described.  Overall, I enjoyed the experience at Graham Elliott but did not come away wowed or disappointed.  If you're looking to find a quality establishment at a reasonable price, than GE is definitely for you.  If price is not an issue, then the more expensive staples (such as Alinea or Moto) are a better option.",0.991,0.765,0.176,0.059,0.5854785247432307

Sitting at the bar until my table was ready I knew I was going to enjoy this place, it was stirring with excited conversation as Guns and Roses' ""November Rain"" played in the background.   My first cocktail, the Almond Paradise I believe it was called, was a delicious cucumber libation that was very light and refreshing which only made me more eager to find out what else this restaurant was going to offer; I tip my hat to the mixologist for setting a good tone for my meal. We ordered appetizers, main course and dessert, but I must say that the winner was most definitely the appetizers.  The scallop came with a kind of German potato salad, it was cooked perfectly and was flavored very well.  We also ordered sashimi which was very fresh and I enjoyed the combination of textures; the white tuna was paired with a crispy sesame cracker and avacado mousse. I was also impressed by their coffee.  A table behind me was served their coffee whilst we were in the middle of our meal and the intoxicating aroma of rich, bold java coming from the mini french presses that it is served in teased my nostrils  I looked forward to ordering my own when it came time for dessert.

2009-02-26,5.0,"I made reservations almost two weeks ago, anticipating a rather horrendous work week and hoping a good meal would balance out the days.  Like I predicted, the week started off on a blue note, so I was really looking forward to dinner at Graham Elliot.  Alas, it was pouring outside and by the time I reached the restaurant, I looked like a drowned rat.  The host kindly took my coat and I waited at the bar for my friend to arrive.  Settling on the bar stool, the bartender got me a glass of cava and popcorn.  A bubbly and some salty snacks on the side?  Sweet. My friend arrived, soaking wet from the rain.  Notice the theme?  We were both unprepared, but the staff was very professional about it and seated us right away.  Our server for the night, Evan, dropped by to get us started.  He asked if we were familiar with Graham Elliot.  I mentioned it was our first time dining at the restaurant, but I've been following the guy since he captained Avenues - yeah, I'm a groupie.  From there, everything clicked and it was like Evan was a friend rather than a server. He offered the famous foie gras lollipops, even though they weren't featured on the menu.  I miss those suckers - thought I'd never get to try them again.  Blended with heavy cream and crusted with pop rocks, it was a great way to start off the evening.  From there, he suggested the blini, featuring lavender ice cream, tomato chutney and orange cream.  That was the one minor blip in the meal.  The combination was strange...and it just didn't work.  The lavender overpowered the blini and the smoked salmon tasted fairly bland.  However, the second appetizer, the saffron risotto, was fabulous.  Creamy, starchy goodness. Throughout the meal, Evan dropped by to check on what we liked and didn't.  It was great to have conversations with him regarding food.  The talks ranged from Graham Elliot's inspiration at the Art Institute, competition against Boka employees in football and the great Thomas Keller (whom he fondly refers to as ""TK"").  As the evening progressed, he offered up an interesting intermezzo.  It was essentially a s'more, but it featured olives!  The crunchy graham cracker, sweet and gooey marshmallow, and salty olives with hints of chocolate worked beautifully.  When he asked for feedback, my friend and I were positively beaming about it.  It's a small thing, no more than a square inch, but it's also a reference to childhood and simplicity.  By then, we were really quite full.  Unfortunately, we hadn't even gotten to our entrees. I ordered the shortrib au poivre.  It was encrusted with peppercorn, and served over a bed of barley and mushrooms.  The shortribs were tender and fell apart, even though I barely brushed my fork.  The savory, slightly spicy shortribs paired wonderfully with the rustic barley and earthy mushrooms.  Okay...I just noticed this is one looooong review.  Yes, I'm waxing poetic because this was one of the most entertaining dining experiences I've had. At the conclusion of the meal, there was a small takeout box containing caramel popcorn?  All I know is that it was such a sweet gesture because he knew we were way too full to order any dessert.  The meal came up to be about $150 (this includes the $30 tip we gave).  I wouldn't mind dropping by again, especially because it's been a while since I last had a meal that's left me feeling giddy.",0.9981,0.801,0.166,0.033,0.525232683982684

2009-02-24,5.0,"I've recently had my third experience at Graham Elliot and am kicking myself for not having written this earlier. The first time I visited the place the food was good, the ambiance decent, and the presentation a so-so; I would have said 3.5 stars. However, my last two meals have been phenomenal. It's tucked away in the River North area, somewhat hidden by the building's understated fascia. Entering the restaurant is quite pleasant with the host/hostess podium being quaint. They've had various spices stewing on a hot-plate up front, wafting a nice scent around the space. Nice touch! The bar is directly to the left and offers seating for maybe 12 or so. I'm not really a big drinker but the mixologists were very helpful with beer suggestions. The waitstaff (Jim S. and Jim B. in particular) are very knowledgeable about the cuisine and it shows in their detailed descriptions of the cuisine and subtleties in meal component taste. The rest of the staff was friendly and seemed like they cared about their work. The only thing I might suggest is larger water glasses so they don't have to come and fill mine so often; I pour more water in my gullet, than spills over Niagara. The decor is very warm, a lot of chocolaty browns and earthy goodness are used throughout. Red, green and orange lights hang above, adding a nice splash of color. One of the interesting interior design features is their wall, inset into them are shadow boxes with inlaid mirrors; they have various yellow objects inside(oranges, lemons, candles) that reflect infinitely, they seem to change seasonally as well. It's a little touch that lets you know something will be different with every visit. The room is divided down the center by a chest high partition, it seems to afford a little more privacy than an open floorplan. You don't feel too crowded by other diners and noise levels aren't outrageous. The waitstaff dress is really down to earth; jeans, a brown shirt, and maybe some Chucks. On to the food! Forget bread, this place brings you popcorn, each time it's been spiced different. We had some garlic popcorn which didn't last too long at our table. I'm normally a bread lover, but I find the popcorn to be lighter and more accessible to those new to fine dining.  The menu nicely updates itself seasonally. For the first course I tried the Potato-leek terrine and my friends had the oyster flight. The potatoes and leeks were perfectly cooked, the salad with it added a nice acid. It was also served with frothy potato shot; incredibly creamy with a little hit of salt. I was told that the four preparations of oysters were amazing as well. My entree was a Monkfish Wellington, I've never personally heard of a fish being used in a Wellington, but hey let's take a crack at it. Presentation has really stepped up since my first visit. There were black lentils and a perfectly done celeriac puree at the base. The fish is wrapped in a filo dough, though it was slightly soggy in some parts but overall very light and buttery, I wondered if it was made on site, as it's very labor intensive. The fish was very flaky and had a great taste, it was dense with with slight sweetness.  My friends ordered, pork belly with grits and an egg on top (heart attack food), salmon with a spicy red sauce and lamb-chops over cous cous which was thought to be particularly well cooked. There was a dessert amuse bouche of hot chocolate with a homemade marshmallow. Wow... who decided to put this rich chocolate mouth magic in a cup? Velvety with just a hint of bitteress in the after-taste. My dessert was a banana french toast with a cinnamon ice cream, very good but a little underwhelming when compared to the desserts my friends chose. Chocolate Chocolate Chocolate was what both of the girls ordered, the name alone hooked them. It consisted of three beignets, each with a different filling, alongside a spoon of chocolate ice cream with what tasted like a Cookie Crisp (yeah, the cereal). One of us was from Louisiana and thought the beignets were just as how he remembers from back home, except with a chocolate kick. They were crisp and moist, the raspberry filling being the favorite. Last, was the Pineapple Ravioli, wafer thin pineapple slices taking the position of the pasta. I didn't get a good sample of the actual ravioli but did taste the candied cilantro which was spectacular, the sweetness melted in your mouth, finishing with a light cilantro taste, very clever! Prices are reasonable and about what you'd expect for a mid-range fine dining experience. With drinks and three courses for four people the bill was just over $200. I'd say this is a good place for someone that's not really a foodie; it lacks the usual pretentiousness and a lot of the food has a familiar home cooking element to it.

2009-02-23,2.0,"My fiance and I were anxious to try this spot, as we love dining out all over the city and watch a lot of Top Chef.  Graham Elliot looked promising and modern, so we admittedly went in with high hopes for a delicious meal. Our server was very nice, attentive.  They have a very interesting cocktail menu so I asked which he would suggest.  He said the Pixie was incredible so I was immediately sold.  I received my drink and it tasted like unsweet grapefruit, tequila, and water.    VERY disappointing.  I couldn't even finish it. The server then brought popcorn to the table instead of bread or whatnot.  This really set the tone for dinner.  Graham Elliot is more interested in being funky and unique than actually making your dining experience a delicious one.  The popcorn was good - but it was popcorn.  It gets stuck in your teeth.  It is teh exact opposite of how I would like to being a fine dining experience. We gave this place a shot and ordered lots off the menu.  They had fois gras lollipops as a special so we ordered them to see what it was about.  It was fois gras on a stick with pop rocks on the edges.  yes pop rocks.  it was weird. Then we got the oyster flight - which was OK.  Certainly nothing to write home about.  We got the short rib sliders which were on special.  This was the highlight of the night - which doesnt say much considering I could have gotten the same thing but better at English or any bar in the city.  We also got the risotto - which was bland.  None of this food is seasoned properly.  Good food makes you want to keep eating it, it shouldnt feel like a chore. Since we were so underwhelmed by this whole experience, we decided to split an entree.  We ordered the monkfish at the suggestion of our server.  It was incredibly bland and nearly inedible.  Very very disappointed. At the end, the server brought us a complimentary cup of hot chocolate from the chef.  It was delicious.  A tiny sip of very rich chocolate with a dried cherry and a marshmallow.  We decided to go to NoMi for dessert instead of stay there and be disappointed any longer. this place is highly overrated, and really not worth your time.",0.9938,0.777,0.172,0.051,0.5811656746031747

Why can't I give it 5 stars?  The only thing that was distracting, rather than enhancing the meal, was the music.  Granted, I love 80's music, but it was just too loud.  At a restaurant at this price point, I really don't think it's necessary to create this sort of vibe AND I shouldn't have to ask to turn it down.  This one gripe, though, shouldn't detract you from trying this fantastic food.",0.9981,0.716,0.269,0.015,0.6876446492575525

2009-02-01,5.0,"There are lots of restaurants in Chicago that get by simply because of their location. There are others that get by for a little while on the Chef's name and being the ""hot spot."" Finally, there are some that succeed because they deliver or over deliver on expectations. Graham Elliot is the latter. Background: Dinner on a Friday night - 8:30 p.m. Here's my breakdown of basic components: Overarching theme - Unique new American cuisine.  Food - Everything we tried was delicious. The chef lets the ingredients shine without over seasoning. The flavor combinations may seem odd, but they work perfectly.  Loved the saffron risotto - the big surprise in this dish was the crispy calamari. The flavor balanced with the other ingredients and while visually you could tell it was fried calamari, the breading was unbelievably light, letting the flavor of the calamari shine. I could go on and on about each dish, but for the sake of brevity, I'm stopping at one review. Service - AMAZING. The server was attentive without being over bearing. New his wines, what they paired well with, and was clearly passionate about the food. He was very familiar with all the intricacies of a menu that had been out just over a week and made great suggestions. If there is one component of the total experience that out shined all others it was the service. Wine / Cocktails - They had some very unique cocktails, although we stuck to wine this night. The bottle list is limited and very expensive (I want to say $200+ a bottle). We stuck to wine by the glass where you can stay between $9 and $14. The wine was delicious. I'm a big red wine drinker, but decided to follow the servers suggestions on whites and wasn't disappointed. Decor - Stylish without trying too hard. Tables are somewhat close, but turned out not to be an issue. Good for a date or a smaller group dinner -- Once you get up over 8 people I can see space being an issue.  Cost - This is a high quality restaurant. For the quality of the experience I think it's a great value. No entrees over $33. Wine by the glass was typically priced. Wine by the bottle was expensive. If I could change one thing I wish they would offer some $50 - $90 bottles. You can definitely go all out at Graham Elliot for a lot less $$ than some of Chicago's other top restaurants. Selection - Yes, the menu is on the shorter side. However, it seems the theme of this restaurant is ""do fewer things and do them very, very well.""",0.9968,0.812,0.16,0.028,0.5495912614517265
2009-01-13,1.0,"One word.....DIS-GUS-TING!!!!! I've read multiple reviews about this place, and have heard people constantly talking about it saying it is amazing. I just don't get it. Just because the waitstaff are rude and obnoxious,  the hostess pretends you need a reservation even though the restaurant is always 90% empty, or that you end up paying at least a $100 a person doesn't make this place GOOD!!! The cocktails are over priced, and watered down. The risotto appetizer was tasteless and boring. The swordfish entree tasted like some overdone wedding meal. The duck entree was literally inedible. It was so tough that I could not cut it with the knife at the table, I had to actually ask for another utensil. Also it should be noted the only other thing on the plate was one brussel sprout cut into 4 pieces, thats it. Lastly, we ordered the pumpkin creme brulee and the reconstructed snickers bar. Umm how can a supposedly high end restaurant dare serve creme brulee straight from the freezer?? No burnt sugar crunching on top, just sloppy runny old pre-burnt then frozen top. HORRIBLE. And the snickers bar was something a 5th grader could have concocted in home ec. This place is seriously a joke. After experiencing such a disgusting array of foods, I went back to some of the people that raved about GE and found that really not one person had actually been there. Its just sad that because of the GE name, people are putting this place up on a pedestal. Hopefully reality will  hit soon, and this place will be seen for what it is, a total rip-off!!!",-0.7712,0.816,0.082,0.102,0.5323835125448029

She had the skate wing and I had the swordfish. Normally I'm wary of things like swordfish because the tend to be overpriced and not enough food. That was not the case here.

2008-12-20,1.0,"In case you missed it, Graham Elliot Bowles told The Tribune his biggest pet peeve about diners is yelp. Here's the link:  chicagotribune.com/featu…   Well now I can see why. People might actually tell the truth! But I wasn't going to hold that against him. I mean a good restaurant is a good restaurant. I like food. And drinks. I just don't like paying through the nose for average food and horrible service. Here's a quick rundown on the food, in case you don't believe me and decide to eat there: Popcorn: I don't know. We didn't get any! This was the start of the joke of a dining experience we had at GE. It wasn't until we were mid-entree that we noticed people that walked in after us were given popcorn upon arrival. Then we remembered that annoying popping sound on the website and realized we'd been had! Chopin's Prelude cocktail: Nothing special. Had a pickled potato at the bottom, but that certainly didn't make or break it. If there was some sort of complex flavor combo, I didn't taste it. Considering they literally had someone's name with the title ""mixologist"" on the menu, you'd think they'd nail this shit all day. Oysters: Disgusting. After only a couple attempts at eating raw oysters, I've realized I simply can't do it without a bunch of horseradish and cocktail sauce, so this really isn't the fault of the restaurant. I guess I shouldn't have taken part in this order, but I heard something about champagne foam and got sold like an old shoe. Graham topped all 4 (srsly? $11 for 4 oysters?) with a different topping for each, so I only tried 2, but both should have been featured in the magazine Nasty Nast Traveler. Risotto app: Pretty good, but a very small portion. Had some sausage and fresh basil which was nice. It was topped with cheese, which I thought was kind of cheating. I mean, I could put cheese on cigarette butt and it would taste good. I'm actually messing around in the kitchen and making risotto for breakfast now btw. I'll let you know how it turns out later in the review. Crispy pheasant with foie gravy: This was the main course that all the servers seemed to rave about. I guess it's a play on chicken and waffles. The foie gras flavor in the small amount of gravy they gave me was all but absent. The pheasant was crispy and good, but really? This is the best you've got? This is a $16 entree priced at $35.  After our entrees, we were so annoyed we decided to skip dessert. Just then we finally received our second round of cocktails that we'd ordered literally 25 minutes prior and had to ask for twice. I'll race anybody that thinks it takes half that amount of time to make a dirty martini. Our waiter was unapologetic as he delivered them just after our plates were cleared.  We asked for the check, and he screwed that up too. More waiting. Now generally, as long as I'm getting what I order, my attitude can best be described as something along the lines of, ""I just don't give a fuck,"" but this was the worst service I've ever had at a restaurant. No joke. And when you're paying $80/person before tip, your expectations tend to raise a little. So I decided to do something I've never done before, I asked to speak to the manager. Pal, who claims to be the GM, introduced himself and handed us a business card with his name WRITTEN on it. Ok, first off dude, you're the GM of a nice restaurant charging exorbitant prices. Someone needs to pony up for some business cards with your name actually printed on them.  We explained our horrible experience with our server to him, and rather than you know, doing anything about it or saying he'd talk to the waiter, he said something like, ""This is a very good restaurant, we hope to see you again soon for a better experience."" What? So I said, ""Well at this point I have no plans to come back. We paid a lot of money and had a bad experience. Why would I come back?"" I was pretty mad at this point. I figured he'd hand me a gift certificate or something which I'd probably tear up on throw on the ground on or give to someone, but no.  ""I'm sorry, and we'll look forward to seeing you again."" Wow, Pal, if there were a customer service class, you would have aced it buddy. Next time I hear a restaurant is ""unassuming' or ""playful"" I'll know the English translation for that is ""classless ripoff"". This place should change it's name to Bowles Movement, because they treat you like shit.  Anyway, enough about GE. Reliving the memory of last night is giving me diarrhea and hypertension. On to happier topics, like a risotto update. I just fucking rocked that. Mushrooms, bacon, egg whites, truffle salt, and cheddar. Yeah, I cheated too.

2008-12-12,4.0,"Graham Elliot's is pretty good.  We started with italian sausage risotto, which reminded me of a chicago-style Italian sausage sandwich with peppers.  The rice representing the bread.  The sausage was delicious, I wished there was more of it.  We also had the potato bisque which was poured table-side over shredded cheddar cheese, bacon, and a chive-coated marshmallow.  What made this dish distinct was the marshmallow which slowly melted into the soup, giving it a sweetness to contrast the decidedly savory soup.  My complaint with this dish was that some of the cubed potatoes at the bottom were unevenly cooked, and I felt that some spiciness was needed to add an additional component. For my entree I had the scallops which were seared perfectly--caramelized on the top and just cooked enough through the middle.  Maple syrup and bourbon sauce accompanied along with butternut squash puree and oatmeal.  As a textural contrast, swiss chard stems were scattered on top of the oatmeal.   My girlfriend had the monkfish wellington.  The best part of this dish was the classic presentation of the french lentils, mirepoix, and white truffle powder.  The fish itself was a bit dry inside the puff pastry and sang second fiddle to the other components on the dish.  I would have preffered a ""deconstructed"" wellington with puff pastry on the side and the fish cooked perfectly in a skillet.   For dessert we shared a huge deconstructed snickers bar.  Which was delicious and amazing.  However, it was still a bar, it wasn't really deconstructed except for the caramel salt ice-cream on the side.  While I enjoyed the flavors of the desert immensely, I found myself wanting more creativity in conceptual design of the dish. As for the cocktails, they were delicious and creative.  ""Cranberries"" with homemade cranberry sauce, vodka, and flamed orange peel?  yessir.  and the blueberry-slushy style drink was great as well, garnished with effervescent blueberries.  Nicely done. All in all, I'd like to come back for the seasonally changing menu and try more.  Greatness has not yet been achieved here, but i wouldn't be surprised if it gets better.",0.9858,0.861,0.129,0.01,0.5132882882882882

I tasted almost everyone's entrees, the monkfish was good, the skate wing was good.  The beef tenderloin was so overly smoky I couldn't finish the small bite my friend shared with me.   For dessert, we shared the green apple fritters and the deconstructed Snickers bar.

We arrived a few minutes before our reservation and were told that our table wasn't quite ready. We headed up to the busy not not packed bar and waited....and waited over 15 minutes for service. In that time we snagged a neighbor's drink menu, talked to some other people who were also waiting for drinks (they had already eaten and told us the food was not so good) and watched as the  bartenders ran around frantically.

Everything came out in two rounds of food.  The ceasar salad was fine, but the dressing, which I guess might be called delicate, bordered on bland. The twinkie toasts were good but the rest wasn't. The goat cheese risotto was also mediocre, I can make better at home. The foie gras was outstanding though, a mousse layered on top of a long rice krispie treat. Now this was the ""whimsical"" presentation and exceptional food I had expected.  Next came the potato cheese soup (tasted like it came from a can), buffalo chicken (I can make a chicken breast with hot sauce on it at home) and the autumn squash gnocchi (again, utterly lacking in any major flavors). At this point we were done, we decided to skip dessert and contemplated whether we should complain. As another review mentioned, you feel bad complaining when it looks like you ate it all, but of course divide a tiny dish into 4 and each person gets 1-2 bites, enough to determine they don't like it.  What clinched it was when I went into the unisex single-stall bathroom as a server was coming out, to find that there was pee on the seat, tp in the unflushed toiltet, and the roll of tp was empty (though there were stacks of fresh rolls right there). Seriously?  So we called the manager over and explained our troubles. From the ridiculous service at the bar to the bland and boring food (with the only exception being the foie gras) to the bathroom incident, we were extremely dissapointed in the whole experiences. He listened and seemed very concerned. He mentioned that the menu was new and that maybe some changes needed to be made and said our food would be comped.  Of course the bill came and that first round that was supposed to be on the house, was on the bill. I didn't realize the server was nearby and pointed it out to my friends. She overheard and aplogized and brought back a bill for $40 (on which we tipped $60).  Nothing was horrible, but nothing was very good. With the exception of the foie gras, oh and the truffle salted popcorn, it was so bland and tasteless. When small entrees are in the $30 range and apps are $15-ish, I was expecting so much more.  If the menu changes I'll try it again. But as it stands now, it's definately not worth the hype.",0.9793,0.855,0.089,0.056,0.5496606213651668
2008-09-20,3.0,"I have a few issues with this restaurant. Yes, the atmosphere was casual (servers in jeans) and modern (not my thing), but the service was definitely not top-notch - it went tumbling downhill when we were no longer 1 of 2 tables for our server, and the food was utterly disappointing, with a couple of exceptions.   The wine list had a good range of options for both white & red, and we were satisfied with our pinot noir. Our popcorn was brown butter.  Good but not earth-shattering. We started our meal with the risotto and gnocchi.  The risotto was completely under-cooked and bland.  It was kind of like this: I took 1 bite, uhm...I can't eat the rest of this, but since the portions are SO small, half of the serving is gone, so how shady is it to send something back that is half eaten?  So I dealt with it and had the BF eat the rest.  These chefs should watch that episode of Hell's Kitchen when Ramsey chews out his chefs for undercooked risotto - isn't that a cardinal sin?   The gnocchi was also very bland - and I felt the textures were way off.  And this ""fall gnocchi"" does not come with an egg.  Sadness. Our entrees were better than the appetizers.  We had the scallops and the pork belly.  There were good parts and not-so-good parts to both entrees.  The root beer bbq sauce was unique and candy-like.  The oatmeal, not so much. Then after waiting 25 minutes to order dessert (the service was good up to this point), I decided on the deconstructed snicker's bar - with no help from our server.  This was the one and only time I asked for her opinion, and she had nothing.  Our dessert arrived fairly quickly, but the smashing pumpkin drink didn't get to our table until we had polished off the dessert.  Then our server gave us some lame-ass excuse about how the drink is so labor intensive to make.  Uhm, I can see right through you, you forgot.  The 180 degree move you made when you realized you forgot completely gave it away. All in all, I don't need my food to be fun and playful with play-on words.  I need it to taste good and feel that money was well spent.  I don't regret my Graham Elliot experience, but I highly doubt I'll be back.",0.991,0.82,0.138,0.041,0.4848249299719888
2008-09-19,4.0,"Following GEB for a bit, I had high expectations of his new restaurant. Actually so much so that I saved it for my last dinner in Chicago. I can say that it was a great experience, but still left me wanting more. Popcorn: Delicious, nice touch Caesar: I actually was hesitant on ordering this over some of the more substantial and potentially richer flavored dishes, but after seeing it so much I went with it and was not disappointed. First off, it was huge. Secondly beautifully, and deliciously, put together. The Brioche Twinkie Crouton was one of, if not the best thing I tasted. Gnocchi: Delicious, not too light, not to soft (maybe not the way everyone likes it, but I do) with a delicious sauce. Small portion, but gnochhi usually is. Risotto: The thing I was most looking forward to...also the most disappointing. It just didn't work for me, the dish had all very sharp tastes, that just didn't blend well (esp the apples.) Also a small portion Short Rib (I think, some sort of meat): Delicious...perfectly cooked, tender and delicious. Great value as well, this could have easily been my entire meal. Dessert: Very solid showing in the dessert dept....I have no idea what it was, but it was good Drinks: Solid selection, pretty much what you would expect from a restaurant like this. Service: Was pretty decent until I got very upset over the fact that he offered an off menu item to the table next to us and not us. I don't have a problem with not offering it to us, but don't tell the table one foot away about. That was upsetting and offputting in my book. With the service faux paus and the misstep in the risotto, I can't give it five stars. I can't give it three stars on the pure fact that GEB is a phenomenal chef, so we arrive at 4. Bottomline: Great dinner, highly recommended if you are looking for a high end date, or a GROUP to share, and want a creative, yet also delicious experience. It can be on the pricey side, so be careful with the ordering of dishes, as I said there are dishes that are filling.

Wow is the expression that I use for Graham Elliot.  I was impressed with the technique and combinations of nouveau cuisine and good old fashion american food.  Who would have thought to use twinkies for croutons and adding cheez-its to risotto.   Every dish was a party in my mouth.  I ordered the stroganoff, on a dreary, cold rainy night, perfect for warming the soul.  The spare rib -- a monstrous portion - crumbled as it was pierced by my fork.  Scooped up with a couple egg noodles and polished off with a nice dollop of cream.   Each dish was complimented by the wine recommendation from the server.  Kangeralli Rd. Shiraz-viognier from McClaren Valley, Australia.  Let me tell you, I was skeptical.  A Shiraz-Viognier blend?   Absolutely an experience, from the pizza flavor popcorn to the inventive menu, the knowledgeable staff and finally a warm and inviting ambiance.  Still trying to figure out how the ""Warhol-esque theme and lemons"" fit in to the minimalist design"".  But another time, another meal.  bon appetitie,",0.9876,0.794,0.181,0.025,0.6411764705882353

The funny thing is, I saw people go in there with shorts and t-shirts I wouldn't clean my bathtub with. Without trying to come off as a snob, I asked the waitress what the code was, and she said Chef Elliot wanted everyone to experience his restaurant. I thought that was nicely put, though it made me wish I had worn my jeans instead of my other, fancier duds. As for the food, there were playful adaptations of a buffalo wing (thigh meat with a zesty buffalo sauce and slaw made of celery root, plus Budweiser foam) and a good risotto made with, of all things, Cheez-Its. Fun and not forced -- I like that kind of imagination. The entrees we had were all good, starting with my lamb and lentil dish that was herby, tender and pretty memorable. Before your meal, the chef served flavored popcorn; on our night, it was ""malt vinegar,"" which only added to the British pub-meets-fine dining feel. Both desserts were tasty, too.

The service, presentation, atmosphere, etc were all top notch.  A friend and I went last night and I prepped him with nothing but great things to expect. He wasn't disappointed at all. However, I was. Not tremendously - but enough that I will  feel good about recommending highly to others but not go back (at least for a while) myself.  I think part of the problem was that my food selection was fairly similar to my first experience. We started with the Caesar salad with white anchovies which was delicious again. For the hot appetizer, we had the truffle gnocchi with asparagus and fried egg (first time around we had the cheese risotto which was fabulous) - the gnocchi was a bit underwhelming, and although tasty didn't really leave me wanting more. On my first visit, I had the short rib stroganoff for entree. I was planning on trying something else this time around - namely the lamb, however, our server was honest in saying that it was his least favorite item on the menu and had been ""problematic"". I opted for the stroganoff again, and while still delicious it didn't have the same UMPF! as it did on my first visit. Some things in life are best on the first go around and never seem to live up subsequently, and this dish fell into that category.  We finished off with the chocolate brownie with peanut butter ice cream and crushed malt balls which was fantastic and a great way to end the meal. If I reviewed GE after my first visit I would have given it 5 stars - I still feel its a 5 star recommendation for others, it just lost a little bit for me on my second visit.",0.9588,0.814,0.12,0.066,0.4532113821138212

Nobody ended up sharing our table either!  It's nice that they have options for those of us who are slackers in the planning ahead department.  There are 3 long tables that seat between 6-10 people each.  The decor is excellent.  Now for the food. We started with the ceasar salad which was absolutely delicious.  The portion was appropriate, fabulous twinkie croutons and the anchovies topped it off nicely.  I had 2 more appetizers for my main course- truffled potato gnocchi and aged cheddar risotto.  The gnocchi were light, but substantial enough to stand up to the fried egg on top.  When mixed all together, per the waiter's suggestion, it was a very balanced dish.  The cheddar risotto was decent, but nothing I would crave or go back for. Fiance's main course was the rack of pork with root beer bbq sauce, mango chutney, grits, collard greens and a corn-nut crust.  We had to get it for the sole reason it had corn nuts in it and fiance loved it.  The corn nuts definitely added some good texture.  The waiter suggested a spanish tempranillo which was perfect.   It became one of our new favorite reds.

I liked the modern, yet relaxed atmosphere. I liked that and our waiter provided us with top notch service throughout the evening.  And i really liked my summer nectar (at least that's what I think it was called?) margarita-like drink. Oh, and I liked the dessert...but more about that later. Both my husband and I found the food to be just OK.  Instead of bread Graham Elliot brought a bowl of sour cream and chive popcorn to the table, which I thought was a cute touch...and we also happen to be huge popcorn fans! However, I found the popcorn to be a bit bland tasting, which is surprising for sour cream and chive popcorn! We ordered the Carribean shrimp as our appetizer- nothing special there either in this tiny portion of shrimp and 3 plantain chips. As for our entrees I had planned ahead and checked out Graham Elliot's menu and of course the Yelp reviews. I was looking forward to those scallops other yelpers had raved about, but was disappointed to see they weren't on the menu.  The waiter mentioned the menu changes quite frequently, which is nice and all, but Graham....update your web site too! Instead both my husband and I ordered the wahoo entree. We wanted to each get something different, but it was really the only entree on the menu that appealed to us. The fish itself was pretty bland, but once you dipped it in all the sauces on the plate as our waiter instructed us to do so) I found it to be tasty. However, my husband had a good point- if the server has to tell you to make sure you dip it in all the sauces to get some flavor even he knew it was a bland dish. Dessert may have been Graham's saving grace.  We were about to split the carrot cake when my husband asked the waiter to bring us the brownie too. I asked him if this was because he knows I LOVE chocolate and he said ""no, it's because I'm still hungry from their tiny portions!"" So the carrot cake and brownie arrived and both were very good.  I only got one bite of the carrot cake my husband was hoarding, but the cream cheese filling was delicious!

2008-08-10,4.0,"I went here for a birthday/anniversary celebration with a good group of foodies - and I think we were pretty impressed, although there were things that could have been done differently. First off - the atmosphere is a tad annoying. Loud music with people talking loudly over the music. I'm not an old man, but it's nice to not have to scream at my dinner companions in order to be heard. There are hot and cold appetizers, entrees, and desserts - our server recommended we select one of each (right...) and could we please order all four items at the same time? I thought that was a bit odd - I've certainly been to restaurants where they were capable of handling my dinner and dessert orders separately, without a lot of advanced logistics. But that's a very minor complaint. Anyway, we indulged the server. For the cold appetizer, I had ahi tuna carpaccio, which was good, but lacked a lot of flavor. It had a good sauce, on the side, and some cold chick peas and roasted almonds - a good flavor compliment, but I wish the tuna was more flavorful. Others at my table had the deconstructed Caesar salad, with awesome anchovies, accurate dressing, and ""brioche twinkie croutons,"" which I thought were seriously going to be twinkies...but were just very good Parmesan cheese filled little fried bread bits. There was also a beet salad, which I cannot comment on, not being a beet fan. It was reportedly delicious. My hot was aged cheddar risotto - delicious. Served with matchsticked sour green apple, chewy bacon, lots of black pepper, cheez-it crackers (seriously) and ""red apple paint"" as a decoration. The paint was actually very apple tasting, and was good if you rubbed your spoonful of risotto through it. 5 stars for the risotto. Others had an artichoke bisque, which was good, but not terrific, although it did have a great fried onion centerpiece, and a gnocchi dish, which was far too salty, but would have been awesome. Finally, a buffalo chicken dish was unimpressive...sort of a waste of an appetizer. For the main course, my duck breast was spectacular, but the winner was the braised short rib stroganoff - a massive helping of the most tender, moist short ribs I've ever had...just melt in your mouth. Big globs of black pepper creme fraiche, tender noodles...oh, man, it was awesome. Root beer BBQ pork chops were interesting...but I don't think we would order them again. My dessert was a very simple carrot cake, with just carrots in the batter, an an almost unsweetened cream cheese icing filling. Really delicious in it's simplicity. Others had a peanut butter brownie that was awfully tasty. So, a couple miscues on some dishes...maybe could have a better atmosphere for an expensive meal. The place is supposed to be fun and trendy, hence the bar/noise, and the cheez-it crackers. So I can forgive it. All in all, definitely worth a try.

2008-08-06,5.0,"I may be cursing myself with this preemptive notion, but I do believe Graham Elliot has opened himself the best new restaurant of the year. With such a fantastic blend of casual dining, world class service and couture 'bistronomic' cuisine, GE is making fine dining not only fun, but completely accessible to the masses. No more suit coats, no more high heels (unless you live and die by them, like moi)... throw out your collar stays because you'll be more comfortable here in your Chucks than in Ferragamos, guaranteed.  While the ambiance at Graham Elliot is certainly classy with muted dark woods, white tablecloths and low lighting, you'll find a balance of fun in the small details like fresh fruit as art, peppy servers donning jeans and pumas and a soundtrack to dine by that ranges from Radiohead to The Polyphonic Spree. Chic indeed, provided you have good taste in food and music. Natch.  The menu is pared down but well rounded. With only 4 choices in each category (cold small pates, hot small plates, sea, land) you'll quickly find you have everything here that you need for an impeccable culinary journey. Though the offerings do change daily there always appears to be a version of the fan favorites like the Aged Cheddar Risotto complete with real Cheez-It crackers and Wisconsin bacon or the Kobe Beef Tartare topped with a smoked gelato that tastes fresh off the grill, amazing!! Weber eat your smokin' heart out, amateurs.  You'll find the small plates to be just that, small. There is enough for a couple bites to be shared between a couple, but any more than that and you're fighting for morsels as we found in our group of four. The order of Truffled Potato Gnocchi complete with heavy-handed truffle oil and a rich, fried egg was literally battled over. There simply wasn't enough. At one point I tried hiding the plate under my dress which still wasn't a sufficient deterrent from flying forks trying to get a last stab of gnocchi heaven. Ever seen a girl practically made into swiss cheese while dining? Two orders next time.  Our remaining small plates were also fought over, but nothing stood out quite like that gnocchi. I was a bit disappointed to see a deconstructed caesar salad brought to our table... I had expected to see the same artful presentation which is highlighted on the GE website, but one bite of those delightful and decadent twinkie croutons quickly quelled me on the subject. Moving on to the 'big show', three of the large plates proved to be enough for my table of four, fortunately. Again we all found a singular (and yet again squabbled over) table standout. The pan-roasted skate stacked high on a creamy polenta cake and dressed in brown butter was incredible. It melted smoothly in my mouth and was the perfect combination of sweet and savory. An ideal dish. Like George Clooney on a plate. Only far less arrogant. The short rib stroganoff was equally as delicious to me and super satisfying - great soul food!! The only dish that felt a little off for me was the pork prime rib... cooked well, moist and tender I enjoyed everything (especially the accompaniment of artisan grits) but the crust on the pork was insanely salty. Too salty even for me, Lil' Miss Pretzel Licker... my friends seemed not to be bothered by it, but I doubt I'd order this dish again.   Nothing beats saving room for dessert and be sure you do at Graham Elliot!!! Chef took every measure to make sure the sweets stood up to the bold flavors of the main dishes. We sampled three desserts, each one better than next... I can't stress it enough, set aside some extra treadmill time and go for the glory!! The molten carrot cake and dark chocolate brownie were both ahhh inspiring and super decadent but none was as unique or impressive as the corn frozen custard with salted toffee, blackberries and freeze-dried corn crumble.

I was also excited to try the signature cocktails so I ordered two.  I was disappointed when I finished the first one, and the waiter didn't ask me if I wanted another for over 20 minutes.  This was especially frustrating since our entrees arrived immediately after we finished the starters.  It would have been nice if they could have paced the meal a little bit better and if our waiter could have been a touch more attentive.  He was pretty much MIA for the entire meal. We decided not to stay for dessert.  I'm sorry, for the price of the meal, the service and food should have been something to remember.  It wasn't.  I'm still disappointed.",0.8258,0.763,0.14,0.097,0.6547395833333333

If you go to the website, you'll notice that it has popcorn, and now you'll know why :).  We ordered the beef tartare, cheez it risotto, gnocchi.. Gnocchi was hands down the best, and we could have skipped the beef tartare.   I ordered the pork prime rib, which was the best entree of the night! It was HUGE (think porterhouse huge), and it wasn't overcooked! It was tender and juicy on the inside, and I loved the grits and collard greens on the side.  The big surprise though, was that it was glazed with a root beer bbq - what a pleasant surprise! Others ordered the beef short rib stroganoff; short ribs were tender, stroganoff was ok- overall dish was just average. The hubby had a fish, and it was just bland and boring.  Another person was vegetarian, and they were able to whip out a very nice polenta/vegetarian dish.   We were stuffed and opted out of dessert.

I had the pleasure of taking a picture with him - he's so humble and personable -- which is always nice.   Sure, this restaurant isn't perfect, but I do appreciate that Graham Elliot is innovative and incorporates everyday snacks in his food, and makes it tasty!  I have two upcoming dinners here, so am excited to try more.",0.9966,0.745,0.221,0.034,0.6317294567294569

The room is subdued, with dark wood and golden lighting on brick walls, on which hung picture boxes full of lemons. It's a loud space, so if it's a refined, intimate dinner you need, look elsewhere-this is more of a pre-bar/club crowd. Service was spot on.

The food. That is why we're here, no? I enjoyed the food. The amuse of Parmigiana Reggiano truffle popcorn was fun. The Caesar salad was again fun, with Brioche Twinkie-style ""crouton"" cubes filled with Caesar dressing. The ahi tuna carpaccio was okay. The slices of tuna were so paper thin that they almost lost their flavor. The dish was served with garbanzo relish, crispy Serrano, and marcona almonds with a pimento foam that I had a hard time remembering as pimento. The skate with polenta cake, caper chutney and baby spinach was done just right, and tasted great. The highlight of the meal was the poached salmon, BLT style, served with frisee, heirloom tomato and pancetta vinaigrette. This one was awesome and the big piece of fish melted in my mouth. Deserts were phenomenal, and worth saving room for - did I mention the molten carrot cake? This was a great meal and a fun time. I feel like I should have ordered a few different starters as opposed to getting an entree because a lot of the starters looked more appealing to me than the entree, so consider splitting a bunch of them if you feel the same way. The bar is smallish, and there isn't a lot of room to hang out, but we were seated right away and this wasn't a concern for us. Toward the end of our meal I saw Chef Bowles conferring with his dining room manager and working the room. I'm going back now that I have a better game plan laid out.

2008-07-10,5.0,"Graham Elliot isn't perfect, but it is seriously verrrrrry good. I went on a Wednesday night with my boyfriend and an out-of-town friend with high standards, and we all came away pleased. From food to service to ambience, this restaurant (despite being on the spendy side) strives to be stylish but unpretentious, and for the most part succeeds. FOOD:  GE pretty much lives up to its hype and the food is the reason to come.  The dishes are inventive, but despite the flourishes of molecular gastronomy, whiz-bang techniques and xantham gum wizardry take a backseat to creating flavorful, satisfying dishes.  Our dishes ranged from really good to exquisite and they managed to be luxurious and accessible at the same time. Here are some recommendations: (Appetizer) Cheddar risotto with green apple, bacon, and Cheez-its - this was the winner of the night- a wonderful mix of sweet and salty in a perfect risotto, and, surprisingly, the Cheez-its are not a gimmick!  They add a great tangy crunch.  MAKE YOUR RESERVATION NOW AND EAT THIS. (Appetizer) Truffled potato gnocchi with roasted asparagus - this was a close second.  Soft, pillowy, perfect, heavenly gnocchi. (Main) Skate with spinach, polenta cake, and raisin compote - wow, this was great.  The fish was flavorful, and the raisins are an inspired addition. (Main) Short rib stroganoff with egg noodles and cremini mushrooms - the meat was amazing- silky, melty, delicious.  The egg noodle and mushroom side wasn't super interesting, but nothing wrong with it either! (Dessert) Vanilla bean semifreddo with pineapple, coconut, and ginger - really nice combination of flavors and the semifreddo was done really well with a lovely texture. (Bread... sort of) GE doesn't give you bread.  Instead they give you popcorn with brown butter and sugar and lemon zest.  I'm not sure how well it works as a bread substitute if you've got a hankering for bread, but it's tasty and fun nonetheless.  I recommend going for the brownest, buttery-est pieces before your dinner companions get to them) AMBIANCE: Again, stylish but unpretentious. The waiters have their signature Chucks, and the room is decorated with fresh lemons. There's lots of amber wood and warm amber light and it's not too dark.  The music isn't the standard ambient lounge stuff that you'd expect at a trendy place, but a mix that even throws in occasional 80s favorites from Springsteen and Howard Jones - definitely not Too Hip for You, even for the over-30s among us.  SERVICE: Service was friendly and casual but very capable and attentive. We felt at first that drinks were being pushed on us, especially the cocktail menu, as we'd barely had time to read it before being asked multiple times if we wanted anything off of it.  But this may also just reflect the general enthusiasm of the staff.  The waiter checked up on us several times, as did the maitre d' who came by to chat periodically (I found this pleasant, not annoying.)  Water was refilled, oh, every other minute or so. Which brings me to... BONUS! Hurray for GE and their sparkling water!  They have their own filtration system and carbonation machine and reusable bottles- soooo much more ecologically friendly than purchased bottled water (BTW, if you want this at home, Google on 'soda club usa'- we have one and we love it!).  PLUS they keep your bottle and your glasses filled, which means you get charged for ONE bottle ($5) no matter how much you drink!  Finally a restaurant that doesn't price gouge on bottled water. Given that we easily drank what could have amounted to $25-$30 worth of water at another restaurant, hats off to GE for having both environmental scruples and business scruples where bottled water is concerned.   Other restaurants should follow their example. PS: Graham Elliot Bowles & Staff, if you're reading this, please make a main course size of your cheddar risotto.  I will eat there every week if you do!",0.9995,0.737,0.23,0.034,0.6082057057057059

Yuck yuck and yuck. The food was so bad that we couldn't eat more than a few bites. We were completely shocked that a chef like Bowles would allow food to leave the kitchen tasting like it did.

2008-07-02,5.0,"A study in contrasts.  Yep.  That's what this newest addition to the River North dining scene is.  Graham Elliot is complicated while being simple, intimate while being crowded and plain while being fancy. Case in point- while the restaurant looks upscale and chic- the servers are dressed in jeans and sneakers.  I wasn't even sure, at first, if the bartender actually worked there or was a customer! The food was amazing.  We had the opportunity to taste a wide range of the menu.  The much talked about appetizer of popcorn (plain) showed up on schedule. However last night's flavor was curry coconut (fancy) not the much touted truffle flavor.  How did it fare?  The empty bowl was the only indicator of the amazing taste. For the appetizers, we split the sea scallops and the Kobe beef tartare.  Three jumbo scallops served with fresh peas and a sauce were absolutely delicious. Equally as impressive was the beef tartare. For our entrees, we had the beef rib stroganoff and the lamb.  The stroganoff was the winner with its wild mushrooms, homemade egg noodles and peppered sour cream.  The lamb was good and came with couscous but didn't differentiate from other lamb dishes I've had.  I fell in love last night though. No.  Not with a person, but with a dish. We ordered , as a side dish, the truffled potato gnocchi.  I may have just died and gone to heaven with this dish!  Gnocchi served with fresh asparagus, Romano cheese, truffle oil and a fried egg over the top that when you cut into it- the warm yolk runs throughout the dish.  If not heavenly, I don't know what is. Unless, of course, it was the dessert that we somehow found room for.  Picture this.  A warm brownie layered with house made peanut butter served with a caramelized banana, some type of ice cream and crushed malted milk balls on the plate.  We couldn't get enough of it! The wine list, while not large, is a bit of a challenge as you probably won't find anything you ""normally"" order. But the server is quick to suggest and, in our case, landed on the perfect wine to accompany our meal that was reasonably priced. If I had any suggestions at all it would be to reduce the noise level in the place.  With the exposed brick walls, open ceiling, solid surface floor, and closely placed tables, the place is quite loud to the point that it was difficult to hear our server at times even when he was standing next to us. So as we concluded our study in contrasts last night, we did conclude one thing for certain- that we would rather be coming into Graham Elliot for another delightful evening of food than leaving.  Oh well- there is always tomorrow.",0.9817,0.83,0.119,0.051,0.5186056998556999

Stick to the wine.  When I switched to that over food, I enjoyed more interesting stuff like a lovely glass of temparnillo. As we're watching our wedding waistlines, we had all apps.  We split the buffalo chicken.  (Don't.  It is too small to share.)  The Budweiser foam was ""eh"" but the rest would have been finger lickin' had a knife and fork not been involved.  Onto the salads: Caesar and beet.  The beet was nothing special, and the Caesar croutons with their hidden cheesy surprise were good except for the fact that only one crouton had this hidden goodness (surprise!), so I felt a little gypped. For our main courses, we had the risotto and the gnocchi.  The gnocchi was extremely good.  As for the risotto, well, I just couldn't get around the Cheez-its.  FH was in heaven, however, having just commented at Dominicks the previous day that he missed Cheez-Its.  (This was good because FH is generally a little more meat-and-potatoes, and I wasn't sure that he'd appreciate all the food-as-art stuff.  But he did.) We couldn't decide between two desserts, and so got the peach and the chocolate peanut butter.  The peach was entirely forgettable - and I'll give our waiter credit for gently trying to steer me away from it; I guess that I don't take hints - and I was slightly disappointed in the chocolate.  The brownie was more like a cookie.  Entirely crisp without any chewiness.   I felt like that service could have been a bit more attentive, but they appeared to be slightly understaffed that evening.   Overall, the experience was good, and I want to try it again.  Maybe drinks and hors d'oerves after work, as it is a fun scene.  I enjoyed my one visit to Avenues several years back, but Mr. Elliott does seem better suited to this type of atmosphere.  Oh yes, atmosphere....it was hip, despite the profusion of 50-somethings in sport coats, yelling over the loud rock and roll music.  There were quite a few young hipsters.  Nice to see that the place appealed to diverse population.  The decor was somewhat stark and modern-Scandinavian, but it worked well in the space.   I'm sure that we'll be back.",0.9983,0.772,0.199,0.029,0.5084142246642247

Overall I thought it was an awesome experience, some dishes just need a little work. I'll start off with what I liked the least and work my way back to what was the best. We started with the crab gazpacho. The bowl it came in, (although it looked nice) was very hard to eat out of. The soup was quite bland. I don't know, maybe it needed more curry foam. The next, surprised me it ranked so low on my list, was the cheez-it risotto. To me this also lacked some flavor. I was looking for something bolder when I tasted it. The next was the cesar. I would say from the cesar on... everything was very good just some stood out as the best. Obviously the famous parmesan twinkie was awesome. The beet salad was next and I actually thought that with the whipped goat cheese it was a little better than the cesar. The best 3 dishes came from the Hot section. The white truffle gnocchi was really good. Anything topped with a fried egg is good in my book. The buffalo chicken wing was awesome as well. I loved that it was a deconstructed version of the buffalo wing. The sauces that it came with were extremely tasty. And the number one thing we had was... (drum roll)...the Kobe Beef Tartare with smoked ice cream. Everything in this dish just really worked well together. The smoked ice cream put it over the top though. As everyone else said, you are served a bowl of the truffle oil popcorn which is really good. I need to figure out how to make that. For desert we had the peanut butter cup brownie. The desert was out of this world, could have used a little more ice cream for the very rich brownie though.

2008-06-22,5.0,"This place, start-to-finish, is designed for the trendy, thirty-something demographic:  Space - rough loft space with clean lines, warm colors, dark wood, modern furnishings.  Drinks - mixologist-caliber concoctions made with exotic juices and liquors, with care taken too be interesting but smooth (not too boozy-tasting).  Food - small-but-towering-on-a-big-plate interpretations of traditional ingredients combined to create a harmony of flavors that is unique in and of itself.  Music - 80's & early 90s pop and ""alternative"".  Attitude - casual & friendly.  Simple, one-word categories of food: cold, hot, sea land, sweet, snack, drink (just like your favorite 90's band!  And isn't brevity the real key to wit?). So - being a thirty-something, self-proclaimed foodie who hates anything snottily contrived - I felt very comfortable here.  When my husband called ahead to ask whether there was a dress-code (it was, after all, a little hard to get a reservation) the hostess informed him that dress-code was totally casual.  She suggested he show up in dirty swim trunks, a wife-beater-tank and flip-flops.  He told her he was thinking something a little more along the lines of assless chaps and a feather boa, to which she replied ""that sounds fabulous!""  (awesome).  The servers all don jeans, Chuck Taylors and brown t-shirts. I'm not much of a ""cocktail"" person anymore, but the ""special"" cocktails sounded so interesting I had to give them a try...my mom and I split: Pisco Criolla - pisco/aperol, summer strawberry, sparkling wine, rhubarb puree.  This pink drink, presented in a martini glass, was like a Cosmo for grown-ups. Oura Mino - leblon cachaca, golden fruit, muddled basil, ginger beer.  A mixologist's take on the mojito, this cocktail was light, refreshing with hints of melon and very interesting.  A perfect summer cocktail.  Both of these drinks are (as I imagine the rest are as well) HIGHLY dangerous as they are tasty and extremely smooth.  It's been 8 years since I've tended bar (at upscale joints) and I am TOTALLY (and happily) outta the loop.  I definitely prefer being on the other side of the bar. They also offer (though we didn't try) a short list of ""edible"" cocktails: Bloody Mary, Bellini, Pina Colada & Spanish Sangria.  Booze in ice or gelee form accompanied by appropriate accouterments.  What an interesting concept! The food?  RICH RICH RICH...and delicious!  We were first presented with a large bowl of salt & vinegar popcorn which was surprisingly addictive.  This was my 2 y.o. son's first experience with popcorn and he loved it so much I fear he'll be spoiled for the normal stuff.  For appetizers we had the truffled potato gnocchi, beef tenderloin tartare and a crabmeat gazpacho.  The gazpacho was fresh and summery.  The beef tartare had a hickory smoked ice cream and barnaise panna cotta that were TO DIE FOR.  But the gnocchi?  INCREDIBLE!  If you make it out to Graham Elliot you HAVE to try this stuff.  Short of the fried egg-on-top it's a veggie-friendly dish so you have NO excuses! For entrees I had the Skate (fish), my Mom had the chicken and my husband the beef short-rib stroganoff  (FYI, the menu described online is slightly different from what was available tonight and I'm sure it will be different when you dine here).  The chicken was PERFECTLY cooked but I wasn't wild about the summer potato salad accompaniment.  The Skate was delicious.  It was a little firm and salty for a piece of fish, so a bit of a surprise, but I liked it.  If you're not big on seafood strong in ""Yang"" or ""Umami"" in taste, this might not be for you.  I was hesitant to order it because of the raisin-chutney, brown butter accompaniment, but the tartness of this was the perfect compliment to the richness of the fish and the buttery flavor of the polenta cake.  My husband LOVED the stroganoff...and he's NOT easily impressed!   I had a taste and was also thoroughly impressed. For dessert we had the Fudge-peanut butter brownie and the spice krispie treat.  The brownie was meh.  The spice krispie treat tasted like my favorite home-scent spray smells: spicy and fruity.  I can't explain why but the scent/taste of this dish reminded me of one of my favorite vacations...I LOVED it! GO HERE.  For what it is, it's a reasonably-priced treat and a really refreshing spin on the ""new, hot & trendy"" restaurants that Chicago offers almost weekly.  If you don't feel like waiting for a reservation, go early - 5:30-6pm - sit at the bar and try the ""snacks"" and the fancy cocktails.  Next time I come here - and there WILL be a ""next time - this is what I plan to do...""One of each and a cab home, please!""",0.9993,0.75,0.206,0.044,0.651636708701926
2008-06-22,5.0,"Where do you stand on Cheez-its in risotto?    You may be neutral to the idea, but more likely you will either think Cheez-its in risotto is clever, subversive, and rad or you are borderline repulsed because (a) Cheez-its are a processed, kinda gross cracker or (b) putting cheez-its in gourmet food is way too postmodern/hipster. This was the discussion I had to have with my traveling partner (TP - ha ha) before he would eventually be swayed to my conviction to try this newly established restaurant.  We pretty  much had one window of opportunity for fine dining during our visit to Chicago and this is how we spent it. And we ordered the damn risotto. So we walked in at 9:45 and were told that in a few minutes a table would open up.  This is not a good strategy to take, say, at 7:30, but the place was quieting down when we walked in.  I started with ""London Calling"" - a concoction of gin, citrus, and cucumber - so refreshing! - and my TP had an edible sangria.  I have never seen anything like this - it was a sorbet-like concoction based on fizzy port with slivers of fruit, to be eaten with a spoon.  Also at the bar, we had calamari ""curly fries,"" which were thin calamari steak strips battered and fried and served with an aioli with the consistency of cheese spread.  Damn good - in fact, the hostess, who felt comfortable with us by then and was coming around to seat us, asked if she could have one.  She used pretty good judment in figuring out that we would find that novel. The menu was simple and organized, the wine listed as pairings.  As the food came out, the chef's philosophy became apparent.  Each dish was edible art - but not stuffy museum paint-on-canvass art, the kind of edgy art you find on First Fridays, with embedded objects and mixed media, the kind of art that tells a story first and foremost.  In the case of the risotto, which also boasted PBR-glazed onions, aged Wisconsin cheddar, and cured bacon was ""everything Wisconsin"" (our server Julia* engaged us at some length on this topic).  We also enjoyed: seared scallops, crab-cucumber gaspacho, and honey lavender chicken.  Each dish built on the other and had some note of childhood/comfort food (ie, fried pickel!) in it to complement the ""gourmet"" components.  Graham Elliot definitely pulls off ""fine dining redefined.""  Without a doubt, one of my favorite experiences in dining! *Julia was also enormously helpful in getting us to Wicker Park and gave us a list of places to try.",0.9685,0.824,0.108,0.068,0.5835879200164915

2008-06-19,3.0,"I like the spirit of this place. Very fine dining in a down to earth atmosphere. There's something refreshing about being served a $35 entree by a waiter wearing Chuck Taylors. Somehow, I don't think Keds would induce the same warm fuzzy.  So the ambiance is great. But- full disclosure- I do carry an extreme affinity for lime tinted accents. Thus, I fell in love with the decor. Others with a more mature design palette may argue.  Fitting with the casual theme, the courses were simple:  Cold. Hot. Sea. Land. Sweet. Monosyllabic, something a caveman would utter. We had one of each:  beef tartare, diver scallops, mahi mahi, lamb, gooey chocolate brownie. And each was delightfully intricate. Somehow the beef tartare and mahi did not fully live up to the presentation and ingredients. Despite all the components, they lacked some flavor. The lamb was interesting. Accompanied by lentils and had an overall Indian way about it. I found it challenging and am still trying to figure out what I think. This ongoing internal debate is rare, so it qualifies the dish as a raging success in my book. The gooey chocolate brownie had peanut butter and was sinfully rich.

2008-06-08,4.0,"We debated at our table of 4 of the rating.. Some were solidly 3, I was more a 3.5 trending upward but since I'm writing the review I get to choose. 4 stars. but barely. The pro's: I LOVED the space. Great atmosphere, friendly staff (tho we're convinced our server didn't really like us. but that's a different story). The menu was very interesting and showed  a lot of potential. Some of our dishes (beef stroganoff, peanut butter brownie, buffalo chicken) were OUTSTANDING. Some were better than OK (scallops, beef tartare, rissotto, gnocchi) and some were just not good (pina colada, lamb (some good, some not). So there was nothing BAD. And if we lived in Chicago we'd go back again. But since we only travel once or 2x/year there are other places we'd rather try. I would say give it a shot. I really liked the gnocchi and risotto (but mixed reviews from the others). The salmon blt was decent. The lamb was mostly not tender (maybe the shank wasn't and the loin was better?) I really liked the scallop but the other people at the table who tasted it didn't. Salright, it was my dish and I'll order anything w/ fava beans. The pina colada was really a dessert more than a cocktail. Panna cotta (I think) with carmelized rum slushy sorta stuff. You eat it with a spoon. Not satisfying if you're looking for an adult beverage. Our server was a little too enthusiastic about the things she loved (the filtered water, among other things). So as much as I wanted to love this place (dressed down with 4 star food, great music) I only liked it. BUT we were there when it had been open less than a week. I expect things will get continually better.",0.9979,0.736,0.238,0.026,0.555429292929293
2008-06-07,5.0,"I went here last night to celebrate my last day of teaching and the start of summer.  The ambiance is laid back and casual but still very cool.  Everything was on point.  Wine list was very affordable. Dinner was delicious. Before bringing out any food they give you a ""snack"" of popcorn with truffle oil.  It just tasted like popcorn to us.  Nothing too special. We started with the Cheez-It Risotto.  The combo of PBR onions, cheesy risotto and apples was awesome.  The waiter said that it was an homage to Wisconsin and they used all Wisconsin products.  When we asked how the Cheez It's fit in he said Graham always eats them on road trips which I thought was cute.  We also had the ""Chicken wings"" with blue cheese and Budweiser foam.  The chicken was tender and tasty.  We then moved on to our entrees.  I had the Salmon BLT which consisted of perfectly cooked salmon topped with pancetta on top of tomatoes and a salad.  My boyfriend had the ""prime rib"" of pork which was huge and had a great flavor.  He was especially surprised by the size and loved how tender and delicious it was. Between our dinner and dessert Graham Elliot actually came out to thanks us for coming on opening weekend.  He seemed very genuine and sweet.  For dessert we had the peanut butter brownie.  I declared it a dream come true.  It had a brownie which was chocolate and gooey with peanut butter, ice cream, a caramelized banana, and a malt ball.  It was deconstructed and each element tasted delicious on its on or combined.  Overall it was a fantastic meal.  The laid back unpretentious atmosphere made it a fun place to go for an amazing experience with friends.",0.9987,0.72,0.28,0.0,0.6156493506493504
2008-06-03,5.0,"where to start... first, i should disclose that i went to graham elliot with two of my favorite foodie friends, one of whom has got the hookup with the pastry chef and goes way back with several of the waiters.  i'm not sure that made that much of a difference though.  everyone seemed to get tremendous treatment. the cocktails...creative.  i had the rooibos sour to sip on while i waited for my friends.  it was light and crisp and way too dangerously drinkable.  my friend had the bloody mary which was a little willy wonka-ish with the tomato sorbet and horseradish whipped cream.  the london calling brought out the best in pimm's.  again, refreshing and tasty.  i'm not quite sure how pimm's plus cucumber soda makes something that tastes like watermelon, but damn.  i could drink it all day long.  i could keep on babbling about these drinks, but then, i'd never get to the food.  let me just say that the montoya pinot noir and the seis de luberri tempernillo/rioja rocked. now the food.  i hate peas.  always have.  until this soup.  the pea bisque was tasty stuff.  the caesar salad was perfect.  the brioche twinkie was a very nice touch.  the risotto was smokey goodness and the gnocci was truffle, egg-y goodness.   graham elliot turned me onto peas and my friend onto fish.  she's one of those die-hard meat eaters that doesn't normally enjoy fish, but she was turned on to the skate.  the raisin chutney--perfect combo of sweet and salty.  the lamb was perfectly cooked and the combo of the shaved fennel and eggplant just rocked.  but the stroganoff.  holy shit.  the meat melts in your mouth...i can't even come close to describing just how good it is.   we had all of the desserts.  i'd say creme brulee topped it for me, then the peach cobbler, brownie then rice crispie treats.  but that order of preference could change depending on my mood.  the creme brulee won out tonight because the pineapple was just so damn good.  but they were all tremendous.     oh damn.  i almost forgot about the popcorn.  the truffle oil drizzled popcorn.  we had three servings of it.  and we probably could have had three more.   we got a nice tour of the kitchen.  chef showed us around and i nearly got hungry again seeing and smelling all of it.   i'll be back again soon to try all the things i missed (the scallops looked awesome) and the bar menu--foie gras lollipops, calamari curly fries... oh!  ambiance was great.  i think it could end up being a bit loud when completely packed, but it was perfect tonight.",0.9918,0.79,0.143,0.067,0.6507716049382717
2008-06-03,5.0,"Spectacular food. Remarkable space and service. Get your reservation while you have a chance. Graham Elliot hosted a great birthday for the wife. She started with the Kobe Tartare with hickory smoked ice cream. I started with the buffalo chicken thigh with blue cheese, celery slaw and Budweiser foam. The ice cream was fantastic, but the buffalo chicken won. Next came the next course when she had the ceasar salad with whole anchovies and a garlic brioche twinkie with parmesean filling. I had the cheez-it risotto with pabst glazed onions and wisconsin bacon. The risotto was good enough to qualify as an appetizer that I would order as an entree. It was amazing. The brioche was also something that will turn Chicago food on its ear.  The next course we had the pork spare rib with watermelon chutney, root beer bbq sauce, grits and collard greens. It was an amazingly large piece of pork that was crispy on the outside and perfectly tender on the inside. The root beer BBQ sauce and watermelon chutney were a perfectly sweet counter balance to the rich pork and the bitter greens. We split the chocolate brownie with banana and whoppers and the amazing peach cobbler for dessert. The peach cobbler was a shortcake with freeze dried peaches topped with a dehydrated peach and a quinelle of ice cream on top. It was spectacular. The dinner was great. A relaxed atmosphere.

2008-05-31,5.0,"I must confess that I never made it to Bowles' Avenues restaurant at the Peninsula, which bummed me out considerably. That's why when I read that Chef Bowles was opening a new eponymous restaurant this weekend, I signed up immediately, snagging a reservation before the liquor was even delivered (BYOB + a Beard-nominated chef? Oh yeah!) This place ain't the Peninsula, folks, and that's a GOOD thing. I've never had such great food in such a relaxed and utterly unpretentious setting. Even the servers personify the laid-back attitude of the space, dressed in jeans and matching brown t-shirts and Chucks.  While they were offering a five-course tasting for a relatively modest $75 (don't forget that Avenues was well into the triple digits), we opted to order four courses each off the menu, which is broken up into ""cold,"" ""hot,"" ""sea,"" ""land,"" and ""sweet."" After we ordered we were surprised with a generous bowl of parmesan-dusted and truffled popcorn. This gratis ""snack"" was the first standout of the evening. I need to figure out how to make this stuff. At once decadent and light, we asked for a second bowl between the first and second courses. ""Cold."" I started with the Caesar salad, four perfect piles of romaine lettuce, each topped with a single white anchovy and a beautiful green dressing. On the side was a parmesan-stuffed brioche ""twinkie"" of a giant crouton. While the dish was pleasing overall, the primary flavor of the crouton was definitely *fried.* Tamara began her meal with the beet salad, which was delicious, surrounded by a foam of goat cheese. I don't care how cliched people say foam might be nowadays, I thought it was fantastic. ""Hot."" Tamara ordered what might be the winner of the night - truffled gnocchi with tri-colored asparagus and a fried egg. While this was a lot of truffle to throw on top of the popcorn, I'd be a fool to complain about too much truffle! The yolk of the perfectly fried egg exploded into the rest of the dish, adding an additional layer of richness to an already luxurious plate. My aged-cheddar risotto with cheez-its (yes, cheez-its), was delicious. I had read much about Bowles' play between junk food and couture food, and this dish exceeded all expectations. The cheddar and bacon added a distinctly smoky flavor to the perfectly cooked rice, and a topper salad of beautifully shredded green apple cut the smokiness perfectly. ""Land."" I had the lamb, which turned out to be a very different experience. A perfectly cooked piece of shank sat on top of delicious cous cous and was flanked by two rounds of VERY braised (fall apart on the fork) shank. I'd never tasted lamb so tender, even if it was a bit salty. ""Sea."" Tamara ordered the scallops, which were purported to be encrusted with chorizo on the website, but turned out to be surrounded by a chorizo-and-white-bean puree. I couldn't imagine a better pairing for perfectly seared scallops. Each was topped with a dollop of subtly flavored saffron foam. It was a perfect dish. ""Sweet."" I was honestly surprised by the novelty and sublime taste of the desserts. The peach cobbler was somewhat deconstructed, and each component was magical. A peanut butter brownie is right up my alley, of course, but here it was executed at a level I'd never seen before, paired with a peanut butter ice cream of which I could only wish to take home a pint. Following dinner, we were lucky enough to be treated to a brief tour of the kitchen, where a very happy Chef Graham Elliot Bowles was absolutely glowing. Much more than the expected handshake and ""thanks for coming,"" Bowles introduced us to the line cooks, who were each responsible for one of the aforementioned named ""phases"" of the menu. When we raved about the gnocchi, Bowles laughed to the cook responsible for it that he could ""keep his job for another week."" The sense of camaraderie was unlike anything I'd seen in a professional kitchen before - this group obviously likes working with each other very much, and that love shines through in the cuisine. The impeccable food combined with the friendly, almost familiar service and refreshingly relaxed atmosphere will have us coming back again soon. The dining room music sounds like it might be Bowles' iPod... it was four-star food served in the comfortable space of a neighborhood spot.
