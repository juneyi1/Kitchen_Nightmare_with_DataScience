I think my server went on several 30 minute breaks while I was trying to watch a middle of the week football game.

One said he would ask the manager and I watched him for the next 15 minutes roaming the bar. The bus boy made me feel uncomfortable as he circled my table and began to take my plate before I had the chance to finish wiping my hands with my napkin and put it in the plate. I'm only giving 2 stars because the replacement waitress was on top of everything, which unfortunately for me was close to time to go.

This dining room is pretty formal with white table cloth, dim lighting and a single candle on the table.  Not bad.  Only a few other tables were occupied back there, which made service not too tough of a task for the waitress.   I ordered the salmon salad, and was a bit disappointed that it was made with head lettuce.  Restaurants with white table clothes and dim lighting should always have a dope, high quality salad made with fresh GREENS--if nothing else.  Your mom should have told you that head lettuce has zero nutritional value.

Chicken fingers? Generic overpriced burgers? Ceaser wraps? Oh yes, we got that all day.   DRINKS: Pricey and continuing to get pricier.  Don't invest in gold, invest in alcohol from TGIF, I mean Grace O'malley's.  Apparently some sort of scarcity in the 1500 block of the south loop is causing prices of the usual shit like Guinness, Blue Moon, Ketel One, Makers Mark... to go waaay up.  The owners must be under the impression that demand for booze is quite inelastic in chicago... what they don't realize is I can and will (always) go somewhere else. SERVICE: Previously - charming, friendly, competent, and occasionally Irish, staff ready to serve and shoot the shit with you on a slow night.  Now - rude, incompetent, uninterested wait staff that probably wouldn't piss on you if you were on fire, much less serve you in a timely manner.

On my second visit, I ordered the turkey burger and the waitress forgot to ask me what kind of cheese I wanted. That's fine. Less fat for me, but note to yourself when you're ordering.  The burger was pretty good, and was the best turkey burger I had in a while because it was grilled. I also liked the ""curry fries"" that came with my burger, thinly sliced and comparable to McDonald's fries in width. I'm not so sure though if they're seasoned with curry. They tasted more like they were dusted with Lowry's seasoning. I also tried the signature Irish-tini, which was a car bomb in martini form. It was excellent although I ask that they lay off a bit on the cream. I felt like I was drinking a cake and that the cream inhibited me from reaching the bottom of my glass.

For whatever reason, the chips part were extraordinarily sub-par, and the fish were merely ordinary and rather small. The coleslaw were only okay. All in all, I was rather disappointed.",0.0258,0.879,0.07,0.051,0.7214285714285714
2006-12-01,3.0,"For $9, I expected to be 'wowed' by my burger. It was ok, but it was more of a $6 burger than a $9 burger.  The cheese spread 'appetizer' was nice.  Also, their beers are not exactly expensive, but at $5 and up they are on the higher end of what I expect to pay for a pint in Chicago.  I suppose I'd go back if I was already in the area because the food was decent - but I wouldn't make a special trip.",0.2054,0.879,0.066,0.056,0.5375661375661376
2006-11-25,4.0,"I have not ever hung out at the bar - but the restaurant seating is comfortable, the service is friendly and informal. The pulled pork sandwich on pretzel bread is amazing - it's why I give this place 4 stars.  The Guinness burger is also delicious. Entrees are not exceptional - I stick to the sandwiches and salads. HUGE portions, reasonable prices, and addictive cheesy spread.",0.9777,0.701,0.299,0.0,0.8444444444444446
2006-11-20,3.0,"Recently booked a private party for ~60 people in one of the upstairs party rooms.  The day of the event itself was run well, but the big pain was coordinating with their event planning group.  They were unresponsive to fairly basic requests and I was consistently calling back to make sure they were doing their jobs.  Every time I called, they would use the excuse that they were ""so busy"", but it got old after the first few times. Again, the event went off with no glitches and ran smoothly, but be prepared to spend extra time up front doing the leg work.",0.1901,0.827,0.108,0.065,0.2551587301587302
2006-09-19,3.0,"Update 2/18/07: been here several more times, still slightly below par service. Though I am enjoying the Pretzel Bread buns on the burgers. They screwed up a salad order on one of my trips, dressing always goes on the side for ladies, especially when they ask for it that way.  Original: Food is not ""affordable"" as Marcel M. says, $8/9 burgers is average.  I dont think you get the ""basket of crackers with a yummy cheese spread"" if you eat in the bar area.  Was here on a Friday night at around 8pm for a quick bite to eat before heading out for the evening. Waitress seemed a little frazzled and couldn't remember our order (2 burgers? c'mon). At least she got the beers right, which is good because they have a decent selection on tap that you sometimes don't see. Food was not the best, burger was burnt (Why even ask what temp i want?).  I will be back again as it seems like a fun place and i would like to try some of the other food options, though could use a little polishing.",0.92,0.858,0.108,0.034,0.4441137566137566
2006-09-14,3.0,"I can't say that I would recommend the food at Grace O'Malley's as I think it has declined since it opened.  Although the restaurant and service is really clean and well presented I just find the food to be sub par.  I used to love the Salmon and Goat Cheese Salad, but yesterday after dining there I found the salmon to be different.  It was not cooked fresh but instead pulled from a smoked package.  Stick to the bar at this place, go across the steet to the Chicago Firehouse if you are looking for good food in the area.",0.8532,0.841,0.135,0.024,0.6
2006-05-22,5.0,"I love it here since it's a great place to pop into randomly.  Entrees are  affordable (~$10) compared to other restaurants in the area and the crowd is mixed in a good way.  The burgers are excellent and the accompanying grub is tasty.  I did think the fish and chips were a bit too heavy, but I haven't ordered them since.  Oh yeah, the cheese spread with breadsticks is a perfect, free starter.",0.9672,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.6375
2006-05-12,4.0,"This cute Irish-themed restaurant/bar in the heart of the South Loop has enough charm to lure even Northsiders here - it's especially convenient if you are going to Soldier Field and need a bite to eat.   The staff was incredibly friendly, the food was typical higher-end bar food that was incredibly good, and the bonus was that we were served a complimentary basket of crackers with a yummy cheese spread that we could have dined on alone! It also looks like a nice place to stop by for a few drinks, as the front part of the restaurant is a bar that has a few TV's for your sports-viewing pleasure.  Check out the website for more info!",0.981,0.729,0.239,0.032,0.5727272727272726
