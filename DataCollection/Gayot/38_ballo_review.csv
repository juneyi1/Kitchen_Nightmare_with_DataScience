Onto the food...it's good Italian.  The menu is nice and thoughtful and the servers are slick and try to flirt.  The bar serves great drinks and you'll feel a little like old-school Chicago in this retro restaurants.   But unfortunately, right after you leave the restaurant your ears will start ringing....",0.7815,0.75,0.146,0.104,0.6197478991596639

They were good about getting us to our table by our reservation time, but everyone was so cramped together...even tighter than just elbow-to-elbow.  This shows me that they are more concerned with squeezing out that extra dollar than they are about the customers' comfort.   Our waiter was nice, but really tried to rush us...thereby only reinforcing the above paragraph.  I mean, I get that it's busy, but it's Valentine's Day; I want to have a nice dinner with the bf, not ""fast"" food.   The soup I had was decent but very watery.  My boyfriend had the same complaint.  The pasta dishes offered were basically the exact same thing, just different variations; most were just some form of pasta with a cheese and a red sauce.  yawn.  What about other delicious pasta dishes that have alfredo sauce, or a garlic & butter sauce?  Of course, the entrees that cost twice as much had some more flair...make of that what you will. Dessert was surprisingly very good; it was a Godiva Chocolate Mousse cake.  Yum!   I'm sure this place is great on a normal day, but it's clear that special days are not their forte.  I don't think we'll be back.",0.9893,0.849,0.121,0.03,0.46287887377173087

Typically when you order calamari at a restaurant, you end up with an oily or soggy dish, but I was quite impressed with the crispness and the flavor of the calamari served here, along with the artichokes.

Let the games begin! I perused the menu only to get an idea of what Ballo served, because the Big A ensured me that he would ""take care of the ordering.""  We started off sharing the Sausage and Peppers appetizer, which in my opinion when done right is one of my favorite things.  Ballo does it right and does it BIG.  You get five nice sized Italian sausages, a healthy portion of multi colored peppers, and most importantly a plate covered in yummy juice.  Leslie went with the more heart healthy Sunday Salad.  The Big A and I split the Brick Chicken, which is a whole boneless chicken cooked under intense heat pressed down using you guessed it a brick served with broccolini, potatoes, and a lemony garlicy sauce.  The chicken was moist on the inside and the skin was dark, crispy, and delicious.  The portion was GINORMOUS!  I normally love a big portion, because I have insane appetite, but this was almost offensive.  If I were to order this as my entree I would feel intimidate and emasculated by the portion.  Leslie had the Grilled Salmon served with broccolini and a balsamic reduction.  To finish off the evening we went with the Godiva Chocolate Cake served with a raspberry sauce.  The cake was good, but not amazing. The interior is reminiscent of a 1960's supper club.  Red banquets, open kitchen, and a disco ball rotating above the dining room.  The overall look and feel compliments the food they serve extremely well.  The service was exactly what I was hoping for, an Italian waiter who came off like a distant cousin of the Gambino family.  He was the type of guy who made sure you knew you were at an Italian restaurant.  When he spilled red wine on my cream colored hat, I thought everything was going to head down hill.  I mean can I verbalize my frustration to this guy who might very well take me in the back and turn me into tomorrow's sausage special?  There was no need for worry, our waiter swept up my hat from the table and returned a few moments later with the stains completely removed.  Phew!  I thought I might have to kick this guys ass....

2006-12-10,2.0,"cute old school diner look. this place has great food and all but i'm gonna have to hate on its choices. ballo's major headline is ""italian specialties"" but i didn't know that italy only had 4 specialties bcuz this restaurant only has this many major dishes, or at least when i went there in september. go to maggiano's just a block west they have a terrific array of italian dishes. the chef had asked how the pizza was but doesn't make ballo any better than what it's cracked up to be. this place would be great if it just became a bar. forget the fine dining restaurant. the roudiness of the bar and the rest of the restaraunt just doesn't mix.",0.8462,0.77,0.148,0.082,0.59375
2006-07-25,4.0,"Amazing food, but very noisy. Saturday Night Fever was playing and a lot of people seemed to be watching John Travolta instead of focusing on making conversation with the others in their party. I thought the service was excellent, and I've never met a more friendly staff. The manager, John, even bowed me out of the restaurant and said, ""Have a lovely evening, dear."" Extremely cordial. I had the linguine (the sauce was excellent) and I highly recommend the Shrimp Toscano (best shrimp I've ever had). I was there on a Monday night, and it wasn't too crowded, but I'm sure reservations are a must on the weekends!!",0.9655,0.738,0.21,0.051,0.6980808080808081
2006-05-02,4.0,"After hearing decent reviews from a client, I decided to give Ballo a try for lunch. I had the grilled salmon spinach salad. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and was a fairly large portion. It lacks the finesse of Coco Pazzo's, but I don't think that is quite what they are shooting for anyway. It has a warm, Italian movie feel...great for casual conversation, and a quick but quality meal. It is a bit noisy, however, so don't go if you are planning on intimate conversation or serious business.",0.5647,0.876,0.083,0.041,0.5920634920634921
2006-04-04,4.0,"We went here for Ali A's bday and it was a really cool atmosphere.  However, I don''t recommend Ballo for anyone who actually wants to hear their guests because it is so loud in there!  Since I couldn't hear what anyone was saying I was able to enjoy the great food...best thing on the menu is the meatballs, but I loved the pizza too!  My favorite part of the evening was when I went to the bathroom and heard old women planning to spend the rest of the night partying at Jilly's. You do get the cheesy older crowd at Ballo, but the food is worth it!",0.9725,0.794,0.206,0.0,0.5715277777777777

2006-03-16,2.0,This restaurant is really bizarre. I don't know what exactly was going on here. I went during the summer when I had just moved to Chicago with my fiance and we were super confused. It's really loud and has strobe lights but also serves pricey Italian food. There were also a lot of moms in their 40s there wearing tube tops and tight jeans. I don't think I will ever go hear again!!!,0.7453,0.849,0.105,0.046,0.47176870748299315
2006-03-08,4.0,"I got a big laugh out of this place- it is so random but I love it!  You walk in and feel like you are entering a diner but then there is this huge disco ball and loud dance music, and so many TV's with old mob movies!  So random but so entertaining!  We had a great time there and the food is very good.  There was way too much of it though- even though the waiter told us we should share- I still wasn't expecting that much food!",0.9893,0.687,0.313,0.0,0.48785714285714293
2006-02-28,5.0,"I love Italian food, and I think Ballo is one of my preferred places now. I've been there few times, and it seems better each time. The food is great, the restaurant is small and crowded (very much like European restaurants with tables too close to each other), and very very noise. Go very early if you want a quieter dinner as the decibels here increase by the minute. Now if you want to party with friends and a great dinner, this is the place!",0.9794,0.711,0.289,0.0,0.37625000000000003

The food is great...last time I was there  with a huge group of girls celebrating my friend's bday and we pretty much sampled it all.  My favorites were the meatballs and the pizza.  I haven't been impressed with the service and it's so loud that you can't hear the other members of your party, but it's definitely a very fun atmosphere (perfect for a bday or bachelorette party) and I've been very happy with the food.",0.9683,0.727,0.254,0.019,0.7261111111111112
2006-01-27,4.0,"If a quiet dinner to get to know someone is what you are looking to do- Ballo's is NOT the place for you.  The loud music accompanied by dancing customers is not for the well-reserved.  For the people out to have a good time, Ballo is the perfect place for a girl's night out or a fun dinner with friends.  The portions are huge and the food is great.  The meatballs are a must and the desserts are great if you can save room.  However, don't expect to be able to hear what the person across from you is saying!",0.9798,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.6620370370370371

The location is not bad, but for some reason the restaurants are not hitting their stride at this corner of River North.
