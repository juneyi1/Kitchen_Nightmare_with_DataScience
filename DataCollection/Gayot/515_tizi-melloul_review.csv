2010-02-25,2.0,"We came here for restaurant week and while I was initially really excited for this meal, it ended up being sub-par and left me not really wanting to go back there again for dinner.   The starter was a platter of flatbread and three types of dip: baba ghanoush, hummus, and sun-dried tomato olive spread.  It was ok.  Nothing special, and I could have replicated everything on the dish with a trip to Trader Joe's.   The appetizer was a platter of fire-roasted mussels and some roasted potatoes.  The spices on the mussels were delicious and unique, as was the clarified harissa butter.  This was definitely the highlight of the entire meal...it all goes downhill from here. The salad was some chopped romaine lettuce with some goat cheese, dried cranberries or raisins, grapes, and sliced green apples.  It was refreshing, but again, I could have easily created it myself.  It did seem a little out of place on the menu. I was excited for the entree, as it promised a salmon kebab, vegetable tagine, and lamb tagine.  However, the salmon was bland and underseasoned, lain over some pieces of carmelized onion and rice.  The veggies in the vegetable tagine were overcooked and mushy, and if it weren't for the fava beans, I would have thought that I was eating baby food.  The flavor of lamb tagine was the saving grace of the entire entree, and even then, the pieces of lamb were tough and overcooked.   Dessert was some chocolate fondue aka melted chocolate in a dish that got cold at the end, some sliced strawberry, banana, dried apricots, and pound cake.  Meh.   While we got a lot to eat for restaurant week prices, I didn't leave feeling exactly satisfied because it was such a mediocre meal.   Also, one more thing to point out - we were sitting next to a table with a couple that decided to order only one portion of the restaurant week meal (the guy ordered a la carte).  Since Tizi does family style, everything is brought out to share.  However, I noticed that the table next to us got the same amount of food as my riend & I.  You'd think that two people would receive bigger portions than one person, but you're wrong.  Our table and their table got EXACTLY the same amount of the starter flatbread, mussels, salad, & fondue.  Hmm... The ambiance is unique though, and I may come for happy hour and their mussels.  However, if you are going to dine, be aware that the food isn't great and the tables are very very close together, intimate, if you will.  Maybe a little too intimate, as we caught our neighbor's entire conversation about swinging.  TMI.",0.9689,0.879,0.087,0.034,0.5865816326530613

The décor and atmosphere was amazing and pretty much everything I could have asked for (it was a bit crowded but it was Valentines Day so who am I to complain?). I was a little disappointed that they pretty much only had one vegetarian appetizer (Tizi Mezze) and non-salad entrée (Lucky 7 Vegetable Tagine) available but I pretty much inhaled it so I suppose I can't complain too much about that either (The Boy also loved his fire-roasted mussels and Grilled Pork Loin and Shrimp but though his entree could have been larger). The chocolate fondue was great (pretty much up there with the one you can get at the Melting Pot) and because of the occasion, we got complementary glasses of campaign - who can argue with that?  Normally, we would have had to leave the dinning area we were sat in to go see the belly dancer and pay an additional $25 per person but with the place so crowded and it being V-Day and all, she came into our area and danced for a song without us having to pay the extra money. That was nice and all, but the room was so crowded and bussing with service staff that she didn't have that much room to move and it's a little awkward to pay attention while shoveling food down your throat...and then she left, never to be seen again. Maybe I'll have to try again on a non-Valentine's Day Sunday to see her really work... All in all, it was a good experience and I would assume that all of my complaints (except for the lack of veggie options) would be addressed if I went on a different, non-Valentine's Sunday (or any other day for that matter). We didn't really see our waitress all that much (and The Boy said that part of our food was brought out by a bartender) until it was time to kick us out but the rest of the staff was nice (including another bartender who joined in on our conversation about the insanity of non-alcoholic beer after we paid our bill and moved to the bar to discuss our next move).

We ordered the Tizzi Mezze appetizer which was great.  For dinner I got the tilapia and my bf got the pork loin.  The fish was good, but it was served with sund dried tomatoes and green olives.  That made the dish taste a lot more saltier than it should have been.  Still good though, and I finished most of it.  We ordered the carmelized pears and apples for dessert, which was a nice light-tasting end to the meal.  If we wouldn't had gotten an appetizer, I know I would have still been hungry after the meal.  The fish didn't really come with a side.

It is the perfect size room for a party of 10-15, and the decor makes you feel as if you are in Morocco. It is a little awkward at first sitting in a half circle (we all sat around the outside, without anyone facing in) but then we got used to it and realized it was better to all be in the conversation. It was nice that they served the meal family style with a dish to every three people who shared a table.  We had a 5 course meal starting with the appetizers of flatbread with hummus and baba ghanouj. That, in my opinion, was just okay. It was nothing that amazing. Then we had a salad with goat cheese, which was just okay, too. (But I am not huge into plain goat cheese.) One of my standout dishes was their specialty: the mussels that everyone raves about... and those were truly yummy! I would definitely go back just to eat those again! And my other fave was the delicious gnocchi with asparagus... the gnocchi was light and fluffy... one of the best  gnocchis I have had and the sauce was fantastic!

For dessert, we had the chocolate fondue but by that time everyone was already done eating so we really didn't get to enjoy it all that much. Overall, the food was decent but it was really the whole atmosphere that made this night truly amazing! We also got a belly dancer, which just added to the fun!  If you are planning a private party, I would definitely recommend Tizi Melloul for something different and memorable! The service was good, too, checking up on us to refill our wine and making sure everything was going well. They rent out the room for only 2 hours so they do run you through everything pretty quickly, which was not ideal, but at least when our time was up we could have the space in the bar area to lounge. Overall, a great experience! I would have to say the food is a bit pricey, but again, I think that the atmosphere makes up for it!",0.9986,0.741,0.233,0.026,0.5343536487153508

2009-11-22,3.0,"I was really excited to try out Tizi Melloul, especially with all the reviews from fellow Yelpers. However, my night out at this Middle Eastern restaurant wasn't exactly spectacular. My mom, sister, and I ate dinner here tonight to (belatedly) celebrate my birthday. The service was awesome. The maitre'd was very helpful, and prompt, and our server was discrete, while efficient at taking care of refilling our water goblets and clearing out plates and all waitress-y responsiblities. We were ushered into the Crescent Room, I think. The room was a lot smaller than I expected, but very cute. There was only one other person there (we came early, about 6 PM). The room was darkly lit and very quiet. I liked the plushy seat cushions that I could lean against while eating. There are two bathrooms, and the women's is very clean and smells really good.  Anyway. The food. The only reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is because of my awesome steak. We ordered the mussels, the steak for me, the vegetable tangine for my sister, and the grilled tofu for my mom. We had complementary goat cheese creme brulee for dessert. OH MAN! My steak was awesome! A healthy dose of goat cheese was slathered on the crispy potato fingerlings, and the perfectly grilled (medium rare) steak was artfully arranged onto delicious pesto and arugula. I seriously wiped my plate clean! That pesto was out of the world! Best steak I've ever had. Ever. My mom really liked her grilled tofu, but I was so-so on it. It had a crust of tandoori or something that didn't really appeal to me. It came with deep-fried green beans which were cool, and the tofu was nestled in a pool of spicy sauce. My sister said it tasted like less-spicy siracha...which is weird. But my mom really liked it. Oh, the vegetable tangine. I had high hopes for you. My sister was really excited about the tangine, because she'd watched The Next Iron Chef on the Food Network and thought it would be like it. Blegh. The rice was mushy, there was no flavor at all, and the vegetables were overcooked.  But. The best part of the meal? The goat cheese creme brulee. SO GOOD! I love goat cheese, but my sister and mom aren't great fans, and we all really enjoyed it. The caramelized sugar on top was a bit burnt, but other than that, it was a scrumptious, creamy delight. It came topped with a very tart sorbet that I don't remember what it was, which I personally didn't like, but was gobbled up by my sister and mom. Final verdict? The prices are a little bit high for the quality that came out (except for the mussels. HOLY CRAP! There were like 30 mussels, spicy and yummy, for just $9). I probably won't come back here again, but it was a good experience.",0.9993,0.72,0.253,0.027,0.6203921568627452

EVER. so you pick the mussels out of the shell, rub it on the shell's seasoning a bit, then dip it in the harissa butter sauce. so so so good! then it was onto the entrees. i ordered the grilled hanger steak, while e got the lamb loin. i am a huge lamb fan, but i wasn't thrilled with this one. e loved it though. and i loved my hanger steak. and i also love that it came with french fries... which i lovingly dipped into the accompanying sauce. dessert was... eh. this is not a dessert place. if you want something yummy, get the fondue from sushi samba rio up the street.our server suggested the poached pineapple brulee. while the brulee'd pineapple slice was delicious, the rice pudding was the blandest i've ever had. it seriously needed sugar, or syrup, or molasses! lol. oh well... due to my lack of interest in my dessert, she could tell i wasn't impressed. but the complimentary champagne was a nice touch. the customer service at this place is just on point. they make sure you're attended to (e.g. it was a busy night, but the*manager*came over to take our orders)... they check back on you at the perfect times... the manager makes rounds to ask about the food and service.  at the end of the night, you leave knowing that you're going to visit again, and indulge in those mussels.",0.9985,0.756,0.217,0.026,0.6568154838988174
2009-10-29,2.0,"My boyfriend and I went to Tizzi Melloul last night because it was one of the $10 off cards we got from our deck of A La Card (52 $10 gift certificates to restaurants around the city).  The food was pretty good (had the Tizzi appetizer, the blue marlin and chicken tagine) and the waitress was attentive, knowlegable and nice. We learned upon arrival that is was 1/2 off bottles of wine night with the purchase of two entrees.  Perfect!  Or so we thought.  We got our bill and they charged us full price for the wine.  When we pointed this out to the waitress, she said that was the responsibility of her manager to apply to discount so she would have the manager revise our bill, however, we couldn't use our $10 off card if we wanted to get the 1/2 off the bottle of wine!  Unreal.  I realize that the small print on the card says you can't combine with other promotions, but it's only $10!  I was so disappointed that an expensive restaurant would be more concerned with their $10 than with the satisfaction of their customers.  Our bill, after tax and tip and the 1/2 off wine, was nearly $100 for two people.  It disappointed me that a restaurant like Tizzi Melloul would nickle and dime their customers.  Additionally, the fine print on the card says the card does not count towards alcohol purchases--you must spend $25 worth of food to qualify to use the card.  I find it interesting that suddenly the restaurant couldn't accept this card when the deal was ONLY on alcohol and we spent about $50 on food.  Convenient how this policy can be changed for whatever works best for the restaurant ... The waitress recommended that we save the card and come back to the restaurant to use it another time--this is unlikely.  It looks like that while the card was the reason we came to restaurant, it will now be the reason we never return. Bottom line, the food was good but didn't blow me away, so it's not worth the price.  I would have considered returning if I felt customer satisfaction was a priority, however I learned our business is not worth $10 to Tizzi Melloul.  Thankfully, we've had other restaurants accept the cards when they have drink specials, etc, so I still find great value in the cards and look forward to using them at less stingy restaurants!",0.9921,0.81,0.145,0.045,0.5166666666666666

The bread they gave with the tapenade sucked...it wasnt totally baked and had no flavor. The mussels were pretty good, they had a spicy flavor and Im not usually a fan but I ate a few.  Entrees: In a word-SALT. Although cooked well, the food was so damn salty I needed an IV of water. My friend got the salmon and was tempted to send it back but everyone was half way through so she didnt. The waitress said that they put a salt crust on it which I guess explains it all. To compensate she got her another cocktail on the house and some cous cous to cut it but still she barely touched it. I got the chicken pie with really wasnt a ""pie"" It comes with one piece of grilled breast (with a salt crust), and then a stew like chicken dish. The flavors and textures were good but it was covered up by the salt. Others got the skirt steak which they received too well done and the unlucky ones who got lamb shank were unhappy with that dish as well...can you guess why? SALTY.

The bread with sun dried tomatoes was really good and actually as good as all of the appetizers.

Tizi's fabulous manager Michael and his incredible staff took care of us from the minute we walked in.  They even printed ""Happy Birthday Andrea"" on my menu, which put a smile on my face...even if the big 3-0 is rapidly approaching!

But the drycleaning bill was well worth it because these were SO good...especially when tipped in the unhealthy, but I don't care cause it's my bday sauce that came with them.  The bass was great too, even though my mouth was on fire from the spiciness of it after just a few bites. After this delicious meal this bday girl was about to call it a night, but my friends insisted on dessert...and so we ordered the fondue! Bananas, cake, marshmallows....oh my!

The scallop appetizers, roasted duck and rainbow trout were also okay too, but nothing amazing.",0.9614,0.769,0.196,0.035,0.6640873015873016
2009-04-26,4.0,"Four of us went here after seeing a Chorus Line on Saturday. The interior is warm, inviting, and attractive. Our server, Alex, was very attentive throughout the meal. We started off with appetizers - mussels, scallops, and foie gras. They were all yummy, though the mussels were a real standout.  Two of us had the poached pear salad & this was the only real disappointment with the food. The pear itself was yummy, but the salad dressing was really bland and flavorless. The roasted beet salad was the superior salad choice.  For main dishes we had the Chicken Bizteeya, the Monk fish, and the Lamb Shank. The chicken was tender and had great spices. It has what looks like a little birds nest around it that turned out to be made from filo - very pretty and tasted great, too. The monk fish was excellent and cooked perfectly. The lamb shank was huge & falling off the bone tender. Everything was presented beautifully.  For dessert we shared the chocolate fondue. They were very generous & gave us 4 of each dunking item, though we could have fought over those home made marshmallows. Gratis they brought a small bowl of home made ice cream. The most interesting was buttered popcorn & it really did taste like buttered popcorn.  The wine list is laid out strangely & it took some perusing to figure out that CA wines were grouped under the Global heading when Italy, France, and Spain had their own headings - strange. We ended up with a Vieux Telegraphe for $90 - a bit steeply priced, but an excellent wine.  Overall we had a fun, festive time & I would recommend checking it out.",0.9976,0.708,0.256,0.036,0.6376344086021504

2009-04-04,5.0,"Julee M and I ended up having dinner here after a Yelp event.  The half empty dining room confirmed my suspicions that we weren't going to get the tapas deal, but since the only other clear option was to eat standing up at a crowded bar, I guess it was the best choice for us that night.  The restaurant is beautiful and I was glad to be able to hang out there a bit longer.    The complimentary bread with sundried tomato olive oil was a great touch - marking the first time I've witnessed my friend audibly enjoying her meal.   I normally do not eat lamb, out of guilt, but everything about the dish sounded so mouthwatering, I vowed to atone somehow and ordered it.  That meal was the most delicious thing I've had all year.  Dijon crusted, and came with what I believe was a lemony mashed cauliflower.  Perfectly cooked and nicely presented.  I had a bite of Julee's hanger steak, which was much more tender than I'd anticipated and came with a lovely horseradish sauce.   The waitress was very nice to us, and patient.  However I was disappointed with the way she boxed my leftovers, which she unceremoniously dumped upside down into the container, knocking off the crust and getting sauce everywhere.   A petty complaint, I know, but it's nice to have good looking leftovers that still look like they were worth the $28, not some unrecognizable bits all slopped together.   Not sure if the appetizers served at the Yelp event are on the permanent menu, but I would recommend the bacon wrapped dates, the beef/lamb meatballs (with awesome dipping sauce) and whatever those goat cheese things were - I'd go back just for a plate of those!",0.9976,0.695,0.251,0.053,0.6374551971326167

These bad boys are in some secret combination of approximately 30 different spices and were just heavenly. At this point I was ready to have a cigarette, roll over and go to sleep. *sigh* In addition to most glorious mussels that ever passed my lips we enjoyed the scallops and dick** sausage. The scallops were just divine and perfectly cooked. The dUck sausage was very rich and equally delicious. My dining companion and I were ooohing and ahhhing through our dinner.

2009-03-22,3.0,"I was believing all the positive reviews on Tizi Melloul, but came away disappointed.  Worth one try, then you make the call of whether you will be back. Food: 3 stars.   This is unscaled, Americanized, Mediterranean cuisine.   The lamb and chicken dishes I had were well cooked.  The meat was not overdone and it was very juicy.   It is tough to cook chicken breast and leave it very juicy, but they did that.   On the negative side though, the lamb and chicken dishes were lacking sauces and authentic Mediterranean flavors.   I was looking for some authentic ethnic flavors and got very Americanized flavors.  When I am looking for Mediterranean food, I need to see rice and flat breads and sauces.   I didn't appreciate their take on the cuisine!  The chocolate fondue dessert with spiced cake, strawberries, apricots, bananas, and marshmallows was my favorite dish.  For expensive American cuisine, I will go elsewhere. Service: 4 stars (service without the host: 2 stars).   The waitress was slow and all over the place.   The host gave us dish and drink recommendations on separate trips to our table. Ambiance: 4 stars.   Trendy, romantic, lively. Value: 2 stars.  Food here is pricey.   Portion sizes are adequate.",0.8521,0.816,0.113,0.07,0.5557133838383839
2009-03-15,5.0,"I went to Tizi Melloul last night for my 40th birthday and the experience was outstanding from start to finish.  When I made the reservation, originally for 14 people, they were friendly and accommodating from the start.  When I later changed the reservation to 7 there was no problems whatsoever.  The reservation was for 8:00pm in the main dining room.  We all arrived at different times and we were asked when we wanted to be seated instead of being rushed.  We stayed in the bar area for a good 30 minutes after our reservation time- having drinks (cucumber martinis are strange yet tasty- almost like you are drinking something clearly not good for you but healthy- oh the little lies we tell ourselves!).  The bartenders and a gentleman who I believe was the owner (he told us his name but again- I was drinking martinis so I don't remember- it doesn't take much!) were accommodating, friendly and extremely welcoming.  The decor was nothing short of beautiful- lush and sensual with reds with cool pod lamps in the bar area and copper tables with morrocan lamps and french-style etched mirrrors in the dining room.  Once seated, our server was friendly and not pushy- she stayed back enough to allow us to talk but we were never lacking for anything.  Now to the food- nothing short of fantastic!  We ordered at least 3/4 of the menu between the lot of us- and we are all good at sharing so I sampled pretty much everything.  We started with the Prince Edward mussels which were great- made with paprika and grilled.  The Foie gras was my absolute favorite served with carmelized onions that had something else in them which made it sweeter which we could not identify-  I am going to have dreams about it!  The duck sausage and lamb were also tasty.  Oh- and I cannot forget to mention the bread basket with this dipping sauce which was so good we had to ask what was in it (kalamata olives, sundried tomatoes, garlic ground to a paste and in olive oil served warm).  For the entrees we tried the special which was a monkfish with a sauce made with marmalade and some other sweetness which was not too sweet and a subtle taste.  The hangar steak was also great with salt and pepper fries (yum) and a horseradish sauce.  Tilapia was also excellent as well as the duck which was in a plum cognac sauce.  We also had another entree which had tuscan white beans and was fantastic as well.   We are all pretty good at picking out the ingredients, but with each of the entrees, we had a really hard time trying to figure out the blend of tastes- which is a true testament to the preparation as one taste did not overpower another.  After dinner I was presented with a chocolate cake and popcorn ice cream- yes- POPCORN ice cream- and a glass of champagne.  Truly a wonderful experience and I (and my friends) will be telling everyone we know how wonderful an experience it was from start to finish.  And- I will be going back as much as possible.  Thanks to Tizi Melloul for making my 40th (ugh) a memorable and sense-full occasion!",0.9987,0.755,0.204,0.041,0.5767273576097106
2009-03-05,3.0,"My experience with this restaurant is only limited, as my boyfriend and I went on Valentine's Day to enjoy their special four-course V-Day meal. So keep that in mind as I write the review. The good: Amazing ambiance. Beautiful, luscious decorations that provide a decadent yet sensual atmosphere. Low-lit candles. This is the perfect place to take a date and feel ""in the mood"" just by your surroundings. The hostess and maitre were professional and courteous. Valet drivers efficient and non-evasive. Creative cocktails (the cucumber martini was delicious) and good, albeit small, beer selection (try the Turkish Pilsner). The bad: The V-Day dinner consisted of a four course meal, one version with meat and one for vegans. I am a vegetarian, not vegan, but I was more than happy to try the fare. My disappointment: This 'vegan' menu was not thoroughly thought-out and mostly consisted of regular menu items sans meat and cheese. This is not filling, nutritious, nor pleasing to the palette, and I especially don't appreciate paying the same $50 that my boyfriend paid for lamb and seafood for greens on a plate. I appreciate the attempt, but I think doing some homework about vegan diets (i.e. including a proper protein) would have been greatly appreciated. On another note, the 'coat check' could use some improvement. Overall conclusion: This is an excellent date place and would definitely recommend it for omnivores.

Shortly after I ordered my sangria the host came over to off us the opportunity to sit in the Crescent Room, which of course we took advantage of. We all started moving in there, even though the entire group hadn't arrived yet and we had barely sat down before our server came with water and menus. This devout attentiveness lasted the entire night. We were never without water or new drinks for more than a minute! So service and atmosphere had already impressed us. Then came the food. Everyone here on Yelp recommended the mussels and they were all right. They were the best mussels I've ever had. I wanted to just lick the outside of the shells after eating them they were so good. We also ordered the Tizi Mezze, which is a variety of hummus, olives and these delicious flaky pastries. Then I ordered the hanger steak, which was again delicious. The salmon and pork were pretty popular at the table as well.  Our server actually asked us if we were there for a special occasion early on, so I had mentioned that it was my birthday. At the end of the meal he surprised the whole table with fondue for everyone and a glass of complimentary champagne for me! Again the fondue was amazing (and I'm a pretty picky chocolate eater). We left 3 hours later, stuffed and beyond satisfied. Tizi Melloul has won some comeback customers!",0.9964,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.5639971139971139

The main dining room is perfect for larger parties.  We enjoyed food from the a la carte menu.  The Crescent room is smaller, more intimate, with its own 5-course menu.  Great for smaller groups and couples.  The bar/lounge is also very cool.  I've had cocktails and appetizers at the bar.  I recommend getting the Rockin Moroccan (vodka, lime, mint, & soda) and the Fizi Tizi (sparkling wine & pomegranate juice).

I am a big fan of the vibe and the atmosphere.  I am a big fan of Terry Alexander.  I have loved everything I have ever tried here, with one minor exception. I ordered a pork chop once and the server said the chef's preperation called for medium.  Having had an issue once with undercooked pork I requested it to be cooked through and through.  No big, right?  Different strokes.  It came out way below medium, as if to taunt me.  And the server rolled his eyes at me.   So the next time I go, if I can get my meat cooked to preference and no eye rolling, you'll get the fifth.  I swear.",0.9602,0.782,0.162,0.056,0.545054945054945

I think it was because the AC was broken because the bus boys were Johnny on the spot with refilling our water glasses. I just think it would have been nice if, when we came in, the hostess would have given us a heads up about the AC issue, because honestly, who wants to try to enjoy a dinner out with friends trying to hurry through your meal because you are so uncomfortable. Okay, two, the food was over salted. We had the scallops and the tilapia and both were very salty. But minus the extra salt, the food would have been very good. Three, dessert. I am a huge fan of dessert. We had the ice cream sandwiches. They were pedestrian, at best. The chocolate ""cookie"" part was so hard when you  went to cut it with your fork, the ice cream completely squished out. Obviously you could not pick them up and take a bite or the ice cream would be all over your shirt. Not a fan. It was pretty loud, crowded and dark, too.  On the plus side, the sundried tomato and oil they serve with the bread is outstanding.  Overall, it was just okay for me.",0.9849,0.777,0.18,0.043,0.5565333333333333

First and foremost, it was hotter than a Kathy Lee sweat shop in there.  I'm not sure if their air was not working but they had, get ready for this, fans set up in the corner. Ooookay. Interesting. To boot, it was so crowded. Yes the place was packed, but they really pack the tables in there. This bordered on tacky.  Quite loud, dark yet nice decor. Our waiter was not great. I got the feeling this was one of his first nights because the manager was watching him. Which brings me to the manager. This guy is great. He hustled all night, visiting tables and making sure all of his customers were happy.   Now on to the food. The menu isn't quite as extensive as I would have liked. Not being very well versed in traditional Mediterranean food, I was not sure what to expect. We started with the seared scallops which were nice. Small-medium sized scallops, seared nicely, with a potato pave and sprout salad. This mixture of texture and taste was a nice balance. The scallops were on the salty side which I'm not sure if they were over salted or if that is the Mediterranean preparation.  For entree, I had the tilapia minus the mascarpone. The tilapia was prepared beautifully. They modified it perfectly (due to lactose intolerance) and were very accommodating with an amazing roasted yellow pepper sauce on the side and gnocchi.  The gnocchi was prepared perfectly with a nice crust on the outside. Soooo good. Again the tilapia was slightly over salted. For desert, my girlfriends split the ice cream sandwiches which they loved.  Nice evening and I'm glad I went but nothing about this place is amazing or would inspire a returned visit, yet good enough to recommend for a nice evening with friends (probably not great for a date due to the lighting and noise level).",0.9992,0.654,0.325,0.021,0.6593827160493828

2007-03-04,4.0,"Tizi Melloul is a memorable experience each time I go.  This place is a combination of modern chic with traditional Mediterranean.  The bar is trendy and cool with these white, half moon style stools.  It's a fun place to sit and talk and enjoy one of their signature cocktails like the Fizi Tizi.  Or if you are adventurous- try their hookah pipe with flavors that change monthly. The main dining room is dark, with copper topped tables and hypnotic sitar music playing in the background.  They have an inventive list of appetizers-try the baba gnanoush, the grilled calamari or the fire roasted mussels- all delicious! For dinner- we usually order a variety of entrees and split them so that we can all taste a wider range of the menu.  The last time we were there- the winners were the grilled lamb with artichokes, the scallops with fava beans and the tuna. The service is consistently good.  The servers are familiar with the menu and do a good job answering questions.  They are attentive without being overbearing. On Sundays- there is belly dancing which is entertaining in itself. If you are driving- there is valet parking out front as street parking is tough in that area.  There is also a public parking garage a couple of blocks down Wells. If you are looking for a unique dining experience with an opportunity to try unusual flavor combinations, set in a colorful environment, then this place is for you.",0.984,0.832,0.146,0.022,0.5668724279835392

Overall our food was yummy.  My dining companions got the pork loin, which I would say was far better than my Kobe beef filet.  The pork loin was accompanied by a balsamic reduction sauce that added a terrific flavor to the dish.  I'm no prestigious baker; however, I think even I could do a better job with a dessert.  We ordered the ice cream cookie tower (ok and a bit difficult to eat) and the oatmeal cake (i thought was tasty, but according to my other friend at the table  tasted like a ""Starbucks muffin"". I must say that I wish they had a more extensive cocktail list - I seem to recall somewhere in the number of 8 unique drinks offered.  A restaurant of this theme and decor would benefit from more unique cocktails.   Overall a unique dining experience - I didn't walk away in love with the place, but I wasn't bummed I spent an evening there either.  Bottom line:  give it a try.",0.9842,0.817,0.167,0.016,0.5676515151515151

The decor is incredible - as far as extremely decorated restaurants go, this is the best one I've been to so far.  Very sexy vibe. The service is impeccable - everyone is friendly, tables are far enough from the next group that you're not hearing about someone else's conversation. The food is very good - the Prince Edward Island Mussels are a must.  This is their signature dish and you can't leave without trying it.  I don't usually like Mussels but their preparation is wonderful.  The appetizers are excellent.  The main entrees themselves are very good but leave a little to be desired.  The desserts are out of this world and this is from someone who doesn't eat many desserts (you'll notice a trend with me, a lot of my compliments are based on convincing me to do things or like things I don't usually like).",0.9872,0.758,0.219,0.023,0.6657333333333333
2006-12-04,4.0,"Once I walked into Tizi Melloul, I felt like I entered a whole new world. The hallway is glowing red and it leads you to the restaurant. The bar/lounge area is very modern and sleek. A beaded curtain is the door to the main dining room. Although the room is dim and dark, it's decorated with plush couches, embroidered pillows, mosaic lighting and candles. It's very contemporary, but has hints of old world charm. My friend and I started our dining experience with two glasses of Tizi Rizi. They were delicious glasses of champagne with pomegranate juice and seeds. Exotic and delicious. We started off with the arugula salad. It was filled with spicy arugula, fennel, polenta croutons, Yukon potatoes, and a lemon vinaigrette. I loved the combinations of all the ingredients. It was very unique and different. The polenta croutons were very salty, but it balanced out the potatoes. I loved my entree. I had the deconstructed chicken basteeya. A juicy chicken breast and small leg of neatly placed on top of the chicken stew. The chicken stew had shreds of white meat made with mushrooms, peas, currant fruit, and almond slivers. It was so savory and sweet at the same time. The currant fruit really gave it a sweet tasty. The texture was wonderful, the meat was moist and soft, but the almonds gave it a crunch. The dish was topped off with a square sheet of phyllo dough. It was more a decorative piece, but you can eat it as well. I highly recommend this dish. Taste and presentation was terrific! My friend had the kobe beef, and this was so good too! For dessert, we had the chocolate fondue. A pot of dark chocolate fondue is served with a platter of ginger flavored pound cake, fresh bananas and strawberries and dried apricots. It was a perfect way to end a delicious meal! The service was attentive and fabulous too! I highly recommend coming here if you're in the downtown area.",0.9985,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.6174312896405919

The decor is very funky and a little like what I imagine the inside of a genie bottle looks like :). The food is amazing here. We started with the Tizi Mezze platter and cocktails. I had a Fizi Tizi (or is it Tizi Fizi), which is pomagranate juice and sparkling wine. Very tasty. The platter had a variety of food, including hummus and a goat cheese puff pastry. For my entree, I had the Pan Seared Skate (a type of white fish) served onto a lump crabcake. Incredible. Everything had a really great flavor to it. For dessert we shared a pumpkin---mascarpone semi fredo, pistachio, apple-black strap molasses preserves. Delish!  The service here is so polished but not pretentious. Our server herself was amazing and the manager on staff was great. They even sent over two glasses of champagne on the house! Yay!
