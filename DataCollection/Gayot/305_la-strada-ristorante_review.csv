2008-10-23,4.0,"Normally I am not much of a fan of Italian restaurants. I often find that their menus are limited and the food is extremely average. I cannot remember having a meal at an Italian restaurant that I considered a positively memorable experience; well before we ate at La Strada Ristorante anyway.  We were staying at the Fairmont Hotel which is just a few minutes walk from the restaurant. There was no coincidence involved here, the weekend was planned (expertly I might add).    Our reservation at La Strada was for a private party. They had drinks at the bar with hors d'oeuvres before we were seated at our tables. The wait staff walked around with bruschetta, portabello strips and absolutely the biggest scallops I have ever seen, and they just happened to be wrapped in bacon. If you have never had scallops wrapped in bacon, you are doing yourself a great disservice. I will say that for some reason I actually prefer smaller scallops for this appetizer, but those offered at La Strada were still delicious.  Dinner was four courses, each enjoyable in its own way. First was the Lobster Bisque. It was served with caviar, which was a first for me. I do not plan to have it again, but the bisque itself was very good. It was also the first time I have had Lobster Bisque with baby shrimp, though truth be told I prefer it with chunks of lobster meat. Call me crazy.  Course number 2 was the Caesar salad. Simple yet I would take a Caesar salad over any other. I have recently had a few bad experiences at other restaurants which use bad Caesar dressings. That was not the case at La Strada. It was the best I have had in awhile.  The third course was my favorite. The irony is that for one who does not like Italian food, typically, my favorite course was the most stereotypically Italian. Looking at the menu online I believe we had the Cappelini Caprese. The website lists it as ""angel hair pasta, light tomato, fresh mozzarella cheese"". Another simple dish, but it was really very good, and the highlight of my dinner.  We finished the dinner itself with a full plate; as if we had not had enough food to this point. Filet, stuffed jumbo shrimp, potato and vegetable side dishes. My filet was really very good. I would not normally order a filet for myself, but had no complaints with the one picked on my behalf; it was delicious. I ate one and a half of the two shrimp, but thought it was a bit much. Having had shrimp in the Lobster Bisque, I had nearly enough earlier in the meal.  What would a good dinner be without dessert, right? They prepared a small sampler for each of us. We had a piece of cheesecake, a baby cannoli, a strawberry dipped in chocolate and the most magnificent mousse I have ever had. I cannot find the mousse on the website which is disappointing because I am curious to exactly what it was, and I would like to give credit where credit is due. One friend had told me on our way into the restaurant that their cheesecake was to die for, which was true, but I would take more of that mousse any day.  The menu items are more expensive, but the food and the atmosphere are worth it at least once. I would imagine La Strada is a pretty popular date spot...if you can afford it. Dress nicely. The restaurant is located at 155 N. Michigan Ave. (312) 565-2200",0.9967,0.783,0.157,0.06,0.5174285714285713

Welcome to the table everyone."" [Collectively] ""Thanks, good to be here."" [Sam] ""Alright, let's get started with a little bio on each of you.  Since Egg Plant and Minestrone came first, let's hear what they have to say first."" [Egg Plant] ""Well thank you.  I'm glad to be here tonight.  Well, I'm on the pre-theatre dinner specials, which for those of you who don't know, are a $32-three course-diverse menu.  If I do say so, which I am, I've been called excellent and cheesy."" [Minestrone] ""Well, I know I come as a surprise, but I can guarantee that you'll be satisfied with me.  I'm a little different than most expect, but my tomato base hasn't garnered many complaints."" [Sam] ""Yes, yes, thank you both.  You look great tonight by the way, as do as the main courses here with us tonight who we're going to hear from now."" [Campanelli] ""Sam you make me blush.  You just want a short blurb here right?"" [Sam] ""Something brief, yes."" [Campanelli] ""Well, since we're on the subject, most people compliment me on my fresh mozzarella and yumminess!"" [Gnocchi] ""You know, I'm well received, as I was tonight.  Thank you Sam.""

[Tirnette] ""You dog!  I'm just going to throw out that I'm authentic."" [Tiramisu] ""Sam your mind's always in the gutter.  But you thought I was delicious though, right?"" [Sam] ""Yes, though I feel that the alcohol in you didn't penetrate as far as it could have."" [Tiramisu] ""I hope that's just a thing for tonight...."" [Sam] ""And you Carrot Cake?"" [Carrot Cake] ""Moist.  I guess moist would be it."" [Sam] ""Yes, thank you all.  We'll be taking a break now, and you'll be hearing from our one-star-from-five sponsors, slightly gross bathroom, lack of parking, and mandatory tip.""",0.9968,0.775,0.194,0.031,0.6132312925170068
2007-09-20,3.0,"My bf lives really close to this place and therefore we've wandered in a couple of time looking for food. We go in knowing exactly what we want - Linguine in Arrabiatta sauce - and so it's unfair to comment on their regular menu.  Not a big fan of their service, although. Portions are HUGE and even when you share, you can't finish. They do charge split-fee.",0.5353,0.826,0.126,0.048,0.42115384615384616
2007-08-08,4.0,"Good 'ole Italian food. Besides pasta, they have steak and fish options too. Little pricey. The decor is old. I love that they serve fresh roasted garlic with the bread. Service as expected.",0.8555,0.755,0.245,0.0,0.39999999999999997
2006-10-15,4.0,"Not sure why the other reviews are so bad!  I went here expecting a mediocre experience and I was delighted at every turn! Yes, it is an older restaurant.  The decor is sort of stale and the atmosphere is pretty typical of what you'd expect of an old, Italian restaurant.  There was a fairly smelly (cigarettes) waft of air in the lobby which my dining companion and I recoiled at (and then panicked that the rest of the restaurant would be just as smelly).  But luckily, the smell didn't penetrate the dining area. Bread, bread-sticks, butter, olive oil, tomato butter (tasty!) and a baked half bulb of garlic were all presented at the onset of dinner.  Good choices!  Our appetizer: some eggplant cheesy wonder was delicious (I think companion is STILL talking about it).  Our pasta wasn't spectacular, but it was tasty.  And I awarded the four stars based on the tastiness of the fresh mozzarella in my pasta alone. And dessert....I had something called a venetian bomb.  Chocolatey extravaganza.  Delicious.  This restaurant is perfect for pre-theater crowd (they even have a theater ""set menu"" of three courses for a cheaper price).  I'd go back before a show, for sure!",0.9733,0.787,0.165,0.048,0.6501207729468599
