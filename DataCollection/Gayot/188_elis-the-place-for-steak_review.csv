2007-04-11,5.0,"This place, better know for its cheescakes, is a solid, old-school steak-house without the stuffy armchairs and low ceilings. Â It has been a while, but the steaks had a depth of flavor, and the creamed spinach was as glutunous as it should be. Compared to the more well-known Morton's or Gibson's, I would give Eli's a shot.",0.1779,0.911,0.06,0.029,0.35
2005-08-14,5.0,"The steak and sides alone are soo delicious and will definitely fill you up. But, no matter how full you are, you are going to be tempted to have their cheesecake. The waitress will present you with a tray full of different cheescake options -- and each different kind is a treat of its own. The food here is great and the dessert definitely shines among everything else. If nothing else, stop in here just for their dessert -- it's an experience you won't want to miss!",0.9559,0.713,0.235,0.053,0.6318181818181818
