2011-08-05,3.0,"My friend and I came here a few weeks ago on a Friday night for dinner at 7 pm. Shockingly, there was only one table that had people on it. I had made a reservation, which clearly wasn't necessary. The atmosphere was strange. I was sitting so that I was facing the kitchen area and I continuously saw the waitresses peep their heads out to check on the two tables that actually had people at them (one was ours). Made it a little awkward because I felt like they were just watching us. There's also a screen set up that was playing pictures on it. Made the restaurant seem confused about what kind of place it was trying to be.  I had a groupon so we had to spend $40 and given the menu, that was a struggle for us. We ordered two little pizzas as an appetizer and once the waitress found out I had a nut allergy, determined that it applied to the pesto and left the pesto off the pizzas. I'm not sure how pine nuts are the same as peanuts, but to her, apparently they are. It didn't taste right that way and once we asked for the pesto, she brought us cold pesto on the side. That didn't help much. We then both ordered the napoleons. The napoleon itself was exactly what I had expected, but lacked any interesting flavor beyond that of the grilled vegetables. The portion size was gigantic and neither one of us finished our plates. We then ordered the bread pudding for dessert since none of the other desserts were available (a little strange). I had never had bread pudding before and my friend reassured me that I would like it. It was pretty decent, but definitely nothing spectacular.  Definitely would not come back. Like other reviews have stated, it wasn't bad food, but it wasn't anything fantastic that I would want to have again. And considering the strange atmosphere and price point, I know I could find a better experience elsewhere.",0.9613,0.817,0.113,0.07,0.518007293007293

Everything we ordered from appetizer to salad to main dish was disgusting.  I cut into my chicken and it was completely pink/appearing uncooked inside!

""Closed for a Private Party"""" sign on the outside.  I understand this happens sometimes, except the windows of One Six One are plate glass, and there was not a soul inside and the doors were locked.  A restaurant closed the weekend before their Groupon is set to expire?  What an easy way to make some cash off people who forget to call Groupon's excellent customer service people for a refund.  I read some of the other yelp reviews, that the restaurant is in foreclosure, and I understand they need to recoup some of their losses...theft is not a sound way for them to do so.

I made a reservation through open table. there were only six people in the place but i still told the server I had a reservation through open table and wanted to make sure she checked me in so I could get my points. She tells me the ""machine"" is down and she thinks the restaurant is dropping out of the program soon anyway... OK but you did not drop out of the program yet....  So no dining points. OK, fine. Moving on, if you look at the website this place looks like a nice, almost elegant spot. In reality it is a large, wide open space with a bunch of empty tables. The menu is pretty limited with mostly burgers and wraps. We're told they just changed their menu a couple weeks ago. So, instead of a nice dinner, we'll be eating bar food.  We ordered 2 chicken skewers for an appetizer. I am not exaggerating when I tell you we waited one hour and 15 minutes for our appetizer! Are you kidding? The server kept telling us it's almost ready but the kitchen is backed up from people ordering from the bar (which seems to be a separate business in a connected building). 75 minutes?? You would think at some point the manager would show his or her face and do a little apologizing. Especially since there were only six people in the entire restaurant.  So we get our appetizer 75 minutes after ordering, then our burgers show up 5 minutes after the appetizer. I guess they don't understand pacing but i guess I should not complain. it's better than waiting another hour for the burgers.  on the good note, the burgers were pretty good.. but it's hard to screw up a burger.

The restaurant is set up with a bar side and casual dining side so we sat in the casual dining area. They were having a private party on the other side so that worked out as well.  Dinner consisted of Samosa's and a spicy chicken sandwich. The Samosas were very flavorful and the fries were definitely worth the extra calories, LOL.Although I wouldn't rate this as a 3 or even 4 star restaurant I would definitely rate it slightly above average in terms of the food.

The entire atmosphere had changed, the decor was different and I was confused after being here just one month ago.

2011-03-20,1.0,"Contiued from Robin's review As we attempted to eat our meals and comprehend how the execution of what seemed like a good concept could go so wrong, we were approach by the manager who up until that moment seemed oblivious to us and, yes, the one other table.  Perhaps he was resting before the 'big rush' at 9:30 (watch check...its 9:15).  He asked about our meal, and our response was simple and to the point 'good concept, but terrible execution.'  Upon our run down of disappointments, he offered to replace our raw potatoes (gee thanks).  He walked away seemingly indifferent to our experience but not before mentioning that they were still working out the bugs (maybe that's why the lights were so bright!) and that they were looking forward to opening their deck this summer (how about a little focus on the task at hand pal?).  By the way, the sweatshirt and jeans were perfect ensemble for his level of professionalism. As we continued on our green porridge/veggie soup and salmon ala bland, our refreshed bowl potatoes arrived...and are you ready...RAW AGAIN!  Still starving, I ordered ketchup and used a piece of potato to feed myself marking the first time I have ever order a condiment at a 'fine dining' establishment.  After clearing away our half eaten plates (to which we gladly bid adieu) the waitress offered to buy us desert.  We cautiously accepted thinking amongst ourselves it couldn't get any worse...but surprise...we received another shocking and horrible surprise.  Question, how does one mess up bread pudding?  Answer, ask their chef.  The bread pudding resembled a dish sponge with cottage cheese stuck to the bottom and a grey mold base.  The mouse had the texture of cold butter with sand mixed in...but with a slight hint of chocolate.  Served in a coffee cup...why? So, starving and dissatisfied we asked for the check which was the only thing served correctly and in a timely manner.  While they comp'd  our deserts and took off a portion of our bill, we would have rather paid full price, and had a satisfying meal and experience.  We left at 10, still 1 of only 2 tables with 'the crowd' still yet to appear (the suspense was killing us).   While we hope they will work things out, we will never tempt fate here again and have determined this was the worst dining experience any of us have ever had.  If you do feel obliged to try, remember to eat before and bring your own potatoes...",-0.9536,0.806,0.085,0.109,0.6046344178697121
2011-03-20,1.0,"Never to have thought it would be needed in a city like Chicago, I was actually looking for a negative star rating for my review of 1.61.  So please subtract 3 stars from this 1 star rating before continuing....yes, it was that bad. Perception versus reality.  We began our gastro nightmare by looking online for a new restaurant to try...and, dare I say, we were very impressed by their website.  That, unfortunately, was the only positive part of our experience.  The decor, food, and even philosophy (interesting for a restaurant but I'll play) as portrayed on the site are quite inviting so kudos to the designer/photographer...but not the copywriter (please see below).  So, we decided to make a reservation...a month in advance...for such a seemingly hot place. We arrived at 7:30 on Friday...thank God we made a reservation because we were told immediately upon our arrival that 9:30 is when this place gets packed.  Defensive and awkward, but nice to know.  The first distress signal went out when we noticed there was only one other couple in the restaurant...who looked at us with a distraught gaze we would later comprehend. After soaking in the 'ambiance'...or lack thereof...we decided to focus on the menu which, at the time, seemed to be a good idea.  We were excited about the cultural diversity, everything sounded fabulous, and decided to start with a few appetizers, Bahama Cakes and Mushroom Pizzete, and ordered some cocktails.  With appetizers in, we seemed to be on our way...cue music from The Twilight Zone. The appetizers arrive.  The crab cakes looked more like fried falafel balls and tasted like the carton the crab was delivered in.  The Pizzete was fine but really how can you mess up mushrooms and pesto on a wheat pita.  Food ordered, we were then put on hold (still with only one other table in restaurant) and allowed to sit, unattended, for 20 minutes until we coerced our waitress for a little drink TLC and not to be heard from or seen again until our main courses arrived 40 minutes later.   As with the website, the dishes appeared wonderful.  But like those wax food displays outside the restaurants in the streets of Miami, they were nothing more than a facade.   The following menu item descriptions are copied directly from the website.  I have taken the liberty of overriding spell check for your entertainment.  See if you can find all the errors... Dish 1 - 'Salmon en croute Center cut salmon seasoned with chinese spices wrapped in a puff pastry served with forbidden black rice, garlic and sauted bok choy with a pickled carrot garnish (China)'  - Um...YEAH RIGHT!  The salmon was served cold...perhaps because its blanket of puff pastry was missing....as was any flavor. Dish 2 - 'Vegetarian Napolean Roasted zuchini, german squash, carrots eggplants potobello mushrooms on a bed of butternut squash rissotto and a red pepper coulis (France)'.  Borrowing from the name, the dish was short on ingredients lost the battle against the pool of overcooked risotto which could have doubled as drywall compound (although the color would be hard to match). Side note.  Not sure if the chef has cataracts but we needed to ask for the spotlights to be dimmed down before our meals arrived.  In hindsight, we may have noticed more had the surgical lights stayed on. Dish 3 - 'Flatiron steak Chimichuri marinated flat iron steak with roasted vegetables and fingerling potatoes (Argentina).'  Meat was fine and the potatoes were fresh...so fresh in fact that it was like biting into an apple.  Checked menu again, yes, these were supposed to be potatoes.   (continued...see Christoph H's review)",0.9834,0.815,0.115,0.07,0.4783043345543346

The boyfriend got the flat steak usually found at Colombian or Argentinian restaurants - served with the chimichuri sauce. They let the flavor of the steak come through by not loaded it down with salt. The salt factor is what typically prevents me from ordering this dish in most places.  For dessert we tried this magical dish called (spelled phonetically) poo-da-crem. The menu on line doesn't match the menu we ordered from so I have no idea how that's spelled. It's like a thick pudding. The top layer is almost ganache like and under that is a creamy layer. Mouthwateringly good!

I wondered why they had no bread or something at the table, but that's not a huge deal.  We started with the duck rolls, which were very good.  Most bites you could really taste the duck, although on a few it got lost and could've been anything in the roll.  The roll itself was crisp to perfection and tasty.  The plum sauce it came with paired very well with the duck (I typically make my duck breast with a raspberry reduction so I know the fruit sauces are a nice compliment).  My husband got the flat steak, which was good.  I have to say my friend's dad is Argentinian so I have a high bar with my chimichurri, so for me that was just okay.  The potatoes and veggies were really good as well.  The real star with my lamb that I got.  This was the second best lamb I've ever had in my life, the best being at an annual picnic I used to go to where they were roasted on spits in front of us.  The lamb was effing awesome.  Go get the lamb, like right now.",0.9934,0.792,0.142,0.065,0.5559275793650794

I tried to conceal my amusement as I looked around the empty restaurant and replied no. In complete seriousness , she goes, ""we-ell, i guess that's okay."" Again, I tried to suppress laughter, but my amusement at her ridiculousness eventually turned to irritation and frustration.  As we sat down, we asked if it was feasible to do dinner in 1.5 hrs since we were trying to make a movie. She actually told us since we were the only people, we could be done in ""30-40 minutes"". Even with only four customers, this didn't seem realistic, but we did our part and ordered right away to get things going.  The menu is all over the place. Each dish seems to be from a different country or region. Is it ever good for a restaurant to attempt trying that many different things instead of just having the chef focus on what s/he is good at? No. This was no exception.  The waitress brought out our appetizer - the duck fall roll - which was not particularly good or bad, but it temporarily satiated us. This was a good thing, because we did not really get to touch much of our meals. About ten minutes before we needed to leave, our dinners had not arrived. When our waitress finally came back to the table so that we could let her know we really needed to leave soon, she replied with 'well your food is on the way' with a very 'I Dont See What The Big Deal Is' tone. Eight minutes later, and the food still hadn't arrived. I was about to go find her to let her know we needed to leave, when she arrived with the food. I asked if she could also bring us our check and to-go boxes, since we needed to leave.  In the time it took for her to get back to the table, we started on our meals. My dish, the clay over lamb consisted of flavorless, old-tasting lamb surrounded by artichoke and peppers from a jar, NO figs (as listed in the description), and potatoes with eyes. I pointed out the potato eyes to the waitress, and she just looked at me like 'what's the big deal?' I mentioned that generally you eyes on a potato mean that it's old. She still didn't get it, so I asked to speak to a manager.  The owner was friendly; however when I explained to him my concern about the potato eyes, he insisted they were in fact fresh. I didn't argue, but I definitely googled this when I went home. Potatoes don't start sprouting eyes unless they have been sitting around. And why wouldn't you scrub them off? Ew freaking gross.  I also mentioned our frustration about the delay after being upfront that we were trying to make it to a movie and that we were already late, and had tickets.

Six One that I had to question myself about why I didn't enjoy my dining experience here at all.  Then I read the reviews (something I should have done prior to going apparently), because they are clearly across the board from good to bad.  Unfortunately, my experience wasn't on the good side. My fiance had a Groupon for this place so we decided to check it out last Saturday night.  I had made reservations thinking this place would be packed for a Saturday at 7pm, but it was quite the opposite when we arrived.  We were seated right away and the host was very polite.  Once at our table, a waitress came by with menus, but then didn't come back for what felt like almost 10 minutes (though in all fairness I was starving and what may have been only a few minutes felt like eternity).  When she did arrive, she brought our water and asked if we'd like anything to drink.  We decided to order a glass of red wine each, which took another 10 minutes to come out (this really did take 10 minutes). Our waitress was very nice and helped us out with choosing some good vegetarian options from the menu, I will give her that.  I am really not sure why the service was so slow when there were only 6 other tables in the pace. Onto the food though - what happened?!  I was so excited about trying the different small plates of global cuisine.  If I had to rate this solely on presentation, I would give it 4 stars; however, food should taste as good as it looks.  We ordered the falafel and the samosa, and both fell short of spices and flavor you'd normally expect to find from those regions of the world.  I didn't want to waste our Groupon so my fiance convinced me to get an entree.  We ordered the Eggplant sautee, again at the waitresses recommendation, and I was further disappointed.  The eggplant was fried and not sauteed for sure, and it tasted like they had fried it in either really old oil, or oil used to fry fish.  When I inquired the waitress said it was fresh oil that wasn't used for anything else - so maybe it was just bad oil?  I couldn't finish my entree and had no desire to stick around for dessert even though we still had a few dollars to use on our Groupon. Having read the positive reviews though, I wonder if they were having an off night and I should give it one more chance.  Maybe over the summer.  Winter is a tough time for everyone I guess.",0.9848,0.816,0.122,0.062,0.47263364941936375
2011-01-30,3.0,"Preface: I am math nerd to the extreme. I am obsessed with Euclidean math. I was the embodiment of the golden ratio for Halloween last year. Yes. I wore a golden dress and a golden belt with the equation on it, and golden stockings. I had a ""line"" to demonstrate the proof which was made with a painted stick of wood. It even had endpoints on it.  So begins my story, when my sister made reservations at one.six one and told me that ""I would appreciate the name of the restaurant."" I was confused. I had no idea. What the heck is one.six one? What does that have to do with? And so, my sister replied with disappointment, ""1.61 is the Golden Ratio. That's what you were for Halloween, right?"" Let me just briefly say: 1.61 is not the golden ratio. Approximately 1.618 is the golden ratio. Naming a place almost the golden ratio is like celebrating almost Pi Day: March first is not Pi Day, because 3.1 is not Pi. Approximately 3.14 is Pi--so we celebrate Pi Day on March 14th. Does that make sense? I feel like a jerk, but I feel the need to defend a truth like mathematics especially if it has something to do with the realm of our senses, like taste, for example. Because here's what I think: Just as 1.61 is almost but not the golden ratio, One. Six One is almost but not the best restaurant. It aims to achieve something that is unique and great: a calm, cool atmosphere that is welcoming and comforting, with dishes to create a perfect harmony. And yet, it sort of doesn't. I love the dining atmosphere, but the surrounding artwork is a little bit of a hodgepodge. I get the guitars and the nautilus shells and the literal aesthetic of the golden ratio, but it doesn't really come together in a way that gives me a feeling of harmony. Regarding the food, I'll say the same. My sister and I had several appetizers that pointed toward an appreciation of global tastes, and yet didn't really use those ingredients with the fullness they could offer. An example would be the duck spring role: ground duck wrapped into a spring role and deep fried. The flavor of the duck was ground up and fried up: both texture and taste are lost in this process. The mushroom pizette was mushroom + sundried tomatos + feta on pita bread. Mediterranean essentials brought together to create something that they're not: a pizza. No crisp, no excitement, though good enough for the goodness of the individual ingredients. We ordered two different chocolate desserts which pretty much tasted the same and were decorated with the same sauces.  If you asked me what kind of meal to expect at One.Six One, I'd say one that has very different parts so that you have an exploratory, rather than wholesome, experience. But One.Six One does have something great, and that is virtue. It aims for something wonderful and you can tell that the people who work here aim to achieve that perfect harmony. Our waitress was probably thee best part of the experience: she was friendly, accommodating, and always always happy to serve. I appreciate the philosophy and aims of this restaurant--it may not be completely accurate or perfect, but it's aiming for something, and it's trying real hard. For that reason alone, I appreciate this place. I may not return solely for the food or the math, but I will return to be in a good place with good people, who aim for good things like the golden ratio.",0.9988,0.74,0.205,0.055,0.5590940274414851
2011-01-29,1.0,"Awful, I haven't eaten anything this bad in Chicago. Granted I've eaten at some of the top restaurants here in Chicago but I do enjoy smaller no-name restaurants. However, this place was disappointing.  Let's start with the decor, they have taken the minimalistic approach very seriously, the place is bare. Then a bunch of random decorations ranging from guitars to shells to Japanese room divider.  After getting over the decor, I thought they could redeem themselves with good food, but that didn't happen. We ordered the bruschetta, worst I've had, there was so much onion I couldn't taste anything but raw onion plus there was no olive oil or any dressing on it and the bread they used was too thick.  Then 25 mins, after we finished the app, the food finally arrived. Again, disappointed. I ordered the Moroccan Lamb, cooked ""medium rare"" more like medium well, then there wasn't any Moroccan spice as promised, actually no spice at all. The sides didn't help the situation either, potatoes were undercooked and tasted only of thyme (when promised cumin flavor). And the artichoke hearts and grilled bell peppers were straight out of the can.  My friend ordered the Flat Iron Steak with Chimichurri, not so tasty either, instead of olive oil for the chimichurri sauce they used butter, and a lot of it, which made the steak taste greasy.  I had a living social certificate for $40, we spent $38, so the sever asks if we would like to order something for dessert or just add on the $2. Guess what I chose....""Just add on the 2 bucks"". I had to get out of there.  I highly do not recommend this place, I don't know why this place is getting good reviews.

2011-01-26,1.0,"I regret that I have to give this place even one star. It was the worst experience I've had dining out in Chicago so far. Really! First of all, let me start with the ambience- it was like sitting in a Chipotle that was badly decorated like a sophomore apartment- I'm talking the cheap kitchy art you buy at Bed Bath and Beyond. It was stark, completely uninviting, let alone romantic. You could see right into the kitchen from every angle in the restaurant. Ever heard of a door? No one wants a seat right by the kitchen when they walk into a restaurant, and there was barely a table in the place where you could sit and not see right in. Secondly, I felt like I was on an episode of Kitchen Nightmares... like this place had just opened and was struggling to stay open, and meet the demands of having an almost-full restaurant. None of the soups on the menu were available. Instead, they offered cream of broccoli I believe, and something else run-of-the mill.  They were also out the caprese salad. We ordered 2 apps- the sun dried tomato pizza, which is decent, and the crab cakes, which were pretty bland. For dinner we ordered the steak, for lack of anything else on the menu (a whopping maybe 8 entrees that were pretty unappealing) and we not only waiting an agonizing 25-30 minutes for it to finally arrive, but when it did, it was so loaded with chili seasoning, we could barely eat it. We don't remember there being a mention of it being spicy on the menu. Lastly- our so-called margaritas were the WORST we've ever had.  It was like lemonade made from a powder with a lemon and a lime in it and cheap cheap tequila. We both felt sick when we got home and we only had one and the less-than-mediocre meal. Overal-- DO NOT EAT HERE if you are hoping for a romantic date night let alone a restaurant with ANY kind of ambience.  You can have a more romantic date in a Chipotle and at least not wait forever for your food to come.

2011-01-22,4.0,"This place was quite good for a random night on the town.  I'd bought a LivingSocial coupon to it, so tonight I took the opportunity to go with a friend to try it. First, before we ordered, the waitress brought an amuse-bouche for us.  I can't remember the name, but it was an Indian street snack with puffed rice and crisps.  Light and tasty.  For appetizers, we order the Duck Fall Roll which turned out to be a very thin fried spring roll with duck filling and plum sauce.  Very Chinese.  It was good, but the fried flavor was too strong to be paired with duck.  I would have saved the duck for something else. Entrees came out about ten minutes after our appetizers were removed.  I got the oven roasted lamb, she got the salmon en croute.  Both were excellent.  I can see how one might think that the salmon was undercooked, but rare is good.  My lamb was also very good, although rather smaller than I had expected.  Next time I'll know not to starve myself beforehand. For dessert, the lava cake.  Sublime.  This was really excellent and quite reasonably priced. Service was slower than I'm used to, but that's fine.  I don't mind taking my time with a meal.  I would rather have slow service and a nice meal than feel rushed while eating.  And seriously, these were college kids serving us.  As a college kid myself, I know they probably don't want to be working in a restaurant.  Considering that fact, I think the service was quite good. In total, the meal cost $52.  After applying the coupon, we each paid $10.  Great prices for the quality offered. Overall, I'll be back.  This place is worth a second try.",0.9954,0.808,0.182,0.011,0.5177011494252873
2011-01-21,4.0,"I found this place on Yelp one night when my husband and I were searching for a BYOB place outside our little four block comfort zone.  This place didn't fit the BYOB bill but I tucked it away for another fun date night.  About a week later was when the Groupon came out and it was like a sign from above. We went on a random Thursday night without reservations around 6:30pm and it was pretty empty.  By the time we left around 8:30pm the place was pretty comfortably packed. The owner (I assume he was the owner) was pretty awesome.  He stopped by a couple times and we chatted a bit, my husband complimented the cool water glasses and he was really flattered since he was the one who picked them out.  He was proud of his place and it was cute, there were lots of really interesting touches in the details so he should be. The menu is interesting, a little bit of everything from everywhere which is perfect for me because I always want to eat tacos with like orange chicken and chocolate cake.  We started with a bottle of red wine and the crab cakes, which were perfect.  I could have used some more of the sauce on the side or maybe my husband just ate it all and I didn't notice. I had the airling chicken and he had the flatiron steak, both were really good.  The green beans that came with mine, eh... they were kind of a take it or leave it addition.  The fettucine was good, perfectly cooked.  His chimichurri was especially delicious. We probably made the mistake of ordering dessert exactly when their little rush happened so we could have been out by 8pm but instead it was closer to 8:45pm after waiting quite a while for the dessert and then flagging her down for the check.  I'd agree with those who say the service is a tad slow but I think they are new and just need to figure some things out still.  The dessert was just meh, chocolate tarte I think?  Probably not worth the wait for it.

2011-01-17,2.0,"I was terribly disappointed by this place. Terribly.  First thing to put me off: As soon as my friend and I sat down, we were told none of the soups on the menu were available. We were then told the two soups they did have which sounded like what I could get at Panera Bread. I'm not saying that to be witty or snarky, it's just an honest descriptor. Second thing:  The in-house menu was missing items that I saw on their online menu. Specifically, the appetizer AND entree I wanted to order.  I was really displeased at this point and wanted to leave, but I had already bought my Groupon and made the journey out there. So, I decided to make do and not make a fuss. Third thing:  I ordered the Salmon en Croute. I have somewhat mastered making things en croute at home. I know as an eater and cook how this should come out. While it looked nice on the plate, I was beyond offended that the salmon was not done throughout most of it.  Salmon. Mine needs to be raw or done. Not idling in-between. The spinach inside the pastry shell with the salmon was overcooked. And if that wasn't bad enough, the bottom of the puff pastry was burnt. How is the bottom burnt, but the fish not done??? :-/ Unacceptable. Fourth thing:  The waitress came by right after we got our entrees to ask how it was. We didn't see her again for while. Shortly after she came the 'one' time, my friend noticed something was missing from her plate. It was one of the main things that made her choose Clay Oven Lamb; the buttered figs. We were able to inquire on her missing item when were basically done, cause that's when the waitress reappeared. She goes to ask the chef. She then relayed back to us that figs were out of season so that's why they are missing, the menu just doesn't reflect that. WTF?  How hard is it to print new menus that DO reflect what you are actually serving?How hard is it to update your menu online to reflect what you are actually serving? How hard is it to cook fish until it's done, but not burn the bottom of the pastry? How hard is it to come back again and make sure we don't need refills on water or want to order something else? When there is barely anyone else in the restaurant??  We both came in there with high hopes. I couldn't even feel relieved I had a Groupon on this one. I only give it a 2nd star because it has a doorway to the neighboring The Bar 10 Doors which kept me from having to walk back out into the cold to get there. Yep.

2010-12-29,2.0,"Ok...where do I start.... We made a reservation more than a month in advance for a party of 15 people. One would assume that they would at least have enough time to prep for the day (such as having enough staff to work for that night). I am going to rate this restaurant based on the standard three categories: Food Quality, Service and the Interior Decor. (1) Food quality - overall the food is decent, nothing exceptional. One could go to any fusion restaurants in town and expected the same quality of food. Basically, to me, the food is pretty much like a neighborhood Cheese Cake Factory (with scarce selection of food). So....just imagine a Cheese Cake Factory that is opened only for the neighborhood. Before you read any further, let me tell you that the food quality is the only thing that is preventing me from giving this restaurant a ONE star. Not sure if this is a good thing or bad thing...I guess its like a guys losing hair and had to be bald but ended up actually looking decent being bald... (2) Service - hmm.......the waitress is awfully nice....but I am not that nice to keep my mouth shut. The service was.....TERRIBLE.....wait.....maybe the term ""Horrendous"" would be more appropriate. We waited for at least 20-30 mins for EACH of our drink to arrive. The food was pretty much cold when it was served  When we are the largest table for the night, I would expected at least above average services (which we did not receive). The waitress was very nice that night, given that some of my friends were a bit rude by making some not-so-nice comments. But still...the horrendous services overshadow the kindness of the server. And they charged us an 18% service fee. I would consider myself generous for giving them a 15% service fee. (2) Interior decor - Imagine a loft designed by a straight couple who shops at TJ Maxx and knows nothing but K-Mart. The place is really awkwardly designed. The tables were uneven. The chairs were uneven. The glasses had stains on them. The Da Vinci art work projected on the wall and the snow flakes projected on the wall were just one word....""huh!?"".  It had NOTHING to do with the overall theme of the restaurant. On one end we have the fire place with comfy coaches while on the other end we have art works by Da Vinci projected on the wall....seriously...who designed this?! Oh and did I say that this is a loft...so a cozy fire place from the 18th century design totally does not go with the loft contemporary design....seriously...pay some money and have someone design it for you. OH....and please remove the Da Vinci artwork projection on the wall....that was just out of place.   This restaurant has some potential. A potential as much as Paris Hilton can become a good singer. If I were I would avoid this restaurant if possible, in case you did not get what I am trying to say.",0.8298,0.854,0.081,0.065,0.5657407407407407

The best part of our evening was that the manager listened to our concerns and did not charge us of any of our entrees. He does get my respect and I appreciate his effort to make the best of a very bad situation. What happened? Our service was terrible, but I think our server was not a regular (I certainly hope not). We didn't have enough menus and not all of our water glasses were filled. It took forever just to order our first bottle of sparkling wine, which did not arrive for 20 minutes or so. Our second bottle was red wine, and we had to stop him from pouring the red wine into our champagne glasses (without of course letting us check the label or sample the bottle). The food service was also unbelievably slow, but I don't blame our server for that. To add perspective, we were seven of eleven total diners that evening, so it wasn't as if there was a lot of distractions. In addition to the service we had some major food issues. On the positive side, our starters weren't that bad. We all enjoyed our chicken satay (a nice and spicy peanut sauce, and the mushroom pizette was decent though cold. Their version of a caprese salad was ok but weird. There was plenty of mixed green lettuce (strange for caprese), only two slices of tomato and little mozzarella balls. Pesto was also added for creativity. Not a disaster, just strange. Another highlight was Ashley's lobster bisque (possibly the best dish of the night), though she ordered it as an appetizer and arrived with the main course. This did not matter in the end because our entrees all arrived cold. Collectively we sampled the lamb, chicken, steak and noodles with tofu. Erica's steak was almost inedible given the amount of salt and butter used. I don't know about Carson's lamb, but Jon did not touch his chicken or vegetables. Sara and I had the noodles with tofu, and we had our own thoughts. Actually, I finished my dish and thought it was not very good but worth consuming. What we did not expect was how much hot spice was used. There was no warning preparing us for the excessive sweat inducing heat. I happen to love spicy food, but even I know that kind of spice needs a warning label and is borderline consumable for the general public. Yes, the two hour ordeal was as bad as it sounds. Like I said, the manager comped the entrees, which was the appropriate action in my opinion (we enjoyed the alcohol and the starters were only ok but edible). This is an example of an interesting concept (plates from around the world), with a nice interior (cozy lounge and all) but poor execution.

For appetizers, he ordered the tacos (which were super average----just a corn tortilla with a couple of beef chunks, corn and lettuce, shredded cheese thrown on it) and I ordered the caesar salad which was bagged lettuce with oil/vinegar and grated parm cheese. My bf ordered the bbq brisket, which consisted of 3 long slices of brisket, each of which had about 1/3 of fat on them. I ordered the spicey soba noodles which were so over spiced---almost as if they just took noodles and stirred in rooster sauce. I love spicey food-but all I tasted was rooster sauce. We were the only guests there and for whatever reason, it took about 30 min for our appetizers and about 40 min for our main courses to come out.  We won't be going back here.",0.128,0.901,0.045,0.053,0.5125816993464052

I have been coming here since it opened, the food menu has been changing some since but it keeps getting better over time. I was pretty anxious for the bar to open up even though I don't really drink much. I figured it'd be my Cheers if I ever did do the bar thing.  Took me a while to write a review for this place. I am not sure how fair it is writing a review for a business when I am really good friends with the owners but the rating I gave it is pretty sincere. I see that there are a bunch of 2 star reviews, and on further inspection, the people are friends with an ex employee who is probably really disgruntled. Disgruntled enough to tell his friends to try to talk this place down. Oh well. Facebook's mutual friends search ftw!

We each had an appetizer, a soup and a salad, so we tried six items on the not very extensive menu.  None of them were better than average and each of the three that I tried were disappointing.  The samosas were bland.  The tomato soup was only lukewarm and not very interesting to taste.  My wife's corn chowder came out cold, though it was clearly intended to be hot.  She thought the Arancini was alright, though. The wait staff was friendly, but it took us two hours to eat without even ordering an entree.  The wait time between courses was glacial and unexplainable. Finally, there was a large screen playing top chef Masters, which was distracting and also seemed inappropriate given the rest of the setting.  We will not be returning.",0.7542,0.848,0.103,0.05,0.650625763125763

The dessert (creme brulee) was cold and soupy.  Kind of gross actually.  As for the non-food aspects of this restaurant, the newly-renovated place lacked a coherent decorating scheme.  Some parts of the very large room had seashells peppered about, another parts had a candle-lit fireplace, while yet others featured too many paintings grouped together awkwardly on the wall.  Not to mention the very large TV they had on in the center of the room playing tapes of ""Top Chef"" (hint: not a good idea to set diner's expectations that high).  Finally, the menu itself was very small and not coherent.  They had about 7 entrees, all from different parts of the world, and 2 of which they were not serving. On a good note, the waiters and waitresses were very kind.  On the whole though, I felt that this place was trying way too hard and was just not ready for primetime.",0.9491,0.797,0.14,0.062,0.5418231292517005

The food is mediocre (I mean it's not rubber or stale). The bread is horrible. Basically just white bread. I don't know what the heck other reviewers are talking about when they are blogging about the ""delicious"" bread. Literally...white...bread... The ""fall"" salad we got was just greens with cranberrys some feta cheese or something and a light vinagrette. Hardly good and something I could have thrown together in 1 minute. For ""snack"", we got the baked risotto, which ended up tasting like a big tater tot over some type of tomato sauce. Not horrible but definitely not something I'd order again. We got the fish and the tandoori lamb for enteres, both of which were very salty, not very flavorful. Not quite bland but missing the spice/flavor that international plates should have. The veggies for the lamb were really weird and I had NO idea what it was. Not good. The portions are ok sized. The only thing that was GOOD was the Creme de Pot for dessert. I would recommend getting that if anything at One Six One. I really hate giving such a bad review because the people are nice enough and the place has such potential. The decorations and decor are pretty cool for the UIC/Halsted area.

The table next to us tried to get the waitress' attention 3-4 times for their check and she seemed underwhelmed and oblivious. At another table of 6-7 people, everyone got their meal except for one person and he had to remind the waitress.

2010-08-14,5.0,"I've been around the world and i i i  i can't eat no mooore. Seriously. I might have gone around this entire menu and I have greatly enjoyed everything I have tried. As someone who's interested in exploration of neighborhoods, cities and the world at large, the concept of a menu based around global tastes really appeals to me. To begin with, the space is really inviting. The seating is comfortable, the tables are well-spaced and the glassware/plating is very cool. I like that I feel at home when dining here. The dining room also has a couch/fireplace/extra area. I am guessing when the weather turns, that aspect of the room might fit a little better. As it is, it's a little distracting. As a female friend told me, that portion of the room needs a female touch. Guys. Female. Stat. Cool. Since One. Six One is run by some very cool kats, that shouldn't be a problem. But, enough with the HGTV spiel. Food. This is what you're interested in, right? Good. You're in the right place. I have gone around the entire menu. I'll guide you from start to finish. App: Drums. These stylized chicken drums are incredibly flavorful and extremely addictive. Served as three lollipops, the drums are easy to eat, nicely meaty and come with hoity-toity buffalo and bleu cheese sauces. I am loathe to share these. Also VERY good: samosas. Soup: Gumbo. The former New Orleanian in me orders this every time, despite the hot weather. I don't know it for fact, but I wonder if the dish comes with some sort of sherry. The reason I ask is that it has a sightly turtle soup flavor (and I LOVE turtle soup... although thinking about it in the abstract makes me feel badly). Thick and hearty, this gumbo is packed with duck, okra and rice. The Michael-Jackson-Janet-Jackson-'Scream' bowl is a nice touch. Also VERY good: cauliflower soup. Cauliflower? I _know_! Salad: Beets and Apple. I hate beets. They gross me out. No matter how they are prepared, these are not the sweet, tart cranberry-sauce looking things they should be. They are dirty, dusty, muddled veggies that taste like earth. Surprisingly, this salad, with its small cubed beets and beet puree, really works. I think it's the addition of the tart Granny Smith pickled apple spheres and acid from the lime. Congrats on the expert combinations, Chef Alexander. Also VERY good: Pea salad. And, I hate peas almost as much as I hate beets. Drink: Liquor license in hand, get a Green Line draft from next door Bar Ten Doors (it took me far too long to get that). Entree: Tandoori lamb. Tell me if any of this doesn't sound delicious: lamb, eggplant puree, pickled onions, mango, vindaloo, cumin fingerling potatoes. No? I didn't think so. Eat this and do not share. Also VERY good: Crab and Crawfish. Service: Lauren W is totes awesome. Ask to sit in her section. Dessert: coffee served in a cool cup with cream and brown sugar. This is the warm up. For real, for real. Get the pot de creme. Since I can't do it justice in words, I won't. Just know that it's the perfect substitute for all the Jenna Jamesoning and Long Dong Silvering you may not be experiencing in real life. I order two of these desserts. Whoa. Just thinking about the pot de creme makes me want a cigarette. It's that good... and I am a very sad man. Also VERY good: the churros and hot chocolate. As Taylor Street experiences a rebirth, One.

The concept sounds great-- a mix of dishes from around the world- however we both agreed they're trying too hard.  The place was pretty empty, but it's too be expected for being new--- but the outside area was full-- since the weather was so great, the inside had about 4 tables full.  The dinner started off to a rocky start. My water glass was rimmed with dust-- a thick thick layer...which of course, i only noticed after a sip. The wait staff swiftly and politely got me a new glass, and were very apologetic, but I was already getting concerned.  Then the appetizers came-- and we were happily surprised.. they were good -- my gumbo was delicious and his fish tacos were yummy...nothing mind blowing. But we both were cautiously optimistic to see how our meals were going to turn out.  We each got a main course- me the steak dish and him the Greek chicken. The chicken idea was cool- but it was just a de constructed gyro.. Nothing mind blowing about it except the price. My steak meal was a half moon of tough steak that my BF could have eaten in one bit... however, due to the texture and taste, I didn't even finish. The mushrooms were great quality and looked interesting, but the taste just wasn't there. The only good thing was the swirl of cauliflower puree they used in the plating.  We had wanted to save room to split the bread pudding we read about-- but we were ready for our meal to be over...  Good luck one 6 one.

2010-07-24,3.0,"The staff of OneSixOne couldn't have been more accommodating. However, it seemed odd that while we had a 7:45 reservation, they still had to pull in several of their patio tables from outside (complete with patio chairs) in order to accommodate our group. It took awhile before our orders were taken, and even longer before our bottle of wine was brought to the table. A quick note on the subject of booze: when 3 out of your 4 cocktails are made with vodka, I don't order a cocktail. Vodka is boring. The bread was really, really good. It came with a compounded herb butter, a delicious complement. The fennel salad was impressive. Very well plated and appealing. Between the fennel itself and all the citrus flavors, it kind of felt like a Corpse Reviver No 2 in salad form. Delicious.  My entrée, the fish special, which was a pan seared tuna, seemed a little less composed. It was a small chunk of tuna, maybe about 1/3 the size of a banana, on a bed of overly spicy Indian pickle, with some white bean puree. I'm not sure that all the different elements of the dish really matched together. Nevertheless, I was hungry, and finished my chunk of tuna and mismatched ingredients.

After about 10 mins of looking at our menus, our server came by (inside) and asked us if we were ready to place our order, as the kitchen was getting backed up.  First, I never want you to admit that to me.  Secondly, we looked around and MAYBE 1/4 of the inside tables were occupied.

The service could not have been better - our server accurately suggested how many plates we should get to share for our group, the manager came over twice to make sure we were doing ok, and while we started sitting outside in the patio, when it started to rain, they kindly told us they already had a table ready for us inside! On to the food...for starters, we had the arancini, tacos, and drumsticks...all delicious!  Then we moved on to the white bean soup - so flavorful and tasty!  I have to say that although I'm not weird about sharing food with people, some people might think it's a little strange to share soup.  You don't put it in different bowls, but rather all use spoons to eat out of the same bowl.  We were fine with it and again, it was absolutely delicious! For the main course, we had the chicken and potatoes, crab and crawfish, and the lamb.  Everything was so good - the crawfish was amazing, the chicken was so tender and the lamb was great!

Six One for dinner a few days ago, and on our walk over (she lives close) we were discussing food and arancini (rice croquettes stuffed with cheese and fried) that I used to make a lot and haven't made in a while.  As soon as we walked into the space (and were warmly greeted and seated, of course) we noticed that the chef must have been reading our mind- as arancini were on the appetizers section of the menu!  We promptly ordered those and proceeded to read the rest of the menu.   Each dish on the menu is inspired by a different cuisine and region of the world and is meant to be shared- like a tapas restaurant.  We decided to share the beef dish and the lamb dish.     The presentation was incredible, the ingredients were very high quality and the food was executed to perfection.  (plus, the portions weren't as small as tapas restaurants)   The beef was a duo of steak and braised beef, with mushrooms and cauliflower puree.  The steak was amazingly tender and flavorful and the knife cut through it like butter.  The braised beef was luscious (and not just heavy and one-note, like in some other places), the mushrooms were wild mushrooms (as opposed to the button mushrooms you tend to get at restaurants) and the creamed spinach and cauliflower puree were delicious and helped accent each component of the dish.     The lamb was tandoor baked and super flavorful.  Accompanied with delicious potatoes, pickled onion and a wonderfully sweet chutney that accented the lamb perfectly.      For dessert we shared the pot de creme and the bread pudding.  Again, the presentation was exquisite and each dessert was executed to perfection (it is obvious that the chef in this restaurant is an actual chef- and not just a cook).     The pot de creme was silky and has a toffee flavored layer on top and a chocolate cream under it.  The bread pudding was sweet (but not overly so) with caramel and toffee.   Even the toffee they use to garnish the plate is home-made (and not the syrup-y stuff I have seen at far too many restaurant- and I'm not talking cheap or chain restaurants- Chefs, you know who you are, finishing your perfect dessert with canned syrup IS very noticeable!)   By the time we were eating dessert (with a cup of tea) we were stuffed, but the owners (who know my friend) gave us a cannoli dessert (how could we possibly pass that up?).     The cannoli is a deconstructed version of a cannoli.  With vanilla ice cream and chocolate chips and cookie and a bit of caramel- again, perfect.     We were never rushed- even after we paid- and were even offered more water for our tea (did I mention this was AFTER we paid).   I can't wait for them to get their liquor license (I imagine they'll have wine pairings for the food) and will definitely be back- especially for desserts.",0.9919,0.889,0.108,0.003,0.6513645833333334

Gordon Ramsey would have been pissed. Once it was cooked through it was tasty but the eggplant mush that it was on top of was very unappetizing same goes for the lamb bacon and bacon is always good.  After seeing rave reviews for the desserts we decided to try the churros. They should be called ""churro bites"" because that's what they are. The chocolate that came with them was awesome and spicy but we needed about 4 more churros to actually enjoy it.  I think this place has potential but it has some major kinks to work out.

2010-07-05,4.0,"One.Six. One is the golden ratio. That perfect balance that artists and mathematicians use to predict symmetry. At One.Six One, the restaurant- this balance is seen in a mixing of flavors and tastes from around the world.  As of this writing, they do not have their liquor license yet but, according to the owner, should have it by the end of July. So call first and see if you should BYOB.  Located on Taylor Street (just west of Racine), this is the newest addition to the Little Italy neighborhood. It's located in a new building, that is a little commercial looking on the outside and lacking any ornamentation. That simplicity continues inside the restaurant where the decoration is minimal save for the large comfy couches that are arranged around a fireplace as the focal point of the room. A disconnect for me was that they were also showing some ""Spartacus"" type movie in the main dining room which I didn't understand at all. Oh well.  We chose to sit outside on the side patio. A large space that one day will be looking over a park. And since it is situated on the east side of the building- all that hot afternoon sun is blocked by the building which is a nice plus. The furniture out there is a bit bulky but certainly functional. I think when this place takes off- they will probably have to replace the furniture with smaller tables so that they can get more people on the patio. But for now- enjoy- as the tables are large,and the space between them also roomy so you don't feel like you are sitting on each other.  The food was quite good. It is all sharable so we started with the Hummus, Ceviche and Drums. The Drums were amazing-truffled chicken mousse served with buffalo sauce and a blue cheese fondue.  Next up- cauliflower soup, and arugula salad- both good although they need to invest in some soup spoons as table spoons were all they had to eat the soup with.  Finally the entrees. I had the beef dish which was a braised short rib and a filet au poivre. My friend had the chicken which had sort of a Greek flavor to it with dill, lemon and yogurt. Both were great, and while this sounds like alot of food- keep in mind that potion sizes are small so that you can taste a wide range of the menu.  Earlier in the evening- I had met a bartender down the street who told me I had to save room for the bread pudding for dessert. She was right! It was amazing- and looked beautiful in a bowl drizzled with caramel!  If there was a new restaurant glitch, it was in the area of service. Service was a bit off. The server waiting on us was brand new to serving and really needed to work on taking care of the customer. She told us they were out of several things- yet later when we talked to the chef- he said he could have made us anything that we asked for. So know before you go - if there is something that you want (like a fish dish) push the server to go and talk to the chef. Pacing was also off as dishes came up a bit helter skelter and since some of the food was not sharable (soup for example) at times one of us was eating while the other sat there.  Want to know one of my favorite parts of the evening? A server in another area (Lily) is studying to be an opera singer. Twice throughout our evening, she stood and sang portions of an operatic aria, table side, out on the patio for all of us to enjoy. Bravo!  It's great to see a new addition come to Little Italy. So many places have moved out in recent years that something coming into the area is big news. And if the owner is right- their restaurant is only the first of several to open up this year.  While they are still working out a few of the ""new restaurant "" issues, the majority of the experience is spot on. Check it out. You'll be surprised at how a night in Little Italy, can have you tasting food from around the world, without ever leaving your seat!",0.9974,0.886,0.103,0.01,0.4768602693602692

From reviews and pictures, we were expecting a really awesome set-up, but the patio itself was kind of lackluster. It's situated next to a large open lot and had the feeling of being in someone's back yard in the suburbs. The interior of the restaurant was ok but felt like more of a spa (the new agey music, minimalist design, etc) than a restaurant. I'm all for creativity and creating an experience via ambiance but this just seemed all too intentionally thought out and trying too hard - just didn't come across as authentic. The menu was small but interesting. It almost was if they compiled a list of things made on Top Chef and threw them onto one menu. In other words, TRYING REALLY HARD to be creative but with that same lack of authenticity feeling behind it.  Ordered:  Gumbo (tasty) Arugula salad (tasty) Fish tacos (didn't try but they were described as ""ok"") Three of us had the beef dish which consisted of a tiny piece of fillet and a pretty small portion of braised short ribs - flavor on both was good. Other dish ordered was the lamb and it came out completely RAW. It was sent back and brought out properly cooked and the waitress said it would be taken off the bill, which was nice. Here's the kicker - when the bill came - ALL FOUR OF OUR ENTREES WERE COMPED so the meal was $26 (mind you, it's currently BYOB, but still, that's a pretty unbelievable gesture on their part). Oh yeah, they also provide ""free not fresh lemonade"" which would have been a nice compliment to some summertime vodka cocktails had we brought any ...  So anyway, I woke up this morning to do some online banking and noticed the $26 charge from dinner. Oh yeah, there was also another charge on my account for $83 and unless they secretly decided to charge me for the 4 dishes that were comped (they would have been right around this amount); I'm assuming the waitress (who throughout the meal was nice but very green) ran someone else's tab on my card. Awesome. Nothing like the headache of having to deal with incorrect restaurant charges ...  Anyway, I doubt I'll be back (unless of course it's having to stop by to pick up my $83) ... ________ Quick update - since posting the review 3 days ago, I've received 3-4 emails from the owners apologizing for the mix-up and info on the charges being corrected.",0.996,0.788,0.162,0.05,0.5658413687761513
2010-06-25,4.0,"I've been (im)patiently waiting for months for One. SIx One to open! I finally got to get a quick bite there on Tuesday. They have several vegan items on the menu (and the owners and chefs are familiar with what's vegan; the servers are happy to ask) - samosas, hummus, chips & guac, to name a few. However, they made me a special plate of thinly sliced eggplant with black bean and corn salsa and tomato chutney. Delicate sprouts were a finishing touch. The flavours are very complex. I tried to pick apart the cooking methods, herbs, spices and juices they used, but I couldn't! So I just enjoyed the deliciousness. The bread they offered with the meal was warm and soft inside. I ate the whole loaf. The space is huge - both the interior and the patio. The couches around the fireplace look perfect for when it cools down later this year. Local artwork lines the walls. Sadly I could not stay longer or I'd be late for class. I will definitely be back to try more of the dishes. They should get their liquor license soon as well.",0.9483,0.831,0.131,0.038,0.5285460317460319
2010-06-21,4.0,"Overall a solid 4-star experience for this newly opened spot.  Just a few minor issues that can easily be corrected. Place was relatively empty for a Saturday night, but I think this was due to it being the soft opening.  We were told it was BYOB when we made reservations, but I'm assuming this will change once their liquor license is obtained. Samosa appetizers were exceptional and the tomato chutney served with them was excellent.  Sashimi was good, but not the absolute freshest I've had.  About what I would expect from a non-sushi restaurant.  We ordered 3 different ""quads""/entrees and one salad/soup combo.  The India selection was delicious.  I'm not an expert on indian cuisine, but the tandoori lamb was delicious.  Some of the previously mentioned tomato chutney was part of the dish, as well as eggplant, potato and mango.  Loved the mango since it was able to cut through the rich flavors of the tandoori.  French quad was delicious, although I was only tasting off my husbands plate.  The short ribs were extremely tender and seasoned perfectly.  The American quad was a standard crabcake and fried crawfish.  The spicy remoulade was a nice addition for dipping.  One of our problems came when a pea and mint salad was brought out with a garnish of shredded meat that was not mentioned on the menu.  This was resolved very quickly, but if this is a part of the dish it needs to be mentioned on the menu.  The gazpacho was refreshing, seasoned well and had very developed flavors.    For dessert we had churros with spicy chocolate soup for dipping and an order of bread pudding. The chocolate soup is scrumptious to say the least.  When you first try it you only taste the chocolate, but about 5 seconds later the heat kicks in!  So good. If the churros were made longer (currently about 2 bites each) they would be much easier to dip in the choco soup.  Bread pudding was devoured by all.  Overall it was a great experience for a newly opened restaurant.  There were minimal service issues and everyone seemed comfortable and experienced.  Ambiance is nice with the fireplace inside, the outdoor space could use some sprucing up (flowers, lights, umbrellas, etc.) considering the grassy lot it's sitting next to.  Otherwise a great experience for a new restaurant.",0.9979,0.789,0.194,0.017,0.5458229352346998
2010-06-17,4.0,"I'd actually say this spot is somewhere between three and four stars, but slightly closer to four.   This spot and its next door neighbor ""The Bar Ten Doors"" (lol, get it?) are owned by the same three guys, young, nice guys who have waved in passers-by for a chat all through the construction process of this new and promising restaurant.   The name of the Cafe half, which is an allusion to a mathmetical concept, was just geeky enough to get me excited.  Inside, the place feels cool, relaxing and modern.  The music is a bit new-agey but not quite Enya.  The service was prompt and friendly, and before we left we'd shaken each of the three owners' hands. The food is that new deconstructed kind of food, and features flavors from around the globe.  Even without a very expansive menu, it should suit a variety of tastes.  I got the U.S. gumbo soup and the French beet and apple salad, while my sister went Italian with fried risotto, arugula salad and white bean soup.  The flavors were all pretty fresh and pleasing overall.  My gumbo was a bit potent - not a smoky, lingering spice but a bit overpowering.  But following it up with the beet and apple salad was an excellent choice, as that was very refreshing and crisp.  As can be expected at one of these deconstructionist spots, not everything looks as you'd expect it to look, but in my opinion that makes it a bit exciting.  The servings are a bit smaller - actually the perfect size for someone of my petite stature and for anyone interested in sticking to actual recommended serving sizes - and the prices are bit on the higher end, but with fresh, thoughtfully arranged food one expects it. The creme de la creme for us though, was the desert - a thick cup of chocolatey mousse (pot de creme, as it were).  Thick, rich, smooth, very delicious.  It was good for two, would probably be a bit much for one to go at alone. Overall, I think this is a promising spot.  I hope its location out of the lesser half (that being the North side) of the city does not cause people to shy away.  You should definitely try it out.",0.9979,0.78,0.2,0.02,0.43612514029180705
