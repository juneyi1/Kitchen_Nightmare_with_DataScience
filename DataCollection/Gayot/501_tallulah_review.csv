The four tops in the middle of the room remained empty so sound level was fine. I had sweetbread in a terrific sauce,  pumpkin risotto and we split a cheese plate.  We were asked often my our polite and knowledgeable server about how things were going and twice by the front of the house manager.  This seemed standard practice around the room. We both loved our meals, the service and the atmosphere.  This place is not a funky neighborhood joint, and it is not a silly overly serious restaurant.  It is a wonderful balance and is the star of the many restaurants in Lincoln Square.  What a pleasure to have this spot in a nieghborhood of eclectic enterprises.  And it is perfect place to go before a show at Old Town School of Folk Music.  In NY an evening like this would cost (dinner for two and show) $350-$400.  We had an evening on equal footing for $160 (dinner with four glasses of wine and Alan Tousant at Old Town.  You can't beat it.  This is what big city life is supposed to be like.",0.9841,0.837,0.144,0.02,0.49801587301587297

2009-08-29,4.0,"I came here with my parents and my husband for my birthday dinner last night.  We were early for our reservation but since the place was pretty empty, we got our choice of table.  We sat at a four top right by the window.  My mom and I love to people watch. I had looked on Tallulah's website the days leading up to my birthday dinner to get an idea what to order.  It's my thing to study the menu before I go.  Well, when I looked at the menu that was presented, there were changes.  And not good ones!  I wanted to order the pork belly with kimchee appetizer and it was no longer on the menu.  I was so upset.  And then the server told us that the grilled rainbow trout was being replaced with a pan fried Lake Superior Whitefish.  Same presentation but I was going to order that!  It just seemed that whatever I wanted was either not available or altered.  Update the menu on the website so then others won't be misled.  So, already in my mind, I was kind of against the restaurant. For appetizers, we ordered the spicy lobster deviled eggs, corn chowder and two lobster bisque.  The deviled eggs were more like hard boiled eggs with the lobster placed on top of each half.  Very tasty but a little on the salty side.  They did have a nice green mix on the plate as well.  The corn chowder was delicious.  I didn't try the lobster bisque because it had cilantro.  I can't stand that. For entrees, we ordered the wahoo (tropical fish), skatewing, pork loin and the whitefish.  The whitefish was divine.  It was served with fresh tomatoes and tempura green beans.  It also had a spicy aioli sauce on the plate.  I asked the server for the name of the spice.  I forgot what it was called but it is from the Mediterranean.  Wow.  That aioli was so good I could have just eaten that.  It was a nice companion for the whitefish.  I didn't try the other entrees but all the plates were clean by the end of the meal.  I'm taking that as a good sign. For dessert we got creme brulee and a peanut butter cake with honey mousse.  Now we got two to share.  My husband told me he wasn't going to eat any dessert but once he tried the peanut butter cake, he kept eating it.  A true testament to the cake.  It was delicious and rich.  I think we left a couple bites left on the plate. The space is awesome.  Nice clean lines with minimal decor.  The front part of the room was light and the back from what I could see was darker.  A nice contrast. There is also an enclosed patio but since it was cool outside, we didn't see it. Overall, a great meal.  We all enjoyed ourselves and the service was exceptional.  I know they have a brunch menu and will be going back for that.  This is such a nice place for a small group or an intimate date.  You won't be disappointed with Tallulah.",0.9982,0.766,0.187,0.047,0.5681266846361186

My wife had a pint of whip cream with a little bit of a chocolate peanut butter thing.  Overall, not going back.  We spent way too much money for a meal we could have made 10 times better if we would have cooked it at home.

However, the flavor overwhelmed the lobster...so the lobster was a bit superfluous. Woodland Mushroom, Prune, & Blue Cheese Tart: Amazing. Nice pastry, good mix of flavor. Bulgogi-Style Pork Belly House made Kimchee: I don't like pork belly, so I didn't try. But, everyone said it was mouthwatering. Buffalo Tartare: One of my two favs. Sooo good! Steamed. Mussels: Fav. The sauce with this was so good, we asked for extra bread to dip it. There was some left still, and some of us were tempted to drink it. Oh, yeah the mussels were fresh and perfectly cooked. Not a closed one in the bowl! Lemon Parmesan Gnocchi Crisp Escargot: This was also really good, although I didn't really think the escargot was the best compliment for the gnocchi. I ate them separately, and both were excellent...but wasn't the best pairing. Also, we split three desserts: Chocolate Peanut Butter Pots de Créme: Uhh...I get chills thinking about it. Amazing. Light yet rich and indulgent. Ancho Chili and Chocolate Mousse: This too was amazing. Once again, the banana with it wasn't the best pairing. Points for creativity...but it didn't work for me. The mousse stands alone! Cranberry-Apple Crumble: Good. Seemed average next to the other two, but fruit was fresh, and it tasted really good. Overall, I really liked it!

Our server asked if medium rare was alright and I said it was, but it came out medium well. You could barely see any pink. Sigh.

Our hostess/waitress was friendly and said they could change the appetizer gnocchi on their menu to not include pancetta or escargot, and I'm so glad I ordered it because it was deliciously good. Never mind the fact that I was nearly stuffed after ordering the asparagus soup to start...another great choice.  My husband ordered the bulgogi pork belly and their rib special that night. I don't think I've ever seen him so happy. It was especially ironic that he hesitated to order the ribs because he said sometimes restaurants don't give you enough. Hahaha...he could only finish half of them!  And since we couldn't agree on dessert we each ordered one. He ordered the creme brulee while I had the chocolate mousse.

So tonight, we decided to eat our feelings. And all I have to say is ""HolyshitWOW.""  We looked at the menu before we left the house and were more or less drooling on our own floor. There was a short wait upon our arrival (around 8ish on a Saturday night), so we sat at the bar (which is lit from underneath the actual top of the bar, a cool effect) and drank some lovely prosecco until our table was ready. We were seated at a table that seemed...oddly placed. It was more or less right on top of two other tables, and if we were to swing an elbow, there would've been a solid chance of hitting someone in the face. On the plus side, we could see what everyone else was eating. On the minus side, we were literally RIGHT ON TOP of the people on either side of us. Awkward. After a few minutes, our server arrived and ran through some menu additions, which totally screwed up our idea of what we wanted. We had decided on the Lobster Deviled Eggs, but then our server mentioned something with Softshell Crab (and yes, all foods will be capitalized because they deserve that respect) and our eyeballs lit up. So we went with the Crab. And our amazing server, bless his heart, brought us the Softshell Crab AND the Lobster Deviled Eggs - because he knew we really wanted both. And Both. Were. Spectacular. The Crab came with an amazing glaze, some mixed greens, and a spring roll that involved mint. And the eggs were just as rich as you'd imagine, and creamier than any deviled egg I've ever had. My roommate ordered some fish called a Wahoo, that I had never heard of previously. But it came with this great ginger dressing that went with the purple sticky rice and the jalapenos and other vegetables for a spiciness that was flavorful, and not overwhelming. I went with the Scallops and sweet merciful crap I have NEVER had such tender scallops in my life. They were served in a skillet with brie cheese, broccoli and cauliflower florets. And it was so amazing and flavorful and tender that I might have cried a few times. It was PERFECT. And then the dessert. We could not choose a dessert to save our lives. So we told our amazing server to surprise us with two. He brought out a White Chocolate & Raspberry Creme Brulee, and this Peanut Butter & Chocolate Pot de creme. And both were rich and creamy and AMAZING. We probably didn't need to order two, but they were both so good that we were glad we did. And when we got the bill?

2009-05-10,4.0,"100th Review!!! Very good American/Contemporary restaurant in Lincoln Square.  I love the ""outdoor patio""  -- it is glass enclosed, so on a cool night it is a perfect alternative to actually sitting outside - and considering the shortness of Chicago's patio season, I think they are very smart to enclose it. The food was very good, but there wasn't a particular dish that I wanted to eat again and again, which is my new requirement for a five star review. :)  I thought the apps missed the mark a bit - we tried the soft shell crab and the buffalo tartar.  The horseradish maple aioli (which tasted like spicy mustard) overshadowed any taste the buffalo may have had.  The soft shell crab was good, but nothing you couldn't get at any Japanese restaurant. The entrees are really where Tallulah succeeds.  They are inventive and fun and out of the ordinary.  I had the duck breast with strawberry and rhubarb, which was a lovely combination and quite delicious.  My fiance had the ""east meets west"" steak frites, which were really unusual and delicious.  The asian sauce on the frites had a real kick!  Our dining companions each had fish dishes that were also tasty. For desserts we tried the chocolate peanut butter pot de creme, which was heavenly, but so so rich.  I could only have a couple of bites before surrendering my spoon.  It came with a scrumptious peanut brittle.  We also tried the blueberry bread pudding with key lime sorbet, which was a fun combination. Wine list is great, we had an Austrian Gruener Weltliner for $31 that was very tasty.  There are many bottles in the $30-$40 range, and some spendier ones if you're looking to splurge. All in all, Tallulah made for a lovely evening dining out with friends.  I'd say skip the apps and head straight for the entrees and desserts.  Enjoy the ambiance on the ""patio"" while the weather is nice!",0.9985,0.738,0.255,0.007,0.5698268398268398

As soon as we got there, the hostess informed us that she had, in fact, saved us a table out back. We walked through the restaurant, which was charming and understated (in a good way), to the outdoor patio. It was a really neat set up! We weren't outside technically, but the glass walls and beautiful curtains made it feel like we were in a really cool, warmer version of outside. We all loved it. We split a bottle of white, which was the perfect accompaniment to all of our dishes. For appetizers, we tried the steak tartar and the soft shell crab (a special!). WOW. The crab was excellent. I really enjoyed the steak tartar as well.  For my entree, I had the Rainbow Trout.  Delicious. I was intrigued by the artichokes (one of my favorite things in the world), and to have some hearts fried in with the fish and capers was fantastic. My friends had the steak frites, the wahoo, and the duck. We all tried each others' dishes, and everyone was happy. The steak and duck were both cooked to perfection. FInally, we ended with the bread pudding and chocolate peanut butter pots. Amazing. The perfect way to finish this fabulous meal.

The drink list was very good, although the drinks had really dumb names. (Pearfect Martini, Tallulatini? Come on...)  Reasonably priced wines by the glass. We shared the mussels and the grilled asparagus salad as an appetizer.  Both were very good.  The mussels had a coconut milk-lemongrass broth that was really tasty.  The grilled asparagus ""salad"" came with melted fontina cheese, a poached egg and a yummy vinagrette with pieces of ham.   I had the risotto with morels, spring peas and grana padana cheese.  It was excellent (but what with morels is bad?).  I also tried my friend's wahoo with spicy lemongrass sauce, which was also very good and VERY spicy.  The flavors were the complete opposite end of the spectrum from my entree, so it was a little off-putting going back to my own food.  I did not try my other friend's mahi-mahi special, but she said it was lacking in flavor.  We were too full for dessert, although the menu looked interesting. My only complaint was the service.  The food was nicely paced, but credit the food runners with that.  Our waiter didn't come back very often, and when he did, he failed to notice the empty drink glasses.  I hate when servers are squirrely or lack confidence and don't look you in the eye when they speak to you.  It's just uncomfortable.   I wish Yelp would let you give different ratings for the food and service.  I would have given the food 4 stars and the service 3.",0.8957,0.797,0.127,0.076,0.5551031746031748
2009-05-02,4.0,"Holy seduction, Lincoln Square!  How am I just learning about all the lovely ""date night"" spots you have hidden among your faux-German beer halls?  Tallulah seemed like the perfect place to begin my amorous-culinary journey. I started with a salad - spinach with pears, two of my favorite foods (especially together).  Upon reading the description of this salad on the menu, the only thing I was less-than-excited about were the beets.  Bleh - who likes beets!?  Well, I do, apparently - especially when they are golden beets sliced paper-thin and salted.  Outstanding. Entree - Skatewing with sauteed strawberries and fava beans.  I know what you are thinking - ""FISH with STRAWBERRIES?  Ew!"".  I thought the same thing.  I was wrong....  Ipso facto, so are you (sorry). For dessert my date and I split the bread pudding (and good thing as it was large and we were quite sated at this point).   My food thus far had been an exploration of flavors I wouldn't expect to encounter simultaneously, and dessert was no exception.  The bread pudding was served with key lime sorbet.  Fabulous independently - divine together. Overall, one of my top dining experiences.  The only slight negative was the speed of service.  We ordered salads and POOF!  There they were.  Salads finished, POOF!  Here come the entrees.  I could have used more time to reflect and absorb.  Date and I got there at 7 and were paid up and ready to leave at 8:30.",0.9856,0.817,0.155,0.028,0.6681428571428571

The menu options are very eclectic with lots of different types of meats (Oxtail, buffalo, skatewing) and seasonal vegetables.  Oh and their fresh bread and seasoned butter also scored big points.

The menu certainly focuses on creative, interesting fare (east meets west, etc), generally sprinkled with interesting and/or gourmet ingredients (fois gras, confit, etc). Service was solid.  So everything was just fine, but I confess I left feeling like my experience didn't live up to my hopes. First, yes, the menu wows with creativity and haute cuisine. This sets the bar pretty high, and In all honesty, for me the food didn't live up to the expectations. Again, everything was good, but not great. Some unusual combinations ""missed.""

Small space, tiny semi open kitchen, well designed with nice table settings (collins glasses for water, yes!).  Bartender and one waitress seemed to be handling all of the tables in the 30ish seat dining room. We started with the lobster devilled eggs, which where nice although I was sad to see so much tobiko caviar scattered around the plate (don't waste delicious as a garnish), and the buffalo tartare which was both simple and very, very, very delicious.  Followed with a golden beet and spinach salad which the kitchen very nicely split up for us, high quality ingredients were thankfully not overshadowed by a light dressing. Entrees were the least stellar course.  I wanted the skate wing but the chef let us know that he had not been able to get skate that day and offered to substitute a sturgeon filet with the same side dishes.  That was really great, since I was torn between sturgeon and skate anyway.  The fish was delicious and well cooked, but the plate seemed like a really random conglomeration of sides.  I love brussel sprouts and was happy to see them on the plate although nothing interesting was done with them.  The best thing on the plate was the braised oxtail, although it mostly tasted like a really delicious pot roast and if I want really delicious pot roast my grandma can make it, why spend $22?  And then there was the curried gnocchi, which was the thing I was most excited about and it really, really let me down.  The gnocchi was extremely bland, and what little flavor it did have was frankly BAD, more like burnt plastic than curry.  It wasn't a terrible plate but it tasted more like good microwave leftovers than haute cuisine. My date had the scallops, which was more successful.  Warm crab salad and bacon, a very nice apply-maply sauce, and three nicely cooked scallops (although I feel that most Chicago restaurants are skimpy with the scallops, because I know you can get wonderful 2-inch boat scallops at a great price from frickin' restaurant depot, why does every place give you three tiny ""jumbo"" scallops at a high price?). Dessert was a nice chocolate mousse, a little ancho chile spice and some caramelized banana, not off the charts but a good finish.  Drinks were good, we had a cactus-cointreau margarita, super strong with great tequila and a glass of French viognier.  The wine list I liked, and although there were only one or two bottles under $40, I liked the combination of a sub-$100 high quality boutique wine list with a well chosen ""reserve"" list for true wine snobs.",0.9987,0.698,0.241,0.061,0.6512530062530061

One table was seated inside, a group of middle-aged diners. (I'd like to say they looked bored, but that would be a fabrication to suit the tone of this review. How dishonest.) Outside on the back patio, the scene was a bit more lively, but still not the bustling crowd I expected of a new upscale neighborhood ""hotspot."" We were greeted with a bowl of fresh watermelon, pineapple and cantaloupe -- and a swarm of bees and flies to match -- and nibbled as we perused the menu's many seemingly tempting options. I settled on a simple mushroom omelet, and my brunching companion chose the tofu (bleck) benedict (nergh). To each her own. In the end, my omelet was FAR too salty, even for me (and I love me some NaCl), and her benedict could have benefited, apparently, from some of the salt they spilled on mine. The breakfast potatoes were splendid, and my orange juice was freshly squeezed and perfectly chilled.  Usually, at restaurants where I'm not overwhelmingly impressed with the food, I can walk away with memories of the lovely decor or particularly impressive service. But everything at Tallulah was just...there. The patio was pretty. The dishes were square and white. Our coffees came with sawed-off black plastic straws instead of spoons.

2008-08-18,2.0,"My foodie friend and I ventured outside of our usual habitat (this place was so far out there we felt like we were in the burbs when we got off the el) to try something new.  This place had received lots of positive reviews and the online menu looked delicious as well.  We arrived and the place is very cozy, the interior is darkly lit and quite pretty with a great ambience.  We had a glass of wine at the bar and when our table was ready they offered to transfer the wine to our check...now I never mind settling up at the bar b/c I used to bartend myself, but I love when nicer places will do this.   We were seated in the back 'greenhouse' type seating area, it was a comfortable temperature.  Our server was unattentive and slow, while the food runners/bussers seemed to rush us at the same time.  The food was just mediocre.  Started with the cheese/meat plate to share.  Eh.  Pretty standard.  I then had the heirloom tomato + goat cheese app...now I have never met an heirloom tomato dish I didn't like....but this was pretty bad...couldn't even finish it.  The cheese was just too much, both flavorwise and quantity of it, and it was like you took a tomato slice and dipped the whole thing in a vat of overflavored creamy goat cheese which resembled veggie dip, repeated this a few times, and then slopped it on a plate with a couple leaves of green.   My friend had the scallops....super heavy on the onions.  Too much onion for her, and this girl is an onion lover.  I had a fish dish, it was so boring I didn't even finish it and I can barely remember it.  I do recall that the flavored butter served with the bread was good.  And we did have that chocolate peanut butter desert thing...it tasted like a giant reese's peanut butter cup, and since that just happens to be my favorite candy, it was quite delicious.  Wine list was okay, nothing standout although they had lots of affordable options.  I don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",0.9969,0.8,0.19,0.01,0.5514705882352942
2008-08-18,3.0,"I was in Chicago visiting a college friend, who was meeting up with two of her high school friends.  One of their other friends (still following this irrelevant intro?) is a chef here, so Tallulah was the obvious choice for dinner. It was so unbelievably loud, overwhelming from the moment I stepped foot inside.  Even at our table in the middle, where there are only 4 tables (versus the front or the greenhouse back), I had to strain to hear the person sitting next to me.  Oddly enough, I had no problem hearing the couples at the table next to us talking about swinging (and not at the playground).  The tables were way too close together and the clunky plush chairs were much too large for the space.  For me, atmosphere is a huge part of the fine dining experience, and the set up is not so conducive to quiet conversation. As a vegan visiting from Boston, I'm used to a city that is more veg-friendly as a whole (in very humble my experience), but this wasn't the first time I encountered a menu without any listed veg options.  Nonetheless, it's clear their kitchen has a plethora of all sorts of vegetables, fruits, and other plant-based foods.  I think they actually had an appetizer and salad that were vegan on the menu, but I  chose to let the kitchen whip up whatever they wanted - an option that usually results in something spectacular at high-end restaurants.  The best they could do with all of that is steam a meager bowl of broccoli, bok choy, and summer squash in a margarine-esque (I'm guessing) sauce?  It was good for what it was, but ugh.  Eating vegan is easily so much better.  While I very much appreciate they accommodated me, they failed to showcase the (or really demonstrate any) creativity and skill I know they have. So overall my food was disappointing, mostly because I know they could do so much better, and the ambiance was distracting almost to the point of irritating me.  The three others I was with (including one with a gluten allergy - easily accommodated, btw) really loved their meals, though I'm blanking on what they ordered, and I thought they looked pretty appetizing myself.  Clearly they do their fishies and animals well, but I wish the chefs had taken the opportunity to strut their stuff.",0.9927,0.789,0.156,0.055,0.4821645021645022

I started with the lobster deviled egg appetizer and it was delicious.  Add lobster to anything, and I'm a big fan!  I then went on to the creamed corn soup with avocado and a crispy watercrest and onion salad.  I could have licked the bowel, it was so good!  One of my dining-mates had the lobster bisque, which was a bit too smokey for our tastes (but not enough to remove a star).  Another dining-mate tried the heirloom tomatoes with goat cheese and they were heavenly - possbily the highlight of the appetizer course.   For my entree I had the Jumbo Prawn with a yummy jumbalaya-esque mixture underneath goat cheese grits.  The prawns were perfectly grilled, and the plate all went very well together.  Other yummy entrees included a morel mushroom risotto (scrumptious!) and the lamb dish (I can't remember the name, but it was mostly great.  The only ""meh"" part were the raviolis that were filled with a meat-mixture that reminded me of dog food - sorry!).  I'd like to go back and try the wild boar ribs!   For dessert, we all tried different things and got to sample the peanut butter pot-de-crème (heavenly rich), the pistachio and tart cherry cheesecake (the best cheesecake I've ever had!), the chai crème brulee (you could really taste the chai), and the adobo chocolate dessert (first chocolate, then spicy, how can you not love this?!)   The only drawback I saw was that the space was very loud, so it was tough to hear those across the table.  Overall, however, I think it's a knockout and I plan on going back!!!",0.9852,0.854,0.123,0.022,0.6051470588235294

It was practically raining on us in there.  We had mussels and the bulgogi style pork belly for starters. The mussels weren't bad but the sauce they were in was kind of tasteless. The bulgogi style pork belly was pretty awesome though. I loved the kimchi with it as well.  I had the steak frites as my entree. The steak was not cooked as ordered. It was still good but way too raw. The frites would have been fine but they had this gross garlic sauce on them.  And our service was terrible. We barely saw our waiter.

2008-07-17,4.0,"Thank God tonight is the last night of the Yelp Eats Restaurant week...Holy mother of good food, I'm getting spoiled.  No, seriously...when the spicy lobster deviled eggs arrived (which, I would generally salivate at the sight of) I was just like ""hmmm."" I blame this on my rather absurd number of dinner experiences this week.  However, those little pods of perfection sprinkled with lobster proceeded to bowl me over. I am very partial to eggs in any shape, way or form...but this was just above and beyond expectation. Mmmmm. So good. A perfect start to the meal.  The baby spinach salad was plentiful. Not just a little pile of leaves, but a heaping amount of vegetable. I like that. Skimping on greens is not acceptable, and Tallulah came through with the appropriate amount of ruffage. Well done, though I could do without the yellow beets, despite their contribution to the aesthetics of the plate.  Fish: Not memorable, and a bit chewy...but I really enjoyed the mango salsa. I generally do not order fish at restaurants, and since it was the only choice...obviously, I tried it. Perhaps I'm just not a ""fish"" person. However, I would recommend it to others that enjoy non-legged friends for dinner.  Dessert: Now, this is the homerun. Holy mother of peanut butter! The Peanut Butter Pot de Creme was not only adequately portioned for about 3-4 people, but piled with whip cream and garnished with peanut brittle and chocolate straws. Absolutely FANTASTIC. I know, I know...I'm partial to peanut butter anything (even out of the jar), but this was outstanding. We also tried the banana chocolate mousse (very good) and the Chai Creme Brulee (mmm, if you like chai, get it!).  Overall, the ambience lacks a bit...though perhaps that is the goal. Overly simplistic in design, very conservative. Perfect for a first date if you don't know the person and their tastes, or perhaps to take the parents (or grandparents) out for a very nice meal in a quiet, quaint dining room.

2008-07-17,5.0,"I love Tallulah Bankhead, and I think the Lincoln square is pretty cute, so this restaurant caught my attention.  When I checked the menu, I saw the duck confit spring roll and thought I'd give it a try - though call me crazy but most duck confit in America basically sucks.  I'm also not a Eurosnob about it - all the rest of the best is in America, whither confit proper? A lot of reviews emphasize perhaps incomplete or rough-edged flavor profiles.  They might be on to something - or the flavor is as intended by the chefs.  Or perhaps that was criticism on my mind by way of my internet research beforehand... So here's the deal.  The wine list is not...exhaustive, but well selected with many southern French reds and Spanish garnachas and the like, solid, earthy wines, very pleasing.  My comrades and I took: buffalo tartar: solid; pork belly: ridiculously awesome; crab cakes: surprisingly crabby in a good way; east-west & steak frites: good; scallops: nicely creamy sauce; and duck breast & confit spring roll.  The duck breast was very tender, prepared exactly.  The confit roll I didn't quite get, and will hopefully be transformed one day into a super-awesome duck confit, straight-up.  The much lauded peanut brittle & chocolate pot de creme did the trick.   The space is very clean, its design pretty complex for such an overall light appearance.  Comfortable chairs, absolutely, and the outdoor patio was popular.  As the hour turned from 7 to 8 to 9 or so, a great many younger folks, freshly out of bed, turned up at the bar.  Earlier there were many traditionally dressed, fine looking older folks.  Clean toilet.  In conclusion, Tallulah was everything I wanted from it, and I am inclined to show up again when they change the menu around.  Longlive Bankhead.  End communication...",0.9971,0.729,0.234,0.038,0.4951937984496123

We did come here for the ""Yelp Eats"" dinner, but the items that were featured were not the highlights on the menu. I hate it when restaurants do specials, and only offers the worst dishes - that's pretty bad marketing in my opinion. Anyway, for apps, we got the kona kampachi (which had sriracha, seaweed salad, jalapeno atop a piece of watermelon), and the mussels (came with pineapple. Both apps were surprisingly really good!  The entrees on the other hand were a little bit hit or miss . The steak frites were really good, but the fries were cold.

The combo of flavors in this dish was unique, delicious, and complemented the dish extremely well.  It came with fava beans, strawberries, pancetta (YUMM!!) and balsamic reduction. So good.

I met her for our 6:30pm as she was getting a chardonnay poured for her, we immediately enjoyed the soft lighting atmosphere and our similar looks conveyed our thoughts, ""This is a really cute space!"" Since it had been warm and beautiful day, we said we wanted to sit outside, bad move, the back out door area is great, but better if the air is warm. It is shaded and was quite cool for our dinner, but we trudged on.  As she enjoyed her wine I got a glass of prosecco, (the devil's drink... or so I've heard), and talked about starters. We talked about the soup, she the lobster bisque, I the potato garlic soup. The bisque was a disappointment, the vanilla bean flan in the middle was cold and the soup was lukewarm and with the weather being cool, didn't help. However I enjoyed my lovely potato soup and the brie crustini. Julie went with the seared scallops and I went with the seared duck breast. The scallops were perfectly cooked, medium rare and tasty and came with a sweet pea risotto which was also well executed. My duck was also a lovely medium rare and simple but tasty. It came with a goat cheese and duck confit spring roll which was truly amazing, mustard greens and a kumquat chutney. The chutney was great, then all of a sudden had this subtle heat to it which tickled the back of our throats, which helped to cut the intense flavor of the kumquats. We enjoyed our meals up until this point... then dessert. Share one or share two? There are two chocolate desserts and a blueberry apple crumble we were discussing... what did we get?

I don't know if that is what we got, but this is what we got...  a wonderful delicate chocolate mousse with a banana flavor, slices of roasted bananas with a crunchy sugar top and a intense banana flavored foam. Oh and did I mention that foam once you had a few licks had some serious heat? Not that I minded, but it took me off guard.  The service was good.

It was very grisly. They were nice and comped the entree plus drinks.  The other entrees were tasty but cold.  I think they are understaffed.  The waitress did not come by once to refill coffee or water glasses and neither did the busboys.  I think this could be a great restaurant but they just need to get their act together.  They have a great location near a public parking lot.  They have a creative menu.  They have a beautiful space.  They have the potential to be 5 stars.",0.9829,0.811,0.164,0.026,0.6961111111111111
2008-05-21,4.0,"All in all, a rewarding dining experience. Nothing I ordered was disappointing. If you consider yourself a master of the at-home Artisan bread-cheese-meats platter combo, as I do, then I would avoid theirs. It leaves a little to be desired. Though the Spicy Maine Lobster Deviled Eggs are not exactly ""spicy"" per say, the combination of ingredients are lovely, and the portion size more than appropriate for a starter course. Definitely one of the highlights of the meal. The buffalo tartar is delicious, though I doubt I'd revisit it. The entrées showcase this restaurant's strengths. The Alaskan Halibut is simple and flavorful, though slightly under-seasoned. The Seared Duck Breast is by far the most fulfilling item I tried, in both texture and taste. Recommended enthusiastically. Dessert, Ancho Chile Chocolate Mousse, is a surprisingly sophisticated conclusion to the menu, artfully-presented and decadent, without inducing a sugar coma. A simple twist on the banana sunday; nothing too ingenious, but really well executed. I don't know if they have an independent pastry chef, but whomever handles the desserts is more than capable.  Aesthetically, the restaurant is charming and clean. The location couldn't be better. Cost is spot-on: an ideal weeknight destination for folks in search of something tasty, but not overworked. If the service were a bit more personal, energetic, and engaging, my rating would undoubtedly be higher -- nothing was problematic, but nothing was passionate, either. I can totally see this restaurant evolving with some time, and my opinion evolving with it. I look forward to my next visit!

2008-05-12,2.0,"We went to Talluah with high hopes and somewhat nostalgic for the restaurant that was in that space previously (She-She).  There were 4 of us at this outing and the results were split right down the middle. On the plus side: (1) The pepper crusted steak and a huge pile of fries were to die for, $26  (2) The duck, with duck confit egg roll was quite good as well. On the down side: (3)  The scallops with risotto dish was a joke. A cup of rice, very al dente, is not what I call risotto.  And 3 (THREE) medium scallops made for an appetizer portion at best. But, at $23 it sure wasn't supposed to be an appetizer.  It conjured thoughts of a sit-com that pokes fun at ""high-class"" dinning. (4) Artichoke Napoleon... you might imagine a savory mixture and layers of phyllo/filo... but you would be imagining wrong.  It was a vertical cross sectional (3/4 inch) slice of a whole artichoke that was fried and placed between what seemed like two stiff, triangular pita chips. There wasn't much to the leaves and what was left was less than one full artichoke heart!  What are you supposed to do with that? Two good entrees and two losers average out to 3 stars.  If you order right you might get a 4 star experience.  Order wrong and you will be  disappointed.  Cocktails were a whopping $10 each. Update: My dinner guests that night thought that this review was accurate but that the score was overly generous. So, taking a quantitative approach I'll give the entrees the following steak=4, duck=3, scallops=1, artichoke napoleon=0. A total score of 8 leads to an average of 2 stars.

Yes, ""YUMMY"" describes Tallulah. I was overjoyed.   I started off with the much raved about lobster deviled eggs. They deserve the hype. They were fun, unexpected and just plain delicious. I tried some of the pork belly as well and was amazed. If you don't order the pork belly, make sure somebody at your table does. My main course was the short ribs and bacon-brie mashed potatoes. It was superb. I don't think I made a sound beyond ""yummmm"" and ""mmmmm"" for at least 20 minutes. It was sweet and savory and smoky and salty and everything all in one. This was not just ""meat and potatoes""; my taste buds were dancing with all the flavor. I was beyond full and only had a few bites of the blueberry crumble dessert with blueberry ice cream. It was good but I was honestly too full to enjoy it completely so I cannot say it was great.  I was able to finish two glasses of the Tallulah Tini and even though my liver would protest, I would have loved to have a third. I hate saying ""Tallulah Tini"" since it sounds like a name for a chihuahua or something but man do I like drinking them! The bourbon soaked cherries are a wonderful touch.  Service was attentive and nice. Our server was very friendly and gave us great suggestions. She was always around but never hovering. It was a very enjoyable meal. The space is classic with modern twists. I like the moulding with the mirrors. It is another unexpected twist  that works. A common theme at Tallulah - ""Unexpected Classic"" I do agree that the tables are incredibly close (lose 1/2 star for that). I felt bad when I had to get up because not only did our table have to adjust for my movements, but so did the people next to me. It can be disruptive.

2008-03-29,3.0,"Open for about a month- Tallulah is the newest addition to Lincoln Square.  Located in the old She-She space, the restaurant appears to still be working out some of its bugs given the experience that we had there last night. The space has been totally redone with walnut wood, brown leather chairs, white walls and banquettes and an alabaster topped bar that is under lit to make it look like it is glowing in the small space. All very lovely.   As for that small space- it would be better if there were a little more ""breathing room"" between the tables.  While we came alone- it felt like we were there with the couple sitting next to us as there was only an inch between the tables and we were practically in their conversation all night. As always when we visit a new restaurant- we ordered a wide range of foods and there were some winners and losers in the bunch.  For appetizers, we had the spicy lobster deviled eggs (excellent, cool and creamy) the buffalo tartare(the best thing we had all night) and the crab and Andoille fritters (doughy and not very tasty although salvageable if you eat the greens and dressing that come with them to spice them up) For our entrees, we ordered the peppercorn crusted steak served with fries drizzled with aioli sauce.  The steak was not hot and if there were peppercorns on it- they escaped me, but the fries were great.  My friend had the braised short ribs and while his was hot- it had really no flavor.  His came with bacon brie mashed potatoes and some root vegetables that were undercooked and crunchy. The wine list- while not extensive- does offer up several varieties by the glass.  By the bottle there is not a choice over $75 which makes for a reasonably priced dinner.  Our server actually suggested a wine that was less expensive than the ones we were looking at and while good- it wasn't as full bodied as I would have liked. The little things that kept this from getting a higher rating are the things that make an ""OK"" restaurant a place I'd recommend to friends.  There seemed to be cleanliness issues with the glassware.  The first wine glasses were fingerprinted and had water spots on them.  These were then replaced with new glassware that had lipstick on them.  Food is a detail business and someone missed the details.  Had either the bartender or the server looked before they plopped them on our table it would have made for a better experience. The other thing was that the pacing of the service was off.  While the place was busy- it wasn't packed so I expected to get my first drink to enjoy while perusing the menu.  That didn't happen.  Even when the one of the owners was standing 2 feet away from us talking up the couple that was ""with us"" (that's a joke, see above) we still waited to get our drink.  Once the wine was ordered there was another pause.  On the other hand- I thought the food delivery was paced out well. All in all- I don't think I would search out Tallulah as it is pretty far north from my regular beaten path and there are many restaurants between here and there that pull it together better.  But if I find myself up that way in the future- I'd love to go back for more of those deviled eggs and buffalo tartare.  Hmm . . .can a girl live on raw meat and eggs alone?  I say yes!",0.9956,0.852,0.116,0.031,0.4522566513945824

The whole place has a modern, comfortable elegance about it.  We had a solid Prosecco to start at the bar. We started with the crab and andouille fritters which were fairly solid and tasted surprisingly like a gourmet corn dog, if you can imagine such a thing. I thought this was an innovative way to go with that dish and it was clear from the mustard served with the fritters that this was exactly what they were going for with it.  We had the skatewing and the duck breast as entrees. The skatewing was pretty excellent but the oxtail it was paired with was the highlight of that dish. It was tender and braised to perfection. The duck breast itself was good and it had a nice crunch on the exterior but it wasn't earth shattering. The duck confit spring roll it was served with was good but had an interior that I would call a little too moussey for my taste.  The Chocolate Peanut Butter Pots de Creme for dessert truly was a literal Pot of Cream as the whipped cream on top of the dish was probably 4 inches deep. Once you hit the chocolate/peanut butter mousse at the bottom though, it was completely delish.  Overall, I really liked this place but I'm sort of done with it. For me, it's a lot like chalkboard.

The chicken was prefectly cooked, incredibly juicy (i wondered if it the white meat was cooked sous vide like at DeLaCosta) and with a delicious crisy skin (oddly, the dish had no taste of musrhoom---not that I missed it).
