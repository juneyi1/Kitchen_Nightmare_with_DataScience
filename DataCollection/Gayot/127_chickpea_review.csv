2014-01-22,5.0,"I write this review for the benefit of Chickpea fans who need a new mom and pop middle eastern place. It's called Sultan's. Go 8 blocks directly up Hoyne to North Ave, or go 8 blocks up Damen and take a left on North Ave. Sultan's has been around for more than 10 years, and its success is currently being imitated by several corporate middle eastern knock-offs like Roti and Olive, which have essentially co-opted Sultan's Chipotle-ish middle eastern fast casual model.  Like Chickpea was, Sultan's continues to be a true family-owned establishment in every sense. There are only two locations, the food is prepared with care, and the prices are very reasonable. They don't, or haven't, wanted to go corporate and their loss in so choosing is our gain as customers. Lastly, they are also BYOB, which makes Sultan's one of the cheapest date spots in city and certainly in Wicker Park / Bucktown and Lincoln Park respectively.",0.9702,0.794,0.17,0.035,0.3185384456813028
2013-12-23,5.0,"I think this place is so wonderful! I've seen a number of negative reviews on here complaining about customer service and portion size. I'd actually give 5 stars in both of those categories--sizable portions and generous complimentary extras of things (bread, saauce, things the cook wanted us to try), and fabulous customer service. The first time I went there, the woman who runs it was having a hard day, but was so gracious and friendly even though she was obviously flustered. This is a flittle family business that has a unique, fun atmosphere and really delicious food for not a lot of money. I wish I lived closer; I'd go there all the time.

Yes, the posters are cool, but the food isn't great, especially considering the price and the actual portions that arrive on your plate.  And the service...that's the real point of my review...  I have eaten here three times, for the convenience reason I listed above. Last night we ordered take out and I ordered off of their menu listed here on Yelp. I ordered two entrees that said they come with rice, for a total of about $20. When I got home I noticed that the containers seemed really spacious for the food. Yes, the meat and ""veggie"" portions were small, but worse yet, there was no rice! I called to ask about that. The guy who answered started talking with me but then abruptly fumbled the phone off to someone else mid (my) sentence.  New guy (the manager?) tried to tell me that those entree plates don't come with rice - that it's an option of either rice or one piece of pita bread...  .........?

2013-12-12,5.0,"this place is amazing. my boyfriend and i live a couple blocks away since we discovered it we've been coming here at least twice a week. The reason we keep returning is for straight up NOURISHMENT. And in Chicago in the winter when you are both working it is quite easy to start to feel malnourished.  I don't mean like when you're starving and want a big hearty burger, i'm talking about food that is fresh and delicious warm, not over salted or seasoned like most restaurant food. Seriously, having Mama down the street is the next best thing to having my own mother around. The food is delicious, the meat is cooked perfectly, and the ingredients are few.  We usually share the trio of delicious and fresh middle eastern salads full of fresh herbs to start, and almost always order the special for dinnerl. Our favorite is the Moussakhan (Sat and sundays). It might be the best chicken i've ever had (how does she get it so crispy without frying it?) dusted with spices, on warm pita with some kind of pine-nut jam. So simple, it's beautiful really. And we usually get some homemade hummus or Bhaba ghanoush to go.   There is unlimited hot tea, and it's byob. Usually we are the only ones in there, and i'm beyond confused as to why that is! If you are looking for a relaxing, revitalizing meal one of these cold nights i suggest you stop in. Seriously, don't get take out, come here and sit down and eat and enjoy these kind people's hospitality. It will warm your belly and your heart.",0.9925,0.73,0.205,0.065,0.5806633885438233
2013-12-04,2.0,"GREAT FOOD, BUT...THEY LOST MY TRUST COMPLETELY! WHAT A SHAME!    Food is important for a restaurant but here's what they are forgeting: a restaurant is not just about the food, it's about the customer service and the entire experience from start to finish.    I used to frequent this place for a couple of years. They have top-notch Middle Eastern fare, and luckily for them they have managed to keep it consistent throughout -- I am guessing the head chef knows what s/he is doing.   But it seems to me that they HAVE NO IDEA ABOUT CUSTOMER SERVICE. There are two people that work there that are absolutely great, one of them is an older gentleman and the other a young lady. The young lady also happens to be a very talented chef. The other guys, however, are unprofessional at best.    The problem here is that you never know what you are going to get, and maybe they are patting themselves in the back for their achievements with the consistency and quality of the food, but they are not putting themselves in the customer's shoe. They need to rethink who they are allowing to work at the front.   One of the male hosts, the tall one, is the coldest looking man I have met in a long time, the only other people who I have met that had even a similar stone-cold look in their eyes were special forces police who were involved in heavy duty action against gruesome criminals. It's not that I want him to fake a smile...I don't know about you but I don't like to hand my money to people that seem to have contempt for me -- I don't even know this person! And this guy, whose only emotion seems to range between mild disgust to contempt, Mr.Terminator-wanna-be, is one of their regular hosts! HOW IS THIS POSSIBLE?      The last time I went to Chickpea the host, whom I had never seen before, smelled like booze. I asked him if I could get a salad instead of the regular side and he said, ""we are in America,"" as in ""of course, you can, it's a free country,"" the problem was that not only did he reek of booze and the way he said it, with such outrage and long pause, and the entire interaction was so bizarre that I just decided to leave. He chased after me to apologize, because maybe in a moment of clarity he realized his behavior was inappropriate, but the bottom line is that I don't trust someone that talks to me like trash and smells like a bar to do anything for me, especially serve me food.     I am giving them two starts because the food has been consistenly good everytime I went there, but what I have seen demonstrates very poor judgement in how they choose staff and I don't trust them making my food. Suporting a restaurant is more than just giving my hard-earned $$ is about TRUST, which the restaurant has to earn.  This is really a shame...they were too good to have gone this low...WHAT A SHAME! I hope they change back to the excellence they used to have. Maybe if I see some reviews about improved customer service I might venture going back in there a year from now.",-0.9672,0.737,0.115,0.148,0.5179918345543346

2013-10-03,4.0,"Excellent authentic flavors and unique home cooked meals are what you can find at this little Palestinian restaurant. I used to live in Israel and I visited Palestine and this food comes really close to the wonderful fare you can find both on the street and in in mothers' kitchens. The home cooked specialties, which are often a type of stew or hearty entree, can be hit or miss (but I always order them anyway). Often the sauce, rice and spices are perfect but the meat is over cooked. On my last visit I ordered a lamb entree called Kalayiet Bandoora. Chunks of lamb are suspended in a velvety tomato sauce punched with cinnamon and other spices. I loved the flavor but many of my lamb chunks were too tough to eat.  For carb conscious diners they have excellent alternative to a chicken shwarma sandwich, Shawirma Dajaj. It includes Chickpea'ss wonderfully seasoned and moist chicken shwarma on a bed of pickles (very authentic), red cabbage salad, crudities and thoom sauce. You honestly don't miss the pita bread in this dish. Thoom is a wonderful gift that Chickpea has brought back from the region. It is actually a mezze (dip) that is made from whipped garlic and oil. The ingredients are simple but the secret is in the execution. This one of the only restaurants in Chicago that has thoom on the menu.  Chickpea has a very laid back feel. The restaurant is cash only. It is essentially counter service and you can seat yourself either inside surrounded by Arabic movie posters or find a spot outside in their secret patio. I always go for the patio. If you get mezzas and apps before your entree, which of course you should, you are looking at around $40 per couple. The hummus is a must and watch out for the green sauce on top, its spicy.",0.9886,0.848,0.125,0.027,0.5816326530612245
2013-09-27,1.0,"This place in is my neighborhood & I have been meaning to go here for quite some time. The husband doesn't ""do"" this kind of food & so I FINALLY decided to go for lunch while my mother-in-law was in the area. Spoiler Alert: I had a really bad idea! I honestly haven't had such a horrible dining experience in quite a long time & it saddens me that it was at a place I really wanted to love.  First of all, when you walk in, the ""Order Here"" near the counter was confusing & we were not sure if we should sit down... or was that message for carry out?  So we go up to the counter awkwardly, because although we are seen by two employees, no one says anything. Are they so sure that everyone that walks through the door has been here before & knows the ""drill?"" We are told Yes, we DO need to order from the counter & sorry, & without even asking about it, they are out of tabbouleh. Strike 1. SIGH - At Chick Pea, during the ordering process, I felt stared at, rushed & sure enough... later I found out he didn't hear me order 2 lentil soups, although I said that quite clearly, & I said it first. Who misses the FIRST item ordered? We were then informed that we could get utensils, plates, napkins, hot sauce, & soda ourselves. Plus, after he already walked away to the kitchen area when we were ""loading up on supplies,"" I had to go near the kitchen & flag someone down to ask for extra plates to be put out because there was only one left. Cool? No. It was a hassle. Strike 2. Since the gruff counter person/waiter didn't hear me, we were waiting for lentil soups that would never arrive. Had he stopped by ONCE to ask if everything was OK, I could have asked. I didn't get to ask about them until we were done with our dips & when I flagged him down, his response was to walk swiftly away without saying a word. He then comes back & almost gleefully shows me the ticket & that I did not order them. He also reminded me that he repeated my order back to me to which I replied, ""I can't read your handwriting upside down & you were talking way too fast."" I can't. He was. I told him that I am not used to dining in places where you order first then sit down & he said, ""Oh, we're fast-casual,"" as if I should know that. I checked out their web site beforehand & it doesn't say that anywhere. Also, they have no prices on-line, & I should have taken that as a bad sign. I think he meant, ""We're a fast-casual rip-off center, with zero warmth from the employees, bad food with measly portions & wham-bam-thank-you-ma'am counter service."" That would be more accurate. Strikes 3-7. At least. So this is what we DID consume: Baba Ghannoj - Meh! Bland. Expensive for what you get. Had to be $7 maybe? I don't remember exactly. Pita chips - I was expecting big, toasty chips & instead they were small, hard & some of which were burnt for $2. Very bland to boot. Hummus & Falafel - What a joke! 3 piddly little lukewarm balls & a smear of the worst hummus I ever had. For $8! Seriously, container hummus is better.  It came  with pita bread & it's a very sad day indeed, when the pita bread is the best thing on the table. Lentil Soup - we canceled this when we noticed that we had already paid $21 for the above & we were STILL very hungry. There was NO WAY I was shelling out $7 more for soup that was probably just as bad. Had everything been awesome & the service equally as good, hell yeah I would have paid! I'm no cheapskate. I don't need TONS of food to be happy, just give me what I pay for. But they had already blew it by then, so instead, we left hungry &... we won't EVER go back!

The first time I went in my friend and I (we are both Arabs, so we are very critical of Arab food at restaurants) ordered hummus, tabbouleh, and kubbeh as appetizers. The hummus and tabbouleh were both pretty decent. The kubbeh was just okay; it's not something I would order again. Absurdly, they served us only one kubbeh. ONE! How is one supposed to feed two people? We basically had just a taste. How silly. For our main meal, my friend ordered Fassoulia, which she said was very good. I ordered a kifta kabab sandwich, and part of it was tasty, the other part was burnt, which was unfortunate. I also got a couple falafel just to try it out and it was good; it definitely wasn't the best I've had, but not bad at all. The service that day wasn't friendly, but not unfriendly either.  The second time I went in I went with the same friend. We ordered the same appetizers minus the kubbeh, and also got the Chickpea Fries. Those Chickpea Fries are AMAZING. They are the best thing this place has to offer. I would go back just for those. For our main dish, my friend was hoping they had Msukhan, but we had gone on a Friday and they only serve it on the weekend. She decided to get Fassoulia again because she thought it was really good the last time we went. I ordered the shawerma plate and again, it wasn't the best I had, but it was decent. The main thing that was different about this experience was that the owners were there, and because we were Arab they treated us extra special. They made sure what we ordered was good, and if we didn't think so they would send it back and have it remade for us. They are very great people, kind and funny, and they are what make the restaurant worth supporting. In typical Palestinian hospitality, they wouldn't let us pay for our tea. The girl who served us our food was also very friendly, too.  The Arabic movie posters are also pretty awesome. I love how they decorate the place.  Chickpea is good if you are in the city, as there aren't very many good options available for dinner (I said good, so Sultan's Market doesn't even count) unless you go way up north to the Albany Park/North Park area where there are some good Lebanese restaurants. Chickpea serves a lot of home-cooked meals that you wouldn't find at most restaurants, but being Arab, I would never order a home-cooked meal in a restaurant. I would rate it 4 stars, but it's just not as good as the food I can get in Bridgeview on 87th street near Harlem.

2011-09-20,1.0,"This place came highly recommended from people I trust as knowing decent all-around quality. I was told they did a nice job with some typical middle-eastern type favorites.  We called-in a pickup/togo order. Three things: Shawirma Sandwich, Falafel Dinner and Kufta Mihshew Dinner. The second I got the bag into the car, I knew something was afoul. As in a fishy foul. Turns out the Falafel must have been cooked in the same oil as some fish, hence, the completely foul odor and taste to them, not to mention how they were literally little fried pucks far overcooked into a crunchy oblivion of fishy oily carelessness. Oh and the packaging for this entree was that these 6 undersized deepfried stones get tossed into a tiny paper sack, and the tahini salad that it comes with is put into a small sauce cup. Underwhelming for $7 to say the least. The Shawirma sandwich was the most unique shawirma I've encountered. The meat was not the typical slices of ground composite (not unlike gyros), but this was more like slices of something so far overcooked it turned to crumbs. We tried to figure out a way to get this gravel sandwich to behave a little more amorously with generous applications of tahini sauce, but alas, failure was the only solution. The flavor of the gravel was quite off into its own direction as well. No meat can retain anything desirable in terms of flavor after being converted to a sandy paste. Again, $7 for a sandwich, which, even if done acceptably would have to be a pretty incredible sandwich, for which I don't see this ever holding it's own as such from this vendor. The Kufta Mihshew - The meat portion of this entree is a ground composite of sorts. Somehow, the meat must have been over worked, because these 2 little logs of ground meat were tough, tougher than a burnt weenie left on the grill overnight. This was $10, and it came with some rice and a few shards of onion and green/red pepper, all inside a small container you'd get for an appetizer from other places. Tiny portion. Of course the baklava was great, they didn't make it there, it is purchased from a proper bakery and resold. Other notes of interest- The cash-only policy is interesting- they have an ATM that they charge you an extra fee to use, how convenient.  I can respect the efforts of trying to fly under the radar or towards off-the-grid with the cash-only thought, but don't screw me for an extra fee at your ATM. Lastly, the website doesn't really work. Maybe it works dandy on the person who created it's computer, but nowhere else, I had to use  menupages.com  to figure out  our order.

2011-06-07,1.0,"Blame it on the sad irony of the human condition that I am more inspired to write a bad restaurant review than a good one.  I eat delicious foods of all kinds here in Chicago and on travels throughout the world; yet the first restaurant review that I have been inspired to write is based on a surreally bad experience I had last night at Chickpea. To be fair, we did not even get a chance to try the food.  They may well serve the best Middle-eastern food in the world, but we never got to that stage.  When we arrived, the matriarchal hostess briefly leered at us askance and then resumed her previous conversation.  We weren't sure what to do, and so approached the register to indicate that we meant business.  The hostess eventually made her way behind the register and again gave us a ""yer not from around these parts"" look.  I had to offer that we were here for takeout and would like to see a menu and order. I was super hungry, and so splurged on the $12 lamb entree, figuring that, as is often the case when I get Middle-eastern food, the portions would be ample, with lots of extra stuff, and we'd have leftovers for lunch for a couple days.   ""Do you want ""spicy rice"" for an extra $2?"" she asked.  Is it pretty good?  ""Yes.""  Sure -- why not then. So then we took a table and sat.  And sat.  And sat.  And then we continued to sit, seated, and sat some more.  No one came to offer us water.  There were no proffers of mint tea refreshment coming our way, despite the tank of the stuff sitting 5 feet away from us. Judging from the number of staff working, 7-8 in total, front and back, one would have thought that we would have received some sort of acknowledgment of appreciation for our business -- a simple ""good evening"" perhaps -- but no such gestures occurred.  The atmosphere was cold and weird. Then our food came, in a large brown paper bag plopped on our table, without so much as a ""thank you,"" a ""have a good evening,"" a nod, a smile or even eye contact.  I looked into the top of the bag to see what I was getting and my world suddenly went into fish-eye mode, to reveal far off in the distance at the very bottom of this bag, one pathetic little foil tray covered by a flat paper lid. I thought that there must be something missing.  The hostess turned around with a bit of a surprised look when I asked if I could have some of the pickled side dishes that usually are served with this type of cuisine.   ""Oh -- you want pickles?""  Yes, please, I said.  Then thought: what else do I need to ask for, other than pickles? Having noticed the bag to be surprisingly light when I first picked it up, I picked it up again and gave it a bit of a shake.  Definitely light.  The hostess again turned around with a sneer even before I could finish saying ""excuse me, I don't mean to be rude, but this seems like a very small amount of food to get for $14.""  She quickly turned away and shuffled off into the kitchen to talk with the ""chef,"" shall we call him. I took the tray out of the bag and removed the lid to see just what I was getting. Atop about a cup of cooked white rice (plain, not $2 spicy) sat maybe a dozen 1 inch diameter kebab pieces with a few specks of onion and pepper adding a small bit of color.  The whole thing weighed about 6 oz, tray included. ""You have a problem?"" the ""chef"" said with furious nostrils flared.  He had stormed out of the kitchen and his long mop of curly hair was hovering broodingly over my head.  Well yes, I said, I have a hard time believing that this is $14 worth of food.  I expected that he would beg off with some sort of apology, and send me off with at least twice the amount of food they had originally presented (as well as the requested pickles). ""So you want your money back?"" I was shocked to hear him say.  And to say it in such an angry and offensive tone that the only thought that came to mind was: H.F.Y. I want my money back!  Yes, that would be fine. ""FINE!"" he countered, and stormed off to the register.  Now, at this point I felt kind of bad.  I am a business owner, and know how hard it is at times.  And I understand that the restaurant business is one of the toughest.  I offered  to him a sympathetic view, perhaps opening a way to more amicably resolve this matter, saying: look, I understand that its hard to run a restaurant, and... ""HARD?"" he shouted at me, now gelling in my head two stereotypes -- the Soup Nazi's stoner cousin.   ""YOU KNOW HOW HARD IT IS?  WHEN LAMB COSTS $7 A POUND?""  Now, my experience at Chickpea officially had become surreal, and all I could do was stay silent as I tried to do the math on the profit margin they were going for by serving me maybe 3 oz of meat, with about 60 cents worth of rice, vegetables, oil, spices and cooking gas. We got our refund and, as we walked out, were admonished never to return by someone who had been lurking near the door, who we had assumed previously was a customer: ""and don't ever come back!""

2011-03-13,2.0,"I'm conflicted on this review....the food itself is fantastic - simply delicious and flavorful.  Food is definitely a 5. However, Chickpea has to work on a few things, namely: - service - service - service We had no idea what to do when we entered...do we seat ourselves, wait at the counter, wait at the door?  We finally sent a scout to scope this out and the manager/owner/server (? not sure), told us where to sit.  We didn't have menus for a while and we had to obtain our own menus so that we could decide what to order.  It took quite a while to order, and then food came rather quickly.  However, we tried to order more hummus and we had to flag someone down to help us.  Also, we either ordered incorrectly, or one of our entrees didn't come, but no one came to check on us at all.  Had someone come over, we would have tried to rectify the situation.  Therefore, I'm going to have to go with a 1 for service. Value is ok - the spot is byo.  Supposedly there is a $1 per person corkage fee.  I didn't inspect the bill, so I'm not sure if this was charged.  However, I'm not sure how I feel about a corkage fee per person when we had to wait a long time for glasses and had to find a corkscrew from the table next to us.   The atmosphere was fine, if a bit eclectic.

Service is counter order and relaxed.  This is certainly not the place to go to if you are in a hurry.  Relax and enjoy the whimsical and artistic, colourful tables and ""Genie"" pineball machine in the back of the restaurant.  If you're lucky Amni {owner and sometimes chef}, AKA Mama will let you play for free!   The fresh kebahs are crunchy and meaty with ground lamb inside a cracked wheat shell with minced onions and pine nuts.  This is served with their homemade yogurt with cucumber and mint.  I also tried the koosa ma laban which is also a yogurt made with zucchini and mint puree.  I recommend asking for harissa {a North African hot sauce made with piri piri peppers primarily} as it's also popular in Palestian cuisine. Sandwich recommendations:  falafel, which sounds boring but this was served as sliced and gently pressed into the pita bread.  This ensured the exterior remained crispy and balanced with the tender cucumbers, grilled tomatoes, onions and tahini.  The kufta sandwich is also excellent with two links of spiced, ground lamb, grilled onions, tomatoes, green peppers and tahini.   And for those esoteric gourmands: Chickpea serves Vimto soda: a currant and grape based drink popular in Palestine.   The décor is delightfully campy with vintage replicas of 1980s American films with Arabic script such as: ""Batman,"" ""Conan the Barbarian,"" and ""Enter the Dragon.""  The stained glass chandeliers are etherial and may make you nostalgique for Paestine.  Alas, there are no hookahs to smoke!   Service is slow, but worth the wait!  They offer take-away service if you're truly in a rush.   And if you're wishing to skip the tempting baklava and perfumed tea go to Black Dog Gelato, just a few blocks north on Damen at 859 N.

From the outside it seems to be a little more upscale...and it is not.  Second, there is just one bathroom and it doesn't seem to work very well - leaking toilet (note: this may not be an ongoing problem). Third, the falafel sandwich was VERY messy. Don't get me wrong, I love a messy sandwich and if it tastes good- the mess doesn't matter. In this case, I was not expecting it and have never had to use a fork for my entire sandwich. It turned me off a little and made me miss Nesh (on Fullerton) or Sultans (on North).

For smaller types (5'5"" lady) like me, however, the chicken sandwich at $6 is just the right amount of food to keep me full for a long while (and they use locally-raised-by-the-Amish chicken that is so moist and flavorful).

2010-07-22,4.0,"I tried Chickpea for the first time last night after hearing about it for months. First of all, if you didn't write down the address, you will never find the place. Signage is small and I nearly got into several accidents on Chicago Ave trying to spot the location. There is abundant street parking however. The size of the restaurant was small. I was there at 9pm, so it wasn't that crowded, but I could see how seating could be a problem. Also, as other reviewers stated, its not really clear whether you should sit down or go up to the cashier to order. Luckily, the cashier directed me. Chickpea has all of the normal Middle Eastern dishes, with several Palestinian/North African specialities that are a little harder to find at other Middle Eastern places. I was very excited to see they had Fool Mudammas on the menu, which I haven't had in years. The lentil soup was calling to me, so I ordered that, but if the fool is as good as I expect it will be I will have to up my rating to 5 stars. I also ordered the falafel sandwich with my soup. The soup was amazing. It was very creamy and the garlic pita croutons were a nice touch. I would even go so far as to say that this lentil soup is better than Sultan's, if just for the croutons and smoother texture. The falafel sandwich was good, but not as good as Sultan's. They put all of the hummus and tahini on the bottom of the pita, which began to fall apart as soon I started to eat it. Also, Chickpea adds large slices of cucumber and tomato, rather than the Jerusalem salad at Sultan's. The tahini does have some mint (or is that dill?) added which is a nice flavor addition. I loved the Arabic movie posters and bright colors in the restaurant.

I ordered a veggie kabob - and the cumin-spiced rice is a must-order (really, it takes lowly rice to new heights). The veggies were pleasantly charred and delicious in a simple, unadorned way. My bf ordered the falafel (I had a hearty bite), and it's every bit as good as you'd expect from a place named for its key ingredient.

The tables are decorated well and the entire restaurant has an informal, hip-but-not-pretentious vibe. But, as another reviewer noted, it's a bit confusing at first as to what you are to do? Are there menus? Do you sit first, or walk to the counter? Why aren't the menus someplace where I can grab them while I'm in line, rather than right at front where I am delaying everyone else behind me as I decide what to order?  This stuff all matters, but it's not as important as the food. I was thrilled to see a three-salad combo on the menu --  fattoush is one of my favorites, and, they did parts of it well. The crispy pita-croutons were delicious. And the salad was super-heavy on parsley, which is great. But, after a while, the bitterness of the dressing just became too much for me and I had to push the dish aside. On to the tabouli. I split open my pita (which the server said was delayed because they were ""toasting"" it -- aka, nuking it in the microwave) and filled it with a delicious-looking tabouli overloaded with scallions. Yum! But, again with the bitterness! Why is this happening to me!? Why can I not be having a lovely mideastern salad combo that doesn't cause me to make a weird face as I eat? Argh! The third salad was a lovely cucumber and tomato dish -- it was perfectly tasty, but by then, I was sort of annoyed by the whole to-do.  Perhaps I shouldn't leave a review on just one order, for just one visit made during an off time of mid-afternoon on a Saturday. But, why shouldn't every client be treated with the same high quality service and food? Alas, this seemed like a fine enough place to go to when hungry and in the neighborhood.

This is some of the best Mediterranean food I've had, mmm.... ever. I got the lentil soup which was kind of a puree with olive oil drizzled on top and garnished with these great pita croutons. We also got hummus that rivals any I've had before and this stuff called fool (there's a second part of the name that I forgot) which is this awesome bean puree. We also got chickpea fries - amazing.

We (called ahead to make sure this time...) were able to get a table for 6 at 8:30PM on a Saturday night with NO problem. There were at least 6+ open tables. A friend and I split our dinners-- I tried one of the specials of the day (a white fish with grape reduction) and he got the lamb kabob,  which were really good but not jaw dropping. The fish was definitely interesting and the lamb was a no frills kabob and a whole lotta rice.  We also shared the grape leaf rolls and hummus, which is really smooth, almost made me wonder if there was a little too much oil in it. (I'd go for the spicy one again but not the plain.) The grape leaf roll things were just that.  I do have to say, it wasn't to my preference of cleanliness... the silverware was just kind of slopped on the table, which was sorta gross. Also the fact that they had a water cooler sorta was reminiscent of gym class and not a saturday night out with my pals. Also the menus seemed like an afterthought.. So if it's fine dining you're going for... don't go. However, the fact that the other family business is Jam clearly shows they have their stuff together, so maybe this non-glamor appearance is part of their gimmick.

2009-11-25,3.0,"Chickpea is a highly vegan- and vegetarian-friendly Palestinian cafe that offers some old standards (hummus, falafel) as well as some unusual dishes. I love that all their dishes are labeled vegan or vegetarian which makes ordering really easy. I came here with a few people and got a chance to sample a variety of dishes. First we had a ""Mama's Lentil Soup"" ($3) which was excellent: hearty, simple and well-seasoned with herbs and acidic lemon. The portion size was also good considering the price. We also had a ""Koosa"" (zucchini, tomato and onion stew) ($7) which was tasty but not terribly cutting-edge or unexpected. This dish could have been from anywhere in the Middle East or Mediterranean. Next we had the Tuesday dinner special, ""Malfoof"" (cabbage leaf rolled with herbed rice and topped with garlic) ($9) which I enjoyed quite a bit. The cabbage provided a soft wrapping for the fluffy rice and the flavors all came together well. Finally I got a falafel sandwich ($4). Unfortunately, Chickpea does not currently offer a vegan variety of pita (their current offering has milk powder), so I only ended up with the components of a falafel sandwich. I'm glad that Chickpea was thorough enough to check the ingredients of its bread and accordingly label the dish ""vegetarian""; many other places probably wouldn't be so comprehensive. The hummus, falafel pieces and Jerusalem salad topping (tahini, cucumbers and tomato) came together well. I think the individual falafel pieces were a bit too grainy, heavy and densely-packed, and the flavor was too smoky, but I'm sure it would all come together in a decent pita. The owner told us he'll be getting a vegan pita fairly soon (wholewheat seems less likely). On a whole this is a nice little hip cafe with fairly cheap food, though the dinner specials can be pricier. This is an issue only because Chickpea is cash-only, so make sure to bring at least $20-$30 if you plan to try a few dishes.",0.976,0.821,0.131,0.048,0.5853802141011443

The service is at the counter, which is always awkward for me.  I want service, and I want to be sitting while I'm getting it.  That sounded weird.  I like being serviced by waiters.  That sounded weird too.  I give up. The food on the menu seems to be staple middle-eastern stuff for slightly more than I feel comfortable paying (12 dollars for lamb kebab).   The quality, however, is great.  The hummus plate had a spiciness that I enjoyed immensely.  Could have used a couple more slices of pita, dawg.   One odd thing, the guys working here don't seem befitting of a middle-eastern joint.  Portly white men, teetering around in eccentric t-shirts that make their patrons laugh.  I watch these guys bring the food to my table and am surprised with what's on the plate, ""shouldn't you be bringing me a half pound burger with a side of fries?""  Then again, I would never trust an overly-slender cook or restaurant owner.

It's like cafeteria seating, inside a Middle Eastern pool hall - minus the pool table, plus a few pinball machines.  You order at the counter, and take a number. We were there for lunch one Saturday afternoon and so the place was quite empty. Only one other table was occupied.  We ordered the trio of dips, Kufta Mihshew, Fasoolya and Falafel. Also two cups of tea.  The trio of dips was quite delicious. Possibly the best hummus, great baba ghannooj and koosa ma laban. Yum. Great start.  Then our entrees arrived. Everything smelled delicious.  The falafel were good, above average even. Nothing spectacular though. The Fasoolya - my entree - was one of the worst things I've ever had at a restaurant. The dish itself is braised lamb, green beans and tomatoes, served over rice. Sounds like a winning and comforting combination right? No. It was bland. Or is there a word for extremely bland?  obviously, I was not happy with my entree... I picked around at it for a bit, and then decided that it just wasn't even worth my effort to try to enjoy it. I pushed it to the side and humbly had a bit of my sister's kebabs and the rest of the dips.  By the time we were done eating, we definitely weren't going to stick around for something sweet. We paid our bill, and went to somewhere else to satisfy our sweet tooth.  Overall, there are so many better Middle Eastern spots around Chicago, that Chickpea does not even make the top 10 list.

What kind of a place in this day and age in Ukrainian Village does not take credit cards? It's pretty strange. I had to go across the street to take out $20. Come on now, no need to be cheap.  I walk in and I was the only one in the place. I look at the menu and order a dish. It consisted of a plate of hummus, 2 pita's split in two, and 3, yes 3 falafel balls. It was a total of $8.00. I also got an Izzie, a side order of rice for my husband and the hot sauce they sell on the side. It was $18.00 total. I think this was pretty pricy for what I got.   I sit down to read. Every few minutes the husband and wife team come talk to me. Now I don't mind friendly people, so I converse back, but I wanted to read. I am not lonely. I do not need to hold a conversation with you while I'm eating. I am perfectly fine sitting and eating by myself. Trust me. I'm a big girl.  The wife ""mama?"" keeps coming over gushing about her food and how all of the food is from her recipes. Wank, wank, I don't care. So I'm being nice listening to her boast on about it, but really I wanted some time to myself. In any case, the wife looks in my open purse and notices that I bought a jar of the hot sauce. Anyway, she leaves, goes to the back, retrieves my receipt, and comes back to my table to accuse me, (not ask me) of not paying for the jar of hot sauce. She tries to shove the receipt in my face to show me that she's telling the truth. I tell her that I don't have any more money, so she can take the jar if she wants. She inspects the receipt again and asks me who wrote the receipt - if it was her or her son. I tell her it was her son. She sees that I did pay and realizes that she made an error. I DID PAY after all. She alienated me and made me feel so unwelcome. I saw her husband cowering in the background. He was so embarrassed. I felt bad for him, but I should have felt bad for myself since I was treated like a criminal.  I ask the wife aka ""mama"" to bring me a box immediately so that I can wrap my food and go. She doesn't bring me a box, instead she man-handles my pita bread and wraps it up in the paper it was in. I'm not a germaphobe, but seriously? Gross.  Then she proceeds to tell me that I haven't eaten much. Yeah lady, like I'm going to eat here after you basically accused me of stealing a $3.00 jar of Chinese hot sauce. Then the husband comes over and brings me a free glass of tea, which I do not like. It's not because it's bad, but because I do not like tea, but I taste it anyway to be nice. It's okay for tea, but nothing to call home about.  Thanks (to the husband) for trying to make it up, but no dice. It would have been better if you just would've apologized since YOU were the ones that made the mistake.  I was planning on bringing my family there, but I will never spend another dime in this place. I can't believe they alienated a paying customer for $3.00. For goodness sake, please learn some manners. At the very least, hire a nice staff that has worked with the public.

So I will give Chickpea another try via one of Mama's Specials. Plus the waitstaff isn't bad looking either.",-0.7311,0.768,0.095,0.137,0.603030303030303

I arrived at Chickpea and it is a darling little spot--the decor is bright and charming!  Just from spending five minutes in there, I can see that it's not the type of place to go if you're in a huge hurry.  The woman behind the counter was thorough but sloooow.  Luckily my order was ready, and I knew that it was cash only from yelp, so it was all good.  I walked the few minutes home and dove into my Chickpea dinner.   First of all, the hummus was huge!  I was happy to see that for $8 I got the large container of hummus, three falafel balls, and two pitas.  Second of all, yum!!   Everything was delicious.  The hummus was the perfect blend of garlic and citrus, with some red onions and whole chickpeas floating around for good measure.  The falafel was crispy and not too greasy, and the flavor was great.  And lastly, the pitas were fluffy and light.  Done and done.  $8 and I have leftovers for tomorrow!",0.9969,0.744,0.251,0.005,0.6204761904761905

The vegetable plate is so good, with marinated spiced skewers of veggies, included giant grilled whole tomatoes. All in all, it felt like a feast for about $10/person.

She was so ready to pop my falafel cherry & let me tell ya--it was so sexy!  I totally jumped head first. I loved the soft outside, the crunchy garlic inside. There was cucumbers, tomatoes & tahini--OH MY! I was getting tingly half way through, from my head down to my toes. It is true--I fell in love with this little pocket of sexiness. Would I do it again? Oh yeah you know it.  This place was also super cute. I loved the decor. Old Hollywood movie posters in Middle Eastern.

2009-08-10,4.0,"I have a debilitating weakness for falafel, and I'm always on the hunt to find the latest and greatest restaurant to get my falafel fix.  Enter Chickpea. It's in a great location, for me at least, right on Chicago across the street from the Dominik's. Ample metered parking, lots of hustle and bustle. I'm liking it! I'm so glad Chickpea FINALLY got a sign out front. I seriously walked by this place so many times in the past few months before I was able to find it.  The restaurant is pretty small... there's only seating for about 25 people or so. It's cozy, and made cozier by the cool Middle Eastern movie posters on the walls, the cutesty Formica tables in bright colors and of course the mom and pop staff hard at work.  We ordered the hummus and falafel sandwiches. Pretty standard issue, but I don't like to get too adventurous my first time out of the gate at Middle Eastern restaurants. The hummus was good. It's a bit more on the lemony side rather than super garlicy and was a bit thinner than most restaurant hummus. Not to say I didn't enjoy it, though. The pitas it's served with are warm and soft, the perfect vehicle for maximum hummus consumption! Now, the falafel. The Chickpea falafel sandwich has probably the best presentation I've experienced, well, maybe ever. The super crispy falafel balls are sliced (no bulky balls in this sammy!) and instead of the usual cucumber salad, Chickpea thinly slices the tomatoes and cucumbers and layers them in with the sliced falafel. Add a thin layer of tahini sauce and bit of hummus and you've got yourself a stand out falafel sandwich!  For me, the price was on point. My falafel sammich, a can of diet Coke and a shared order of hummus came to $8.50. Not bad! And they deliver!",0.9903,0.8,0.156,0.044,0.607559523809524

2009-07-31,4.0,"THE WALK-IN: Walking into Chickpea has a great feel - the decor will be the first thing to catch your eye: multi-colored tile-top tables, lower-but-pleasant lighting, the free pinball machine in the back, a commotion of people - sitting and talking, or standing in line to order - and of course, the classic-action-movie posters (Rocky, Terminator, Conaan, Death Wish, Bruce Lee movies) with all their writing in what i believe is Arabic.  For a moment, I felt as if i very well could have been in a restaurant in some middle-eastern country, not that I have any idea what those restaurants are actually like. THE FOOD: Chickpea serves delicious Middle Eastern cuisine in competition for Best Hummus in a restaurant (I make my own Hummus) as well as Best Hummus ever (yeah, it may be even better than my own hummus, and I take pride in my Hummus!). Besides the Hummus which I split with a friend, I got the Kibbeh appetizer which was good and came with a cucumber-dill sauce/mini-salad that was reaaallly good - I wish i had had 2 times as much, but not because it wasn't an acceptable portion.  I followed it it up with the Chicken Shwarma sandwich that was near-perfect.    The Chicken and the peppers in the sandwich were both grilled perfectly, and the hummus spread inside made it all come together beautifully.  You could taste the freshness of the ingredients.  One negative was that there was a some space left at the top of the pita that I would have really liked to fill with that Dill Sauce but I couldn't get any - I asked and the order taker/cook/owner said $4; I just wanted a little, like $0.50 worth! CONS: There are some parts of your Chickpea experience that might leave you annoyed - it is cash only, you order first then sit down so you can't really ask for anything half-way through your meal, the food comes out as it's ready and some dishes do take a while to make (So I wouldn't suggest carry out unless you've phoned ahead, which I don't know if you can do but i don't see why not).   REBUTTAL: However, these annoyances melted away for after the meal because of their free pinball game - and I challenge you to do the same - take a few minutes after your meal to play a pinball game and I think you'll feel better and appreciate Chickpea more for what it is than what it is not. THE COMPETITION: As I see it, Chickpea and Sultan's Market are in a runoff for standout middle eastern food.  Deciding for one over another is a Tradeoff. Both have excellent food, but Chickpea seems to take extra time in their preparation and it shows when you bite into your meal.  That preparation adds something, but at the same time, Sultan's order-served-bam style for what is still great food is also satisfying in its immediacy.  If you're honest about what's more important to you at the time (experience or speed) and choose the right place (Chickpea, Sultan's Mkt., respectively), then I don't think you'll be dissapointed.",0.9967,0.789,0.17,0.041,0.5188253968253967
2009-07-30,3.0,"So I'm going to leave this review a bit open ended.  I had an alright experience here.   I was craving something a little different and decided to mosey my way on down to Chickpea.  It's a little bit hard to see from the street and unless you're looking for it, you can easily run right by it (like I have many times).  I'm greeted by someone who's sitting outside as well as some rain sprinkles from above (even though there's not a cloud in the sky).  He says...happens to me all the **** time too. Don't worry about it. Looking good, this place has character.  The menu is pretty straightforward, I ended up with a lamb kabob meal with spiced rice.  I ordered it to go and say i'll be right back to pick it up.  She took my name down and I was back in 10 mins.  The place wasn't really that busy, but she asked for my name again 5 times before giving me the meal.  Seriously?  I'm the only asian person to have walked in there in the past half hour. The food is pretty darn good, delicious actually.  But given I spent a little over $15 for essentially a small kabob and a small serving of rice, I felt a little jipped.  Perhaps the sandwiches are a better bang for your buck, which is why I'm not closing the door on this place.   Good food, not so good prices with a little character to boot.",0.9879,0.828,0.156,0.016,0.4508563074352548
2009-07-30,2.0,"I really wanted to like Chickpea, I really did; especially since I so miss the amazing shawarma and falafel I chomped on while in Israel last summer.   They happened to be filming something in there when I ran in for some quick takeout.  Quick not so much.  The mama owner, while rather cute, was also rather rude while taking my order.  Now I know that Middle Eastern women (and men) usually have tough exteriors but she really rubbed me the wrong way.  I ordered the Kharoof which has lamb, roasted veggies, and hummus.  I asked her if I could please have some tahina (tahini dressing) on side.  She told me that they normally don't do that (um why?) but would give me some anyway.  I offered to pay for it and she declined.  A few minutes later she told me yet again that they don't usually give tahina ""so that you know for next time"".  Again I offered to pay and she declined.  So then I waited. And waited. Looked around at the posters and waited.  Watched the film crew and waited. Man I was getting sick of waiting.  I saw the owner once again and decided to ask if I could purchase a small container of the tahina. Yes, I'm tahina obsessed people.  I was having visions of eating it with everything for the next four days.  Anyway, she said she would see if she could find a container.  She disappeared. I waited. And waited.  Looked at the pin ball machine and waited.  Her husband appeared and I asked him about the tahina.  He said no we don't have a container.  No container? How about the plastic box you put the pastries in?  The pastry box he asks? Then he laughs.  Umm. How about a small soup container?  Please sir, I can't find tahina anywhere and have to drive to Jewish stores in the burbs to buy it. Please.  Then I got a flat out no.  Should I not have mentioned the word Jewish? (joke people).  Then miraculously, like the sun starting to shine on a cloudy day my food arrived. 40 minutes later.  Yes, I timed it. 40 minutes! There was one other table in there. No joke. I booked it out of there and went straight back to my apartment and ripped open the foil to my long awaited sandwich because after that wait, I was damn near starving. So the lamb in my sandwich was superb....tender and moist and delicious. The vegetables were...wait a second, the vegetables?  Where are the vegetables?  Oh hello vegetables I didn't see you.  Perhaps that is because it took me half of the sandwich to find you.  Half of a very small sandwich by the way.  I'm still hungry after that $10 sandwich.   So the quest for a delicious Middle Eastern sandwich that reminds me of Israel is still on.  So is the quest for tahina that's closer than the burbs.  Perhaps I'm destined to search forever.  Only time will tell.  The one thing I know is, Chickpea I don't think I like you.",0.9783,0.827,0.107,0.066,0.3900108225108225

I was so livid after arriving home after getting my to-go falafel from this place that I could barely eat it, even though I was starving. I have been to Chickpea several times, and the service has always been a little lacking. I walked in, noticed the owner's son, who I have seen in there several times, kneeling at a table, talking to two customers. He did not acknowledge me at all. I walked to the counter and waited. And waited. And waited. For about ten minutes, I stood there, shifting around, waiting for the guy to get up and take my order or even acknowledge that he had a customer in his establishment. Nothing. Finally, a cook from the back saw me and came out to help me. As I sat waiting for my food, I sat there getting more angry by the minute at the complete lack of service. Another customer walked in, and the same thing happened to him. The owner's son kept right on talking, not even acknowledging that there was anyone else around him. Again, the cook had to come out to take the order, and even said kind of loudly, ""As you can probably tell, I'm not the one usually doing this,"" as he forgot to give the customer after me his number and his glass for tea. When the cook. who was very nice and apologetic, came out with my food, I thanked him, and while walking past the owner's son I made some remark about his wonderful customer service.

Lovin' the mix of traditional décor elements like bronzed colorful glass pendant lamps with far out kitch via cult classic movie posters like Rocky and Willow all in Arabic. Salam cuteness!  Fortunately the tasty goods were just as inspired... seriously one of the best falafel sandwiches I've had to date, hands down. I really appreciate super crispy balls (that's what she said!) and Chickpea delivers flawlessly with a totally moist inside and crunchy, perfectly browned outside falafel ball. Throw in your standard add-ins of cukes, tomatoes, hummus and garlicky tahini and you've got yourself a gold star winner of bombastic ball adoration. Can I also highly recommend the kufta kabab? Phenomenal grilled lamb sausages nestled up to a fluffy spiced basmati rice that dazzles with toasty pine nuts and plump raisins. In a word, mouthwatering.  Service was friendly and Mama Chickpea herself was perched at the front counter hollowing out eggplants... cute!

We went with the whole fam - mom, dad, 4 sibs and me (the in-law) and all were pleased. We went with one of the most picky eaters I know and she loved it. In short, if you have a crowd to feed Chickpea may be a go-to. However, they don't serve coffee and the rice pudding isn't that good.

2009-06-09,3.0,"I was craving falafel last night and I was grumpy.  My roommate bailed on yet another of our date nights in favor of laying on the couch and the boob tube.  By default, I joined her. Chickpea's delivery perked me right up.  I am such a food whore.  Comfort eating is my porn. Brad C. is right, our falafel and the baba ganoush were underseasoned, so I judiciously applied salt and pepper before topping everything off with a tablespoon or more of hot chili pepper paste.  I was quite pleased with the results.  My seasonings didn't overwhelm the food, but definitely brought out some flavor.  Forewarned is forearmed, or some such thing, right?  Also, the falafel was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  Hmmmm.  Lastly, it also came paired with a truly tasty pita. The price for 2 falafel sandwiches, an app of baba ganoush, delivery and 30% tip was still under $20.  I'm a fan.  Now, I've got to be honest with  my fellow Yelpers, the food?  It didn't come close to what I was served by the Israeli surfing transplants in Costa Rica, but the price and speed of delivery more than made up for the fact that this meal didn't topple my falafel hut sandwich off its pedestal.  Good standby.  I'll surely order again.",0.9664,0.841,0.128,0.031,0.5262371615312792

To wit: a silky baba, with a nice mouthfeel due to some generous olive oil dots, was ethereal in the worst way--no there, there. A lamb sandwich with chunks o' sheep, hummus, and roasted vegetables should have been a veritable salt bath; instead, it erred the opposite direction: nothing stood out, and the quick collapse of the grocery store-quality pita prevented any collective joy.

I saw her bring paprika over to a couple's table and tell them that their dishes needed it and proceeded to put some on their dishes. They seemed to enjoy it but others might freak.  It's all part of the experience, people.  - Service: My food came quickly and was well paced. I went on a Saturday afternoon around 2:30 PM. The place was about 75% full.  Dislikes: - I agree with others that the prices are a bit high for what you get. - Mix of counter and table service. It's definitely a bit confusing at first but now I know.  They need to explain this to people through signage or with a greeter at the door.  - Seating: They look interesting but you are sitting in painted plywood booths, which aren't that comfy if you plan to hangout with friends and have a long meal. I was there for about 30 minutes so I was fine.  - No sign or anything indicating it's a restaurant on the outside except for the sign that says ""Serving lunch and dinner from 11 AM - 10PM"".  Time to pony up for a sign, people.

This might sound a little nit-picky, but it was a very cold evening when we went and  there was a lot of people picking up takeout, so the freezing wind kept getting in and there is no getting away from it.  I would recommend to them getting a winter door like most restaurants in Chicago have.  Also, and this was one of the big reasons they lost a star, the pinball machine is LOUD, and with the loud music and the loud kids playing the pinball machine, we were ready to leave...that is until the food came Reasons this place is amazing: We ordered the dip trio, two of the Saturday Mama's special Mussakhkhan, two Arabian soda's and two Arabian tea's all for around $50 (the dip trio at $11 was the priciest thing we ordered).  The dips came out fairly quickly and they were GOOD.  The best damn hummus I have ever had, and we make our own at home.  The owner kept coming out and asking us if we wanted more pita bread, which we did because these dips were fantastic.  Once we were almost too stuffed to move, the Mussakhkhan came out.  BEST CHICKEN EVER.  The skin was nicely seasoned and crispy, the meat, so tender you almost didn't need a knife and it was served over this sweet onion mixture and more pita bread with some pine nuts.  Mama even came over several times to check on us and make sure I got the food in the carryout container alright.  The leftovers even heated up nicely in the oven the next day.   In the end the food was soo good that I will be a repeat customer for life, however, I will be eating it at home, where there are no kids screaming over loud pinball machines and a crappy playlist....and where I can enjoy a cold beer with my dinner.

I asked for a glass with ice, and was informed by the older woman that they ""don't have a freezer"". Ridiculous! Maybe my $9.00 hummus can help them pay for ice? That really turned me off. I had the kefta dinner, it was very good but I was still hungry after I was done. I also was not thrilled about the $2.00 extra charge to put pine nuts and raisins in my rice. Overall, this place is overpriced and overhyped. Try Grape Leaves in Oak Park, much cheaper and much better quality. AND THEY HAVE ICE!!!!!",0.8665,0.866,0.084,0.049,0.43799382716049384
2009-03-13,4.0,"I'm wavering between three and four stars. This is a really cute place with a very well thought-out design. Brightly colored interior, kitschy movie posters, and an awesome pinball machine make this place fun for a casual first date or dinner with a friend. Service is always fast, and super friendly. The owners and workers are really trying to make everyone's experience fun and enjoyable. I think I have to give four stars because of the sincerity and genuineness of the management and owners--they're just that nice.  So why not five stars? I find the food to be woefully under-seasoned.  Lentil soup is hot and creamy, but even I, a confirmed salt-sensitive (my mom never, ever used salt growing up) found it to be needing a little seasoning.  The lamb with green beans was a little overcooked, but that could be overlooked with a little seasoning. The chicken sandwich suffered the same fate--great char-grilled flavor, needs a sauce or something. I do really like their salads; the fattoush salad is especially good, with sour notes and wonderfully crisp pita.  The kibbeh is also quite nice, with hints of cinnamon and a nice crunch. I'll definitely be back here, as everything tastes fresh and it's only a couple blocks away from my apartment, but it's not a destination spot.",0.9873,0.718,0.219,0.063,0.5873655913978493

You order your food at a register located near the middle of the small storefront sized eatery and it is brought out to your table. It is difficult to know what's going on, where you can sit, how to get service. My friend and I took a seat vacated by a couple, but were moved when a larger party came in. The seating is so that, if you come in a party of two you may have to sit with another pair of people. My friend and I were seated by two bearded men with hummus in their facial hair. It made me want to barf. The ""hostess"" was very touchy feely. I think she caressed my back at least three times in the hour I was there. Seating and service is a free-for-all.  The food took at least a half hour to come out. We ordered two falafel sandwiches and a plate of hummus. The food was sub par. I could probably make better at home.

So, I was pretty excited to try Chickpea knowing there would be some Palestinian specialties on the menu. Hollie, Courtney and I decided to order a bunch of different dishes and share, which ended up working quite well! I started out with Mama's lentil soup, which was delicious - it was pureed, but not too thick. Mama herself came over to make sure that we were enjoying our soup! Our next ""course"" was the falafel plate, which came with 6 pieces, tahini sauce and a cucumber/tomato salad. The falafel was perfectly crispy on the outside and creamy, not crumbly, inside. Delicious. As the feast continued, we moved in a more meaty direction - going for the lamb kebab plate (with rice), lamb kebab sandwich (in a pita w/ hummus) and musakhkhan (spiced chicken baked with onions, on top of flatbread). The meat was cooked perfectly, and the spices on everything were just fantastic. We were going to split baklava for dessert until I selfishly claimed that I wanted my own piece, but I think that worked out for the best. Thank goodness for that separate dessert compartment in my tummy, otherwise I have no idea how I could have possibly eaten so much that evening! I really liked the entire Chickpea experience, and I will definitely be going back soon. If you dine in, you'll notice that it's a sort of ""fast fine dining"" experience. You order/pay first at a counter (cash only), but the food is brought to your table and it's full-service. There's a lot of stuff to catch your eye as you wait for your food - from the movie posters on the wall, to the free pinball machine, to the beautiful paper patterns on the tables, to the lamps, to the serving pieces, to the mannequin-head-in-a-jar (ask someone to tell you the story of how this came to be)! I'm a big fan of supporting independent restaurants, and with Chickpea it's really easy to see how much care and effort went into the place, and how much the owners appreciate their customers' patronage.

2009-01-10,1.0,"I feel like I am in a culinary twilight zone. Is there an alternate Chickpea in an alternate universe that all of you visited? First off, I went to Chickpea with the best of intentions- it is exciting to have a new restaurant open in the area that doesn't just serve pizza or bar food, and Sultan's is a long walk from Ukrainian Village. I wanted to like it. I wanted to be able to order it to go on a cold Sunday night.  No, this will not be happening. When me and my friends walked in, there was utter confusion. Do we sit? Will someone seat us? Why are these people staring at me (employees)? Which side of the counter do I approach? Do I grab my own drink? Is it grabbed for me? Why is someone fondling my midsection and mumbling questions at me (""Mama"")?  After the whirlwind of confusion, we were led, dazed, to a table near the door. Don't sit there- it is freezing cold. After Mama seated us and gave us the menu, reading half of it to us, we huddled together nervously wondering whether we need to go up to the counter and order, and whether we paid then or got a bill at the end. We finally decided to go up to the counter, grabbed our own drinks from the refrigerator, and shelled out about $18 each. This stuff don't come cheap. With the stress and confusion of the ordering process behind us, we eagerly awaited our food. It might help if they had a nice big menu board behind the cash register so you know that is where you need to order. -Trio of salads $9- less than you would get at Sultan's, ok. Kind of gritty- needed more flavor -Fava beans $6- beans, mashed up, with garlic. Came with bread and were good. -Chicken kabob $8- ONE chicken skewer and one vegetable skewer atop what tasted like plain white rice. Nothing exciting here. The real doozy, the reason I'm writing this review, is the dish that my friend and I both ordered, the Saturday special listed on the website as:  Mussakhkhan: The Palestinian national dish! Sumac-spiced roasted chicken with sautéed onions & pine nuts, served atop traditional Arabian bread. Sounds good, right? We both basically peeled off all the sumac flavor, which sat encrusted on a thick bed of greasy, flabby chicken skin. The meat underneath was greasy, and I had to try and gracefully remove blobs of fat from my mouth while eating. My friend picked through the chicken with her hands, claiming, ""You can feel it. That is the best way to avoid it. You just feel it out."" During operation de-fatten, the bread slowly became soggier and soggier with the mash of onions, what tasted like chicken schmaltz, and a few sad, lonely, pine nuts. I ate those, because I know they are expensive, and I wanted to get my money's worth. My friend remarked, ""I like this the best"" and pointed at a lone dry corner of the bread. We pushed around the food some more and tried to avoid the gaze and attention of Mama, who would probably sniff out our dissatisfaction, being that she visited our table no less than five times.   After concocting a plan of escape so that we would not have to answer to Mama (my friend remarked that he felt as if he needed to be excused from the table by her), we ran across the street to Dominick's. Our lips were greasy from the chicken, and we swiftly walked to the aisle where they keep the Tums. The decor was very nice, I will give them that. And the employees seemed genuinely invested in the restaurant. Normally I would not want to write such a review, but I really felt this needed to be said.

The older gentleman at the register asked if we'd been there before and when he found out we were newbies, sat us down, gave us menus and walked us through the ordering process (counter service with help yourself silverware, etc. next to the register). He made us feel completely at home and could not have been nicer. The service was incredible. We were sharing the items we got and they brought them out two at a time at a perfect pace. We were there on our lunch hour, so I loved that it was pretty fast, too. Amni (the executive chef) came out and introduced herself to us and asked our opinion on everything we ordered. She even sat down with us for awhile and made a special, fresh sample of tabbouleh for us after we mentioned that we loved the fattoosh and had been torn between the two. Now, THAT is good service.  You feel like you're eating in a very familiar, comfortable place. I loved the atmosphere. The posters were fun, the chandeliers pretty, the tabletops were gorgeous and the fact that all the plates are different and all beautiful was a great touch. Okay, now on to the food: Fatayar ma Laham: It looked like a little hand pie. Minced lamb, onion and pine nut pie. DELICIOUS! The flavors were subtly sweet with some heat at the end. It looked and tasted handmade which is always so nice. Lentil Soup: Blended, so it was creamy and delicious. It came in a pretty big bowl and I couldn't believe it was only $3. Instead of croutons, there were crispy pita chips in the center. I had trouble giving this one up when my coworker wanted to split. Fattoosh: SO FRESH! Tomatoes, cucumbers, scallions with an amazingly refreshing pomegranate dressing. This seemed like it would be good, but it is totally an example of a dish that is greater than the sum of its parts. I couldn't believe how much I liked it.  Tabbouleh: Another fresh and amazing salad. We licked the bowl clean and this will definitely be on the menu the next time we come. Bright, clean flavors that really taste healthy and delicious. Falafel platter: Best falafel I've ever had. That being said, this was probably my least favorite. Ha! The other things were just so freakin' good, that the falafel was amazing, but couldn't stand up to the salads or the soup. Arabian Tea: It's serve yourself, all you can drink and I definitely took advantage. It was mint when we were there (dunno if this changes) but it was GOOD. They also give you pretty, glass mugs that made the tea seem even more special. They brew from loose leaves because that's the way Amni likes it, and I totally agree. Paper bags leave a bad taste. I will be back VERY soon and I plan to play the free pinball next time I stop in.  Seriously, if you didn't catch the drift from my novel-like review, GO HERE!

2009-01-09,4.0,"So glad this is now in the 'hood!  I went there on a random Tuesday night.  When we first walked in, we just stood there looking confused.  We had to ask the other diners what the protocol was, another patron kindly told us to pick a table and order from the counter.   While we were standing at the counter reading the menu, someone introduced us to the chef, his mother, who makes all the dishes from scratch.  She gave us some good recommendations, and we ended up with a lot of food.  We got some tiny salad that was good, not great (and tiny for the $5 it cost), spicy hummus with awesome pita bread.  I ordered chicken kebabs, although I don't normally eat chicken this was Amish chicken so I figured it was ""safe"".  It was delicious.  My friend got the lamb cabbage special, he said it was also very good. I liked that one of the workers (owner?) told us we could play free pinball while we waited for our food (which was very quick).   I didn't like that it became super crowded and the dining room was uncomfortably tight.  It was more like communal dining at a food court rather than enjoyable evening out.  I also didn't like that the water cups were the size of Dixie bathroom cups.   Something that I neither liked nor disliked - but probably leaning towards dislike -  was the fact that the mother was hovering over us the entire time we ate.  She kept asking us about the meal, and since they were so busy I felt like we were rushed to finish and leave. Overall, I would definitely recommend this place for a casual lunch or dinner, although next time I'll definitely do take out.",0.9637,0.789,0.14,0.07,0.6278835978835979

I love the action movie posters on the wall! You go to the cashier to put in your order and you take a number to your table. It was pretty busy when we got there but the service was great nonetheless. The tables are pretty close together so don't expect to have an intimate conversation here. My dining partners and I ordered a lot of food. We had the Trio of Dips, the Trio of Salads, we each ordered our down dish (I had the Dajaj Mihshew and the Juice of the Day) and the Baklava.  Out of the Trio of Dips, I really enjoyed the Baba Gannooj and the Hummus. The Hummus really was excellent; I don't really have ""homemade"" Hummus often so it was a real treat.  The Dajaj Mihshew was good as well. It wasn't mind blowing (it's a Kabab, I haven't really had a bad one yet - hope I haven't jinxed myself) but it was a great dish. I'm glad that I asked for the pine nut, rasin and cumin spiced rice as it added a lot of flavor to my dish.  I had the carrot and apple juice that they blended to order which was great. It was about 8oz for $3. Pretty pricey but much better for me than paying $3 for food that isn't so good for me.  They also have daily specials in the evenings. Overall, the prices seem a bit expensive but are on par for the neighborhood. I think you do get what you pay for and you can tell by the service and quality of food that it is worth it.

The space itself is cool (check out some of the listed photos) with many Mideastern references with a smattering of American movie posters (most of which are pretty crappy action movies) on the wall with what I believe were the Arabic titles.  Also as mentioned many times- free pinball towards the back of the restaurant. The food was really quite good- very fresh, well prepared, and well presented.  My problem though was that on a Saturday they had about five things on the menu that were either not ready to be ordered yet, or not available.  I had mixed feelings about this since on the one hand I appreciate a place that sets some standards that doesn't allow crap to go out to the customers just to make a quick buck.  However, it was frustrating that the first two things I wanted to order I had to pass on. Like I said above- space was pretty cool, the food was really pretty good- but not a place I would drive way out of my way for.  Three-stars in my book makes it a good place though- so if you are in the area and want some quality Middle Eastern food, or even just a good cup of hot mint tea- check them out!",0.9964,0.685,0.261,0.055,0.5388888888888891

2008-12-06,5.0,"Chickpea has changed a lot since my first visit there on opening night, and the changes are definitely for the better and worth commenting about.  When I first ventured there on opening night, the fate of this place was uncertain to me.  The atmosphere was slow and quiet, and we were but one of three parties. When I walked in last night, every single table was full and the atmosphere was very much lively and warm.  The tables aren't very far apart from each other, but it all feels very comfortable.   We decided to put in our orders and wait it out for a table to open up.  The menu has also changed a lot for the better.  When I first visited Chickpea, the only vegetarian-friendly entrees appeared to be the falafel or the veggie pita.  Now, the menu is filled with a wide variety of vegetarian and even vegan options, each indicated on the menu with a symbol.  This is definitely helpful when you're ordering food that you're probably not super familiar with, yet eager to try something new.   The wait was very much eased with the help of the free pinball machine.   I wouldn't compare this place to Sultan's, as Sultan's runs more on the fast food side in my opinion.  Chickpea, on the other hand, has more of a casual sit-down vibe and is a bit pricier (about $10 per entree, and I would highly recommend getting an appetizer or two as well).  The presentation is very nice with the colorful printed dishes that hold the bright skewers criss-crossed over a circular mound of cumin-spiced rice and the hummus drizzled with olive oil and sprinkled with paprika, flecked with spicy garlic, chillies and a single whole chickpea. Anyway, awesome experience in a fun neighborhood place, and once again, food grilled to juicy perfection.  Everyone in our party left very pleased.",0.9976,0.735,0.237,0.028,0.524201195629767

FYI: No liquor, and BYOB not allowed.",-0.3328,0.904,0.033,0.063,0.32857142857142857
2008-11-14,5.0,"It'd be an understatement to consider my eating habits ""finicky"".  I'm not ashamed to say that I generally eat like a seven year old and it usually takes alot for me to get comfortable with food outside the realm of pizza and burgers. Especially when it comes to something like Middle Eastern food. First off, the decor is hysterical. The walls are plastered in American film posters done for Arab world. There's a giant 1989 Batman film poster in a tacky gold frame that greets you in Arabic, and it just gets better from there, all the way down to the addictive Genie pinball game.  I seriously live for their falafel. It's not mushy and isn't pre-made or frozen like another 'market', a place that made me almost hate the stuff. It's crunchy, it's hot, it's extremely flavorful. They're meats are grilled exquisitely; I had some tenderloin that came served with grilled veggies and warm pita and it was juicy, smoky, and tender!  Service was a bit rocky, but the front of the house were charming enough and the food more than made up for it. I can't hold it against them since they are brand new, and I trust that all the kinks will be worked out very soon. I was told that the menu given out on opening night was not the final draft, but with so much to offer at such a genuine quality and affordable prices, I don't mind too much and can't wait to see what they have in store for the future.  I will definitely be coming back soon, and many times thereafter.",0.961,0.871,0.1,0.029,0.5243362193362193
2008-11-14,5.0,"I am a long-time vegetarian and short of being a completely vegetarian or vegan restaurant, Chickpea could not be more veg-friendly! The vegetarian and vegan options are clearly marked and plentiful! The falafel is out of the this world! I consider myself a falafel snob of sorts and am not easily impressed. Very flavorful, perfectly crispy on the outside. The hummus is amazing. I am eager to try every other vegetarian item on the menu. My carnivorous boyfriend was equally impressed with his meal. The atmosphere is fun and kitschy. There is a free genie pin-ball game available for customers to play which I predict will result in many competitive showdowns between friends! Go eat at this place, you won't regret it!",0.9667,0.71,0.218,0.072,0.5453125
2008-11-14,5.0,"AMAZING! Home cooked, affordable, fresh, and an environment that makes you feel relaxed. This place seems as if it slows time and whisks your troubles away the minute you peek at the menu.The food is delicious and you can tell that it was cooked with heart (love-heart not heart-heart). The current menu -they are in the process of adding to it- has a choice for everyone, and if lamb kabobs aren't your favorite, try one of several vegan dishes!!  The family environment and flavorful menu will have me coming back for more, and often!",0.8865,0.81,0.139,0.051,0.5375
2008-11-14,5.0,"Chickpea is fresh and delicious-- the flavors are spot on. The owner told me they bring in the produce and meat daily and they make everything from scratch. You can taste the difference in every dish. Even something as basic as the hummus is remarkable. It's topped with finely minced peppers and is phenomenal. The lamb kabob was perfectly cooked and the pine nut, raisin and cumin rice is the way to go. The stuffed zucchini was a real standout. I can't wait to go back and try more dishes. Next time the stuffed grape leaf. Great addition to the neighborhood. It's cash only but they have an ATM inside and it only charges a dollar!",0.6948,0.9,0.078,0.022,0.5283333333333333
2008-11-13,4.0,"Housed in the old Bleeding Heart Bakery space on Chicago Ave. just west of Damen, Chickpea is a brand new Middle Eastern spot that is less Hot Topic and more Hot Tiberias.  The walls are plastered with 80's Hollywood movie posters...Who Framed Roger Rabbit next to Timecop, and all in Arabic.  There's even a pinball machine in the back to keep you busy while you wait for your fattoush.  I've never stalked a restaurant before, but I've been staring in the windows at Chickpea for weeks waiting for them to open, and even though I felt like I was cheating on Sultan's, I raced there within an hour of their opening.  I got the falafel sandwich, which sets the benchmark at a Middle Eastern place for me, and I wasn't disappointed.  It wasn't the biggest or most exciting falafel sandwich I've ever had, but it was fresh and flavorful and had all the necessary parts to satisfy a growing boy.  Their menu is also more varied than most other order-at the counter Middle Eastern joints in town.  With tons of veggie options, reasonable prices, friendly staff and a dangerous proximity to my apartment, I'm sure they'll be sick of my mug within a month!",0.9241,0.814,0.125,0.061,0.4766247641247641
2008-11-13,4.0,"I've been waiting for this place to open for a few weeks now. Talking to the owners one Sunday as they were painting the place, I got an idea of what it was about. Though most people would assume it is Arabic, it's actually Palestinian. Take it from me, my grandmother is from there... I ordered the Lentil soup and a Falafel sandwich, and it is the tastiest thing I've had. Though I've always been appreciative of Sultan's...I have to say this place is the best bar none...Though the appearance is kitschy, yet fun..the cooking is exactly how my grandma use to make it. The owners are exceptionable, the staff is great, and the menu is by far the most versatile to traditional Middle eastern cuisine..  I think I found a place to frequent often now.",0.9169,0.914,0.086,0.0,0.45769230769230773
