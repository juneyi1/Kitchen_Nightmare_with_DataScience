2012-10-29,5.0,"I ate here every day for a week while in Chicago on business and I give a five star on the overall ratings. The food is good, but there are hundreds of places in Chicago with good food. The ambiance is good, but again, the ambiance in many places is good. What makes the difference at Caliterra is the combination of those two things, topped off by the nice people who work there.  And that's no small thing, especially in a big city like Chicago.  The staff is nice, They're not angry...at you....that they have a job, a growing trend in so many eateries where I spend my money. Our waiter, Tom, was cheerful and funny but very professional, he knew when to drop by our table and for how long to drop by. The porter, Louise, is a happy soul who keeps the bread, water and coffee flowing and does it with a smile. When you're in a city full of strangers, its nice to see a smile. They also let you hang out at the table as long as your heart desires.        We recommend the nightly $35 special, try the rib eye steak. The ice cream desert is better than average.

2011-05-19,3.0,"Restaurant review Fancy restaurant is the best way to describe the feeling when walking into the dining area of this Wyndam hotel restaurant. This review is limited to my experience a couple months back for lunch. The overall ambience is very formal, fitting for a business luncheon. I don't remember all of the items, but they had a lunch for 10 dollar menu that included different sandwiches, salads, and more w/ drink. I wish I could remember the rest, but thsi was before I started to yelp. I had no complaints for lunch, but looking at the dinner menu this could get pricey and likely not worth the $$. Pro: very nice dining room, formal, excellent service, great 10 dollar lunch special Cons: expensive dinner time menu, appears limited, likely better places for dinner that are more romantic or fun depending on what you are looking for Hidden gem: 10 dollar lunch specials, 20% off for NMH hospital employees",0.9845,0.727,0.208,0.065,0.4836580086580087
2010-11-12,3.0,"Yeah....It's sad....just so sad. I'm not even sure what happened. Maybe the chef changed, maybe its the management...we don't know and we don't care. All I can say is they went downhill.  We went this past weekend using a  restaurant.com  certificate which we had purchased b/c our 1st experience was so great... Anyway, we ordered off the $10 lunch menu just like last time. We noticed it changed and got a lot simpler...so basically just sandwiches and salad. The mac and cheese....GONE!  Anyway, we ordered the BBQ pork and  fish tacos for our meal there, and then to go ('cause you have to spend $35) we got a patty melt and croquets (from the apps menu)    . Bland, bland and bland....fish tacos. The fish wasn't great at all, the cabbage tasted a little bitter and the portion....ummmm...tiny. The best part of the dish was the ramekin of chipotle salsa. BBQ pork...found some fatty pieces in there and wasn't a fan of the cold bun or the sauce on the pork. The patty melt was not bad...simple and I can't imagine how that can be messed up (unless it was raw or overcooked)  Croquets...again, not interesting at all. The marinara sauce made them decent, but they were also boring and...where's the beef? Or meat of any kind....yeah, not too good at all. So to top off our disappointment in the food, when we gave the server our certificate, he told us we are not allowed to use it on the lunch menu. Really? Why?  He said that management changed the rules and said they consider that a special. I looked at the certificate and read what it said, told him we did the same thing last time and it was fine, and was told ""yeah they changed that""...BUT NOT IN THE RULES OF THE ACTUAL CERTIFICATE!! You can't change the rules in the middle of the game people! You have to update your new certificates to say this...not just give me your new made up rules. Even though the bill was not big...its the principle. I asked to speak to the manager...who ended up being too busy to come over and they just took the certificate.

2010-03-30,4.0,"I went here with my mom for a mini celebration. We've been here before but we have never sat in the dining room for dinner. We also had a  restaurant.com  gift certificate so we thought we would give it a try. I ordered a martini from the bartender and it was great. I had him whip one up for me and he got it right on the button. I ordered from the prix fixe menu and got a wedge salad, ny strip with mashed potatoes and then a chocolate dessert. I definitely thought the price of $34 was a great deal for this and the food was pretty darn good. Only negative I have to say is that the menu overall is quite limited; you don't have a lot of options. However, whatever you order is delicious. The service was also really good. Since my mom didn't have the prix fixe menu and therefore no dessert, he just brought an additional one on the house so she would also have dessert. It's not very crowded and the atmosphere is great. Overall I think its a hidden treasure. So as long as you don't mind the few choices, anything that you pick will be amazing.",0.9922,0.743,0.211,0.045,0.5295739348370928

It was good, they had turkey, ham, mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, some veggies and salad, but that was it. They also had some mini pies which were good (pumpkin, pecan and apple caramel cheesecake). The service was great, but there was hardly anyone there so I don't know how it couldn't be. Overall it was good, but I probably wouldn't go again since it wasn't anything special and there really wasn't a lot to choose from (which to me is the best part of a buffet).",0.9691,0.776,0.199,0.025,0.48130952380952385

2009-06-01,3.0,"Hotel restaurants are a bit of a different breed.  You pay a little extra for convenience and you aren't too taken aback if the meal isn't the best you've ever had. Just returned from a pretty great, albeit pretty short trip to this impressive city, and a very pleasant stay at this hotel.  (the Wyndham)  The Caliterra, a Zagat rated restaurant, located on the lobby level of the hotel got my business twice and it had more going for it than agan it.  But between the two meals there was a stark contrast.  So here's my [un]professional opinion: Dinner was great.  Expensive, but excellent.  I fully enjoyed my salmon with mushroom, parmesan risotto, and I left zero evidence on my plate that a meal ever existed.  The southwest chicken salad had a good, tangy dressing and the chicken was tender and juicy.  Also, our waiter at dinner was attentive, friendly and was totally welcoming to us Los Angeles out of towners. Since we blew in close to closing time and were still on Pacific Coast hours, after dinner we adjourned ourselves to the comfortable lounge area to have another glass of wine and watch the Lakers beat the Nuggets. *woo* The lounge and the restaurant were a touch swanky and had a nice, sexy feel to it.  again *woo* The second time I ventured in was for breakfast on our last day there.  Since Ms. Paradise was already on her way to a business meeting (my professional lady)  I was on my own.  Totally different experience at breakfast time.  If breakfast was my only experience here they would have gotten a one star review from me. The choices for their breakfast were either a 12 dollar continental, consisting of a few muffins and some fruit, or a 15 dollar ""buffet"" which had the continental side plus chaffing dishes with scramble eggs, bacon, sausage, and hash brown potatoes, oh and they had a vat of oatmeal too.  Seeing the marginal difference in money, I opted for the full shebang. The scrambled eggs were still runny, and gave me a nasty stomach ache fifteen minutes later.  The bacon was too salty to finish.  The sausage and hash browns weren't bad, but after the sloppy eggs and bacon my appetite went away quicker than usual. Also, a pet peeve of mine (other than the fact that I just used the term ""pet peeve"") is not getting equal attention from the restaurant staff.  My waitress was alright, but I saw the manager go to every other table and ask the patrons how their meal was and he didn't once glance my way.  After spending almost 20 bucks on a meal that should have been $2.49 tops, that bugged me. Bottom line, very nice place to enjoy dinner or a drink, but they really need to get their morning shit together.",0.9958,0.822,0.146,0.032,0.605072463768116

2009-02-24,4.0,"Only thing keeping it from 5 stars was the beef tip egg noodle dish (forgot what it was called). It was good, but could have been great if they had not served it in such a deep bowl. It was awkward to eat the really long, flat egg noodles. It tasted alright, but a little bland, and a bit too fatty. Maybe that's what made it melt in your mouth tender. Overall okay taste. What blew me away and gets 3 of those 4 stars is the dessert. I have what I think was called a chocolate gateau. Amazing if you would like a combination of chocolate mousse, caramel mousse, rich chocolate cake, chocolate ganache, candied kumquats, and mocha ice cream. One word, again, it was AMAZING.  The red pepper soup was very close to a tomato bisque. Not worth what was paid (my co-worker and I were treated to this delightful meal by our manager so praises to that!). I would definitely go back for the dessert and some black coffee. Oh yeah, and service was just a smidge above average.",0.9952,0.736,0.255,0.009,0.49548611111111124
