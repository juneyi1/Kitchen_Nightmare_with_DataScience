The food was pretty good, especially since they brought it out to us pretty quickly since I made sure to inform the waitress that our show was next door and starting pretty soon (though she also had reassured us that we would definitely get our food, eat it all and be seated with time to spare before the show started). It's a dimly lit restaurant that gives off the air of a dive bar -- but not one of those scary-looking ones.

Anyway, she took our food orders (failing to ask us which side we wanted but at that time we were so annoyed we just wanted to be gone) and we got our food out at a decent time.  Mine was supposed to be on ""Texas toast"" which is typically a buttery delicious bread.  In this case, it was dry, huge and toasted, but flavorless and again...dry.  On the 1 good note, I got the blackened chicken and it was some of the best blackened chicken.  Very juicy and tasty seasoning.  Maybe this is what's keeping it in business? ...

I usually like to review the service, menu and atmosphere but in all fairness to the staff, a whole large group of us descended on the place all at the same time. And given that there seemed to be one waitress for the whole place, I'll give the staff some slack. That being said, service was still quite good despite that. We were promptly seated, given menus and our drink orders were taken and received in a fairly short period of time, regardless of crowd size. What I appreciated about our server is she managed to keep a good attitude and a smile on her face despite it being nearly impossible to navigate between the hordes of people jammed into the bar area (and a really drunk loud guy who seemed to be hell bent on knocking into everybody and spilling their drink). I had the Shepherd's Pie and the wife had the Chicken Pot Pie and both were excellent. The Shepherd's was a nice size, filled with well seasoned beef and topped with mashed potatoes. I appreciated that it was more meat than potatoes (like some places you get this in). HP steak sauce was a nice bonus too. The Chicken PP was HUGE and filled with chunks of real chicken and a nice sauce. A perfectly flaky crust topped it al and it was so big the wife couldn't finish it. Again, quite excellent.  Our food came out quickly given the crowds so we were happy about that.  One thing to know about the place is it's a tight. We were at a table near the window and there was no room to move your chair and people will bump into you as they try to walk by to get to the bar. So I wouldn't call this a first date place. Or maybe it is because you will be very close to each other for the entire evening. Overall I'd definitely go back as between the food, service and atmosphere, it's a nice change of pace from the usual Wigleyville places that surround it.

The service is usually pretty good. Plenty of beer options. It has become my go-to place before or after a show at The Music Box. What got me hooked is that they've got really decent vegetarian and vegan options. This is not an easy thing to find in a pub. They do a veggie & hummus wrap that's surprisingly tasty, and they've also got a good veggie burger served with avocado and salsa. If you're just snacking, there's a hummus plate on the appetizer menu. None of these things would necessarily be exceptional on their own, but to find them in a place like this just warms my little meat-free heart.

When my friend and I stopped in for a drink, and when the bartender asked what I wanted, I said that I thought they had a pinot grigio and asked for that.  The bartender proceeded to insinuate that I wouldn't know the taste difference between a pinot grigio and anything else (actually, he said that).  Huh?  Not sure where that came from, but I was not amused.  I got less amused when he proceeded to continue to make weird comments to us.  Now, I realize most people probably drink beer in this place - however, I know they have more than one wine and I don't understand the attitude.  I have never had this happen to me before and it shouldn't matter what I order.  This was early in the evening before dinner - weird.

We came here for dinner before a burlesque show and could barely carry on a conversation at our table due to the volume in the bar. My boyfriend actually had to leave because he was getting a headache since his corner seat was basically an echo chamber. 2. The food was at the high side of average bar food. Everyone enjoyed their food. I had the sliders appetizer. They were good but a bit greasy. The onion rings looked really good, but I didn't get to try one. My friend's chicken wrap arrived sans chicken, but more on that in a minute. 3. The staff here is what really earned the fourth star. Our waitress was a wonderful Irish woman. She was sweet, helpful, and extremely friendly. The owner (I think) came by to check on us twice. When the chef forgot the chicken in the chicken wrap, our waitress handled it impeccably. They brought my friend a dish of chopped chicken breast as well as some hummus to add on the wrap if she wanted. The waitres was extremely apologetic without being ridiculous.

The scene: beautiful Sunday night, the kind where you must eat outside. Done. Nice but small seating area.  The service: let's just say one waitress was not enough for the entire restaurant.  The food: the man friend's burger looked delicious (and like a rather large portion) and his fries were perfect. My food, however, was incredibly bad. A Mediterranean salad is exceedingly simple to make, but also exceedingly simple to screw up if you do a few things wrong. Cullen's did all the wrong things: old lettuce from a bag, flimsy red onions, maybe 5 kalamata olives, and barely enough feta to even take notice. Not to mention that the chicken tasted and smelled like it was from a can.  Having a meal like that makes me question the quality of any and every ingredient a restaurant puts in its dishes.

2012-03-21,4.0,"I was probably one of the very first customers that Cullen's ever had back when they opened in the mid 1990's.  I was living near Irving and Greenview and used to walk by the place before it opened, peeking through the brown paper covering the windows and eagerly anticipating the day when I could go inside.  I went there on the day it opened, enjoying a beer at the bar with Eloise, Mike Cullen's sister. Cullen's was basically a labor of love built by Mike Cullen, featuring hand craftstmanship and great care.  Since day 1, the atmosphere inside has been warm and welcoming, and the menu has remained fairly consistent over the years.  Cullen's was designed alongside the Mercury Theatre (Mr. Cullen's profession was in theatre design), and the two are conjoined inside.  The main room features a few standing tables and 6 or 7 booths, one of them being an extra large 'prime' spot in the back.  During the summer, Cullen's has an excellent outdoor patio space along Southport, a favorite for pre and post game Cub fans who don't want to deal with the hurly-burly of Wrigleyville. From a restaurant standpoint, Cullen's has some basic staples which are excellent:  Mother Cullen's Meatloaf, Fish n' Chips, Chicken Pot Pie, Shepard's Pie, and Mac n' Cheese.  They have other entrees which seem to change from time to time.  As for sandwiches, I highly recommend the Bookmaker's Steak Sandwich:  it's a marinated skirt steak done how you like it, and it's one of the best (read:  flavorful and not overly chewey) in the city.  They also have solid burgers, a terrific blackened chicken, and a nice ham and cheddar ""toasty"".  Sides include a variety of salads, the requisite fries, curry chips, and my favorite, beer-battered onion rings.  I have eaten at Cullen's probably 50 times (or so) since it opened, and I can honestly say that I have never had a bad experience or been dissappointed with my food.  The bar has a decent assortment of drafts, heavy on the Guinness/Smithwicks type stuff. From a service perspective, Cullen's treats their people well and they tend to have a larger % of tenured people working there.  And while any bar/restaurant with the type of customer volume this place has can have a bad day or a bad moment or a rogue server, your chances of receiving good, consistent service here are better than most places.  I have had some really great/fun times in this place, and those days usually include kidding around with the staff, who can sling it right back at ya. There is rarely a wait here at Cullen's, unless you insist on one of the booths (and I do, because they tend to be quieter).  But I don't mind waiting at all because the bartenders take care of you while you wait.  On some evenings, Cullen's can be fairly crowded, and so you have the typical struggle to get served at the bar just as any crowded bar.  During intermissions of whatever play is going on next door, the patrons invariably flood into the bar for drinks.  And when intermission is over they vanish again. So what are the ""problems"" with Cullen's?  1) I haven't been there on a Saturday night in years, because they would throw up a live band in the front of the bar.  And I like places such as Cullen's for food and conversation, not to have to shout over live music.  When I want live music I seek it out at places like the Elbow Room, Schuba's, or Martyr's.  I H-A-T-E it when small, cozy restaurants or bars throw live music in your face on weekend nights.  I just want to talk with my friends!  A house-controlled stereo or selective jukebox with volume control would be far better for ambient background music.  2) Cullen's is very good and therefore very popular, and it can get pretty crowded.  When overly crowded, any good place can suffer a temporary quality lapse.  Don't hold it against Cullen's if you go there and they are slammed.  Come back some other time during off hours to get a real feel for the place. a final note:  Cullen's is a big favorite among minor Chicago celebrities:  John Mahoney, Bonnie Hunt, John and/or Joan Cusack (among others) have been spotted here enjoying a meal.  You're more likely to catch them during a quiet weekday lunch than during a crowded evening. Cullen's (Mike, Eloise), I'm a customer for life, and wish you all the best! *Late summer 2012 update*: They've changed the menu a bit.  nothing catastrophic.  They've added a new fish entree, and they've changed the steak sandwich so that it is now nothing special.  Old standbys such as Chicken Pot Pie, Meatloaf, and fish and Mac n cheese are still there.",0.9987,0.838,0.148,0.014,0.5327170052170053

The down side to this place for me was the bartender. It was a Monday night and there were very few people in there. We thought we'd be able to get a quick drink before our movie. Tough luck! Upon sitting at the bar (the only ones at the bar), the bartender slowly walked around behind the bar. We thought she was going to serve us, but she did not even acknowledge us right away. She was busy speaking with a woman who appeared to work there. She was discussing how she went to a top grade undergrad school for her degree, and how she she technically should have her BSN, because she has all the qualifications, etc, etc... Um, I'm sorry that you have to bartend with all your fancy learnin' under your belt, but you're lucky to have a job!  When she did finally come over, she wasn't even pleasant about it. This place still got 3 stars from me, because I liked the atmosphere, and the location. I will go back to try it again, and try some food.

2010-08-23,4.0,"I really want to love this bar because it's close to where I live, and sometimes I really do. Other times-not so much. I have to begin by saying that their mac and cheese is the best that I've ever had in my LIFE. I can't really describe just how amazing it is-lots of cheese, crispy bread crumbs on top, a perfect little salad on the side-it's awesome. I have to go at least once every couple weeks to have it. I've never had anything else on the menu (really, why would you?), but a friend got the BBQ chicken quesadillas, and she was very disappointed. They had very little BBQ sauce on them, and so she asked for some on the side. Our server came back and told us that they ran out of BBQ sauce, so he gave her a bottle of A1 steak sauce instead! Seriously? She tried it, and let me tell you, not a good combination. In terms of drinks, I have no complaints at all. They know how to correctly pour a Guiness, which wins them points in my book. They have an okay wine selection, and their mixed drinks are good-not weak like a lot of bars in the city. So now the reason that I want to love this bar but I can't-the service. Because of my mac and cheese obsession, I've been here many times. I've sat at the bar, on the patio, in the main room, and even in the little room off to the left side of the bar. There have been times that the service was great. We had a male server (Matt maybe?) who kept our drinks full, made corny but funny jokes, and was overall just a lot of fun. The majority of the time, though, the service has not been good. I've sat for 15 minutes at times before someone has come to take an order. After the food is delivered, very rarely has someone come back to check and make sure everything is okay. Multiple times, my drink order has been messed up, or other tables drinks have been delivered to my table. Not sure what the deal is, but if they would just get this aspect of the bar fixed, it would be perfect. Seriously, though, go try the mac and cheese. It's worth the bad service.",0.9875,0.762,0.158,0.08,0.4939814814814816

2008-11-15,3.0,"Cullen's falls into the category of bars on Southport between which I cannot differentiate. You know, Mystic Celt, Messner's, SoPo, Blue Bayou... Recently I planned a going away party at Cullen's. It fell on Halloween weekend, so it was hard to find a bar that could accommodate us. But Cullen's was happy to do so. We arranged a $33 you call it package from 7-10pm in the back room area. I guess the one thing that I forgot about Cullen's is that it's attached to the Mercury Theater (which can be blamed on the fact that I had no idea which bar on Southport Cullen's actually was). So we walked in at 7:00 ready to get hammered and the place was full of old people. Like, older than my parents old people.  The old people left by 8:00 when the show at the Mercury started, and all was well from that point on. A few of us sat at a table and ordered some wings; they were average, but the garlicky bleu cheese dressing that came with them was awesome. We started hording it so that when my friend's burger and fries came later we could use it for the fries. Our server was friendly and attentive, as well. The size of our party ended up being about half of what we expected and just a handful of people actually bought wristbands for the open bar deal, but the party planner and bartender didn't seem to take issue with it (I must have drunkenly apologized for having lame friends at least a dozen times). The bartender, Maureen, was super friendly and poured great GG & sodas. By the end of the night I was so drunk that I couldn't speak--scary, but at least I got my $33 worth right?

I returned from the restroom (that was about 120 degrees) ready to say my goodbyes and get out of there when I see it.  Another drink at the table with my name on it.  Great.  Thanks for listening to me when I said I was leaving guys, really. So, I resigned myself to the fact that I would be there for a little while longer and sipped on my VERY well poured drink.  Yummy vodka, I love you, and the bartender you came from.  The band's set ended, thank god, and we just sat around chatting.  I don't think anyone knew what to think of the place...  It had a weird layout.  It wasn't very crowded and it seemed like everyone there knew each other, which is a good thing, I know.  The music played between the band's set was pretty good and not too loud.

Mind you, we were seated near the kitchen, so they walked by plenty of times to see us sitting there with rumbling tummies.  The bf ordered a cherry coke - so out came a coke with a cherry. No grenadine. OK, fine, they're Irish, maybe they don't get it.  Since he was so hungry, he finished his plate of chicken strips and mashed potatoes with no problem, though he did comment that the chicken strips looked more like fish, whatever that means. I ordered the chicken sandwich with a side salad. The bun was so dry that it chunked off when I took a bite, and the salad was mostly made of the part of iceberg lettuce that most people throw out. ICK!  Of course, they had no problem serving us speedily with the check. And we had no problem tipping them accordingly.",-0.8977,0.797,0.079,0.124,0.5165458937198067

2006-05-09,3.0,"I really liked the decor of the place inside of the bar, but since it was so nice out yesterday, I opted for outdoor seating.  The onion rings and chicken fingers were quite tasty, and the Blue Moon helped wash it all down.  Prices were reasonable, however, felt that the sandwiches were priced a little on the higher end ($10 for a burger??).  I gave this three stars based on the fact that I felt that the waitress forgot about me as it took a half hour after we finished eating to ""check"" on us--it was pretty slow on a Monday evening with no specials, and the higher end prices for food.  It took even longer to receive the bill.  I will try this cute little Pub again, just because everyone has had good experiences here.",0.9608,0.84,0.14,0.019,0.5937037037037037

2006-04-03,3.0,This irish bar can get a bit crowded but I still seem to have a good time whenever I go.  It's best to go when there is a live band because everyone always seems to get in to the music and dance!  Went here the other night and got lots of free drinks and shots for my birthday.  Thanks bartender!,0.9663,0.733,0.267,0.0,0.39642857142857146

2006-02-23,4.0,"Very good food and nice atmosphere (even though I'm not normally into that sort of thing)... even though the waitstaff were kind of distant, someplace I'd actually go back to again. Besides, they served perfectly drawn pints of Blue Moon (with a slice of orange), heaven in itself. Any faux-Irish pub that Frank McCourt drank in, and actually admitted to, can't be half bad....",0.9312,0.796,0.204,0.0,0.5193939393939394

2005-08-27,5.0,"Right next store to the Mercury Theatre this Irish stlye bar/rest. will be added to my list of new favs. Their food was outstanding, reasonably priced, served in a cool atmosphere. Cool in this case is photos of every Irish rocker I've ever seen, every Irish poet or playwright I've ever heard of etc... Almost every inch of the the walls were lined with photos and paintings. In another room they have framed posters of what seems like every play The Mercury has ever presented. Currently the Mercury doesn't have a play running, I'm kinda glad, so we went for a walk after our  meal. The Music Box is also just down the street.",0.9486,0.848,0.152,0.0,0.41954989454989455
