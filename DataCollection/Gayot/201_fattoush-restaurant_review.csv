I love Middle-Eastern cuisine and was initially excited to give it a shot.         The server was initially kind and suggested the falafel. I ordered it and started looking over the menu. Right after taking my order my server brought out a bowl of baked chickpeas. I thought it was interesting but was instantly dismayed after eating one. They are virtually flavorless and dissolved into a chalk-like texture in my mouth. Very unpleasant. I decided after that I would stay on guard and try my appetizer before ordering a full meal.          I sat wondering what could be possibly taking so long given the fact that I was literally the only person in the restaurant when finally after about 25 minutes my falafel came. It was instantly apparent what had taken so long, my falafel was overcooked. It was so hard in fact that when I tried to take a bite with my fork it just kept sliding out from under it! The taste? Once again there was no flavor to be found (not something I typically associate with Middle-Eastern food, and rather insulting after chewing on that shell). I tried a second bite, this time with some of the hummus. Now the hummus had flavor... a rotten and bitter one. I immediately asked for my check.             The server asked me what was wrong with the food and after I told her about it she said she was sorry. I was still charged for the food, of which I took literally two bites.             I'm deeply surprised to see that so many people have had good experiences at this restaurant. I'm glad that they are not that bad all the time, otherwise I've no idea how they stay in business. I'll never return and gladly warn people to never go.",-0.9697,0.794,0.068,0.138,0.6676267281105991

The beef shawarma was good - really tender - but the two chicken portions were pretty bad.

I was expecting tender chunks of chicken that has been marinated and roasted. These tasted like they were factory assembled and then microwaved.  The presentation (yeah, I know it was delivery but still) was also really bad. Everything was lumped together on top of rice so it all ended up mixed together.

It's nothing to recommend, the menu is limited, and the gluten-free aspect seems to negatively affect the bread-like products such as the crust in the spinach pie and the pita bread. I found the spinach pie crust and pita bread nearly inedible. Are they equating salt with gluten? I've had far better pita from a grocery store and at some of the diviest of dive gyros spots. With the exception of the baba ganoush, which was so bland that not even salt could help it, the food was just okay. And we had a lot of it. The desserts were a joke, really. One teeeeeeeny, tiny baklava about the size of a child's pinky was one dollar, one bite, and really dry. The service was good to almost intrusively so. It's reasonably priced for the neighborhood.

2011-02-23,2.0,"Fattoush.... your food is honestly good, if you would just get your act together. The service here is so bad it's just inexcusable.  Let me rephrase my last comment.... the service itself isn't ""bad"" per se. It's just insanely slow. And by insanely slow, I mean it took them 50 minutes to bring hummus and pita to our table. Our server apologized about 9 times and kept refilling our drinks, so he was doing his best. In terms of service, he was trying. Nothing really makes up for a near hour long wait for hummus and pita though.  The hummus was very good. The pita was tragic. I've purchased better pita at Jewel, let alone at Whole Foods. It's apparently made in house, but it wasn't even warm when they brought it to the table. Pita sad face.  Fattoush salad came out ~15 minutes after the hummus and pita. The salad was pretty average. I've had better Fattoush salads before but this was definitely acceptable. My only thought here is that if the restaurant is named ""Fattoush"", perhaps they should think about figuring out a way to make their namesake Fattoush salad really excellent? I mean, it's a salad, not rocket science. If they tweaked their dressing a bit to make it a little more herb-y and a little more lemon-y and they improved the quality of their lettuces, it'd go a long way.  Our entrees really shined. The shish tawouk was spicy (!) and delicious. The chicken shawarma was done perfectly. Nice portion sizes. If I was rating the entrees alone, both the tawouk and the shawarma are 4 star dishes.  Despite our delicious chicken entrees, yummy shish tawouk just doesn't make up for a 2 1/2 hour meal, average salad, and really bad pita. If the long wait times wouldn't have been a factor, this would have been a 3 star review.   P.S. If you have dietary restrictions, I'd highly recommend Fattoush. The have gluten free pita as well as well as many other gluten free and/or vegan options. You may have to put up with crazy slow service, but you will have a menu full of options. P.P.S.

First the service. It took 20 minutes to get an order of tea and that was after a 10 minute wait to get a waiter over to our table. We had to remind the waiter of our orders and when they would be ready. 3 times we had them bring over food that we hadn't even ordered. The staff was running around like chickens with there heads cut off and it made for a horrible ambiance. We were not the only table with terrible service, 2 other tables were complaining too.  Next the food. Worst hummus I have had in a while. If you can't get hummus right at a Lebanese place then you have already started out on the wrong foot. Most of these reviewers haven't eaten real Lebanese food before so that's why the ratings are so disproportionately high. The meats were tasteless and poor quality cuts of meat. Fattoush salad was bland. Maybe people rave because the place is gluten free but most Lebanese food is gluten free (its meat and salad!!!) I would never recommend going here.

Update: just read they hired a new chef so hopefully they are working out the kinks.   Update 2:  I was emailed about some unfortunate events regarding the closing and reorganizing of the restaurant.  Along with what they are doing to keep the fattoush we remember and make it better.  Sounds like they are working hard and I will give it another shot in a month.  Appreciate the heads up.",0.9253,0.8,0.13,0.07,0.6308585858585859

This has been one of few middle eastern restaurants which has great tasting food in my view. Having said that the restaurant should put up a sign saying they wont accept any new guests after certain time cause I had a very bad experience because of this, I believe the owner of the place just wanted to get rid of us just around the time when his place about to be closed first he would come and try to pick up plates when we were still eating, he also gave us the check as soon as he realized we had almost finished and never asked us if wanted to eat desert.

Unfortunately, it's overpriced.  We came with a large group and ended up paying about $25 apiece for apps and mains (no drinks- remember, it's BYOB!) While tasty, the food was a little disappointing. There was little variety in each dish- that is to say, you got meat and rice, with no veggies (although you do receive a small salad before your meal). We also got some vegetarian maza before our meal- $18 for three vegetarian selections?! Sorry, but the next time I consider paying twenty bones for chickpeas and lentils you need to direct me to the nearest grocery store and set me straight.

Lebanese food itself is comfort food there's nothing fancy about it. Lebanese food strength lies in their mezas and their chefs take pride in the flavors and preparation of their mezas, which this place lacked. the owner of the restaurant will push that you purchase their over priced shwarmas and for the untrained in this style of cuisine will indeed fall into making a mediocre purchase, shwarma itself is a corner street dish, the portion they have is quite fulfilling but for its humble origin, flavor and preparation does not justify the $16 price tag, skip the purchase altogether. the kalayeh was abysmal in it preparation and the taste of the meat was gamy the sauce tasted more like day old marinara sauce than the actual tahina which it boasted. the fattoush itself was boring and lack the explosion of citrus flavors a home made fattoush prepped the real Lebanese way. there is only one place on earth i would eat a real tabouleh and its definitely not here. the hommous was the kind served in a cheap, ready made in a jar, it lacked body and the flavor of the olive oil was not present, i mean how can u go wrong with chickpeas and olive oil. please don't kid yourself with this place until or associate it with authentic Lebanese cuisine until you've experience what a real Lebanese meal is like",0.9862,0.829,0.131,0.039,0.45077160493827156

The pita bread wasn't the best; store bought room temp but the appetizers will bring us back to try an entree. We were just too full!",0.9584,0.668,0.287,0.044,0.6958333333333333
2007-09-24,3.0,"The namesake Fattoush salad is the best reason to go here. All the other Middle Eastern dishes you can find just as good elsewhere.  My biggest complaint is the service. Our waiter was a young man who either didn't speak English, or was stoned as hell. Sorry but how many times do you have to ask for more pita bread? We never did get it.",-0.7218,0.793,0.062,0.145,0.3875
2007-05-20,3.0,"Confirmed: beautiful waitresses.   The namesake Fattoush salad of tiny chopped up tomatoes and other vegetables dusted in seasonings and oil was pretty good.  The vegetarian entrees were 15 bones for just Hummus or Falafel etc. so instead of eating that much of one thing I got the 3 Maza, so I could pick and choose.  The artichokes were great and the falafel was one of the better ones I've had.  The atmosphere was more of a quieter, small restaurant; it is BYOB but does not seem like as festive of a restaurant.  It feels too casual for a special date.  You can stay as long as you like; they were in no hurry to force the bill on you.  Did I mention the cute waitress has an accent?",0.9395,0.768,0.174,0.057,0.6442063492063492
2007-01-05,2.0,"If you live too far from Kedzie, Fattoush may be an option, but for my dollar, I will head north. Fattoush's food is fine. Nothing wrong with it, but for the price, you can do better. The Spinach Pie was good, nice lemon and spinach flavor on phyllo, but again pricey for the food quality and style. The restaurant was barren when we went and we assumed that the word had spread.",0.8573,0.788,0.162,0.05,0.7142857142857143
2006-11-10,4.0,"I'm starting to love Lebanon after Fattoush, Maza, and all their hot women that they seem to have. I recommend the chicken shwarma, chicken kabobs, and one another meat in the big combo platter they offer. You also get one appetizer and a small side salad with that order, so you won't be going home hungry!   Don't do what I did and order the Fattoush salad with the combo. It's not that it's a bad salad (it's excellent), it's just that you already get a small side salad. Your appetizer choice is probably better spent on something else.",0.9143,0.875,0.125,0.0,0.5513888888888889
2006-10-10,2.0,"This place looks like it may be good, but I don't know first hand.  Restaurant Owners, pay attention:  If you're going to close your restaurant randomly on a whim, at least update your website to reflect this whim.  If you don't, you'll have some pissed off customers - especially those that make plans to meet a group of people at your place only to arrive to find it closed.  Maybe I'll try it again some time, maybe I won't.",-0.8459,0.826,0.044,0.13,0.5619047619047619

2005-09-28,4.0,Great Middle Eastern Food! The inside is very cute with pictures of different places around Lebanon and they play Arabic music. The food is fantastic and the person that owns the place also cooks all of the food. This is a BYOB establishment which is pretty nice as well.,0.9674,0.653,0.347,0.0,0.75
