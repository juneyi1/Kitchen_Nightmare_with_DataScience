2006-11-19,3.0,"(Update:  I went back, without my stomach flu, and can now officially vouch for the chopped and the spinach salads.) My friends I was with said the chopped salad was great.  Unfortunately I had a stomach flu and was watching them eat it.  We also had one thumbs up for the lamb chop.  The staff was very sweet and brought me hot water with lemon.    I am spoiled by San Francisco - we don't really go out to eat at the mall - so the ambiance did not really do it for me.  It did seem like a great place to take a group or kids.",0.9587,0.789,0.19,0.021,0.5743750000000001
