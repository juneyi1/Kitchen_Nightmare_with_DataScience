Most of the dishes were under $10.  The food was good, you cant beat it for the price. It's American dishes spruced up nicely. The waitress was a bit off, one of my friends got a dish she never ordered.

2007-02-20,4.0,"BRUNCH:  Del Toro is my new GO-TO place for the greatest laid-back Sunday brunch.   A super-surprising, morning meal.  Well done, Wicker Park. Sit at the bar solo (and crossword-puzzled) or nuzzled by buddies to munch with Del Toro's brilliant brunch-only bartender Skylar; he is a true gem for this place!   The 'Del Toro Bloody Mary' is TRULY crazy-tasty!   The other specialty brunch drinks are simply deee-he-he-licious, nice Mimosa varieties, no doubt. Mark my words:  I LOVE their food.  Without fail, a smart and gorgeous combination of flavors and textures.   TOP PICKS: Huevos Segovia...amazing Spanish Croissant...yes  Smokey Tomato Ancho Chili Chilaquiles...yum Must-mention:  This is the most reasonable brunch menu for such an upper-tier ""hot spot"" restaurant.  For the brunch selections offered at Del Toro, you ! absolutely ! CANNOT beat these prices.   Would go five-star, but... 1. Hot and fresh-tasting potatoes are hit-or-miss.   2. Dining next to heavy smokers is still totally gross.   3.

Besides the potatos, the rest of the menu is delicious, the decor is fabulous, the crowd is hot, and the servers are fun. Edited 4/10: SHUT UP!  Del Toro closed??  NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!

2007-01-31,5.0,Definitely the best tapas restaurant I have been to in Chicago. I went with a big group of friends on a Saturday night and we all really enjoyed it! Everything we ordered was delicious and we ordered a lot! All of the dishes are very gourmet and much better than some of the traditional tapas you get at places like Cafe Ba Ba Reeba and Cafe Iberico. Try the butternut squash- it does not disappoint. The atmosphere was great too- kinda funky yet really warm and welcoming and the staff is really nice. And it's not even expensive. I highly recommend Del Toro.,0.9904,0.664,0.327,0.009,0.5953846153846154
2007-01-25,3.0,"I really enjoy tapas places, and I had high expectations for Del Toro.  They sat us on time, the service was good, and the prices seemed reasonable enough.  The sangria was ok - not too fruity, which was good.   The food tasted great, but it is not your regular Spanish tapas preparation, and the servings are REALLY SMALL.  Especially if you're used to Cafe Ba-ba-reeba or Emilio's or the like.  My favorite dish was the Spanish bruschetta with the manchego cheese, mushrooms and truffle oil.  Delicious!   Overall, everything was good, but I was really not full at the end of dinner - to the point where I ordered my own dessert just to try and fill up!  Good experience, but next time I think I will go somewhere where the food is a little more substantial...",0.9832,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5137792642140468

2007-01-13,4.0,"Update!  1/29/2007 - I didn't think I would be back here so soon, but I got a call on Saturday to meet friends here.  So...off we go!  I wanted to see if the food/service was as good without my friend there.  Well, he was the one that invited me...but I figured that I should still confirm the food.  Tapas at Del Toro = ALL GOOD.  Can't really go wrong...even the beets...yes the beets are delicious.  And the cauliflower?  Who in their right mind gets cauliflower?  Well, we did and it was very good too.  However here's the prob on my last visit:  The friggin' wait.  We had an 8:30 and didn't sit until 10:10.  The guests at the table we were waiting for were one hour late themselves...and stayed even longer.  How can that happen?!?  How can a place allow a table to show up an hour late, then make the next party wait almost 2 hours for the table?  LAME (Original Review)  This was our New Year's Eve restaurant, and we decided to stay the whole night.  My friend had a connection with this restaurant, so this review may be a bit skewed.  We had excellent service, had a great time, but it was definitely very loud.  With 11 of us at a table, we just decided to focus on the two people sitting in front of us for any conversation.  So, I recommend the scallops with the truffle oil on the side of the plate.  Make sure you dip the scallops in the sauce.  I am definitely glad my friend was there with us, since we got great service, food, and had an excellent time. I don't know how, but our bill was like $50/person including an extra few bottles of wine.  I'm sure they hooked us up.

One gripe:  I seriously think there is some sort of ketchup shortage there because both times we went for brunch, they brought us (a table of 4) about a tablespoon of ketchup for the entire table.  When we asked for more, it never came.

2006-10-16,4.0,"Food/Service  This Wicker Park tapas spot in the former venue that hosted Mod is a welcome addition to the neighborhood. While it has some of your standard tapas menu items like patatas bravas and grilled calamari, it definitely veers in other more unique directions with items like pumpkin and goat cheese croquettas, rioja braised veal and duck confit.  When I visited, the special duck empanada piqued my interests but wasn't as exciting as I had hoped. The texture of the empanada was fine and the clove and cardamom flavors were interesting but the combination was nothing memorable. On the other hand, the grilled bread rubbed with garlic and tomato and then seasoned with olive oil and sea salt was excellent. Served with three different tapenades including a very green pesto one, this is a filling and necessary dish. It is necessary because the complimentary bread which is provided at many tapas restaurants is not offered at Del Toro. This same grilled bread is also served with the Serrano ham and manchego cheese plate which was, as expected, very good. The butternut squash cracker is served with a wafer tucked inside a subtle but flavorful butternut squash puree that has an indentation of rosemary flavored oil in the center that gives the dish a nice twist. This was one of the more interesting things we tried and was quite good. The braised octopus and chickpea salad was very good and flavorful and the steamed mussels with garlic, chilies and Serrano ham were decent but nothing special. They have some interesting types of sangria with the fig sangria being a welcome change to the common sangrias I have tried which can become a bit boring. There is also an extensive wine list.  For brunch, I tried my friend's wood grilled skirt steak with eggs and it was unbelievable. The steak was 'melt in your mouth' tender and whatever it was marinated in was extremely flavorful. Next time I go to Del Toro, I am definitely ordering something from their menu with skirt steak in it and I would highly suggest you do the same. I ordered the eggs flamenco which is two over easy eggs with chorizo, onions, tomatoes and peppers baked into the eggs. It was very good although the patatas bravas served as a side was a bit greasy and not as good as I would have hoped. There was a nice fruit salad also served as a side. Del Toro also has a nice variety of interesting mimosas on the brunch menu.  The service was solid during my dinner visit. I am not sure if the servers had a rough Saturday night or what but I would have to describe the servers as aloof and the service as slow when I was there for brunch. I was with a party of 14 but the restaurant was not even half full and it took longer than I would expect for our food to come out. Then again, I was hoping not to miss any of the Bears game and probably wasn't as patient as I could have been.  Atmosphere  As you approach the restaurant walking up Damen Avenue, the words Del Toro appear vertically on a subtle wood sign. The entrance has candles in the windows which make the restaurant appear to be very enticing. Chic if you will. When you enter, you realize that the appetizers on the outside are just an indication of the atmosphere inside. There is a cool bar up front and an even cooler lounge area to sit in and relax with a drink. Del Toro has a lounge like feel to it that serves the 'just drinks' crowd in addition to the dinner crowd. The restaurant has a great flow to it with red and black mosaic tiling on the walls with a few subtle chili pepper designs integrated into the design. The back of the restaurant has a raised area with larger tables that is an excellent place to have a large, somewhat private dinner party.  Value  We had 6 tapas and 2 drinks for $58 plus tip. We got a lot of food for this price. While definitely not a bargain, the prices are about what I would expect given the area the restaurant is in and the atmosphere inside. These kinds of things are, many times, reflected in the price. In any case, I definitely left full and satisfied and didn't feel as if I overpaid for my meal. The prices of the brunch dishes were common ranging from $6-11 dollars.  Other  The bathroom is strategically placed near the front entrance in the vicinity of the lounge like seating area in the front of the restaurant. As a result, it interferes with people's meals and conversations as little as possible. The bathrooms are unisex and fashionable like the rest of the restaurant. This restaurant definitely leans towards the trendy side but that doesn't make it much different from a host of other places within walking distance on Division Street or in the immediate surrounding area. Del Toro does have a rather extensive late night menu making this a great place for a late night nibble.",0.9994,0.812,0.177,0.011,0.541910934744268

My father has dined at Del Toro three times before I went with him my mother and a few family friends.  I walk in and Immediately I was visually stunned with the decor. Little hints of flavor everywhere.. just as another diner mentioned, it took me back to the Gaudi park in Barcelona, and Del Toro didn't stop there. Each dish is in a traditional Tapas style that reminded me of an upscale bar/lounge in barcelona that I stopped in for lunch one day and have yet to find a local treat to resort to, until now.  Course after course, the cuisine ranged from traditional treats to modern creations that worked magically with the wine. Sardines with avocado was great, Squid stuffed with homemade chorizo, and of course the hot chocolate with homemade churros.. I think we ordered just about everything on the menu, as we always do, and I was never disappointed.  Now, me and my father are wine fanatics, and I actually saw wines that we have on our wine list as well, so it was great to see that they know what they are doing with wine. Prices were spot on as well. The food I was told  after the meal, has been better on previous visits, maybe because the head chef was not in (Sunday) but to me as it was my first time, was defiantly worth putting it on my A-list for Spanish cuisine in Chicago, hence my rating.
