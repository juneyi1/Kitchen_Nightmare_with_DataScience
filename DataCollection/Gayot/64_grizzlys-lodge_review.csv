2008-10-29,4.0,"Restaurant where I once ate an alligator - m4m - 26 (North Center) Date: 2008-10-29, 2:11PM CDT You: Delightfully tacky yet authentically rugged, going to you I felt like I was eating in rural North Dakota (so, I guess more accurately, North Dakota). I had eaten various wild game before but at different places all over the country. Never before had I seen a place where ostrich, bear, buffalo and alligator flesh were cooked all with the same flame. When dining here I kept my eye on the door, always waiting for Grizzly Adams or Crocodile Dundee to stop in and grab a beer. Me: Worked a half block away for about a year during which I made the occasional visit. You enchanted me each time. After moving a few blocks away at the beginning of last spring, I came to you only to find a locked door filled with various eviction notices and a smattering of utility shut-off postings. Are you in financial trouble? Is there something I can do to help? What can I do to get you back? Are we a case of awful timing? Were we never truly meant to be? * Location: North Center * it's NOT ok to contact this poster with services or other commercial interests This is a good place to go if... you have access to a time machine.",-0.752,0.808,0.086,0.105,0.38044871794871793
2007-12-05,5.0,"Lodge ambience rocks!! . . . All the menu items are awesome(if they are in stock).  Sometimes I've been turned down twice or thrice when I order something.  But that has not made me give up my passion for Game meat. Alligator fries, Wild Boar ravioli, ostrich burger, and more more.  What else you need.  They got a good collection of food and drinks.  Once upon a time, used to be my neck of the woods, playing NTN, with the reggies.  I still love to stopby whenever I can. :-) Reservation not needed. Wouldn't hurt to call before you go, if there is specialty meat you want to order.  Enjoy treating your taste buds, and have fun.",0.9599,0.801,0.181,0.019,0.498888888888889
2007-11-09,2.0,"Meh.  Ok so you can get some 'off the beaten path' pub grub stuff to eat here.  Not worth it.  It's like Monk's Pub with emu meat.  The service was really not good, slow and inattentive.  Wasn't worth the trip.",0.1817,0.683,0.176,0.141,0.34
2007-08-28,2.0,"I was pretty disappointed by this place. A group of us went here for my friend's birthday. They seemed to be out of EVERYTHING. Seriously about 4 times the waiter had to come tells us that they were out of something we ordered. I thought we were on some kind of candid TV show or something. It was ridiculous.  I'm not a big meat person, especially anything that isn't chicken breast, steak, or hamburger so I ordered their garlic lemon chicken which was so bland I could barely detect any lemon or garlic. We had some appetizers too which were ok but nothing out of the ordinary.  I gave it 2 stars because our server was really friendly. I felt bad that he had to keep telling us he was out of everything and he gave us some free birthday booze so that was nice. I don't plan on returning though.",0.8266,0.828,0.107,0.065,0.7231481481481481

2007-02-11,1.0,"I had been meaning to go to Grizzly's Lodge ever since I moved back to Chicago.  I finally went there this past Saturday and I have to say, Grizzly's Lodge sucks!  We were going to go to Martyr's to see a few bands play, eat dinner, and drink the night away but we got there too late to get a table and we were pretty hungry so we went across the street to Grizzly's Lodge.  I wouldn't expect a place that looks like a northwoods cabin to have an extensive vegetarian menu, but I figured that they would surely have something for me to eat.  I went with my girlfriend, who is also a vegetarian, and a friend of ours who is a meat eater.   When we went in, there were only about 4 people in the place.  We were seated right away and the waitress told us that they were out of about 15 things.  Most of the wild game was not available, the tater tots were not available, and about half of their beers were out of stock as well (we went on a Saturday night. . .she said that ""they ate and drank everything we had last night"").  I looked at the menu and saw that they had two pasta dishes that were meatless.  We each ordered the separate pasta dishes and our friend had the hot wings.  We also ordered an onion blossom appetizer.   The appetizer arrived promptly and it was OK.  The pasta dishes were downright insulting.  My dish, described as ""spiral pasta with a zesty marinara sauce tossed with sauteed fresh tomatoes and mushrooms"".  What I received was a can of Hunts tomato sauce dumped over a handful of rotini pasta with some raw tomato chunks and raw mushroom slices thrown on top.  The spaghetti dish that my girlfriend ordered was exactly the same but it contained egg noodles.  The most insulting part is that they charged us $10 for each pasta dish.  I could have gone to the Olive garden, which isn't exactly gourmet dining, and paid less for food that is far superior in quality. When the waitress came by, she noticed that we hadn't really eaten much of the pasta.  She asked ""how's the food?""  Our friend replied, ""the wings are good but that pasta is terrible!""  The waitress quickly defended the food by stating ""well, we are more of a meat kind of place.""  I went on to inquire as to why they charged $10 for such horrible food and she quickly got angry with us and stormed away.  We paid the bill and took off as quickly as we could as it had become obvious that we hadn't made any friends at Grizzly's Lodge.   I wouldn't have been as angry if the waitress had offered to take the pasta off of the bill, or even one of the pasta dishes off of the bill.  I probably won't ever go back here. . .even if I am going just to drink.  I don't believe in giving my money to establishments that blatantly rip off their patrons and that is exactly what Grizzly's Lodge is doing.",0.8764,0.848,0.084,0.068,0.5271202686202686
2006-12-17,1.0,"I'd been meaning to try this place for years - heard great things about it, and was intrigued by the exotic meats offered. What a disappointment.  We were seated promptly upon entering (there were probably about 10 other people in the entire bar/restaurant when we got there, around 6 PM on a Saturday). However, after being shown to our seats, it took at least fifteen minutes before our waitress came by to even take our drink order. Of course, by this time, we were ready to order our food. My companion chose the burger with Swiss cheese and mushrooms, and was then informed that ""we are out of Swiss cheese and mushrooms"". She was then told that they were also out of Tater Tots. Already, this was not shaping up well. I had selected the ""Mixed Grill"", which looked to be a fair sampling of the wild game offered by this restaurant - a mix of elk steak, wild board, and quail. Alas, it was not to be. ""We're out of the Mixed Grill tonight. In fact, we're out of most of our wild game."" This was unacceptable. The wild game offerings are what this restaurant was supposedly known for, and they were OUT of them, early in the evening on a SATURDAY? I ended up ordering the ribs, although I was dubious.  There's not much more to say about this place beyond the following: My soup was lukewarm and tasted as if it were from a can. The burger my fiancee ordered was room temperature and unremarkable. I only ate two of the ribs I ordered, as the sauce was terrible, and the meat tasted funny. I will say this - our server did take the ribs off of the bill, after seeing that I did not eat them. Regardless, the service was poor (the sole waitress was clearly overwhelmed), the food was sub-par, and the entire environment felt dirty. I will never go back to this restaurant again, and I feel that I must actively warn people against it.",-0.6613,0.884,0.049,0.067,0.5283854166666668
2006-12-13,4.0,"Wild Game.  This is why I go here.  Taste the blood of wild beasts that were shot down for my eating pleasure.  Honestly, I had never had game before and wanted to try it.  The alligator tail appetizer is a must every time.  I had a elk/quail combo the first time.  The quail was great, but the elk was... well maybe the elk was too adventurous for me.  The game entrees are a bit pricey too.   Since then, I have gotten the burgers.  They offer venison, buffalo, and ostrich burgers- all good and come with the option of tater tots, which I enjoy.  I hear the wild boar is good ad I plan to get it next time.   They have some nice heads on the walls as well. If you want game, this is really one of your only options, so give it a try.  I have only really been here to eat so I cannot comment on its qualities as a bar.",0.9841,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.5272486772486773
2006-04-15,1.0,Awful... the worst restaurant we've ever eaten at.  My veggies weren't fresh and my chicken was bland and dry.  The restaurant had nothing going for it.  We had sour stomachs shortly after leaving.  Stay away!,-0.7472,0.839,0.0,0.161,0.6604166666666665
2006-04-08,1.0,"I had high hopes for this place since I like the ""Northern Woodsy"" feel--just like being in a rustic log cabin in Northern MN or WI. We went on Friday night for the ""special $7.95 all-you-can-eat fish fry."" The place is smaller so it was fairly crowded, but we were still able to get seated right away. The decor is interesting: northern cabin meets the Chicago Cubs.. on every screen. Kind of different for it to be a sportsbar when it clearly is trying to be ""Cabin-like."" So I was super excited when I saw that they had $1 drafts of Point Beer... what a deal! So we ordered a round and ordered a round of the fish fry deals. The beer took awhile. The fish took awhile. We sat there... and sat there... waiting for the waiter to come back to our table. We kept on watching him go to another table, go to the kitchen, come back out to another table, go back to the kitchen... This went on for a good 45 minutes. By this time we wanted another round of beer AND one of us wanted more fish. So one of my dining companions finally went up to the bar and talked to the waiter, saying we wanted to order more. He said that he would be right there to get our order. About 15 minutes go by, nothing. He finally comes over (we had to flag him down again) and apologizes for the wait and says that he will be right back. We say, we want the check! Took him another 5 minutes for that! We got there at around 7:30 pm.. left at around 9:45. Had only 1 round of beer, wanted more. Had only 1 small plate of fish fry each, wanted more. Another table that had bad service said to us, ""If I were you, I would just leave..."" I think that is what they did. It would be one thing if we were a table of 10: we were a table of 3. It would be one thing if he had all the tables: he had maybe 8, tops... the place isn't huge. The service was just BAD! And honestly, the fish fry was not much better than getting those frozen fish fillets and frying them yourself. And the fries weren't good either. The only redeeming thing was the cheap beer... and we couldn't even get more than one of those!",0.972,0.867,0.095,0.037,0.5537680375180375
2006-01-24,3.0,"This place has a killer homemade bloody mary mix- worth the trip just for that, but the food is average even though the menu has exotic choices.
