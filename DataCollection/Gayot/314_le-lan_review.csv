Grapefruit salad with so many ingredients and toppings there was no sense of freshness or vibrancy to the dish--Duck dumplings with such a heavy doughy texture and -again, so many flavors added as ""toppings"" the flavor of the main ingredients in the dish were unclear--HOWEVER these were edible--, the arctic char with english peas sounded lovely, it was served 1/2 raw, not my request and not the way it was planned, the accompanying bean cakes were so fishy and sour-- one bite was all I could take, and the brown rice seemed stale and was tasteless.

I stated with the seasonal butternut squash soup but I am still dreaming about their tofu steak marinated in truffle oil served with quinoa and seasonal vegetables. It's a dish even meatatarian would love- I mean who doesn't love anything in truffle oil! The cocktails were unique and very tasty. I wish every bar offered a blood orange side car!

The electic ambiance provided the perfect backdrop for what I can only describe now as a fantastic meal. Immediately we were treated to an appertif that I never did really get the right name of.

My scallops were tremendous, and they were lying atop this savory tomato couscous that I adored. I knew I would eat every bite no matter how full I got!

This is a real shame because this is one of the better taste and service experiences in town.

My litmus test is very simple: my fiancee and I can cook pretty well and eat most any type of cuisine, so if I can replicate the flavors and quality in my kitchen, no amount of ambiance or even service can overcome that problem. With the exception of a highly replicable hangar steak (Which unfortunately was the focus of the restaurant week menu), this is NOT the case for Le Lan.  These are some of the most subtle, original flavors that you will find in chicago.

Wine:  My friend ordered a glass of wine at the bar and the bartender happened to pick up an almost empty bottle of it.  Well, even a non-wine drinker would know to open a fresh bottle and not to pour that to even your worst enemy, but this dude proceeded to pour all of the leftover into her glass and then opened a fresh bottle and poured a little from there.  They charge you a pretty penny for a glass, but fill your glass with garbage?  Oh, no you didn't.  So far Le Lan is starting off at 4 stars. Appetizers: Four of us ordered the butternut squash soup and it turned out pretty good.  Actually, to be honest, I thought it was a tad too sour, but others liked the tartness.  My friend ordered the soba noodles, which were surprisingly good.  Soba as an appetizer?  It works and had a nice kick to it.  We're still at 4 stars. Entree:  I ordered the Thai-chili misteak cooked medium.  It came out raw.  Rare would've been plausible, but raw?  So I sent it back (which I've only done maybe twice in my life), waited 10 minutes, received the now ""medium"" misteak, and took a bite.  I like flavorful food, but the only flavor I was tasting was sodium.  I could literally feel my blood pressure rising throughout the meal.  Le Lan, you just lost a star. Dessert:  We had to wait 30 minutes from the time they took away our entree plates to when they set down our desserts.  Oh the anticipation!!  I was excited for the chocolately lava flow from my molten chocolate cake, but when carved out my first piece.. NO FLOW!   Don't worry, Mari.  Try digging more towards the center and maybe that'll do the trick.  Ok, so I dig towards the center and...

Chris, our waiter, was one of the rudest, snippiest and most inconsiderate servers I have ever had.

2009-01-31,4.0,"I was invited by a friend to have dinner with her, her friend and several of her friends. Hmmm so wait, its me, maybe one other guy and several women. Yeah... I think I can roll with that.  I was a little behind, but fortunately when I had arrived I had gotten there the group had just sat down. I took a momentary glance around, nice slim space, dark oaks, white linens, things that shimmer and shine and that just made things look just fine. Shortly after ordering a malbec, (my stand by red wine), which got rave reviews by others as well as myself. I was then moved down the table in to the thick of things, oh the terrible trials and tribulations I must endure. Many people were ordering the two course special, (a main and a dessert for $20.09), I opted not since I wasn't feeling too excited about the choices, so I opted to start with the orange Hokkaido squash soup and then the lemongrass poached chicken.  We were all engrossed in sharing stories, food and wine knowledge and tips, favorite places, when the appetizers and first courses came. To be honest, I have no idea what the heck everyone else ordered. It was like a savory cinnamon roll, (without the cinnamon), made with the soft sticky steamed dough and a spicy slightly sweet/sour sauce on the side. (Check out that alliteration!!) The ""rolls"" themselves were more ""meh"" but dipped in the sauce and the combination exploded in a peppery flash with a sweet middle and heated end. Good, but sad to see the ""rolls"" on their own were eh. My soup on the other hand seemed like a combination of the sultry smoothness of a squash soup and the citrus, ginger and other flavor notes of a Tom Yum. We all shared a taste of each others, some noting the cumin, perhaps turmeric? Then came my poached chicken. Oh hell's belles, it was really good. I will say I was slightly surprised by the slight dryness of the chicken, but the green curry, rice noodles and yu choy certainly helped me get in to the clean plate club. The dim heat of the curry coupled with the flavors underneath gave the slight Thai flavorings off, but most off all, complemented the twinge of sweet and lemon flavor of the chicken. I got to try the curry trout and the braised beef short rib as well. The true topper of the trout was the crispy skin which made a nice textural contrast and well.. who doesn't like some crispy skin? Okay.. maybe not George Hamilton. The braised beef was done well, tender, but not too tender and simply came out looking beautiful.  Since I was out with several beautiful ladies, dessert wasn't so much on my mind, but I was lucky enough to share some lovely molten chocolate cake with cardamom ice cream. It was hard to detract my eyes tonight, but when some sweet luscious chocolate oozes out of the center of a decadent chocolate cake, how can I not take notice? Small, rich and perfect for sharing a small nosh or two with someone and not feel like I over indulged.  Our server Michael was great and fairly spot on about suggestions and offering his opinions on dishes and wines, Our table laughed, took several photos, (why do I have a sneaking suspicion I am in someone's Facebook pictures now?), joked, shared stories and had a great time. I was just happy to have been invited. This is great place for a date, a special night out, but would also not a bad place for a small gathering either.

I started with the Thai coconut soup....amazing flavors and small olive oil poached shrimp cooked to perfection.  I think I could have eaten a quart of that soup.  SO good!   My main was the lamb loin & lamb leg combo.  The loin was a perfect medium rare & looked beautiful (I love lamb and yes I think it can be beautiful) :)  The leg was braised with lots of spices and was accompanied with Yukon potatoes.  Normally I don't eat everything on my plate, but I just could not stop eating this!   Then came dessert.  I was pretty surprised to see only 4 options, plus a cheese plate.  I got the fresh peach & blueberry crumble with blueberry ice cream.  When it arrived, it wasn't anything I expected visually.  It looked rustic but sooo good.  It had a lot of fresh mint that was a bit much, however, everything tasted so fresh.  This is a great summer dessert! I also want to recommend the cocktail they call ""sangria"".  It was a sake base and included other liquors & fresh fruit.  Yum!   Love this place!  Make a reservation now :)",0.9985,0.661,0.339,0.0,0.6359523809523809

The decor is simply beautiful.  Very enticing and romantic.  Although, my friend and I could not get over the overwhelming scent of men's cologne.  We wondered if it was possibly a scent the restaurant had chosen or an over eager patron?  It was hard to tell, but either way, that smell changed the way our food tasted..it was that strong.  :( We shared two appetizers to start.  A chicken and mushroom dumpling and a tomato salad.  Both were good but not amazing. Our server brought over another appetizer, compliments of the chef, which was some sort of seafood plate.  Unfortunately, neither of us eat seafood so we had to break it to him.  We were grateful anyway, but sent it back with him.   For dinner I had a chicken breast over risotto and my friend had pork, also over risotto.  Both were flavorful and well prepared..but again, nothing crave-worthy.  We did order a side of green beans which were downright amazing.  Sad that this was the best part of the meal. Desert:  I had a Bavarian chocolate dish while my friend had a berry compote of some sort.  Both were pretty tasty.

2008-07-21,5.0,"I truly rate this about 4 1/2 stars.  I took my wife here for her birthday and was very impressed. For an appetizer, we shared the Wild Mushroom and Chicken dumplings with Vermicelli Noodles, Hen of the Wood Mushrooms and Parmesan Cheese.  The great thing about this dish was that no single ingredient dominated in this dish.  The Parmesan was not there in every bite and came as a nice contrast when you got it.  It's nice to see a dish change as you eat it. We also shared Thai Coconut Soup.  The sweetness of the coconut milk is the dominant flavor in this dish but there are number of flavor and texture changes waiting for you as you enjoy this.  For me, it was the little bits of tart citrus (lime, I believe but won't swear to) that you would come across as you ate it that I enjoyed the most.  My wife and I could have made a meal out of the soup alone. My wife had the Wagyu Beef with Mustard Greens and Pork Belly Won Tons.  I don't remember all of the different flavor accents that accompanied the dish but the Mustard Greens were done in a Wagyu Beef Demi-Glace that gave the greens a wonderful flavor that varied between sweet, a little tart and smokey.  It is what we both found most striking about the dish.  The beef was a perfect flavor and consistency. I had the lamb loin and leg that was done in green and red curries.  It was very good but had one minor flaw.  I felt the accompanying potatoes in the red curry had a very firm, dry consistency that I did not enjoy.  I would have rather they used something like a Yukon Gold even if it did not fit with the ethnicity of the cuisine.  Beyond that, the curries were very flavorful and the meat was done perfectly. For desert, we had the Spiced Chocolate Bavarian with Caramel Rice Crispies.  The Bavarian had a wonderfully rich flavor that finished with just the slightest hint of curry.  The Rice Crispies actually provided a nice change in texture in addition to cherries and Kumquats which added a nice tart contrast to the desert. My wife ended up with a free Creme Brulee for her birthday which was a nice touch. Service-wise, it is a little hard for me to rate as we got there at opening and were in a much less than full restaurant so it really wasn't a pressure situation.  That being said, service was just about right.  The waitress was helpful in picking out a nice bottle of wine and managed to avoid hovering over us even though the restaurant was mostly empty at that time.  The dishes were spaced perfectly in their delivery and not piled on top of each other which is my single biggest gripe with most restaurants. Once again, I give this 4 1/2 stars with the 1/2 star deduction coming because of the potato element in my meal.",0.9984,0.781,0.19,0.029,0.5937003968253969

2008-04-01,4.0,"This Asian-French hybrid located in River North delivers on unique offerings for both lunch and dinner.  Most recently I was there for dinner and we had a great evening. The interior of the restaurant is lovely.  While not overly large, the bamboo and green tile lend a calming air to the space.  And on the back wall, the dragon mural draws the eye to it.  Since it is one large room with a bar- it can get noisy in here although on our last visit, it was about half full and the noise was at a normal level. Once seated, you are presented with these soft rolls with hoisin glaze.  Careful- they keep bringing them and you don't want to fill up on bread with the items they have on the menu for you to savor and enjoy.  Put the bread down, now! We usually try a wide range of salads and appetizers.  My friend likes beets so we tried the goat cheese and spinach salad with beets.  Very interesting combination of flavors. It didn't make me change my opinion on beets but it was good!   For appetizers, we went with the wild mushroom and chicken dumplings and beef carpaccio.  Both were delicious! For our entrees- we tried the short ribs served with mushrooms and rice and the rainbow trout served with couscous.  Very good- although I think the short ribs were the overall winner- full of flavor and so tender!  For dessert, we split the banana chocolate bread pudding (need I say more?).  I think I dream about that dessert! The wine list is interesting as it has a number of more obscure wines on it.  The servers are great, though, about helping find a wine that is in your price range and fits your taste. Service is attentive without being overly assertive and on the night we were there- the owner was there and he stopped by to say hi.  A nice touch, I thought.

2008-03-17,4.0,"I went here for a special date and was satisfied with the decor and food. As a Chicago newcomer, Le Lan was my first foray into fine dining in the city so I was a bit apprehensive. Would Le Lan live up to my high expectations after eating at great restaurants in my hometown, San Francisco? It sure did!  When we first arrived, I noted how busy the place was. Also, the guests that night seemed to be a bit older. We, as two twenty-somethings, appeared to be the youngest in the room! Maybe the high prices keep the younger demographic away? Who knows. We made a reservation so we were seated immediately. Thankfully we were seated against a wall so we had one less neighboring table to worry about (it's quite tight and is a bit hard to move around). We ordered a bottle of wine - Leitz Reisling - which we ended up loving so much that we seek it out in every wine store we visit.  My boyfriend had the lamb, which he enjoyed very much. It was very soft and juicy. You could see the flavoring ooze out. It also came with orzo, whose delicate nature matched the lamb well. I had the Walleye Pike, which was also good. However, I had some issues with the basil gnocchi. The flavor tasted a bit odd, and it didn't help that it was served with pea puree. It reminded me of sophisticated baby food. The restaurant seemed to be more of a Vietnamese inspired French restaurant than an equal fusion of the two. And I think that's being very generous. I couldn't really tell the Asian influence in the food (besides in the spring roll appetizers). Oh well. The food was good. Guess that's all that matters!",0.9891,0.82,0.152,0.028,0.4577926587301586

Unlike other reviewers, I loved the Grouper in the red Thai curry sauce and fingerling potatoes and my husband had trout with crispy skin that we adored as well.  Some other items that stood out:  Young Thai Coconut Soup, Pork Belly & Pink Shrimp Spring Roll, the two specials of the day Lemongrass chicken & Dover scallops, the cheese tasting and the deserts; even the carpaccio was really nice. I will say that the steamed sticky buns with orange hoisin sauce were nothing to write home about and it was REALLY expensive, but we had such a great evening and the food really was good, that we will go back.",0.9899,0.845,0.143,0.012,0.5088010204081632

Our dining experience was really inconsistent....  For starters the restaurant itself is very pretty. Simple and chic with exposed brick, hardwood and beautiful Oriental accents. The tables are set impeccably and the service was very good.  We started with an amuse bouche of asian sticky buns with an orange hoisin dipping sauce. Not bad, but not an exciting palate starter by any means... kind of innocuous and forgettable. We followed that with two appetizers... the Asian Squash Dumplings which were positively scrumptious and the Pork Belly and Pink Shrimp Spring Rolls that were minty, crispy and full of flavor. So seemingly we're off to a good start, right??? Ehhhh not so fast lightening rod......  The Asparagus and Black Mission Fig salad seemed to have potential... the candied black walnuts were awesome and the figs... fabulous! Unfortunately the asparagus was undercooked and the dressing was so off it made my lips pucker like Renee Zellewegger.       We also shared two entrees...   The Tea-Smoked Duck Breast which was ok... not amazing, but definitely not bad. They pulled a bait-and-switch on the plating accompaniments... it was supposed to come with bread pudding and star-anise reduction and instead we were served rosemary polenta (when we had already ordered the Coconut Polenta as our side) and an orange sauce. Hmmm??? Did you think we would not notice...  The Banana-Leaf Blue Nose Grouper could have easily been a sponge or boot for all I know because the curry based sauce was so overpowering that I could not taste the fish at all... just bite after bite of the baby food-esque pureed sauce that it was drowned in. I'm not sure where we went wrong... we asked the waitress for her suggestions on the cream of the crop and we had such a roller-coaster of sweet and sour that I'm not sure what to think....  ....except that I probably wont be back for more Asian conFusion",0.9107,0.772,0.127,0.101,0.5825032639318354

I had a tuna appetizer that was extremely high quality tuna, but the presentation was sub-par and the flavors didn't really mesh. I had shortribs for my entree which were practically devoid of meat, and consisted mostly of gristle and fat. My husband's grouper was so drowned in curry-sauce that you couldn't taste the fish, and our Vietnamese coffee cake dessert was like three week old entenmann's with some Swiss Miss on top.

2007-09-08,3.0,"I've been looking for the perfect place to take my very picky mother (she can cook it properly, so she is unforgiving when establishments mess it up) when she comes to visit me next week.  I thought I would give Le Lan a test run for lunch to see if it might measure up.  She likes French technique.  Le Lan supposedly employs it.  She likes pretty places.  Le Lan is pretty.  She likes way too much salt in her food.  Le Lan oversalts.  The outlook remained optimistic into my first course, a small dish of clams with Spanish chorizo in a coconut broth, until ... I encountered grit in one of my clams - significant grit.  Then in another clam.  Then in the impossibly salty broth.  Any hope of taking my mother here exploded into a fiery carnage of formerhope. Le Lan, this is a major and unforgiveable mistake.  Had I brought my family here, I would have been very embarassed.  A year from now, my parents would still be citing your establishment at the dinner table as further evidence of the decline in quality in ""nice restaurants.""  You can't charge what you charge (though it's not exorbitant) and have grit happen.  Shit happens.  But grit should not.  Five dollar clam shacks know how to avoid it.  Other problems with the food and menu presented themselves.  The pricing and placement of menu items yields little or no help in determining portion size.  I ordered a shrimp salad, which was the same price as a steak sandwich with fries and other entree-looking things ($14), but it arrived and was probably no more than fifty calories' worth of salad.  That's not a bad thing in itself, but the server might have warned me when I ordered it as a main course.  The presentation was beautiful and the concept was good, but the quality of the ingredients couldn't rise to meet the needs of the dish.  Just okay.  That's also how I would describe the soup, a coconut and shrimp affair.  Still very hungry, I ordered dessert.  The ""coffee cake"" was another interesting idea that was less stellar in execution - a few pieces of fairly unexceptional cake on top of some thick, sweet chocolate substance that was dubbed ""mousse"". This restaurant could be leagues better if its flavors played out as adventurously on the plate as they appear on the menu.  As it stands, it is just an okay place, probably good for a date.  Le Lan, you are new, and with a bit more work and some daring, you could be good.

Coincidently, our server was an old old family friend of mine.  He treated us VERY well.  We had two complimentary glasses of champagne... a great way to start the evening. The wine list is impressive for a fusion restaurant.  We ended up ordering a bottle of Montrachet.  It went very well with our meal.  The asian steamed buns with spicy dipping sauce was wonderful. Perfect texture and just the right amount of spice!  I then had the asparagus salad with walnuts, beets and greens.  Citrusy and sweet with a bit of a zing, it was a good palette cleanser.  We then split the Asian squash ravioli.  Personally, I could have made a meal out of just a plate of this.. it was SO good. For our main entrees, I ordered the Pacific halibut and BF got the Lamb.  The halibut was cooked perfectly - moist, flakey and very flavorful.  It came with an escargot ravioli that was SO good.  I'm not a big fan of lamb, but BF's dish was very good... more tender than other lamb I've had.   The dessert... oh the dessert.  We had a coffee cake that was served with chocolate mousse.  The mousse went across the plate and did not look that appetizing at all.  But, once you put it in your mouth, it was amazing.  Our second dessert took the prize!!!  It was a flakey fillo dough pastry with warm chocolate nutella type chocolate sauce inside.  It was seriously orgasmic.

2007-07-12,2.0,"I know that Chicago is known as a famous ""food town"".  However, I beg to differ.  To wit: 3 years ago, a friend of mine moved from Bucktown to Capitol Hill (Seattle).  He assured me that no city's food could gleam brighter and stronger than that of Chicago.  I turned around and issued a challenge.  Eat at my hand-crafted list of Seattle restaurants, and then tell me if Chicago's star still shines.  After a year of tackling my not-so-formidable list, he came to me and confessed: ""Seattle food is Amazing and beats Chicago food, hands down"" (some paraphrasing may have occurred).   So, I often visit Chicago (for reasons not disclosed) and still hope for my eating best.  I am always dissapointed.  Le Lan is yet another string in the hopeless dissapointments. So, Korean beef short ribs.  Theoretically, YUM.  The reality is: Should I pay $25.00 for 3 teeny ribs? I could go to my local Korean place and get a full 3lb platter for $25.  The lamb? uninspired.  The pork tenderloin? fussy and undercooked.  Moving backwards- we tried all the dumpling offerings.  The flavors were complex and bold.  However, they were also OLD.  Chewy and a little bit tough.  Although this has shaped up to be one flamer of a review, I do have to admit that I was surprised at the offerings of the wine list.  Thus, the 2 stars and not 1 star.  We found a lovely 05 Bandol rose to accompany our meal.  The server kept the bottle appropriately cool and was quick to refresh our wine glasses. In closing, I must offer that perhaps I don't know the adequate bar by which to judge Le Lan. Perhaps with the ""Chicago-bar"" LeLan is a lovely and appropriately special restaurant.  However, by the ""Seattle-bar"", LeLan is nothing special at all.
