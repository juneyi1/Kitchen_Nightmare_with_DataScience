2009-11-02,3.0,"Good food, but not a place I would pick if lunch were on my dime.  A former colleague invited me for a working lunch at Nick's. Even though I've been un/under-employed for a while, I don't think it was odd that I had some major sticker shock when checking out the menu online.  My friend ordered the lobster rolls on special and I went with the tuna melt. Her dish came out as three mini sliders with some fries on the side. It didn't look like a whole lot of food, especially for something I am sure was quite pricey. My meal seemed more generous, the tuna steak was huge, but worth the $19 price? Debatable. My fresh ahi tuna melt was more like a grilled tuna sandwich, which was fine, but for $19 I expected more. My tuna came out very rare, I wouldn't even call it seared since it wasn't browned; I was a little surprised I was never told how it's normally prepared and asked if that was ok, fortunately it was. The sandwich was good albeit messy, the oven roasted tomatoes were a bit too thick and kept shooting out from the bun no matter how much I wrestled with them. The wasabi aioli made the sandwich; without, it, the seemingly unseasoned piece of fish would have been quite bland.  Their dessert selection is impressive. I didn't get anything, but the cart they rolled out had at least 8 different options in addition to the ice cream and sorbet you can get.  Service was ok, I didn't really click with our server despite her politeness. We obviously weren't in a hurry to get through our meal and I felt like she was trying to rush us along; even dropping the check without asking if we wanted anything else (we did).  Bottom line: It's a safe choice, but after two visits I fail to be wowed by anything other than the prices.",0.9834,0.771,0.158,0.071,0.5345458553791888

2009-08-13,2.0,"Tuesday night,  7:00pm, business dinner, 7 guests. There are a few disjointed things going on here and they don't connect to the price point of this place.   The upstairs bar area is great, clean lines, intimate seating areas, windows that open up to the street.  I wish there were more Loop after work drink places like this.  Of course you have the obligatory TV sets blasting the game in your face at every angle; but that's Chicago, I've gotten used to it and can't mark it against them. So after a drink we head downstairs to the dining area.  So bizarre.  You take an escalator to what looks like the entrance to a mall parking garage or subway.  I thought it was a joke and we were going the wrong way.  But then the entrance to the dining room is off to the right and you see it once you get down. The downstairs dining room has a cafeteria feel to it; way too bright, the tables are spaced out to fill up the room.  Another weird thing: the Banquets are raised higher than the main floor so they look over all the other tables.  Guests in the banquets are sitting side by side so I felt like we were at dinner theater and my party was the entertainment!   Another strange item: The restroom area. The restroom are outside the dining area and I guess they share them with the McDonalds next door and the Salvation Army???  They are totally gross, not clean, and when I went to the bathroom there were 2 homeless people and someone puking in one of the stalls.  Remember how much you're paying about $40 bucks for a piece of fish here.... D-   Bread...  They give you a dinner roll at the beginning. They should finish baking them before serving. B+  Oysters Rockefeller.  Not a big fan but they were tasty.  I scraped off the congealed yellow cheese sauce they had sitting on top. B-  Tuna Sashimi.  Nothing special here.  You're paying 14 bucks for a few slices of raw tuna.  You can get this at any sushi place in town. C+  Escargot.   A disappointment.  A giant puff pastry filled with a heavy cream sauce that had just a light garlic taste... snails interspersed within....  It reminded me of a chicken pot pie.  We called it the Swanson's Frozen Dinner Escargot. B  Filet Mignon.  A nice cut of meat.  Plenty of food here.  I asked for rare and got medium-well.  Great garlic mashed potatoes and crispy greens.  Not over salted!  Kudos. C   Deserts.   They bring a tray over with samples of all their deserts which is a nice touch but maybe they should forgo that because they all looked gross.  Sort of like the stuff you get at TGIF... All with a heavy hand and everything drizzled with chocolate or caramel sauce.  C  Service.  Like other reviewers have noted we had about 4 waiters but no clear idea of who was in charge of our service. My wine glass stayed empty for a long time even though there was a bottle of chardonnay chilling nearby.. I didn't feel like they were trained well.    The average entrée price is $40 and the average appetizer is $15.   Plus drinks and gratuity you're looking at $100 a head.  The service, dining area and other misses doesn't add up to the price.",0.9914,0.798,0.134,0.068,0.501025768213268

The entrees were a big hit and a miss.  I ordered the big-eye tuna with the asian bbq preparation.  The tuna was cooked nicely but the sauce was sickly sweet.  It was too bad, the spots of tuna not smothered in brown goo were delicious.  Fortunately, the blackened grouper that my bf ordered was FANTASTIC.  Sometimes thick cuts of fish just get cooked to hell, but this dish was perfect.  The french fries were also good... the onion rings (too thickly breaded, I prefer the shoestring myself) and the potato croquettes were passable.

2009-03-31,3.0,"I wish I could give Nick's 3.5 stars, because it was better than average, but given the price, I expected more for it to earn that fourth star. I went on a Saturday night for a nice dinner out with my mom before the symphony.  We made reservations that morning and arrived at 6.15.  The dining room on the lower level was more than half-full, but not packed.  It was an elegant room -- white table cloths, a nice view of the plaza with the Chagall mural that would have been lovely on a nicer day, I'm sure. We both ordered from the special menu--Mom got a stuffed salmon and I chose grouper on a bed of couscous with shrimp and scallops, all wrapped in parchment paper.  Mom had a caesar salad and I had the lobster bisque.  I'm not usually a lobster fan, but I'm a soup fan, and I think the lobster bisque may have been the best bowl of soup I've ever had.  My mom loved her salmon, and I had a bite of it and agreed that it was very good.  My meal was also good, but I found the couscous, shrimp, and scallops more flavorful than the grouper.  I can't remember ever specifically ordering grouper before, so it might just be that I didn't realize that I wasn't a grouper fan, but I thought the fish was a bit bland and dry.  It was a large portion, though, which was nice, since I had hardly eaten all day.  Overall, I'd give the food four stars.  The lobster bisque gets five. However, I expected far better service from a restaurant this pricey.  It began well--right after we sat down, a young man came over to rearrange our table and asked if we wanted to order any drinks.  We only asked for water at that time, which was filled immediately by another young man.  Then we had to wait between 5 and 10 minutes for our waiter to arrive with the menus.  He did come back quickly after we set our menus down, though, and took our orders. The real issue began after the soups and salads were finished.  A young man rolled over a cart with my meal on it, cut open the parchment paper, and handed it to me.  He then asked if we wanted an extra plate, and we were a little confused, but accepted it.  He didn't have any other plates on his cart, so I figured that he just had to go back and get my mom's dish.  I wondered why he wheeled the cart over with only one dish, but didn't think too much of it, until the next cart came out--and went to another table.  We both stared at my plate for about 5 minutes, wondering if we were going to have to flag someone down to bring my mom's food to her.  Meanwhile, our waiter walked over to the table next to us and said something to them, but passed right by us.  Finally, another cart appeared, and the server handed my mom her dish.  No apology for the wait.  If our entrees had been in the $10-$15 range, I would have been less annoyed, but we were paying $35/plate, and I expected better. It took too long for our plates to get cleared after we finished, and our waiter only came over once after our food was served.  Mom was starting to get worried about getting to the symphony, so she mentioned to the man that cleared our plates that we had a performance to get to at 8, and we needed our check.  He said that he would let our waiter know.  After that, we were able to pay quickly, and made it to the symphony. My mom paid, but I believe that dinner for two was about $135--for two entrees, 1 soup, 1 salad, and 2 glasses of wine.  So while the service wasn't terrible overall, I did expect more.  There just seemed to be a lot of sitting and waiting (for menus, for my mom's entree, for the waiter to ask for our check) for this calibre of restaurant.",0.9947,0.86,0.104,0.036,0.501792642983119

Now for the spot-on suggestions:  My wine knowledge stops at seafood = white wine.  We mentioned that we were interested, and took her up on her recommendation.  She predicted that we would notice fruit notes, specifically, pear.  Moments later, these notes became very apparent to our eager taste-buds.  Seriously, I hope they are paying her extra for her work as a sommelier.

It's actually at street level and the more formal part of the restaurant is downstairs. But anyway, even though this part of the restaurant is less expensive than downstairs, it was still way too overpriced in my opinion.

It's my understanding they have different menus. Background: Dinner on a Tuesday night, 7:45 Food:  Everything I had was fine, but nothing really stood out. I went to Nick's with a few friends. We sat in the upstairs dining room, next to the bar. They had great happy hour specials on apps from 4-8 on weekdays. We tried the oysters, shrimp cocktail, tuna spring roll, and the mini beef sliders. Oddly enough, the sliders were the best app we had - they were well seasoned and not overly heavy. Also of the note, the oysters were seriously lacking flavor. I'm willing to give them a pass because oysters are out of season right now, but I explicitly asked the server how the oysters were and she said ""oh, they're fantastic.""  For the main course I had blackened catfish, mashed potatoes, and the seasonal vegetable (basically a vegetable medley). The fish and vegetables were fine, the mashed potatoes were quite good. The individuals in the party who ordered the Salmon with lemon caper butter and the Rustic Turkey and Brie sandwich raved about their food. Perhaps I just ordered the wrong thing.  Service:  The service was generally good. The server was prompt in bringing us drinks, filling our waters, and checking back with us. We did however have to wait 25 minutes for apps to come out, but this seemed to be a kitchen, not a server, issue.  Also, it was a bit odd, we had two different servers working our table. It didn't seem like it was planned, but it all worked out. Cost: We actually visited Nick's during restaurant week. They offered an app, entree, and dessert for $32.

So, here's a little tip I got from an employee at Nick's (I can't reveal names becaues he/she may lose his/her job)...Ready?   Their happy hour specials are $9.00 Martini's from the menu made with Svedka vodka, yuck.  The same martini's (without happy hour special), are made with Grey Goose vodka range from $1-4 more.  So basically, you are getting ripped off if you order the happy hour martini special. Here's the real kicker!  The flavored martini's, aren't actually ""flavored"" if you order the happy hour version.  For example: ""Blueberry Muffin"" is supposed to be made with Stoli flavored vodka.  if you get the $9 special, you only get a ""muffin"" martini made with regular wells vodka.  They don't add special flavoring to make up for the missing blueberry part.  ""Peach Champagne""--This martini is not made with special peach flavored vodka either, but it's the same exact price ($9) on the regular menu...So basically, if you order the Peach Champagne martini, don't order the happy hour version, because you can get the real version for the same price.

I asked for help choosing an entree and two servers, without hesitation, suggested the Denver Sole ($48).  They steered me away from the Kona Kampachi, fyi.  It was good, just not what I was in the mood for.   When they kept saying light, they meant light in taste and NOT light in texture.  There was no fishy aftertaste at all and tasted very clean.  They take out all the bones table side and then serve you.  It was served with fingerling potatoes that were smothered in butter (yum) and some vegetables.   I just had a taste for a flakier fish, which the Denver Sole is NOT.  It is a heartier fish. My bf got the Chilean Sea Bass ($37).  I asked one of the servers about the Chilean Sea Bass being over fished, and he said that they are NOT.  Nick's did in fact take them off the menu for a while when that was a ""trend"" and he said that they later found that the fish was not in fact endangered, so they put it back on.  Not sure how much of that I believe....Regardless, this was AMAZiNG.  Perfectly cooked and resting in a ginger based sauce.  It was great, just wish I had ordered it! :) For dessert, we went for the standard Key Lime Tart.  This is one good tart.  You should get it if you like Key Lime.   Overall, the service was great, the atmosphere friendly, and the menu overpriced.  However, if you can get your hands on a coupon to offset the bill, it's well worth it.",0.9985,0.77,0.208,0.022,0.531446388079041

What is keeping it from that elusive category?  A number of things, probably.  Service that is good, but not great.  A menu that is way too pricey for the Loop at lunch.  A subterranean location where I get to watch pigeons come perilously close to crashing into the windows. It is probably the price though.  I just can't justify spending that for myself.  When entrees run from $25 to $55 at lunch, you better be getting something spectacular.  This just doesn't quite live up to that, sadly. Come here for good seafood.  Come here for a good lobster bisque.  Don't come here to spare your wallet though.  Do come here if this is on someone else's dime ;)",0.8541,0.81,0.136,0.054,0.6115384615384615

2007-03-23,3.0,"My review is for the Grill, upstairs.  I've spent many a happy hour there, as well as a few lunches and dinners, and the value there is remarkable.  Their cocktails are great, and happy hour provides wondeful snack options.  They used to be complimentary, but now they're available at a small charge, which frankly is worth it to get a plateful for yourself instead of waiting for a server with a tray to come around.  The cheese snacks are the best thing ever.  Though the pricing has now changed (more expensive), the seafood is still fantastic.  I had the Kobe burger the other night, and found it to be unremarkable, but my friend got the blackened/jerk salmon salad which is amazing.  Great service, very professional and friendly staff.",0.9934,0.692,0.308,0.0,0.5327500000000001

2007-01-20,4.0,"I take off a star because I personally thought the decor was generic.  And my chair, in its weird modern style, wasn't all that comfortable.  Also, I'm not a fish eater so I think some of the brilliance is lost on me.  And finally because the molten chocolate cake wasn't all that good. But, I tasted some barely seared ahi tuna appetizer and it was good.  It was the ""Black and Blue Tuna"" and the sauce was amazingly delicious.  Which made the tuna edible for me. My caesar salad was good and I must say - best croutons EVER.  My chicken vesuvio was moist and the potatoes were tasty.  Tried some dover sole dipped in some brown butter and it basically was like eating a butter stick.  Tried some spinach garlic mashed potatoes and they were delicious. As for dessert - if you want a good molten chocolate cake, go to Roys.  This one didn't do much for me...",0.7622,0.788,0.116,0.095,0.5333333333333332

2006-11-15,4.0,"Nick's Fishmarket is a great place to eat dinner in the Loop. I ate there tonight before going to see the Pirate Queen. I sat at the bar; the bartender was very busy helping serve what looked like a retirement party (basically it looked like a lot of coworkers getting very drunk together- looked like trouble to me). Anyways back to why I enjoyed my dinner. I ordered a tuna sashimi appetizer which was fresh and delicious and I also ordered a Maui Wowie salad. This was one of the best salads I have eaten in a while- it has hearts of palm, feta, onion and grilled shrimp. I ordered it without dressing; when it first came out there was dressing on it. The bartender was very apologetic and the new salad came out quickly. Overall an amazing quick dinner before the theatre- I will be back soon.",0.9812,0.754,0.212,0.034,0.4579924242424242

2006-02-07,4.0,"If you're thirysomething like me, you've heard the legend of Nick's.  Impeccable service, great view of the Chagall plaza, delicious cuisine, and super expensive.  It's surprisingly more relaxed than you'd expect, and it's aged like a fine Bordeaux.  The redecorated dining room features tables for two where you can sit side by side, facing the fountain, very romantic. The booths on the side have individual dimmers, nice touch.  The service is still great, you have a server AND a runner, and chances are you'll see a couple other servers stop by at some point to fill a water glass, push in a chair, or remove a dish.  Yes, it's a little pricey, but not as bad as you'd think.  Now, the food...DEFINATELY lives up to the hype.  Great lobster bisque, ginormous salads (definately split one), terrific appeteasers.  As far as entrees go, you can't go wrong with the Dover Sole, or kick it old school and order the Lobster Thermidor (warning:VERY RICH).  Desserts? Who has room for dessert? Solid wine list, but could use a few more French White Burgundies.  Great special occasion place.  Tell them when you call for a reservation if you're celebrating something if you're into a ballon and a rose on the table.  Tell 'em Steffers sent you.",0.9946,0.747,0.246,0.007,0.5809920634920634

2005-11-01,5.0,"For a number of years, before they moved, I frequently flew to Chicago to spend long weekends with friends who were fabulously wealthy and overly generous, which meant I had the opportunity to dine in places my budget normally might not allow. Usually on the agenda was this upscale seafood dining spot in the Loop, with a spacious lower-level dining room overlooking an outdoor plaza with an elaborate fountain illuminated in color and a stunning Marc Chagall mosaic. The interior features artwork with nautical themes and miniature chandeliers hovering over each table, with dimmers allowing diners to set the mood. An evening here, seated among the city's power-brokers and society set, was always a treat, from the impeccable service to the amazing preparations, among them Dover sole in butter sauce, boned tableside, swordfish osso buco-style, and grilled lobster salad. The bar and cafe at street level serves more casual, less expensively-priced fare. I can only hope Nick's still merits the five stars I remember it deserving.",0.9786,0.821,0.169,0.009,0.648888888888889
