2011-08-12,1.0,"I hate to give this restaurant one star since I really wanted to like it, but I was completely underwhelmed by the food and experience at this place.  After a morning at the farmers' market in June, my husband and I stopped by Perennial for brunch. We ordered rhubarb mimosas, a goat cheese omelet, potatoes with cheese curds, and the yogurt and granola. Since the service was so prompt in the beginning, I thought we were going to have a better than average experience. But, no. We waited nearly an HOUR for our food. But even before we got out food, our server came to our table and asked us if we wanted anything else! Once he saw our clean silverware, he realized that we hadn't even gotten a bite to eat. He apologized and said they were backed up and that he'd check on our order.  So when we got our food, I couldn't believe how small the portions were. I usually don't love ginormous portions, but I couldn't believe that I literally got a 1/2 cup of extremely liquidy yogurt with a dusting of granola and raw ""macerated"" rhubarb bits. My husband said his omelet was good, but it looked so sad and lonely, alone on the plate with no garnish or accompaniment. My potatoes were cold. I had to send them back to reheating. Once I got them back, they still weren't that great - very dry. To add insult to injury, we were even double charged for the potatoes on our check! Overall, I think this place relies way too much on its prime location and traffic from the greenmarket. They don't seem to make an effort to make things right (e.g. comping parts of the check) after screwing up. One star for the mimosas. Otherwise, poor service and food, and way too pricey.",-0.9863,0.804,0.052,0.145,0.5053021978021978

The only disappointing dish was the granola, which was way more yogurt than granola and not what we were expecting.

The berries were generous and the cream was a perfect addition to the shortbread.  I also had the granola and yogurt. This was a let down. With granola listed first I expected more of a parfait-type dish. Instead I ended up w/ yogurt soup. It was runny and only had a sprinkle of granola on top w/ a dollop of jelly. No thanks.

The service is wonderful and the bloody mary is the best in town. I've asked what they use in the mix and apparently it's a homemade concoction by the Chef.  It has exactly the right kick that I need to start my Sunday!  For the dishes, we love to start with some flaky, buttery chocolate croissants. Obviously. Why wouldn't you? And I always order the citrus cured gravlax. It's a phenomenal, light dish with cream cheese, thin bagel crisps, fingerling potatoes and caramelized onions. Every bite is seriously a delight. My husband usually sticks with the Sancho's omelet which is hearty and tasty with a side of delicious potatoes bravas. It definitely beats a side of burnt hash browns. I have dabbled in dinner here on a few occasions, but while the food is tasty, it doesn't seem to WOW me the way brunch does. Plus, the brunch value for the quality is unbeatable.  Side note - I'm nervous about the new chef coming in. However, I do welcome change. Just please, please keep the brunch as strong as it currently is.

Yeah, yeah, yeah, Imma stop bringing dates to the expensive places cuz they don't seem to be working out. * sigh *  When we went this particular Thursday night, I thought Chef Virant was already here. I was wrong....however, Chef Poli's indelible impression was still apparent on the menu. And, much to our surprise (and pleasant excitement), the restaurant was offering a Chef's Week menu selection. I chose the Chef's week menu so my date could order a al carte. At this time, all of Chef Poli's classics were still on the menu -- the beet salad, the pork belly, the oysters (with the vinegar gelee, which was unusual but a great complement to the oysters), the duck confit croquettes, their perfect seafood dishes (mine was like a much fancier paella....wish the prawns had the heads on!), a good selection of dessert cheeses (with paired mini-salads), and the white chocolate semi-freddo with passionfruit ""coulis"".  So many superlatives in my reviews, but, every course was absolute perfection of seasoning and flavors. On many dishes, each ingrediently separately was ""eh', but paired together in one bite was a magnificent symphony that created a chrous of taste fireworks in your mouth...I closed my eyes with every bite to concentrate on what I was tasting and reacting with reckless abandon as my tastebuds were invigorated with flavors I'd never imagined would harmonize to well together. How about THAT for superlative!  Here's what I wrote on Open Table: ""I love this place! And, I was sad to hear Chef Poli was leaving...only to be excited that Chef Virand is coming!

2011-04-01,5.0,"First of all, I love the way this place looks. You know when you see those wedding films with the reception held under a huge billowing tent with candles lighting the festivities? No, well I painted you the picture anyways. It's not quite like that, but it's attractive decorated nonetheless. There are some thin birch trunks that serve as a center piece in the main west dining area. There are billowy canvas clothes hanging from the ceiling. The tables and seats are attractively dark. The lighting is dim enough to make anyone look good.  And, on top of that, the service is impeccable. Our waiter was friendly and incredibly well-informed on the menu. He broke down the more popular items without being prompted. Best of all, he never made us feel rushed.  In terms of the food, I got the sweet potato soup, the pork belly and the strawberry fun dip dessert. The sweet potato soup was a lot more savory than I expected. The presentation is the soup with a bed of grains laid down like a granola bar along with a dollop of melted marshmallow. The grains added texture to a creamy soup, while the marshmallow added sweetness to the, frankly, salty soup. While the soup was good, it was really heavy. The saltiness didn't help it out in the least. Yeah, yeah, it's a starch-based soup - of course it's heavy. The pork belly, though. My God. This is the best pork belly I've ever had. First of all, the texture of the crisp outside gave me slighty pause. But then I cut into it with my fork, and it just threaded away like mozzarella. That's how delicate the thing was. The thing just melts in your mouth - cliche, I know, but it literally did. The three cuts of pork belly come served with a braised red cabbage, mustard spaetzle, and apple puree. The meat is so strongly, and deliciously, flavored that it overwhelms the puree. The cabbage provided a nice vinegary contrast to the meat, which I appreciated. The bitter greens, though, seemed out of place. It tasted like nothing, and it was mushy.  The strawberry fun dip was tasty and whimsical, so it's worth sharing. It's served in two parts - a bed of basically strawberry soda rocks (think pop rocks) and a cup with vanilla ice cream with strawberry mousse, and a light wafer. You take the wafer, scoop up some ice cream, and dip it in the rocks - providing a nice burst of strawberry flavor that hits your mouth, which eases into the creamy vanilla ice cream.

OKAY, that was super weird. i ordered it anyway and it was surprisingly really good! i paired my steak with a wine that the waitress recommended and did not like it. it was a cabernet and it was way too dry for me.  restaurant is dim with candles lit on each table, quiet, a romantic place, perfect for a date. i probably would not go back to perennial. slow service. street parking wasn't difficult to find because we came on a weekday, i'm assuming. plus, i don't like the location.  i did hear really good reviews about this restaurant but sadly, i cannot agree with what i've been told.",0.992,0.745,0.18,0.075,0.5794871794871795

2011-03-15,2.0,"This review is for brunch. Tragically disappointed with our brunch here a few weeks back.  Everything on the menu seems like a carb overload.  For some reason, I had imagined fresh fruits and vegetables and delicate dishes.  Not the case at all.  The choices on the menu were one heavy, bready selection after another.  After a lot of deliberation, I ordered the croque madame, or monsieur, I forget which one.  It was basically terrible.  It came on a huge bed of oversized, mushy french fries that added nothing to the dish, but detracted a lot.  My wife got the gravlax, which came with bagel chips, which in itself is stupid.  And the gravlax itself was just okay.  Service was fine and the setting is nice.  Definitely will not be going back for brunch.",0.4019,0.775,0.125,0.1,0.5433333333333333
2011-03-10,4.0,"The weather was rough outside but somehow my mother and sister and I managed to get here.  Valet Parking was $11. Staff was very attentive and friendly. Conservative but friendly atmosphere.  The decor was very chic, dimly lit but with lots of light coming in from outside even in the evening gave it a nice ambiance.  Food was great! This is what we ate: Duck Confit Croquettes appetizer to share- nice, warm and tasty with their dip. Glazed Chicken Lollipops appetizer to share- NICE size I must say, 5 to a plate with a sweet glaze. Standard Mac and Cheese was cheesy but the portion size was tiny! The Edamame was a nice crunchy twist. Sweet Potato Soup- Not only does it look great plated but the flavors were rich and though mom and sis disagreed, I thought the  Zing or Spice towards the end was nice. Bread and butter- was okay, must supply a little more butter Pork Belly- thought it was a tad bit dry but the rest of the dish was a good, the apple puree gave the plate an extra sweet/sour punch. Scallops- very moist and buttery melt in your mouth goodness and ravioli in a light sauce. Roasted Chicken Breast- it was more a tiny leg and thigh But  Wow, this is the juiciest piece of chicken I've ever had, ever! Tiny fingerling potatoes in the sauce with mushrooms was very savory. Everything was good and I believe that for the first time in a long time, we all cleared our plates! I'll be back in the warmer months to see what's new.",0.9982,0.713,0.277,0.009,0.5975084175084175

2011-02-26,3.0,"This review is for Restaurant Week 2011 only. Compared to last year, I found Perennial to be disappointing.  Perennial is always a favorite for brunch, and last year's RW was outstanding (just see my prior glowing reviews).   This year, not so much.  We had the snottiest, snarkiest waiter.  He was one of those smile-while-ya-snark types, and by the end of the meal, I had had enough.  I don't know if he thought he was being flamboyant and funny or what, but he came off as a real jerk. The food was fine.  The duck croquettes with garlic aioli were really, really good.  I had the scallop dish as my main, which was tasty, but it consisted of three small scallops with a tiny amount of veg.  It's a good thing I'm a girl and I don't eat a ton - it was a good amount for me but my husband would not have been pleased.  The scallops were only seared on one side!  What is that?  One side had a beautiful brown crust, the other was pale and flabby.  Boo. The desserts were excellent.  The hazelnut bar was yummy (if a bit rich for my taste) and the raspberry ""cheesecake"" was just my speed.   Overall, it wasn't a bad experience, just not up to par with what I've come to expect from Perennial.  Sear the scallops on both sides and tell your waitstaff to play nice, and this is a solid four star review.",0.994,0.766,0.203,0.03,0.5625287356321839
2011-02-24,5.0,"Amazing, to put it in simple words. I am normally inclined to use Yelp when I am extremely passionate about my disdain for a business and not often enough for the times I LOVED a place. That chnaged after dinner at Perennial last nite for Restaurant Week. Here's why I decided to take the time to write a review... Decided to check Restaurant Week out last minute with a friend. After reviewing availability, locations and Yelp reviews, Perennial seemed to be our best bet. Neither of us had ever dined here before. The staff was extremely friendly, our server was upbeat and made terrific suggestions for our meal choices. The evening started off with a glass of the Dom. Brunet, Pinot Noir, which was by the way, an excellent choice. As we were here for Restaurant Week, we both ordered from the prix fixe menu. We started off with the confit duck croquettes which were beyond words. Honestly one of the best things I have ever eaten. The garlic aioli was the perfect side was the perfect touch.  Next we ended up adding a side of the famous mac and cheese we read so much about (not part of the prix fixe, but the waiter sold us on it upon our request for the MUST HAVES). The mac and cheese with edamame was great. Now I have had some that was even more amazing, but this was defintiely really good. The edamame was an excellent addition to mix the flavor up a tad.  For our entree we both did the Grilled Berkshire pork belly and REALLY happy we did. The flavor was unbelievable. This is hands down one of the things you MUST try. It is packed with flavor and so tender. Lastly I ended the meal with the Hazelnut crunch. It was good, but I am not a big dessert person so not much to report on my end. The General Manager stopped over to our table and chatted us up for a bit. He was extremely friendly and generally interested in how we liked the food and the service. very nice guy. All in all I was impressed with this place and will most definitely go back!",0.9979,0.781,0.208,0.011,0.5947700447700448
2011-02-24,3.0,"It would seem that maybe others have had a better restaurant week experience than we had... Was on the later end of dinner on a Friday night (9pm reservation). My sister was excited to pick a restaurant week restaurant serving pork belly. I was not thrilled that the non-pork belly options were less exciting (tofu and cod). To my excitement, the published menu online which stated cod actually noted scallops in the restaurant (score!). Starters: Duck Croquettes and Sweet potato soup. I had the soup, and really liked the flavor. Complex, lingering soft heat, and the honey mousse/foam was a nice touch. Felt the croquettes were dry actually, and there wasn't enough aioli to save them. Entrees:  (This is really where it started to go down hill). The service had been great and attentive up to the starters. After that, though we waited....and waited. Twice the server came by to say our entrees would be coming soon. Long story short, we waited about 50 minutes or so in between the starters and the entrees. I consider that to be pretty inexcusable. Even though I like conversing with my sister, that's a long time to wait. Once I got my entree, I was more disappointed. Plate was hot, like sitting under a heat lamp hot, and scallops, and everything else, well NOT. So cold food. I didn't expect that from a place of this caliber. But considering it was already about 10:30, it didn't seem like complaining about it was worthwhile. Sister enjoyed the pork belly. Given the prix fix options would definitely go that route. Desserts: Raspberry cheesecake (as other reviewers stated came with a ton of whipped cream), acidic bite to it, okay. Hazelnut bar--best part was the pistachio ice cream. The giant scoop of nutella-like substance was overwhelming (and boring after awhile). Okay overall, but no desire to have again. Anyway, was not thrilled about the dinner.

2011-02-23,4.0,"4.5 stars - For starters, from the moment I walked in, I felt like I was having dinner at a friend's restaurant. The hosts emitted a non-creepy ""we've been expecting you"" vibe, which I found to be a charming segue before being sat in their warm and perfectly lit dining room. Throughout the night, everyone who visited the table - from the food runners, to the sommelier, to the general manager, to the chef and our server - seemed genuinely okay with the fact that, hey, there they were, smack dab in the middle of arguably THEE most tainted-with-amateurs week of the year: Chicago Restaurant Week. But nonetheless, the service was energetic and paced perfectly. It was marked with gusto and excitement, banter and personality, attention and respect. It was flawless and collaborative. It was impressive. I can honestly say that I felt like I was in good hands throughout the entire evening, which is certainly a trait of only the best in the hospitality business. As for the food? I'll put it this way: on one end of the spectrum is the 88 cent frozen tilapia patty sold in the freezer at Aldi. On the complete other is Chef Ryan Poli's deconstructed fish tacos. I can honestly say, I now know what seafood is supposed to taste like. Moreover, upon visiting the table a few times, I can now confirm that Poli's food is as personable as he is. Everything from the sweet potato soup to the mac & cheese was so immensely comfortable, that by the way I was licking remnants of pork belly off my table, you would have for sure thought I just got dumped.  But no, let me assure you, that was not the case. In fact, I was entirely happy and clearly in a committed relationship with my fork and knife while at Perennial.

We don't do those dating anniversaries either. Or ""Sweetest Day."" Just a little too much for us. This year, however, he wanted to treat me to a nice romantic dinner since we hadn't had one in awhile. I gave him a list of restaurants I had wanted to try, and he was able to reserve a table for us at Perennial.  He called, made the reservation, and to seal the deal provided his credit card information. They called back twice to confirm. Not once during this whole reservation process did they mention that you MUST order from their special Valentine's Day menu. A menu that was extremely overpriced and was $75 per person. Not only was the $75 4 course meal okay (I won't even say good), but the service was awful. We waited about 20 minutes in between each course, with no sign for the waiter unless he was badgering us to get more to drink.  Another thing I thought was very rude was that we asked about the regular menu when we sat down and they told us no can do. Then another couple sat down next to us and asked the same thing and they were able to get something in place of one of the courses off the regular menu??? AND they were offered more bread in between courses - I would have taken more bread as I was hungrily waiting in between courses. What gives with their preferential treatment? I love my boyfriend for trying, but Perennial caused our try at a romantic Valentine's Day dinner to be a bust. We feel sick over how much we spent for such a bad experience.

2011-01-14,4.0,"Star rating Based on appetizers, since entree was only so-so. I took my parents to Perennial when they were last in town. They're foodie people so I always strive to choose a good place. Most times I've been lucky. They love MK, one-sixty blue, etc. They obviously enjoyed their meal here too! When thinking back about this place, the most memorable dishes were the amazing appetizers. My dad always goes crazy for the apps so this was no different. We had the dissected tacos which were really different and good. My mom couldn't get past the foam that tasted like chicken but I thought it was a great idea! Definitely get a variety of the appetizers!  For dinner, I wish I had gone with the pork belly. It's one of my favorite dishes yet I still went with the sea bass. (Momentary lapse of my usual good food judgement.) The sea bass was too fishy and a dish I would tell others to avoid. I had a portion of my mom's pork belly dish which was awesome!! My bf and Dad both had the steak and really loved it.  So pretty much everyone was happy with their dishes but little me. Oh well, at least I could taste them all and have some of the yummy appetizers. Mixed drinks were pretty good as well. I love ordering exotic/ or mixologist-designed drinks and this is a place worth trying. We had 2 desserts and I got the deconstructed snickers bar. It was ok but the flavors weren't anything special. Glad I tried it for the uniqueness factor. Overall, my biggest recommendation would be to sit in the birch tree room and not the side room on the east.

First we tried our own... we were both like wow, this is sooooo good, you gotta try mine! Then we tried the other one and again... oh wow, I don't know which one is better. So we kept trying each and well we never decided which one we liked better... they were both so damn good!  Of course we had to try the dessert so we got the snickers dessert which is basically a deconstructed snickers and again pure awesomeness.  I'm definitely returning and highly recommend you check it out too! P.S. Anywhere that serves pretzel bread and butter earns an instant star just for that",0.9961,0.764,0.211,0.025,0.6660119047619049

There are only two things that annoyed me about this place, though most people probably would think I am being picky. We felt a bit rushed through the meal, especially given that it was a Thursday and the restaurant was far from full. As soon as we finished eating a course, they would clear the plate and immediately bring out the next course. I know some people appreciate this prompt service, but it was too quick for us. We like a chance to savor what we have eaten and anticipate the next course. Additionally, it was a bit odd that even if your plate is clean that the waiter would ask to clear it rather than just taking it. (I suppose I could have said no to delay the next course...)

2010-09-16,3.0,"My friend and I enjoyed dinner at Perennial on the first night of our Chicago vacation.  After checking out the menu and website, I was eager to partake in the trendy scene.  Our cab entered the quaint Lincoln Park area and pulled up to the happening restaurant.  The patio was packed with diners taking full advantage of the warm summer evening.  The walls of the restaurant were made of floor-to-ceiling windows, which were opened up to allow those dining within to also enjoy some fresh air.  Our reservation was promptly honored, and we were escorted to one of the rear tables.  While the patrons outside and those in the bar area were hip and sophisticated, the crowd was a bit more unique in the main dining room.  Older couples sat amongst hipsters, but everyone seemed to be in fabulous spirits as they enjoyed their modern American meals. Our server approached and helped us navigate the appealing cocktail menu.  My Sleeping Bear was a spicy mix of Tito's Vodka, Ginger Liqueur, lime, Angostura bitters, and ginger beer.  The sweet and tangy beverage was refreshing, but also packed a punch.  My friend's Perennial Rose included the aromatic, girly flavors of Plymouth Sloe Gin, St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur, grapefruit, sparkling rosé.   We downed several gulps of these fabulous beverages as we awaited further service.  Unfortunately, everything seemed to be moving along at a snail's pace.  We had to constantly flag down our server for common items, like lemon slices for our water, or even bread.  When we were finally granted some rolls, we fell in love with their moist, doughy center and immediately asked for seconds.  My friend went as far as to say that she would gladly eat a few more as her main course.   However, the menu was way too appealing to fill up on the bleached carbs.   We started, instead, by sharing the Glazed Chicken Lollipops.  The tender drumsticks were covered in a soy reduction and orange zest.  The five legs were served on a bed of Asian slaw and crunchy cashews.  The sweet and savory sauce stuck to our fingers, but thrilled our taste buds.   Then, there was a lengthy pause filled with more bread and anxious planning for the remainder of the evening.  When our main courses finally arrived, my friend was less than impressed with her Pork Belly.  Though it had supposedly been braised for 18 hours, it turned out rather dry and tough.  The meat was sweetened by a seasonal broth made from peaches and blueberries.  The pork was served over a hearty heirloom tomato panzanella.  My Scallops, however, were perfectly cooked.  A light dusting of foie gras acted as an unique crust for the shellfish. Crisp apples, seasonal parsley root purée, and a tart apple gastrique acted as the perfect earthy compliments to bring the seafood dish back on shore.   There was no doubt that Perennial provided a stylish and fun way to start our trip.  The bulk of our meal was tasty and deserving of more like 3.5 stars, but the inefficient service decreased their rating to an unfortunate 3 stars.",0.9977,0.786,0.175,0.039,0.6129928315412186
2010-09-16,4.0,"I really enjoyed my meal here at Perennial. We had the chef's really inspired corn tasting menu. It was basically corn prepared four ways served through four courses and for $40 it was a delightful steal.  Our first course was a corn soup that was poured at the table onto a mound of fried crab and honey creme. This was hands-down the best corn soup I think I've ever tasted. The next course was corn truffle ravioli with homemade bacon and a succotash-like corn on top. The polenta-like corn truffle puree within each raviolo was simply divine. Moving on to the main course, there was a golden-seared scallop over a bed of corn with micro-greens on top. It was also served with spoon bread. The spoon bread did disappoint me in that it merely tasted like undercooked cornbread -- but the scallops were seared impeccably with just a touch of salt. Wish there were more than the three scallops, but each bite of the three was tasty. For dessert we finished with a corn creme ice cream and a brown butter corn financier on top of blueberry compote. It was interesting to have sweet corn for dessert, but it seemed to work. It was creative and yummy.  Overall, wish the micro-greens weren't the only non-corn veggie on the menu, but every bite was really yummy. I also wish the spoon bread was real cornbread, but that's really the only 2 draw backs of the meal. Overall, I really enjoyed it and enjoyed seeing the creative dishes presented by the chef made from local corn.  Next time I'm in Chicago, I'll be back.

The flavors were really good and there was a ton of clams in this dish. Embarrassingly I sucked it all down in 10 minutes. To cap it all off, I got the flavors of snickers bar dessert. I gotta be honest, the plate looked like a pile of dog poo. There was a bunch of different-shades-of-brown looking things on the plate.  But if you mixed it all up together, it tasted yummie!

We decided to wander over, and after spotting mimosas and bloody marys, I got excited--a brunch place! My favorite meal, of course.   Their menu was smallish, and it said they use local ingredients from the market as much as they can. Bonus points. When we sat down, I inspected my coffee mug because it was stained (I thought it might be dirty). Our waiter noticed (!), and asked if it was dirty. I said it wasn't, but he replaced it anyway. Sadly the coffee that filled it was not that great, and it was $3.25, which for black coffee with brunch I thought a bit much. It could have been hotter and stronger, or had some personality. I added cream and sugar, which I do not do with good coffee. We waited awhile for our food, and before it got to the point of wondering what was taking so long, the waiter came over and explained a problem in the kitchen. After that, the manager came over. After we got our food, after a long but not-unreasonable wait, we got some comped chocolate croissants. Very nice, really great service. To the food: delicious. I got a lobster eggs Benedict with spinach on cornbread cakes. Great combination, I loved it, and it came with a mixed greens salad.

Completely different experience. The food was superb. I had TWO orders of the dock confit croquette appetizers because they were just that good. I have a very small stomach, so my boyfriend was shocked when I said I wanted another. Our steaks were cooked to perfection and the portions were perfect. Drinks were great and the service and ambiance was excellent. I highly recommend this place to anyone who can appreciate fine dining and sophisticated food. I will say, however, that if you are a vegetarian, I am reluctant to recommend this restaurant. The veggie options are (as usual) very limited and didn't look all that appetizing, though I didn't try anything veg myself.",0.9893,0.737,0.229,0.034,0.6097165532879817

We started off with the fish tacos, that were a fun play on the traditional dish.  They were actually sashimi style, with mango salsa and guacamole puree.  They were quite good. For the main entrees we chose the steak with the gnocci and leek salad and the poached halibut.  Both great dishes, the steak was sooo good.  The halibut was yummy, although it was served on a mix or corn and diced bacon.  That personally wasn't what really appeals to me, but I guess it balanced the with the white fish well.  For our side, my favorite on the menu, the watermelon & heirloom tomato and basil salad! I am definately making it this weekend.  Such a genius combination, yet noone has ever thought of it before.   For dessert, what many have raved about on here.  The deconstructed snicker bar.  Sooo good!  You get each ingredient separately on one plate and you just scoop the different pieces together and can make your own combinations.  Good selections of coctails as well!",0.9951,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.5555555555555555

But I will say that everyone enjoyed what they had! The lobster and corn bread was wonderful. Not something I would normally order considering the poached eggs and hollandaise, but I like every single bite. The Croque Madame was a great dish as well. My dad enjoyed the burger. Good fries.

2010-07-15,4.0,"A few years back, I celebrated my birthday at Butter, and really liked Chef Poli's style.  Sadly, Butter closed, and Chef Poli left town.  Fast forward to right now.  Perennial has been open a while.  Chef Poli is back home and wielding magic.  I spent a fantastic summer night there.  Life is excellent. To start, Confit duck croquettes, garlic aioli, thyme.  Great little bite to start the evening.  The only negative is the texture of the duck.  It felt like potted meat, which is not necessarily bad, just not expected.  Next, Tomato gazpacho, with cucumber salad, cherry tomatoes, and olive charcoal.  Very nice pureed soup.  The olive charcoal was an interesting play of texture.  I forgot what they do to make it like that.  But what looked like little black clumps of coal has the delicious salty flavor of olives.  A pretty accent to all the orange and yellow in the soup.  Next, fish tacos.  Actually, only in name.  This dish is a crudo, with elements of fish taco.  So that night, pristine hamachi, mango/papaya salsa, avocado, and corn tortilla puree.  The tortilla puree is the surprise element to me.  Puffs of little cream on the plate, looking like whipped cream.  When you taste it, salty crunchiness of corn tortilla.  Magic! For our mains, Poached halibut with sweet corn, fingerling potato, house-made Iberico bacon, lobster infusion.  When the dish came, I said, 'A fish and corn chowder!'.  A thick piece of nicely poached halibut, sitting on components of what normally goes into a corn chowder.  Next, Seared sea scallops, English pea puree, carrots, pickled green garlic, lavender salad.  The scallops provided a punchy sweetness, as with any nicely seared scallop does.  The veggies, very delicate, a garden delight.   Dessert was liquid that night.  A nicely nuanced Le Compte calvados.  Just the right finish for the evening. The interiors reminded me of an outdoor room.  On a nice summer night, with the glass panels opened to the patio, outside and in all blended together.  The clientele was a nice mix of all ages, everyone having a relaxed time. Why 4 stars?  An overall great experience - food, service, decor, atmosphere.  Shout out to the great re-interpretations of classic dishes.",0.9975,0.773,0.211,0.016,0.5561391223155929

Great minds really do think alike.  We both wanted that truffled eggs benedict.  Rarely, do we order the same thing, because that is super lame, however, we were so glad we did.  Perfectly poached eggs with a light hollandaise sauce.  We devoured it.   Brunch was excellent.  I can hardly wait to try dinner sometime soon!",0.9894,0.696,0.268,0.035,0.5837962962962963
2010-06-26,4.0,"It's a Wednesday late afternoon and me and my buddy go to a bar after work before heading to Perennial. At the bar we had 2 or 3 beers and a shot just to start thing out right. We get to Perennial thinking it will be easy to get a seat in the outside dining area because its Wednesday and its not dinner rush yet, wrong thought. It was pretty packed so we decided to put name in for wait at the extremely tiny bar. Because of that the same thing always happens, they ask if you would like to wait at bar, and then its starts getting to be a cluster of people annoyed that they aren't eating when they wanted to. I truly hate bars that can only seat  6 or less people. We decide since we already had beers and this place being somewhat swanky that we decided to go for something a bit more classy and made of whiskey. 4 Manhattans later, the people next to us at the bar had ordered food, so we got to see a few interesting things on the menu. The people were extremely nice and didn't mind telling us what was good and what was not. Side note, me and my buddy happened to both be wearing black t-shirts with blue jeans, by accident not choice, so we looked like we just got off work from the Gap. (insert a few laughs by staff who all were also wearing black t-shirts) Finally got seated 30-40 min later and was feeling hungry because the booze was kicking in. When that happens I want to eat soon as possible so many appetizers get ordered. I highly recommend the Chicken lollipops, sweet glazed candy like chicken that looks like candy. The Serrano ham and Manchego cheese crostini was excellent, great flavor from the smokey ham and the sharp bit from the cheese. Wanted the oysters but the were out so then noticed they had fished tacos but waiter said they were not what you would call normal tacos. Asking what that meant, he described it as deconstructive cooking were all items of something is taken apart and the taco shell was not a shell and was actually made of foam. Wha? not digging taco foam so we passed on that and just went with a cheese plate. 2 more Manhattans each and felling content, we thought full dinners might induce instant food coma, we went with sharing the linguine and clams and a order of sea scallops. The homemade linguine was so good and light tasting, not like the heavy noodles everyone is use too in bad American /Italian restaurants. The clams were great mixed with the garlic, chili flake, and white wine sauce. Scallops were just OK, could have been better. The people at the bar told us to avoid the Hanger steak because it was a bit tough and not as tender as other cuts. So again because of the many drinks we say what the hell land go for a dessert. I wanted to get the Brazilian because of it's name and innuendo but the Flavors of Snicker Bar sounded interesting. Again the waiter says its deconstructive and that every component of a snickers bar is separated out on plate and then its up to you to create the flavor. Ok, I can see how this seems fun at first but could get tired of having to reassemble food. Put in the order and out comes a plate with crumbly chocolate cake mounds and dollops of chocolate mousses and peanut ice cream. Looks like a painting and we are like how in the hell is that going to taste like a snickers, well it does and was inhaled in a matter of seconds. So it ended up being fun but next time I want good o'l constructed dessert. To sum it all up, I think everyone should wait for outside seating and the get the Chicken lollipops for sure as well as the Linguini if you like fresh pasta. My only negatives are the small bar and taco foam.  I plan to come again and try out the brunch.",0.9951,0.813,0.138,0.049,0.522518674136321

Well, that's pretty good, too. Ok, that's a bit of an understatement. The food is thoughtful, comforting, and elegantly plated. In a nut-shell fantastic. I have a special story with Perennial, and I don't know if I should keep it a secret or share it with you, but I suppose the world should know. We had guests in town, and coming from Detroit they were looking for some gourmet eats, specifically tasting menus. I called Perennial and asked if they ever did such events, and the recepetionist said ""no, but let me ask the Chef if he is interested"". We hung up the phone and within a minute she rang back with excitement letting me know that the Chef was more than interested.  The 4 of us were so excited for the meal, and upon arriving at the restaurant we were greeted with warm welcomes and our waitress actually said ""we've been looking forward to this all day"". We felt so welcome, it was a pleasure from the start. The service bar none, our waitress was phenomenal. The series of courses that came out one by one were all exceptional.The chef was able to convince me that Olives have a place on the plate, the only food that makes my stomach churn. The creamy gazpacho was the first course and the least appealing on the menu (let me be clear, everything looked amazing but that was 7 out of 7 courses). Foot in Mouth - It was cool and creamy, with olive charcoal adding the perfect textural element. Sugar sweet cherry tomatoes and cool slivered cucumber lined the bottom of the bowl adding unbelievable freshness.  Each course offered intrique and interest. It was one of the most delicious and satisfying nights that I have ever had.  The restaurant offers the perfect evening. Great food, good wine, positive energy, it's not just a dinner out, it's a little more. Perennial, 5 stars!

But there was a quieter room in which to dine on the east side of the restaurant with a nice view of Lincoln Park.  We started with coffee, and then waited, and waited and waited for the server to come back for our order.  Of course, we were talking pretty intensely, so maybe the server didn't think we were there for the food, but finally he came and about fifteen minutes later, brunch arrived.  I had the eggs benedict with mushrooms and truffle oil for $10 and my friend had french toast with cinnamon apples and creme fraiche for, I think $9.  I don't think that's that expensive for a brunch in the city of Chicago, and both meals were DELICIOUS!  After the initial wait for the order, the staff was very attentive and they let us stay and talk for, I think almost an hour and a half (no, the restaurant was not crowded; otherwise we would have cleared out to let others have a seat).  Anyway, I recommend Perennial for a great, lazy Saturday brunch/lunch after you stroll through the Farmer's Market directly across the street.  Great ambience.  Good food.  They could have cranked up the service a bit, but, really, maybe they just didn't want to interrupt our conversation.  So, four stars.",0.9872,0.848,0.127,0.025,0.5499999999999999

Graham Elliot - a step up in price but my fav in chicago so far HB Home Bistro - cheaper and much better food.

2010-05-02,2.0,"I have to say, I'm absolutely baffled by the overwhelming positive feedback on Perennial.  My fiance and I agreed it was our worst $200 meal in the 4 years we've been in Chicago.   I will say the restaurant was beautiful and the wait staff were fine, but other than that and the food presentation the meal was fairly close to a disaster. We started with a couple of vodka drinks that were $12 and in the smallest cocktail glasses I've ever seen.  I ordered the Portabella Mushroom Carpaccio and the chicken lollipops to start (BTW- our waiter forced me to order the entrees at the same time and said he would bring them out much later and they came out 10 minutes after the apps).  The Carpaccio was OK, but pretty bland and underwhelming.  The glaze on the Chicken lollipops was nice but the chicken itself was extremely fatty and I was constantly pulling cartilage out of my mouth.  Overall- OK so far.  Far and away the biggest disappointment was my entree.  Per the recommendation of others I went for the Duo of beef.  The presentation was very nice.  The course included, a 4 oz. filet, a piece of braised short rib, and some sort of potato pancake, all coupled with a butternut squash puree and a bernaise sauce.  The puree was nice but didn't really mesh with the rest of the dish.  The bernaise sauce had literally hardened and I had to scramble it like an egg to get it back to sauce form.  I asked for my filet medium rare and it came out COMPLETELY raw.  I probably should have sent it back, but I try to never do that.  The temperature wasn't nearly as concerning as the texture... it was the gamiest filet I can ever recall having in my life.  I literally didn't eat it and it was supposed to be the star of my plate.  The braised short rib was fine, not outstanding.  Just so you know I'm not just a complainer, 2 other customers within 10 feet of me sent back their filet for being undercooked as well!  One of which was sitting next to me and when they came to collect her dish asked how the 2nd plate was, and she cooly flipped the meat on its side and said ""it's still really raw, but I'm not going to make a big deal about it.""  They quickly took it away without recourse. My fiance got the salmon which she liked... I found it to be bland.  We also had the macaroni and cheese with bacon and the braised short rib polenta.  The macaroni and cheese was fine, not great, but the bacon in it was disgusting.  It was huge fatty pieces of bacon that were literally inedible.  The polenta short rib was OK but nothing great, again the short rib was very fatty and poorly cut. I guess the dessert was the highlight in terms of taste- we got the hazelnut bar.  It was a hazelnut chocolate pudding and pistachio ice cream over a crunchy bar surrounded by creme fresh.  It tasted pretty good, butt I honestly think you could take a rice krispie treat, a scoop of nutella, and a scoop of any pistachio ice cream and have it perfectly recreated. Look, I don't like giving these type of reviews and don't typically.  I just think a $200 dining experience dictates a certain quality of experience and food that was not present here.  I will definitely not return.",0.9928,0.797,0.142,0.062,0.5635814931337318

I highly recommend the ham croquettes as an appetizer.  There are about 6 croquettes served in a long olive dish delicately dressed with aioli.  They arrive hot and slightly crisp with a melted center of what seemed like bechamel, cheese and bits of smoked ham.  delicious! Easy to share - but why not be selfish with this dish! For an entree I had the crusted sea scallops with oxtail broth that was poured table side.  It was accompanied by fresh oxtail ravioli's and perfectly medium diced root vegetables.   The service was excellent and friendly and ready to answer any questions.  They were also familiar with the wine menu to help match one with the entree.   Aside of the dishes being on the brink of salty and the root veg & ravioli's needing a few more minutes to cook, this place is going to do great things.  The wine menu had a great selection, but I would have preferred a tad bit cheaper offerings.  The wines are very pricey here.  The one thing I thought was a great idea was on the back of the wine menu there is a list of favorite choices by a variety of chefs, locals, and business men....something I had never seen before and thought was a nice touch.

That was it--I was shocked at this ""cheesecake"". I am alll for thinking outside of the box and exploring different takes on food, but this was just un-filling. And...you guessed it...

They were actually having an electrical problem and their reservation system was down, which we certainly couldn't fault them for. Despite that, they managed to seat us a half hour before our reservation, which we appreciated. The wait staff did a nice job, the waitress was a bit cool, which seemed to coincide with the vibe of the place.  Our food was great - if this review was based solely on food the review would have been a 4.  My husband had the black truffle gnocchi and the short ribs, I tried both, each was very good. A lot of flavor in the short rib. I had the Broccoli soup and the Salmon. Again, both were very good. Included in the Chef week special my husband had the hazelnut bar which was just OK.  All in all - good food, fine service, a slight air of superiority and little devoid of any distinct character - glad we went, enjoyed it, will likely not go back.

I'm really not sure what the hype is all about, but it wasn't a terrible experience though. The decor was okay, but the noise level was very loud. So, if you're looking for a romantic night out at this place, make sure it's not on a weekend. My hubby and I got here at 8 PM. with a reservation, and we were seated right away. The place was packed and there was a huge line of people waiting for a table. So, make sure to make reservations on the weekends.  Service was good. Our server was very attentive and sweet. The bus boy was very quick to refill my glass of water. At times, I didn't even see him come by, but my glass magically refilled itself.  My hubby ordered from the ""Chef's Week Menu,"" and I ordered from the regular menu.  Now for the food.  Starter:  Glazed chicken lollipops - this was very good, and best value of all our dishes.  Black truffle gnocchi - good, but ridiculously expensive for 4 pieces of gnocchi. My hubby got his with his prix-fix and I ordered one for myself. How can you charge someone $12 for 4 pieces of gnocchi? It's just beyond me.  Mixed greens salad - good, basic salad.  Entree:  Grilled Atlantic salmon - just okay, I think I make better salmon.  Becker Lane Organic ""pork lover's obsession,""  grilled loin, braised belly - this was good, but not great. Pork loins from Big Jones was better. The portion was also ridiculous for an entree. Once, I received this dish, I quickly ordered a side of mac and cheese. The mac and cheese was boring. J. Alexander's mac and cheese is hands down the best.  Dessert:  Hazelnut crunch - good, but overly rich and sweet for me.  Passion fruit cream - the vanilla ice cream was ordinary, the berry gelee was very tart, but the lemon madeleines were very good.

2010-03-08,4.0,"It was restaurant week and I had dinner plans with friends I had not seen in quite some time. They kept telling me was, ""Gee, I hope it got better than last time I came"". Those reassuring words gave me just a slight twinge of nervousness, yet by the end of the night, raves and praise was coming out of their mouths. What happened in between? Let's break down the game footage.  Our server, not only stunningly beautiful, but really, just stunningly charming and worked our table well. She joked with us, made us laugh and just really help to make our night go in the best direction possible. I think she quickly figured out that even though we were there for restaurant week that the three-course menu was just not going to suffice. While I went with a glass of prosecco to start the night off, my friends shared a bottle of malbec. We quickly dissected the main menu for possible additional starters. Going with our truffled gnocchi and risotto, we added a lovely himachi, (maybe?), crudo and sweetbreads to get the night going. The gnocchi was the clear winner and just amazing, however the risotto was an unexpected treat. It was certainly a change of pace with out really not making it risotto. The blend of squash and seeds and soft aborio rice certainly gave a textural twist, but the flavor was subtle yet complex. The sweet breads? Well, when you blend it in with the egg and the sauces and everything else, it got a little lost, but certainly wasn't gone. The special we had, the fish, was good yet the relish over powered the flavor of the fish and certainly was too much.  We went with two short ribs, a duck and a salmon for our mains. I really enjoyed my salmon, it was crispy and flavorful and tender on the inside. A little on the overdone side, but really, pretty darn great. The braised short ribs were falling apart as you picked it up and when it was in your mouth, just melting away. The duck was a hit for my friend, although I never tried it. Oh, did I mention we got sides? Oh yes.  We did. The bacon mac and cheese was delicious, the bacon thick and chewy and added some great smokiness and texture. The polenta was good, but with the short ribs that came on top, (hell yeah there was short ribs on that polenta!), blended a little too much and made a little soupy of a mess. But really, who am I kidding? Of course all of it disappeared in to our mouths.  The dessert were good, although at this point my lil' stomach was about ready to burst from all the goodies we had, but really, you just had to get dessert.... I mean it was part of the three courses. I went with their twist on the strawberry cheesecake forsaking the chocolate caramel dessert. (Seriously, I think I was being possessed by some demonic force not to go for the latter), but it was the lighter of the two, which made me glad I got that one. The ""cheese"" part was the whipped cream on top, the graham cracker crust ice cream in the middle was really good and the strawberry bottom was okay, although I wish a little smoother.  All in all, it was a great evening. The service was top notch, the food was great and the company was, as always, enjoyable. The space itself lends itself for a girl's night out, (of which I saw many), to a cozy and intimate night for a couple, (which I also saw many of). Slightly dark with a natural woodsy feel to it.  I will say the waiting area is a bit of a pain, very crowded and I always felt like I was in the staff's way, but with warmer weather coming, (sweet Jebus I hope so), that outdoor seating will certainly make it less of a worry to crowd the indoor area and just wait outside.",0.9995,0.728,0.242,0.03,0.5068138436809323

2010-03-01,4.0,"Wow came to Perennial for restaurant week, and it was a wonderful experience with the fam! The service was totally on top of it! We felt sorry for the waiter who had to use this totally cool looking modern silver pitcher (with no spout!) to pour into really thin diameter glasses. Needless to say, I was entertained watching him struggle with this nonfunctional, but aesthetically pleasing water pitcher. I digress. BLACK TRUFFLE GNOCCHI. Get this dish! The portions are ridiculously small (literally four 1'x1' cubes topped with super flavorful hen of the woods mushrooms and plated on a parsley root puree). The truffle flavor is mindblowing delicious!! I also tried the squash risotto toasted pumpkin seeds. I thought the flavors were all very balanced and the seeds really added a nice accent to the palate. I also tried a few bites of the salad which my brother enjoyed a lot.  Main course: I had the duck, which had a crispy fatty outside skin, served with a dried cherry glaze on top of some savoy cabbage. It was all very flavorful, but I think duck can sometimes be a little overwhelming. So I was less impressed by this dish. And the duck and foie gras pithivier is basically a little pastry filled with meat.. reminiscent of a mini meat pie. Nothing spectacular with that. The cabbage was surprisingly well seasoned. I also tried some of the salmon (cooked perfectly) and the short ribs (very tender.. sorta fatty). For dessert, I tried both, but I'd recommend the crispy hazelnut bar with milk chocolate over the raspberry ""cheesecake"" with raspberry custard and graham cracker ice cream. For drinks, I tried the Pristine Waters- yummy and strong! and the GSM blend red wine which wasn't bad.  Ambiance is okay. I think the side room really needs to work on its acoustics, like adding some sound absorbing curtains or something. The table next to us was full of drunken old ladies who were ridiculously loud and annoying. I was also slightly sad that I did not get a candle on my dessert for my birthday even though the neighboring table got one! Overall though I had a pretty good experience here.

For brunch, was able to make a reservation easily for Sunday at noon (made the reservation I think Thursday before).  Staff was very nice and accommodating.  The bloody Mary was delicious and I had the biscuits and gravy, which were very good.  Unfortunately, our server was new or was just ""off"" that day because she didn't know what beers were on tap and my husband asked for the beer list and she brought the wine list... just totally didn't pay attention to the list she gave us.  Our friends got their drinks after 10-15 minutes, which was too long.  We kind of thought she forgot.  They were out of crab cakes eggs Benedict (damnit) and no duck confit... two big items on the menu they were out of?  Oh well.  My husband really enjoyed his burger and the spicy ketchup it came with.  The fries were big fat steak fries, but were hot and salted well, so that was fine.   Overall, we really like this place, it's close, the food is fresh and the staff are always super nice and accommodating!  It's unexpected since you might think it's a pretentious place, but no.  Definitely try Perennial!",0.9979,0.712,0.252,0.035,0.6613838383838384

We had reservations for 8:30 on Friday night and were immediately seated in a very crowded restaurant.  This was great, except that we were seated in a special room across the hotel lobby, which was a bit of a disappointment, but at least we did not have to wait forever. Our service was friendly and efficient throughout the meal. We started with the squash risotto and the black truffle gnocchi.  Both of these dishes were amazing.  The black truffle gnocchi had a great savory and earthy taste and was a unique dish (small portion).  The risotto was a generous portion of creamy risotto with sweet squash and fresh shrimp--yummy! For our entrees we had the short rib and the salmon.  They were both delicious and served with fresh vegetables. For dessert we had both the chocolate hazelnut bar and the ""cheesecake.""  The cheesecake was deconstructed and had a delicious raspberry custard.  The hazelnut bar nicely combined the crunch of the bar with the creamy chocolate cream.

It was pretty good though a tad overcooked and I would've liked more sauce. Then for dessert, go with the Hazelnut bar with chocolate and pistachio. It blew me away.

For the main course, we got the duck breast and the short rib.  The short rib was the winner; extremely tender.  I'm talking about plastic utensils tender!  The duck was cooked to a medium-rare/medium and had a nice flaky foie gras pastry with it.  By the time deserts came we were stuffed but managed to try both the cheese cake and this chocolate and vanilla icecream ""crunch"" bar.  the crunch bar was our favorite of the deserts.   The restaurant was absolutely packed for restaurant week.  We had to wait a little longer past our reservation for an available table; nothing terrible.  Maybe 15 minutes max.  The wait staff, bartenders and manager were all super nice and kept checking on us and making sure we were okay.  They even sent over some oysters, a side of chickpeas and octopus and even bought us a round of drinks.  I don't think I've ever been so well taken care of after being asked to wait for a table.  If I get that treatment every time feel free to keep me waiting!

2010-02-25,5.0,"Perennial is the type of restaurant that makes me want to be a better diner.  After gazing longingly at this place for quite some time, it's inclusion in the Restaurant Week fleet sealed the deal for me. Upon walking through the revolving door, I was greeted by a perky hostess and a manager (?) who sat us at our table right away. I was dining with a friend, but as soon as I sat down, I was already plotting to get my boyfriend to take me back. I fell in love with the decor. It was such a trendy looking place, but not at all pretentious. There's no reason to be pretentious, even if you're just doing it for pretentiousness sake.  I was already giddy about the famous black truffle gnocchi, however, I gasped out-loud when the smell of delicious pretzel bread wafted into my nostrils. After stumbling upon this amazing discovery, I ordered as quickly as possibly just to expedite the arrival of the bread!! Bread was yummy. The gnocchi was even yummier! So glad that it delivered as I have a tendency to hype things up and be disappointed when it can't live up to my lofty expectations. My friend went with the shrimp/toasted pumpkin seed risotto, which had a phenomenal flavor. The toasted pumpkin seeds was an interesting twist and was the perfect touch for a cold winter dish.   And even though we went with the restaurant week menu, we apparently felt like we were being underfed and ordered the bacon mac 'n cheese and polenta as sides. The entrees were good - I was pleasantly surprised by the butternut squash puree that came with my salmon, but the salmon itself wasn't blowing my mind. It was good - don't get me wrong, but I think that the veggies really stole the show. Mac n' cheese was soooo good...awesome cheesy goodness paired with salty, smoky bacon. Please sir, can I have some more?  Unfortunately, I gave up dessert for Lent (stupid, stupid, stupid!) and didn't get to partake. My friend opted for the hazelnut bar, and while she did her best to pretend it tasted horrible, her hurried bites and eyes-closed savoring really gave it away.  Besides the awesome food - the service was top notch. I think we had three separate people come by our table and ask us how things were. Including the assistant manager, Ben. He was super personable and friendly. He asked us what other restaurants we had been to for restaurant week and then told us how the Boka Restaurant group is doing a ""Chicago Chef Week"" March 22nd through the 29th. He even gave us a list of all the restaurants along with his card in case we ""ever needed anything"". I tucked that bad boy in my wallet...not sure what I would ever need, but it can't hurt to hold onto it! So mark your calendars Yelpers! $30 three-course dinners and $20 three-course lunches. Restaurant week cometh again for the Boka restaurant group!

When we arrived, they told us it would be 5 minutes for our table (which really meant about 15-20), but no worries, we headed into the bar for a drink.  Everyone who knows me knows I'm a manhatten drinker in the cold months, so I ordered a French Quarter cocktail - perfect substitution.  Great start. When we were finally seated, our table couldn't have been more perfect - tucked in the corner but with a great view.  Our server was top notch.  Perfectly attentive, asked all the right questions but not too many - she was fabulous.  And in fact, this whole service team was awesome, with clearing plates, resetting flatware, water refills, etc.  And ohhh the warm pretzel bread, be still my heart, arrived just in time to prevent the bourbon from taking over.  :) From start to finish, the meal was delicious.  Black truffle gnocchi?  I could have eaten an entire plate full myself. Risotto with squash and curried pumpkin seeds?  Cooked perfectly, great combination of flavors.  We also had the daily crudo, which was some type of hamachi served with jalepeno, and some other chili pepper (and maybe a little pickled onion?) I don't know, but it melted in your mouth it was that good.  I could have called it a night after the appetizers! But then the main course arrived.  My entree was roasted duck breast (again, cooked perfectly) with braised cabbage and this little puff pastry filled with duck confit and foie gras.  Holy mama this dish was awesome.  We also had the braised short ribs, equally delicious, maybe a little too fatty for me (I had to scrape off way too much), but others at the table gave a thumbs up, so that works for me. As if I wasn't already swooning at this point, dessert puts me over the edge.  I had the rasberry custard with cream cheese foam and graham cracker ice cream - and loved it.   Very fun take on rasberry cheesecake.  You kind of discovered something new with each bite.  The same can be said of the hazelnut bar.  Oh man this was insanely rich and yummy, so many little elements to it, all equally amazing.  The milk chocolate was heaven.  Sheer heaven. And the staff, from the guy at the front desk, to the gal who led us to our table, to the lady who walked me to the restroom rather than just pointing, the bartender, the server, busboy, other servers who helped out - super props to Perennial.  What an awesome team.  And amazing food.  The perfect meal.",0.9993,0.734,0.255,0.012,0.6436826391998806

Perennial joined the Boca Group and as they tend to to, stands out as another tasty restaurant in Chicago.  Located at the interesection of Lincoln, Wells and Clark, it's easy to find, especially with it's outdoor summer patio.  It's nice they have valet for those deciding to park in a neighborhood that's has little in the way of spaces. The interior is play with Bamboo, large windows and curved layout.  Summer days open the windows to allow breezes and fresh air in, creating an outdoor feel.  For a place with the organic name, the atmosphere matches nicely. It was fun to see that for such a classy place, how playful Chef Ryan has made the menu.  Although the lady and I had eggs benedict (perfectly done, oozy and fresh) and my Mother-in-Law had their burger (perfect she said), I wish I had more time/space to try!   Ryan created a menu of unusal staples reorderd.  He took the McGriddle, made it into playful slider sized sandwiches of freshness.  Their french toast and other shared the same twists, and all looked delicious.  I wish I could remember as fully the others, but those little pancake sandwiches brought a smile to my face.

2010-02-19,5.0,"We tried this restaurant over v-day weekend on Saturday night.  I was a bit disappointed with the ambiance at first glance.  I had no idea that the restaurant was located in the lobby of a hotel.  Very strange layout, spread out over three or four rooms, one of which is separated by the building lobby.  Location and ambiance aside, the service and food was excellent! We started with the crudo of hamachi, which was some of the better hamachi I've had.  The truffle gnocchi which I'd read so much about did not disappoint.  Although, the photo posted by one of the users has been dramatically downsized.  I think there were five gnocchi's on my place (for $12 by the way).  But, it was damned tasty. For our entrees, we had the sea bass in a coconut broth.  The broth was very light and the flavors were amazing.  Quite literally, there was a party in my mouth.  It was good.  The cod was simple, but incredibly delicious.  The server explained it as the best fish and chips you'll ever have.  She was right, the cod was very lightly breaded served atop super creamy and delicious potatoes with pearl onions and fingerling potatoes to boot.  It was just right for a later dinner reservation and the lovely Round Pond sauv blanc we had with dinner.   Almost forgot, the pretzel rolls they bring before dinner were legit.  I wished I had mustard! Last but not least, our service was impeccable.  She was prompt, courteous, and gave us time to look over the menu even though we were talking quite a bit before we even had the chance to open our menus.  She pointed me to a less expensive wine first, which I always appreciate. I would definitely return on perhaps a less busy night.  I think the main room has a better feel to it as my only complain was the overall feel of the restaurant.  That said, I cannot knock a star off because the food was just too good.

I would describe this place as a nice little restaurant in Lincoln Park. Very comfortable atmosphere with great service. Dress is very casual. The food is fantastic.

We also had drinks (the Perennial Bellini w/ passion fruit and mimosas). Be forewarned, this is the only thing that I did not like about this restaurant.. the drinks are nothing special and will run you more than the meal (entrees are reasonably priced at around $9).

2010-02-07,3.0,"Curious how the decor is split between the stodgy hotel-bar feeling side and the slightly more fun but conservatively so side that feels like a somewhat hip restaurant.  Our reservation landed us in the stodgy side, looking onto Clark St with Lincoln Park looming in the background.  The walls have *nothing* but paint, and the decor is a huge Ikea-ish piece of furniture with some graceful dried bushes on it.  Wine selections are decent but slanted a little heavily towards the $50+ range.  We enjoyed our selection and server Christopher was helpful here and remained helpful and appropriate throughout.  The staff borders on overly-present.  If the water girl didn't have such a nice smile I would say water was refilled too often. Manager looming around.  Truffled gnocchi was very good. I likely could have fit it all in my mouth at once, if I tried, but cut it into little pieces to enjoy every artfully arranged bit.  The gnocchi themselves are square, which to me says ""efficiency,"" which is exactly what gnocchi is not about. I want meticulously hand rolled little units. Still, it's very tasty. Not too innovative or anything, and some of you are ""over"" truffles, but yum. Side of brussel sprouts -- excellent, simple presentation of hearty portion. Beet salad again, if I tried to, could have been over in seconds.  Little bites.. Arrangement was 'just so' with microgreens, 2 sauces, and i think 10 pieces of beets, in 3 colors, carefully linied up.The goat cheese tart that comes with it was a bit lacking. Portobello carpaccio sans ham (we are vegetarian) was so-so.  The presentation, said by accomplice, and I am inclined to agree, ""looked exactly like vomit.""  Strangely appealing vomit, though. Razor thin sliced of portobello covered in poached garlic and capers, with a listless little pile of so-so spinach on the side.  Smoked tofu with beluga lentil ragout and microgreens.  I could not help but try to figure the food cost on this one -- 4 oz of tofu (60 cents?) and a cup of lentils cooked with carrots and shallots (40 cents?) and a teaspoon of microgreens (10 cents?). Comes out to about 7%, though it is by far the cheapest entree. Oh well. It was pretty tasty, and at the end of the day it's good that an upscale restaurant offers tasty vegetarian food, but it's not nearly as creative as some of the meat dishes. Unfortunately, Perennial recently lost their super-duper pastry chef Carla Corona.  We ventured anyway, ordering  the Hazelnut Crunch.  It was outstanding.  Return for dinner unlikely. The cocktail selections are very nice looking, and I'd stop in for a cocktail and maybe the gnocchi and dessert sometime.",0.995,0.777,0.162,0.062,0.6269702380952382
2010-02-05,4.0,"I've come in a few times for brunch only, typically after attending Sunday service at Moody Bible church down the street. First thing to understand about Perennial is that their entrees are small so it's wise to order a side or two to share if you have a bigger appetite. The cost doesn't match the amount of food, but the plating, skill and ingredients, well I guess it could match those if that means more to you. Most every time I've found the food agreeable and left pleasantly happy. Most every time the same dishes were ordered including: Crab cake eggs Benedict, smoked salmon and potato tart, french toast, duck confit tart and breakfast croquettes for sharing. This combo of items seems to work for me, maybe you'll like it too. I've added some photos for your viewing pleasure and to help you decide. I love the bright decor, colored curtains draped across the ceiling, use of white birch trees, almost every little and last detail has an accent down to the detailed legs of the dining room tables.",0.9927,0.777,0.215,0.008,0.4387626262626263
2010-02-03,4.0,"Perennial was the restaurant of choice for a work team dinner because of it's proximity to / deal with Second City. (if you check out Second City's website, you'll see the option to have a package with reserved seats at the show). As such, it was a Tuesday night that we were here for dinner. The place was...let's just say, with the 10 of us, we were the majority of the people in the entire restaurant. Luckily, this did not turn out to be indicative of the food (moreso, the recession). We were seated promptly (obv; see above) and offered drinks as the rest of our party arrived. Once seated, the prix-fix deal was explained: any 3 things from  4 sections of the menu (app, salad, entree, sides), plus dessert! This seemed reasonable at first, but when we scrutinized the deal and thought about what we would 'really' get if we weren't in a prix-fix situation, it really netted out to be the same price. Anyways, onto the food.  I started with the roasted beet salad, which is a new favorite of mine at nicer restaurants (as they tend not to drown the beets in whatever gross red preservative that is that drips all over Greek salads). I digress. I moved onto the GCM tofu. GCM? Evidently it's the local market they go to and get fresh ingredients from. The tofu was heavenly; lightly sauteed and delicately flavored, with excellent accompaniments. As a side, I got the house mac and cheese without bacon. This was probably the lowlight of the meal; it was good, but not great. For dessert, our side of the table made sure to order one of each and we did dessert family-style (aka one bite each). The hazelnut crunch was marvelous!  The service was on point and they brought in reserves to help with coursing the table; they knew we had to get to an 8:00 show at the theater and did what they needed to in order to make that happen. All in all, it was a great experience and I would consider coming back... perhaps not with the show (time stress) and with a different group of people (drinking stress)!",0.9854,0.836,0.122,0.043,0.4451758969000349

Thus, three of us shared the raspberry cheese cake dessert at the server's suggestion.  It was more like a souffle and sublime.  Nice touch on the complimentary ice cream lollipops and caramels delivered with the check.  Will recommend this place to friends who enjoy fine dining and are not afraid to try some innovative flavor combinations.  Bravo Perennial.",0.995,0.686,0.291,0.024,0.6861904761904762

2010-01-15,5.0,"After many visits to Boka, we finally tried their sister restaurant, Perennial. LOVE IT!  The décor is nice - modern, pleasant, with clean lines but not too upscale. The service is outstanding, both in knowledge and attitude. The wine list is lengthy, with lots of reasonably priced choices. But, like Boka, the food combinations, presentations, freshness, and flavors are the real reason to come to Perennial.  I started with their famous black truffle gnocchi, as raved about in Food and Wine magazine. It's worth the rave. Rather than small pebbles of gnocchi, you get large square cubes, four on a plate. The cubes of gnocchi you can easily split into three bites each, to enjoy with the parsley root puree, hen of the woods mushrooms, and frisee salad. The truffle oil is perfect - just enough to taste it, not so much to overwhelm the other flavors. It really is a great starter, combining flavors wonderfully. Best in America? - not in my book, but definitely outstanding and a must when at Perennial.  For my entrée, I went with the sea scallops, with oxtail raviolini, root vegetables, herbs, and a broth of red wine oxtail jus. The red wine in the sauce complimented the scallops perfectly. Two nicely cooked, delicious large scallops. I also had a taste from my wife's ""pork lover's obsession"" of pork loin, pork belly, and trotter ragout. That was also delicious. For both dishes the main items were well complimented by the other foods on the plate. This isn't the restaurant for purists. It's for tasting interesting combinations and flavors, and they do a great job of it.  For dessert I had their version of cheesecake: raspberry custard, cream cheese foam, and graham cracker ice cream, with whipped cream. Unique, light and not as filling as regular cheesecake, it was the right note on which to end a big meal. And I even had room to take a sample of my wife's crispy hazelnut bar, with pistachio and chocolate ice creams and creme fraiche. Very tasty.  Portion sizes reminded me of Takashi - never large, but plenty to make a full meal. It was nice to not be too full and to consider a cheese course as well as dessert. But I was disappointed they only had four cheeses, all American cheeses, on the menu, and skipped them.  One more comment on the service. We went hoping to have a favorite waiter we've had take great care of us at other restaurants before he came to Perennial. He was off, and instead we got a young waiter named Chris. He was outstanding! Really good, really personable, worth asking for.

My only complaint is that the service was overly attentive.  Even when the restaurant was full, our water cups were topped off every 5 minutes.  Despite the service, I would definitely recommend Perennial for any couple seeking a quiet date spot in Lincoln Park.",0.9873,0.76,0.226,0.014,0.5833333333333334

My boyfriend's boss read in Food & Wine Magazine about how it was the best appetizer in the U.S. of 2009 or whatever and decided to have their company Christmas party here. Thank you, Food & Wine. We had an entire back room with a bar reserved for just the 10 of us. Service was fantastic and never overly attentive. My wine glass was filled without me even realizing it a few times during dinner.  We started with cocktails and passed hors d'oeuvres, which were fantastic. They included some good hamachi sushi, a fried ball of goat cheese and some potato/chorizo thing that was also ridiculous, but in a tasty, deep-fried kind of way.  Once we'd all arrived and chatted, we sat and ordered. I had the truffle gnocchi which was fantastic, as expected.  I also ordered the striped bass on the reco of our server and was happy with it. I don't remember much more than that, so it wasn't super memorable.  I did have the hazelnut crunch dessert that was fantastic. Any dessert that bears a resemblance to a rice krispie treat, includes hazelnuts, chocolate and pistachio ice cream is okay by me.  Maybe the 5th star was added since I wasn't handed a bill at the end of the evening, but I couldn't find anything wrong with the meal besides not remembering much about my entree except that I really enjoyed it.

Environment:  Perennial is very nicely decorated.  Tables have enough space between them, allowing for private conversations.  It's not too loud, even though this place is definitely hot right now.  The trees inside the restaurant are a nice touch.  Tables by the windows are the premium seats - but keep in mind that lights from cars driving south on Lincoln Ave can actually be a bit annoying. Food:  Great contemporary American food.  I had the scallops with braised meat ravioli - excellent!  My girlfriend had a fish dish - very fresh.  The portions and taste are perfectly priced here.  Entrees range from low $20s to about $30.  Oh yeah, get the pineapple cake dessert - I forget the name, but it was a must-have!

It came with some slices of pork loin and then two large pieces of the pork belly. My stomach is growling just typing these words. It was pretty outstanding. It came with a side of potato puree which was nice as well. I also sampled the cod which is sous vide and served in a broth with root vegetables. It was also very nice.

It is not your traditional potato gnocchi instead it is a lighter Roman style. We also shared a tasty green salad with shaved zucchini and mint and pecorino - also excellent! The tofu dish exceeded my expectations and my husband's filet was perfectly done (plus a potato pancake on the side was yummy). We finished with a hazelnut crunch dessert that was really delectable.

Our waitstaff was awesome and everything was served in a timely manner and with a smile. the decor is very new age chic, which I'm not into, but is quite eye catching.  As for the food....I love the concept, but I'm not into food just for the interesting plating and seasonal freshness.  First, we ordered a cheese plate which had adorable little garnishes, which didn't really seem to have any sort of flavor compatibility with the cheese--though they were tasty. My burbon drink was put hair on your chest strong and well worth the 12 dollars but, mistakenly served in a martini glass ( yes, the glass matters)-- to seem more posh I supposed--rather than in the lowball it should have been served in.  Then we had our main dishes. I had the salmon, which was a 4x5x1"" piece of meat with a line of halved vegetables flanking it's side. It was perfectly cook and delicately seasoned, but  it was boring, the vegetables well...were halved heirloom tomatoes that didn't add anything to the dish except color... and the portions were just too tiny...my 5 yr old niece would have still been hungry after that!  Then we had dessert which was ""cheesecake"" or cream cheese mousse with some sort of frozen graham cracker-ish tasting chip and raspberry sauce...I'm not even going to go into how disappointing that was. Basically, this place is gorgeous and they really do have some quality ingredients, but  I spent $50 on dinner and I had to have a snack when i got home. The tiny, poorly paired dishes and putting every cocktail in a martini glass just makes me call you...pretentious.",0.9887,0.802,0.149,0.048,0.5195221445221444

For the main dish, I went with the organic pork belly and the flavor was amazing. The meat was so tender and the grilled peach and spinach were great touches. Just a great meal. For a side, friends split the mac and cheese with house bacon and that was also delicious. The bacon was just perfect and the mac and cheese was tasty without being too heavy. Oh and the prosecco was delicious too. I had a bite of the salmon, which was very good, and the grilled tofu, which had a nice flavor but was...well tofu.

I consider myself to be something of a food snob, and an aspiring chef, so I will preface my review by saying that I have very high standards when it comes to food, and Perennial did not disappoint. The ambiance was incredible - high ceilings with tarps and trees indoors - a very creative way of bringing the outside to the inside. It made the place seem bigger than it is, and also more open and airy, even though we were indoors (if that makes sense?). There is also plenty of outdoor seating, but we decided to try indoors first.  They have a great cocktail menu, and while my mojito was a little too sweet, after adding a touch of soda it was perfect. The flavors were a little different from your normal mojito, in the best way possible. You could also tell the mint and limes were fresh, something you don't taste in most mojitos in Chicago. Their wine selection was also very good - I had a Chenin-Blanc/Viognier combo that was delicious, and Scuba Steve's Cabernet was also excellent. We started with the Chicken Lollipops and Risotto - the Lollipops were amazing and I could have easily eaten 5 on my own, and the Risotto was incredible...a mouth-watering, sumptuous, and balanced blend of lemon, creaminess, and herbs.  I had the Scallops, which came with a short rib-stuffed canelloni - their version of the surf-and-turf, I was told by the waiter....and it was excellent. The scallops were perfectly cooked, and the canneloni was a great complement. Scuba Steve had the Chicken and Dumplings, which was not what we expected in terms of looks, but in terms of taste was terrific. Our friend Mark had the Spinach Cannelloni, which would be an excellent vegetarian option, not the only one I thought would be available to vegetarians (there are a couple!).  Dessert was a lighter-than-air Raspberry Cheesecake with Graham Cracker Ice Cream...cheesecake is generally my favorite dessert, but this particular one is my second all-time fave because it was so light but so rich in flavor.

As for the appetizers we had the lemon risotto and the chicken lollipops. It's hard to say which was better as both were very good. The risotto was rich and creamy with just a hint of lemon, while the chicken drumsticks were some of the best asian influenced wings I've had in a while. We also had the delicious portobella mushroom carpaccio salad that consisted of thin slices of portobella topped with capers, serrano ham and tons of poached garlic. For mains we had the hamachi, scallops and pork belly. The hamachi was fine but I like it a lot better raw as it seems to lose some of its flavor after being cooked (the sauce that was drizzled on top definitely helped though). The scallops were awesome, but my favorite was definitely the pork belly. It was cooked perfectly with nice crisp edges yet still tender on the inside. The dessert almost stole the show though. The ""cheesecake"" was not your typical cake, but still after taking a bite the flavors came together to give you the same taste.

2009-04-28,3.0,"Continuing the my quest to try all of the ""Time Out Chicago"" list of 100 things to eat in 2008, I came across Perennial.  l'm always going by this restaurant, wanting to go in every time I see it. Owners Rob Katz and Kevin Boehm could not have chosen a more perfect location.  Directly across from Lincoln Park and to the north side of old town,  noticed from Clark St and Wells by the locals of both neighborhoods alike.  This place is definitely sure to continually bring in groups seeking an amazing brunch and dinner. The outdoor patio makes it a perfect setting to enjoy the nice breeze in a not so over active part of the city.  There is plenty of sunshine inside and out.  So why only three stars? The staff couldn't have been friendlier and more helpful.  We were seated promptly in a great spot next to the large floor to ceiling windows. Ah yes, the food.  Time Out Chicago is obviously not the only place I have heard of Perennial.  They are a very highly recommended, complemented restaurant by wbbm Phil Vettel and is noticed in many other resources. Everything on the menu sounds very intriguing and interesting.  I thought to myself, I could not go wrong with any of this.  We started with the Glazed Wings, which were highly recommended by our server over everything else on the starters list.  Okay, we ordered them.  They were pretty good. Crispy, sweet, a little citrusy, which I liked.  They were in the form of lollipops, which is also very chic and almost innovative. I mean they are chicken wings, how innovative do we need to be? To tell you the truth though, if I wanted asian chicken wings to be recommended while I'm out on my culinary fleet, I would have gone to Crisp for the Seoul Sassy wings.  Partially my fault for ordering this starter. Of course for the main entree, I HAD to get the   SEA SCALLOPS WITH SHORT-RIB CANNELLONI.  It was on the list of 100, it must be amazing.  As shown in the picture by another person who reviewed Perennial, the presentation couldn't be more appealing.  Just the sound of this dish made me salivate.  I took a bite of the scallop.  Nice buttery, soft and delicate texture.  Seared to perfection.  The tarragon sabayon and wild mushrooms did not add much to the dish, other than for aesthetics and to keep the dry cannelloni as moist as it could be.  I took a bite of the cannelloni expecting a surge of different flavors to hit! Nothing. It was exactly what it said it was.  Short rib stuffed into a pasta shell.  Nothing special at all.  The short rib was not succulent, and the pasta shell was not the texture which I would expect to find in my grandmas kitchen, or anywhere in Italy.  My brother called it a ""poorly done enchilada."" His flat iron steak on the other hand was excellent.  Prepared to perfection with a nice pink center in an amazing black pepper bordelaise. Now for dessert.  Well when will we ever be back? We have to try something.  Probably not a wise decision, but we took them to go.  I ordered what I thought to be the Hazlenut Crunch, which I was pretty excited to try out. My brother ordered the Cheesecake, which was actually a raspberry sorbet with cream cheese foam and graham cracker ice cream. Sounds unreal!  We pay for the tab, and take a cab back to my place, tear open the boxes and I look curiously at mine.  It has a few pieces of chocolate candies. hmm?  I look back at their menu on the internet, only to find that they gave me the Chocolate Creamux instead.  I was extremely disappointed.  However the olive oil caramel topping did bring a nice ilttle savory ah hah to my palate, it was not what I ordered.  The did not critique the ""cheese cake"" to the fullest.  I did take it to go, and eat it in a plastic dish.  However, I couldn't really find much ice cream in the concoction, which we were both looking forward to.  It must have melted into the cheese foam by the time we got back. Carrying many high expectations and hopes from this dinner tonight, I was not satisfied. I was more discouraged to continue the journey to finish the rest of the top 100 list if anything.  I will however be back to Perennial with a open mind for the rest of what Executive Chef Ryan Poli has in store for me.",0.9937,0.856,0.115,0.029,0.5529406991260923

2009-04-14,3.0,"Perennial: persisting for several years (Webster Dict.) Just like a great restaurant experience should be.  Well ok - let's make it a few months instead of several years. We all know on here that food love (or lust) is not forever. But no. Perennial it won't be for me. It started off well though and when I came in frozen to the bones I was delighted to be welcomed by a warm hostess, a hot decor and a sizzling cocktail menu. The days of gloomy Bar Louie are long gone! Hurray for the makeover - the place is a knock-out. Like I feel on a date waiting for my hubby. Best of feelings.  After much hesitation - Royal Lavender? Blood Orange Margarita? Kill the Queen? - I decided on a Vanilla Ginger Mojito that was quite tasty but a little too watered down. Call me alcoholic but I wanted something more punchy. Oh well. I waited two minutes at the bar and didn't have my first sip when I was joined by my Reubs of the night. Perfect timing. Table: close to the window, surrounded by candles, facing a glorious two-sided fireplace. I am screaming in my head: YAY!!! And then the food. - bread: I understand that you don't want to stuff yourself with stupid carbs when you are waiting for your meal but serve one slice at the time? Me think not. - appetizer: the menu was tempting and we had the hardest time picking something up. Finally chose the black truffle gnocchi served with butternut squash, swiss chard and frisee. I almost fainted from disappointment when I saw our plate. 2 tiny pieces of gnocchi, 2 micro cubes of squash, 1/10 oz of greens.....for $12. I felt like a fish out of the water and couldn't articulate a word. Even if it was pretty good the truffle didn't come through and damn - the whole plate would only make a bite in my world. Big bummer. - main dishes: I got the scallops special and I couldn't complain too much. They were really good, perfectly cooked and caramelized. Good wild mushroom. The  short rib cannolini was really dry but tasty. The whole thing was lukewarm though. Another bad point. But the real killer of the night was the hamashi. It was almost disgusting. Dry, overcooked, under seasoned - a piece of fish from a very bad kitchen. I just couldn't believe it. How can you do such a bad job and consider yourself a dinner destination?!?!? Didn't get it.... I was so bitter that I almost wanted to skip dessert - which was the saving grace of the place. The two chocolate creations we chose were both original and well executed - and I particularly liked the mix of textures in mine (the hazelnut crunch). The olive oil in the chocolate cremeux is just a touch of genius: slightly congealed under the lovely little mounts of dark chocolate dusted with sea salt it's a symphony of flavors that all wonderfully combine in your mouth. Horrible, horrible coffee. Burned and bitter. So yes...3 stars at best - it's what you get Perennial for wasting my lovely romantic night. Get a grip and some consistency and I may be back.

2009-04-13,3.0,"When faced with the daunting task of finding a place to eat with my wife, I usually give my best ostrich impersonation and try to bury my head in the sand and let enough time pass to where I don't have to deal with it. You see- I don't like the task of decision making in general, but especially when it comes to our dinner plans. With us, dinner is almost always the main part of our evening and therefore our expectations on a good evening tend to rely heavily on how good the meal is.  To make matters worse, I have had some doozy dinner picks that lets just say have left us wanting more. In the past I would say my batting average for good quality restaurant picks have been below expectations. It is actually the main thing that had drawn me towards Yelp in the first place.  Even with the wonderful guidance that Yelp has given to me, I still quiver at the news that it is my duty and responsibility to find a good place to eat. To give my wife the credit she deserves, this past Friday she ended up narrowing down my choices.  I still failed. Somewhat at least.  It wasn't so much that Perennial was bad, because to say that it is a bad restaurant would not be accurate. There were some hits and misses- much like my track record for dinner choices.  To start, the decor is quite nice. It reminded me a bit of my favorite boutique hotel (at least in my very limited hotel experiences)- Hotel Andra in Seattle. Very modern, dark woods mixed with some natural wall colors, and other natural elements like wooden trunks forming a room divider. Music was very nice, and at a good volume to create atmosphere. I was greeted by a trio of hostesses/managers in a very friendly manner. My wife had met me there after a very long day of work for both of us and had already begun her evening with a drink.  After being seated at a table for two along the windows over looking Lincoln Park, I ordered something called ""Kill the Queen"" with our very friendly waiter. The cocktail was excellent. Perfect mixture of alcohol, sweet, tangy, and aromatic flavorings. Probably the best cocktail I have ever had. So far, the night is going well.  We ordered a starter- the gnocchi, and while it was good, the portion was incredibly tiny. We did split the order (priced at $8 or $9), but when two plates came out with two gnocchis on it, with a sprig of frisee, a little bit of sauce, and that was all? Not sure how to describe the experience. The taste was very good- but the portion could have been and probably should have been placed on a spoon and been called an amuse. Tiny.  Aurore ordered the scallops for her main and they were very well cooked. The flavors of the scallops in my opinion were perfectly sweet and the accompaniments went well with them.  I ordered the himachi (something I am now a sucker for since a meal I had in SF at Bar Crudo- one of the few good picks for dinner that I have made). This on the other hand was just, well, short of anything good. The mushroom and broccolini mixture was good, but the broccolini left a bit too much bitterness for the fish. It was served table side with a coconut milk poured into the dish. That sauce would have been unnecessary if the fish was properly cooked. In the end, it was definitely needed.  I can't understand what exactly went wrong with the fish- but it was just bad. I think it was cut too thick to begin with, and pan seared on way too low of a temp. Because of this, the cook must have cooked it longer in order to get a good seer, but it came out tough.  Honestly- tough fish. Kind of like canned tuna. Such a shame.  At this point- a good cocktail, and good conversation with wonderful company is all that was holding up the evening. Portions being too small and my ruined fish was weighing down on our evening hard, but the saving grace was dessert.  Both of our desserts came out with what we were looking for- a little bit of inventiveness with great taste. I ordered the Chocolate Creamux- which ended up being more salty and savory than sweet, but in the best way possible. A delicious blend of cocoa nibs, sea salt and a ""firmed"" olive oil (yes, olive oil) all brought together in a beautiful dish. With the waiters recommendation, my wife ordered the hazelnut crunch, which also ended up being very good.  But then there was the coffee. Something unforgivable to me. If you have ever had your oil changed at Jiffy Lube and tried some of that complimentary coffee- this was actually the watered down version of that crap. It literally brought a bitter scowl to Aurore's face and was enough to ruin what was a really good dessert session.  In the end we walked out of Perennial confused. How could such a good space, obviously well-staffed/managed, with a promising menu, great cocktails be such a disappointment? They somehow did it though. I would go back only if I were in the area and wanted dessert and that delicious cocktail.  ""Kill the Queen"" made it three-star worthy.",0.9991,0.707,0.201,0.092,0.5400979986197377

As a fan of the straightforward dirty martini, I was not disappointed to venture out of the box for a ""Kill the Queen"" and ""Pristine Waters."" The salad with bacon and egg was perfect. The lemon risotto was really really nice (clean, simple). I'm a huge duck fan, so I got the duck -- particularly as it was served with bread pudding. After the cocktails and starters, the duck was admittedly a bit of a letdown. The ""bread pudding"" was very liberally interpreted as it was really pan-fried bread cubes (a little dry) and they were a bit too ""thymey."" The cabbage served with the duck cut through the natural heaviness of the bird but something else was needed too (since the bread pudding fell so short). But, the duck was cooked very nicely and indeed as it was duck, it was good. My girlfriend got the scallops which were excellent. We got the cheese cake for dessert. A wacky little deconstructed number with cream cheese foam and a raspberry custard, it was pretty good. This place pushes creativity how I like it. You gain some latitude for some things that may not work out when the atmosphere is beautiful, the drinks are phenomenal, you nail the starters, the prices are reasonable, and your service is top-notch.

We closed the night with a deconstructed cheesecake.  It was light, it was fluffy, it was unbelievable.  A soft light cheesecake with a graham cracker ice cream served over a raspberry custard.  For someone who was so full, I couldn't say no.   I've already booked another night.  Thank you Perennial for adding a little luxury to the neighborhood.

The place still looks good in the day light, which can't be said for everything in Chicago. If you've never been, it has a really interesting decor with tree trunks in the middle of the room with a lightly shaded bark on them. The room has some cool fabric covering the ceiling giving it somewhat of a casual feel almost whimsical. C and I also got an awesome table in the corner with windows on all sides so we could watch the snow come down sideways as we enjoyed our drinks and brunch.  Here's the thing, there are some slightly better brunch places that I've been to in town, but this place is still really good and worth the a try. The Bloody Marys were great and my screwdriver was pretty clear, which is never a bad thing and their coffee is great. We shared their version of a mcgriddle and it was awesome, but sorry to disappoint some of you... the syrup was on the side, but never the less very tasty, you get four of them so its a perfect way to start brunch. C got the biscuits and gravy that came with a poached egg on top. The gravy wasn't all gross and heavy but nice and light, like the biscuits, with little pieces of sausage....ummmm!! I got the porkbelly, mushroom omelet, which tasted great expect that the egg part was a little drier than I like, but the smokey sweet taste of the porkbelly more than made up for it. Since there was only two of us we skipped the traditional dessert portion of brunch. I will however say that we saw some of those entries and they looked great. Service was excellent!

2009-02-26,4.0,"My dinner here was pretty darn amazing. I highly recommend starting (or making a meal out of) the sweet corn risotto. You can definitely taste the truffle oil and the parsley gives the dish an extra pop of flavor at the end of a bite. I also recommend the cheesecake. This is not your traditional cheesecake at all and that's what makes it so good!  The only reason why Perennial didn't get 5 stars was because I was not wowed by the braised spinach cannelloni or mac & cheese. The cannelloni was 'ok'. Because the sweet corn risotto was just so good,  the next course didn't follow up with the same greatness.

I got the impression there was a mix up about who ordered what).  But the manager even came over and checked in.  We also thought their wine menu was pretty good.  Seeing the ""faves"" on the back was fun. What wasn't as good: Although we knew the menu would be prix-fix, they didn't have a preview of it available on the website.  We were surprsied to see that there were only two options for both the appetizer and main course, and for the second and dessert courses, there was only one option.  Also, my friend ordered the salmon and it was undercooked.  Visibly undercooked.  Unfortunately, she didn't eat much of it and by the time I noticed it to say something, she was done.",0.9755,0.849,0.139,0.012,0.5670833333333334

2009-01-31,2.0,"Ever notice how many places say they are full, so you accept an early reservation, and when you leave the place is half full? Thanks, we appreciate that.  This was formerly occupied by Topo Gigio, then Bar Louie. The room is very well decorated in a sort of 60s trendy vintage way. Others have posted interior photos above.  Service was excellent.  The food? Well, it just wasn't that great. I started with a gnocchi truffle appetizer ($12). The ""gnocchi"" were squares cut out of a pan (see photo). They were good enough, but the squash that accompanied them just tasted like grease to me. The portion was very small - four gnocchi about the size of Frango mints. Very well presented, though.  I had the Berkshire Pork-belly ($22) which in itself was good enough -- a sort of uncured bacon cut -- after stripping the fat away, I had around two forks of pork. Again, the mustard spaetzle that accompanied the dish was just kind of nothing tasting. I gave it to my companion, who turned her nose up to it after one bite. She had the scallops, 3 for $23 and the cannelloni that came with it was mismatched with seafood. Our passion fruit dessert was out of this world. Truly amazing.  The bill was $130 pre-tip, two drinks each. That was a painful tab back in the strong economy, and hard to justify these days.

2009-01-26,3.0,"So, I HATE writing bad reviews since they often end up just sounding bitchy, but I was pretty disappointed today.  Of course, this should be prefaced by the fact that my expectations were pretty high...I have been out of the country for 10 months, without access to American breakfasts/brunches, and so spent an hour picking out the ideal spot to brunch this morning.  I'm born and raised here, so have my favorites, but wanted somewhere new, and Perennial won out.  And all I can say is, I wish I'd gone to Orange.  And that hopefully today was just an off day. Positives: Excellent cappuccinos, lovely separation of foam from the dark espresso.  Good fresh-squeezed orange juice.  Friendly and attentive wait staff--unfaultable service, really.  And a lovely atmosphere, right on Lincoln Park, sunny and perfect for a Sunday.   But.  The food was decent.  That's it, really.  Just ok, completely unmemorable.  We ordered the Eggs Benedict with duck confit, a spinach-feta egg white omelet, and the Green Market basket.  I'd heard about the use of Green Market veggies and was excited, but all they served in the parmesan crisp basket was a small portion of ratatouille that was far from satisfying my companion's appetite, with no side.  The eggs benedict was my dish, and I missed it so much I was basically content, but the duck confit, while moist, tasted only of salt, and wasn't an especially good complement to the poached egg.  The side of mixed greens were also heavily oversalted.  The omelet had very little filling (perhaps they'd run out??), and the egg whites had been overbeaten and tasted like cardboard.  We've been doing egg white omelets for over a decade now, people.  They aren't that hard.  The side of patatas bravas was good, nicely spicy. So...maybe the chef was hungover.  Or was having a bad hair day.  But for a place that touts its use of fresh and local ingredients to skimp on them, and then not use them sensitively--oversalting and underseasoning-- seemed a bit odd to me.  So...maybe I'll try them again, for drinks and appetizers, to give their evening menu a try.   And finally, it's worth saying that my brunch experience was overall a positive one...a lovely location, friendly staff, and good companions tend to do that :)  But that perhaps brunch is not the time to check out Perennial.",0.9977,0.698,0.226,0.076,0.5595009157509158

I have to start off by saying I have been really disappointed of late with the quality of food being served at some of Chicago's supposedly higher end restaurants. So I came here not wanting to get my hopes up, but everything about this place was amazing. I liked the way the restaurant was set up. No long line of tables all on top of each other like most places these days. I hate that feeling that the party next to you can reach over and eat off your plate, or take part in your conversation.   The waitstaff was wonderful. Our waiter was very helpful and steered us towards a very lovely bottle of wine. We had the risotto and the gnocchi appetizers, both of which were quite tasty. We then shared the arugula salad. nothing special here, but nothing to complain about. We had the scallop entree and the chicken entree. Both were truly FANTASTIC!! I haven't had  food that delicious in a long time. We had to take a break because we were soo stuffed, but I wouldn't let them take the food away until I finished every bite!!! Lastly we had the hazelnut crunch dessert, which was fabulous.  The bill came, and for all that food and nice bottle of wine, was still under $200, not bad at all. The waiter brought us beautiful little cookies and bon bons with the check that were just amazing as well. I couldn't believe how great everything was!!

2008-12-20,3.0,"Dined here last night for the first time.  I had really high expectations because of what my co-workers had told me about this place.  I just recently moved to chicago and haven't had a fine dining experience yet.   I am just not sure what to say about this place.  Is Perennial considered fine dining?  It would really help with my rating.  So here goes my experience...I will look at it categorically and give my rating based on an average. Cheesy decor, rackety furniture, and cheesy lighting...although I think the nanawall will be great in the summer.  1 star (since I was here in winter) Super attentive staff all-around, the staff is what makes the dining so fine. 5 stars The food was pretty good. Maybe if my co-workers hadn't built it up so much, I would have been more pleasantly suprised.   But I do think it tried a little to hard and was slightly overpriced.   Our group started with the Crab claws, the Carpaccio, the wings, and the charcuterie.  The carpaccio was amazing, the charcuterie was nicely plated, the rest was just normal.  I would have like to try the corn risotto, maybe next time.  I then had the house salad which was also normal.   I ordered the California Hamachi which I think on their online menu is the  Grilled Cobia.  When it came out, I was suprised to see that it was a large piece of salmon with a tiny shrimp on top.  Which is fine...I like salmon.  But the menu should have mentioned it.  The bok choy, mussel and coconut broth were a great combo.   Our table also shared the Mac and Cheese, the sweet potatos, the mashed potatos, and the ratatouille.  The sweet potatos are sweeter than you think.  Consider them for dessert.   I didn't love the Mac and Cheese, and was suprised to see it on the menu.  But this is Chicago, they serve Mac and Cheese everywhere.  Why is that?   The ratatouille was yummy, but I've had better (Venice, CA  frenchmarket-cafe.com )   For dessert I only tried the cheescake, which is oh so yummy.  It's not a cheesecake at all, it is light and refreshing and I didn't want to share it with anyone, but I had to ...so I will definitely go back to have my own.   So I give the food 3 stars which comes to a grand total of 3 stars.  Maybe when I go there this summer to enjoy the nanawall and things I would have liked to ordered (instead of group ordering) the rating will go up.",0.9923,0.84,0.132,0.028,0.6065027605244996
2008-11-25,5.0,"I've been so incredibly excited to write this review. While I was in the middle of dinner, I claimed to my friend that my Yelp review of Perennial would be one word: orgasm. While I think that about sums it up, I'll elaborate, because I will take any chance I can get to re-live this food experience. I'm pretty sure this is one of the top 5 restaurants I've been to in Chicago. We went to check out their menu for last week's Appetite Stimulus from OpenTable. It was $35 for a 3-course meal, though we ordered even more stuff (naturally) so I think price-wise it evened out. We had a great little table by the window, loved the ambiance of the place -- there were people there just to drink, and people there to drink while stuffing their faces (us). So ...here it goes: Drinks -- started with a vanilla ginger mojito. YUM. The Amuse Bouche -- loved it. A shot of red pepper gazpacho soup, served with a slice of manchego cheese and chorizo on a cracker (i'm sure there is a fancier name for what it was served on ...cracker is all i got right now).  Course #1 -- Crispy Veal Breast. Thank you to the reviews below for leading me to this -- it wasn't part of the prie fix menu, but we had to try it. And it was melt-in-your-mouth good. I didnt even mind the layer of fat that was in it ...cuz I'm pretty sure that had something to do with the amazing taste. That, and the hint of vanilla. Was served with some cute little baby carrots and turnips that were cooked perfectly.  Course #2 -- Sweet Corn Risotto. Let me preface this with the fact that I will eat risotto anytime, anywhere, on anything. And each and every time, i will lick the bowl clean. This was no different. It was very, very rich (my friend thought almost too rich ...but what the F does he know), but the combination of the risotto, the oh so sweet corn and the white truffle oil was perfect, in my opinion.  Main Course -- Scallops with short rib cannelloni. Probably the most perfectly cooked scallops I have ever had (I may have said that in a review on here before, but i'm serious this time). But that wasn't the best part. There was this short rib cannelloni gratin ...thing. I dont even really know what it was besides short ribs inside, but daaaaamn. It was fab.  Side dish -- what? We were hungry and wanted to try the mac and cheese. And though I could only fit a few bites in, it was creamy deliciousness -- i would go back just to order that for lunch.  Dessert -- by this time in the meal, i was having a hard time moving. I thought to myself, I should say we dont want the dessert cuz im not even going to eat it, but I'll be polite. They brought out our ""cheese cake"" ....and I think I lost it. Cream cheese foam, graham cracker ice cream, raspberry mousse ...Cut to me ""politely"" licking as much as I could off my spoon.  Even though I have recently made a pact to myself that I am not allowed to go to restaurants I have already been to ...i might have to break it and drag my BF here. It's just that amazing. Maybe I can hold out until summer to sit on their awesome outdoor patio ...but let's face it, i am not the master of my domain.",0.9985,0.802,0.172,0.026,0.5791309523809525

The meal was paced perfectly if you like to dine (like I do) and the food is excellent, and very rich.  Both of our starters (sweet corn risotto and crispy veal breast) were delicious and the entrees (scallops and duck) were cooked to perfection.  The wine that the manager recommended was a great compliment to the meal as well.  I have to say, the dessert was amazing, if you go, definitely try the cheesecake with graham cracker ice cream.  Delish! I would only knock off 1/2 star because our server went MIA for a while after he took our order and my wine glass was empty throughout the starter course.  The manager finally came over to make sure everything was alright and I was able to order through him.  Not that big a deal, but what can I say...I like wine.

2008-11-05,4.0,"Just a quick note before we begin.... the Perennial menu online is not up-to-date and hasn't been for some time. Oddly, they don't choose to keep it current reflecting their changes from season to season, so for those who love to peruse and ponder what they're going to order before hitting up a new spot, don't do it here. I was a wee bit disappointed when a few things I'd been yearning for were nowhere to be found on the menu, but fortunately, they still had plenty of unique and tasty items in store for me.  Perennial and it's menu can best be described as sleek minimalist. From the polished dark wood floors and white birch trunks that appear to hold up the ceiling to the small portion servings on big, bold plates painted and primed with creams and foams, this certainly isn't your Grandpas restaurant. Leave him and his Metamucil at home, this is a spot for a sizzling date... the make-out corner table is a must! As a matter of fact, the Days Inn that used to house this now trendy Park View hotel space is hardly recognizable - an entirely better use of the high end real estate that's for sure - Perennial is much more at home on this quiet corner of Lincoln than Bar Louie ever was.  Our servers were attentive and knowledgeable, but completely unobtrusive. I love that. Get in. Get my order. Get my food. Get lost. Ok, a few bars of witty banter is not lost on me, but lingering is. The Perennial crew had a nice balance of both although I could have seen the bread girl a bit more... they serve you from a carb tray one tiny piece at a time. After the first serving she never returned which was a bit of a bummer, she clearly didn't know she was dealing with Brett the Bread Monster.  The food was exceptionally good! Not a flavor dud in the bunch. I was, however, slightly disappointed to have all 3 of our apps arrive at the table at once. I should know better by now and just specify that I prefer things timed differently, but at a restaurant of this caliber I expect them to know that already and not assume I want to pummel through 3 dishes as fast as I can so they don't get cold. The seasonal tart of pumpkin, mission fig and goat cheese with micro-greens was phenomenal... a 'lil punkin pie with chevre?! Fuggehdaboutit. Heavenly!! The black truffle gnocchi with butternut squash was crazy heavy on the truffle (pulling at my heartstrings!!) but I can see how it may be a bit intense for a truffle-shy gal... being the smallest in portion, you just get a few small bites of that nice strong taste though. The topper, to me, was the sweet corn risotto. Mmmmmm sweet corn, savory rice, cheesy, herby, truffly (yes, again) and positively delicious. The bowl was huge and it was licked clean... no sense in wasting good truffle! I highly recommend you get a plate to lick on your own if you're planning a visit...  Our entrees were equally as good, however, the grass fed beef with potato cake and brussel sprouts, a special for the evening, was teeny-tiny. Literally 5 bites of meat and that was all she wrote - it was embarrassingly obvious that anyone (especially a full grown man) would be dissatisfied with this 2 inch piece of cow and since I didn't see a kiddie menu, I think this was intended for adult consumption, sadly. The taste was fabulous but unfortunately couldn't overcome the laughable micro portion. It was a tad strange though considering my duck breast with herb bread pudding in foie gras emulsion was served in plenty... I couldn't even polish off half so the share factor was great. My duck breast was moist and crispy and the sauce was TO DIE FOR. Apparently we need more liver in sauce?! Wrap up these yummy selections with the highly recommended (via Carol K.) deconstructed raspberry cheesecake dessert and you have a great destination for dining well.

I had agnolotti for my entree which can also be split for an appetizer-- it was fresh, well made pasta.  the dessert was fabulous, a sort of deconstructed chocolate mousse. Salt, olive oil, bread, and chocolate.  really what impressed me were details. (high quality unsalted butter to go with bread they passed out. a nice waiter, great dessert, great cocktails. i would go back more often if i could afford it.)  Tip! Park on wells in the treasure island/second city parking lot. $7 Weeknights, $9 weekends. there's always room.",0.9967,0.656,0.335,0.008,0.6621536796536795
2008-07-30,4.0,"Like everyone mentioned, great patio...There is nothing better than dining al fresco on a perfect summery night. We had a great experience.  From the food to the wine and finally, the ambiance-perfect. The only thing we found incredibly odd was one server. She came over and in an overly theatrical tone announced, ""I would like to bring you some water"". My friends and I were trying soo hard not to laugh. Luckily, we had a different server take care of us. I would highly recommend checking this place out.",0.9429,0.651,0.238,0.11,0.605
2008-07-28,4.0,"Nice.  Perfect evening.  Great company.  And a new restaurant that pulled it off while only being open for less than a month. Perennial is in the old Bar Louie space in the new Park View hotel (we couldn't remember the name of the hotel before but suffice it to say it wasn't worth remembering)  Windows frame the north side with views of Lincoln Park and up Lincoln Ave.  We were quickly seated and immediately had a cast of servers ready to take care of us with the manager visible in the background.  Very nice. We were on a fast pace as we had tickets to a concert and I was a little concerned about being able to eat our meal and still make the concert in time.  No problem, said our server and he made it so.  Even to the point of getting the valet to bring up our car when we were ready to leave. It was quick without making us ever feel rushed. Perennial serves up American cuisine in a great space.  We started with a wide range of the appetizers- from the gazpacho soup (very good served with slivered cucumbers and an olive crouton, to the wings (can you tell I was eating with men?), pate plate and shrimp risotto (my favorite, warm and creamy)  The chef also sent out a complimentary starter of fried duck something or other (delicious even if I can't remember the name of what it was!) We each had a salad but the winner of the night had to be the mushroom carpaccio salad which was wonderful.  I had the peekytoe crab salad which while good paled to the mushrooms and my other friend had a simple arugula salad. As for the entrees we tried three.  I had the scallops served with mushrooms which was wonderful.  My one friend had the strip steak (looked more like a rib eye) but  it was flavorful and my other friend had the lamb special of the day which again was the clear winner.  Two lamb chops along with the braised neck of lamb were tender and delicious.  Not to leave anything untasted- we also tried the whipped potatoes (could have eaten the whole bowl) the mac and cheese (interesting with edamame) the green beans (not for me) and a complimentary heirloom tomato and watermelon salad (also not for me but it was interesting) Even though we were in a hurry- we took the time to taste dessert.  The chef sent out this interesting dessert which I will never do justice in my explanation.  Picture graham cracker ice cream surrounded by whipped cream on a bed of raspberry mousse topped with a cookie of some type.  Definitely calorie worthy! You ought to check out Perennial.  The food, and the service make for a memorable evening.",0.9986,0.768,0.204,0.027,0.5873404856013552
2008-07-21,2.0,"Had a nice dinner on the patio here a few nights ago.  (I would rate it a solid 2.5 stars, but I cannot quite bring myself to round up.  Hence the two-star review.)  For a new restaurant, and one getting a bit of buzz, I was pleasantly surprised that we only waited 3-4 minutes for our 8:30 pm reservation, especially as the place was rather packed.  We opted for the (spacious) patio rather than the (very noisy) interior.  (Although if it were winter, I would have been happy to sit under the birch trees in restaurant.  The interior was lovely.)  The tables outside were not packed together, which was a welcome change.  I thought that I'd get a face full of bus fumes every few minutes, but the patio is set back from the street just enough to avoid that. On to the food: Mostly good, some of it was trying to be slightly innovative.  However, nothing inspired me to book a return any time soon.  Specifics: The yellow tomato gazpacho was very well done; there was a lot of flavor packed into that soup!  I particularly enjoyed the addition of little pickled ribbons of cucumbers as a garnish.  Added some depth of flavor.  After that, I was less impressed.  The bread offering was a completely bland ""French baguette,"" similar to what one could purchase at Jewel.  Disappointing.   My fiancee said that his risotto starter reminded him of Chef Boy-ar-dee.  I agreed that the almost- artificial taste of the tomato was aggressively similar to that canned childhood favorite.  The roasted chicken was nicely prepared, but nothing too innovative.  The semolina beet gnocchi (gnocchi made of beets and semolina flour) had a unfortunate purple appearance.  I'm still not entirely certain if I liked them, but they were at least a new approach to the same old beet-and-goat-cheese salad that everyone does these days.  We also had a side of macaroni and cheese -- I try this at every restaurant lately -- and I was disappointed.  Again, an attempt at a fresh approach with shell pasta and edamame, but I really couldn't taste cheese in the bland and miserly portion of bechamel sauce poured over the pasta.    Not worth the calories, unfortunately.  We did not have dessert, so I cannot comment on the sweets. We ordered wine by the glass, and there were some nice selections, including a Mourvedre, which you just don't see by the glass very often. The service was friendly and efficient, but not overly polished.   The bathroom was a complete mess by 10:00 pm, which is unacceptable. I would go back if I were in the neighborhood, but probably would not make a special trip.",0.9911,0.753,0.163,0.084,0.5542014533085962
2008-07-18,5.0,Great restaurant in perfect location.Wow!  The outdoor patio is perfect for people watching or enjoying a nice Chicago summer day and the bar area rocks.  There's also a secret bar in the back which has it's own lounge area that's more quiet if you want to escape the scene.  Perennial just opened and it's doing quite well so far.   The food was amazing and the waitstaff very knowledgeable but I expected as much since this place is owned by Rob and Kevin from BOKA and Landmark.  For some reason the ladies love this place and the bar area always seems to be packed with em.  (hint: not complaining!) This could be my new favorite restaurant in Chicago.,0.9632,0.744,0.219,0.036,0.6521043771043771
2008-07-15,4.0,I went there on a Saturday night for drinks only and the place was packed.  It was a fun scene though I would note the bar was mostly packed with women.  I decided to check it out the next day for dinner and I was impressed.  Our server was very knowledgeable and attentive.  The stand out dishes were the scallops and the gulf shrimp risotto.  I also thought the mixed greens salad was excellent as well.  It is a great addition to Lincoln Park/Old town and I will definitely be heading back.,0.9584,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.5333333333333333
2008-07-14,5.0,"Perennial is very good.  They have a good amount of outside tables as well as 'inside' tables that are up against large open windows.  Similar to Landmark, another restaurant owned by the same group, there is a good amount of lounge seating.  Perennial is in the hotel lobby and they have another bar & lounge on the other side of the lobby.  This other lounge area is smaller and I assume it can be rented out, probably holds about 40-50 people.  There is also a bar and lounge seating in the main restaurant with plenty of people just having drinks.  Enough of a 'scene' to improve the people watching but not too much. (One very smart move was to play the music outside loud enough to drown out the street noise.  Clark & Lincoln are pretty busy but it was rare to hear any buses or other street noise.) The entire staff was very pleasant and educated on the menu.  It is always nice to ask about a dish and get a more informed response that just repeating the description printed on the menu.  The cheese plate appetizer was a good choice that included interesting little sides in addition to the three cheeses.  The scallops were excellent and while it was not the best piece of pork I have ever had, it was a high quality piece which makes a big difference for pork.  The mac & cheese and tomato watermelon salad were a la carte sides and both good.  I would say the a la carte sides are not completely necessary as each entrees came with very interesting smaller sides on the plate.  Overall the entrees are a bit smaller than you may be used to getting, but the amount of food fits in with the sleeker 'lounge' theme of the restaurant.  My one very picky suggestion would be to put salt and pepper on the table.  Everyone's taste is a little different so it's just nice to have. I would definitely go back to Perennial and have already recommended it to others.  Neither of those things is something I can say about most restaurants.  In what seems like a lot of 'OKs' Perennial is an all-around 'very good.'",0.9945,0.81,0.166,0.024,0.5217578520770011
2008-07-01,4.0,"My husband and his friend went their for dinner on a Thursday night and came home telling me wonderful things about this restaurant. I made him take me the very next day and he was happy to come back.  My husband was right to rave about this place.  I had the shrimp risotto which was perfectly cooked and I loved how the cubes of zucchini were still fresh and crisp in warm rice. I loved it. My husband had the appetizer called Wings & Beer. (It looked delicious, but there are a lot of things I don't like while I'm pregnant. For some reason I don't have any desire to eat chicken wings. Weird, but just how I am right now). For my entree I had the Corn and Fava Bean Succotash, pork tenderloin with roasted spoon bread. I crave corn with this pregnancy, so this was the dish for me. It didn't disappoint.   My husband is in the industry and one of the perks to being married to a chef, is when a restaurant where we are dining sends out anything complimentary.  Perennial's chef sent out some fantastic desserts. Everything was amazing, but what stuck out most for me was the deconstructed cheesecake. A berry ""pudding"" then a creamy foam and a crispy light cookie on top. But when you ate it together, it tasted just like a light cheesecake. Yum! The other two chocolate desserts were exceptional, it's just that the cheesecake warranted more space in this review. I think the prices are pretty reasonable for what you get. The presentation and service reminds me of pricier restaurants, and I have a feeling these prices won't stay this low, once their restaurant gets busier. I've already told everyone I know.",0.9798,0.799,0.146,0.055,0.6454365079365079

2008-06-28,1.0,"My husband and I stopped by Perennial on Thursday evening.  The place was packed and the outdoor patio looked so inviting.  It was about 9 p.m. and we thought we might be able to sneak in to a late dinner.  The host informed us it would be an hour wait to get in, so we decided to skip dinner that night and instead made a reservation for Saturday.  Our only options were 5:30 or 9.  We grabbed the 9 and decided to go with another couple.   Saturday night rolls around and we met our friends for a drink in the lounge at 8 while we waited for our 9 p.m. reservation.  Nine comes and we are not seated, then 9:15 and still not seated, then 9:20 and still not seated.  About 9:25 a hostess seats us with a curt apology for the delay.  We were able to look past the delay because it was opening week and the menu looked so delicious. We started with the Wings & Beer appetizer. We were informed that only 3 wings came with the dish and were offered the option to add a fourth (later we found out that the extra wing would cost us $3).  It was not so good.  It was spicy, yet lacked flavor at the same time and the chicken was a bit dry. For our entrees, three of us ordered the Flat Iron Steak and our fourth ordered the Salmon.  I can't speak for the Salmon, but the Flat Iron was not hot.  It had good flavor going for it, but did not completely deliver and was very salty.  Plus one of the steaks was very dry and very cold.  We waited an extremely long time for the food to arrive.  Again I chalk this up to opening week, so I'll look past it for now. We had informed the hostess that we had a birthday to celebrate, but no birthday dessert ever arrived and we decided to skip dessert altogether as it was very late. The service was good.  Our waitress was very courteous and was very helpful in sorting out some confusion over our bar bill. Overall, I can look past a backed-up kitchen and a wait for a table because it was opening week, but I'm not sure opening week can fix the taste and quality of the food, plus the price of the below average food. On the bright side, it's a beautifully decorated space. With the reputation of Landmark and Boka, this was definitely a disappointment.",0.8922,0.856,0.082,0.062,0.520108024691358
2008-06-27,4.0,"This is a prime spot for upscale outdoor dining. Even though the location makes it more conducive to watching cars whiz by instead of people.  The staff was ridiculously courteous. Almost too nice. I feel like this is how nice people are before they rufee someone. But they didn't. All the fanfare was probably because they just opened.  Regardless, it was appreciated and all the recommendations were on point. Also very pleased the sommelier shelled out generous samples to help us decide on wines.  So the oysters were fabulous. The spicier spin on cocktail sauce was addictive. The rainbow trout was heavily touted, and rightfully so. It had a crispy skin- which I'm not usually a fan of- but it worked well.  And was accompanied by an imaginative carrot puree with peas and bacon. A scrumptious version of adult baby food. The mint foam somehow tied the whole dish together. We also got the scallops that were served with a juicy, tender short rib. Both dishes were dead on. For dessert, had the chocolate and Baileys. Predictably rich, but an ideal one to split.",0.968,0.784,0.166,0.05,0.6529411764705884
2008-06-21,4.0,"I headed to Perennial last night on the ""official"" opening night on a double date with friends. Starting with the ambience- loved the design. It's kind of nautical in theme but then has birch trees and white wood...kind of up north on the lake feel or something. It's chic yet cozy.  Service- our server was great she was very friendly after we asked her for her recommendations and engaged her. She forgot our mac n cheese and didn't charge us for it which was nice.  Food- delicious. As you've read it's seasonal (local I think?) ingredients, the menu is not overwhelming. It's creative and delicious. We started with the risotto to share- everyone had a few bites of rich creamy risotto, we also did the ""Surf n Turf"" tuna tartare and beef carpaccio app. I'd suggest getting two of these for 4 people. It's small but very tasty.  For entrees we did the salmon, trout, pork tenderloin and duck. I think the best one was the pork tenderloin, but all were very well done. Oh and who could forget dessert- we did the ""cheesecake"" which was deconstructed into layers of cream cheese foam, graham cracker ice cream and a raspberry coulis. The chocolate and baileys dessert we got was even better- beautiful and not to be missed.  I'd definitely go back for another great meal.",0.997,0.707,0.263,0.029,0.5366666666666667
2008-05-24,4.0,"Featured local chefs Giuseppe Tentori (BOKA, Trotter's) and Ryan Poli (BUTTER, Le Francais) join culinary forces in flavorful bliss!.. Sounds a little food-dorky;  It is and yet still true.   Eat with Season: an American bistro-style sneak peek @ Perennial-   The Summer menu notes a bright asparagus soup with prosciutto and lavender, poached egg YUM and parm,  an all-American pork tenderloin dish gone corn-crazy,  and REALLY delicious seared sea scallops with wild mushrooms, spring onion accompanied by a rich petite cannelloni stuffed w/ braised short rib.  Delicious!  My absolute favorite bites were of the summer squash risotto and the crispy duck breast with pickled golden raisin puree and toasted marcona almonds.  Other mentionables include the Raw Surf-n-Turf appetizer and the portobello mushroom salad. A good list of glass pours and pretty bottles, and while the wine options are quite substantial, the bar also offers a great long list of specialty cocktails.  I liked the #14- fruitful and minty fresh- and the Hard Arnie -think a spiked Arnold Palmer, lemony and refreshing.  Solid summer beverages! The desserts are whimsical and pretty amazing.  Poli's flip-flopped cheesecake is light and fluffy, very raspberry and graham cracker-y.  I've also enjoyed the Coffee and Bailey's with the warm rich brownie (CHOCOLATE!) and whipped toffee.     The food here is clever, creative and seriously 'farm fresh'.  (Service is courteous and notes sustainable product, local and organic as available.)  Perennial's corner patio holds a strong presence along the actual park of luscious Lincoln Park, and the restaurant is honestly located directly across the street from The Chicago GREEN City Market.  What luck; Like a chef's dream come true! Perennial surely draws a diverse crowd of LP residents and curious city-wide foodies alike.   A long awaited and unique addition to the area.",0.9978,0.717,0.267,0.016,0.5952005259697567
