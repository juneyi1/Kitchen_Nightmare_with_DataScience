Some Lucky Charms marshmallows! And MALT BALLS, oh boy! And strawberry milk!""

I ordered the PB+B Crunch. A cereal made in honor of Elvis-  Panda puffs,peanut butter capt. crunch, chopped up bananas and chocolate syrup. YUM. This is much more then just a mere bowl of cereal with milk... but even if it was the atmosphere and the view of the river might make it worth the extra money.  This place is a lot of fun.

Which doesn't even make sense.  But it's the convenience factor I love. I actually don't really  think chocolate syrup and gummi bears would be good in cereal, but I like fresh fruit, the milk options and the fact that I can eat Golden Grahams without having to buy the entire box. Because I really only NEED Golden Grahams once a year IF THAT. So I'll pay 4 bucks just to not have to eat an entire box of the stuff.  Does that even make sense?  So what if it doesn't.
