2012-04-24,3.0,"I was really pleasantly surprised by this place. I've passed by it for years and never had any desire to go in, but we needed an early reservation on a Saturday, and this worked.  It's very pretty inside--low key, but a lovely atmosphere (although the tables are ridiculously close together). My friends both had the chicken with spinach which they loved. I had the white bean soup, which was almost perfectly seasoned (I like a bit more pepper), and the prosciutto with arugula and mozzarella. Excellent. I mean, I gues it's kind of hard to mess up, but there was just the right amount of balsamic vinegar and olive oil, and everything was incredible fresh. The chocolate ravioli was a fail, but  good idea...  3.5 stars.",0.986,0.636,0.272,0.092,0.6471371882086169

Although I recall it being completely empty except for my party for most of the meal. The server was a little rattled from the apparent menu change-over and couldn't answer a lot of questions. She also mixed up a few of our meals, but was very nice and apologetic about it so no big deal. The white bean soup is pretty amazing. Creamier than most and like, dense with beans. Seriously, it was like No Bean Left Behind day in the kitchen. The spring veggie gnocchi was rich and yummy but weird. Instead of the usually numerous potato pillows, I got three large, ravioli-looking puffs. Not bad, just not what I was expecting. If I went back, I'd try the lunch box. It comes with a salad, entree, pasta and dessert, and seems to be a good deal for what you get. Also, I love bento boxes. So cute and organized.",0.9879,0.685,0.225,0.09,0.5107553366174055
2011-12-02,2.0,"Pane Caldo is a small Northern Italian restaurant tucked right in the middle of Gold Coast's shopping district.  It has been there forever, but people who don't know about it tend to walk pass its unassuming store-front many a time without ever noticing it.  I was in the area for some errand and decided to stop in for lunch.   The bread service was interesting.  The bread itself had a texture of a generic breakfast roll.  Very un-Italian and very disappointing.  The dips that came with were great though.  One was chopped tomato dip, refreshing and classic Northern Italy.  The other dip tasted like lightly pureed olives, a bit finer than tapenade.  Both were fantastic.  I got the spinach risotto with saffron sauce.  The rice was creamy but still had that al dente bite.  The ingredients were not too big or overpowering, and the seasoning was spot on.  This was the most perfectly executed risotto I've had in Chicago.  For dessert I had the panna cotta.  The texture of the panna cotta was good.  But the caramel sauce on top was too thick and cloyingly sweet.  The fruits that came with were pickled in syrup, which was a shame because the dessert lacked balance.  The raspberry was a bit too ripe.  The pickled kumquat had an unyielding peel and was not pleasant.   Decor was a mismatch.  On the one hand, there was nice furniture and white table cloths, giving the space a fine-dining atmosphere.  On the other hand, you have the faux-finished wall that gave the room a rustic wine-country feel.  The ceiling, however, was dark blue and looked rather industrial in a cheap way. I had no idea what the interior design was going for.   Service was despicable.  The seating hostess was friendly and nice.  But the head waiter was another story.  There was one waiter and three tables that day.  One table received regular service.  One table got the VIP treatment, to the degree of being obsequious.  And I was completely ignored.  It was very difficult to get the waiter's attention.  He did not pay any heed to how I was doing with the food, whether I was finished with the food, or whether I wished to pay my check or wanted more coffee.  Since there was a lot of down time for me, I had a chance to observe and profile myself and my fellow-diners and mentally match our characteristics with the service we each received.  The three-point-graph I came up with was not flattering.   Food alone, Pane Caldo deserves a 4-star.  The risotto really blew me away.  However, the discriminating service left a bad taste in my mouth.  I would have been more forgiving if all diners universally received bad service.  But such was not the case.  In this day and age, and in Chicago, this was simply unacceptable.",0.9875,0.782,0.14,0.077,0.4724519061185728

2009-07-10,2.0,"First, you should understand that while I've never had a bad meal at an Italian restaurant, I've never had a good one, either. In all my life, Italian food has always been just blah--I've always been able to eat it, but it does absolutely nothing for me. Given that, I might as well be eating Chef Boy-Ar-Dee. Sadly, such is the case for Pane Caldo. It's my sister's favorite restaurant in Chicago, so when she recently visited, she took me there. The service was terrific, the atmosphere not bad, but the food was blah. I had a whitefish with a decent sauce, but it was rather meager in size--probably only 4 or 5 ounces of fish total. My sister's dish, which was some sort of roasted meat in a sauce, tasted rather like my mother's pot roast. Now, my mother makes a fine pot roast, but if I wanted that, I'd be dining at her house in Nebraska. Although they had an extensive wine list, they only offered five (count 'em--five) beers. Now, I know--Italian food is known for being paired with wine, not beer. Here again, my bias shows. But still, only five beers? Finally there's the matter of the price. For two people, dinner and drinks was around $140 with tip. For someone like me who considers dining at White Castle to be a special treat, that's positively insane. And while I'll occasionally treat myself to a nice meal that is expensive (sushi, perhaps), $70 per person is ridiculous. The bottom line is this: if you don't already love Italian food, paying $70 per person for it isn't going to make it taste any better.",0.9837,0.777,0.158,0.064,0.6221966205837175

He has always talked about this place with sincere enthusiasm, so when the chance came to visit, I was ready for it. I think I've driven by their E. Walton location five million times and I've never seen the place. I'd say that's a good thing--this place is a little gem, and I wouldn't want it ever to be overrun with people (and considering the prices, I don't think it ever will be). The space is small but glimmering with mirrors and dim light, and the seating is cush to the tush--our table had these big, squishy leather chairs. Whoever designed the interior was savvy--considering our dinner lasted 3 hours, comfy seats are priority. During those 3 hours, all aspects of Pane Caldo's service was smooth as silk. We were greeted confidently by the host, our server immediately took our coats, and we were seated before our reservation time. During the meal, our server was incredibly patient, friendly, and the bussers who brought us (and took away) various things were at times like ghosts; to me, that silent fluidity is the mark of superior service.  The menu was to die for--I couldn't decide on my meal for what seemed like a half an hour. I finally narrowed it down to the hearts of palm, grilled asparagus, and shaved fennel salad with black truffle oil vinaigrette and the Atlantic salmon with roasted garlic sauce. All I can say is: wow. The salmon was soft and moist, the garlic sauce sweet and tangy, the salad....OH I could have eaten that salad all day every day. That was probably the best salad I've ever eaten. And there were so many other things on the menu that I would have liked to try--the lobster risotto, the organic chicken, the ""Pane Caldo"" salad, the filet mignon. Mmmmmmm. I won't even go into the dessert we had--dessert is officially mandatory at Pane Caldo.

2008-08-05,4.0,"This is such a cute and intimate restaurant. I came here without a reservation on a week night, and was seated right away. It was about 8:45pm, and only a few of the tables were filled.  The decor is quaint, slightly rustic (but not too much) and elegant. Our server was very pleasant and really sweet. He had a great Italian accent and explained all the dishes to us. I'm not big on dinner rolls, but theirs are good. Hard on the outside, and hollow and doughy on the inside, it was delicious. Even better was the breadstick. They were crisp and cheesy.  I wish I knew where they got them, because they would be perfect for snacking. We started with the lobster and crab ravioli in the appetizer size. It was a pretty big portion, enough to share between two people, and fantastic. For the main course, I had the Sea Bass. It was prepared in a white truffle sauce on top of a seaweed spaghetti (that was SO good) and baby clams. It was perfectly seasoned, had some crisp on the outside and tender meaty texture on the inside. Adam had one of the pasta dishes... I forgot to ask which one. But he enjoyed it. The dessert menu actually looked really good. I would have totally gotten the Choco-misu, but we were way too full.  Service was quite attentive and there was no sign of pretentiousness.

Second courses were pastas.  We had an inventive homemade ravioli filled with king crab, avocado and topped with a saffron sauce - OUTSTANDING!  We also had the morel mushroom and truffle risotto - also good.   Our entrees were the filet with an oregon black truffle sauce, and a truffle and potato crusted tilapia.  Wow!  Both blew us away.  That filet was sooo buttery and the most tasty, perfectly cooked piece of meat.   We had wine pairing with all our courses, and everything matched to a T.  It all worked!   Our desserts were a chestnut and caramel gelato - which was so so so good, and the chocolate ravioli.  I LOVED THAT CHOCOLATE RAVIOLI!  That was sooo cool, and just melted in my mouth.  Get that please!

2008-04-04,4.0,"Pane Caldo is one of those little places that you walk by, peering in the windows, promising yourself that you'll come back and try it some day.  Well, earlier this week, I finally had my chance. From the time you open the front door- you know you are going to have a good night.  The walls are painted golden yellow, the ceiling dark blue.  Couple that with the crisp white linens on the tables, the shiny china and the hardwood floors and you will feel that you have been transported to a small family Trattoria in Italy. We were seated in the back and within minutes I was presented with what had to be one of the biggest martini's that I have ever had.  Really dirty with blue cheese olives- is there anything more perfect? I always like to order a variety of things to try when I go to a new place and tonight was no expectation.  For our appetizers, we went with the layered crab and avocado, the roasted shrimp and the shaved fennel and hearts of palm salad with asparagus.  While they were all good- my favorite was the hearts of palm. On to the second course.  We split the lobster risotto (amazing) and the capellini with black and white truffles, herbs and olive oil.  This dish was absolutely my favorite of the evening. For our entrees- we tried the lamb chops (very tender) the sea bass with the white truffle sauce and the gnocchi with crab and a spicy tomato sauce.  I'm not a big fan of gnocchi so that was my least favorite dish but still delicious. As if we had room- our server comped us a couple of amazing desserts.  One was chocolate cake three ways and the other was profiteroles drizzled with chocolate.  Both were calorie worthy and will have me at the gym working out a little longer this week!   Our server Micheal was the best- helpful without hovering and always being just steps away anticipating what we needed before we even knew we needed it.   If you drive- know that they do not have valet parking but there is plenty of parking in the parking garage right down the street. With all of these accolades, you might be saying why not a 5 star experience?   Well, it really came down to an interaction we had over my wine choice.  The wine list is extensive with many lessor known wines.  I wanted an Amarone and there was one that I drink all the time on the list for $120  When I chose it- the ""wine guy"" tells me that it is a ""horrendous"" choice and that he'll bring me something else to do a taste test with.   What?  I drink this wine all the time and I know I like it- but I let him do his thing.  He sets down two glasses in front of me- and much to his dismay, in a blind taste test, I once again chose the Amarone.  As he huffed away- he muttered something under his breath about my ""taste in wines"".  I guess I needed to remind him that one of us was the customer and if I wanted to drink ""swill"" he should have poured it in my glass and smiled while he did it.  I suspect that this interaction is why our server comped us our desserts! Other than that little hiccup- Pane Caldo is a lovely spot to enjoy a little Northern Italian food in an upscale environment.  Just don't be intimidated by the host/""wine guy"".  You know what you like.  Their job is to give it to you.  And that is that.",0.9954,0.863,0.114,0.024,0.4447665429808286
2008-02-22,4.0,"In honor of Oscars  weekend, I couldn't pick a better time to post this odd review...keeping in line with the themes of cinema, this one has tragedy, drama, comedy, intrigue, suspense, paparazzi and even a nod to the avant garde... Valentine's Day...2008...it's around 3:30-4:00p, and Jacky and I are swapping texts discussing getting home at 5:00ish so that we can go to a 7:00p dinner at Pane Caldo. For whatever reason, despite 11+ years here, neither one of us has been to the venerable Walton St. Italian Trattoria. US Weekly featured it regularly during Jen Aniston's Chicago summer, and it's been known to be a hotspot for the movers and shakers from Hollywood visiting our fair city... Drama begins - Jacky is running late driving home from way up north - she will be fighting to get home before 6:30! AND - the reports start pouring in about the tragedy that had just taken place in DeKalb.  Not a great start to the evening. We finally arrive at the restaurant, mercifully only 10 minutes late, and we walk into an alternate entrance. Construction is taking place and the mise en scene is replete with leaning mirrors, fresh paint, and a theatrical vibe. Some leggy hostesses guide us into the pretty dining room, where 15 foot high ceilings beam spotlights down onto the tables. The ambience is set... Unfortunately, discussion of the tragedy from earlier is all you hear murmuring  through the first tables we pass, so the romance that could have saturated the room was replaced with a bit of anxiety. Jacky excuses herself for a moment to powder her nose, and I continue to the table - a tight fit, almost bistro style, in the crowded dining room. Okay, freeze - zoom in...so lo and behold...in front of me...I see someone and my eyebrows raise off my head. My favorite movie in the entire world is The Graduate (see sidebar for proof), but one of my top 5 is without question, The Cook, The Thief, His Wife & Her Lover. A strange and political vision directed by Peter Greenaway, it features grotesque images, sweeping sets, Jean-Paul Gaultier costumes and scenes set in the fictional grand 'Le Hollandais,' and one of the all-time-most haunting soundtracks composed by Michael Nyman. It starred the brilliant Michael Gambon and Helen Mirren, and a fresh-faced Tim Roth as a ""Mr. Spica"" hanger-on. So, who should be sitting against the wall dressed to the nines with a pearl necklace and a smile that warmed the room? Helen Mirren. The room swirled for a moment, and the context of seeing Helen Mirren in person in a restaurant was enough to make me stutter. She was absolutely gorgeous, I might add. As I swivel around to my table (still by myself), I hear an ""excuse me?"" - I lean down, and a young lady at the table next to me with her date/spouse/sig.other says, ""can I please have another bottle of sparkling water?"" It turns out that day, I was dressed a bit shwanky from work, and hadn't changed. I smiled and said - ""I could...but the people who work here might get upset if I take their job!"" She blanched and her date/spouse/sig.other burst out laughing. Pretty funny...Jacky sits down and asks, ""what did I miss?"" Next - we are told that the specials of the day almost all include black and white truffles...delicious...Jacky and I get a beautifully prepared seared tuna app, a terrine, and Jacky orders a seafood risotto...I order the steak with a black truffle sauce and asparagus. The temperatures, appearance, timing and service were all SUPERB. But unfortunately, we are barely able to enjoy a bite of our food when...two tables over, an older gentleman slumps over in his seat. The man next to us is a doctor (!), he immediately checks on him, and determines that (despite his being a pediatric dept. head, and not a heart doctor), this man is having a serious cardiac ""episode."" The man seems okay now, and is waving it off as nothing to worry about, and the ambulance comes...people were on edge already...and the light is now flashing into the restaurant from Walton St. Helen Mirren looks on at the scene with a concerned look as a spotlight from above shines down, Jacky and I look at each other and realize...we're going to have to come back here on a normal night to truly experience Pane Caldo the way it should be enjoyed. At that point...I'll revise this review...but for now with the Academy Awards appropriately airing, I'll leave it as The Cook, The Thief, His Wife, The Ambulance, and The Waterboy... overly dramatic, suspenseful, off-kilter, and undoubtedly incomplete since despite a beautiful restaurant with pleasant and efficient service and elegantly prepared plates, I couldn't tell you what one bite of my food tasted like?!",0.9969,0.805,0.137,0.058,0.5181139070269504

2008-02-13,1.0,"I'm a woman the last time I checked.  The BIGGEST pet peeve of mine is to be greeted as ""you guys"" in a supposed fine dining establishment ... Here we were, six in our party, all impeccably dressed and waiting for a wonderful evening to unfold, excited in getting to know my new European friends who were here for the first time.  ... ""Hi guys"" was the first thing said to us .... Huh?  Excuse me?  Do you not see that there are three women in this party?   I used to frequent this lovely, quaint and understated restaurant because I knew that I would be guaranteed a superb dining experience--from beginning to the end.  I used to love walking in and being greeted like a lady by a very lovely hostess who somehow always knew whether or not I was there for business or pleasure.  I adored the server Louie and how he paid attention to every detail--from how ""dirty"" I preferred my martini to what mood I'd be in for dessert.  And then there was gorgeous Joseph--from Egypt--who always knew what type of ""nectar of the gods"" (as he wisely put it) would complement each course.  The owner, a very mysterious, but dapper French Moroccan, would pop in every and now and then and comp----not only my party, other tables as well----us a drink or come around just to make sure we were being taken care of.  Pane Caldo was like a new baby--my pride and joy and reason to boast about how cosmopolitan Chicago is to those who are quick to assume that we are still ""beneath"" say, L.A. or New York. But this time was different.  My, how just a few short years makes the world of a difference ... I called in two weeks in advance because it had been such a long time since I had been there and I wanted the evening to be as memorable as previous times.  I was bringing in some people who were new to the U.S. and I wanted to show off my ""baby,"" my pride and joy. Quite the opposite happened.  Upon entering I was greeted by a disheveled hostess, who although very pretty, looked as though she had slept there the night before, not having had time to go home, shower or change clothes.  Louie--no longer there, unfortunately had passed away a year before.  Joseph--mysteriously ""disappeared"" I was told and the owner, to my dismay, was ""hiding"" in the back and not once had come around to greet anyone.  That's life--I know.  Things change.  What I wasn't expecting though, was having ""Mo,"" ""Larry"" and ""Curly"" to have taken over the once high-end, posh restaurant.  I could have very well been at Olive Garden.  The service was, to put it mildly, HORRID.   The food?  Well let's just say that if I had been blindfolded and given a taste test, I would have believed I was in a hospital cafeteria.  The potato-encrusted cod was cold, tasteless and soggy--not light, crisp and airy as it had once been.  Not to mention the calamari--felt as though I were chewing on rubber bands.  The food tasted ""old"" and looked even worse.  The risotto--once one of my favorites dishes--looked like an exotic animal's pile of excrement in the middle of a very large bowl.  (...apologies for the graphic visual.) One may think why I didn't say anything, but I was so horrified at having taken foreigners there for the first time that I didn't feel right in bringing this up in front of people who come from countries where complaining about food is just not done.  Ironically, the only thing my guests commented on was how we were greeted.  Bad food/service they can deal with---after all, everyone is entitled to having a bad day.  But, calling ladies ""guys"" is just plain offensive.",0.9919,0.805,0.138,0.056,0.521506734006734
