The summer peach they currently have for seasonal is delicious, I've gone back for it twice already.

When someone asks ""Do you think the summer peach ice cream would make a good milkshake,"" you don't respond with ""Listen sir I don't know; I don't like milkshakes.""  To top it off after waiting 15 minutes we had to ask for a refund for my mother-in-law's banana split because they didn't have the plastic lengthwise cups long enough to hold the banana split itself. You don't have banana splits on your menu if you don't have bowls to serve them in.  Again, pathetic business. Next time I'll head up to Gerry's in Andersonville or lickety-split in Edgewater, where at this time of the night the business is trifold and they still manage to provide service with a smile on their faces and with cups to hold their ice cream in.",-0.8151,0.835,0.067,0.098,0.5826007326007326

Their best and signature ice cream is Cubby Crunch (crushed m&ms, pretzels, sprinkles, oreos, toffee crunch). Sounds like a huge amalgam / could be strange, but just ask for a sample. I normally don't like those things in ice cream, but I love Cubby Crunch! They are very good at creative ice creams, like this.  The only reason I knock them 1 star is because (1) they don't have very simple/basic flavors that knock your socks off (so if you want just an amazing vanilla or strawberry ice cream, you will have to go elsewhere), and (2) not enough seating.",0.9892,0.697,0.293,0.01,0.612

The good news about Chicago is that a person has options.  After my recent visit to this ice cream stop I have decided not to return unless for some crazy reason I am in desperate need for ice cream and they are the only option. The recent evening I went there was mainly an all guy staff with one gal working. The gal had a positive friendly attitude where as the dudes there seemed to not really care so not friendly and not unfriendly either. Lack of a welcome and a smile in the world of ice cream is a rarity. The outdoor tables and chairs were put away early as it had been raining earlier even though the rain cleared  a couple of hours before close.  Portions have shrunk and prices have increased. There are so many excellent quality places that I no longer need to go here as the flavors have remained the same which is ok yet I have found on par or better with the local competition which also comes with a better value...size for money spent and a friendly welcome I need not return.  Au revoir to a former favorite.",0.9902,0.748,0.206,0.046,0.5045000698226505

But this weekend I saw something kinda gross that may forever tarnish my opinion of this Lakeview staple. I was waiting in line and a girl in front of me ordered her ice cream and a shake. She then asked for the key to the bathroom while an employee was dishing her ice cream. Without skipping a beat the guy reaches around the wall for the key. In his one hand is her ice cream and in the other is the ice cream scoop. With a free finger he grabs the giant spatula that has a key dangling from it and hands it to her. She proceeds to go for the bathroom and he digs the scoop back into the freezer.  I've been in many public restrooms and they're seldom clean. Also there is a percentage of our population that doesn't wash their hands. So the fact that the employee didn't wash his hands after handling the bathroom key is kinda gross. The employees here also don't wear gloves when handling food so whatever nasty bacteria was on that key is now on his hands and on their food prep surfaces. What's worse is he asked to take my order next. I don't mean to make a fuss but food preparation safety should be one of the main concerns of any establishment. That key should be handed out by someone not preparing food at the very least or perhaps by the register. Will I come back? Perhaps.

The only downside is that it's a little pricy, and the sizes seem to be a little inconsistent. A single scoop was pretty large, so I got a kids size the second time.

What's also great about Bobtail's is that the shop is open until 10 or 11 pm most days for when you're craving something sweet a little later at night. I was pretty full from dinner, so I opted for a child's cup of the white chocolate peanut butter cup. When I first saw the cup, I was a little disappointed. Be warned, a child's cup is TINY. I paid $3.75 for essentially 2/3 of a scoop, which is pretty sad. Get a bigger size for a better bang out of your buck... Now, onto the ice cream itself!! Bobtail does not mess around. The ice cream is SUPER dense (even more so than your typical ben and jerrys!), and very creamy. I loved the flavor- concentrated and not too sweet. There were plenty of mini peanut butter cups in my scoop, which was great. My friend got a pistachio scoop, which also tasted yummy. There were pistachio pieces sprinkled throughout her cup too!

This time the workers were nice and they let us sample flavors without telling us we had too much. The Cubbie crunch is the best flavor in my opinion followed by cookies and cream. I wish they had more flavors though. They also have plenty of other options which tons of people come here for... such as coffee, shakes etc.  Something I really like is they load you up when you get a double scoop in a waffle cone. HUGE portions! I felt like I got three huge scoops and that will for sure keep me coming back here. Well, it does cost $5, so I guess they try to make it worth your money.

Bobtail has a few tables inside but more seating outside. I wouldn't recommend bringing a large group of people if you plan to grab a seat at the ice cream parlor. All of the employees I interacted with were extremely friendly and willing to educate you on the various flavors that they have to offer. Bobtail offers the classic flavors but if you are going to travel all the way here you have to go big or go home and get a specialty flavor.  After trying all of the delicious flavors I landed on the Cubby Crunch in a chocolate dipped Oreo waffle cone. Cubby Crunch is a combination of vanilla ice cream, sprinkles, Oreo, chocolate chips, and toffee or heaven on a cone.

I had a wing-date at Crisp with my fellow Crisp-lover, Aimee M. Actually it was a movie date that we strategically set at Century so that we could get our Crisp fix and dessert action at Bobtail after. We are crafty like that. So we strolled on over and indulged our inner child with ice cream floats!  I  had the root beer float, which is made with Mug root beer. I think it's hard to screw up a root beer float, but having the right ingredients is key. Mug root beer is a solid choice and the ice cream is deliciously creamy. I did sample the peanut butter chip - which was very tasty - but I had just stuffed myself full of chicken wings and decided a root beer float was more my speed.

I'm not sure if they somehow dropped the whipped cream on the side of the plastic cover but it looked very sloppy, which was the least of my concerns. The milkshake ended up to be this very watery, possibly vanilla(?) flavor with no sign of the salted caramel chocolate pretzel. It tasted more like a sweetened milk than vanilla. The banana was there though. The chai shake was fine but come on. I was in a hurry to deliver the chai shake to a friend, and once I was far from bobtail I realized they had messed up my shake.

2015-04-22,3.0,"***Bobtail is a popular ice cream parlor that features old-fashioned ice cream; it is definitely more exciting and satisfying than other old-fashioned ice cream parlors in the city like Baskin-Robbins; it does struggle to compete with the city's and country's best ice cream though*** Bobtail is a Chicago institution.  It is a classic and old-fashioned ice cream parlor and you know it as soon as you walk in.  There is a high booth, lots of kitchen machines that seem to be from another era and vintage signs, menus and such on the walls that illustrate this ice cream parlor's past (as well as how low prices were back in the day). With all the new gourmet, artisan and organic ice cream parlors out there like Jeni's (in Chicago as well as other cities), Sweet Rose Creamery (in Brentwood, California) and Bi-Rite Creamery (in San Francisco), it is hard to expect that Bobtail can deliver a similarly excellent and special experience. Bobtail though does not feel too dated or too mainstream like a Baskin-Robbins.  They even feature a few interesting flavors like merlot ice cream blended with dark chocolate or a Dutch chocolate ice cream mixed with Jack Daniel's.  I tried both flavors and liked them, but I also felt that the ice cream did not measure up to some of the great ice cream parlors now available in most major U.S. cities. The merlot ice cream had a very unique flavor.  It was sweet, but the wine flavor was still very noticeable.  It tasted like a port ice cream with the combination of sweetness and a red wine flavor.  The merlot flavor blended nicely with the dark chocolate flecks in the ice cream. The Jack's Daniel flavor in the Dutch chocolate with Jack Daniel's was not as noticeable, but there was definitely a little bit of a burn and bitterness.  The contribution of the Jack Daniel's was most noticeable in how it really brought out the chocolate flavor.  Though this was not a dark chocolate ice cream, the chocolate flavor was surprisingly pronounced. The ice cream had a consistency similar to Baskin-Robbins.  It was not too icy, but it was definitely more firm than the gourmet ice creams now being sold in major U.S. cities.  The ice cream also lacked the richness and density of other great ice creams I have had. Service was friendly and quick. Prices were reasonable.  Bobtail's ice cream was noticeably less expensive than those gourmet ice cream parlors. Bobtail is a satisfying stop for ice cream.  It definitely stands out when compared to its mainstream competition like Baskin-Robbins; Bobtail features ice cream that is both more delicious as well as less icy than what you will find at a Baskin-Robbins.  Still, Bobtail struggles to compete with the country's best ice cream parlors (like Jeni's, which is also located in Chicago).  If you just want a good old-fashioned ice cream cone though, Bobtail should meet your needs. I am not sure what the parking situation is.  Bobtail is located a good distance from the heart of the city so you might be able to find parking around here.",0.9982,0.783,0.189,0.028,0.5063956384117675

2014-07-23,4.0,I have been to many ice cream shops that claims to have homemade cream. Hands down Bobtails have the best ice cream I have tasted in a long time. I sampled the white chocolate peanut butter chip because it was recommended to me but I was looking to get a shake. So I then I sampled the expresso cream and it was delicious and thought to myself what could go better with a coffee taste other than some rich chocolate ice cream in a shake. It was well worth the wait (line was extremely long and out the door) but it moved pretty quick.

Plan to eat outside or go for a walk after grabbing your scoop. I've had a multitude of flavors from Bobtail, but most recently tried their peach and it was fantastic. Incredibly summery and flavorful, I highly recommend if it's available. I think the best part of Bobtail is there original flavors. Two very unique ones are the Signature Sunset, which I suggest if you're in the mood for something that isn't super sweet. First of all, the ice cream is Merlot flavored, which sounds super weird. However, it isn't. It totally works with the dark chocolate chips, and I'm not sure how. The best original flavor at Bobtail is definitely the Lakeview Barhopper. Successfully combining two of my favorite things, chocolate and whiskey, this does not disappoint. Again, when you first hear the combination you're like ""huh?"" but it's delicious.

Birthdays are serious business to me, so when an ice cream cake was requested, I turned to yelp to help me find a business that wasn't Baskin Robbins or Cold Stone where an ice cream cake could be acquired.  Enter Bobtail.  There are two options available, a 6"" cake or a 9"" cake.  I opted for the 9"", as I felt it would leave room for the writing as well as alllllll of the candles I needed to cram on there without it looking crowded.  Someone was turning old, so that was a lot of candles. Having never been to Bobtail and wanting the cake to be a surprise, I asked one of the employees for their suggestion as to what flavors would go well together.  Actually, that's a lie.  All the reviews mentioned this Cubby Crunch, so I knew that was going in the inside.  I needed help with whether the cake itself should be chocolate or vanilla and what the outside flavor should be.  Chocolate cake with peanut butter ice cream on the outside it was!  I don't like to pat myself on the back very often (oh who am I kidding, yes I do), but I think the flavors went great together.   I don't know if you can request the writing to be in a certain color.  From what I remember, the cake in the store had the same color scheme on top as the one I ordered, so blue and red might be your only options.  I didn't think to ask, but that's something to keep in mind if that's important.  Take the cake out right before serving.  I was told to run a knife under hot water to help with slicing and that seemed to work pretty well.  If you're picking this cake up in the summer, make sure you go straight home.  I had a tear-filled meltdown once I got home and noticed the cake had started melting, all because I made a ""quick stop"".  I'm pretty sure they might even deliver, which is something to consider if you're like me and convince yourself a quick stop on the way home makes more sense than going back out.  Lesson learned when an ice cream cake is on the line. I'd definitely order a cake from here again though!  You're going to pay more than you would at Baskin Robbins, but birthdays are special and it's worth it.",0.9932,0.834,0.141,0.025,0.49842472342472355

2014-06-06,5.0,"Oh Bobtail Ice Cream, I just cannot resist your delicious creaminess and fantastic flavors. As a pastry cook, I'm constantly surrounded by delicious desserts, so much so that I'm rarely tempted by sweets outside of the work place. But there's nothing better than a huge ""scoop"" (aka 2 scoops) of Bobtail Ice Cream on a hot and muggy day (side note: I hate Chicago weather).  Bobtail is one of those old fashioned ice cream parlors that makes you nostalgic for the idealistic version of the old days. You know, those cute ice-cream-parlor-and-drive-in-movie days. Sure, you can get a scoop or two of ice cream here, but you can also get root beer floats, crazy sundaes, espresso ice cream drinks, and so many more. The menu just goes on and on and on. I, personally, always ogle over all the crazy combos I could get and then, in a panic, end up ordering a simple single scoop.

Walking into a shop like this you would expect the customer to come first. My GF and I were second in line to a couple who waited for more than 5 minutes to even be acknowledged by the 3 employees working behind the counter.  Once they ordered each person seemed to act as if they were more of burden than anything. It was 8 O'clock on a Saturday night. Prime ice cream time. Finally it was our turn to order. I ordered a chocolate malt and my GF ordered a Cubby Crunch shake. 10 minutes later and after getting passed by 3 people behind us in line we had our treats. Total flop. My malt had an inch of malt powder sitting in the bottom. It reminded me of slurping up mud. Cubby Crunch (one of their signature flavors) ice cream is underwhelming.

We were due to see a movie at the Century Centre Cinema a few blocks away and were an hour early, so we took a walk spelunking for ice cream. Found Bobtail on the corner of Wellington and Broadway in Lakeview. This store, founded in 2004, is the original effort from a group that was involved in a University of Chicago business plan contest ... and their product is based on recipes from a businessman who sold door-to-door back in the 1950s. Enough backstory. If you like ice cream you'll like this place. No frills operation in an old-fashioned ice cream palace. Has a neat blue and white striped awning on the front. A few stools and tables, a long counter with all the goodies behind. We started simple and had a small chocolate sundae (how can you go wrong) and a scoop of mint chocolate chip (ditto, and a good benchtest). Both were winners. The sundae was just the right size and with great chocolate syrup. The mint chip was fresh and full of flavor - it was not gummy how this ice cream can sometimes be at other places. All-in-all this was a great little find. They also sell coffee, espresso, etc. While the tables and chairs inside of the store could use a little rehabilitation, the absolute top-drawer and friendly service from the staff makes up for it.

After his remark my friend was a bit annoyed and answered loudly to make sure he could hear the order and the server had the gall to say he didn't like the tone we had, when at that time he had an attitude taking our order. Then he patronized us in front of other customers saying and making the situation very uncomfortable as we asked for the mangers number, which if the customer wants the managers number they should be able to speak with a manager to know exactly what kind of employees they have representing them.  We were denied a number and the servers just didn't help at all.  That same server kept yelling across the whole store when a phone number  should have been given and that would have been the end.

My boyfriend tried the salted pecan and that tasted lovely as well (but honestly, not as good as mine).  It was almost a bit too salty for my liking.

The ice cream quality never really impressed me and the service was 'annoyed teen chic.' For years, I had friends who, knowing my sweet tooth, told me that I needed to come back and try them again. That in the intervening time in which I established my initial impressions, Bobtail got its act together and started cranking out some serious ice cream. I was all, like, ""So?"" For.years. The joke was on me. One day as I wandered East Lakeview in search of a sweet treat to keep me going on this long, winding road of life, I was beckoned into Bobtail by images of happy, portly children bounding out of its doors, hopped up on sugar and joy. I needed some of that. I walked in... and was ignored. Yep, this was familiar. Before the two girls behind the counter had realized that I wasn't a figment of their imagination and I wasn't leaving, a third (!) clerk came out from the back to help me. This wasn't starting well. The only upside was that I'd had time to scan the menu and figure out what I wanted. A scoop of Chocolate Daydream. A scoop of Bananas Foster. Hot Fudge. Peanuts. Whipped Cream. Cherry. Read it all again. Slowly. Savor it. Mhm. Yep. Despite awful service (again!), it's likely my 34 Cs and expanding waistline will be back.

Sprinkles are much better served as a room-temperature topping -- they become very hard and are mashed up during the creation of the ice cream, which I don't like so much. Regular flavors are good but are either roughly the same quality-wise as the premium supermarket brands (Oberweis, Ciao Bella, etc.) or worse (Talenti). For the price, that is not good enough.

Unfortunately that's what brought me down to 3-stars. Aside from the brownie itself, the ice cream flavors and consistency was really good.

The first thing I did was try the ""Signature Sunset,"" merlot ice cream studded with dark chocolate chips.  You may have to sit down for this, Yelp.  I did not care for it.  I wanted to like it so very very badly, but I got less the flavor of the wine and more the flavor of alcohol.  Like when orange juice goes bad and it tastes almost fizzy from the fermenting?  Like that.  I was so sad.  But then I tried the ""Lakeview Barhopper,"" chocolate ice cream with Jack Daniels, and I was happy again.   However, I had a craving for s'mores, and I ended up with a s'mores sundae.  Two scoops seemed excessive, but if you ask, they will indeed make you a single-scoop sundae, just the right size. Mine had amazing chocolate ice cream, hot fudge that tasted like a melted Hershey  bar, real marshmallow topping (did not taste like ""marshmallow"" but actually like marshmallow), graham cracker crumbs, whipped cream, and a cherry.  I'm almost ashamed at how quickly it disappeared before me.  It was so wonderful and so satisfying I wanted to lick the bowl. The atmosphere is very bright and cheerful, with retro signs and at this time of year, Christmas lights.  They also make ice cream-flavored coffee drinks (which may be more appropriate as we sink into single-digits).  And they have a little help-yourself water cooler by the coffee accessories.   The price isn't so bad.  With tax, my single-scoop Heaven sundae was $4.38.  Which is less than you'll pay at Coldstone.  And Coldstone is subpar.",0.9912,0.722,0.188,0.09,0.6010168650793651

Or vanilla with a suggestion of merlot. Even the chocolate ice-cream is not very rich or full. The texture varies greatly. On some days it seems fresh and creamy.

Dislikes:  Really just some minor complaints...  It's a bit pricey (at least to me, nearly $7 for a specialty milkshake is not terribly cheap anyway), but it's worth it every now and then.  It's something like six bucks for a pint, which is high considering the overall lack of flavor their ice cream has when served without toppings.  There's not a ton of seating, but I've only seen the placed packed a couple times.  I'd really prefer if it closed at 11pmtoo, but they shut the doors promptly at 10.  The atmosphere won't blow you away - not quite old fashioned soda shop style, though I think that's what they're trying for.  Really it's a bit too modern looking to pull that off, but no biggie. Regardless of a couple minor dislikes though, it's an okay eat.  Frankly, I'd say their toppings are better than the ice cream flavor itself (which is slightly bland if eaten alone), so indulge in something crazy.

I went here with my girlfriend Diana and her mom.  Diana and I got ice cream lattes (lattes made with any of their ice cream flavors) and her mom got a hot chocolate.  After we ordered, I noticed that the man who took our order had a Star Wars symbol tattooed on each arm.  One was the symbol of the Rebellion, the other the symbol of the Empire.  These conflicting images made me suspicious of his motives.  When I showed Diana she simply responded, ""It's a trap!""  I think she was right.  First of all, Diana ordered the peppermint stick latte, which apparently was a holiday flavor that had been discontinued and they had never taken it off the board.  That alone makes me think maybe they don't sell many of those ice cream lattes, as no one had noticed it yet.  So we each got the mint chip.  The coffee tasted burnt, bitter and stale.  That was a major disappointment, because whenever I got some of the chocolate mint chips, I thought they were delicious, and it made me wish it were warmer so I could try the ice cream.  Diana's mom said her hot chocolate tasted funny, and Diana agreed.  I would not recommend the mint chip ice cream latte at all.  I do, however, intend to be back for the ice cream some day.",-0.3197,0.809,0.093,0.097,0.5271303258145363

Bobtail is an excellent place to go for a cone.  Their dipped waffle cones are very tasty, and so is the ice cream.  My favorite is the Espresso flavored ice cream in a dipped (with sprinkles) waffle cone.  They have other fun flavors, like the one inspired by the CPD - coffee ice cream with donut chunks.  Yowza! The stuff just tastes good.  Plus, it isn't super hard packed, so it doesn't hurt my teeth.  I like it a little bit soft. 1 star deducted for 3 reasons:  (a) Super crummy root beer floats.  1 can of MUG root beer and 1 scrawny scoop of vanilla does not constitute a root beer float. (b) It can be pretty pricey.  I saw some guy with his family (3 kids plus 4 adults) drop $38.  Not even kidding. (c) Smarmy kids working behind the counter.  Don't get me wrong.  Most of them are just fine...but the smarmy ones really boil my blood.  Hey kid - just get me the damn cone and leave the editorializing for someone who gives a hoot.

Their ice cream is excellent, smoothies fantastic and the place is cute to top it all off.  But it is often horrendously busy and too warm in the place.  There isn't an effective way for people to form a line since Bobtail is small, so the area in front of the ice cream cooler and the counter is like a zoo.  More so because people insist on having their entire party present at the counter even if just one person is doing the ordering.
