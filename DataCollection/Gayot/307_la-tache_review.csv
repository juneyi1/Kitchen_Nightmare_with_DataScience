2010-08-21,1.0,"Let me first preface my one-star rating for La Tache by explaining that over the course of the past two years, my partner and I have gone to La Tache more than a dozen times and it really has been a favorite of ours.  We are tired, however, of the inconsistent service, and more than frustrated by the lack of attention and proper wait service given by the tall blond male waiter there.  When we have gone, we have tried to request female servers because they were a) efficient and b) listened to our non-negotiable of having no extra salt added to any appetizer, salad, or entree.   The food is absolutely delicious: the Friday all you can eat fish fry is fantastic (cod) and their french fries are like Moody's Pub french fries, meaning they taste like potatoes and not oil.  The steak fritte is wonderful.  Their salmon, chicken, lamb, and scallops (albeit a tad overpriced) entrees are always good.  Their salads are fresh and delicious, and we always recommend everyone try whatever season salad they have going.  Their mussels are tasty.  The oysters are meh, IMHO.  Had better at McCormick and Schmicks.   This past Friday, we waited 50 minutes to be given bread...and only were given bread when I asked the bartender if we did not qualify for bread that night (I had to get up from the dining room to ask since our waiter was nowhere to be found).  They were very obviously understaffed.  No bus boy in sight.  Only two waiters handling all tables and one appeared to be very inexperienced.  Ours who probably is a professional waiter could not handle the order of oysters, seasons salads and steak fritte entrees.  Every single time we have had this waiter, our food has come out slower than molasses in January and salty even though we are very firm and straightforward (and probably PIAs) about telling him about our no salt policy.  We were glum about having him but thought, well, let's just give him yet another chance.  After 50 minutes, we get cranky on a Friday night, especially when the house wasn't filled to capacity.  I walked over to the bar and told the bartender I would pay for our appetizer but that we were leaving because 50 minutes for a salad and steak fritte was a bit much.  I cannot emphasize enough how much the waiter has made La Tache for us now a place we will no longer frequent and will choose to go somewhere else in the neighborhood.   The kicker is that this waiter is the floor manager.  Either he does not like to wait on women or he has just sub-par skills.   I can no longer recommend La Tache and it pains me because the food is so good.",0.9326,0.867,0.082,0.051,0.5049812030075188
2010-07-02,4.0,"I am really surprised at how may people hate this place.  While it's not the most amazing food I have ever had, the food I have had has been good.  I too have not been there on a crazy busy night so it's never been too noisy.   I usually eat here on Monday night and the $20 prix fixe is hard to beat.  I just ate there Monday night of this week and the pork loin that I had was amazing.  The chocolate dessert I had, while decent was no where as delicious as the key lime pie that i have had here before.  Again, I am not sure what it's like at this place on a busy night, but the Monday night prix fixe is hard to beat.",-0.513,0.818,0.07,0.112,0.6930555555555556
2010-06-21,1.0,"I really don't want to do this... I used to love this restaurant and would bring my friends here all the time...and I've heard things had changed... I'd been back once or twice in the meantime to find the service a bit sketchy but the food still good. Unfortunately, this past visit was perfectly awful as well as insulting.  I was part of a party of five that arrived on time and was seated promptly(we had reservations). The restaurant was busy and it did look like the wait staff was taxed but the food was coming out and everything smelled good. It took a bit longer for our wine order to be taken than was usual and for bread to arrive... finally, our order was taken. Our waiter didn't seem stressed or interested in us.  He never checked with us and barely made eye contact but we all figured he was just busy and were willing to deal because the lamb chops sounded so good.  (A note though- two vegetarians in the party were totally out of luck- There were no veggie options  and they were stuck with a house salad). After our order was taken time passed and passed and passed. Some people around us ate and left- our bread was gone as was our wine and water. Our waiter didn't check in, didn't seem super busy and didn't make eye contact- at all. Our order did not arrive. People were seated after us and were then brought their food. We didn't' have complicated orders nor were we a massive party but we weren't even offered more wine or bread. Really hungry and getting cranky despite the great company, we asked for more bread and got a small board for the 5 of us. Our water was refilled. The people beside us (and beside them) arrived a good 45 minutes after us and were already enjoying their dinners.  We were so jealous. The most frustrating thing was that at no point  did the waiter or anyone apologize or even explain what the problem might have been.  We were just ignored. I cannot pay $25 for an entrée after 2 hours of waiting while others around me who arrived later are happily having dinner. What a disappointment. So we decided to leave. I asked to speak to the manager but instead out waiter was called over. Still, no apology. He seemed irritated, said it ""wasn't his fault"" ... They did not charge us for our bottle of wine that had long ago been emptied, which was nice.  Anyway, it was after 9, two hours had passed so we all ran our empty bellies to Calo and within the hour had emptied a great bottle of wine and eaten the better part of a really great pizza and then super-tipped our waitress who was kind enough to ask us if we were satisfied and if we needed anything else several times during our meal.",0.9224,0.73,0.145,0.125,0.5648148148148147
2010-06-19,1.0,"So La Tache now has the distinction of being the first restaurant I've ever walked out of. Last night (Friday) my bookclub had reservations at 7:30.  We were seated, but were waiting for a member who was stuck in traffic.  No one came to take drink orders, appetizer orders or give us bread until about 7:50.  During this time, the restaurant was so loud that I literally could not hear the person sitting next to me -  not exactly conducive to a good bookclub discussion.   We finally heard from our missing member that she wasn't going to be able to make it at all and, as we were all starving, we tried to flag the waiter down to order a bottle of wine and entrees.  We have two vegetarians in the book club, and the menu was not at all veggie friendly.  The pasta special, which we'd anticipated would be vegetarian since nothing else on the menu was, had meat in it.  There was no offer made to substitute or make something special for the vegetarians, so they both ordered soup and salad.  Two girls ordered the lamb chops, and I ordered the fish and chips. Our wine came fairly quickly and was, I have to admit, fantastic.  And then we waited.  And waited.  And waited.  A half hour....forty minutes....our bread was long gone and our wine was almost polished off.  At no point did anyone drop by the table to explain why our food was taking so long or to offer an apology.  At 8:30 I asked the waiter for more bread.  He delivered half of the portion we'd be given originally without a word.  At 9, one hour after we'd placed our orders, we decided to leave.  The waiter told us he'd discount our entrees if we'd wait ""a few more minutes"" but at that point no one felt they'd be able to enjoy La Tache's fairly expensive food.  We decided to take our business elsewhere and walked up to the bar to settle the wine.  The bartender proceeded to completely ignore our party as the five of us stood there.  Infuriated by this point, we turned to just walk out.  At this point our waiter caught us and told us they'd take care of the wine. He also said it wasn't his fault but the kitchen's.  This  might be true, but refusing to offer any kind of apology is ridiculous.  Even if it was the kitchen's fault, the waiter could have come by the table to keep us updated. Sorry La Tache.  I didn't like your food that much to begin with, and after this I am never visiting again.",0.6922,0.815,0.095,0.09,0.5004712301587302
2010-05-09,1.0,"So I went back to La Tache last night. It's been years, thought I'd give it another try, see if it had improved after its downward slide. At first, things looked promising--pleasant server, updated decor, new menu. Then things went downhill. My friend Jen ordered a glass of the pinot noir (the wine list is incredibly small, by the way, a fraction of what it used to be). The wine was sour. Literally sour. The server apologized, took it away, and brought her a different glass of wine ... but didn't offer to comp it. Our meal took almost an hour to arrive (for me, the salad lyonnaise and for Jen, the roast chicken). The food, by the way, was good. While we were waiting for our meal, we overheard the conversations at the tables on either side of us--the place had mangled their checks and had mixed up some credit cards. And lost one one of them. Turns out it had fallen out of the check folder in the back of the dining room. Finally, we asked for change for a $20 so we could leave the tip in cash. The bartender told us she'd need to run to the corner store to break the bill because they didn't keep that much cash on hand.  A disappointment, really.

About 20 of us got together to support Dining Out for Life on Apr 29. Every year we choose a different restaurant to go to. La Tache is one of the participating restaurants in Andersonville and is donating 30% of proceeds on this night to support AIDS Chicago. I called a couple of other participating restaurants but none of them would like to take our reservation because we were a large group. This is the first restaurant who was willing to work around us. For that, I really thank them for giving us the opportunity to social while supporting a great cause.  However, the food left more to be desired. I ordered rainbow trout. It feels like drenched in cooking oil. It doesn't taste bad. Just way too oily on a night when it was 70 degrees. My friend sitting next to me also waited a long time for her ice tea.

The escargot was delicious  (Really, food wimps, it just tastes like shellfish.  Just think ""shellfish"" the whole time you're eating it!) and they were nice enough to make mine without spinach since cooked spinach is one of the very few things I hate. Second course, my boyfriend got the lamb which was delicious, and served with Brussels sprouts. I swear, those are the hot new thing to serve right now, probably because they're delicious and they flawlessly take in whatever flavor surrounds them.  At La Tache, it was a peppery cream sauce which complimented everything on the plate - the lamb, the fingerling potatoes, and the sprouts. Awesome. As for me, I got the gnocchi and ratatouille.  I love ratatouille and theirs was right on par with the stuff I make at home.  That's not an insult since I consider myself a pretty blasted good cook.  The gnocchi was really creamy and had an interesting spiciness to it that I enjoyed. Dessert was key lime pie for both of us and it was phenomenal.  That crust had TONS of real butter in it.  You could literally taste butter in every bite.  Oh man...delicious. The only thing I don't like about La Tache is the booze.  I have been pretty ""meh"" about the wines and apertifs I've had there, except for their tawny port.   I guess all that means is I'm going to have to go back and have a smaller check because I'm focusing my funds and taste buds on delicious food.  Can I get an ironic, ""Oh noes!""?",0.9929,0.786,0.184,0.029,0.638411000763942

2009-11-02,4.0,"It took me a while to write this review because I was in the middle of stuffing my face with some delicious leftovers. Let me backup and tell you how I got them. A Monday night $20 three course prix fixe enticed me in.  It got your attention, too, didn't it? Course one kicked off the meal with a choice of salad or soup.  I selected a salad with apples and pecans over a large bed of mixed greens.  So light and tasty!  Course two offered several entrée options, including some obvious French-inspired dishes (bouillabaisse!).  The roasted chicken and mashed potatoes called my name that night and I fell in love.  A huge portion of oh-so tender, juicy chicken was served over creamy, flavorful mashed potatoes.  Even though I was tempted to lick my plate clean, my stuffed belly stopped me and I left with plenty of leftovers for another meal.   To get your sugar fix, course three's dessert list won't disappoint.  I spied their take on carrot cake.  Typically, I'm not a sugary sweets person.  Carrot cake usually has far too much frosting for my taste, so I'm usually leaving behind a nice scoop of frosting* on my plate.  With almost sheer bliss, I watched as this version was brought to the table.  It was more like a carrot cake muffin made in a coffee mug, with just a smattering of whipped cream frosting on top.  Ah, just the right amount for me. You may already be sold on the prix fixe menu and are surely asking about their beverages.  While I only glanced at their wine list, pay attention when I say they have $12 martinis.  That means $12 for whatever grade of booze (i.e. the cost is the same if you select ""house"" or Grey Goose vodka).  Just sayin' you could get yourself a killer martini made with fine booze.  Be picky, it's OK.  And, yes, they also have an acceptable selection of whisk(e)ys. The service was amazing.  They accommodated my group of hungry Yelpers without hesitation.  The chef even sent out complementary appetizers for us, including some escargot.  Bravo! I never went to the ""old version"" of La Tache, so have no reference point.  Whatever they did to change certainly was for the better.  I'll definitely be back again, especially to take advantage of the prix fixe.  See you on a Monday! *My sincere apologies go out to the frosting lovers out there mourning the loss of their sugary desires.  Eat dessert with me sometime and that scoop is yours.",0.9919,0.814,0.146,0.04,0.5391784641784642

We will certainly continue to dine at La Tache in the future. It's a nice neighborhood place with friendly people and good food.

We went again last night, and our friends were very pleased with our selection.  They wanted to go to Tomboy, but it's closed :-(   It got crowded but our server was attentive and we were never rushed even though we arrived early and our friends arrived late and we had a ton of questions.  We were there for a few hours. All four of us LOVED our apps (Tart du Jour), salads (one was special ordered since she just wanted a spinach salad- she really enjoyed it except for some croutons that she felt came out of a bag and weren't worth it), entrees, and dessert.  One got a stuffed fish that was very tasty.  Another got a roasted chicken with some gnocchi on top- I tried the gnocchi and loved it!  My gf got some scallops over a bed of risotto with potatoes and salmon.  Exquisite!  I got the mixed vegetables with polenta.  I ate all of the polenta, except what I shared with my companions.  Everyone raved over the polenta!  I wish I had some leftovers in my fridge but it was just too good!  The dessert was s'mores bread pudding with some chocolate ice cream.  Mmmm!",0.9969,0.771,0.208,0.021,0.5177035330261137

As is typical on those nights like NYE, V-day, etc. you expect the food and service to be less than impressive because of the crowds and special menus but this took the cake on bad service and, although not horrible, completely bland food. One positve note is that it's a cute little restaurant tucked on a side street - very cozy and romantic if not for the crummy food and service. The minute we walked in the door we were made to feel unwelcome and things went down hill from there. First we were rushed and then we couldn't find our surely waiter to take our order to save our lives. I had to flag down the barmaid to ask her to shag our waiter's butt over to our table and at one point we had to get up and go to the bar ourselves to get glasses for the bottle of wine we ordered.  With a prix fixe menu of limited choices you'd think things would come out fast, hot and fresh. Yuck, yuck and yuck is what we got. My oyster appetizer seemed like it had been sitting around for awhile and my entree came out lukewarm. The only passable dishes were the salad and the dessert which was also served to us in a lack luster, eat-it-and-get-out kind of way.

Atmosphere and decor is so cozy and reminiscent of a real French bistro--lovely dark-wood paneling, fireplace, and antique furniture.  But the service was refreshingly unpretentious and down-to-earth, from the warm, laid-back server to the pleasant bartender.

2008-06-02,1.0,"Been here a couple times in the past few months.  Once for dinner and once for their brunch.   Lets start with something positive - the atmosphere is nice and it is in a great neighborhood for walking.   Dinner was a grilled portobella mushroom entree and it was okay.  I find that cleaning out the gills with a spoon first helps to reduce some of the earthiness (read as ""grit"") but for the most part it was decent.  The appetizers we shared (a group of seven) and every one was decent.  The cocktails were strong, also a positive.  Overall, from the first dinner visit, it was worth returning to in the future. Well, the future came yesterday for brunch.  We shared a breakfast appetizer of pancakes with bacon and carmelized onion that came with real maple syrup.  One of the pancakes was charred (burnt) so badly on the outside I was shocked that they would even serve it.  It was black.  I had a sinking feeling this was not going to go well, but who could complain?  Not us.  The waiter had been missing for over 15 minutes.   Another ten minutes passed before she managed to make it back to our table, at that point, what is the use in complaining?  Finally the breakfast entrees were served.  We all got something different and apparently they cook one person's breakfast at a time and wait until all of them are ready for service.   I assumes this because the french toast was so cold, the butter would not melt on it.  For the quality of restaurant they are supposed to be, IHOP does a better job with breakfast.   The brioche was apparently coated with the egg mixture long enough to get wet and nothing else.  The center was literally dry brioche.  The egg mixture wasn't soaked in at all.   This was served with a side of ""in season"" fruit... cantaloupe, honeydew, and one bite of pineapple.    None of the fruit was actually ripe.  One bite of the cantaloupe and it was hard and lacked flavor.   It might have been worth saying something to the waitress, but she couldn't be found, at least not anywhere near our table.   Breakfast isn't hard, but it can tell if a chef has the most basic skills.  A fry cook at IHOP does better.   So what did I learn from these two experiences?   1) If you go, go for dinner  2) If you want brunch - try  Olde Country Buffett - I hear they have dried out cold french toast as well.",0.9819,0.84,0.116,0.044,0.41365151515151516

The interior is classic- clean white tile floor, soft amber lighting, small bar area and best of all- a nice little sitting area near the door with a fireplace where guests can wait for their table.  Since they do not take reservations (unless you have a large group) this is a thoughtful touch. The food was perfect.  I like my French bistro fare, and messing around with it is a dangerous proposition.  Get the basics right and everything will be good.  Add a dash of creativity and you either take it to the next level or wreck it.  Everything our group got was just great, even the creative interpretations hit!  I'd recommend everything we ordered- but I picked the best stuff of our group: The wine list was heavy on French wine (as expected) but a nice range of price options are included.  For dinner I started with a great Salad Lyonnaise- the use of French fries in lieu of red potatoes was a yummy twist, that's for sure!  My main dish of Chicken Cordon Bleu was not the type of thing I'd normally order, but it was fabulous- breaded and fried just right, and delicious ham and cheese on the inside.  The Swiss chard and mashed potatoes on the side made for quite a large meal!   For dessert I ordered a maple butter stuffed pear in wine sauce.  Yeah, it tasted as good as expected- hard to beat, eh? Our waiter was impeccable.  He told us about his specials up front, the food arrived hot, and he checked on us enough without being a pain.  Service shouldn't be that hard to get right, but rarely do I find it so.  Our guy was a professional and low key- so nice!
