They said that they would be more than happy to accommodate that. When we got there, there was a private party that had booked the restaurant. The music was blaring and the place was packed. They sent us off to Boka, their other restaurant down the street, saying that we'd get a break on our bill and that they'd already called to make sure that there was a quiet table for us. When we got to Boka, they sat us next to the noisy bar and gave us just 10% off our bill (i.e. $10). Now, the private party would have booked the Landmark in advance.

The pretzel appetizer was very good, and came with cheese dip, which we all loved, and a honey mustard sauce that only my mom liked.  It looked more like thick italian dressing than anything.  The three cheese pizza was ok--toward the middle of the pizza was a little soggy, but the outer crust was crunchy and phenomenal! The strange thing about our experience was the waiter.  It's not that he wasn't attentive, because he was, it's just that he was a little...off.  He would come over while almost dancing and that's how he stood at our table as well.  I don't think he was physically able to keep still.  Almost like when a toddler needs to use the bathroom, and they're doing the ""dance"" (don't pretend like you don't know what I am talking about!!).

My hubby had the polenta frites and the skirt steak sandwich. I will just say that I was expecting not to like the truffled ranch dipping sauce for the polenta frites, but I was wrong. I fully admit it. That stuff is awesome. Of course, so were the frites.

2011-04-28,3.0,"Slap someone's face, is what you'd prolly want to do after sucking down a slice or 7 of Landmark's gourmet thin pizzas.  While I wish they'd go back to the old recipe, today's offerings are still much better than the average bear's.  Tender slices of roasted mushrooms sit on top of a tasty, buttery, crispy thin crust.  One dear friend who'd just returned from Italy said that nothing she had there could touch Landmark's pizza. And while the gnocchi and fish & chips apps are decent, their new chef, freshly-plucked from the bowels of the Kentucky, knows how to make ONE HELL of a luxurious semifreddo dessert. (It tastes like somewhere between upscale ice cream and a silky mousse.) The bits of hazelnut and red wine flavor come through in this dish, while the drizzled chocolate sauce makes it pure gluttony. In early 2009, a group of us found out about Landmark's old Wednesday night promotion that ran from 5-7pm, which offered free thin, gourmet pizzas, half-priced bottles and $5 martinis. (Is now held on Wednesdays between 7-8pm, only one complimentary pizza when buying half-priced bottles.)  We briefly made it our mid-week touchdown but got distracted eventually. The bartender at that time took great care of us by pouring generously and keeping the pizzas coming as fast as we could gobble them down and let me tell ya.. the black truffle mushroom pizza was the BEST in the city! Fast forward a few years later... after several regime changes Landmark is now jam-packed on Wednesdays, has a great vibe, new management and more to do than the servers can keep up with.  It's difficult to handle such a crush of theatre patrons at once while servicing the regular bar types, so it's a challenge I personally do not envy.   Just don't go here in a mad hurry unless it's very early.  The place is well-presented, has a nice vibe and more importantly the food adds another feather in the neighborhood's cap.",0.9887,0.802,0.155,0.043,0.4934281274281275

Then we had the grilled baby octopus and mixed green salad. It was tasty, but we had to laugh at how little octopus we got - one piece each that was about one-inch long. The braised short rib was tender and juicy and I liked our side dish, green beans with almonds and raisins, so much, I'm going to try making them at home. As I mentioned, service was fantastic.

The food is okay - it's not a culinary delight, but it doesn't claim to be either. Landmark has a nice bar area, though seating is a big scarce. Cocktails are going to run you at least $10, even for a basic mixed drink. The decor is stylish without trying too hard, although there was a great deal of animal-print. When it comes to the quality of the food, Landmark is comparable to a Hub 51 or Luxbar. Of course, it has all the usual suspects popping up on ""trendy"" menus: pork belly, polenta frites, mac-n-cheese, brussel sprouts. When push came to shove, my whitefish was well-cooked but oversalted and the gigantic chocolate chip cookie was about a day away from stale. Landmark offers several specials during the week, including 50% off wine on Wednesdays, and it seems there are plenty of deals available on  restaurant.com , but I wouldn't consider this a must-stop destination.

I give this restaurant 3 stars because the bartender who served us for those 45 minutes was mixing up great cocktails and was super friendly and our waiter at the table who was quite witty and knew the menu front and back (although the three items that he recommended were the three most expensive - hate it when that happens.  I'm not a cheapy when it come to going out at restaurants, but there must be something just as good as the short rib that's not in the $25-30 range, right?)  Also, our meals were amazing.  We had two pizzas to the table - the chef's special buffalo chicken and the three mushroom with truffle oil - both amazing.  I had the salmon with shrimp and dates for my entree- delish!   If I go back to this restaurant, it will be for wine wednesdays - 1/2 price bottle of wine and pizzas.  I'll probably go with a smaller group as it's easier to get a table for 4 or less and definitely not for dinner.",0.9874,0.883,0.102,0.015,0.5426820728291316

2010-12-19,3.0,"This was our 2nd visit to the Landmark Grill.  As others have said, the decor is nice; we sat upstairs which is a bit quieter and a great spot to people watch.  First visit we shared 3 ""small plates"" and a wood-burning pizza.  This time, we were hungrier, so we ordered an entree each as well as an appetizer and a salad.  Both times we also ordered a bottle of wine.  The wine list, while not extensive is reasonable and not too overpriced for a Chicago restaurant.  The salad and appetizer were split for us in the kitchen -- a nice touch.  The gnocchi were very flavorful and nicely presented; the beet salad exceptional, especially with the balsamic dressing offsetting the flavor of the red and golden beets. For entrees, we had the duck breast and the pork chop.  Both very well made, cooked to our specifications, presented very nicely, and of sufficient quantity that we were both able to eat until we were sated and still have plenty to box up and take home. The server and the rest of the staff were as nice as could be.  I appreciated having been asked several times whether we were on a pre-theatre deadline -- when I made the reservation, when the hostess seated us, and when the server came to take our order.  At one point between cocktails and the actual placing of the order there was a longer than usual delay, for which the server profusely apologized, explaining that a large party being served their entrees had taken him briefly away from his station.  The only miss (until the end of the meal -- see next paragraph) was that after being asked at one point if we wanted more bread and answering affirmatively, we never received any.  Whether this was the server's fault or the bus staff's fault is not clear, but it was a bit disappointing. The only downside to the entire experience came at the very end of the meal.  We chose to skip dessert but order some cappuccino to sip and enjoy before facing the cold outside world.  The caps were served promptly with little spoons, but no sugar/sweetener.  Luckily neither of us needed sweetener so that was OK.  However, after a few sips, it was clear my wife's cap, while hot, and with a nice head of foam, had absolutely no coffee in it.  It was a cup of warm steamed milk.  It took a few moments to flag down our server to ask for replacement beverages.   While he immediately agreed to remake both our drinks (mine having grown cold by then) he proceeded to tell us a tale of how he was training someone else, didn't watch them closely, will tell them to do better next time, etc.  I don't care what the reason for the error was; I just wanted to be made right.  Also, when delivering the two new cappuccinos, our server graciously assured us that we would only be charged for one.  It wasn't worth debating at the time, bu the fact that we needed them remade should have made both of them free, IMO. I would still go back; I enjoyed the food and the ambiance.  However, the few small missteps that detracted from what could have been an outstanding experience make me rate this restaurant just a bit lower and place this cautionary note on my review.",0.9874,0.824,0.116,0.06,0.5305453342953343

We started with the mushroom/truffle pizza - very good, a nice size for an individual main course, but worked as an appetizer. Then we shared some small plates - the pork belly was really really good but a very small portion of actual pork belly.... we tried the polenta fries - they were decent, but I would probably pass on them next time... and lastly we had the lamb special with Israeli couscous - the lamb was very good, but surprisingly not tender (it took work to get it off the bone)...  Overall, I'm going to have to agree with an earlier review that the food is very good, but not particularly memorable or mind-blowing (I am just perhaps spoiled with the high-standard Chicago restaurants have set).",0.996,0.711,0.289,0.0,0.5325258799171841

All the food was fine, just not particularly memorable one way or another. The service? That's a different story. Usually it's good, but when I came on my last visit for dinner it was just strange. For starters this girl kept continuing coming around to our table and asking if my friends and I wanted water. YES. If our glasses are empty then please pour water! Really? There's no need to ask it's just awkward. Our waiter at first seemed nice, but got stranger as the dinner wore on. Upon receiving the bill and paying with a credit card he forgot a pen and my customer copy of the credit card receipt. When I asked him about it he merely shrugged.

2010-11-06,4.0,"I bought 2 Groupons for Landmark a while ago and have been here twice... the first time with a friend for dinner.  We sat in the main dining room.  Second time with my boyfriend on a Friday night. I was dumb and tried to make a reservation the day before but they were full.  We decided to go anyways and try our luck with getting a seat at the bar.  We got there around 6:30 on a Friday night.  The bar area is small but we found a place to stand and eventually grabbed 2 seats after two other women got up to leave.  Drinks:  I love that they serve Goose Island Mathilda.  I don't often see the beer- but I actually tried it here first and really loved it.  They have some other nice bottled beers that I don't normally see.  Both nights we stuck to beer. Food: Deviled Eggs:  Delicious. But 3 eggs for $9 ?  3 ?  That is such an awkward number. If I had been out to eat with another couple I definitely would have almost been annoyed.  Personally I believe that any party of 4 should be able to share an appetizer and have everyone at least have a bite. Especially for $9. Pommes Frites:  We didn't actually get the fries but the women who gave us their seats RAVED about them.  They said that the fries were wonderfully seasoned with cracked pepper and came with a great dipping sauce. Tomato Mac and Cheese:  The first time I had it I loved it.  Second time, it was good, but just not as impressive. Mushroom Pizza:  HOLY TOLEDO WAS THIS PIZZA PHENOMENAL.  I'm pretty sure my eyes fully bugged out of my head after I took my first bite.  I was flabbergasted that pizza could be so delicious.  Everything about it was absolutely phenomenal.  If you like mushrooms what so ever... GET IT! Can't remember what else I got the first time... but I'm pretty sure it was a fish entree and was fabulous. Honestly, not a SINGLE complaint about the food.  Everything was impeccable. Service:  Great.  The first time our waiter was very knowledgeable, friendly, and pretty attentive.  We actually did have to wait a very long time to initially talk to someone.  However, I've been a server myself for a long time and understand that it could have been the fault of several different people... and 65% of the time is not the fault of the actual server that takes care of you. The second time when we ate at the bar I just went up to the bar for drinks and to order food since we had been standing.  (We didn't get our seats until after our food order was put in). I'm 21 and a girl... I realize that bartenders always assume I'm going to leave them a shit tip (seriously though ladies... start tipping better).  Keeping this in mind, I always extra-appreciate when I get good service at a bar... especially from female bartenders.  Even with the groupon the bartenders were friendly and very professional.   Overall, I would love to give Landmark 5 stars.  But the limited seating and overpriced items (such as certain appetizers) is really holding me back.  I would love to go back, but definitely can't afford to go regularly without coupons.  But the food is sooooo good ! Oh but they do have that 1/2 wine Wed with free pizzas... I will definitely be going on a Wednesday.",0.9992,0.722,0.229,0.05,0.49843673687423706

Too bad the nothing-special cocktails are $11 each.  I would need to spend $55 for a slight buzz, there goes my groupon. Deciding to wait to get drunk until after dinner let me only try out two $11 cocktails, mas o menos, the tequila drink, and the first one on the list, with gin.  Both were absolutely not worth $11.  Nothing special like I said, and give me $3 and I will make you a much better tequila sunrise. I'm giving Landmark 3 stars instead of 2 because I love the decor.  I love the calm wood interior giving it a lounge-y feel.  Also, the food, which I will get to in a second, was actually great quality.  Also, of course, we waited until the last two days before the groupon expired so the place was PACKED with every one having the same idea as myself.  We waited 30 minutes to get a table, not bad. That being said, on to the food: We started out with the shrimp cocktail appetizer... for $12, I expect the waiter/chef/whoever to give my boyfriend and I (a table of 2) either TWO or FOUR shrimp, not THREE. When the three shrimp came out, we really thought it was a joke with the fourth coming on it's way.  But, it never came, so we split the third shrimp in half.  How nice of my boyfriend to give me the larger half.  Good quality shrimp yes, but common, THREE? We also split the fried polenta appetizer.  I was reaaaally looking forward to some amazing pommes frittes, french fries are my favorite food, so thought why not try the polenta? Welllll, do you remember ever getting burger king breakfast french toast sticks?  They tasted almost identical, but personally, I would rather have the BK french toast sticks because they have more flavor.  Yeah, no thanks to that appetizer. My boyfriend got the special, beef ribs with blue cheese mashed potatoes and broccoli.  VERY small plate once again, with the potatoes being good and broccoli tasting like they doused it in some extremely potent herb that made your face cringe and spit it out.  EW.  terrible.  Ribs again, were great quality and enjoyable for whatever was there. I, of course always choosing the best dish, got the burger.  It was great.  Nothing to complain about EXCEEEPT the shoe string chips on the plate.  Like, can't they give some french fries or AT LEAST maybe a vegetable???! but SHOE STRINGS?? By shoe strings I mean those realllly thin chips that come from that big tin can at the supermarket.  Other than that (which to me, is kind of a big deal) the meal was very good.  By meal, I mean burger.  It was also pretty filling unlike the rest of the plates we ordered.

All in all it was an enjoyable experience.  The wait staff and management were very attentive but not over bearing.  Due to it being a slow night they let us sit for awhile after our dinner as there was no one waiting.   Very accessible by public transportation which is a plus for us with out cars.  While we took the 22 bus and walked over due to the weather, the red-line stop is diagonal from the restaurant...and now you can check out the new Apple store after dinner.",0.9743,0.855,0.112,0.033,0.5189398644833428

Reuben is a well trained chef (and his mac and cheese are worth a side); the manager Jeff Wilson will see that all is perfect; and the waitstaff professional: (Lauren or Brian).

Who wants bacon with their lobster on wheat bread, but I thought that they may be creative enough to pull it off. I was wrong. 3 slices of thick wheat bread with only a few ounces of lobster with bacon does not make for a good sandwich.  GREAT atmosphere and waiting staff. When I walked in, the host put me at the worst table in the house and I asked to move, but I wont hold that against them. My waitress was great and the ambiance was on point.

We didn't have a private room or anything like that, but our server was super attentive and made sure to consistently check in that we had everything we needed.  We were kind of split about ordering entrees, so we all ended up getting a bunch of appetizers, pizzas, and sides to make it tapas style evening.  I actually like almost everything I had, except for a pizza that had a few toppings that weren't quite my steeze. What impressed me was how accommodating they were.  They gave us a great spot, were super helpful and friendly, and treated our table with respect and attention though we weren't exactly screaming ""high rollers"".

A decent Groupon came into play and thought certainly after a few years improvement must have occurred if they are still open. Not quite! First our waiter was horrible! told us he didn't have a preference of when we presented our groupon, yet told a table after us he preferred it at the end. However the final bill was calculated by hand our discount...what did it really matter? That's not why he irritated me with. We had 6:15 rests with no theater. We were celebrating an anniversary. I had a relaxing dinner in mind. We ordered cocktails he came as soon as they arrived and asked if we wanted a starter; so we ordered our first course. He stopped us and suggested that we make the experience more enjoyable and order all courses together in order to avoid a back up in the kitchen as they will most certainly get busy, and a disruption in our dining experience. I explained to him I did not want to be rushed thru my courses and he guaranteed me he would follow my pace. Needless to say 20 mins later we had desert and a half a bottle of wine left. NOT to mention the largest pork chop that even the bus boy exclaimed it required a T-shirt and polaroid! It was straight out of The Great Outdoors 96ozs, gristle fat and all!!! So the manager came to our table THE second we got our food and asked us how we enjoyed our meat? Uhhhhhh I don't know yet. We left and Chris asked me when did our waiter think the kitchen would get busy??  NO STARS!!!    Yet Yelp forces me with one star....

2010-08-03,3.0,"I have been here once for a birthday party and once to get drinks after I was denied entry to The Vibe (a place trying to be something it is not). Both times, I have had a good time. The first time was to celebrate birthdays, so we had the upstairs to ourselves which was nice since the first floor was somewhat crowded, the only downside was that the bathroom was in the basement and navigating up and down stairs while being buzzed is not always fun. During the party, the drinks came in a timely fashion and when everyone was in the mood for some chow, we all decided to order pizza which was pretty good. Now I am not sure if it was because of all the drinks we had, but the pizza was gone in a heart beat. The second time I was here, like I stated above, I was denied at The Vibe for not being in proper ""clubbing"" attire (who does that these days), so a friend and I decided to walk here and get some drinks while our friends, who did get in, tried to figure out a game plan. the place was not packed, but had a good amount of people here. As soon as we got up to the bar, we ordered some scotch, when a representative for Chivas Regal over heard us and decided to let us try the different levels of their drinks on the house. After about 4 glasses of scotch, my friend and I were feeling good and ready to hit up the next spot. This is a great place to grab drinks and hangout with friends. I am not sure about and the food, from my first visit there seemed to be good. The only wish I had was that the first floor needed more seating for people that were only there for drinks.

Nice and very appreciated. We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and our two entrees. The waitress also made sure my dish was dairy free, which is extremely rare and amazing that she did so. When it was time for dessert we said no, thanks - we're full. They brought out two different desserts anyway just because we were celebrating.

We ordered 3 appetizers: Goat Cheese Ravioli, Oven Roasted Mussels, and Potato Latkes  and Main Course: Roasted Mushrooms Pizza In my opinion, the food overall was ok, nothing special, but not bad.  Aside from the food itself, we didn't really have a good experience. We ordered a bottle of wine and our server in charge of the wine put it in an ice bucket on the bar counter along with the other tables after pouring our first glass. Keep in mind, each of our servings was very little, barely a quarter of a half glass. He didn't refill our glasses for a while, and when we asked another server who gave us our food, he told us he wasn't in charge of the wine and that he would get in trouble, which was fine. We still had a hard time getting our original wine server, so we asked another server. He refilled our glasses, and again, each of our glasses was barely a quarter of a half glass. Mine was the last glass to be filled and he finished the bottle! My friends and I knew right there that that was NOT our original bottle. When we finally got a hold of our original wine server, I kindly simply let him know what happened and that we thought our bottles got switched with the table next to ours since they ordered the same wine. He denied it and told us that that was ""our"" bottle, and what we had equaled to one bottle. We didn't want to argue so we just let it go. 3 ladies - each person had 2 glasses of wine - 2 glasses barely equaled to half of a glass.... Maybe if each table had its own bottle at each table, there wouldn't be a problem! If the server had an attitude about it, we wouldn't have tipped him. But at the same time, he didn't offer to help and was sure of himself that we were wrong. That was why we did not tip him the full 20%.  I would go back only because the restaurant itself is really nice. The decor and lighting makes it intimate and private.

2010-06-18,5.0,"HOW? How do you NOT give Landmark 5 stars and counting? I don't get it. My experience was nothing short of spectacular and I am excited and proud to Yelp about it. Seriously people, seriously. Thanks to (yet another) Groupon, my bff and I headed next door from her apartment for a Wednesday night Landmark dinner. Normally on Wednesday nights we would probably order the half price wine bottles and get a free pizza but that wasn't an option with the Groupon so we opted for a more traditional meal.  First off, I was able to make a reservation online and we were seated in a nice big booth. Then we were greeted with an option of tap or bottled water by our very friendly and sweet server, Lauren. After she asked us about any dietary/allergy restrictions, she went over the menu and drink menu with us. I ordered a $10 glass of Cabarnet but if my bff had been drinking that night we probably would have done one of their 5 bottles under $25. Then, we picked her brain about her favorite menu options and had her help us decide between the potato latkes (we're talkin' about two Jews here) or the polenta frites. Her suggestion was the frites and ohdeargod was she on the money about these. They're made with semolina flour and polenta, crunchy on the outside and creamy on the inside. Coated in salt, parsley and garlic, these bad boys are served with an indescribable truffle ranch. Because they're made with polenta they're sweet and almost have the taste of a french toast stick. Then came our entree which we decided to split at the suggestion of Lauren (the meal choice and the splitting choice!). We got the pork chop which is served on top of bacon spatzle (little tiny German dumplings), with a homemade bbq sauce (perhaps hints of apple and fruit in there?) and this ridiculously good onion marmalade. When our two plates came out, I thought they made a mistake and gave us two entrees. I ate half of mine. That's ONE QUARTER of the entire meal. It was the greatest meat concoction I've ever put into my mouth (aaaand...that's what she said). The manager came over to check on us (which, by the way, I love when they do that) and he mentioned to us that this dish is meant to be a ""perfect bite"" dish. You're meant to get a little bit of everything in each bite. He was totally right. And at $27, the most expensive entree on the menu, this chop is totally worth its bite. And though we were still full, dessert had to be ordered of course. After debating between the cookie/ice cream combo or the peanut butter chocolate semifreddo, we went with the latter...yet again thanks to Lauren. A semifreddo is an Italian 'ice cream' dish that means ""semi-frozen"". Basically it's a mix between mousse and ice cream. And when it's served over a bed of crush peanuts, caramel, and pretzels....wow. So. Delish. Our grand total for a glass of wine, appetizer, entree, and dessert? $52 + tip/tax.

We have had unusually excellent servers each time we've gone (it was Nikki tonight, she was extremely helpful in food and wine selections and very attentive but not at all intrusive, great sense of humor too!).By the way, on our first visit our then 19 year old daughter was with us and the waiter was particularly gracious and sweet to her, really making her feel special.  Tonight I had a ""broccoli ash"" salad that was to die for. The broccoli is shaved so fine it is almost like a ""dust"" thus the name, and mixed with hints of mint, almond cream, candied orange zest and lemon, truly outstanding. The Tuna tar tare appetizer was amazing too and we all raved about our entrees and wine. Love the swivel chairs and the place settings which include individual bread knives. The only change I'd like to see is tablecloths--the rather casual place-mats don't seem to at all go with the ambiance of the room or the elegance of the place settings at all. Or use a dressier more unique place-mat. But that's a small thing, we always rave about our evenings at Landmark all the way home and have discovered that it is even good (probably better certainly more leisurely and relaxed) on evenings we are not rushing out to theater afterwards. The entire staff including bartender/bar servers (often the same person); front door check-in greeter, and restaurant manager all bend over backwards to be gracious Hosts and provide outstanding service. They must take advance yoga because they are outstanding at this bending over backwards skill!

Their specialty drinks, on the other hand, are awful.  They are way too sweet for my taste and I would rather just order a regular drink or beer here instead.  As far as the conversion to a semi night club/hangout spot after dinner, things are ok here.  They start carding at the door at around 11PM and a DJ plays.  The only thing is that the crowd varies.  A lot.  Sometimes, it is just boring. To be honest, I'd only come back to Landmark for the food..not really the drinks or after hours.  But the decor is very nice, and there are nice areas to host birthday outings for your friends upstairs.  The bars both upstairs and downstairs are pretty nice, but nothing to snuff about.",0.9944,0.704,0.25,0.046,0.6320465337132004

Debatable)...So, we couldn't get a table initially and went to the bar. The bar staff was so professional and personable that we wound up staying there, even though we later were offered a table. I asked for a Kir Royale and braced myself for whatever came out. I was very pleasantly surprised when it was done precisely right. We got polenta ""fries"" which were absolutely delicious and some sushi type tuna. It was all perfect! The only problem is that this place is definitely not cheap!

My boyfriend chose this place because it a sister of Boka and that is pretty evident in the menu selections. To start we had the beef carpaccio with pink peppercorn dust and a salted cod potato salad - really great contrasting textures. I also adored their bread and butter (i'm all about the bread and butter) For dinner I had the lobster club and finished every last bite - it was perfect and that bacon was tremendous. My boyfriend had the pork chop and when it was brought to the table our jaws dropped. It was huge and they brine it too so every bite was a juicy flavorful experience. We sat on the catwalk and had a great view of comings and goings below in the bar area. Oh and that Triple X martini was awesome!,0.993,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.7513888888888888

Me and the bf went last night for dinner at 6:15pm. We were literally the only people in the restaurant until about 7p when another couple came in to dine.  Now the inclement weather surely kept people away, but it was a pretty sad scene.  May also be why we enjoyed ourselves so much and received stellar service from the whole staff, not just David.  The restaurant is decorated for the holidays so beautifully. We had the goat cheese ravioli and polenta frites w/truffle ranch dip for apps.  The ravioli was recommended by David to complement the polenta, and it was the perfect choice.  Both dishes were beyond incredible and i would order them again...i couldn't imagine anyone not liking these two choices.  We split the grilled chicken for our entree, which was served with collard greens and sweet potato custard. The chef split our portion up for us and it came out beautifully and just the right amount.  The chicken was glazed in decadent sweetness and grilled to perfection. We could cut it with just our forks.  Then the cinnamon doughnut w/ice cream for dessert...just sent us over the top!  It was the perfect dessert for a snowy winter evening.

2009-12-06,3.0,"After a number of Wednesday evening visits I have mixed feelings about Landmark.   The Good: Food here is good.  The menu is a bit tamer than at Perenial or Boka, but the presentation helps elevate it above the ho-hum.  The wood fired pizzas are excellent and are one of the reasons my wife enjoys visiting here.  Also, the wine selection is above average making the Wednesday night wino deal a good one.  The layout/floor plan here is conducive for events, with a large open are around the bar and smaller nooks and crannies of seating good for conversation.   The Not So Good: I enjoy a well made cocktail.  I was first introduced to Landmark via the ""Sweet 16 of Mixology"" events help there, and so I would expect them to prepare a decent drink.  That is not always the case.  I typically order something classic (a Manhattan or Old Fashioned) when I am unsure of the bartenders capabilities.  The preparation here is not consistent.  Each bartender seems to prepare the drinks their own way and so while I really enjoy my first drink, the second can be disappointing (or vice-versa).   It really depends upon what you are looking for if Landmark is for you.  If you are looking for an intimate evening out this place is not it.  If you are looking for a place to go out and have some fun with friends Landmark will work fine (so long as they aren't cocktail snobs.)",0.9943,0.728,0.231,0.041,0.45092165898617503

The shoestring fries came alongside little squiggles of ketchup on the plate. The fries were all cold and very unappetizing. My friend's braised beef was tender, but bland. We had to ask for salt and more ketchup. They beef came accompanied with some type of bitter green stuffed phyllo dough rings. Sadly, my friend enjoyed the barley the most.

Ever been to dinner at a bar you've been to that's a major clusterf*ck?  That was Landmark for me.  It seemed a lot smaller without the scores of people crowding the first floor bar.  Judging by other reviews, there have been complaints about prices...but I was here for Wednesday, which if you pay attention to weekly specials, is VINO night, where bottles are 1/2 off, and where you receive 1 free pizza/bottle between 7-8p.   We got here a bit early around 630p, our waiter was extremely friendly.  Upon a cautious question about the free pizza, he casually said it was fine and that we could go ahead and order the pizza with our vino.  The majority of bottles are 40-50 dollars, so do the math, a bottle ends up around $25.  The only off-limit bottles are the ones already marked at $25.  There are only 4 pizzas to choose from unfortunately: 3 cheese, duck confit, pepperoni, and mushroom.  We opted for peppperoni, which was satisfying.  Ultra-thin crust, and seemingly coal-fired.  I also had an order of mussels, which were good.  However, the juice was a bit on the watery side, and while the garlicy bread that accompanied it was tasty, the dipped result was not quite up to par.   The rest of the menu I felt was neither cheap nor expensive.  I didn't taste any of it, but prices were pretty run of the mill.  Maybe it was a slow night, but I felt we got considerable attention from our server, and he was very pleasant, we never felt under pressure to order more.  Wednesday night @ Landmark is rad.",0.9859,0.829,0.138,0.033,0.6843749999999998

2009-06-13,2.0,"I'll start with the good, since this review is going to be mostly negative.... I may have had a one-off bad experience, but it was enough that I will not be returning any time soon. The Good: The ambiance/decor is great, and definitely cozy.  It's a nice lounge/bar area along with and upstairs and downstairs bar and tables for dining.  Our waiter was good, and attentive, and provided us recommendations on the wine to pair with dinner.  The bartenders at the bar were also great, and got our drinks quick when we actually ordered at the bar for our pre-dinner drinks. Unfortunately that's where the good ends. The Bad: The food is overrated and over priced for what you get.  If you are going to be dropping almost $30 on an entree, you should be satisfied.  I ordered the ribs, and they were just ""meh"".  Nothing to write home about, and they were tough.   All of us in the dinner party agreed the dinner was mediocre at best for the price.  The wine was good, but they didn't make it, that's the nice thing about wine, you get to blame the winery if it's good or bad, anywho I digress. After dinner, the area becomes more of a bar/lounge and the waitresses that were assigned to our area were full of unnecessary attitude and seemed annoyed that they even had to serve us.   After we placed our drink orders and had drinks in hand, we are then told there is a $25 minimum on the credit cards.  Normally this would be ok, but after you've been drinking wine with dinner, you don't necessarily need to be drinking another $25 worth of alcohol when you're still riding the buzz.  When I personally only had enough cash on hand to cover the exact cost of the drink, the waitress showed her discontent about no tip.  But you know what, I don't carry cash, and I do not like paying huge fees for the in-house ATMs.  Along with this, service was extremely slow, and you could get faster service by just walking up to the bar.  Not to mention the bitchy attitude which I would have not tipped anyways.  I must say, however, the bartenders at the actual bar were not like this. Regardless, I was there for my friend for her birthday so I enjoyed the company of my friends and the ambiance.  I would not come back by choice.  Since restaurants are in the service business, I would recommend evaluating how the waitresses are going to treat the customers.  There was no reason for the amount of attitude me and my guests received that evening.  That is all.",0.9962,0.739,0.184,0.077,0.6308333333333332

Which is superb- thank you for asking. This trip was solely to sample the starter and pizza menu- both of which I can assure you are well done. The duck confit pizza- prepared in the de rigeur wood oven is not to be missed, and is truly enhanced by the Radish Patch martini. The insightful bartender was more than happy to make recommendations from the cocktail menu, which was very helpful.

2009-05-30,5.0,"I must admit, I attended a private party here a few months back...and was not impressed. So far as that I would've said (before last night) that I'd never return. Snotty service (though, as I realize now that was a staff person of the event, not Landmark), packed to the gills, sparse food offerings. Mostly due As a result...it's charm and style was overshadowed by mini-skirts, bad bust jobs, and the like. A bad impression to say the least, and with so many options in the surrounding 'hoods...well, you see my point.  However, I never feel it's justified to judge a place based on an event that is thrown by a third party...and held off sharing my thoughts as that was my only experience with Landmark. However, as evidenced by the star-rating, they just happened to (totally) win me over last night.  So why would I go back? Well, my lovely friend's wedding rehearsal dinner was held in the second floor private area. A fabulous choice, as it turns out! Absolutely perfect, actually... Space: Large enough for a seated dinner for approximately 30. Well laid out, with a private bar (martinis!), and the room feels private while also allowing guests the pleausre of the buzz and energy. No doors blocking it off, etc. Gorgeous decor, deep blues, zebra prints. An elegant mix of modern and classic. Stunning, really...and very neutral. Not too feminine.   Food: A small menu was assembled and every dish was truly a pleasure. A starter salad (a bit over-salted, but I like that!) with pears, almond-ramp chicken with fava and morels (OMG, morels...be still my heart), and the fudgiest, sinfulest, most beautifully displayed brownie, EVER. Brownies aren't generally ""pretty,"" but these were just....breathtaking in a ""give me that, NOW!"" kind of way. With a carmalized banana and honey vanilla ice cream. Wowza.  Ok, so yes. The space is gorgeous, the location is easy and nice (LP, valet $10, close to the red line), but the true kicker: The service and staff.  It has been a great long while since I've experienced such truly, stellar service. Honestly, I felt as if we were royalty. They were absolutely on top of every minor detail, for each of the 25 or so guests. Immediate, water never left to sit below the half-way mark, all courses came out in waves with at least 5-6 servers so that everyone was presented with food at the very same time. Drinks made and presented quickly. Truly, I was blown away.  Yes, 25 is a large party...and of course I would hope for nothing but the best, but I've experienced much, much less attention to detail elsewhere.

2009-05-23,4.0,"Just got back from an early dinner at Landmark.  We saw a matinee at Steppenwolf and went for drinks and dinner after.   The decor is so odd.  On the one hand it seemed utterly tacky with weird bamboo and a palm frond pattern on the booths and yet somehow it kind of worked.  It wasn't ""themey"" at all but just some surprising choices for decor.  Definitely a 50's supper club feel. For appetizer we had the smoked salmon and it was very good, though just a touch salty. the greens that the salmon were wrapped around (some kind of sprout or shoot) were great and the sauce was excellent.  We both had the beet salad and it was exceptional.  I'm glad we both ordered it because I wouldn't have wanted to share.  Everyone has a beet salad on their menu these days and just about every place does the same beet-goat cheese-vinaigrette thing.  Here, no cheese but to give it that bit of fat and sweetness they sprinkle a few tiny swirls of deep fried shallot rings (like the cutest tiny onion rings) on top.   Husband had the pork chop, their signature dish, and it was huge and amazingly good.  We're both trying to be somewhat thoughtful about what we eat in terms of fat and calories and although the size of the pork chop was WAY out of the portion control zone, it seemed like otherwise a fairly healthy dish, served with a really nice bed of veg and lentils with a kind of bbq sauce. I had chicken roulettes, also very good and the bean/ morel mushroom side/garnish was amazing. It also came with a smoked chicken/potato cake that was just so so.   The service was excellent all around. From the host station to the water and bread service it was just top notch.   I was dying to try dessert, especially the cider donuts or the lemon cake. But somehow we managed to summon the willpower to skip it...  this time.  The wine selection was great because they had a good range of prices, including a section of ""wines for $50 or less"" and a section of ""wines for $25"".  We ended up with a Spanish red for $37 and it was very good. Overall experience was great and we'll be back again.   One tiny peeve though.  I am usually cool with the single bathroom without the men/women designation,  but both trips to the loo this evening required putting the toilet seat down. It's just a little gross.",0.9985,0.767,0.213,0.021,0.5548925264550264

We had a bottle of nine vines that was very good for the money.  Only issue I had is that I found out that they have both a dinner and a ""bar"" menu but we were only offered the dinner menu, I guess you had to ask about the bar menu.  (Pizza's and lighter fare)",0.867,0.866,0.134,0.0,0.69

There are also a few reserve selections as well.  Ciabatta bread was brought to the table and quickly devoured. The menu changes periodically to reflect changes in the season.  The menu is not a large one, but there are a few sandwiches if that is the direct you choose to go.  We had the beet salad and the mixed green salad to start followed by grilled trout and asparagus risotto.  Both were excellent.   Entree portions are right-sized, suitable for consumption by one person without feeling like you've been stuffed.  There are a variety of a la carte side dishes to choose form including mac and cheese (this one doesn't taste anything like the stuff that comes out of the box), grilled asparagus and a Brussels sprouts-bacon combination.  The sides were so good, someone might be tempted, on a return visit, to mix and match the sides for an eclectic meal.  Service was friendly and efficient.   Due to its location near the Halsted theaters, this would be an excellent pre- or post- theater choice for dinner.  Of course, the restaurant would be a good choice whether you're theatergoers or not.",0.9837,0.856,0.12,0.024,0.48814484126984126

We had a office outing here last night, and I was not too impressed. I like the design of this restaurant. It is rustic and urban at the same time. It almost feels like someone threw some modern furniture in someone's lakeside cabin home. Good job. The cocktail menu is pretty good. I recommend their ginger cocktail as well as the Asian pear. I also really liked their fifty bottles for under fifty dollars wine list. However, I wish they had more by the glass options.  In terms of food, I only tried the polenta fries (YUM), brisket on brioche dish (eh... just ok) and the mushroom pizza (good, but not spectacular).  I think Landmark is just mediocre.

The second time was after the Steppenwolf and we had food from what I think is their bar menu. The pizza was excellent. Last night I went back for dinner before the theater. The staff was very nice and asked us right away if we had theater plans for the evening which I really appreciated as I knew they would make sure that we got everything in a timely manner. Had the squash tortellini as an appetizer. It was good but didn't wow me. For my entree I had the braised short rib and the portion was HUGE. It came with a mole sauce which I really enjoyed. The only problem was that there war almost no sauce on the plate and two huge portions of the braised short ribs. I would have preferred more sauce, but it was good. My girlfriend had a cheeseburger which was really well done and very tasty. It came with a potato salad which I though was just OK. The server brought our check early and he really made sure that we had everything in a timely manner. They were excellent in this regard.

Happily, Landmark goes far beyond the easy money.   This place, which has been in business for four years yet has managed to stay off my personal restaurant radar until last night, serves up distinctive American eclectic food, presents it beautifully, and delivers it with impeccable service in surroundings that comfortably and elegantly blend modern style with art-deco romance. The lights are low, the upholstery comfortable, and every surface is visually delightful -- I feel like I could live in this place.  Specifics about the food: I had the short ribs with mole sauce, which were fork-tender and delicious (though a little spare on the sauce, so our excellent server quickly produced more when requested). My girlfriend had the mushroom risotto, which was topped with delicious citrus-dressed arugula; in the cosmic order of things, she felt it completely balanced out a less satisfactory risotto she had been served elsewhere. For dessert, we shared the pumpkin bread pudding with cranberries, topped with a scoop of maple-bourbon ice cream; it was a pleasantly sweet-and-tart ending for a romantic dining experience (though next time, we've been advised to try the peanut butter and chocolate semifredo, and who are we to argue?).

""is this our first time dining with us?""  um, that isn't even proper english, lady.  it was weird. i know they are trying to be cool and upscale, but all this just comes off as a bit overplayed and kind of sad. like an adolescent that stuffs her bra or something. but she was a good waitress, and nice, so i'll give her that. the service just doesn't quite fit the cool ambiance of this place. it's just swank enough, not over the top. the exposed brick does a lot to keep the artful light fixtures grounded. the only major design flaw was that the booths were covered in some horrible jungle print vinyl. i mean, yikes.  so i'm a san francisco girl. i am ALL about good food. i like my meat sustainable, my veggies local and my wine delectable. i can fairly say that landmark satisfies on all these counts. they only serve hormone-free meats, and all the beef is grass fed. they have a seasonal menu, so the veggies options reflect what you'll find in their local farmer's markets. and our bottle of tempranillo was delish.  however, the execution was kind of boring. i won't go into all the details, cause this is getting long. but let's just say it was good enough, not really good. not great. anot close to spectacular. and when i'm on vacation, i want fireworks in my mouth, ya know? when the manager stopped by to chat us up we filled him in on the water debacle. he was a super nice guy and found the whole thing kind of  funny, then asked what we say in SF. i told him we keep it simple, sparkling, bottled or tap. i really wanted to tell him how ridiculous and rude that water waitress was. but being a tourist, i just let it go. now hopefully the food fairies with bless me with an amazing meal next time i go out for being such a nice lil girl.",0.9884,0.786,0.131,0.083,0.5959798534798534

When some folks around me tried to snag a couple of drinks on another occasion, they received a similar treatment.

FOOD: Based on the food they served, color me disappointed.  Al dente is a good thing.  Broken teeth are not.  If you are going to serve risotto, a word to the wise is that you should make sure it is cooked enough that it isn't basically just arborio rice ...  ALCOHOL:  Well, I got drunk.  If that is a good sign, I guess Landmark has that going in its favor.  The mojitos seemed to be missing enough mint at some points or enough rum at others, but it still got me doing that stupid Bacardi mojito dance.  Come on, people, you know it ... :)   Overall, I'd guess that this place is probably trying to cater to too many interests.  That's just a guess, of course, but I'm not sure whether it is trying to be an upscale bar, a restaurant or what.  I'll give it another try (probably) at some other point, but when you are catering to 200+ junior reviewers/foodies and their guests, you better put your best foot forward.  Not terribly impressed Landmark.",0.9817,0.767,0.172,0.061,0.5323600668337511

2007-07-30,3.0,"I was excited that the Yelp event was going to be here since it was relatively close to where I live, and it would just be a short drive home if I were to be intoxicated.  The interior of the place is very trendy and fun, but that was mostly all that impressed me.  I do love a good mojito, but I have to say I was quite disappointed.  The very first one I got there was quite delicious.  It's surprising because you think that the more you drink the better drinks taste, but this was not the case for me.  The drinks were either too strong or not strong enough.  The risoto was okay.  The white one with salmon and the green one with mushrooms was decent, but nothing to rave about.  I was glad to have had dinner earlier elsewhere.  None of the appetizers were not very impressive and the food portion was quite disappointing actually.  I'd be hard pressed to have a meal here.  The service is only good if you are willing to tip.  I'm trying to be fair, because if I was waitressing that night and didn't get any tips - I wouldn't be so happy either...   I could see that at certain points there were just so many people just grabbing drinks off their trays, but I think if I were Landmark I would have made as much of the drink in advance as possible.  They were just so inconsistent in taste.  Of course, making them in a rush doesn't help.  I really wanted this to be a place I like because my friends live 2 buildings away, but I may only step in if they are buying...",0.995,0.728,0.217,0.055,0.6074748168498167
2007-07-30,3.0,"As most that know me, I'm very much the bar-holder-upper, and therefore the service behind said 1.5-2.5 feet of wood is paramount to my decision on liking a place, or not. Landmark have at least one great bartender in Zig, or Zigga as he was allowing me to call him the nights I was there one for Yelp's party and the other on Fri for a follow-up.  As for the Yelp party, No-One could keep the consistency of a mohitto after 2/300 of them have alreay gone out, so its no surprise that I heard complaints about the freebies, though Zigga was breaking his hump to look after everyone with a smile (v.tough). I blame mainly the 10 cane, which I think Jacob mentioned in here. The management while nice here, did not expect this to be as huge a party as it was and ran out of everything, mint including, and in some cases patience.They should have had at least one more bartender and two floor staff, but perhaps it was their intent not to give out free drinks/food so freely. I have worked these type of parties before, so I know that it is practiced like this frequently elsewhere. The decor is note-worthy, and this place was definitely filled with a different crowd on its original opening that i attended. Now they have a ""frat and sour"" crowd with that eerie look, like they've all shopped together at Abercrummie. Pity really but its hard to keep the crowd you want I suppose. When you want the $$ you take the crowd you get usually, not the one you may have wanted originally...

2007-07-29,3.0,"I was SUPER excited to learn this month's Yelp par-tay would be at the Landmark.  I have toyed with the idea of coming here for a post-work cocktail but knowing the swank factor is high, I usually find myself at the ol' stanby, Matisse.   Anyfoo-foo, after a few swirls at Uncle Julio's, I saddled up and made it over to the Landmark.  I did not sit down and eat here so my experience is based solely on mingling and drinking with fellow Yelpers.  First things first, there was a giant line to sign in and I knew this would be much better with a mojito in hand.  When I went to order one from the bartender he told me I would have to get one from a server.  Mmmkay, but the bar is right HERE.  A waitress overheard this and when I looked at her, she smiled quickly and scurried away with a tray of drinks.  The next waitress I made eye contact with was loading up her tray at the bar and she gave me that ""uh-uh honey, don't even think of taking a drink off this tray"" death glare.  As someone who has mastered her own death glare (a modern edgy twist on Brenda Walsh's) the waitress' look was impressive, but not useful for me, ""the drink seeker.""  FINALLY, I started waving bills in the air (a wise suggestion from Lee C) and the bartender hooked me up. What a production.  Drink in hand, my next mission was food.  Welcome to a whole new exhausting endeavor.  I managed to seek, follow and then finally snag a few appies - melon wrapped in serrano ham (soggy, ick), corndogs on a stick (who doesn't love a corndog?)  and skewers of cheese and mini tomatoes (ew).  What's the theme here?  Got me.  My boyfriend informed me there was a table of ""slop"" in the next room.  Finally I realized he was referring to the risotto.  What a random dish to serve. . . Overall, I concur that Landmark had some RUDE servers, weird dishes, and serious issues when it came to handling the Yelp crowd.  Getting anything here felt like a scavenger hunt.  The party for me, missed the mark and I did not stay long.  BUT I do appreciate the fact they a) were willing to host a Yelp party at all b) served up some pretty tasty and STRONG mojitos and c) had a cool bartender who in the end delivered.  I am not a fan of the ""half star"" system but I truly believe Landmark deserves a ""2.5"" - not as bad as a two but not as good as most of my other threes.  Maybe my experience will be different if I go back for a sit-down meal.  But I kind of have a bad taste in my mouth (damn those ham-wrapped melons) so I don't know how soon that will be.",0.9904,0.775,0.151,0.074,0.5335496392496394

I arrived around 8pm, and the place was PACKED - pretty much wall-to-wall people, with the occasional harried server protecting a tray full of mojitos writhing through the crowd.  Since our tardiness prevented us from scoring a table, we either had to wait 20+ minutes at the bar or hope that the Mojito Fairy would drop by drinks for two. On a similar note, I seemed to have missed most of the food at Landmark, which sounds quite delicious from some of the other reviews - especially the proscuitto & melon. Ah well, c'est la vie at Landmark. We did, however, score a free pizza from the bartender after most of the Yelpers left for the night. Shout out to the tall, blonde barkeep. It's hard to complain about free food and drink, but I just wasn't that impressed with Landmark. To be fair, I should probably try it for dinner one night, with a table, a server, and a check.

I also liked Zig the bartender who was working very hard along with all the other bartenders.  Other than that, I did not like one thing.  Well, that's not true either.  I liked the risotto with salmon on top of it, but it was a tad undercooked.  I do not like my risotto to crunch.  Also, the mojitos were bad, bad, bad. I'm giving Landmark and extra star for effort.  I'm sure that it's not easy to keep up with 200+ ravenous Yelpers.  However, other places that we have been to did not have any problem doing this.  Was Landmark unprepared?  Maybe.  For the life of me, I could not understand why I saw servers with just 3 or 4 mojitos on their trays.  In my opinion, they should be walking around with full trays of them to deliver to the tables and any thirsty Yelpers they run into along the way. What really got my goat last night was the service.  Yes, I know it's a big crowd clamoring for free drinks and food.  I get that.  I was a server at one time.  What I don't understand is why the following situations happened... Upon arriving at Landmark I spotted a server with a mojito on her tray.  I asked her if I could have the last drink.  Her reply was a snotty ""No.  This is for someone else"" and walked off.  Now a nice server who values customer service might have said ""I'm sorry, someone else is waiting for this one, but if you wait here I'll be back with some more as soon as I can."" I decided to get out of the crowd and head upstairs.  I noticed that there was a bar so I headed over to order a drink.  There was someone behind the bar and he said hello and then said ""just a minute"" because he was in the middle of doing something.  Then he walked off.  I don't know where he went.  I didn't know if he was coming back.  I waited with cash in hand for a drink...and I waited...and I waited...and I waited.  One of the servers who was nearby finally asked ""did you need something?""  YES!!  I'm standing at a bar, I would like a drink!  He told me that the bartender should be back soon.  Sorry, no thanks.  A nice bartender who values customer service might have said ""I have to go {do whatever it was he was doing} but I'll be right back to get you a drink."" That was it.  I was finished with Landmark.  It was hot and stuffy inside and I wanted to get the heck out of there as soon as I could.  Landmark might be a great place when they aren't hosting such a large party, but I'll never know.  They failed miserably last night and did nothing to make me want to come back and try them again.",0.9702,0.779,0.119,0.101,0.49923721340388005

2007-07-27,4.0,"First off, I'd like to thank Andrea and Elizabeth for throwing a fabulous party, 10 Cane Rum for the free booze, and Landmark Grill for providing us with the party as well as the free appetizers. Yesterday was my first ever Yelp event, so I didn't know what to expect.  We arrived at 8pm, we had to wait for our babysitter to arrive, fight traffic, and after circling around 2-3 times, we finally bit the bullet and paid for valet service.  Then there was the issue of a cash station.  The closest one was at a gas station about 3 blocks away...we had completely forgotten about getting cash and only had $40 between us, so we had to make due.  ( There is a parking garage a few blocks away on North Avenue as well....but my heels said no way in hell!) The place was packed, I think that there were way more than 200 people altogether.  Tons and tons of people actually, but the sign in line moved fast,( Thanks again A & E) and there was alot to take in.  The decor of the Landmark Grill is very cool.  We liked the catwalks, the lighting, and the layout.  Our first round of mojitos was fast.  We were able to taste several appetizers....probably because we were standing near the stairwell to the kitchen.  I am not sure what we had....I just tested their website to see if they were listed. (Note to Landmark Grill, I have a super super fast internet connection, and it still took forever to load.  I can't stand the flash or the music on the site.  If I hadn't wanted to check out the menu, I would have said ""Forget about it"".  I can't imagine someone with dial up checking it out.) From what I remembered, we had 2 kinds of risotto, fried dough stuffed with meat dipped in horseradish sauce, duck sausage pizza, cucumber and shrimp, some kind of brushetta, and I believe some rolled prosciutto meat?  Those that were serving the appetizers were very polite, offered napkins etc.  After reading others reviews, I guess we really lucked out and found a good spot.  The plates that were circulating weren't very full, and I also felt bad for the cook preparing the risotto.  I think that it's hard to make huge amounts of good risotto fast...there were too many hungry people waiting, so I am taking that into consideration.  The flavor was rich, and I'm sure that normally, it would have been cooked to perfection.  I agree with one reviewer, I don't think that they realized that there would be that many yelpers, or that we really really like to eat.  But realistically, the food was free, I didn't go expecting to get stuffed, and I believe that they did their best and I'm sure that it wasn't cheap.  So thank you for that. Our second round of mojitos actually took way over 25 minutes.  It was impossible to get near the bar.  There were some pretty inconsiderate people who would not move so that others could order , and every time a new round of mojitos were made, they laid claim to them.  We saw a few servers with trays full of mojitos but were told that those were reserved for people at tables.  Not overly friendly, but not rude either.  Again, I am sure that it was more than they had expected, and I am sure that some of the waiters were getting fed up.  I am disgusted to write that I saw alot of people not tipping last night.  I would have been surly too.  We finally made it to the other end of the bar and had to wait another 10 minutes...we didn't want to be annoying by waving our bills, so we just waited.  I could not help but feel bad as I know that the drinks are time consuming to make.  I think that as the night went on, the drinks weren't as good as they were in the beginning because of the rush and the amount of people waiting and shouting for more.  I'm not a drinker, so I was surprising that I actually liked this drink.  I would drink this at home if I had to drink.  I could still taste the mint, lime...it wasn't overpowered by the rum.  For those who complained about how weak their drinks were, I did look at the 10 Cane Rum's booklet, and only 2oz of rum is used in the recipe.....limes, and lots of ice and soda water so that may explain it.  They were getting low on the mint leaves, so none of the drinks had the 8-10 required, and I don't think that the bartenders had enough time to properly mud the ingredients so that may explain the loss of flavor for some. All in all, I think that A fabulous party was put together,  and I think that we will definitely return on a quieter night to enjoy a meal.  I am giving them the 4 stars because I think that they put alot of effort into the party, and again being free, it was more than I expected.  All in all the night cost us $15 for valet(It took about 15 minutes before we could locate the valet!), $10 in tipping for 4 drinks, and $35 for babysitting. I think that it was worth it to take on the experience and get a few hours with my husband.  I do have to say that I hope that the busboys were taken care of that night.  I can't imagine how many glasses and dishes that they had to wash!",0.9982,0.794,0.144,0.061,0.5544649988254639

I was ready to be the first pariah to report on a less-than-favourable experience last night at Landmark, so I feel a little better knowing that I can continue on my candid ways. Actually, it didn't really fall short of my expectations -- knowing that Landmark is a swankier bar place where you reserve tables with $250 bottles of Courvoisier meant that I was ready for snotty service and a clubby mentality. To be fair, most of the wait staff who had to weave their way through clustered Yelpers were patient and maintained a calm and pleasant composure, but unfortunately, the blonde who always seemed to steer by us gave us glares and a turned-up nose all night, and only one mojito -- actually, I stole it from her tray; she would never have given it to me. For what it had to be, the food was fine... I tasted a few appetisers, had a serving of two risottos, and was content to kick back on in a corner waiting for my next mojito to arrive. And when it did, there was no sugar in it... but by that point, I was just happy to up my body's alcohol content and I'd be hard-pressed to complain about a freebie. The space was nice enough, if dramatic overhead catwalks and exotic lighting was your thing (as well as $250 bottles of Courvoisier -- that is 62.5 pints of Goose Island for me at Guthries!).

The entrees were excellent: I had the sirloin which was served over a bed of potatoes.  They made it bloody just as I requested and it was a great cut of meat which melted in my mouth.  The potatoes had a slight mustard flavor and were also good.  I also ordered the side of wood grilled broccoli which was nice and fresh and had a good wood grilled flavor.  I was able to sample my girl's BBQ pork chop which was also very good.

Yelp Elite Event review: I really enjoyed the atmosphere, layout, and style of the building. It really offers the restaurant goer an adventure. Even from the outside ones gets the impression that they are leaving behind the bustle of daily city life and moving into a rich story plot. The lounge floor was an excellent environment for getting to know my fellow yelpers, also the right temperature, although the sound volume was a bit loud for 200 people, and tried to get away from the speakers. I loved the idea of a secret booth behind the curtain for those private affairs, and catwalk upper floor dining. The appetizers served were delicious, especially the different risotto dishes, and the salmon risotto was hardly fishy rather a smooth comfy taste. It made me feel warm inside. I realize this was a free event, and for party catering, it didn't seem like they understood that there were lots of people to serve. The bartenders seemed rushed, and the mojitos came out really heavy with tonic. I kept searching for the flavor in every glass. I would have rather gladly paid for a real mojito with some flavor. I also got to the event, and had to search for any trace of appetizers finally to find the risotto stand, but out of risotto. They just seemed under staffed, and while still very friendly there could have been a larger effort to accommodate a larger number of people.

2007-07-10,5.0,"Loved this place...we live literally a block away from here and this was our FIRST (??!) time in Landmark. Now...not coincidentally, we have two wee ones, so the bar is unfortunately not a place we are frequenting these days (what an amazing pick-up/singles place I could imagine...it reminded me of Bordo's circa 1998 on Lincoln -- that's a backhanded compliment, I guess). BUT -- the restaurant is what we were going for, and we were completely impressed. From the incredibly friendly host and hostess, to the friendly bus staff to the knowledgeable waiters (including a server who took our initial drink order to help his pal out of the weeds across the way, and still helped check up on us periodically). They all seemed to have each others backs, which -- if you've waited tables in Chicago as I have -- you'd know is not always the norm. So our actual server came, and he talked us through the menu (I had questions -- lots of organic produce and interesting menu items). He was completely up on all of the information: growers, chef's background (MK), the BOKA connection, the Michigan connection, et al. Very impressed by him (Kyle). We split an incredible wild ramp, morel mushroom risotto that was legitimately one of the smoothest and most savory I've ever had. The morels were wood-roasted, and added a great smokiness to the oniony-spice of the ramps. For entrees, Jacky had a Sockeye salmon with ratatouille that was phenomenal -- only quibble here: they served it skin side up which did not make for an appealing plating. Not quite sure of the method to the madness here: why not pretty pan-roasted pink side up? I had what is sure to be a talked about ""signature item"" -- beef tournedoes with an organic poached egg on swiss chard and an heirloom tomato relish...or, as the server put with a grin: ""Chef Browning's take on steak, eggs and ketchup!"" Love it! I hadn't made the connection between the beef, egg and tomato, and that sealed the deal. Turns out it was incredible -- perfectly cooked medium-rare, the poached egg blended with the relish on the plate and almost formed a delicious sauce -- an absolute joy to eat. We also enjoyed a bowl of wood-roasted wild mushrooms, also organically grown and purchased in the immediate area. If you're big on the trend of ""low mileage food,"" i.e., food that has not traveled far from earth to plate, this is your kind of place. For dessert -- they had an amazing selection of ""classic"" desserts with modern twists, and we had a Michigan strawberry shortcake with whipped mascarpone and a fresh-baked rosehip scone. Delicious!  Wine-wise, they have a great selection -- really great. Apparently the wine steward (not sure if he/she is a true sommelier) at BOKA picked this list, and they put together a very impressive $50+ list (including our favorite Hanzell Vineyards from Sonoma), and an equally impressive ""50 under 50"" list that included everything from domestic chardonnays to Italian reds to more exotic climes.  They informed us that they have ""wino"" Wednesdays in the bar early evening, and that even those already discounted bottles are 50% off...AND -- free pizza! We are going to check that out for sure. As we were leaving, we made our way through the pretty Trixie crowd, and the rapidly developing velvet rope line (so apparently babydoll dresses are all the rage this summer, eh? Seeing 143 of them all in the same cluster looked like I'd walked onto the movie set of a ""Beyond the Valley of the Dolls"" remake), and back to our babysitter and twins...sigh.

2007-03-11,4.0,"Love the decor and atmosphere.  The interior is very classy, and this bar and grill has been broken up a few different areas, each which has a different feel.  The cellar area bar is very loungy and chill, while the upstairs and main floors are more open and traditional.   The only downfall of Landmark is that it gets so crowded that it is hard to even move around without stepping on someone's toes.  I hear that the drinks are pricey as well.  But all in all, a fantastic time.",0.8718,0.805,0.149,0.046,0.5803571428571429

And even if that were the case, I would still have a less than mediocre time at this posh, overpriced joint.  I'd rather not go into early bankruptcy.

2007-03-04,4.0,"The atmosphere of this place is great.  The restaurant portion of this bar is very good.  I would say that the food it is more on the pricey side however the food is very delicious.  The food may not completely justify the price and that is why I lowered my 5 to a 4.   The music here is awesome.  Everytime I have come here, the music has been awesome.  I don't know who actually DJs the music here but they always tend to play the old-school hip hop and R&B that has not been heard in ages and brings back nostalgia.  The scene is for the young working class and the layout works out for either conversational settings or semi-dancefloor settings.  There are seats all-around the top floor and there is a upper floor for a more quiet seating area and also a bottom floor which typically is housed for private party occasions.",0.9574,0.858,0.134,0.008,0.5022549019607844

The food is delicious (especially the risotto), the atmosphere and decor are amazing, the drinks are great, staff is friendly, and it draws a very chic, though not overly pretentious crowd.

2006-11-11,2.0,I don't get it.. This place is basically mad river with drinks at twice the price... Who wants to pay $10 for a house vodka/redbull.  Its a fun place but quite possibly one of the most overpriced bars in all of Chicago for what you get. I don't get why people are so attracted to a place that sells drinks at twice the price of the other bars? (I came back to edit add the point that I went there at 11:00 for drinks - I have no idea how it is as a resturant).,0.4542,0.86,0.075,0.065,0.45357142857142857
2006-11-09,4.0,"I've gone here for dinner and partying on separate occasions.  This place has everything!  The food is awesome, with a constantly changing menu of top-notch selections.  The price is fair and you get a good portion.  The atmosphere is great, too.  There are different sections of the bar/restaurant so you can move around throughout the night and not be bored.  Finding people in the crowd (because there's not much seating) is made easy from the catwalk and balcony.  In the basement you'll find a small lounge, which looked cool for private parties.  The drink prices are standard for Lincoln Park and the bartenders know how to pour.  This place gets the trixie and chad crowd at night, but otherwise you can't have a bad time.",0.9471,0.838,0.162,0.0,0.6205555555555554

2006-09-26,4.0,"Wooo!! This was my first time to one of these ""nice"" contemporary food resturaunts. Eating by candlelight...fun! The food was really good, I had the skirt steak with black lentils and salsa verde. I have no idea why anyone would even put black lentils on anything because theyre really gross, but the steak with salsa verde was a LOT better than i thought steak with salsa on it would be. I would definitely eat it again. I think the Landmark has a good atmosphere for all sorts of occasions. I actually went on a Tuesday night, so the place was pretty empty, only about 4 tables taken including us and one of them was a party of about 8 coworkers who were pretty interesting to listen to, while my boyfriend and I sat by ourselves for a quiet dinner. I could definitely see just going with a group of people, though because it has a great atmosphere. Very sophisticated and relaxed. The meals range from $14 to $28 being the most expensive, and also being the ribeye steak which my boyfriend got and it was HUGE. Definitely worth it. Also, on Tuesdays I guess they have a ""free"" deal where you buy an entree and dessert and get the salad free or something. Wednesdays they had another deal for 1/2 off wine and when we went we had a $20 gift certificate that I had gotten in the mail. So it seems like they have some pretty good deals too for how expensive they are, I guess they're not really that expensive but for 2 college kids...it was expensive. $60 for us both to eat and we only had entrees. Anyway, its a good place to think about taking your girlfriend (hint! i guarantee youll score...)for a nice place to eat because it is so dim and there are little candles on all the tables!!

2006-03-27,3.0,"As stated previously, this place is near Steppenwolf and it does attract many people there after and before and therefore attracts a much older crowd.  It gets way too crowded in there and I still don't understand why.  The crowd is okay, very snooty.  The service is terrible there as well.  We had a table and it took 3 diff waiters/waitresses to take our order and it took forever.  My friend threw a party there and it again had awful service.  The place seems interesting because of the decor, but way too much hype.",0.6542,0.829,0.129,0.042,0.48999999999999994
2006-02-03,5.0,"This upscale bar and grill draws a very trendy crowd and tends to be very packed on weekends.  I especially love the lemon drop martini and the other drinks are great as well.  The ideal time to go would be early in order to get a table, otherwise you'll be enjoying your drink while moving out of the way of the many waiters throughout the night.  If you get a table be sure to try the margherita pizza- it's delicious! Edit 7/27/07 Last night Landmark hosted a Yelp event and I have to edit my previous review because of it.  Every staff member was so accomodating, from the manager to the bartenders who did such a great job.  I would highly recommend Landmark for a night out, or for a private function/party- they do an awesome job and I always have a good time when I'm there.",0.9892,0.741,0.247,0.013,0.6164327485380117

The night we went there, the bartender - a fabulous woman originally from Texas, and I'm sorry I forgot her name - recommended a DRY red wine that was really delicious. The duck sausage pizza from their bar menu is really delish. We'll go back there for dinner, as the smells from that wood oven were irresistable.
