2014-01-14,2.0,"Restaurant review Oh how I wanted to give you a 4 or 5 star based on my prior yelp elite friend visit. I went for lunch special and ended up with the basil fried rice and my wife had the pad thai. For the price from 7 to 10 dollars there is a variety of foods to chose. One downside is that the lunch special only comes with a soup (miso or hot/sour) which is ample, but a egg roll would have been nice instead. The server was nice and fast which was a plus. I was expecting the food would be good, but I ended up regretting the basil fried rice. There was the fragrance of thai basil, but lacked seasoning of sweetness. They must have used fresh pineapples that were not sweet at all because the pineapple had absolutely no taste which took away from the quality of the dish. My wife's pad thai was better, I couldn't say it was the best but well flavored and the noodles were not overcooked. Maybe it was what I ordered.... so try something else instead. Pro: variety of lunch deals, friendly service Cons: terrible basil fried rice with no flavor pineapple Hidden gem: 1. Lunch specials (CHECK OUT MY PIC OF THE MENU FOR FULL LIST) 2.

Something has changed recently though.  Lots of new faces (perhaps new management?).  The sushi is still good.  The service on my last three visits has been bad.  The last time we were ignored.  25 minutes to put in a (lunch) order.  Food was prepared and then sat for 20 minutes before being brought to the table.  The wrong soup was brought out.  And we could not get anyone's attention.  After the last meal I complained to the manager, Zoe.  She apologized, comped the soup, and gave a hand-written coupon for a free Dragon Roll on the next visit.  This seemed like good customer service at the time, but when I tried to use the coupon I was told, ""Zoe is not here so you cannot use this.""

She then proceeded to charge me full price for the seafood dish when I received a dish with much less expensive components. I asked her to comp some of the price and she refused. I asked her to speak to a manager and apparently there was also 'nothing he could do.' I feel like this restaurant effectively stole money from me by charging me for a product I didn't receive.

2011-12-13,1.0,"My boyfriend and I were looking for a quick (less than 1 hour) place to grab dinner before heading back to work. I had tried the lunch special at Bistro Pacific at some point in the past and it didn't stand out in my memory; I assumed that my previous experience had been neither particularly good nor bad. But on my return visit for dinner, I was absolutely blown away by how terrible this restaurant is.  It took 20 minutes for our waitress to take our order, and this was only after flagging her down to the table. My boyfriend ordered the salmon teriyaki bento and I ordered the tofu basil fried rice and 2 pieces each of salmon and super white tuna nigiri. The nigiri came out first and was blameless but totally unremarkable. It took another 30 minutes for our entrees to arrive, and I almost wish we had left after the nigiri.  I don't often think ""I could have made this"" while eating at a restaurant, but at Bistro Pacific, I thought, ""I could have made this much better."" Note: I am no chef by any stretch of the imagination. The basil fried rice contained no basil. The rice was dry and flavorless; the green pepper and onions looked as if they'd been cut by a 4 year old in the kitchen, a unintentional mix of julienned, chopped, shredded, and otherwise mutilated vegetables.  The salmon bento box was just as pitiful: the piece of teriyaki salmon was easily the smallest piece of salmon I've ever seen served at a restaurant - maybe half the size of a hockey puck. After eating the salmon puck drenched in a straight-out-of-the-bottle teriyaki sauce, my boyfriend dug hopelessly through the salmon's cabbage bedding in search of more fish. No luck.  For our entertainment during the meal, a waitress serving a different section of the restaurant was miserably stomping around and complaining to her manager that one of her tables had sent food back to the kitchen because it was cold. She huffed and puffed and clodded her way throughout the restaurant, making sure that every patron knew just how miserable she was.  Throughout the meal, I almost felt like I was in on a big joke. This was easily the worst meal I've ever had. The food was awful, the service inattentive, and we had the pleasure of spending $50 for the experience. As we walked out, my boyfriend said, ""We should have just eaten at Volare instead."" Indeed.",-0.8168,0.816,0.086,0.098,0.5377217553688142
2011-09-13,1.0,"Ew, ew, ew, ew. I truly cannot understand the high ratings of this place. I'm thinking most of the people giving Bistro Pacific good reviews do not know what REAL Asian food should taste like. And yes, for the record, I am Asian and I can't even begin to count the number of Asian restaurants I've been to in the Chicagoland area alone, much less in my lifetime. I've been here before for the sushi lunch special and I remember the sushi was disgusting. The fish was not fresh, quite flavorless, and looked like the saddest pieces of fish I had ever seen. Been here for the maki rolls prior to that, and was not impressed either. After the sushi incident, I swore this place off, vowing never to return. However, my friend wanted hot and sour soup today so against my better judgement I agreed to go here with her. I figured, ok I'll avoid the raw fish and try something cooked instead.  I ordered the teriyaki beef and my friend had the chicken basil fried rice. The teriyaki beef did not taste like teriyaki at all and it had a weird aftertaste to it. I seriously have a cast iron stomach (Week old leftovers? Not a problem, bring 'em on!) but midway through the meal I felt kind of nauseous. Good thing for the tea and fortune cookie, those managed to calm my stomach down. My friend tried the beef as well, and thought it tasted strange. As for her fried rice, it was flavorless and had absolutely no basil taste. My friend and I agreed that the best thing we had all meal was the fortune cookie. Since I can't give zero stars, they get one star for being close to my work. That's about all that they have going for them. Oh, that and they buy the good brand of fortune cookies (Golden Dragon).

2011-07-22,4.0,"I recently had lunch here with a couple of coworkers and was pleasantly surprised. A block down from work, how had I not dined here before? Atmosphere: Very bright, clean and contemporary atmosphere. Don't miss the fish tank as you enter/exit! Nice bar and there is even a back room with additional seating (even though there is plenty of seating in the main room).  As for the crowd, I'd have to agree with the follow Yelper who describes this place as the ""unofficial"" faculty lunch room for the Northwestern University Chicago campus... lots of people wearing Wildcat IDs here! Fine by me. Eats: With lunch, you get a bowl of soup included & I ordered the hot & sour soup and it hit the spot - it had pork, tofu, water chestnuts, bamboo shoots, mushroom and egg. Delicious. For the entrée I went with my standard favorite - chicken fried rice and it too was fantastic.  It had onions, bean sprouts, carrots pea pods and just the right amount of egg. The chicken was plentiful and it was not salty and had excellent flavor. Be sure to ask for a size of chili sauce to kick it up a notch. If you are indecisive about what to order, you'll love the bento options. You can choose from chicken teriyaki, beef teriyaki, salmon teriyaki, sushi or sashimi. With that you get a cucumber salad, California roll, miso soup and 2 shrimp & vegetables tempura.  Summary: Overall, expansive menu of Asian cuisine in a very pleasant atmosphere with very friendly service. Prices are also very affordable; great place to go for lunch/dinner if you're in the Streeterville area.

The real reason I do like this place is because it's close to work. I can't honestly say I would travel down from far up north in Lincoln Park, but it's great for lunch.

With so many customers, I would hope they'd hire appropriate staff, but the dining experience never moves quickly. Despite that, I continue to occasionally frequent the restaurant. Why? Convenience.

Like another reviewer mentioned, if your order is under $10, you can't use a credit card. There's an ATM at the Treasure Island. You will always get seated quickly here. The service can be slooooow at times.

Update 6/10/2010:  I have eaten at Pacific Bistro many more times since my original review. And I need to up the rating.

2009-12-28,4.0,The sushi here is not only tasty it is also affordable. The caterpillar and the Arizona are my personal favorite. The pad thai is also very delicious.  The decor is nice and we actually got some ideas for our place. I would recommend this to anyone looking for a good moderately priced eatery.,0.9348,0.752,0.248,0.0,0.7125
2009-10-28,4.0,"It's pan-Asian-American fare that's affordable and decently tasty. Your money is probably best spent on their sushi. Many a night, I speed-dialed Bistro Pacific to order some combination of Rainbow, Chicago Crazy, Arizona, Sunrise, Miami or Salmon Avocado rolls. Mmm, deliciousness. Yes, there are places that serve bigger and fresher, but they are usually more expensive too.",0.5647,0.864,0.108,0.029,0.5208333333333334
2009-09-18,2.0,"The sushi is only alright; I don't know why people rave about it.  That being said, it's significantly better than the sushi I saw in Treasure Island last night.  TI, why bother? I also tried the orange chicken lunch special one day.  It was a soggy mess.  I suggest that the owners travel up to Empire Restaurant up on Division near Clark ( yelp.com/biz/empire-rest… ).  Those folks know how to make crispy orange chicken.

2009-07-02,4.0,"Bistro Pacific is a pan-asian restaurant tucked away in the Playboy building. You could easily walk by it without noticing it is there. You have to first enter the building to get into the restaurant. I have been twice so far. The first time I was not super impressed, I ordered yaki soba, I think..and it was just ok. The chicken egg roll was decent though, much better than other Chinese places I have been to in the area. The second time I went, I ordered the sweet and sour chicken. It was really good. I especially enjoy that they have yellow sweet and sour sauce, I can't stand the red kind; not sure why. If you want a place around this area, with no wait at dinner time, this is your spot. I can only hope they are doing a lot of takeout business because at 7 p.m. on a Saturday there was only one other table occupied in the restaurant. I am worried about them!",0.9458,0.771,0.161,0.068,0.5693415637860083
2009-04-24,5.0,"Never thought that sushi in the Midwest could be so good!  I'm admittedly not the biggest sushi person, but I actually enjoyed the rolls here. The Dynamite and Caterpillar were my personal faves. So flavorful and fresh! I didn't try the other items, but there was a very large selection of food, and I'd be interested in trying the Korean soup next time.  The ambience was tranquil, and it was relaxing to step into this restaurant and step out of the busy city for a couple of moments to enjoy some good food.   It's a family owned restaurant and the wait staff made us feel welcome and comfortable.  It almost felt like being home with my own Korean parents.  If you're in Chicago, definitely come check this place out!",0.9934,0.705,0.295,0.0,0.542142857142857
2009-04-15,5.0,"I was really happy when I discovered this place because I've been looking for a good sushi place ever since I moved to Chicago. Having been raised in California for 20 years where we actually have fresh fish, it did not even cross my mind when I came here that there was no such thing as fresh fish out here.  So with that, let me tell you native Chicagoans, you're missing out no matter what --- but on that note, I've had some of the best sushi at this place and I've been all over Chicago searching...The rolls are delicious, well plated; and there is a great selection.  Moreover, they are not over-priced at all, like most other places.   I bring my friends and classmates here all the time for both lunch and dinner all the time, and they are always suprised that they've never been before (the restaurant in within the Playboy building so not exactly a place in street view that you would regularly walk by.) My friends have especially enjoyed the lunch specials, which come with soup and sometimes ice cream mochi for dessert. The place also has nice decor and a good ambience that is ideal for pretty much everything ranging from a casual business lunch to a dinner date to a family gathering.  I was also very pleased with the service. The waiters were all very friendly, attentive, patient, and quick. They seemed happy and checked in on us periodically. The manager of the restaurant also goes around checking in on the customers, which is always fun and great.",0.9981,0.709,0.276,0.015,0.5920203359858532
2009-03-30,1.0,"I tried to avoid reviewing Bistro Pacific, because I eat there out of convenience and necessity.  I don't think it's fair to give bad ratings to places I already know are not good.  However, my experience there tonight showed me that Bistro Pacific is a place to avoid. A friend wanted to grab a quick dinner there because of time constraints, so I went along.  He ordered ""seafood udon"" (soup) and the lady who I think is the manager or owner brought out the yaki udon with seafood (stir fried udon).  He told her he wanted the soup, and she claimed he ordered the yaki udon.  I was there during the ordering--he didn't say ""yaki"".  She tried to convince him to eat it first and said that it was good and he'd like it, so he tried it but didn't like it.  He told her so.  Then, instead of ordering the udon soup, she tried to get him to pay for the yaki udon.  When he said he wasn't going to and that he wanted the udon soup, she said he should pay at least half, or else she wouldn't get the soup. He ended up asking for the check.  She grabbed the first $20 bill he took out (less than the entire amount) and then walked away from us, clearly telling us to leave right away.  Her rude behavior was quite shocking. I know it's a bad economy, but having a customer pay for your mistakes is something I've never seen a restaurant do.  Bistro Pacific is neither high-quality nor cheap, so they should make it up with service.  This was very likely the most disappointing dining experience I've had.",-0.9683,0.834,0.041,0.125,0.5638690476190475
2009-03-20,4.0,"Convenient because it is located in the building where I used to work.  Call in orders usually took no more than 10 minutes to process. Selection is decent, especially at lunch.  There are items that are more affordable than others, and if you do takeout - it's definitely not too big of a burden on the wallet.   The lunch specials include a bowl of soup as well. Service during dine in is consistent.  It's not the fastest, but it's definitely not the slowest either.   Sushi seems to be a bit pricey for the portion sizes.  Keep in mind that anything under 10 dollars cannot be charged.",0.6472,0.885,0.082,0.033,0.4740740740740741

2007-08-29,3.0,"It may be because I was spoiled in California, Bistro Pacific's food quality is passable.  I had green salad, dragon rainbow roll, and white chocolate fried wonton dessert. The salad was ok, not terribly fresh, but not old either.  The ginger dressing is not really seasoned enough.  The crispy noodles are a lit soft and saggy.   The sushi was reasonably priced, and probably reasonably quality by Chicago standards.  But to take a bit more critical approach: the rice was not sufficiently treated by vinegar, tastes just simply plain rice directly from the ricecooker.  The fish slices were a bit thin, and ok fresh.  The execution was ok, tend to be a little bit loose than good sushi, and of course the proportion between rice/fish is a bit off, but that may be too much to ask for. The dessert was not impressive.  It ended up the dessert did not have white chocolate in it as advertised in the menu, and the ice cream was indeed quite icy.   The service was great, can't ask for more.  The wait staff was very friendly and patient.  The ambience was modern, but certainly not ""upscale"" as some of the previous posts say.  It is probably a good spot for hangout, but is not a good choice if you want to impress your friend for your sophistication for food.    I was not impressed by it, but again, I may have too high an expectation.",0.9819,0.775,0.163,0.062,0.47298482469911035
