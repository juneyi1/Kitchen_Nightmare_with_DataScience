2017-08-20,4.0,"Friendly waiters, cozy and fun atmosphere, and a quick wait for lots of yummy food.  Great for sharing with big groups; I came with my family and saw a lot of other families here too.  None of the dishes blew me away, but I was a big fan of the spicy eggplant, sautéed peapods, orange chicken (a fave) and moo shu pork.  The potstickers and fried pork buns were also yummy, although the taste of fried dough was a little intense compared to the meat filling.  The dishes that we tried labeled ""spicy"" (like the eggplant) were actually pretty mild: could be a positive or negative depending on your preference.  I would NOT recommend the chive pancake: it tasted like oil and little else.  Also, there was a hair in our potstickers: could be totally random and uncommon here, but seems worth mentioning.   PS: Lots of free cookies with the check! :)",0.9893,0.716,0.256,0.028,0.5747835497835498
2017-08-18,5.0,"Moon Palace is my favorite restaurant in Chinatown! Now, I'm biased as an old friend's family owns the place but keeping it real, it's as good as it gets in Chinatown. Clearly they're doing it right because they've been open over 30 years.  I've been coming to Moon Palace for 15 years myself (ffffff im old) since I was in highschool. Back in the day, I went to UIC which is nearby and as a college kid, I was in here a couple times a week. Legit.  As a youngin' I got sweet and sour chicken every single time I went in. I was young and dumb and didn't venture into more exciting foods. But man, their sweet and sour chicken is the stuff dreams are made of. They are known for being the first place in Chicago to have the now hot-ticket item XLB (Xiao Long Bao). And in my world, they still do it best. Other recommendations, Salt & Pepper Fish, Stir Fried Rice Cake & Shanghai Stir Fried Noodles, Hot & Sour Soups....and don't sleep on their drinks! They do them pretty darn well. Pro-Tip: They are open every friggin day which is just insane.  Service is always on point, their food has held up to the test of time, plus they went through a major renovation and fixed everything up all fancy-like. If you're looking for a slightly nicer Chinatown dining experience with delicious food, Moon Palace will surely fit the bill.",0.9936,0.769,0.196,0.034,0.5047979797979797

2016-11-05,3.0,"The hunt for soup dumplings is still going strong. Being from New York I really didn't appreciate soup dumplings as much as I should have and coming out to Chicago I miss it so much. I researched a bunch of places in Chicago that supposedly have the best soup dumplings and Moon Palace came pretty on top. They also had peking duck for a great price which intrigued me even more! I rarely if not never see them on the menu of a shanghai restaurant. I made a reservation on opentable super easily a few days before and had high expectations! The place is very close to the train station about 2 or 3 blocks so it's very convenient to go to and you don't need to uber it which I find I have to do a lot being in Chicago. I came on a Thursday night and it was fairly empty, there were about 4 tables already taken. The waitstaff were super nice! We ended up ordering soup dumplings, peking duck, and string beans. I was happy that the dish came with rice as well. The soup dumplings came and I was so happy. They looked the part because at other placed they were about half the size but Moon Palace got it. When we attempted to eat the soup dumpling though there wasn't the beautiful flavors that my boyfriend and I are so use to when we eat at place like Joe Shanghai or go to flushing or chinatown in New York. The meat was also lack luster as well. Really disappointed about this because if the soup dumplings were on point I would be here every weekend! The peking duck came and that was the best part of the meal. I loved the wrappers it came with. I noticed in more americanized placed they use this thicker dough to put the peking duck in and I hate it but this place uses the wrappers that are normally given at a shanghai restaurant. They also gave us a good amount of meat. The peking duck could have easily been split between a group of 3 or 4 people! We also loved the string beans. Although, it was noted to be spicy it wasn't overly spicy at all! So don't be scared about that.  Even though we are still on the hunt for a place that makes a solid soup dumpling we will probably return for the delicious peking duck and vegetables. The prices are also pretty good and the decor makes it look much fancier than other restaurants in the area. They also have a full bar if you wanted to have some beers, wines, or a hard drink!",0.9938,0.778,0.158,0.064,0.5787481962481963

Am I not speaking Chinese well enough for you to converse with me in it? Do I look funny?  Anyway, the food itself was pretty good. The dumplings I have to say were probably the best part of the meal. We got potstickers and the steamed variety and the filling inside was just plain tasty. The skin was thick, which I usually do not like, but this time it gave it a good texture and chew. The potstickers were better than the steamed, but then of course they're fried, oil makes everything better. And they followed that line of reasoning to the end. We also ordered the sauteed peasprouts, the chicken nest, and the shredded pork with onion. Everything was greasy to the nines - way greasier than I'm used to. Thankfully we had some tea to cut through the fat, but it was pretty greasy overall. The pea sprouts were ""old"" and was not the tender variety, which just means that it requires more chewing and is kind of more like chewing on grass. But the flavor was good. The pork with onion was very tasty, authentic, but it was SUPER oily. And the chicken nest had some great flavor; although it was greasy it tasted slightly healthier than the pork since it was just a leaner type of meat.

Moon Palace does NOT at ALL live up to the 2 Star Rating Chicago Magazine gave it.  If you're curious about checking it out because of that, and expecting that level or excellence, you may wish to save your self a trip that perhaps shall disappoint you. I did not see many Chinese people in there, and I guess there may be a reason for that. The service is not refined per se, but it is very friendly, shows great effort, and is just very diligent and timely.  Drinks are always refilled quickly and dirty empty plates disappear like lightening.  Most dishes were nice and soups and appetizers were at a reasonable price point.  Dinners were definitely higher priced than most Chinatown restaurants. They just were not better. The clams in black bean sauce tasted very far from fresh, and they were a huge disappointment.  The clams were also overloaded with what appeared to be too much ground pork in the sauce.   The Hunan fish recipe was delicious but even under the mask of what was a nice recipe, the fish quality did not seem good enough, and I occasionally detected an older fishy taste when eating the dish... maybe there was also quite a bit of MSG / Sodium to hide the not so fresh fish taste I detected at times? You also need to watch out for the Pot Stickers.  They were served a little too soft and thick, with too much grease, oil, or fat oozing out to the plate, and that is not what I hoped for.  If that is what I wanted, I would order xiao long bao or soup dumplings.  Also, the meat in the pot stickers were not prepared carefully enough, as I tasted hard strange objects while I chewed them (that scares me about the meat quality inside).  That was really gross... If I lived close, I would perhaps go and try some other lunch specials, but it is hard to justify a special trip to the area just for that restaurant.    On the weekend, lunch for 2 can quickly set you back for $60 with tip, without any drinks.  It was Ok in some ways, but simply not that good to justify the trip.",0.9884,0.762,0.153,0.085,0.5283679653679655

If you are expecting a traditional Chinese restaurant, you won't find it here. What you will find is a modern Chinese restaurant with traditional Chinese cuisine. One of my favorites is their fried rice. Yes, fried rice. I don't know how they do it but it's always delicious. Never dry, never bland, just always delicious. Some other dishes I've tried from there include Beef LoMein, General Tso's Chicken, Chicken(also Beef) w/Brocolli, Empress Chicken, and few more. Of course I've also tried there egg rolls and dumplings. I have tried other restaurants in Chicago's Chinatown but this one has never let me down. If you park in the Chinatown parking lot at Cermak and Wentworth, and eat at Moon Palace, you can get your parking ticket validated and pay only $2.00!

2012-07-06,4.0,"I am very particular about Chinese food--I don't know why, but most (even ""authentic"") Chinese food gives me horrible stomach cramps (even those that claim not to have MSG). I think that this is because many dishes often contain pork fat. Moon Palace ""gets"" that vegetarian means no meat fat, no little pork pieces (a problem I've had at another well-rated Chinatown place), etc. I used to live in LA and San Francisco and found that many ""authentic"" Chinese restaurants list dishes that contain meat products in the ""vegetarian"" portion of the menu. Pet peeve, or rather, deal-breaker, for this vegetarian of 25 years. So, they do a Szechuan eggplant that doesn't contain pork and is awesome. It's oily, but that is part of the appeal. We always get this and the green beans. My husband loves the tomato ginger shrimp. The Chinese buns are a tad dry, but very good (filled with greens and mushroom) and the chive pancakes rock. We also like that this place has a nicer ambiance than many Chinatown restaurants, so it can be a date night place. The wait staff is attentive.

After reading the reviews and hearing the rumors of a chef from Din Tai Fung, I set out to see if all the buzz was true.  Upon walking in, I received a warm greeting from the wait staff and immediately noticed the well furnished décor. Oddly, the place was empty. Not a good sign when most places are packed around this time on Saturdays in Chinatown.  We ordered xiao long bao, xiao long bao with crab and pork, and shanghai fried noodles. The xiao long bao was a large pork meatball with very little soup inside. The other used imitation crab and was surrounded by more pork filling around the same size. Pretty good as a steamed dumpling on its own but a far cry from xiao long bao. After eating soup dumplings in California and New York, this was very disappointing.   To set the record straight, a chef from Din Tai Fung does not work here and this is not the best place in Chicago for xiao long bao.

I have eaten a lot of XLB in Asia and the States, and these definitely have the right flavor.  They are not the dainty, one bite perfection you will find elsewhere, but this is the Midwest, bigger is better. Also, one order of six dumplings is sufficient for a meal.  I never remember this and always order another dish, with the end result that I take home 75% of said other dish.  I am not a light eater by any stretch of the imagination.

Either we really do have superior Chinese food in Houston, or it was just an off day for Moon Palace? I don't know, but we were not impressed.

Normally would check Yelp prior to ordering somewhere we've never been before, but we didn't have our phones on us so went with our gut. Apparently, our gut was wrong!  Wonton soup was super bland, practically tasteless and the broth itself was greasy and needed salt. Seriously, who ever needs to add salt to chinese food?!  Potstickers were very good but didn't have a sauce accompanying them, which I found unusual. Crab rangoons were about as tasteless as the soup, and the sweet and sour sauce was too thin for our liking.  Having our two young kids with meant we had to order something 'safe' ie something we knew they'd eat, namely fried chicken of some sort, so we went with orange chicken (not spicy). Maybe it sucked because it's typically spicy, but it was also very bland, not orangey at all, and only our 3 yr old liked it (he being the king of chicken nuggets, not surprised he liked it). The beef lo mein we ordered was decent, but nothing to write home about, and it apparently had the extra salt/soy that our wontons and soup lacked.

Maybe we were there on a bad day, or a bad time, or just ordered the wrong things? Who knows. The waitress also forgot a few things we ordered and in general wasn't very friendly.

2011-03-23,1.0,"They are Liars. I'm currently planning my wedding and so far I've been fairly laid back about everything.  I try my best to have a go with the flow attitude.   I thought that our family and friends would enjoy a chinatown rehearsal dinner, so I called around seeing who could accommodate 70 people and not require a per head minimum.  Not many places did, but when I called Moon Palace, a woman answered and said Yes! we can definitely do that, no worries.  I just had to call a couple weeks before hand to confirm the menu.   Ok yes, my bad for not getting a contract, so two weeks beforehand, I called and spoke to the owner Jones to reconfirm.  He said he didn't see me in the system, but they definitely could still accommodate.  AWESOME.  I reconfirmed and asked again, so I don't have to do a 10 course meal with a per head charge and he said no, you can order off the menu for each table.  Great!  I let him know that I'd be coming in a couple days to have dinner, review the menu and confirm what we'd be ordering so they could prepare for us.   My BM and I go to dinner, order our dinner and we start eating - the food is great!  Jones comes out and shakes my hand and we start talking.... All of a sudden, he had said that he was confused, that it would now be $60 per person because he'll have to shut down the restaurant for this event.  WHAT? (I said that to him) I then let him know that I could definitely not afford that, so he said well what about $40.  He then told me that he had gotten confused and thought my phone call was a big catering order, because people ask for catering all the time.  I said NO - that is incorrect, how could you think it was catering, when we were discussing seating 70 people and if it fits in your restaurant.... I told him that if we couldn't go with the original plan of ordering off the menu, that I would not host my event there.  He then told me that if it was 50 people or less he'd do off the menu because if it was only 30, he could fit it in (yes you read that right, he first said 50, then said 30).  I said, so 50 or 30, he replied 30.  I again said, no that won't work, I will not be having my dinner here.  After a little while, he came by to say - ok here's the ""deal"" if you do your dinner 9pm or after, we can do it.  I AGAIN said, no I will not have my dinner here, because it is not what we discussed.  He went on to continue about how he'd have to pay an additional shift of employees, just to service my group.  After our interaction with him - we couldn't even eat, although we were starving... we were so furious. What did he miss out on?  Definite business and loyal customers - my family and friends will frequent a place if it really has impressed us.  The food is good and the place is pretty cute, but I REFUSE to patronize a business that goes back on their word and doesn't do what it takes to impress a customer.   I've told all 70 people that Moon Palace backed on my rehearsal dinner.  Talk about bad customer service.",0.9949,0.774,0.151,0.074,0.5589807852965748

2010-03-14,5.0,"Moon Palace is one of the few places I have been consistently going to, and enjoying over the past 23 years, btw I am 30, Moon Palace has never declined in the quality and tastiness of the food. Whoever I have ever brought to this place, whether from chi or out of town, always wants to come back and there is one major reason behind this: The steamed dumplings. When I walk inside Moon Palace, the waitresses see me and order 2 orders of steamed dumplings for me before i can say hello. They know how much I love it, and so does everyone else that knows me lol. Anyhow the dumplings are a must, they give you 10 per order they come in a tin tray served over cabbage, and the dumpling is always perfect, pork is basically what comes in the dumpling but you can also get it with shrimp, and the sauce that is in that dumpling is pure crack, and chances are that you WILL be hooked once you eat one, unless your a vegetarian. I have searched at countless other chinese, szechwan, and mandarin restaurants, in cities across the U.S. including NY and S.F., none have compared or even come close, and i find myself always disappointed when i bother trying to find a replacement. Sizzling rice soup, made at the table, also very good, but can be very filling so beware So you've already ate the dumplings and/or soup, now on to the main course, I have always loved the shrimp chow fun, which is wide rice noodles on top of sauteed shrimp with water chestnuts and broccoli, the sauce they use is incredibly tasty, and compliments the dish so damn well, its plain and simple awesome, and very filling.  The orange beef, while a bit spicy is also very good, again  the sauce is just awesome, makes everything ive had at moon palace taste great. Cashew chicken, while it sounds regular dish type, is also one of the best I have found, tons of chicken, huge portion, water chestnuts and cashews, oh and again huge portions, throughout. Also i don't particularily like kung pao chicken but many have told me it is the best they've had Mongolian beef, is another dish you cant go wrong with, though also a cliche dish, the texture of the beef is very soft and tender, and the sauce is sweet and extremely tasty Expect to leave very full always, with a party of 2 generally spending under $35-40, if you over order you will probably feel like you over ordered and will be taking things home, but I will be willing to bet you wont be disappointed. They have a full bar, Tsing Tao being my favorite beer to drink there, they also have very tasty mixed drinks including pina colada's, mai tai's and other strong drinks as well.  Expect to spend about an hour or less there, they are quick but not too quick, and usually moderately busy. Very friendly Chinese family owned sit-down restaurant.

What the heck, Moon Palace, when did you start adding MSG to your food? It has to have been recently, because the last four or five times I have eaten at your fine establishment I have gotten many of the MSG side effects, mainly tight face muscles (my jaw still hurts today!), stiffness in the shoulders, and weakness.  I didn't want to admit it, but while eating there yesterday all three people at the table felt the same way.

There was none of the idly waiting for food to appear period.     This restaurant is a Shanghainese joint, so don't expect the typical greasy fried dumplings and soy sauce drenched fried rice.... It's way cleaner and much easier on the stomach.   FOOD.... Be sure to order some hot & sour soup to kick start your meal, it has a nice zing and a substantial amount of pork and tofu - very good.  do NOT miss out on the home-made dumplings and eggrolls with their home-made sweet & sour sauce.  This is no fancy Panda Express...the Orange Chicken at Moon Palace will seriously amaze you (I would recommend this more than their Sesame Chicken). Their Peking Duck is to die for, I'm drooling just writing about it.  I would highly advocate ordering the AA Choy veggies (I think that was the name); they're very fresh and just perfectly cooked, definitely a good complement to their meat dishes.  Overall, the food and service was just impeccable.   I'm not much of a drinker, but the restaurant has a stacked bar... my friends seemed to really enjoy their Tsing Taos and Mai Tais.",0.9842,0.843,0.125,0.032,0.5735885885885884

You should know that Moon Palace is not the place to order your Cantonese usuals.  This is a place to go for Shanghainese food.  If you're not familiar with the difference, I suggest you take a look at their website before you go.  You also might want to talk to the host or hostess or ask for the owner and talk things over before ordering.  They can be a good guide for non-Chinese customers and can make sure that you get the right level of spiciness.  I won't recommend any particular dishes here; you know what you like and don't like, so talk it over with the host and place your order with confidence.  I don't think you'll be disappointed.     I understand that the place had a bad fire last year (they are right next door to a fire station, so that was convenient!), and they have done a wonderful job of remodeling.  In fact, theirs is one of the nicest places in Chinatown now.  The spent some big bucks, and it shows.

The first time there was a hair in one of the dishes we ordered.They brought us new plates, but left the original dishes on the table. Needless to say, if our food had been cooked with hair in it, we weren't about to continue eating. They didn't charge us for the appetizers we had- that was their way of fixing it.  Since my boyfriend still says he loves this place, we gave it another chance. When we got there, it was busy and there was a wait. The hostess was rude and didn't both to take anyone's names down. She then proceeded to call others to sit down before us- even though we had gotten there first. We then noticed that once we were seated, everyone around us was being served before us. After almost an hour, we finally received our appetizers (potstickers) while others around us had received their appetizers and entrees and were almost done eating.  To sum it up: Don't come here, if you expect good service.",0.8463,0.893,0.076,0.031,0.5588564213564213
2009-07-24,4.0,"This is my FAVORITE place to eat in Chinatown.  In the beginning of 2009 they caught fire (funny this is the fire department is literally right next door) and they were closed for several months to redecorate.  I would have given this place 5 stars before this all happened however after going back to them more than several times after they reopened I have to admit that the food went a little downhill. For appetizers I recommend the green onion pancakes and the Shanghai steam dumplings.  They are the best in Chinatown. A tip to eat the steam dumplings is to not puncture it before you put it in your mouth...that way the first bite you get all the juices.  Be careful though make sure you let it cool down before you do this or you will burn yourself. Main course recommendation would be the Shanghai fried noodles, they are delicious.  A perfect blend of noodles, chinese cabbage, and shredded pork.  It's not for the health conscious though as it tends to be super greasy. If you feel like noodle soup order the five spices beef noodle.  Another one of my favs, not too greasy and full of flavor.  I've been coming here since I was a little kid and have been on my top 5 places to eat since then.",0.9791,0.825,0.144,0.031,0.4787240537240537

I finally went after their much expected reopening after renovation. The restaurant looks classy and expensive. Dark wood and fancy tiles everywhere. We order sweet and sour soup, noodles, and, for the first time, peking duck.  I asked the waitress several times BEFORE i order the duck to make sure that it is made the day of and wrapped in steamed buns. She assured me of both and placed our order. the soup was SUPER sour. The noodles were SUPER salty, and the duck was super dry and OLD. It was hands down the WORST peking duck, or any duck, that I have ever had. it was dry and jerky, without an ounce of fat anywhere, AND it came with chinese tortilla wraps that were obviously frozen then microwaved. I was in shock and I asked the waitress why the duck was so dry and if it was really made that day. She said that ALL AMERICAN ducks are dry, and if i had juicy peking duck, it must have been in China. I replied that I had excellent duck in Phoenix, and she didn't have anything to say. Then I overheard her talking to the owner, who said loudly that ""of course the duck is dry, because the meat sucked up all the fat."" The fact was, the duck was days old and kept in the fridge, then microwaved quickly before served. No complimentary dessert, no waive charges for horrible duck. As a duck lover, this is the worst duck and worst attitude/lies I encountered at any restaurant. I will never return to the restaurant for anything.

2006-04-04,4.0,"One of my favorite reasons to eat out is to have something I can't cook myself.  OK, maybe, I could have made the shrimp and pork buns (but it would have made me grumpy, whereas the waitress was friendly.)  But the fantastic Jelly Fish with Turnips - I wouldn't have known where to get the ingredients, and it was so crunchy and delicious with just the right amount of sesame.  And I don't begin to know what was in the Shanghai Style Eel Fish, but it was delicious.  Chinatown is not far away.  I keep forgetting that.  It's right down the Red Line from Lakeview and Lincoln Park, and with a car, it's a breeze.  And there's parking.  Actual free parking!",0.9456,0.851,0.135,0.014,0.6277167277167277
2005-11-26,4.0,Best place in chinatown to get Shanghainese food. The restaurant interior is quite modern and classy compared to many places in the neighborhood. There was a variety of customers...from older Caucasians to Chinese people of all backgrounds...mandarin speaking to cantonese.  The siu long bao and shanghai noodles are really good. We tried the shanghai chicken. The pieces  (bone -in)were quite small but fhe flavor was good.,0.877,0.846,0.154,0.0,0.4803030303030303
