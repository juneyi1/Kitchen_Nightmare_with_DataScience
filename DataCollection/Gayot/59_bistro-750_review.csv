2017-07-09,2.0,"Given the amazing selection of brunch places in Chicago, Bistro 750 is a one and done for me. Unlike some of the other reviews, we found the service to be friendly and attentive.... but that's kind of where it stopped. I'm not sure the menu knows what it wants to be, offering a limited selection of dishes ranging from diner food to Tex Mex. And the food is just not good. We both ordered vege-heavy dishes, assuming they'd be on the lighter side, and they both came out a greasy mess. Do potatoes even count as a ""seasonal vegetable"" in the summer? The Bloody Mary's were fine, but nothing to write home about... which just about sums up our experience here.",-0.8922,0.818,0.051,0.131,0.573478835978836

2017-06-23,3.0,"Listen, I owe allegiance to Taverna 750's brunch, but I tried to give this place a fair shot, and it just didn't impress. Yes, it is haunted by the most incredible brunch to have ever graced Chicago. But that should urge Bistro 750 to be all the more magnificent or at least preserve what made Taverna's brunch so legendary! Food: At Taverna, I had trouble choosing what to order because everything looked so incredible. This time, I had trouble choosing what to order because the menu was kinda small and nothing looked particularly great, and the rest of my brunchmates' meals didn't look super exciting when they came out either! Where's the spicy crab dip? The nutella pull-apart bread? The pesto bruschetta? To be fair, whatever they do to their potatoes is spot-on, and the churros were a pleasant starter (though the coffee taste in the chocolate-hazelnut dip was a bit annoying).  Drink: Once again, I miss Taverna's extensive, creative, delicious cocktail list. I appreciated Bistro's ability to switch out your bottomless mimosas and bloody mary's at will. If you're just trying to get drunk over a modicum of breakfast food, then yes, this is the place for you!  Service: The snarky service of Taverna was fabulous. But they were snarky when they were on top of their shit and it was you that was the problem. You want extra ketchup? Queen, you start with what you got right in front of you. Can't decide on what you want? Hunny if you ask me my recommendations you best take one of them. --- But --- It's been 10m since you sat down and you don't have water or mimosa? The correct response is: Oh shit, I'll be right back. Not ""Hold your horses."" You gotta choose the right time to be snarky! All in all, it wasn't unpleasant, but definitely could have been better. It's not a brunch I'm psyched about.",0.8551,0.702,0.16,0.138,0.6368296868296869
2017-06-19,1.0,"Based on the other reviews, maybe we just experienced a very bad day at Bistro 750.  We had a party of 10 and pretty much all of us disliked the food at brunch. We're not a picky bunch and usually go with the flow.  I had the Nutella waffles for which the Nutella was non-existant. It was probably masked by the massive amount of maple syrup they poured on the plate. It drowned everything. My friend ordered the same as me and had the same reaction.  The other reactions from the table for various brunch items were bland or greasy or ""just okay.""  They also gave us a free appetizer with brunch which was a cinnamon churro with an extremely runny chocolate dipping sauce.  Should have been a dessert, not a pre-meal app.  However, the absolute worst part for us was our server Chase D. who had the worst attitude ever as a waiter.  When the group arrived, our table was at an angle.  Chase announced the arrangement wasn't working for him and had everyone stand so he could rearrange the tables.   I asked about the Blueberry Lemonade on the menu.  He replied, ""What do you want to know?""  I said, ""Well have you had it and is it good?""  His reply, ""Yes and yes.""  Nothing else.  He seemed to be absolutely put out to be working that day.  And it showed!  He did offer to split the checks at the table and then messed up almost all of them. We just let it go.  But after he ran the credit cards, he came back to the table, dropped off the cards and receipts and turned and walked off.  No ""thank you for coming.""  No ""Have a nice day.""  Nothing. The consensus for us at the table was ""one and done.""  I won't be going back.",-0.3909,0.84,0.083,0.078,0.598

2017-06-14,4.0,"I am rooting for this place HARD. I have yet to come across such an amazing place when it comes to dining in Lakeview yet! Their food is par to a lot of places in West Loop and is amazingly priced for the quality and portions. I recommend the shishito peppers, scallops and Lardo  (the sausage needs for the fat to be emulsified a bit more, a tad too dry) so excited to come back and try the agnolotti and steak. Our server was super friendly and very informative and helped us make great choices. However, I do agree they need to have a dress code. The only point I deduct is for the atmosphere. I think this place is a little confused. Set up is decent, beautiful tables but awkward looking chairs and table set ups. Nice paintings but still lacking in that unique flair. The food definitely elevates this place to seem like a fine dining restaurant however the music throws this place OFFFFFF. A little too loud and clearly trying to fit in to the Boystown area a little too hard. They need to change their concept and showcase their food more as opposed to trying to gain popularity through their ""partyness"". Really really hoping this place lasts after the bad luck this building has had. I wanted to cry in tears of joy while eating their food and I'm huge foodie. I only try to eat at places featured on eater or Michelin but hoping this place steps up and becomes a staple in the food industry.

The delicious Watermelon Mezcal Cooler for me and the Trinidad Sour for my date, both cocktails are perfect summer refreshers. I also tried a raspberry take on a Tom Collins that was to die for.  The food is served tapas style, which I enjoy so I can try lots of different dishes and the restaurant encourages sharing. We started out with the roasted beet salad and the heirloom tomato salad. Both were amazing and light and almost looked too beautiful to eat! Almost. For the main course we shared the Alabama dipped chicken meatballs, a new addition to the menu that brings a southern style flavor to a classic dish, and the house orecchiette with braised beef, a sizable dish perfect for sharing. Both dishes were exquisite, my personal favorites were the chicken meatballs and the beet salad though I was definitely eyeing the scallops.

We started out with cocktails which were delicious and again, the cocktail menu was out of the ordinary (I will have to go back and try more cocktails!). Food wise, since we were six, we ordered about 9 dishes for us to split, since the restaurant is new, the chef was so excited he even sent out two more for us to try!  Everything was delicious but our favorites were the agnolotti, the sunchokes, the polenta chips, the zampone and the white fish. We were STUFFED, but we had to have dessert...

2017-05-08,5.0,"Bistro 750 is a brand new restaurant in Lakeview that is serving up some delicious dishes. The food is brought out tapas style,  but don't be fooled because the servings are generous and you won't be leaving here hungry. The menu offers up Italian food with a French flare and is most definitely insta worthy with every dish being served like a piece of art.  We went to try this place, and man I sure am glad we went. First round of drinks consisted of blueberry lemonade and a raspberry Collins. These cocktails will be a perfect compliment to a Chicago summer day and their patio. Refreshing and tasty! Now onto the food. For starters we went with the beets and labneh, sunchokes and the rye berry salad. You can't go wrong with any of these and but personal favorite was the rye berry salad. It has pears, goat cheese and a blackberry vinaigrette that all pair well together. Second round we got the scallops and quail. The scallops were cooked perfectly and come with mushrooms and a red pepper sauce. The quail is served fried with a pomegranate glaze that is bursting with flavor. Definitely get both of these. I repeat get both of these dishes and you won't regret it. The restaurant has all around good vibes with tasty food, great music and friendly staff.

It was early on a Friday (6:30pm) but I was expecting a few more people in there, being a Friday. There were two tables occupied and one person in the bar. That's never a good sign. I was excited that the cocktail menu had an Aviation (my favorite!) so I ordered it. As the bartender was making it, I noticed that he took an orange peel and squeezed the acid into a flame to make like showy fire presentation, and then threw the orange peel in the drink. Noooo! The drink has lemon juice in it! So, the drink tasted like orange more than lemon. It didn't matter because it barely tasted like an Aviation anyway. Both our drinks could not have been more than 2oz. He gave us glasses with basically a little taste of a poorly made drink. I looked at the food menu and it looked so sad. It's pretty much a few small plates with very little description and much to be desired. We paid for our $12. shots and found another place to eat. I gave this place 2 stars only because the bartender was really nice.

The craft cocktails were on point; and the menu offered a nice selection.  However the bar didn't have Jameson or any Irish whiskeys which is odd and they only have about six beers .  Food menu is also very limited - and the quality of the food itself was a little all over the place: the polenta chips were great, the scallops good and the pizza was awful while the croquettes were uber salty.  Service was top notch, something we always experienced at Taverna 750.  Speaking of, sad to hear they won't be continuing the boozy brunch experience that Taverna was known for (they will serve brunch, but just a standard one).   I'm all for second chances so I may or may not be back....",0.5041,0.821,0.098,0.082,0.5504120879120878

For food, we tried the polenta chips, beet salad, pizzettes and scallops. Polenta chips were amazing and completely different then polenta fries. They are crispy throughout with some areas of softness for a contrast in texture; they're seasoned very well and easily our favorite plate of the night. Beet salad was great, not too earthy at all!

A couple of the servers were wearing t-shirts with jeans/shorts, however, and I just felt that could be remedied with a simple dress code. * Per our server's recommendation we ordered 2 plates for each of us.  Myself and my partner were exceptionally pleased with the Chicken and Grits.  The smoked pulled chicken thigh had an excellent flavor. * My partner ordered the Biscuits and Gravy.  He was not impressed - the biscuits [2] were hard.  The flavor of the dish was nice, but the texture was not. * We ordered a Fettunta for each of us.  It's like an open-faced sandwich.  I thought it was yummy, if not just a simple egg on toast. * We ordered a mimosa carafe which was a generous champagne-to-fresh-squeezed-orange-juice ratio.  Yum! * Our server surprised us with complimentary Cornmeal Griddle Cakes [with candied walnuts, mixed berry syrup].  It was simple and underwhelming. * I will likely not be going back for food.  As my partner lives just around the corner, I may be back this summer for a cocktail on the patio [provided they get one!].",0.9946,0.813,0.145,0.042,0.6086718374218374
