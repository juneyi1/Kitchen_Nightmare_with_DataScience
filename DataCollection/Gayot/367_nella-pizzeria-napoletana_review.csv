2011-03-02,5.0,"Me & my date were in search for some authentic Italian pizza in Chicago, eluding all the typical Giordano's & Maggiano's, and fell upon Nella Napoletana. And thank God that we did! Very nice location, although parking is scarce so it might be better to hop in a quick cab ride or take the red line to Fullerton and it's only a few blocks away. The restaurant itself is nice. Vivid with Italian decor and overall a welcoming ambiance to it. The service was great. Our waiter seemed really knowledgeable of the menu and in turn gave many suggestions to satisfy what we were looking for. He asked and remembered our names which was a nice surprise. We ordered the arancini as an appetizer. It comes as 3 or 4 smaller sized arancini as opposed to the typical large arancini I'm accustomed to from family dining and local Italian bakeries. They didn't have much sauce or meat filling but the cheese was good and they turned out alright (I'm an arancini fanatic so I can't say they were better than some of the others I've had). Then we ordered two pizzas, the margherita and the quattro stagioni. Either pizza was enough to fill any two persons, so the portion sizes were generous. Their pizza is made in a wood-stove oven so everything cooks so beautifully. You can taste the difference from your typical pizza you may get around your neighborhood. The dough was fresh and flakey, the ingredients were amazing, and everything was very on point. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone searching for authentic Italian pizza in the Chicagoland area. I've gone multiple times afterwards and plan to continue going.",0.9941,0.817,0.178,0.005,0.4730158730158731

2011-02-20,1.0,"Not good. Undeserving. Figure it out or hang it up. The pizzas are good, but inconsistent. Tonight's consensus opinion--new sauce, something's different, and not quite right. And that's the good part, the pizzas. Everything else is very hit or miss, mainly miss, and, again, hugely inconsistent. The calamari has been best-in-city on some visits, on others, almost inedible, like tonight. And tonight the bowl was half-full, half the order I'm usually given, with maybe one-third of the cup of accompanying tomato sauce that I'm usually given? The Francesca salad that was supposed to feature blue cheese barely had any--I had to ask for some. And the calamari was my entree--and the waiter was asked to bring it when my family got their entree pizzas--but he nevertheless brought my calamari at least five minutes before the pizzas, and my calamari was cold by the time their pizzas arrived. Just not a good place. Head up the street to Mia Francesca's for much, much better food--and much, much better and more consistent calamari and Francesca salads.

2011-02-19,4.0,"Finally we gave this place a try this weekend - very good pizza indeed. The menu overall was quite authentic: the antipasto misto was a perfect dish to start out and just enough to share between the two of us. The pizzas matched the quality and taste of Spaca Napoli that I am just crazy about and this says a lot... The banana and chocolate calzone was delicious, even though quite heavy and we should have probably skipped this part. The double espresso was OK and I will make a suggestion: Please serve it in a regular espresso cup rather the cappuccino cup that you use - the less the better as far as the taste is concerned.

The real stand out for me was the carpaccio appetizer, which was so delicious I could have licked the plate. We will definitely go back. Oh, and don't forget the dessert.

2011-02-07,3.0,"Stopped by here on a Sunday night for an easy dinner.  We had our pick of tables and sat in the window. I was excited to see they have arancini on the appetizer menu, I feel like I have a hard time finding it in Chicago. So we ordered it and 3 large ones arrived with a generous serving of marinara sauce.  I ordered the mozzarella di bufala pizza and it was bigger than I expected and really good. I loved the sauce, I just wish there was more of it.  My friend ordered the spaghetti & meatballs. The server told us the meatballs were homemade, which was obviously true but I am not sure the noodles were.   We had the torta bacio for dessert and I loved the crunch base. I was worried the white chocolate center would be to much but it was smaller than I expected.",0.932,0.789,0.158,0.052,0.5495811287477953
2011-01-28,4.0,"So I've passed this place a million times, but always thought the name was something different--but still Italian? Anyways, I don't judge a restaurant by its name, so in I went. The place is huge and very updated. There is a separate party room which looked really nice and it was situated right across from the bar/chef area. The menu is traditional italian, with specials on most weeknights. The specials, in my opinion, probably draw most of their crowd.  There were a lot of big tables with large parties and a few open seats. But besides that, it wasn't crowded on a Saturday at 8. Our waiter was excellent, he took great care of us and went the extra mile to suggest what to try and even gave us free dessert! Ok, it's not like the dessert was $20, but still. I'll take it! We got the Vesuvio pizza/calzone ($14) and the chocolate gelato ($5). The Vesuvio is half calzone half pizza. There were artichokes on the pizza and ricotta and sausage in the calzone. It was all very good and perfect for two people BUT, the calzone part was def. not warm. It probably had something to do with cook time ratio, yadda yadda. It was still good, but could do with some more degrees. The Italian wines were around $7+ and the Italian beers ran around $5. All in all, I'd probably come back again for a weekday special.

2011-01-26,4.0,"I'm definitely more of a chicago style pizza guy, but this pizza is pretty amazing. The misshapen, bubbly crust, all the cheese, the fresh and tasty ingredients. I've never had a bad pizza here, it really all just depends on what you want. They have two varieties, one with tomato sauce, and one without (I think they usually have cheese instead of tomato sauce?). Any of their pizzas with mozzarella is great, I particularly like the Pizza Funghi e Salsiccia and the Contadina. i haven't tried any of their other dishes, I'm sure they're great but I just can't help getting the pizza whenever I go here. It's not a ton of food, definitely not chicago style - one person can easily eat an entire pizza.  The atmosphere here is fun, they play a lot of eighties music, and have little foosball men up to decorate the walls. Also a couple of tvs, on which I'm sure they play all the best sporting events when they're on. The desserts here aren't bad, but there's so many other better desserts in the area that I'm not sure I'd ever get dessert from here again. But definitely get the pizza!

2011-01-16,1.0,"My boyfriend and I loved Nella Pizzeria, and we just for the first time returned since it has changed to Francesca's.  We went on a Sunday afternoon, and we took two out-of-town guests with us who wanted to have lunch before some last-minute sight seeing.  We were seated by the hostess around 12:30 PM.  We ordered a round of iced tea and sodas which were served by the hostess.  Our waiter came over and apologized for our having to wait for him.  We were fine at this point, only very hungry, so we ordered immediately with a salad to start.  While taking our order, our waiter briefly explained something about expecting an extra 10-15 minute wait while the existing 20 top next to us was served their food.  We thought this was a bit strange, but it nonetheless counted as communication regarding our order, so we sat to wait for our salad.  We waited as the 20 top received their food.  We waited as a 2 top which was seated after us received their salads.  We waited as another 2 top which also was seated after us received their entrees.  By this time, we still had not gotten our salad.  We hadn't seen nor heard of our waiter by about 1:15, when my boyfriend finally got up to find him.  He found our waiter and acknowledged that he must be busy, yet politely he asked if we could at least get our salad.  The waiter agreed...still, no salad.  Meanwhile back at our table as we were looking all around at the 5 other small tables and the 20 top, the hostess came by and asked, ""Are you guys looking for something?"" Now, I was simply unable to answer that question.  My boyfriend and I are both in the service industry at the moment, and I just can't allow myself to convey any impatience or curtness to another server.  This is why I simply bit my tongue for the hostess because I couldn't get over the silliness of the phrasing of that question.  We were looking for the food that we ordered.  Any of it.  We were hoping at the very least for our waiter to come by and explain the situation, whatever it may be, so that we could exercise patience and understanding.  A more appropriate question from the hostess may have been, ""Is everything alright here?"" or  ""Is there anything I can help you with?""  There's just too much hilarity to be found in asking us whether we were 'looking' for something.  Meanwhile in addition to our looking widely around at this point, our table had an empty bread plate and four empty app plates.  I feel this could've been a visual cue that it was the the food that was missing.   Finally after it was nearly 1:30, we left cash for our drinks and my boyfriend found our waiter to tell him to cancel our order.  He even told the waiter he was sure it ""had nothing to do with him,"" though honestly at this point, it seemed plausible that our order had never been transmitted to the kitchen in the first place.   We were very disappointed.  We loved the food there and talked it up highly to our guests.  Also we had wasted all that time when our out-of-towners could've been doing anything else with there time aside from waiting for food that would never come.  As we exited, the hostess said something to the effect of, ""Thanks guys, have a great day!""  This again, was very inappropriate.  It's not as if we had sat, looked over the menu and in deciding that we didn't have a taste for anything they had to offer, had decided to leave.  This was a case in which the ball of the situation had been completely dropped.  No communication, no food, while all others around us continued to be served at least something they had ordered.   I used to crave the pizza at Nella.  I assumed that though the name had changed, I would love the pizza just as much under the name Francesca's.  Sadly, I wasn't given the chance to taste anything.  I don't think we'll be headed back.",0.9172,0.867,0.073,0.06,0.44434676434676434

The free bread on the table is sub-par, but really; who needs more carbs before mowing down on delicious pizza. The calzones literally make me insane because they are so yummy.

I have been going to Ciao Napoli in Logan Square for my pizza fixes. This place sort of reminds me of Ciao Napoli from the outside looks of it.  Walked in and the inside was totally different... Not as cozy and intimate as Ciao. Very crowded and loud (it was a snowy friday night). The hostess acted as if she was happy to see us and gave us a choice for seating. We decided to take the high top style seats not too far from the entrance/exit. The tables were very close, so close that our server (Melissa) literally had to squeeze in between to take our orders. Melissa was very nice and always had a smile on her face and made sure we were taken care of. The lower floor seating area had more space, but we thought the high tops were much cooler. I ordered the Pizza Funghi e Salsiccia....Melissa was proud that I was able to pronounce it correctly (I felt good about myself as well, LOL). This is some of the best pizza I ever had in my life, seriously!  I had pretty good pizza while I was in Rome this past summer and this pizza was definitely comparable to that. I added bufalo mozzarella to the pizza for a couple of extra $ and it was well worth it. Simply delicious!!!! Definitely a gem for Lincoln Park!

GOOD CHOICE!  He sent us 4 fantastic, thin, crispy crusted and generously topped pizzas.  Our waiter sliced each pizza at the table and we shared them.  Before the pizzas arrived, we have fried calamari which was perfect!  Then, to top off the meal, Chef Alfredo sent us two tasty desserts.  The gelato filled creme puffs topped with chocolate were delicious!  But the pastry filled with nutella and banana was unbelievable!   The cost for everything, including tip, was about $27 per person.  We all left stuffed and brought 1/2 a pizza home!

(See my review for Spacca Napoli). I lived with a very well known pizziolo and learned a thing or two about this art form, but never in my life did I ever see anyone creating such a thing of joy with such a scowl.  So thank you for making me feel welcome and comfy again! Onto the food:  Classic, simple, traditional Napoletana wood fired pizza.  I much prefer mozzarella, asiago, fontina and gorgonzola for my Quattro Fromaggi and you always oblige.  The insalata Panzanella is always fresh and crisp with just the right amount of EVOO and you know how I love the Caprese although I prefer fresh tomato vs roasted.  Desserts are just divine  Calzone Lina is worth every second on the treadmill and the Panna Cotta is delish with a hint of orange and raspberry. Your Pollo Limone is a direct hit and would be at the top of my list of favorite things if the custom 4 Cheese pizza would ever budge.  I am glad that you have claimed your identity.  You seem such a kinder and gentler place now.

2011-01-01,4.0,"Surprise...another great pizza joint in Chicago?  Could it be possible?  Yep. Especially one with a wood burning oven...you bet 'cha.  We got in quick in this place on a night where every other restaurant in the area was packed and it was worth it. Staff is fast, friendly, and the food comes out fast too.   Atmosphere is also cool as they really worked hard to have an open style kitchen where you can see the cooks prepare the pizzas and see the large wood burning oven. To add affect, they also have a large mirror on top of the prep area so that the entire restaurant can see the pizzas being prepared. Obviously, cool for someone that appreciates the cooking process and esp those that have kids.   They started us off with homemade sourdough bread with olive oil.  It was quite tasty esp for us that were starving.  We then ordered the prosciutto w/arugula pizza that my wife and I split.  It was played out as a single entree but the pizza was big enough for two (and at $14 a pop, it seemed a bit pricey). We ordered it mainly because other reviewers recommended it but not sure if it was the best.  Had big chunks of arugula and Parmesan cheese which was good but the prosciutto was really fatty and eventually made me gag a little.  The crust is excellent though...and typical of a wood burning oven joint.  I could eat the crust by itself.  My son had the kids spicy pepperoni pizza and although he found the meat to be a little too spicy for him, he ate quite a bit of it.  And i can confirm that it was super good.  Better than our pizza.  They also added bunny ears to his pizza which we he really loved.  So good for kids? Check. For drinks, i ended up having one of their Italian cabs from a pretty descent list of wines.  I liked it.  I didn't get to check out their beers though but i should of.  For dessert, we had the chocolate torta (which was like a little chocolate truffle pie) and my son had the lemon sorbet. Both were really excellent and highly recommended. Have to say that the area is quite clustered and this place would not be my go to wood burning pizza place because of it.  But...if i'm back here looking for something to it, i'll try it again.",0.9967,0.809,0.171,0.02,0.5287950937950939

2010-11-27,1.0,"First of all, Nella is now called Francesa's. Secondly, I used to really love it. Like, 4-star loved it.  I live around the corner and have come in often since it first opened.  I also ordered carry-out several times.  Once or twice the carry-out pizza was soggy, but I kept going back because I had overall positive experiences and like how close the restaurant is to my apartment. However, I just had an extremely weird and uncomfortable experience at Nella/ Francesca's, and am sad to say I don't want to go back again. My boyfriend and I went in for dinner and after appetizers, we each ate half of our individual pizzas.  After awhile, our waiter stopped by and asked quote ""Do you want these boxed up?"" The fact that that's a direct quote comes into play later.  Yes, I did want a full half of a $14 pizza boxed up, and my boyfriend wanted to take his home as well.  A few minutes later, the waiter came back with both of our pizzas packed tightly with the slices smooshed on top of each other in ONE small container.  Every other time I've dined at Nella, my half-pizza left overs were always packed nicely into it's own mini-pizza box.  There were two things wrong here: 1) Why would they assume that just because two people of the opposite sex are having dinner, that they live together and would both be taking their leftovers to the same house? I wasn't wearing a ring on my finger, and both of us were dressed down-- so it wasn't obvious that we were on a date or even dating each other at all.  Was one of us supposed to take our pizza in our hands when we went home to our respective apartments?  2) I don't eat meat-- never have, never will. I don't eat food that has meat on it, or that was cooked or stored with meat.  I'm not super picky and I don't like to make a big deal about it, but having my boyfriend's super-meaty pizza smashed into my plain cheese and basil pizza ensured that I wouldn't be able to eat any of my leftovers. If it were a slice or two, who cares? But it was a FULL HALF of my (expensive) pizza. I debated whether or not to say anything to the waiter, because I don't like complaining, but I ended up deciding to.  I explained that we had two separate meals that were shoved into one container and that since I don't eat meat, I wouldn't be able to eat any of my food now.   At first, the waiter was really understanding and said he would take care of it-- maybe this was my mistake, but I took this to mean that I would get more pizza so that I could have the meal I paid for.  He even went to the back when he said he would take care of it, so I thought he was putting another order in.  My boyfriend and I ordered dessert and finished our meal.  The check came.  We paid.  We waited for my food... The hostess came by and asked if we were waiting for something.  At that point, I got really confused and embarrassed and explained that I thought I was waiting for a pizza since our waiter had made a mistake and put two separate meals into one container... But then I started to doubt myself.  The waiter came back and was really weird/rude and goes ""My hostess tells me there is a problem here and that you are waiting for something. What is it?""  At this point, I got REALLY embarrassed (again, I don't like making a big deal out of the vegetarian thing, nor do I like complaining at restaurants), and said ""Never mind, it's fine."" Then he said something about if I don't communicate with him, then how is he supposed to know what I want, which made me want to run out the door even more.  Again, I said ""It's not a big deal, just forget it,"" and he continued: ""I told you the server made a mistake and put the pizza together, how are they supposed to know who's vegan? What is it that you want?"" I explained that I thought I would get more pizza to take home-- I just wanted to be able to eat that other half for another meal. It's not like it was a $5 special from Domino's.    I think he thought that that was a really bizarre request, but he went to the kitchen, came back, and told me that they could make me a margherita pizza if I waited a few minutes.  By that time, I just really wanted to leave, and what made it worse is that the margherita pizza isn't even what I ordered/paid for (I had the Buffalina)-- it just happens to be the cheapest pizza on the menu.   On my way out, I stopped to speak to Joe, who I think is the manager.  Again, I come to Nella often and never had an experience like this before.  He was nice and offered my boyfriend and I free pizzas the next time we came in, but I still felt weird.  He said something like, ""Next time, just make sure you request different boxes when they ask you how you'd like them packed."" Is that the new standard now? Do restaurants throw everyone at a table's food into one container unless you specifically ask?

The restaurant is really cute on the inside, but can't get very congested.  It started getting crowded as time passed and my chair kept getting run into and kicked...which trust me is distracting and annoying.  I think the pizzas are a little over priced as well, but definitely worth a try.",0.8693,0.786,0.133,0.081,0.48061821219715956

Pizza Margarita arrived with a bready-like crust that had been singed considerably and was not remotely like something that one would find in Napoli.  Wife thought Mozzarella was not fresh.

2010-10-28,4.0,"Food:  4 Service:  4 Atmosphere:  4 Value:  3 Another celebration and another great meal I didn't have to pay for.  I went on a Saturday night with a group of 7 and surprisingly, the restaurant wasn't entirely full.  It was also a little bright for my taste but still had a fun atmosphere.  We were seated right by the open wood-burning oven and had a great view of the pizza-making.  There's a mirror strategically placed above the chef station so you can see your pizza being made from your table-a pretty awesome feature. I know I haven't talked about pizza yet, but, like most people, I absolutely love it.  Like Guy Fieri says, ""when pizza is good, it's great, and when pizza is bad, it's still good.""  I couldn't agree more with that statement.  We ordered a few different items and the ones I can attest to eating were the Melanzane (Eggplant Parm Appetizer), Insalata Mista, Rigatoni all Siciliana (smoked mozzarella, eggplant, garlic oil, tomato sauce, fresh mozzarella), and a pizza with tomatoes, mozzarella, artichoke, mushroom, basil, and olive oil. The Melanzane was a solid start.  Nothing special about it but done right.  The mozzarella was fresh and flavorful, and the leftover sauce/cheese mix went well with the fresh bread on the table.  My one complaint is that it was quite small, even for an appetizer. The Insalata Mista I could have done without.  If I'm ordering a salad, I want more than just lettuce in it.  Yes, I know it's fancy ""mixed greens"" with a high quality balsamic vinegar, but that's just not going to do it for me.  Normally being ""light"" is a good thing, but this featherweight salad was lackluster. The Rigatoni, on the other hand, was one of the best pasta dishes I have ever had.  It was rich, flavorful, and cheesy.  The pasta was also cooked to a perfect al dente.  The vegetables, cheese, and sauce were plentiful and blended nicely together.  I know this is a pizza restaurant, but I found myself reaching for the pasta more than any other dish on the table. The pizza was great and just what you would expect from this place.  It was a good size and well-constructed.  All the ingredients tasted incredibly fresh and I appreciated that most pizzas came with red sauce.  I know white, sauceless, flatbread-type pizzas are all the rage these days (especially at thin crust joints), but I appreciate a good tomato sauce and Nella certainly has it.  Something that didn't bother me that may bother others is that the pizza is not entirely crispy (especially for being cooked in a wood-burning oven).  I don't mind slightly soggy, bread-y pizza but those of you expecting pizza on a cracker may be disappointed. Overall, we had a great night out with some great food.  It was a little pricey for its location and cuisine style, but you won't leave unhappy if you go.  I'm not dying to go back for the pizza, but that Rigatoni was something I'll think about at every Italian restaurant I go to in the future.

2010-10-27,3.0,"I met some friends here for dinner on a weeknight.  Getting seated was a total breeze, so that's nice. We were starving so we ordered the calamari (fried) and the suppli.  One of my fellow diners is my Italian former roomate and we used to make suppli with leftover rice for a treat in college.  Our suppli were way better.  The calamari was also disappointing; the breading was pale and was flaking off.  The marinara sauce was eat-with-a-spoon worthy, though, so that's awesome. Our pizzas arrived fairly quickly which is nice when you're starving!  We ordered the quattro formaggi and the margherita.  It may seem odd for me to say this, but the quattro formaggi was just a bit too... cheesy.  The margherita had fantastic flavor though, so that was great. My chief complaint about the pizza was that while tasty, was not Neopolitan style.  I'm not sure how they bake their pizzas, but the pizza I make at home baked on unglazed terra cotta tiles comes out about a million times crispier than that.  The crust was very chewy, the edge parts were too thick and the middle part (under the toppings) was wet and soggy. I ate a bunch of pizza here and didn't leave hungry, don't get me wrong, but calling it Neopolitan is a bit of a misnomer. Another bright spot: the bread is smoky tasting, which is amazing.  After eating a slice, my friend blurted out ""this bread tastes like bacon!""  which she cried out somewhat embarassedly since our other friend doesn't eat pork.  It was ok though, no pork products were used in the manufacture of that bread.",0.9894,0.764,0.175,0.061,0.5872649572649574

Needless to say, that started us off on the right foot! (A wine-o bribe works 100% of the time on us!)  We ordered the Caprese and despite it being late October the tomatoes were perfectly ripened and the mozzarella di bufala combined to make the perfect starter.  We decided to split the Prosciutto e Rucola wood fired pizza - thin fluffy crusty perfection topped with smoked mozzarella, Prosciutto di Parma, arugula, shaved parm and olive oil. It was fabulous (as are the Margherita and Diavola, which I have tried on my previous visits).  Our waiter was also helpful with wine suggestions and I was beyond happy with the red Zinfandel.  Just when we thought we were ready for our check, the waiter arrived with fresh plates. After momentary confusion, the waiter explained that the chef would like us to try the dessert calzone filled with melty Nutella and bananas, topped with vanilla gelato and sprinkled with powdered sugar. Um, ok!!! If I had known this was coming, I would have boxed more of the pizza to-go and indulged in more of this blissfest.

2010-10-17,5.0,"I love Chicago magazine and I saw the article about the 25 best pies in town. Now pizza is my FAVORITE food ever! I could eat pizza everyday. I love it! So you can imagine why that article caught my attention! Upon reading that article I decided I'd eat my way through all 25 of those pies- if it's the last thing I do! Then just the other day I was strolling down Clark and spotted Nella Pizzeria- the name caught my eye. Nella is the name of a friends niece- it's an adorable name and she's an adorable kid! I decided I had to try their pie! After all, they've been written up in Chicago magazine as one of the 25 best pies in town AND they have a cute name! So of course a group of us got reservations. We actually had 5 people in our group and called ahead for a 7:15 reservation. Now things got off to a not so great start- we arrived and discovered they messed up our reservation. They had us down for 7pm (not 7:15) and we were late, according to their records, so they had given our table away. They told us we'd have to wait 20 minutes for another table. Not good.... So I told them that's too bad- I am an elite yelp'er. Suddenly, the guy running things spotted a free table in the back of the restaurant and had the staff clear it off for us and seat us there. I was satisfied. Next thing I know the guy that was running things brought over calamari and an antipasto platter- complimentary- to apologize for our reservation situation. So a review that would have been 3 or 4 stars shot up to 5 right there. It's OK to make a mistake- but to make up for it they way they did- now that's service! Our table ordered 3 pies- the margherita (the star of the show, in my opinion), the diavola (it's got spice and kick) and the romana (yes, it has anchovies).  Now I could have eaten the margherita all by myself. The pies aren't huge and they are pretty light (this isn't heavy Chicago style deep dish) so really, one person can eat a whole pie. The margherita just tasted fresh. The basil was so awesome and fresh- OMG it was yummy. I loved loved the crust. It was delightful! The entire pie was really perfection. BEST margherita pizza I have ever had. I am still craving more. The diavola was the next best of the night. I liked that it was a totally different flavor. It has spicy salami and red pepper flakes. There was some real flair to this pie. And finally the romana. We ordered this as an experimental pie. It was good but not great. I would not get it again. Anchovies lead to a super salty super fishy flavor. I did not go back for seconds on this pie.  Then the dessert. We think a table placed a desert order then changed their minds or something because it seemed as though a waiter was trying to find a home for this dessert and was unsuccessful. He finally came by our table and asked- do you want a complimentary dessert? I said yes sir! And volia! I don't know what it was- it was a giant cream puff with nutella and chocolate and banannas inside and gelato on top.. It was quite good- I'm just not a nutella person. The perfect dessert for me is either icecream (or gelatto) or cupcakes. I'm not into really extravagant dessert. So although this was tasty it didn't totally wow me either. HOWEVER, the fact that it was complimentary did help with the tastiness of the dish! Also I think a normal person with a normal sweet tooth would LOVE this dessert. It's just not my taste. Thus, I ordered chocolate gelato for myself. And THAT was delish! On man do I love gelato!! The restaurant is quite large but also quite busy so I'd call ahead for a reservation. Towards the back there is a room partioned off with a wall of foosball players which is kinda cool. All waiters wear soccer shirts and the light fixtures are really swanky! All in all, I would def return. As I said above, people make mistakes, and that's OK- it's how you handle these mistakes that matters. And at Nella Pizzeria they handled their errors perfectly!

It felt a little relaxed and I wasn't in the mood to get crazy, at least not that early. We arrived at about 8PM and the place was PACKED. Jammed! I was shocked. I love seeing restaurants crowded. We were told it was a 20 minute wait but were seated in 5 minutes (sweet!). We sat down and placed our orders. I hate to say this, but I was very disappointed that there wasn't any bread and olive oil. I was starving and needed a little something before the main course.

Tasty, but we only got three, meh. I went ahead and ordered the marinara pizza. I'm boring but whatever. Have to say the pizza was great and it was an excellent serving. Not too much food to feel sick, but I was happily filled. Overall, I very much enjoyed Nella Pizzeria.

While the salads and apps came out very timely, our pizza took an hour, perhaps more. All I know is we were all saying ""what is going on back there?""  We think they forgot to put the order in, but instead of apologizing and graciously giving us at least one of them on the house, they just set them on our table and gave us bread, which should have come out when we sat down.  The pizzas were delicious, but I'm not completely sold because of the service we had.  We had a little one with us and they gave her pizza virtually right away, which was awesome. She was a happy camper and the pizza itself was in a fun shape.

2010-07-27,3.0,"When we got to this place, we were actually surprised to find out that it wasn't My Pie, which didn't seem to be there anymore. But in any case, wanting pizza, we went in. And it was pretty good pizza. The atmosphere was a little upscale for what we expected, as it was pretty modern inside and an air of trendy and snotty hung in the air. The menu is also a little tough, as most of it is in Italian, and you have to work kind of hard to figure out what's what (unless you speak Italian). Most of the pizzas aren't your run-of-the-mill types, as you don't pick things from a list of ingredients--the topping combos are pre-ordained, meaning you pick from the types of pizzas they have decided are good (and again, described in Italian unless you go looking).  We brought my brother, who is not adventurous when it comes to eating out, and I could tell he was skeptical of the artichokes and raisins and other California-style toppings that were featured on a lot of the options. I mostly agreed, as we just wanted sausage and mushrooms.  Luckily we found it, and despite the fears of the decor, the waiter (who was really nice, if not overzealous), and the menu, that pizza was really, really fabulous. Brick-oven made, thin, crisp crust, and tasty, fresh ingrediets. So it's a different kind of place, maybe a bit upscale for a Friday night pizza run, but I could see how a lot of people would take that as a positive. Certainly a place we'd go back to, give another shake.",0.9608,0.867,0.105,0.028,0.5899055489964582
2010-07-26,2.0,"Nella is a beautiful space, with an excellent waitstaff and friendly hosts, but sadly that can't save a restaurant if the food is substandard.  We ordered drinks to start, and I got a white wine. It came barely above lukewarm.  Even the bottle of water provided to us was not much colder.  Is there some refrigeration issue at hand here?  Because on a blisteringly hot day in July the last thing I want to drink is tepid pinot grigio.   Then we got the Insalata Mixta.  A huge salad was presented to us, but there were 4 cherry tomatoes and 5 olives on it and a barely imperceptible vinaigrette.  A lot of money for just lettuce. My gauge for how well a place makes pizza, especially Neapolitan style, is to order the Margherita (Tomato, Mozzarella, and Basil). I figure if this simple dish comes out poorly, you know not to bother with anything else on the menu.  I upgraded and got the Bufalina, which used buffalo mozzarella and was considerably pricier than the version with the regular mozzarella.  When the dish was presented, I was a little disappointed.  The crust was perfectly chewy and delicious, but the toppings were just sad.  6 tiny, tiny drops of cheese, 5 tiny, tiny basil leaves that were not evenly spread out, but all in a clump to one side.  The sauce was quite literally pureed tomato.  Now I love tomato, but there was not a hint of salt, spice or anything to enhance the sauce, and it came off as bland and lackluster.  Whether it was intended or not, the whole presentation screamed ""cheap"".  I might have even been insulted had the price been half for the same thing. Andy's pie was charred on the outside, and while I liked his far more than mine, he complained of cold spots and not-quite-melted cheese throughout the interior of his calzone.  I realize there are markups in any store, restaurant or service industry you go to. But there is also a thing called ""perceived value"".  If I am paying $15 for a pizza but it looks like it cost the venue all of 75 cents to make, and is sloppily presented on top of that, I am going to go to any number of alternate restaurants in the city and get something way better.",0.9714,0.814,0.123,0.063,0.5530666487983561

The Restaurant itself is Beautiful. It's a wide open space where you can actually see the Chef's working in the Kitchen. The Staff is friendly and accommodating. Everything from our server to the person working the door was wonderful.   While reading the Menu, I saw something that made my eyes bulge and mouth water. It's called the Vesuvius. It's part pizza, part Calzone. It seemed like a novel idea for a dish so I went for it.   The dish was served on a large, wooden cutting board and looked wonderful. The Pizza looked like some of the Traditional Italian Pizza that I ate in Europe. The Calzone part looked wonderful as well, but here is the part where things go downhill. I started out with a slice of Pizza. When I broke it apart, it was only a bit warm, and the cheese was runny. It tasted good, but I couldn't get over the Texture. The Calzone part was really bad. When you cut into it, some of the Cheese came running out like a Egg that was just cracked. The Cheese further inside the Calzone was clumpy and cold. I can't tell you how disappointed I was. I ended up picking through the Calzone and eating the parts that were cooked. I left the Cold, Clumpy cheese for the waste can.   I'm not sure if I got the version of Pizza that Nella was going for, but let's just say it was not for me. Maybe I was there on a bad day and the Chef didn't cook the Pizza all the way through.   The bottom line is: The staff was nice enough that I would give Nella another try. I know that the place is fairly new, so I will give them a few months to tweak the menu. I doubt if I would order the Pizza again. There are enough good looking Pasta dishes on the Menu to make me forget about the Cold, Clumpy Cheese.",0.9857,0.756,0.16,0.084,0.5893334893334894

There is a great little party room that I will keep in mind for future events. The only complaint I have is with the service.  Our waiter was very nice and served us quickly initially, but did not follow up during the meal, and it took a while to request our check.   This is beyond the restaurant's control, but there were a lot of kids running around, screaming and squealing.  I would recommend going later in the evening.    I will definitely come back!",0.9464,0.808,0.141,0.05,0.4989130434782609

The Caprese came with 4 servings and all of the ingredients were very fresh. The Melanzane was cute rolled up like an egg roll; it did not look like the standard Eggplant Parmesan and was not too heavy. As our main course, we split the Bufalina pizza.

First, the olives aren't on the menu -- but ask and you shall receive. Glad I asked because they were super delicious and the perfect thing to nosh on while waiting for the pizza.  The pizza: I had the margarita, because I think classics are the tops. Let me start with what I loved about it: just-right charred crust, perfect size, not cut but served with a pizza slicer.  What I didn't love: the marinara sauce had NO flavor. They say they use my fave tomatoes, but I don't think they use anything else (ie. garlic, salt, pepper) to make the sauce. And since I love sauce, it really made for an overall dull, lackluster pizza.  And the second thing that made this pizza unlovable: the temp. While it appeared cooked to perfection, it wasn't piping hot, or even very warm, when it arrived. It was maybe just warm. I don't know if it was sitting out too long before it was delivered or if the FREEZING temp of the restaurant just instantly cooled it. Either way, that was super disappointing.  However, to redeem the not-great pizza at this pizza place, the wine selection was great for amateur wine drinkers (us) and our server, whose name escapes me, was very nice, attentive and informative.

It isn't like any pizza your likely to have in Chicago, so don't be expecting something you're used to, but I'd highly recommend giving it a try.

My favorite pizza by far is the Diavola.  What really sets this pizza apart for me is that the crust is crispy, but still retains that chewiness on the top layer of the crust.  What I've found with Spacca Napoli is that their pizza can be somewhat soggy in the middle (I actually like that sometimes), but Nella's crust really stands up.

For pizza, the Diavola is awesome (the spicy salami has just the right amount of kick) but my favorite is the Prosciutto e Rucola. Ok, yes it's a little repetitve of my favorite salad because it's a white pizza with arugula, smoked mozzarella, Prosciutto di Parma and parmesan. But the simple, light flavors with the little smoke of the crust from the wood burning fire is delicious.

Also the dough itself was very tasty...I normally don't eat the crust but I had to in this case-soft, chewy and tasty!  Pizzas: We had the Bufalina pizza-made with buffalo mozzarella-nice straightforward pizza-my favorite of the night!  Would get again... We also had the Prosciutto e Rucola pizza- made with arugula and prosciutto - not bad, BUT for my taste the saltiness of the prosciutto and the smokiness of the mozzarella made it an unbalanced pizza- and the flavors were too much and too salty overall. I think it would have been better with either regular mozzarella or no prosciutto... I would not get this again. Dessert:  Had the tiramisu- was good-had more chocolate than I am used to having in traditional tiramisus -not a bad thing!  The panna cotta-great texture, perfectly done with subtle flavors of orange and vanilla coming though with a sauce of marinated raspberries on the side-my favorite!  Cannoli-dissapointing - the cream filling was fine, but the pastry dough itself tasted too much like the oil it was fried in ...not good.

Nice change after Sushi Row on the 2400-2600 block on Clark St.  Started out with a salad to share - Rucola e Parmigiano (Arugula, shaved parmigiano, extra virgin olive oil & lemon). At 8.99, I felt it was nicely priced because it was definitely enough for all 3 of us to share as a starter. Salad didnt blow me away, but the fresh parm was a very nice touch. I also love arugula so I was stoked. I think it was refreshing, but as I said, I am not racing back based on this salad.  As for the pizza, we went with the recommendation of the waiter - Prosciutto e Rucola )White pizza with smoked mozzarella, Prosciutto di Parma, arugula, shaved parmesan and olive oil). Really good and quality ingredients which I appreciated. I would absolutely get this again. The leftovers were great too! The next pizza was the Parmigiana (Tomatoes, mozzarella, eggplant, shaved parmesan, basil and olive oil). I wasnt such a fan of the tomato sauce so this pizza was sort of tainted for me. I would not get this again, unless I was drunk, perhaps.  Overall, pizzas were good and the brick oven gets points in every sort of way.

Switch it up, Nella. If I wanted to see a jersey, I would go to Wrigley! Oh, two final points: - They have fried dough in powdered sugar at the front door. This is free for the taking!

The most humiliating thing is the pizza was the best part.  The $9 salad consisted of one heaping handful of bitter arugula, with some over hardened shaved parm cheese and a wedge of lemon.  Truly an abomination of a salad.

Ordered the calamari (excellent and crispy, no grease) and grilled veggies (ample plate of lightly grilled and dressed zukes, peppers, eggplants) for a good start. Pizza Margherita was excellent, always a good test of a pizza place because there are only three ingredients (tomatoes, mozz, basil) and if they're not good, it will be obvious from the first bite.  Also had the pizza with tuna, which was a nice change of pace, and the sausage.  All perfectly cooked. The cannoli was among the best I have ever eaten (and I grew up on the South Side in the 50's), with a shatteringly brittle shell. We also had the profiteroles which were good, but I prefer hot fudge rather than cold chocolate sauce on mine.

As for classic Chicago vs. New York pizza conundrum, my spouse is from New York (Brooklyn/Queens) and I know he prefers either Nella or SN to any kind of ""Chicago"" pizza....especially deep dish, which he considers an abomination.  But anyone who calls himself a New Yorker and raves about the current status of NY pizza is either young, delusional, or both.  We have spent the better part of several trips back to NYC over the years trying to find ""real"" pizza like it was back in the day, and have sadly concluded it does not exist there any more.   No pillowy soft-crusted slices that you fold over and eat with one hand while the oil drips down your arm.  Instead all you'll find is wood-burning oven pies with blackened crusts and very little oil, like yuppified and healthified versions of the real deal.  In that respect, pizza at Nella and SN (also Vinci, and Bricks a few minutes south) are better than the New York pizza of today.  They have tooth, and they are not burnt. As for slicing your own pizza at the table with the little pizza wheelie thing, my guess is that this is to accomodate both Chicagoans--who like their pizza cut in little squares, and New Yorkers-who like their pizza in large wedges (aka ""slices"").  This way you can do your own thing. Hey, if any of you Yelpers out there know of a NYC pizza joint that makes slices like in the good old days, let us know!!  In the meantime, Nella should satisfy our urge for good pizza here in Chicago.",0.9935,0.829,0.128,0.043,0.5061139533866805

So, we arrived at 7:30 and, low and behold, there was a wait. Never fear though, it would only be ""10-15 minutes, 20 max."" Okay. Well, there is NO WHERE to stand and wait, which makes the 50 minutes we ended up waiting very uncomfortable. That and the fact that there was an entirely unused ""private"" dining area that was not being sat because of ""lack of staff."" Onto the food... I had the quattro formagi, which everyone agreed was the best of the bunch. This is very similar to authentic Roman pizza, but I would not argue that it is exact. Other comments from our party were that the sauce was far too acidic, rapini was overpowering (which isn't their fault, just a little strong for the pizza) and terramissu was flat. Overall, I would go back if walking by and saw that it wasn't busy, but probably wouldn't make advanced plans to do so. The pizza is tasty, but nothing to go out of your way for and the uncomfortable and long wait started us on a bad note.",0.2707,0.819,0.095,0.086,0.4883333333333333
2010-01-08,2.0,"I was excited to hear Nella was giving her former employer--Jonathan at Spacca Napoli--a run for his money. While Spacca Napoli makes exquisite pizza, a city the size of Chicago could benefit from a little competition. I called ahead of time to see about making a reservation (they don't take 'em) and what the expected wait time would be. The host answered with a poorly pronounced ""buona sera"" and a promise that they had never had a party wait longer than 15 minutes. Upon arrival our party of four waited--standing--for longer than 30 minutes in a roaring tsunami of noise to be seated. While I enjoy the bustle and buzz of a thriving restaurant, on a busy night Nella is not conducive to the sort of lingering conversation one expects at a trattoria or pizzeria. Kudos, though, to the wait staff for keeping customers content with small plates of provolone and olives. After being seated, we each ordered one variation or another of the traditional Neapolitan buffalo mozzarella-tomato-basil combo. We waited 20 minutes our pizzas to arrive. When they did arrive, they were downright disappointing. The crust of the dough was thin with large charred bubbles while the inside was undercooked and tasteless. I suspect these are the results of cooking the pizza at too low a temperature (undercooked interior) and for too long (large charred bubbles as opposed to lots of small charred bubbles). The ingredients up top were equally uninspiring. The buffalo mozzarella was as bland as the dough--not sharp and salty as it should be. The basil tasted as though it had wilted even before being baked to death and the tomato sauce was thin and far too salty. A proper Neapolitan pizza is so simple that one simply can not cut corners when it comes to quality of ingredients and cooking method. While many customers will likely be fooled into thinking Nella is serving up a solid Neapolitan pie, a far better rendition of this Italian classic can be found at Spacca Napoli and at the same price.",0.6367,0.877,0.071,0.053,0.5141836734693879
2010-01-06,5.0,"Excellent pizza! This is one of two places I make sure to always visit when I'm in Chicago (Toro Sushi being the other -- see review). Their classic wood-burning oven placed in a position of prominence sets the tone for the entire restaurant. Try to sit as close to the oven as you can, very cool to watch the pizzas being made and the mere 90 seconds it takes to bake each pizza.  My favorites in order are the Diavola, the Vesuvio (which has a cool factor to it because there is a second crust added to the top causing it to bubble into the shape of a volcano--thus the name), the Fiorentina and the Salsiccia e Friarelli (which is delicious but you can't eat more than a slice or two because the broccoli rabe is not in season right now).  The way to eat at this place is to order a bunch of pizzas and share them with your friends. Also ask your server to bring these out in waves so they don't get cold as you eat. Be sure to grab a bottle of wine or two as well. Keep in mind they don't take reservations so you may have to wait a bit, but it's definitely worth it. Enjoy",0.984,0.842,0.158,0.0,0.5926563958916901

We got the margherita and the diavola. The dining in time there were 6 of us. I know people have complained about service, but it is a new place and that happens.  I think they have definitely ironed some of the service issues out, because we had an excellent experience with our server.  The bread they brought out was really good with a drizzle of olive oil and sprinkling of parsley on each piece. We ordered a five pizzas (Bufalina, Prosciutto e Rucola, Sorrentina, Salsiccia e Friarielli, Capricciosa) and tried a pasta.  The pasta was al dente!  That just makes me happy.  Almost forgot we split a Vesuvio to start. Amazing!  I suggest giving it a try Another nice feature at Nella is they have a mirror placed about the pizza work station.  It is something they had at culinary school so the students could see the chefs preparing food while staying seated in the classroom.  I think it is a cool touch.

Nella will be a future destination for me and my friends with children, as it was a very kid-friendly place (along with kids pizzas shaped like bunny heads with big ears... fun!)

This style of pizza is how pizza was first made in Naples, Italy.  Some people on here don't seem to enjoy this style of pizza, but keep in mind, if you go here, you are getting authentic napolitano syle pizza, with a very very thin crust.  People shouldn't get disappointed when they get exactly what they order.   Personally, being Italian, this is some of the best Italian pizza I've had.",0.9214,0.852,0.108,0.039,0.46452380952380956

2009-12-18,3.0,"An authentic, Italian family style pizzeria in the heart of Lincoln Park that accomplishes the goal of light and tasty think crust pizza. To be honest, we went for a quick early bite to get a taste of the place. The meal consisted of two pizzas and a caprese salad. The first thing that caught my attention with the food was the bread (served with the caprese). I don't know a lot of words to describe bread, but it was soft, salty/tasty, and lightly toasted. It was just yum and served as a good omen for the rest of the food (considering bread is a key ingredient). The caprese was uneventful, and if anything a little overpriced at 7.99 (I'm thinking 5.99). The two pizza's we ordered were the Parmigiano (12.99) and the special of the day Pizza Conadina (14.99). Without doubt the Parmigiano was the better dish, it consisted of Tomatoes, mozzarella, eggplant, shaved parmesan, basil and olive oil. It was as good as it sounds, crisp on the outside but soft dough, great tasting tomato sauce and fresh eggplant, cheese and oil. How do we know the pizza sauce was so good? The second pizza (the special) didn't have any and it was obvious. The conadina had Italian salami, mini tomatoes, white cheese (not sure what) and arugula. It wasn't bad, but just lacked the same flavor as the other pizza, and the italian ""salami"" was more like overgrown pepperoni and a little undercooked in my opinion (I'm no expert on italian meats). And at $2 more than the parmigiano, I felt a little silly to say the least. Aside from the food, the decor was welcoming and the service attentive (maybe a little too much, but it was a slow). The space is surprising large, with a few sections divided throughout. One wall was made out of foosball players (pretty funny), while there were two large TVs by the bar area. Light fixtures were made out of old wine glasses while large plant arrangements hung from the ceiling. However, the best part of the place I noticed is the large mirror hanging above the pizza preparation area that allows the customers watch their food from start to finish. In all the experience, while short and sweet, is something I would recommend and hope to return to try more items. Many families filed in as we were leaving and I suspect the place will do well (a second location is already in the works).

Fast forward to last night, about one month later, our kitchen was a mess... so I didn't feel like cooking, but needed to bring out the fiancee for some dinner.  Time to revisit Nella.  Here's the recap: Prosciutto e Bufala:  A beautiful looking appetizer (you can see the only photo currently).  The mozz was melting in your mouth with creaminess, and the prosciutto was definitely tasty.  14.99  Tasty, but would likely not get again. Pizza Funghi e Salsiccia:  Tomatoes, sausage, red sauce.  The topping were very fresh, but there was a definite wetness on the pizza that made the crust a little bit soggy.  Flavors were bursting, and overall, excellent pizza.  13.99 Pizza Quattro Formaggi:  White pizza, four cheeses, each lending it's own flavor.  Impressively, each of the cheeses really were able to hold it's own flavors.  13.99.  Panna Cotta:  Vanilla-orange creme flavors, with raspberries... wow, this was really a great highlight to the end of our meal.  Our server let us know that the dessert really are phenomenal and worth getting, and he was not off the mark at all on this one.  I recommend skipping appetizers, and saving room for dessert instead.  5.00 Service:  Our server, William, was phenomenal.  Granted, he was not one of the Italian server that were sporting the trendy sport shirts from Italy, but we had wonderful service.  From other reviews, it sounds like it may be a crapshoot for what kind of service you get... but William was top notch. Verdict:  Appetizers were okay, the pizza was fan worthy but not the best I've had, the dessert was delish.  I'd be happy to go back and enjoy more pizza, but at these prices, likely no more than once a month at best. Disclaimer:  I've found that I prefer more crispness to my crust... so my judgement of this place may be slightly biased.  Nonetheless, the fresh ingredients, great service, and excellent dessert made it a fave amongst pizza places for my fiancee and me.",0.9976,0.744,0.206,0.05,0.5411949685534592

I would have thought that if you dressed up Spacca Napoli a bit and gave the menu a little more variety (and Nella's does both), you'd have a five star restaurant. This place comes close, but it's not quite perfect yet. The pizzas themselves are probably as close to perfect as human hands can get. The dough comes out so good, it's hard to imagine how it gets better. It's just the right mix of crunchy and chewy, and the toppings have the perfect mix of seasonings. Nella's doesn't mess with Spacca Napoli's success, and I don't blame them for not improving on the formula. I don't think it's possible.  The atmosphere also manages to be elegantly laid-back, so it's just as easy to order beer as it is wine. The ambience is one of the wrinkles with Spacca Napoli that Nella's manages to iron out, but it added a few more. For one, things took much longer, and they were in no way understaffed. Hopefully this is a growing pains issue, or maybe they're going for an authentic Italian 3 hour dinner experience. Either way, if you're not the talkative sort, make sure you come with friends or dates that are, because you've got plenty of time to kill. Also, whoever chose the music must love the music they play in Abercrombie stores. They did too good a job with the decor to be playing that crap.

Nella Grassano the former pizza artisan from Spacca Napoli, her husband Frank, and Scott Harris of the Mia Francesca dynasty have created one incredible true to tradition Italian food experience. The Salmone Marinato (cold) was so good OMG the capers the slamon the olive oil simple, rustic, wonderful! You have to eat the Prosciutto e Bufala to understand how truly fresh, tasty and mouth watering it is. The Mozarella di Bufala is actually flown in from Naples. I also really enjoyed the Alici Marinate which are white anchioves marinated in garlic herbs and olive oil. The clean fresh taste of their fish was trully  memorable.
