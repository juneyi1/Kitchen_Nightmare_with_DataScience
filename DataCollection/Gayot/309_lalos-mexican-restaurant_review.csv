No taste at all. I just felt like I was eating something, that's it. Didn't taste any meat, beans, sour cream, anything. I'm not going to lie, I paid money for it and it didn't taste bad so I ate it, actually ate the whole thing. It just didn't taste like a burrito. Also, a few bites in juices starting dripping out the bottom and a couple more bites in it fell completely apart. I'll give it two stars since the $3.75 I paid for the chips and salsa (ridiculous, I know but it's the airport) wasn't all that bad.",0.8735,0.811,0.133,0.056,0.5268253968253969

I felt like I almost regretted this when I stepped up to the window pane displaying all the food choices... Nothing looks appetizing. Luckily my coworker was in front of me. She asked to sample the different meat. I sampled the steak because I thought chicken is bound to be good.  I ended up getting one chicken and one steak taco. These tacos are huge! It turned out that chicken is tastier than the steak, as I thought it would be... I ended up wishing I had sampled the chicken too. Maybe then I'd have order two chicken tacos instead of one of each.

I stopped by the restaurant inside Midway airport on a trip to Seattle on May 22, 2009. The staff was friendly and courteous and prepared my food pretty quickly which I was happy about since we are all on a time constraint when flying.  I ordered their steak quesadillas, rice, and re-fried beans. There food was nothing spectacular which I was very surprised since I've visited the majority of Lalo's Locations. Needless to say, about 15 mins after I received my food, I starting eating it in the airplane. I wasn't able to get half way through my meal when I had to pretty much jump over the passengers next to me to make it to the bathroom. The flight attendant (SWA) was awesome. When she heard me...yes she heard me...that is how violently I was puking, she came to my rescue. My entire trip in Seattle was ruined because I was sick the entire time.
