The bad it took 45 min to get a plate of cheese and the pint of root chips, there is no hostess or instruction so you just stand there waiting for someone to acknowledge you while blocking the narrow hallway or the sidewalk, and they didn't have enough burgers to fill our order. The wait for food seemed to be due to the place being short staffed since I only saw two servers manning the whole place and they were doing the best they could but i honestly don't know why it took 45 min to bring 3 cheeses and a pint of chips to the table. The other issue we had was that when we wanted to order the flight of burgers (we also asked about the flight of grilled cheese) the server told us we should just order the grilled cheese because they were almost out of burgers. We ended up just leaving and heading down the street to finish dinner and grab another drink.

Nope, but I politely told him the bartender said we could sit there.  He hesitantly agreed that yes, we may stay.  At this point the hostess showed up and cast unhappy looks at us for the rest of the evening. Our server took our order but did not ask if we'd like more food or wine.  They wanted us out.  Third:  food.  It was a mix of inedible, edible, and delicious.  I ordered the chips, which come in a cone with two dipping options.  3/4 of the chips arrived broken into tiny pieces!  It was like paying $5 for the bottom of the bag of Lays.  We gave up trying to dip broken chip fragments.   I also ordered the chorizo stuffed, bacon-wrapped dates.  THOSE were fantastic.  Order those.  Finally, the grilled cheese flight.  You get 3 kinds of sandwiches, halved.  2 of the 3 were good but nothing to write home about.  The third was doused in lemon zest.  Yuck yuck yuck.  I managed two bites and gave up.  My friend took one bite and threw in the towel.  On the plus side, we didn't have any issues with the portion sizes.  It's tapas - don't expect an Olive Garden-sized heap o' food and you won't be disappointed. Fourth:  wine flights.  I had the Homeslice (red) and my friend chose a flight of white.  Both contained two nearly identical selections.  I understand the dynamic of a flight is meant to be complimentary, but they very well could have poured me two glasses of the same wine.  I'd like a little more variety please.  Otherwise I enjoyed the wine quite a bit. In conclusion, I probably won't be back.  Mediocre food (at best), questionable hospitality practices, and deafening noise levels.  Meh.",0.9935,0.807,0.145,0.048,0.4422891707775429

The menu was nice - a variety of wine flights along with more wines by the glass or bottle.  It was a bit amusing to have a waitress explain a wine flight to us - really...do people not know what a wine flight is?  She then wasn't able to clarify whether one of the flights was red or white wine, which was surprising at a wine bar.  We each ordered a different flight and enjoyed 2 of the 3 selections. The chorizo-stuffed dates were tasty though I'm not sure the chorizo added much to the dish other than calories.  At the advice of our waitress, we ordered the meatloaf even though neither of us is particularly a fan of meatloaf.  It was delicious - moist with a little bit of a kick - and the highlight of our evening.

The Diablo shrimp was also delicious; they used just enough spice to make the shrimp flavorful but still very eatable. The pizza was probably the most bland. Don't get me wrong, it wasn't bad at all, but it certainly wasn't anything I would be blown away by. My date decided to get a white wine flight. From the sips that I stole from her glasses, they all seemed pretty sweet for just a regular white wine flight. It's not like they listed any Rieslings or anything.  Me? I ordered a bottle. Hey, it was a Saturday night! Don't judge! I ordered the Vallone Verta 'Riserva' 06. Not too bad. I was, however, looking for a darker, deeper, more flavorful wine, but since the weather in Chicago started to warm up, this refreshing red really brought a good feeling. Or maybe that's just the wine talking. Overall, I recommend to get there early as seats tend to fill quick. The place is a bit noisy so I hope you don't mind speaking at a higher volume. Don't go here if you're looking to fill up on food. I'd go here to snack on something after dinner while enjoying some wine.",0.9922,0.819,0.148,0.033,0.4785384936700727

2012-03-12,3.0,"Since I live in the neighborhood I was pretty excited to welcome the new wine bar with open arms. I walked past it for months and gazed longingly at the windows and thought of the grapes that I would soon become familiar with. My first attempt to go was on Wednesday at 7:15, which was quickly abandoned when the wait was going to be 20 minutes (not bad, but I'm very impatient) and the noise level sounded like it was near damaging decibels. Mimicking what is sure to be my golden years, I opted for a Sunday early bird dinner attempt. Fortunately this time my company and I were in luck! I really liked the space and the chic vibe. Upon reviewing the wine list, I was in love within moments. It had every varietal of red wine I could ever want, making it very difficult to order just one. The food menu I found a little surprising. It seemed less robust than what I expected, but regardless there were a few options that grabbed my interest. The bacon wrapped dates were huge and wonderful (blue cheese made them a little different than everywhere else), the Winter salad made me hope for snow, and the Truffle pizza underwhelmed. I think calling it pizza is quite the stretch, but I would order another flavor if I come back. Cheesecake for dessert was priced very reasonably and was delicious and hopefully made on site. All in all, service was incredibly slow (but very friendly), which is not a big deal considering I wasn't in a hurry, but if there are 3 tables in the place total, I would have expected something a little snappier.  I want to go back because I'm really hoping I can view this place as at least 4 stars. Right now I just feel kind of lukewarm about it. Fingers crossed it was just Daylight Savings/hangover/slow service clouding my mood.",0.9943,0.775,0.189,0.036,0.5294625621292287
2012-02-29,2.0,"My mother an I live in the neighborhood and wandered in for lunch. Understanding that the've only been open about 1.5 months, we were still underwhelmed. The place is cute. Really cute, but there was so sense of ambiance for lunch. No music or buzz.  The menu is...fine. a few sandwiches, salads, and pizzas. But it's a wine bar-where are the olives? Cheese? Bread? We asked the waitress about the sandwiches and she steered us away from a few and recommended some others. For just opening, there shouldn't be any item 'not worth recommending' the menu is too small for that. We ended up getting the meatloaf sandwich-which seemed more like a sausage sandwich-it was flavorful, but dry and didn't taste like meatloaf. I also got a pepperoni pizza, which tasted like a decent frozen pizza. Nothing special, too much cheese, not cooked long enough, and had piles of grease sitting on top. I would have rather paid for frozen pizza. there was also no dessert on the lunch menu.  I had a nice glass of wine.  On a side note, there were people walking in and out the whole time-UPS, employees, etc. so it felt like we were there and more in their way, as they prepped for the evening.   i might give it a try for dinner and drinks, but if the menu is more or less the same, I won't be interested. Hope they work on that-cause it's cute and Wells needs a venue like this.",0.9789,0.8,0.149,0.051,0.5091904761904762
2012-02-24,2.0,"I was really excited to try this place, but I was a bit let down by Flight 1551. Overall it was good, but I don't think its necessarily worth the wait to get in here.  Take this with a grain of salt as I was there the week it opened. Food: The trio of grilled cheeses was really yummy, as was the cheese platter we got. The bacon wrapped dates and pizzas were also really good. The wines we tried were all good, but I felt like they were overpriced (as was some of the food). I guess I felt like it just didn't stand out. It was good, but I felt like it wasn't much cooler than Bin 36, which is definitely cheaper.  Atmostphere: Nice place, cozy, modern. Good for a date and for conversation. Also think could be fun with a group of up to 6 people, but it's crowded and doesn't take reservations so you  could wait forever. Feel like they easily could rearrange the tables to fit more people and have more convertible tables. While we were waiting around there were 4 tables with parties of 2 at tables for up to 4 people...  Business: The place was SUPER chaotic, which is understandable when a place first opens.. but it was pretty frustrating. The host who took our name told my friend 30-45 minutes.. which became an hour and 15 minutes. He was pretty rude and we later found out he didn't even write down our name, instead when we inquired what was going on and gave him the name he was like.. oh yeah I wrote down ""tall dude"". That probably explains the extra wait...  We eventually figured out he bar was first come first serve, but  no one told us it was seat yourself.. or we also would have eaten a lot earlier.  Once we sat down, our server was very pleasant.",0.9975,0.721,0.24,0.04,0.49015873015873024
2012-02-19,2.0,"""meh"" is right. being a self proclaimed wine-o, i really excited when i saw flight 1551 opening on urban daddy. my first visit was on a weekday night with a party of 6. we arrived around 6:30 and it wasn't packed. after perusing the menu, i happily noticed the wine flights. after everyone at the table agreed to order one, the waitress (who had been pestering us to order something) informed us that the wine flights weren't available. huh? when we visited, flight 1551 had been open for exactly two weeks. the waitress said something to the effect of the sommelier not having everything ready yet. shouldn't the wine be the first thing you get ready if you're a wine bar & the word ""flight"" is in your namesake? confusing. everyone settled on a glass instead. there are many more wines available by the bottle than by the glass, but the by-the-glass selection was enough for me -- it's about 20 glasses. after we ordered our first round of drinks, it took about 30 minutes for them to arrive. i'm not sure what the delay was (since it wasn't that busy,) but everyone at the table noticed. this theme would continue throughout the evening. next, we ordered a few small plates to share. looking at the menu, the small plates appear to be pretty reasonably priced, but it turns out all of the small plates really are just that - SMALL. we ended up doubling up on almost everything we ordered because the portions were so small, which ended up limiting the number of things we could try. we ordered: chips & dip (if you order anything, ORDER THIS. twice.) dates (sausage stuffed & the second best thing we ate in my opinion) monkey bread (this one is savory, not sweet) mussels (dry) flight of grilled cheese (boring) winter salad (average) pesto pizza (thin crust, it was okay) cake trio dessert (chocolate overload, a bitter blackberry & the other one i can't even remember) as you can see, i wasn't really impressed by any of the food. as i've said in some of my other reviews, grilled cheese is a dangerous game. don't serve me something so basic i could make it myself. flight 1551 failed there. if i ever come back here, i'm definitely not eating. overall, this place completely underwhelmed me. the service, the lack of wine flights, the food. the only thing that was really memorable to me was the interior design. the ""wave"" wall they installed on the north side of the restaurant is absolutely gorgeous.",0.1622,0.859,0.069,0.072,0.46851116990005875
2012-02-19,2.0,"For a place that focuses on wine, we were not impressed! Wine list was ok, but could use more by the glass (personally I'd love to see a white from South Africa). Attention to detail seemed to be lacking - one of our first glasses (whites) arrived with a smudged rim, and wasn't a good recommendation (not strong enough to stand up to the food). One of the second glasses (reds) was flat like it'd been open for several days, and neither red was a great pairing - we asked for a standalone/light red and ended up with two robust reds that wanted a heavy pasta or steak. Service was efficient, we were well tended to, but the waiter clearly wasn't very well versed in the wine selections. The food, on the other hand, was very good - fair portions for the price, well-presented, and fresh flavors. We'd go back for the food, but  found the wine concept not to be top flight.",0.9823,0.708,0.217,0.075,0.4152
2012-02-15,5.0,"What a great addition to the neighborhood. We came on a Saturday night for a girls night, and what a better place to catch up than a trendy cute new wine bar!! I love the dark woods and the wavy wall that runs the length of the restaurant. The fireplace is the back is great, and probably hard to snag. The bar looks like a fun spot to sit and enjoy a bottle of wine and a pizza. It was far too crowded to sit at the bar, but we put our name in for a table and were quoted 30 minutes. We ordered a bottle of wine and patiently waited for our table to be ready. The hostess was great, she kept checking in with us to give us a status on when to expect our table to be ready. The prices are all very reasonable, although, i was quite annoyed they didnt have a reasonable Bordeaux selection!! We only ordered the house chips and the dates, and both were good. I would like to try more food next time Im there. We sat for hours and were never pushed to leave our table even though there seemed to be a wait throughout the evening. I would highly suggest this place for a nice date night spot or a fun girls night out location. I will definitely be back!",0.9923,0.773,0.206,0.02,0.5691189674523007

2012-02-11,3.0,"I felt compelled to write a review only because of the two extreme experiences I have had at 1551.  Last Friday night got two seats at the bar for my friend and I.  The bartenders and the pizza made it a great night.  We tasted several wines and opted to have a few glasses of each.  Great service and comfortable surrounding-we were both anxious to return.  Last night was the opposite.  Our waitress lacked warmth and personality.  The grilled cheese seriously lacked cheese of any kind.  Everytime the door opened we all froze.  The tall man with the pad - not sure if he is the owner - should find another line of business.  If you can sit at the bar - go.  If you can't, find someplace else.",0.9561,0.799,0.16,0.041,0.5706349206349206
2012-02-03,2.0,"(Long review, but worth the read) Maybe it's because this place is brand new... I thought it'd be fun to try out a new spot last night with my girlfriends.  Flight 1551 was packed, and looked like a happening place!! Little did I know, we were about to get the worst service ever by none other than the OWNER. My friend went in to put our name down while I parked.  She asked for a table for 3 and was told it would take 30 minutes.  That's cool... we can wait.  While she waited for me to park, she went outside to grab a phone call.  When she walked in, the owner, who greeted her the first time, asked ""how many in your party?""  My friend told him she already told him a table for 3, and he said ""oh ya, that's right! don't worry, I got you.""  Apparently, this happened twice. While we waited for our table, we hung out in the back by a ledge.  There were someone else's used wine glasses with tip money underneath.  In the 30 minutes that we stood there, no one came to clean up the mess, take the money, or take our drink order!  We talked to the owner again about our table and he told us we were 3rd in line to be seated.  We asked about ordering drinks while we waited and he said, yeah just ask a waitress and order at the bar... after having a few encounters with us, why didn't he just take our order? or try to be a little more friendly/accommodating?  We started to realize our table was going to take much longer to get, so we politely asked the owner... what a realistic wait time would be from that point.  And he basically told us that ""you can't predict the time it takes for a table to open up.  You can't just ask customers to get up.  It's an educated guess, and unfortunately it won't always be an accurate guess.""  He proceeded to lecture us for a couple more minutes about the restaurant business, and that's when we all decided to just leave.  I'd be surprised if this guy owns any other wine bars or restaurants in Chicago.  It didn't look like he knew what he was doing, he lacked the necessary social skills to keep waiting customers enticed or happy to wait, and the entire restaurant staff was in a state of chaos.  If anything, it's the restaurant's first busy night (which is a good thing for them) and he should have been getting his hands dirty serving tables, getting drinks, doing SOMETHING.     Maybe I'll wait a couple months and try to go again on a random Tues night, but I wont bother to wait at some random wine bar on a Thurs, Fri, or Sat when there are many other coveted restaurants in Chicago that are well worth my time.   We ended up across the street, seated in less than 2 minutes, full on food and drunk with wine with the best service ever.",0.9864,0.84,0.109,0.051,0.44358390452140456
2012-02-02,3.0,"This place was sort of average. We had no problem getting a couple of seats at the bar, though it was the right kind of packed, with some nice bustling. The bartender was very nice and provided a suggestion for a glass of red wine we both greatly enjoyed (the cesanese from Spain).  The trout brandade was not all that (I prefer the brandade at Avec). The green salad with shaved egg on top was yummy and a healthy portion. And then the grilled cheese flight: If you're into a little greasy goodness, this might be your place! I enjoyed it, although when my friend got to her last little sandwich, it was cheese-less :(. Così è la vita! So overall, I think this place is fine, good date night place and worth coming back to.
