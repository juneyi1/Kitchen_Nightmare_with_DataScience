2015-02-01,5.0,"This is one of my first encounter with menu tasting and I was probably here 2 years ago. The 9 course meal was unforgettable because it was creative and delicious. The tasting  menu changes every months or few weeks. I always wanted to try certain entree or appetizer that was recommended in Yelp but it's seasonal. Highlight: The seared duck was made just right.  milk creme brulee in the egg shell - nice presentation and the custard was creamy Washugy beef tataki mushroom soup - soo flavorful with the different variety of mushroom Pork belly bun - so tender and half lean/fat with steam bun Overall, i had a good experience when I first had the tasting menu. However, after takashi announced that he would be closing the restaurant. The tasting menu wasn't as appealing and the overall food and presentation was just mediocre, Not sure if it was just lack of motivation vs the change in season?

I had certain expectations with friends recommending this place to watching him on top chef masters. I knew that it would be flavorful and minimal, beautiful presentation.  It seemed obvious to do the chef tasting menu. The presentation was beautiful but the taste lacked in some of the dishes. The gnocchi in the beef broth very similar to udon noodles weren't very memorable but had the flavor I was anticipating. The meat course was too rare and was impossible to cut and the only highlight was the butternut squash on the plate.  My favborite was the creme brulee egg and pistacio macaroon. It was delicious and presented so delicately.  The restaurant looked like a house converted into a restaurant so had a very intimate. But since the space and ceilings were lower, you can hear everyones conversations which took a bit away from the experience.

2014-12-18,5.0,"Of all of the 1-Michelin-starred restaurants in Chicago that I've been to, Takashi is by far my favorite. (For context, that puts it ahead of Acadia, Longman & Eagle, Mexique, and North Pond in my book). I've been to Takashi on two occasions and been very pleased both times. My parents and sister were in town several months ago, so I brought them here for one of our first family dinners in a long time. I remember parking being reasonably easy to find - may have had to do a U-turn or two but all's well that ends well. We were seated on time for our reservation and service was friendly. One of my favorite things about Takashi is actually the ambiance - it feels like the first floor of someone's house rather than a stuffy, fancy schmancy restaurant, which is just as suited for a birthday dinner or family outing as it would be for a date night. We ordered a wide variety of the appetizers and entrees - between the four of us, we had the tuna tataki, the shrimp ceviche, the scallop/gnocchi dish, and probably some others that I can't remember now, along with the steak/short rib entree, the pork loin two ways, and a fish dish of some sort (it's not on their menu anymore, so I can't remember exactly what it was!). The short ribs were SO GOOD - one of the best renditions of short rib I've had at any restaurant ever. I also loved the ceviche and the gnocchi - everything tasted fresh and perfectly cooked. The second time I went was for their Sunday noodles, where I had the ramen and my boyfriend had the soba. We also ordered the pork belly buns and fried chicken - perhaps more pedestrian items, but executed exceedingly well. All in all, I'm so bummed that Takashi will be closing at the end of the year. I'll be back one more time with a friend who's never been, though, and we're looking at the tasting menu as a last hurrah - wishing the chef the best of luck with his next endeavor, but we are sure this restaurant will be sorely missed.",0.9975,0.801,0.192,0.007,0.4881226053639847

Our server was incredibly attentive without being annoying and I really enjoyed the overall experience, especially for a quiet date night.",0.9952,0.758,0.211,0.031,0.5349496709252806
2014-12-05,4.0,"I purchased the 9 course tasting menu for two via the groupon deal and I was so glad I did, especially now that this place is closing. My friend and I had a once in a lifetime experience. I didn't love all of the courses, but not because they weren't perfectly executed, they just were not to my taste. I'm not a big foodie and I will always opt for a burger rather than a bite of exotic flavors, so this was a huge leap of faith in Takashi and his Top Chef glory for me to take. Also, the space is unique for a ""fancy"" restaurant. It doesn't fit many people and is almost like a redone house. But better to serve less food and do it right. The service was excellent and our waiters explained each dish, although I didn't hear or understand everything. The tables are spaced close together, but not so close that we felt like everyone could hear our conversation, yet close enough that we made friends with the next table over how much food we were given. So to begin, we were offered either sesame, multigrain, or baguette with butter. I chose the sesame and ate both pieces, even though I shouldn't have given all the courses up ahead. 1. tofu. Not my favorite, but it was fresh and silky and flavorful. 2. sashimi. Not cold, like I thought it would be. Came out room temperature. The prosciutto really added to this dish, giving it a nice saltiness without being overpowering. 3. crudo. The octopus was my favorite part of this dish. It was really well prepared and the sauce had a nice smoky flavor to it. 4. soup. One of my favorite dishes. We both couldn't stop eating it and finished the bowl. I don't even know what I liked about it- I just did. It was smooth and flavorful. 5. scallop. Yum. Perfectly seared scallop with gnocchi in a creamy sauce. The foam on top was a nice touch. 6. pork belly. Already our bellies were bursting, but I love steamed buns so much that I ate both deconstructed and reconstructed sandwiches. 7. chicken. It is served really hot in a little clay pot. By this time, we really couldn't eat another ounce. I tried the chicken and the green beans and enjoyed the flavor, but I gave my friend the dish and she took both home for lunch the next day. I don't like leftovers, so that's why I gave mine away. 8. panna cotta. We didn't eat the chicken, but we still had room for dessert. I always have room for dessert. I didn't love the pickled cherries and ate the sesame chips on their own, after I gobbled up the panna cotta. 9. egg and macaron. We had room for two desserts. Especially because the creme brulee served magically in an egg shell was the best thing I've ever tasted. The pistachio macaron was also a delight and I ate my friend's as well because she's not a fan of macarons. Bellies bursting, we left. Thank you Takashi and we are sad to see you go.",0.9983,0.758,0.2,0.042,0.6520476190476191

I opted for cocktails vice wine pairings and this turned out be a bit of a tactical error since the server was slightly inattentive in that regard.  Our drinks were finished by the end of the third course where we asked to see the drink menu again, we didn't get the drink menus again until after the fourth course and then he pretty much never bothered to take a drink order. The food was excellent.  Highlights were definitely the pork belly buns.  It was cooked perfectly so that the meat was tender and pretty much dissolved in your mouth but still didn't taste like overcooked mush.  The duck two ways was also amazing.",0.9957,0.721,0.246,0.033,0.6856060606060607

Shoyu ramen had great noodles and broth but i disliked the celery and there was not enough broth. Matcha cheesecake was seriously crappy- cheesecake was like a flavorless block of gelatin served with flavorless flat red beans.  All together we were happy that it wasn't expensive but it wasn't that great either. I wonder if their regular weekday cooking is better and has more finesse?

2014-09-27,5.0,"My husband and I like to really treat ourselves for special occasions, like the anniversary and birthdays. We try to find some place in Chicago that we haven't been to, but have always wanted to try, which usually involves a particular chef we are interested in. My husband's birthday was approaching fast the first week of September, but we couldn't think of anywhere to go. Then, Top Chef Duels comes on. Being huge fans of Takashi Yagihashi, we were surprised we never thought of Takashi when planning. Half way into the episode, we had reservations for Friday. As we arrived on Friday the 5th for our 7:30pm reservation, we entered the restaurant super excited for the meal ahead. We were greeted by the hostess, who seemed incredibly flustered. She let us know that she didn't have a table for us yet, but that several tables had their checks, or at least their dessert. She said it wouldn't be longer than 10-15 minutes, and that she would call our cell phone when the table opened. She recommended a bar across the street, as their bar (which only has four seats) was full. We decided to just wait outside though, as 10-15 minutes didn't sound like a lot of time to grab a drink. We are both former industry, so we are understanding of these things. Sadly, it took 45 minutes for them to finally seat us, even though we had reservations. I could tell the hostess didn't like that I was checking in every 15 minutes to see if our table had opened up, but it was frustrating, especially since it was a rainy day. We had actually decided we were going home at the 45 minute mark right as our phone started to ring. The hostess, still clearly flustered, did not apologize for the long wait. To be honest, as we sat down, we were really disappointed. We sort of felt like even if everything else was great, it was likely just going to be a three star experience at best. Then the food came... We had decided against the tasting menu, and decided instead to pick our own cocktails and wine, and to just get two cold plates, two hot plates, and two main plates, so there was a great variety. Dish after dish was perfection. Such a mastery of flavor combinations, that every dish had a perfect bite that would just blow your mind. In fact, I'm pretty sure the Ginger Soy Pork Belly might be the best thing Ive ever tasted. I could eat it every day. By the time the Chocolate Sticky Cake came out, with a giant Happy Birthday on it, we had no memory of what happened earlier. The amazing food was so good, it didn't matter. The night ended though with something I wasn't expecting. At the end of the dessert, Takashi himself made a point to come out and ask how our meal was. How amazing is that? Not only does he work in his restaurant every night, but to come out to the table to check with guests, that's amazing.

2014-08-24,2.0,"Down to two stars. Since my last ""review"" i had gone to Takashi two or three more times for dinner and brunch. Each time felt it's getting worse. Today:  food for the most part, nothing to write home about. Service. Excellent. Certainly had improved over the last couple of times. Value: zilch.  I still give it the benefit of doubt, with two stars since my son said he was ok with the food, but told me i'd probably give it a 2 out of 10....and he was right. As happy as I am a restaurant in our neighborhood has gotten a michelin star, i have no idea how it could have happened. I mean, who in their right mind would put Takashi at the same level as Blackbird, and Longman & Eagle let alone the likes of Schwa, Elizabeth, and Moto.

2014-08-22,5.0,"Thanks to my visiting mom-in-law, coupled with my wife's regained health, five months later we were able to have a celebratory dinner for our newborn son, whom we named Takashi - a family name unrelated to the restaurant/chef. However, what better place to celebrate the arrival of our Takashi than Takashi? We did the Omakase dinner and wow. I'm a pretty simple guy, certainly no foodie or connoisseur, but my rube-self was duly impressed. I'd never experienced such a perfectly-portioned, subtly tasteful, and well-balanced multiple course dinner. It was pricey, but nothing compared to the pain my wife had to endure during, prior to, and after childbirth.  Afterward, I told our server, Jake, the story of how we came to dine there that evening. He then offered to bring the chef out for a photo . . . Takashi Yagihashi himself! It was an incredible gesture and an honor to cap our celebration. Mr. Yagihashi is a true artist and class act. Jake reflected this artistry in his serving, and so we insisted he take the photo with us despite a measured hesitance in the company of his boss. It was, in all, a wonderful experience and well worth it. Ogochisousama deshita!",0.98,0.805,0.167,0.028,0.5446428571428572

I knew nothing about the restaurant before we arrived and assumed, by the name, that is was some kind asian-fusion something or other, which is certainly just fine by me.  However, I was delighted to see influences of other cooking traditions, particularly French food (which I love). The courses were all delicious, with my two favorite probably being the beef tartare and the duck.  Everything, though, was absolutely delicious, and we were both so full by the end that we couldn't finish the desserts (and both of us had not eaten all day), so if you do the tasting menu, it's definitely enough to satiate you.   Nice ambiance, although like all Chicago restaurants, the tables are close together.  Of course, we were seated next to one of the most awkward first dates I've ever seen.  I don't know if that adds or detracts from our experience (seriously - 20 minute conversation on various naps that concluded with ""sometimes I'll just take a nap at my computer while working.""  Cheers to THAT!).  It looked to have a nice wine list, but I am not a wine drinker, so I was disappointed with the beer list.  Oh well.  The craft cocktails were lovely, though.  Wait staff was attentive and very nice - they just spoke very quietly so we couldn't really hear what any of the dishes were.  That's okay though, because they were all really good.  While not an issue for us, they do check before you order to see if there are any dietary restrictions, which I always appreciate (even though it doesn't matter for me because I will eat all the things).   Based upon my experience, I would definitely recommend this place to friends - a nice splurge meal without the pretension of restaurants with similar concept.",0.9942,0.803,0.178,0.02,0.6107804232804233

It was a small tartine with caviar and a cream that I actually do not remember. Just delicious! Then, we had  a couple of courses of Row fish. We had row tune, octopus and scallops. They were all marinated at perfection. We loved it.  The dish that captured my attention was scallops with onion foam and chantarelle mashrooms. I think that for some seconds I felt like in a paradise... so good!!!  Then, we had seared duck. To be honest, this was definitely not my favorite. The duck was marinated in something that was too strong and covered all the other flavors.  The gran finale were the deserts. The first was a panna cotta. I am a picky italian and, believe me, this panna cotta was amazing!! The second desert was  a signature dish that is always on the menu. It is so good. It is a creme brule' in a egg shell and a delicious macaroon. Both of them just amazing. The only pity is that we were too full that we could not enjoy the desert 100%.  The service was perfect, efficient and careful. I do not like when the waiter comes to the table too often. Our waiter would exactly know when it was the right time to show up.

2014-07-01,5.0,"Cost:  Prix Fixe 9 Course Meal  - Regular Price: $109  - I Paid: ~$80 (bought Groupon  -- $45 tip 20% of $109 +  taxes) 1. Amuse Bouche -- Fried Oyster + Cabbage  If you like oysters, this is your dish. Absolutely delicious. The oyster is fresh and didn't have the stink that some times come with oysters. Crunchy on the outside and the softness of the oyster on the inside. The oyster itself is rather big. I'm assuming multiple oysters in this dish?  2. Crudo of Octopus, Hamachi + Squids  Tobanjan Vinaigrette  One of my favorite dishes during this 9 course meal. Refreshing and very much a summer dish. The octopus is chewy and our version also included hamachi sashimi.The entire dish is a play of sour balanced by spice from the Korean chili power. It also includes Japanese cucumber and tomatoes then topped by some fish flakes. This was all beautifully presented (see pictures!)  3. Yuke of Rib Eye Beef  Garlic Chips Raw Quail Egg, Asian Pear, Pine Nuts, Sesame  I personally don't like the thought of eating raw meet. This is a beef tartare with a raw quail egg on top. There is also a sesame rice chip included, and a side of pickled vegetables. I've never had pickled Daikon like this before. I would buy a huge jar of this!  4. Spring Pea Soup  Sauteed Frog Legs, Spring Onion Flan, Bacon, Upland Cress Leaves  The spring pea soup was really refreshing and once again beautifully presented. The bacon tasted like ham. The spring pea soup sounds like something so simple, but it was incredibly delicious. I don't think we came across frog legs (for those of y'all who are nervous)! 5. Sauteed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi Trumpet Royale, Celery Root-Parmesan Foam Hands down the best dish of the night! The scallop was perfectly cooked and looked like it was pan seared. The gnocchi melted in your mouth with a hint of parmesan from the sauce. You can also find some mushroom and seafood such as clams in this dish.  6. Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly  Pickled Daikon Salad, Steamed Buns This is essentially an Asian version of pork belly sandwiches. It comes with steamed buns (so soft and tasty) that is used to sandwich the pork belly and the salad/green vegetables. This also comes with a spicy mustard that tastes like wasabi.  7. Lacquered Duck Breast Potato-Celery Root Pancake, Compote of Cheery, White Asparagus and Shimeji Mushroom Wasn't a big fan of this dish. Thought the duck was too sweet. This was our main course.    8. Coconut-Ginger Panna Cotta with Sesame Brittle There's a layer of jello on top of the coconut panna cotta. The layer of jello was sour coupled by the sweet panna cotta. The kumquat was also sour and added a punch to this sweet dessert. The sesame caramel brittle was unexpectedly delicious. A very interesting combination.   9. The Egg and Pistachio Macaron  Milk Chocolate Creme Brulee in Brown Egg, Carmel Custard Foam  Pistachio macaron is amazing! This is the only pistachio macaron I've ever had that actually tasted like pistachio. The carmel sauce adds an extra kick. The creme brulee came in an egg shell with chocolate cream on the bottom and sprinkled with salt. It's a great balance of sweet and salty, and this dessert is worth coming back for.

The Mugifugi Pork Loin Two-Way was also good, but not impressive. The pork tonkatsu and mini salad in the middle were very similar to a cheaper Japanese restaurant I'm used to ordering out from.

I guess the last japanese x french restaurant I had was keiko a nob hill in San Francisco and I really loved that place. Takashi just didn't bring out anything that special EXCEPT THAT DESSERT EGG.

It wasn't just any ordinary egg. They took out the inside and layered in ice cream? and other things.. it was the best egg I had in my life. I didn't want to give takashi 2 stars just because of that egg. In fact the egg gets 5.5 stars. it was amazing!  bottom line, I feel like the omakase did not showcase the chef's best dishes.

My SO and I were on a date in the Wicker Park area the other day and we were really full from our lunch so we just wanted some small plates for dinner. Some of our friends has gone to Takashi before and really liked it so we decided to give it a try. We were seated immediately without reservation but it was at the bar. However, we became very good friends with the bartender and overall the experience was so amazing that I'd much prefer the bar counter over their table seats. We also got to meet Takashi himself! Anyways, we had the Yuke of Rib Eye Beef, Big Eye Tuna Tataki, Seared Quebec Foie Gras and Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi. We unfortunately did not have any entrees but I would definitely want to try them next time I go. The Yuke (raw beef) was executed very beautifully with rice crackers on one side, yuke in the middle and pickled vegetables on the other side. The yuke itself was very delicately flavored. If you like eating raw stuff, you should definitely try it. The tataki was great but I thought the hot peppers were unneeded. They had shiso leaves with the tataki though, which is very hard to obtain in Chicago. The foie gras is sweet and went well with wine. The Soba Gnocchi, as advertised on yelp, was flawless. The foamy cheese... aahh! The best of all though, was their alcoholic beverage selection. I don't even know where to start. We started off with some glasses of white wine, which were decent and matched well with our choice of plates. Then we tried the Shiso-jito, Mito Green, and Osaka Berry cocktails. The shiso-jito, by far, is my favorite. It is mojito made out of shiso leaves instead of mint, and shochu instead of rum. The shochu is also infused with a ton of shisho (they actually showed us the bottle) and it tasted amazing. It's hard to find something like this anywhere else in the world. If you've ever had the Japanese liquor umeshu, it tasted a little like that but without the sticky sugariness. The Mito Green had an awesome kick to it because it contains Wasabi that you can taste after every sip. It would start off really sweet, then you'd taste the refreshing cucumber, and at the end there is the bang of wasabi. Super interesting. My SO had the Osaka Berry, and he said the ginger beer was an interesting ingredient that was in it. At the end of the meal, we also had Valrhona Milk Chocolate Sticky Cake and The Egg and Pistachio Macaron. The latter's portion was ridiculously small but it was so good. Definitely try it but order more than one dessert if you do! I literally cannot get over how amazing the cocktails tasted here, and the food was excellent too. I would highly recommend this place to everyone.

Next course was Yuke of ribeye (steak tartare).  Very well prepared but my complaint with steak tartare in general is that it is surprisingly bland, and although perfectly prepared it wasn't earth shattering. Third dish was seared maine scallops and gnocchi.  The scallops were perfect and the gnocchi quite interesting.   Then we had the soy ginger pork belly.  This was a fantastic preparation of pork belly and one of the most memorable dishes of the evening. Final entree was lacquered duck breast, and this is where they lost 1/2 a star.  Although the duck breast was an ample portion and prepared well, it took over 30 minutes to be served from the previous dish (otherwise, spacing was perfect).  My guess is there was a problem in the kitchen because it was such an anomaly but if there was a problem the server should of said something.  The delay between courses is probably my strongest memory of the meal, unfortunately, though as I said the duck was good. Takashi earned back its fifth star with two great dessert courses, and I am not a dessert guy.  The highlight was a creme brulee served in a brown egg shell but both dessert courses great.

The ambiance is nice and intimate. The service was great and the spacing between plates was almost perfect. They also catered to my girl who doesn't eat beef and is lactose intolerant. They gave her a separate salad course and a separate dessert course and I'm always grateful for places that do this because I know of the stress that this causes. All of the food was tasty! I didn't have any issues with any of the food and even saw a few new ingredients that I haven't come into contact with yet. On the flipside.... At $250 this was very overpriced. Also... The usage of ingredients overall through the entire 9 courses was lacking. We saw arugula four times. Not good for such a big name like Takashi. Might go back only to try his house made ramen...

I've never personally understood the appeal of foam on food, but I appreciate them trying to do something a little different. Their skatewing was nicely prepared, but again no ""wow"" factor for me.

2014-02-19,1.0,I made a reservation to takashi about a month in advance for a tues night for the omakase tasting menu. It was an anniversary dinner and we were coming from the suburbs so it was a commitment to go into the city on a weekday. THEY WERE CLOSED. apparently they changed their hours to not be open on tuesdays and they didnt let anyone know. I checked it said they were open on yelp and i could still make a reservation on opentable for that day. They never called and we had no idea what was going on. I called and left a message on their answering machine and they didnt have the decency to call back and apologize. The one star review is for customer service. How can they do that? I have been here before and although the food is good it is not worth that slap in a face. I am still waiting for my apology.,0.4685,0.91,0.055,0.035,0.26875
2014-02-18,5.0,"My expectations were not especially high given previous Valentines dinner experiences but I'm happy to report that this was a wonderful dinner - food, service, ambience - the whole experience was top notch. Hubby had received a gift certificate from some of his employees so this seems like a good occasion to use it. Unfortunately, I did not make the reservation until a week prior to valentines day and our only options were either 5:00 pm or 10:00 pm on Saturday.  We opted for the earlier dining time and arrived just prior to opening. We had driven by this location many times, but it would be easy to miss this cute little house with the unassuming sign, giving no indication of the culinary delights that await inside. We did see Chef Takashi getting ready to take the reins in the kitchen which was a reassuring start to our evening.  The gracious hostess took our coats and led us upstairs to our table right away. There are 2 levels in this restaurant, I would estimate no more than a dozen tables on each level. I was glad we were seated upstairs as it was  much cozier with comfy banquettes and candles on the tables.  Our server Jake immediately greeted us and gave us the option of the soecial valentines menu ($90 pp) or ala carte from the regular menu. As there were several items I didn't care for on the special menu (which required both parties to order) we opted to try some of the dishes that others had recommended here on yelp.  But first- drinks. Takashi has a small but excellent cocktail menu - we tried most of them. I'm a sucker for any drink with St. Germaine so I started with La Poire - a very strong and delicious pear martini and hubby had the fire starter a smoky concoction featuring scotch. We ordered our first dish from the cold plates section - the octopus crudo which was perfectly cooked and served with a luscious sesame based sauce. I was surprised - and pleased - to be offered choices from a bread basket - we loved the sesame and multi grain breads (don't know if they are house made). We then had two excellent small plates - the pork belly buns and the soba gnocchi with mushrooms. Both had a great depth of flavor and were amazing.  For our mains, I had the duck breast and hubby enjoyed the monkfish tail with risotto. Again, an expert hand was in evidence in the flavors, plating and presentation of the dishes. We also availed ourselves of more cocktails - a refreshing  St. Germain / cava concoction.  Dessert was as good as anything I've has at Hot Chocolate. We had the apple cider doughnuts and the macaron and creme brûlée in egg.  Service throughout our meal was exemplary. We  never felt rushed (which isn't always the case on holidays) and were able to relax and enjoy a romantic, incredibly delicious fine dining experience. The low level of noise in this restaurant is worth noting - it certainly added to the overall enjoyment.  I highly recommend this for any special occasion - or anytime you really want to treat yourself and someone special!!",0.9994,0.691,0.272,0.037,0.5892225274725273

We made it our mission to only leave his couch for delicious food.  I'd discovered Takashi on Yelp and was pleased to see that for a Michelin-starred establishment, the prices were reasonable. We arrived on a Friday evening with a reservation, and were surprised that this charming little house was completely empty. The hostess asked to check our coats and waited patiently as I removed layer upon layer of coats, mittens, scarf, and ear muffs. The atmosphere was so homey and inviting that I almost took off my boots, too.  It's quite awkward being the only diners, with the waitstaff ready to respond at your beck and call. Halfway through our meal, a few ladies came in on their girls' night out. YES- take some attention away from.....nevermind. They were seated upstairs, away from us, and we were alone again. As a couple, my bf and I typically crack very  inappropriate jokes, and I'd be mortified if anyone overheard. We resorted to communicating in Chinese, which was pretty limiting.  You're probably wondering about the food. Well, I'm not that excited to talk about it.  Pork belly buns- good, but no better than you'd get anywhere else.  Soba gnocchi and scallops- my fave dish of the night, given the interesting texture of the gnocchi and the indulgent cream sauce.  Skatewing- good portion, but nothing spectacular.  Varlhona milk chocolate sticky cake- this is where we messed up. Our waiter said the creme brulee egg is the best dessert in the city, but not great for sharing, as it's only a couple bites. We decided to go with the sticky cake with caramelized bananas, drunken raisin puree, and graham cracker ice cream. On paper, these elements sound like a match made in heaven. In reality (and in my mouth), they just didn't make sense.  Not sure I fully understand the Michelin star. I'd maybe check out his ramen joint, Slurping Turtle, because of the fun name.",0.9885,0.795,0.148,0.057,0.6281144781144781

To say we were excited is quite an understatement. I was blown away by the adorable house transformed to an elegant restaurant. It felt like Chef was welcoming us into his own home. It took awhile to get service after being seated, but our server politely apologized for the lapse. We each got a ""medium"" hot plate and an entree, plus dessert and a lovely bottle of pinot. The pros- the beau loved the soy ginger pork belly. I thought the open faced sandwich concept was whimsical. The bread was sweet goodness- i was jealous the bread we got with the meal was not as delish! The vinaigrette on the daikon salad needs to be bottled to take home! Might be the best dressing I've had in my life. Scallops were a delight- not rubbery, not overdone, just perfect. Both our deserts tasted like heavenly bliss. The egg- I was intimidated to eat out of an egg, but couldn't keep my spoon out of the yummy fluff. His sticky cake was large enough to feed four, and simply wonderful.  The minus (which kind of put a damper on the whole meal)- proteins that sat under the heat lamp way too long, causing them to be way overdone and dry.  It's the only explanation as to why a wonderful meal had two major failures- main course proteins. The beau (or I) could not eat parts of his duck, as they were way too tough to chew without breaking a tooth. I'm not sure my dog would of been able to gnaw some of these slices. My skate wing was also reminisce of an overdone chicken breast- no flavor and dry. Very underhwelmed with main course.  I might be back in the future, because the majority of the plates were at Michelin star calliber.

For hot plates we chose three to share.  First we had scallops with soba gnocchi - the sauce was so rich and complex... I love the mushrooms in the dish as well.  Then another delicious favorite - Soy Ginger Pork Belly... so delicious... served with hot wasabi mustard on a steamed bun like an open face sandwich...  It may have been my favorite dish.   Our third hot plate was the Fois Gras - it was a sweet dish... I'd seriously consider getting it in the future as a desert. Finally we split one main dish - the skatewing... so buttery and amazing with the capers and pickled cauliflower.  WOW.... We ordered the cider doughnuts for desert and also out came a surprise with a beautiful plate that said ""congratulations"" with an edible (though bitter) flower and cherry sorbet and cocoa chips.  We ended the meal sipping lattes.

2013-12-02,3.0,"My wife and I had dinner at Takashi, where we ordered the 11-course tasting menu. While eating the last dish, soba ice cream with honey, citrus jelly, apple cubes, and red bean paste, my wife bit into something hard.  It turned out to be a piece of clear triangular plastic about 2 cm wide that was cracked with sharp edges. She was lucky that she only had mild tooth ache after biting on the piece of plastic. When we showed the piece of plastic to the waiter, he looked surprised, apologized briefly, thought for a few seconds, and said, it may have come from the jelly container.  He brought the plastic and the spoon back to the kitchen.  A few minutes later, he returned with a new spoon, but did not explain where the plastic had come from.  A few more minutes later, the waiter brought the bill, without further explanation or apology.  The bill was for the full meal: 2x 11-course tastings and drinks. Given that the piece of plastic had the potential to cause more serious injury, and possibly requiring surgical intervention, we had expected more of a gesture from a Michelin starred restaurant to acknowledge this unintentional but serious mistake.  A more thorough explanation of where the piece of plastic came from, an apology from the manager, or a small adjustment to the bill, any of that, as a sorry-we-fed-you-a-piece-of-hard-and-sharp-plastic-and-almost-hurt-you.  None of this happened. As we were about to leave, I mentioned to the waiter that I had expected more of a response from them, and he said something like ""the kitchen took care of it.""  Took care of what?!  Threw the piece of plastic away, removing the evidence forever?  Then he asked, ""What more would you like me to do?"" I shouldn't have to ask them to do anything, that is not my job.  My wife and I left, glad that she didn't get seriously injured, but disappointed that our near-perfect dinner ended on a sour note. In summary, the food was excellent, service was good in general, except for the piece of plastic and how they handled it.  I really wanted to give this 4.5 stars, but not after what happened.

2013-12-02,2.0,"My fiance and I came here for the 7-course dinner ($75/person). Having newly moved from LA, we were eager to try out some fine dining in Chicago. Neither of us are picky eaters or snobby foodies, we just like to enjoy good food. I'm not sure what all the hype is about, from our experience this place is severely overrated at this price point. This place has all the trappings of a good show: dim lighting, accolades mounted on the wall, the usual yuppie crowd, a server who lists a long list of fancy sounding ingredients for even the smallest course. But when it comes down to the food, it was dish after dish of mediocrity. Mediocrity that was indistinguishable from $8 take-out at multiple times, at tiny portion sizes. At this price point, this is unacceptable. I've had much better Japanese food of all stripes at half the price. Here's our course-by-course evaluation of the meal. I've eschewed whatever fancy names the courses came by, since I think only a couple of them were of any quality to merit any fanciness in the labeling. Course 1 (assorted starter): 2/10. The server ratted off a long list of ingredients for what amounted to about two thumbfuls of complete genericism.  Course 2 (sashimi): 7.5/10. The shrimp and fish were fresh and competently executed. However, it wasn't particularly outstanding and is pretty much the same as what you can find at any decent Japanese restaurant. Course 3 (fried assortment trio): 3/10. One third of the trio was indistinguishable from Trader Joe's microwaved shumai. The croquette in the trio was otherwise okay. Course 4 (shabu shabu): 3/10. The broth was too salty. The meat was of questionable quality, although the server insisted it was ribeye. The portions were tiny. Course 5 (salmon): 6/10. The salmon was well cooked and the tobanjan glazing was decent. However, there was way too much of the tobanjan, which overpowered the taste of the otherwise nicely-cooked salmon and nudged the overall taste towards something out of a takeout box. Course 6 (noodles in broth): 3/10. The noodles were soggy and the broth was way too salty. The chicken was tasteless and overcooked. Like another reviewer said, this dish more properly belongs at a mall food court. The only saving grace was this was the only dish that wasn't tiny. Course 7 (coconut panna cotta): 8/10. This dessert was the only outstanding part of the meal. By this time it was too late to salvage the overall experience. RECOMMENDED IF: You're taking someone out on a date and would like to impress with the price tag and the presentation. Or if you're being taken out on a date and are easily impressed with price tag and presentation.

2013-11-04,3.0,"Dining here left me conflicted, some of the dishes were truly delicious, on par with what you expect from a 1 mich star restaurant.  However, other dishes had glaring mistakes with foundational issues that should have never found it's way into a restaurant at this level, ESPECIALLY with Mr. Yagihashi actually manning the kitchen that night. The cocktails were well executed and balanced, I opted for the Campire (Smoked scotch, brandy, maple syrup, orange juice).  Nice smokey maple flavors with the orange juice providing a nice touch of acid to lighten it up, really delicious. My wife opted for the St Germaine (Flour liquor, cava, soda), tasted great, simple but no problems here. There were differences in menu posted on the site and what was received for our 11 courses.  I am not suggesting that because of the 2 for 1 groupon we purchased we received lesser ingredients but it is interesting to note that the sea urchin dish has been replaced with a tofu dish.  Yes menus always change so I won't read too much into it. Course 1 - 9/10 - Chilled tofu, seaweed, natto.  A good start, tasty light dish, one of the better dishes even though it's simple. Course 2 - 10/10 - Crudo of baby octopus, hokkaido scallop, maine cuttle fish.  The seafood was immaculately fresh and sauce was a good balance of spiciness and flavor, complimented the other ingredients perfectly. Course 3 - 9/10 - Tuna (forgot which kind), alaskan spot prawn, mackerel.  Again, very fresh.  The mackerel was seasoned but I don't remember with what, however it all tasted delicious. Course 4 - 10/10 - I don't remember what fish this was but the broth had depths of flavors and the fish was really fresh (surprise?).  One of the best dishes. Course 5 - 5/10 - Age-mono bad hairday of prawn, kani croquette, chicken age-shumai.  The crab croquette was good but slightly salty.  The prawn I liked for the creativity but not much different than a tempura shrimp.  The chicken shumai was way over salted.  All were fried well but the intense saltiness of the shumai caused the dish to be forgettable. Course 6 - 7/10 - Scottish salmon with tobanjan, seaweed and pickled radish.  The salmon was cooked perfectly and tasted amazingly fresh, I felt however the tobanjan was used too generously and really overpowered the simple and delicious natural flavors of the fish.  This would be perfect if the tobanjan was used more lightly. Course 7 - 6/10 - This was another soup, not especially memorable but simple and refreshing. Course 8 - 1/10 - Shabu shabu beef, soft tofu, some veggies (forgot which).  This was by far the worst dish, not sure what cut of beef was used but I don't think it was ribeye.  It was way overcooked and had no fat to help bring back some of the tenderness.  The sauce/soup was also intensely sweet AND way salty.  A very amatuer dish, not sure why they didn't use a fattier cut if they plan to cook it long inside the ceramic pot OR why not put the beef in right before it's served?  The residue heat from the pot should have been more than enough to cook the thin slices while not overcooking and preserving some tenderness.  Critical mistakes in seasoning and preparation, very disappointing dish. Course 9 - Kenchin inaniwa udon (Amish Chicken, Gobo, Yam Cake) - 2/10 - The second worst dish of the night.  The chicken was way over cooked and very rough, the broth was slightly too salty.  The rest of the ingredients left much to be desired, one would expect a bowl of chicken noodle soup at a food court of this caliber, not here. Course 10 - Coconut-ginger panna cotta with Watermelon-Lime Gelee and Sesame Brittle - 10/10 - Eating this after the last dish made me think they should stick to raw fish and desserts because both are done very well here.  All the flavors came together and just right in sweetness. Course 11 - An mitsu (Citrus Ager Ager, Soba Ice Cream, Sweet Red Bean) - 9/10 - Not as good as the last dessert dish but clearly can stand on it's own.  The house made ice cream was delicious.  Maybe I am just nitpicking but why don't places of this level serve their frozen or icy desserts on a frozen plate?  The ice cream portion wasn't big to begin with which is understandable but a warm plate really turns a small scoop of ice cream even smaller. All in all, not a bad meal, there were some serious issues with some of the dishes that really shouldn't have happened, in the end I don't think the good outweighed the bad enough, especially at this price point and restaurant level.  Not sure I would be back.",0.9985,0.761,0.176,0.063,0.5737231815803244

2013-10-28,4.0,"Mum and I came here when I had a groupon. When I walked in, I was a little surprised, the restaurant is a house, with an upstairs and downstairs. Small tables and low light makes it look romantic though. We ate upstairs, and the restroom is covered by a screen that looks like pulled fabric. Nice touch.  Our server was Guatemalan, and try and get him if you can. He made great recommendations through the evening. The only minus point was the timing of the meal, we asked for everything to come to the table one at a time. The first app was followed by 2 apps together, and then a HUGE break for the dinner and another long-ish break for dessert. Not fun. We were the last ones out of the restaurant at 10.30 and we got there at 8.30. Be warned.  I would recommend the Smoky bourbon, the Scallops with gnocci and soba noodles and the verhona chocolate cake. We had the indian duck for our main, and while it was really well made, I found it not super memorable.

2013-10-03,5.0,"Really, really enjoyable: (1) Washugyu Beef Tataki: Very soft and tender beef tataki with fleshy mushrooms, a light citrus-pepper sauce. Overall, a pretty decent dish and quite a good starter. (2) House Smoked Copper River Wild Salmon with Soba Noodles: We thought this was the most amazing dish. First of all, the dish looks gorgeous. Fried river shrimp, the pieces of smoked salmon, the somen noodles--delicious. With some of the wasabi, the soft poached eggs and the soy-dashi, the dish was incredible. Please order this dish--it was really, really enjoyable. (3) Soy-ginger Caramel Pork Belly: Pretty good. The pork belly was really, really carmelized so please use the mustard as it balances the dish, really, really well. With the salad and the meat there's great texture and it was an overall dish. (4) Sauted Maine Scallops And Soba Gnocchi: Most french dish we had. It's really, salty/strong/heavy so be prepared--that said, the gnocchi is soft, the mushrooms are absolutely fleshy and fantastic and the dish just has a very consistent texture and strong theme. (5) Chicken In Clay Pot: Really modest-appearing but delicious dish. Chicken was cooked perfectly and the skin was great, the white meat was just savory and wet enough to not make it boring. The eggplant was done really, really well. The French Green Beans were probably the most unremarkable part of the dish. The neutral taste didn't add much and the crispy/crunchy texture wasn't too additive. That said, the mushrooms, the chicken and the eggplant made the dish really work. (6) The Egg and Pistachio Macaron: Incredible. Brown egg with creme brulee looked spectacular and tasted great. The macaron was just right--not to sugary but enough to taste the soft creamy texture. We arrived around 6 on a Tuesday--restaurant was completely empty. However, it filled up later in the hour. The service was fantastic. The restaurant looks like an old house. Be aware that there is no more ramen here (we were somewhat surprised in the beginning). Overall, great time. Would definitely revisit to try more dishes.",0.9969,0.788,0.198,0.014,0.5463020833333331
2013-09-30,4.0,"Delicious. Expensive. Complimentary.  Takashi lives up to the hype, all.  The occasion was to celebrate a birthday, after being escorted to our seat by the eager and very flamboyant host we were entranced by the menu.  The cocktail list did not disappoint and the server greeted us with drinks and birthday well wishes for my date.   The tasting menu for the evening offered an appetizer, entree and dessert.  I chose pork belly because well... I love me MEAT.  The pickled daikon salad and steamed buns paired well with the perfectly prepared dish.  The second course was a white fish with a sauce that words can't even describe - unfortunately my memory is failing me a month later.  The Sesame Panna Cotta with Genoise Cake and pickled cherries, drizzled with sesame dust atop a scoop of cherry cocoa nib ice cream left us feeling fuller than full.

I have heard such great things about this place but in truth my experience was a bit dissappointing.  Given that everyone raves about this place I suppose I will give it another try to see if it can redeem itself from this visit. For starters we had the summer roll and the escargot & sweetbreads. The Summer roll was BLAND!! The description states mango is present in the roll, in my experience mango is rather flavorful and there was NO flavor present in this roll what-so-ever. Nothing from the ""mango"", or the prawns, or even the coconut kaffir lime sauce that was served on the side. The escargot and sweetbreads were tasty, they had a nice balance of flavor along with a very welcome saltiness. For my entree I ordered the artic cod.....it wasn't bad but also nothing special. There are definitely other places in this city where I have had MUCH better fish entrees.  Perhaps its on me for not ordering their strongest entree but nonetheless I was dissappointed.

2013-08-29,5.0,"The food here is perfect!  The quality and complexity of the dishes stands out from any other fine dining restaurant, which is why Takashi is a Top Chef Master.  To understand what food SHOULD taste like, go here! We Had: Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly - Just like the pork steam buns found in Asian grocery stores, except for the fact this has pork belly.  Wonderful flavor, and a perfectly sized appetizer.  This'll cost $14, which is obviously more than the grocery store, but it's still good if you want your pork stream bun fix. Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi - Oh my god, the gnocchi was so delicate, soft, and amazingly tasty.  Scallops were good too, but the gnocchi was on a whole other level of food heaven.  There was a parmesan foam, but you couldn't really taste it, but that can be said about most foams.  And since this was supposed to be a delicate flavor, it's understandable why the foam was hard to taste.  This dish is $15, and well worth it! Chicken in Clay Pot - Pretty tasty, which is a high standard coming from me, since I don't like the flavor coming from clay pots.  This had chicken, mushrooms, eggplant, and vegetables all cooked perfectly.  Even with my distaste of clay pots, I could eat this and be happy.  $27 for a good chicken dish. Lacquered Indiana Duck Breast - This was WONDERFUL, AMAZING, and one of the BEST DISHES EVER!  Seriously, I'm not kidding.  I DREAM about this dish.  The portion size is plentiful, and I ate it ALL.  Which again, is amazing, considering I can usually only finish half of a dinner plate.  This wasn't a small fine dining portion that other restaurants gave, this one could fill you up easily!  I struggled to finish it all, but the kicker is, I WANTED TO FINISH IT ALL!  I was smiling all the way to the end, and the smile lasted all night long.  The duck is cooked to perfection, and the flavor is the best I've ever had for duck.  The rice and the vegetables compliment the duck perfectly.  You'll be wanting and wishing you could duplicate this at home.  You'll also be pondering why you've never had such an amazing dish ever before in your life.  It's that good.  $31 for perfection.  I'd definitely pay more, but shh :-) it'll be our little secret. Some parts had great service.  I always base my tip on the drink refills, never the taste of the food, and it's a good thing I wasn't paying.  I watched two different guys walk back and forth past my table with a pitcher of water, and neither refilled my water.  I got annoyed enough that when the third guy was passing by, I asked him for a refill before he walked too far away.  The service will definitely give you new silverware after each course, but refilling your water might be an issue. Nevertheless, even with non-water-refilling wait staff, come here for the food.  The food is to die for.  Get the duck and the gnocchi, those are the must try items.",0.9993,0.714,0.251,0.034,0.605123106060606

2013-08-20,5.0,"One of the most affordable Michelin-starred restaurants in Chicago, Takashi is also the most charming and neighborhood-y. My experience did not disappoint. The space, a remodeled 2-flat, is artful and intimate. The service is very friendly and down-to-earth, though somewhat less professional than I expected, but professionality is way overrated anyway.  Now for the food. I'd give 4.5 stars, with the deduction coming from the entrée that my lady and I shared. The food is a playful and creative mix of Japanese and French, a unique mix in the Chicago Michelin scene. The hot and cold (small) plates were much more appealing to us, so we started off with 3 hot plates. They were all fantastic and the portions were great. In order of my less to most favorite: 1. Maine scallops with soba gnocchi and trumpet royale: possibly the most perfectly cooked scallops I've ever had.  2. Caramel pork belly buns with daikon salad and spicy mustard: playful and delicious. My only complaint is that the pork belly could have had some crisp to it. 3. Braised French escargot with crispy veal sweet breads: one of the best dishes I've ever had. The sweet breads were so smooth and flavorful, complimented perfectly by the escargot. Very generous portion. We were feeling pretty full so we had just one entrée (since we needed room for a dessert each). We got the Mugifugi Pork Loin, recommended by both our server and the bartender. It's pork 2 ways, and it was a truly a tale of 2 preparations. One half, the deep-fried pounded cutlet stuffed with brie and pancetta, served with sweet potato fries and aioli, was absolutely phenomenal. If the whole dish had been a huge portion of this, I would have given 5 stars easily. The other half was so much lamer. It was a simple pork loin cooked in ginger and soy with haricots verts, entirely forgettable. We would have gotten the duck, which I've heard mixed things about, but everyone kept raving about the Mugifugi. Does anyone think the 2 preparations are equal?  Dessert was great too. The famous Egg and Pistachio was one of the best things I've ever had, and the Milk Chocolate Sticky Cake was also great, though a bit too sweet (yes, dessert can be too sweet).",0.999,0.728,0.258,0.014,0.5663587848932676

2013-06-22,2.0,"I can't believe this is one of the top restaurants in Chicago. I only found one dish from our meal to be star-worthy, the service was unprofessional, and the food overall was not nearly as good as many non-starred restaurants I've been to in New York. Throughout the meal, I found the service to be lacking.  I had to wait a long time before my glass was filled on multiple occasions, and the server never asked how any of our dishes were.  He interrupted us while we were in the middle of our dessert to ask if we wanted anything else, and he promptly gave us the check when he took away our dessert.  The service felt very rushed towards the end. The bread that started the meal was mediocre at best.  We had all three breads (multigrain, baguette, and sesame); they were not distinctive at all, and some tasted stale. The scallops with soba gnocchi was very rich, and I found the sauce to be on the salty side.  The gnocchi itself was pretty good but dense; if I didn't know, I wouldn't guess that there was soba in it.  The scallops were on the edge seasoning-wise, but were nicely prepared. I found the escargot and veal sweetbreads dish to be neither here not there.  The sweetbreads were fine but not special.  The escargot was not seasoned, and the swiss chard did not have a distinctive flavor.  Overall, this was a forgettable dish. The soy-ginger caramelized pork belly was served DIY style where you make your own pork buns.  The pork belly was quite tender and nicely glazed; the accompanying daikon salad was fine.  The steamed buns were okay; I found the edges to be a bit stale tasting.  The dish was accompanied with a mustard, which our server did not tell us had wasabi in it.  Luckily, i tried a small amount of it on my own and found it to be incredibly potent.  I'm amazed that the server didn't warn us about it.  There is quite a lot on the dish, so I can imagine other diners adding a pea-sized amount to their pork buns and killing their taste buds.  A very, very small amount is all that's needed.   The seared Quebec foie gras was clearly the best dish of the night.  The fruit that accompanied the foie (gooseberries, quince, red currant) was vibrant and flavorful (although we weren't sure why the plate needed 3 different types of fruit).  The foie gras itself was very well prepared and rich. The sautéed barramundi was not a memorable dish.  The green pea flan was probably the best part of the dish but did not have a very strong pea flavor.  The morel mushrooms and fiddle head ferns that accompanied the fish were very oily.  The fish itself was reminiscent of the flavor of a steamed whole-fish you might get at any decent Chinese restaurant.  I thought this dish lacked refinement. The duck breast was better; I found the duck to be a bit chewy but nonetheless, it had a good flavor.  I'm not a fan of smeared brown sauce on a plate, which I think looks quite...vulgar.  The sauce, though, had good flavor.  The asian pancake was too thick and very gummy tasting.  I did enjoy the cherry and blood orange on the plate, which were bright and fresh. We asked our server what the ice creams and sorbets were, and he whipped out a list of 10 different flavors.  I've never been to a fine dining restaurant with so many options, which I'm always suspicious of because it's hard to do quality-control with too many flavors.  We had 3 different flavors: a green apple sorbet, mango sorbet, and green tea ice cream.  The sorbets were a bit icy but otherwise pretty smooth.  The mango sorbet was too sweet; the green apple sorbet was quite nice with a faint tartness; and the green tea ice cream was smooth but not one of the better green tea ice creams we've had. The restaurant itself is cute and comfortable.  Unfortunately, the food was not memorable, and the service was sub-par.",0.9973,0.804,0.144,0.052,0.5441649948967021
2013-06-17,5.0,"Takashi had been on our list for a long time and SO glad we finally made it here! The service was EXCELLENT. Our server was so accommodating to my dietary needs (gluten-free). Eating out is always very challenging and frustrating so it was such a relief to have such a pleasant experience! He let me pick out a few entrée options then checked with the chef to let me know if they could be modified to be gluten-free or if they were naturally gluten-free.  I ended up ordering the Chicken in Clay Pot as my main dish and it was amazing. Juicy flavorful Amish chicken with mushrooms and eggplant. My husband had the Roasted Potato Crusted Scottish Salmon and he claimed it was some of the best salmon he had ever tasted. The best part however was the dessert. Our waiter recommended The Egg and Pistachio Macaron citing it was gluten-free and delicious. SO good. Decadent milk chocolate crème brulee in a hollowed out brown egg with caramel custard foam plus a crispy, flavorful pistachio macaron on the side = HEAVEN.

2013-06-08,4.0,"It was really refreshing to see fusion done well.  Drawing from both Japanese and French cuisine, Takashi creates dishes that built on flavors that complement each other beautifully.  We decided to share all of the dishes, tapas style.  The staff was helpful with any questions we had about the menu and quick to clear dishes after we had finished, in a good way.   For our dinner, we ordered: --Crudo of Baby Octopus, Hokkaido, Scallop, Maine Cuttle Fish-- Probably my favorite of the night.  Each piece was delightfully fresh.  The cuttle fish (if I'm not mistaken) was wrapped with a little mint and a touch of something else that I can't identify, adding a different dimension that really evolved the taste.  The vinaigrette was a fun complement, without being overpowering. --Braised French Escargot and Crispy Veal Sweetbreads-- Definitely try this.  The escargot were cooked perfectly and the sweetbreads were lightly fried.  Rather than crispy on the outside, they were more of a crumbly texture, which I enjoyed.  The dish has a lot of rich flavors, without being overly heavy. --Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi-- As a whole, the table agreed that this was probably one of the best dishes that we ordered.  The scallops were lightly seared on both sides.  The Gnocchi is made with buckwheat, and melted in your mouth.  The dish was very cohesive, the cream sauce rich yet again, not too heavy.  We did share the dishes though, so perhaps ordered on its own, it could have been a bit on the rich side.  --Chicken in Clay Pot-- I really enjoyed this although my dining partners were unimpressed.  The flavors aren't groundbreaking or incredibly complex, and the dish as a whole was a bit on the salty side.  I welcomed the clean flavors.  The stock was incredibly flavorful and the dish is very light.  This was the one dish that we sampled in which I didn't see much fusion, the entire dish being very Japanese.  I liked the dish, but not sure if I would re-order it again. --Lacquered Indiana Duck Breast-- The duck is, rightfully, the highlight of this dish.  The duck was moist and rich without being overwhelming.  However, the rest of the dish was a bit of a disappointment.  The pancake was soft and a little soggy and lacked the slight crispness that one looks for in a good scallion pancake.  The salad was mediocre, a little bit overly citrusy for my tastes.  For a main plate, this was quite a let down.  The two side pieces just were not cohesive with the rest of the dish and detracted from the wonderfully cooked duck. As a whole, I would recommend sticking to the cold and hot plates, which really seem to be Takashi's main attraction.  The hot plates are slightly larger than the cold plates, and the main plates being more of an entree.  It was fun to try all of the different flavors and I really enjoyed the entire meal.  In fact, one of my dining partners declared this to be her favorite meal outside of Chinese cuisine, quite a high compliment coming from her.  I would definitely go back if I'm in the area again.",0.9973,0.82,0.165,0.015,0.5446321321321322

I cannot say enough how impressed I was with the food.  Every course was amazing, but perhaps the standout was the kurobuta sukiyaki.  We both actually drank the sauce off the plate.   I apologized to the server - he said the chef would take it as a compliment.  Although it is not cheap and certainly not an every week price point for me, the price was very fair and even low for food this good.  The service is also excellent - very attentive but not annoying, and the courses were beautifully paced.  I did not feel like I was sitting there for a long time between courses getting full, but I did not feel rushed.   It is also worthy of note that Chef Takashi himself is clearly actually involved in the restaurant.  You can look into the kitchen from the dining room.  It was relatively small, there were only three chefs in there working, and one of them was Chef Takashi.  Seems like a really nice guy - he thanked us on our way out.  I am going to make Takashi a regular stop for a nice meal.",0.997,0.748,0.208,0.044,0.6062617562617563

It was a very fishy dish.  I really enjoyed the homemade tofu,  Pate trio, and pork belly.  We also enjoyed the scallops and gnocchi (although it wasn't my personal favorite).  The salt cod croquettes were fine and so was the tuna tacos. My partner loved the crab in the cold salmon/crab dish. Overall, yes, I enjoy and do recommend Takashi.  The price is very high though, and for the amount of money we spend and prestige involved, I suppose I expect something that flies me to the moon.  Does it blast me out of the atmosphere, for sure, but it also feels at times that it leaves me half way drifting in the universe...",0.9669,0.83,0.17,0.0,0.6146455026455027

2013-05-20,5.0,"I still think Takashi should've won his season of Top Chef Masters! He was so close...anyways, he's a winner in my book. I've had this place bookmarked even before moving to Chicago so I relished the opportunity to try it out when my friend suggested it for dinner.  Takashi's eponymous restaurant is actually a house that has been renovated into a classy Michelin Star eatery. The space is actually pretty small with a handful of tables on the first floor and some more upstairs. There's also seating on the patio, which I recommend if the weather permits. The atmosphere is intimate with dim lights, candles and neutral tones yet still being really comfortable for a restaurant of this caliber.  While they have a regular menu, because we came on Sunday, they were serving their kaiseki menu, which is a multi-course affair with home-style dishes made by Takashi, who can be seen plating away in the kitchen. There are two options 7 courses for $73 or 11 courses for $100 along with optional beverage pairings. I chose to go with 11 courses sans beverage pairing, but opted for a cocktail instead. Kaiseki offerings change regularly based on what's in season, but I was served: COURSE 1 - homemade spring pea tofu, fiddle head ferns and asparagus: One of my favorite courses, which set the bar high for the rest of the meal. The texture of the tofu was comparable to cheesecake as it was silky, thick and creamy. The fiddle head ferns and asparagus provided good contrasting textures to the tofu along with the umami soy sauce, it was a great combination. COURSE 2 - crudo of baby octopus, Hokkaido scallop, Maine cuttle fish with Tobanjan vinaigrette:  The scallop was the highlight of this course - so fresh and sweet; I could've eaten a plate of this stuff! The cuttle fish was wrapped with mint which added another dimension of flavor. I loved the Tobanjan vinaigrette, which was spicy, sweet and so aromatic - Takashi needs to bottle this stuff. COURSE 3 - Otukuri of Hawaiian big eye tuna, Scottish salmon, Alaskan spot prawn with daikon and ogo: The salmon was incredibly buttery and melted in my mouth. A squeeze of lime juice really brightened the taste of the sweet spot prawn. I suggest eating the seafood along with the veggies for some crunch. COURSE 4 - sukiyaki of kurobuta, shungiku, yam noodle, and yaki-tofu: Came sizzling on a metal plate with slices of tender kurobuta pork with ramps, bamboo shoots, yam noodles and blocks of tofu in a savory dashi sauce. Sauce was on point. COURSE 5 - foie gras chiyawan-mushi, prawns, shimeji mushrooms, mitsuba This reminded me of my trip to Japan - it was spot on! The savory egg custard was so light and silky with an incredible umami flavor. The foie gras was so unctuous and rich. It was fun scooping down and getting bits of prawn and mushrooms in each bite. COURSE 6 - age-mono bad hairday of prawn, kani croquette, chicken age-shumai: You really can't go wrong with anything fried. Unlike other reviewers, I didn't find this course to be overly greasy at all. My fav was the croquette which was filled with potato and loads of creamy crab meat - I could've eaten 20 more of those. I found that the shumai was on the verge of being salty.  COURSE 7 - Broiled shio-koji marinated Scottish sea trout ""roch etive,"" pickled daikon, hijiki: Hands down one of the best cooked pieces of fish I've had ever! The fish was so moist and tender. I loved that they broiled the fish which allowed the sauce on the fish to caramelize.   COURSE 8 - Shabu shabu of ribeye beef, ponzu, enoki, mizuna: You're served a plate of slices of raw ribeye beef and veggies along with hot dashi broth served in a paper bowl with a chaffing flame underneath. I enjoyed the interactiveness of this dish. COURSE 9 - Chilled natto soba, fermented soy beans, quail egg: Presentation was so vibrant and striking - I'm a sucker for eggs so I knew I was going to love this when I saw the raw quail egg. Mixing the quail egg into the perfectly cooked soba noodles added a richness that took the dish to another level. COURSE 10 - Miso cheesecake with blood orange ice: Never would have thought to pair miso and cheesecake, but it works! There's a subtle saltiness to it, but caramel sauce offset that. The blood orange ice served as a refreshing palate cleanser after the 9 courses prior. COURSE 11 - An mitsu citrus ager ager, soba ice cream, sweet red bean: This dish was a light end to such an extraordinary meal. The soba ice cream wasn't exactly something you'd find in your typical ice parlor, but it was really good! The pacing of the courses was perfect. Service was top-knotch - the server, Jordan was so knowledgeable about each course and very attentive. Dirty plates and drinks were cleared and filled in a timely manner.  I even got to meet Takashi who's just as funny and friendly as he is on TV! I really can't say enough good things.

2013-05-19,5.0,"This was my first experience of going to a place that was a fine dining experience, even though I am near San Francisco, where they have many places like these.  But I was curious because this place was owned by a Japanese chef and he gave it with a unique twist to his cuisine.  My gf heard this person through one of the show on the Food Network and was excited that he had a resteraunt in Chicago and that it wasn't too far away from where I am going to school at. The restaurant is located in a small area, which is a good thing because it really enhances the dining experience knowing that the chef is all about making quality dishes and not the quantity.  There is a second level, but we were seated in the first floor and was able to catch a glimpse of the chef in action and able to view the kitchen area. I am a big and tall guy, so I felt a little bit uncomfortable when we were seated in the seats where you are fairly close to the next table.  I like being intimate with my gf and have conversations where the other party won't hear us or vice versa.  But I think that's how a lot of these places are like in the Windy City (except for Boka, please check out that review!!) The service was excellent and definitely a 5 for what I've experienced in the past.  It was of course a fine dining restaurant so the prices were pretty on the high end, but they had a very reasonable dinner option where you could taste the chef's recommended or his top dishes that makes us his cuisine/restaurant along with a wine paired to each dishes.  This was quite an experience and was just amazed how each wine (different types of course) complimented with the meal, and it was just an awesome experience!!   Of course before they began with the meal, the server asked if there was any food allergy that they should be aware of and it was great because I am lactose intolerant and this type of service really made me give this place a 5 star.  It was amazing that the chef came up with an alternative solution with my food allergy and was able to create a new dish just like that (snapping the finger)!! It was fantastic and the dessert, which is usually is a cream based, I was treated with 3-4 different flavored sherbert and they tasted like the real fruit!! Once again, this place was truly an amazing dining experience and hope to save up a lot of money to be able to go here once again!  I was very impressed with the chef's take of putting a twist on Japanese food and make it so interesting!  This is a definite place to visit and dine!!

I was very pleased to leave full and sated but not so stuffed you feel sick.   We had a reservation at 8:30 and when we got there it looked like there were no tables but they sat us at a 4 top upstairs that was very secluded and wonderful.  I was impressed they sat us there rather than waiting for a 2 top to open up.  Our server (George I think?) was great.  It seems like they have a team waiting on you we were never without something we needed.  Everyone on the staff was great without the pretentiousness you feel at some restaurants.  Most expensive meal I've had in a while but it really was worth it.  Similar price to night out at a high end steak house but with so much more thought and flavor and artistry in the food.,0.9909,0.759,0.194,0.047,0.5504571428571426

Nothing gelled; flavors were either bland or slightly off, and the many components of the dishes (and each dish had many, many components) never added up to anything more.... just very bizarre for such a well reputed place. We shared a number of small plates -- the beef tataki (meh), crudo (fluke wrapped in all sorts of things. Felt like a generic sushi place trying to dress up mediocre fish), spring onion soup (OK, really, chef, you need to decide what you want to do here. This was a soup with an oily base loaded with cumin and cilantro, ramps, some overcooked prawns, and fiddlehead ferns that must have just fallen in by mistake) scallop gnocchi (the scallops were cooked well, the gnocchi had a weird powdery texture to them), and porkbelly sliders (the one dish we felt was deliberate and worked, but nothing exceptional). The fact that everything except the soup was $15+ definitely surprised me, given the lackluster nature of the flavor combinations. Luckily, we went on a Groupon so the damage was minimal. Decor upstairs is beautiful and feels relaxed. Our server, while very nice, was super abrupt and alarming in his mannerisms. Overall, a big letdown.

I almost licked my plate! If you are going to order one thing off this menu it HAS to be the scallop gnocchi with parmesan foam.  I'm still craving the delicious medley of pasta, scallops, and foam.  Some Blehs: I was not a huge fan of the Beef Tataki that was served with a salad that did not mix well with the tataki.  I ate them separately, but I'm confused why they were on a plate together when they didn't go together... The pork belly slider - yeah, walk to Enso and they're better and cheaper. Why is a high end restaurant serving street fare that is less tasty?   Cocktails: The Mayfair Martini - omg!

2013-05-01,4.0,"Takashi is one of two restaurants by Chef Takashi Yagihashi (who starred in Iron Chef America and Top Chef Masters 2012), the other being Slurping Turtle in River North. It has a humble feel for a Michelin 1 star restaurant, but the small and cozy ambiance adds to the appeal. Although we were seated on the upper level, if you get a chance and weather permitting, do try to get a table on the outdoor patio.  I always question myself if I truly like places where food-is-art and wonder if I am better off just going to a regular upscale steakhouse instead, but the abstractness and inquisitiveness of such places keep bringing me back. Chef Yagihashi does an excellent job of coming up with some unusual yet delicious combinations and the servers explain the story behind every dish with extreme simplicity and lack of pretense that you usually experience at such establishments.  The small plates (both hot and cold) may appear relatively small at first, but do a decent job of filling you up. Between the two of us, we ordered 4 small plates and a dessert along with a few drinks. Beef Tataki - An interesting take on rare seared slices of beef. Refreshing. Salmon & Crab - Great combination, the crab tasted very fresh. Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi - A fairly simple and safe dish if you aren't feeling too adventurous or if you want to match it with some of the more eccentric options. Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly - This dish can be best understood as an open-faced sandwich on a Chinese Bun. Think of it similar to Wow-Bao. The spicy mustard blends very well with the somewhat tame tasting bun.

The campfire cocktail was great-- especially if you enjoy a nice, peaty scotch. I got the poire cocktail, and it is good if you are looking for a dessert cocktail. The restaurant itself is a little small-- not great for groups bigger than four. It's also fairly loud, so I wouldn't recommend it for a first date. We had reservations, so we didn't have to wait for a table, but the wait for food was quite long, so I recommend a snack before (yes, plan on spending a good deal of time there-- I think we were there 2 hours just for 4 small plates).

2013-04-22,4.0,"Japanese options in this city are a little weak.  Despite that, I was pretty psyched to see a Groupon for a 1-star Michelin.  A friend and I dropped in on a Sunday to sample their 11-course Kaiseki offering. We had reservations, but still waited a half hour or so to be seated.  Never fear a short wait when there's a bar!  I had the gin cocktail which was strong and refreshing.  It's a shame they only do Kaiseki Sundays and I live so far from Bucktown...  I think the beverage pairings would've been great. Onto the food.  Yes, I'm going to detail each of the 11 courses.  If you're bored already, I'm not sure why you're still reading: -Black sesame tofu - this was surprising in texture.  Had a melting sensation that wasn't quite silken, but definitely cheese-like.  Tasty. -Crudo of yellowtail - tasty, though I can't say I really figured out what the yellowtail was wrapped around. -Sashimi course - the alaskan spot prawn was amazing.  I did pick out a small piece of the black-line of intestine, but it didn't bother me too much. -Pork belly and unagi sushi - The pork belly was cooked perfectly, meaning the fattiness didn't overwhelm.  The accompanying sushi piece also had great flavor. -Dobin mushi - really delicious chawamushi.  Done extremely well, rivals best I've had. -Crispy Madagascar prawn - tempura course and really, can't go wrong with deep fried and umami soy sauce. -Sea trout - um, this trout was delicious.  This and the trout I had at Boka are probably the best pieces of cooked fish I've had lately. -Shabu Shabu - fun, though honestly, I'm not the biggest shabu shabu fan. -Noodles with duck breast - perfectly cooked duck breast.  Fat was rendered properly and the crispy texture held beautifully in the broth.  A smidge on the salty side, which prevented me from sucking down the broth, but maybe that was the point. -Cheesecake - the cheesecake had a salty flavor, so maybe that's why the drizzle of caramel?  The sorbet was a nice accompaniment. -Red bean soup - I loved this dessert course, but it's definitely designed for an Asian palate.  It's not overly sweet and has Asian jellies, amongst other things in it.  My friend wasn't a big fan, but I thought it was top notch. Overall I thought this was a worthwhile experience.  Not really comparable to Next as I felt they went for different approaches even though both were ""Kaiseki."" The pacing got a little slow in the middle and lasted towards the end, but the portioning was done pretty well. I'd definitely come back to try the regular menu.",0.999,0.703,0.261,0.036,0.526068376068376

2013-04-19,2.0,"Takashi on its own would have been a very pleasant experience last night, but I have to review this based on the price point and how it compares to Chicago restaurants in this same tier.  And as much as I wanted to love our dinner and as much as I was looking forward to our visit, I have to say we left a little bit disappointed. Atmosphere is lovely and cozy and the space resembles a house, similar to the ambiance of Ruxbin.  We were welcomed warmly and even though we arrived quite early, they had no problem accommodating us well before our reservation time. Service was very friendly and attentive and our server was very knowledgeable about items.  We chose to do the 7 course omakase tasting for $73 per person and the chef had no problem making pescetarian friendly items to substitute the meat courses. The quality of the food is second to none, no question.  And the presentation and spacing of the courses were great.  Make no mistake, Takashi makes the effort to provide a first class dining experience.  Here is my dilemma...the courses we had that we enjoyed, we really enjoyed.  And those creations were original and creative.  However, there were multiple courses that we either didn't care for or didn't find especially unique.  And normally that would be fine, but for a restaurant of this reputation and the price that goes with it, I expected to enjoy all 7 courses or at least be amazed by the creativity.  1st Course: Amuse Bouche - last night's amuse bouche was a sampling of their homemade tofu with a citrus soy sauce.  The tofu was perfectly soft and absorbed the flavor of the sauce well.  Great way to start the night. 2nd Course: Yellowtail with Monkfish ""Foie Gras"" - another very tasty course.  Two very fresh pieces of high quality yellowtail wrapped around a monkfish ""foie gras"" with two little sides of eggplant and broccolini.  Again, another great start to the night. 3rd Course: Beef Tataki for my fiance and Soy Marinated Tuna with Crispy Tortilla for me - My fiance described the tataki as good, but nothing amazing.  The preparation was done well, but there was no original flare added to the tataki to distinguish it from any other upper scale sushi restaurant.  My tuna turned out to basically be mini tuna tacos on a bed of cold chick peas with a tomato/onion relish.  Again, the quality was excellent and it tasted great, but it was no different from any other sushi grade tuna tacos I've had. 4th Course: Scallops and Soba Gnocchi - A very interesting presentation on this dish as the scallop came on top of gnocchi with a foam sauce on top.  The sauce was creamy and rich and was more French than our prior dishes that were definitely more Japanese inspired.  The scallop was cooked to perfection, and this dish was tasty but nothing memorable.  The scallop itself needed just a slight bit of seasoning to make it stand apart from the creamy gnocchi, instead it was too bland and blended in. 5th Course: Soy Ginger Caramel Pork Belly for him and a Spring Onion with Tiger Shrimp Soup for me - My fiance thoroughly enjoyed his pork belly and agreed it was everything that was hyped up on yelp.  The soup was most disappointing for me.  It's a new dish that had a lot of potential, but was so overwhelmingly loaded with cumin that all the other ingredients were lost.  The tiger shrimp was again of top quality and cooked to perfection, but the broth was way lop sided on the cumin that I didn't even end up finishing this item. 6th Course: Roasted Duck Breast for him and Seared Fluke for me - both of us were disappointed in our dishes.  The duck breast was tough and chewy (even for duck).  The fluke was an excellent cut of fish, but was bland and barely flavored.   7th Course: The dessert was a chocolate creme brulee in egg with a pistachio macaroon.  We were completely stuffed by the time dessert came around and this was a very pleasantly refreshing and light creation.  This was the type of originality and new combination of tastes that we had hoped to experience in every course as all the flavors blended so perfectly together and the creme brulee was served right out of the chicken eggshell.   Quantity-wise, the 7 course tasting is more than enough food.  The first 5 courses are small tastings, while the 6th course was a larger plate.  You definitely won't leave Takashi still hungry if you do the omakase.  I can't stress how excellent the quality of the food, the service, and the presentation were.  My only complaint is the lack of originality in all the courses and the downright disappointment in some of them.  If you add in a bottle of wine, this is a $200+ dinner for two, and I expected to be a little more blown away by each course.",0.9993,0.734,0.198,0.067,0.5490047662774936

We ordered:  Soy Marinated Tuna With Crispy Tortilla: Well, this was just as described in its title. It was simple, understated and amazingly enjoyable.  Sautéed Maine Scallops And Soba Gnocchi: This was surprisingly great! The scallops were cooked to perfection with a very nice sear on them and the gnocchi was just as you would think Jesus would make it if he were a chef!  Soy-ginger Caramel Pork Belly: Man oh man do I love me some pork belly! Its no good for keeping my belly lean, but it sure did make my belly happy! Again, this was cooked perfectly. I was amazed at how wonderful everything was.  Now, when I was there and the first plate came out, I was a bit disappointed because of the size. I thought how are 2 grown ass adults going to fill up on these tiny servings. Well, I was wrong. They were perfectly proportionate and filling.

2013-04-12,5.0,"We came here for my husband's birthday dinner and were blown away by the food and service. Five stars, for sure! We made reservations for 6:30 on a Wednesday. I didn't think we would need them, but it never hurts. We arrived, and the place was pretty empty. We were seated upstairs in a corner booth. Our waiter was wonderful. He was attentive, knew the menu well, and gave great recommendations. He told us that most people ordered a cold plate each, a hot plate to share, and a main dish of their own. That seemed like a ton of food, so we decided to wing it. We ended up with one cold plate, two hot plates, and one main dish to share. It was more than enough. We started with the Salad of Duck Confit and Prosciutto. Honestly, it was my least favorite dish, and it was still tasty. The quail egg and lentils were a great addition to the salad flavor-wise, and the prosciutto added a hint of saltiness.  We moved on to the Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly and Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi next. The pork belly was served so cleverly - as fixings for an open faced sandwich! The ""bread"" was bao steamed buns, which were great. The pork belly was really tender, and the wasabi-like mustard served with the dish really packed some heat.  Nothing held a candle to the scallops and gnocchi. Holy goodness, I don't know what they put in the creamy sauce, but it was absolutely phenomenal. It definitely wins best of the evening, and just might be my favorite dish ever. The gnocchi were cooked perfectly - not at all overdone - and the scallops were the same way. For our main course, we had the Chicken in Clay Pot. It came with a small chicken breast, green beans, potato, and mushroom. It was good, but I think having just had the gnocchi made this dish not as good as it otherwise would have been. We were pretty full and were going to skip dessert, but when I saw the menu, I knew we had to try the Coconut Financier and Passion Fruit Mousse. Just, wow. The coconut, passionfruit, and cake was just delicious. Even the foam that was served on top was tasty, and it really added a great airy-ness to the dish. As if that wasn't enough, the waiter must have overheard me saying that it was my husband's birthday, as he brought out ANOTHER dessert complete with ""Happy Birthday!"" written out in chocolate.! I let my husband indulge in that one solo, but from the look on his face, I'd say he liked it. It was a pricey meal, but it was worth it, in my opinion. To my surprise, as we left, it looked like all the tables both upstairs and downstairs were full - on a Wednesday. I guess I was late to the party with this restaurant. It was a great experience. It's not often my husband and I linger over a meal, but we were there for about 2 hours. It didn't feel at all like that long. I can't wait to go back!",0.9993,0.755,0.231,0.014,0.6104775828460038

They didn't have anything vegetarian on the menu, but they were very accommodating and made a vegetarian dish from every section of the menu. The chef was good enough to come up with a vegetarian entree, which was great.  We started with the asparagus cold plate with the home made ricotta cheese. It was fabulous. The ricotta cheese was so light and fresh, it  tasted great with the balsamic glazed mushrooms and asparagus. Next, we ordered the Maine scallops with soba gnocchi topped with parmesan foam but instead of scallops they substituted it with vegetables like eggplant. brussel sprouts. The dish was stellar... the parmesan foam made it a little salty, but we just lapped the whole thing up... it was that good. For the main entree, I ordered the fluke fish and hubby got the special veggie dish that the chef came up with. Both of them were really good, the flavor profiles were unique and they totally worked.

2013-03-01,3.0,"I was very excited to dine at Takashi when my friend told me we had reservation there. Why? Well, none of my Chicago trip ever include Asian cuisine for some reason; and okay, maybe because it was also because I seen him on Top Chef and Iron Chef. On top of that, Chef Takashi Yagihashi is also a James Beard Award winner, and this restaurant received one Michelin Star. And last but not least, I love Japanese cuisine! So I pretty much hyped it all up for myself, and with my high expectation of this place...dum dum dum, it wasn't as ecstatic as I want it to be. I'm not sure maybe because I'm picky about my Japanese food or maybe really, I had better?  My four friends and I all had the Kaiseki dinner and two wine pairings. I have to say--the wine pairing include sake, beer, white wine and red wine--and all were really good! The pairing wasn't that expensive either, consider if you plan to order drinks on the side anyways. The 11-Courses of Kaiseki dinner menu was okay. A lot of the items were either very bland or very pungent. For example, the Big Eye tuna sashimi I had was tasteless whereas the red bean soup dessert was overly sweet. The ""Age-mono Bad Hairday of Prawn"" was super duper greasy. When I lift the fried shrimp up, the paper was greasy and I saw spots of oil on the crispy outer, thus left a really bad lip-filled of oil. The homemade noodle lacked chew (unless it was supposed to be soft and mushy). But aside from those, I really enjoy everything else esp the Foie Gras Chiwaya-mushi, the Scottish trout, the miso cheesecake and blood orange sorbet.  The place is pretty clean cut and nice though. I like the big window and how the tables were aligned. The service was pretty okay. My water was refilled all the time. The only thing I didn't like was that not all the wait staffs know the dishes well enough to explain them. Sometimes I could hardly hear them when they introduce the dish.

That's about where the whole friend thing ends, though. The rest of the formalities you'd expect from a Michelin star restaurant are in place: bread service, thorough explanation of each dish, the option for the chef's tasting menu, and of course yummy and innovative cuisine.  I ordered the ginger lime martini and my date had the pear one. They were both clean and simple. If you prefer sweeter drinks, definitely go for the pear. We started with two cold appetizers: Washugyu Beef Tataki and another one that I can't find on the online menu, but I cannot forget it because it had Peekytoe crab in it. I said Peekytoe! What do you think a Peekytoe crab would look like? Cute, I say. The beef was excellent... barely seared, super flavorful, and came with a really tasty dipping sauce. Mr. Peekytoe was part of an ideal dish, in my opinion. It came with a couple of toast points, salmon, avocado, and capers. The hot appetizers came next, and we had chosen Confit of Rabbit with Golden Chanterelle Mushroom and, of course, Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly (thanks Yelp!). The rabbit reminded me of a dish I had at Peasantry once, but not as good. The flavors were homey and comforting, and I remember Peasantry's as being better and bolder. There was nothing not to like about the pork belly, as it was fatty and sweet and spicy all at once.  We were less impressed with our main courses. He had the short rib and pork belly, and I went for the Chicken in Clay Pot. I actually preferred his to mine, as both meats were melt-in-your-mouth good. He felt that they were a little bland and I agreed. The pork belly appetizer had a lot more flavor and it was hard to forget that as you were eating the main dish. Definitely not bad, though. My chicken was a little disappointing as the meat itself was super plain. They gave me plenty of sauce (and the sauce was really good), but I wish the chicken would have had some of that flavor stick to it. The accompanying haricot vert and mushrooms were fine, but the eggplant was the standout of the pot. It had some sort of gooey substance over the top and I have no idea what it was, but it was awesome! All you really need to know is that the appetizers are worth it and the main plates are not. You should also know that the table next to us consisted of a mother and young son, he was probably about 9 years old. Apparently it was his birthday wish to eat at Takashi after seeing Chef Takashi on Top Chef Masters. Chef Takashi signed a menu for him and sent him out a free little happy birthday dessert.

2013-01-26,5.0,"Takashi is home to the single best bite of food I have ever had in my life: the soy/ginger glazed pork belly. When you take a first bite of a new food and you close your eyes and exhale, you know you've found a winner. When every subsequent bite of that dish follows the exact same pattern, that's when you've found something extraordinary. The complexity and balance of this dish are unmatched. The pork belly is perfectly seared on the outside, yet manages to melt into pure decadance. This is a must try! (I should add a disclaimer: it has been nearly a year since I ate at Takashi, but I remember the meal quite vividly, as I regularly refer to it as one of the best meals I have ever had) On account of a year having passed, the raw hamachi (this is where my memory is starting to fail me a bit) appetizer was exceptional, topped with fennel and grape. After eating this dish, my fiancee and I knew we were in the hands of a master. We have had a number of sashimi dishes elsewhere, and this was just on a different plane. The amish chicken was also top-notch...incredibly moist and flavorful, and it definitely earns presentation points for being served in the clay pot.  The service was outstanding. Our server was knowledgeable and incredibly accommodating in terms of dealing with gluten-free requests. I cannot recommend Takashi enough. It is a fine-dining experience that is worth every penny -- and it will end up costing you far fewer pennies than most of the higher echelon fine-dining establishments in Chicago while giving you a better experience.",0.9736,0.858,0.112,0.03,0.4772629669181393

The only dish I didn't like was the fried dish, but that's a personal preference, not the chef's fault. The desserts blew me away. Perfectly executed, well balanced in flavors, not a bit over-sweet.

The 11 courses were all delicious but there were some definite favorites.  The first course of braised duck with homemade sesame tofu was delicious, especially the sesame tofu which almost had a cheesecake-like consistency, so creamy and slightly sweet, with a nice undertone of sesame.  Wow.  The crudo of yellowtail with pickled herring roe is all about the roe - a crispy/snappy/oceanic bite that has to be eaten to be believed.  The sashimi course consisted of tuna, fluke and Alaskan spot prawn, with the prawn clearly the star on the plate; dare I say sucking on the prawn head was the tastiest bit?  The fried course included an awesome fried Madagascar prawn wrapped in shiso leaf (loooove shiso leaf) but the fried oyster was heavy on the breading.   Foie gras chiyawan-mushi (custard) was creamy, savory and decadent with nice smoky flavors from the dashi base.  The country style soba noodle soup with crispy Amish chicken was so good - how is the chicken skin still crispy after sitting in that broth?  And that broth ... there's something really satisfying about a delicious, clear, hot broth that really hits the spot, especially as the last course in a savory meal. Some courses were not as successful but still tasty nonetheless.  The pork belly was sadly a bit tough.  The broiled trout was just ok.  The seared Wahugyu beef (kinda like Wagyu) was tender but on the bland side. Desserts were interesting.  The sheep milk panna cotta with yuzu was so rich, creamy and satisfying.  The red bean soup was too sweet but the julienned shiso leaf was a nice touch. The service was a bit on the slow side - we noticed other tables seeming to get their food faster than us.  Nevertheless, our water never went long for refilling and we never felt ignored.",0.9981,0.768,0.211,0.022,0.6795502645502643

2012-12-29,4.0,"As a neighbor and Top Chef fan, I was excited to finally get to try out Takashi and had high expectations! My husband and I went recently for dinner. We had an 8:00 reservation, however were told upon arrival that they were running about 15 minutes behind and we were welcome to wait in the bar across the street (6 degrees). Not an ideal start as we had to go get cash out and walk out in the cold again. The restaurant is very small with no waiting area so I understand however it would have been appreciated if the host had called us prior to our reservation time if they knew they were running behind.  At about 8:30 we finally got a call that our table was ready. We were seated upstairs, which after seeing we both agreed we would have preferred to be downstairs as that's where the action and atmosphere is.  We started with the avocado and crab salad cold plate and the soy ginger pork belly steam buns. We were a little disappointed by the crab salad. We thought it needed some more salt and that the texture was a little one note. It was super fresh though and we somehow didn't struggle to finish it. The pork belly steam buns were served deconstructed which was neat and very tasty. My husband ordered the chicken in a clay pot for his main and I got the duck. I definitely had the winner. The duck was melt in your mouth delicious. The chicken was in a great sauce however we both thought it was a little inconsistent. Some pieces were a little dry but those that were fully sauced were mind blowing. We wished it had been that good all the way through! For dessert we got the chocolate sticky cake. For me this was the absolute highlight. It was one of the best desserts I've ever tasted!! Wine selection was nice too and I loved the wine we got.  Service was unpretentious and attentive.  As I mentioned before we had very high expectations, so we expected perfection through and through. While we didn't think it was quite there, it was damn close.

I got the dense walnut and milk chocolate tart with apple sorbet and and apple tart with caramel ice cream.  Yes that was just my dessert even though it sounds like three.  They were all so different but so good.  I loved the chocolatey tart.  It looked like a blondie.  The sorbet I saved for the end because it was very refreshing.  Really the dark horse was the apple tart with caramel ice cream.  I usually don't go for fruity desserts but this was flaky, sweet, apple, caramel goodness!! My boyfriend got the chocolate sticky toffee cake.  I can't go into too great of detail about it because I only got one bite but man!  I wish I had ordered it.  The combo of everything in it was so very rich and delicious.  If its still on the menu when we're back then I'm getting it.",0.9976,0.715,0.281,0.004,0.6214285714285714

Luckily, they were very accommodating, and simply told me to ""try to get there as soon as possible."" When we arrived (more than 30 minutes late), our table was ready and waiting. I could not have been more appreciative! I really enjoyed the ambiance of the restaurant. It's cozy (we sat downstairs; I'm not sure how large their upstairs dining room is), on the dimmer side, and fairly minimalist. I especially appreciated how accessible and unpretentious the service was. When we go to a fancier (read: stuffier) place (like Everest, for example), I have to spend some time mentally steeling myself to deal with snobby sommeliers who correct me on my wine terminology instead of recommending pairings (true story). At Takashi, the servers explained each course and wine pairing clearly and concisely, and were always at hand to answer any questions. We had the seven-course tasting menu, which was consistently delicious and perfectly portioned to leave us feeling only slightly too full, as any good tasting menu should. The courses were a bit eclectic, but each was memorable in its own way. They also matched well with the wine pairings, which were served in very liberal amounts (though I'm certainly not one to complain). And - though I never thought I'd say this about a Michelin restaurant - the pricing was very reasonable for both the quality and quantity of food we had.

2012-11-30,4.0,"My trip to Takashi last night was fantastic, and I was pleased all around with my experience. I made an early dinner reservation on a Thursday, and we were some of the first to arrive at the restaurant. We were able to choose if we wanted to be seated downstairs or upstairs. Since we had never been here before, the host recommended sitting downstairs near the kitchen to see all the action. There were maybe eight tables in the entire seating area, along with a small bar tucked away in a corner. This made for a cozy and intimate dining experience, which we both seemed to enjoy. Upon being seated, our waiter came over to our table to go through the menu. Takashi offers a tasting menu that's around $75 a person, and then an additional fee of about $40 for a wine pairing. We opted to make our own tasting menu by sampling from their cold plates (appetizer size), hot plates (similar to tapas), and entree selection.  We decided to go with the following five choices: Cold Plates 1) Soy Marinated Tuna with Crispy Tortilla topped with Red Onion, Cilantro, and nestled on a Chickpea Salad with a Tomatillo Vinaigrette: This came out first and the presentation was impressive with three miniature tuna tacos nestled on a bed of the chickpea salad. The tuna itself wasn't incredibly flavorful, but I'm also not a sushi expert. Normally my standards for good raw fish is if it isn't fishy, which thankfully this wasn't. Other than that, it seemed to lack any sort of flavor, making this dish more about the toppings. The toppings were incredibly fresh and complimented one another nicely, and I was a huge fan of the soy marinade on the tacos as well as the tomatillo vinaigrette. All in all, not a bad dish, but my least favorite of the evening. 2) Trio of Country Pâté, La Quercia Prosciutto, Chicken Liver Mousse: I'll admit it, I'm a sucker for any sort of charcuterie plate, and I loved the French/Asian twist that Takashi put on this ""classic"". The trio of meats was served with a side of toasted bread, picked cauliflower, and pickled beets. My favorite of the trio was the Chicken Liver Mousse that was light and airy, and was almost dessert-like. It spread perfectly on the bread and was drizzled with a soy prune/date sauce that was decadent. The mousse also went well when topped with the beets, and it was nice to try different pairings. The Pate was also very delicious and it was served with a stone ground mustard and a yellow mustard, both of which complimented the flavors perfectly. As for the prosciutto, we were both a little disappointed with this. It wasn't anything special, just your standard everyday deli prosciutto. Lastly, the pickled cauliflower deserves some special credit here. It was lightly pickled and drizzled with an Asian infused vinaigrette that really made the flavors pop.  Hot Plates 1) Crispy Veal Sweetbreads with Mustard Soy, Caramelized English Radish, Wilted Spinach, Roasted Shallot Jus: The sweet breads were moderately breaded and extremely tender. They were oddly reminiscent of a really tasty fried chicken that meets a slightly peanut-buttery soy sauce. The vegetables in this dish also deserve a lot of credit as each one was cooked to perfection. The brussels sprouts had a nice bite to them, the radish was sweet and spicy, and the spinach wasn't overdone to the tangy/bitter state that many restaurants take it to. By combining bites of these vegetables with the sweetbreads made for a great plate that I would definitely recommend. 2) Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi, Trumpet Royale, Celery Root-Parmesan Foam: This was my favorite of the two hot plates, but I'm also a sucker for a quality scallop as they are hard to come by in the Midwest. The dish had two perfectly prepared scallops that were lightly seared, non-gritty, and deliciously buttery in flavor. The celery root-parmesan foam was a nice compliment to the rich parmesan cream sauce that the gnocchi and scallops were served in. The trumpet royale mushrooms were cooked spot on and added a great flavor to the dish. One word of caution about this dish is that it's incredibly rich, so if that's not up your taste buds' alley then steer clear of this one. Entree 1) Roasted Indiana Duck Breast: Duck Rillette Roll, Baby Turnips, Yellow and Green Bean Salad: Takashi knows how to prepare a duck properly, as was evidenced with this fantastic entree! One medium-rare duck breast was sliced into about ten pieces and served atop a hash of vegetables. The duck was succulent, fatty, and savory. The yellow and green been salad was tossed in a rich and creamy sauce that would have been overpowering if the serving size was much larger. The brown sauce that was served with the duck was amazing and greatly tied together all components of the dish. All in all we were pleased with everything, but at the end of the meal we realized that none of the dishes were very bold in flavor. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a point to note. Either way, I'll be back!",0.9993,0.789,0.175,0.037,0.5953772893772894

Watching chef Takashi Yagihashi on Top Chef Masters, and dined at Okada at Wynn Resort; and congrats his recent Michelin Star, no better way to visit Takashi, but now.            Takashi is in Bucktown, a hip and upcoming neighborhood, 2 stories, tiny little place, about 14 seats on the main level, 4 seats at the bar, and then upstairs. We got to sit at the window, best table for first floor, on a raining night in Chicago, not much of a view, but beautiful and charming regardless. It's such a cute place for first date or date nights!          The hostess and the manager were both so gracious. I was able to score the RSVP last minute. It was Kaiseki dinner  on a Sunday night; 2 choices 11 courses for $100 and 7 courses for only $73. We chose the 7 courses with beverage pairing for $45.          Our server was wonderful from the start to finish. I asked to see the bottle of all the beverages paired with the Kaiseki dinner and he accommodated. Thank you for that.  - Malaspina Oyster with trout roe, jensai soy yuzu sauce - this was beautiful plated, fresh and well-balanced. We loved it.          - Paired with Kurashi Junmai Ginjo Sake - Crudo of ""Buri"" Hamachi (yellowtail fish)  and Santa Barbara Uni (sea urchin), Yamaimo, Tororokombu - everything was delicious, detail, little accent on the topping, the best of the sea.          - Paired with Rihaku Junmai Nigori Sake - Soy-braised pork belly (buta no kakuni) and winter melon, shishito peppers, arimasansho pepper sauce - think of slow cooked, shimmered pork belly, the meat melt in your mouth on each bite, wish I had some jasmin rice with it ;-)           - Paired with Suzume shochu - Crispy Madagascar prawn, tempura lotus rot with mentaiko, kushiaghe of kurobuta, brie - If you are fried food lover, this is a heavenly dish for you ;-) so crispy, tasty and so comforting on a raining night like this.          - Paired with Hitacino Nest White Ale - I'm not a beer drinker, but this beer was amazingly good! I have to look for it here now in Nor Cal. - Broiled Sake curd marinated Scottish sea trout ""Roch Etive"" with pickled wild leek - this was just perfect.          - Paired with Domained de Triennes ""Sainte Fluer"" Viognier 2009 or Jaspinegre Montsant 2008, both was well paired with the trout, love the Montsant! - Ken-Chin Niyumen country style noodle with curry dashi broth, amish chicken - this was perfect for the raining night, the broth was light, sweet, and the curry topping gave it a good kick and flavor to it. The noodle was nice, thin, and tasty. I was quite full by now but managed to lick the bowl to the last dashi drop!   - Sheeps milk panna cotta yuzu curd, macaron - so beautiful, smooth, creamy and not too sweet.         - Paired with Bunny Yuzu sparkling sake, this was the most interesting pairing after the Hitacino beer, or course!         It must be my lucky night, chef Takashi Yagihashi was in, and I got to meet him, very charming, warm, and personal, as you've seen on Top Chef Masters.  I love traveling to town right before Michelin Guide release, chances are chefs always in town ;-)          I enjoyed the excellent service here at Takashi as much as the cuisine itself, I'm definitely coming back soon :-)  Overall: 5 stars For value: 5 stars For Food: 5 stars For Service: 5 stars For ambiance: 5 stars Location: Bucktown",0.9996,0.723,0.267,0.01,0.61818356374808

2012-11-24,3.0,"Its been a while since I last ate at Takashi. Probably 9 months ago. I would have given them two stars but since it was so long ago I wanted give them the benefit of the doubt.  In short our meal was mediocre and our service was no where near the level it should be for a Michelin star restaurant. On the plus side, the aesthetics are perfect. The restaurant is very quant and romantic.  First the service: we were seated 30 - 40 minutes after our reservation. Unfortunately the place is so quant that there wasn't enough room to wait at the bar unless you wanted to be awkward and stand over people enjoying their meal. I approached the hostess and rather than give a sincere apology, she loosely apologized and suggested I go across the street to a bar and she would call me when my table was ready. What!??? No, every quality restaurant would have profusely apologized and comp'd a round of drinks (as I've received at Boka and Bristol). As for the meal service, be prepared to wait. The layout of the restaurant is not really confusing to great service. They have two completely seperate kitchens upstairs and downstairs. I think the service issue is largely a result of the upstairs kitchen being far too small to accommodate the ten tables. Regardless, the service was just bad Then the food: I can't remember all the dishes, but a few stand out. The pork belly was nice and crispy, good dish. The foie gras was not great, the texture I would describe as runny and lacking complexity. The sweetbreads also had a texture issue, some were crispy some weren't, but the flavors were there. The beef tar tar was bland, basically just raw beef loosely dressed in a simple vinegarette with a quail egg on top. While the beef was quality,  the dish just lacked enthusiasm All in all, I wouldn't be so disappointed if my entire meal (gf included) was less than $75...but it was $150 and fell far below expectations",0.991,0.775,0.162,0.062,0.537562656641604

Tempura plate with fresh-water eel and another giant head-on prawn! This plate was extra special because it came with two different dipping salts: the house-made tea salt is the winner by far!  Dobi Mushi is super savory fish soup that came in the cutest little tea pot. After eating all the yummy mushrooms and bits of fish in the dish, we sipped tiny cup after tiny cup of salty, delicious soup.  That's something could wake up to every morning! AND the sheep's milk panna cotta with the raspberry-wasabi french macaroon! SWOON.  I'm generally not a big fan of macaroons but these were fantastic and so light!  And you could taste the wasabi and totally understand how it balanced the sweetness of the raspberry jam. Both the 7 course and 11 course option have wine pairings but we decided just go to with some cocktails.  The last thing I need on a Sunday night is to be crazy fun AND drunk after eating for 3.5 hours.  A lot of the tables around us got the wine pairings and most people couldn't actually finish it all.  It's a lot of foods and liquids to ingest-my recommendation is to tred lightly.

2012-10-09,4.0,"I loved seeing Takashi-san on Top Chef Masters so we definitely had to stop by here while in town.  The venue is laid back and cozy - not too large despite it being two floors.  Pretty romantic place to take a date. We had 8:00PM reservations and were seated immediately upon arrival. Both appetizers we had were spectacular.  The Pork Belly & Buns were really, really good - the buns were thin and not filling and a perfect cradle for the delicious pork belly.   The Scallops & Gnocchi were even better - The gnocchi were cooked perfectly and were a rich, creamy complement to the scallops.  The Parmesan foam made this dish absolutely erupt with flavor. For mains we had the Chicken in a Clay Pot and the Meat and Potatoes.  The Chicken in the clay pot came piping hot.  This was a very pleasing dish aromatically, and tasted even better.  I found the dark pieces of chicken to be especially succulent, overall a big winner.  The Meat and Potatoes were the only misstep of the night.  The curry croquettes were certainly pretty good but unfortunately the tenderloin came stone cold.   I also enjoyed the beer - Hitachino Nest Japanese Classic Ale.  We split dessert which was a creme brulee served in an eggshell.  I was pretty impressed at the skill of placing this dessert in the shell and I am sure that many eggs were wasted on failed attempts.  The dessert was delicious however, so kudos to the poor guy who had to make it.

I went with my friend Corey (my culinary cohort and overindulgence partner).  We each had a starter, entree, and a dessert.  As always, my review is going to focus mostly on the food ... Starters: Crudo of Baby Octopus and Scallop Prosciutto, Cucumber, Sea Weed, Sweet Vinaigrette, Miso Mustard Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi Trumpet Royale, Celery Root-Parmesan Foam The octopus was pretty good.  It was tender and texturally intriguing.  The gnocchi (although you can't really see much due to the giant ball of foam sitting on top of it) was out-of-this-world-I-would-give-up-my-first-born-child-to-eat-this-everyday good.  Seriously.  Seriously.  Seriously.  We did everything short of licking the plate clean with this one.  I'd go back JUST for this dish. For entrees we had : Sauteed Arctic Char Corn Flan, Fricassee of Fava Beans, Ramps, Maitake, Wild Leek Vinagrette Roasted Indiana Duck Breast Duck Rillette Roll, Baby Turnips, Green Bean Salad Both of these were excellent.  Corey had the arctic char and I had the duck.  My favorite part about the arctic char dish was far and away the corn flan.  I mean, come on, delicious.  The duck was one of the best I've had.  It was tender, the fat perfectly rendered, and roasted to a gorgeous medium rare.  Those crispy rillettes were a great contrast of texture with their crunchiness and I never knew a simple green bean salad could be that velvety if not folded into a casserole, grandma style. On to dessert: Lemon Pound Cake with Peaches Gelee, Creme Fraiche Ice Cream, Balsamic Reduction Sesame Panna Cotta with Genoise Pickled Cherries, Sesame Dust, Cherry Cocoa Nib Ice Cream Uhhhhhhh creme fraiche ice cream?  Bitch, please.  That is butter fucking ice cream!  And it's ridiculously good!  How can that not be what you order for your last dessert on death row?  Seriously, the balls that Takashi has ... they're giant.  That ice cream was really the highlight here.  Everything else was pretty good but, being that I am not a huge fan of cherries, the panna cotta dish was not my favorite.  The sesame panna cotta itself was pretty tasty though (but small). Overall, yes, Yes, YES to Takashi; I WILL be back.  The food was (obviously) better than I could have asked it to be, the service was impeccable, the cocktails were strong (which in my book translates to 'excellent'), and the building itself has to be the cutest little house on the block.  I will definitely plan another visit to try everything I didn't get to try this time.

With a Michelin star rating, it's not hard to say it deserves at LEAST 5 Yelp stars. Yeah, it's really that good. Other reviewers have commented on the unassuming building, the simple, clean lines inside, the presence of Takashi himself, Top Chef Master overseeing the food prep. And my goodness, is that food good!! We started with a cold and hot plate to get us into the groove. Cold plate was the peekytoe crab with avocado and beets. It's served inside half an avocado with jicama strips on top and has a slightly sweet crab taste coupled with the richness of the ripe avocado. AWESOME. The beet is a work of art and was so delicious - and I'm not a beet fan. Our hot plate was the scallops and gnocchi with the parmesan foam. The gnocchi were the best I've had - no question. And the scallops were cooked to absolute perfection - not an easy feat. Totally amazing. For entrees, my wife ordered the arctic char which turned out to be an outstanding choice. Served with a spring pea flan (to DIE for) and a fricasee of fava beans - which may have been one of the best things I've ever tasted. Who knew fava beans could taste like that? Also served with ramps and a wild leek vinagrette - this dish was spectacular. My choice was the loin of veal - and I can honestly say I don't think this has ever happened to me before. I took one bite, put my fork down, shut my eyes and just let myself go with all the flavors in my mouth - layers of distinct and delight flavors revealing themselves one after another. I totally was in another world. Three medallions of fork tender veal in a preserved lemon caper brown butter, a gratin of spring onion, couscous, and bacon wrapped asparagus. That subtle lemon caper awakening, the brown butter richness, the veal so tender and mellow - oh man, it was all I could do to snap out of it and get back in action! It was among the nest things I've ever eaten - hands down! Order it! For dessert we elected to share the chocolate sticky cake - perhaps the finest dessert I've ever had (notice a theme here??).

We felt the Sunday noodle lunch would make a great litmus test of the mastery before we splurge on the dinner menu. The small plates were satisfying. We had the pork belly, gyoza and  duck fat fried chicken. They were all beautifully presented. Flavors were not overpowering, and tasted fresh. But that was no more a compliment. The pork belly lacked the crispy skin, which disappointed me a little. The gyoza was well seasoned. And the duck fat fried chicken was surprisingly mild but was missing some kick. I still maintain my-preference for the Chinese 5-spice approach. We then had the special of the day - a cold noodle with a house vinaigrette sauce; and the shoyu ramen. The noodles were wonderfully al dente, and it confirmed to me that hot noodles are still the preferred approach than cold. Honestly, for $4 less, the ramen at Santouka in the Mitsuwa food court makes a good contender. With a green tea, 3 small plates and 2 noodles, the bill came to a reasonable $60 for lunch from a celeb chef establishment. Considering how most of them would go to extortionist-like prices, we DID NOT feel exploited.   A little lust note: Takashi-san is as gentlemanly as he portrayed himself on Top Chef Masters, and I couldn't help gazing at him.

2012-09-12,5.0,"In short, this was probably the best meal I've ever had. And I've had a lot of great meals. In detail, we were in Chicago and decided to attempt a high-end dinner again after our terrible experience at Michael Mina in SF. I was pleasantly surprised to see that we could get a reservation the next night (Thursday) at Takashi. Yes, we've been watching Top Chef Masters and I have fallen in love with Takashi. He is so kind to his competitors, has a great sense of humor, and his food looks amazing. So, I was very excited to get to eat at his restaurant. I was a bit worried though as I saw many reviewers mentioning a Groupon and saying the quality had gone down hill lately. But, we had to try it out for ourselves. We almost walked right by the restaurant because it's in an inconspicuous house turned restaurant. We were seated upstairs where there was a wide range of people from some Grouponers next to us in jeans and t-shirts to people on dates in ties and dresses. Everyone was treated equally regardless of dress or Groupon-ness. There was only one server upstairs with the help of a couple runners so he was quite busy. It took him a bit to take our orders but we did get drinks in the meantime. I had a great glass of white wine and my boyfriend had a beer. We were told about the tasting menu and were intrigued to learn that it included the truffle oyster dish Takashi won a quick fire challenge with on Top Chef. But, we didn't want the tasting menu. So we asked if we could just order the oyster dish and were told that wouldn't be a problem. Score. There are many cold and hot plates that are tapas size so we decided to just order a mix of things that sounded good rather than having actual courses. We ordered and shared: the truffle oyster dish with yuzu - One of the best things I've ever eaten. The flavors were so complex and rich duck confit salad - My boyfriend loved this. I thought it was good but I'm not that into duck. It just tastes like chicken to me. washugyi beef tataki - great flavor, tender meat, good sauce foie gras - Unbelievably delicious.  I love foie and order it everywhere I can but this one was the best yet. sweetbreads - These were the only let down of the meal. I make sweet breads at home and glaze them with balsamic then grill them until they are crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. These sweetbreads were just soggy everywhere. The flavor was good but the texture was not pleasant. arctic char - I love this fish and this was a great example of how to serve it. Simple, delicious. sesame panna cotta with pickled cherries dessert - Odd flavors that sounded good in theory but didn't pan out. I love panna cotta but this one fell a bit short. Still good, just not great. The Egg chocolate egg dessert - an egg shell with chocolate mousse-ish stuff inside and a small cake on the side. The stuff in the egg was really good. I could have eaten a bucket of that. The cake was okay. As we were finishing our drinks I noticed that Taskashi was talking to a table near us. The table was full of obnoxious tools that spent all night being loud so everyone noticed them while they talked about the south of France, their nannies, and their Range Rovers. They also seemed to know the manager or someone like that. So, I figured Takashi was just giving them some lip service. Then he stopped by every table in the room to make sure their dinner was good. Such an awesome guy. When he came to our table we talked to him for a minute and then got a picture with him. He was so nice and accommodating.  For the meal listed above, 3 glasses of wine and 3 beers the total was only $130 (plus tip of course). Awesome value, amazing food, and a great chef. Highly recommended. We decided we enjoyed our meal so much that we should hop over to Slurping Turtle (his other restaurant) right after and try that too. Yes, we're crazy.",0.9996,0.729,0.24,0.03,0.5932333921222811
2012-09-10,4.0,"Came here last night (on a Sunday) to celebrate my boyfriend's passing of his 1st year of graduate school as well as to celebrate another month of dating. He made the reservation for 830pm, and we were seated upstairs.  We ordered Takashi's homemade silken tofu. I love tofu, and I love this dish. It was one of the best tofu I've ever had. It was so fresh. Delicious. We also ordered the duck fat fried chicken. This was one of my favorite dishes from Slurping Turtle, and I enjoyed it here too. The boyfriend ordered the shoyu ramen and I ordered the miso ramen. I'm glad I ordered what I ordered because the boyfriend let me taste his soup and it was just as salty as I remembered it at Slurping Turtle. I don't understand why. The miso ramen was much less salty. It had spinach, corn, bean sprouts, and fatty chashu. I liked it so much more than the shoyu.  For dessert, we got the soy panna cotta. I've never had panna cotta before as I usually skip over the dessert menu, and the boyfriend mentioned that he usually likes panna cotta. When he showed me what it was on Wikipedia, I thought ""This reminds me of my favorite childhood dessert-- almond jello with fruit cocktail"" so I wanted to try it. Plus, I like tofu... so a soy panna cotta sounded good to me, and it was delicious. Well, I thought so anyway; the boyfriend didn't like it as much. I couldn't taste the coconut flavor, but the passionfruit and blueberries were there as well as a very distinct tofu/soy flavor.  We had a fun evening.

The restaurant was pretty busy but we were lucky enough to reserve a seat ahead of time.  The menu for that afternoon consisted of various small plates and noodle bowls. I had the duck fat fried chicken to start and the rice noodle bowl with beef and mixed veg tables along with a ginger lime martini to wash it down with. The meal really reminded me of my mother's home cooking when I was a kid. The meal was well prepared and timely served. I really enjoyed the friendliness of the staff. They were very interactive and highly attentive to the needs of the guests. The ambiance gave a really modern but warm home-like feel.

2012-09-03,4.0,"First I would like to say that Chef Takashi is every bit as cute as he appears on TV (Top Chef Masters). His personality is truly approachable and refreshing, as is his food. The miniature house-like dining room is also very quaint, classy yet surprisingly cozy and comfortable. Service is warm yet not overbearing - certainly reflective of Takashi's one Michelin star status. The bf and I made it out to Bucktown on a rainy Saturday evening. Because we had just dined at Girl & the Goat hours before and consumed many drinks since, we decided to order only a few small plates here to share for our late dinner.  Cold plates:  - Salad of Duck Confit and Prosciutto: I would hardly call this a ""small plate,"" it was a very generously portion of an entire leg of duck confit atop sweet and sour french lentils, sunny side up quail egg, and a salad of bleeding heart radish and mache on the side. Not only was the presentation beautiful, but the flavors were all spot on as well. The duck was tender and perfectly rendered, without any heavy seasoning which allowed the natural flavor of the meat to really shine. The nicely al dente sweet and sour french lentils also displayed Takashi's ability to fuse Asian flavors with French sensibility - something very few chefs can execute well. - Soy Marinated Tuna with Crispy Tortilla: this more appropriately-sized appetizer was kind of like a riff on tuna poke and fish tacos. The ahi tuna was beautifully seasoned and lightly garnished, with just the right amount of cilantro and tomatillo vinaigrette. Even though the ingredients are expected of Mexican cuisine, the combination of flavors were unmistakably Asian; how Takashi does that I do not know. The chickpea salad accompaniment was a surprise and seemed a tad out of place right off the bat, but actually worked because of its delicately Asian seasoning as well. This was actually the bf's favorite plate of the night simply because it was so unassuming and delicate. Hot plates: - Seared Quebec Foie Gras: hallelujah to creamy, rich foie! This dainty sliver of decadent liver was scored and seared perfectly, and bursting with juicy flavor. The poached kumquats, pear and huckleberry port reduction made the dish almost dessert-like, but the bf and I couldn't help but practically lick the plate clean. - Soy Ginger Caramel Pork Belly: should it even come as a surprise that we just had to order this? (1. pork belly is the boy's favorite cut of protein of all time, 2. pork belly + steamed buns = winning!) Needless to say, this plate delivered on all fronts; from the pillowy steamed buns serving as the perfect vehicle for the buttery pork belly, to the pickled daikon salad providing some acidic relief, and of course the main event - the caramelized, tender pork belly. I can see why this is one of Takashi's signature dishes for sure. Dessert: Every single dessert we saw on the dessert menu looked promising, and it was extremely painful to turn down the sesame panna cotta as well as the peach dessert. The bf and I ended up ordering The Egg, described as a milk chocolate creme brulee inside a hen's egg and strawberry macaron. I was pleased with the flavor of the creme brulee, which was much lighter than most I've had, and certainly amused with the presentation. However I did wish I had ordered the sesame panna cotta instead. Sigh, I should know better than to even turn down a sesame dessert. So now that I've traveled all the way to Chicago and sampled Takashi's food first hand... time to get back to cheering for Chef Takashi on Top Chef Masters!",0.999,0.78,0.198,0.022,0.5373206349206349
2012-08-30,5.0,"American/French food with a Japanese influence. Confused? Well ignore all the explanations and just come here and try it. We had the tasting menu, which was pricey at $75 but worth every last cent. I could eat giant bowlfuls of the soba gnocchi, which were light, fluffy and incredibly flavorful. The soy-ginger caramel pork belly was the best version of a steamed pork bun I have ever tried. The dessert was phenomenal with the crème brulee and custard foam both rich but delicate tasting and the perfect serving size.  One warning though. It's probably best to avoid eating for the day if you come for the tasting menu. I almost gave up on it about halfway through because I was so full. The portion sizes are generous and the food definitely comes out at a fast pace. The best part of the whole experience was having Takashi himself at the window, popping his head out to make sure our food got to us in a timely manner.

2012-08-25,3.0,"Interesting take on japanese-french fusion, but it misses the mark on several dishes. I came to Takashi through Groupon and ordered the tasting menu with wine pairings. The restaurant is very charming, and I adored the simple, yet elegant decor. However, our service was lackluster, and I was not impressed by several of the dishes. First, our servers seemed disinterested in our table. While they were enthusiastic and chatty with the surrounding tables, they acted cold when interacting with our table and simply dropped off our food as it was ready. Moreover, we could never hear what they were saying because of the loud environment and incessant mumbling, so I never quite knew what we were tasting. Overall, the service was not up to par. Service aside, the food was above average, but Takashi did not outshine its contemporaries. The progression of the dishes was outstanding, but the last 3 courses had too long of a gap between them. Also, the portions were underwhelming. Having done the tasting menu at Craft, I was surprised at how small each dish was, and I left hungry after five courses. Complaints aside, I absolutely loved the pork belly dish; it was easily one of the best dishes I've experienced to date. If you order it, make sure to spread some of the spicy peanut sauce onto the bun, it positively makes the dish! The rest of the tasting menu ranged from good to mediocre, and two days later, I can barely recall my experience there. Whereas, I still remember every detail of my meal at Craft nearly 1.5 years later. In the end, I will not be returning to Takashi. We over-payed for an over-hyped, under-delivered meal. While the pork belly is outstanding, its not enough to bring me back. Sorry Takashi.",0.9956,0.784,0.184,0.031,0.5166305916305917

The service has gone downhill and the dishes my boyfriend and I love so much (pork belly steamed buns) didn't taste as good as we remembered.  Additionally, we ended up here on a Wednesday night when at 8pm they turn off the mellow music, turned on televisions and blasted Top Chef. I get it, Takashi is on the show, but I don't want to watch it while I'm enjoying an intimate dinner let alone have the sound booming into my ear. I understand this is an ""event"" they apparently do on Wednesdays now, but I also wish we were alerted to this monstrosity when we made the reservation...  And the icing on the cake. THEY FORGOT MY FRIEND'S ALLERGY. My friend has a shellfish and nuts allergy that must be taken very seriously. At the beginning of the night we were impressed by the chef's offering to make a tasting menu just for him, but then we were provided with extra desserts since we were celebrating a birthday and they were covered in nuts. Allergic friend ate some and immediately began a coughing fit so we ask the waiter, ""hey were there any nuts in these?"" His response, ""oh sorry, I forgot about your allergy.""

2012-08-19,4.0,"I'll admit, I was nervous to come here. My father, a lovely but fussy man, had one wish this year -- to never be taken out to Japanese food again -- literally, that was all he wanted from me (a downer given that my spirit ethnicity is clearly Japanese) and although I had previewed the menu thoroughly, the amnt of grief he gave my mother and me prior to arriving was both hilarious and anxiety provoking (which was only enhanced by the closure of Lake Shore Dr whilst we were trying to get to the resto, a traffic jam that ended in my father taking the SUV actually off road and across a planted median so we could make a U-turn and avoid the traffic) -- but onto the decor/food. We were seated upstairs, tucked away in a corner that was delightfully friendly for my grandmother's hearing aids -- though I wish we had been on the darling patio so we could have observed the parade of Bucktown's finest, but regardless, it's a small restaurant, but does a nice job with the space that it has. For my father's sake, I was thrilled when we sat down and saw that the menu is much more heavily French than Japanese -- there was foie in more dishes than I can count -- the menu rotates, but if you go within the next few months, the peekytoe crab starter was delicious -- served in half an avocado, it's glorious and light. I hit up the homemade tofu, which was quite nice and delicate -- my grandmother raved abt the scallops w/ soba gnocchi, claiming it was one of the best things she's ever eaten, but she's also the type of woman who calls busted children ""adorable"", so take that with a grain of salt. For mains we did the cobia, artic char, and chicken in a pot. All were well liked, with an interesting blend of Japanese + French flavors -- ex, my char came with favas and shitakes in a light cream sauce, rather than leaving them naked.  In terms of service, we were a bit neglected, I think because our waitress was new. Though very friendly, she never really came to check on us and our food took forever to come. We were celebrating my mother's 61st, and the ball was dropped on bringing out the special dessert we had requested. Not a game changer, but still. Oh, for dessert, the tickets are the peach pound cake (lovely presentation, rich peaches, yummmm) and the caramel creme brulee thing -- which in my mind, should only be ordered because it comes with one of the best macarons I've ever eaten -- to the point where we made them bring us a plate of the macarons individually.

2012-08-19,3.0,"We were so excited to dine here after seeing some of the tricks Takashi had up his sleeve on Top Chef Masters. We decided on the chef's tasting menu, which was a 5 course meal, and the wine pairings. The courses seemed very hit of miss. The octopus was very chewy, the pork belly was fatty and there were many courses where it felt like some element was missing. Also, the wine pairings were very uninspired and didn't seem to do much to enhance the flavors of the dish. That was a little disappointing as with many pairings before it elevates the dish to a new level.

2012-08-12,2.0,"This place has one Michelin Star?! Are you kidding me? Compared to all the other one Michelin starred restaurants, Takashi fell short on both service and the food.  We arrived at 6:30pm on a Saturday night, were seated upstairs right away. But then after sitting there by ourselves for over 15min, there was still nobody came over to say ""welcome"", or ""would you like to drink wine/cocktail"". So Strike one!  My husband kept telling me to be patient, because usually I am supposed to be the patient person of the party. BUT I'm sorry, if you have one Michelin star, you have a reputation to defend, and service is a huge part of it. There are 10 tables upstairs, but unfortunately only 2 waiters, not to mention one table had 6 people. I mean I'd think this place makes enough money, so hire more waiters! Leaving your customers waiting was not the way to cut corners.  I finally waved down the water boy, asked him to find someone to take our orders. When the waiter finally came, I just ordered cocktail, sake, and the tasting menu all at one. Who knows when he'd back after this time!   I ordered the Mayfair cocktail and my husband had the ginger cocktail (forgot the name). When the waiter came back with our drinks, he put the ginger one in front of me and the Mayfair cocktail in front of my husband. Call me picky, but if this happened at McDonald's, I couldn't care less. BUT once again, you are a one-Michelin starred restaurants, make sure your waiters knows who ordered what, and put them in front of the right party. Try Moto, try L2O, try Topolobampo or Spiaggia, even try Schwa, it's almost a imperative to know which party of the guests ordered what drink or food. On top of that, I absolutely hate ginger in my drinks, and I had a mouthful of that ginger cocktail that I thought was my Mayfair because I mistakenly thought our waiter could do his job. Strike two!   Here comes the food. The soy marinated tuna didn't taste too fresh for some reason, I've had way better tuna than this. Barbeque eel summer roll, I couldn't even taste the eel...The scallops and soba gnocchi had a weird slimy texture to it, I thought scallops aren't slimy?  Strike two and half.  The good thing was, everything was better after those three very disappointing dishes. Maybe because you can't possibly make any dishes worse than those, and our expectations by then already hit rock bottom. Anyways, the pork belly was tender, and the sauce was flavorful, but per my husband, that just tastes like some Chinese pork belly dish that we could have any day in China Town. My favorite of the night was the duck breast. It might be one of the best duck breast I've had in Chicago. Even when comparing to Tru, Next, les nomades, this duck breast still reigns supreme. It was sooooo tender and almost melt in my mouth. It was perfectly cooked, and just about the right portion. But what ruined the dish for me was the sauce on the plate. It was overly sweet and almost had a little burned taste to it. I ate all my duck breast without touch the sauce again.  The egg dessert was basically milk chocolate Crème Brulee in an egg shell, topped with caramel custard foam. It's salty, it's sweet, it's perfectly balanced, and it's the high note of the night for me.   In summary, the food didn't wow me, the restaurant needs to hire more people, the whole experience just wasn't impressive enough for us to pay a second visit.",0.9729,0.822,0.103,0.076,0.5846968929415737

2012-08-01,5.0,"This review is sadly, a little late considering it's been three years since my first visit and another year since my last.   I took someone here on a whim, based on hearing the name mentioned by another chef we knew.  It was one of our most food-oriented trips to Chicago and this was the anchor for Saturday night.  We didn't look at the menu beforehand and I think that was the best thing about it. Absolutely everything on the appetizer/small plate side looked awesome, and the entrees, while appealing, just didn't draw us in as much.  So, we opted to order pretty much the entire hot and cold plate selection minus soups and two different pro-vegetarian items.  The look on the server's face (she was phenomenal) was priceless.  We asked that they just send it out in whichever way is either suggested or most convenient for them. I know that we enjoyed everything that came out, but the one item that stands out most was a barbeque style dish of braised porkbelly with steamed dumpling/rolls, spicy mustard and a pickled vegetable of some sort.  One of my favorite things to do with any food is to turn it into a sandwich, and this plate was built to do exactly that.  And it was friggin awesome. To round out the dinner with our bottle of Cava, we ordered the dessert menu.  It sounds like more than it is.  None of the desserts were of gigantic proportions, and I do remember one dish as having a selection of sorbets.  Chef Takashi himself came to our table to laugh over how much the two of us had ordered.  It was all pretty awesome, and at a pretty good price considering the number of dishes. More recent visits were always quick stops for a couple small plates early or desserts late, which always seemed to fit in well. I truly love this restaurant, and it was a lucky experience for one of my first forays into Chicago when I moved to the Midwest.  Based on style and service, and sheer quality and flavor of food, this is a restaurant worth at least one visit.  Don't eat for a day, take three people with you and order everything.",0.9965,0.825,0.166,0.009,0.5541666666666666

Duck oil fried whatever sounds awesome but it just might not be the best option.  Go for the cold appetizers. Go for the cold soba noodles. Appreciate the subtle array of flavors.

2012-07-15,4.0,"Happy belated Bastille Day! We went to the French restaurant Takashi and were seated within earshot of a yapping table of French personnes on the actual holiday. ""Are you doing anything for Bastille Day?"" I asked our server. ""I don't actually know what that is..."" was our server's response. ""Oh. It's a French holiday and it's today."" I s'pose that Takashi wasn't doing anything to celebrate. C'est la vie. Maybe it's because the head chef/owner is Japanese. Despite the oversight of the holiday, we really enjoyed our experience at Takashi. At first we didn't spot it, then realized that it was a little house sandwiched between two larger buildings. The homey signage was small, but definitely said Takashi. Whew! We were in the right place! We were whisked by the dining area to the second floor where I was surprised to find a lovely, more private chambre. There was a large window facing the street out front, and two windows facing the brick walls of the buildings on either side. The vaulted ceiling and exposed brick wall were nice, loft-style touches. The seating on one side of our table was a long bench that served as the common seating for our neighboring tables. Cushions were piled in the corner within easy reach for lumbar support. I was worried that the bench might be uncomfortable, but M assured me that it was génial! Despite our server's ignorance of Bastille Day, she was very helpful in pointing out popular menu items. We took our time deciding if we should get the prix fixe and sample five of Takashi's best dishes for $72 or if it would be more cost effective to get them independently. We opted for the following: SHARED: Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi ($14) - This was by FAR the most magnifique dish of the evening. M, who does not normally like scallops and was just raving about her gnocchi from Tocco, insisted that these scallops were the best that she's ever had in her entire life. I agree, this dish was buttery without being heavy, the scallops were soft and moist and had an ever-so-slight crunch on the top and bottom. The gnocchi was creamy and unlike anything I've ever had. SHARED: Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly ($14) - These came as an assemble-yourself open-faced sandwich. The bread was sliced steamed bun (moist, spongy, and warm). There were three slices of pork belly covered in sauce and a pile of greens. I had to agree with M who declared that it tasted like a barbecue pork bun. Certainly, it was exquis and more upscale than a simple pork bun, but still. The similarity squandered some of the magic AND it was more difficile to eat. ME: Chicken in Clay Pot ($26) - It was agréable. The mushrooms were the best part and I don't like mushrooms. They were soft (not chewy) and had a hint of lemon. The beans were fresh and only lightly cooked - I liked that. The eggplant was buried beneath the chicken and had good flavor, but was so soft that it was hard to skewer with a fork. The chicken was succulent and good. It was served in thick slices. The texture and presentation reminded me of a pork chop. Eh. It's hard to get excité about chicken. M: Meat and Potatoes ($31) - In her own words this is what she has to say about it: ""Mmm. I don't know. It seems like it was good quality meat. The potatoes were creamy. The two sides with curry were PHENOMENAL. That's it."" While we were eating she constantly raved about the two sides reminding her of curry dishes that she had in Japan. Authentique to Japanese cuisine. She loved those sides and did not finish her meat. She cut a piece of one of the sides and put it on my plate to try, saying that it tasted like felafel. I agreed with her, it did taste like felafel (crunchy exterior with vegetables inside), but I didn't like it. With two glasses of wine, one martini, and tax, our bill came to $138.60. I think we made a good decision not to do the prix fixe as we came away full, got to try Takashi's most popular dishes, and came away paying less. Takashi was bien. I am interested in going again, having an encore of the scallops and gnocchi and then trying some other dishes. Like the duck. If I didn't get the chicken, I would have gotten the duck instead. I would also like to try some of the other small plates. I think that Takashi creates a lovely dining experience with good food that somehow exploits simple flavors and presents them in a creative manner.",0.9988,0.788,0.166,0.047,0.5371951219512198
2012-07-13,4.0,"Good food, nice staff. We liked Takashi on this first visit. The room is small and a bit noisy, but nicely decorated in a spare Asian motif. The menu offers many tempting choices, and the wine list has a very good selection of bottles at various price points. My favorite dish was a soy-ginger caramel pork belly small plate; the medley of flavors was varied and nicely balanced, the presentation perfect. Next was a seared veal loin entrée, delicious and attractively plated with couscous, asparagus and onion gratin - very tasty. My companion's corn chowder with smoked bluefish and picked onion was also full of good flavor, though she was underwhelmed by chicken in a clay pot, which she characterized as unexciting. Takashi is a bit pricey, but the ingredients and attention to culinary detail are commensurate with the tab. A good bet for a casually elegant foodie outing...",0.9946,0.695,0.297,0.008,0.6125333333333334

My favorite dishes are the pork belly and ""the egg"" (milk chocolate creme brulee). One time, I went there to celebrate my birthday on a Friday night, and went again 2 days later just to try their lunch before I left Chicago. The manager recognized us and gave us free desserts!!!

I went to Takashi for their Sunday Night Noodle Dinner, and let me tell you, this restaurant is now in my top 5 in Chicago. My husband and I shared the eggplant salad (delish), the pork belly snack (I typically dislike the texture of pork belly, but this was amazing), and the duck fat fried chicken (wonderful). I also had the silky tofu mushroom ramen (ridiculously flavorful), and he had the shoyu ramen (I just had a bite, but it was good). Shared the soy coconut panna cotta for dessert (I dislike panna cotta in general, but the husband liked it).  In addition to the amazing food and interesting (albeit small) wine list, the prices were very reasonable considering the portion size. I would absolutely go back.

He was using profanity that made me feel so uncomfortable, I felt like walking out but my boyfriend convinced us to stick it thru. But other than that the food and service was amazing.

2012-06-17,5.0,"I made reservations for 3 people for brunch on Father's Day. My parents are really difficult to take out to eat. They really only will eat seafood OR Asian cuisine. They're picky. Our party expanded from 3 people to 7 people, and the restaurant was quick to accomodate (only had to push back the reservation by one hour!). It's a charming, casual house with very few seats, so reservations are highly recommended. Also, they have valet, but I found street parking pretty easily. Even better? No meters on this street! We ordered the  (2) eggplant salads (eggplant cooked perfectly, I just wish there was more eggplant), takashi salad, (2) spicy octopus and squid salads, agedashi tofu with eggplant (again, wish there was more eggplant!), (2) pork belly snacks, harumaki (like little pan fried spring rolls), and duck fat fried chicken to start. I'm really glad I came with a big group so I could sample all of these delicious small plates, but if I came again, I'd really want the eggplant salad, pork belly snack, and duck fat fried chicken again. How did they fry that chicken so it wasn't greasy?  Then, we shared four orders of noodles. Shoyu ramen, silky tofu/mushroom/eggplant ramen, the special (cold ramen), and the beef rice noodle. By far, the silky tofu/mushroom eggplant ramen was the best. The broth was the most delicate and most distinct. And if you think you'll miss the meat and be hungry, you won't. They give a nice huge portion! For dessert, we got everything: the cheesecake, the green tea shortbread, and the soy coconut panna cotta. Based on the plates, it was all terrific, but my favorite was the soy coconut panna cotta. The panna cotta was creamy and silky, the mandarin broth was tart and sweet, and the crispy wafers gave a perfect contrast of texture.  For eating like a bunch of pigs, we got out for pretty cheap... all things considered. Expensive for ramen and asian, yes. But for Takashi and authentic in the US? Not too bad.  All the ""adults"" (my aunts, uncles, and parents) gave this the Chinese ""not bad"" thumbs up (which means, ""wow! really good!"") High praise indeed. ETA: I came back for another Sunday brunch because I needed more. The waiter remembered me and welcomed me back.  My friend and I shared the duck fat fried chicken (how can you go wrong?) and the agedashi tofu with eggplant to start. I don't know what Takashi does to eggplant, but he is the eggplant master. I would just eat eggplant all day, if he had that on the menu. My friend ordered the rice noodle soup with beef, fried tofu, and bok choy (it was Takashi's version of pho, i think) which had a terrific broth (slightly spicy). But I stand firm that the silky tofu/mushroom/eggplant ramen is the best bowl on the menu. I made myself stop halfway through so I could eat it again for dinner. We shared the soy coconut panna cotta (mmm) for dessert and I was surprised when the waiter brought out a complimentary plate of the salted caramel cheesecake. You can't go wrong. TIPs:  1) see above. Get the tofu/mushroom/eggplant ramen.  2) make reservations. this place is tiny. if no reservations are available on opentable, call. 3) Eat family style: try to come with at least 3 other people so you can do justice to the small plates offerings. ask for bowls so you can also share the noodle dishes. 4) bring your camera if you're a foodie. you might see Takashi!!",0.9989,0.761,0.203,0.036,0.6182091097308486

2012-06-05,4.0,"I've been to Takashi at least three times...and never had a bad experience. This place is quaint & romantic, has great service and phenomenal food. My last visit is warranting the review because after dining at ING Restaurant and Graham Elliott recently, I was wondering if all tv-famed chefs were getting stingy with their food. Takashi is not. My fiance and I went for the tasting menu and we almost said in unison as the first dish came out ""it's already prettier than ING"". And our first bite confirmed that it was more flavorful and delicious. We purposely skipped the wine pairing because of our experience at ING...and leaving hungry and drunk...we just were hoping we'd leave Takashi with our tummies scrumptiously filled. And we did! Takashi's menu doesn't have a ton of choices, but they're all good ones, so if you can't decide...skip the decision and just do the tasting menu! It consists of 5 plates and one dessert. I'm not sure if this changes seasonally, but it's a definite hit. My favorite dish was a tie between the washugyu beef tataki and sautéed maine scallops and soba gnocchi. Each dish was layered with different flavors. Being a steak tartar fan, the beef tataki was heavenly. It almost melted in your mouth, so that's a given. And the scallops and gnocchi were amazing as well. My only complaint from the entire evening...is my scallop wasn't cooked entirely, so it left an ammonia-like taste in my mouth...but my lovely fiance switched with me and so I gobbled down his with delight. The gnocchi you could tell was fresh because it had a little bit of a different texture and was less chewy than others. My fiance's favorite was the pork belly with steamed buns. Those buns are to die for! They tell you to create an open-faced sandwich, with two hearty slices of pork belly, two buns and an ass-kicking mustard. Just amazing. And filling! By the time the main course came around, we were stuffed...but eagerly devoured the perfectly cooked roasted duck breast. Oh, and we can't forget ""the egg"" dessert. So beautifully presented. In a brown egg shell they manage to cram a serious brulee, so good! The wait staff was attentive and educated us on each dish they brought out. We didn't feel rushed, the plates were brought out in ample time...it was just an overall A+ experience.",0.9975,0.775,0.193,0.033,0.5952485380116959

2012-05-28,5.0,"So when I return to a restaurant for a second time, I usually don't update my review unless I'm changing my rating. But for Takashi, I'll make an exception. I gave them five stars last time because I thought that the food was really great, but it was even better this time, if that's even possible. I would give them another star if I could; too bad Yelp doesn't go any higher than five. We were here for the Sunday noodle dinner menu (tip, you can't also order off the regular menu on Sundays). We were trying to spend an $80 groupon, so we went pretty wild since the Sunday dinner is cheaper than their regular menu. Here's what we tried: Small Plates 1 - Spicy octopus and squid salad - pretty good salad and very light 2 - Eggplant salad - amazing, I'm usually a pretty big fan of eggplant but I didn't know that it could be this good. It's also very light, with a sweet/tangy miso dressing.  3 - Pork belly snack - same item as the soy-ginger caramel pork belly from the regular menu, delicious both times 4 - Duck fat fried chicken - best fried chicken I've ever had, although I haven't tried gourmet fried chicken at other places before so I have nothing to compare this to. Still, it's very juicy and tender, with a beautiful crunch. Mains 5 - Miso ramen - delicious. I've never had ramen in Chicago, but I have been to a few places in Los Angeles (which is known for better Asian food), but none of those places can compare to Takashi. The broth was delicious and not swimming with MSG, the noodles were perfectly cooked, and the pork was very good. 6 - Shoyu ramen - similar to the miso except a little less sweet. I liked the miso better (my bf thought the opposite) but the shoyu was good as well. Desserts 7 - Soy coconut panna cotta - amazing, this is the best item on their Sunday dessert menu. The soy and coconut are all very subtle, but the flavors combine well with the fruit and it's just an amazing palette cleanser.  8 - Salted caramel cheesecake - pretty good but just a little heavier than what I usually like for dessert 9 - Green tea shortbread - delicious, all of the components (green tea, mango, white chocolate) went together very well Drinks 10 - Apple martini - forgot the name and can't find it on their online menu. It was pretty good, although the apple garnish was a little brown. 11 - Ora(?) beer - I'm not 100% sure this was what my bf ordered, but it was some sort of imported Japanese beer that was pretty interesting and unlike other beers I've tried in the past. Another tip: ramen servings are huge. In the future, I would just get one ramen to share between two people. Overall though, delicious meal. Service was incredibly attentive, even moreso than the first time we were here. I know who I'm cheering for on Top Chef Masters this season.",0.9995,0.711,0.277,0.012,0.5533732193732193

The beef was tender, thinly sliced, beautifully plated, and delicious. The winter roll had a colorful combination of seafood, but was slightly too spicy for my taste, so my date ate most of it.  For dinner, he ordered the bouillabaisse, a slightly spicy and gingery sea food stew. Good, but not great.

I must say it was a very disappointing experience and a very over-priced tasting menu! We sat near the server station, which was extremely awkward. We could over hear the servers talk about us wanting to leave and then would try to get things off the table as soon as possible while rushing the courses and giving cheap wine pours to expedite our stay (meanwhile we spent nearly $120 per person with the wine pairing). While rushing through the courses and dealing with the negative looks and comments from the servers, we tried to enjoy the ""Michelin-star"" quality of the place. The only thing we enjoyed was the complementary veal bread (which I think was complementary because the host, Jason, walked by the table and said something about us needing to be rushed out so he could leave for the night, and we over heard his rude comment). The courses were OK and nothing at all special. I think the bread that came with the pork was almost similar to the frozen kind you could buy at a super market (am convinced its similar!), coupling this with the pork smothered in sauce was awful. Further, the duck was near raw and the fish was OK at best. The only highlight on the food was the ""egg"" desert, which was very good! The wine pours for the tasting menu were very poor and, I think, very overpriced.  We tried to follow-up to the restaurant to tell them about the experience and they didn't even bother to acknowledge us -- a great way to treat your well-paying customers, good job! I'm sure this review will be ""randomly filtered"" as well, but hopefully some folks will find it before going there...we were thoroughly unimpressed by the experience, and very disappointed that the restaurant's management did not even reply or offer to fix the problems!",0.9055,0.804,0.119,0.077,0.6369420519420521
2012-03-30,1.0,"After having spent nearly $270 on dinner for two, I feel that I have a right to complain for the awful experience...I really need to question Michelin for giving out its star - every other Michelin-starred restaurant I went to was a great experience (from the management to the service to the food and wine), I guess they really missed the mark on this one. I should not only say other Michelin-starred restaurants here in Chicago, but other restaurants (Michelin-star and non) in New York, Miami, Philadelphia, San Francisco, etc...I really enjoy food and have never felt so compelled to write a bad review on a restaurant.    First, please do not have anyone sit near the server station upstairs where your patrons, who spend good money on your food, can overhear the servers talking about the guests! After I get a tasting menu with wine pairing, why do I want to hear your servers say how bad they want me to leave and hear about their bs complaints with other patrons in the restaurant! Further, please have your host Jason, act professional (not walking by my table and saying to the servers in the station, like I couldn't over hear: ""they are only on the fourth course, why is the kitchen so slow tonight!"", while we had practically no break in between our courses as the food courses were being dropped every 5 minutes). Second, the food was mediocre at best. Some dishes were OK such as the ""complementary"" veal bread and ""egg"" desert. Outside of those two dishes, the fish, duck, and pork belly did not taste up to par with a Michelin quality restaurant. Food smothered in sauce and served undercooked is not what I expect to pay for. I guess that aside from the veal bread and egg desert, the wine was OK but very small pours, considering having spent $90 on wine pairings for two people!   I wish there was a way to get back the money I spent there. I really really am bummed out over the experience and quality of food/wine. How unfortunate of a use of my money, now I know to not even think about trying the Slurping Turtle and recommending the restaurant to others!

2012-03-28,5.0,"For some reason we haven't been going out much as of late, due to a myriad of reasons. It's super lame. We changed our lameness streak last night by using our Groupon and going out to Takashi. First off, I'm so glad they did a Groupon for this place because Takashi is relatively pricey. Just throwing that out there.  Anyway, we had a res at 7pm on a Tuesday. We showed up, and by the time we were ordering every table in the joint was filled. That's pretty impressive to me...not many places can pack the house on a Tuesday.  Anyway, service was wonderful. They were polite, knowledgeable about the food and could recommend good beverages. Speaking of beverages.... I started off with the ginger lime martini. I love me some ginger (and lime), so I knew I would become fast friends with this drink. And I did. Yay!  For apps, we got the Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly (that came with steamed buns a a daikon salad) and Sautéed Maine Scallops and Soba Gnocchi with trumpet mushrooms. It was safe to say we started off with a bang.  The gnocchi was awesome. It came with 2 medium scallops that were cooked to perfection, homemade gnocchi, trumpet mushrooms all swimming in a rich, creamy parm sauce. It was really fantastic, and perfect for 2 people. We each got a scallop and a few gnocchi. It was rich, but because of the small size, wasn't terribly filling. This left room for our next app... Pork belly buns! It was 3 pieces of soy ginger caramel pork belly, 3 buns, spicy mustard and a salad. You make open faced sammiches with the pork/buns and devour accordingly. This was my husbands favorite part of the meal, and I would tend to agree. The pork belly melted in your mouth like butter, the buns were hot and steamy and the salad was a nice contrast to the rich pork. Absolutely fantastic. For mains, I got the skate wing that came with mushrooms and roasted butternut squash agnolotti and roasted cabbage. I hadn't had skate wing until last night, so I didn't know what to expect. Well, expect awesome. It was thin and crispy on the outside, while it was cooked to medium on the inside. The agnolotti was perfection and the mushrooms were a nice earthy compliment. My description isn't doing this justice. It was amazing. My husband got the osso bucco, which he adored as well. For dessert we got the sheeps milk panna cotta (I'm a sucker for panna cottas and I always get them) with candied kumkquats and a yuzu gelee. Another amazing choice - it was sweet, fruity and mild, as a panna cotta should be. Incredible.  Even with our $40 for $80 groupon, it was another $60 before tip. Totally worth it though - this place is worth it even if we paid full price. We will be back.",0.9987,0.766,0.22,0.015,0.6199652777777778

Secondly, Takashi pretty good, but the ramen doesn't strike me as anything special. Do try the pork belly buns though because they are tasty. The pork belly itself could be a little softer though IMO. The tenderness of their pork runs a bit tough. Aside from that, it had a nice little presentation. I also had the duck fat fried chicken, which was nice but again, tasted like any other fried chicken. This one just happened to have some diced green onions, a small cabbage salad and some dressing with it. I tried the shoyu and miso ramens. The egg noodles were cooked pleasantly (I have this thing with the consistency of my noodles in ramen) and weren't too overdone. Now, one thing about Takashi's ramen that doesn't rub me the right way is the hint of sweetness. I honestly think it comes from the pork that they include in there but by golly, it bothers me. It's still good though, but not eye-popping. Oh yeah...once again, the pork that they include is tough and overcooked. It doesn't compare to other ramen joints. The soup base is nice and clean for all those non-oily ramen lovers! I  personally love oily bases so maybe thats why the ramen doesn't stand out.

The choice is provided by the hostess on the phone. Then we arrived Takashi before 9PM. The hostess checked our reservation and answered ""I don't think you guys coming."" then walked away until another guy took us to the seats.  Anyway, it's the 1st time we were there, but we went to Slurping Turtle several times and heard of that they're kinda related. The most important thing in my mind was reading thru the menu briefly and pick something I like. Between 10 min, the waiter came over asking me ready to order or not 3 times. Also in between my friend went to her car to pick her phone. I told the waiter give me one more minute and he turned around with an angry face. During the whole meal, his behavior made me feel that he was really in a hurry and he didn't even provide us the dessert menu until we asked. His rudeness of asking us with a loud ""What"" made me totally sick. To be honest, I worked as waitress as well and I am always tolerant to service since I know how hard it could be. So I kept telling my friend that he maybe in a bad mood and left 30% gratuity for him.  But as a Michelin standard, I expect more than what I experienced tonight.

We sat down at the bar and chatted up the bartender. I regret not catching his name because he was really welcoming and really knew everything about the menu. He recommended the pork belly & scallop small plates, which ended up being my two favorites...more on that later.  When we were finally seated, we ordered a series of small plates such as the pork belly, scallops, duck confit, hamachi, and oysters. Our server suggested we mix up our hot and cold plates, which ended up working out pleasantly. Hamachi was extremely fresh and worked well with flavors of green grapes and endive. The pork belly and duck confit had little salads on the side that were upstaged by their meaty counterparts. If I wasn't in a nice restaurant, I probably would've gnawed the duck confit to the bone...it was THAT good. The pork belly was a great mixture of fatty, sticky sweet, and savory, just like my momma makes. Unfortunately, my greedy sister snatched up all the scallops in our plate (GRRRRR!!) so I was stuck with trumpet mushrooms and gnocchi. Lucky for her, the sauce was incredibly rich and flavorful, plus the gnocchi/mushroom combination was satisfying. We ended the evening with the chocolate sticky cake, I loved the caramelized bananas and graham cracker ice cream that came with it.  Since parking was a cinch in the area and I've heard good things about their Sunday noodle brunch, I will find any and every excuse to come back here especially since I was so cruelly deprived of scallops (thanks sis)",0.9309,0.794,0.126,0.08,0.578956228956229
2012-02-20,3.0,"I am only rating Takashi based on the Sunday Noodle dinner menu and I will just state up front that I will be going back at some point to try the regularly served menu and will re-evaluate my rating at a later. However, my experience with the Sunday Noodle dinner menu left a bit to be desired. Let's start with the good.  Out of all of the small plates we ordered the one that stood out the most was the spicy octopus and squid salad. The octopus tentacles were exceptionally tender and marinated in a well balanced spicy sesame citrus dressing. The salad also included blanched enoki mushrooms, romain hearts, and garlic chives. There were only a few rings of squid on the plate but the octopus was so good that I didn't really mind. We also ordered the duck fat fried chicken which was pretty good if not exactly what I expected. The coating was exceptionally crispy and the chicken itself was quite tender. However, I couldn't really detect any duck taste added by the frying in duck fat. Also, whatever the 'marinade' was that the menu mentioned didn't do much for the overall flavor. I was expecting a variation of the ginger-sake-soy marinade usually used to season tori karaage (japanese fried chicken). My date ordered the hot soba with tempura and was nice enough to let me try a bit. The soba noodles were strongly buckwheat flavored and had a great texture. The accompanying tempura was fairly good too. Tempura has never been my favorite thing but this was nice and crisp and not too greasy. The soup broth was quite tasty; a nice balance of dashi (fish stock) to kaeshi (soy sauce and mirin base) if perhaps a tad salty. Which brings me to the last dish. I ordered the Shoyu Ramen and found it to pretty disappointing. The noodles themselves were quite good; springy and with the noticeable taste of sodium carbonate. The chashu (simmered pork) was just ok. It was tender enough but the chinese five spice seasoning masked the taste of the meat.  The biggest let down of the dish was the broth. It was very salty. I was really glad that we still had some of the vinegary pickled vegetables on the table that I could use to cut the saltyness of the broth. My dining partner agreed with my assessment and I even heard someone at the table next to us saying the same thing. I am hoping for better things from the regular dinner menu but I would not recommend going to Takashi for ramen.",0.9949,0.832,0.141,0.027,0.524203955086308
2012-02-18,5.0,"Takashi deserves its Michelin star. I had the chef's tasting menu. We got off to a lackluster start with a subpar amuse bouche of house tofu with ginger soy. It was underwhelming, though I must say that I dislike tofu. The meal started with a hamachi-yellowtail crudo. The grape salad, tomatoes, and olives that accompanied the fish were excellent, though I don't really understand why the chef chose to include a few small lumps of what I think was feta cheese.  Second course: Maine lobster served with greens, heart of palm, olives, and a delicious, almost caramel-y vinaigrette.  The third course was a seared scallop served over gnocchi and trumpet mushrooms topped with a celery root foam. This was one of the richest dishes I have eaten in a long time, and also one of the best. I wish I could have had a massive bowl of the gnocchi alone. Fourth we had a pork belly course served in the form of assemble-your-own pork buns. Perfectly steamed buns, a daikon salad, fatty delicious belly, and an excellent horseradish mustard made this dish an instant success. The final entree was a roasted duck breast. It was served with a green bean salad, turnips, and a crispy roll of duck rillette. This dish was very very good, but I found that it struggled to compete with the third and fourth courses.  Desert was a chocolate creme brulee topped with caramel foam. It was served in an eggshell alongside a macaron and a swath of caramel sauce. I would have been happy with just the creme brulee, it was good enough to stand alone. The service was sub-par, to be honest. I feel that the servers could have spent more time explaining dishes and been a litte more attentive, but as long as my food and drink arrives in a timely manner, I really don't care.

The server was nice and everything, but he was so soft spoken that we had to ask him to repeat everything and ended up just kind of giving the blank stare nod having no idea what he said.  2.

2012-01-10,5.0,"We took a return trip to Takashi, this time for their Chicago-famous ""Noodle Sundays."" The 5* rating is from the original (check it out after): their dinner service is fantastic, and the ""Chicken in Clay Pot"" still makes my mouth drool. And hey, did you know Takashi is a Michelin-starred restaurant with a James Beard awarded chef? Well deserved, gents. As for the ""Noodle Sunday"", I'd put the experience at just 4 stars, but I don't want to skew my rating since dinner is what you really should be doing here. If you've been to Takashi, you know the place is small and reservations are hard to come by. We strolled up late with a party of 9, knowing we'd get split up. Stomachs rumbling, our table picked up a couple of apps: the seaweed salad (standard) and the Yelp-approved Duck Fat Fried Chicken. I was a bit disappointed by the chicken: a pretty standard karaage that didn't retain the ""duck fat"" flavor all that well. If you're not a huge braised pork fan, chicken karaage goes well with ramen (see: Katana-Ya in San Francisco). Compared to the inventive dinner menu, the apps listing for Sunday Noodles is rather bland and straightforward. Of course, the star of the show and the reason we came was the ramen, which comes either shoyu, miso, or vegetarian. The vegetarian is a nice option for non-meat eaters. The fiance went miso; I went shoyu. I always prefer shoyu (or tonkotsu) to miso, and the same held true with this broth. But first, the noodles. They were excellent and maybe slightly below par compared to my gold standard, Daikokuya in Los Angeles. Honestly, the hand-pulled noodles were that good. However, the broth was a bit lacking. With shoyu over tonkotsu, making the broth requires a little more ""oomph,"" which just didn't bubble to the surface in Takashi's ramen. The miso, likewise, just wasn't salty enough for my liking. The accompaniments were pretty standard, though I did love the half boiled barbequed egg. That was a nice touch. The price point may also be upsetting to some. The bowl is $13, without the added bonuses of what a $13 bowl of ramen should entail (again, see Katana-Ya in SF). That said, if you think Ippudo in NYC is the gold standard, maybe you'll think of Takashi as cheap. While our table's service was stellar, our friend's table had their ramen order inconveniently misplaced. They were regrettably sorry, and offered a trio of desserts as penance. The desserts looked pretty with Asian flair, though I can't vouch for the taste. If you're an alcoholic, they make some pretty interesting brunch-friendly drinks like a shochu bloody mary. For Chicago standards, Takashi may well be the best there is when it comes to ramen. It certainly beat Takashi's casual Noodles outlet in the Macy's food court, both in taste and price.

In my experience, its tough to screw up scallops, but tougher to make them uniquely awesome, Takashi has succeeded in this endeavor. I also could not get enough of the crudo, mostly because its the closely thing I got to sashimi. They also serve Hitachino, which pairs quite well with Japanese inspired food The other dishes were good but not terribly memorable.

The sum of the matter is it was pretty decent food but overpriced and left all in my party with an upset stomach. I have to preface this that I was coming in straight from the airport, and to top it off we got lost finding the place. It's located right next to ""Le Bouchon"" in a nondescript gray door.

I felt that this dish captures the fusion idea of he restaurant well however it was a bit too salty for my taste. -Soy Seasame Beef Tartare- I love beef tartare. The presentation was great and the criss cross cut potato chips were cute. I think this this was just okay.  3 Mains: -Chicken in clay pot - Normally I do not get chicken but I was intrigued by the promise of yuzu citrus - which is always a yum!. The chicken was juicy and I love mushrooms - especially when they soak up the flavor. This particular dish's portion is huge and warm. If I do go again I'll probably end up ordering this dish again. -Red wine braised short ribs and roasted skirt steak - really, really salty. I have to say I was a bit disappointed with this dish.  -Salmon trio - I forget the actual name but this dish was only okay. The first salmon looked like a fried mozzarella cheese stick and was just okay. The smoked was pretty decent. The best was the grilled salmon which just tasted like salmon. The portions were small but filling. Did we come at the wrong time? I just thought the restaurant that was so raved as Takashi would have tasted better. Food was decent - too salty; but everyone complained about being gassy afterwards. 3 stars or me. I would return if others want to go back but not on my own volition.",0.997,0.736,0.206,0.057,0.5482995055945876

Nothing disappointed.  We had arguments about what we would order 2 things off instead of getting 1 of each from the 4 courses with a choice.  Since we couldn't decide, Takashi gets 5 stars.   Although everything was great, highlights were: Vanilla bean poached Maine lobster, served over a butternut squash ravioli Foie Gras with a delicious compote of quince and gooseberries Roasted Venison with a chestnut puree and celery root fondue  Roasted Washygu Beef with a potato mousseline and winter vegetables  Yuzu Panna Cotta with caramelized kumquats Will definitely come back and try some of the other favorites from the menu, I now have full faith that Takashi can do no wrong.  Slurping turtle has also been bookmarked :)   Summary - great food, excellent service and romantic atmosphere - run, don't walk.",0.9684,0.775,0.167,0.058,0.6124999999999999

Chicken is cooked so well that even the chicken breast (usually very dry) is so juicy and tender. The side of shimeji mushrooms, eggplant, haricot adds more flavor and whole dish is just so yummy! 2.

2011-12-30,2.0,"Took a friend here for her bday thinking michelin star + french/japanese style food...can't go wrong... right? wrong! LOCATION: This is a conversion in bucktown so it basically looks like someone's house on the outside, and feels just as small on the inside. There is a pretty much non-existent entry way/hostess area, which leads right into stairs going to upstairs dining, so it's very awkward if you are waiting for a table right at the door (and cold in November). There is a bar area, but also super super small. I am willing to overlook feeling like a cold sardine for quality food and service, so we rolled with it.  SEATING: We were luckily seated in a booth upstairs which was in it's own little enclave next to the waiters' service area, which was really nice and semi-private. I would have been very unhappy with any of the other seating upstairs because the tables (mostly two tops) were very very close to each other. The downstairs seating was a little better spaced out, but way way too close to the door, unless it's summer in chi, I wouldn't want to be seated anywhere downstairs either.  FOOD: No doubt this place serves stellar food. Everything we ordered was mouth-wateringly delicious. Foi gras, gnocchi, octopus salad, were some of our favorites. Definitely go here for the food.  SERVICE: Definitely do not go here for the service. How disappointing that I have had better service at a lettuce entertain you restaurant than at Takashi (which has a Michelin Star).. seriously. Service was horrendous. Very very rushed, very inattentive, and almost condescendingly rude. Entrees were not brought out at the same time, none of the dishes were explained when brought to the table, service was scattered, we had to request utensils ourselves, they forgot to bring out items we requested numerous times including drinks and food, and servers were rude. If I wanna get bitch slapped by my server, I'll go to ed debevics. I expected way way more, takashi needs to take a page from a place like MK where service actually means something. With the prices they are charging, they definitely need to straighten out their service.  If this review was based on food alone, this place would hands down get five stars.

I started with the Strudel of Walnuts, Pumpkin Seeds and Squash with Apple Salad Golden Raisin, Maytag Blue Cheese, Persimmons, Cider-Maple Vinaigrette; this was delicious, but the persimmons seemed unripe and the salad and the strudel were served apart, though I ate them together. Then I had the pork belly; was good, just maybe a little too sweet. My entree was the skate wing. It was in a caper sauce and it was so salty...such a shame because it was crispy and cooked well otherwise. The side of squash anglotti was comforting and creamy without being heavy. On the other side was a pile of chanterelles. Aside from the salt it was good a good entree, but I'm not sure I get how it all went together.

The best dishes are those with an element of surprise. Overall, I get a sense that the kitchen is very professional and innovative.  A few notes on service and atmosphere might be more helpful....I have had excellent service both times I've dined at Takashi. Both nights were very busy, and yet everything was prompt, clean, polite, and there was a sense that I was very well cared for. But that's all to be expected at a place like this. What makes them stand out in my mind is that they have always gone above and beyond in small ways to make our night special and have been more than accommodating.  For example, the first time we got the prix fixe menu, and when my dessert arrived, I realized that it was not something that would interest me at all, and when I made the comment to my boyfriend that we should just switch desserts, the waiter came and asked what was wrong. When he found out that I saw my dessert as very unappetizing, he brought out a different dessert for me free of charge, and left the extra dessert for my boyfriend to finish.  Also, we had a rather late reservation and we like to linger on our food and take our time, so we were there for almost 3 hours without even thinking about it, but we never once felt rushed or that we were being a bother. Everyone was warm, courteous, and accommodating. Finally, last week when we were there, we ordered an extra dish to go in between our prix fixe courses, and they brought out a complimentary wine pairing for us because they thought it was so important to have the wine with the dish.

2011-10-16,3.0,"Just back from my first meal at Takashi; the food was very good, but the ambiance and overall experience was far from what I expected. Had I not known in advance that this was a Michelin star restaurant I would have sworn somebody was pulling a fast one on me if they would have told me so. That said, I was there for the ""Sunday Noodles"" menu so I imagine the atmosphere is far more casual here on Sundays and the clientele far more diverse. That there was recently a Groupon for this location probably did not help.  When we walked in the first sight was of an infant seated at the table near the entrance. We kept our fingers crossed we would not  be seated next to this table and fortunately were escorted upstairs. The tables are rather close together, but at first everything seemed nice. Our waiter promptly came over and took our cocktail orders (there is a very nice cocktail menu, decent wine list and handful of beers). I went with their version of a Bloody Mary, the Bloody Marika (which was not bad, but needed more of a kick).  The Sunday Noodles Dinner features about twenty small plates to choose from and about a half dozen soups (comprised of noodles of course).  Many of the small plates sounded appealing and my wife and I ended up splitting seven of them. I was expecting small portions and was pleasantly surprised that they were quite generous. All of the small plates were tasty, and the one titled ""Pork Belly Snack"" was literally one of the best appetizers I have had (and definitely the highlight of the meal).  The main courses were also nice and large and far from what one conjectures when they envision Ramen noodles from childhood.  The broth was flavorful and there were all sorts of vegetables and goodies along with the noodles. Neither of us were able to finish our noodles and left quite full. For future reference, two small plates and a noodle dish per/person probably would have been a more suitable quantity of food, but I was glad to have been able to have sampled several of the small plates since they were quite good. The shrimp tempura and the Angus beef tartar with quail egg also stood out. The price was quite reasonable for the quality of the food; prior to tax/tip our table came to $91 for the seven appetizers, two noodle dishes, a cocktail and  a tea.   Unfortunately halfway into our appetizers, a group of four obviously intoxicated women staggered into the dining area and were seated at a nearby table. The rest of our evening consisted of listening to them curse, hoot and holler and discuss different kinds of shots they had consumed earlier in the day. On one occasion when the waiter approached them he asked where one of them had went and one of the missing woman's tablemates informed the waiter that she had gone to the bathrom to throw up. Not exactly the ambiance I was expecting, and despite the good food this definitely put a significant damper on the evening and caused us to rush through the rest of our meal (we wound up being in and out in just under an hour despite ordering seven appetizers and the noodles). It would have been nice if some limits had been set on the behavior of these unruly women. In addition to the drunakrds, at another nearby table was a man chatting away on his cell phone and leaving a final bad taste in my mouth, when we left not a single employee said goodbye to us; again not at all what I was expecting based on Takashi's reputation and status as being a Michelin star recipient.  Based on the quality of the food I would be interested in returning to Takashi to try their regular menu (as I would expect the ambiance would be much different on other nights), but the negatives of what occurred during our meal tonight do not have a return here a top priority.

2011-09-20,5.0,"It's been a couple of months since I ate here. Some of the details are a little fuzzy, but the awesomeness is still fresh in my brain. Like (apparently) half of the people who bought a Groupon for Takashi, we waited until the last minute to use it. We made reservation for late evening on a weeknight.  We arrive a little early for our reservation. My only complaint is that there is really nowhere to wait. The entry is small, as is the bar area.   After were seated, I looked over the menu noticing that there were a couple veg-friendly small plates, but no main ones. We asked and were told that there was a vegetable plate and given a description of it. We ordered the fresh tofu app, the vegetable plate and hubby ordered a couple of small plates.  The tofu arrived. It was very soft and delicate. It came with a variety of items that could be eaten with it or mixed in. Our server, very conscious of my veggie-ism, offered to take it away and bring a new side tray back without bonito flakes. It was nice of her to offer, but since the flakes were on their own and not mixed with anything else, I said it was fine.  I was a little nervous about my dinner. A ""vegetable plate"" conjures memories from other restaurants of steamed cauliflower and carrots, over cooked squash and just yuck. They should never call this a vegetable plate. They're doing it a disservice. It was awesome. Sadly I can't remember the exact details of what was in the dish, but if you're a veg and you order it you won't be sorry. I ate every last bit of it and wanted more.  The hubby was also very happy with his order I'll also say that our service was very good, despite the fact that the restaurant was (I'm sure) more crowded for much longer than it normally would have been on a weeknight. I could tell our server was tired, but she still did a great job.  I definitely would go back to Taksashi.",0.9824,0.843,0.116,0.042,0.5159713413201785

This last Sunday I went for their Ramen noodles for lunch. I order miso ramen and my friend order the veggie tofu. Mine came out and was acceptable ramen (I've had the real deal in Japan so really to me nothing can compare to being drunk at 4 am and having ramen). That being said mine was pretty good. My friends on the other hand was completely overcooked and no broth. She wasn't sure about it but I knew it was wrong and had it sent back. The bowl was much better. My friend felt embarrassed but at $13 a bowl it had better be damn near perfect for a simple bowl of ramen.  They made great food and fixed the issue.

2011-08-14,5.0,"WOW! That was our mutual response as we departed this restaurant following a Sunday dinner here. After having heard raving reviews for Takashi, I have to say I was expecting to be somewhat unfulfilled as usually is the case when your expectations are sky high for a restaurant. Chef Takashi, however, delivered enough juice to fill those expectations and then proceeded to blow them out of the water. This place is pretty unassumingly located in a little house off of Damen, you'd never think it was a Michelin star restaurant if you just walked past it. There's nothing fancy about the setup of this place, it is a cozy little restaurant, cozy in all the right ways. I can't speak for the regular menu but the Sunday dinner menu is composed for noodles and small dishes. Service: servers were very attentive and friendly, I felt sometimes they knew what  I needed before I even did, +1. Food: 1) Cold Tofu- cold tofu served on ice with a plateful of condiments delicately arranged on a rectangular plate. The presentation was only bested by the taste. Simple and yet ridiculously good. 2) Beef tartare- served with a raw quail egg on top and perfectly seasoned, this one was gone in a matter of seconds. 3) Duck fat fried chicken- the only dish i was somewhat disappointed on, it wasn't as good as the other dishes we ordered this night and although some of the best friend chicken I've ever had, it was still just that, fried chicken. 4) Pork belly snack- Oh... My.... this was insanely good. I've had my share of pork belly cooked in a great variety of ways, I dare say when it comes to one meat I'm familiar with both cooking and eating, pork belly is it. The way this was cooked and paired with the steamed bun was pretty much spot on perfect. I definitely wanted more. 5) Udon with tempura- a perfect way to end our meal. the noodles were deliicious some of the best I've ever had, that is including some of the well-respected noodle houses in Tokyo. The tempura is definitely worth adding on to the noodles as you can have either just the udon by itself or with tempura on the side. Overall: one of the best meals I've ever had bar none.

2011-08-06,4.0,"Yum yum awesome yum. Takashi is one of my dad's favorite restaurants and is living proof that he has great taste. Takashi is a James Beard award winning chef and his namesake restaurant is a beacon of French/Japanese fusion. Delectable flavors served in a minimalist setting that's upscale yet unpretentious, where you can easily wear jeans or a dress.  We dined on a recent summer evening outside on the patio.  The service is friendly. Our servers and the maitre'd both had incredibly detailed knowledge of every menu item, including which wines would pair best with which dishes. Great cocktail list too.

I'm a huge fan of japanese cuisine,unfortunately in Chicago japanese food is usually limited to sushi (with the exception of a few restaurants - cheezakaya, bonsoiree, iNG), so I was really excited when I saw Takashi's menu.  I had the vegetarian ramen dish, it was tasty and flavorful. I was afraid it was going to be too salty, because i read some other reviews that complained about too much salt  - however it didn't seem to bother me.   The portions are huge, i barely made a dent.

Overall, I thought the ramen was just mediocre especially at 13 bucks a bowl.  If you're looking for good ramen, I would skip this place and try Mitsuwa or one of those other japanese places out in the burbs.  It'll prob taste better and be cheaper!",0.9716,0.88,0.115,0.005,0.5720663265306122

2011-07-01,3.0,"**sad face** BF used to live right around the corner from here, so a full two years later, we decided to walk the mile or so from our new digs to check this place out. They were able to accommodate us at the bar at around 8:30 on a saturday, so that was definitely nice.  The bartender was a bit spastic and seemed to have to go google how to make a sidecar when I ordered it, which was strange. Ultimately, what made us decide to come in was a friend recommending the calamari.  Perhaps there was a misunderstanding, because there was an octopus salad, but no calamari.  We got the octopus and the tuna carpaccio to start.  The tuna was lovely, although somewhat difficult to eat with chopsticks.  The octopus was billed as ""spicy"" when I would describe the dressing more as ""zesty"" than spicy.  I found some of the octopus to be a little under-done which give me a mild gag-response to slimy suction-cuppy sea creatures.  The salad overall was ok, but it was topped with fried lotus root which is kind of a pet peeve of mine with ""asian"" cuisine in the states.  Lotus root is so beautiful and crisp when raw, but everyone seems to want to fry the heck out of it and destroy the texture.   --Anyway-- For our main dishes we had the scallops and the pheasant.  The scallops were ok, i would have preferred them to be a bit more caramelized.  The foam was simply visual trickery, I tasted no parmigian nor celery root.  I found the soba gnocchi to be quite gummy and a bit unpleasant.  The mushrooms, however, were delightful. Here's where Negative Nancy takes her smoke break. The pheasant was DIVINE.  The risotto with favas was amazing, morel mushrooms, I mean give me a break!  Delicious!  The meat itself was delicious and well cooked as well. Now, for dessert we had the panna cotta.  SHUT THE FRONT DOOR.  It was so good.  Probably some of the best panna cotta I've had.  The texture was just right, firm, but not like jello, still quite creamy, and the flavor was amazing.  The yuzu gelee on top was quite firm, but still incredibly delicious and so citrusy and fresh.  The green tea shortbread was green, yes, but did not really taste like green tea.  But it was excellent short bread, so it didn't really  matter.  Even BF ate about half the panna cotta, and he is SO not a dessert person.  The candied kumquats on top were just perfect.

2011-06-24,5.0,"I guess Erica and I need to eat out more because it took us six months to find another restaurant serving 4 Star meals (Maude's Liquor Bar). We went to Takashi this week and indulged on their 6-course tasting menu to celebrate my birthday (again but privately) as well as my return to the working world. It should be no surprise that a Michelin Star restaurant is fantastic and one of the best meals we've had in town, but it's even better when great reviews and awards are validated on the plate. It's a ""cute"" and tiny space built out of an old house, with two floors of dining. Erica noticed the grey and white paint and wants to copy it in our apartment now. Our server and staff also were top notch and performed on the same the level as the chef and food. The entire dining experience is very well coordinated and thought out with delicious food as the star attraction. An added bonus is that we ate during a large thunderstorm which only adds to the romantic and ""at home"" setting. Takashi is described as Asian influenced French/American style cuisine. I agree completely and think it's a unique angle that no one else can perform. The menu is large enough to have options but not overwhelming that you lose focus. Since we were in a celebratory mood and didn't' want to have to choose, we ordered the six course tasting menu ($69). There's a wine pairing offered but we weren't that thirsty. The courses were an amuse bouche, Carpaccio of big eye tuna, ceviche (shrimp, squid, hokkaido scallops and octopus), sauteed maine scallop and soba gnocchi, pork belly, roasted duck, and The Egg. There are no substitutions allowed, but we were lucky and the chef allowed Erica to swap out the duck for skate wing. The amuse bouche was lightly seasoned salmon with ricotta cheese and greens. At first it was a little underwhelming and bland, but reflecting back on the entire meal it was exactly the right mixture of subtle flavoring and just enough to awake the palate for the show that followed. One of my favorite courses was the tuna carpaccio. I love raw tuna and this was divine - served with a umami soy and sesame oil dressing with cabbage and pickled gobo. The tuna melted in your mouth and all the flavors worked in harmony. The portion was plenty big but I could have ordered and finished about 10 more (something to remember for a la carte ordering)  The third course was Erica's least favorite, but that doesn't mean it wasn't tasty (kind of got scared of the octopus :). The serving is ceviche of shrimp, squid, hokkaido scallops and octopus in a sweet and light citrus broth. There's a lot going on in the plate, but the flavors are crisp and light. You almost feel cheated by the first few courses since they are not too large and straightforward, but it's all part of the overall progression of the meal. If the ceviche was Erica's least favorite, the scallop and gnocchi was her most favorite. The presentation is fun with celery root-parmesan foam hiding the show. Underneath is a delicious sauteed Maine scallop served with soba gnocchi and trumpet royale mushrooms. I loved the scallop and gnocchi combination and couldn't get enough of the creamy cheesy sauce. I'm not a huge mushroom fan, and these were quite strong, but they fit the dish and complemented the other parts well. It's another menu item I would highly recommend a la carte.  My favorite dish of the night was the pork belly. Usually I don't order pork belly so I was curious what would arrive. What we got was a make your own steamed bun pork belly sandwich. The soy-ginger caramel sauce was divine and I loved the steamed bun with a hint of wasabi. The pickled daikon salad is also a great addition and made my ""sandwich"" complete. You only get two but I certainly would have consumed 10. The best pork belly dish I've ever had. If there was a main course I guess it was the roasted Indiana duck breast and seared quebec foie gras. Again, I'm not a huge duck or foie gras fan, but this was quite tasty. It's served with candied kumquats and rhubarb in a port-huckleberry beet reduction. The duck was tender and perfectly cooked with many interesting flavors to combine it with. I also thought the presentation was beautiful as the beet juices flowed around the plate. If you forgot where Chef Takashi was formally trained, this dish would bring you back. The final desert course was The Egg. It's a hollowed out egg shell with a three layer attack of milk chocolate créme brulée, maple syrup, maldon sea-salt and caramel custard foam on top. You have to be careful with the spoon not to break the egg, but the sweet flavors are a perfect way to end the meal without overwhelming the palate. Sometimes I'm in the mood for a huge desert of bread pudding or ice cream or what have you, but after five delicious and adventurous courses I want a sweet dessert but not a huge dessert. On the side are fun little blood orange macaroons.",0.9996,0.751,0.206,0.043,0.5833192379515907

The noodle menu was pretty much the same as that at Noodles by Takashi (on the 7th floor of Macy's on State street, which we have been to many times before since we live closer to downtown).

2011-05-16,3.0,"Had a chance to dine at Takashi and unfortunately, my high, (very high) expectations were not met.  I value Yelp and saw the huge scores this Michelin rated joint pulled down and I was ready for an awe inspiring event so Takashi had a lot to live up to.    Well, it was good, but not over-the-top good.  To start,  the bread service was poor--a place of this caliber should be better.  But hey, we were here for the Japanese fusion so not the end of the world.   We dined on the Big Eye Tuna Carpacio and it was ok; however,  the flavors didn't' hit--in my humble opinion the garlic chip was too overpowering but then who am I??  Gave the cold octopus salad a try and same, just OK. Tried another item from the hot plate side of the menu and can't remember :o(  and ended with the chicken in the clay pot which was nothing to write home about.  Service was great and very attentive.  The tables are this */* close together so be prepared to have your dining neighbors hear all your secrets.    I'd go back just to see if we caught Takashi on an off night--I sure hope the was the case.",0.9883,0.809,0.177,0.014,0.6077911111111111

Takashi definitely kicked G&tG's ass, from the relaxing ambience to the amazing food. We were seated upstairs in a booth that had pillows (hello, SWEET!), and the waiter was extremely helpful...never overbearing. The cocktail I had was extremely strong which is always a plus as most places try to rip you off on the drinks. We started with the pork belly steamed buns, escargot, fois gras, and steak tartar. All was amazing, but I especially LOVED the fois gras (sooo decadent! perfectly prepared!) and the steak tartar topped with a quail egg. MMM. The wasabi crusted steak was also a stand out as well as the risotto that accompanied the pheasant...to die for!! Takashi is delicious and a great spot to take a date (not so much girl and the goat...we practically had to scream across the table). I can't wait to go back!

2011-05-02,3.0,"This place is inconsistent. Went three weeks ago on a Sunday and enjoyed it so much we returned last night. The margaritas were the worse I have ever had, particularly since they went through the trouble of not using mix.  I think they forgot the orange liquor that was listed in the description. The starters were good, but not great.  Tofu was delicious.  The gyoza were good, not great.  The fried chick lacked the marinated flavor that we experienced during our last visit.  The croquettes were excellent.  The pickled veggies were also excellent. If one thing is consistent here, it's the noodles.  I would say that the Urban Belly has noodles that are just as good, but I believe that the broth here is better. Service here is so laid back, that it's not hip and cool, it's just mediocre.  And the host was a jerk, offering us what was clearly the worse table upstairs despite the place being near empty at the time of our arrival. Also, the space is somewhat minimalist, but not in a good way.  Seems that both service and space are not in alignment with the type of food being served.  Also, upstairs got really LOUD.

The scallops and gnocchi recommended by others was certainly the most flavorful and well-prepared dish we tried. The main course of pheasant was dry and, though the accompanying risotto was good, it did not compensate. In their defense, the waitress had informed us that ""pheasant is a dry bird"" but, honestly, they should take it off the menu if it chews  like jerky. The salmon was overcooked and flavorless. One of the dark chocolate desserts was quite good (not the one with bananas - we both found that inedible due to the odd flavor and texture combination).

2011-04-14,4.0,"I look forward to a time in which Tuesday dinners can be as delicious and lavish as the one Aaron and I had this week at Takashi. One's still shaking off the grogginess of the early-week blues at that point; the work rhythm is about to reach its hump-day climax. Who doesn't want to enjoy a beautiful Japanese meal with a good friend and a decent (though, ahem, watery!) cocktail? The meal started coolly, and not only because they brought out our cold dishes first. A plate of tuna sashimi was rather flavorless; this was a combination of the fish itself and the neutral-flavored root vegetable and cabbage it was garnished with. The homemade tofu bowl reminded me of a savory sundae bar -- it arrived in an iced-down bowl and a plate of greens, bonito flakes, soy sauce, and a miso-like paste. We dutifully mixed in the ingredients and attempted to split a gelato-like bowl of tofu with our chopsticks. The flavor was great, but the delivery -- no spoon? -- was off. The third time was indeed the charm -- our middle plate, the beautiful play on pork buns, arrived glistening with glaze and sided with perfectly-formed slices of dense, crustless bun. The meat was tender, the bun was a pure-white flavor sponge that cradled the salad and pork. Each bite filled me with happiness -- or perhaps I was just a few too many sips in to my Lost in Translation (good-quality scotch and ginger syrup, or so they claimed; it only tasted watery to me). Apparently it is scallop season. Every scallop-buttoned plate I have had in recent months has been nothing short of excellent -- tender, flavorful, with a melt-in-your-mouth quality that is so unique to the beloved bivalve. The scallop dish at Takashi bordered on Italian, but I didn't mind at all. The beautiful parmesan foam sheltered the browned scallops, which rested upon pillows of gnocchi and (okay, they were rather tough) trumpet mushrooms. This really was a fantastic dish. Great flavors; great texture interplay; great visual appeal. Next to our mollusk friends sat their land-lubber cousins -- the escargot. I'd only had snail in China, where it's served with a huge shell in a broth and not-elegantly removed with whatever tools on hand -- or with one's hands, even. These plump, black nuggets of goodness -- mild goodness, sure, but goodness nonetheless -- were surrounded by potatoes of three varieties and some playful squirts of tame sauce. It was good -- a good preparation of escargot, I'd say -- but not great. We passed on dessert because by then we'd really gone over our Tuesday budgets, Aaron and I. But it was worth it. And it has made all the difference as far as the rest of the week went.",0.9986,0.771,0.203,0.026,0.5759637188208616
2011-04-14,4.0,"What a great night out. The tasting menu at Takashi is really an excellent evening out.... it's a tasting that is a wonderful overview of the menu without leaving you feeling so stuffed you're going to explode at the end of the meal. The ceviche of shrimp, squid, hokkaido scallops & octopus features a yuzu sauce that might be the most delicious thing I've ever tasted. This dish is amazing. The soba gnocchi is an interesting dish; one of my friends insisted that do NOT leave Takashi without trying it because she swears up and down that it's her favorite dish on the Chicago restaurant scene. For me; the scallop was cooked perfectly but I just couldn't get into the gnocchi. I'm admittedly a HUGE pasta snob, and I regularly make gnocchi with my mom and my nona. I will probably never be able to objectively review a gnocchi dish, because if it didn't come out of my nona's kitchen, it's just not as good to me. But I digress..... the pork belly and the duck are delicious but 2 rich dishes in a row. I really savored the pork but then was a little overwhelmed by the duck. The ""egg"" dessert was perfection, a small bite of creme brulee adorably served inside an eggshell and a scrumptious french macaron.  The ambiance at Takashi is really lovely. Definitely definitely make a reservation, as the space is small. I can't imagine that they take very many walk ins. I will say that there was a 4-top table of ridiculously drunk and loud middle aged folks seated behind us.... I know Takashi has little control over this but it got to the point that we could even tell the waiters were laughing at them. I'm not really factoring this into my review because obviously their money is as green as mine and I don't expect Takashi to not serve them, but it definitely got to the point of being awkward.

We could only get a reservation for 5pm, so we weren't that hungry since we had thrown down some greek food at Greek Islands at 2pm. So we decided that instead of ordering entrees, we'd order a variety of cold and hot plates. For my drink, I had the shochu grapefruit cocktail which was light and very refreshing. My husband had the honey pomegranate martini which was a bit heavier. I preferred my drink, but he seemed to enjoy his. Anyways, we ordered the big eye tuna carpaccio, oysters, beef tartare, octopus salad, scallops with soba gnocchi and the foie gras with huckleberries. The big eye tuna was okay but the flavors lacked subtlety. I mostly tasted sesame oil. The oysters were delicious and the kumquat and yuzu were a great combination. I could tell the oysters were very fresh too. We loved the beef tartare and the octopus salad. Those were our favorites of the evening. Great flavor and a little heat in the octopus salad. The beef tartare was very sumptuous and melted in my mouth. The scallops and gnocchi were tasty..had had them before when we came here the first time. The sauce is very creamy and rich...would be great to dip bread in. The foie was kind of disappointing. I love foie, but this foie wasn't that amazing. The huckleberries and other things on the plate were overly sweet and didn't really bring out the fattiness of the foie. My favorite foie gras in Chicago is still the foie at longman & eagle (with the funnel cake and hot chocolate).

So, I tried a Jap beer akin to Miller or Bud lite, and concentrated on food.  We had the shoyu ramen and the udon niku-tamago toge, followed by the green tea shortbread and salted caramel cheesecake. With the desserts I indulged in their St. Germain, cava and soda cocktail. It was delicious, and the perfect sweet treat to pair with the desserts.

2011-04-10,4.0,"This is a much delayed review on Takashi, one of my favorite Chicago restaurants. I admire the chef to come to the midwest, after enjoying much fave in the famous Vegas restaurant, Okada at the Wynn.  Chef Takashi presents gentle yet alluring culinary creations that is not over the top. I love the home-y feel of his restaurant, which also come from his experience as a interior designer. Chicken in a clay pot reminds me of my trips to Japan. His food is modest, yet always delicious.  The drink menu is excellent. A variety of wines, beers and sake are on the menu. If you are confused as to which sake is dryer or sweeter, simply ask your server. One of the things I enjoy the most is Sunday ramen at Takashi. When most Americans think of Japanese food, we think sushi and sashimi. When Japanese people are asked to put a face to their national food identity, it is undoubtedly ramen. Chef Takashi brings together ramen styles from different parts of Japan to give us Chicagoans a chance to slurp on. I would like shio ramen to be on the menu, but the miso ramen and udon selections are quite good - and for a great price too. This restaurant gets great marks in my books - finally a good review.",0.9899,0.795,0.187,0.018,0.5842857142857142

My friend and I went here with my Groupon and left happy and full without feeling overstuffed (thank goodness). We went on Noodle Sunday and I would definitely go back on non-noodle day too. There is a mix of small plates (both hot and cold) and entrees on the menu. We split three small plates (similar to tapas size dishes) and one entree and that was more than enough for us both. We both absolutely, head over heels loved the duck fat fried chicken. Seriously, order it, it's amazing and perfectly cooked. We also got prosciutto-chicken coquettes, which look like little mushroom caps and those were good too. The pork belly snack was also delish, bringing me back to baos and peking duck at Sun Wah. Those are great memories. For entree, we got the shoyu ramen with braised pork and the BBQ egg. I have to say, this was another one of my favorite dishes. The noodles were delicate and tasty with the broth and meat without tasting or feeling too salty. If anything, I wish there was more meat in the ramen, but that's it. Finally, we splurged and got dessert, which was salted caramel cheesecake. I know you might be thinking it'll look like Eli's or more standard cheesecake but this has a Sara Lee no bake feel and really, it was delicious. Came with caramel, cookie bits and fresh fruit. Really tasty and the perfect amount to share. I'm really glad I got to go here and try some amazing food. I will absolutely go back, if nothing else but for that duck fat fried chicken.

I'll say this for my pros: the setting is cute - it seems like they just redid an old house, but the lighting is good, the colors are subtle, and it feels cozy. The appetizers are wonderful - I had the pork belly, and my husband had the hot and sour soup, and we both licked our plates. I was surprised as to how big they were. Looking back, I wish I had ordered a second appetizer as my meal as the portion was more than enough, and there were many more choices (7 hot and 7 cold choices). On the cons: the food was slow - it took just a little longer than it should have. But the service was great, it just seemed like the kitchen wasn't working at its top pace. Also, the entrees were limited in choice - just 6 to choose from - and none seemed that exciting. My husband got the pheasant dish, and it all seemed a bit heavy to go together. I got the wasabi strip steak. You couldn't really taste the wasabi, and it was overall just fine.

I ordered the hot inaniwa udon, and the bf ordered the classic Tokyo style ramen. A fairly long wait ensued, which I didn't mind, but the adjoining table started loudly yelling about the delay and service.

Crazy awkward, especially considering that the first floor dining area is pretty cozy, so everyone got to hear the complaints. As far as the ramen went, I wasn't blown away.

We tried the Sunday desserts, the salted caramel cheesecake and the green tea shortbread, and both were wonderful, beautifully plated, and had interesting Asian components. Definitely try the desserts! The interior is nice, albeit a little tight. Seems like it's in a reconverted house. Waitstaff were pretty solid.

From the old home on Damen converted into a elegant, yet comfortable is a dining experience. The service is exceptional (my water glass was routinely filled and our waiter was genial and polished) and I felt utterly comfortable at my upstairs table (comfort is not usually associated with a Michelin star restaurant, but here elegance mingles easily with comfort). The food was amazing. Decadent yet somehow still light a quality that must come from the mix of traditional Japanese ingredients with the French techniques. Though all the entrees looked amazing, my friend and I opted to try a mix of the small plates the result of a 2.5 hour dining experience that was a custom 5-course tasting. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu, but I LOVED the octopus salad (beautiful presentation to boot), the scallops with gnocchi (this is a great dish to share), the bao buns with pork belly (the dish will melt in your mouth!), and the duckadent foie gras (thank you for the recommendation Chicago Magazine!) I was utterly satisfied with my experience here and cannot wait to return. I stepped out of the dining room momentarily to visit the restroom and when I re-entered I was greeted by the most amazing smells. I don't know that I've experienced anything like this before.

Scallops with soba noodles and tuna carpaccio for the starters. Salmon and pheasant for the main course. We were thrilled with all of it. The menu was just right -- enough variety to make for some tough decisions but still a relatively limited choice set so that you didn't feel overwhelmed. The service was quite good. They couldn't seat us until 40 minutes after our reservation time, which wasn't great especially in their cramped entrance way and nearly non-existent bar area, but they were most apologetic about it and comped us a dessert as well. Our server was enthusiastic and knowledgeable.

Gyoza had great flavor but the wonton wrapper was a little soft, maybe too much moisture in the filling.  The noodles were perfectly cooked and the broth was rich and deep.  The bartender told me Takashi has their noodles custom-produced by a company in Cali according to the chef's own recipe. The only disappointment was the pork which was too thickly cut in my opinion and reminded me a little of Jewish brisket. I tried a green tea shortbread dessert which was also great, the white chocolate moose was a standout.

This one I can still recreate course-by-course, and will remember for a long time.  We went to a one-night-only special meal prepared by Chef Takashi and his old friend, Chef Masaharu Morimoto of Iron Chef fame.     First Course: Tuna pizza-Big Eye tuna with anchovy aioli. Tasty, well balanced, not too overwhelmingly anchovy to start the meal.     Second Course: Prosciutto, scallop, salmon, and octopus sushi, served not on rice but on buffalo mozzarella cheese. Awesome. The mozzarella worked perfect with all four items. Why hasn't anyone served me this dish before? The mozzarella changed both the texture and the flavor of each item. Simple idea, tasted fabulous.     Third Course: Seared foie gras with wasabi and soy-dashi. The dashi was a bit thick and stood up well with the foie gras. Again, new flavor combinations (for me) with an interesting lack of variety in the consistence. Yummy.     Fourth Course: Chef Morimoto's famous Angry Chicken, a tandoori chicken with lentils and crispy rice noodles. It was the first moist, juicy tandoori chicken I've ever had. Also delicious and memorable.     Fifth Course: Braised pork belly, scallop congee, and crispy burdock. Chef Takashi's pork belly dishes are always delicious, and this was no exception.     Dessert: Three desserts. A kobosu creme brulee that was very good. A stick of white asparagus coated in dark chocolate - good, but the asparagus was overwhelmed by the chocolate. Then the worst dessert I think I've ever tasted - a piece of smoked salmon heavily coated in sugar, next to beet sorbet. Now I like beets - but not in my sorbet! I had a taste of both the salmon and the sorbet, and let the remainder go back to the kitchen. Japanese cuisine's reputation as NOT being a place for desserts remains intact.  Both chefs roamed both floors of the restaurant, visiting and discussing the dishes.

When we sat down we noticed that the noodles came in huge bowls so we decided to split a noodle bowl and order a bunch of small plates vs. ordering two noodle dishes.  Turned out to be an awesome decision so we can taste a bunch more dishes without over stuffing ourselves.   So we ended up having: Duck fat fried chicken -- perfectly cooked and seasoned... crispy, succulent and juicy at the same time... Spicy octopus salad -- yummy if octopus is your thing.... and it was ours! Maguro sashimi -- the carpaccio tasted AMAZING... though it was tiny at 3 and a half slices.. wish there were more slices of the yummy tuna Angus Beef Tartare -- Surprisingly, this was probably my favorite of the 4 small plates.  Awesome balance of sweet and salty.. It was DEE-licious Silky Tofu & Mushroom Ramen -- Absolutely heavenly!!! It really was THAT good... I have no idea how the Chef is able to create such a rich and complex broth without using any animal product. Genius! The only reason I didn't give it a 5 stars is because of the price.  I think the meal is priced fairly for what you get but it certainly wasn't a value.  That said, I had awesome time and the food was absolutely delicious.  I'd come back on a Sunday any time.",0.9908,0.816,0.17,0.014,0.6155941655941656

But not the kind of fun that got me into this mess in the first place.  Good, clean fun!  While Takashi is a fancy restaurant most days, they encourage slurpring with their weekend menu.  And they make the noodles so perfect for these.  The ramen noodles here are thick wonders that require being bitten and sucked (oh my, if only my Friday and Saturday nights usually contained that) to be enjoyed. Personally, I had the Silky Tofu Mushroom (without mushroom, because I just hate them that much) Ramen and the highlight was the soft, juicy eggplant found throughout.  I'm not sure how they made them but each bite infused me with such a happiness that it fought my hangover to death.  The music that was playing was soft and soothing, but still familiar and sort of hip (think Death Cab For Cutie and The Postal Service) so as not to aggravate as well and to make the rejuvenation a full body, and not just the mouth, experience. The only thing which aggravated my condition was the service.  My dining buddy and I waited so long for the check that we missed the bus we were waiting for 20 minutes after we finished dining.  So, I guess, if I was in a hurry, a greasy spoon brunch would have been better.  But it wouldn't have provided such a brilliant hangover cure for sure!",0.9923,0.689,0.203,0.107,0.5527953958186517

The duck was cooked in such a way that the slices ranged from medium-well to rare.  It was interesting to experience the differences in flavor from one end of the spectrum to the other, and it gave the entree variety among its main course so that it did not require a side.

Must have again on Noodle Sunday: 1. Hot Soba in dashi broth with tempura - ABSOLUTE PERFECTION. Pure harmony in each bite. The soba were delicious and delicate. 2. Hot Udon - nothing else warms you up quite like this dish. 3. The duck fat fried chicken? Was the most incredible juicy fried chicken I've ever had.  4. The deconstructed pork bun is not only fantastic -- but also fun to eat and reassemble.  Things to avoid at Takashi: It's a short list -- but the mixed drinks? They are really awful. They don't even come close to the fantastic creations that come out of the kitchen. They are one note, boozey and really unpleasant. I recommend getting a bottle of sake instead and save the mixed drinks for a trip to the Violet Hour that's just a short drive away. Takashi is on my official Must Have list when I come home.",0.9324,0.736,0.153,0.111,0.5758333333333332
2011-01-18,4.0,Choice of breads comes out almost immediately at this quaint little spot.  I knew right when the butter hit our table I was in for a treat (as it was a nice flower shape) Shortly after ordering a spicy calamari salad (fresh calamari/ sushi quality) had a little zing to it. There were also 3 kinds of veggies that came on the plate.  It was a great sized appetizer for 2.  I believe the other appetizer we had was a braised pork belly.  Which had great flavor and was cooked to perfection. After a few glasses of wine and our appetizers we only had room for a single entrée.  Which was a delicious herb roasted chicken. In the end a great dining experience and ideal place for a classy date.,0.9855,0.771,0.229,0.0,0.6544117647058824
2011-01-16,5.0,"I'll say it loud and proud. This is the most money I've ever spent on myself for a meal. Hands down. It was a celebration night. Two birthdays and me congratulating myself on getting through a very long year. My party of three wanted something special, we wanted something spectacular, we wanted something with a freakin' Michelin star. Takashi met or exceeded our expectations on all accounts.  Now, price-wise, Takashi is on point. The actual entrees themselves are very reasonably-priced. It's the fantastic tasting menu that turns a $20/person meal into a $65-105 per person meal (depending on if you want the wine pairings, and trust me, you do). While I'm giving it a four-dollar sign price range based on my meal, you can eat here relatively cheap based on what I saw on the regular menu before I discarded it and said, ""Tasting menu: bring on the first course."" Each course was a fantastic build-up to the next one. Seven courses of amazing flavors that seemed to seamlessly lead into the next. Mussels led to tuna. Tuna to seveche. Then, gnocci, pork belly, duck, and a fantastic dessert. Each came with an amazing wine pairing that actually (as much as I want to say sommeliers' jobs consist of made-up voodoo, which I now concede to be false), added something to the dish. The menu presented to us for the chef's tasting was different than the one on the web site, which concerned us because we were dining with someone who had a gluten allergy. The menu he had pre-screened online looked safe for him. He brought this up with the server who had intimate knowledge of the food and assured us that each course was gluten-free, even outlining the ingredients used in the dishes that looked like they may include gluten, just to be sure he was on point. What a shock, seriously, first off that the waiter knew... Second that despite not being a restaurant that specifically caters to the gluten-intolerant, they happened to have a 7-course meal on the menu that night that was completely devoid of the offending matter. It was like serendipity. The night turned out very well. There was eating, drinking, and tons of conversation. We made a toast with each new glass of wine. Our last toast was to the fantastic meal we had just eaten. The wait staff was impeccable. I think we had three waiters at one point throughout our service. One of them even brought us a copy of the tasting menu, signed by the chefs, for the pastry chef who was dining with us. Each course arrived quickly after we finished the previous one. It was just an all-around good dining experience. It's hard to believe such a tiny house is the home to such a fantastic little restaurant. Takashi lived up to the hype, something that's so rare that it deserves an immediate 5 stars.",0.9932,0.857,0.121,0.022,0.5041813379856858

2011-01-06,4.0,"On my quest for a great bowl of ramen in Chicago, I decided to come to Takashi for their Sunday night noodle dinner.  I'm not sure if they serve noodles on other nights - I think they might for lunch, but on Sundays you can get ramen basically all day.   I ordered the classic ramen and found it to be good (4/5 stars).  The broth was a light pork broth, but a bit too salty for my tastes.  The ramen was great - al dente and the perfect thickness.  The pork belly was well seasoned, as I think it was braised with soy sauce and some sugar.  Very well done.  Overall, I enjoyed the bowl of ramen and would come back again for it.  At $12, not cheap, but not bad either for a restaurant that got 1 Michelin star this year.   Our table also ordered a number of appetizers, ranging from the mushrooms (I would not order this again), to the duck fat fried chicken (good, but nothing out of the ordinary).  We also ordered the pork buns, which were good (much better than the ones at Sunda, but of course not as good as Momofuku in NYC).  The pork buns were open faced, but had a very large piece of pork belly on them.  Probably not necessary if you order the ramen, since pork belly comes in that too. I'll probably be back again, but maybe to try out their other nights where they feature other Japanese dishes.  Still looking for a go-to ramen place in Chicago...

The quail was cooked to perfection. Medium-rare and gamey as it should be. Your Giovanna from Florence would sign off on the risotto.  There weren't low points.

2011-01-02,4.0,"I am not exactly sure what's going on between me and noodles.....let's just say that it's love if there was ever any. The obsessive kind. The stalking kind.  We could almost make a bad Hollywood movie out of it.  Except it wouldn't be very mainstream because, let's face, noodles on the big screen are not that attractive. But we could have a shot at Sundance, or some indie horror film festival. For the longest time I thought that I wasn't born on the right side of the border. There must have been a mistake in the baby delivery factory. I had to be Italian. Pasta was my middle name. But then I realized it was not  only about spaghetti, fettucine, penne and tortilloni. There was udon, ramen, zymarika, vermicelli and so on and so forth. I discovered, tried, slurped - again and again. Always wanting more. And always getting more. Imagine my excitement about a Sunday night noodle dinner!!!!! I dreamed it. Takashi made it happen. It doesn't get much better than this: you come in, sit down in a cozy atmosphere, sip on a drink, peruse the menu and have to choose between half a dozen of options of hot soups rich in home-made doughy delights. Everything sounds so delicious that it's pretty hard to make a choice. I went the unusual way and settled on ramen with silky tofu, trumpet royal, shi-shito peppers,eggplant in a wonderful vegetarian broth. It was a massive bowl of steamy wonder. I had a hard time to finish up my portion and believe me, I usually don't have enough. Every other declination I tasted around the table was equally delicious and well-executed. But really, that night, for me: Noodles + creamy tofu + earthy mushrooms = paradise Having walked a solid 20 blocks to get to dinner in freezing temperatures it was so  comforting that I would have liked to stay and linger for a while by the non-existent fireplace with a nice glass of whiskey but all good things must come to an end and our party of 6 left just before the last call. We were all kind of sad to leave this restaurant which made us feel at home and decided to cheer up with some sweet treats in a hot and trendy neighboring place.

2010-12-30,4.0,"I went to Takashi for the first time last night  with my boyfriend and it totally exceeded our expectations. I have been wanting to try it out for a while but rarely make the trek to Bucktown. My Groupon was burning a whole in my pocket so I finally went. The hardest part was deciding between the tasting menu ($69, not bad!) and ordering a la carte. We finally decided to go a la carte since there were a number of things we wanted to try that were not on the tasting menu. Our server coursed them nicely for us so it came in 4 courses: 1) First Course - Tuna and Ceviche. The Tuna was probably our least favorite thing all night, but it was still tasty. Good quality fish...we just weren't sold on all the accoutrements. The Ceviche was AMAZING. Perfectly tender and the perfect balance of acid One of the best ceviches I've ever had 2) Second Course - Scallop with Soba. I am a scallop lover and this is definitely one of the best scallops I've had. A great small plate portion with 3 scallops. The soba gnocchi were delicious but the best part was the sauce that was sooo cheesy but not overly heavy it drowned the scallop.  3) Third Course - Pork Belly and Sweetbreads. I've never met a sweetbread I didn't like. What made this special WAS the accoutrements. The bacon/mushroom/potato mix....delish. The Pork Belly was a very high note of the meal. I feel like pork belly has gotten overly popular to the point where lots of places have it on the menu but shouldn't. This is one of the best cuts and best cooked pieces of Pork Belly I've had (and coming from a Chinese household that means a lot!). The dish was really clever, with freshly steamed buns....perfectly spiced wasabi mustard...and the daikon salad was a good pairing. This dish is a MUST. 4) Fourth Course -  Chicken in a Clay Pot. I NEVER order Chicken at restaurants because I cook it too often at home. This sounded so good and it lived up to the expectation. Brown butter with yuzu - BRILLIANT! And the pairing of the french green beans with japanese eggplant and mushrooms went quite well. 5) Fifth Course - Macadamia Nut Ganache cake - Very tasty and a nice portion All in all the food was delicious. Service was slow and I've read that in some other reviews as well. But, I think that's part of their French vibe. Don't go to Takashi if you are in a hurry.

I was actually about to complain, but another couple started making a fuss about how amazing their meal was and asked to see the chef.

We ordered appetizers and a main course. I started with the scallops and gnocchi, and it was great. The scallops were perfectly cooked, the sauce and the gnocchi were very nice. It would have been even better if we didn't have to wait another 20 minutes to get it. Then, no exaggeration, we waited more than 30 more minutes, after they took our appetizer plates, for the entrées to arrive. I had the pheasant in risotto, and it was only very average at best. The risotto didn't have much taste, and was a bit overcooked.

We were so excited to try Takashi for the first time after hearing our friends' rave reviews - not to mention the fact that they just received a Michelin star. We had a 9pm reservation Friday night.  When we arrived (a couple min early) they said it would be 15 minutes (no apologies).  OK, so we can wait a little bit, it happens.  25 minutes later, we asked the status of our table and got a curt reply that it wasn't ready yet.  We were seated 35 minutes after our reservation (again no apologies, no drinks sent over, nothing) - and it gets even worse from there. We were seated next to these two girls who were the epitome of obnoxious hammered girls - as in, screaming-across-the-table-in-high-pitched-voices-like-they-were-in-the-middle-of-Duffy's-drunk.  And they were yelling about their sex lives (or lack thereof, as one's SO can't seem to ""get it up"").  At one point, my boyfriend said ""Oh, look what my father had to say"" and handed me his phone to read an email and the girl next to me said ""Oh, what did your father have to say?""  And she really wanted to know - she then tried to interject herself in the conversation for a couple minutes before apologizing for interrupting our ""first date.""  Ah huh. My boyfriend ordered Skate and the server must have heard Steak, because that's what came out for him.  When we told them this wasn't correct, the server went back toward the kitchen (which we weren't that far from) and we heard him bitching about how we ordered Steak not Skate.   Final straw - I talked to the server about how disappointed we were since we had been so excited to eat there.  We got some free sorbet and dessert wine out of it and the chef did come say hello (the food was insanely good!)

Location: 4 out of 5 The cross streets for Takashi are basically at Armitage and Damen.  The physical address is on Damen just south of Armitage, and mind you - if you go in the cooler months, to look for the annexed windscreen.  If you walk past a seemingly small patio with no one sitting on it, you've gone too far.  Public transportation is ample, and street parking (both metered and free residential) may take some know-how of the neighborhood, but I wouldn't classify it as difficult or onerous. Service: 5 out of 5 There's something to be said for a restaurant that has obviously trained every person in an uniform and consistent manner.  Service was attentive, of course, as well as efficient - but I really got a chance to see just how well-oiled the machine was when two different servers brought out the tasting menu to a multitude of tables in the same manner.  We're talking everything from the placement of the wine to the placement of the dishes to the non ad-libbed explanation of what things were.  Everything about the service here was crisp.  The only minor flaw that I could discern throughout the evening was that because the servers there are relatively soft spoken, and there's music playing in the background with other people talking, hearing the descriptions required me to lean closer to the server each time around.  In no way does this impact the rating - it's just something that I noticed. Decor: 4 out of 5 Muted colors on the wall with a long fabric'esque wall ornament towards the front window.  Where we sat was right by the frosted glass of the kitchen, in the last dining space.  I consider aural sensations to be decor too - the music was on, and some might argue that it was too loud, but I personally didn't have a qualm with the low tones and moderately tempo sampling or beats.  The bathroom was simply decorated with dried flora, but I'll address the WC more in a subsequent section. Food: 5 out of 5. Omakase Courses: Amuse Bouche (chilled home-made tofu with ginger soy and bonito flakes surrounded by mini tomatoes); Seared Tuna; Ceviche (squid, octopus, scallop, shrimp); Scottish salmon (with baby artichokes and eggplant ratatouille); Caramelized Pork Belly (served open faced sandwich style on asian 'mantou' with daikon salad); Duck (with persimmon glaze, and two types of beets) and; lastly, Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cake with orange and vanilla ice cream. A few tasting notes: the texture of the home made chilled tofu was like nothing I've had before.  Crumbly, but not annoyingly so.  My personal favorite was the caramelized pork belly sandwich.  Sweet, fatty, and tender on a mantou with just the right amount of acid from the daikon salad to cut through the fat.  The scottish salmon was very delicate in taste, the duck was cooked to a BEAUTIFUL pink in the center, the scallop in the ceviche was sweet in taste (pretty neat, huh?), and the young lady and I went bonkers for the dessert.   Default Wine Pairing: 4 out of 5 Almost spot on, Takashi.  The sparkling wine for the amuse bouche and tuna was fine.  Riesling with the ceviche was a surprisingly excellent pairing.  Pinot noir with the pork belly was heaven.  The very sweet wine at the end with dessert was also pleasing.  Internally, I do question the default wine pairing for the salmon and the duck dishes.  The delicate Scottish salmon taste was overshadowed by both the artichokes and the eggplant 'sides', and although pleasing to taste, a Vouvray was a little too subdued (personal opinion, not fact).  The Cotes du Rhone (red, not sure what variation) that accompanied the duck stood up better to the sweetness of the glaze, but I personally would have liked something a little bolder.  I think that what threw me off a bit was the berry undertones of the Cotes.  And let me re-iterate that these are only the opinions of one person (and two if you count my gf) and by no means am I an expert.  Those were the only two things I noticed that might have been done a little differently. Cleanliness: 3.75 out of 5 Takashi, you almost got a 5 on this but for the WC.  I will e-mail the establishment privately about this matter.  The dining area was absolutely gorgeous, however. Pricing: 3 out of 5? Oh boy...my least favorite part.  Tasting menu is 68 pp, the wine pairings are 35 pp.  You do the math.  I feel like it's commensurate with other tasting menu pricing, however. Overall: 5 out of 5. Absolutely wonderful dining experience.  My best wishes to Takashi and his many ventures in the future.  And a special thanks to the Chef for taking time out of busy evening to speak with me.  See my pics.",0.9989,0.83,0.147,0.023,0.4926025938830816

I am so ashamed that I forgot her name but she was lovely, very helpful with her recommendations and one of those natural servers who anticipates your needs perfectly.  Came here for the noodle brunch recently. Tried to get a reservation online that day but was shut out and so we took our chances and were seated within 5 minutes of getting there at noon. Others have commented on the decor but add me to the admirers of this charming house. Lived in yet neat as a pin--if that makes sense. We sat upstairs in a baquette corner.  The three of us (all female) shared it all. 3 apps: pear salad, gyoza and tempura. 2 noodle dishes recommended by server: Shoyu and Miso--ramen never tasted like this before. No room for dessert but honestly, there's no doubt I will be back. It's the kind of restaurant you root for, want to tell everyone but hope it can remain the intimate treat that it is.

2010-11-14,5.0,"I came here for the Sunday noodle menu with my boyfriend and this has definitely become one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Chicago. I would love to come back during the weekday and try their regular menu as well. I was surprised by how small the front of the restaurant was (I almost walked right by it), but I liked how there were two floors with each floor being smaller and more intimate. There was also a patio area on the first floor; I would have liked to be seated out there if it hadn't been raining on the day that I went. The decor was simple but classy (I heard that the chef used to be an interior designer too), and all the staff was friendly. For appetizers, we had the homemade tofu, beef tartar, and the tuna tataki, all of which were delightful. The homemade tofu was amaaaazing. I loved how it came with all the garnishes; it was fresh, light, and different from your average appetizer. And I won't claim to be some connoisseur of authentic Japanese cuisine since I've only been to Japan once, but the miso ramen entree I had was pretty much almost exactly the same as the kind that I ate when I was in Tokyo for three days. The noodle dish was well-portioned and I had to take almost half of it home. I thought I was almost too full to have dessert, but I'm glad that we ordered the cheesecake with the mandarin shaved ice. The cheesecake was just the right amount of sweet, and paired with the lightness of the shaved ice - oh, my! Amazing, amazing meal.",0.9968,0.788,0.212,0.0,0.570012679628064

We started our meal with a trio of appetizers: pork belly steamed buns, duck fat fried chicken, and sake soaked mussels.  I enjoyed all of them; the fried chicken was especially crisp and satiating. My bowl of udon noodles was salty; my plan is to dilute the leftovers with some good ol' H20.  I didn't care for the dessert options at all (soy coconut panna cotta, salted caramel cheesecake, green tea shortbread), which is really odd.

2010-11-08,4.0,"Another one of those restaurants that I've walked past 100 times, but never tried until this last weekend. We had 8pm reservations and the place was packed but we were promptly seated. Unfortunately the seating is quite tight, really the only downfall to the experience. Because the seating was so close, the noise level was extremely high and it was difficult at times to carry on a conversation without almost having a shouting match with our neighbors (mainly because our neighbors had finished eating and just sat there talking extremely loud for probably 45 minutes).  Anyway, on to the food. We started with three different appetizers: the beef tartare with quail egg and waffle ""chips""; the salmon gravlax served with daikon, mango and some spicy wasabi mustard; the pork belly served with bao style steamed buns. All of them were delicious, but the pork belly was my favorite. It basically was the best bbq pork bao I've ever had, just deconstructed. However, the beef melted in your mouth as did the salmon, so much so that I could have eaten two portions of each appetizer and been happy for the night. We did have to move on to the main courses though, so we opted for the Blue fish served with stuffed cabbage and the Duck Breast Confit. I preferred the Duck over the fish, as it was served both confit style and sliced breast (the confit being the clear winner). It was cooked perfectly and the pairing with the two different kinds of beats worked nicely. To finish off our already wonderful meal, we had the chocolate sticky cake (served with graham cracker ice cream) and a side of the apple cider sorbet (which tasted exactly like apple sauce). The cake was decent, not the best I've ever had, but both the graham cracker ice cream and the apple cider sorbet were nice endings to a great meal. Next time I'd be curious to try the Omakase as everything on the menu looked great and its a nice way to try more than one dish...",0.9969,0.811,0.173,0.016,0.6123953823953823
2010-11-07,3.0,"Takashi is a interesting place to dine.  You're basically dining in a small and cozy two story house, and the storefront is pretty easy to miss on N. Damen.   Having never dined in Bucktown (that I can recall), I will take the liberty to assume that not all Bucktown establishments are thusly set up, and that Takashi is somewhat unique. The food and ingredients are fresh and tasty, and there are some creative servings - like duck fat fried chicken and pork belly on steamed buns.  These appetizers came with a nice small and tasty salad side, cole slaw and arugula respectively.  We came on a Sunday night, and as of a month ago, Sundays are now appetizers and noodle bowls only, on an all day basis.  You can get a bowl of udon, ramen, or soba noodles for $13.  On the downside, is that the appetizer serving sizes are generally smallish and pricey.  We also found the noodle bowls we had, ramen with beef and fried eggs, and hot soba noodles with shrimp tempura, to both be on the salty side.  They also have a small selection of French and Japanese beers.  It was not filled on Sunday, but if it were, I suspect the noise level in either the lower or upstairs (where we were at) dining areas could be quite noticeable given the tight quarters.  Overall, I'd go with about 3.5 stars for our experience, and it was nice for us to give Bucktown a go.  Free street parking was easy to find, but they do have valet for $9.",0.9623,0.856,0.114,0.031,0.6250992063492065

Erin and I didn't know what to get so the server suggested we get a few small plates and one entree. So.. we decided to split 2 small plates and one entree. This way we were able to taste the different offerings of Takashi. I am so glad we did this because my taste buds were in love. We had the tuna, the scallops, and skate wing. I never had skate wing but Erin told me it was good and not as delicate as other white fishes. The Scallop dish was so amazing that I didn't want to share with Erin. I wanted to lick the foam and bath in the deliciousness of it all, but I had to share! We didn't get dessert because the 2 small plates and the Entree made us full.

The chicken in a pot was also surprisingly delicious. I usually don't really like chicken, but this - I loved.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The veggies were cooked/steamed in the oven with the chicken.  Both had an Asian flavor that I can't describe but it  had a subtle tang.

Since they were giving 1000 pts on Open Table, gave it another try.  Wow!  Just a fantastic experience all around.  Like a cheaper, more comfortable Spring with better service. We were greeted at the door by Takashi himself, and the service all night was absolutely top notch - very similar to the most elite restaurants.  Just the little touches all put together like folding your napkin while you're in the john, making sure your table is clear when you're done with a course, wiping of the crumbs, all the things that only the highest end restaurants do but don't think much about.   And the food?  Takashi hit a home run with every course.  We were full, but kept shoveling it in and forcing it down cuz it was so good.  The house salad came with a coucous side and hummus which were fantastic in their own right - I scarfed down that coucous quick.  The pate dish was unique and a great value, including all kinds of pickled things on the side to go with your meats.  The gnocchi/scallop dish was ridiculously good - I was taking the freshly baked bread they give you to scrape up every last bit of the sauce.  The pork belly buns were also fantastic.   Now we're completely stuffed and I'm wishing we didn't order the halibut entree.  When it arrived, it was tough to force down the first bite but it was so friggin good my stomach just cleared the way and all was good again.  I think it probably realized it wouldn't ever be eating a more tasty piece of perfectly cooked halibut in a spectacular chili sauce, so my stomach just had to take advantage. One of the biggest improvements I noticed was the price.  I swear every dish on the menu must've been dropped at least 20%. Small plates were just slightly about $10, entrees were around $25 or less.  I swear this menu used to be considerably more expensive across the board.  I had 2 beers, my wife had a cocktail - we had 5 dishes and got out of there for just over $100.  Great deal.

Frankly, I am NOT going to give any kind of benefit of the doubt in this case because punching in 188 is completely different than punching in 208.  Needless to say, I am very unhappy about this, especially after experiencing such a nice meal that night.  I expect restitution ASAP.  If I do not hear back in the next 3 days, I will be calling into the restaurant directly and speaking to Mr. Yagihashi. Should you have any questions, please contact me at xxx-xxx-xxxx. Regards, Bernard 26 DAYS LATER: Mr. x, I apologize for the error, and hope it has been resolved.  Our website email has been down, so this is the first I have heard of this.  Please let me know if the 20 credit has been issued. Thank you, Kathy Yagihashi 28 DAYS LATER: Please note that unfortunately this credit has yet to surface.  Can you please check again to make sure it was issued?  MC #xxx-xxx-xxx-xxxx, exp: xx/xx Regards, Bernard 47 DAYS LATER: Kathy, This is now the third time over the course of 2+ months that I am contacting your restaurant regarding an overcharge of $20.  I have since successfully processed the refund myself through my own credit card billing dispute department. I want to voice my extreme disappointment with the lack of resolution on such a simple issue that should not have happened in the first place.  It's unfortunate that something like this has caused me to not recommend your restaurant to friends and family despite what had been a pleasant dining experience. If there has been some kind of terrible mix-up here and I have overreacted to the situation, feel free to contact me again. -Bernard NO CONTACT OF ANY KIND WAS ATTEMPTED BY ANYONE AT TAKASHI OUTSIDE OF KATHY'S FIRST RESPONSE Bottom line: food's good but you better watch what they (over) charge you!",0.9945,0.743,0.175,0.082,0.5085346854791298

2010-09-02,3.0,"My PIC (partner in crime) bought a Groupon for Takashi and asked if I wanted to go check the place out with her. Of course! Dining out is what I DOES. :-) When we stepped into this beautiful minimalist space, which was smaller than I imagined, the friendly hostess immediately seated us upstairs, which was equally as warm and inviting as downstairs. Things kind of go downhill from here. After we were seated, no one saw about us for at least 10 minutes. Our server, while friendly, seemed pre-occupied, as if he really didn't want to be there.  I ordered the ginger lime martini which was light, refreshing and not too sweet. However, we had to ask for bread, water and silverware. Each time, I could see the server reprimanding the runner, who was a sweet, gangly teenager just  trying to do a good job.  We then proceeded to order our appetizers, but what appeared on our table wasn't what we ordered.  When we informed the server of the faux paus, he looked around uncomfortably, whisked the dish away to the back and 10 seconds later, reappeared and presented it to the diners two tables away. They apparently didn't realize what happened because they happily munched away on their rolls. We didn't breathe swine flu germs on the rolls but still...it just seemed inappropriate. Moments later he brought our tasty veal sweetbreads and the light, but packed-with-flavor asian pear and persimmon salad.  For an entree I had the seared Maine Skate Wing served with japanese mushrooms and cauliflower risotto. My PIC had the New York Strip served with Yukon gold potatoes and baby carrots. Both dishes were mouth-watering good.. Takashi is reasonably priced and with the Groupon it was almost like highway robbery. However, service just wasn't on point. This was disappointing because I had high expectations after reading all the great reviews. I KNOW Takashi is a five-star restaurant-- maybe they just didn't properly train their current wait staff.

2010-08-26,3.0,"I've been wanting to dine here for a long time.  As a ramen lover, I'm always on the search for good ramen in Chicago, and I've heard great things.  I haven't really found anything I love, and my go-to place is usually Santouka in Mitsuwa, just because it's cheap and easy. Finally came here for their Sunday only noodle brunch (although I've recently discovered that they will be extending the noodle menu to Sunday dinner as well). I was excited for 2 things: the pork belly snack and the shoyu ramen.   The pork belly snack was lovely -- perfectly cooked pork belly and a soft bun, with pickled veggies and hot mustard on the side. Takashi chooses to do a char-siu type sauce with the pork belly.  The sauce kind of overwhelms the whole snack unfortunately, and I don't think there was enough pickle.  Momofuku makes a much better version of this. The ramen -- oh the ramen.  Hopefully this is not usual, but my noodles were overcooked.  What a huge disappointment.  Now as far as broth goes, ramen broths usually go one of two ways -- clean or fatty.  I'm prefer the latter, but can still enjoy a clean broth if it's flavorful (i.e. Momofuku).  The broth here is pretty good, but reminds me more of a beef noodle soup broth than a ramen broth.  All in all, it would have been a decent ramen, had the noodles been al dente -- seriously mushy noodles are such a big no-no. We also ordered the hot soba noodles with tempura and the ebi harumaki. The hot soba was good if you're a fan of buckwheat noodles.  The tempura was also well fried and I liked how they battered a mushroom too (possibly shitake?). Delicious! The ebi harumaki was tasty as well -- but one of the spring rolls was half burnt!  I really should have sent it back. I have a feeling they were short staffed that day which might explain some of the weird service issues we had, but no restaurant should serve sub-par food regardless. They did comp two desserts for us, as we were celebrating my birthday weekend, and I'm glad they were comped.  One was a cheesecake with some citrus and red bean paste-- that red bean was not a complementary flavor to that dessert.  The second was a shortbread cookie with white chocolate mousse -- also forgetful.   All in all, maybe my expectations were just too high, but it definitely did not live up to the hype. I'd go back just to see if it was a fluke day, but wouldn't go out of my way to do so.

I've waited a little too long to write this review, so I may have forgotten some of the dishes, but here were some highlights: We started with a full glass of Brute Rose and an amuse of homemade tofu. I'm not a big tofu fan, and this was a really great start! The bubbly took us through the first appetizer (a noodle/broth combo with fresh seafood), and then we enjoyed another 2 small plates, including the spring roll which is to die for.  The pork belly with steamed buns is reason enough to go back. I believe my exact words to our server were ""I want to eat this forever."" So amazingly yum. We also really enjoyed the duck breast with confit, and while I didn't think there could possibly be room for dessert, there was a lemon/blueberry situation that made me want to lick my plate.  We sat upstairs, and found the restaurant comfortable and clean, and the service was great.

As anyone that has been following me recently has known, or has noticed, since my return from the Land of the Rising Sun back in April, I have been on a hunt to find and try every decent place that serves ramen in the Chicagoland area. Finally, a lazy Sunday afternoon produced the best time for me to wander in sans reservation into Takashi to sample their well reviewed restaurant and Sunday noodle brunch. Ambiance? Wonderful. Looks great in the summer sun, and it likely looks great at night. The restaurant has been converted from what looks like a house and has two levels of seating, with the first floor giving you a relatively easy look into the kitchen. You will have a number of decent choices for noodles and side dishes at the brunch. I was feeling somewhat traditional, so I chose to go with the Hokkaido-style Miso Ramen, along with a side plate of Gyoza. I also ordered a genmaimatcha. A green tea blended with roasted rice, served hot. Delicious! I typically enjoy my ramen slightly to medium spicy at times, and the Miso Ramen certainly came with a nice amount of kick to it. No need to up the spice level. Definitely make sure to ask or mention that fact to your server if your tolerance to spice is lower than average, since the menu certainly doesn't mention that at all. How was it though? Delicious! First thing I try with a bowl of ramen is the broth. And this broth was excellent. Seasoned well, with that kick of spice, and a rich hearty flavor. The sprouts, the corn and the wakame worked wonderfully together. The noodles were good, but the real star was the braised pork belly. Nice and tender, and with good amount of flavor to it. The gyoza was prepared well. Not overcooked, or burnt, but with a hint of a crisp to the fried side that I tend to enjoy. The only issue I have, which I believe was an aberration was that the service was a bit off. I almost got another customer's order. Followed by the appearance that my order may not have made it at all meaning my gyoza arrived later than that customer's order, even though we ordered at the same time. Finally, that same customer was given my bill, which they had to reverse of course! Weird stuff. Otherwise the staff was friendly and attentive. Given the popularity of this place, you should definitely place reservations via phone call or through Open Table. Taste-wise it's easy to recommend the ramen as one of the top in the city. But taste to value ratio, considering its limited availability and price, it's not my personal favorite.

One side, a tapenade, was alright, but nothing special, and the other side dish, some kind of pile of vegetables (mostly onions and cabbage, but also some carrots and maybe a piece of celery) was like something from a Green Giant can: bland, mushy and slightly bitter. There were 5 or so potatoes on the plate and those were very good, and very salty. My friend had the steak and found it fatty and bland. Maybe this just isn't my type of food.

I just went for the second time for the Sunday brunch menu and am still very confused as to how a ""convenience food"" can take so long.  I understand that the version Takashi produces is not the Ichiban variety of ramen, but 50 minutes is a bit too long... especially considering the following: 1) the noodles are no longer made from scratch, 2) the broth is made in large batches ahead of time, 3) most of the accompaniments (bbq egg, pork belly, oden, etc...) are also prepared in advance or require minimal preparation, and 4) ramen is supposed to be fast food. The finished product is very delicious though may be a bit overpriced.  It's definitely not worth the wait.  I asked the server how can it take so long to prepare four standard bowls of shoyu ramen (the most typical and commonly ordered varierty of all their ramen dishes), and her answer was that the kitchen is small and that Chef Takashi takes a lot of time preparing each dish.  It's amazing that our small plates (appetizers) came out within 10 minutes of ordering yet our entrees took almost an hour.  Does this mean that Chef Takashi cares less about the small plates and only pays attention to the noodle bowls? Service was attentive and the setting is very nice.  But I think I'm done giving this place a try.  When I go to a place for a bowl of ramen I'm usually craving something right away, and do not expect to wait almost an hour for my entree.",0.9766,0.877,0.1,0.023,0.5170875850340136

2010-07-05,4.0,"I went to Takashi for the first time in early June thanks to the sweet Groupon deal.   After reading enthusiastic yelpers' reviews, i was determined to order the soba gnocchi and the pork belly.  unfortunately my dinner-mate insisted it was a stupid idea to order pork belly in an asian fusion restaurant while you can go down to chinatown and get some authentic cooking of pork belly.  so i reluctantly agreed to ditch the pork belly and went with the chicken in clay pot instead.  both dishes were quite delicious and flavorful, but the sauce accompanying the gnocchi was unfortunately a bit too salty for my taste.  i thought it would work much better for me if it served as some kind of dip to go with some bread.  i asked for some bread and was much happier.  the chicken was so tenderly prepared with a touch of miso and topped with very tasty and delicately prepared mushrooms.  again, this dish was also a bit too salty for my taste, and unlike some of my family members, i do like strong flavors, but i still felt the dish would be even more pleasing had it been a bit less salty.  my dining experience here at takashi definitely took a dive, not so much because of the food and definitely not because of the service, but because of my dinner-mate's constant complaints towards the flavors, either to me, the waiters, and even the people at the next table.   but the staff at takashi was proved to be very well-mannered and took her criticism very well and professionally.",0.9911,0.76,0.188,0.053,0.5218518518518518

We sat upstairs - which is a little more intimate than downstairs or on the patio.  My wife and i shared 5 small plates and a dessert and that was about right - though we could have done one less. The Pork Belly was great - as was the Hamachi - and the scallops with soba gnocchi were excellent.  The cold tofu was also good and I liked the beef tartare more than my wife did - all 5 dishes were tasty. We did the sticky cake for dessert - it was awesome and just like sticky toffee pudding with roasted bananas on top.  Yum.

2010-06-25,5.0,"THANK YOU, fellow Yelpers and Groupon!  For exposing me to a wonderful restaurant I probably never wouldn't noticed. I have an amazing amount of Groupons that are piling up, so the BF and I went to dinner last night to try and whittle down the stack!  And wow, was I impressed.  I swear, this place is incredible - it even turned a slightly sour night for the BF and I into a great, romantic, dinner that we both loved. Takashi has a very unique setup - looks like it was built into an old two-flat, so the setting is intimate and different.  We were seated upstairs at a cozy little table.  There is also a small outdoor area - although it might be a little weird since the restaurant is located right on Damen.  Regardless, not a bad option when it's nice outside. The staff was perfectly attentive.  Someone promptly cleared every plate after we were done, water was constantly refilled, and our server was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave great wine and food recommendations. And for the show stopper - the food was OUTSTANDING.  My BF wasn't too hungry and I was pleasantly warmed with wine, so we decided to just stick with some appetizers (Takashi calls them hot and cold plates).  I don't think we could've picked a better selection.  Yellowtail hamachi - super fresh fish with some crunchy stuff for texture, and I tried kimchi for the first time!  Beef tartar - served with asian pear and cucumber julienne-type strips and homemade chips to mix it all together with.  WOW!  The beef melted in your mouth.  And both of our favorites - a barbeque-d style pork belly with baos.  The bao buns were perfectly cooked and the pork belly was phenomenal.  I've only had pork belly one other time and it was horrible (fried or something?) and I had no clue what all the hype was about.  But now I clearly understand.  What a delicious treat! I highly recommend this place for a quiet, romantic dinner with someone who enjoys sampling good food.  The price is right on point for the incredible food!  Don't let this little grey two-flat-turned-restaurant go unnoticed anymore...you won't be disappointed.",0.9982,0.728,0.244,0.028,0.6436421356421355

2010-06-23,5.0,"Like all the other reviews say, this place is incredible.  You should read mine because it encompasses 2 separate visits-  dinner and the noodle ""brunch"".  This is such a unique place to eat in Chicago because of the setting as well as the care and consideration taken with every dish.   It's a great place for a date, maybe a double date, but probably not a huge, rowdy party. First time we went here it was for dinner with a Groupon.  The host was very accomodating and seated us right away with our reservation.  We had the delicious homemade tofu as an appetizer which is unlike any tofu I've ever tasted- all the colorful traditional accoutrements really made the dish, unfortunately didn't seem like ingredients that would be readily available in our local grocery stores.   My entree was the Amish chicken in a pot and my boyfriend had the barramundi fish- both were great.  But we both agreed that the dessert was suprisingly the best part of our dinner.  It was some sort of chocolate sticky cake with graham crackers, ice cream, and raisin compote.  It was AMAZING and I believe priced lower than most desserts at Hot Chocolate down the street (and secretly better). Second time we went to Takashi was for the Sunday noodles.  After reading all the Yelp reviews, we were sure to make reservations but they weren't at all necessary- the place was half full?!  We decided to sit upstairs this time, which was just as cute.  Our waiter was a bit odd this time- he kept commenting on the ""weird"" things in every dish but we went with our guts and got the authentic stuff- again got the tofu and also the pork belly snack.  Of all the noodle dishes we ordered, the Hot Soba was the clear winner- the broth was really savory and flavorful. All said, I was completely thrilled with both experiences I've had at Takashi.  The service was slightly off at lunch, but then again, it was a bit more casual of an environment, so I can excuse that.  The food was spot on and really not that pricey when you take into account the quality of the ingredients and creativity of the dishes.  This was a truly unique experience that I hope to repeat over and over.... :)",0.9956,0.796,0.166,0.039,0.5756701940035275

Interior decor is modern and sleek in this beautifully converted-house-to-restaurant , so tiny it's easy to pass by on Damen without noticing.

We started off with the soft shell crab and caramel pork belly appetizers. soft shell crab was served with a poached egg (yolk still runny, just the way i like it) and was quite delicious - great crispy texture of the crab against the soft, silky egg.  and the caramel pork belly was so darn delicious - i sliced it up to eat on top of the buns (reminded me of peking duck) and it was oh so mouthwatery good.  the daikon salad was a nice touch - slight bitterness against the sweet pork belly.  for entrees BF ordered the NY strip steak and I ordered the skate wing. NY strip steak was nothing special (BF needs to learn to stop ordering steak at non-steak joints) and was served with a fancy version of a hash brown (eh - looked better than it tasted) but i LOVED my skate wing. it was lightly seared with fresh japanese mushrooms and cauliflower risotto. it was sooo good.  i loved everything on this entree.  entree sizes may not appear big but you will definitely feel full after dining at takashi. i would def recommend the caramel pork belly appetizer and the seared skate wing.

The building was really cute and and the space was borderline cramped --like some other Yelpers have mentioned, it looked like someone converted a small townhouse into a restaurant. We were seated upstairs, and the service definitely slid downhill after we mentioned we had a Groupon. Blah.  The food was OUTSTANDING. Wow! Not quite up to par with Joe's Stone Crab (my measuring standard) but as damn close as it gets: 1) Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly ($13):  Interesting bread. Reminded me of when I used to live in Japan. The pork belly was absolutely tender -- you could cut it with a fork! Great accompanying Daikon Salad.   2) Maryland Soft Shell Crab ($15): The crab was cooked well, and I actually enjoyed all the accompaniments (asparagus, some awesome puree, bacon, etc.) on the dish a tad bit more. 3) Sauteed Main Scallops and Soba Gnocchi ($14): Best dish of the night. This plate was plastered with foam which I'm not a fan of, but the dish itself was extremely tasty, so the foam can be forgiven.  4) Wasabi NY Strip Streak ($29): Great steak, cooked medium-rare. The only (small) issue was that the wasabi somewhat overpowered the natural flavor of the steak. Still extremely good though.  Outstanding food, but still 4 stars overall. Besides the below-average service, well....after a $77 bill, we still felt like we were paying a tad bit more than what the food was worth. For example, we'll pay $100+ at Carnivale and walk out feeling we got our money's worth with no regrets. We had no regrets here with the Groupon, but had we not had that......would not have been entirely satisfied. Thus, four stars it is.",0.9955,0.712,0.221,0.067,0.5356060606060608

We got the groupon from a while ago, and we decided it was a chance for us to go all out (order two plates/appetizers, two main plates and a dessert to share + some drinks.  Be aware. The attire is business casual. Nice jeans and a nice button up shirt would do. I would recommend khakis for dudes. I wore dark jeans, a blouse and a black cardigan.  I saw a family in jeans and sweatshirt...It's not that casual.  As for the food, it was absolutely delicious. Be aware the menu may be different from what is on the website. We ordered Hokkaido scallops and squid with soba noodles (with medley of Japanese mushrooms) and sauteed main scallop and soba gnocchi with celery root-parmesan foam. Similar ingredients, two completely different presentation. The hokkaido scallops was a cold dish with sashimi of scallops and squid nicely presented on a bed of soba noodles with dashi flavored sauce (a lot of japanese flavor), where as the main scallop dish was a more french style that came in a big bowl where I can only see the foam at first. That gnocchi was so tender and flavorful though. I could have been happy with that as a main dish. It was rich and creamy and just delightful. The hokkaido scallops were very refreshing. It was interesting to see the two dishes juxtaposed. (price per dish: 8-14) For main dish, we ordered seared main skate wing and roasted indiana duck breast and confit of leg (with kumquats and beets). Roasted duck beast and duck confit had a classical french presentation. I wasn't too impressed with the breasts, though they looked fabulous, but that duck confit was to die for. I had the skate dish with japanese mushrooms and cauliflower risotto, which had similar flavor with the same foams from the main scallop dish. It came with a few leaves of endive with chive dressing. The skate wing was very tender, but a little greasy for my taste (went pretty well with the mushrooms), but the risotto was awesome.  (price: 23-28) As for the dessert, we shared a roasted rhubarb with rice pudding. The rice pudding with a strong vanilla flavor with candied ginger reminded me of the flavors of chai latte. On top there were cookies with cream filing (they didn't tell us, but our guess is strawberry rhubarb.. but we could be totally wrong), and strawberry sherbet. A few small pieces of roasted (rather mushy, but tasty) rhubarbs were scattered in the bowl. I read a bad review on it before, but I thought it was fine. If you like rhubarb that is...In addition, I had a nice genmaimatcha with the dessert. It came in a clear tea pot (brewed two teacups).  Oh, by the way, go for the multigrain bread.

2010-04-30,5.0,"Love, love, love this place.  Went here last night with a Groupon and a friend.  Not only was I so excited that the weather was nice enough to sit outside in April, but I hadn't had a really fabulous meal in a while.  The place is super cute when you walk in and you know you're about to have a great meal.   We started off with the Saint Germain cocktail.  I think it's my new favorite drink.  I wish I knew how to make cocktails because I would make that all the time.  For appetizers we split the wild leek soup and the scallops.  The soup was fantastic.  I like a soup that has no cream and can still be rich and flavorful (at least it didn't seem to have cream).  The scallops were also rich and creamy and perfectly cooked.  They do come out with this foam on top, and my friend's initial reaction was ""hmm, scallops with spit.""   That's literally what it looked like.  Luckily it tasted so much better than it looked, but I think they should stop putting that stuff on it.  It ruins the presentation of what I have to assume would otherwise be a beautiful dish.   Moving on to entrees - I ordered the skate and she ordered the fluke.  Both were amazing.  I can't tell you which one was better so I would say you just have to order both.  We also split a bottle of white wine which was the cheapest on the menu, but still very tasty. I think this may be my only 5-star review so that tells you what I thought of this place.  I can see how it could be considered a bit pricey, but having the Groupon made it seem just right.  We each paid about 60 bucks and felt like we got our money's worth.  One thing to note though is that I wouldn't recommend sitting upstairs.  I went to the restroom after our meal and was very happy that I wasn't seated up there.  It didn't have the same light, airy atmosphere.  I would love to come again and sit outside!",0.9983,0.708,0.253,0.039,0.5918442668442668
2010-04-22,4.0,"I wanted to give 3.5 stars but because of the Groupon madness which may be the cause of some of my complaints am bumping it up to four. We (group of 3) arrived on time for our reservation but had a bit of a wait - understandable given the recent influx of Groupon. The location is charming - in an old house and the lighting and sound was perfect, though the crowd was definitely older than I had expected.  Two of us ordered  3 appetizers each and the last ordered an appetizer and an entree. We tried the Wild Leek Soup, Maine Scallops  with Soba Gnocchi, Pork Belly, Sashimi of Scallops and Squid with Cold Soba Noodles, and Homemade Tofu - all truly excellent. The only dish we were not pleased with was the Barramundi main course whose flavors did not work for us.  We tried the St.Germain cocktail which was something one could serve  at a 10 year old's birthday party -  of course it wasn't strong, but even the flavors didn't do it. The glass of Pinot Gris we ordered also underwhelmed and was served almost frozen. Bad bad sign.  The service was spotty and they had run out of the Hamachi appetizer we so looked forward too as well as the Halibut main course. This might have been due to Groupon, as was the spotty service and frantic acting waiters/bus boys. All in all just kind of off service - but again likely due to the massive volume of customers they are serving. I would come back in about a year's time after the rush is over. The food was imaginative and very well executed - one diner commented that the chef was the only thing saving the place and this review.",0.7141,0.821,0.097,0.082,0.5735632183908046

2010-04-16,5.0,"Thank you Groupon for giving me the idea to come here! Takashi is officially my favorite restaurant of all time, surpassing Tru and the now-defunct Pluton! Though we opted out of the omakase since we were simply not in that ""mood"" tonight, it was still a stellar meal and experience. We were seated upstairs by the window and loved our red-headed waitress for all her fabulousness! Started off with red raspberry and ginger lime martinis - delish! Our server recommended going with 2 hot and 2 cold apps and that was a perfect balance! Appetizers: Beef tartare was seasoned tremendously and once you broke the golden quail egg over it, the flavor reached new heights. Spring roll with gulf shrimp and prosciutto was also very tasty and the mustard-golden raisin vinaigrette added perfect balance of acidity. The scallops with soba gnocchi was very creamy and rich - I have never had such perfectly prepared scallops and the trumpet mushrooms were melt in your mouth good. This dish was completely overshadowed by the spectacular soy-ginger carmel pork belly with steamed buns and a horseradishy mustard - DIVINE!!! Really the most memorable part of the entire meal! Entrees: Barramundi in a lime-garlic sauce, that didn't taste like it but still a fabulous flavor; miso roasted eggplant, cabbage roll and my first ever taste of lotus root - wow! awesome, crisp texture Halibut w/mussels and a swiss chard ""cabbage roll"" type accompaniment - so rich. The winner of the entrees was most definitely the skate wing with cauliflower risotto and a medley of mushrooms. I love mushrooms so this was destiny - no two dishes containing mushrooms had the same type or flavor. Stupendous risotto! I am not usually a fan of foams but it was on top of the scallop appetizer and the risotto and it added that perfect little twist on texture. We wanted to take dessert home, which I understand is sometimes not pleasing to the chef so instead of two ""to go"" we had one there - chocolate macadamia cake covered in rich ganache with canelles of housemade vanilla ice cream, smashed macadamia, delightfully thin macadamia brittle slices and perfectly plump orange citrus sections. As always, with restaurant week and other types of deals, you end up spending a bit more anyway but it was worth every last penny and then some - LOVE TAKASHI!!!",0.9973,0.757,0.201,0.043,0.6011352123054252
2010-04-11,3.0,"Overall, my husband and I had a very nice meal and good service but I figure for the prices you pay and the fact he is a chef and I am in the same industry, I should give this a thorough albeit tough review. Our server was super nice and very well educated on the menu which was refreshing. I had the St. Germain cocktail which was delicious. I highly recommend! We then ordered from the cold plate section, the Hamachi, and Fresh Tofu and from the hot plate section, the scallops with Gnocchi. We were both very happy with the Hamachi and tofu. Extremely well presented and tasty. Then came the scallops and gnocchi. The scallops were well cooked and the sauce was really tasty - lots of butter will do that. My complaint with this dish however is the gnocchi. It was not good AT ALL. It was a mass of unseasoned dough that lent nothing to the dish. It was in dire need of help and frankly I was surprised they were so bad. For Entrees I had the barramundi and my husband had their ""signature"" chicken hot pot. I really have no complaints with the Barramundi dish. The presentation was solid, the fish cooked well and the eggplant and cabbage roll it came with was really well done and flavorful. My husband's chicken dish on the other hand was not  a home run. While it was moist and juicy, the dish lacked complexity, color and salt. He was really disappointed and wish he ordered something else. We skipped dessert...They were nice enough to bring a cute little plate that had happy birthday written on it with a tiny dollop of buttercream, raspberries and a couple small pieces of chocolate tuile. (It was my husband's birthday). On a side note, I was a bit surprised to see that aside from the tofu cold plate appetizer, there were no vegetarian items on the menu. It's strange because if they make their own tofu, they should do some kind of main dish utilizing it. I would think they are losing out on this client base. It always drives me nuts when places don't offer a single vegetarian entree! They should work on that.  So I don't want to end on a sour note - all in all, it was nice. I like that the portion sizes are substantial and the outdoor patio is really nice too. Also, the cocktails we had were really tasty.

Scallops w/ Soba gnocchi-  One of my three favorite items of food in my entire life.  Foams usually do little for me, but this one actually added to the flavor and texture.  Granted, these type dishes are often some of my favorites.. but, this one I will remember.   2. Beef Carpaccio-  Another standard of my girlfriend and I's.  Yet certainly better than your average ""fancy"" restaurant standards.  Melts in your mouth.       Our entrees were excellent as well, not as good as the apps.  We never felt rushed, despite our tardiness.  On our way out the door we were informed that Chicken in a Clay Pot won some award, or something to that regard.  We got the usual 'if you come back to Chicago, you gotta try it'.  I guess my Yelping and restaurant research failed me here.",0.9859,0.802,0.16,0.038,0.5554347826086957

We started the evening off with the hamachi tuna which was accompanied by an ""arromatic sauce"" which I think was magic soy sauce.  It was fantastic!  I wish that I didn't have to share half.  This was the highlight of the small plates we ordered.  We also got the ""ravioli""- seafood and daikon radish salad actually.... I did't really understand the name.  I could have passed on that- it was very fresh but there are more interesting things on the menu.  We had the scallops which were good- I don't normally care for foams on dishes, but the foam served with this really added to the dish.  The pork belly was good, but not as good as the pork belly preparation at Spring and the soup was pretty good, but I was hyped up for something a little more special than carrot soup from the restaurants reputation. The main dishes were the highlight of the evening.  I ordered fluke that had a french type preparation.  It was simple and good- however the baramundi with the eggplant miso and peppers was off the charts fantastic.  It was the interesting type of dish with unique ingredients and big flavor that you look for when you go to a restaurant of this caliber.  There was nothing ordinary about it and the flavor was fantastic.  If its on the menu and you like fish, you've got to try it.   The low light of the evening was the service. I think our waiter was trying not to interrupt our conversations but he ended up just kind of ignoring us.  We love talking to our servers about the food and including them in our experience but we just couldn't bond with him.  The descriptions were not very exciting and I didn't care for his recommendations that we ordered.  In addition our food runner was very clutzy so serving time was a little hazardous each time a new dish came out.  To Takashi's defense, when we were first seated, another server did take the time to initially greet us, get us water and wine because our server was tied up.  She was great- friendly and efficient.  I'm not sure if I would come back for dinner- it was good, but out of 7 items there were only 2 that I went nuts over.  With so many great places in the city that I'd like to try, I'm not sure if this meal was enough to hook me.  I'll still give brunch a try.",0.9979,0.733,0.205,0.061,0.5570754193395703

For appetizers during brunch, the pork belly snack is spot on -- the spicy mustard is a must.  Tried to home made tofu and although it wasn't silken, the ""medium"" firmness tofu had a fresh rich soybean flavor that was well complemented by bonito flakes, wakame and an awesome fermented soybean mix - bean on bean!  I've also tried the ebi springrolls which are a more fresh version of what he has at Takashi on State and are delish.

All three times I have ordered the soup... I will come back to that. Everyone we have encountered there has been welcoming and knowledgeable. From the hostess, the servers, the runners and the bar tenders. There hasn't been a night that Chef Takashi is not on the floor making sure his guests are getting nothing but perfection. We normally end up over-eating as we split everything we order. Typically we end up ordering at least 4 appetizers and two entrees in total. If we still have room for desert, I'm normally the one that puts that away too. Thankfully, we exercise a lot. The menu is very diverse. I thought Perennial and Boka had some of the best pork belly in town. Then I tried it at Takashi; speechless. The scallops are amazing. With and added bonus; the soba gnocchi that is served with them is irresistible to stop eating. My wife and I fight for it. The homemade tofu is so savory it's hard to believe it's tofu. The bonito flakes that come with make my mouth water still. The skate wing and the flounder have been perfection. The menu is changed constantly and every time we have been pleasantly surprised. Soups are rarely repeated. Now for the soups... Has to be the best green lentil soup I have ever had. The second time we went, they had a cabbage soup with some type of Asian root (cannot remember the name of it) that was out of this world. IT WAS SO GOOD I ORDERED ANOTHER ONE FOR DESERT. Bottom line. Always make sure someone at the table orders whatever soup they have. Chef Takashi takes pride in these creations, and it shows. Jason knows his wine. He has turned us into some excellent selections for pairing. Value: Great bang for the buck. Atmosphere: Relaxed Parking: Valet available.

Between us, we had the escargot, pork belly, pear salad, duck breast and confit, Fluke and the chocolate desert.  Everything was fantastic.  There wasn't a bite of anything that wasn't exactly the way it should have been. The pork belly IS what everyone says it is.  i only ended up using two of the three dumplings, not because they weren't delicious, but really, because i wanted more of the melt in your mouth, flavor of the pork belly with each bite.  I can certainly see why people have ordered this as a small plate starter, and then again for desert.  wonderful. The duck was delicious, despite it being a little overcooked.  maybe a minute too long, because it wasn't overdone, but it was definitely medium and cooked all the way through, where most typically, when i get duck, it's served on the more rare side.  Not enough to send it back, but i can't imagine that if Takashi himself were looking at this, that he wouldn't agree that it had a little too much time on it.   The wine selection was ok, certainly for a place this size.  i didn't expect them to have a 500 btl cellar. The only complaint i have about Takashi, and this is really just luck of the draw, is the noise.  Due to the cozy nature of the size you can really either luck out, or get stuck with one or two tables ruining the dining experience for the whole floor.  We were lucky enough to have two of the loudest people sitting next to the window that night (which seemed to amplify their loudness and push it across the other ten tables).  Thankfully we weren't the suckers that had to sit right next to these people.  This whole thing gave me a very interesting view of Takashi.  Most places where you're going to spend this much money, filter out the rif.  I'm not saying you can't have a good time, but this was Jersey Shore style.  not exactly what you expect at a place that is as refined as this, even if it positions itself as a neighborhood place that's accessible to all. Overall this was a wonderful experience, and we'll definitely be back. p.s. our waiter DID specifically offer ""Chicago's finest tap water"" and my sparkling water bottle service was only $4.  Either they just got lucky, or they actually read what people are writing and make the necessary adjustments.  Nice work Takashi, you've won me over.",0.996,0.817,0.14,0.043,0.5017601126472093

Unfortunately my experience with Takashi fell a little flat.  Seriously, I really wanted to like this place. First of all, we ordered omakase.  Expecting a gastronomic tour of various asian flavors and textures, we were disappointed..   I hoped for a tour of thoughtfully crafted dishes that could only lead one to ask, ""how did they make this?""  Well, I know how they made it.  Salt.  Most of the dishes were salty and savory, but had a similar underlying taste.   Now, I would love to tell you specifically what we had to eat...only the waitress didn't bring out our food half the time.  The busboy brought out half our dinner, and it wasn't even too busy that night.  Still, inexcusable.  We ordered omakase.  Yeah, he just dropped off a well plated, interesting course of ??? Heck if I know. No explanation of the food, or what we were eating. I guess the waitress was too busy, or disinterested. Anyways, I was not impressed.  Don't get me wrong.  Takashi's food is good.  Very good.  It just didn't live up to the hype for me.  I was expecting more of a high grade sushi experience, and found Takashi to be more asian fusion/contemporary fare.  This is okay, I just wasn't too impressed with the food, nor the service.  It is good, just not amazing. Compared with a taco stand on the corner, this place gets 5 stars.  Compared with Trotters, Alinea et.al's food and service, this place gets 1 star.  I was hoping to find something to top Kaze Sushi's omakase service, but looks like they're still the best in Chicago.

We each had a delicious cocktail, split two of the small cold plates (Winter roll, and Madai), and each had an entree and dessert (her the chicken in a clay pot, and I the roasted west coast fluke), and each had a dessert (her a coconut one and I the milk chocolate sticky cake). Yes, this place is pricey. But think about it, you're eating incredibly authentic ingredients, prepared in loving, innovative, and complex ways. Service was excellent (our server was Stephanie, and could not have helped us out more).

It took 1 hour to get our food after we were seated (maybe even a bit longer).  At the end, they took off $12 for my meal, which I suppose was a nice gesture.

2009-11-28,2.0,"Mediocre at Best. We tried Takashi based on a raving recommendation and the Tribune review.  Overall, the restaurant was pleasant enough, but seemed to be a bit confused as to whether it was a casual spot or fine dining - and did an awkward job of finding a place between.   To start, we ordered the summer roll, which was mostly hard bread crust and tasted overwhelmingly of smoked fish and capers.  Not bad but not great.  Next we sampled the pork belly (the item about which I was the most excited), which was completely overshadowed by the small salad which was meant to be its garnish.  In addition, the scallops were almost impossible to find under the silly parmesan foam, and lacked any sort of flavor or texture. For our entrees we ordered the salmon, which was overcooked on the outside to the point that it was hard and cold and raw on the inside, making me think it was pre-frozen.  It was also drowned in a passe pesto-type sauce.  I do have to say the eggplant and potatoes with it were good, but something I could have made at home.   The duck entree was also disappointing.  I was expecting what was listed on the menu - duck with quince -but received a plate covered in beets, which completely overwhelmed the taste of everything else.  The duck breast itself was room temperature and seemed like it sat on the counter for too long after being sliced.  The duck confit was very good, however. Finally, we were hoping to try some of chef Takashi's famous noodles, but there were none on the menu. Fortunately, dinner was not expensive, since we had to eat an hour later, having sent back nearly full plates. Totally underwhelming.",-0.6061,0.826,0.084,0.09,0.5907860998650472

2009-11-22,3.0,"Despite our mediocre impressions of the Duck fat fried chicken we sampled early last week at the Food and Wine festival, we were very intrigued by the Takashi menu.  I was very optimistic by the Yelp 4.5 star review, but was somewhat disappointed with the meal.  I guess the first red flag should have been the ease at which I got reservations at 1:00 on a Saturday for that night.  It wasn't all bad, there were some highlights. Per the recommendation of others I started with the Ginger Lime Martini.  I thought it was OK.  It was a little sweet for my liking, but not bad.  My fiance got a really good glass of chardonnay which I quickly switched to.   We started with 2 hot appetizers; the scallops and gnocchi and the pork belly with buns.  As many others noted we were drawn here partly because of the Scallop dish that was just OK.  The scallops had some sand in them which I got past, my fiance did not.  The gnocchi was very bland and the mushrooms were kind of hard.  The creamy froth was pretty bland too.  You got 3 small scallops for $14, which seemed a little high for what it was.  The porkbelly on the other hand was the absolute highlight of the meal.  If I went back I might just order 6 of those appetizers ($14).  This pork belly was very tender and had a lovely bbq glaze (this was $14 also).  It came with a pickled salad and a hot fresh bun.  The chef recommended an ""open-faced sandwich""- we complied and it was fantastic!  Literally one of the best dishes I've had in Chicago. For our main plates I ordered the Fluke which is a white fish similar to halibut.  My fiance got the Salmon (against the recommendations we read about it).  As always, the fellow yelpers were correct.  Her salmon was well cooked but very bland.  I felt like you could have bought the salmon at your local Dominick's and thrown it in the oven with a little butter and wallahh.  The accompaniments were not great either- dish seemed to lack flavor.  My fluke was pretty good.  Fish was cooked great, and was served over hot pickled carrots and cabbage.  It also came with butternut squash ravioli that were tasty.  Both entrees were around $26 each. The food overall was decent, just not amazing (except the porkbelly).  Be aware the dishes are very small- 2 apps and 2 main entrees left us both satisfied but not full.  We therefore indulged and got the bread pudding dessert.  This was very tasty, but staying in line with the entire meal very petite.  We needed to order a couple of glasses of dessert wine to round it out! The restaurant has a very cool atmosphere as it's 2 stories in an old house.  It's definitely a great place for a date as they bring out 1 dish at a time and you can't get out of there in less than 2 hours.  I will say they don't have tap water available and you are forced to pick sparkling or still and they graciously bill you $8 for this.   So... 2 apps, 2 entrees, 1 dessert, 1 ginger martini, 1 bottle of wine, 2 glasses of dessert wine was $205 including tax and tip.... and like I said we definitely were not full nor drunk.  I wouldn't tell someone NOT to go to Takashi, but I'm unlikely to return as I think there are better meals available in our great city for $200.",0.9974,0.775,0.169,0.056,0.5332882882882882
2009-11-22,2.0,"I would like to be clear right from the outset: **** for the food. * for the experience/service (it should be noted that the service was not the waitresses fault--more on that later). We had 12:30 lunch reservations this Sunday for a table of four.  We were running just a touch late getting there, but all four of us were seated by 12:35. Takashi is a very nice space.  We ate upstairs where the paint and the furniture are done in subdued grays and light-colored wood.  Every table was full. We ordered some appetizers and some entrees and settled in to wait.  And wait we did.  It took approximately twenty-five minutes to be served with the appetizers--the Asian pear salad, the pork belly snack, vegetable tempura and gyoza (pork dumplings).  The salad looked beautiful and was served with generous hunks of Maytag bleu cheese.  The pork belly snack and the vegetable tempura were really great.  The pork belly was very flavorful and the bun was really great.  It was served with some spicy mustard which was perfect.  The tempura was delicately fried--not at all greasy or heavy.  The pork dumplings were fine--a dining companion remarked that they weren't any better than something you would get from Big Bowl.  This is probably true. Now, I really, really, really want to like Takashi at this point.  We see noodles coming out of the kitchen to the tables around us.  They looked fabulous and the smell was remarkable.  All four of us had ordered ramen noodles.  But we waited.  And waited.  And waited. Approximately an hour before we got our noodles.  The server was apologetic.  The bus boy was apologetic.  The maitre d' was apologetic.  The house manager was apologetic.  But that still didn't have our noodles out to us less than an hour and a half after we sat down.  Our waitress--who was clearly upset by this whole timing issue and was obviously getting grief from all of her tables about this--told us that they had about four times the number of turns than they usually do--which, honestly, should have been controlled in the front of the house. We were waiting so long that my girlfriend ordered tea.  We waited for the tea.  After about ten minutes when a couple who just came in ordered tea and were promptly served, and when it became apparent that we were about to be served our noodles, she cancelled the order.  Five minutes later (after we had gotten our noodles) the tea arrived. Honestly, I hate to complain about this because I want to like this restaurant, but, seriously folks, that was today's experience. Back to the food:  I had the miso ramen.  It was absolutely fantastic.  Absolutely fantastic.  The broth was flavorful and spicy and complicated and I thought it was wonderful.  It is really on the back of this that I say that the food was four stars. Monica had the shoyu ramen.  To be fair:  If I would have ordered this instead of the miso ramen, I would have a completely different review to present.  I thought that this was bland and underseasoned.  Though there was a fantastic barbecued egg served in it.  I was simply not impressed with this, Monica was simply not impressed with this.  I should note that another dining companion had the shoyu and remarked that those were the best noodles he had ever eaten in his life.  I would've been more than a little cranky about an hour and forty-five minute wait for that meal, though. Our other dining companion had the silky tofu mushroom ramen.  I didn't taste it.  She seemed to enjoy it. We got our bill.  We were comped one entree for our wait and we were not charged for the tea.  I thought that was fair--though comping us for all of our entrees might have been more equitable given the length of the wait which was--for a casual Sunday lunch--absolutely unacceptable under any circumstances not due to some sort of force majeure. We'll probably try Takashi again...  Hopefully some of the problems will be fixed by then.",0.9978,0.799,0.151,0.051,0.5248544973544972

This past Sunday we decided to finally try the noodle brunch that we kept hearing about. We decided to begin with one of the appetizers, so after a little discussion we chose the ""gyoza"" which are essentially pot stickers. To our disappointment they came out with blackened bottoms and a cool almost raw looking center. Our server assured us that that was how the chef had chosen to prepare them, which to me sounded quite odd. After our disappointing appetizer we chose to just split one of the housemade ramen bowls. While I cannot complain about the enormous portion size, overall I felt the dish was sub-par at best. Unusual compared to the delights we have enjoyed in previous trips to Takashi. The broth was extremely salty and the noodles tasted as if they had come out of a small plastic package labeled ""chicken flavor"".  I'm not sure who's house these were made at but I'm fairly certain it wasn't Takashi's.

I was so excited by innovative, interesting menu, and the food was fantastic (especially the sticky pork buns, which I kept eating off of my husband's plate!).  If I'd written a review after our first visit, I definitely would have given it 5 stars (though I agree with the other reviewers that the service is less than stellar). However,  we brought friends back just a few short weeks later and had a completely different experience.  We ordered some of the same exact dishes we'd had before (including those sticky bun I couldn't keep my hands off) and they were simply not as good.  Quality control is a huge issue here. Because of this, we will not be back.  Zagat gives Takashi a 29 right now.  I don't know how long that will last...",0.9734,0.811,0.174,0.015,0.3840136054421769

I know they're not a traditional japanese restaurant, but they could definitely stand to improve their sake menu.  They have a few good choices but I'd like to see more.  That small complaint is nothing to keep me from coming back though.",0.9679,0.708,0.262,0.03,0.4441176470588235
2009-08-22,5.0,"I went to Takashi last night for the first time with my mom and brother, who were visiting from Michigan. It seemed like the perfect restaurant to use as an introduction to fine dining for my brother, who's a huge foodie but doesn't live in a city that accommodates much experimentation on the restaurant end. And yes, Takashi delivered! The portions are small, so you'll want to order at least one small plate and a main dish for each person. SMALL PLATES:  - Pork belly: Wow. I ended up ordering another one of these these after the main course - it made a technically incorrect course order, but I was so happy with the first one that a second seemed necessary. The pork belly is sweet and tender, and it's served with steamed Taiwanese-style rice buns.  - Tuna, served three ways: Another wow. The fish was fresh, flavorful, and beautifully presented.  - Scallops and soba gnocchi in foam: The scallops were good - they were fresh and cooked to a perfect doneness - and the gnocchi was likewise good, but the dish didn't blow any of us away. MAINS:  - Duck confit and breast: I've had this dish in a lot of restaurants - it's a French staple - and Takashi's is one of the better versions you'll find.   - Skate wing: This dish is another French staple, and it's solidly executed here. However, it's unlikely to make you crave a return trip. The service is excellent - you'll never want for fresh silverware or dishes, and the waiter didn't balk at my odd more-pork-belly-after-the-main-course request.  The restaurant isn't as quiet as one might hope - the clean lines and brick walls allow sound to bounce. But it is beautifully decorated, and the loudness wasn't distracting. Dinner (without alcohol) runs around $60 per person with tip. It's not cheap, but neither is it overpriced. I've had more expensive meals that were less impressive. Overall, I highly recommend a visit - you won't be disappointed.",0.9985,0.731,0.261,0.008,0.523191489361702

I got a few small plates to enjoy rather just doing an entree.  Each were tapas size portions that was great for taste testing. Sashimi platter - The only thing good on this plate was the scallops.  The tuna was sub par and the shrimp with kimchee was mediocre.  I'm not sure if they used fresh shrimp at all since the shrimp tasted a bit gummy. Beef Carpaccio platter - First off, the beef carpaccio was seared rather than fully raw.  The only thing that made this dish great was the dipping sauce.  Other than that, it was nothing special. Steam bun with pork belly - I'm glad they ended with this dish because it was definitely delicious.  It was actually better tasting than Momofuku Siam Bar in NYC.  The salad that accompanied the pork belly was great as well with its rice wine vinegar dressing. Blood Orange Martini - I'm very picky with my drinks and this one kinda tasted like cough medicine.  I had to clear my mind to think that it was in order for me to finish it. Table service for about 10 people was slow - the waiters did not bring out all the dishes at once so half of us had to wait until everyone's dishes came out.  I don't know why they split tab in half with 2 waiters...I never seen that happened in NY.

2009-05-28,3.0,"Im going to get right to the point with this review.  Some things were good, some weren't so good. The pork belly was good, but each peice is about 25% meat, and 75% mushy fat. I know pork belly is supposed to be rich and fatty, but i found it to be uncomfortable to eat. The sashimi appetizer is 3 tiny piles of fish, and out of the 3, 1 was excellent (the eggplant) and the other 2 were ok. I though the tuna was almost too simple and could have used a little something to bring out the natural flavor.  The skate was my least favorite. The fish itself is just very stringy and fishy tasting - if you like Skate then you'll probably think this dish was ok. The Halibut on the other hand was amazing. There are 2 areas i think this restaurant could improve upon: Manage expectations better. The server couldnt stop gushing about how we needed to order the sashimi plate, and it ended up not coming close to the expectations she created. Speaking of the server, she approached my table with 3 top recommendations that we HAD to order, then 5 minutes later i hear her approach another table the same exact way with 3 completely different recommendations. I found that to be odd, because if those were truly the 3 best dishes, wouldn't she tell all of her guests? She made a comment about not wanting to slam the kitchen with the same dishes, so that only sealed the deal for me. The other recommendation is for Takashi to put their current menu on their website. Part of the reason i decided to come here was because their menu online had many things that intrigued me, but when i saw the actual restaurant menu, virtually none of the same dishes appeared.

2009-04-29,5.0,"Takashi rounded out the perfect one-two punch of birthday dinners for my boyfriend and I after trying Spring a few months ago. A friend recommended Takashi and since we tend to love Asian-influenced restaurants, I was all in. We made reservations for Sunday night (boyfriend's bday is on Monday, when Takashi is closed). I'd been told by a friend to ask for Jason as a server and was so happy we did.  We got there 15 minutes early and were seated with no problems downstairs right by the window (very nice since it was pretty warm outside and by the end of the night, upstairs felt a little humid). Jason walked us through the menu with recommendations. After ordering the ginger lime martini (with homemade ginger syrup with a secret ingredient of lemongrass-so refreshing and yummy!) and the mayfair cocktail (gin, lime and cucumber, also refreshing and good, but that Ginger lime, vodka was hard to beat!), we pretty much let Jason make our menu. We started with one of their $5-$6 small plates which are only available Sunday-Wednesday or something, I think. The pricing seemed almost criminal for the quality you recieved. We were able to split everything without a problem, and most everything was large enough to share between 2 people.  Ist course: Duck Confit with pea custard topped with fresh peas, microgreens and a delicious vinaigrette--This was amazingly fresh and delicious. The duck was rich with crispy skin, complementing the freshness of the peas and the crunchy, fresh peas and greens. Great start, especially for only $5! 2nd course: Sashimi plate. 2 monster scallops, 3 large pieces of big eye tuna and shrimp. This was a very generous plate. The scallops melted in your mouth and the tuna had this ""Umami-soy"" that was incredible. The shrimp was good, but couldn't match up to the other two. At this point, Jason offered to split glasses of wine to pair with each of the remaining courses. This was some of the best service I've ever received. We basically got a wine pairing with every course without worrying about drinking 5 full glasses of wine or facing a huge alcohol bill at the end of the meal. Before every course, he'd bring over his recommendation, have us try it and explain why he chose it for that course. It was the best, most thoughtful service I've ever had.  3rd course: Scallops with soba gnocchi and parmesan-celery root foam. This one changed my life. I loved it so much that I immediately wanted to order another, and another, and another. We were scraping up the cream sauce after the mushrooms, scallops and gnocchi were finished. 4th course: Skate wing with asparagus/leek/pea risotto. this was the biggest, most beautiful piece of fish I've ever seen It was perfectly cooked, crisp, but moist and flaky on top of creamy, flavoful risotto. There were also roasted parsnips and fried squash on top. Delicious. 5th course: Pork belly buns: The buns are like the softest white bread, but denser while the caramelized meat completely changed my mind about pork belly. Even the salad was the perfect, vinegary acid for the rich meat. We used the mustard sparingly since it was pretty intense, but it added an incredible zing to each bite. 6th course: Chicken in a Clay Pot: Maybe my least favorite dish, but still extremely good. It comes sizzling in a citrusy yuzu broth with mushrooms, green beans and eggplant with the most amazing miso mustard on top. I was getting pretty full at this point. 7th course: Sparkling wine and coconut and grapefruit sorbets. Great palate cleanser. 8th course: Yuzu pudding cake (with kiwi, pineapple and coconut sorbet) and a special, 5 spice chocolate mousse birthday dessert. Both were good, but I was so full and happy with the meal already that neither blew me out of the water. An excellent meal that was a great value, too. We definitely got some of the best food we'd ever eaten for a reasonable price. I'd definitely go back for the food, but the service was outstanding. As a younger couple (27), I sometimes feel like my boyfriend and I are immediately overlooked when we go to nicer restaurants. The service is good, but they know our check won't be the highest they'll see all night, so we get the standard service. Jason definitely went out of his way for us, even asking Chef Takashi to come talk to us after the meal (which he did and was so gracious and nice). We felt so comfortable and completely taken care of the entire night.  It was truly an experience that I'll remember and plan to repeat soon. If you'd like to see pictures of every course, and read more in depth about our dinner, go here: kristinsutter.blogspot.c… Go to Takashi as soon as possible.

We started with a blood orange martini and the lime ginger martini. While i liked the orange martini, the ginger martini was much better. For an appetizer we ordered the sashimi plate and the scallops. The fish was incredibly fresh. This was the first time I had sashimi without soy sauce, and it was nice to taste the fish on its own. The scallops were huge and were served with a homemade gnocchi. Both appetizers were outstanding. For the main entree, I ordered the chicken in a clay pot. It was served with green beans and (I think) eggplant chunks. I was in poultry heaven. The chicken was tender and flavorful and was served piping hot. My boyfriend got the duck, and said it was the best duck he had ever had. I had a taste and agreed with him.  For dessert, I opted for a scoop of their coconut sorbet. It was simple and refreshing and was a nice end to the meal. The boy opted for the salted caramel dessert. It was served with a caramel cake, a HUGE glob of salted caramel, and grapefruit sorbet. Although the flavors sounded weird (grapefruit and caramel???) and that huge glob of caramel looked unappetizing, I had a bite, and it was pretty tasty.

I'll go over some of the other, lesser mentioned, standout dishes of the night: Although the cold grilled asparagus salad, with poached egg and aged ham, was ordered as an afterthought, it ended up being one of my favorites of the night.  Another great cold plate was the spring roll, rolled with prosciutto, shrimp and the secret ingredient: crisp bread to give that extra tempura style crunch.  It was so good that my sister reordered it for her main!  The escargot dish was yummy; served with goat cheese polenta- can you really go wrong with that amazing combination?  When it comes to the main courses the newly introduced halibut, grilled in spicy oba vinaigrette and served with Napa cabbage rolls, was one of my boyfriend's favorite dishes ever!  The skate wing was great and came with spring pea risotto, which was creamy and wonderful.  For dessert I had an amazing financier served with goat cheese ice cream and tart lemon curd- it may be on the list with all-time favorite desserts (in my life).  The kitchen also sent out a birthday dessert on a beautify decorated plate with ""Happy Birthday"" written on it.  The dessert was a crisp-rice chocolate disk (like a crunch bar- but better) topped with a chocolate and allspice mousse- the addition of the spice was an amazing combination! They have an extensive sake and green tea menu- some of which come from Chef Takashi Yagihashi's village in Japan!  Our server was great and very happy to describe the different sakes and green teas to us.  I also had an amazing cocktail to start, made from fresh lime, ginger and vodka- the simple and fresh ingredients made for a very refreshing drink!  They also have some bottles of wine available for under $40!  So there are no prices on the online menu, which left some members of our reservation party concerned, prior to going to the meal.  However, the restaurant was happy to email me the menu with prices.  To give you an idea, small plates are priced from $8-14 and large plates are between $25-27.  There were 5 of us; we ordered generously: about 8 small plates, an entrée each, 3 desserts, a bottle of wine plus additional glasses and some sake.  It came out to about $100 each with tax and tip.",0.9966,0.823,0.165,0.012,0.6135331722541023

2009-03-22,3.0,"I was a bit disappointed with Takashi.  Disappointed in the sense that I expected a blown-away, at least 4 star dining experience. We weren't uber hungry, since we just came from working out, so we ordered 2 cold plates, 2 hot plates, 1 entree and 2 desserts to share among 4 girls.  The cold / hot plates are tapas-size plates, so I'd definitely recommend ordering  a LOT more if you're starving.   This is how the dishes broke down - cold plate #1- washugyu beef carpaccio (apparently, per chef takashi, washugyu is wagyu from washington) -- this was pretty good - cold plate #2 - sashimi platter - wasn't really sashimi and was forgettable. there was tuna, which was good, and cooked shrimp. nothing to write home about. - hot plate #1 - shortribs. to me, this was a lean, cheap version of korean bbq. poor execution - hot plate #2 - scallop & foam with gnocchi - this one was a litle more unique in flavor combos, i liked it. - entree - striped bass. the fish was dry (might be due to the fact that I don't prefer this fish), but the orange granish on top was really good, and the side of potatoes was really good as well.  too bad the main feature of the dish was lacking in flavor and juiciness. - dessert #1: chocolate semifreddo - pretty good!! - dessert #2: macadamia nut crunch with mango pudding and vanilla sorbet -- i really liked this one, it was creative & inventive and best of all, tasted good. i truly appreciate non-chocolate desserts, since I think 9 times out of 10 they're non-imaginative. I actually prefer the pastry chef to chef takashi (at least based on a fri night dinner). Oh, and they have a nice cocktail list. I got the ginger lime martini - it comes with vodka but I requested a sub with hendricks gin, and it was soo good.  The server liked the sub request, and is considering switching up the cocktail to always feature hendricks. i better get royalties if that happens. jk. not really.  Back to the review... I was slightly disappointed by the food, but I'll give it one more shot bc you don't find much cooked japanese cuisine in the city around here.

On my second visit here, I had the tasting menu.   At $66, it is not that expensive and might even be viewed as a good value.  Being the fat a$$, I am, I had been wanting to try the clay pot chicken and actually had it added to the tasting menu.   The tasting menu left me full and satisfied, but not stuffed.  What set Takashi apart for me is the authentic and clean Asian flavors are paired with high quality ingredients that are perfectly cooked.

Entrees:  I had the baked NY Strip w/ Wasabi, which I heartily enjoyed.  It was cooked to perfection, although I thought the meat could have been more tender.  My parents had the salmon and the seabass, and a friend of mine ordered the scallops / prawns.  All dishes were great.  The dessert was tasty, and they brought out a sort of vanilla custard dish with a candle and ""Happy Birthday"" written in chocolate script on the plate - very satisfying.

2009-03-05,4.0,"I was just in Chicago a couple of weeks ago, and since it was my first visit, I wanted to find the perfect restaurant to dine at. After scouring pages of reviews for restaurants, searching for a great atmosphere, scene, and food, food being the most important, a friend recommended Takashi to me. I loved it.  I had the Waygu Carpaccio to start. I typically LOVE carpacchio but when I first saw the dish, I thought, ""That looks way too cooked to be carpacchio, and what is this dipping sauce?"" The dipping sauce was Ponzu, and I have to say that each bite made perfect sense and was delicious. For my cousin, I ordered her the Pork Belly, each bite was like Food Porn for me. As I'm writing this, I'm thinking about the deliciousness in my mouth, my mouth is watering, and I'm feeling very excited. I have to say, reliving the moment right now is almost as good as the actual moment the pork belly landed on my tongue. DELISH.  For my entree: I realize that it may be a little boring, but I love steak, so I decided to get the New York Sirloin while my cousin ordered the Sea Bass. If I'm not at a steak restaurant, I always stress to the waitress that I'd rather have my meat undercooked than overcooked and repeatedly told her ""rare to medium rare"". All my stress and concern was for nothing, b/c my steak came out perfectly. I've never had steak in a sweet puree, and don't usually like anything sweet, but this sauce was amazing. Each bite was a tender, salty and sweet treat, that kept you longing for more. Accompanying my steak was a tiny baked potato that was equally delicious, and I wont mention that the dish was plated perfectly.  I always recognize a good chef when something as small as the sour cream is so mouth-watering good, that you could wet yourself with each bite. The sea bass my cousin was equally delectable. The sea bass cooked to perfection and the puree amazing.  Although I'm not a dessert person, the dessert was excellent and my group was raving about it.  I can't wait to come back to Chicago to go again.",0.9988,0.714,0.261,0.025,0.6437657303936373

So the manager of Takashi, Wyatt (?), called to explain exactly what happened with the bill.  They had subtracted about $23 from the tab, which was the equivalent of the freebies.  We had taken a look and assumed it was for my entree.  It listed one price, so we tacked it with my dish.  Wyatt explained that they were taking steps to ensure that if these issues ever came up, that staff would be on hand to elaborate on the breakdown of the bill. Essentially, we left the restaurant with our assumptions, and confused, didn't understand exactly what was charged and what wasn't.  I know, I know.  It was stupid of us to just leave disgruntled, and this whole misunderstanding resulted in uncomfortable feelings for all. I'm really grateful the manager took the time to reach out to us and explain everything.  You know what that shows to diners like me?  Excellent service and real care for their establishment and their clientele.  So I would like to publicly apologize for the mess and thank Takashi for being so awesome about it.

2009-02-18,5.0,"For my latest visit I came here with the lovely Caroline A. We were needing some catch up time, considering I had been wanting to go back and Caroline had been asking to go, it was a perfect time to do so.  A cold night that was indeed almost chilling to the bone, dreary, gray, traces of snow flakes in the air, I spied a bright spot in my path. Walking in, I was the first to arrive, they gladly took my winter coat and I took a seat at the bar.  I love how they divide the wine list fairly specifically. ""Mediums with Muscle"" was my first spy and went with an easy red. Caroline showed up and we were shown to our table upstairs. Like others have said, the downstairs is small, but during nicer and warmer weather, they have an outdoor patio out in front, I chose the upstairs.  Sitting down to the menu, you have several different options to go for, some choose to keep to the small plates, after all their hot and cold small plates take up a page and a half of scrumptious choices. We decided to take our time and go with four small plates and going with two rounds of each as to savor and enjoy. Our first round consisted of the pear salad and the gnocchi with seared scallops and Parmesan foam. First of all, the gnocchi dish made me have a moment. Forsaking all others, all conversations, all time, space and earthly boundaries, I had to have a moment. The scallops were peaking their seared lil' selves out of the mountain of foam, the small gnocchi buried deeper along with the celery root. The foam: light, savory, filled with the essence of Parmesan, simply amazing. The gnocchi were tender but firm, pan seared and lazily living in melted butter and herbs, complimenting the scallops quite well. Since gluten is off of my diet, I couldn't finish off the flavorful sauce by sweeping it up with bread. *Sigh* The pear salad was light and delightful. Three rounds of pear slices, the middle filled with Maytag blue cheese,  a side salad of frieze and mixed micro greens topped with more blue cheese, a dehydrated pear chip, candied nuts and a simple chive dressing. These two dishes alone I could have feasted on by my own and would have been content. However it was just our introduction to our night.  Round two consisted of the sweetbread and the pork belly buns. Oh me oh my. I do have to agree with Caroline, the sweetbread, (the entire thing), was great in the sense of the reduction and the potatoes and the crispy bacon, however, the size of the sweetbread was ginormous. In fact too big. I think if they had sized it down, played more with the presentation a little more, it would have gone from okay to superb. The pork belly.... I was just ""this close"" to fighting over the last piece, but I was nice and shared.... darn childhood lessons.  Our duck was simply phenom. The confit of the leg was melt in your mouth, fall apart amazement. The pairing of the kumquats and the quinces just was a perfect winter accompaniment. Sweet, spiced, savory and succulent. Seriously.  The desserts. I was jealous of the jug of caramel that was poured over the miso glazed pineapple. Like ""I am taking this in to the corner and licking it clean all by myself and if you try and take this before I am done I will hurt you"" kind of jealous, luckily CA had her childhood lesson and shared with me, I liked mine... but seriously.. jug 'o' caramel.. can you compete? Our server was great, able to handle our long and drawn out ability to stretch a meal in to an experience, answer all our questions quickly and completely, all with a smile and a friendly nod.

2009-02-17,5.0,"So this was my first visit to Chicago. And aside from the runaway corruption riddling the town like systemic herpes and the wallet-disintegrating sales tax (which I didn't mind since, you know, I'm a Stalinist who thinks everything should be owned by the state), CHICAGO IS ONE BITCHIN' CITY. Granted, I think SF is better. Then again, I'm biased -- and frankly SF is filled with whores, dickheads, and obnoxious homos who write profane, pointless reviews of restaurants when they should be doing their motherfucking job OH HI THANKS FOR READING! But I gotta say: Maybe my expectations were skewed since our beautiful bi-racial President cut his teeth in your confines, but, dude, I've never been surrounded by SO MANY WHITE PEOPLE IN MY ENTIRE LIFE! I mean, fuck, the last time this many white folks got up in my grill, I was the keynote speaker at the Klan Convention. It was so bad that I thought I was shadowed through the city by the SAME BLOND WOMAN. Okay, so maybe it was a different woman each time. Okay, so maybe I was on the north side too much. I'm sorry, I'm an asshole. I dunno, fuck, all you white people look alike. And I mean alike in that ASIAN way. Ohhhh calm the fuck down, Nancy. Just because I make your insults better and cheaper through child labor doesn't give you license to hate, round eye! So go bang Miley Cyrus' twangy gong and piss off.   Anyway, if you told me there was an adorable two-floored cottage cum restaurant in Chicago with gray exposed brick, plush cream seating, and tasteful Euro-Japo minimalist art (the shoji screen was a nice touch) -- one that incorporated the best of the French and Japanese traditions -- I in turn would have told you to go fuck yourself. Well, imagine my shock. Who knew culinary diversity could be so skillfully represented on the plate yet not on the faces of the patrons? I'm thinking, for example, of the small plate of caramelized pork belly festooned with daikon slivers that my dining companion and I wrapped in steamed bao. Granted, it was more Chinese than Japanese, but when the belly fat melted in my mouth like a languorous french kiss and the gingery sauce stood my neck hairs on end did I REALLY give a shit about authenticity? Shit no, I silently wept for joy inside and wanted to break into a few bars from Madame Butterfly. Then I glanced over at the stone-faced hetero couple sitting next to us and wanted to stuff pork belly bao in their mouths in a bid to improve what looked like a fractious evening out that would end in adultery. Hey, I wanted to help. I ordered the Roasted Indiana duck breast and confit as my large plate. Our sprightly server smirked and nodded in approval. She was both accommodating and distant, and displayed the kind of professionalism and savoir faire that came across as nonchalance. Did I spell that right? ""As""? The breast slices were juicy, substantial, and perfectly prepared, with a slightly gamey taste (to my liking) appropriately offset by the orange glaze and kumquat marmalade. And the confit? Well, let's just say anything left to stew in it's own juices with salt and garlic then slow cooked in an oven will be unquestionably delicious. Like my penis. It's no small compliment to say that I hope Chef Yagihashi opens a restaurant in SF. We've seen Asian/French fusion before -- have we ever! -- but rarely executed at this level. Finally, let me give a shout out to the great guy who chose Takashi and picked up the tab. HOLLA! Had it not been for him, I would have never discovered the charms of Takashi, and would have blindly assumed cuisine in Chicago was about steak-umms, dolla dolla billz, and oppression.  And that would have been blindness, indeed. Now if you'll excuse me, I'm off to open my campaign office. I hear you bitches need a Governor.

2009-02-16,4.0,"After months of anticipation, I finally had dinner at Takashi.  The restaurant itself is terribly charming. The townhouse clearly stands out compared to the rest of the street, and I felt like I was being welcomed into somebody's home. Definitely request a table on the second level, it is more spacious, yet intimate at the same time.  The decor is Japanese minimalist, with clean lines and cool tones of blue and grey. I thought the accent pillows on the benches were a nice touch. The tables were a little too close together, but still allowed for intimacy. The music was... sexy time music, a soft downtempo that gets you in the mood to open up your taste buds and savor various flavors with fine company.  As we evaluated the menu, it was difficult to decide what to get. It is well varied and everything sounds delicious. After a few rundowns and discussion, we finally decided on one cold dish, three small plates, one main dish and two desserts. - Pear Salad with Bleu Cheese. Ringlets of pear are filled with creamy bleu cheese, and are served with a bed of greens. Have the candied pear last for a nice finish.  - Maine Diver Scallops with Soba Gnocchi and Celery Root Parmesan Foam. Confession: the broth was so good, I used all of my bread to soak it up.  - Soy-Ginger Pork Belly. I don't eat pork very often, but this dish was my favorite. The buns were hot, super soft and the tender and flavorful meat just fell apart in my mouth. Add a tiny smear of the hot mustard for an orgasmic zing, similar to wasabi.  - Crispy Veal Sweetbreads. If you like sweetbreads, I suggest you try this dish. It was probably my least favorite. - Roasted Duck Breast and Confit. If I wasn't so full, I really could have enjoyed this dish by itself. The meat was incredibly tender, and was glazed in a slightly sweet sauce. There was a candied root vegetable that was an excellent compliment to the duck.  - Miso glazed pineapple with caramel fondue - This is a dessert made for two. I was confused when I bit into the crispy miso glaze, but then tasted the warm and sweet meat of the pineapple. You can feed the rest of the caramel pool to your dining companion.  - Vanilla Bean Cremieux with Blood Orange Sorbet. I should have gotten this. It tastes like a creamsicle with candied almonds! I'd say the winners of the night were the pear salad, scallops (the foam and broth were amazing), pork belly (You MUST try this) and the duck. The portion sizes were far more generous than I thought they were going to be - each dish can easily be shared by two people.  The wine list had a good variety, but I forgot to look at the sake list! I guess that will be for next time! We received very friendly service, and our server was very knowledgeable on every menu item and how they were prepared.",0.9985,0.784,0.198,0.019,0.5941091954022989

(3) Spicy Egg Drop Crab Soup with a Riesling.  This was a delicious concoction, nicely textured with shitake, crab, somen noodles, and a nice delicate broth.  The spicy was not very.  Again, not too overwhelming - the wine pairing was good, although I would prefer something a tad less sweet.   (4) Sauteed Fluke - mushroom rissotto, butternut squash, broccolini.  This was a perfect step up in terms of a heavier course, I found the fish cooked perfecly, the rissotto perfect, but - I personally would not put brocollini with this dish - I found the taste and texture out of place overall.  Served with a pinot gris reserve, a nice heavier bodied white.  What I noticed is a nice evolution in wine pairings - well thought out, to be sure.   (5) Duck fat fried chicken with Bourgogne Rouge wine.  This was slightly disappointing - the taste of this was very nice, but I did not like the overall presentation - served on lettuce that seemed slightly wilted. The dish seemed a bit out of place.  Wine was good, can't remember anything extraordinary about it.   (6) Grilled short ribs with shitake, chinese sausage.  Yummy.  Just great.  Tender, perfectly cooked, a great end.  Paired with the heaviest wine of the night, and again, a very nice pairing in terms of evolution over the whole meal.   (7) Desert of banana tapicoca - very good.   Service - I loved it.  Nice servers, no pretension, the chef came out and said hello.  Perfect for me.   One problem - the tables are close together here, which takes away from the initmate vibe.  This is a great place for a special date, but the proximity of other patrons is a slight drawback.   Overall, i would absolutely go back to Takashi, as a destination.  Again, I really like the attitude of the staff, and the food and wine together were worth the $120.00 with tax and tip per person.  Reminds me a bit of Yoshis.",0.9993,0.649,0.293,0.058,0.6385205853174604

Dinner was a combination of fowl and fish with two of us having the duck breast and confit of duck leg, one the skate wing and finally the salmon.  Again, everything was cooked perfectly, presented beautifully and each had ingredients that when placed on your fork together made for the perfect bite (a goal not always achieved when dining out). Everything flowed perfectly with our service and our server was attentive, polite and hospitable.  In a world were hospitality is becoming more like hostility...Takashi's staff knew how to make it all right!   We even tried to get in a little early and were politely told our table would be ready at 9:00 p.m. as scheduled.  Ha!  It never hurts to try, but with a small bar and little else room to stand, we went across the street to Rio for a couple of cocktails.

(i would expect no less).  the space: cramped. we didn't go upstairs, so i can't comment on that, but the downstairs dining area was small to say the least. there was no waiting area and no windshield outside, so being january in chicago, every time the door opened i was hit with a gust of cold air. this was compensated by cranking the heat up to what felt like 80 degrees and constantly running a space heater by the host stand. (a space heater? really?) the food: solid. i ordered the spring roll as my cold plate, the sweetbreads as my warm plate and the sea bass as my entrée. i thought everything was prepared well and the presentations on all were quite nice. among the entire table i felt the only real standouts were the sweetbreads and the porkbelly, both of which were delicious, great flavor and texture. i tasted the salmon as well, which i felt was overcooked. basically i left extremely full and very satisfied but just wasn't blown away by anything.",0.9871,0.794,0.176,0.029,0.5676831501831502
2009-01-03,4.0,"My fiancee and I decided to celebrate NYE a day early by having dinner at Takashi.  We had heard nothing but good things about the restaurant from our friends so we were excited to try it out.  I'm happy to say that Takashi did not disappoint. Food-wise, the small plates (aka appetizers) are the highlights of the menu.  There were so many appealing choices that we contemplated skipping entrees altogether but we didn't think they would be able to bring all the small plates out at once, given the size of our itty bitty table.  So we settled on two: the crispy veal sweetbreads and the fried chicken.  The sweetbreads were superb -- lightly crisp on the outside and melt in your mouth moist on the inside.  The fried chicken was good too -- sort of like an upscale version of Korean fried chicken, which probably had some influence to the dish given that it came with kimchi.   As for the entrees, they were good but not on the same level as the small plates.  I had the striped sea bass and my fiancee had the duck confit.  My sea bass was flaky and came dressed with a really tasty risotto.  But the fish itself was a little on the bland side.  My fiancee's duck was prepared very well but tasted a bit gamier than I would've expected.  Not necessarily a bad thing depending on your feelings on gamey meat.  Like I said, they were decent entrees but just not quite as good as the appetizers. For dessert, we split the apple turnover.  I'm not usually a fan of warm fruits but this dish was delicious and a great way to finish the meal. Service at Takashi was very good.  Our server checked offered terrific recommendations in terms of food and wine and did a good job checking in with us.  Our waters were refilled without us asking and our plates were cleared efficiently -- two small things that go a long way in my book.  I will say that the hostess could have been a little friendlier -- she wasn't exactly warm and inviting when we walked in the restaurant.  And the only other gripe is how close the tables are with each other.  Given the size of the restaurant, this is not surprising, but we could literally hear every word of the conversations by the couples seated on both sides of us.   I'm glad we went to Takashi and I'm looking forward to dining at the restaurant again.",0.9924,0.793,0.148,0.059,0.586962962962963

2008-11-06,4.0,"Before you make a weekday reservation for white tablecloth dining consider picking up the phone and calling Takashi. At Takashi, $68 buys you a lovely 6 course (+amuse) prix fixe menu unparalleled for value anywhere in Chicago. For an additional $38, an accompanying wine pairing can be added to the experience.  The menu changes frequently and is not available on weekends. Luckily for you, Takashi has not become a trendy weekday destination, so reservations are not difficult to come by.  The prix fixe menu includes an unnamed amuse bouche (a small bite to get the appetite going - in our case it was a bacala fritter...mmmm) followed by a couple raw fish courses. We had yellowtail and big eye tuna in our two raw courses, and both were gorgeous. We then had a soup course, a savoy cabbage soup with a poached quail egg and a quail leg, which was savory and delicious. A cooked fish course followed, and then a lovely and simple duck course finished off the savory cycle of the menu.  Dessert was tasty but a little overcomplicated in contrast with the rest of the menu. A coconut tapioca served as the base for two bites of cheesecake and a very mild, just-a-hint cinnamon ice cream. There were many textural contrasts on the plate: soft and unctuous, cold, room temperature, creamy, crispy.  The food here does not set the world on fire - there's nothing new and revolutionary on the menu. But the food is well-made and satisfying, aesthetically pleasing and tasty.  Those seeking novelty are better suited to dining at Moto or Schwa or Alinea. You will not find that here.

Or maybe this place is number 1... Either way, I can't help but to agree, Takashi is A+, 5-star, #1 all the way!! Truly, this was one of the best meals I've had this year and a fantastic addition on the Chicago culinary scene.  Tucked away and set back from the sidewalk in a little 2 story house on bustling Damen Ave, you could almost miss Takashi if you weren't looking for it. It is unassuming and quaint from the outside with the interior following suit. It's far from over the top, small and minimalist with very clean lines the only decor you'll find is a gorgeous metal Asian wallscape that hangs above the banquette amid low, warm lighting. It is plain but promotes a cozy and serene atmosphere for good conversation and phenomenal food.   And phenomenal it is... Takashi outdoes himself at this namesake spot. Every morsel I had was an amazing journey of flavor layered on top of flavor in harmonious complexity. Bursts of sweet, salty... crunchy to soft... spicy and creamy. Each dish is so well thought out and innovative I can only be terribly envious of having vision that comes alive that way in a kitchen. We ordered 4 'small' plates and 1 'large' plate along with a dessert (of course) and it was the perfect amount for Momma and I. As we polished off each dish one by one, most of the meal was spent trading eye rolls and moans of food ecstasy. Mom is rarely impressed so I had to give myself a pat on the back... Takashi knocked off her socks and pants... Scoundrel!  I have to highly recommend what we had... our waitress who was not only sweet but attentive said we had ordered all of her favorites on the menu. I heard her making the suggestions we had chosen to a nearby table so I know she wasn't full of hot air and what can I say, we have good taste. Our cold plate starters were the Big Eye Tuna Carpaccio and Summer Roll. Both were incredible... the Carpaccio was paper thin and buttery, with a hint of fried onion and a ponzu-soy dressing, it was the perfect start. The Summer Roll was even better... topped with luxurious salmon roe it was fresh and layered with amazing sweet and salty undertones. Hot plates were the soy-ginger pork belly and steamed buns with hot mustard and the scallops with soba gnocchi in truffle parmesan foam... I know, you hear foam you think a thimble of hair mousse atop a piece of pasta. Not the case, the portions are generous for small plates and everything tastes like it was touched by gold. Or God. Whatever you believe in. We ate the pork belly on the warm, soft buns like little sandwiches, all wrapped up in it's spicy, sweet, savory mustardy goodness this is an unpretentious as it gets while being sinfully delicious!!  The piece de resistance was our large plate, the duck breast with crispy duck leg confit, ginger braised beets and apples in an orange glaze. Uh huh. Re-read that. It's soooooo choice. Again with the layer, texture, flavor journey... it was soft, moist, crunchy, salty, sweet, tangy all on one plate. My mouth was a party... the tongue taste bud disco!  My amazing dessert of caramel rice cake with blackberry compote and cinnamon ice cream (oh!) and 3 glasses of fab French wine rounded out my experience beautifully. I can't wait to do it all again soon ::hint:: although I'm not even sure if I can stray from these dishes to try anything new, it was after all, number 10.",0.9994,0.745,0.225,0.03,0.5895453529256345

Patio seating was also available, and would probably be pretty awesome on a nice evening. Making reservations would definitely be a good idea since the place would pack easily on the weekends.  We started off with some excellent bread (my friend and I both preferred the white bread over the wheat and sesame). Takashi has a full bar, and I had a cucumber martini--the bartender definitely poured generously. The two of us ordered 4 small plates and an entree to share, which was the perfect amount of food. Our first courses were the tuna tartare with crispy rice chips, and the crab and lobster sausage. The tuna tartare was light and perfectly seasoned, and DELICIOUS when eaten with the avocado bits and pieces of the rice chips. Party in my mouth! The crab and lobster sausage did not disappoint either. Our second courses were the foie gras and quail, both of which were phenomenal. I'm not usually a big fan of quail, but they did it to perfection. Tender but still juicy with a crisp skin on the outside.. mmm.. Just when we were getting worried that the entree would not live up to the deliciousness of the quail, we were proven to be terribly wrong! We had the special of the night, the Wagyu steak (domestic Kobe beef) with 3 dipping sauces, and it was nothing short of amazing. It was truly unbelievable how the food got better and better with each course! We finished off our meal with a glass of dessert wine, and the vanilla poached pineapple--what a treat.

However, it opened up a chance to converse with our neighbors about the food and wine, which isn't normally possible at such a nice place. The decor was very tasteful. We decided to order the chef's tasting menu with wine pairings since we wanted to experience all that Takashi had to offer. The amuse bouche was tasty, a tuna with mushrooms and tofu in a flavorful brothy sauce. The first course was Hamachi with ginger and a wonderful Tamari soy. the combination was excellent with the Cava that was poured. Next was a deliciously buttery Sauteed Maine Skate Wing that had perfect texture and accompanying foam and ratatouille. Each bite was like a warm smile. The Duck Fat Fried Chicken with Duck Fat Fries was amazing! It was superbly paired with a bright Gewurtztraminer that melded with the duck grease. The Soy-Ginger Caramel Pork Belly was presented with chinese buns and a spicy mustard with daikon. It made a nice tiny sandwich. The flavor explosion was incredible. The Roasted Indiana Duck with Confit of ginger-orange glaze and glazed pearl onions and Kumquat marmalade was a little bland, but only in the duck meat. It was terrific when the glaze was added. A nice smoky Tempranillo evened the sweetness of the fruit. Finally,  we had a Miso Cheesecake with just a bit of glaze and a Japanese dessert with lots of fruit, jello squares, and cream. It was one  of the best desserts that I have ever had.  Our waiter explained every course and was very attentive. Dinner at Takashi was such a wonderful experience.

Of the entrees, I should have ordered the halibut but went with the chicken hot pot instead.  I was a little disappointed.  The chicken was tender but just not that flavorful.  The halibut was AMAZING.  My girlfriend loved her salmon (to which I cannot attest as I'm not a salmon fan).   All in all a great dining experience with high prices to boot.  We spent $100 per person with two bottles of wine.",0.9815,0.8,0.162,0.038,0.6729310344827586

Decor is sort of minimalist. I felt perfectly comfortable wearing jeans, but then again, the jeans I was wearing were dark, and only showed minimal distress (as opposed to the heavily sandblasted pairs that some of the kids are wearing nowadays). They're also straight legged, with the simple outline of an ""h"" on the back pocket, so that helped my cause.  Service was pretty good, but the waiter seemed to get a little annoyed that we were having a conversation with people at the table next to us. I'm not exactly sure why. Our resos were at 9:30 (earliest they would let us in) and I think perhaps they were trying to rush us out so they could close. On to the food... I would say the ingredients here are top quality. The seared tuna was excellent, but was prepared with avocado, arugula, and some sort of ""sweet onion vinaigrette"" dressing, which to me just tasted like any old miso dressing. Just seemed a little too easy. The scallops were fine, but nothing special, despite the ""soba gnocchi"". It tasted like regular gnocchi to me. The celery root foam added little to the dish. If you're looking for something similar, I would try the scallop dish at Jane's over this one. (Yeah, I dropped a j-bomb, what of it?) The pork belly was probably the best thing we had. It was basically a deconstructed bao with a sliced steamed bun and some sort of hoisin-like sauce. The pork was cooked perfectly. Skate wing with lobster sausage was a big thumbsdowner.  The lobster sausage was awful and the skate wing was too fishy for my taste. I wish they'd seared it more, but I assume with such a delicate fish it's hard to cook it like that. Dessert involved something crispy and some chocolate thing with a flan-like consistency. It was actually good if you ate both things together. On their own though, each element wasn't so good. The whole is greater than the sum of all fears and all that... So basically, I found the menu here to be really safe, almost to the point of being uninspired. If this restaurant opened 10 years ago, I think I would have appreciated it more, but in these days of molecular gastronomy and revolutionary flavor combos, this place seems a little boring.

The small plates were delicious and distinct, from the big eye and avocado to the crab fondue. The flavors were complex and enough to rival any fusion place in town. The entrees were actually a bit of a letdown after such adventurous small plates. The skatewing was well-prepared and the salmon was good, but neither wowed me the way the preceding plates had. I'd probably opt to just eat more small plates if I went back on a weekend. The odds that I'd go back on a weekend are pretty much nil, however, as the place is overstuffed and overbooked on a Saturday night. My only real complaints are about that, actually. If I spend decent coin on a meal, I don't want to wait in line behind two people for the only restroom in the place. I also don't want someone's ass next to my face as I am enjoying my dessert (thankfully, it only got really crowded toward the end of our meal as I'd probably have knocked off a couple more stars if I'd had ass in my face for the whole meal). The crowd appeared to make it really difficult for the servers as well. The servers themselves were professional, helpful and prompt.

2008-02-27,3.0,"I was really looking forward to dining here. The menu looked fantastic, combining two of my favs (French/Japanese), the chef was highly praised and the space looked very cool.  While I really enjoyed some dishes, I felt the others were only slightly above-average. First, the space is very small (50 people or so) and the 1st floor is way too bright. The 2nd floor is roomier and more intimate, but I dined on the 1st floor. Here's the good-The seared Big-Eye Tuna cold plate is outstanding. Nice pieces of tuna w/ uber-fresh avocado and hearts of palm paired with a delicious sweet onion sauce-I highly recommend. The warm sweetbreads w/ swiss chard and Dijon sauce were also great.  The prosciutto-wrapped shrimp cold plate was good, just not great. The barramundi fish entree was fantastic, however the lobster sausage that come with it was not so good--the lobster flavor was lost. The chicken in a pot entree consisted of tender chicken and some nice vegetables (eggplant, mushrooms and green bean), but was sort-of bland and re-affirmed the reason I rarely order chicken at a restaurant.  Overall, this is a small place that is too bright on the 1st floor which has some really great choices w/ wonderful flavors and some very ordinary choices with some not-so-wonderful flavors. Maybe they need to work the kinks out. I'll try here again in 2-3 months.",0.9973,0.725,0.264,0.011,0.690877192982456
2008-02-20,4.0,"It's been a while since I went to a restaurant that made me immediately wonder when I would be back.  All the food was amazing!  The bad hair day shrimp was OK, would probably not get that again only because there were so many other great dishes.  I loved the pork belly small plate, it was like Asian comfort food.  The winter roll also stood out, I loved the texture of it.  Our entrees of salmon and the skate wing were also good.  But I think next time we'll get more small plates and maybe split an entree.  Our dessert of roasted pear with caramel ice cream and bleu cheese was AWESOME, I never get dessert but this combo was too yummy to pass up, but would have liked more bleu cheese so my husband and I wouldn't have fight over each sliver.  Can't wait to bring friends back, but would recommend getting a table upstairs.",0.9871,0.76,0.227,0.013,0.5245833333333334
2008-02-11,4.0,"I had a very nice meal here a few Friday's ago. I also made a faux pas when I didn't examine the label of the wine bottle closely enough, and then after it was poured, realized that I had not ordered a Bordeaux, and got really scared that this was a bottle way out of my price range. I told the waiter, and everything ended up working out. I'm not sure who is to blame when that happens, but the servers handled it well, and I learned my lesson.  The food was more Asian fusion rather than strictly Japanese-Francias. We had something like a spring roll, some sweet breads, the pork belly, and the duck main course- all of which we split. The portions are on the small side, but high quality and very tasty.  I liked the ambiance, but the tables to either side of us ruined it. A very loud group of middle-aged ladies talking about their pathetic love lives, and a really awkward couple on the other. Shesh.  It is charming to see Takashi walking around, and watching the patrons as they eat, and I really felt there was a lot of pride in the product here.",0.9464,0.782,0.14,0.078,0.5693611111111111
2008-02-10,4.0,"My wife and I last weekend tried Takashi Noodles at Macy's and last night we ate a lovely dinner at Takashi. Mr. Yagihashi was in the restaurant the entire time, hovering over the kitchen staff, always a good sign. The two of us shared a total of 5 dishes. 1) Tartare of tuna - simple preparation, not earth shattering, but simple and refreshing - was surprised to see it paired with mountain yam. I applaud Takashi for including a strange crunchy viscous slimy vegetable for the American palate 2) Pork belly - The belly was fatty and delicious. I did point out to the waiter that the serving included three pieces of pork belly but only two pieces of bun. He came back with two more pieces of bun - pretty funny, but we had been chatting with the people next to us so they lucked out with the second bun and part of the third piece of pork belly. 3) Bad hair day shrimp - I had been looking forward to this dish based on the reviews here and elsewhere. This was the most disappointing dish - the shrimp truly had a bad greasy hair day. The shrimp wrapped in ohba leaf was completely lost in a tangle of fried stuff.  4) Scallops with gnocchi - This was my favorite dish. I even liked the silly celeriac foam. The scallops were perfect, though at this price range one expects a perfect scallop. The mushrooms were especially meaty and delicious. The sauce was exceptional - I used some baguette to sop up the sauce. 5) Sea bass (entree) - Simple preparation of sea bass with some mini turnips and green beans in what I believe was a very very green shiso leaf based sauce. Perfectly fine dish. 6) Dessert - panna cotta with yuzu and berries + a green tea macaroon. My wife commented the macaroon was decent but not as good as the ones she ate from Laurderee. I pointed out that outside of France, it was a bit much to ask for Laurderee quality macaroons. The panna cotta was good - I liked the tartness of the yuzu against he sweetness of the raspberries and gooseberries (I think). 7) The bread - great. Butter could have been colder/harder. The room was very nice - the two of us sat on the first floor and by 7pm, the place was packed. We had a first seating 5:30 opentable reservation. We were greeted warmly upon entering the place and promptly seated. We never felt rushed and our waiter Jason was professional and delightful. As a note, the place has valet parking and coat check upon entry.  As far as Peter's comments - the chelliwich place mats were just fine for the spirit of the restaurant and even though we ended up chatting with our neighbors on both sides, the tables were spaced decently apart. However, this may have been because there was a table of six (three tables of two?) so that might have given a bit more breathing room for the rest of the tables. The couples on both sides were also eating there for the first time and every person was a serious foodie. I actually traded a bit of tuna tartare and scallop for a taste of the sweetbreads (great!). Now if Takashi could only improve what he calls ramen at the Macys food court.",0.9982,0.788,0.178,0.034,0.5707514880952382
2008-02-02,2.0,"I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars; the food was great French Asian fusion and is outstanding. The tables have placemats, not linen. The stem ware is lovely as was the silverware; however the wooden seat I sat on was uncomfortable. If you like Blackbird you will love this place. Your neighbors on either side are almost in your lap and you are part of their conversations. Only the noise helped to keep you from hearing their entire conversation. There is now a bar on the first floor which was not there when this space was Scylla; I think that contributes to the excessive noise. I would love to give them 5 stars as the food is worthy of it and the price is fair. The portions are on the small side as in a European restaurant and fine. The wine list had a well priced nice selection but if you are going to serve food of this quality you need to spiff up your act.",0.9497,0.845,0.144,0.011,0.5964912280701754
2008-01-26,5.0,"Takashi's new japanese-french fusion is a worthy replacement to the dearly departed Scylla and a terrific addition to the Bucktown dining scene. Overall, the food and service are fantastic. I loved the braised short ribs and the pork belly small plates. Takashi himself went table to table to chat with all the diners and describe the nuances of the dishes - a very nice touch indeed. I will definitely be back again and look forward the opening of the outdoor dining area!",0.9697,0.755,0.245,0.0,0.5854545454545454
2008-01-16,5.0,"Whoa.. I just visited this restaurant and was completely amazed.  From the appropriate wine list to the espresso we were completely in love.  We started with the tuna tartare which was delicious, but not a show stopper.   We continued on to an amazing dish called ""bad hair day shrimp"".   The perfect amount of flavor/spice with a little crunch.  Yum.   The salmon wrapped in proscuitto  was a rich and delicious way to top things off.   We didnt stop there... ended with a milk chocolate mousse with crispy rice and dark caramel... mmmmm.    The service may need a few kinks ironed out, but overall its a must visit for anyone who is really in the mood for an outstanding, innovative experience.",0.9896,0.684,0.283,0.032,0.6112745098039215
2008-01-15,5.0,"This new Japanese - American - French fusion spot is a delight for the taste buds...tuna tartare, 'bad hair day shrimp', chicken in clay pot and seared yellowtail...all fresh and phenomenal.  The ingredients fresh and simple, but the flavors were complex and layered perfectly.  We also indulged in a chocolatey dessert with crisped rice layer that was heaven...the name escapes me. Service was friendly and fairly good, but as a newbie, they still have a few little glitches to work out.  I would bet they will. This is the old Scylla space (may it RIP...sniff)...it is very tiny, although, Takashi makes better use of the first floor.  Negatively, the open kitchen makes for a very warm experience at the bar and neighboring tables.  Ask to be seated upstairs if possible. Takashi hasn't quite hit the mark with atmosphere in my opinion.  They are going for the minimalist look, but it borders on 'prison cell', esp upstairs.  Perhaps this will improve over time. And, I hope Takashi plants roots here...I would highly recommend this place and will definitely return.",0.9885,0.756,0.211,0.033,0.47814185814185806
2008-01-08,5.0,"Although his noodles at Macy's are only average in my book, Takashi Yagihashi created a winner here at his new Bucktown restaurant. His cuisine is best described as American French Japanese fusion. The food definetly packs a punch. Although it can be pricey I think it is well worth it. Notable dishes...
