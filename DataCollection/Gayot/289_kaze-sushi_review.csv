The interior is simplistic, yet classy, and not too expensive.  It is a nice size, with extra seating outside in the summer.  I typically go after 9:30 on the weekend and have no no wait for a seat. Their non-sushi menu makes Kaze Sushi the perfect place to go with someone who does not want sushi.  My husband really likes sushi, but is so enamored with Kaze's filet mignon, which is well portioned and an incredible deal at under $20, that he gets this each time.  It's refreshing to go to a sushi restaurant that does such dishes with an Asian flare, instead of just serving Thai or Chinese food as the sushi alternative. While no particular rolls have yet knocked my socks off, they are all quite worthy, and you get a lot for your money - 2 special rolls are very filling.   So if you want to have a nice sushi meal without the huge price tag of a Japonaise or Marai, I highly suggest Kaze Sushi.",0.9387,0.813,0.129,0.058,0.5906709956709957

I will admit, as my bald-headed friend likes to say, the creative sushi nigiris ""are good,  but not amazing.""  But they are solid. I personally like sushi straight up and traditional, where the freshness of the fish comes to the fore.  What makes Kaze worth visiting are the other dishes. My friends and I had the seasonal tasting menu which was comprised of edamame soup, some creative pieces of nigiri including a kobe beef one, a delectable fish entree, topped off  by a spicy taco sashimi and some maki rolls. Oh yeah, and the degustation comes with three wine pairings. All for just $45 bucks. We ended by splitting two desserts among the three of us: the asparagus mousse (YUMMY) and another yummy pear one, me forgets what it wuz called.  Now, I do wish that Chicago in general had some super fresh fish (probably Katsu is the freshest I have had in Chicago, but unfortunately nothing in Chicago comes close to Tokyo or Tsukiji; sorta like a delusional American girl in high school who thinks she's hot vs. a girl in Eastern Europe who is like Ms. Model of the Year, no comparison, ) .

2009-08-10,4.0,"I had heard from clients and friends how much they loved this place. I mean ""glazed eyes, slight drips of saliva drips out of their mouths as they ponder the moments they savored the variety of dishes they had their last"" love. Since I had a special dinner coming up, (and I not being the biggest sushi expert or fan), I needed to make sure I was making the right choice, consulting one of the top sushi experts in Chicago: Brett D gave me the thumbs up. I made reservations and decided to try the craze. I'm glad I did.  Being ever so adventurous, this place had some lofty goals to reach. I've discovered my new favorite sushi place in LA, (The Hump), and made me experience nirvana, I was slightly worried about coming here. Such pressure I placed on this locale, but they rose and did admirable job. We sat down for dinner at 6:30pm, we were quickly greeted by our server Ryan who really helped explain everything we needed to know. Everything from the menu to the drinks, friendly, but always kept a good pace and never was too pushy or lingered too long. We decided to do a bottle of the very dry sake. To be fair and honest, I am not the biggest sake drinker and this night I wasn't really in the mood for drinking, but it was slightly sweet and a fine choice. I was really starving for some marine protein.  We opted for the ""Chef's Special"". Course after course until you throw in the towel and say mercy. They can go by a price limit or no limit, we did the later. It sounded like a good way for our evening to go. With a smile, thumbs up and full steam ahead we pressed on.  I will say we had about 8 or 9 courses, however they do get a wee bit hazy to go through all of them, however I will try and muster up some details for all those that we had.  We started with a carrot and miso soup with crab lump meat, chive and whipped cream. The slightly spicy, seasoned soup was mere heaven and despite the oppressive heat outside, I certainly could have gone for an entire bowlful and been happy as a clam.. er crab. The next dish were small river crabs, fried and dusted with a salty and spicy mix. For those who are not brave of heart, this might shock seeing tiny little crabs, legs and all, but let me tell you. they were amazing! The miso peanut sauce enhanced these lil' guys, but on their own I could have had a dozen. The salmon carpacio was really very good. Thinly pounded salmon with a few oils over the top, but the jelly fish really put this dish over the top. I have to say it was a bit rich for me, since the salmon is already a fatty fish, the oil just enhanced that, a bit much for me, but still flavorful and delicious. The shrimp spring roll with shrimp, cream cheese and chive with accompanying smoked tomato and avocado tartar was delicious. Simply delicious. The hamachi with beets, radish greens and a watercress dressing was good, but I found a few of my hamachi to be a little hard to chew a little. Perhaps I got a bad slice, though the other ones were quite good and the beets added a great texture to the dish. The radish greens had the pungent bite of a radish, while the dressing managed to cool it off and pull it all together.  Oh there were a few more, but all in all the place was a great sushi adventure. We decided to do dessert else where as none of the dessert spoke to us that night, but the staff was friendly, the dishes were creative and for the most part delicious. Even though you do pay for such a prized meal, I still will have no hesitation in coming back.",0.9991,0.753,0.206,0.041,0.5413102904040404

The Kobe Beef nigiri marinated in pear and tomato puree, torched with garlic butter and  finished with dry shiitake mushrooms, green onions and sesame seeds was another favorite.   As for dessert, we shared a dessert sampler plus the braised asian pear.  Growing up, my mom would never serve cakes or pastries for dessert, but rather fruit and an assortment of Japanese jello and puddings.  This sampler is what I would conjure up as my ideal type of dessert: not too sweet, use of fresh fruit, and beautifully presented.  Asparagus pudding and Asian pear really finished the dinner beautifully.",0.9907,0.785,0.187,0.028,0.4716

Was presented beautifully and the food was better than a lot of other Japanese places. But they lose stars because of value and the fact that they didn't just have a variety sashimi plate that we could order. The rolls were made well but did not showcase the fish and it almost seemed like a very expensive gimmick. There were cheeses and sauces and creams that seemed to overwhelm the fish. The two show stoppers were simply the tuna tartar and the sashimi tuna pieces that were ordered. Simple and elegant with clean flavor. If you are an occasional Japanese eater and like pretty maki rolls this is a great trendy place to be. If you are a purist, just stick with the sashimi pieces individually ordered.

Friends of mine ordered a cornucopia of maki rolls and we waited for our food without any disturbance from traffic (as the patio is on the side street and not on Roscoe!).  Once the food came out, I dug into my Dragon maki and enjoyed the freshness of the eel and gladly wrapped my maki in ginger and then dipping the sushi into soy sauce mixed with wasabi. This roll was exceptional because the eel tasted fresh and left my taste buds wanting for more.

You set your own budget for the ""Omakase"" and we went pretty high at $130.. We started with a great HotPot that was similar to Miso but loaded with great seafood. Next came a Bison Sashimi that was excellent except it was literally swimming in WAY too much sweet sauce. The chef's version of a salad was a weird Shabu-Shabu with a avocado creme brulee.. It was not good IMO.. too many steps and the flavors did not meld at all. Also had a Spicy Toro mix that was served with wonton wrapped fried shrimp with cream cheese, very good and inventive. Finally got around to the sushi, they brought us 6 pieces of Nigiri with a laundry list of ingredients, most were good to very good. I will say this the worst aspect of the night was our server. She was professional and explained the dishes, however, she had zero personality and seemed ""put-off"" when we asked a few additional questions about our food. At the end of the night she literally disappeared and another waiter finished serving us. The place was not crowded at all so I have no idea what happened. We even asked our new waiter what was up...

However, there are a few things about it that made it move toward the bottom of my list when choosing a place to grab sushi. 1: There is pretty much always a wait (even with a reservation) 2: It's a bit pricier than other equivalent sushi joints 3: The very first time I went there I was told I'm ""not allowed to do sake bombs"" The first two are reasonable enough and basically expected in Roscoe Village. And the third, well, let's just say it pissed me off. I'm not a sake bomber that drops the little cup into the big cup (and I told the waitress that), so who the hell are they to tell me how to (or not to) drink my sake. Alright, with that rant out of the way, I have to say that their fish is always fresh and the service is always good (even if they're bossy..). I also like the fact that they have outdoor seating on a little patio. They also have an extensive and impressive menu, which always has some unique seasonal specials to try.

Having heard rave reviews about Kaze's soups - we started with the carrot soup and the special of the night, a white asparagus with fried fois gras and lump crab meat. The carrot soup was rich, but not rich enough to fill a small espresso cup, but despite the small portion the flavor was wonderful and I especially enjoyed the combination of the miso with the carrot. As for the asparagus soup it was on the sweeter side, but we had difficulty detecting the asparagus. We moved on to some nigiri sushi and their standard tofu salad. The nigiri was probably the highlight of the entire meal. My favorite was salmon topped with garlic puree and truffle oil - so savory and delicious. The tofu was lightly fried in the salad creating a frittata like texture. I am not usually a fan of tofu and the preparation in this salad was awesome. Finally, we ended the meal with some handrolls.

2009-04-15,5.0,"Kaze Sushi certainly lives up to the great reviews that everyone has given it. I'll admit that I am not a sushi expert, but even weeks after the fact, I still think about the maki rolls I had.  I came here with a friend on a Saturday evening exploring the neighborhood. We didn't know what we wanted to eat and settled on Kaze despite not making a reservation. It was okay though since they had room for us at the sushi bar. I may not be paying close enough attention but from a glance, you cannot tell from Kaze Sushi's facade that it is a sushi restaurant. I can't seem to find any large sign drawing attention to it, proclaiming its presence in flashing lights, or a simple awning with its name. Instead, you just can't help but walk closely to the building, look inside through its large windows at the creative and clean softness that describes the restaurant's interior, and notice the sushi chefs in their white uniforms to determine that it is, indeed, Kaze Sushi.  As my friend and I sat at the sushi bar, we admired the chefs' artistry and tried not to stare inappropriately at the sculpted maki rolls that were being served. We pored over the regular menu, seasonal menu and extensive specialty menu that took quite a while for our server to explain, while wiping our hands on the hot towels they provided. Ultimately, we decided on the Pink 2 roll described in the regular menu (shrimp tempura, unagi, tobiko, an assortment of vegetables and mame nori), and my friend and I tried hard to surpress smiles over our instant desire to order their daily special maki roll with unagi, shrimp, cream cheese and...ripe mango! The Pink 2 roll is named so because its wrapper is pink! The roll itself was delicious and a good complement to our sweeter maki roll choice with the mango. Two rolls were definitely not enough for two ladies, so we ordered another mango roll and were content and stuffed. Overall, great dining experience in a nice neighborhood, and looks like a perfect date locaton. I will make sure to make a reservation next time.",0.9975,0.796,0.193,0.011,0.5158562763401473

I really wanted to drink the soup out of the bowl, but the bowl itself was so large (and the portion of soup so small) that it just wouldn't work. We ordered a bunch of standard nigiri (since they didn't really have any fish specials) and good thing I asked because they serve them as individual pieces instead of two at a time. Very odd. The actual highlight of the meal was the (cooked and breaded) Black Cod served with some kind of chocolate sauce, strawberries and slivers of almonds.

The food.  Our server told us about the seasonal nigiri with toppings that they are famous for, but it didn't seem all that interesting so we opted for the ""typical chef's selection"" for roughly $60/person.  The menu seemed almost scant and I wasn't in the mood to read through it, so I opted for other Yelpers suggestions and did the chef's choice.   Here's what we were served: Sweet potato soup, Japanese snapper, bigeye sashimi with chives and other herbs, cooked whitefish lightly tempura-ed with shrimp, tuna tartare with avacado served with shrimp in a crisp spring roll, bonito with the Katsuo, white tuna and kanpachi nigiri with toppings. The white tuna nigiri was by far the best item of the night, very fresh.  The potato soup was great too, the lobster stock added a lot of flavor and I'm a big fan of the puree.  I really liked the spring roll that was served with the tuna tartare.  The other fish items, while interesting, I thought were on the heavy side with a bit too much soy or sesame oil which drowned out all flavor of the actual sashimi and at times tasted almost Chinese.  Did not like the Kanpachi.  Surpringly, at the end of the meal I was quite satisfied and full. For presentation (both food and decor), Kaze is a 5.  I see all the French influences here and I appreciate it.  Service was also a 5, as I'd expect it to be when ordering the ""Chef's selection"".  Our server was knowledgeable, elaborated on the contents and preparation of each dish and kept my water glass full.  For taste, I'm more of a sushi purist and don't really like too much fusion, so I'm reserving judgement here.  For the little odds and ends though, Kaze gets a 3.  Kaze-san needs to enjoy owning and running his restaurant more.  Overall, Kaze is solid, probably an excellent date venue to impress. To me it's a marginal 4 but giving it the benefit of the doubt since a) I did leave feeling like I got my money's worth and b) no other place in Chicago serves up the kind of elaborate sashimi Kaze does.",0.9982,0.805,0.173,0.022,0.4487825016513542

It honestly was sex in my mouth. Sex. In. My mouth. I recommend anyone to go and request this dish.  Avocado maki, vegetable tempura maki, soft-shell crab maki were great as well. Wonderful texture and a great wasabi. We had originally requested a spicy tuna maki but the waiter recommended a specialty roll that included sweet potato tempura in the roll with minced spicy tuna and two other things that I can't remember on top. The blend of tastes was magnificent. I put the first bite into my mouth and started giggling. My date was equally impressed and pleased. So much that we did not say no to the dessert menu.  Asparagus pudding? Interesting enough to not say no to.  Beautiful preparation. A white circle in the middle of an exquisite raspberry reduction. Beautiful. Just beautiful.

Some have been absolutely wonderful, others... almost.   Reservation highly recommended.  Since I live in the neighborhood, my wife and I walk to Kaze often when craving sushi.  And many times, we were turned down for a table because we didn't have a reservation, even if the entire restaurant is empty.  We've often settled for something else on the street and on our way back, walk by Kaze to still a half empty restaurant.

Many mis-cues on service.  The waiter was unable to make any minor changes/additions because the POS didn't have a button for what we requested.  We were also told they pre-make many of their rolls.  I think you're paying for decor and hype, not for the quality of the meal.   We left rather frustrated for many reasons and are going to stick with Agami in Uptown.",-0.3379,0.831,0.09,0.079,0.5195454545454545

I won't claim I'm a sushi specialist, but I definitely qualify for the term of 'attentive eater' who's looking for a different experience. We tried the tasting fall menu, which ended being a nice combination of price and quality (I understand $40-50 is no slouch, but I also think you have  to pay for quality ingredients). The courses were inventive and surprising with a fairly nice balance of flavors and textures. I would NOT recommend the wine/sake pairing with the tasting menu. Although the one sake was great, the 2 glasses of wine selections combined poorly or neutrally at best with the food. Lastly, the restrained but controlled desserts selection were surprisingly delicious for this type of place. I recommend them (we tried the sesame custard and the asparagus 'flan'). Desserts were just really tasteful and a little playful (never seen what I thought were fresh sesame seeds before!!!). The underlying taste also strongly reminded me of other simpler asian treats that are bean-based. I'm curious to know who's making the desserts over there...

While finishing our drinks, my boyfriend mentioned that he was really hot.  I had been thinking the same thing but had initially passed it off as being a lightweight and feeling the effects of two Kirins.  Upon further inspection in the bathroom, we noticed we were both bright red and had a rash covering our necks, upper chests and had some lovely splotches all over our backs and arms.  Neither of us had ever had a shellfish allergy and it seemed improbable that if one of us developed an allergy it would kick in at the same time.  I mean we're close and all but that was too much of a kawinkydink.  We immediately went to our waiter and talked to the chefs and not to any fault of theirs, no one could figure out the problem and there had been no other complaints that night. After the benedryl had kicked in, I did a little googling and discovered the Scombroid fish poisoning which is caused by tuna and related fish which spoils due to improper refridgeration.  I admit I am guilty of online diagnosis but the pictures of rashes along with symptoms identical to ours sealed the deal - not to mention we had eaten every fish/culprit possible.  To add further validity to my theory, I also called my dad, a doctor, who agreed our symptoms were not due to an allergic reaction but food poisoning associated with bad fish.   I did try to contact the restaurant but haven't heard back which peeves me a bit.  I am sure this was a freak occurance however I think others should be aware if they experience the same symptoms while at Kaze or any other sushi place for that matter.  Also, while I understand Kaze is loved by most, I cannot justify higher than a 1 star for food poisoning.",-0.9487,0.776,0.1,0.124,0.49718567251461987

First Course (Salad):  Although I don't think I would love it so much to seek it out, the summer salad was quite tasty.  I loved the combination of the asparagus, shrimp, crabmeat and especially the black olive dressing.  However, I felt that the cauliflower sorbet was somewhat overpowering and too sweet so I just put less on each bite.   Second Course (Nigiri Sushi):  My absolute favorite was the katsuo, where the flavor exploded in my mouth...the fried garlic added a lot to the piece.  My second favorite was the ika...I'm not too fond of squid nigiri but this one was exquisite and the texture was amazing.  One thing that disappointed was the white tuna, which was so hyped up in my head as I've seen rave reviews on it.  Don't get me wrong, the white tuna melted in my mouth...but I could not taste the banana-wasabi puree at all...and it wasn't just me as my dinner companion could not taste it as well.  The other two, the unagi and especially the spicy tuna weren't anything too special for me as I felt the unagi was too chewy and the spicy tuna was something that I could order at other sushi restaurants.  We also ordered a couple of uni nigiris on the side and they were super creamy and delicious. Third Course (Sashimi and Makimono): I enjoyed the white tuna soft shell crab maki very much.  The combination of the crispy crab and crunchy beet went perfectly together.  Kaze's pick of the sashimi was seared blue fin, which I actually disliked and was my least favorite of the meal. Fourth Course (Entree): Kaze's rendition of crab cake gave me the impression of a crab cake pot pie although personally for me, the fruit did not add too much to it.  However, I'm not really one of those people who enjoy fruit in my dishes unless it's for dessert.  But I liked the dish as a whole, especially because it was a heartier finish to the meal.   Did not get dessert as we were heading to the movies afterwards and I had to save room for popcorn but will have to try next time I go back as the asparagus pudding sounds very intriguing.  Overall, the meal did not blow me away but it was delicious and the presentation was beautiful.",0.9978,0.775,0.184,0.041,0.5237922077922079
2008-06-24,4.0,"I'm one of those people who loves sushi but is kinda lost about what to order--other than the fact that I know I don't like eel. So last night I went to Kaze with a couple of friends. It has a really pretty, fine dining kind of atmosphere--white linen and all--without making me feel like I had to dress up or something to be there. Our waiter was really nice and knowledgeable. I was THISCLOSE to just telling him to pick something out for me, I trusted him that much. He told us about all of the specials in great detail, and then we made him pick the best one. I had a Bonsai martini, which was fruity and tasty, but I didn't think it would pair well with my sushi, so after I finished it I switched to a  Sapporo. Like I said, I love sushi but I never know what I'm eating. I can at least tell you that the smoke salmon and cheese roll (usually called a Philadelphia roll, right?) was SOOOO good... my mouth is watering right now just thinking about it. The chef does an amazing job, all around, of mixing flavors so subtley. One of our rolls (sorry guys, wish I could tell you which one... I think it did have eel in it but I ate it anyway... eel and like, crab tempura or something) was like that chewing gum in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory--new flavors kept popping up! Just when I thought I had a grasp on it, I started to taste something new! The service was damn near perfect. We had ordered a couple of appetizers and they came perfectly, one after the other, followed by our entrees--well, followed by our rolls. I guess that's not really entrees. I never sat with a dirty plate in front of me. My water glass was always full. And I enjoyed making eyes at one of the adorable waiters (I think I'm seeing a behavior trend on my part, here), who was kind enough to smile back at me. Always puts an extra perk to the experience.

I'm excited to go back and try this all again at a table.  We made the reservation on Saturday afternoon, so we were stuck at the sushi bar, which in and of itself was very cool.  You have a front row seat watching the (very talented) chefs, but are a little crowded.  I was basically on two dates at once. The cocktails also leave a little to be desired.  I started with the ""geisha"": sake, cran, sour mix and followed that up with the saketini (basically sake and vodka).  Not good.  My night was basically over after that - too strong. I saw a lot of people ordering the lychee martini, maybe that's better.  All in all - great.  I will go back. Plus, we sort of have to since someone on the talk boards convinced Justin to buy all these $25 gift cards for $3 and they're only good Mon-Wed.  :) On that note - anyone want to go back to Kaze (or Sola) on a Monday - Wednesday? :) ******UPDATE - Went to Kaze for my birthday with my non-sushi eating mother and sushi-fan dad.  Justin, my dad and I were eager to go with the chef selection option, but were concerned about leaving my mom out of several courses.  The waiter and chef concocted a five course meal for her of entirely cooked fish.  I was beyond impressed and so thrilled that she could be included.  They even made her a nigiri plate of all cooked fish - she loved it.  I hate to use the word ""sweet"", but it was.  The chef and waiter were incredibly thoughtful and made for a fantastic evening ... that and the new addition of sparkling sake to the libations menu - YUM. ;)",0.9978,0.747,0.232,0.021,0.6280363155363153

The food, on the other hand, is sublime.  Extremely fresh fish, which made me wish we hadn't ordered rolls for dinner.  Allie, who isn't known as a nigiri woman was even commenting on how she wished we had gone more raw rather than more roll.  The udon is also really good, though they do skimp a bit on the noodles.  The desert was creative as well, their version of mochi, but consisting of more green tea ice cream and watermelon puree than mochi.  Definitely a place to go creative and eat the raw fish rather than the staple rolls.  Deep fried soft shell crab really isn't that different no matter where you go ... All in all, a damn fine sushi restaurant, but sit at a table, even if watching the sushi masters at work is pretty cool! P.S.

I can only imagine how stuffed and happy everyone must have been after a sushi extravaganza with the sushi chefs of Kaze!! I went with a girlfriend on a Sunday night to grab a quick bite and what started out as a casual, thrown together evening turned quickly into a culinary delight.....  We were a little under-dressed given the more upscale nature of the restaurant, but the food really does match the decor. Everything was cut perfectly and tasted fabulous. We had hamachi and toro sashimi and a few makimono (Shrimp Cheese and Soft-Shell Crab with Salmon). Both rolls were big, bold and delicious. The fact that all of the rolls made with cream cheese on the menu are accompanied by the word ""cheese"" just sounds off to me....  Unagi Cheese, Shrimp Cheese, Smoked Salmon Cheese....  Ick. Fortunately it tastes as great as it does or I may have sworn off cheese altogether (eh, not so likely....)  My only hesitation in a 5 star review was for the lack of signage... no sign out front so we weren't even sure if the restaurant was open or not. Also, once we were inside, the place is BRIGHT!!!

Man, was I was disappointingly underwhelmed. I don't fancy myself to be a creature of habit when it comes to food - I LOVE trying new things.  So I didn't want to go into this highly-touted place and order the same sorts of things I'd order at any other sushi joint.  So I ordered the prix fixe summer chef's tasting menu.  It was four courses, three of which had a wine pairing (included in the price).  They have all the dishes on the tasting available a la carte on the menu so, adding it up and including he wine, it seemed like a fantastic bargain.  I also figured that the chef's tasting selection would be the best that Kaze had to offer...by chef's choice. In all the four courses (all of which had at least 2 different concoctions to it) not one item I put in my mouth - NOT ONE - made me go ""Wow, that's tasty!"".  As a matter of fact, many of them made me go ""wow...that's gross"". 1st course - Summer Salad: The tofu bit had the consistency of flan.  The flavors were underwhelming.  The presentation screamed ""trying too hard"".  The tofu skin shooter that came with it was the consistency of slimy mucus and tasted sweet, milky and earthy. 2nd course - Nigiri Sushi: I had such high hopes for this 'cause it looked like it was gonna be great...a haute cuisine spin on nigiri.  The flavor and texture combinations ranged from bland to gross.  Surprisingly, the Bonito was the best of the 5.  I was originally wary when my husband reminded me that Bonito flakes were a favorite cat treat. 3rd course - Sashimi and Makimono: BORING.  Two slices of seared ahi...OK.  4 bits of avacado/scallion maki roll...uh huh.  Two slices of cucumber with wasabi mayo...yeah.  Some other kind of white fish (more tuna?) in some ponzu-type sauce...now we're talkin'!  oops...maybe not...yuck. 4th course - Baked Whitefish entree paired with a smoked salmon and cream cheese-filled profiterole-type dough thing: Another reviewer speculated that Kaze is not really a Japanese restaurant but a fusion place of Japanese and, perhaps, French.  He/she must've had this dish because I could totally see that in this.  It wasn't unpalatable (like some of the things I ate here) but Chef's attempt at pairing sweet and savory really missed the mark on this one. I understand what Kaze is trying to do and I applaud it - I LOVE this kind of cuisine, ESPECIALLY when there's raw fish, lots of small dishes and a myriad of sauces involved.  Sadly, it's just that none of it was very good.  SO much of it screamed ""trying really hard!"" and just missed the mark.  Plus, for some reason, many of the concoctions had this weird, unappealing earthy flavor to it.  My husband ordered a la carte from the menu, all different things from what I had.  He had 4 other small dishes and none of his were very good either. The table next to ours got a lot of good-looking stuff so maybe we just picked all the wrong things.  Because of this and the nice patio-seating I might give Kaze another chance in the future.  But until then, Mirai still reigns for best sushi in my book.",0.9893,0.835,0.115,0.051,0.5010224960224959

Overall, it's a good sushi place for the ""modern"" style that's popular around the area.  It's more interesting than Agami (although similar in style) but not as traditional as Katsu - or even Mirai, for that matter.  I'll probably be back, based on the freshness of their fish alone!",0.9761,0.813,0.172,0.015,0.4552272727272728

The fish either tastes too ""fishy"", or is overwhelmed by the seasonings and garnishes added.  If you ever make it out to California, I strongly suggest trying almost ANY sushi restaurant to have your palate better experience what balance in sushi dishes should be like.

2007-04-29,1.0,"I really don't mean to be a sushi sob, but I've dined at Gonpachi, the best Japanese restaurant in Tokyo, and possibly the world. This was where Junichiro took Bush in a bid to impress him. And I grew up in Asia, where Japanese cuisine was embraced long before American palates got round to the idea of eating raw fish. I know my tempura from my katsu and my unagi from my hamachi, if you know what I mean. In my trip to Tokyo last year I fell in love with Japan; and especially its food. I tasted the best. So when I say I think Kaze is a bad Japanese restaurant, I'm saying it from a point of view of someone who knows what good, traditional Jap food is. And someone who was.....disappointed and appalled. After all the reviews on yelp, how could I not have any expectations? Maybe that was my mistake. It's like having great expectations of a boyfriend. Better to have none. First, my udon noodle soup was doused with an overenthusiastic hand of pepper, killing the natural taste of the miso and the udon.  My unagi monomaki was soaked in sticky sweet sauce, overpowering the taste of the eel itself (and what little eel did they give too!) The salmon sashimi was OK, but forgettable. And most most heartbreakingly, was the hamachi. It was stale. I kid you not. When I bit into it, and grimaced and could not eat any further. It was the worse yellowtail I have ever eaten. When we checked with the chef to see if it was fresh ( I was afraid of food poisoning by then, because bad raw fish is deadly), he was kind enough to apologize and send us another serving, which was, thankfully, much much better. Apparently, the first serving was of the ""loin"" the not-so-good-part. What I really did not get, was how FISHY the hamachi smelt and tasted. This was very telling of the chef's skills- the way the knife is used in cutting sushi actually determines the fishiness and taste of the fish. True Jap sushi masters take 20 years to learn HOW TO CUT A FISH. Hamachi is the least fishy of all the sushi types, and should NOT have been that overpowering.  So what can I say? We could not wait to get out of there fast enough. On retrospect, I do understand all the hype about Kaze- it was really about the 'innovativeness"" of the menu- it was more fusion (Americanized?) Jap than traditional Jap. But the thing is, Jap cuisine, in essence, is about the purity of the ingredients. Nothing is supposed to overpower the natural freshness of the fish or meat. Essentially, it is about the intricate balance of the dish. The best Jap dishes use the LEAST sauces/flavorings. That's why I balked when I saw balsamic dressing and pear  and foie gra etc etc mixed into a Jap dish. It just went against all that I knew and believed about the beauty of the Japanese meal.

The wine & sake pairings were right on.  Service was knowledgable and pleasant, and the restaurant itself is very nicely designed.  We've been talking about it all week and we will definitely be back.  Wow.",0.9783,0.775,0.195,0.03,0.6991596638655463
2007-01-18,4.0,"I actually had no expectations walking into Kaze.  I just looked up Sushi on citysearch, found this place, and we went.  I liked their entire menu, not just the sushi.  I thought the appetizer was fantastic, all of our sushi was delicious, and the asian pear dessert was out of this world.   This place doesn't get the fifth star because of the price.  I'm not big into super fancy sushi places, and the fresh fish doesn't justify the price to me.  You can get fresh fish and not have to pay the hefty price in my opinion.  However, they take the typical Japanese menu and add flair, flavors, and creativity to it.   I'll definitely add this to my rotation of sushi places, but will get immediate heartburn after seeing the bill....wow I'm getting stingy in my old age!",0.595,0.848,0.103,0.049,0.45654761904761904
2007-01-12,5.0,"My table of four really enjoyed our Friday night Kaze Sushi experience.  We had reservations at six and had fun watching the small place fill up while we ate.   Between us, we tried a wide variety of options.  We started off with warm edamame, which never fails.  Then, we each tried a soup including an average miso, an amazing and spicy sweet potato, and a tiny but delectable carrot. The picky one among us had a very reasonably priced filet with garlic mashed potatoes and a salad he loved.  The rest of us sampled caterpillar, spicy tuna, smoked salmon cheese, and California makimono.  Everything was both fresh and delicious, but the caterpillar (shrimp tempura surrounded by avocado) really stood out as our favorite.  We also tried a buttery white fish in a jalapeno soy sauce off of their special nightly menu, which was outstanding. When the steak came at the same time as the small plate of white fish, I was worried that the carnivore would be done with his meal before we got the rest of our sushi, but all of our rolls came out on one large plate just a minute later.  Our waitress was great and very timely.   Desert was an adventure.  We all shared the sampler platter and were really impressed with the beautiful presentation.  The asparagus pudding is something you really should experience for yourself! I would definitely go back to Kaze.  The sushi bar would be a great spot for a date!",0.9972,0.737,0.253,0.01,0.5074193548387096
2007-01-04,5.0,"One of the better sushi restaurants I've been to.  Excellent standard menu and seasonal menu.  The service I've had here has been top notch, if a little over the top at times (see Bee B's review).  Items that really stand out for me are the Bison app, Venison, Black Cod, & the Pink 2 roll.  A welcome addition to the Roscoe Village area!",0.9098,0.8,0.2,0.0,0.4833333333333334

I highly recommend the tofu salad for an appetizer- the tofu was in it was the yummiest I have maybe ever had, an excellent combination of sweet and savory. The sushi was fresh and delicious.  Kaze was one of the better sushi experiences I have had in Chicago.",0.9824,0.643,0.357,0.0,0.7424999999999999
2006-12-16,5.0,"One of the hardest things to find in Chicago is a great sushi restaurant.  Don't get me wrong, there are several sushi places that are decent but not great.  I found Kaze randomly a couple years ago with a buddy and it has truly been one of the best.   The quality of the sushi is top notch from fresh fish flown from either the seas near Japan to coastal fishes on the East Coast of the US.  The ""seasonal menu"" is definitely a must try.  I think their main specialty is the sauces that they create and use with their dishes.  They also have other dishes besides sushi and they are very delicious as well, such as the curry venison dish.   I would definitely try to call ahead for a reservation since the size of the restaurant is not as large and it fills up very quickly.  The staff there are very friendly and enjoy explaining the poetic dish descriptions for you.",0.995,0.727,0.273,0.0,0.5454081632653062

2006-07-18,5.0,"Incredible flavors---be sure to order from the specials menu. The other food is good, but their specials are the main focus, very unusual flavor combinations that work out quite nicely. If you are looking for traditional sushi this place probably won't be for you, but if you are looking to taste something different, check it out, and you will be surprised.....wasabi banana puree on seared toro???

2006-06-20,5.0,"So... after hearing endless raves on Kaze from my boyfriend... we finally went there... for my birthday. I have to admit that it lived up to every expectation. My boyfriend is a sushi snob and disses most of the Chicago restaurants. This is his favorite in the city and I can understand why. It is small, intimate, tastefully decorated... superior service and the ultimate in freshness. We had a table of 8 and we took our time with an amazing meal. My man called ahead and spoke with the chef to do a course meal for us. No one ordered, no one knew what was coming ... and everyone was impressed. Considering the quality and the number of courses... 7 plus dessert.... I think it was a bargain. Small wine list... great service... amazing quality....

2006-06-19,3.0,"I think I was expecting a lot more from this place after reading the rave reviews. The sushi was decent and fresh but the portions were small. And I thought that the price was comparable or maybe a tad bit cheaper than other places in the same category, but the portions a lot smaller. And the service was SLOW. (I went on a Monday night and it was crowded but not packed.) It was a cute, trendy restaurant with a nice outdoor patio.",0.8537,0.884,0.116,0.0,0.5787878787878789
2006-06-10,5.0,"The best sushi restaurant I have ever been to.  If you love sushi and have not been here I recommend making this your next stop.  The scallop salad is amazing and the large selection of maki make it hard to choose.  When I was there I also tried the Chef's special sashimi which that day was Red Snapper with a balsamic reduction, which was so good I should have ordered two.  This place gets very busy so reservations are highly recommended.",0.9518,0.714,0.224,0.062,0.4428787878787878
2006-05-25,5.0,We were there on a Tuesday night when they had a tasting menu.  I was so glad we were because we would have been hard-pressed to decide what to order from this unique sushi restaurant.  I have never seen so many cooked meats and fishes on the menu of a sushi place before.  Each course was paired with wine.  Every course was phenomenal in its own way.  Nothing was like I had ever tasted before.  To call this establishment a sushi restaurant is to box it into a category it simply does not fit in.  I am not sure what to call it but just know it was fabulous.,0.7748,0.889,0.082,0.028,0.7384479717813051
2006-04-04,5.0,Excellent fresh sushi- some of the best I have ever tasted in Chicago. The chef must really know their stuff because they also have a ton of very unique rolls and other dishes. It is fairly new and I have ordered their delivery and pick up a bunch of times. The place is pretty small and is usually busy when I stop by.  I have not actually eaten in the resturant yet - but the delivery guy is real nice!,0.8777,0.824,0.156,0.02,0.5524621212121212
