2007-12-23,5.0,"I love The Grotto... the ambiance is great.. the service is great.. the food is fantastic.. presentation is great...  I always suggest getting the osso bucco, which is their signature veal dish that is slow roasted for 4 hours, and is served with this rich risotto and comes out spoon tender.  It's a huge dish but is perfect to have some extra to take home.  Good place to bring a date.",0.9411,0.795,0.205,0.0,0.6818181818181818
2007-12-03,4.0,"Grotto has excellent food.  It really doesn't do the business it deserves.  I think that has to do with its unfortunate location in Newberry Plaza.  You can't see it from the street, so people go to all the other restaurants there (Carmine's, Hugo's, Gibson's, and Tavern.)  Grotto is SO much better than all of those places.   Mon-Thurs they have a small plates menu with things you wouldn't expect to see on the menu at an Italian place, but if you're with a group of people, you can get lots of stuff cheap. Grotto has an amazing seafood salad served with crab claws.  Minestrone is great.  If you want pasta go with cavatelli or 8-finger with any sauce you like.  Some of the other pastas can be overcooked, but that's pretty common.  You won't have that problem if you go with the cavatelli.  Bone-in filet (I don't eat it, but have been present when many a dining companion has ordered it) is one of the best in the city.  They always have fish specials that are good, and they will prepare whatever fish they have any way you like.  (Try vesuvio or oreganata).  I also LOVE the green bean salad, so good and fresh but make sure whoever you eat with has a bite too because it's super garlicky and you'll make them sick the rest of the night. Please the next time you want to go to a restaurant in the Viagra triangle, choose Grotto.  I promise it's better than all the others!",0.9972,0.731,0.248,0.021,0.5389499389499389

The menu is so varied ($9 sandwiches - $40 steaks, there was something for everyone!) We didn't stick around for the ""club"" scene after dinner (we like pubs much better), but I will definitely head back for dinner sometime.  Crab cake appetizer was awesome, and the basket of bread they give you when you first sit down was enormous!",0.9421,0.813,0.187,0.0,0.538888888888889
2007-10-29,2.0,"I wasn't very impressed. I had a  restaurants.com  $25 gift certificate and was very excited by the Italian small plates menu. When we got there we found out they only offer that Monday - Thursday.  We started with a round of drinks - and let me disgress for a second by saying that in a bar like this I expect the bartender to offer me a drink or wine list and tell me any drink specials when I sit down. Coming over and saying hi and then staring at me with a raised eyebrow is not good service. I ordered a glass of wine which was $10 and  excellent and my husband had a glass of scotch (also $10). After my husband ordred a second drink - bud light which we later found out sold for the absurd price of $5 - we heard the another server tell his table that they had $5 cosmos. We would have ordred them had we known.   We needed to spend $50 so we opted to order a few appetizers.  We started with a crabcake which was okay. After being spoiled on the Oceanaire crabcake in Seattle (all crab, no filler, big  chunks of crab baked, not fried) I'm a bit of a crabcake snob. This one was about a 6 out of 10 - the one at Rockit is actually better.  We also shared a ceasar salad which was good,  meatballs which were pretty tasty, and a plate of mussels. I have a hard time with mussels - I like them but only if they are smaller. These mussels were the size of jumbo scallops so my options were to put one huge one in my mouth and try to chew it or swallow it whole, or try to cut the chewy thing. Neither worked so I only ate one.  Throughout our meal (we sat at the bar) we were largely ignored for the other patrons. All over 55, they were clearly regulars. They all knew each other, and received quick and attentive service from the bartenders while we waited for refills.  After all that, our bill ended up being close to $70 so we still spent over $50 with tax and tip. The meal and service were definately not worth it. I'm still intrigued by the small plates menu, but I really don't know if I would bother coming back for it.",0.3728,0.887,0.06,0.053,0.4937151437151437
2007-08-19,5.0,"I can't believe that all this time I have lived in Chicago and I have never eaten here until last night! A friend of mine was in town from Atlanta.  Originally we were going to Hugo Frog's but it was a 2 hour wait.  The hostess recommended that we try The Grotto. Although it was busy, they were able to accomodate us.  Not sure if that was luck or if they are really that nice. We settled into a table near the enclosed greenery.  The waiter was friendly and extremely helpful, making suggestions that turned out to be SOOOOO on the money!

2007-06-17,4.0,"Very accomodating for large groups. We sat 19 people on a Monday night very comfortably. The service was wonderful, the food was great with large portions, and the design was very polished. The restaurant wraps around an interior garden, which is very pretty, although it is not accessible to patrons. It is very private and off the busy streets of Chicago. The menu was of a good variety. They also have a seperate Tapas menu. This is an italian american place with delicious pairings of food. I modified the shrimp and angel hair pasta dish to calamari instead and they were very accomodating. The baked goat  cheese dish from the tapas menu was to DIE for and I strongly suggest it as a side. The server explained that the chef owns three restaurants in the city and he is very well-known. I would go back in a second for a special occasion or casual date with an up-scale feel.",0.9681,0.813,0.16,0.027,0.4882305194805195

2006-07-31,5.0,"I had my birthday party here Friday.  Well, I honestly wanted to just stay home, low key, cook nice dinner with close friends.  I think it's been least 3 years since I had anything going on for my birthday, something I just got use to by now.  I sort of hated my birthday because it was in middle of summer when there was no school.  I recall being in kindergarten through elementary that I never got any ice cream for my birthday at school.  It makes me sad thinking about it, I was crushed, I always got invited to my friends birthday parties and I always went, this was during school session.  But for my birthday, most of kids weren't around when my birthday was going on because it was summer time.    As I get older, I think of it as just another day, getting one year older, no big deal, no need for gifts or party.  Nope, it wasn't going to cut it, my roommate and Maryanna wasn't going to be okay with that.     This was nice spontaneous party, nothing planned, my roommate and I were going to eat dinner at Gibsons or Hugos, but we couldn't get reservation for several hours.  We ended up meeting Maryanna and her friend at Ra sushi, after many drinks, all of us went over to Grotto. I have been here few times for drinks during happy hour but not later in the evening.  I like the spacey area, quick service, and broad arrange of music.   Waitress and bartender did an awesome job, very quick in service, and attentive at exactly what we needed.  I think everyone had drinks at all times with no problems. We ordered bottle service to sit in comfy leather couches; TV on the corner had sex and the city playing.  Girls loved it.  I had enough to drink way before we got here so I did slow down but more people showed up to drink it up.   oh yeah, food!  it was super good.  Pizza with fresh tomato, yummy, and can't believe how good guacamole tasted.  I'm not big fan of it but it was really good, it was popular amongst our guest.  I will definitely bring more business to this place, thanks to Grotto for great evening.  I don't remember much after this; I believe we went to another bar after this place closed.  It was good times, had lot of fun this weekend.  I didn't have to pay for anything, felt like a King for a day. only happens once a year.  I'm curious to know how much all this cost?
