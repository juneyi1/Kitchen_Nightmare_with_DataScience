Chicago World Sports hosted a ""thank you"" party here in Fall of 2007 for their staff and volunteers (me included) following the very successful AIBA World Championship Boxing meet held at the U of I campus. Upstairs, it was essentially an indoor amusement park (just games, no real rides) for the sports minded of any age, with lots of snack foods that would appeal to such a crowd. They had a cozy media lounge with comfy chairs and sofas to watch the games or a special presentation in too. The very last event here was a viewing party for game five of the 2010 Stanley Cup championships, in which the Chicago Blackhawks were victorious over the Philadelphia Fliers.",0.9725,0.813,0.173,0.014,0.42557823129251704

2010-03-11,2.0,"I was here back in 2004 and had probably the weirdest experience of my life.   I'm from NC and was not used to the cold and it was between Christmas and New Years.  I had a bit of a cold, but didn't think anything of it.  My family was visiting for the weekend and we had been out walking around and decided to step in and go here because my little bro was 11 and he LOVES sports.  The wait was ridiculous and it was one of those places where you had to leave your ID to get a buzzer.   So we were waiting around for a good 45 minutes and it was vacation so my mom ordered an amaretto sour during the wait.  I was only 20 at the time but my mom slipped me a couple sips.  The drink was fine, just a basic drink.  After standing around for almost an hour I started to feel lightheaded and all of the sudden I just fainted!  Only time in my life I've ever fainted, so quite a shock.  The reason I'm putting this in here was because I fainted at the hostess stand. Not one of them flinched.  When my mom asked for a chair, the hostess looked super confused.  A patron actually got up and gave me his chair since the employees did nothing. We ended up eating there mostly because I didn't want to walk around after fainting. The food was fine and the prices ok also.  The sports aspect is cool too.  But, I don't think I could ever go back after such a weird reaction from their staff.  I know it's not their fault I fainted, but they could have been nice and given me a chair!",0.9642,0.838,0.108,0.055,0.5790088383838383

2010-02-22,2.0,"Its funny how city centers have become major tourist destinations over the years. I remember a Times Square that was more Fremont Street than Epcot Center. ESPN Zone in the loop is one of those sorts of places - a tourist trap in the middle of a real city, a place of reassuringly bland sameness when frazzled nerves overwhelmed by soaring architecture, maseratis jostling with buses, and the animated throngs of mag mile can escape to the comforting homogeneity so prevalent in Americas suburbs. Its a brand extension of the real-estate boom years. A grand tribute to suburban culture. As such, the overpriced food here lacks any quality to justify the price. The burgers taste cheaper than the 1 dollar special burgers you can get at your neighborhood bar on a monday. The buffalo chicken is identical to whats found in your freezer aisle, and the salads can be had for far less at Panera. I paid $5.75 for an Great Lakes Elliot Ness - 12oz. So I guess I can't have a tasty beer for a reasonable price, either.  No, ESPN zone isn't for Chicagoans. It might be for Napervillians (can I say that?) possibly Schaumburgers, more like you Rockfordillians... but really it's for those from even farther afield.

What would have happened if we didn't meet our quota? Forced to wash dishes? Forcibly Removed? Arrested? I'm not sure.  The waitress was rude and when someone in our group asked for coffee, she said ""do you want me to check, we might have some old coffee in the back"". That is the wong thing to say.

2010-01-27,2.0,"ESPN Zone is somewhere between ""blah"" and ""alright"". I think the experience one receives there just depends on why you're going in the first place.

It has a couple tiny bars and TV's are plastered around in a chaotic manner. The food is okay but pretty limited in selection. EZ is really more of direct comparison to Dave and Buster's or Gameworks. Unfortunately, its not a good as either place.

2010-01-11,1.0,"Fail Fail Fail. We wanted to watch the Rose Bowl here after our meal at Portillo's. They had a lot of screens, so we were thinking lots of screens must equal lots of space. This is logical thinking. This logical thinking ended up being not logical and in fact, plain wrong. We really should have found another bar, but we were not thinking clearly. As it is, ESPN zone is a restaurant-it is not a bar. Oh yes, there are two bar areas. But they are the smallest bar areas ever, especially if you are just trying to catch the game. Really, they are for people who are waiting for a table, which we were. We ended up getting seats at the bar, but then gave them up when a table was ready for our party. Big mistake. We got to the table and then were told that we had to spend $10 per person, per hour if we weren't ordering meals and just wanted to drink. That said, we were really just there to drink and watch some football. However, because we had just waited and hour and 45 minutes for this table, we didn't really want to leave just to go somewhere else and stand. So a couple of us ordered meals but we all ordered beer, is how I think it happened. I'm not sure. At this point, I personally was kind of upset. Also, our waitress was very rude to us, to the point where everyone commented about how much she hated us. I'm not really sure it's good for business when you have a whole table of people that know that the waitress doesn't care. Also, there was a mishap with my side salad, as two of us ordered one and the servers gave it to the wrong person at the table, as they ordered a salad with their burger. However, when I pointed this out to the waitress, she made it seem as if it were my fault that I didn't get my side salad, as in, I felt bad having to continuously ask about it, as she gave me dirty looks every time. This was an obvious mistake on how they run things; she didn't actually serve the salad and how are the servers to know who the side salad actually goes to? I can say that I did enjoy my boneless buffalo wings and side salad, and those who did order food, did enjoy it. I will say that this place is more family focused and restaurant driven than the actual sports aspect of it. Which is sad, because I do love sports and I do love to spend money on watching sports while out. I guess I will know next time.

2010-01-04,1.0,"The only good thing about this ESPN Zone is the gigantic TV upstairs on which to watch games. The fun stops there. The staff is rude, the place is overcrowded, and it's not all that clean. I guess I shouldn't be surprised. They have people by the balls. If you want to watch the big game on the big TV, you go there. So why would they be nice? They have something you want, so they can be as rude as they want and not care.  1. The upstairs area is very small, and obviously crowded during games, so be prepared to wait. The staff is VERY rude. We dealt with a host named Arif who was so rude to me. I also witnessed him harassing a guy who was seated (by the hostess) by himself. Arif demanded to know when the rest of the party would arrive, and literally pounded a card on the table that said everyone had to pay $10 an hour per person during bowl games, and that he would have to pay $30 every hour until the rest of his party came! All the guy did was tell him they were on their way, and Arif called the managers over to give the guy a hard time, too. It was absurd. If they have a policy against seating single people, they need to not seat incomplete parties. 2. The management doesn't care about customers. I complained to a manager about how rude Arif was and he blew me off. He said the customer I was referring to got ""aggressive"" (no he didn't). He also never apologized to me for how rude Arif was to me. I intend to file a written complaint, not that they care.  3. Why do they let children in this room? There is a perfectly fine restaurant downstairs. The upstairs area should be for adults only. Especially if they enforce this rule about an hourly minimum. And honestly, there is nothing more annoying than listening to kids whine, cry, scream in an area that is supposed to be a bar.  4. The food is overpriced and not very good. I had chicken and it was so dry. The spinach dip has to be cut with a knife, thanks to the brick of cheese they cover it with. The only thing decent was the wings. At least the drinks were strong, which made me feel a tiny bit better about paying 7.50 for a well vodka and Sprite.  5.

Last week a friend of mine and I decided to stop here for a late dinner after watching the Zombieland free screening. It was pretty late and we got there around quarter to 10 but they were still serving food until 11pm. I have heard a lot about the ESPN zone from other sports minded friends and they felt it was a great place to see games so we decided to give it a try. First off after going upstairs to the open dining area we were ignored by the hostess in fact they did not notice us until after I had to go up to one of them and ask them if we needed to be seated, we were the only ones who were waiting. We where finally seated in a upper corner booth. After we ordered some hamburgers two of the bus boys decided to hang out over out booth and watch the games and comment on who they were betting on very loudly while we were trying to have a conversation. Finally one of the managers came along and hung out with them and started talking to them about their tips, I mean they were literally leaning on our booth all three of them. So I had enough and leaned back and asked them if they minded. Well the manager started laughing and actually thought I was one of the busboys and replied to me that I had to wait for my cut!! After I asked him again if he minded they finally got the hint and noticed I was a customer and not a bus boy and so they left.  The hamburgers were actually really good but I have to admit the noise of the giant TV board combined with the noise of the TV at our table pretty much overwhelmed us and it was very hard to have a conversation. Now I understand its a sports bar of ultimate proportions but its was still hard to talk about anything. I wanted to like this place but after that night I am not so sure I will try it again.

2009-06-09,2.0,"ESPN Zone = Fail.  Sure, the games are fun, but the food and staff are not so hot. Went here with the bf tonight to watch the Red Wings game.  They are the least accommodating restaurant I've ever been to. I called ahead and asked if they take reservations since it says so on here, and I was informed that they do not, and not in a nice way either.  I find my boyfriend when I get there, and we're seated with a bunch of other Wings fans in a somewhat separate, glass enclosed room off to the side upstairs. Each of the tv's are positioned so annoyingly that you're either craning your head or far away from the tv so you have trouble seeing. A few of the tv's were scheduled to show the basketball game (which didn't even start till 45 minutes after the hockey game), and so we asked if the one closest to us could be changed to the Wings game so I could stop craning my neck. Our waitress said she wasn't sure, but she'd ask someone. They said no, so she came back to report that and said she'd ask the manager. The manager also said no, despite the fact that absolutely NO ONE in this enclosed area was going to watch the basketball game. By the time the hockey game started, there were literally 2 tables left in the entire area, and everyone in there was watching the Wings game. But they STILL refused to change the channel from the basketball game. It showed complete lack of customer appreciation, especially since the couple behind us, who were there celebrating their 30th anniversary and had paid big bucks to have it say so up on the scrolling wall, had asked them to change it as well.   Finally the food. My boyfriend ordered a salad (which he paid extra for) and bbq chicken. His salad came at the same time as his main course, which was really stupid. If you give people their salads at the same time as their main courses, they're not going to eat the salad, or if they do, they aren't going to finish it. I ordered a plate of fries that were overcooked, but such is life. Oddly, his bbq chicken dish was a plate of fries with 4 small pieces of grilled and bbq chicken on top of them. The food was pretty mediocre, and the cucumbers in his salad were cut into strange crescent shapes so they looked like someone had taken a bite out of them.  After our meal we noticed the sign that said ""Due to the excitement and great interest in today's game there is a $10 food and beverage minimum, per person, per hour."" So, what, if I want to stay for the entire game I have to order $30 worth of food and drinks? No thank you. We were out of there at that point. I was completely unwilling to pay $60 for shite food and mediocre service just so we could finish watching the game. Who needs that much food anyway? We don't plan to go back.

So they just don't play it at all. WTF kind of ""sports"" bar won't play a pro basketball playoff game because they don't want the game to go into overtime? And WTF kind of ""sports"" bar would close in the middle of an overtime playoff game? Again, for Chicago being this supposed sports town, that shit is all truly bizarre.

2008-10-26,3.0,"To paraphrase the immortal words of Chris Rock from ""No Sex (In The Champagne Room)"", just as ""no one goes to Hooters for wings,"" no one goes to ESPN Zone for food.  For me to review this as a restaurant would be a bit unfair.  No, this place should be reviewed for what it is - a somewhat family friendly orgy of an audio-visual overload of all things sports. For the average patron of ESPN Zone on a Sunday, sports are not a disraction, they are a way of life.  These are the kind of people who will punch you in the face for calling any sport just a pastime.  Football to them is a heroin that they withdraw from for the eight months that it isn't played.  And the only way to truly get their fix is to watch the game on what might be the largest television in Chicago (with smaller TVs and an endless fact ticker on every sport in the United States surrounding it like some puritanical Las Vegas sports book where gambling isn't allowed). The food is an afterthought.  And the wait staff, knowing this, doesn't bother to serve (aka interrupt the game) or move people out in the same way that you don't ask the crack head blocking the stairs to the El to kindly move out of the way.  It doesn't end well. This laissez faire movement of customers creates waits so huge that I was almost afraid to try to eat here between movies at the Chicago International Film Festival. I tried to eat here last Sunday but the place was so loaded by Viking fans (as well as the usual Bears contingent) that I gave up trying to get seated after 90 minutes. Since it was the Bears bye week this time around, I actually got in right away and the nachos that I ordered arrived in a few mintues.  They arrived with chicken but to be fair I said, ""no chicken"" instead of just saying ""nachos"" and all the waitress could hear in the booming of the giant television set's audio was ""chicken.""  They corrected this mistake right away. Oh and there's an arcade to burn calories at with all sorts of sports themed games. And still more televisions showing still more sports. The amount of testaterone (and noise) in this place can be a bit overwhelming (for those of us less into sports).  While it might be that the nachos were so loaded with fake cheese gave me lower belches after eating here, I think it might be a symptom of sports testaterone overdose.",-0.9009,0.871,0.051,0.078,0.6025729646697389

Well its a tourist trap and food is expensive. The menu is also really funny - they pad out the menu by including variations of the same thing as seperate items. So, out of 8 or so salads, 3 were Caesar salads - Plain, Chicken, Shrimp. Plus about half of their entrees were variations on pasta. Overall, the menu is pretty lame. We split some nachos which were drenched in Velveeta melted cheese. I guess that was allright, becasue I don't eat Velveeta much anymore, but whatever.",0.9804,0.816,0.147,0.037,0.570578231292517

It's almost as if their powerful image, fancy building and expensive menu items have somehow convinced me that the food is exceptional as well. Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad by any means but considering the prices I think it could stand to be better. I've eaten at ESPN Zone about 6 times over the past year and have always been satisfied with the service.   The last 2 meals I ordered at ESPN Zone were the Avocado Wrap (under the sandwiches category I believe) and the Peppersteak sandwich. Both sounded delicious in the descriptions but didn't quite live up to my expectations. Our waitress was happy to return the Peppersteak sandwich for me in exchange for some cheese fries at no extra cost. Also, avoid the buffalo wings if you don't like hot foods. They were a tad too hot for my liking and I generally don't mind hot/spicey foods. I believe you can have them use a different sauce though.  The ""Death By Brownie"" dessert is amazing and I will be returning to indulge myself in the future. It can easily be shared by 2 people. It should be noted also that ESPN Zone is not what I'd consider affordable.
