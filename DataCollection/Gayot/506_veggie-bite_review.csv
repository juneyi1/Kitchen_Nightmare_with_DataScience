Well, that and the fact that we moved about 70 minutes away from this location a few months prior to the closing. But that said, I would gladly venture to the Wicker Park location for the amazingness that is all things Veggie Bite. Now, my husband is an omni, but even he cannot deny a deep-seated love for VB. Their shakes hooked him, and then the food? Sold him completely. LOVE their nuggets (but I suggest passing on the tofu sticks unless you like a lot of tofu with not a ton of breading--which neither of us do) but the cheese fries, gyros, you name it--awesome, It was totally a ""Mickey's Gyros"" kinda joint for the vegetarian soul.

2009-07-27,4.0,"I've been to Veggie Bite now on several different occasions and I have to say the food is delicious. It's good to have some vegetarian and vegan fast food options that remind you of a good old burger joint. I have visited both locations, before the south resturant was closed.  I have had the veggie gyros, b b q and tofu nuggets.  Yummy!!!  The place is fairly priced for what you could expect to pay for a typical vegetarian meal. However I do think the service is a little lacking and not a very big drink selection [ always out of cola :(  ]and they don't bring the food to you. which is the only reason that keeps me from giving this place a 5 star rating.

2009-04-08,4.0,"For the record, Mt. Greenwood is NOT a suburb, it's a neighborhood of the city. The location was perfect for me, and the food was okay. It was nice to have a vegetarian option close by, but I'm not vegan so I couldn't appreciate the fake cheese sauce the way vegans could.  I also found the textures of some of their items to be odd.

They certainly didn't ever put much effort into the place. And the service was always mind-bogglingly slow, and lackadaisical...no wonder they went under.",0.1298,0.866,0.07,0.064,0.4869047619047619
2009-01-10,4.0,"Well I have to say I am so sad to read that it is temporarily closed. But, at first I heard it actually closed.  When I realized there was a fully vegan fast food restaurant only a few minutes from my southside residents I seriously thought I was dreaming. Southside and vegan is not really words you would hear next to each other. My mom and I decided to try it out and see what it was all about. I ended up getting a Chili Cheese Dog and fries. My mom got a salad with chikn pieces. The chili is a 'meaty' very hearty mix it was sweet and had a great tang to it. I was also excited for the bun. It has been a LONG time since I have had a good vegan hot dog bun. This tasted similar to Fudrducker's bun (if you remember that place). Very buttery and toasty, it was perfect. My mom enjoyed her salad and it truly filled her up.  I have gone back a few other times. Once to get the chili cheese fries. Oh my god, these are a meal on their own. They are so hearty, you have to eat them with a fork. The cheese sauce is so delicious. Probably not the best thing for you, but it is just like the cheese sauce omni's have. I also got the Philly Cheese Steak. It was really good, but oh my god it was so much seitan. Though, the seitan was perfectly seasoned. I took out half of the seitan and took it home with me for a later meal. Again the bread was delicious. I hope they re-open with more than ice cream!

2008-11-06,5.0,"Monday was an off day for VeggieBite. When I walked in the guy on the register was new, he didn't know how to work the credit card machine and they were out of buffalo wings (which I was salivating over after seeing them on the website). So on my first day I got a Philly Cheesesteak and a regular salad. Even though I spent an entire year living in Philadelphia, at this point I can't remember what a real Philly Cheesesteak tastes like. What I can tell you is that this one was amazing! Veggiebite uses its own homemade cheese sauce and a perfectly seasoned seitan beef, sliced thinly and oh so yummy.

2008-09-05,4.0,"I almost sh!t a brick when I heard there was a vegan restaurant on the south side, so for the sheer awesomeness of this strange, bewildering gem of truth alone I give it four stars.  I would give it five, but firstly, there wasn't ENOUGH propaganda. Hello, aren't meat-eaters supposed to feel just a tad bit guilty? After a delicious vegan meal it'd be cool if our omnivore friends could pick up some information about the benefits of being veggie or the environmental, ethical, and bodily devastation eating meat causes. Then again, something like that would have to be donated by some sort of organization, so that doesn't really fall under Veggie Bite's purview. It'd be nice, though. :) Secondly, the employees were not very helpful. I asked the guy behind the counter what he'd suggest to my two first-time-vegan-eating companions and he shrugged apathetically. He could'e been shy or new though, and having worked food service in college, I know all too well that sometimes there are moments when you just can't take another flipping customer pestering you.  Thirdly, I felt kind of disappointed in what I ordered but was blown away by my friends' food. One had the chili dog and the other ate a Philly, and both were pretty amazing. My buffalo on rye tasted a kind of bland, as did the tofu bites. I've heard great things about the buffalo bites and shakes though, and will be back.  Even if this place sucked I'd be back just to lend support to the type of food I'd like to see more of in the area. It's such a bonus that it's clean, affordable, pretty fast, and boasts a huge menu of vegan treats.",0.9955,0.694,0.229,0.076,0.569891774891775
2008-08-28,4.0,"One carnivore's confession.  The only thing better than meat is food that tastes like meat that won't slowly kill me.  If I can string together enough vegan encounters, the vegetable gods could probably convert me and steal me away from food-with-parents. Daddy liked Veggie Bites. I ate something that was a faux fried chicken sam'mich w/ tomato, lettuce, etc. I can't remember because I ate it so fast.  So good. I heard about the chili cheese fries AFTER I inhaled my lunch from a veggie friend. That will be my next move, no doubt.. Fast food veggie. Yes! The only thing missing is a drive-thru window and a kiddie toy deal w/ a crappy Disney movie. Maybe I could cruise up to a talking carrot (or Carrot Top, Is he business?) and place an order from the driver's seat. I wanna order chili fries from a talking carrot.  Stop fucking around and get on that, Veggie Bite.",0.8746,0.778,0.141,0.081,0.5928571428571427
2008-08-06,4.0,I love their Supreme Wrap and french fries.  I don't know if the food is all that healthy because the fries soak through the bag and you can taste the salt.  But it's a change of pace and I live on the southside (GO SOX!!) so it's not a chore to get there.,0.9018,0.802,0.198,0.0,0.4
2008-05-16,3.0,"Veggie Bite (the one on the south side, 3031 W 111th St.) is like a petulant teenager - sometimes you want to smack it but mostly you want to see it blossom. They're trying to straddle an interesting gulch betwixt fast food and healthy vegan cuisine, and they're doing a decent job. I'm an on-again-off-again vegetarian/vegan, and Veggie Bite fills an interesting niche for me. It's not particularly close to my Chicago Lawn house, but it's by far the closest, tastiest, quickest vegan food available. The menu caters too much toward the fast food end of the spectrum and could do well to expand to other dishes. Nearly every sandwich-like item on the menu comes with the same sauce on it, so the difference between, say, the ""Bite Double Burger"" and the ""Buffalo on Rye"" is mostly in presentation - they taste nearly identical. Ditto for the ""Gyro"" or ""Philly Cheese Steak"". Pick whichever one's cheapest and you'll get the idea. Don't get put off by the sammiches, though, there are diamonds among the menu's coal. The buffalo wings are delicious and the last shake I had there - peach cobbler - was incredible. The counter help is very friendly but sometimes seem like space cadets as they babble on while gathering everything for my order. There have also been non-trivial fuckups when trying to order via the website - don't bother. Just call and place your order. Make sure you're calling the right one, the south side location's phone number is STILL white text on a  yellow background. They do a fine job making vegan fast food, but like most fast food, it just doesn't taste as good as real food. I'd like to see them drop half the burger-esque mains from their menu and add new dishes. They've painted themselves into a difficult corner at the intersection of vegan & fast food, but they do well in that admittedly limited capacity. It's great that there's now tasty, take-out fast food that vegans and carnivores alike can both enjoy on the South Side, and I recommend you give it a shot. It's no Chicago Diner, but it's a far cry from McDonald's.",0.9933,0.781,0.169,0.05,0.49888347763347773
2008-02-28,3.0,"A unique find down on the South Side, where vegetarian food can be sort of hard to come by. The owners and workers are friendly and the restaurant itself is cute; small, but it feels airy and open anyway. As a vegetarian or vegan, it's awesome to be able to order anything on the menu (including all that fast food you used to eat)! So that's cool.  The main problem I've had here is that the actual food you get doesn't seem to match the menu descriptions. For example, I've ordered the gyros a couple of times. What I got was tasty, but it wasn't very gyros-like. The meat substitute wasn't the problem; that had a good texture. It was the toppings (flavor and preparation) that seemed off.  They were sort of taco-like, I guess. Similarly, when I've ordered a buffalo ""chicken"" sandwich, it's been really good but the sauce doesn't seem to have a buffalo flavor. It's more like a barbeque chicken sandwich! So I don't know-- stuff here mostly tastes good, but seems to be mislabeled or something. Just don't go in expecting an exact replica of the fast food you're missing, and you probably won't be disappointed. Last note: their ""chicken nugget"" things are awesome.

Much like New York, New York...if you can make it there you can make it anywhere. Veggie Bite has a pretty standard selection of things you would associate with fast food. Burgers, Hot Dogs, Chili Cheese Fries... but everything is vegan. In addition to the typical fare, they mix it up a little... Italian Beef Sandwich, Meatball Sub, Buffalo on Rye. These ensure you won't be pigeon holed into the burger and fries meal, unless that's what you want. My favorite sandwich is the Italian beef, it is piled high with tasty seasoned strips of veggie beef and is as tasty as it is messy. I have always found the food to be good. It is vegan, but it sure doesn't feel like health food. It pretty closely authenticates the fast food experience. Sometimes it's nice to go into a place and just pig out, Veggie Bite allows that and then some. While we are on that subject, they have cakes and a soft serve soy ice cream machine as well. My only complaints with Veggie Bite is that sometimes you get the fast food taste, but certainly not fast. At times we roll down there with a crew, and it can take awhile to get the food. Also, I have ordered a few milkshakes there and found them to be a bit thin and bland. Hopefully that was just an isolated incident.  There is talk of a Veggie Bite North opening up soon on Clark and Diversey. I certainly hope it does, if it does they are going to need to hire a full kitchen staff, because this place is going to get really busy and waiting too long for fast food can drive people away.
