2011-05-06,4.0,"While spending a weekend in Chicago we went here based on a recommendation from a friend who lives nearby. Atmosphere was nice, dim, friendly, pretty relaxed. There was a nice aroma of a wood fire burning (we were told this was from the oysters app) - a welcome smell on a fairly cold night. We had foie gras and strawberry preserves with brioche for an app - incredibly rich and really, really tasty. Highly recommended. For dinner I had the fried chicken thighs with dirty rice. I'd give this dish more of a three - good but nothing to write home about. My girlfriend had the grilled ribeye with mushroom ketchup and blue cheese butter. I was pretty pissed I didn't order this myself because it was unbelievable. The steak was perfectly cooked & marbled. the blue cheese butter added a nice kick. A full blown 5. The wine list was decent and reasonably priced relative to similar restaurants. Unfortunately the malbec we ordered was forgettable which is why the name escapes me. Service was a solid 4.

2011-05-06,4.0,"My husband and I went to Kith & Kin for dinner a few weeks ago - I had no expectations as I didn't read about the restaurant at all before going - we both were really pleasantly surprised.  The menu changes seasonally and I'm looking forward to going back for summer options everything we tried was very good, but of course, we had favorites. We ordered what we wanted from the menu and our server indicated that the kitchen paces the meal, which is great with us.  However, we started with a crawfish salad and smoked oysters - neither one of us liked the combination of hot and cold plates at one time, but we liked both of them.  The crawfish was really fresh tasting and bright, you could taste everything in it, and I thought the oysters were killer.  It's hard to go wrong with those. Then we had fried catfish and the house-made pickles - my absolute favorite part of the meal.  The fish was light, flaky, really flavorful and the pickles were so. good.  I love pickles but they have to be really crunchy, slightly spicy, good vinegar flavor and be extremely fresh - these were all that.  So good.  I would go back just for the pickles. For a main plate (which I could've done without after what we had eaten leading up to it), I had rabbit stew and my husband had the grouper with scallop ragout - his plate won hands down.  The flavor was really good.  The stew was way too rich for me after what I had ordered for starters - my eyes were too big for my stomach. And we had to try dessert - I had the peanut butter pie and OMG - it's hard to mess up peanut butter, chocolate sauce and a pretzel crust - but it was even better than what I was expecting.  That could've been way too sweet and heavy but the saltiness of the crust and peanut butter was right on and the peanut butter was very light - unbelievable.  Most desserts aren't worth the calories, in my opinion, but this one definitely was - The one downside for me was the smokiness in the room.  We had to ask if the hood was not working - and I saw one of the bus boys holding open the front door for a period of time to get air moving - we were told it was due to the smoky oysters.  Ok.  I mean, it didn't ruin anything but my clothes were definitely smelly, which I hate after eating, and if you're going to serve a dish with smoke, figure out how to move air through the front of the house more efficiently.",0.9974,0.753,0.192,0.055,0.5582007767646064

My husband and I were able to get a table immediately when we walked in, which was nice, but it took another 15 minutes to get our drinks.  My husband ordered a very standard Bacardi and Coke, only to find that they didn't have Bacardi, and in fact only had one rum on hand.  We attempted to order an appetizer while we waited for our drinks, only to be told that the waitress refused to put in an app order -- we were required to make our complete order at one time so that the chef could ""stage"" the meal.  This was said by our waitress Sarah with a smile, but....it was also said while she tried to explain that the restaurant was moving to a ""southern food"" focus.  Hmm.  It's missing the southern hospitality I guess.  Definitely a disconnect between the service and the food. The food this time was ok, although they are stern about not altering any dishes, even for allergies.  I ordered the chicken thighs, which were beautifully cooked, but my husband's shrimp was a little difficult to manage (served in the shell, which is was seared to), and the grits were undercooked.  We also had the honey butter and biscuits, but the biscuits were like hockey pucks.  Poutine is off the menu (boo!!) so we had the crawfish salad instead, which was great. Overall, I was disappointed -- probably because the first time I ate there the food was amazing, so this paled in comparison.  Bad move letting the old chef go!!!",0.9693,0.826,0.117,0.057,0.510440340909091

The reason for the 3 stars is b/c of the food.  We split the tiger shrimp and wagyu steak.  The waitress warned us the shrimp came with the head and tail on. Peeling shrimp is not my favorite thing to do but I figured I could deal.  Well, the shrimp is blackened and it is difficult to peel them without making a royal mess.  If I were at Joe's Crab Shack, no problem but I wasn't and it just didn't fit with the experience I wanted there. Also, the shrimp were a bit dry.  However, the grits served with them were fantastic. I've never eaten wagyu steak before and it is prepared medium rare which is just the way I like steak.  However, ours was rare...very rare.  My bf didn't mind but the waitress took my portion back to be cooked more.

They greeted me by my twitter handle when I arrived, which was super cute, and then proceeded to seat me at ultra cozy two-top while I waited for my guest to arrive.  Also per my tweets, they knew I was excited to ""try everything"" - so the general manager, a very-friendly Robert Diaz, came to my table and offered to put together a custom tasting menu, paired with hard-to-find beers and wines. I accepted.  The entire smorgasbord was amazing. Here's a run down: Started with chicken liver pate and duck rillette ... and couldn't stop. We literally left both on the table and noshed the entire night. Next was the celery root soup and the tomato soup. Celery root was addicting and got tastier by the spoonful.

Sizzling hot and amazing. Then, we moved on to our 4 entrees: -Blackened Tiger Shrimp. These prawns were the size of baby arms and super succulent. -The Seared Scallops were done perfectly and in a nice buttery sauce. They were my favorite things of the night. I would recommend this dish as anyone's single entree. -The Housemade Tagliatelle had just the right amount of spice and super fresh tasting. - Dinner wrapped with Buttermilk Fried Chicken Thighs, collard greens, and mashed potatoes with homemade biscuits. Even though I ate with my fingers during this dish, this was far from a #6 combo meal at Popeyes, let me tell you. We finished this glutton-fest with two desserts: chilled peanut butter pie and a warm Brioche Sticky Bun.  Twenty pounds later, I'm a huge fan of this place.

Salad with beer battered fried pickles was so nice when eaten in the same bite with the greens and buttermilk dressing.  Crawfish Agnolotti was a burst of flavor, very zesty, really woke up your pallet. Fried chicken thighs had to be the best friend chicken I every had and were nicely complimented with their gravy, and flavors were balanced and all tied together with the greens that accompanied.  For dessert I had the peanut butter pie with pretzel crust and chocolate sauce - phenomenal, so lite and the pretzel added that nice salty component to complement the sweet. My gf had the cinnamon sticky bun - it was good, but overshadowed by the pie!   To make the evening even better, the service was beyond excellent - so friendly and approachable, so attentive, but yet not so attentive that they were annoying or in the way.  Service was timed perfectly - courses came out in the perfect amount of time.  All staff was very knowledgeable about all menu items and also helped us pick out a delicious yet affordable glass of sparkling wine to start the evening.  Our server really made us feel comfortable and at home.... The atmosphere was casual but still nice.  Loved the music in the background and the overall feel of the place was welcoming and up. I hate going to restaurants that are stuffy and so conservative that you feel like you can't be yourself and relax while you eat.  Kith and kin was neither... I will definitely go back with more friends and family/kith and kin.... As I stated earlier a nice addition to the neighborhood. Great food, great service, great atmosphere.

2011-01-10,4.0,"I made my first visit to Kith and Kin last night after seeing a matinee of ""Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolf"" at Steppenwolf.  We arrived just before seven and there were only two other parties in the restaurant, one of which included a screaming child.  Despite the child, the decor and lighting were soothing, but I was a little worried that so few people were there at this ""Bib Gourmand"" listed place.  It turns out that in Chicago the cool people don't come to dinner until 8, even on Sunday night.  Sometimes even parties of 20 that include children arrive at 8:30 or 9 p.m.  Very continential. Kith and Kin is large enough to absorb many different kinds of activity.  We were sitting in a section of the place that was separated by a partial wall from the bar, and perhaps that is why the children all seemed to be sitting near us.  It was a cold winter night and the restaurant was comfortably warm.  We hung our coats on pegs near our table. In terms of food, we were presented with good quality ingredients thoughtfully prepared.  The overall theme of the food is southern, with an occasional cajun/New Orleans element.  We were dining with a guest from England, and he wanted to try the tasting menu, because so many things on the menu looked good.  However, even though the waiter described the tasting menu to us, we didn't quite understand that we would be getting more or less regular sized portions of things that were on the standard menu, one from each group: pates, salads, pastas, and meat entrees.   In other words, it wasn't like tasting menus as other places where you might get a couple of bites of ten or more dishes.   As I say, the waiter did describe this to us, so it's our own fault for not recognizing that this tasting menu was more like a prix fixe.  We did get good value for money.  But we had no choice in what we ate, except for dessert (which is limited to a choice of three things for all diners).   Our best dish by far was the crayfish agnoletti.   But two of our other dishes (chosen for us by the chef) had deep fried elements at the center.   We were given the deep fried pickle salad, and then the deep fried buttermilk chicken leg.  Both were good but too much breading and deep frying for one meal, southern or not!   If I could have chosen a different entree,for example the short ribs, the meal overall would have been satisying, and balanced. For those who are curious, we were told that the deep fried pickle is a classic southern snack.  It was served here with watercress, another green (curly endive?) and a buttermilk dipping sauce.  I liked it; it was certainly something different. I was surprised that Kith and Kin offers only 3 desserts, one of which is a cinnamon bun.  We tried that, thinking it would be transformed into something suitable to end a meal, but really it was just a tasty, large, breakfast bun.  We also tried the peanut butter pie, which looks like a slice of cheesecake and was fine, but not something I would have again.  French press coffee is served--no espresso available. Service was very good.  Alcoholic drink options could not be faulted. I'm planning to give Kith and Kin another try.",0.9933,0.854,0.112,0.035,0.4329110560800701

The duck rillette was great but the bread tasted stale.  The beet salad is perfection.  The mussels were great.  The crawfish ettouffe was good but is is really crawfish ravioli.  I did not read the menu close enough and did not expect a pasta dish which is what the crawfish turned out to be.  I think the initial shock confused me and the more I ate this dish the more I liked it.   The duck tagliatelle was very good and the portion was large.  Bone marrow is awsome but not for the less adventurous.  The wine selection by the glass is great as well.  I think the place is very good but our server made it great.  Thanks.",0.9925,0.721,0.218,0.062,0.5268163265306122
2010-12-28,3.0,"Our visit to Kith and Kin was on a Monday night and the restaurant was not particularly busy. It's a relatively quiet place with widely spaced tables and a full bar. There's even a fireplace you can sit in front of. The atmosphere is definitely relaxed but I think the food reflects this more relaxed approach and not always to its credit. Our waitress was friendly but not particularly helpful. I asked where the truffled gouda cheese in the risotto was from and her reply was ""I don't know"". When I asked if the peanut butter pie had cream cheese in it, her response was ""I don't think so."" I pushed this and requested she ask the chef, which she did. And the peanut butter pie did not. Later, she explained that the chefs did not take kindly to any criticism of their desserts and it sounded like the kitchen wasn't that interested in customer feedback, which may have explained her reluctance to go back there and get our questions answered. The drink list was what seems to be kind of the standard list in town with a Sazarac, a moscow mule, an Aviation and a riff on the margarita as standards.  We tried the Sazarac which was fine, the aviation which has a distinctly purple hue from the Creme de violette and was sweeter than the one at Girl and the Goat, and we had the margarita like one which seemed a bit light to me.   We started the meal with oysters, the beet salad with creme fraiche and fried pickles. The first two were generous servings for the price. We got 6 oysters for $12. These oysters are deeply, deeply smoked over some kind of very flavorful wood and what you are really eating is this kind of slimy, gritty smoke. Not my favorite (I couldn't stand the grit) but the rest of hte group liked them. I will have to say, they make the whole table smell like the smoke from the wood chips.  The oysters were from the panhandle of Florida and maybe they are just a gritty version? The beets are roasted but really lacked the flavor I associate with fresh roasted beets. They weren't bad, they just weren't sweet and toasty. It's served with a very small dollop of creme fraiche and greens. The beets and greens and orange slices were enough for our party of four to each have a small serving. The greens were very fresh. The fried pickle was good but it seemed excessively expensive for what amounts to 1 1/2 dill pickles.  The batter is light and airy and the pickle flavor is emphasized (the batter has no competing flavors). It's served with some buttermilk dressing which was nice but non descript.   The mains we ordered included the short ribs, the blackened shrimp, the tagliatelle with rabbit, scallops with a tomato soup.  We also ordered a side of risotto with truffled gouda (which I would strongly discourage).  The short ribs were salty but it was a large serving of at least two large ribs. They were fatty.  The blackened shrimp is large halved prawns (whole) blackened and I mean blackened served on grits. This is a good combination. The grits are a nice balance against the spicy, salty shrimp. But this dish is work and requires prying out the shrimp. You get two whole shrimp in this dish. The tagliatelle was not very impressive. the tomato sauce did not seem to go well with the pasta, and I couldn't really taste the rabbit.  I expected something with a bit more savory flavor and a bit less tomato sauce flavor.  It was a fairly decent sized portion, however. The last dish, the scallops were a mixed bag.  The scallops themselves were perfectly cooked, which is an achievement, but the tomato soup within which they resided was not particularly noteworthy with no flavor highlights. The risotto was like a bowl of rice in broth with way too much salt.  Gouda cheese, truffled or not, was not evident. We pointed this out to the waitress and she said that was ""too bad"".  This was after she explained that she couldn't tell the chef how bad the pie crust was because he didn't take well to comments about the desserts. So, dessert was less than stellar. The chocolate mousse pie had the worst pie crust I've ever encountered in or out of a restaurant (I'd rather have had the boxed one from a grocery store pie).  YOu could pick up the crust and flight it around without any noticeable rip or tear. To say it wasn't flaky is a major understatement. To serve a crust like this is an embarassment to the restaurant, and totally flavored the experience in a negative way. The chocolate mousse was fine but after one bite of the crust we just scraped the mousse out of the shell (the waitress acknowledged that this was a common occurance--and if that is true and this was not a one time occurance, this is really unacceptable on the chef's part). The peanut butter pie was fine. It's a gelatin like pie (I described it as jello without the fruit) but it is peanut buttery to its credit and it resides on a pretzel crust which is much better than the chocolate pie crust.  The pretzel crust should replace the other. We were disappointed.",0.9956,0.837,0.113,0.05,0.5002565233120788

The cocktail list is also worth checking out. The beer list is small, but I am happy without a Miller or Bud.  Entrees were the tagllatelle and short ribs. Best short ribs EVER. Tagllatelle with braised rabbit ragout was good, though more tomatoey than one might have suspected from the description. We also ordered the risotto.  The short ribs and the risotto were deliciously salty, but perhaps overly so. I'm not watching my blood pressure, but the salt levels do raise eyebrows.  We went with dessert, splitting the French Silk pie. The pie - delicious. Crust made us wonder if it had been frozen. It wasn't cold, but certainly was tough - not sure it would have cut with a knife, had we tried.  French press coffee leaves you wondering why every restaurant does not do this.

The mushrooms were moist(wet, what other adjective can I use?) and not masked by any unwanted seasonings. All of their mini starters are like spreads, fyi. Now for the mussels. Virtually every table had the mussels and they looked awesome. Well, they also TASTED awesome.

One of this restaurant's specialties is their selection of chicken liver, pork rillettes and fois gras offerings.  I've had three and all are excellent.  The rabbit pasta was also a winner with long strands of pappardelle cooked perfectly al dente and tossed with a large amount of outstanding rabbit ragout.   I can't do a review of this place without mentioning the excellent beverage program.  From craft cocktails, to an excellent craft beer selection and one of the city's most well thought out wine programs, this is a winner.  The staff is also excellently trained on their list and pairings for individual dishes.  I highly recommend seeking out their guidance. Great restaurant and one of my new favorites.",0.9933,0.73,0.255,0.015,0.7373823051948052
2010-10-29,5.0,"I went to Kith and Kin last night with my boyfriend, and I must say it was a nearly perfect experience.  We were greeted and seated immediately per our reservation, and immediately loved our waitress.  She was able to give us the perfect amount of time to look over the menu, as well as suggest a great wine.  Also, all the wait staff wears aprons, which is really cool.  Another note is that they were definitely playing ""The Big Chill"" cd, as well as tons of other motown favorites.  Huge plus!   We ordered one of the specials for our appetizer/medium sized plate.  It was a shrimp ravioli in a lobster foam sauce...yum!  That foam was to die for.  I also should note that the timing of all the wine and food was perfect.  I never felt like I waited too long, or that the food came too quickly.  For our main courses, we ordered the tiger shrimp and grits, as well as as the fried chicken thighs.  Both were absolutely amazing!   The chicken (mine) was de-boned and perfectly juicy!  It was also well fried which means extra crispy and crunchy.  It was two thighs on top of collard greens which had been sauteed in a homemade hot sauce (I asked) which gave it just the perfect amount of kick.  Top it off with some country gravy and you have one delicious meal!  The shrimp and grits (his) were also amazing.  First of all, they were HUGE, and whatever spices they used to ""blacken"" them were so perfect.  The combination of the shrimp with the grits, which were topped with huge scallions, was just great.   We ended up passing on dessert because we had cleaned all three of these plates, but stayed for almost 30 minutes finishing our bottle of wine, doodling on the craft paper tablecloth, and jamming to the oldies.  We never got any pressure to leave, and as mentioned, everyone on staff was amazing.   We will definitely be back!",0.9934,0.805,0.181,0.015,0.6797979797979796

While the menu was similar the quality was not.  The liver pate wasn't mixed properly and was a gloppy mess.  To make up for that they gave us a free dish that someone at the table had already ordered wich just seemed rude.  Why not bring something different than what someone already at the table was paying for.  The chef clearly had a heavy salt hand.  The best meals were bland and average.   This place was great not just because of Chef Carrier's cooking but also because of the service and care he clearly displayed.  I remember one night when he came out to welcome a group of 6 of us to his restaurant and apologize for a wait that in our estimation was reasonable - we showed up without reservations on a Saturday night.  When we did get seated he told us what he was featuring on the menu.  When we left after a great meal he came up to us, thanked for our patronage, shook each of our hands and remembered all of our names from when he met us 2 hours earlier.  You don't see that often.  Too bad he is no longer there.  Too bad because I really liked this place as did my friends and I was looking forward to showing it off to my family.

My husband and I walked in on a Saturday night around 8 p.m. and were immediately seated, although it was fairly busy so this probably isn't always the case.  The waitress was really sweet and helpful with the menu, she had good suggestions each time we asked any questions, and the service was good and friendly, if a little slow. The food was good, not the best I've ever had, but definitely tasty and unique. For a fairly small menu, it was surprisingly varied and I feel there was an option for everyone. Both of our meals were a bit too salty, but they were still very good.  They did run out of what my husband originally ordered, and we sat at the table for almost fifteen minutes before they told us that, but once he chose something new, it arrived promptly. That's the reason i didn't give the restaurant a five.  But I did give it a four over a three because I really liked the atmosphere, and the employees were very nice and friendly.  It was a bit expensive, 95 dollars for two of us, and we didn't even have a bottle of wine or anything (although we did have the chocolate peanut butter pie, and it's soooo worth it!!!!) but was a good option for maybe a special date night or a birthday dinner.

One problem, I rarely travel north of North Avenue but I made an exception and I am glad I did.  I really need to venture out of the downtown/gold coast are more.  I didn't even know how to get there and I've lived in Chicago since 1995 and in Chicago-land my whole life.  I thought the restaurant was on a quaint, tree-lined street.  The decor of the restaurant suits the neighborhood nicely.  It is welcoming and warm.  The one thing I did notice was that there was little diversity among the diners, I found this odd as most places I eat tend to have a different walks of life.  I sat at the bar and waited for my friend (who was 45 minutes late).  While at the bar, I tried their Pisco Sour.  I am always on the hunt for a good cocktail that uses egg whites.   Finally, Traci arrived and we switched to wine.  We ordered.... I had the Foie Gras - creamy deliciousness, very, very rich!  We each had the Bib Lettuce Salad - two people can easily share this, it is very large Traci had the spiced pumpkin soup, I did not try it but she seemed pleased We split an entree, the seared Flank Steak - which is a favorite cut of both of ours and we thought this particular preparation was delicious.  We also tried the bone marrow dish and a bit of the shrimp and orzo (I think it was a special).  I wasn't crazy about the bone marrow but I've heard others rave about it, so don't take my word entirely.  The orzo, again, I am not a shrimp eater so it isn't right for me to say.

2010-10-04,3.0,"I have heard a lot of good things about Kith and Kin, including the thumb of approval from Grant Achatz (Chef Brochu worked at Alinea).  So, since I had a reason to be in the neighborhood, I decided to check it out.  Oh BTW, a little 4square tip.  For anyone who's wearing NY Giants gear, you get 10% off. The interior of the restaurant was nice, if a bit uninteresting.  We started with a bottle of the 2009 Villa Des Anges Rose.  Old vine cinsault from the Languedoc.  I know, I know, it was the 1st of October, and I was still hanging on to summer.  Anyhoo, for appetizers, we shared the Duroc Pork Creton, with Dijon Mustard and Pickled Pearl Onions, and Swan Creek Apple Salad, with Ewes Blue, Candied Hazelnuts, Celery, and Arugula.  The creton is a Quebecois pork spread, flavored very aggressively with cloves (apparently the traditional spice for this).  As I have never had creton before, the clove flavor was a pleasant surprise to the dish.  It was great with the crunchy toasted bread.  Our waitress even brought another ramekin of bread without our asking.  That was a nice touch, given at other places, you usually get 3 meager slices of bread with your charcuterie/potted meat plate.  The apple salad was good, but nothing spectacular.  The hazelnuts though gave a nice variation to traditional walnut.  Good choice. For mains, we had the Buttermilk Fried Chicken Thigh, Braised Collard Greens, and Sawmill Gravy, and Seared Grouper with Melted Leeks, Flavors of Gribiche, Poached Egg, and Dill.  The chicken was a little on the dry side, with a nicely spiced breading.  I loved that the greens and gravy were delicate and not oily.  It perhaps took away some of the guilt from eating this rich dish.  We had asked our waitress what 'flavors of gribiche' meant in the grouper dish.  Sauce gribiche is a French style mayonnaise sauce with chopped pickles and herbs.  Here, chef presented a deconstruction of the sauce, with all key ingredients arrayed beautifully on the plate, including a very nicely poached egg.  The grouper was seared amazingly, with a crispy exterior.  When I took a bite of the dish, I burst out into laughter.  The first thought that came to mind after that first bite was....(drum roll) Filet-O-Fish!  Interesting how food memory works.  But think about it, crispy fish with flavors of a sauce that is essentially what English speaking folks know as tartar sauce.  And a little secret about me.  Filet-o-fish was the first thing I ever ate at McDonald's.  Needless to say, when our waitress came to check on us, I told her about this and we all had another round of hearty laughter. Why 3 stars?  Great neighborhood place.  This is the perfect example of how humble comfort food can be elevated a few notches.  Thinking about my meal here, we basically had fried chicken and filet-o-fish.  But oh, what marvelous chicken and fish!  Also, i learned 2 new things in one night - creton and gribiche.  How cool is that?",0.9979,0.829,0.163,0.008,0.6528117715617713

We started with the egg and olive salad. It was basically egg salad, but we both love egg salad so that was great. Next we had the heirloom tomato salad. The tomatoes were fresh, but I was expecting a wider and fancier variety of tomatoes since it is called an ""heirloom"" salad. Everything tasted great though. The curds and whey dressing was delicious. We also split a crock of french onion soup. The waiter said it's the best in the city. I haven't had many french onion soups, but this one sure was great!! It had an amazing flavor and a super thick crust.  Up next was the poutine and the mussels. The mussels were very good, but the sausage and pepper broth was a bit spicy for my tastes. I'm a wuss about spice though. It was a very big portion, we shared them but it'd be a lot of mussels for one person if you ordered it for your dinner. The poutine french fries were awesome - that's one of my favorite things to eat, and the chicken gravy was different but really tasty.  Lastly we had the peanut butter pie with the pretzel crust. I had super high expectations for this dessert since it's basically everything I love. It was good, but not mind blowing or anything.  I really liked the vibe at Kith and Kin.

2010-08-23,3.0,"I've watched enough Top Chef to know that under salting your food can send you home. Kith and Kin however has taken this to another level. I walked out of there so bloated from the sodium, I'm surprised my pants still fit.  I'm still giving it 3 stars though because clearly it's a good restaurant and is very cool on the inside. The bar was very cool. BUT, my food was way too salty. We skipped the crocks because neither one of us were starving and we were more interested in getting a buzz. So straight to the entrees - I had the skate wing and the bf had the pork tenderloin. The pork was sou vide (sp?) something he had never had before, but thought would be good. It looked and tasted like a cut up hot dog that had been soaked in a salt bath. The (minimal) chorizo that came with it was good, but the pork was not to either of our liking. My skate wing was very good, but it was served sittiong on a layer of cartilage. I knew this when I ordered it, so no big deal, but the weird part was that they set the cartilage right on top of the puree that it was to be served with. So instead of having nice puree underneath your fish, you lost half the puree to the fish cartilage. It was so strange. I was scraping off the puree from the cartilage to try to eat it. I didn't understand it at all. And again, it was way too salty. We also ordered the onion rings, which were fine. Nothing amazing.  I want to go again, although my bf will not volunteer to come with me, and maybe try another dish. It's an interesting menu and I'm thinking it has promise, but lighten up on  salt!!",0.9882,0.781,0.168,0.051,0.590895238095238

It is surprisingly large inside and even has a private room in the back you can reserve for parties.  The service on a Sunday night was very prompt and friendly. We did make a reservation, although on a Sunday it likely was not necessary. They were out of several cocktails on their specialty drink list for some reason on the day we went. There was a pretty standard wine selection. The appetizer portions were good sized, and very good, I had the fresh pasta with seasonal squash and veggies which was very good. My husband had a fresh seafood dish and thought the portion was pretty large for the price. We passed on dessert because we were stuffed.

What caused the delay? The UNBELIEVABLE Friday night traffic from the 'burbs into the city (compounded by the craziness that is Chicago Critical Mass). Upside-- parking was not hard to find around 9pm. Traffic and parking aside, Hubby J and I had a fabulous time with two of our favorite kinspeople (J's cousin B and his wife). Since we missed our reservation, we waited about 30 minutes at the bar. Guest bartender Adam Seger was showing off mixes with his creation, Hum, that night. Hubby ordered one of Adam's cocktails; I thought the cocktails were too funky for my taste with its spicy ginger, cardamom flavors. No fancy cocktail for me; I stuck with my yummy Dogfish Head 60 Minute IPA as a pre-dinner treat.  Okay, we know it's American food but we ate it Chinese family-style anyway. We ordered the onion rings, beets and cured char salad, and squash with fresh tagliatelle as appetizers to share. My favorite was the pasta; the noodle itself was truly al dente and the sauce was fantastically flavorful and creamy. Mmm mmm mmm! The four of us also shared three entrees: grouper cheek sandwich, fried chicken, and ribeye for two. :) The grouper cheek was my idea; the dish could be described as a nicely-executed fish-n-chip sandwich. Cousin B's pick of fried chicken was tasty as well with its own tangy sauce and veggies.  The stand-out dish was the grilled ribeye. Before the chef carved it up, a server brought the ribeye in a giant iron skillet to show us the bone-in meat in all its glory. The ribeye was super tender and juicy. The seasoning was minimal to show off the beefy taste. Our table of carnivores was all happy. Though stuffed, our table shared one last dish-- the peanut butter cheesecake(?) with pretzel crust. It was the right amount of velvety sweetness to send us all home... at around 11:30pm.  Despite our tardiness, the staff gave us the table we originally wanted next to the window. They provided consistent, attentive service throughout our 2+ hour meal. The evening started out slow but the food at K&K totally saved it.

2010-07-28,5.0,"This past Saturday I joined my friends for dinner and a much needed girls night out.  My friend suggested Kith and Kin (which I was not familiar with) because she had met one of their investors at her work.   I was running late (par usual) and on a Saturday night with a packed restaurant and a party of 5, this can be a deal breaker.  Kith and Kin was so flexible.  I arrived and the host jumped into action to get me settled in with my girls.  The server (Raquel) didn't skip a beat and it was almost like I had been their all along.  This may seem trivial, but most places would not have been so compliant. The girls were drinking wine (happily), but I tend to gravitate towards beer.  I was so excited when I got a hold of the beer list.  To me, a proficient beer list (with a good array of options for every kind of beer snob) is an early tell of how accomplished the food is going to be. Just before our food arrived we where greeted by Moe Taleb, Kith and Kin's General Manager/Partner.  He wanted to make sure we had everything we needed and just to give us a warm welcome.  He was so friendly and accommodating.   Our dinner arrived and in a minute sheer silence at the table.  This is a rare occasion for this group of girls.  Everything, everything looked and tasted amazing.   We choose to do a family style order so everyone got to try a little of everything.  We had Braised Rabbit Leg Ragout with Lingunie, Grilled Wagyu Baseball Steak, Berkshire Pork Tenderloin Sous Vide,...Nichol's Farm Buttered Green Beans.  My favorite was the Wagyu Steak it accompanied my Delirium Tremens to a tee!   As we were finishing dinner Chef David Carrier stopped by our table to see how our fare was treating us.  I always think it is so fantastic  to meet the Chef.  He was humble and funny, what a great combo! We finished up with an array of shared desserts and some outstanding espresso.  This was an A+ dinner out!  Kith and Kin is an extremely approachable and ascetically sound restaurant.

2010-07-17,1.0,"Okay, rarely am I inspired by a restaurant enough (positively or negatively) to post a review, but I have to in the case of Kith and Kin.   I give this place one star.  Not because of the food, or the drinks, or even the water.  This place gets one star because we didn't GET any of those things.  Or even a waiter.   We tried KK at 8:45 on a Friday night.  It was busy, but not full--I'd say about 1/4 of the tables were empty.  We went to the hostess stand and, notwithstanding the fact that there were several empty tables, she asked us to wait a few minutes so they could ""clean something off for us.""  ????? We were eventually seated along the wall, alongside several other full tables.  We saw not one, not two, but three different servers come out to the various tables around us--including one that was seated after us--but nobody came to our table.  Not even a busboy with water.  As the minutes rolled on (I know, people get impatient at restaurants in a relatively short time--we'd probably been seated for about 5 minutes).  As my wife and I sometimes do in those situations, we set a fairly generous deadline for someone to come--another five minutes.  At several points, we thought we were going to be saved from having to enforce the deadline, as more servers came perilously close to actually approaching our table.  But, alas, it never happened.  And after at least 10 (probably 15) minutes of sitting unattended to, we did something we've never had to do in six years of eating out in Chicago:  we walked out without having been served.   Maybe it was an aberration, maybe (as some of the other reviews suggest) the service just ain't all that great.  But there are two many good restaurants in this city to give this place another try.",0.8625,0.882,0.069,0.049,0.46851851851851845

To top it off, the acoustics are pretty awful so you need to yell in order to hear each other. I would expect that at a trendy West loop restaurant, but not this LP comfort restaurant. The food was fair. The flavors went well together. The best dish of the night was my friend's pasta, but that was because it was soaked in butter, so what's not to like? The service was awful. It took them almost 45 minutes to bring out our salad, which they apologized for by saying their kitchen was backed up. So backed up that they can't throw lettuce on a plate?

Following the salad we enjoyed some scallops, perfectly seared over a salad of clams and asparagus with a bright sauce and a dollop of almost desert-like lavender mousse.  Our main course was the fried chicken over potato salad.  Ive never had chicken so good and Im pretty sure I have dreamt about it every night since!  We capped of the night with the peanut butter pie, it was surprisingly light and fluffy with just the right amount of crunch from the crust.  Outrageously good!

Just the term every potential suitor wants to hear, eh? Welcome to the dreaded Friend Zone, Mate.  The restaurant space is actually quite cute and exudes a friendly, neighborhood warmth and effortless welcoming that makes this a notable spot for Lincoln Parkers - and the rest of us - to get our date nights, group dinners and private events on. Really liked the use of fresh, modern décor elements here (think wood craftsman buck head set on a sleek, travertine fireplace) combined with a lot of old Chicago conventional charm. Lurvely, without a doubt. Where things actually fell a bit short for me was in the menu execution, unfortunately, and for me that's where effort counts the most.  The menu rotates daily and is comprised of French-inspired fare like steak frites and chicken paté, in addition to starters called 'crocks', which unite bread service and spreads into one tasty, harmonious unit. Loved the brandade crock especially. Perfectly blended, creamy, smooth and salty (but not too much so) served with crisp crostini and in plenty, it was a great palate opener and downright delicious. Unfortunately, its partner, the rich and decadent foie gras crock left much to be desired with its topper of hardened clarified butter that just looked like a big 'ol fatty congealed mess. Unappetizing and awkward to maneuver around, it set the stage for Kith and Kin's paradigm: for every one really good thing you have, up next is something, well, not quite as brilliant.  Such it went with the bright, fresh and summery Roulade of Roasted Zucchini, Arugula and Ricotta and its disheartening and boring cohort, the oily and overdressed Cucumber, Chevre and Strawberry Salad. Then again with the amazing, down-home dish of tantalizing Buttermilk Fried Chicken Thighs and Morel Potato Salad which was not the least bit complemented by a flailing dish of bone-in Skate Wing that was so chock full of bony cartilage it was almost impossible to navigate through without multiple throat stabbings. Sigh. I did see another table with this dish whose waiter kindly assisted in a swift removal of both sets of bones, sadly such was not the case with my plate resulting in a quite cumbersome fight with my fish making it utterly difficult to enjoy. Heck, even the desserts seem to suffer from the same split personality syndrome: panna cotta (yum) with poached rhubarb (blech), almond financier (mmm) with pickled blueberries (ick).  In my fabulicious cuisine lovin' book, Kith and Kin can be chalked up to good, not great.

My mom ordered a salad which was literally just lettuce and dressing.  Also pretty boring. I ordered the pickled shrimp which the waitress had recommended.  It was served cold (intentionally) with a bowl of cold and practically raw vegetables.  It was inedible.  Literally, I didn't eat it.   We complained until they took the shrimp and the appetizer off of our check.

However, there were several issues with the service that were disappointing.  Firstly, our server was absent for a significant portion of time after our food was ordered.  We were taken care of by bus boys/food runners, but were unable to get her attention or time for more drinks or food issues.  Our drinks sat empty for significant periods of time.   The only food issue we had was the ridiculous amount of crostinis for the crocks.  We were putting healthy portions on the crostinis, but still needed to request extras twice. It was silly, and by the second time, a little awkward.  Dips should always be served with a more than adequate number of ""chips"", not an stonishing lack thereof. In addition to our servers absence, we also had a problem with the dishes being cleared.  It seemed the second we set our silverware down, someone would swoop in and try to take a plate away no matter how much food was remaining.  My wife actually grabbed her wine glass out of the waitresses hand as she tried to clear it while it still had a full gulp remaining. Finally, we were celebrating a birthday.  We did not plan to bring it up at dinner, but were asked when we made reservations if there was a special occasion, and the host said they would note it.  Nothing was made of it by our server.  It's not as big a deal as the other issues, but was noticed, since the staff went out of their way to ask when making reservations, then never acted on it. After the fact, I wrote the restaurant an email to to tell them of my displeasure and they never responded.  A simple apology would have sufficed.

When you open up a new restaurant and are working out the kinks there are a few things you should do to get the customers to come back.  1. Give freekin bread to hold the hungry customers over if the food is taking an hour to come out.  2. Offer a round of drinks on the house 3.

Our group of four was unanimous on Kith and Kin - it is not a restaurant any of us would return to.  Our table consisted of two married couples from the Oak/LSD hood.  My wife and I eat out almost every night, and our friends eat out several nights every week.  Our main judgments all related to the food, which we found to be mediocre at best. There were a few non-food related highlights.  The parking on Webster was easy (especially for a pleasant Friday evening, 3/19), and within a block of the restaurant.  The chairs were among the most comfortable I've experienced, and I don't know why more restaurants don't also buy comfortable chairs with arms.  The noise level was tolerable, though that could be a function of the restaurant never being very filled - not a good sign for this restaurant making it. But the food, unfortunately, was truly mediocre at best.  From the tasteless foie gras crock, to the returned chicken thighs (so over the top salty, that even my saltaholic self could not enjoy it), to the forgettable pasta, to the very ordinary onion rings - there just wasn't anything that would cause any of us to either return to, or recommend, this restaurant.  We love trying new places, but were actually sorry we had heard about this one. We all partook of beer and wine, and the bill for the four of us, before tip, was $180.  I have spent 2, or even 3 times that amount for great meals, and thought those more expensive meals were great values.  This amount, at Kith and Kin, felt way too high for such mediocrity.

The soup was pretty good, nothing really special about it and I would have liked a little more 'soup' in it versus the soaked bread and onions that basically filled the bowl.

The short rib was. . . a short rib. Nothing special, unfortunately. It looked great and the kale on top was amazing. Weird eh? The chicken, on the other hand, was great. Everything about it was perfectly balanced and it was perfect bite after perfect bite. I have not had a brussel sprout since my horrid experiences with them as a child and I could not get enough of them, the oh-so-soft potato gnocchi or the delicious sauce that covered them both.  For dessert, he got the banana pudding and I got the chocolate peanut butter cake. According to him the banana pudding was good. It looked like baby food, but it was good.

Neither of us were very happy with either dish.  The pasta was a little more under cooked than I prefer....borderline hard.  The mushrooms lacked flavor.  The crawfish dish was also lacking flavor.   Had the food been amazing we probably would have been o.k. with the price.  In short, I'd prefer to go somewhere else next time.",0.9565,0.792,0.18,0.028,0.5465277777777778

The first offerings on then menu are crocks, which are great shared items. I've had the eggplant, the chicken liver pate, the pork creton and the foie gras. All were delightful. The eggplant and foie gras stand out. As for the main courses... I love the idea of curried mussels but I wish the chef had implemented his fearlessness of flavor on them.   The bass was delicious and perfectly executed.  The wine list, especially the by-the-glass part, could be improved.  And then there's the service. It sucks. I'd give the place 5 stars, except for that.  On my first visit we had to wait an agonizing amount of time for food to arrive. On my second visit, I joined a two people who'd arrived before me and had to wait a very long time before anyone even approached me to ask for my drink order.

Bar staff is surprisingly well-trained and were able to come up with a fun cocktail for my friend who's allergic to vodka. Food is always yummy! Eggplant appetizer (I can't remember what they call them) was delicious. Beat salad is to die for-- sweet yummy beats just the right tenderness with creme freche is my go-to salad there. Chicken thighs are a must! I'd avoid the shrimp N grits during winter b/c shrimp is likely frozen and not fresh. Lamb neck stew is incredible!,0.9704,0.674,0.246,0.08,0.6287414965986394
2010-03-05,2.0,"I really want to give Kith and Kin 4 stars for the quality of the food, but the sub-par service turned what should have been a great night into something less. We had 8:45 reservations on Friday night.  A bit late, but nothing horrible.  We arrived about 5 minutes early, got our table and ordered drinks and our meal all within the first 15 minutes.  So far so good.  15 minutes later our crock of chicken liver pate arrives.  Things are excellent so far.  We finish our crock and then wait.....and wait....and wait. Now I am not an impatient person naturally, but it was 5 till 10 before our entres arrived.  We watched as the table next to us ordered, ate and paid and the table across from us arrived, ordered and ate.  WTF!!!!  An order of seared bacon with potatoes, onions and sausage and an order of shrimp and grits with a side of poutine should be 2 of the quickest items on the menu.  Nothing about it should take over 10 minutes...definitely not the 45+ we waited, with quickly disappearing drinks, between finishing out app and the arrival of our mains. I do have to say the food, when it arrived, was excellent.  The Staff could see we were visibly upset and eventually the manager (well after our dished arrived) offered us complimentary desserts.  I really would have preferred a drink (on the house) or two while waiting for our food (as if the wait was actually necessary) but, alas, that was not offered/suggested.  With nothing to do but go with the flow, we ordered our free banana pudding and espresso-filled doughnut (again excellent flavors and presentation.)  But when the check arrived the doughnut was ""accidentally"" included in the bill.  Again WTF!!!  After sending it back and finally paying the total damage to the wallet was not too bad (4 cocktails, a crock 2 mains and a side for ~$100) but it still was not a great night. The quality of the cocktails would be the only thing that would possess me to return here.  The food was good, but a number of other places not too far away do it just as well if not better for the price (Ceres Table in Andersonville and The Purple Pig on Michigan both come to mind.)  In the end, what should have been a short 60-75 minute meal turned in to a 2+hour ordeal.    I really wanted to love you Kith and Kin.  Seeing the treatment given to the tables surrounding us I know what you are capable of, but we certainly did not get any of it.  I might give you another shot, but I am definitely sitting at the bar.",0.9963,0.805,0.156,0.039,0.6265022675736963

By 9:15 we still had not been seated and were hanging out at the bar- which was very pleasant aside from the fact that we were starving.  We were finally seated about 45 minutes past our reservation time, however they were extremely apologetic and  it was clear that people who ate earlier were just hanging out at their tables- which they cannot control, and which I think is a good sign of a good atmosphere. Upon seating us, the manager immediately brought over a complimentary Pate- which was excellent- followed by another free appetizer and a glass of wine to pair it with, for being patient and waiting for our table.  Our waiter was helpful and knew everything on the menu, and the food was tasty. What could have been an unfavorable experience turned into a great time with great food.

I'm glad I did because I had a great time and a great meal. First off, I believe this place is rather new? Either way, the restaurant didn't have a big sign out front anywhere to indicate that it was indeed Kith & Kin. That's how you know a place is truly fancy.  Anyways, on to the food.  We started off by ordering a side of poutine as an appetizer. Other than the resulting argument about whether I was closer when claiming it was topped with turkey gravy or my friend was closer when he claimed it was chicken broth, it was delicious (I was obviously closer, btw). Being a nice restaurant with interesting dishes, most of us tried to get a different entrée and (for the most part) we succeeded. Personally, I got the beef belly, which I had never had before. It was a great cut of meat - very tender and very flavorful. I must say, I was a bit worried I had made a poor decision though when the chef came to the table to have everyone smell the amazing ribeye that two of my friends ordered. That was plain mean.

We ordered two bottles of wine (one red, one white) when we ordered our entrees.  The waitress knew NOTHING about any of the wines on the menu and was unable to recommend anything to go with what we had ordered (not that I would take wine advice from someone who tells me that a riesling isn't sweet).   Our entrees came, the wine did not.  The lamb stew and the mushroom papardelle were inedibly salty.  The braised beef  belly and the scallops and clams were completely devoid of any flavor. When we were about 3/4 done with our entrees, our wine showed up.  At that point, we were not about to drink two bottles of wine, so we asked her to only open one.  We could tell she was pissed, but whatever.  We would have drank them if she had brought them about 30 minutes before.  Not having wine opened and poured prior to the arrival of entrees is completely unacceptable to me.  We had empty cocktails, empty water glasses and empty wine glasses...and salty food.  Strike 3.

2010-02-20,4.0,"There is something that Cheers, Seinfeld, and Friends all have that I have always wanted - a cool neighborhood place to hang, eat, meet, drink. And I have found it in Kith & Kin. K & K came recommended by a friend, and since Scuba Steve and I were cruising around on a Saturday with no particular end game in sight, we deicded after driving by that we would give it a try.  I called in the late afternoon to make a reservation for 6:30 on a Saturday - and Yelpers, let me tell you, it's a good idea. It was slowly but surely starting to fill up as we arrived and once we were seated there was a steady flow of people that did not let up until we left at 8 pm. The decor is really warm and inviting - and I love that the tables are covered with kraft paper, the napkins are dishcloths, and the waiters wear these cute aprons.  They have a good drink menu, although I think they went a little heavy on the gin drinks. I did give the Pimm's Cup a try and enjoyed it, however I will warn that it's not for everyone!  We were immdiately appraised of the menu and what items to select. My main problem was selecting what I wanted to eat, becauase there are so many good choices! We chose the chicken liver pate ""crock"" to start, which came with a little dab of mustard, cornichons, and crostini (all you can eat crostini!). The pate was good - a nice, solid pate. Next time I am for sure going to try the fois gras, but for this visit, pate was plenty. I then had the beet salad - delicious, although I am a beet fan, so I'm a little biased. The grapefruit in the salad was a nice foil to the heartiness of the beet. Scuba Steve ordered the veal rigatoni for his entree, and I had the braised beef belly (which comes with roasted root vegies on top of potatoes...at least I think that's what that mashed deliciousness was!). Both were quite good, but our only criticisms were that there was not enough veal in the rigatoni (and it was in a huge chunk), and my braised beef belly was a little too salty. But the rigatoni itself was really good (not too rich), and the braised beef belly was a great choice for a cold February evening. Last, we had the olive oil cake with an orange semifreddo - delicious! The cake was more dense than I thought it would be, but it was still good, if a little on the dry side. The semifreddo was a good pairing with the (not overly) sweet cake. Another plus is that the prices are very reasonable, and it's also a good place to go if it's just the two of you, or for a group - so many choices, and you can get a bunch of ""crocks"" to share.  I told Scuba Steve that this is my new neighborhood fave - we are thinking of even doing my upcoming birthday dinner there - since there are so many wonderful things to try on the menu!

The second time was horrible.  I had the french onion soup, was as good as other yelpers say.  However, I had the burger.  I was intrigued by the homemade biroche bun.  It was too thick and chewy for a burger.  I asked for my burger cooked medium and it was more towards well.  The burger itself was flavorless.  My husband had the mussles which he said tasted very briney, not much flavor, and the bread they call ""Naan"" is not naan.  We were less than impressed.  But, we still wanted to come back again.  Next time, we said, we would order things that require techincal expertise and aren't just things like burgers and fries. The third time.  Something was definatley wrong in the kitchen.  We ordered the creamed spinach crock.  It was soooo salty.  It was like no one tasted it before it was served to us.  Then our entrees were also salty.  My husband had the chicken thighs, and enjoyed the gnocci the best.  The brussle sprouts were undercooked and very bitter.  I had the wild mushroom paperdelle again and was pleased.  But the dessert was laughable!  It was described as housemade eclairs with chocolate fondue to dip the eclairs in.  It was basically an inch and a half long hard bread stick filled with coffee flavored cream.  The chocolate fondue was gritty.  And they only served it with three eclairs!  And it cost $6.00!!!  That was a joke. After this last dinner, we're likely not to come back.  But if you want to try it out, stick to dishes that require technical ability to create.  Stay away from the sandwiches.

The hostess was confused and asked if we wanted to come back, even though we immediately told her we knew we were early, and hoped that there would be a table. After a bit, she told us we could wait 10-15 minutes, even though there were plenty of free tables available.

We ordered 2 appetizers, the mussels and 2 entrees.  20 minutes later, we got our mussels, the foie gras and the onion soup. The mussels were in a tasteless (definitely not Curry tasting) broth that was way too salty. The foie gras was pretty good, but again too salty for our taste, while the onion soup was rather delicious (even though it was served without any bread).  After our starters we waited another 25 minutes for our entrees. We had the beef belly and the rigatoni; both of which were excellent!!  For dessert we shared the chocolate eclairs, which was so so. I mean it was good, but nothing to rave about.  So overall, we got a really lousy service - the staff was unable to recommend and seemed more interesting in avoiding being available for the guests. The waiting time was terrible, 2 hours for the whole meal when we initially told the waitress that we had plans after the dinner is IMHO unacceptable.  The food was all right, nothing special.

It was still good (could have used more broth, they were on the dry side but the mussels themselves were of a good size) but just not what we were expecting. The steelhead trout also wasn't what we expected. A little too salty for my taste and it looked closer to a salmon then a trout. The highlight was by far the mushroom ragout with parpadelle pasta.

Not too big and not too small, it was a great start, and our attentive, knowledgeable server made sure that the accompanying crispy bread didn't run out.  My wild mushroom ragout pappardelle was a steaming dish of mushroomy deliciousness. Its huge--HUGE!--mushrooms were in perfect ratio to its hand-cut pasta, and its warm earthiness made for a satisfying main course. Significant Other's Grouper Cheek sandwich was a little unwieldy, but that was because it was stacked with tender pieces of perfectly fried fish. Expect to eat it with a fork and knife.

Our server was friendly & enthusiastic when we asked for suggestions on the menu.  Unfortunately, she WAY oversold.  The pork spread appetizer had a strange texture - both light & chunky at the same time.  If not for a heavy dose of spicy mustard on the side, we probably wouldn't have had a 2nd bite. The short rib entree was fair at best.  Not particularly tender or flavorful, and served on top of a peculiar leafy vegetable + cream sauce mixture.  My companion had the mussels, which had at least a dozen full cloves of garlic in the broth.

I've been told that many bars and restaurants have tried this same space but to no avail. You can tell that they did not try to build out anything new, and made the surrounds fit their needs. Which, at the end of the day, I think works very well. There is wood paneling and coat hooks throughout the place, a fireplace and large bar by the front. We even ended up at one of two tables in the back that are located up a few steps. I felt like I was on a perch overlooking the place, and I really enjoyed the vantage point and seclusion. Erica even mentioned that she felt like this could have  been on the side of a mountain, highlighting the faux (made of wood) deer head mounted over the fireplace. The servers were even wearing aprons on top plaid button downs. The mood was set and it worked with the concept. Aside from the service, the meal itself was just fine, no fireworks but good choices from an interesting menu. I agree that they serve comfort, easy to understand dishes. A few pasta, sandwich, fish and meat dishes to choose from all reasonably priced between $11-18. And you're not just getting pasta with meat sauce or steak frites. Along with a typical burger, you can order an open-faced fried egg. There is a bone-in ribeye, but also buttermilk fried chicken thighs. We were both in a pasta mood so Erica had the wild mushroom ragout and hand cut pappardelle while I ordered braised veal rigatoni. All pasta is made in house.  To start the meal we ordered the creamed spinach ($5). It came with toasted challots and pieces of toasted bread. I really enjoyed this dish as I prefer my creamed spinach light on cream. It was also fun to eat it like I eat spinach artichoke or bruschetta, placing small bites on tasty toast.  Our main dishes were nice, but nothing to get too excited about. The pasta was as good as you expect for homemade, no complaints there. My veal was hit or miss, some pieces being very tough, others nice and soft. The flavor was good, but I found that it got better as I found the bottom where most of the juices and sauce were hiding. I found myself going after the little pieces of veal and stayed away from the tougher large chunks. Again, good dish (for $14) that I couldn't do at home so I don't mind ordering it out.    Our overall experience was mixed though. The food was fine, nothing exceptional, and the value reasonable. With service being as bad as it was, I'd say it all adds up to a 3/5. Maybe the beer-battered cod or braised beef short ribs are better dishes, and maybe the service was overwhelmed on a Wednesday night. But that wasn't my experience and I don't know if I will be running back when there are many other places to check out. If you live in the neighborhood it's worth a look, otherwise stick with your own local spot.",0.9973,0.798,0.157,0.046,0.49787212787212787
2010-02-02,5.0,"My boyfriend and I stumbled into Kith and Kin last night totally by chance. We live a couple blocks away, and had passed by it once or twice before, but never really thought to stop in. And I am so glad we did. This place totally knocked my socks off, and that is hard to do. The bf and I are regulars at The Drawing Room, Balsan, Publican, Avec, Violet Hour, etc. (to put this into context, I guess), and we are no strangers to dropping shitloads of money on food and drinks. Hey, its what we do. Im the person thats more than willing to work 90 hours a week so we can save up for Alinea. Up until this point, our home neighboorhood of Lincoln Park hasn't provided us with a reason to stick close to home. Lets face it, most of the places in LP just don't cut it. Either its just too shitty or just too expensive. But Kith and Kin is the answer to my neighborhood woes.  When we walked in, the hostess gave us a great smile and showed us to a table that kind of overlooked the dining room on a little balcony thing. The fireplace was nice. Our server, Donny, was there before I could blink. I was having trouble picking out a beer... too much to choose from.. ""Well what kind of beer do you normally like?"" Ha, funny question... I drink anything and everything worth drinking. ""Um, I like Belgins... I dunno, just give me the Unibroue."" There were a couple of them on the menu, and I guess he knew which one I was talking to. The bf ordered an Aviation, which turned out to be the only bla part of our meal. Ratio of creme de violette to citrus was backwards. Whatever, Donny was totally cool with bringing him a beer instead. Bf felt like an ass sending back a drink, but one of our new years resolutions is to forget that we work in the industry when we go out and ask for things we want nicely. Ordered the pate ($5??? WHAT???). Huge portion and delicious. Get it. Then he had the mushroomy homemade pasta (name eludes me) and I had the chicken thighs. Holy mother. My (brined! or something) chicken was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and the skin was just crispy enough. Served with potato gnocchi and brussels along with a mustardy creamy sauce. I literally ate everything. EVERYTHING y'all. His pasta was also perfectly cooked and almost as awsome as my chicken. I wouldnt shut up about how good the food was. Donny asked if I wanted another beer. ""I dunno.... just bring me something."" Gumballhead to go with the chicken. Worked great. So I'm stuffed. They have a real chef back there. Someone knows what they are doing. Dessert was a pineapple crostada and the banana pudding. Both were great, but by then they could have given me cheese and crackers and I would have been happy.  Donny was totally awsome and gave us stellar service. Loved it. Go. You wont have a problem getting a table (though I hope this changes). You will get great service, awsome food, and all for a totally unbeatable price. For two people, three courses and beers, expect about $60 ish, before tip. Give or take. And they are open until midnight 7 days a week!! Please please support this place... I want it to stick around so I have somewhere to go in LP!",0.9986,0.767,0.187,0.045,0.6390383426097712

All of the food is excellently executed, and cleverly thought out.  My favorite example is the 'Bar Harbor Mussels ipa, madras curry, pickled garlic, naan.'  The dish isn't overpowering or leave the consumer reeking of Indian spice, yet the dish has a very Indian theme.  IPA beer was invented  as a beer with a prolonged shelf-life to survive the trip from Britain to India.  That is paired with madras curry, an Indian seasoning blend, and naan, an Indian bread.  Very cool stuff. The dim lit restaurant sets the mood for dates, and is anything but pretentious--not too bad on the wallet either.  With a great beer selection to boot, Kith and Kin is a great dining destination in Lincoln Park.",0.9388,0.827,0.134,0.039,0.7253030303030302
2010-01-26,4.0,"Breakups are very similar to marriages. Both have the words ""special occasion"" written all over them. Both require you to be strong, loving, understanding, and accommodating. Most importantly, both require you to respect each other and act civil.... like the adults that you are. Why am I telling this? Because this is where the ex-husband and I had dinner just hours after breaking up. He suggested we go to Kith and Kin because it has the perfect atmosphere for a romantic date or a post-breakup dinner. It is also the perfect location because the food will divert your attention from the pain of going through a breakup.  I needed a vesper martini after crying my eyes out all afternoon. He ordered an old fashioned. They might have/ have not helped ease the pain. But they were good. We sat at the bar instead of a table, we were not on a dinner date. Felt odd after 5 years of being together. Well, snap out of it V, this is your new single life. Accept it, respect it, and move on.  The menu changes constantly. We ordered the chicken liver pate for an appetizer. Wait, it's only $5? Holy hell. Somebody tell these people to charge more. I am used to paying anywhere from $12-18 for a similar pate appetizer in a similar restaurant. Sweet deal. We shared the pate while discussing next steps in our life. How to handle the parents? How to handle the baby (our dog)? How to handle ourselves? For the next course I ordered a salad - endives, blue cheeese, and prosciutto. Excellent! He ordered a French onion soup. Either he must have really liked it, or he was avoiding conversation with me... because he finished the soup within 2 minutes. We decided to split an entree. I ordered the lamb. We got a side of Anson Mills grits with mascarpone as a side. Perfectly prepared lamb, succulent, and tasty. Big enough for sharing if you are not starving. The grits were a little lacking. I know grits are bland to begin with, but I was expecting to have a hint of the mascarpone flavor. Didn't find any. Good, nevertheless. We did not order dessert. Instead, we ordered another round of drinks. I perused the wine list, it is decent. Service was perfect, even though we sat at the bar. The ambiance is ideal for first dates, consecutive dates, girls nights out, taking parents out, and, as in our case, post-breakup dinner.  We ended the night as two good friends, which we will always be. Thank you Kith and Kin for providing the right food and atmosphere to deal with our issues.

2010-01-25,4.0,"Kith and Kin (wasn't that a line spoken by Clark Griswold in the movie, Christmas Vacation?) meaning ""friends and family"" is a welcoming, homey spot for that perfect date or to catch up with friends.  It is a bit hard to find as there is no exterior signage (it's next door to Strand, which has good signage) but worth the effort to find. Once you pull open the door- you are in a warm room with linen topped tables, lots of dark wood, and a fireplace in the back to warm up to.  I got there early for our reservation so I pulled up a stool to the bar and spent a little time talking to the bartender. They have a list of speciality cocktails but even if you order an ""old favorite"" it will be different as they don't carry the mainstream brands (no Grey Goose-pout)- but smaller boutique types of liquor which also make for a good drink.  We were seated promptly by the fireplace and began to look over the menu. They have a number of ""crocks"" on the menu as starters. The server explained that they don't do bread for the table so these starters are meant to stay throughout the meal as a bread replacement. We ordered the chicken pate and the pimento cheese spread. Each came in a little crock, with the chicken pate ""capped"" with hardened butter on the top which is supposed to be eaten with the pate- but we enjoyed it without. The cheese spread was simple but very tasty. Both come with crostini on which to enjoy the various spreads.  For our entrees- I had the pink trout filet over garbanzo beans and my friend had the lamb. My fish was amazing- so much so the description that the server gave me prior to ordering didn't do it justice. Perfectly cooked with crispy skin on one side,and no bones, the tender fish was delicious! My friend's lamb was also good but the fish was clearly the winner of the evening. For our side- we ordered the poutine.  What is poutine, you ask?  Usually some type of fried potatoes (in this case french fries) smothered in gravy and cheese curds.  These were great- not too much gravy as is often the case. While we were just going to end with coffee and tea- the banana pudding with sugar cookies sounded like the perfect end to our meal and it was. Oh- and who wouldn't love the little french press that the coffee comes in or the tea pot that steeps and strains the tea before pouring. Nice touches.  Our server was delightful and other than her mis description of the trout, (she didn't mention it was a boned filet-it sounded more like a whole fish) was spot on in all of her other suggestions from wines by the glass to that wonderful dessert.  Dinner for two with dessert and a couple of drinks was right around $100. Street parking can be tricky in this area but look over on Clinton or if you can walk a couple of blocks- there is usually space on Racine.  So for a taste of some french country cooking- check out Kith and Kin. For it's the perfect place for your friends and family to enjoy a night out.",0.9985,0.778,0.186,0.036,0.5021045918367346
2010-01-23,4.0,"Possibly my new favorite restaurant.   Started with the French Onion Soup -- very tasty!  Sometimes f.o.s. leans too heavily on the cheese and the soup is bland, but this was really good.  I wish it was a bigger serving, but then I wouldn't have had much room for the rest of dinner. Chicken Thighs w/brussels sprouts and potato dumplings - wow!  Crispy skinned chicken seasoned perfectly, light fluffy dumplings.  And I've never been a fan of brussels sprouts but these were good, tender and sweet.   For dessert, the banana pudding with house made 'nilla wafers.  Loved that the whipped cream on top of the pudding was slightly salted - great unexpected touch!   My boyfriend had a salad (which was fine) and the shrimp & grits, which he said was good, but not as good as my chicken thighs.  And we shared the poutine (french fries topped with chicken gravy & cheese curds).  That was fine, could have used a little more of both toppings, but the fries were cooked nicely.   Our server was really nice, did a great job of recommending wines to go with my meal and (rightly) steered me to the chicken thighs when I was deciding between a couple of things.

2010-01-22,4.0,"Not too fancy, not too casual, just right...that's the beauty of Kith & Kin.  From the service, to the menu, and even the waitstaff attire - this place had a nice balance of quality and upscale touches, without ever seeming pretentious, and actually maintaining a local and casual feel. When I walked in the door and saw Carol K (I'm sure she'll be reviewing soon), I knew I had to be on the right track.  We actually didn't know this location had turned over to a new restaurant until we walked in, but what a great surprise!  Now to the review... First off, the service was spectacular.  Our waiter was welcoming, friendly, and gave us great guidance/advice.  Probably some of the best service we've had in a while - not too fancy, not too casual, just right.   Now for the meal.  The menu (which changes daily) had a nice variety of options - veggies, pasta, red meat, chicken, fish.  Now that sounds scary because typically when restaurants have too many options they don't really do anything well.  But they only had 1 or 2 items for each of those categories, and everything we tasted was great.  The menu was really well balanced - some expensive things, some really affordable things - a couple could eat here for $30 or $150+ depending on what you ordered... We started with a bottle of Meyer-Fonne Pinos Gris.  And while the wine selection wasn't overly extensive, it was sufficient, and had several great options.  We hadn't had this before, but it was a great.  Off to a good start. Then we ordered a couple 'crock' appetizers - the french onion soup and the pimento cheese spread.  Nice little samplers to get started, not amazing, but you can't really go wrong with cheese spread. For our main course I had the steelhead trout with chickpeas and a yogurt sauce.  Seared on one side to give the fish a great crisp texture, still flaky and moist.  Extremely good, would order this day after day.  My wife had the cheeseburger and fries, which sounds extremely causal, but it was well prepared and displayed so it somehow fit in. The desserts sounded tempting, but we passed and walked a couple blocks to sweet mandy b's. The atmosphere was fine, but not spectacular.  With the location and style of this place, it felt like the interior should have been a bit more unique, but we're picky about atmosphere.

We wanted to try something different so the three of us shared a treviso (cabbage family) salad with blue cheese, candied walnuts and a balsamic dressing.  The waiter said that the treviso is slightly cooked to take away some of the bitterness.  The only good thing about the salad was the candied walnuts because the treviso was so bitter each of us could only stomach 2 bites.  On to dinner. I had the mussels with grilled naan bread bathing in a curry broth.  As a stated before the only good thing was the tap water here because the mussels might have well been bathing in that.  Had it been the mussels may have have had more flavor. My fiance ordered the confit chicken thigh with potato gnocchi and  brussel sprouts. All in all it was okay, nothing great to say about it, nothing bad to say about it a little KFC though. My good friend ordered spaghetti carbonara.  If I'm not mistaken, the eggs that make up the creamy sauce for a carbonara are not suppose to be cooked, unfortunately in this dish they were.  Also, when making a carbonara you should cut up the pancetta (bacon) into lardones(sp).  They placed half strips of bacon in the carbonara.  Okay, strips of bacon, cooked egg and to top it off it was dry, carbonara is creamy and delicious not dry and boring. After the comments at the table of the flavorless food we just ate, my friend was still hungry as she only had 2 bites of her carbonara since cooked eggs in her spaghetti turned her stomach a bit.  We decided to pull out the iPhone app ""UrbanSpoon"" to find a place for dessert.  Not finding anything, we tried to give this place one more chance and get  dessert.   Not such a good idea.  We got essentially a banana split with banana, brownie, ice cream, candied walnuts and whipped cream.  Fortunately the dessert had the candied walnuts but the brownie was incredibly dry.  The best part about the dessert.... The banana, which occurs in nature and all they did was slice it down the middle. So in the end the tap water and the waiter were the best parts about my experience at Kith & Kim",0.97,0.872,0.089,0.039,0.58096926713948
2010-01-04,5.0,"Had a 7:30 reservation on a weeknight; were seated near the fireplace in the very comfortable dining room. Huzzah, a new restaurant that doesn't feel the need to make you fall over every other diner when making your way to and from your table! I had been expecting a crowded gastropub or snazzy bistro; this room skirts the two and manages to avoid being a watered-down version of either. The waitress was very pleasant and attentive, though I had to wonder if maybe she had been practicing her monologues and trying out some new vocabulary options that day. A plus to her correct guess that we were service industry, though I suppose that reflects on the clientele more than on either her or us. My eye immediately went to the cocktail list - a hot buttered rum and a pimms cup were among the offerings. I will never turn down a hot buttered rum and this one definitely topped my all-time best lists, so much that I had a second. The pimms cup was a surprise--the thai basi taking this traditional favorite up a notch--and came with a side of mixer that helped to extend the cocktail throughout the meal. Started off with two crocks -- the chicken liver paté and pimento cheese spread. Now, this is meant as high praise--these are the things that grade school bag lunch dreams are made of. If these versions had made it to the cafeteria with me instead of the stuff out of the tubes/tubs my mother had stocked in the fridge, I would have had to fight off the potential trades. Great comfort food not only triggers sentimental food memories like you only thought your mother's cooking could, but it actually surpasses the reality of the sentiment (unlike mom's braunschweiger and bunny bread sandwiches). The crocks were quite generously sized, so we stuck with a couple of sides and an entree. The sides of braised rapini and poutine were both expertly prepared, though I'll admit that when the poutine arrived I asked my dining partner if they had forgotten the gravy. After my first bite, I realized that the gloppy brown stuff I had been expecting had no business anywhere in this dish; the fresh chicken gravy made me into a poutine junkie. We did the cod entree, and I have had very few pieces of seafood in the midwest that I have enjoyed as much as this one. The chef came to the table and explained a few questions we had regarding preparation and ingredient sources; he didn't hoard his knowledge and was obviously invested in the entire dining experience. Totally satiated (not to mention quite pleased with the bill which was small enough to seem as if it had a service industry discount but, upon further inspection, did not), we walked out in the blustery night, snapping out of our food coma enough to realize that we had just had a great meal in the heart of DePaul, as a group of underdressed ladies stumbled by, waving their arms over their head. Any establishment that can make me forget, however briefly, that I'm in Lincoln Park has some serious magic going on.",0.9832,0.883,0.086,0.031,0.5911402918069584
2010-01-03,5.0,"It was an extremely cold Saturday night. My husband and I wanted somewhere cozy and warm with a decent meal experience. I had read a bit about Kith & Kin and knew I wanted to try it eventually because the chef had worked at Trio and the French Laundry. I figured he must know his flavors and textures, etc. Plus, I knew a gastropub was what this wicked cold night needed. Since Kith & Kin hadn't been open for long, I didn't go into dinner expecting too much. Immediately when I walked in, I knew it was the atmosphere we were wanting that night. Open space, dark woods, low lighting, a fireplace in the back, and a Christmas tree with white lights and a star made out of spatulas. The cocktail menu consisted of old-fashioned drinks and there was also a decent wine and beer list. We started off dinner with 2 of the crocks -- chicken liver pate and the other, pork creton. I have to say -- we try pate from time to time but are always underwhelmed. This pate was the best I've had -- extremely deep in flavor and the dijon mustard that accompanied it added a nice kick. The pork creton was incredible as well -- bits of onion and herb layer throughout. The waiter even brought us extra pieces of crostini -- a very nice added touch considering we always run out before the pate is finished!  For our main courses, my husband had the chicken thighs with brussel sprouts, brown butter, and sage. Once again, the chicken had an incredible depth of flavor and the skin cracked beautifully.  For me, if there is ever Berkshire pork on the menu -- I order it. Mine was a Berkshire pork rib atop thyme jus and creamy grits. I'm still thinking of the texture of the pork -- so soft and juicy. The thyme really added a freshness and pleasantness to the dish -- with every bite there was a perfect amount. We added a few sides to our meal to really get the feel of the place -- root vegetables in what tasted like a buttery, slightly sweet syrup. It was amazing. We also ordered the poutine. The gravy was divine! To top it all off, we ordered the banana split requested by our server. He had guided us with perfection all night, so we took him up on it. It was a perfect ending to a perfect meal. We don't find perfection often but this was it! While we were waiting for our waiter to bring us the bill, I had already texted a few foodies friends that this place was a must.

2010-01-01,4.0,"It was on a quiet Sunday evening when a group of us decided to try out kith and Kin.  Located in a residential part of Lincoln Park, the rather inconspicuous-looking Kith and Kin did not even have a sign on the outside when I went (not sure if this is the latest trend, since Big Star also does not have a sign outside).  Once inside, the atmosphere was also very low key, but nonetheless comfortable.  Looking over the menu, prices were also very reasonable (almost all items were under $20).  I suppose Kith and Kin is truly a product of this recession.   The menu itself reminded me of The Publican: a focus on hearty meat dishes.  We started with the chicken liver pate.  It was topped with a layer of solidified fat, which we promptly removed.  The pate itself was smooth, well seasoned and balanced.  It is definitely enough for a group of people to share. Moving on to the entrees, i tried the chicken thighs and the choucroute, which is pork belly (braised?) and bratwurst served with sauerkraut.  Both were very delicious.  The chicken was crispy on the outside, tender on the inside.  The pork belly was rich, with a balanced ratio of meat and fat.  The one downside is that food was a tad salty.  This was especially the case with the sides of root vegetables and brussel sprouts. Desserts, though simple, were also tasty.  The sweet potato pie was particularly memorable. In all, Kith and Kin offers great food.  Keep in mind however that service can be slow.  It must have taken us close to 30 minutes to get our entrees after we had placed our orders.",0.9866,0.842,0.13,0.029,0.5903601953601954
2009-12-22,4.0,"Walking into Kith and Kin feels like walking into your rich, classy aunt's house in New England. Cozy fire, calming colors, sumptuous hardwood. But the food is more like what your cousin who went to culinary school would make at a holiday gathering. We started with the chicken liver pate, which was my first pate ever, and very good - not quite what I expected, frankly, but only because I thought it was going to taste very strongly of liver, when it was actually much more buttery. I had the Wild Mushroom Ragout with hand-cut pappardelle - the pasta itself was perfection, and the mushrooms were big, woodsy, rustic, and unrecognizable to my amateur eyes - but delicious. All this was swathed in a rich, yet delicate and buttery sauce. Totally slurpable, and a perfectly sized portion. My bf had the Cod in Coconut Broth. His portion was actually a bit disappointing compared to everyone else's, but what was there was delicious. His mom had (due to my reco from reading the other Yelp reviews) the Chicken Thighs, which I tasted, and they truly are a must-try. LISTEN TO ME, PEOPLE. At least order them for the table. They literally melt in your mouth. Amazing. The seasoning is incredible. For dessert, we all shared the New York style cheesecake, which would make any New Yorker proud. The service was great - polite but not too formal - and the host was very gracious when I called for a late reservation, then again to say I would be late in arriving. Overall, a great ambiance and fantastic experience!",0.9976,0.718,0.263,0.019,0.6232575757575757

But, on to the good stuff... The mushroom sauce that was supposed to be over parparadelle: wow.  All kinds of mush, very flavorful and rich. Mahi mahi in a coconut broth - perfect - not to strong, not to mild. Shrimp & grits - yummy, but I feel like the grits needed a bit more something. Chicken thighs - I never order chicken, but I'm glad my friend did.  Wow.

2009-12-12,5.0,"I went to kith and kin this past Friday with my girlfriend. We heard about it through a friend and decided to give it a go. We didn't have a reseration but the hostess seated us immediately even though they were clearly having a busy night. So far, so good.  Our server was with us promptly and offered us Natura filtered water (it's SO GOOD). We also started with two glasses of lovely prosecco.  Ok, the food. Their goal is clearly not to reinvent the wheel, but they are making GREAT WHEELS. The chicken liver pate was smooth and very flavorful, the warm Swiss chard salad was a great take on the worn down warm spinach salad you've seen elsewhere. And the poutine...the poutine. Dear god it's wonderful! Squeeky cheese curds and rich gravy on fries - delightful!  For entrees I had the bourride with little neck clams, fennel and saffron. It was absolutely wonderful. A touch of salt couldn't have hurt it, but I barely noticed it's absence while I was devouring it. My girlfriend had the braised beef short ribs with cole cannon and root vegetables. The meat was beautifully tender but not mushy, the Cole cannon was perfectly seasoned an had great texture.  We finished with cheesecake (light, fluffy, amazing) and coffee. The coffee is being roasted for them by dark matter (never heard of them!) and is perfect!  Service never missed a beat, we never waited long for everything.

2009-12-12,5.0,"This was a four and a half star experience that is getting five stars because Kith and Kin has only been open for two weeks and the kinks that we saw are going to be worked through soon--and, honestly, weren't particularly major. Monica and I were meeting another couple for eight o'clock reservations on a Friday night.  We were early (as always) and the hostess offered to seat us even with an incomplete party.  We opted to sit at the bar and we were glad that we did.  Monica had a gin-based cocktail.  The bartender was pleasant and helpful in our drink selection, and he saw Monica watching him as he was making her drink, so he took quite a bit of time explaining to her how he was making it and what the individual components were all about.  Then when he mixed my cocktail ( a rye drink of some sort), he mixed it in front of us so we could see.  Both drinks were sophisticated re-imaginings of very familiar and comfortable tastes--which seems to be a good phrase that captured the experience of the evening. When our friends arrived, we tried to close out at the bar and the bartender told us that he would be happy to transfer our drinks onto our dinner tickets.  This is a nice customer-service move, and it was very much appreciated. Dinner service was somewhat less doting, but still certainly adequate. The girls ordered french onion soup, and the boys ordered spinach dip and a beet salad to start, along with a charcutarie plate for the table.  The spinach dip was very good, as was the beet salad.  Though both dishes were well executed there was certainly nothing different about them.  The sausage in the charcutarie plate was fine, but the pork belly was absolutely phenomenal (honestly the best pork belly that I have ever eaten anywhere ever--it was crispy on the top and the bottom and tender in the middle and subtly and sophisticatedly seasoned).  But the real highlight from the first course was the french onion soup.  It was sublime.  Sublime.  Not only were the cheese, crouton and onion perfect, but the broth was truly exceptional.  I really can't even describe how perfect the broth was. Everyone had another round of cocktails:  I had a manhattan that was perhaps the stiffest drink that I have ever been poured in a restaurant, but was simply excellent.  Monica had a Pimm's and gin cocktail that would've been a great summer drink--it was certainly good, I just question the seasonality.  The guy we were eating with had a hot buttered rum, which made up for what the Pimm's drink lacked in seasonality, and was very tasty. For dinner we ordered four dishes for the table:  the burger with bacon and cheese, shrip and grits, wild mushroom ragout and hand cut papardelle and the chicken thighs.  We also got an order of onion rings and poutine for the table.  The poutine was fantastic.  The fries were pleasantly greasy, especially with the melted (and in places somewhat caramelized) cheese curd and it was topped with this really rich and exceptionally well seasoned gravy.  The onion rings were just okay. The burger, shrimp and the papardelle all came out at the same time.   All of them were very good.  The burger was just a burger, but a well-executed burger.  The shrimp were tasty, but the grits that they topped were really the highlight there--creamy and rich.  The papardelle was well sauced and delicately cooked, and the mushrooms were near-perfect. We did have a hiccough with the chicken thighs.  Our waiter put in the wrong chicken dish and seemed to forget about our plate.  But, in the end, it worked out fine because it gave us a little break that let everything else settle.  And the chicken thighs were worth the wait.  They were superlative.  The skin was crispy and the meat was delicate and cooked perfectly.  They were absolutely brilliant and a must-try.  And, of course, perhaps the most pleasant moment of the evening was when we got our bill--well under $100 per couple for way too much food and several rounds of drinks.  Exceptionally reasonable considering the quality of the food and the service.",0.9992,0.804,0.184,0.012,0.6054190476190477

The Poutine was a joke - they need to stop recommending this or completely re-engineer the dish.  The fries tasted like fast food fare and I've had better gravy out of a can. The main course were pretty decent - I ordered the grouper cheeks and it was standard fare, nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about.  My fiance ordered the short rib pot pie dish (which I tried) and this was actually delicious.  Overall the main courses were good but nothing that really stood out above the slew of similar Lincoln Park restaurants in this price range.

Yet, they served them cleverly in a napkin in a glass so I guess that makes them better?

So we didn't order our food yet and our 3rd waiter of the night goes ""I'll get these menus out of your way"" and I said ""we didn't order yet"" and the dude totally snapped at me ""Yeah, Im taking your order now, I just said that."" Sorry I don't understand the lingo in the poor service industry. Besides that.......our reservations that were made way in advanced were shot, we were offered cheesecake on the house and they didn't bring it, and they charged 2 random desserts on our bill.

However our reservations were not on record after calling in that same day. The busser greeted us at our table which was unexpected but very appreciated. The  waiter greeted us shortly after welcoming us and explaining their vast quantities of poutine. We ordered two helpings of the poutine.

When asked about our service we said it was ""sporadic"" which prompted the owner to offer us all free cheesecake. We accepted but the cheesecake never came after waiting 20 minutes. So we asked for our check and upon receiving it noticed we had been overcharged for items we never ordered.  Overall food was terribly slow but tasted fairly good. Waiter said we would receive greens for a meal but neglected to mention it ever again.
