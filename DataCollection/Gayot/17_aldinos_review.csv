2010-07-31,1.0,"Not surprised to see Aldino's closed! My boyfriend and I recently moved not far from there and bought the Groupon a few months back. About a month/month and a half ago we made a reservation and arrived for dinner around 7 p.m. on a Saturday.  The food LOOKED great, but service was absolutely terrible. After an hour we still didn't have a server (despite trying to flag one down). A server from a nearby table took pity on us and we were able to each order a glass of wine...but after 75 minutes of ignored attempts to figure out who our server was we walked out and handed the hostess our Groupon on the way out the door....",-0.824,0.875,0.034,0.091,0.44837962962962963

2010-06-21,2.0,"In a nutshell, I'm underwhelmed. I saw raving reviews about this place and decided to give it a shot. I went there for a Saturday night dinner. Arrived at 7pm and got a table immediately. This restaurant has a nice laid-back vibe. The waiter was friendly and patient. Ok, so far so good. Ordered grill octopus, asparagus and goat cheese ravioli, basil tomato soup and chocolate hazelnut cake. Then I started anticipating. And then my excitement just began going downhill. Grill octopus 4/5 Smoky flavor with somewhat chewy texture, blending nicely with the tangy taste of orange. Mine was a little bit charred but still impressive. Tomato soup 1/5 Fail. Nothing special to me at all. And where is the basil fragrance I was looking for?? Asparagus and cheese ravioli 2/5 Seriously? This costs $16? Tastes really bland. The meyer lemon sauce just didn't do its job. Hazelnut cake 3/5 I should thank this one because by the time this was served I was still hungry (that's what happened when you have a mouthwatering appetizer and then disappointing dishes). The cake goes well with the cream and mousse, but it was far from stunning. This place fell short on me and I will not go back to adventure any further without a groupon. Maybe they do have amazing dishes (just heard another compliment about their pork dishes), but an Italian restaurant serving mediocre pasta.. it's just not appealing to me.",0.9809,0.798,0.16,0.043,0.6532467532467533
2010-06-21,2.0,"I would love to blame the company I was with for my bad experience at Aldinos...but the truth is, this place just did not impress me at all.  I will say this... The host was fantastic. I'm not sure if he's an Owner of the place, but he seemed to go out of his way to make sure my date and I were taken care of. But the good review ends there.  This is Chicago! Land of great Italian food! So if you're going to serve Italian...it better be right. My date and I ordered an appetizer to start. The one we wanted was no longer available so we ordered meatballs instead. The flavor was pretty good, but they were only slightly warm. Then came our entrees. Again we had to settle on this because literally HALF the menu was unavailable that night. So I went for the risotto of the day and my date had swiss chard gnudi. My dish was hot this time, but it was bland and even dry.  Eating this dish was like a punishment.  I got down several bites for the sake of not offending my date.  My date's dish was so tiny he could have eaten the dish twice over.  Our server was friendly enough, but she seemed a little flaky. She told us she'd bring us bread, but the bread never came. Finally I think the host snapped his fingers and we got some bread about 20 minutes in to us sitting down.  Maybe this was an off night for the place.  I know a lot of people were there using a groupon.  Even still, being that there are a million of great Italian restaurants just down the street from this place, I suggest you look elsewhere.",0.9905,0.791,0.158,0.051,0.5665608465608466
2010-06-12,2.0,"I picked Aldino's for a Saturday night dinner with my wife and some business associates.  We had attended an event at UIC and were hoping for some solid authentic Italian afterward.  Unfortunately, I have to say that both the service and food were disappointing.  We showed up for an 8:15 reservation, and the table was ready at 8:30 (not entirely the restaurant's fault as they had a slow table ahead of us).  After we were seated, it took about 10 minutes for our waitress to greet us.  She was not unfriendly, just totally passive.  No name, no welcoming us, no discussion of specials.  After she took two of our drink orders, she then walked away and came back 10 minutes later for the rest of us.  We had to tell her that the other half of us still needed to order. This happened a couple times- she would take part of our orders and then walk away, and she took a while to get around to the actual entree orders.  Overall, not rude but no interaction at all with the table and it was honestly strange how piecemeal it was! I had the arugula salad to start and it was very good.   The waitress recommended the risotto of the day with chicken and various cheeses which I tried- it was terrible.  It looked and tasted like cream of chicken and rice soup with no salt or pepper, and cost about $18.   The waitress asked if we needed anything else at the end of the dinner, but didn't seem to want us to order anything else.  No offer of coffee or dessert.   I wish I could give this a better review, but frankly it was totally subpar.  Unprofessional, passive and slow waitstaff and a mediocre entree- not the ideal dinner for a night with business contacts.  I will say that some of the people in our party enjoyed their meal.  But there are  a lot of options in Little Italy and I would not particularly recommend this one.",0.8142,0.773,0.123,0.104,0.5193333333333333

2010-05-03,4.0,"Lovely. From the second you pull open the door of this neighborhood place, Aldino's will impress. I loved the warm greeting we received as we walked in and the cozy booth for two we were seated in.  There are actually two restaurants here- the more casual Aldino's Market serving up Sicilian pizza, sandwiches, and salads to eat along with a small grocery where you can purchase, cheeses, pastas, and other dried goods. There are a few tables indoors and a lively outdoor patio on which to enjoy your food.  But this review is for Aldinos- the casual Italian restaurant that delivered on it's promise of Italian comfort food the other night. The ambiance here is warm with dark old woods, cream colored booths lining the walls and wooden tables and chairs. In between the restaurant and the market is the bar- with glass globes twinkling above and a friendly bartender.  There are a few daily specials but you should be able to find your favorites on the everyday menu. We ordered the appetizer of calamari and shrimp served with a lemon aiolii sauce, the pappardelle with bologenese and the veal with asparagus. We also split a side of the crispy potatoes with chilis and herbs that packed just enough heat to make them interesting.  The food was terrific with each course beautifully timed. We shared all the dishes (plenty to share unless you want to take leftovers home) and our bill with drinks was only around $85. Valet parking is also available out front or $6 (by a very friendly and helpful valet)  Our server was a little unsure on the night we were there. Having been open only 5 weeks- she may have still been on a learning curve but she didn't know the menu as well as she should have and we had to flag down the ""bread guy"" for some of their tasty foccacia bread on our own.  All in all a lovely experience. And as their website states- this is the kind of restaurant that everyone is going to want at the end of their block. Comfort food in a warm environment?

2010-04-30,4.0,"I checked out this restaurant with my husband and friends a few weeks after it opened and I'm dying to go back!   Is it the best Italian I've ever had?  No. Does it beat out top places in the city like Cibo Mato? YES!  I was interested in this place for a few reasons.  A) heard great reviews from one of the sous chefs who has worked at a few other of my favorite places in the city and  B) I love Purple Pig so jumped when I saw another Scott Harris restaurant.  With that said I probably went in a little biased however the grilled octopus and wine list wholeheartedly won me over. Our table started off with Pecorino Cheese Rolls, the Grilled Octopus and the Ribollita.  The Ribollita was so-so but this was the only thing of the night I wasn't head over heels for.  The grilled octopus was extremely flavorful and as it is my favorite menu item at Purple Pig I was expecting similar flavors but they are very different.  The octopus at Aldino is a little more refreshing and mild in flavor.   For a main course I had the Squid Ink Chitarra which was WONDERFUL.  I've seen other reviews where this was only deemed average but my husband and I have recently been to Italy and this was very similar in taste/texture to a dish prepared for us there.   This restaurant is perfect for both a romantic evening and a large group so you can't go wrong!",0.9918,0.812,0.177,0.011,0.5518759018759017
2010-04-28,5.0,"As a neighborhood resident who used to live down the street, I was so excited to see Aldino's opening up where the short lived Johnny D's used to be and the long standing La Scala was. I went with my husband, another couple and a small child. Now the atmosphere isn't what I usually would have called 'child friendly' but the staff was wonderful. As a parent to an older baby, I was completely at ease. (now mind you we came on a Tuesday night not a Fri/Sat, and our child was very well behaved) The staff were very attentive, explained everything on the menu and gave us wonderful beer suggestions (we're not much for wine).  THE FOOD! Oh the wonderful food! for appetizers we had the special for the night of sausage & polenta, bruschetta and veal meatballs which were all amazing. The bruschette was sweet (apples) and salty (pancetta) and amazing. A different take on bruschette but wonderful. The sausage & meatballs were very tender and flavorful. A wonderful start.  Our table had the pork shoulder, veal, baked cannoli & asparagus ravioli. Each entree was flavorful, but our table favorite was the pork shoulder for its tenderness and the veal was a close runner up. I had the aspargus ravioli with lemon cream sauce which was light and airy, a perfect summer dinner.  For dessert, our server brought the house made lemoncello which was out of this world! I'll definitely be buying a bottle when the market opens (I believe today). And we had the chocolate hazelnut cake which again was delightful.  The surprise of the evening was the children's plate. Now I know that most yelpers don't care about a children's meal, but as a mom, I do. I was expecting the usual frozen chicken fingers that most places serve. However, our server brought out the most tender flavorful hand breaded chicken fingers I've ever had. Luckily my child didn't eat them all so we shared them with the table. An unexpected delight!

2010-04-11,3.0,"I was excited to check out Aldino's for various reasons.  Chef Zanella, well known local Italian chef and protégé of Peter Merriman (whose restaurant I had the pleasure of visiting in Maui); restauranteur Scott Harris, owner of the Mia Francesca empire and other concerns; and of course, the promise of a lot of pork.  The restaurant is housed in an old-world rustic space with simple interiors.  The room had a soft glow and while there was a crowd and the atmosphere bustling, you can still hear your companions and have decent conversation.  Reminds me a bit of Francesca's, but a little more grown up. The menu promises regional Italian dishes from all over.  In concept, it is similar to what Anteprima or Ricardo's Trattoria offers.  We went there hungry, and decided on 2 antipasti, one primi to split, and 2 secondi.  The Roasted Beets, Farro, Pistachio, Yogurt, and Mint is a typical preparation, but the farro gave it a very interesting nuttiness and texture.  The yogurt too is pleasant, and lighter than the usual goat cheese in this type of dish.  The Fritto Misto was a tangle of fried calamari and shrimp, in a lemon caper aioli.  Of all the dishes we tried, this was the let down.  It was not bad, just uninspiring.  The fried calamari at Francesca's is my absolute favorite anywhere, and this doesn't measure up.  The breading was too thick for my taste, and the texture of the squid was just so so.  On to the Swiss Chard Gnudi, Brown Butter, Tomatoes.  This dish quickly erased the memory of the fried seafood.  The gnudi was done a little differently than usual.  There was a thin layer of dough enveloping the tasty mixture of chard and cheese.  It reminded me of Japanese mochi balls, except egg-shaped, with a very thin dough.  The accompanying tomato sauce was perfect.  For our secondi, I had the Lemon/Milk braised Pork Shoulder and Polenta Verde, and my partner got the last one of the night's Porchetta.  I have made Marcella Hazan's milk braised pork at home numerous times.  At Aldino's, adding lemon peel to the braise gave it a new layer of pop.  The Porchetta was stuffed with a house made fennel sausage, and the whole huge slice was quickly seared before serving.  It was a symphony of textures.  Crispy but also chewy skin, meat the feel of cooked ham, and pungent punches of the sausage throughout.  Despite being such a rustic dish, it had a mild finish that was very elegant.  This dish seemed to have been on special, but to my mind, should be on the regular menu. Interesting dessert options, including a lemon cream filled Bombolini (Italian doughnuts), but we decided on liquid dessert instead.  The house-made Fig-infused Grappa just sounded too intriguing to pass up.  It did not disappoint.  I LOVE grappa and I'm always interested when restaurants try to modify it.  This version definitely tempers it.  After the grappa hits you, there is the lingering taste of fig newtons that smoothed things out. For libations, we tried the 2008 Alois Lageder Pinot Bianco.  Very clean and dry, a sharp contrast to the richness of the pork dishes.  The wine list was quite reasonable.  Service was very good, a little overwhelmed as they were dealing with Saturday night prime time rush.  The host, who also worked double duty as wine steward and house manager, took time to talk to us about wine selections, while keeping an eye at the door.  All in all, a good, casual neighborhood place. Why 3 stars?  Well, for now.  This is my first visit, and they have only been opened a month.  I mentioned Anteprima and Ricardo's Trattoria above, and if i have to compare, Aldino's is not quite there yet.  It is a nice neighborhood place if i live in the area.  It could also be a pre or post event option since it is sort of across the street from UIC Pavilion.",0.9971,0.865,0.119,0.017,0.519445088961218

The wine list and menu are not as extensive as some Italian restaurants but I like the fact that they don't try to be everything to everyone.   I also like the fact that the menu is interesting and authentic and the various dishes are reasonably priced. Dinner for two, even with wine, won't break the bank.  We've sampled two of their wines by the glass and were very pleased with the quality of the wines for the price. We also had a bottle of wine (medium priced bottle) and found it excellent. The portion size for the appetizers is large enough that you can easily share. I recommend the octopus with blood oranges, the frito misto (calamari and shrimp) and the escarole salad with apples and hazlenuts. For an entree, my husband had the arctic char and thought it was very nicely done. The risotto I had (with seafood was the special that evening) was absolutely perfect and I tend to be a tough critic of most risotto preparations.  On our first visit I had a rigatoni dish (not currently on the menu) and my husband had the agnolotti (similar to ravioli) with winter squash. We were impressed with both, particularly since they had only been opened a week at that point.

The friendliness and helpfulness of the staff seemed to go above and beyond what would be expected even from a new restaurant trying to please it's customers. Our waiter really took the time to explain to us the chef's dishes, which they clearly had a lot of pride in. The chef himself also even came out to talk to some of the tables. First off, I was impressed by how much of a variety their menu had. Usually Italian restaurants in Little Italy stick to traditional dishes and don't range far from that, but his menu really had some great selections to choose from. Our table got the artic char, brown butter squash ravioli, stuffed cannelloni, and the braised beef. All of them were excellent dishes, no joke! The creamy polenta that came with the beef was the best I've ever had, the artic char was delicious, and the the squash ravioli was delicately prepared. Even the stuffed cannelloni, a fairly standard dish, had some great flavors that we didn't expect. We then finished off the meal with some Italian Fig Grappa, a hard drink, but wow was it infused with so much fig flavor.  Finally you can't beat the great bar they have right inside. They have some excellent microbrewery beers on tap, and the bartender even gave us some samples to help us choose!  Without a doubt we will be back, and I look forward to their little Italian deli and market they'll be opening next door (which they proudly gave us a tour of after our meal).",0.9968,0.751,0.225,0.024,0.49567408781694494

For an appetizer we ordered the goat cheese bruschetta. It came out as one piece of bread cut in half. The cheese was not as flavorful as I would have liked and it was boring. For our entrees my boyfriend had the braised calamari, which was delicious and very similar to a wonderful dish they have at Piccolo Sogno. Aldino's version of this dish was smaller and did not have as much seafood. I ordered the Arctic Char, which was tasty, but undercooked. I didn't eat the half of the fish that was raw and had a weird bloody texture. Grossed me out. After our waitress took our plates she came back and said the Chef wanted to know if everything was OK with the fish and she went on to explain that you can under-cook Arctic char, like salmon.
