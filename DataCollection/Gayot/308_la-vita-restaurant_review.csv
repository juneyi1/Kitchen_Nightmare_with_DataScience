2009-08-07,3.0,It was ok. Apps (grilled calamari and brusetta) were bland. Dinner was better but still not nearly as good as I hoped for.  I loved the atmosphere and the decor just wish the food was as good.,0.8635,0.559,0.317,0.124,0.638888888888889
2009-08-05,3.0,"I thought, just ok...as a disclaimer, the rootop was not open which could make a difference. I'll start with the good - place was nice, all the open air (however, they sat us in the back with no open air...), the beef carpaccio was excellent and the veal marsala was as good as I've tasted. The bad - the grilled calamari was really poor - tasted as if it had been cooked in burnt oil - flat out was bad...i tried the chilean sea bass which was sub par, especially for $28. 2 ppl had the tilapia which they enjoyed. I was a little annoyed the bus boys kept grabbing our plates without asking if we were done (1 time we still had an app in the middle of the table but they swooped in and took all our plates away!). We were enjoying the nice atmosphere (Fri night, place about 1/3 full) until one big party sat in the middle and they were being obnoxiously loud. The fact that the restaurant never said anything led to us departing much earlier and proably spending less than we would have. Combine that with after our main course the waiter asked ""anything else I can do?"" - no dessert menu, nothing...Overall, menu was hit or miss, service sub par, place could have been nice but they need to manage their patrons in such an intimate place. I would possibly go back but is not at the top of my list by any means",0.8751,0.833,0.099,0.068,0.5206989247311827
2009-06-16,4.0,"What a pleasant surprise La Vita was! I thought I had eaten at every place in ""Little Italy"" until a friend turned me on to La Vita.  Not your typical ""old school"" Italian restaurant. It's clean, contemporary decor was reminiscent of sitting in a stylish bar in Italy. The curved bar, the windows open to the the street, the rooftop patio, the open kitchen area, all were just a prelude to the main star of the night . . .and that was the food!  We were there on a Monday so we pretty much had the place to ourselves. The menu is northern Italian cuisine and offers a wide range of choices.  We started with a couple of appetizers- the grilled calamari and the scallops with asparagus and Gorgonzola cheese. Both were good but the scallops were the clear winner. What a unique combination of flavors!  As for entrees- I went with the sea bass with tomatoes and spinach (perfecto!) and my friends had the rib eye served  with Gorgonzola butter and roasted potatoes and the lamb chops. Not only did they look good- I was able to sneak a little taste and they were both delicious!. We also split the capellini con scampi as a side dish. Light and delicious with tomatoes, spinach and just the right amount of garlic.  We had a couple of service glitches which is what kept this from being a perfect review (drinks prepared incorrectly, foreign object in glass, and a server who acted like he really didn't know the menu). But they did comp us a tiramasu to make up for it (and it was delicious!)  Parking on a weeknight is easy- pay at the box (it only takes quarters, though so be prepared) Or there is valet parking on most nights shared with Francesca's across the street.  Sitting by the windows- letting the cool air blow across my face as I sipped my cocktail and reflected on the dinner I had just had- I had a flashback to a night in Rome . . . .but that's another story for another day.  La Vita means ""the life"". And on that particular night, we were living it!",0.9948,0.847,0.148,0.004,0.5671679197994987

Still  La Vita - not as ""dolce"" as it was for Fellini in 1960 - did a pretty good job at hitting my sweet spot tonight. In the most unpretentious, straight-forward of ways. No chichi, no fancy. Just a good hearty meal with big flavors: - warm and crusty bread - grilled artichokes hearts and jumbo shrimps in a light lemon-garlic sauce - risotto al quattro formaggi (no translation. You can do it), spinach and grilled chicken........a world of creaminess. A perfect bite to the rice. - vitello marsala e linguini ""al dente"". Lots of mushroom. A great marsala taste. - capuccino  - the best I've  had in a very long time. Italian size. Perfect. Sometimes I crave simplicity.

2009-03-14,1.0,"A truly bad experience! Dh and I went here for an anniversary dinner last night based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews on Yellp and I was so disappointed.  First off, we were seated near the back where there was a party of 30+ people. After another group of 8 was seated nearby we asked to move closer to the front of the room which was a little quieter. We could barely hear ourselves talk. Hardly the quiet, intimate atmosphere I was hoping for! Service was sub-par. We received our wine quickly and ordered an appetizer. Bread did not appear until at least 10 mins. later - it proved to be disappointing. It was right out of the oven but was more toast than bread. Not a good omen. Next, came our eggplant appetizer - 3 very small rolls of eggplant filled with mascarpone cheese & spinach. The fresh tomato sauce was tasty but the eggplant was undercooked and the filing tasted like spinach dip. After another long wait, our entrees arrived. I asked for more bread hoping) it wouldn't be so toasted this time) and it never materialized. I was not impressed with my entree and was only able to eat a few bites. I ordered farfalle pasta with proscuitto and mushrooms. The bowl contained a congealed mass of bowtie pasta with tiny flecks of Prosciutto and a few mushrooms. The ""light cream sauce"" was heavy and flavorless.  DH liked his pork chops vesuvio served with potato wedges and peas better but I was so fed up at that point that I did not care to share with him. There was no concern that I barely touched my food - I was just asked if I wanted the food boxed. Overall, a very unsatisfying experience all around. Given the number of excellent restaurants in that area I would avoid La Vita and recommend others do the same. In this economy, businesses should be more concerned with the experience customers are paying for.",0.9158,0.832,0.101,0.067,0.4571423292155

Hanging out there with a few of Chicago's cutest ladies and sharp dressed guys, we spent a few hours in this amazing small yet cozy place. it easily has the best italian food in the city, while dinner and wine was great and at a very reasonable price for 6 of us.

2009-02-03,4.0,"4.5 / 5 stars. Two friends and I dined here later on a Friday night for the first time, and found the restaurant's decor very pleasing and intimate. It wasn't too busy--about 4 or 5 other tables were full, but that was no indication of the quality of the experience. As assumed, you are seated with hard-crusted loaves of bread and seasoned olive oil (very good). The service was very good and accommodating; I requested pasta as a side, at the expense of roasted potatoes and vegetables. Not a problem. The food was excellent. We each ordered different dishes, all of which stood out (CHICKEN MARSALA, RIGATONI CON SALSICCIA, POLLO CREMA DI BRANDY). Great, rich flavors in each dish. Portions are very generous, which made lunch the following day nearly as pleasant as the dinner the evening before.

The decor of the place is not as glam hut it's still really nice and even better in the summer when the ceiling to floor windows open while you enjoy your meal with a date.  The pasta here is by far the best pasta in the city. I recommend the chicken and broccoli Alfredo pasta dish, it is delicious or the lemon chicken w/ veggies. The olive oil and bread were awesome starters and frankly if you have a great date that may be all you need depending on your appetite. The owner is usually there when you walk in and the waitresses are just great. Although I could see if there were a large party how there could be possible problems.  Overall, the food is GREAT, the service is good, but the atmosphere is tranquil and peaceful.

I went with a large group for a holiday function and there were 50 of us with two to three waiters. It is unusual to have a party of 50, but it was still real disappointment. The service was bad, of course - how could they keep up with 50 people? The food was late, it took an hour to get the salad. When we got the food, some items were great, such as the pasta, and other items were really not great. I was pretty disappointed in the food overall.

My Capellini con Scampi was good, but not stellar. The mushroom ravioli was very tasty, as was the Farfalle con Prosciutto. And the Carciofi con Scampi was also good.
