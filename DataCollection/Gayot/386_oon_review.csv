2013-12-06,4.0,"Serendipity. It means both luck and a desirable discovery by accident. Yes, it is also a movie, but with OON, for me, it was the full translation.  My friends and I happened here by happenstance. We originally were at Maude's, but found out that they had changed their corkage policy to 1 bottle per 2 people. See, that just doesn't work with us as we like to open a lot of bottles and enjoy said bottles. So, we did have 2 bottles at Maude's, but we still had to find a place for more eating as we did have a specific dinner planned. And, out of that, we came upon OON. While our group of 4 had devoured a seafood tower at Maude's, we were still in need of food. So, we started off with the spring rolls, potstickers, and octopus. I really really liked the spring rolls. The spice was perfect and the spring rolls were pretty damn big too. The potstickers were also very good. They had a good amount of meat in them and the dumpling itself was excellent. The octopus was a bit chewier than I'd like it, but I will also say that I'm not normally a fan of octopus. The two main meat dishes our group munched on were excellent. The Kalbi short rib was a personal favorite for me. I absolutely loved the sauce with this and the ribs were really tender. My excitement for the short ribs shouldn't downplay how damn good the lamb loin was. The lamb was done perfectly and I loved the complexity of the flavors.  The service here was fantastic as well. Sure, it was a tuesday night, but our waitress rocked it. She was always there when we needed something and was great to deal with on the whole.  OON was a great find for us. We didn't expect to come here, and that's usually when the best things happen. On top of it, they were only $10 per bottle and that is a fantastic corkage price on the whole, much less on Randolph. I can't for my next return visit.",0.9989,0.694,0.279,0.027,0.5945760233918128

My wife and I split the Scallops, Short Ribs and Pot Stickers and found all of them to be well prepared and brimming with flavor. The desserts were probably our favorite part. We ordered the donuts and the Pana Cotta and both were delightful without being overbearing. The Chef/owner, Matt, came out and asked us to try something he was thinking about adding to the menu, a Bread Pudding. While typically not something I would ever order, it was the highlight of the night. Fantastic flavors were everywhere.

2013-11-08,4.0,"I was impressed with Oon.  I am usually a little nervous about asian fusion places.  I find that most places that themselves asian fusion places are a little too in your face asian or they take chinese dishes and dress them up and just charge more.  Oon infuses asian influences in their dishes, but without being too overpowering and without just enough asian touches to keep you intrigued.  I went to Oon with two my girlfriends after work on a Thursday night.  There were only a few tables dining there when we arrived but I was pleased to see what a cozy and warm place it was, while also being a pretty modern and neat space. We ordered the eggplant, papaya salad, trout, octopus, lamb, and steak dishes.  The octopus was a little overcooked than I would have preferred but I love the juxtaposition of the roasted strawberry wheatberries and deep fried little balls of chorizo that came with the octopus.  The papaya salad was refreshing with a hint of fish sauce and mint.  We all were glad we had gotten that over the green beans.  The eggplant was nicely braised with a little drizzle of coconut sauce.  It was a little on the sweet side, but since I had a sweet tooth, I really like it.  Just be warned that if you don't like sweet dishes..this may not be the dish for you.  The trout, lamb, and steak dishes all were cooked beautifully.  The lamb was medium rare and not gamey at all.  I love the caramel butter sauce that came with the lamb.  All of the flavors really just came together.  Our waiter was really nice and came back and checked on us regularly.  (Not sure if that would have been the same if it would have been more crowded but I hope not!)  We ended our meal with the banana chocolate cake.  The cake was ok, but I really like the combination of peanut butter sauce and passion fruit drizzle that came with our cake.  All in all, we were pretty pleased with our dishes and we were just surprised that the place was not more packed given the great service and food that we just had!",0.9985,0.759,0.232,0.01,0.5462018140589568
2013-11-07,5.0,"This is a newish restaurant on Randolph restaurant row featuring asian fusion cuisine.  It has a very sleek, minimalist design  with dark wood two tops that are reconfigured to accommodate different sized groups.  Bright modernist paintings are the only splash of color and are hung on what appears to be acoustic panels on the walls.  I am guessing these are acoustic panels because you can actually talk to those you are dining with, probably a first in this neighborhood.  The tables weren't squashed together either, something else that is a welcome change from many of the new restaurants around.  The menu is small, I would guess a maximum of about twenty items, evenly divided between small and large plates.  We each had a small plate as an appetizer and a large plate as an entree.  Others around were making a meal of the small plates so you can do whatever appeals to you.  There is also a large beverage menu that includes cocktails, wine, beer, sodas, specialty teas and coffee.   The food is described as asian fusion.  I have seen several waves of fusion food, most of them an unfortunate experience.  The food here really does manage to fuse western classic cuisine with asian presentation and spicing.  Neither of the elements dominate finished dishes, which is not easy to do. I ate the octopus small plate as an appetizer; it was charred on a bed of wheat-berries with strawberry sauce.  This sounds like a weird combo but was beautifully balanced, and no the strawberry sauce wasn't sweet.  I then had loin of lamb with vanilla mashed potatoes, cherry sauce, rapini and picked onions (the onions were a fresh pickle, very finely sliced).  This was delicious.  My friend loved her scallops.  We ended with desert and I had yuzu panna cotta which I loved; this is a very tart citrus flavoring but if you like that sort of thing you will love this.  My friend ended with a chocolate layer cake which she eat every last crumb.  We finished with a pot of french press coffee. My panna cotta came decorated with a candle, as this was a birthday outing for me.  As we were drinking our coffee we were handed little parcels of spicy peanut brittle because it was ""someone's birthday"".  I was surprised to see it was the Chef/Owner himself handing it out.  I recommend that everyone support this restaurant; it is run by a very young, local chef who is turning out beautifully done food!",0.9955,0.826,0.146,0.028,0.4813391053391054

I sipped on a Porcupine.  I don't remember exactly what was in it but it was a potent little cocktail and quite tasty. I started with the Chilled Udon served with a yuzu soy dashi crab shiitake mushroom and chili lime vinaigrette.  The dashi was delicious.  the crab kinda disappeared for me. the dish as a whole lacks a little salt but was a good size for a starter. As an entree i had the scallop with white polenta, bok choy, blueberry, cocoa nib and almond.  The flavors all worked.  The scallops had a nice sear on the outside and weren't over cooked.  The blueberry and cocoa nib added a nice compliment to the sweetness in the scallop without overpowering its subtly.  The polenta was absolutely divine.  Plating was a little sloppy but flavor was on point. Went all the way and got the yuzu panna cotta for dessert.  This was the highlight for me.  There was such a nice citrusy tang to the panna cotta and the sesame brittle added just the right crunch and savory aspect to pull the whole thing together.  I'm generally not a huge dessert person but I would go back JUST for this dish again.",0.9926,0.814,0.166,0.02,0.5607142857142857
2013-10-14,4.0,"Oon snuck up on me.  My fiance and I were just looking for a fun new restaurant to go on a long awaited date night and that week I received an email from Oon informing me that they were running a 50% off bottles of wine special in October.  I vaguely remembered signing up for their email list back before they had opened because it sounded like a nice addition to the Chicago playing field.  So we made a reservation for last Friday night and went in for dinner with no expectations. The atmosphere is nothing spectacular - fairly typical for any nicer modern restaurant in the downtown.  It fits right in on Randolph's Restaurant Row.  The service was fine - very friendly, very attentive.  I know there have been some complaints in previous reviews, but we didn't experience any of those.  The restaurant was full, but not overly packed, so I liked that no one was trying to rush us out the door to make way for the next party.   Ironically, we went to Oon because of the wine special, but we ended up ordering cocktails based on our mood.  The cocktail list is ok - we are bourbon people, and there were limited whiskey based options.  The cocktail menu is very gin heavy, so if you're a fan of gin, you'll love the booze. The food.  The food was delicious.  Our server recommended 2 small plates and 2 large plates for 2 of us, but we were pretty much full after the amuse bouche and the 2 small plates.  We only finished half of the one large plate (thankfully we didn't order a 2nd large plate).  So be aware that the portions are quite generous, especially for the small plates. The amuse bouche was delicious - some sort of fried bao type of bread with an excellent accompanying dipping sauce.  We started with the short rib and grilled octopus small plates.  My fiance knows meat more than I do, and he said it's quite possibly the best short rib he's ever had in his life.  I certainly couldn't argue because it was full of flavor, not too dry and perfectly grilled.  The grilled octopus was also excellent.  Though I prefer my octopus with just a little more of a charred flavor, the bed of wheatberries that it came on was the right complement. For our entree we went with the roasted pork belly fried rice.  Kind of a bibimbop type of dish with an egg over easy on top and brussel sprouts coated in a sweet charred heaven.  The pork belly was phenomenal - roasted through on the outside, but melts in your mouth on the inside. We were not expecting cuisine this enjoyable.  If anything, I figured we'd enjoy the meal and forget about it.  The atmosphere and the service were fine, but not necessarily memorable.  But the food.  The food is memorable.",0.9988,0.759,0.219,0.022,0.5492752197297652

It was pretty empty when we first sat down, however it became busier as the night progressed proving this place is worth it and people know it. We had the mussels for an appetizer. Amazing coconut and red curry sauce but what made us so very very happy was the fried bao that came with it to dip in the mussels sauce. The fried bao actually tasted like a mix between a warm salty pretzel and the sweet fried dough you get at a fair. It was so good that we requested more fried bao which we saved for our dessert. We shared the lamb for our entree which was amazing too. A bite that included the perfectly cooked lamb, spicy rapini and vanilla mashed potatoes was heavenly. We wanted to lick the plate with our fingers to get every last drop of sauce but decided to act like we had manners. Overall, great food, drinks and service.

2013-10-06,2.0,"Overrated, Overstaffed, iNsipid When you wait over an hour, at a hardly crowded restaurant, it merits either a reasonable explanation or terrific fare to make the wait worthwhile - at OON, neither holds.  An army of staff seems to float around doing this and that, but without any real efficiency or effectiveness - how many people does it take to wait a table?At OON, it's one to fill glasses of water, one to get the bao (the redeeming dish of the night), one to take the order, another to bring it, a few reminders to the bunch of them to get the check (cos we had no idea who our server was amongst the lot!) and a new face ended up bringing the check afterall! One too many cooks in the kitchen. The menu is hardly inspiring - less so to a vegetarian. The small plates are large and the large plates are - well, if you request a sans-meat variation, they are small! So it was, that I ended up forking 14 bucks for a small serving of coconut ginger rice sprinkled with mushroom, and a few specks of spicy sriracha providing plate decoration - and it only took about an hour for them to craft this rather non-creative side dish framed as a main course.

It's a contemporary fusion asian food but the food isn't really all that impressive and inspiring, let's just set the expectation at that.

Hence, at a higher end asian restaurant, vs. a kalbi dish from a mom-and-pop place. Octopus...it's good, but i like the grains that it comes with more than the actual octopus. It's nothing unusual, the grains, however, soaked up some of the flavour, so it's tastier. Chilled udon...it's probably the best dishes of the night. The udon was bouncy and the whole dish just really well put together Pork loin...Nice presentation, and it didn't taste that heavy even though it's all meat. But i don't taste any betel leaf which i would expect when the meat is wrapped in the leaf and grilled. Scallop...another ordinary dish that you could get at any higher end asian place.

What I liked was the dishes still had flavors which was familiar for both Asians and non-Asians. The prawns still had the heads and tails. We actually eat the head which is crunchy and slightly charred. The short ribs used Maggi soy sauce which was a delight. I wanted to try the Foie Pho. Interestingly, they used the same method by which the hot broth poured on top to cook the meat. Here it was duck where the original would have been thinly sliced beef. The dish was light, flavorful and decadent with the Fois Gras.  My company ordered the quail. The house made Sriracha was a nice touch and added the heat to the dish. The quail was tender and seasoned well and complimented the coconut-ginger rice. We left Oon satisfied but not overly filled. The dishes were  modern, well presented and seasoned.

While the name of the place apparently conjured in him thoughts of hypnotic house music, to me it evokes more placid images of silver light and meditation, on the ooommmm side of the spectrum. I won. Well, in part. The noisy chatter of businessmen free to mingle for the night replaced the loud thumps of music, and I was left to enjoy the very unsavory spectacle of networking at its worst for the first 30 minutes of our meal. Think suits, forced smiles, awkward attempts at seduction and the like. Fortunately enough, it didn't cut my appetite short. I even allowed myself a drink, a rare treat of late thoroughly enjoyed by my whiskey-loving taste buds.  And I dug in. The tempura asparagus were exceptional, lightly coated in a corn meal batter that paired perfectly with the tangy black pepper and butter dip sauce on the side. A true highlight. The prawns glimmered under a luscious togarashi glaze; the scallion puree was a welcome light counterpoint, and the slightly candied slices of kumquat, a great surprise for the tongue. I longed for just one more. Or two. The chilled udon, while rightly served by a rich umami broth enhanced by earthy mushrooms and delicate crab meat, was too thick and chewy to be totally enjoyable. The octopus was on the ""over"" side of the charred, and the smoked strawberry brought a surprising note to a dish whose best element was the bed of wheatberry. Same observation for the barbecue tofu: the corn bao totally stole the show. Complex flavors and great texture - it could almost stand alone. Desserts were forgettable. But I am picky with my sweets.

Rack of Lamb: The meat was cooked perfectly - probably the best lamb we've had in years.  The sauce was delicious.  Again, though, the broccoli rabe on the side tasted like it had been stuck in open flames.  It was partially black and charred.  When we told the waitress, she brought out an extra side of it and I thought it tasted much better while my husband thought it was too bitter. Dessert: Chocolate Banana cake: Our waitress described this as ""decadent"".  That's pretty accurate.  However, it was served with a thai peanut creme and fruit sauce. There was so much going on that you couldn't taste the cake. Each component was individually great, but you lose the banana flavor when mixed all together.  I would have preferred no fruit sauce and a slightly lighter peanut sauce. Overall, this restaurant is a solid 3.5 stars, 4 stars when you take service and ambiance into account.  I honestly have no idea why Time Out had such a horrible experience, but it's not representative of the restaurant at all.",0.9982,0.683,0.261,0.055,0.611178861788618

Definitely do come for some good Asian ""fusion"" food and drinks.  Some stars of this show for us were the prawns, the cold udon and the BBQ tofu.  However, the headliner of the night was the tempura fried asparagus.  I don't know what it is about the 800 block of Randolph and creating kick ass green veggie dishes, but between the Green Beans at The Girl and the Goat as well as these crispy, succulent spears of ever-so-lightly battered tempura fried asparagus, I would never feel bad about going into either place just to order those two dishes with some drinks. My wife had a drink (apologies for not remembering the name) that was delicious.  Whiskey with a Thai chili syrup, and lemon juice.  Fragrant, and satisfying. For dessert, I enjoyed the panna cotta the most.  It was with purple shiso and yuzu, so it was definitely citrusy and light, but being the drunkard that I am, I couldn't help but notice it tasted to me like a dessert made of gin.  While that might sound gross, I can assure you it was delicious, and refreshing - a great end to a very nice meal.",0.9948,0.724,0.22,0.056,0.6528985507246375

The grilled octopus with wheatberries was light and flavorful with a smoked strawberry purée that could have overpowered the dish if served in any larger quantity. The pork belly summer roll was light but could have used a significantly larger amount of pork to make it stand out. A green papaya salad was fresh and flavorful but nothing out of the ordinary. Barbecue tofu with a kimchi coleslaw was not bland and had a moderate amount of spice. The grilled sea scallops had a light buttery texture, cooked perfectly. The polenta was a nice creamy contrast. Cocoa was nit noticeable. The pork roulade with purple Okinawa potato puree was average.

2013-07-21,5.0,"I had a chance to eat here over the weekend, and I wasn't very familiar with the restaurant going in- which could be the best way to experience a place like OON.  Loved the way the place felt. The large windows that showcase the front of the restaurant gave the place a really nice feel- it was clearly different than some of the other places on Randolph, where I sometimes feel are hiding something from diners with how dark it is inside their restaurants.  I was the first in my party to show up, so I took a seat at the bar and had the bartender make me a drink. I just told her I was still a little hung over and also not feeling great. I have to tell you, I loved it. The Toga Toga Toga was refreshing, while providing a nice kick at the end of each sip. Definitely a very unique drink, one that I will remember. I talked a bit about what she would eat- and she gave some really good advice about what to look for. It didn't matter though, because... Our party decided to order one of every little plate. (Don't judge us!) It was probably the best decision my friends could have made- We got to try many different tastes and flavor combinations. I started to type some of the standouts and just deleted the paragraph. Why? Because they were all really fantastic. Beautifully plated and the flavor impact of each bite was stunning. (Ok, after more thought my favorites were the octopus, the grilled short rib, and the mussels...that fried bread and broth is to DIE FOR.) My entree was the flank steak. I normally like my steak done medium, but I know that chefs usually recommend medium rare...so that's what I went with. I wasn't let down. We all shared little bites of all the dishes- and I think the lamb and the flank steak were some of the favorite entrees of our group. We also enjoyed the halibut, BBQ tofu, and the scallops.  I am in no way really a fine dining expert, but I have to tell you that I was really happy with the experience. My favorite part was talking a walk back towards the bathroom and peeking in the open kitchen. I watch a lot of cooking shows and I am always really interested in how kitchens work. The folks in the kitchen were welcoming, and made small talk while I was probably bothering them.  As I walked back from the restroom, I had a chance to thank Chef Matt as he was walking the room, and he later came by our table to ask us how everything was. I can tell you that I don't see that happen too often, and I was really surprised at the time he took to walk around the room and get a feel for how people were enjoying themselves.  Our server was exceptional. I really felt welcomed as if I was eating at a really good friend's place- who happens to cook 5 star level amazing food.  If you can, give OON a try.

Great first impression--clean, modern decor with some great pops of color. The wait staff was extremely friendly from the onset and continued to be attentive throughout the meal. We started with the Udon noodles and the papaya salad. Our waitress was kind enough to accommodate our dietary limitations (pescetarian) and asked the chef to make the Udon with smoked tofu instead of crab. These 2 appetizers were the standout dishes of the night. The Udon was obviously homemade and as tender as it gets. The broth packed tons of flavor and the smoked tofu ended up being a perfect component in the dish. The papaya salad was also outstanding--tons of bright, balanced flavors. Papaya salad is one of my favorite dishes to order in Asian restaurants and this was probably the best I've had in Chicago.  For entress we got the Halibut and the ""Foraged"" dishes. The halibut came with cauliflower and a zucchini puree. The fish was well-cooked and had a simple taste. The Foraged had all sorts of delicious vegetables (mushrooms, brussels, daikon) that has great flavor but I couldn't imagine filling up on that as an entire meal. Both entrees were tasty but didn't pack as much flavor as much as the appetizers. As expected, the portions were on the smaller size and the prices weren't inexpensive.  I'll definitely be back for the amazing Udon and Papaya salad. Also interested to try some more of their dishes.

We started with cocktails that were very creative. My fiance ordered a drink that had some cinnamon and creamy goodness going on and I was extremely jealous. My drink (Toga toga toga) was also very good, though. Nice level of complexity, which craft cocktails ought to have. We ordered the short rib appetizer, which was delicious. The preparation seemed flawless and the seasoning was amazing. Next, I had the halibut with some pureed cauliflower underneath and toasted coconut on top.

2013-07-09,5.0,"I heard of OON through a friend who went to college with chef/owner Matt Eversman. After urging me to like OON on Facebook, I followed the progress for the last year. I was delighted when they announced they were taking reservations for opening night! Youbettabahlieve I got my res in super fast.  My +1 is a super foodie who spends every other day in and around restaurant row, so she had high expectations. Were they met? Her words summed it up perfectly, ""In a month, this place will be amazing."" It was obvious when we stepped in the door that the kitchen was in the weeds - I saw almost no plates on any tables. Just drinks. Our food did take longer than it should to arrive. People were unsure of where to sit, stand, walk and there was some chaos and confusion between servers and diners. However, it was nothing epic or too distracting. It was all due to the fact that this was OPENING NIGHT. Keeping that in mind, it was a better experience than expected. The two of us ordered enough food for three. To start, the small plates of octopus, tempura asparagus, and spring rolls. I didn't try the spring rolls as they contained an item I'm allergic to, but I did try the octopus (my very first one!) and was pleasantly surprised that it didn't taste like a tub mat, suckers and all. So I'm not a good judge of the octopus, but I thought it was good. But the asparagus tempura was AMAZING. A star earned just for that dish alone.  The two main dishes we ordered were the pork remoulade and foie pho. Pork was amazing, and I would go back to OON just for that. But I'd also have to order the foie pho again. The broth was spicy, refreshing, delicious, and the noodles, meat, and foie gras absolutely melt-in-your-mouth perfect.  For dessert, I got the chocolate banana cake. It was probably large enough to share, but I didn't. Mine ALL mine! It was delicious and lighter than chocolate cakes usually are.  In short: I say YES you should go here. Be on time for your reservation, but be prepared to wait a sec. Be patient.

I cound'nt agree more with Teri , there wasn't a plate we had that said ""Oh yeah were coming back, and bringing friends"". Being a West Loop resident we have explored just about every dininig spot from Fulton to Jackson and Ashland to Clinton.  If there were half stars I would give 3.5 for effort.  Agreed on the octopus, nothing special and ours was also lacking an ingredient that we were informed was not playing well in the kitchen. They actually took this plate off the bill due to the wait.The short rib plate was tasty but nothing to make a special trip back for. The restaurant interior is clean draws a small comparison to Blackbird. The GM is very friendly and did stop by to say hello. I was a little disappointed not to see the chef doing some PR. At the time (530 pm Saturday) it was far from busy.Some highlights- A drink I really enjoyed.  Stroh boat to China (Id explain it as a not too heavy mix between a White Russian and a Oriental Express Martini) and the Chocolate banana bread with peanut creme .The chocolate bananna bread was drab but this peanut creme was delicious.

2013-07-04,3.0,"Argh, I feel terrible to be the first person to give a less-than-4-stars review for OON. But I just want to give an honest review. I have been following them on FB for months and my husband and I have been pretty pumped about our dinner there. Service: The hostess was very friendly and our server was great. Though in the beginning, when our server came over to give us a little spiel on the menu, it sounded very rehearsed. I understand they just opened less than a week, but it felt a little strange listening to someone talk like they had the whole intro memorized. Other than that, we've had very attentive service and she would come over to check on us periodically. The manager also came over once while we were looking at the drinks menu and he asked if we had any questions. Our server told us that their menu is contemporary American + Southeast Asian though after looking at the menu, we didn't see much Southeast Asian influences there. And now on to the food... Grilled octopus:  Good but not excellent. It was tender but wasn't moist, so it was almost bordering on a little dry. We thought the dish was supposed to have Chinese sausage in there (at least according to the menu), but only after we came home did we realize that we didn't see any Chinese sausage on there. The octopus was grilled with unagi glaze, so I'm not sure how is that Southeast Asian-inspired since that is more Japanese-inspired. Foie pho: This is a pretty neat idea and we liked the piece of thinly sliced foie gras that was in the bowl of pho. The broth was well spiced and it was pleasant to drink. It was a lot of broth and I'd say that the bowl was probably one-third noodle+ingredients and two-thirds broth. And then we waited 25-30 minutes for the rest of the courses below.... Lamb: We really liked that the lamb was prepared medium rare. The cut of lamb chops were great and we could see the layers of some fat surrounding the meat that helped to make the meat tender and soft. However, the tender texture of the medium rare lamb is the best part of the dish. Flavor wise, we couldn't taste anything on the meat itself. Back to the Southeast Asian inspiration that the restaurant is trying to achieve, we didn't really see how the lamb reflected that.... unless the amount of almost half a teaspoon of sambal that was drizzled on the side over the few pieces of vegetable leaves accompaniment was supposed to reflect that. And even so, the sambal tasted exactly like those from the Red Rooster jar. Quail: The quail was probably my favorite dish. I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of the qual and it was very well prepared. The deboned quail was served on a bed of coconut rice. The rice was very fragrant but I didn't really ""get"" the texture that they were trying to achieve. The rice was hard and gritty. We also had the doughnuts for dessert and they were enjoyable. We asked if they had sherry and our server said yes though she couldn't find it on the dessert menu. It's not on the drinks menu either so she went to the bar and then came back later with names of some of the sherry they carry. The decor here is minimalist and modern, nothing over the top. OON is supposed to be Southeast Asian inspired but in fact, some of their dishes (e.g. tempura asparagus, chilled udon) draw influences from Japanese cuisine and Japan is not Southeast Asia. We had a pleasant enough time but it wasn't an unforgettable meal as we didn't experience any ""wow"" to it.",0.9978,0.837,0.137,0.026,0.4813973063973064
2013-07-03,4.0,"I was here for the soft opening on Sunday.  I'm sure there will be many changes as time goes by.   This is a very ambitious endeavor!  I think it was stunning to see his progress and all of the love he put into it. Let's start with the decor.  Its a little sparse.  It needs something to warm it up.  Speaking of - we sat near the front window in the main seating and the A/C was blowing right on us.  My place is a loft so I know some seats just get blasted.  Just bring a sweater.  The table next to us had the same issue.  The tables are very close together.  I was ok but felt bad for the service.  If you're a NYCer then you're used to tight seating but some may find it to be too close.  The floors are slippery!  But beautiful.  I'm sure it'll wear down over time.  We thought they needed to install speakers throughout.  I could hear that music was on but not what it was.  The cocktail list, to me, was missing brown liquor.  Sad face!  I'm sure they'll add one in later.  They had everything else covered with gin, vodka, sake etc.  I tried the one with pineapple and gin and it was wonderful.  Nice balance and layered.  It went great with my starter.  My boyfriend tried the one with brandy.  He liked it at first but then got tired of it at the end.  The beer list and non-alcoholic drinks look great.  The wine list wasn't ready but I did have the chardonnay and it was wonderful.  Just a touch of butter and oak - the way I like it. The starters blew us away.  My boyfriend sweetly got the other non meat app so we could both try things.  I could tell he really wanted the octopus with chorizo!  I got the U-don with crab.  So good!  It had an unexpected spice but in a good way.  I'm a spice wimp so don't worry.  The noodles reminded me of spaetzle.   My boyfriend got the asparagus.  It was very lightly fried but the dipping sauce!  Oh my goodness that sauce needs to be bottled so I can buy it and put it on everything.  Its like a black pepper peanut sauce.  Daaang!  Our only complaint was that we wished there was more asparagus for the sauce. For the main my boyfriend got the lamb chops and gnawed every molecule of meat off of the bone.  Loved it.  I tried the halibut and it was just ok.  Perfectly cooked but the sauces were just there with no pep and the cauliflower seemed like an afterthought.  Maybe some curry would punch it up a bit.  The toasted coconut was nice crunch.   For dessert we tried the doughnuts which I thought were fantastic.  Perfectly cooked and nice sauces.  I had the chocolate cake and found it to be a little dry and it relied on the dipping sauces too much.  A good cake should do just find by itself!  But the frosting like schmear...again please bottle that so I can put it on everything. I can't comment too much on the service b/c I know they'll improve.  The water was always filled and my clean plates were picked up right away.  Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable.  The plates were slow to come out from the kitchen.  Its ok if you have a nice cocktail in front of you. I think this place will always be packed provided the prices are right.  They weren't on the menus so I don't know if its in line with other places like this.  The menu was nice and concise.  Maybe a little too meaty for me but I didn't go home hungry. I'll be back in a few months to really give it a try (if I can get in!)  So far so good.",0.9992,0.753,0.211,0.036,0.6068704418704419

The mussels were among the best I've had, and the scallop dish with polenta and almond is enough to bring you back to 802 W Randolph for lunch the next day. I had the pleasure of meeting Chef Matt Eversman. A genuine, young, talented chef who will undoubtedly WOW Chicago with consistency and creativity. I will be back to OON again...and again, and again. OON is here to stay. Enjoy.",0.9703,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.4338461538461538
2013-07-02,5.0,"The only visible Chef on the Randolph strip!  By socializing with diners, Chef Matt brings back the neighborhood feel into fine dining.  It's a pleasure to see you Matt. Fine ingredients executed with precision in harmony of taste and combination. PORK BELLY SPRING ROLL -- 2 slices of 2-4 bites each with perfectly laid out and wrapped ingredients. FOIE PHO -- fragrant broth with a perfectly one-sided sear of good portion foie gras.  Another portion of the perfect noodles would be appreciated.  PANNA COTTA ($8) -- premium yuzu ingredient.  Good value for $ as it serves 2.  The granola pieces are a delightful surprise and complementary to taste and texture. COFFEE -- by Dark Matter (the rockstar of Chicago coffee!).  Washed coffee for $5 serves 2 single cups.  The 3 choices alone keeps you coming back for more. Service -- 5-star including the assistants.  Knowledgeable, courteous and friendly with super duper faith in the goodness of mankind.  What a trooper!  Utensils are automatically replaced.  Clean up is quick with antibacterial wipes in between for crumbs. Table spacing is perfect!  Zen-like chair pullout as it is easy, flowy and without a snag or effort.  A table with a view of the Sears Tower is on the bar-side. I look forward to tasting the entire menu.",0.9962,0.721,0.271,0.008,0.634970238095238
2013-07-01,5.0,"Didn't know much about this place prior to being by a friend for the soft opening, but I was really impressed. Not sure about the other servers, but if you get Rafael, you won't be disappointed. Really friendly and knowledgeable guy.  Definitely get the short rib for an appetizer, and the halibut for an entree was SO good. I will definitely return to this place next time I head to Restaurant Row -- just a fun atmosphere (much more open and bright than the other places on Randolph...not that I don't like Au Cheval and Girl & the Goat). If I can't get a reservation I'll at least grab a drink at the bar.",0.9912,0.682,0.298,0.02,0.45994152046783626
2013-07-01,5.0,"Went here on the opening night with a friend.  First off, it definitely has the swanky west loop vibe to it.  Nice decor.  High ceilings.  Overall it's a cool looking place. We ordered the octopus for a starter.  It was good, even though I don't think I have a discriminating enough of a palate to completely enjoy it.  I ordered the quail for an entree.  I really liked it, especially the house sriracha sauce.   I didn't try the dessert, but I saw others eat the cake and the donuts.... which looked incredible. P.S. The drink list is 10 times longer than the menu",0.8671,0.861,0.139,0.0,0.6102777777777778
2013-07-01,5.0,"I had the privilege of dining at OON on Saturday night. I was anticipating greatness from what I heard about Chef Matt Eversman and the build-up of OON's mysterious opening. Needless to say, it was everything I thought it would be, and more. Upon arrival, I was greeted by an incredibly friendly host that seated my party immediately. She sat us in the middle of the dining room and our waiter, Tim, kindly walked us through the cocktail, wine, and drink menu. Our party began each with a different cocktail. Each was complex and delicious. It was quite apparent that OON's mixologists took much time and care in crafting each drink so uniquely. As soon as our drinks arrived, we placed our food order. For starters, my party ordered the Octopus and Short Ribs. Both items are a must have! The Octopus was fresh and light, and the Short Ribs melted off the bone. For our entrees, the table ordered the Quail, Lamb, Tofu, and Flank Steak. While an abundance of meat, each dish was crafted so elegantly, with a myriad of flavors and textures. I left the meal feeling satisfied and eager to return again.",0.9886,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.5921052631578947
2013-07-01,5.0,"Waiting a year for a restaurant to open could lead to great disappointment and woe.  To let you know: OON does NOT disappoint!!! Making my reservations for the grand opening via OpenTable, I was very pleased with my dining experience.  Lighting in OON offers great ambiance while the noise reverberated throughout making me know I was in the next up and coming fine dining West Loop bedrock. Never had I a Malort mixed with sake, but the Second City Samurai proved to be a tasty accompaniment with my starters.  Me and a friend opened with chilled udon that came with the bestest of sauces.  I normally am not a fan of cold appetizers but think twice and snag yourself chilled udon which I suspect should quickly become the most popular dish on the menu. Grilled octopus came with delightful hunks of fried chorizo while the wheatberry gave it a terrific texture.  I love nothing more than grilled octopus mixed an array of textures and flavors to make my day. Scallop to me can always be hit or miss but at OON you will no doubt bow down to their culinary mastery.  Served with white pomenta and almond you will first submit to its tenderness and let the pomenta and almond add both texture and deliciousness that will melt you away.   Moving on to dessert the chocolate banana layer cake was served up with a sauce to make you want to keep on eating.  The banana flavor is both a surprise however does not overwhelm.  Top all this off with a Tiger Beer and you will thank yourself for good decisionmaking. I can't wait to OON again!",0.9897,0.752,0.18,0.068,0.5100823045267491
