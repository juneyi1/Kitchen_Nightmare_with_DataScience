It was 100x worse!  The servers spilled water all over our table right when we sat down.  Usually I don't mind when stuff like that happens, but it foreshadowed the rest of our evening.  The service was so terrible.  A few friends joined us after we got our food, and as everyone was eating, we had to wait over 10 minutes for someone to come over and ask the newbies in our party if they even wanted a drink.  Their drinks took forever and their salads took over 25 minutes!!!!  OVER 25 MINUTES FOR SALAD.  Ridiculous.  It was NOT busy.  There were maybe 3 other tables in the restaurant being served.   After that they just started to ignore us completely and we saw a few workers standing around and talking in the back.  Could've stayed for more drinks but there was really no reason to at this point.   It's funny because I told a friend about this story and she said, ""Oh yeah, one time a waiter walked up to my table HOLDING AND EATING A TACO while he greeted us...""  Interesting customer service.",0.9128,0.752,0.151,0.098,0.4579841269841269

The taco salad was good, but nothing earth shattering.  I believe the girlfriend's description was something along the lines of ""about the same as you'd get at Qdoba or some place like that.""  I ordered the enchiladas with mole.  The chicken was very tender and cooked well, but the mole sauce was probably some of the best mole I've had outside of being over for dinner at my South American friend's house.  The guacamole was good, not great and the salsa had a nice kick to it.   We skipped the cocktails both for price reasons and it was Sunday dinner and didn't feel like running the tab up for them.  The atmosphere was alright, the restaurant was clean and kept well, but I just felt a sense of laissez-faire malaise.  Even though it's nice and close to us, I'll still prefer the walk to Que Rico.",0.992,0.779,0.203,0.019,0.575

Two of us sat at the bar for a half hour waiting for the remaining two and enjoyed great service, a good Mexican beer selection, and free chips and salsa.  The salsa, btw, is amazing and spicy and a very different texture than most restaurant salsas - like a thinned out tomato paste.  Sounds weird, but it's scrumptious. The menu isn't huge, but it's more creative than your standard Mexican place, while still having the standbys of enchiladas, tacos, and fajitas.  For an appetizer we had the queso fundito with chorizo, which was ok, but not at all what we were expecting.  The cheese isn't really melted, it's more the texture of baked brie.  It tasted good, but was hard to eat as a table appetizer. Prices are reasonable - $10 for an appetizer, $13 for a basic dish, $18 for a special dish.  I would definitely go back.",0.9836,0.779,0.186,0.035,0.5246181199752628

The most frustrating thing of all is that the food is actually very good.  A little pricey, but also a little upscale with flavor.  I had the steak tacos and they were perfect.  The queso fundido and guac were also excellent. . .unfortunately, I will never come back here to taste them again.  Yes, the service was that bad. . .and THAT slow.

2008-03-13,5.0,"This is an outstanding restaurant, newly refurbished and now with lunch hours. Tony, the proprietor and general manager, was there to great us. Apparently we were the first customers for their new lunch-time opening. This was all a surprise to us since we were coming from out of town (we are former Chicagoans returning to enjoy some old haunts and some new ones) and had only read about La Canasta on yelp. We assumed they would be open for lunch, not realizing it was only good luck that they were. The food here is excellent. I disagree with Julia M.'s characterization and would encourage her and others to go off the beaten path and try non-standard items on the menu. Or maybe the staff was having a tough day that day. The food lacks the generic taste that you get at just about any other restaurant that has some type of Mexican bend to it. The difference here is that his menu and recipes have a more Latin American mix to them. He has Mexican dishes, but I think that is more related to market dynamics. It is tough to explain to people what you stand for if you just say you are a Latin American restaurant. After all, there are lots of countries in Latin America. Therefore, the use of the term ""Grill & Cantina"" on their menu is probably a good one. Tony really focused on making the meal look, taste, smell, and feel like the most special meal your mom (or dad if that is the case in your family) ever cooked. I would describe it as the meal my mom put together when my future in-laws were coming to our home for the first time. It was a fantastic meal that made you want to stay longer and longer at the table. In addition, the sangria was stupendous. Unlike most other places it was not watered down and it had good fruit and wine aroma. If you want to eat great Latin American food, and have time to enjoy it, or want a some drinks with friends, I would highly recommend La Canasta.

The menu is very straight forward - standard Mexian fare along with a few Yucatan and seafood dishes. Nothing really jumped out at me, so I ordered the grilled shrimp - it was ok. My friend's carne asada plate was a better choice. My dinner came with a small salad, green tomatillo rice and a side of refried beans. Relatively healthy, due to the lack of dairy and basic preparation. Not something I was looking for - given my 200 calorie margarita, but a complimentary feature to an uninspired meal.

I was really looking forward to my meal at La Canasta, as I love Mexican food and though a neighborhood place was going to be perfect.

We ordered margaritas and guacamole to start.  The margaritas were decent, the salsa was good, the guacamole was not good.  And, for $9.00, I want it to be better than amazing.  Guacamole comes and it's 3 scoops in cabbage cups with romaine shreds around the place and cheese on top.  In short, it was too much stuff.  I just want the guacamole.  The guac itself was passable, but hardly delicious...there were red bell peppers in there!?! For entrees Brian got chicken with cheese in some sauce (not memorable) and I got chicken enchiladas which are hard to mess up.  The food was nothing special.
