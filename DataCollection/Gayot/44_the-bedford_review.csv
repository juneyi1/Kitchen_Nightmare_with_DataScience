2017-04-15,1.0,"The Bedford and its General Manager should hold itself and its staff members more accountable. The General Manager provided me with his business card as my party left his restaurant Saturday, January 28, 2017. As the General Manager requested, I followed-up on the concerns regarding the reservation and service. The concerns were as follows: (A) The reserved section did not accommodate 20 persons. The expectation was for 3 booths only 2 booths were reserved for our party of 20. (B) The one service attendant was not prepared for a party of 20 and neither was the management/staff. There should have been at least 2 servers for a party of 20. (C) The guests had to sit separately at the hi-top table for approximately 1.5 hours until the other party at the third booth finished their meal. (D) The drink service for premium open bar for two hours was not efficient or economical for my guests because only 1 server was assigned to the party and the party was split apart based on lack of promised reserved seating. (E) The tables were not periodically cleaned and cleared of glasses and plates until I requested someone remove the dirty dishes (more than one occasion). (F) The guest were not greeted and directed to the party. Many occasions I ran back-and-forth to check coats for guests and direct guests to the tables. (G) The employee who assisted in booking our reservation did not let me know she would not oversee the event. She left during the first 30 minutes of the party without introducing me to the General Manager or any other management. (H) The first four requests to speak with the General Manager were not obliged. I had to ask the hostess 3 times and a server one time before the General Manager came to the table to introduce yourself. (I) The accountability for not having 3 booths was lacking. The General Manager stated he did not promise 3 booths only 2 booths. The General Manager also stated you would check in with me at the end of the party to ""take care"" of the issues with billing and service.          (1) The General Manager did not check in with me or follow-up, even though I expressed to you the 'calamity of errors.'       (2) The presumption is and my memory recalls a 3 booth reservation is likely accurate because you did not even keep your word to follow-up when the bill arrived; and      (3) Nearly 3 months later, Bedford staff and management have not responded to direct mail, e-mail, or phone calls from me and my bank for the $1,730.43 horrible experience for a surprise birthday party. (J) The valet attendant was rude and sarcastic to the group of 60 year olds as they were leaving the birthday celebration, which escalated the prior poor service (listed above). The Bedford never responded to these concerns, which displays it does not appreciate its customers, even when they book an early $2000.00 party.

2017-04-04,3.0,"This was my first time at The Bedford and I was there for a birthday party. The venue was beautiful. Accents of the old bank vault really gave great character to the location. It was located in the basement sections and was definitely a nice place to have a party or a sexy date night. At a certain time the venue changed over from a dining location into a dance floor with a DJ, lights, and all. I want to say that happened around 11 p.m. The dance floor was moderately sized.  The menu selection is very specialized. Don't expect to be able to order chicken fingers and fries here. I ordered the Duck Confit Cassoulet. It was a well seasoned dish. The duck was salty, as it is supposed to be, the sausage was tender, and the herb crumbs were a nice accent taste! The meal was well prepared and according to my other table guests was a larger portion than most of the items on the list. Apparently, the other food option arrived in a more miniature portion than they had anticipated given the price point.  It was probably a bit too salty for my taste, but that's not a reflection of the preparation, but more of a personal preference. Nevertheless, I would recommend it! Perhaps with a sweetener of some sort (honey, balsamic glaze, etc.) the saltiness could be cut. If you are concerned I'm sure the waiter/waitress can provide some assistance.  Things to know:  1. Parking is crazy. There is valet. I believe the cost was upwards of $10. I rarely carry cash so I opted out of that option. I didn't ask if they could put it on a credit card so you may want to inquire about that. 2. Be careful of street parking because there are number spots for the residents who live near by and you don't want to get towed.  3. They do check IDs so have it ready.  4.

2017-03-10,4.0,"The Bedford is all about the vibe and the atmosphere. Food and service are secondary here. It's in the basement of an old bank from 1926, complete with a real vault door serving as the centerpiece and gateway to a swanky lounge area lined with lockboxes. The tunes echo the modern-vintage space, with a trip-hop/hip-hop instrumental playlist setting the tone. The dim ambience is interrupted only by the row of sleek fireplaces separating the dining areas.  Cocktails are rock solid, and $1 oyster Thursdays are a real treat. The food is not great, but it is good. Aside from the host/coat check gals, service can be oddly slow and awkward on even the deadest of nights. Rarely is this my final destination, rather a starting point for a night of drinks and conversation.

2017-01-31,3.0,"My actual rating is more of a 2.5 for this place, but I'll round up. The atmosphere is awesome - great date place to grab a drink. Located down the steps below street level, The Bedford is in the basement of an old bank, making it a super unique spot. The vault, security deposit boxes that line the wall, and the overall space is what makes this place pretty freaking cool. It's dimly lit making it intimate. I've been here for drinks and had reservations for dinner on one occasion. The night of drinks would have given this place 3 stars and the night of ""dinner"" would have given this place 2 stars - thus the 2.5 rating.  The night of drinks was on a weekday - the space was fairly empty (relatively speaking since the space is pretty huge) - but people were all by the main bar and that space was maybe a quarter full. While the cocktails were good, the service - even on a slow night, was slow (wait staff AND the bar).  We had dinner reservations a couple of weeks ago because I was excited to return to that ambiance, have more cocktails, and try their food! Our waitress was pretty miserable. She was not friendly, literally didn't crack one smile, and overall came off as someone who should not be in a position where she dealt with people all night. The cocktails were again good. The ambiance was also great. The food - well we only got through a few appetizers before realizing we were extremely underwhelmed and would rather spend our money on food we actually enjoyed and much better service. We had the burrata, which is usually my favorite wherever I go. There wasn't much to this one - small portion and what seemed like plain squad. The balsamic was basically just dotted around the plate and didn't add to any flavor on the dish. We also had the cauliflower fritters -basically unseasoned cauliflower in a bland batter, deep fried - very tasteless. The only good part was the chutney/sauce that came with it - actually delicious, but not enough to make the bland fritters worth the money or calories. The only app we kind of enjoyed was the mushroom volovant - the flaky pastry with the tasty mushroom mixture was pretty good. Seasoned well and actually had taste to it. However... overall, we were just unimpressed and decided that rather than continue to add to our bill with food that we weren't remotely impressed with, we were better off heading to a restaurant where we knew we would be satisfied and would have much better service (which we did... and we ended up enjoying our night much more after we left).  After my experiences, I would say go for the ambiance and cocktails, but maybe grab some food elsewhere and be prepared for slow service (and possibly unhappy employees).",0.9984,0.75,0.204,0.047,0.5822790807865434

2016-12-27,4.0,"Edited Review: I have been here many times in the last year and a half and have been a witness to the several iterations of this menu and the servers. I believe they are under new management and decided to revamp my review. Food: Steak tartar -- I have been on a quest for the best steak tartar in Chicago and although the Bedford offers a stand-up version it is, unfortunately, not the best (#1 Gilt Bar, #2 Maude's Liqueur Bar, #3 Cochan Volant, #4 Bedford, #5 Ada Street) I think that it is not lacking anything in terms of flavor, presentation, or quality, it just does not stand out. I will say that because I am in Wicker Park very often, it has become a ""staple"" steak tartar.   Cheese & Charcuterie Platter (Nut allergy alert!) -- This changes seasonally. It is very large and enough for at least 5 people. It is a very balanced board, we usually drink deep red wine with this (although our go-to bottle of Fazzio Malbec is now off the menu, the new French Malbec is very nice and not as tart as the Fazzio was.) This comes with toasted bread, cornichons, and usually also has a grain mustard, a fruit compote, and various nuts. Yes, it's a lot of food but it covers all of the bases. Another reason why I love Bedford - this charcute board is not the fanciest in Chicago but it is solid and if you live in Wicker and don't feel like trudging all the way to another neighborhood, it's got it all. (Please let me know if you have any solid charcute recommendations in Wicker Park/Logan Square/Bucktown) Regulars will note that the various ""toasts"" are gone from the menu - they were never that special anyways, honestly.  I do miss the pork meatballs. Ada street had a very similar version to this but I thought Bedford's were better.  Cauliflower Fritters --  Not fancy. Not fussy. Just a lite fritter. Good to share for 2, ok for 4.  Oysters -- I am an oyster snob. I look for shucking technique in my oysters, such as the absence of shell bits and oyster meat that has been disconnected from the shell (so many places in Chicago don't do that and it's infuriating.) Additionally, is it served on ice, is the ice somewhat shaved or did someone just scoop it out of an ice machine, is there enough oyster juice still in the shell, did I have to ask for more lemons or where there enough (FYI one slice is not enough), is there a nice mignonette, is there fresh ground horse radish in the cocktail sauce, was there enough horse radish, and does it come with a stupid garnish such as weird looking seaweed? (I HATE it when they just decide that I want some floppy seaweed... Why? Why did you give me a pile of ugly, floppy seaweed.) Most most most importantly, is it fresh and cold. It sounds snobby but when I am paying $2.50 per oyster (and it's totally raw and flown in from someplace) I expect it to be executed perfectly. Yes, Bedford passed the test. Drinks: Wine -- Last weekend my go to wine was absent (anyone else feel like Argentinian Malbecs are all but replaced by French Malbecs right now? Is this seasonally normal? This didn't happen last year...) Boyfriend had the French Malbec and honestly, liked it better than the old one we used to get. It wasn't tart at all and tasted balanced. It had a very citrus nose and a spicy aftertaste - seasonally very appropriate. Will say that the Pino Nior tasted watered down a bit : / no thank you. Old Fashions -- Wicker Park and Old Fashions go together like a hipster and a flannel shirt. Was this Old Fashion up to par with other Wicker Park Old Fashions? Nope. If I rated restaurants based on this drink alone, this review would be totally different.  Overall: Portion Size -- decent size. Bigger than other ""nicer"" restaurants in Chicago but not suburb size. Service -- hit or miss. In the past year we have seen a turn over in the wait staff. The server that we seemed to always get was very nice but also always seemed like she was ready to head home for the night. We felt rushed sometimes. And she was a little difficult to get a hold of if needed. Our server this most recent time was much better paced. Ambiance: I initially fell in love with this place because of the fireplaces. Coming here in the winter was always my jam since they have a wall of fireplaces and the tables are literally right next to them --SERIOUSLY CHICAGO, DO THIS MORE. The food is secondary to the fact that I can sit RIGHT NEXT to a fireplace, eat pretty decent food, and have a glass of wine. [It ticks me off when restaurants are all ""yeah, we have a fireplace"" and it's just hanging out in the corner for decoration. I want to sit by it, dude, otherwise just light a big candle.] With ALL of that said, when we were there this past weekend (middle of December) the fireplaces were all turned off. Ummmm? I do have high hopes for this place. I will definitely be back. And I still recommend it to all.",0.9962,0.828,0.117,0.055,0.45213364626826164

2016-09-29,4.0,"DRINKS: I only ordered the Moet Imperial Brut Reserve, the ones suggested for raw oyster pairings and it was good. Despite being labeled as brut there was a slight sweetness to it. I enjoyed a few glasses. SERVICE: The waitress was very sweet and knowledgable, but service here is very slow. Even when there aren't many people. I came on a Thursday and ordered raw oysters, but the oysters took quite a while to come out. Not really sure why, being that you don't have to cook them. Hm.  Also, the ""range"" of servers is pretty small, so trying to get their attention is a bit difficult. And they don't walk by frequently, so you may have to wait a bit to order another drink. Had the service been faster, I am convinced the waitress could have sold us another round of two. Partly because the timing was sparse, partly because I am an alcoholic.  OYSTERS: I had 1871's, Calm Coves, and Beausoleils. The Beausoleils were as expected, small, chewy, sweet. I had never had calm coves before, and they were a bit more neutral, with a sweet back kick. The 1871's were big, plump oysters with a very cucumbery meat. Ah, cucumber. That brings me to my next point.   The Mignonette was made with cucumber instead of shallots. Definitely made a difference in bringing out the melony and cucumber undertones of the oysters. Very good stuff. The hot sauce was also pretty decent. House made.

2016-09-14,4.0,"Ooo, The Bedford is quite the sexy place! Unfortunately for me, my visit here wasn't date night, but now I know where to suggest a place! Instead though, I was meeting up with my friend since we both had wanted to check this place out, we figured why not for some after work cocktails? We arrived early, pretty much when it opened at 5pm, and the place is pretty spacious! Of course walking in, you notice the vault and the loungy room inside, which is pretty cool. The place is candle lit, swanky, and the bar is dimly lit, yet inviting. They have a TV at the bar, which honestly, they could do without, because you would hope your attention would be with the people your with, but hey, to each their own.  We decided to sit at the bar, and our bartender that night was super cool and attentive. For food we decided to munch on: Cauliflower fritters, pot roast rolls, and a burrata. All were really delicious and just enough for the two of us. For cocktails, my friend had the cucumber cooler, which was super light and refreshing. And I had some berry whiskey smash drink, which was really tasty!  We stayed for a couple of hours and more people were beginning to come in, but I didn't really get a chance to see it during the dinner rush.  Great food, great cocktails, romantic decor, plus a cool vault! Service was good, and I would highly recommend coming here for date night!",0.998,0.718,0.269,0.013,0.6901190476190475

It's dimly lit and the old safe deposit room is filled with couches. Great to bring a date you would like to impress. We ordered the: 1. Octopus- it was ok. A little dry 2. Oysters- east/west coast. Thursdays are $1.00 oysters and half off champagne. Oysters were good. 3. Asparagus- came with an egg yolk on top. Asparagus was better without it.  4. Fried cauliflower- really good. It didn't taste like cauliflower. Nicely made 5. Sangria- not your typical sangria. I believe the lemon threw the taste off for me. Downside was when the check came all of the money was gathered and checked a couple of times we  actually had more cash in hand. The server said we were  $20 short. There was actually a $20 that was sticky and stuck to another $20. If she took her time counting she would have realized. She brought the manager over and he said no worries, but I wanted to recount to prove we were not short. He insisted it was ok. I would go back, but will either pay with credit card or count the cash in front of the server.",0.9639,0.819,0.146,0.036,0.47152777777777777

So it wasnt just a whole house problem of being understaffed. I don't know what the problem was really but I do know that we ended up drinking way too much, because the food just wouldn't come. Our waiter was sort of apologetic. Not really. I voiced my opinion, nicely.  When he gave us our bill, they had comped us a free dessert. Uhh, you should have comped us at least 1 full round of drinks since we must have drank 16 between us - Martini's no less. Our $400+ bill was easily 30% alcohol. It's a good thing we cabbed it.

2016-07-11,4.0,"I came here again about a week ago and I'd have to say there was a lot of differences in this visit compared to the first. When my boyfriend and I were greeted by the host, we felt very welcomed and I felt optimistic that this would be a better visit. The waitress came almost right after we were seated and was very sweet and asked us if we had been there before. She let us know that it was $1 oysters and half off bubbly and gave us time to look over the menu. She came back a few minutes later but my boyfriend and I had still not decided on what we wanted, we told her we wanted to order a dozen oysters first and that we would decide the rest later and she was very understanding and said she would check back in a bit. When she returned, my boyfriend and I ordered the rest of our meal and she asked if there was a particular order we wanted it to come out in. We said no and that it can just come out as it's done. We received all of what we had ordered besides the oysters within about 5-10 minutes of order which I was really happy about. I was so hungry and definitely did not want to wait. The food was amazing as I expected and I felt like I could eat forever. There was one thing I didn't like though, which was that the deviled eggs came with some kind of white powder under the eggs and it was so bitter and ruined the taste of the eggs. We scraped it off of the rest of the eggs but I just don't understand why they added on that onto the dish. When we finished our food we waited for our oysters expecting them to come shortly but they just weren't coming. Our waitress then came by and asked us if we needed anything else or if we wanted our check. We were confused by this so I replied that we needed our oysters. She seemed confused and a little flustered by this and apologized and said she would check on them. Our oysters did eventually come but about 20 minutes later than we expected. It was kind of awkward just sitting there for 20 minutes in between our meal. The oysters were decent but honestly not that great, but still okay for a place that doesn't specialize in seafood. For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake and it was SO small. SO SMALL. It was definitely overpriced but I admit, it was delicious. All in all, this was definitely a better visit than the last time so FOUR STARS! Mainly because the waitress was very sweet. I would just recommend to the business that they train their servers to be more aware of what is going on with their tables, especially when it's not that busy.",0.988,0.817,0.124,0.059,0.47464550264550265

Regrettably, I must confess that with each passing year and the further we move away from those Great Recession years (which gave birth to The Bedford), the novelty wears thinner and thinner. The joy of toasting overpriced cocktails inside a tangible currency safe haven in 2009, however, is a cherished memory of this reviewer. The delicious irony wasn't lost on me! Today, its less conceptually impactful and has almost come to represent what it originally set out to achieve - a Roaring Twenties feel good speakeasy. Of course, this is no fun. If I want to ogle vapid, black cocktail dress sheated yuppies I can just as easily go to River North and mainline the real deal. I guess if you want to see the scheming antics of morally bankrupt (pun intended) 20 and 30somethings The Bedford is just as good a place as any. This is a place Eric Trump would go with his friends.

Cool!  The ambience, lighting, and atmosphere all contribute to the cool vibe! They weren't busy when we arrived and we got an open table in the corner. Good so far. But after waiting about 10 minutes for anyone to acknowledge us, we ordered drinks: rum and coke, and a sangria which the waitress suggested. I usually order a rum and Coke when I'm at a place for the first time to see how well they make this simple but classic drink, then I'll order other drinks  if that one is good. Well, it was 95% Coke, 5% rum; for $10,  and the sangria was mostly seltzer water. Another $10 wasted.  We then ordered the burrata appetizer. We've ordered a similar  appetizer elsewhere where it's been amazing. My comment to my gf about this particular one was that it tastes like we're at a pot luck lunch. It was basically a stale chive cream cheese spread on bread. Another $10 wasted. So then we asked the waitress to recommend a hearty entrée because we were hungry. She recommended the sparerib and risotto, which she said was a large enough portion for us to split. So we ordered it and asked her to split it for us. When it arrived in a large bowl for each of us with a half dollar sized piece of meat and 4 teaspoons of risotto, I was mad. To add insult to injury my girlfriend's piece of meat was mostly fat and she got grossed out and couldn't  finish the rest of her meal. I'm not a fast eater but my portion took three minutes to eat. So for total bill of $60 we left hungry and angry. I sent this review to management 2 weeks ago and never heard a thing so they obviously could care less how happy their customers are.

The hostess will either seat you, or show you to the open bar seating, which is not small by any stretch of the word. To the left, as you walk in is a cool, semi-private lounge that was once a safe, that still has the huge door and safe deposit boxes in tact. There is a lot of seating here for dining as well, which leads me to believe they serve a pretty high volume of guests for dinner. I had a couple of glasses of rose while at the bar, which were a little over priced in my opinion, but, when you take into account the location, decor and ambiance, it was well worth it.

Number one daughter had been to the restaurant and thought we'd enjoy it--her savvy doing this through Groupon.  The remarkable point of this is that the restaurant was again welcoming, only inclined to be generous in what was offered during the meal. We went mid-week which made the spot very conversational friendly.  With a crowd on the weekend, I would think the volume rises--our daughter enjoyed the weekend setting.

When the band started they did a few jazz numbers, which was nice, then they went into 1970's pop as well. When they started playing ""Stand By Me"" I laughed.

However, I am aware that this music is a personal preference, so let me move on to our dining experience. When we were seated for our reservation and looking at the menu my wife and I decided to order the exact same thing. For drinks we both got a glass of Pinot Noir. Her drink was fine. My glass was extremely sticky and dirty. It felt like it had residue left on it from something. For the food we both ordered the steak entree, medium rare. When it arrived my plate it smelled terribly of vinegar and ammonia. I thought maybe it was the sauce, and didn't give it another thought. I noticed that my plate had onions, and my wife's did not. Two identical plates, but they were not served the same. When I started eating my steak I found it to be EXTREMELY fatty. There were three or four pieces that I had to spit out and put back onto the plate, and the rest of it was really chewy and rubbery.  When it was almost gone I found something in the steak that I could only describe as a three-inch fish bone. I know I wasn't having fish, but it was long, white, and looked like a fish bone.  This morning, I woke up with terrible cramps and pain, and after moaning in bed for a few hours I threw up in my bathroom..... STEAK! It was all undigested steak from the night before. I don't know if it was a rotten cut of steak, which is why my plate smelled of ammonia and vinegar, or if it was under-cooked, or if it was something else. I was ill all day and had been going back and forth from the bedroom to the bathroom. I contacted The Bedford about my experience. They called me back when I was unavailable and left a message.

The service was friendly and competent.  Not a super large menu but certainly enough variety to please a group.  The cauliflower fritter small plate was delicious - nicely fried and yummy dipping sauce.  The olives were nice to munch with drinks (but we'd like more large olives over small ones).  We enjoyed a complimentary champagne taste. The lamb ragu and squash agnolotti were truly delicious.  The 3 of us shared and enjoyed sides of brocollini (outstanding) and fries (also good).  The dessert choices are a bit limited and we decided that we were full enough so we passed. Great spot with a great vibe.  Give it a try!",0.9981,0.649,0.342,0.009,0.5882638888888889

Host tells us our table isn't ready and that we can go to the bar and they will let us know when its ready. Sit down and order a couple drinks. I was really enjoying my Manhattan so I wasn't paying too much attention to the time but my date told me we had been waiting around 20 minutes and people were streaming in. I got up and went to the host and asked. This time I was behind the podium so I could see their seating system and she looked up my res and dropped us at a table. Follow her back to the room where our table is and there are literally 10+ empty tables back there. Absurd. All the other reviews mentioning the pretentiousness of the place were spot on.  Luckily dinner was very tasty. We had the mussels which were cooked well and delicious. The cheese and charcuterie plate. My date had the burger which she really enjoyed. It was quite big and she couldn't eat the whole thing. I had the steak which was very nice as well. Overall good meal and not horribly priced.

One scallop, split in half, wrapped in potato strings, fried crispy on both sides taking extra care to suck every last morsel of moisture from said 1/2 scallop. This french fry with the essence of scallop was situated upon a mound of braised parsnips that were coated in some sweet glaze, mmmm sweet and salty, just like fast food. Oysters were $3 each, about what everyone else charges, their selection was what you would expect from a Myrtle Beach fried fish shack.weak. Hangar steak with rotten, I mean spoiled, er um rancid yes that's the word, rancid fucking potatoes.

Atmosphere: great, low lighting with a vibrant, classy crowd. The old bank vault is really cool to see and the drinking lounge in there looks like it would be a great place to drink with friends. It was a big hot in the area we ate in due to a fireplace in the center of the room and the crowd at capacity. Service: Our service was quick, especially given that it was CRW. Our cocktails were made and served to us in no time at all! Drinks: the specialty cocktails we had were all very good. We tried the 'La Vie en Rosé', Monty Burns & the Safe Keeping. The SK was a bit sweet from the pomengranate but still tasted great. The LVER was subtle and well crafted. The MB was our favorite (we both wound up ordering one) but they're all nicely done. Food: The star of our order was the Roasted Squash Agnolotti. We both agreed that it was the best vegetarian dish we'd ever eaten. We also raved about the doughnut bite/beignets but not because of those - it was the chocolate espresso sauce they were dipped in that won us over.

Upon arrival, we were greeted by the host immediately. They walked us to the reserved spot in the vault. I was instantly shock! I thought that the vault had a minimum of $500 for a reservation. While setting up for the surprised party our host Heidi offered us complimentary champagne (so that's not the first AWESOME thing) after setting up they offered us and entire complimentary bottle of champagne (CRAZY)! I'm sure this does not happen often. I am beyond grateful that they accommodated us.  The entire time we were there we never had to wait on Heidi. She was always readily whenever we needed her.

The lights are low and the music is loud so not the perfect place for a conversation but if you wanted to get a picture standing in front of a bank vault you're in luck. Huge open vault doors lead to what seemed reserved seating so if you're planning something this could be a unique idea.

The trendy atmosphere and opulent fare of The Bedford truly *vaults* over the competition.  Just how many puns can I include in one review?  Don't challenge me. In case you didn't catch the play-on-words, this lush New American restaurant and lounge offers up some splendid fine dining.....inside a refurbished bank.  There's a wall of nothing but safety deposit boxes and an exceedingly cool vault area for more intimate get-togethers, complete with a 24-bolt Diebold circular vault door that makes for a terrific selfie opportunity.  It's an ideal place to bring a date or someone from out of town that you're trying to impress (and believe me, they WILL be impressed). Emulating the supper club experiences of yesteryear, there's definitely a high-end aura that surrounds The Bedford, with prices to match.  Wines by the glass are $10 and upwards, cocktails costing anywhere between $11-15.  There was an aged whiskey on the drink menu that was priced at something like $73, to give you an idea of the class of clientele that might dine here.  Most of the menu items are labeled as 'light bites', but there are entrees listed that range in the mid-$20's.  Expect dinner for 2 to run you a cool $100, or as I like to say ""a full Benji."" .....Did I just *coin* a phrase?  Indeed I did. [and that's three bank puns so far, for those of you counting] Fortunately I came here with an empty stomach and open mind.  Opting to get a series of small plates instead of a single main course, I indulged in 5 different but equally delectable items: + The cauliflower fritters ($9) came with shredded parmesan and chiles and was served with green goddess as a dipping sauce.  Fairly basic, but filling. + Next came a whipped ricotta & black truffle honey with preserved lemon ($5) served on toast.  The flavor was decidedly delicate and I'm glad my refined palate was able to pick up on the nuances of the black truffle :) + Following that was shrimp de Jonghe ($16), which came with an old bay garlic butter and sherry-laced breadcrumbs.  Anything bathed in butter is bound to be rich, and this was no exception.  Lots of wonderful flavor going on with this one. + After that was an order of the arancini ($9 for 3 large 'cannonballs'), which were mostly fontina cheese.  The pork was lost in the heaviness of the cheese, and the arancini were a little too soft for my liking.  They were served with a harissa aioli and pickled fennel.  After eating these, one could promptly declare naptime. + Perhaps the best item, though were the deviled eggs (4 for $7).  Presented in-line with a splash of hot sauce on either side, they sat atop a magnificent bed of.....wait for it.....bacon powder.  With the texture and consistency of flour, it was unlike anything I've ever tasted.  Extraordinary, melt-in-your mouth bliss that was pure culinary magic.  An absolute must-order. Apart from that,the braised short rib looked marvelous.  The couple next to me got steamed mussels and raw oysters on the half shell, for which The Bedford is highly-touted.  Not for me thanks, I saw that Mr. Bean sketch.  The dessert selection didn't impress me, however, as the only options were a chocolate cake, butterscotch pudding, and a seasonal ice cream.  I found the service to be impeccable--never once having to ask for a refill on water (they were extremely diligent in this regard)--the hostess was charming and the bussers were highly conscientious of removing empty plates. All in all, The Bedford gets very high marks from yours truly, and I hope to return someday when finances allow it.  I recall a time when I used to have an account with a bank from the South Pole, but they froze all my assets.

It's cozy and perfect once the weather gets cool and you're looking to hibernate somewhere for a few hours. The vault is pretty awesome and a great place to have a drink before continuing on with dinner. But do make sure to stay for the food which is really tasty!  We had a raw tuna special appetizer with asparagus ice cream (I know, sounds weird but really worked), a mâché salad and grilled apricots - unique and refreshing.

2015-07-23,5.0,"There is a single discreet door as the entrance of the restaurant that leads you down some stairs to the bar/restaurant.  The decor is classy as they retrofitted this restaurant inside an old bank - in fact, the bank vault remains and last night (Wednesday) was used as a room for live jazz music.  Really cool vibe and feel. We started with some cocktails, the Monty Burns for myself and the Cucumber Cooler for my girlfriend, which she seemed to like.  My favorite drink is a sazerac and the best ones are in New Orleans and the Monty Burns reminded me of it.  In fact, the live jazz while sipping on my Monty Burns transported me to the Big Easy in a way.   For an appetizer, we ordered the Grilled Octopus and it was fantastic.  The octopus itself was extremely tender and the spicy shrimp sauce on the bottom of the plate went perfect with it.  It tasted like Sambal Oelek mixed with Shrimp heads.  Genius.  For our main course, I had the Flat Iron Steak and my girlfriend ordered the Arctic Char.  The steak was perfectly cooked and went well with the mustard/bordelaise sauce and a glass of the Argentinian Malbec.  The Arctic Char was absolutely delicious and paired well with the snap peas.   For dessert, we were told that they were playing around with the ice cream machine in the kitchen and once we heard that there was a coconut ice cream, we immediately ordered it.  I probably could've eaten an entire gallon of it.  It had toasted coconut sprinkled on top and a pineapple syrup underneath so when you scoop out a spoonful, you get a little sweet acidity to balance out the nutty toasted coconut.  Absolutely perfect end to a great meal. Maybe it was the Monty Burns (I mean what a great name - who doesn't love to hate Homer Simpson's villainous boss) paired with some great NOLA Jazz, but I was at home in this place.  The only downside I can see is in the summertime - since there are no windows or outside seating, it was relatively quiet during our meal.  Not dead, but not a vibrant atmosphere which I totally understand.  With the beautiful night that we had last night, people want to take advantage of the few al fresco dining opportunities in the city.",0.9742,0.824,0.132,0.044,0.5698021152289444

2015-07-09,3.0,"Another restaurant on my list of Chicago musts that must have hit its peak a while ago. The Bedford is a cool, swanky bank-turned-restaurant with a menu that a foodie would love, but one that does not live up to its descriptions. My friends took me out to the Bedford to celebrate my birthday and check out this WP hot spot. The waitress tempted us with the sound of the Chamomile Tequila Punch so we started our night off with a half bowl order. While the list of ingredients all sounded fancy and elaborate, it really should've said ""house party style tequila punch."" We were shocked that this was actually one of those giant punch bowls you see at college parties filled with SUPER strong alcohol. Definitely embarrassed that this crowded up our table. Where were all the promises of chamomile, lime and grapefruit? We will never know.  As for food, my friend and I shared the beef tartare, the macaroni and cheese and the mussels. My other friend had the classic Bedford burger, which she loved and what we should've ordered, because the dishes my friend and I ordered weren't as scrumptious as we had hoped.  First off, the beef tartare. I personally thought the chunks of meat were off-pleasing and not the usual even consistency of tartare. Love the raw egg, but the beef cubes did not vibe well with us and I felt bad this was my friend's first time with tartare.The macaroni and cheese was pretty standard. At first, I thought the creaminess tasted a little artificial and almost velveeta-y, but it grew on me as the onion topping really redeemed this side. We also had the mussels which were my favorite of the night. A giant pile of mussels with a tasty tomato broth. Not enough toast for dipping, but it were delicious indeed! My friend also had the whipped ricotta and truffle honey toast and she said that was her favorite dish. So to conclude, the food at the bedford isn't anything exceptional, but is clearly known for it's atmosphere and trendy setup.",0.9982,0.723,0.238,0.039,0.5940992767915844

I showed up here with 6 other people shortly after 2AM on Saturday night after being told they stay open until 3. We all bought tall cans and about 5 minutes later the bouncer told us they're closing up and it was time to get ready to leave. I told him I was confused because this was my first time there and I heard they were open til 3. His response was that they stay open til 3 when there are people there, but ""Nobody is here right now"". I looked around and saw 3 people drinking at the bar, and a table of 4 people sitting at a table drinking, along with a handful of others walking around.  We got up from our table to move to the bar to finish our drinks as fast as we could but he insisted that we leave immediately, asking ""What's the fucking problem?"" and telling us that he's going home and we're leaving too. So we left our drinks which we had just purchased at the bar and walked out. I asked what was up with the other people still drinking and he said ""They're OK, we know them."" As we were leaving one of the ""OK"" people at the bar yelled ""BYE LOSERS"" at us. We walked out with the bouncer following us, who left the bar to go home as we did.  Overall, it was a really shitty experience. I felt pretty disrespected and don't think I could ever see myself giving this place another dollar. I understand closing early if they're slow, but I didn't appreciate being served and then almost immediately being told to leave.

It literally tasted like they dumped a jar of salt on everything.

My wife and I had the steak tartar as an appetizer which had pickles, quail, yoke, and I think capers. The meat was diced up high quality steak you could tell it wasn't processed of ground using a machine. This allowed for varying size chunks of beautiful steak. The next course was the peach & burrata salad with prochuttio. The salad was arugula with just a hint of basil by using slight ribbons. The salad was topped with a balsamic vinaigrette and was a delight to eat. The peaches and prochuttio went so well together, however the burrata was not as creamy as I have had in other places. For the main course we had a flat iron steak and scallops with an eggplant and corn chutney. The scallops were large and cooked to perfection with a beautiful brown butter sear on the outside. I could tell the corn was fresh corn and had a great balance of sweetness to pair with the smokiness of the roasted eggplant. The flat iron steak was medium rare and that was done to perfection. A beautiful char on the outside with rare center perfectly sliced and plated with roasted onions and potatoes. For dessert our server said it was on the house because it was our 8 year anniversary. She said it was her favorite and was the rhubarb trifle. It had a dehydrated strawberry powder on top with layers of cream and rhubarb. It was nice the rhubarb still had some chucks instead of just turned into a purée.  The server was amazing she had suggestions on each course and even told reasons why each dish was suggested. She gave us a complimentary dessert. Since I do not drink she offered that the bartender could make me a mocktail. I said that I'm open to anything and like a sour more tart drink. She came back with a great drink of pineapple, ginger beer, lime, and some other flavor I could not put my finger on.  The ambiance was amazing. The bank fixtures and vault was a great crowd pleaser. The music was great the house played a wilco album and then a steely dan album. The manager came to our table and checked up on us to make sure everything was to our liking.

Definitely not for the Thursday night oyster happy hour ($1 during dinner service, also 1/2 price bubbly). Our oysters took over 30 minutes to come out (for a few people, others who ordered at the same time waited about 45 minutes). Set your expectations, order drinks and an appetizer first!  Food was ok as well - although the grilled octopus itself was perfectly cooked, the salad and sauces were a bit too salty after the first few bites.  Mussels don't come in a broth - instead there's a ""sauce"" of essentially diced tomatoes, so not much bread dipping going on because those are also salty. Liver pate comes already spread on toast and smothered in strawberry jam. At least the oysters were good :)",0.9701,0.818,0.158,0.024,0.507080200501253
2014-08-28,4.0,"This is a cool bar that used to be a bank vault.  We came here for drinks on a Friday night after getting dinner at Seadog Sushi nearby.  I never would have known about this bar if my bf hadn't taken me here.  It's really nondescript from the entrance--just a plain building covered up with scaffolding--and the only thing giving it away as a bar was the bouncer standing outside checking IDs. All the tables looked full when we arrived, so we sat at the bar.  I ordered a Classic St. Germaine punch, which was a refreshing cocktail of elderflower liqueur, sparkling wine, and soda water for $11. Two Jim Beam girls came up to us and asked if we wanted to play some games.  At first, I was thinking no--but then I remembered my days in Marketing & Promotions--and agreed to help them out in their job.  We had to answer some trivia questions and do a blind taste test of two whiskeys.  My bf actually chose the Jack Daniels (kind of embarrassing, given that they were trying to promote the other brand), but I ended up preferring the Jim Beam--which I thought had a smoother taste.  It was kind of fun to play, and we each got to pick a small prize to take home. Later on, we moved into the old bank vault area, and it was really cool to see all the old safety deposit boxes lining the walls.  Everything was gold and glittery, and it was awesome to sit in the corner on the plush seats and check out all the elegant decor.",0.9874,0.844,0.143,0.013,0.4954004329004329

For food, we started with the delicious mac & cheese which needs to be ordered as one per guest, it's that good :)  The chicken was the winner of the mains, which always throws me off because I never bother ordering the chicken, but this was great!  The pork belly sausage was delicious with a nice crunchy spaetzle and delicious braised cabbage.  My friend loved her scallops as well. The desserts were surpising too, our favorite was the rhubarb trifle, I mean, who actually *likes* rhubarb??   Our server was super nice and guided us through the menu with her recommendations.  Overall, it's a cool space with a tasty meal, stop here for a unique experience!",0.997,0.683,0.306,0.011,0.7543571428571428

Besides the fritters, we ordered the shisito peppers, which were really tasty and perfectly toasted.  Our server was nice enough but not overly polite and she tried to sell us on everything, which got really old.

Then you pick a starter for the table.  We had to go with the mac and cheese which was heaven.  It was creamy, cheesy, delicious!  We loved the onion on top. Then we all picked our own mains.  I had the scallops which were wonderful.  The chicken we already went over....ok again it was amazing.  It had this caramelized flavor to it.  Very juicy and comforting.  My friend had the sausage which she cooed about. For dessert we got the donuts which were kind of hard and had a ton of sugar on them.  They were just ok.  The pot de creme and one more thing - I think it was rhubarb trifle?  I forget but I remember making fun of the fruit dessert but ironically liking it the best.

The atmosphere is very cool and most unusual with all of the recycled bank artifacts. Although visiting on a busy Saturday night, our family was not rushed and the service was prompt and constant.

I haven't ordered Steak Tartare in many years (always worried about EColi), but I took a chance and was very satisfied (and remained healthy). Meat was presented in small strips rather than typical ground up fashion - loved it! But underwhelmed by the $8 Bibb Salad. Curbside valet was most welcome in that busy neighborhood.

To our surprise they walked us through the vault, and seated us next to the fire place, at what may have been the most perfect table, in the middle of the restaurant. it was a Friday and they had a dj playing some prime selections for a hip classy date night. i look forward to bringing friends here for future fancy nights out that coincidentally fall on the same day i get my paycheck.",0.9896,0.791,0.169,0.04,0.6165705128205127

The interior is clearly what this place is about.  After the obligatory walk-thru of the vault to our table (and it's obvious the staff is told to walk people through it), we were sat in an interesting little room filled with they-just-don't-make-things-the-way-they-used-to-meets-modern visual interest.  It was pretty cool. The place was empty the night we went for dinner.  The hostess was a bit of a cold fish.  We ordered Caesar salad to share which was decent though heavy on the anchovy flavor and quite small for $8.  He had the strip steak, I had the chicken.  While all the food was decent enough, the portions were smaller than anticipated based on price (though not a bad thing in a day of oversized portions) and nothing was quite ""wow.""  I can't say my chicken was worth the $25 and I, a small eater to begin with, left a little hungry. Our server.  He was like the walking dead.  We waited a good 15 minutes or so before he approached our table.  He didn't have the answers to wine questions, barely checked in on us, barely spoke, gave the wrong info on the steak size, plopped dessert menus on the table without a word and walked away, and picked up the paid tab before we left the table while my sweetheart stepped away to the bathroom.  I don't know what the guy was going for -- cool detachment?  Cooly understated?  Totally unintrusive?  Or, crap I just got sat when I was hoping to get cut early?   And it was super hot in there, temperature-wise, like too warm.  And I'm never warm enough anywhere. Seems to me this place isn't about the food/restaurant aspect but more about a clubby place for drinks that's also trying to serve slightly upscale food.  There's some kind of  intangible disconnect. All wrapped in a neat bundle, these things together, it pushed us over into likely won't be back territory.",0.9521,0.865,0.102,0.034,0.5481060606060607

I had no idea a party was going on. Then she asked if we had checked in with the hostess.  Where the heck is the hostess?  They are bar tables since when do you have to check in for those?  I am giving it a 4 star just based on the originality of the place.  The interior is well done and compliments the vault.  I also appreciated the lighting and lower volumed music.  Most bars you can't even see or hear the person across from the table as it is too dark and loud.,0.8723,0.798,0.12,0.082,0.4585858585858586

We toasted our night, and began the festivities.  I can't unfortunately remember my meal to exact specifications, but I believe I ordered the pork chop. It came out presented with a fried egg on top, which I'm a sucker for. It was cooked to perfection, and the asparagus that came with it had an amazing crunchy/ ""popcorny"" flavor to them.  After the entree's, they treated us to a mint schnapps's shake, which did not have any evidence of alcohol to the taste of it. I apparently didn't get the gist that it was a ""big person drink"", and demolished mine in attempts to sober up (inebriated logic, go figure). I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working, and it makes for a funny story for my fiancee to tell people now when she feels like embarrassing me.  Now, on to the drinks... Oh lawd. My guy friend and I that went with us ordered something they call a ""Stormy and Stormier"". I think it's their play on a Dark and Stormy, and it blew our minds.

The bank vault is absolutely amazing and it makes for a cool and intimate setting for a drink or two.   I stopped in here with a couple of friends on a busy Saturday late night.  Luckily, there was no line at the door, something my friend was afraid of. Most of the tables were taken, but we were lucky enough to find a small one in the back. Service was spotty but I'm going to blame it on the busy evening. I settled on a cocktail from their limited cocktail menu. $11 got me a pretty strong drink but I would have loved to see a more extensive cocktail list.  Or maybe a cocktail list with things that seemed a little bit more exciting to me because nothing seemed too interesting on their list as it was. With this recent cocktail craze, I feel like most places are stepping up their game to be the new and cool locale for fancy-pants drinks...so my thinking is, Go big or go home.  Also, the place is super loud. Great for dancing and general shouting in each other's direction, bad for any type of conversation. Gosh, I need to shut up my inner-grandma...but still, sometimes it's nice hearing what your friend has to say.  Not sure if the Saturday late night scene is exactly my scene, but I wouldn't mind another visit on a different night.",0.9939,0.714,0.225,0.062,0.5750721500721503

We had a decent sized group but were able to get seated pretty quickly (it was relatively early).  The atmosphere is trendy lounge and the crowd was fun. They had a decent craft beer selection and good drinks. My only complaint with the beer list is that they were out of several of the beers listed on the menu and had crappier beers replacing them.  Initially our service was prompt, but as the night went on and the place packed in, service became pretty slow. Seemed like our waitress was overwhelmed and she disappeared for 20-30 minutes at a time. My only other complaint is the music was so loud that it was difficult to hear people sitting a few feet away. Overall - a fun, unique restaurant/lounge with a good craft beer selection.

My scallops were ok and the chop was on the smaller size but decent. We also shared a side of mac and cheese and fries and despite the rave on yelp about the mac and cheese, I found them rather bland. Nothing special.

The only drawback this time was apparently they had booked a party in a private room Friday night which meant the kitchen was swamped with those orders and therefore sacrificed ours and was wayyyyy behind on our food. And we had tickets to a show to get to. So that sucked. The server was apologetic, but still, it should not have affected our dinner. From when we ordered to when we received food it was definitely close to over an hour. And we ordered basics: pasta, chicken, burgers, etc. Nothing too fancy. The appetizer came out quick but for people who worked, ran home, changed, went to dinner or  spent all day traveling, it was like exhausting to wait and wait and then get cold food not cooked all the way through (veggies were all still frozen in the chicken etc.).

Our party of four loved the space, the food, and the service we received from Shannon. We arrived early on Thursday evening, so there weren't many diners yet. We were seated in a gigantic round booth just past the bar area. Shannon was charming and funny and fabulous. And super responsive to our many, many special requests. Need more house-made crackers for your amazing crab dip appetizer? He's on it. Don't fancy drinking your wine out of a stemless glass?  He'll be back in less than a minute with replacement stemware. Unfamiliar with sous vide technique? Shannon's got your back, along with the very attentive busboys. What a fantastic experience!  We had the deviled eggs (really tasty), the oysters on special (really well-priced and very fresh) and the aforementioned crab dip, which I couldn't stop eating, hence the need for more sea salty-house-made cracker goodness. Every entrée was a hit - the bacon-blue cheese burger, lamb meatballs on polenta (yum), sous vide chicken, and the halibut. Throw in half-price bubbly all night and we were one happy group!  Actually, we came in happy and left even happier! It's been a long time since I've been so overwhelming pleasantly surprised by a new place. And Shannon is a keeper. He's new to The Bedford, apparently, and he really helped make our night.

I believe only one couple was in there besides us. There are three corner tables with sofas so we grabbed the one closest to the vault's main door because we were expecting several others. Our server was very friendly & accommodating. Can't remember her name, but she was thin with dark hair. I heard that some of the lock boxes were unlocked & she hinted us in the direction of one. One of the larger lock boxes is missing the lock & we found another small one that you have to pull open with something like a bobby pin. I wish I could try to open each & every one to see if anything interesting has been left behind. Between the two boxes we opened, we came upon business cards, a new bandage, a tampon, a birthday party tiara, an ID, written notes, and other odds & ends. When I went to use the washroom, I noticed every single table was occupied. Seems more like a restaurant than lounge or bar in the room just outside the washrooms. When you walk out of the vault via its main door, you approach the kitchen. I was bummed that we forgot to take more photos of the vault & its door.  I ordered a drink called Bangkok Mule with lime, ginger & coconut. It was pretty good, but I'm mainly a craft beer drinker. Afterwards I ordered a Founders Centennial IPA. We also all shared a meat & cheese plate. My friend brought me a homemade cupcake, but the staff didn't seem to mind me eating in the vault. I would really like to return for dinner sometime.

The waiter offers to get us more toast for our broth. 10 minutes go by, no toast. 2 busboys keep asking us if we want to clear our broth and we tell them to please go get the toast. Finally a manager comes out promising us again a smooth ride from here on out after we got our toast. Our waiter offers us a free round of drinks because of the shitty service.

2013-03-08,5.0,"WE LOVED IT.  Had dinner there last night after visiting the Picasso exhibit (free for Illinois residents 5-8 on Thursdays!).  We somehow came in a magical dead time: lots of tables were free when we got in around 8:30; by the time we left it was packed!   Decor: bank vault, dim real candles on each table, tastefully funky overall.  The women's bathroom has all these awesome photos of bands that have played at various venues in Chicago: there's a close up of Liz Phair at the Metro, etc. Ambience: I felt like I'd gained +3 cool points just by spending time there.  I don't think the cool kids talk in terms of cool points but I never claimed to be a cool kid.  Just cooler now that I've been to the Bedford. DRINKS: these were all omg good. Seasonal punch: our least favorite but still delicious, sparkling wine + lots of stuff.  Fruity but thankfully not too sweet. CUCUMBER COOLER: probably the best cocktail I've ever had.  A gorgeous essence of cucumber flavor (I had it with gin, you can also have it with vodka) with a hint of tangy sweet citrus.  This was delicious. Darker and Stormier: A deeper take on the classic dark and stormy, rum and ginger beer with a twist of lime.  Quite nice. Pimm's...something: Can't remember the name of this drink, but it was awesome.  A Pimm's cup inspired cocktail, but instead of tons of fruit it had fresh basil and a hint of lemongrass.  Again with a cucumber slice in it. Takeaway: any cocktail with a cucumber slice in it is probably awesome.  As the ice melts and the cucumber melts? the drink gets more and more cucumber-y. FOOD: this was also omg good.   Sadly we missed the last oyster special: on Thursdays oysters are $12 for a dozen, which is an insane deal compared to $16 for half a dozen usually.  But they also sell out before 8:30.  So that's a TIP. We started with the Grandma Ann's deviled eggs, which were such a delight.  Comes with four half-eggs filled with a perfectly creamy yolk mixed with some kind of mayo (not too tangy).  Surprised there were no chunks in the yolk at all: no relish, no celery, no frills.  Served on a bed of mild blue cheese and an amazing smear of hot sauce.  These were so simple and so sublime. Next I had the pork chop special, which was exactly what pork should taste like.  I always say I don't like pork, but I think I actually secretly love it, just hate how it's usually prepared (dry, overgame-y).  This was incredibly succulent, sweet, roast-y, Christmas-y, exactly how pork should taste with some sage flavors.  Served atop a sweet potato hash and brussels sprouts with pecans and bacon, which were okay-fine.   We also got the Bedford Burger, which is $12 and on Tuesdays there's a deal for a burger and a beer for some cheap amount.  The burger is surprising: it's all about the bacon-blue cheese jam.  There's a huge smear of this jam on the lightly eggy bun (strangely spongy and light) and that's it with the medium-small burger made of some sort of good beef, but not incredible beef.  It's served with just OK fries too.  So I still love this burger and will have it again, even though I'm not a huge fan of the meat, the fries, or the bun.  That is how good the bacon-bleu cheese jam is. Last food thing: MACARONI AND CHEESE.  It's so good.  So creamy, so rich, and with a mildly sweet/tangy onion breadcrumb crispy topping.  I highly highly recommend this.  It's like the less salty version of Mac's mac and cheese, but with every single ingredient of higher quality. We absolutely adored this place.  No wonder since it's the same people who did Carriage House.  Definitely coming back.",0.9989,0.7,0.221,0.079,0.5730149501661131

Actually come to think of it, once when I went there for dinner at like 10 at night on a Friday, when requesting a table, I was questioned twice (!) by the manager as to whether I was really going to get food.  Presumably because he didn't want me to take up precious table space and wait staff time with the frivolous ordering of 12 dollar drinks far more profitable than any food item.  Apparently he didn't consider the fact that I might write the scathing 5 star review you are reading now.   In summary, the Bedford has a cool bank vault.",-0.7899,0.775,0.088,0.136,0.6388888888888888
2013-03-02,5.0,"The Second Time I went to the Bedford was yesterday. When I first went, it was summer. Now it was winter.  It was a gamble to walk through the cold down Milwaukee. My friends and I (and a guest from Croatia :)) had just had an amazing amazing meal at Las Palmas (Review coming up shortly) and were in need of a place where everybody could socialize, dance, try good drinks...in other words have fun. Well, there were a lot of bars on North Ave. where we were, but they were all the same combination of entertainment (a bar, pool table, rock or top 40 music). We wanted a place that would seal the deal in terms of a memorable night after Las Palmas.  So I chose The Bedford because I remembered the awesome boozy milkshake and cucumber coolers I had with my friend Patrick back in the summer.  The Bedford was where and how I left it....the posh light tunes played by the DJ and the circular vault door that led to an aura of hundreds of little bank storage boxes. What luck we had when we were able to just come and then get our own wide spot of couches within the vault.  And yes, the Boozy Milkshake was still there and it was still awesome!..A mix of mint chocolate milkshake and rum :D Also there was the cucumber cooler which was as breezy and cool-tasting as ever.  We had a very attentive server called Taylor who was just there whenever you needed him. I think I know who I'll looking for when I go back.

On my last dinner there, I was early and had made a reservation. It was a Thursday night and there were like....5 people in the restaurant. I was meeting one of my best gals for a long overdue girls' night and couldn't wait to have a cocktail and some apps. Like I said, no one was there, yet when I went to the hostess booth, they refused to seat me. It was kind of ridiculous. So I just stood there awkwardly waiting for her. Why was it that I couldn't be seated? BECAUSE THEY ARE DOUCHEY. Our waitress acted like she literally couldn't have cared less that we were here. She was so rude and dismissive. It took about 20 minutes just to get a cocktail, and did I mention the place was empty? Our food took ages to come out. Finally, the most offensive act of the evening occurred.

The space is super cool-- the host led us to the vault and we thought, ""OMG, we get the vault!"" but then she kept walking and led us into to the main dining room. Wah. The dining room is a bit brighter and quieter than the rest of the restaurant, but the host gave us an awkward corner seat so we asked to be moved. We ended up in the bar area at a high top. The noise level was above average, but my friend and I were able to hold a normal conversation (hi, Tavernita).  Honestly, the food was 3.5 stars for me. The atmosphere is what kicked it up to 4 stars. I had the Bangkok Mule and he a Manhattan. I thought my drink might be girly and overly sweet but it actually had a lot of strong flavors going on, which is a plus in my book. We started out with the beef tartare, which was served with homemade chips and a quail egg in the center. It was pretty good, but I've had better flavor combinations in my raw meat. We also tried the spinach salad with smoked chicken-- they brought it out without the chicken first and we thought it was underwhelming, but they followed it up with a new one (without us mentioning it, I should add) and we both thought that the chicken made it above average. This is enthralling information on chicken, I'm sure.  For entrees, we split the pork chop and burger. I had high hopes for the pork chop but it was just... alright. Kinda bland. I'd rather eat my mom's? I can't believe I'm saying that. The egg on the top adds richness and I was a big fan of the Brussels sprout hash it was served with, but watch out for huge chunks of bleu cheese. The burger was super savory, buttery, and flavorful. But I also recently had an excellent burger at the otherwise underwhelming Tavern on Rush, and felt like Bedford's burger wasn't quite as good. We also split a side of Brussels sprouts and macaroni and cheese. The Brussels sprouts were yums, and it was at that point that I noticed that it, the pork chop, and the salad were all served with pecans. Some pecan lovers up in hurr. The macaroni and cheese was a standout, but I was just so full at that point that I couldn't eat much. Our waitress was nice, but I didn't hear a single thing she said all night. My friend commented on the fact that one of the busboys was literally the same height as our table, which made it difficult for him to clear dishes. Lollers. The male host was really good, though, and somehow kept a better eye on our table than our waitress.

2012-12-28,4.0,"On a recent trip back to Chi-town to visit a friend I was introduced to this lovely place. I absolutely love the decor and the fact that they left much of the bank features in place to give the place character. We had a reservation so were seated quickly, the staff was great and very attentive. It started to fill up rather quickly in the dinning area as well as the bar area so it got a little louder making it slightly difficult for a conversation but again something I'd expect at most restaurants and even more so at a place that has a full bar and also caters to Chicago's nightlife.  Now onto the food, I have to say the Bedford burger was one of the best burgers I've ever had. I absolutely loved it. The portion was a lot and you could honestly share it between 2 people unless you're starving or a guy. I normally am not a fan of blue cheese but the bacon blue cheese spread was perfect with the seasoning on the burger and the fried egg to top it all off made it that much better. I mean let's be honest adding a fried egg or bacon just puts a dish over the top and this one has both. On my next trip back to Chi-town I'm definitely making a stop to go back here just for the burger.  If you want to go someplace out of down town area and typical tourist areas go to the Bedford and explore Wicker Park and this unique restaurant with friends.

It was VERY (veryveryvery) loud, and very warm and crowded. I was knocked into by patrons in the bar area several times on the walk to our table, leading the hostess to grimace and say ""Sorry. It's crowded."" My boyfriend and I could not hear each other over the thumping bass from the DJ booth, the general crowd noise and the occasional shrieking from girls seated around us. Our waiter couldn't hear us either, and it was funny as he tried to answer the questions he thought we'd asked about the menu. The food we ordered was OK, not great. The goat cheese cheesecake was great, though, except my boyfriend bit down on a chunk of tin foil on his first bite of it. Eeeek.  Our waiter made an effort to swing by and shout ""How you folks doin'?"" at regular intervals, so I give the service a passing grade. About midway through our meal the lights were dimmed even lower and we could barely see anything anymore. Again, more dance club than anything else, although the DJ gets points from me for playing The Clash.  The upscale ambiance they are going for is ruined by the noise level, the bussers in Bedford T shirts scurrying around, and the overcrowding. It's hard to enjoy dinner when people keep walking by on their way to the bathroom, putting their hands on your table to help steady themselves in the dark as they pass, or brushing past dangling their coats right over your food.

2012-11-19,1.0,"It pains me to give the Bedford this low review, but the service, food and overall experience were the worst I've ever experienced.  We had a large group of 12, which is nothing a restaurant or bar that boasts private events and communal seating shouldn't be able to handle.  We were excited to celebrate a birthday and buy copious amounts of food and drink but were ultimately extremely disappointed. First, the server never introduced himself to our group, never explained anything on the menu, and never showed interest or enthusiasm in the large tip that would otherwise await him.  We did ask him to split the bill into 6 different checks from the get-go to avoid confusion at the end; he reluctantly agreed.  But come on, how hard can that really be?  He was slow to fulfill our orders and even slower to take them.  At one point, I gave the hostess my drink order. The menu at the Bedford is small so the natural assumption is that everything must be spectacular if they're only making 15 dishes.  The drinks lived up to our expectations.  In fact, they were really fantastic (when we got them)!  Our first round of food, with exception to the mac-and-cheese, was just OK.  The mac-and-cheese was delicious. Oysters were fine, but how can you screw those up? The charcuterie plate was lackluster.   Everything went downhill very quickly once we were ready for our main courses.  The staff brought the dishes out 1-by-1 so by the time 6 people got their dishes, the first 3 people had cold meals.  Two dishes didn't show up until 15 minutes after everyone else was finished eating!  We had to tell the manager 2 times about the late food as well as alert any server who came within 3 feet of our table.  Completely unacceptable.  The food was just OK with exception of the inedible gristly steak.  Their brussel sprouts were pretty good and the mac-and-cheese made another crowd-pleasing encore appearance. Despite the yummy side dishes and smooth cocktails, the experience was horrible.  We called the manager over three or four times.  He told us he would ""take care of us"" which ended up falling short of our expectations, too.  And remember those 6 bills we asked for at the very beginning?  Well, to put it nicely, they were still completely f-d up. Maybe this place is great for a few people to grab drinks (drinks were phenom after all!) but DO NOT go here to eat and certainly do not go with more than 2 people to eat.",0.995,0.752,0.172,0.076,0.5623015873015874

Here are the things that I had questions about before I went, that I can now answer for others: Q: So I don't get it, is it more of a restaurant? Bar? Club? What?  A: It is a nice hybrid. The dining room is separate but in full view of the large bar/lounge area. There is a good mix of people eating, drinking, and lounging.  Q: I'm just interested in cocktails. Am I going to have to wait in line to get in? Is there a cover? A: From our experience, no and no. We rolled up around 11pm on a Saturday night and walked right in. There was a good crowd inside, so it felt lively but not overly crowded. Q: Is there a dance floor? A: *kinda* This is something I felt could be improved. There are A LOT of tables in the bar area, so many that it made the potential dance floor space prohibitively small. And very few people were actually sitting at the tables - many were trying to awkwardly dance around them. They could lose about 1/4 of those tables to make more room for dancing/milling about, in my opinion. Q: Douche factor? A: Douche potential is high. It's not really my typical crowd, however the space is so sexy and beautiful, and the music (at least when we were there) was so fun, that we didn't mind at all. Go with a group, so you don't have to rely on strangers for conversation. BONUS: they served until 3 on Sat! Yesssss.",0.9869,0.782,0.155,0.062,0.5993714285714286

2012-09-01,4.0,"I wish I could rate the decor 5 stars. The place is gorgeous. Each corner the hostess turned on the way to our table revealed another enchanting glittering vista of a bygone era lovingly polished to a feeling of contemporary flair. The beauty of the space is reason enough to visit the Bedford.  The drinks were exemplary and thoughtfully prepared. I loved my cucumber gin cooler with aperol, which was a great starter cocktail before the meal. Their mac n cheese was the most indulgent addictive. thing. ever. I think it's gonna haunt my dreams. The only thing keeping me from giving it five stars was what I would describe as the fussiness of the experience. The service tried so hard to be invisible that it became conspicuous. Changing plates and flatware between each course is a nice way to clean the slate for the next dishes, but it sucks when someone drops the ball and your party waits several minutes to split food as it cools.   If one of the guests has left the table, someone comes to refold their napkin and place it neatly at the vacant table setting. This is a sweet gesture that shows the management cares, but when the person doing the folding is reaches across front of us while our party is conversing, it becomes a distraction. If you are a seasoned diner accustomed to such fine dining details, this will be a destination space.    What makes me give a restaurant five stars is their awareness that the company we keep is the focus of our destination, not the space hosting the congregation.",0.9827,0.802,0.163,0.035,0.5432539682539682

The drinks are fabulous - handmade with really amazing little touches that really bring the whole experience home. You can tell that the bartenders really adore and work to perfect their craft. Yes, craft people! These folks are pretty damn amazing. This is not your typical Chicago bar.  I should say now, this would be a five star review if I hadn't eaten here. Don't get me wrong - the food and service is great. However, I could not believe how expensive (and TINY) the meals were. I am one of those people who will pay good money for a meal (and an experience) but leaving hungry, after dropping quite a few bucks is a disappointment.

We did get there a little earlier than expected and they were very accommodating. The service was impeccable from the hostess to our waiter to our busboys. They were so nice and definitely paid a lot of attention to our table.  For dinner I had the pork chop which came on a bed of kale and sweet potato hash topped with an egg and a couple of onion rings. The pork chop was a pretty good cut of meat and the egg just added an extra pzazz to it. Although the kale and sweet potatoes weren't given very generously and I wish there was more of it because the pork chop was huge, I felt like more veggies were needed. I mean it was a pretty good dish, but I wasn't wowed I guess you can say, but I do give them credit for the nice plating. A couple of my friends ordered the Bedford Burger and the fries are to die for and they basically were licking off their plates, so you should get that if you're in a mood for a burger. I did also order a drink, I think one can say that they are known for their good drinks, but they could use some work on their entrees. I ordered the Scallywag Punch which was delicious! It was really strong though, but super amazing !! I definitely recommend it.  Now for the interior... I fell in LOVE! Bank vault, safe deposit boxes, crazy decorated bathrooms, couches, lounging, dim lighting.. it was pretty bad ass! All in all it was a pretty good experience but their food did not wow me as much as their drinks did, and it was quite pricey as well!

I love the look and feel of the entire place. Our server started us by bringing over a complimentary champagne toast. I don't drink and my boyfriend doesn't really drink when he's out to dinner with me, but I thought it was a really nice gesture. The food is outstanding. We started with the charcuterie and the mussels. Both are really really delicious. The duck liver mousse on the charcuterie plate is amazing, especially paired with what I think was apple butter? The mussels come in a really nice hearty coconut milk broth. I'm really into broth (yes, I eat the broth with a spoon - don't judge me) and it was some of the best broth with mussels I've had.  For dinner, I had the pork chop (cooked perfectly - I hate when pork is overcooked). My boyfriend had the strip, also amazing. I think I would have preferred escarole with my chop instead of kale, but that's just a personal preference. Everything paired really nicely on both dishes. A lot of places don't do composed dishes anymore, just protein. Both places I work have a lot of protein-only items. I like that both of these dishes everything on the plate added layers of flavor that just really worked together. For dessert, I had the goat cheese cheesecake. I love goat cheese and it was amazing, so light and fluffy. My boyfriend said that it was the best cheesecake he's ever had. My boyfriend had the donuts. He was excited about them, but I was too focused on the cheesecake.  A few different managers came by and asked how everything was. Our server was great. I will definitely come back and recommend!

It seems classy, but the crowd was pretty bland. Maybe the weekend crowd, but hoodies and U of I sweatshirts, come on, look better. The music was decent. The service was not great.

The interior is pretty darned cool. I like the idea, and the folks who run this place only seem to hire pretty women and handsome men as servers. So, on ""looks"" the place is great. Our server was pretty, but tended to forget things, and not understand what was being said. Plus, the hostess might seat you in a crappy table if you are not wearing your after-work clothes. This sort of BS is annoying.  We ordered a charcuterie plate and boy oh boy was it small. The stuff tasted good, but I had hoped for something like Rootstock or better. Tiny little portions and not enough bread. It was ok. That is really all it was.  My friend had the fish and his fish was good but even he said that at the price he paid sides would have been normal. The a-la-carte sides are a bit much for a basement place. I had a burger and it was good, but it was not in a class with some of the better burgers in this price range I could get within walking distance.  I have been here a few times, and have enjoyed drinks at the bar, but this place just gives off a vibe that is very touristy. The TV on the wall that seems to be on all the time above the corner booth seems annoying for a place that charges for sides.  Beyond the great interior, and super sexy but not so well prepared servers, I can see how this place is becoming a ""happy hour"" and ""trader"" thick sort of place - a sure sign that the neighborhood is changing into something more like Lincoln Park.  This said, I think the novelty of checking this place out is worth a drink - and the bar staff (those working the bar rather than the tables and other sections) are top notch.

They have a very small selection of finger foods, but they're all very unique. We all got denied eggs. That's right: eggs.

They're that good. The bill wasn't cheap (my 8 drinks, plus my partners, plus my share of the eggs) came to about $120. When you think about it, it's not that bad.

Well, what can you do for us? The two hostesses were so nice and accomodating, I almost couldn't believe it. They gave us 2 options. 1. Sit at a booth and get moved in 1 hour and 15 for another resi or 2. Sit in the vault and order food. We took the booth because we knew we'd have enough ttime to eat and could order drinks in the vault or move elsewhere in WP. I was still shocked that they even let us sit! :) Anywho, on the the food and drinks. We ordered the mussels and cheese plate to start. I would recommend these both, especially the cheese plate. Two jams, honey, pecans, multigrain french bread and 3 awesome cheeses tied us over. The mussels were also great, with a light garlicky cream sauce, and non-fishy meaty mussels.  These two apps were perfect for 4 people. There was a breaded pork special which my friends split and really enjoyed. We ordered and split the steak which was cooked to our liking, accompanied by white onions, moist mushrooms, and some crunchy hasbrown-like potatoes. This meal was spot on, though most of the entrees were a buck or 2 over-priced, but no big whoop. They have a very good beer, wine, and special cocktail list.

Since we had a large group the gratuity was included in the bill. My friend paid part of his bill plus $10 tip on his cc and we paid the rest in cash. However, the server came back to tell us that we are $10 short. It took us awhile to realize that this was because the $10 that my friend wrote as tip couldn't be included in the bill that already had the gratuity included. Does that make any sense to you?  So after trying to explain to this rationality to an irrational tip-hungry server, I asked to spoke to the manager. However, everybody in my group was in a foul mood at this point and just wanted to leave. So the server agreed that my friend could cross out the $10 tip from his bill and pay $10 in cash instead. Again does that make any sense? I used to be a waitress for several years and this was either just a scheme to get $10 more tip or blatant disregard to serving customers with respect.

My friends and I came on Friday night for a 10:30PM reservation made just  an hour before. Opentable reservations are the way to go! You will get right in avoiding any line; however, it appears that the swanky revamped bank vault is never too crowded. The wait staff was very accommodating and even changed our table to make room for a last minute addition.   My friend and I were famished, so we started with the deviled eggs. Yum! The hot sauce is a great addition and the eggs came almost as fast as the drinks. For entrees we ordered the Charred Baby Octopus and the Watercress Salad. The Octopus had a pleasant spiciness complimented by the subtle brininess of baby clams. Fortunately, the dish was not fishy at all; however, it makes a better entree than a sharing plate as the dish is presented in tower form atop only one piece of bread. The delicious Watercress salad was just the way I like it green, nutty, and not overly drenched in balsamic dressing. The carrots and beets were a nice touch that contrasted the slightly fatty chicken thigh (which is advertised as ""crispy,"" but really isn't). I would pass on the fries, since there wasn't too much flavor and nothing memorable about the side ketchup and ""Bearnaise"" (I think it was just mayo). Our food was pretty reasonably priced, but we also didn't order the $25+ meat dishes. Throughout the night our libations included the Cucumber Cooler, the Jessica's St. Germain Cocktail, a Scothch-whiskey cherry drink, and the Scallywag punch. All were fresh, tasty, and well-portioned. The Scallywag punch packs a fruity zing...I loved it! At $9-$11 a cocktail though, you are walking away with a pretty large tab. As a Wicker Park foreigner and admitted skeptic, I was extra tuned into my people watching and mentally tallying the number of Weezer glasses, plaid shirts, and hoodies. Overall, the guys probably should have appeased their dates by tucking in their shirts, but there was some attempt to rise to the occassion of meeting the chic decor. The loud and lack of dancing, makes it an ideal place for a larger group of friends. I would not recommend this place for a date.  I liked The Bedford for exactly the reasons that I dislike The Violet hour. It clearly did not have the pretentious quiet rules and quota on people standing up.

The layout screams glamour and it was really hard for me to write this review without overlooking the fact that the service we had ruined it for the lovely ambiance of The Bedford.  I stopped by with some friends on a Tuesday night before a birthday party and nobody had been before so everyone was very excited. They had 1/2 off Oysters and bottles of Champagne which I thought was a really great deal. We took advantage of both and it was a nice starter. The drink menu was creative and with nice drink options and their dinner menu looked yummy as well. It was hard for us to come to a conclusion on what to eat.  We settled on the following dishes. Mushroom Stroganoff, Smoked Trout, Red Snapper, Strip Steak, Macaroni Gratin and the Autumn Hash.  The winners out of the group were the Strip Steak which was prepared with  celery root and fig gratin, vinegar glazed trumpet mushrooms, roasted shallot marmalade, blue cheese, and celery leaves. It was cooked to Medium Rare perfection and the gratin was SO good. There was ample blue cheese and it was a great dish.  The Macaroni was some of the best I have ever had and the Autumn Hash was great too. The Red Snapper lacked flavor, the Smoked Trout would be more fit for an appetizer portion and it was way too salty and the Stroganoff was kind of boring.  Right about the time we ordered our food was the time our waitress pulled a houdini. We had a late arrival who was ignored for quite some time, he wanted to order food but could never get a chance to. One of my friends was not supposed to get meat in her entree and she had meat. We didn't have silverware so our food was sitting in front of us for about 4 minutes before we got dive in. I was very disappointed by this. Some of my friends had questions about their dishes and some people needed things. When our waitress never came back to see how things were and we didn't see her until plates were cleared, I knew it was time to go. Especially since she never came around to ask if we wanted dessert or another drink for that matter. If she was busy with other tables, we wouldn't have known since she didn't seem to have any sense of urgency with our table. The table next to us seemed to be dealing with the same problem.

But the karaoke sucked. Real bad.  It's gong-style, so some guy decides who stays and who goes. No matter how on-par the singer is, no matter how on-board the audience is, if he does not like it, you get kicked off the stage. And this guy was on a major power-trip. I guess I can see how the whole gong-thing can be fun: the more into it you are, the more into it the audience is, the longer you stay up and fun is had by all. But as previously mentioned, the judge was, well, ick. Totally ruined it in the beginning. I'm not any sort of karaoke connoisseur, but I have never NOT had fun at one of these things. This guy kicked both me and my friend off-stage before we were even thirty seconds into the song because 'the audience wasn't into it.' Likely because there wasn't really anyone there yet and we were the first two to go. You have to warm 'em up.  Anyway, don't worry. We staged a coup. There were some lovely bar-goers that also decided fun trumps this guy's terrible taste in music and facial hair, and cheered along despite his gong-ing.  Also, the 'special' pulled pork sandwich wasn't stellar but it did cost us $8.

2012-02-24,2.0,"Had high expectations after reading some of the reviews on here, but was sadly disappointed. The best part, for which the two stars go to, is the concept. The bank vault was amazing. I honestly have never seen anything like this anywhere else. Had an early-ish reservation on a Friday. Which was a good idea because that place fills up fast. Sat down and service was good, the food though was not. Three girls...we ordered the pea soup (peas were not cooked enough and almost had a crunch to them) and the bowl was probably equivalent to 1/4 of a normal bowl of soup. Our entrees (strip steak and pork loin) were both cold. The strip steak, ordered medium, was medium rare, if not even rare. But the whole plate and everything on it was lukewarm. Disappointing because if the food had been warm, it would've been delicious. The pork was pink, but cooked enough. But again, the plate was cold, as was the entire plate of food. We also ordered the autumn hash, which wasn't at all hash (not to mention it's winter). It was barely cooked halved brussell sprouts, diced sweet potato and an over easy egg. Again very disappointed. Nothing ""hash"" about that...and I couldn't even cut the brussel sprouts w/ my knife they were so undercooked (and completely unseasoned). Both dishes would've probably been really nice with the accompanying ingredients on the plate, but because of the temperature of the food...it just wasn't good. After dinner we ordered a decent bottle of wine, but because it was about 10pm, before we were done, we were told that the table was needed and we needed to finish our drinks in the vault...which was too crowded to accommodate us. For 3 good looking girls who just spent over $200 of a mediocre dinner, I was quite surprised by this. So, my synopsis. Skip the food. Grab a drink, wander through the place, then get out. When we left, there was a line out the door...but it was clearly for drinks and not the food.",0.9914,0.802,0.149,0.048,0.6322839506172842

If you come here for the purpose of lounging and profiling, then this is a good start.  The cocktail menu is slightly greater than basic, but maybe that's planned.  It was pretty busy the Friday night we went, so it's possible the sophisticated drink menu was sacrificed for one that enables to bartender to cycle through customers faster.  More efficient - I'm ok with that, I think. The music pleasantly surprised me.  Anything from Depeche Mode to the Smiths to Two Door Cinema Club to Holy Ghost to the newest DJ remix found on youtube.  Thus they can appeal to the snobbiest of music snobs and to peeps just looking for a nice boogie. And there's of course, the decor, specifically the Vault.  Not ""The Vault: Def Leppard's Greatest Hits"", but the former bank vault incorporated into the design.  It's pretty sweet how they made use of the vault and the deposit boxes to add to the decor.  They even kept the table where you fill out deposit slips before meeting with the teller - complete with the attached pen!  Inspired work. If they're looking to become the next must-be-seen-at music/dance lounge, I'd say they're off to a good start.  If they try to be anything else, some work will have to be done.",0.9937,0.769,0.197,0.034,0.6144736842105264

We ordered: Mussels Gnocchi Liver Mousse Octopus Frites Mac&Cheese Chicken Donuts Brownie To be quite honest there was barely anything that stood out in a positive way.  The best dishes were the frites, mussels and the donuts. Frites were nice and crispy.  Mussels had a nice tasty broth.  And the donuts were nice and fluffy! The octopus, paired with 'crispy"" pork belly, was a bust.  If the pork belly had come crispy then the dish would have worked.  However, texturally, chewy octopus paired with a soft, chewy pork belly just gets muddled in your mouth.   The Mac&Cheese is no better than Annie's Organics with a bit of added cream and/or cheese. Other than the aforementioned hits and misses, nothing really swayed me one way or the other.  The service really does need a touch up - you can't get by on hiring hipsters as waiters just because they are hipsters and you are a ""hip"" establishment.  Knowledge is key!

Cuisine left A LOT to be desired. The powdered, chalky bacon powder on your deviled eggs? Lose. It's gritty and unnecessary, a sole crisped piece of bacon would keep the flavor and lose the unappealing mouth feel. The mussels? Serve them hot. 'Nuff said. Those overcooked Pork Chops?

Much to my surprise they had a couple of good options for me (a veganess)! MAJOR BONUS POINTS! We soon received our drinks and put in a couple of appetizer orders. I must say when you go... order a couple of the Oysters and the Vegan French Onion soup! Both are must haves! The soup was probably my favorite dish of the night. It was made with mushroom stalk instead of traditional beef broth and had flavor like you could not believe. My date actually ended up liking it more than expected so we were both aggressively spooning for the last few bites! Game on! When our meals arrived we had already been served our second round of house drinks. All of which had a true mixologist behind their creating. We ordered the vegan hash, vegan risotto, and the grilled baby octopus! The grilled octopus was raved about by my date and the risotto was awwed over by both of us. Fabulous!  As planned we headed over to the renowned lounge area that used to be the vault of the bank above! The intricately pieced together massive vault door is quite a breath-taking entrance.

The bar area and vault are super nice. The quieter tables are too sheltered somehow. The place itself is actually pretty big and it feels that way, sort of cavernous. This is probably intentional. The cucumber cooler was the standout of the cocktails for me, though usually I find more on a menu I'd be interested in (this place is heavy on the whiskey cocktails which, though they are good, don't always do it for me). The food is kind of tricky to order. Mac n cheese is good but not mindblowing. I've seen them use bacon dust. Weirdly, the best thing on this menu is the pickled pear salad, which I expected to be mediocre and was actually a knockout. I like the looks of this place better than the actual food. However, the only time I was here I had a really odd server. I usually am a Sodikoff fan and lurk around his places (especially Gilt bar) and also seem to end up at Drawing Room a lot. The service there is always spectacular, informed, and cool. Here, it was that weird kind of Wicker Park pretentious that isn't hipster as much as it is 20-somethings who are trying to prove that they are trendier than their clientele for working there. Yet most of the clientele is hipsters dressed up on dates. I can't explain what about it was so weird to me, but she wasn't good, didn't seem to have a handle on her tables, and in general was kind of ... condescending about the menu and about everything. Which is funky, since usually when you know how to order people warm to you. That wasn't my experience at the Bedford.  I think I would get a drink here again just to sit around and bask in the awesomeness of the atmosphere. I'd probably order food because it was good.

2012-01-25,2.0,"When The Bedford opened last year, it received a lot of publicity.  A new trendy restaurant/bar in Wicker Park, occupying a former bank.  One could have cocktails in the defunct bank vault.  Cool. I was looking forward to my first visit to the Bedford and sadly, was disappointed.   My companion and I previously had dinner, so we were looking for after-dinner cocktails and dessert.  The server was friendly.  I asked for her suggestion for a sweet cocktail.  When she spoke of the delicious brownie, I was sold.  The Pisco Punch ended up being my cocktail.  Perhaps, I have been spoiled by the mixology geniuses at Maude's Liquor Bar, Watershed and The Drawing Room, but this cocktail did not deliver.  It came out too quickly and I was suspicious.  Sure enough, they have it available by the bowl.  They probably make it by the batch.  The cocktail was not well-executed and was nothing special.  Next comes the brownie.  As a recovering chocoholic, I limit my dessert consumption.  I took two bites of the brownie.  It was horrible.  The texture, temperature and flavour were fighting each other.  When the server returned to our table, I asked her if the brownie was pre-made.  She said it was or else one would have to wait 20 minutes.  I am the person who would gladly wait for a sumptuous dessert. The ladies room was well-appointed in soothing grays and accented in hot pink. It was freezing cold! In the ladies lounge area, I noticed a space heater tucked underneath the makeup table.  Considering the space was formerly a bank, perhaps there were issues with keeping the space warm and toasty.  The bathroom stall doors appear to be old security box room privacy doors.  Very quaint, but it would have been nice to refurbish them, to eliminate all of the nicks and scars.  I can appreciate old craftmanship and quirky details, but considering all of the renovations done to the space, having a nicked up bathroom door is not appealing.  The bathroom should be pristine.   I am glad I got to see the Bedford with my own eyes, but shall not return.  After hearing all the hype, I think it is overrated.",0.9043,0.852,0.09,0.058,0.5781332229861642

Definitely has a feel of a 1930s / 1940s style bank.  Went on a fairly slow Monday night. Service was good. When I ordered one of the entrees (pork shoulder), waitress wisely clarified that it was a pate. I would've been annoyed had that been what I ended up getting, so I was very happy that she pointed that out. You can check out the menu on their website, I get the feeling that it changes every few months. So, I ended up with the ""sausage"" entree. It was a combination of sausage, sweetbreads, and ham hock croquette. The sausage was fantastic, maybe the best sausage that I've ever had, but the portion size was much smaller than I would've liked (essentially the size of one smaller sausage link). The other food also tasted good, almost non-existent ""side items"" (wish I would've known that and ordered one of the side items).  My friend got the steak, it was a bigger portion and was really good as well. We enjoyed the brownie dessert.  Dinner for two, with tax and tip, was almost $100. Downside: fairly expensive for me, and I didn't necessarily feel that full at the end of my meal (though that would've been a little different had I ordered apps or side items).  Summary: If you don't mind spending $100+ for two, then you'll love this place. All in all, a part of me would've preferred to go somewhere else where I left feeling more full afterwards.

2012-01-07,2.0,"This is the third time I went to the Bedford... the other two times were fine or good...this last time was just plain bad..Bad service and bad or uniteresting overpriced food.   Ok..the room is beautiful...still don't understand why there is an entire wall of pictures of people with lawnmowers but it is still beautiful. Ordinarily I do not write these reviews... having owned one in the past I would rather just tell the owner manager on the way out, but the onslaught of hipsters for a guest dj made that impossible.  The deviled eggs are very good and to me it is not the bacon powder that makes them good it is the buffalo style hot sauce..  The Salt Roasted Pear Salad was a complete let down...the pickled pears were interesting ...the roasted were nothing...greens were nothing...and the flavors were uneven.... but still very edible...just not interesting and not half as good as it looked on the menu... things continued down hill from here...we waited for about a half hour for our next course..it may have been longer... at one point both of use were looking at the server and she saw us looking....NO ONE comes over to communicate with us....Steps of Service.....server doesn't control the kitchen but it is there job to communicate and be an advocate for the customer...if I had to guess the dish we ordered came with charred onions that we asked for no onions...it was probably done wrong and re-fired but I have to guess because no one bothered to inform us or acknowledge it...and the spiral continued from there...we were sharing the whole night and the gnocchi and chicken came out together...was hoping for them to course it but by that time was just happy for food...both dishes felt like somebody had no idea how sprinkle salt on...The skin on the chicken (which I love) was so over salted it was barely edible...the whole dish was almost ruined by it....the stuffing was great and unique...the chicken was juicy but for 24 bucks and to feel like i had my salt intake for the week from one piece of skin..uggh!  Then to top it off...my friend orders Grand Marnier..the server explains they don't carry it ...after some miscommunication because of the noise of the hipsters..the servers say she will come back with a taste of something that my friend my like in its place....ooops she comes back and they do have grand marnier...except she doesn't come back with the grand marnier...instead it is 20 minutes from the time we first order the after dinner drink until it gets to the table...mind you not a crafted cocktail..just grand marnier for an after dinner drink.  I will probably remove this review in short time but this restaurant needs to know what is happening....because between bad food and bad service I felt jipped walking out of there...I live so close and will still probably go to the bar since the scenery is good but for dining...not again..one positive on service...the food runners and bussers...were great..not overbearing on asking about clearing and quick and professional...kind of a dying art in Chicago.. This does bring me to another point...of course I left the full tip...because if you leave a bad tip...you are a cheapskate and the server never realizes it was because they were bad...and you don't want to be known as a cheapskate...its also generally I will complain after about service because I am don't want something for free...

The goods: The music was fun! I can get down to Depeche Mode, David Bowie and Duran Duran in a New York heartbeat (and I did). The bar scene was more than happening on a Saturday night, but plenty of sexy nooks and abundant seating opportunities mean your well-heeled feet get a rest.  The best: The scenery, by a landslide (beautiful people and decor). Again, it doesn't get much better than drinking in a bank vault (right up there with ski lodge cocktails and Hvar Beach champagne). The bearded bartender and the server with the bombshell Brigitte Bardot hair also reigned supreme... such cool cats! The great unknown: The food.

I really like to bring friends here who visit from out of town because it's usually not super crowded but not empty, it's very unique-looking inside, and, if you can score one of the couches in the lounge room, it's a great place to chat and drink and feel fancy.  Bedford attracts guys who are still conveniently wearing suits because they ""came straight from work"" as well as the more high-brow hipster crowd. One night they had a DJ who looked like Harry Potter which I thought was cool, and he played mostly 80s music.

The food was served with some pretense, but lacked in quality and execution. In fact, it was practically inedible. Fish that was supposed to be lightly salt-cured was a lump of salt, French toast was not supposed to be served dry and reheated and pancakes... think the taste and texture of cardboard.

2011-10-23,4.0,"I paid a visit to The Bedford on a Saturday night with a few girlfriends for some dinner and drinks and overall it was a great time and I plan to go back! First, be sure you know the address (1612 W. Division St.) because there is no sign or clearly marked entrance to this place.  There is just a guy standing by a door on the side of a large bank building...very speakeasy-ish!   Once inside, we headed down a flight of stairs and into the dimly lit bar and lounge.  Surprisingly, we were able to get seated right away at a table by the bar with no reservation at 7pm on a Saturday night!  We sat down and got a feel for the place.  It wasn't crowded yet, but most of the tables were full with diners.  It was a mix of young and old couples and groups of friends.  It felt like we were on the set of Mad Men.  It had that swanky, glamourous, vintage feel to it, but surprisingly, was not pretentious at all!   Our server, Alex, was patient with us in making our food and drink choices and helped us navigate the menu.  I tried one of the seasonal cocktails, some kind of apple concoction.  Sometimes, I feel very confused by cocktail menus that use all kinds of ingredients I've never heard of, but Alex really described everything well and didn't make me feel like an idiot!  Same with the food menu.....it was a little more upscale, but not so much that you had no idea what you were eating.  I tried a deviled egg, yum, and then I got the duck bolognese entree.  I would have passed over that entree on the menu, but Alex described in a such a delicious way that I just had to try it.  And, he was right, it was a great choice! We ended our meal with the donut holes....you can't really go wrong with fried dough!  Then, we asked Alex about getting a seat in the infamous bank vault to have some cocktails.  He was really great and actually had the bank vault waitress save us a couch while we took care of our bill! We entered into the bank vault lounge area right through the gigantic vault door and had a large couch and table waiting for us.  The vault is pretty large and probably has about 8 separate seating areas and the walls are covered with safety deposit boxes. The cocktail waitress, also named Alex, was friendly and efficient.  We stayed and had a couple drinks in the vault just because it was so cool and unique.  How many people can say they hung out in a bank vault?   By the time we were ready to head out, it was close to 11pm and the place had really picked up.  It was filled with a younger 20-something crowd by that time and there was a significant line waiting at the door outside to get in.  I would suggest getting there before 10pm if you'd like a seat and don't want to wait outside.   Overall, I really loved this place.  I don't know that I'd necessarily go back for dinner, but I will for sure be going back for more cocktails in the vault.  It's nice to hang out at a more swanky loungy place sometimes, rather than the same old sports bar!",0.9977,0.802,0.161,0.037,0.4998668714797746

As far as food goes though it's a big let down for the price. If you get a table (not in the vault) you can order anything from the menu. Portions are small, not cooked to perfection and the service is slow. Wouldnt be so picky except the price demands it. Stay away from the oysters in the vault room. NOT FRESH. If you are going to serve oysters like it's a big deal those things better be good, and they were not. We had a big group in the vault on one occasion and ordered a few platters and that was the group consensus. The limited menu in the vault room is also a let down.

A neighbor of ours invited us to dine with them and as mentioned above I'm really glad we took them up on the offer.  The Bedford is located in the lower level of what was most recently an MB Bank.  According to the Assistant GM the building is part of an initial 1930s group of bank buildings in Chicago that were built around their massive basement vaults.  This will become clear once you see one of the prominent features of this restaurant.  The entire décor of the restaurant is well thought out and designed.  They have done well in keeping and showcasing many elements that reference back to the prior tenants of the space but have add a ton of new elements.  The lighting and art on the walls are done particularly well.   Now to the important stuff.  The menu is fairly basic and in addition to a few daily specials has 4 or 5 options for each course.  We started with some deviled eggs with bacon powder that were great.  It is amazing how such a simple dish, done really well, can be so satisfying.  We also ordered a braised beef cheek special that came with a spinach & barley salad.  It was one of the best things we had that evening.  The cheek just fell apart and the barley was unique and tasty.  We also got a Fluke appetizer dish that was excellent, in addition to the light and tasty Corn Fritters. We ended up getting the Mussels for an entrée and they were excellent.   They have an excellent variety of wines that allows you to find something tasty at any price point.  Their Pisco Punch is awesome.  We didn't sample any of their specialty drinks but they looked good.  There were a few beers on tap and in the bottle that were calling to me but they are going to have to wait till be go check out Brunch some time.",0.9964,0.817,0.171,0.013,0.5445887445887447
2011-10-13,4.0,Life changing macaroni and cheese. Definitely meant for sharing as they pointed it out. A group of 10 of us came here last Saturday night with reservations. It took a minute for us to get in waiting in line outside then later waiting for the table to be set. The atmosphere of the place is very lounge-like and trendy. The bank vault setting made it very eye-catching. Music was a big meh.  We sat towards the back in a U-shaped booth. Behind us the wall was lined with safety deposit boxes which was very cool. Service was on it even with our big party. We all order food and cocktails. All were delivered very quickly. I'm in love with their refreshing Cucumber Cooler stirred cocktail as it reminded me of summer. Another group of friends ordered the Pisco Punch bowl and it was impressive at all.  Food choices were a hit. Most of the boys ordered burgers with the egg on top and they were all in love. Deviled eggs were a surprise to see as it isn't your typical bar food. What took the cake was my order of their version of macaroni and cheese. WOW. Speechless. Using gruyere cheese on anything makes the dish but here it was used amazingly. I truly am a big fan of m&c and this one is the best I've had out. MONEY BABY! I'll be back here to take some more friends for the great decor and food.,0.9915,0.813,0.176,0.011,0.4658333333333334

2011-09-28,3.0,"I've heard great things about The Bedford, from the overall concept of putting a bar in an old bank vault, to their craft cocktails, to the detailed attention to design. I really wanted to love this bar, especially since I live only 3 blocks away.  I came here on Saturday night with about 6 other friends for my birthday. Maybe it was the day and time (Saturday at Midnight), but when we walked in, it seemed a little like...Wrigleyville. There's no doubt that the interior design is awesome. Especially the room with the copper money boxes. But I think the people behind the bar's concept were hoping to attract a slightly different crowd. I really wasn't sure what to make of the crowd. Some were over-dressed, others were very under-dressed, and I didn't get how bad 80's music playing way too loudly throughout the bar fit in with the overall theme. I expected a darker, quieter, lounge-type bar a la The Violet Hour. Their drink menus were well-designed (graphically), and their fancy list of cocktails made it seem like one would expect an upscale, high-quality experience.  I waited about 15 minutes for a drink (seriously) while one bartender opened 6 Bud Lights for some bro, and then continued to make 6 more mixed drinks for the same guy. No other bartender approached me. The cocktail itself was good...but not worth $9.  Overall, I think there is a bit of a disconnect between the initial concept of the bar, and those who actually go there. I can't say much for the food since I didn't try it. But will I be coming back to The Bedford? Maybe on a quieter weeknight, but I think I'd rather stick to the Violet Hour.",0.962,0.84,0.11,0.05,0.4455065359477124

The ruby trout was calling my name for the main course.  With the mention of hazelnut puree, wax beans, and cherry tomatoes, I was sold.  My initial impression when my plate arrived, ""I got the runt of the catch!""  My initial impression upon first bite: ""AND they overcooked him until he was bone-dry.""

The gruyere macaroni was delicious, the octopus was charred to a not-so-delicious crisp and oddly paired with hunks of pork fat, I've already said my two cents about the summer stew, and the dessert was fantastic.  Beers (Midwestern craft brews) were $6 a pop for what seemed to be less than an American ""pint.""

I'd recommend the Cucumber Cooler, hands down. The vibe was pretty mellow. And I loved the super swank bank vault that they kept perfectly in tact. You can even have drinks surrounded by old safety deposit boxes...very cool! On the other hand, the reservation policy is crap and it varies with who you talk to on their staff. When we called, we were told we couldn't reserve a table if we weren't eating dinner. We were also promised a call back to let us know if we could bring our Bday cake into the bar to celebrate. NO call back. So we chanced it and brought the cake and our friends to The Bedford for a night of celebrating. Upon arriving, we were asked if we had a reservation and we had to shamefully say, ""no"" and wait for a table to ""open up"" even though there were plenty open. After drinking for more than an hour we asked to have one of the giant booths that was open and were told that it was ""reserved"" for a bachelorette party that hadn't yet arrived. Maybe they thought a bachelorette party would spend more money, but with our 20 person party, I highly doubt that. I'm also confused at to why they could make a reservation and we couldn't? At that point it was after 11pm and the Bedford's dinner menu doesn't run past 11:00, so the Bach Party couldn't have had a dinner reservation. Guess a Bachelorette Party trumps a Bday Party in the host's eyes? And the icing on the cake: They wanted us to pay $5 a person to cut the 6 layer rainbow cake that we made ourselves and brought to the bar. It would have cost us $100 to cut a HOMEMADE cake.  RIDICULOUS!  If we would have known about this cake cutting fee ahead of time we would have cut the cake at dinner at Frontier instead (which was awesome by the way!). So we grabbed plates and forks at a nearby liquor store and headed down to Phyllis's Musical Inn, where a loud sweaty band was playing, the bartenders weren't snooty and there wasn't a door guy delaying our fun!

My roommate and I came to the Bedford for the first time for our birthdays with a fairly large group of maybe 20 people.  I called earlier that week to make a reservation and they said they only take reservations for dinner.  To me that's a bit silly when I definitely rank up a bigger tab with drinks rather than with food, none the less we really didn't have much trouble getting in, and eventually found a small standing room table to lean against. Also with my call ahead earlier that week I asked if we were allowed to bring our own cake.  The lady on the phone was not sure so she took down my number to call me back to let me know there policy.

Despite the warnings, we called to try to make the reservations anyway. For that night. They basically said there was no way that was happening.

Probably because it was early, but the service was excellent the entire time. We started with the soup of the day- a chilled cucumber soup. To be honest I love cucumbers, they are my go to veggie and not only did they have a cucumber drink but soup as well. I was in heaven. The soup was amazing, it had a slight kick to it and the spices really made it memorable.  I've been really into feta lately and their hanger steak came with big chunks of feta cheese. AHH.

I probably passed it a few times walking to and from the blue line before I realized the large wooden door, in between a parking lot and CVS, is how you enter the restaurant (it also helps to notice the valet guys standing outside). What is The Bedord? From the website:  ""The Bedford is a local kitchen + bar serving up casual quality, located in a historic, landmark bank space. Contemporary American cuisine is elevated to crafted comfort, through German and Southern influences and paired with a carefully concocted cocktail list, craft beers and boutique wine selections."" The space is certainly landmark and really cool; once you walk downstairs you're transformed back in time to an old school bank vault where instead of depositing checks or asking for a safe deposit box you get to enjoy cocktails and local midwestern cuisine. It's hard to know how much of the decor was there vs. what was done by management, but doesn't really matter since it looks great and is not like anything else in town. In addition to the cool setting, the other highlight of our meal was the great value from the Wednesday three course Prix Fixe menu for $25. The menu changes weekly and is local sourced that day so no advance warning is possible. Our menu was grilled zucchini (with tomatoes, feta cheese and pesto), rabbit done three ways (pate, paste and salami) and crispy chicken thigh. It's an incredible deal considering most main dishes are $20-25. To compliment the prix fixe we also ordered fried green tomatoes, mac and cheese and a bone in gunthorp farm pork chop. My main concern with the food was that is was highly inconsistent. We absolutely loved the mac and cheese (and we should know since it's a requirement to order if on the menu) and brought some home for the following night. The zucchini was nice and simple, clean and refreshing. No one makes better pesto than my mother but it certainly reminded me of summer. I also liked the rabbit dish. It's not something I would order again or thought the flavors were up my alley exactly, but it was interesting, inventive and creative. I was dissapointed in the fried green tomatoes, though I'm not expert. I thought there should have been more sauce or more flavor all around. The chicken thigh wasn't bad and the mashed potatoes were quite tasty (and buttery). The thigh had a crispy outside that added a nice tough of texture and a healthy does of salt. Erica's pork chop was the biggest bummer as it was a huge chop but had zero interesting flavors. It's not that hard to make a good chop on the grill and we were surprised how flat it tasted. We didn't try and house made cocktails but figure since we live so close and want to sit inside the vault area we will likely return in the colder months. The food was up and down depending on the dish though the menu had many appealing options to try. It's still new so maybe some kinks in the kitchen are still being worked out. The space is great and will continue to attract curious diners looking for something new.

Except, while the Ball & Biscuit maintains that small town, Midwestern charm, The Bedford kicks in up a notch with a real bank vault. Real safe deposit boxes. Real bank doors on the bathroom stalls. It doesn't get more authentic than this, and whomever had this business idea deserves a medal, and to come find a bank in Indy to do the same, so that when the Ball & Biscuit gets full, I have another option for wonderful drinks and ambiance. That being said, just like The Ball & Biscuit, The Bedford requires a bit of a dress code. I showed up in jeans, my friend in shorts, and our casual status was an anomaly in a sea of LBDs and F-me pumps. Because of that, it makes it difficult to consider a favorite haunt: I don't haunt places in 3 inch heels. And my favorite haunts generally have a little bit less expensive drinks (but at least I was able to procure an excellent craft beer on tap). Didn't have the opportunity to try and of the food, but I'll take the other reviewers word on the quality: they certainly offer interesting choices (devilled eggs at midnight? Not so sure, but it must appeal to some!). I'd be interested in doing dinner there, only because there are so many different corners of The Bedford to explore. That's the key here: you'll always discover more secrets in the vaults of the Bedford. Such as the big safe deposit box in the vault. Take a look, but don't take anything (bad karma); I put the 'Alaska Grown' medallion in the bottom.",0.9949,0.768,0.18,0.052,0.5983829365079367
2011-07-24,4.0,"Oh Bedford I am SUCH a sucker for your interior.  An old bank vault, complete with safety deposit boxes and a giant safe?  A beautiful transformation of this space, and for this I applaud you. Your service is amazingly prompt, although I am a bit confused by the set up.  So I have a waitress, but she does virtually nothing?  All the heavy lifting is done by runners who are clad in a disappointing uniform of a t-shirt and jeans (IMO looks drastically out of place in this elegant space).  And there are a ton of them too, I don't think the same person came by twice to deliver a plate or clean up.   Your ladies bathroom is gorgeous, but admittedly shocking.  While the restaurant is very subdued in wood tones and dark, soothing colours, the bathroom is like a Lincoln Park shoe boutique.  Tell me, Bedford, what does black fleur-de-lis wallpaper, mirrored furniture, hot pink accents and photographs of musicians on stage have to do with banking?  From what Andy tells me, the mens bathroom is much more appropriate for the theme of the space.  Why the jarring riot of colours and patterns for the ladies?  I honestly did not get it.  As for the food:  Mac and cheese is in the top 5 of best I have ever had.  Rich, silky, uber-cheesy, salty, devine.  It was so good I was sad we opted to share as I wanted the whole thing for myself.  Deviled egg:  firm egg white, creamy yolk, served with hot sauce and powdered bacon.  For a buck and a half this is an amazing egg and worth every penny.   Now, the mussels. I love mussels and have had them more times than I can count.  I know how mussels are supposed to be served.  Since the shell to meat ratio is pretty high, you should be given a massive amount for it to be worthwhile.  The bowl that arrived (and cost $14) was easily a third of what normal portions are.  Sure, they were steamed with chilies, garlic, spring onions, Schlitz and a touch of cream, and therefore quite delicious, but not even the bread that came with it could make that an entree.  This was an appetizer at best.   So close Bedford, so close!  I dont want to have to close my account and do business with someone else, I want my money to work for me!",0.9969,0.739,0.2,0.061,0.5968912529550828

I just hosted a birthday dinner for 10 girls at The Bedford and granted, it was a weekday, but our experience collective and for each individual was fabulous!  We started out with drinks at the vault and just the idea of being inside a real bank vault, operated by MB Financial as recently as 2 years ago, just blew my mind and put me in awe already.  Our server was good and the punch we ordered was so yummy that we ended up ordering another bowl!  The dinner menu is superbly vegetarian-friendly, but the menu isn't too creative (neither are the prices too high). I like that the tables are far apart enough where you can easily chat and not overhear neighboring conversations or run your chairs into them.  I tried the gnocchi and the macaroni gratin, which is really just mac n cheese, and liked both.

LOVE the bacon powder and the filling was very nice and flavorful. Fries w/bernaise. AWESOME frites.  loved. Cheese plate - the cheese that is similar to cheddar was excellent, was not a fan of the goat cheese w/ash rind. The bleu was fine, I'm just not a blue fan. The accessories to the cheese were not as fabulous as I would hope. beet salad - you must love beets to love this salad, there is not a ton of stuff going on outside the beets but they are fabulous. hangar steak - loved. cooked perfectly, love the red wine sauce. macaroni & cheese - so creamy and flavorful. highly recommend. scallops tasted great, but wasn't a huge portion. was just 2 avg sized scallops. mussels - i'm told they were good. that isn't my thing. cocktails were great. especially the cucumber cocktail!!

2011-07-15,4.0,"At the corner of Division and Ashland, in the basement of a building that was built in 1925 to house the Home Bank and Trust Company (now a CVS pharmacy) lies probably one of the coolest new places to open up in a long while based strictly on decor.  The Bedford welcomes you, after walking down a flight of stairs, with the original vault that was in the bank. The huge vault doors are swung open and inside, are over 6000 copper safety deposit boxes lining the walls lending an ambiance that is unmatched by another place in town. The sparkling chandeliers are muted with shades lending a contemporary nature to a classic fixture. And the seating arrangements in this room make you just want to sit and stay awhile with it's combination of chairs and sofas.  Other parts of the old bank also lend an air of sophistication to this underground lair. The gilded table that once housed the bank slips still has pens in the holders. And the women's room is oh so cool- with doors that maybe once closed to offices (original hardware intact) and the walls of the stalls made out of what appears to be paneling from the old bank. (Can you tell I am an old building junkie, yet? I just LOVE re purposed old buildings that you can actually tell what they once were in a former life!)  The bar area has a long bar taking up the right hand side of the room, while tables and banquettes finish out the space. And to the left?  That great vault to sit and sip a drink in. We were seated in the back room, with a view of the vault through gilded glass and began to look at the menu. As usual- we tried a variety of items- some good, some just okay. The winners? Kumamato oysters (fresh and crisp) fried green tomatoes, grits (the guy I was with is a Southerner so when he says thumbs up that's a big thing!) fava bean spread on toast, and for our entree, the chicken which was juicy and tender.  The losers? Well first they were out of burgers (how is this possible, it's a burger?) so we couldn't order what we wanted. And the gnocchi that our server raved about was really just okay.  Our servers,Jessie (and Megan in training) were great, pleasant and personable which made our entire experience better. My only issue with the service was that the food came out from food runners, who just didn't seem to fit the image of the place. They wore jeans and tshirts and practically ""shoved"" the food on the table versus placing it and telling us what each dish was when it arrived (or maybe that was supposed to be the server's job but somehow the timing for that was off)  Dinner, with drinks for two ran about $130 and valet parking is available out front- although you can usually find a spot on Division within a block or so.  While the place started off pretty empty, by the time we left at 11pm, the bar area was hopping and the music had been turned up a few notches turning this into the classiest club in the area.

As for the food, I'm very surprised to read some of the reviews.  It's a new place, so perhaps some of the negative experiences on here reflect those growing pains.   I have to say, I had an amazing meal at the Bedford.   Deviled Eggs w/ Bacon Powder and Chili Sauce:  Awesome ($1.5/egg) Gazpacho Soup: Brilliant.  Green Gazpacho perfectly finished with chili oil, watermelon, cucumber, and basil.  Really exceptional and set up high expectations for the rest of the meal. ($6/bowl) Fries:  Bearnaise Sauce was excellent complement to a very good fry.  Things that make you say ""mmmmm"" ($6) Muscles:  OK, the muscles were good.  They were on par with what I'd expect at a place like Longman and Eagle, but not at a great seafood place.  Not knocking them, but I can see that if you ordered just muscles, you wouldn't write home about it. ($14) Mac and Cheese:  Excellent.  Perfectly creamy, rich, full bodied. ($10)   Hanger Steak:  Awesome.  Came with a spinach and blue cheese and was perfectly rare with a nice sauce. ($24) We enjoyed the food above so much, desert was a no brainer.  Doughnut Holes w/ Coffee Liquor Icing:  Awesome.  Of course, deep fried dough crusted with cinnamon sugar and sweet coffee icing should be good no matter who makes it.  ($6) All that in an atmosphere that is completely original and makes me want to stay for a long time; I'll be back.  The drink menu was good.  They could expand on their mixed drinks a bit as there is stiff competition for mixologists these days in the area (Longman, Whistler, to name a few).  I like bourbon and rye, and they carried Templeton and 4 Roses as their base, so no complaints there.

But, the service we got was pathetic. I don't know if she was oversat or just incompetant, but she was quite inattentive. We never were asked how our appetizers were (duck liver mousse and devilled eggs, which were quite lovely) or our dessert (decent strawberry rhubarb pie from a neighborhood place). My scallop entree was quite well-cooked and suited me just fine, but the boys sausage was overcooked to the extreme. It also took almost 45 minutes from app to entree, which is a little over the top. 19$ for one sausage was obscene and made me feel as if I was singlehandedly paying for the renovations they made to turn that place into a bar. The server also was quite forgetful with drinks and getting more bread for the mousse (the stuff was warm by the time I got more). The back of house were great, constantly refilling and clearing. Getting charged twice for the boy's 2 lemonades which tasted as if they came from the soda gun was my breaking point. The portions were small, but other places have small portions and still manage to sate your appetite. The boy went to Wendys after we left for a cheeseburger. All in all beautiful decor and back of house, reasonable liquor prices, but I wish their entrees were more equally sized. Some were as small as apps and others were quite substantial with no real comment of which were which. I wish the menu was divided more as to light eats and actual dinner portions rather than just from the earth, sea, and pasture.  I'd go again to see if the service was a one-time thing. It's a nice place to see the decor and have a cocktail. It's also perfect if you intend on spending a long time snacking and catching up with a friend. Will attempt to review soon and see if it was a one-time issue with service. I'd give a few more stars if it was just an off night.",0.9702,0.823,0.117,0.06,0.5134615384615385

The furniture was totally outdated and made you feel like you were grounded in your grandfathers library.  In the summer - I prefer more open airy places, maybe this is a more winter spot?  Overall, I'm glad we just stayed for one drink. The overpowering smell of fish was also a turn off.

The ambience and atmosphere was great.  You can see they really played up the heritage of the space.  It was almost surreal inside the vault, surrounded by mid-century-looking lounge furniture.  The antique table used to fill out deposit slips (right across from the hostess stand) is jaw dropping.  The original crown molding in the main dining area is a decorator's fantasy.  I was there on their very first Sunday night service.  There were 4 tables of diners, plus a small group of people at the bar.  This kind of killed the ambience, as I imagine it's a completely different atmosphere if the place was packed. Service was very good.  We were skeptical about the deviled eggs, even though everything I read raved about it.  Our waitress went into a lengthy description of the whole dish.  We had 6 dishes, all to share, and it was coursed out appropriately.  Although, there seemed to be a noticeable lull between courses. As for food, most of what I tried was solid.  The Deviled Eggs were ok.  The housemade Venison Sausage and Mustard Lentils, while good, felt a bit out of season.  Fava Bean Crostini, Radish, Pickled Red Onion was a good spring dish.  I liked the Crispy Walleye Pike with Chorizo, Clams, Fennel, and Citrus.  A lot of places are using chorizo and clams these days, and Bedford has jumped on that bandwagon. The star dish of the night was the special of Rabbit and Spinach Ravioli, with Chard, Giardiniera, and Pecorino.  The pasta was intense with the rabbit meat.  The pickled veggies gave it a nice jolt of acidity. Dessert offerings were interesting.  It's either pie from Hoosier Mama, or ice cream from Black Dog.  A 3rd option is the boozy milkshake, made with leftover pie from the day before.  I chose the salted fig ice cream from Black Dog.  I like Black Dog and I like Hoosier Mama.  It's great that there is another venue to sample their treats. Why 3 stars?  The Bedford is in a fantastic location and has good atmosphere.  Maybe it was a wrong night, but it was definitely more a neighborhood place (as they advertised), instead of the cool speakeasy that the press is reporting.  Food was solid overall.  It is gussied up comfort food, so not much creativity required.  A few minor things that will hopefully be ironed out in due time.  There is a 'DJ' setup in front of a panel of relocated safe box covers.  Maybe I should drop in at 1am some night?",0.9873,0.836,0.131,0.033,0.47560019841269835

We were seated off to the right side of the restaurant part, and none of us could put our finger on it, but something was amiss. We realized that the music was the same in EVERY room, lounge, bar area and restaurant and there are hardly any windows, which makes for a Vegas-like situation. It could be 2P or 2A and no one would have any clue. The customers varied from ladies-night out to dates, to an older crowd, to a 3 year old with his parents. I started my night off with a Bedford Bramble--ginger beer, blackberry, 5-spice and lemon juice, encanto pisco; a great summer cocktail to get me in the spirit! I had 4 of them......our apps consisted of: pimento spread, hand-cut fries, fried chicken wings, and the duck liver mousse. The fries werent worth the fat, they didnt give enough hand-made crackers for the spread (which I think Trader Joes has one thats just as good),  and the wings although AMAZINGLY flavorful with the buffalo sauce, werent crispy AT ALL--bummer. The only thing I truly ate the most of was the duck liver mousse--it was divine and duck livery smooth and delicious. For dinner we ordered a couple of things to share and try: mussels, scallops, burger and the macaroni gratin. The scallops were the BEST thing on the menu hands-down. The mussels were good, burger was disappointing (and not hot) and the macaroni gratin I thought was salty and not worth the calories....not the cheesy goodness you really want when biting into some mac and cheese.

This place has it all, food, drinks, and a bank vault. /stefan On this visit we didn't get the food but i guess the chef is somebody of note so maybe it'd be good. after a ~20 minute outdoor wait on a saturday night, our group got in and found the place not super crowded (the line outside is definitely for show). in fact we were able for find seating for ~13 people and I did see some other open spots around the area. Then we ordered drinks and it was good times, if your idea of good times is sitting around and drinking. The draw of this place is I guess it used to be a bank and now it's The Bedford. The designers were either too smart or too lazy to convert everything so the bank vault/safe deposit boxes remain and function as a conversation piece. I think this would be a good location and premise for a Nicholas Cage movie, though I'm not sure what it'd be about. The biggest complaint is probably the temperature of the place. It was kinda hot (and you thought I was kidding with my opening sentence) and the place doesn't seem like it has good circulation. It was a bit like being in an attic, which is ironic because we were in a basement. Throughout the night there were some glimpses of the AC being on but not enough to make it super comfortable. Let me tell you about the bathrooms.The females seem to have it pretty good, they have a fancy sitting area (that you can see through the transparent first door) and what I assume is the usual bathroom through another door in there. The men's room was ok, it was 3 or so urinals with partitions. On this visit both of the stalls were ""out of order"" so I wonder what the plan would have been if I had to so some more ""special business"". Also there's a guy sitting outside the men's room holding a pack of mints.  The sinks are either modern or space conserving because they are set at 90 degrees from what you are used to (they're side mounted). It's a bit narrow in there so I think it's space conserving. That's about it aside from the fancyish decor this place seemed like the usual to me. The music was pretty good and I would classify the mix as ""90s to current rock that was popular but not quite mainstream"". If anyone knows the name of the alternative rock song that goes ""ba da ba ba ba... ba da ba ba ba ba"" (that's all guitar riffs) let me know because it's stuck in my head.

I was very disappointed that the cocktail list consisted of three drinks, two of which looked like classic cocktails with new names. I opted for the Jackknife Judy, a whiskey drink with tea and a hint of Cynar, which at least seemed different. Yeah...more like a lukewarm glass of Cynar. Totally unbalanced, to the point that it made my friend sick to her stomach.  Hoping the food could at least measure up to the amazing surroundings, we ordered a handful of small plates from the appetizer menu:  chicken wings, deviled eggs, fava bean dip, and frites. The fava dip was actually pretty good to me--very spicy. The deviled eggs were completely over-salted, the frites were hand cut but soggy and accompanied by two sauces that essentially tasted like lemony ketchup and bad mayonnaise, and the chicken wings? I will reserve a full paragraph to state my loathing of these chicken wings. For one, they were covered in what was listed as ""buffalo sauce."" It was bright green. Extremely off putting, but I was willing to give it the benefit of the doubt--if they tasted awesome, who cares about the color of the sauce? They did not taste awesome--they tasted like someone had ground some steamed broccoli into a puree and slathered chicken wings with it. What in ANY WAY about the color, texture and lack of taste would possess the kitchen to call what was covering my chicken wings a ""buffalo sauce""? I guess ""baby food sauce"" would sell fewer small plates. When we asked for the check after barely touching our food or drink, our server insisted on removing the cocktail from our bill and tried to find us something we would like on the menu. Her excellent service could not salvage everything else going against our evening, however. So, I stand corrected:  if it weren't for a bank vault and a great server, I would have tanked the Bedford.",0.9905,0.802,0.14,0.058,0.6900113144431326
2011-05-06,4.0,"They had Daisy Cutter beer so I was very happy. I was here on opening night and had really been looking forward to this place opening up right around the corner. We were seated in the dining room area right in front of the vault so we had a great view. Our waitress seemed very informed and took time to go over the menu with us and checked on us often. Every member of staff we spoke with was extremely friendly. We started with the frites with béarnaise sauce. I loved them. I liked them so much I am thinking of going back later tonight just for a beer and those frites. Then we had the spinach salad, which is extremely filling. The candied nuts in it were great and there was lots of chicken. I loved the bleu cheese - it wasn't as overpowering as it sometimes can be. There were also lots of mushrooms and a honey vinaigrette.  Then we had the deviled eggs. Yum. I've never met a deviled egg I didn't like. We were pretty full at this point but we'd also ordered the grilled cheese and a small portion of the fish. I didn't know the sandwiches came with fries but who can have too many? My main reason for wanting the grilled cheese was the onion jam (I LOVE onion jam) but the cheese was so overpowering that I could hardly taste any of that wonderful stuff. Really, the aged cheddar and gruyere were such a powerful combo that my hands needed an extreme after dinner scrubbing  in order to lose the smell. Strong stuff. Had the sandwich been loaded up with a ton of sweet onion jam I would have enjoyed it a lot more. It needed more sweetness... something. The sauce that came with the fish was way too salty. I didn't enjoy that at all...but I was here on opening night and I understand that things aren't always perfect right away. All in all, I had a great time here and I see myself coming back quite a bit. I look forward to trying more of the menu. I think this is an excellent place to go for beers and I know out of town friends that will adore this place. As for mixed drinks, I didn't pay much attention.

I loved the bar...it was so cute.  The vault and all the safety deposit boxes..there was a lounge-y area, eating area and the regular bar area.  Perfect-o. So the bar was all full so I asked the hostess if we could sit at one of the hi tops to get drinks...she was like, well thats our dining area.  Then a guy came up to me and said it was pretty late and if we wanted to sit there, we could.  I mean, I didnt think there was going to be a rush of people at 930 looking to eat.  Good job in recognizing this.  The guy gave us drink menus and explained a little bit.  I guess they used to have 9 cocktails but narrowed it down to 3 because the bar couldnt handle it....if you have ever worked in the service industry....you know that these amazing cocktails take WAAAYYYYY more time to make than the standard. We tried the edison's medicine and jackknife judy because I really wanted to try the cucumber one, but I was swayed because the waitress said it was really sweet=me not a  fan.  Both were good.  The jackknife reminded me of a spin on a manhattan... I thought the service was fine, however it wasnt very busy.  Plus, its a new place...cut them a break.  I think this is a great addition to the neighborhood and my other favorite bar is across the street....RITE LIQUORS!!!   WOOHOO.  Anyway, I think I will be back here.",0.9904,0.826,0.164,0.011,0.5197023925148926

2011-05-04,3.0,"Stumbled to The Bedford the other night after dining in Wicker Park. Myself and three friends sat in the vault, which was definitely as neat as the picture and other reviews made it seem. Overall, the decor of the bar was the most impressive part of the bar, although there is a disconnect between the ritzy, Violet Hour-esque vault and the rest of the bar, which looked like an upscale sports bar. This dichotomy, in my opinion, is a sort of microcosm for the entire bar: it hasn't quite formed its identity yet. On the one hand, the venue has a classic quality about it, from the vault to the food down to even the stylized font on the front door. At the same time, patrons seemed a little dressed down and while I enjoy indie music, I must say it felt a little out of place given the scenery; I was expecting jazz or lounge. While individually these things seem trivial, summed together it leaves you with a feeling that this place just doesn't quite have it together yet. The most disappointing part of the experience were the drinks. If you're only going to have three cocktails on the menu, make sure they are excellent. I ordered the Cucumber Cooler only to find it a sugary mess--what's the point of using a good gin like Hendrick's if you're going to mask all of its characteristics with syrup? My friends fared little better with their choices. We then decided to do a round of bourbons. When asked for a list, our server had to run to make a photocopy of a handwritten list. My dismay continued when I find out that $13 got me a very meager glass of Woodford Reserve. After that, I stuck to the bottled beer. In spite of the negatives, I will come back here at least once more, to try the food and give this place another shot. It's one of those place that you really want to like, and I hope that in a few weeks time, they will be able to get it together. There is a lot of potential with this place, I think they just need to figure out what their niche is.",0.985,0.845,0.122,0.033,0.5017156862745098
2011-05-04,4.0,"Intro: Went here at 6:45pm on a Tuesday for dinner with my wife.  A beautiful space that we feared was too large, but it filled up by the time we left at 8:30pm.  Having only three courses and a tiny dessert, the dinner dragged.  Confusion abounded with servers and our waitress was absent for long stretches.  Obviously, these kinks can be attributed to its recent opening. Ambience: Bravo on the buildout.  Too bad there aren't any windows in the place.  TVs at the bar weren't on.  Music was a tolerable level and well selected. Food: Great for the price.  I appreciated the option of small plate versions of certain larger dishes. -Deviled eggs: decent, enjoyed the bacon powder -Pimento cheese: great bread-to-cheese ratio -Pork & veal meatballs: seemed a little rare on the inside but good crust -Fries: large, hand-cut guys; underdone -Mussels: Highlight of the night. I've had mussels pretty much everywhere in the city.  These are the best and biggest -- like mussels on steroids.  (Gilt Bar and Rootstock are a close #2 and #3.)  Cream, leek, shallot, and garlic broth and huge portion for $8. -Cobb salad: crunchy wedge, crispy bacon; good stuff -3 Floyds milk stout ice cream from Black Dog Gelato:  We ordered the mexican chocolate as well but only received this one scoop.  Must have been a miscommunication with the waitress, and we would have brought it to her attention if she hadn't run off for 20 minutes. Drinks: I thought the food and drink menus were supposed to be Midwest-centric.  I was able to order a couple of Belgian beers, including a Bruges Zot.  I'm not complaining, as we recently went to Bruges, but it just seemed odd.  I had three beers.  Wife had two glasses of wine, which she enjoyed.

2011-05-02,5.0,"I went to the Bedford this past Saturday with a group of 9.  We sat in one of those wrap booths with a perfect view of what was going on. Deviled eggs with powdered bacon?  Mmmm... sold!  I loved the menu concept.  Taste vs Indulge?  I ""tasted"" four of the menu items: deviled eggs, bean dip, wings, and the oysters on the half shell.  No complaints here.  The guys were all in man-love with the wings and the bean dip.  My two faves were the wings and eggs.  The oysters were good, but that is just how they should always be... There really isn't room for raw oysters to be less than good. For entrees, I had the halibut and my boyfriend ordered the pork tenderloin.  They were both good choices.  My only regret was not trying the salad that a few of the people ordered.  I believe I heard it was ""the best salad I have ever had... I could eat this salad every day.""  For dessert, it looked like they were offering different things from local bakeries and vendors in Chicago, which I liked.  The hit at the table was the apple pie and Mexican aka spicy Chocolate gelato. Beyond the food, the drinks were good.  I thought the beer list was actually really reasonable, actually some of the beers were almost what I would consider a steal.  Daisy Cutter cans for $5?  Awesome.  I fell in love with the whiskey drink on their signature cocktails list.  It was pretty much a version of a Manhattan, and it was super tasty!

The music is what brings me back. Too many places rely on piped in music or a DJ that plays whatever he desires. This place had hand selected songs - every song.

2011-05-01,2.0,"I made the mistake of going to the Bedford so you don't have to.  For starters this ""craft"" cocktail bar's extensive list included only three options that were priced above a drink at the whistler and tasted miserable.  Their beer list looked fine but due to a big first night, they were out 4 of the 8 draft beers and half of the bottles.  To have that big a night you would think that the Coolio car from fantastic voyage stopped by, fortunately the server's extensive knowledge had me paring my dinner with a $4 Schlitz.  For food, the broth for the Mussels tasted like a cream based soup, and the toast that came with it was burned.  They offer two sizes of most offerings- you can ""taste"", essentially half of a portion, or ""indulge"", a dinner size.  We chose to taste the Scallops and we less than delighted to be served one.  Had we chosen to indulge, we would have been served 2 for $24 dollars, which seems ridiculous.  For the main course they were out two entrées but the steak we ordered was good.   Overall the décor is cool, the ""vault room"" looked like a very cool, swanky lounge and would be the only reason to go back to this place.  My lady friend said the the ladies room was lavish, unfortunately the men's room was not, perhaps they should spruce it up given the amount of people that will be clogging the toilets after the mediocre vittles,   Also,the music was solid, wilco/radiohead/black keys/ryan adms etc.  I should cut them a little slack for being their second night but in my opinion you should not be open if you are not prepared to do so and we were there at 8 not 11.",0.9625,0.843,0.105,0.051,0.48075268817204303

2011-05-01,3.0,"I walked in with high expectations - a bank vault? snooty valet? sounds just like the kind of a-holes that I would want to hang out with. So I went in to grab an appetizer and a drink before heading to Ruxbin closeby (thats definitely a 5 star review), and what I witnessed was odd, and less than what I had hoped for. Two problems plagued me: First, I was expecting this place to be super classy, an analogue to Violet Hour with an old western twist given the bank vault. What you get is the opposite - the bar has TVs over it playing sports (bummer), people aren't dressed well (should have enforced it), there is too much wide open space (I would have made cozy dark alleyways that were a bit quieter), and the bookshelf was from Ikea. Second, they dont have their system all worked out. In the vault, you can order a drink, and (we thought) some food from the tasting portion of the menu. Nope - instead there is a separate menu of food that you can order in there. Ok fine, tell the hostess not to hand out the wrong menu, no worries. Next, see the other reviews regarding drinks on the menu, those are true. Finally, the worst was when we ordered the wings - $8 on the menu, $12 on the receipt, and the waitress, very apologetically said that the menu was a misprint, it actually was $12. I was fine with the limited food menu in the first place, but not with paying extra because they misprinted their menu. It took 20 minutes for her to get it sorted out and bring us a new bill, and she said that they updated the computer system. This means, folks, that my gf and I were the first ones to order the wings at the Bedford! (Or the first ones to notice that anyway.) They are very tasty, but as they are buffalo chicken wings, see the note above about this place not being classy as I had hoped.

2011-04-30,2.0,"As a disclaimer, I just came from grabbing drinks at The Bedford so I can't speak for the food (though the menu didn't look particularly interesting). And I realize that it's still opening weekend, so there are bound to be some wrinkles. But as of right now going by Yelp, ""Meh. I've experienced better."" It was opening weekend so I was prepared for a long line and a packed venue. A restaurant/bar in old bank space, including vault? Sounds pretty cool. Preview pictures looked pretty cool. So it wasn't a surprise when I arrived at the entrance that I was indeed waiting in a line. But it was a surprise that when the friendly doormen stopped waving their friends in ahead of me and I finally was allowed inside, the place was actually not very full. At 11PM. On opening weekend. So now I'm inside and really annoyed because I was waiting in a sham line, but fine. I don't know Chicago fire code, and maybe they're trying to build hype. And it was a particularly nice night outside so it could have been worse. The inside looks ok, and it's pretty big so it would be pretty tough to jam pack it. But there isn't a consistent feel. The vault is cool, but it's nondescript and off to the side. Outside the vault, where most of the space is, you wouldn't really think there is a bank-style theme. I'm not sure what I was expecting, maybe marble everything with vaulted ceilings and oversized leather chairs, old guys with counting machines and other stereotypical (but classy) bank decor. If bank wasn't what they were going for, then I guess it's just a normal restaurant/bar? Which brings me to the drink list: confusing. The drink list features mostly wine with a decent craft beer list (at decent prices) crammed at the bottom of the list (along with the hipster-throwback Schlitz and Old Style). But then you try to look for a cocktail list and you see it's on the back of the drinks menu. And it's only 3 cocktails long. I guess I was also expecting more focus on cocktails for a place like this. So yeah, a lot of questions still outstanding, which probably accounts for a VERY mixed bag of people who were there. Is it supposed to be a cool upscale restaurant and lounge with a real line outside? Or a comfortable bar to grab food and a few beers with a fake line? Why am I supposed to come here versus everywhere else in Chicago?
