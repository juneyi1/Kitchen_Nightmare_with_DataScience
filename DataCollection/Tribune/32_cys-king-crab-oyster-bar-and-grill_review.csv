2016-01-31,3.0,"Stopped in with a Groupon on a Friday night. No problem finding a table. Took notice to the aged and damaged upholstery...in dire need of interior repair. Service throughout was hospitable but flustered and inconsistent. Appetizers of Blue Points and Garlic broth Oysters were good; unsullied and very little grit. King and snow crab legs quenched our thirst (and stomachs) for fresh seafood. After a couple drinks, two apps, and two entrees, the bill landed around $150. IMO, pricey considering it's not Gibson's or Joe's Snow Crab.  The business simply wasn't operating on all cylinders; things seemed to be missing. In totale, I'd have to say I'll be checking in at other seafood destinations before I stop back, but Cy's isn't completely crossed off of my return visit list.",-0.631,0.834,0.05,0.117,0.3432142857142857

2016-01-05,3.0,"While searching Groupon, we came across a $49 for $80 deal. The Yelp rating was 2 1/2 stars so that made us a little nervous, but we decided to check it out anyway.  I bought the Groupon & called for a reservation all in the same day (same hour actually) & when I called the person that answered the phone told me reservations were not needed & we would be fine to come right in. Okay, great. Now I was scared.  Walking in, you're greeted by the lobsters in a tank, telling you to seat yourself. Hahaha. I'm kidding but the lobsters are definitely right there as soon as you walk in.  We sat in the rather large booth that has not been reupholstered in quite some time & had a little stickiness to it. Yep, freaked out by this point (especially when it comes to seafood). Ahh well, what could we do? We were all in at this point.  We started with the blue point oysters & mussels for an appetizer. The blue points were delicious. No grit, shucked well & nice and cold. (Phew, I am starting to ease up a bit!) The mussels were good as well, weird sauce but good, also cleaned well.  For my entree, I chose the combo with king crab, lobster tail & fried shrimp. A while after we ordered, our server cam out to tell me they were out of lobster tail & asked if I wanted to substitute it for something else. When I asked her what I could sub it with, she had to find the owner to give me the answer. He came over to the table & offered me a crab cake for the tail. Really?! Nah thanks, I will take extra king crab.  The food was good, all the seafood was fresh (besides the fried shrimp) & the garlic mashed potatoes were delish!  Give this place a good cleaning, a decor update & faster service and I would be back... until then I will give it a pass. Even with the Groupon, we ended up spending an extra $100.00 - that is an upscale restaurant price . . .and this place is definitely not upscale.",0.9963,0.771,0.192,0.037,0.461290322580645

Clue #2 would have been the fact that the bartender was ONE of the servers. I say ONE because at one point, about 5 different people took or delivered for us. Now this was for a birthday, a joyous occasion, and the 9 of us shouldn't have had such a confusing time at this place. Drinks would come back messed up, some orders got lost, some peoples meals came out waaaaaaay earlier than others. At this point I'm able to look past all this. (After all, they were SOOOOOOO busy with none of their other customers.) Clue #3 was the actual food. The crab legs were bendy and overlooked, the mashed potatoes were cold, and the fried shrimp were mushy and gross. We couldn't believe it. So it comes to saddle up the bill. First we asked  for separated checks, ""No."" Then we asked if we could look it closer and add it up ourselves. This is when our minds were completely blown. One whole page literally said ""drinks"" no quantity, no price, no description. ""drinks"". Thankfully one person pony'ed up the whole bill who we paid back. The server awkwardly comes by for the check WHILE we are still sitting, pauses, and looks at all of us and says ""I'm sorry about everything"" and sauntered off. Wow....

I would venture to say that Cy's has the best oyster prices in the city when you sit at the bar and these aren't some old, reject oysters. They're fresh (really fresh), plump and briny like a good Atlantic oyster should be. The steamed mussel appetizer is also very good. It's a simple recipe and Cy's executes it. Also, their beer prices aren't half bad. No, Cy's can't hang with other upscale seafood joints in the city.

2015-10-17,1.0,"I have NEVER ate at a restaurant and NOT tipped the server...until tonight. This was one of the worse dining experiences I've ever had.  1st of all, I made reservations for 8:45 pm, I arrived on time but was ushered to the bar by someone I believe to be the manager where my husband and I sat for 25 mins...which I didn't understand considering the restaurant that the restaurant was virtually empty, which was wierd for a Saturday night. The manager? Handed us menus as if he expected us to continue to have our meal at the bar. The bartender was nice but the rest of the staff was wierd and confused. As stated in all of the other reviews. 2nd indicator...a guy not sure of his role, poured us water, spilled it on the table and floor and walked away without cleaning is spill, a few minutes later some came and wiped the floor with the cheap napkins that they also gave to us when we had to ask for napkins. It's funny that I did not read the reviews before coming but when I tasted the calamari and the crab cakes, I was certain that they had come out of the freezer, the worse I've ever had, my garlic mash, boxed, the king and snow crabs, rubbery and salty as shit. My butter was congealed after a few mins and I asked the waitress if I could have fresh butter, after 15 mins of me watching her run back and forward to another table and the back, the dismayed look on my face caused the manager? to retrieve butter for me. The busboy? Came over to clear our table and took my husbands plate...which he was still attempting to eat from. To top it off it took a really long time for the girl to bring our check to the point that I had to ask what was going on twice.the manager? Asked me who my waitress was???ummm you have been pacing the floor since I got here, you should know better than me since I rarely saw her! This place needs a visit from the show "" Bar Rescue"".

My boyfriend had the spicy shrimp arrabiata, and I can say it's honestly the best meal I've tried in a long time. Perfect amount of spice and a large portion.

The service is always friendly and attentive, and the owner seems to genuinely care about his clients. The patio is really great in the summer and very cozy, great for large groups that just want to chow down. If you're here ordering steak and chicken, go down the street to Delux and get it there. That being said, yes, there could definitely be some improvements. First, block off that side room when it's not in use, the vibe is empty and creepy. Second, clean up the random stuff lying around - I remember in my walk from the front to the patio I noticed a mini vac, some empty vases, and chairs just shoved into an alcove?

The only reason I'm not giving one star is because our service was good and the restaurant itself was a nice space. But the food was so, so bad. First, there were like 3 things on the menu that were wrong. Um, update your menu. We ordered fried calamari as an app, and we just ... Kept ... Chewing. No flavor. Bad cocktail sauce.

I took my boyfriend there for his birthday and what a mistake.  The server was the worst I've ever experienced.  I don't think it was entirely her fault. It was as if the manager had hired someone with no serving experience and no training and then just set them loose on customers.  The other servers seemed to know what they were doing and even tried to help us out a few times. To highlight just a few of the mishaps: Our server started out by calling us ""kids"", we are in our 30's. She didn't know the menu at all and looked at us with a blank stare when we ordered. She brought us the wrong drinks. She ordered us the wrong food. Everything took forever!!  I could write pages about what she did wrong but I will just move on to the rest of the disaster.  There was an older gentlemen who seemed to be a manager that was basically just pacing around by the server station and the tables (getting in the servers way) and looking awkward.  The food was not good.  I was hoping for a saving grace when we finally got our food but nope. The ambiance and decor is less than desirable, as well. A real shame.  Shame on management for putting someone on the floor who is not ready. I did decide to complain to the manager at the end because it had been 15 min since we had given the server our cc to pay and she had been standing at the register the entire time looking confused. I decided I couldn't hold it in any longer and plus I couldn't wait to get out of there. The bartender came over and made some excuse about having hired her to ""give her a chance"". I'm sorry, but she didn't have a chance without being trained.  She took our drinks off our bill and we finally got outta there.  I have worked in the industry for 10 years, so when I see something this bad, I must say something.

2015-08-03,1.0,"We went back yesterday, we have been there several times. One of the worse experiences we have ever had. We took my mother for dinner, all three of us agreed that it was horrendous, we had a Groupon. We first started with waiting over 5 minutes waiting for someone to sit us, finally walked up to bar and asked if we could seat ourselves. We ordered a coke, club soda, and a glass of Merlot. Merlot came out first and 5 minutes later the other beverages. I ordered 2 appetizers, escargot and 1/2 dz. blue pointes on the half shell. We also at the same time ordered extra lemon and Tabasco sauce before she left the table. Got our blue points, had to ask for plates and cocktail forks plus the lemon and Tabasco sauce. Finally got those. We wait over 20 minutes for the Escargot, we received no bread or anything to eat with them. They served the Escargot in a white ceramic 6 hole Escargot plate with melted cheese on top, so much that you could not see the Escargot, it was horrible. We asked for bread and informed us they serve pita, we did not receive the pita chips until after Randy and my mother were done with their meals. Again we had to ask for more small plates to serve the snails. We had our oysters plate and tray sitting there, I finally stacked them up and had to ask someone to come & get the plates. When my dinner was served with my mom's and Randy's my came with pasta and since I am a diabetic I couldn't eat it, it was the dish as described on the menu, it also looked so unappetizing. The manager (that is who we think it is) came over and I explained I didn't ask for pasta with my meal, offered to take it back and bring it right back, asked him for the prawns. Randy ordered the Grilled Prawns and says it comes: Jumbo shrimp with grilled onions, served with ginger soy sauce...there were no onions. He ordered the sautéed teriyaki vegetables which consist of carrots, onions, green beans, and broccoli, all he got was broccoli. My mother ordered Crab Stuffed Shrimp that was stuffed with crabmeat, you said it all crabmeat, she hardly tasted or saw the shrimp. Last time we were there she raved about the blackened catfish, loved it and wanted to go back. I ordered the Shrimp Scampi which says it was sautéed with garlic, olive oil, white wine, & scallions, it looked like soup and nowhere near Shrimp Scampi. When I said to the manager that is not how it is described on the menu he informed me Shrimp Scampi is served in various ways. We asked for another coke, club soda, and water and we got water but had to ask 3 times for the sodas. The waitress never came back to our table until we asked for our check. The manager was the person that presented the check to inform me he took my dinner off the check, and apologized and asked how everything was, I told him the worse service and meal we have ever eaten there. Our check was for $96.00 before discounts, and our portion was $46.00 but still for what we received and how we were taken care of was totally horrendous. We asked for to go containers and the waitress offered to box them, but every time she was to come back it took her close to 15-20 minutes. Prior to going to the restroom, I asked the waitress for the check and when I came back asked for the check and we still sat for 10 minutes waiting for the check. We got our pita chips after we were done with the Escargot, last visit we got a bowl of that when we were seated. Asked the manager how long the waitress has been waiting on tables and informed him someone needed to still follow her or train her longer. When we left, no one came over to say goodbye or apologize.

Our party of three was only served 2 glasses of water and 2 sets of utensils. I had to ask for a 3rd.  It took an hour to get our food, and the King crab legs were room temperature. Additionally, the shells were soft as though they has been sitting in water all day. They didn't crack at all, making it extremely difficult to get to the meat inside. Upon questioning our waitress, she brought a different waitress who hesitated, then said she was the manager (it appeared as though she was not telling the truth). She fed us some lines about how it depends on the crab and how she didn't know how long they were cooked. Then she brought more crab legs that were hot. Good, right? No! They were just as soft and soggy as the first ones.  The food was horrible. The service was slow.

We just gave up.  The server had no sense of urgency what so ever. As we asked for check the server tried charging us for the entree we didn't order and which we sent back. Manager didn't even come out and apologize after he knew the situation.  We finally got the check fixed to what our original order was.  Will never go back there ever again.  I'm not picky at all.  I work in the food and beverage industry and understand mistakes happen however they were super unprofessional and the food was terrible.  This server would never cut it in my place of employment..DONT GO HERE it's a waste,-0.862,0.858,0.049,0.094,0.4833333333333334
2015-06-16,1.0,"I've never actually been motivated to post a review before but I hope to help others avoid a similar experience. Caveat: this is for the food only and not for service.  I had carry out.  I had a crab cake sandwich and clam chowder - neither of which I could finish.  Their interpretation of a crab cake is liberal at best.  There were obviously a number of filler vegetables in the patty, and the flavor reminded me more of the salmon patties my mom used to make out of canned salmon than anything with fresh crab in it.  The bun it was served on was also ice cold and there was a huge tomato slice almost as thick as the patty itself.  The tomato and lettuce were fresh, I'll give them that.  The clam chowder I could only have a couple bites of.  It was sort of a glutinous texture and was only lukewarm.  I didn't taste much in the way of clam - it was pretty bland overall.  The texture and lack of flavor prevented me from eating more than a few spoonfuls.  I was sad to have wasted money on the order. Overall I was extremely disappointed as I used to live on the east coast and I was hoping to satisfy a craving I've had lately for my favorite foods from back home.  The temperature issues could perhaps be accounted for by the fact that it was carry out - although many restaurants manage to serve lovely temperature-appropriate food that way.  But the flavor and texture issues cannot be attributed to any outside circumstances.  Perhaps the oysters are good there, but it's hard for me to picture going back.  In a city like Chicago, where there are many other options even for seafood, I will not be patronizing this restaurant again anytime soon.",0.9859,0.775,0.158,0.066,0.5135714285714286
2015-06-09,1.0,"I'm not quite sure which was worse - the service or the food... We chose this place as a friend had a $25 gift certificate. However, upon arriving, we noticed that they had a bar special advertising discounted oysters, wings and shrimp, among other things. Unfortunately the coupon could not be combined with the special. Based on the special though, we decided to forego the $25 off to order off of the discounted bar menu. Although we waked into a large ice bucket full of oysters sitting on the bar, we were told by our less-than-customer-service-driven-waitress that the designated oyster shucker had run off to pick up an order and therefore we would have to wait until he returned to place our order. After waiting 15 minutes for her to check to see when he was expected back, she unapologetically advised that she simply didn't know when he would return. (Duh, why should we expect that an oyster restaurant would have the help to open the oysters at peak dinner time!?) It appears that this mystery delivery man was also picking up 50% of the other items on the special menu as they were also out of the wings and hamburgers. Fine. We ordered the shrimp, mussels and a few items off the regular menu. Shrimp was decent, mussels didn't come with bread (all they had was pita after a special request) and the grilled catfish sandwich was one of the blandest items I've ever ordered out.  My friend requested the shrimp scampi sauce with her linguini dish and was told that the kitchen rarely veers off the menu and so if she wanted a different sauce, then she would have to order two different dishes... WTF? No thanks.  We were probably there for a full two hours and it was the longest two hour dining experience of our lives. Not only was the place empty on this Tuesday night (perhaps a total of 10 other people dining), the waitress was no where to be found and when she was waiting on us, we received nothing but sass. I would rather dine at a morgue than have to sit in this restaurant again. The wait staff is completely unprofessional and inattentive, not to mention that the older gentleman (presumably the manager or owner) was constantly waking by our table without acknowledging us, knowing we were completely displeased with our overall experience.

Although I am most concerned with food and service, I do agree with other reviewers that the space is kind of too big, (massive actually) and a bit odd.  They kept most of the decorative elements of the former business, and brought along some of their nautical decor.  The multiple single rest rooms are nice, but it's quite a hike to get there!  The patio out back looks really nice, and I look forward to sipping some Mai Tai's back there once Summer arrives. The food has not changed whatsoever, though.  Still fake butter.  Still mediocre food.  Still painfully overpriced.  I love snow crab.  I don't love it boiled and water logged, which it was on our most recent visit.  It's really gross, to put it mildly.  Sides are limited and sad.  If they haven't changed by now, I fear they never will.  I just wish they'd step up the quality!  I really want to like this place.  The 2 owners (I assume) are always present and appear involved, and are friendly when engaged.  Our last meal was especially horrible though, and I just hate taking chances of it happening again.

The sides were definitely Green Giant bags from the freezer, and the seafood itself was pretty flavorless. The highlight of the night food-wise was the little pita breads they bring you when you first sit down! And last, the price...absolutely outrageous for the quality of food.

I have been meaning to try it out for a while, and finally got an opportunity with my cousin and his friends. They were already seated in a booth and we were quite comfy. Our waitress was pretty nice. We started out with the Hot Combo which was tasty, but you can't really go wrong with fried stuff. I also had the lobster bisque, which was good but not the best I ever had. For my entree, I had the 1 lb. Alaskan King Crab legs which was just ok. The shells were a little soft and the meat wasn't as sweet. The teriyaki vegetables were passable. The prices seemed average.

When walking in we were greeted by a tank full of lobsters and a server who sat us right away. The place was dim and quiet. The booth we were seated at was huge and comfortable. The first thing we noticed was the bar was not a open bar. It looks like it has not been used in forever. When we asked the server she said they did not have there liquor licenses but we could go across the street and get a bottle for 20% off.  So we ordered our food and went and got a bottle of wine. When we came back our server had already set up a wine cooler at our table and the bus boy brought us two wine glasses. I thought that was very nice of both of them. Our food came out quick and it tasted soooo good. My only dislike of the place was it felt like a abandoned banquet hall. A huge space and the only light was on our table. I understand not being able to use the bar but maybe lighting it up or putting any kind of lights around the place would make it feel more comfortable. We did however find it to be a tad romantic because we were the only ones in there. We will be back again.

2014-12-10,2.0,"This place has so much potential but fell flat for my birthday dinner. First off, they do have a really great selection of seafood and the venue is huge! Unfortunately, those are the only positive things I can say about the place. Service was extreemely slow and just not very good. There was way too much time in between ordering our drinks to our appetizers to our main course. The restaurant only had about 5 other customers. I don't understand why or server would disappear so much. She even had to come back a few times to make sure she wrote down the right thing, and blamed it on bad hearing from being in a band in her youth. She wasn't sure of the market prices or if they had Jameson ""because the bar was new."" Then she was surprised with what I ordered because she had never seen it on the menu and continued to just stare at it... Then, there had to be something going on in the  excruciatingly slow kitchen. Our 1/2 dozen oysters app took 20-30 minutes to come out. We had already finished our first round of drinks and got a second by the time it got it to us. After waiting another 20-30 minutes,  my original order of 12pcs of shrimp came out to only be 6pcs. She later told me that they ran out and she could give me what they had left but it would take a while to thaw... The lobster my friend ordered was flavorless and spongy. It made me wonder if the live lobsters in front were only for display.  What should have been a quick dinner, turned into 2 1/2 hours of disappointment.

2014-11-12,1.0,"Where do I start? I went in there last Sunday (Nov 9th) around 7:30pm. We live in the neighborhood and have driven by numerous times and commented to each other how similar the name was to ""King Crab."" We have been long time customers of ""King Crab"" on Halsted for many years and were very disappointed that they closed this spring. When we saw online that ""Cy's King Crab"" on Milwaukee was the same restaurant, we made a bee line to the new location.  The sign above the door is a plastic banner that you would expect to see for a newly opened business. We recognized some of the nautical decorations as we entered, but once we entered, it was confusing what the main decoration theme was.  The walls were dark and several large circular booths were on one wall, a full bar (in size, not in stock) on the other and a huge crystal chandelier hanging from the ceiling. There were maybe 6 other patrons in the restaurant at the time. Three flat screen TV's were mounted on the walls. Later research online revealed that ""Como"" an outshoot of formerly famous ""The Como Inn"" was the first tenant and then ""The Red Canary"" a sports bar was the last. It was clear that the heavy/dark decoration theme was from the ""Como"" and very little has been changed. The nautical pieces placed around the wall gave the impression that the new tenants were not planning on staying long. Kind of like when you move back to your parent's house while your new place is being built. You can put your things out, but don't touch the plastic sofa covers on grandma's furniture.  Our waitress came to get our drink orders. When we asked what vodka's they carried, she screwed up her face and said that they don't have a liquor license yet and they are a week away from getting it. She said we had two options: go to the CVS down Milwaukee or go across the street to the wine store where the owner had an agreement that he would sell us a bottle for 50-60% off the retail price. And then we would be charged a $5 corkage fee. So I walked across to purchase a bottle of white for $19. The owner of the wine shop was very helpful, but no discount was offered even though he knew I was from Cy's. The waitress also said that the owner's had to close the Halsted restaurant due to a new building development and moved here in June. The owner stopped by our table and he related that there were 5 different places throughout Chicago and the north suburbs that were a part of the same restaurant. He said that there used to be 5 partners and now there were only 2 and just this one location.  We ordered our ""go to"" favorite: the crab cakes. I had mine with garlic mashed potatoes and my girlfriend ordered mixed vegetables. When they arrived, it was clear that the patties were burned even in the dark lighting. Flipping them over showed even a darker char. Her vegetables were right out of a freezer bag including huge stems of broccoli and my potatoes were ice cold. The plates were served with a lack of garnish or any attempt to make them appealing. Two machine made patties and a scoop of mashed potatoes.  We complained to our waitress who apologized and took both orders back. My girl friend's order was back in 4 minutes and it was clear that these new patties were not even fully cooked. The inside of the patties were ice cold. We signaled another server to get the owner to come over so we could settle our bill for the appetizers and leave. This was not our normal server and once we told her what was our complaint, she said that today was the cook's second day.  When the owner came over to explain that he was baking us a new order and assuring us that this (our 3rd attempt) would be better as he was making them himself, we asked to settle our bill and leave. He said there would be no charge and we thanked him. We told he that we were told that the cook was new and this was his second day. He asked us who said that. He said his cook has been with him of 15 years. That may be, but not as a cook. Change is good and change is inevitable, but I think this is an end of an era. ""King Crab"" was a ""hole in the wall"" where you could spend a lazy afternoon, eating some of the best fresh seafood in Chicago at an affordable price.  I understand businesses change and owners follow new pursuits. It just seems that the current owners are not into this at 100%. The new location is great, easy parking and in a very active neighborhood. But show some interest in being a fixture of River West as much as you were a part of Lincoln Park. Take ""ownership"" of your new space. Remove the heavy ""Como Inn"" feel and make it look and feel like the warm ocean breeze and salty smell are a part of the eating experience. Or take into another direction, go up scale. Throw out wine barrels and ship's wheel and flat screen TV's. But pick a direction. Pick a theme and go with it. Make us all believe you want to be there and you want us back. It seems like you lost your ""fire."" And I will not be returning.",0.9956,0.869,0.093,0.038,0.4245964811627461

2014-08-19,3.0,"Two stars for the actual experience and a generous third star because they're brand new and going through some of the typical pains restaurants have on their opening. I think my main problem with this restaurant is they just don't seem to have any continuity in their style, menu, ambiance, and decor. The building used to be the Red Canary and they've kept all of the tables and chairs which gives it a very upscale feel. The problem is... this isn't an upscale restaurant. The appetizers are fried shrimp and the entrees are mostly crab, which is messy, fun, and certainly not made for a white linen style dinner. The menu and food want to be a dive but the restaurant is decorated to be upscale and classy. It made for a very odd ambiance. Switch out the white chairs for some wooden bar stools, some new tables, and get rid of the chandeliers and maybe you have something. When you have a low-budget opening, you run into these types of problems. The food menu is limited in variety and quality. If you want crab then this is your place, but if you're going to dinner with people who want something else then you might be out of luck. The appetizers were good and priced appropriately and I can see us coming here just for that. The crab was really good, but the oysters --- oh man these were awful! Whoever was opening them needs some brushing up on his/her technique. There were shell pieces in every oyster and none of the oysters were cut from the muscle. The quality of oysters was poor as well. My bias: I live in the neighborhood and I really, really wanted to LOVE this place. I'm hopeful the can make a few changes.

2014-08-14,2.0,"I'll start with the positives: the restaurant is beautiful and our waitress was great! That's all I got... The place was empty just like either of their other two restaurants on Halsted or Ashland used to be. The appetizers were just cheap frozen fried shrimp and calamari. The snow crab was tasty but the pieces were tiny. The king crab were nice size, but I didn't think they were that great. Two of the people that were with us, ordered the jumbo crab and they seemed to like it. If the place wasn't so slow, I'd give it another star. But even though it was empty, it took forever to get our food. And they don't use a POS system. So when it came time for our party of six to get the check, it took the waitress 10 minutes to add everything up. The restaurant is huge, and I cannot imagine how long it would take when busy.  Just like I remember at cy's on Ashland, the owner is there watching everyone nervously. I feel bad for the guy. You could definitely see the stress on his face running an empty, giant restaurant. And it was super expensive, especially considering we brought our own wine.

Found that they moved and went to the new location. Walked in to a very nice, large, new restaurant with outdoor seating. Only a couple of tables with people there. We were told the outdoor seating was not open, don't know why. We sat down in a room all by ourselves. Looked at the menu and was told that they had no liquor license yet, that they could get us wine across the street. We ordered a bottle, which later we were told we needed to pay for separately so that they could run it across the street. $5 uncork fee for the screw on cap. Waited quite awhile for the wine and even longer for wine glasses. The wine bottle holder was messed up and we needed to prop it up against a chair so it didn't fall over. We asked for more of the little bread bits, service was very slow. Again, this was an empty restaurant! We asked the waitress where the oysters were from, and she didn't know, would have to go to the kitchen and find out. Really? Can you know the menu any less? The crab meat stuffed shrimp was OK, the King crab was over cooked! Your are a king crab house, it should be perfect.  It was there first night at the new location, stuff to work out. We thought we would help them and told a manager about the server who needed quite a bit more training, and apparently so did he. Didn't apologize, try and learn, etc. Just explained our bizarre experience away.  We were there for a birthday and so they brought tiramisu, not so good. Was pricey for what we got, took two hours in an empty restaurant. We will not go back, ever!",-0.5127,0.891,0.043,0.065,0.47981770081770075
