2016-03-12,5.0,"Man o man.  My review was drafted as a celebration, but is now a eulogy.  Tete, o Tete, we hardly knew thee. On a cold winter's day, Tete provided warmth and delicious sustenance. The charcuterie was, in a word, divine.  The three of us had the venison, the pot roast terrine, the pate de campagne, and the beef cheeks.  The venison was thin hard salami and had a wonderful smoky flavor.  The beef cheeks, hubba hubba, the beef cheeks!  So rich with flavor, I will never forget. For our main courses we had the burger and the Italian sausage sandwich as well.  I ordered the Italian out of sadness, for they could not make the French Jamon baguette for me.  Now, I will never know, and so will never be complete.  Even so the Italian was lovely; loaded with giardiniera and the sausage itself was rich and creamy.  Even their ice cream was delicious and effervescent.  Words do not suffice. And the booze, oh the booze.  Songs could be sung of their cocktails. They mixed their Boulevardier with cognac and it was smooth as smooth can be.  And their Improved Martini, with Luxardo?  I tell you truly I wanted to take that drink out for a drink.  It was clear as crystal and simply luscious in the Marie Antoinette martini glass.  The Luxardo was an inspired addition which added subtle layers of flavor.  I can only hope to replicate it at home.",0.9965,0.751,0.229,0.019,0.5394409937888199

2016-03-05,5.0,One of my favorite restaurants in the West Loop! The charcuterie is great but honestly the non meat dishes stole the show for me.  The charred shishito peppers with black bean aioli are the best I've had period.  The maitake mushroom dish is reason alone to check Tete out.  Last time I went the mushrooms weren't on the menu but the chef was kind enough to prepare a dish for me anyways.  The service is phenomenal and everyone is super nice.  These people care about their product and it definitely shows!  Shout out to Anthony who always does a great job recommending new dishes.,0.9921,0.669,0.313,0.019,0.6229437229437229
2016-02-11,5.0,"I went to Tete last night for my birthday. I had never heard of it before, but given the trendy location along Randolph's restaurant row and the fact that they specialize in the major food groups of ""meat"" and ""cheese,"" I knew it had to be good. I can't imagine a better place to celebrate a birthday. From the moment we walked in the door, absolutely everyone was warm, kind, and accommodating, and no fewer than four servers came over to wish me a happy birthday. The table was decorated with ribbons and (in keeping with the theme) tiny plastic pigs; I got a complimentary pour of champagne, and we were gifted a chef-signed custom birthday menu to take home.  And that's all before I've even talked about the food itself, which was incredible. Our server made some great recommendations, and with her assistance, we ordered the Coppa, dry-aged smoked bacon, Pate Bourguignon, shishito peppers, and a selection of four cheeses. The presentation of these items was beautiful and well-paired with mustard, fig spread, grapes, house pickles, candied walnuts, and two types of bread (raisin and rye toasts). When I order charcuterie anywhere, I expect it to come with a tiny pang of disappointment as I see the tiny slivers of cheese and single slices of ham, but this place understood: We are here for the meat and the cheese. Period. The portions were perfect, and nothing was too salty. Everything was balanced and intensely flavorful.  The atmosphere is well-considered, too. For perhaps the first time ever, I was seated beside a bathroom and didn't notice or care, because the smart layout put a solid wall between us and the back hallway where they're located. The acoustics are great for a big place with concrete floors. Lights are just dim enough. It was a zero-degree night but the inside was warm and inviting. Overall, I can't say enough about how welcoming this place was. Can't wait to go back!",0.9957,0.777,0.185,0.037,0.5457983193277312

The service was strangely slow, even though there appeared to be a 2:1 ratio of staff to tables.  When we arrived, we were one of three occupied tables, but yet it still took about 10 minutes after sitting down before we had our drink order taken.  The food was good, but nothing special for the price (we had the small charcuterie plate, beef cheeks app, trout app, hanger steak, and sausage as part of the restaurant week special).  This is just one of those places where I'm sure you could find much better alternatives for the same price.

2016-01-18,3.0,"Had a late dinner here mid week before the holidays. Was very excited because there are few things I like as much as cheese and charcuterie for dinner.   Based on our server's suggestion, we ordered the small board for the two of us because we wanted to try a few other things from their menu too. Although ""small,"" the board included 6 different items and was quite filling. It's all selected by the chef, which I actually liked because the a la carte was overwhelming for a Tete first timer.  We also ordered the cheese board to be served alongside the meats and, again, was surprised at the portion size. The cheese board came with walnut-cranberry toast, which after all of these years of eating cheese it never occurred to me to use a sweeter bread to balance out the cheese flavors. So good! Also ordered:  Heirloom apple salad--really liked the horseradish feta Beef tartare--just ok. This was the most disappointing item for me. Not particularly memorable or special.  Longanisa sausage--loved this! Always a fan of longanisa and this version did not disappoint. Would easily be fine as an entrée portion for one or split between two people as a smaller plate, as we did. Would definitely get this again!  Overall, I thought Tete was ok. I'm looking forward to coming back again in a few months and trying new items, but I'm not dying to get there ASAP. There was a point at which we waited a VERY long time for our next dish so that was kind of weird. Server and hostess were both very friendly. I liked the overall atmosphere. Tete would be great for a group outing, dates, family, but probably not children.",0.9802,0.846,0.133,0.021,0.5034947934947934

The side of mushrooms was very good, although a little overpriced. The sausage and onion was tasty but again, just a little less than you'd expect for the price. I give props to the cocktail menu, which is attempting to be interesting and a little offbeat, but what I got wasn't all that great. Decent-ish beer menu though.

2015-12-25,3.0,"Disclaimer: I didn't have any charcuterie. I don't feel as if I can have a fully fair review without having tried their charcuterie platters, so take this review as you will. I came to Tete for lunch a few days ago and my friend and I both ordered from the ""Sandwiches and..."" portion of the lunch menu. I got the Steak Sandwich and she ordered the Philippines dish. The steak sandwich was a 6 on a scale of 1 to 10. Decent sized, tasty, not anything to write home about, but it was certainly good. I didn't try my friend's dish, but it was comprised of two large longanisa sausages, a little fried rice, and an egg. I looked good, and she seemed to like it, but she said she was disappointed that there wasn't more rice. It seemed like a fairly small portion. Both dishes, along with one Jungle Bird cocktail for each of us (decent, nothing special), our bill came out to $30 per person. Seemed a bit steep for a lunch that left us still slightly hungry. Overall, I would say that my experience at Tete was slightly underwhelming, although I would certainly come back to try the charcuterie boards.

2015-11-20,2.0,"This place is cool. It looks authentic from the outside and has a great, cozy feel inside. Service was great, very informative and appreciated. The food, was just meh. Especially for the price. We started with the small charcuterie plate. It came with a nice variety of pates and sliced meats, even a head cheese. But all of the meat was so fatty. To the point of not really tasting meat. There was a thinly sliced bacon that was SO fatty, it was inedible. Huge disappointment, as they tote the fact that meats are aged in-house, pates are made in-house, etc. All were fatty and lacking that power-punch of flavor. We also ordered the beef tartare and heirloom pear? salad. (BTW, the menu on Open Table is significantly different than that of the one in the restaurant). The beef tartare was off. I almost sent it back. It didn't taste like beef, it tasted like venison. Come to find it was marinated in something that I just wasn't a fan of. The salad was tasty, but could've used some chopping. Giant pieces of endive and greens made it almost impossible to eat without cutting it down to mouth-sized pieces.  My co-eater had the vindaloo with a sausage and cous cous. He said it was good, and didn't save me a bite. :) I was surprised by the small portion size, especially when considered an entree. Then the date cake for dessert which every server favorited. A $10 piece of cake with a scoop of coffee ice cream. Which was a good thing, because the cake was dry. Not a big fan. Based on the food, I probably won't return. Hoping this place takes the advice of its diners to improve or it probably won't last long on Randolph Restaurant Row.",0.9629,0.831,0.116,0.053,0.5668209876543211
2015-11-14,3.0,"My friend and I are huge fans of charcuterie and have been wanting to try this place for a while. We came after work on a Friday night around 6:30 PM and the place was surprisingly empty. The decor is very warm and welcoming and they have an open kitchen, which is always a nice touch since it's fun to see what the chefs are doing behind the scenes. We decided to share a bottle of red wine, the small board of charcuterie, pickled beef cheek, hamachi crudo, and taleggio and truffle  pelmeni. Overall, the meal was a mixed bag. By far, the best dish was their charcuterie board, which was a chef's choice of meats, crusty bread, mustard, and bread and butter pickles. All their meats are cured in-house and they are the only restaurant in Chicago that does this according to our waiter. The meats were very high-quality and was a great start to the meal. However, their other dishes were not standouts in my opinion. My friend liked the beef cheek, but it was too vinegar-y for my taste. The hamachi was nothing special and while I liked the truffle pasta because of the taleggio, you could not really taste the truffle and and my friend thought the quince made it a little too sweet.  Overall, I would return for the chacuterie board (and get a large one!) and skip the rest of their food because it was pretty pricey for the small portions and did not quite hit the spot. Finally, protip - OpenTable has 1,000 pt tables for Tete if you go around 6 PM and a 10% discount off the entire bill if you check-in on Yelp, so be sure to check that out!",0.9876,0.842,0.144,0.014,0.5606296296296296

2015-11-08,5.0,"Situated in the former Meat packing district, Tete Charcuterie is one of many new restaurants trying something new out of the norm.  I went with my folks for my birthday and everything went uphill from the start.  My father got us a reservation and made a note that it was my birthday.  When we got there they led us to our table that was decorated with ribbons and little toy pigs, I then noticed that my menu read ""happy birthday Derek"", so I felt a little special.  We got a small board which is basically letting the chef decide what goes on the board from an option of 15 items.  So you don't know what you are getting until your server comes in and tells you what's on the board.  I loved the meats and I would definitely recommend getting one of their terrines. My favorite dishes from all of the food we got would be a toss between the beef cheeks with pickled onions, or the ""Peking"" duck breast with caramelized cabbage and turnip puree.  The night was topped off with a nice little gift from the kitchen staff when they gave me another copy of the menu with my name on it at the top and signed by the chefs at the bottom.   I would also like to point out that we had a 6:30 p.m. reservation and when we came in it was quiet.  Not all the tables were full and we were unsure if that was a good thing or not on a Saturday.  When 7:15 rolled around the place was packed, there was at least 10 people waiting at the front and the bar was filled to the point that a couple of people had to stand against the wall to get anything.  This place is definitely a must go to if you are open minded and you want to try one of the best Chicago has to offer.",0.9875,0.876,0.118,0.006,0.5549501223414268

The four of us wanted to order the large charcuterie appetizer.  We were told that the chef chooses the items that will be on it.  My wife and I informed the waitress that we do not eat pork and the other couple told her that, while they eat pork, they would prefer it if there is no pork on the board so that the four of us could enjoy all of it.  The waitress just told us that the chef would not do that and there would be pork on the board.  Really? We pay $300 for dinner for 4 and you have that little respect for your guests?  There are many great restaurants in Chicago - several just down Randolph from Tete.  We can go to one of them next time for equally great food but without the attitude.",0.8721,0.914,0.071,0.015,0.46016402116402116

You must order everything at once, which is ok if the pacing ended up making sense and didn't leave us with very long gaps between courses.   I also have a food allergy (I know, I know...) which was inquired about when I confirmed my reservation.  I thought that initial attention to detail meant the staff would be prepared and also were willing to accommodate.  Sadly, this was met with more awkwardness, waiting longer for our food,  and I left feeling guilty for the imposition.   This restaurant is incredibly expensive, which is ok, but usually indicates a superior level of service that just wasn't there. I REALLY wanted to love Tête Charcuterie, but I don't think I'll be going back...even for the duck rillettes...which was mind-blowingly good!!!  ***To the credit of the management, I think they were aware of how much they had botched our service and ended up comping us some wine.

Once you sit down and see the menu I'll admit you can get a little overwhelmed.  The front page is mostly a la carte charcuterie items.  We couldn't settle on what we wanted so luckily there was a chef's choice board where you get a little of everything.  We tried the lamb pate, head cheese(with an open mind it was actually pretty good), chorizo, prosciutto, and nice toasty bread.  It was solid, meats had bold flavors and the presentation was spot on.   We also tried a little but from their sausage menu with the Polish sausage and goat cheese Pierogi.  My wife and I have had our share of Pierogi in our day and I'll say it was good but nothing you couldn't get if you grabbed a few boxes of them at Alexandrias on Central.  Same with the sausage but they were cooked perfectly so can't complain there. The steak though was amazing. I didn't ask but I would've guessed they sous vide cooked it because it was prefect and evenly cooked on the inside.  It was some of the best steak I've ordered in a while.   Overall I'd definitely recommend Tete Charcuterie.  Come in with an open mind and try some meats you might not ever have eaten.  Only thing though is that there wasn't a draft beer list but I guess I'm nitpicking there.",0.9921,0.854,0.138,0.008,0.528639846743295

My friend and I shared six savories; no duds and four were phenomenal (smoked bacon, Filipino sausage with shrimp fried rice, summer salad and charred shishito peppers). The beef tartare was the weakest;  photogenic presentation and decent, but the flavor was lacking and overall was a forgettable course. The menu is meat-centric, but ordering at least a couple of veg dishes is a must - they were amazing. Everything featured beautiful presentations, high quality ingredients and was well executed. While not an inexpensive meal by any means, prices seemed reasonable.  The space itself is aesthetically pleasing and comfortable and there is a nice beverage program to compliment the meal.  Though service certainly was not a disaster, there were enough gaffes to weaken the overall dining experience and should not occur at this price point; the surface of our table was rather sticky, four of our six dishes arrived within a minute of one another resulting in a rushed experience and cluttered table, no description of the dishes' components provided when delivered, bussers were overly aggressive at trying to remove dishes before (or immediately after) they were consumed and at no point were soiled utensils or dirty plates refreshed.  On a positive note I was seated even though I arrived prior to my friend (it is a pet peeve of mine to be made to wait to be seated unless a venue is packed or it is a large party with multiple people missing), water glasses were frequently replenished and the primary server was helpful making recommendations and advising on how much to order without trying to upsell.

Today is not an exception.  Saw people sitting on the patio at 4:45 while walking home and thought - Yay! - I'll stop in for some wine and something to eat.  I politely asked the two females at the hostess station if they were open and got a curt ""no"" - not until 5.  I asked about the people already sitting outside.  They both looked out, scowled and  one said ""no clue -- ""they were here when I got here"".  Here's a suggestion to the owner.  Train your staff to be accommodating and friendly.  I would have happily sat down with a glass of water  to look at the menu and waited 15 minutes for a server.  Instead I felt like I was an uninvited guest at a party.   It's a shame that a place 3 blocks from my home is not exactly leaving me with a warm and fuzzy feeling considering how much I spend eating out.  Hopefully this doesn't fall on deaf ears.  If they check my reviews they should see that I am a foodie that is very positive about my experiences when I post on Yelp.  This is a low mark for me. Scott - This incident did not occur on the phone.  I was physically in the restaurant.  The people outside were having a drink.  They were definitely not staff.

We started with some cocktails and the small board (good for two people) - a collection of meats selected that day by the chef and some toasty bread, good mustard, and sliced pickles.  My favorites on the board were the chicken pate and one of the cuts of meat.. apologies I have no idea what it was, all I know is that it was DELISH. After the meat board, we decided to share the late spring vegetable dish (chanterelles, spring peas, pea pods, swiss chard) which was refreshing, the roasted maitake mushrooms (one of my favorites - SUCH amazing flavors), the middle-eastern sausage with israeli couscous, samosas, and shaved cauliflower), and the hanger steak (perfectly cooked and sliced, served with potatoes and delicate shallot cups). Everything we had was really delicious.  The service was friendly and attentive - I think there were only two servers for the whole restaurant when we were there, and they got the job done, and got it done well.  My review really is 4.5 stars (Yelp we really could expand to the 1/2 star scale, I'm just sayin) - only because the food is pretty pricey for the size you get.  But the quality is golden and the flavors spot on. **Side note - and nothing towards my review or opinion about Tete at all; there was a family (mom, dad, maybe grandpa or older gentleman coworker, and two little boys) seated a bit behind my table, the parents completely let their kids ROAM WILD around the restaurant and on the patio outside.  I get it, parents need to have their nice dinner dates too, but PLEASE do not let your kids roam around molesting other patrons, we are paying just as much to have a nice dinner (and I'm not trying to order my charcuterie with a side of kid okay?). At one point, the smaller boy walked right out the front door and around the corner on the street - he was maybe 2 and a half.  The hostess had to run out the door to usher him back in the restaurant.  And the whole time the parents sat and ate and drank and didn't even notice.

Having too much in the starter course wouldn't of been too big of a deal except for the fact that the waiter insisted that we order everything at once so we had a ton more food coming.

2015-05-09,5.0,"I'm ecstatic about this place. A friend and I made a reservation to come here for dinner today, and it was definitely worth the trek out here from Evanston. The restaurant itself has a very hip, modern rustic vibe that emphasizes the quality and freshness of the food (you get a peek at the preparation, and there are cured meats hanging behind the bar) but still has a very clean look. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there around 5:30, but people started trickling in around 6.  Service was great; our waiter was friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the menu. We decided to share a small charcuterie board and an order of the Moroccan sausage; my friend also ended up ordering the beef cheek salad, which I sampled as well. First, the board. My friend has a nut allergy, so we substituted the pâtés that had nuts in them. We got a selection of about 5 different pâtés and cured meats, along with 4 pieces of wonderfully crusty bread. My favorite was the fromage de tête (head cheese); it melted in my mouth and had an amazing deep pork flavor and soft, creamy texture. My friend particularly enjoyed the prosciutto, which was buttery and smooth. Overall, the entire board was delicious and well-portioned; we didn't get sick of any of the options but had enough to be able to really taste the flavors. The sausage was my favorite part of the meal. Served alongside fava beans, some grains, a yogurt dressing, and spinach, the lamb sausage was super flavorful and hearty. All the flavors blended well, and I felt like I had been transported to Morocco. If you've ever had a lamb gyro, imagine that in sausage form, but more flavorful! Finally, the beef cheek salad. Based on the name alone, I was reluctant to even try any of it, but it actually tasted very delicious and not at all like I had expected. My friend described it as ""smooth and sultry,"" and I agree--there was some kind of vinegar dressing that really brought out the deeper flavors of the beef. The meal ended up coming out to around $50 for the 3 plates, which is a bit pricey for a dinner but good value considering what we got to try. I would honestly come back every day for the Moroccan sausage--but it's such a trek out to this part of town! We were surprised that after the meal, though we felt full and satisfied, we didn't feel overly greasy or gross like we would have expected after eating a meal of basically meat; I think that is a testament to Tete's expert preparation and flavor and texture combinations. I will definitely be coming back, but until then, I'll be dreaming of my Moroccan sausage!",0.9989,0.742,0.229,0.029,0.567386018237082

Amazing texture and taste, yet not overly salted. -Philippines sausage/longanisa: one of my best friends is Filipino, and his mom always make us longanisa when I come over. Needless to say, I'm pretty biased since I'm accustomed to having authentic, home-made longanisa and I was pretty skeptical when we ordered this dish. However, the longanisa here is on-point. I'm sure my friend's mom would give her stamp of approval. The longanisa comes w/ fried rice and a farm egg - be sure to crack the farm egg over the rice and longanisa and mix it all together! -Pickled beef cheek salad: like other Yelpers have stated, this was amazing. Thin slabs of beef cheek w/ just the right amount of pickling -Shishito peppers: these were ok, definitely something you can skip if you're borderline on whether or not you want to order it -Lemon pound cake with sour cream ice cream: this was a great way to end the night. The pound cake was soft and moist, and the ice cream was rich and flavorful. A great place to go with a group of friends or to bring a date (half the restaurant seemed to be either a big party or on a date). I'm definitely coming back to try some things I didn't get to try (like the lardo)",0.9981,0.721,0.259,0.02,0.6040450588837688

Came here on a Thursday night for a late dinner and 4 of us shared 6 dishes (one was the large charcuterie board, which should count as at least two) plus one dessert and after 2 drinks each, felt fully satisfied. The large charcuterie board had a mixture of cured meats and spreads with pickles and mustard and breads. The shishito peppers were great but weren't as warm temperature wise as they could have been. The Brussels sprouts with bacon were especially tasty. Pickled beef cheek salad was fresh and I wish it were bigger. The Filipino sausage was the clear winner with just enough spice and sweetness. The main thing we all agreed upon was the dishes were brought out way too quickly. Granted we got there at 9 and they closed at 10 but we didn't feel like we got to enjoy each dish thoroughly because they all came out at the same time.

The host (we'll get to him later) pushed us to the bar where were we ""greeted"" by the bartender who treated our group like we were beneath him. My friend asked for Baileys and he snickered at him and said ""Ugh, we don't have THAT."" I guess Bailey's isn't artisanal enough. He completely ignored us for 20 minutes but made sure to converse with his two hipster buddies at the end of the bar every chance he had. We ordered drinks and after recommending a $30 dish to my fiancee the bartender claimed that he couldn't serve her. She had had 2 glasses of wine all night at this point. I immediately closed my tab and left. Also of note, when the cook saw the ticket come into the kitchen she said ""WHAT THE F***!"" aloud because apparently she wanted to go home too.   On the way out, I informed the host that the staff was very rude and unprofessional and he mocked me by saying ""Ooooooo!"" with his hands up.",-0.7598,0.864,0.058,0.078,0.4888492063492063

I absolutely loved the beef cheek salad and it was probably my favorite item although for some the name may be off putting.  It is the most tender meat you'll ever have and goes great with the onions, capers and parsley.  Get it - this is the dish that will make me come back as soon as possible. We split a small board of charcuterie which was plenty for us 4. They give you a chef selection (unless there is something you must try or must not have).  They were all good but a pork belly piece was my favorite - melted in your mouth good.  We also tried two sausages: Germany and Morocco.  I loved the lamb (Morocco) and probably would pass on Germany the next time to try something new, but it was still very good.  We also split the hanger steak and duck entrees.  Both were perfectly cooked and had so much flavor, but my favorite would be the hanger steak.  Yummy.  Service was good although for a place like this I would expect excellent. The bartender was excellent and made me a cocktail that I wouldn't have picked off the menu after I answered some of his questions.  He was helpful and very knowledgeable.  Our waitress was good.  She knew the menu well and made sure we ordered enough but not too much food (you put in your whole order at once and they course it out).  There was just something of the extra touch that other places do that was missing.",0.9973,0.763,0.228,0.009,0.5838204626914304

2015-02-06,1.0,"I would never go back to this place. First of all, the regular menu and restaurant week menu posted online were completely different than the menus at the restaurant. Three friends and I went to dinner for restaurant week and tried their tasting menu. The first thing we were told was that if one person ordered off the tasting menu, everyone had to. I've been to several other restaurants for the tasting menu and this was not the case. Next, we ordered wine and while our glasses were brought out immediately, the wine didn't come for another 15 minutes after that. Following that, my friend ordered the hanger steak and the wait told her that tonight they were offering truffle shavings on the steak. What he failed to mention was that the truffle shavings were an additional $35 which was more than the entire three course tasting menu. Luckily I had looked at the menu online prior to that and saw it was $35 but my friend didn't know this and had said yes. About a half and hour later, the manager came up and told my friend it was $35 extra. It was clear that the manager had done this because someone else had obviously been shocked when they got a $35 additional charge to their receipt. For most, we know truffles are expensive but don't go around offering truffle shavings like you would pepper on a salad if you're not going to include the fact that you're charging more for the truffles than the entire menu. We're not talking about a $3 additional fee here. To continue on, we waited at least 30 minutes between each course. By the time we were served our main course, no one was even hungry because we had waited so long. There were at minimum 8 chefs cooking so there was no reason for the food to take so long to come. Not to mention the fact that all of our food came out at different times. I'm not talking a minute or two...almost ten minutes went by between the time one person at the table got her first course and the other three of us.  I ordered the salad as my first course and requested no blue cheese in it. I was told aggressively that that was not possible. There were no substitutions.  How hard is it to leave cheese out of a salad? I then ordered pasta as my main dish, and I have honestly had better pasta from the Olive Garden, which I think is also terrible. It was bland and tasteless. The waiter didn't come back one time to check on us throughout our meal and the restaurant was half empty. I think that's enough said being the fact that it is a Friday during restaurant week. Where was everyone and why was the service so terrible if it was only half full? I for one will not be returning and I will be sure to make my fellow foodie friends aware that this restaurant is no gem. With all the other fabulous restaurants in Chicago, I can't see this one lasting.",0.9268,0.856,0.081,0.063,0.436954156954157
2015-01-26,5.0,"I dined at Tête Charcuterie on a Saturday night in January 2015. The combination of service, acoustics and incredible food made the experience so much fun. Throughout the night I had great conversations with the bartender, server (Matt), Thomas (chef and partner), Kurt (chef and partner) and Michelle (general manager). Everyone was so warm and genuine. I had a fantastic evening here and encourage anyone who appreciates food created and plated with intention (the plates are stunning) to make a reservation immediately. I'll start with the service: having a drink at the bar was a great experience because you can see the refrigerator of charcuterie. The bartender is incredibly knowledgable about the dinner menu, as well as his drink menu. Matt, a lean, salt and pepper haired server took care of us at the table. He was relaxed and casual yet passionate about the food and wine. I appreciated his no-bullshit style of service. You can tell he loves working there.  Highlight dishes throughout dinner: the Shishito peppers (I'd say they're much better than the ones I had at Girl and the Goat a few days prior); Arctic Char; Winters Garden (even if you don't usually order vegetables- get this for the table. It's unreal); Peking duck (beautifully done) and obviously a charcuterie board.  Throughout the rest of the night I had the privilege to meet the chefs and GM. Often times it's nerve wracking to say something to a chef, but talking to Kurt and Thomas I felt totally at ease, one passionate eater to another. The chefs stand on the line of the open kitchen building each dish as the sous chefs pass them the individual parts. The kitchen is open so you can see the whole thing. I recommend getting up and walking over there to witness this. I've never seen a brat look so beautiful. They take extensive care in each dish - something to marvel at.  A mistake happened along the way and one of the dishes we ordered (the Philippines) never came. A blessing in disguise because we ordered a lot of food. I mentioned this to Thomas as he passed by the table and he said ""well we're making you one to take home, on me."" Michelle, the GM brought it over, introduced herself, and spent some time getting to know us. Fyi, the Philippines makes an amazing breakfast :)  I left feeling incredibly satisfied, excited to have some new friends, and wanting to tell all my friends to go.",0.9974,0.777,0.203,0.02,0.5913101604278074

The Charcuterie plate came with 5 different types of meet, all different kids - was very fun to try them all. They were served with 4 slices of toasted bread, pickles & mustard. We ate pretty much everything and decided it was time to order more.  Wagyu beef charcuterie - delish but probably not worth the price. Could have skipped this. Steak Tartare - delish but was not served with bread... like what? And then when we asked for more bread, they said no problem but brought the same kind that we had with the Charcuterie & cheeses. Would have loved to have a different kind of toast, something more buttery here. Brussel Sprout Salad - good but I feel like there was not even enough brussel sprouts - frisee salad was more like it. Cheese Plate - this had goat, sheep & cow cheeses - delish. I wish we had gotten this to go with the small plate that we had originally ordered. They seem to hide the cheese on the menu - or at least I didn't see it after first glace - they really want you to focus on the namesake: CHARCUTERIE!

We had dish after dish of things named as if there were charcuterie...but they all tasted fresh (not gross fresh like flesh recently from the quivering carcass) but fresh as in clean distinct flavors of the animal celebrated.  The food is thoughtful - and creative and never forgets to be delicious. Service and ambiance were both super-satisfying as well (and the drinks - yes - the drinks were fun).

The food was excellent, but our server really deserves the bulk of the credit for our great experience. He asked us to trust him, and he really gave us the best of what the menu had to offer.  And he respected our wallets too by choosing wines that superbly complemented the food but didn't break the bank.   Just go.

2014-09-04,5.0,Very rarely can you find a dining experience where from the moment you walk in until the time you walk out is flawless.  Each dish just made sense - every ingredient seemed to have a place. The duck entree especially stood out.  Service was perfect. Our server made very clear recommendations with food and wine and I would literally go back and blindly just have her set my drinking and dining experience for me.  You can tell Tete is still new - they try really hard. The GM checked in and gave us his card. Our server was always around - one time telling me to put the bottle down so she could serve us. But it genuinely felt like everyone wanted us to have a good experience - less so we would go back and write a rave review - more so just because they genuinely seemed to care about the experience for the audience.

2014-09-02,5.0,"I cannot say enough about how this place continues to exceed my expectations.  I've eaten at Tete four times now and each time I'm just more and more impressed by the quality and creativity being presented to me for each meal. No comfortable/casual establishiment  in Chicago right now has as ambitious of a menu as what I'm seeing at Tete and I'm definitely including the Publican/PQM/Avec in this mix. Granted Tete's menu offerings per course may be smaller than what you'll find at the above, what you get is a cut above both gastronomically and intellectually.  The terrines are both thoughtful and beautiful. When you think of ""en croute"" I often think of oil-soaked puff pastry but the terrine in this case is encased in a loaf of bread and cut to resemble a piece of white sandwich bread, which is a terrific American riff on a classic. Also had the chicken/tomato terrine which had stunning color and delicacy. From a taste standpoint though, the country terrine/pate is amazing; really savory. The showstopper though? The tomato terrine appetizer. Compressed tomatoes with microgreens and a Parmesan crisp; they're take on a caprese and I'll never want the original.  Sausages here are plated. That means you don't just get a sausage on a plate, nor on a bun. Each sausage dish is an intricate, unique plate with appropriate, accouterments made especially to go with that sausage. Sausage is tender but the casing snaps exactly as it should. This place could specialize solely in sausage and do well, but they don't stop here... Small plates are innovative and draw from multiple international influences. Try the Pork Rillons with XO sauce. I cannot get over this dish. Two sizeable symmetric pieces of sous-vide and grilled pork belly served with a pot of a special sauce made of dried scallops, dried shrimp, bacon, and garlic. A Jew's nightmare, but everyone else's dream. Sleeper hit: Summer Garden. The only critique I have of this place is that they menu description of this dish doesn't allow the eater to truly get a sense of the magnificence of this dish, which honestly, is fine by me b/c I don't mind being the one who feels special enough to be in the know. But here goes...52 different pieces of vegetables prepared perfectly and in varied ways...some sauteed, some grilled, some dusted in various salts, etc. A stunning piece of multi-colored modern art, served in a cast iron staub serving dish.  This review as written above is for the food, but I could write several more paragraphs on the stellar service here, which has been at the highest ends of both familial and professional. A very nice, open space with full view of the hot and cold lines/kitchen. Patio seating available. Excellent dessert, which is uncommon for places that already do excellent dinner. Nothing more that I could ask for.    Cannot say enough about this place. I wanted to keep it a secret, but it's time they destroy the hype for Au Cheval and the Publican.",0.9971,0.809,0.161,0.03,0.552698412698413
2014-08-28,4.0,"This place was pretty solid,  but had a few hiccups in my opinion. Let's start with our food of choice: Avacado gazpacho Pork belly rillon Small charcuterie board  So, for two of us, this was definitely plenty of food! We started with the gazpacho, which came with avocado tempura.  The gazpacho itself was very flavorful & delicious. .. the tempura on the other hand had absolutely no seasoning whatsoever,  that was pretty disappointing.   The pork belly rillon was delish as well, BUT they served it with this bacon & saffron oil stuff that I didn't really care for. It was spicy and overpowered the taste of the belly.  Not a bad dish but they can skip that saffron oil stuff,  Yuck!  Anywho.. moving on. . The small charcuterie board was good.  I wish I could tell you what we actually ate.. the chef chooses what meats you get on a whim, unless you are specific about not wanting something.   All in all it was a good meal.  Very limited wine list though & not your everyday pinot grigio pick either.  So be prepared to try something new.",0.954,0.741,0.172,0.087,0.4908060193774479
2014-08-26,4.0,Charcuterie by definition are cold cured meats or a place that sells them. That's what TETE is about and they do it very well. Cured the meats perfectly and serve them in a very appealing and indeed entertaining and professional manner. For food lovers without diet limits. Would get five stars except for the price. Too expensive on some items( 2 scallops $28.00!) otherwise would be 5 star.,0.9214,0.82,0.18,0.0,0.6357142857142856
2014-08-20,4.0,"Vegetarians beware!  There's a new place in town that caters to the smoked meat carnivore that lives in many of us and it's name, while sounding cute and light is anything but! In all seriousness- if you like chacuterie, you need to check this place out as it isn't just a starter here, it is the main event!  We had a group of 5 so we had an opportunity to taste a wide range of the menu. The large chacuterie board came with a range of meats, some pickles and some great crunchy bread.  You don't have a choice of what comes so if I were to do this again- for the price ($46) I'd probably go a la carte and order more of what I like from the cured meats section of the menu and pass on some of the terrines as they were not the favorite of those at our table. Another surprise for the cheese lover in our group is that they only have 1 cheese each day.  So if you are the kind of person who like cheese with your chacuterie, you may be disappointed.  On the day we were there, it was a robust goats cheese blue which was a little much for most at our table. The other thing I didn't like (but that' a personal preference) was a dish that our server said that Tete was the only restaurant in Chicago serving it.  I honestly don't remember what it was called but it came looking like a sausage in a terrine inside some bread (we joked and called it the ""turducken"" of sausage)  Just not my thing but you may like it. The winners of the evening were some of the sausages and the only vegetarian dish in the place which was called the ""Summer Garden"".  This beautifully presented dish included 50 different fruits and veggies so artfully arranged that it looked like a painting.  There were even flowers on top of it.  The sausages that we liked best were the ""United States"" which was a take on a hot dog, the Morocco which tasted like lamb (?) and the table favorite was the Philippines which when stirred together tasted like a flavorful fried rice dish!  The roast duck was also a table favorite as was the pickled beef cheek salad. If you've come to drink- you also won't be disappointed.  They have a specialty drink list with Matt, bartender extraordinaire, mixing up some really tasting concoctions.  He's also just a really nice guy and left a great first impression of the restaurant.  I had the Tete a tete which was their take on a Moscow Mule and was delicious!  There is also a solid wine list and some limited beers. Would I come again?  Sure.  But probably not for an entire dinner of meat, more likely for a glass of wine and a small tasting board.  It would be a great place for a date or a place to meet up with friends.  The ambiance is casual and there is outdoor seating along Randolph.  And the servers are so knowledgeable about the meats here that you leave almost feeling like you've had a lesson in cured meats. So if meat and share-able plates are your thing, you are going to love Tete Chacuterie.  But here's a hint . . . .leave your vegetarian friends at home.",0.9989,0.752,0.21,0.038,0.628685026557367

Reasonable valet parking is offered, though we lucked out and found free street parking around the corner. We ordered: Small board- a very good amount of food, especially for only 2 people.  I think the variety changes daily.  There were some we really, really enjoyed and others that were just ok- but fun to try such a variety. Beef cheek salad- excellent.  The meat was so tender and the flavor was great but not overpowering. Summer Garden- Very beautiful and interesting combination of vegetables.  People were losing their minds about this in other reviews, however, which I don't totally understand after trying it.  It felt good to eat such a variety of colorful and different vegetables, especially to balance out all the meat courses, but I wouldn't go rushing back just for this.   Philippines sausage- Much more than just a sausage- came with rice, egg, and seasonings.  Very hearty and also extremely delicious. Overall, for two people with some drinks and a very good quantity of food (left full but not uncomfortable), it wasn't a horrible value at ~$130.  I am glad I went but not sure I'll be rushing back soon.",0.9957,0.737,0.234,0.029,0.5809874492432633

When I saw that Tete had opened, I couldn't wait to get through those doors to try out all of the pates and fromage de tete that they had to offer. So I finally made it there last Friday and was super satisfied with what we ordered. We started off with their small board. The dried salumi, prosciutto, mortadella, and rosette de lyon were perfect. Salty, fresh, delicious. We were also hoping that their pate bourgignon would show up on the planche and we were happy to find out that it was! It had such a great twist and turn of flavors. Pistachios, cassis, mushrooms, and pork. You could really taste all of the flavors coming through in each bite. Sweet, rich, but also delicate. You didn't even need bread to eat it (although the bread did look fantastic). We also tried the pickled beef cheek salad, which might have been my favorite thing that we ordered. Shaved super thin, the beef cheek went perfectly with the onions, capers, and parsley in a pickled sweet mix. And finally, to get some fiber in our meal, we ordered the summer garden, which had a wide array of vegetables in herbs and butter/oil. They were so flavorful and, despite not even knowing what some of the veggies were, we ate them all up just to savor those spices.  Uh yeah, I'll definitely be going back.

The rudest  part of it is that she does this right where we could see her make the comments, make faces and point to our table. That was beyond unprofessional. The manager tried to make up for it by giving us a ten dollar card to be used for the next visit, and by taking the non-gluten free meal off our bill and I commend him for that.

2014-06-24,3.0,"With a name like Tete Charcuterie, I don't think other reviewers should have been surprised that this restaurant is serving mostly meat.   The service was highly personable and attentive, almost over-attentive with one of the owners coming around after every dish was brought out to ask how we were enjoying it.  On the other hand, it was nice to be pampered and attended to with such care. When I asked for a wine recommendation, the server offered to have me taste one first and accommodated the wine to make a kir royale for me - this was very refreshing service.   The outdoor seating area is also very nice and its location in the West Loop is one of my favorite neighborhoods - not too crowded yet has a lot of character.  This place feels like an intimate, ""neighborhood"" restaurant rather than a busy, overcrowded and overrated restaurant. Being a charcuterie fan, being middle-aged and having had the pleasure of eating in Paris, Belgium, Germany and Austria, I know what good, European charcuterie tastes like. The charcuterie at Tete was very good and reminded me of my food experiences in Europe. The duck rillette was not a true potted meat in that it lacked the fat and typical dense texture of rillette. However, it was delicious and had a floral, citrus flavor.  We tried the ""summer garden"" which is essentially roasted vegetables.  Very good but overpriced for a plate of veg.  Roasting farmer's market type vegetables with herbs is not difficult but making exceptional, European style sausages and charcuterie - now that takes talent and skill.  The Boudin Blanc exceptional - juicy, flavorful and melted in your mouth. I could have had about 3 more. The ""cured"" fluke was also very good and had wonderful texture and flavor.  Thepork belly was like a giant lardon and it was rubbery and lacked flavor. It had an Asian ""sauce"" and was coated in an Asian type spice - it didn't seem to pair well and the lardons were not cooked so that the fat was crispy - instead it was rubbery.  Wasn't crazy about their attempt to be global with the Asian and Indian dishes and wasn't sure why they were going in that direction.  They should focus their menu on what they've named their restaurant: charcuterie.

Oh Spring Garden salad, how do I love thee?...let me count the ways: 1) arrives in a warm iron skillet 2) artfully arranged like a Monet painting 3) sits on a brushstroke of pureed pistachio & ramp sauce with a hint of curry 4) a marvelous melange of vegetables, fruits and herbs 5) a feast for the eyes 6) seemingly plucked straight from the garden 7) just for my enjoyment 8) is much too precious to share 9) was so memorable I called my boyfriend & told him to fly to Chicago immediately 10) THE BENCHMARK for which all future salads shall be judged  Chef Tom's brilliant creation cannot be duplicated and I am only in Chicago for the weekend.

I feel this place may be a hair pricey, I will most likely stop by and hit the bar for a small board and a beer before I drop a bunch of money on a multi coarse experience, but I am cheep that way.  In its price range it is certainly as good as anyone out there, A few tweaks of the entree's will go real far in taking the next step.",0.9957,0.748,0.201,0.051,0.572106227106227
2014-05-02,2.0,"2.5 stars I was super excited to try Tete, it's a great concept and perfect for 3 food-loving girlfriends.  Disappointing.  I am pretty confused by all these 5 star reviews and pretty disappointed in yelp for pointing me astray.   Our group of 3 ordered a small board - 2 pates and 3 cured meats, the Philippines sausage, beef cheeks salad and sweet breads.  Our server said it was fine to order the board without any chicken products but she still brought a chicken liver pate out.  Then tried to convince us there was ""no chicken in the chicken liver pate...""   Oh lord.   All 3 pates were quite good, but the cured meats were such minimal amounts, it felt like a joke. One of them was literally 4 pieces of quarter sized salumi (except thinner).  The Philipines sausage which is everyone's favorite tasted exactly like a milder chorizo, with no hint of green garlic or dried shrimp in the dish whatsoever.  It was fine...but certainly nothing to rave about. The sweet bread is $18 for 2 pieces...that's not an appropriate size or portion anywhere and should be an appetizer rather than an entree.  The pickled beef cheeks salad just tasted of pickles...fairly flavorless otherwise.   One of my friends had read about the great dessert and we ordered it at the beginning of the meal but after our very lackluster meal, we cancelled the dessert when the server told us she hadn't put it in yet.  PERFECT!  We ended up down the street at La Sardine for souffles and chocolate mousse.  It was a welcomed delicious ending to a very disappointing dinner.    p.s. we each had a wine and a cocktail, they were fine. Nothing memorable...just fine. p.p.s. THEY CHARGE FOR BUTTER.  We still ordered it.  It's a quarter sized pat of cold butter.  I mean...it was fine....tasted like fresh butter.  Worthy of $4?? I think not.",0.9962,0.72,0.228,0.052,0.7023509223509223
2014-04-28,4.0,"going here is like going on a trip to see other crazy meat people  just like you who are into cured meats and specialty items and where you can get up on your chair and shout in amazement, "" yes I just ordered veal sweetbreads . What do you want to do about that ""? I know people who have been here and they have enjoyed themselves tremendously. I myself had the aformentioned veal sweetbreads while trying not to think about what it really is :) The staff is very knowledgeable about their menu. My server whose name was either Angelina or Angelia or Angela ( one of those) had a understanding of what the menu provided which is much appreciated when going to a specialty meat place that serves cocktails as well. My only complaint would be that there were only two pieces of veal sweetbread. Maybe have 3 or 4. Its just a suggestion. Will most definitely come here again. If you are friends with people who are cured meat fanatics this is for sure the place to take them too.",0.9783,0.808,0.168,0.024,0.6188492063492063
2014-04-21,4.0,"The rating should really be 4 1/2 stars but since I cannot give that it is going to have to be 4.  First off all the service was amazing, Dodie was really great and recommended some great dishes. Drinks: I ordered a gin gimlet and it was fantastic.  They had a usual list of special drinks, all of them looked pretty solid.  Along with that they did have a very nice selection of wine as well. Appetizers:  The Duck Riollet was AMAZING nothing left to say about that.  The small Charcuterie plate was again pretty great, and would be a fun dish just to have with a bottle of wine.   Fish Course: Cooked to perfection, and the small edible greens really helped the dish.  Overall my Second Favorite dish of the evening. At this point the owner Daniel stopped by our table introduced himself and really seemed to care.  Very nice guy and well appointed front man.  He also gave us a complimentary smoke bacon meat slices.  Which he stated should be out on the menu in the next week or so.  I am really excited for this. Main Course: The Pork belly, well okay you really can not mess this one up however this is also why I am not giving 5 stars is the Japanese chilli's they used literately set my mouth on fire and kind of ruined my tasted for the night.  I wish some one would have said something about this so be fore warned to use sparingly. Pasta Plate: Since my mouth is still on fire I can say that the pasta tagliatelle really did help calm it down and was a very good dish.  I actually would take this to go on a cold Chicago evening to help stay warm.   Dessert:  This also is where I have a slight issue, is that when I stated I wanted some I was given no reading of them just brought out a dish.  In the future I may actually want to see my choices or at least hear them.  Even if it is just the one.  However what was brought out to me was dyno-MIGHT I easily could have eaten another two of the date cake.  Coffee ice cream on top of Carmel sauce and of course cake but seriously just perfect. All in all I am definitely going to go back and would recommend this place as a great go to spot.  Another plus side note is that the whole kitchen is open so you can see everything the army of chef's are doing.",0.9991,0.679,0.277,0.045,0.48723869421982635
2014-04-20,5.0,"Great space. Good cocktails. The Halibut was outstanding. But, the charcuterie was definitely the star. The beef cheek salad was outstanding. Carpaccio on steroids even. Nice open kitchen. Great service and the Chef/owner was a delight to chat with. I'll be coming back. Cheers.",0.9856,0.518,0.482,0.0,0.6499999999999999
2014-04-19,5.0,"The house chacuterie board is the perfect starter. The à la carte menu is an excellent pairing to the star, house cured meats, patê and terrines. We tried the beet salad (a new twist) and the tagliatelle. Both were phenomenal. The date cake, butterscotch and coffee ice cream were the most excellent end to an already fantastic progression. This is exactly the type of restaurant that Chicago doesn't have but needs and wants. Congrats Tête! Welcome!",0.9554,0.788,0.212,0.0,0.6604545454545455
2014-04-16,5.0,"I really like this place. If you want to skip the specifics.. the venue is open & welcoming, service was spot on, and the food was delicious & full of flavor. My date and I pretty much ran the gamut of the menu. Started off with a small board (chef's choice, a combination of the cured meats & pates). Most of the meats were tasty & the pates were excellent  (wasn't a huge fan of their chorizo).  We were torn on which sausage to order, but we ended up with the Philippines. The seasoning was fantastic and I was surprised how good the fried rice was that came with it. The egg confit was a nice addition to the plate as well. We also got the beet salad and the trout. Both were done beautifully. Dishes are slightly small but that was expected.  I'll definitely be coming back here soon to try the other menus items.. especially the other sausages! Oh, and get the desert! There's only one. You're welcome.",0.989,0.756,0.22,0.024,0.65
2014-03-29,5.0,"Visited during 'soft opening.' Nice to have the chance to experience the place rather empty before the mobs which I'm sure will soon be here.  Server, Dudie, was excellent as was all of the fabulous food and drink we shared -- Bay Scallop Ceviche, Mackerel Escabèche (my favorite of our selections), Pâté Bourguignon (heritage pork, pistachio, cassis, mushrooms), West Loop Salumi Finocchiona  (fennel seed, fennel pollen, chianti), Rillette of Duck Confit w/ Rhubarb Jam, and Halibut.  Cremant De Borgogne Rosé was a lovely start, and Chicago's own Une Année Sanguinaire beer a nice pairing with the meatier courses.  Lucky are those who abide in the neighborhood served by this delicious place.  Get there now, before it becomes difficult to get a table.",0.9819,0.738,0.232,0.03,0.870940170940171
