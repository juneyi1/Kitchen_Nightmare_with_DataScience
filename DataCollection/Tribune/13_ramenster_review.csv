The place was nice and service was quick but the quality of food was like fast food quality, their chashu (in my tonkatsu ramen), just like from the other review, was soo chewy, the worst i ever had. Its supposed to be soft that kinda melts in your mouth chashu but theirs was like they cooked it in a rush. Hard to eat it with just chopsticks, a knife would have been useful but you dont use a knife to cut your food when eating ramen!!!! Also Their karaage (fried chicken) was over fried! my homemade karaage was much better. Of course i had better karaage elsewhere. Ramenster's food was far from authentic, they tasted more like frozen packaged tv dinners warmed up. kinda insulting to the japanese culture because japanese food is supposed to be at their best quality.

My friend wanted a particular vegetarian ramen and they only had one left. We wondered how they could run out of that particular ramen (at only 6pm no less). Was it a language issue? Hard to say.

2016-01-05,1.0,"Absolutely horrible customer service. I will never be returning to their restaurant. I placed a pick up order through their online portal on December 27. I waited for my order then went to go pick it up, but they were closed for an extended Christmas holiday. I expected not to be charged because they were closed (yet still allowed me to place an order)... A day later, I noticed that I was charged for the order that I placed and never received because they were closed. I immediately called the restaurant and they said they would call me back later. No call back. I called again the next day. No call back. By the third call I demanded to talk to a manager or owner and they assured me that they provided me with a refund and I would need to wait a few days. I waited and did not see a refund come through. Called for a fourth time and they said they would call back. No call back again. Then, over a week after the original order I called for the fifth time, letting them know that I would be coming by the restaurant to collect the money that they rightly owed me. They told me they could not provide me with a refund because they already had (but there was no refund in my bank account). During the two calls that I actually was able to speak to the manager, she kept changing her story, changing the date that she provided me the refund and pushing back the date that I should receive it, indicating that she actually had no intention of providing me a refund and was hoping they could get away with charging me. The fact that I was able to order when the restaurant was closed was frustrating in itself. But, I know that sometimes restaurants have mishaps (especially new restaurants). The fact that Ramenster did not try to make it right by refunding me and providing me with a credit shows how horrible their customer service is and they have no idea how to run a business properly. Not only did they not refund my money, but they never even said sorry! I have no doubt that Ramenster will be closing their doors soon.",-0.9429,0.849,0.056,0.095,0.3326839826839827
2016-01-05,2.0,"This is probably one of the worst ramen places in Chicago and not even in terms of authenticity, which is something I value but not necessarily a factor. Came for dinner Saturday evening around 8pm. We sat ourselves since it is a casual spot and were given menus promptly. There were a few other diners. The space is somewhat cool in that there are a few small tables on the side and one big communal table in the middle. I'm not a huge fan of communal tables but I didn't mind, as there was enough space in between us and the next diners. Some Yelpers noted the cool bright lighting. However, our group and myself included found it to be very intense and bothersome, as they are super white and bright. After awhile, you do get used to it. Really no reason to knock any stars off here at this point yet. I order the ahiru ramen (duck), sis and cuz get the yasai ramen (veggie) and we also get a Chicago-v maki roll to start. Food took a very long time to come. Our waters were constantly refilled though. We finally get our maki roll first and there were six nice satisfying pieces. There wasn't too much rice on them either. They were pretty good. We waited maybe another twenty minutes and only two bowls of ramen came out. Mine took an additional five to seven minutes. My cousin noted that the two staff members were too busy chit-chatting when the two ramen orders were ready to be served to our table, letting the ramen sit for awhile, as the noodles continued to cook and absorb the broth, compared to my ramen, which came at a different time and served timely, as indicated by the non-mushy noodles and appropriate amount of broth. Still not even super bothered at this point. Now to taste. Everything was super bland...especially the broth. Not even chili oil or togarashi could save that one. The duck pieces were fine. The only other component I remember was the celery, but every ingredient pretty much was just there and didn't do much for the ramen. I can't say that the noodles, broth, or toppings were good, let alone great. The others agreed that their ramen was also very bland. The only positives of this place were their various ramen and sushi options, reasonable prices, and food presentation. A bit ironic that their sushi is better than their ramen, given the name of the place.

Unfortunately, we soon discovered that looks can be deceiving.  The ramen turned out to be the worst I've ever had, especially in comparison to the many great ramen places in Chicago. I ordered the Miso Ramen, whose broth was blandless and almost bitter/ too peppery. The chashu pork was like rubber, too tough to cut with a spoon, fork or chopsticks -- I awkwardly fiddled with it throughout the entire meal and ended up just not eating it. This was the first time I left the meat that comes with ramen sitting sadly in the bottom of the bowl. A couple other small issues I had - we ordered a starter (Crab tempura with mango salsa) which ended up coming a while after the ramen instead of before (not a big deal). However, it was pretty expensive for what it was: 2-3 bites/pieces of crab on top of a large bed of lettuce and garnish that took up the rest of the plate. Think 30% crab 70% lettuce. The tempura coating was also flavorless.  To summarize: the food looks good, the place looks cool, and the menu design and music are obviously well-designed.

2015-11-12,2.0,"I'd say the food is 4 stars, and the service on the night I was there would be around 1-2 stars. Food first: My wife and I had the Ahiru and Shoyu Ramen. The Shoyu was a pretty typical ramen, and done well. The Ahiru was interesting, and while I ended up preferring the Shoyu, I think a lot of people would be very happy with the sweet and slightly spicy broth.  It's hard for me to think about the food at the moment, as I'm still bothered by the service issue. Let me start by saying that the wait staff was kind, busy, and apologetic, so I wouldn't say that the service was an issue because of them. I arrived at the restaurant when it was about 50% full, so not crazy busy, and ordered a couple of ramen for take out. I then waited an hour to get those ramen. If you've been to the place, you'll know that the space doesn't exactly scream ""hang out leisurely while waiting for your food to come out for an hour"". So I sat around on an uncomfortable chair, without any warning or update about the kitchen apparently being slammed, despite there being a lot of empty seats in the restaurant. The one update I got, with about 10 minutes to go before I got my food, was that it'd be out soon. I got one apology from one of the servers, which is nice and all, but really doesn't make up for the inappropriately long wait.  The place is relatively new in the neighborhood, so I'd like to think that I'll go back sometime and find it to be pleasant. But as of right now, unless you go in when there are four or fewer people in there, you're in for a stupidly long wait.",0.9333,0.876,0.091,0.033,0.547943722943723

My friend would not have ordered a curry dish. Menu descriptions could be more explanatory overall. They also serve sushi which was unexpected. I came here for ramen.

2015-11-01,2.0,"I have tried nearly all their ramen bowls in the few weeks they have opened and only the Tonkotsu stands out. The chatsu pork is very good as are the rest of the toppings - and the egg nicely done. However, the duck and all the others are boring and the broths lack real depth of flavor. Worse, they are also a little stingy with the amount of broth - I don't expect pho-like amounts but I also don't expect the broth to be almost like a sauce for the noodles. Food timing is awful with people almost done by the time the last person is served. The staff is harried and a little overwhelmed, constantly apologizing for missing one thing or another, or lateness of food. I expect improvements here if this place lasts for more than a few months. The problem is I don't think that this place will really last.",-0.8702,0.798,0.061,0.141,0.4880392156862744

2015-10-28,4.0,"My boyfriend and I came here for the soft opening with no idea what to expect, but we both were pleasantly surprised.  Because it was the soft opening we didn't have the full restaurant experience (i.e. they were not serving the full menu, they were still working out service, etc.), but we still very much enjoyed our meal.  Between us we ordered the Gyoza, Tonkotsu Ramen,  Ahiru Ramen, and I think the Avocado Katsu (the last item was a substitution because they were out of the original item we ordered so I THINK this was what we ordered, but there was a little bit of a language barrier). Full disclosure, this place is correct in saying it isn't traditional (though it isn't as crazy or fusion as I imagined from the description).  My Ahiru Ramen had a flavor to it that tasted like five spice and almost like a cross between ramen and pho.  However, everything we had was really delicious.  My boyfriend was skeptical at first sip of his tonkotsu ramen but after a few slurps he said he really enjoyed the taste of the broth.  I also really liked the Avocado Katsu.  Of all the dishes, the Gyoza were the least intriguing.  They were tasty, but not anything special or notable. That said, there were a few things I think they could improve on knowing it was a soft opening.  The portion sizes on the ramen seemed a bit small compared to other places in Chicago and while the Ahiru Ramen had a lot of goodies it seemed like the tonkotsu could have had more stuff in it.  I also found the knife cuts on the Avocado Katsu to be really sloppy.  Good, fresh tuna is such a pricy ingredient I like to see it cut into nice, even pieces. Overall I was really impressed given it was a soft opening.  There were a few things I think they could improve on but overall it was really delicious and we enjoyed our visit.",0.9971,0.759,0.207,0.034,0.5111607142857143

Waiting time is a bit long for a ramen order at 5pm weekday, took roughly 20 mins. The ramenster ramen is very Thai food related, mostly clams ,shrimps and a piece of fish fillet. Personally ,not a fan of the noodle , too soggy not firm enough. When it served ,the noodle is a bit undercooked. The broth is not bad ,but definitely not Japanese flavor, maybe I should go with tonkotsu. Seafood seems fresh which is good things. But the charge is 16 bucks which is way too high.    I will likely to visit again when they actually opened , and hopefully it can meet the expectation next time.",0.9366,0.823,0.145,0.032,0.44449999999999995
2015-10-20,5.0,"There are two schools of ramen thought: the small, steamy ramen bars that pride themselves on tradition, and the hip, innovative ramen shops that chuck the rule book out of the metaphorical shojis. Although Ramenster aspires, and claims, to be the latter, its place in the dichotomy isn't as clear. My wife and I had the Tsukemen and the Ahiru from which this review is based. That the Tsukemen and the Ahiru were infused with non-traditional elements is clear: fried shallots and sambal are distinctly Malay. Yet, the base ramen is unmistakably Japanese. The noodles were incredibly springy - a good thing, I think, when noodles are concerned. The chahsu pork was seared after braising. A special mention must be made to the menma, which had an incredible flavor. A ramen, however, can only be as good as its broth, and Ramenster's is very, very good. Their shoyu broth had a good depth. The tonkatsu is surprisingly clean - a departure from Slurping Turtle's more complex broth. White pepper gives it a nice accent. Where they shine, however, is in their miso broth. Too often miso broth is made with too much or too little miso. Ramenster's is incredibly well balanced.  Also, they have Ramune. Which made my night. Kudos to Ramenster for a job well done. I hope you guys do well!",0.9879,0.807,0.175,0.018,0.5527238095238094
