The blueberry wonut was good and was definitely our favorite, as it had great texture and a nice blueberry flavor to it. The texture of the blueberry wonut was sort of like a semi-crispy waffle, with the fluffiness of the inside of a donut. However, the chocolate turtle and red velvet were nothing like this. Their textures were nothing like the blueberry one and were just...weird. We also got the waffles benedict. This was a good dish, with the liege waffles being the star of it.

A bit later we got our food.  He got the Chiliquilles, and described them as ""tasteless."" I got the chicken and waffles.  That chicken was the driest thing I have ever seen. The meat inside was brown and crunchy.  The waffles were fine.  How can you mess up a waffle.

I also had the chocolate chip banana wonut which had no chocolate chips in it... hmmm... this was disappointing. To be fair, it did have some chocolate drizzles on top, but definitely no chips. The banana flavor was there, but it was too much, or maybe too little, or perhaps the ratio was just off, because it wasn't really working. It was also too dense.  I also got the hashbrowns, which are really just mashed potatoes cooked in a waffle maker (so they look like mini waffles). They were served with sour-cream, so I felt like I was eating potato pancakes (latkes). Which is fine, but it's just confusing. What are they going for?

I called the restaurant to see if they'd be able to accommodate me and the girl that answered basically told me all I'd be able to eat was salad... Now I was starting to get worried. We showed up and I looked at the menu and it turns out they also serve vegan hot dogs and sausages. I have no idea why the girl failed to mention that to me, but oh well.

If you don't make them ever, take it off the menu! That was pretty disappointing, but based in the other people at my table who ordered regular wonuts, it seems like I wasn't missing out too much.

I don't know, maybe it was an off day for them. Milkshakes were pretty satisfactory. Conclusion: Nice waiters, chill ambience, decent waffles. It was just that Green Tea Waffles that really threw us off.",0.9833,0.755,0.205,0.04,0.564039408866995

The service was unbelievable, and not in a good way. Hostesses, waiters and busers walked around aimlessly, no one acknowledging the 15some people standing in line waiting to at least put our name in. We waited 10-15 min before anyone said anything to us, finally an elderly woman took a few names, ignored the others and just started wandering again. I felt like we were being pranked.  Fast forward to after we sat down, she came back to us 5 min later so we could find our name on her list and cross it out.  The food wasn't awful but nothing to brag about. The waffles I got were way too dense and I couldn't eat much. All in all not worth putting up with the bad service for.

We got the green tea waffle and the cheddar & short rib waffle. Each came with 3 waffles, so the portions were a decent size. The green tea waffle tasted pretty good BUT it didn't taste like green tea. It tasted more like the lemon cream that was drizzled on top. I think without that cream, the waffle would have been pretty tasteless. The short rib waffle was just OK. It had unmelted shredded cheese thrown on top, and the short ribs were dry and way overcooked. I think they gave us the burnt ends of the meat.

I also had the Green Tea Waffles and the Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate.  I loved the waffles, they had a light flavor and the pistachios crumbled on top with a lemon glaze highlighted the green tea flavor.  The Peanut Butter Hot Chocolate (which I almost didn't get - more on that later) is amazing, it's like a melted Reese's that you can drink. Our waitress forgot about our beverages 3 times, at least.  It was her first day, but we also encountered a long wait for a table, place our orders and to get our food.  From start to finish, we were here about two hours.  It's typical for a hot spot during the breakfast/brunch rush, but if you don't have any patience you might want to go somewhere else.  Our waitress was really awesome about splitting up our checks though.  I felt like a chump for not being prepared with cash, but our waitress accomodated all of our needs.

She said im not understand what she said & not listen to her. I asked her in that case where is my order?? Did you still have my order or u didnt hv my order or u sell it??? It was no answer from her but same sentence i dont listen to her. She asked me to take off my sunglasses (omg am i a robber??) she said she afraid i would be one of reporter!!! I believed I have the right to be mad at this situation since this place have my phone number at least have the decency to give me a call or message me on Facebook which i hv conversation with them.On top of that, she told me wait 30 mins because the new Wonuts is coming fresh from her son in other location.

The manager or owner lady was a little rude as well considering we preordered the wonuts and drove out and spent a lot bc we bought three dozen.

I got the waffle flight and my boyfriend got the waffle egg and sausage sandwich. The presentation was lovely, but the waffles were squishy. The red velvet one was the best, being that it tasted very velvety, but I missed the anticipated crunch that comes from the outside of a well prepared waffle.

2014-03-16,2.0,"I'm going to give Waffles 2 stars instead of 1 because I'm going to try and believe we caught them on an off morning. My boyfriend and I were super excited to try this place out for brunch, it was a Sunday morning so we called ahead to get an idea of the wait time, over the phone they said about 30-40 minutes. Cool, that's what I was expecting for a party of 2 Sunday morning. We arrived, put our names in and were told about 30 minutes, cool. They offered complimentary self serve water and coffee in their ""waiting room"". After waiting about 45 minutes, I politely just checked in with the host to see how that list was moving. It turns out that they had just seated a table of 30 that was taking up over half of their restaurant, so it might be another 30 minutes. At this point, the coffee was still holding me over and we had a nice spot at a table in their ""waiting room"" so I was fine waiting a little longer. After another 10/15 minutes of waiting I realize that we're sitting at a fully functional table and realize - maybe we could order here quick? I ask the hostess, she says yes. Then the gentleman next to her tells me ""No, that's only our waiting room and there are other people in front of you - sorry."" I say no worries, just wanted to explore my options.  Shortly after a staff member comes over to us and tells us we have to give up the table we've been waiting at because people from the other restaurant are going to be sat there....Excuse me? What other restaurant? I thought this was an official waiting area? We give up on spots and watch a group of 3 order from another menu at the counter and sit down. Apparently one half of the restaurant is named something ""Bun"" and it's more fast food style. Finally, my boyfriend checks in with the host one more time and he gets a sarcastic ""We'll seat you when we can, thank you sir."" At that point, the free coffee wasn't enough to keep us around and I just wanted something to eat. We went up the street to a cute little place called Spritz Burger, got seated instantly and had a delicious brunch.  Moral of the story is, please work on your communication.

I had the French Toast which is made with pound cake instead of bread- it makes the texture and flavor a bit more interesting and tasty. I also enjoyed the fresh strawberries on the top which seemed to be a perfect flavor complement. Intelligentsia coffee is served which is one of my local favorites- which I feel is that much more delicious with breakfast. There was a comment made in another review about the cost which we found to be only slightly pricier than ""normal"" especially considering the neighborhood. I felt we got good value for the dollar paid with no complaints.  I wouldn't hesitate to go back to Waffles Cafe again when I am in the Lake view area.

The texture was so unique, a true food of genius.  We ordered the flight of pancakes for the table to share (red velvet, green tea, Mexican chocolate, and a sweet one whose name escapes me).  They were all extremely flavorful, but very sweet.  We thought their sweet waffles would be good as desserts, not so great for a filling breakfast.  We all ordered various savory waffles: Coffee Braised Short ribs with Cheddar Waffles, Ham and Cheese Waffles, Bacon and Chicken Waffles, Waffle sandwich, and Waffles Benedict.  All of them were amazing!  Yes, the length of time we waited to get the food was slightly longer than we would have liked, and yes they needed one more waiter in the dining room, but this is a place I will go to time and time again, because it's worth the mild wait (and it is mild).

I was VERY happy that they make cappuccinos and lattes here, and soymilk is an option.  They did not charge me extra for soy when I went (hopefully that was not an oversight because I hate having to pay extra to avoid the war that dairy milk unleashes on me).  It was delicious and they had stevia at the table.  It was a very good day. MILKSHAKES! My brunch date ordered a chocolate milkshake, complete with whipped cream and sprinkles.  I am told it was delicious. CHALKBOARD TABLES!

They kept the drinks refilled and the server was very polite. Now regarding the food, the rice that came with my Huevos Rancheros was the frozen kind. The eggs were cooked properly but overall the dish was bland. The potatoes side dish were large cubed fried potatoes. No seasoning on the potatoes and they were over-done and cut up too large. They should be smaller. My friend had some steak torta which was servied warm, not hot. Also the steak appeared to be the fajita pre-cooked steak you buy in the frozen-food aisle at the grocery store. It was grey and overcooked and not tender at all. I also had to try the waffle and it was the only good part of the meal. They charge $1 for a small two-tablespoon portion of real maple syrup. I don't use the corn-syrup maple-syrup that most restaurants serve so I'm happy they offered this option. The waffles are thick, and about 2.5 inches diameter. They are fluffy and have a yeasty taste. These are ""real"" waffles and I enjoyed them, although the price is rather high as others have mentioned. But we are in Lakeview, and they're trying to keep people employed and I bet rent and taxes are high too so it's to be expected. They service Intelligentsia coffee and it tasted fresh and they kept my cup full. For breakfast coffee it gets 4/4 stars. Overall I would not recommend this place.

I get the same thing every time I come to Waffles: the Waffle Benedict, ginger/orange/carrot juice, and coffee.  The Waffle Benedict, with its combination of semi-sweet waffles and pork shoulder, is about as good as brunch gets.  I like to add Tabasco for a little kick.

So Billy was our server... Everybody say...*Hiiii Billy how are you?!*  Now that we have his name covered..... I ordered the Waffle Egg Sandwich and my co-worker ordered the sampler with the Green Tea, Red Velvet, the Mexican, etc etc etc... I was excited to receive this unique sandwich, until it was received on our table. Portion was very....um.....small?.... The Waffle *bread* was um.....soggy?.....and I expected a more CRUNCHY exterior to a waffle to get that texture of Crunchy goodness of a waffle, with the saltiness of the crispy bacon, and the delicious egg in a carton flavor, and it totally went downhill the moments my taste buds taste this sandwich. I think my Tongue taste buds were disappointed to have devoured a bite of this Waffle that tasted like spoiled beer?, funky tasting?, chemically?, I was disgusted I didnt want to take another bite. I refuse to eat something i dont like and pay for it, I raised my hand and Billy arrives. I told Billy how this sandwich tasted and he apologized and said u can order something else off the menu.... i asked him what did they put in their waffles......and he said Yeast......hmmm... now i know the secret ingredient that was murdering my taste buds.... Yeast like batter is more Bread-ish, i expected a crunchier waffle...MAYBE they should change their recipe instead? Maybe they tried to do the McGriddle like Mcdonalds...but failed terribly =[ I ordered the Plain and Simple....YUP! that's right.....PLAIIIIIN and SIMPLE...hehehe.... can't go wrong with that right? Basic scrambled, bacon, big ass potatoe pieces, and toast. Didnt see nothing special about it.... and i think iHop would have made a better Plain and Simple.... mannn I knew I shouldve went back in that Kitchen and created my own scrambled eggz!  Now back to Billy..... So i noticed he was avoiding us? A gentleman sat near us and he gave him attention, asked him is the food okay......guy said yes..... Did Billy ask is the food okay (this is when I got my *Plain and Simple*)?...Noooo.. =( ...... We were done eating, and we waited......and waited......and waited for our check. That guy near us got his check right away, and left. Mind you, me and my coworker work nearby and we had to get back to work.... so we waited and waited, and i asked this girl sweeping the floor, like Hun, can we get the check please???  I waited some more, our server looks at us and says this.... *Pull out your Groupon and i'll check you out in a second*....Lmao... hold on..let me catch my breathe for a second, did he.... did he really think we were Groupon people? Did you screen us and say HEEEEY they are Groupon people who caaaaaares about them. They can wait...etc etc...... Is this how you treat Groupon people? Do you HONESTLY think that treating *Groupon people* this way will have them come back?? Obviously Groupon is used to save your little breakfast joint from failing, but treating people like that wont have anyone come back The reason for Groupon is for people to have a sample, and if they have an amazing experience they'll come back.

The boy and I went Sunday morning after finding a really awesome Groupon. The deal brought us to Waffles, a place we might otherwise have never found.  The staff seated us immediately in a little table in the window.  It was all very bright and clean.  Before taking the drink order, the server recommended the fresh-squeezed orange juice to maximize the return on our Groupon.  It was a good choice; the glasses are also very generously sized.  Food: I got the chicken bacon waffle and he got the albondigas.  The chicken bacon is pretty much a classic chicken and waffles topped with bacon. I unfortunately didn't get enough of the spicy maple syrup advertised on the menu and settled for the table stuff, which worked, although spice would've helped the dish.  The waffle was awesome-- fluffy, tender, and crispy on the edges.  The chicken was nice.

The tables are fun- you can write on them with chalk. But big huge warning to all individuals with Celiacs or a Gluten Intolerance..... THE 'GLUTEN FREE' WAFFLES ARE NOT GLUTEN FREE I ordered the Green Tea waffles, which are usually the color green, but I substituted them for GF waffles (not green) and just kept the GT toppings. I went with my boyfriend, he ordered an omelette, which seemed average. I finished all of my waffles and started to feel dizzy. I decided I was probably just overreacting, because eating out GF can be a little bit scary. So we paid the bill- but on the walk home I had a full blown attack. My GF intolerance symptoms are all related to anxiety- throat closes, hazy brain, shaking, dizzy etc... So my day was ruined.  When I was calmed down enough to call the restaurant and inform them of what happened, with a simple request to be more careful, my waiter answered the phone and let me know the manager would be calling me back. He apologized (again, he seemed like a nice dude). But, when I told another GF friend about what happened to me, she said the SAME thing happened to her there. I waited 5 days for the manager to call me... and nothing. Waffles seriously needs to be more careful with their claim ""gluten free."" It's not okay or safe to be serving people with allergies or intolerance something with a fake claim.

2013-07-08,3.0,"Waffles is a pretty good brunch option. It's relatively new, so I haven't had to wait too long for seating. That's a plus in Chicago. It's also BYOB, so mimosas with their freshly squeezed orange juice is probably in order when you go. I don't love the prices though. Most of the menu items are $10-12. It's not incredibly high, but compared to some of the great value you can get in the area (see Horizon Cafe or Corona's Cafe), it feels like a bit much. I'd pay a little more for a special ambience (like Flower Flat around the corner), but this is modern/contemporary, pretty average. The food is very good, and I think if I went again I would get the Waffle Egg Sandwiches. I think they are the best value and you get super full of eggs, meat (turkey sausage was my pick) and, of course, waffles. The chicken and bacon waffle was a little disappointing, just because I think there was just chicken and bacon on the waffle vs. bacon inside - or if there was, I missed it. The ham and cheese waffle, which my mom got when I brought her on Mother's Day was very good. It's very rich, but delicious if you like cheese. It's like the melty, cheez-whiz variety.  Lastly, I should note that the Mother's Day brunch was nice. My mom got a free mimosa for being a mom, and she also ordered a juice that had carrots, spinach and I think apple. That was fun and a little bit different. The odd thing about the service was that there were children bussing the tables and cleaning up dishes. I thought maybe they were with their mom's, but on a separate occasion with friends, I noticed the same children working. I would guess they are like 8 years old, so not like just under working age.

As we sat down, service was decent but considering we were the only ones in our section that should be par for the course.  As we looked around we noticed that the decor was pretty shotty.  The paint had been done very sloppily and the table, although the chalkboard tables were a cool idea, were a little dusty and dirty.  The whole place just had an overall feeling of needing to be wiped down.  Even the water that was brought to our table had a ""moldy"" taste as if the area that was being used for water had not been cleaned. As for the food, I ordered the Chicken and Bacon Waffles and my partner ordered the Lige waffles.   Although the presentation for the Chicken and Bacon waffles were what I expected, the taste was poor.  I was served 3 waffles underneath the chicken and none of the waffles really had any distinct flavor.  They were a bit soggy and if they were supposed to have bacon in them, you couldn't taste it.  The chicken was better, but suffered the same problem.  The crust was crisp and crunchy which I like but the taste was like eating fried flour.  The chicken also lacked any taste and I began to question if the thigh meat that I had was thoroughly cooked.  I could see some pink and red areas so I didn't eat it all.   The lige waffle that my partner got was interesting in that it was a fairly dense waffle.  I like dense dough so I didn't mind it at all, however at one point as it cooled down, it seemed like you were eating a big piece of pie crust.  It was covered with bananas and hazelnut spread but they definitely didn't use much for the toppings.  After a while, the waffle just became dough-y and lacked any taste once the toppings were gone, which was pretty quick since we didn't get much. Overall, the place is pretty below average.  As much as I hate to say it, IHOP would have given us a better experience for the price point.  The cooking is mediocre and the service is a bit ""bothered"".  I felt like our host just wanted to get out of there and was a bit miffed that he was working during the parade.   I really wanted to like this place but unfortunately can't recommend it to anyone at this time.  Save your money and go somewhere else.  There are plenty of great brunch places in the city.",0.9889,0.803,0.133,0.064,0.5350980392156862

Um, I was sure until you asked me whether I was sure. Because it's more like a scone, he says, so don't be surprised/disappointed. Oh, shit, well if it's not a waffle, then I want to try a waffle- give me the traditional one. Are you sure, he asks again, because it is a waffle. Really?! No, I'm not sure at all. I was pretty damn sure I wanted a liege and now you're wasting my precious conversation time with this back and forth about my order. Just give me the liege waffle, like I asked for ten minutes ago. I got it topped with bananas and nutella. It came. It looked like a waffle. It didn't taste like any scone I've ever had. It was good. I tried my friend's. The texture was different, but not so much so that it deserved any kind of extensive decision making. No idea what that waiter was talking about. Anyway, we finished our waffles and then my friend decided she needed some vegetables and requested a salad. A salad, the server asks, are you sure? Yes, it's my final answer, dammit. Stop questioning our orders! What kind of salad? A green one. duh. She wanted to make sure it wasn't going to be some cheap iceberg salad. Oh no, we use romaine with our special house-made dressing. Ok great. What came was a small bowl of shredded lettuce that looked like it came from a taco, and a lot of sad looking croutons, which were promptly discarded. Nonsense salad. So she asked our server for a better salad, because this is not what she had requested. After more conversation, he went off to make a ""special request"" and came back with some mixed field greens with tomatoes and cucumber. Now why couldn't this have come out in the first place? When our bill came, they had charged us $10 for the salad. Seriously?! This was a side salad size and didn't even have any chicken on it or anything. $10 is standard meatless entree sized salad pricing. So of course we complained and they gave it to us for $5. What was even more surprising was that the $10 was the charge for the first taco shredding salad, not the fancy field greens one. That shouldn't have even been a salad for any restaurant to serve let alone charge $10 for! It was an interesting brunch, and my scone/waffle was tasty enough, but I'm not sure I'd go back.

We got some sort of strange fried bread/cake with whipped cream on top. my most educated guess would be a piece of fried frozen store bought pound cake. but i'll never know because i swear i will never go back even though i live a block away. i'll just stick with the flower flat if i feel particularly lazy and want brunch/lunch.",-0.7797,0.845,0.068,0.087,0.5563620071684587

(It feels like a basement rec-room) Wait time was very long probably in part because of the disorganized hostess and poor service. There were plenty of waiters and it's a small space, so I'm not sure why it took so long.  Everyone working there seemed either confused or uninterested. My table of two watched a table of five get seated after us, and receive their food before us (?!?) The food was actually good but overpriced considering the small portion size.  I ordered the waffles benedict which consisted of two 3""x3"" waffles topped by a small amount of pulled pork and a poached egg.  The rest of the plate was salad greens.  Not much food for $13.  Fresh squeezed orange juice will run you $4.50.

The food is good-- novel variations on things you've had before. Both of our meals were based on the Liege waffles, which are thick, mealy, and slightly caramelized. They're good, and a step up from generic waffles. He had the Liege waffles with strawberry filling and maple syrup, and here begins the annoyances-- they charge extra for the syrup. Granted, it's real maple syrup, but I think the idea of a waffle place charging you for the syrup is absurd. I had the waffles benedict, since I figured I'd try the specialty. I  hadn't realized the waffles would be sweet beneath the savory pork and eggs, which was a nice surprise at the begin, but I eventually found it to be too much. I order savory breakfasts for a reason-- because I'm not fond of sweet things in the morning. Much worse than that is the fact that they charge $14 for it, when a good benedict at another brunch place will be between $10-$12. It also came with very little in the way of sides-- it had a small green salad, but that was it. I sort of like the smaller meal, but it just contributed to the fact that I felt ripped off. Service was ok-- the food arrived quickly, but the waiter didn't exactly lavish us with attention.

2013-04-10,2.0,"A disappointment.  Hubby and I went here on a recent trip to the Chicago area. We thought this looked like a good breakfast place to try in the area we were staying. Meh, a gimmick, should have just gone to a diner bc that's what the food was, but smaller, and more expensive. I ordered the waffles benedict and a hot chocolate, my hubby the Mexican chocolate waffles (I think it was called) and a coffee.  Coffee was Intelligentsia, which was a nice surprise, but their espresso roast so was very strong (prefer flavor and nuttiness to brute strength).  Milk options -- really? A solid breakfast place should be more up on dairy standards, IMO. Coffee milk option was those plastic non-refrigerated ""milk"" packets you find in diners. Really? Did you know those packets actually say ""MAY contain dairy."" I hope they contain dairy since they are supposed to be MILK!? My husband asked for milk and out came skim. We were surprised this place didn't offer whole milk or cream with their coffee. The hot chocolate was made with water, not milk, and tasted like it was Swiss Miss. (Or perhaps it was skim milk bc it was so thin it might as well have been.) Let down. Out came the waffles. I can't believe I'm actually writing this bc 90% of the time I find restaurant food way over-seasoned/ salted, but mine was way under seasoned/ salted. I couldn't believe I actually had to add salt (I think it was my first time ever adding salt to a dish in a restaurant). Other than lack of flavor, the dish was ok, waffle (yes, one waffle cut into 3 small pieces) was soggy upon arrival. My husband wasn't too impressed with his Mexican Chocolate waffle which just looked/ tasted like plain waffles with cocoa powder and powdered sugar sprinkled on top. He also thought his was under-flavored.  I realize this place doesn't pass themselves off as having ""Belgian"" waffles, but ""gourmet"" waffles, but there was nothing gourmet about them. A waffle should be crisp on the outside with some structure and soft on the inside. These were soft and flimsy all around.

My husband and I went to for an early dinner around 4pm.  There was no one there but two employees, but it was probably due to the time that we went (4pm isn't exactly lunch/dinner time - kinda in between).  The two employees were cleaning the place and welcomed us in right away.  ""Booth or table,"" they said.  We went for the booth by the TV because we figured we'd catch up on the news while eating. Looking around, I saw red, orange and yellow vinyl covered panels on each wall of the restaurant.  The ceiling has missing tiles, but I think that is the look they are going for...or were going for.  They employee explained to me that they are actually painting the walls white to display some of their lovely photos, which sort of were hidden in the mix with the vivid colors.  I agreed this would be a nice decision, since the photos are quite well framed.  I have to say the employee was very nice - got us water right away and was eager to serve us and explain the menu.  My husband ordered the chicken parmesan, a dinner that incorporated garlic buttered waffles.  I ordered the Chili Burger, which had ground beef patty, with a ""topping"" of kidneys beans, peppers and other chili findings.  The burger also had a fried egg and avocado - the combination of which tasted delicious with the burger itself.  The burger also came with a side of waffle (heh) fries.

We have heard about Waffles, and thought we should go, it also is only about 3 blocks from our apartment. We got there and it was pretty empty. We sat in a booth near the front and just chatted, the waiter was friendly, so far a fine eating experience. Out of nowhere a terrible smell presented itself, and mid-sentence i stopped, and actually asked my roommate ""what is that awful smell?"" She laughed because she could not even believe i was having to ask, and wonder where this god awful smell was coming from. I wanted to look around and see what it could be but figured that would be a little awkward, so i just somewhat held my breath and continued talking with my roommate. I love cheeseburgers and even though it was eleven in the morning I decided to get a burger, it was terrible. The pretzel bun tasted as though it should have been thrown out yesterday, and cheese was not melted on it so i was just eating clumps of cold cheese. The fries were the only good part, yes I only got about 5 waffle fries, nowhere near the $10.95 cost of the burger. It was a total fail. My roommate got a vegetable scramble, which she quickly looked and said a child must have made it. The vegetables did not taste very fresh, excluding the avocado which she did enjoy. The scramble came with potatoes wedges, maybe ""home fries"" but really they were just super burnt squares of potatoes. My roommate ate only  one of them, well she actually only ate half of one.

I bought a Groupon for this joint after having scoped out their menu, excited for my boyfriend who loves sweet breakfast foods of all kinds to be treated to a gluten-free waffle. Oh boy, oh boy. So, we arrived and had to wait a bit, having not made a reservation. No worries. Their nifty little texting pager system for tables was kind of neat, and the owner made a big show of explaining it to us.  We were seated within fifteen minutes of arrival, and I showed the server my Groupon. We started with the hot chocolate flights, which, if a little cool, were delicious. And then there was the food.  I ordered the chilaquiles, and my boyfriend ordered the gluten-free waffle with a side of bacon. Our server checked in with us right as we were about to try our food, and we said everything was going fine. Big mistake, apparently. Ugh. The chilaquiles tasted like they'd been cooked in a skillet and burnt; they had a very smoky taste to them that I couldn't wash away with the many glasses of water I'd had. The bacon we'd ordered on the side tasted like chicharron- it was greasy and cold, which is no small feat to screw up bacon cooked well-done. My boyfriend's gluten-free waffle was salty and tasted like a pretel, on top of being cold. When we called over our server to explain our frustration with our meal, he rather snottily retorted that we'd said everything was fine when he'd checked in with us earlier. I calmly explained that we hadn't even tried our food at this point. Without deferring to the manager or apologizing, continuing with his attitude, he said he'd comp the bacon but that since we were using a Groupon, he couldn't do anything about the bill.  What I'd really wanted was an apology. I didn't have a problem paying over the cost of the Groupon for the bacon, and he would have gotten a nice tip if he hadn't been such a jackass.

2013-03-22,1.0,"Wow, okay... where to start on this one... After a long day of shopping with my best friend yesterday, he told me about a new waffle place that recently opened up down the street from him. Having the craving lately for fried chicken and waffles, I knew we couldn't pass up the chance to try this place. I wish we would've just passed it. We checked out the menu posted on the window, and thought we'd give it a try. We were first prompted by a sign on the door that stated they were closed for maintenance between 3pm and 4pm. It being nearly 4.30, we went in (confused why the sign hadn't been taken down, as it was merely steps from where the host was stationed). We were sat at the first booth, only to find the tabletop covered in crumbs (I've uploaded a picture of it here on Yelp, attached to this place's profile). I noticed that pretty much every tabletop was like this, so I swept the crumbs aside and moved on. I find it rather disheartening that all the tables in the restaurant were dirty, even having been closed for an hour for maintenance. We were given a carafe of water and two glasses (I have also uploaded a picture of the carafe) that were covered in soap residue and the sticky goo from labels that were seemingly just removed. I have NEVER seen this in my life at any restaurant I have ever dined at. My buddy and I inspected the glassware, rolled our eyes knowing that the residue didn't make the water undrinkable, and, again, moved on. We both ordered the Chicken & Bacon dish from the host who also played waiter, and received our meals fairly quickly. Now, I want to make the point here that my best friend is a professional chef in the city of Chicago. He's been around the block and he knows his stuff, and is an amazing cook. He's good, and his work at high-end places such as Alinea is a testament to his skill. I'm very glad he was with when I came to this establishment. Before us on our plates, sat three Eggo-sized waffles, a drumstick and a breast that made their KFC counterparts look large, and what I could only think was a 1/6 of a cup of their ""spicy"" syrup. The big draw to the style of waffles for this dish,  the bacon, came in the form of, much to my chagrin, bacon bits sprinkled sparingly over the three waffles -- the menu made it seem that the bacon was cooked directly into the batter of the waffles. The ""spicy"" syrup tasted no different than store-bought Aunt Jemima, and upon first bite of the fried chicken we could tell that they were over-cooked. So disappointed with the lack of kick in their ""spicy"" syrup, my buddy waited for the host/waiter to come around so he could ask for some hot sauce... and he waited... and he waited... Now, I get that someone having both host and waiter duties can be rather busy, but other than my buddy and I, there was only two others in the entire restaurant. Finally my friend just gave up and ate the rest of his meal. I would also like to point out, kind of along this topic, we were never asked for a drink order -- we were given the water and then host/waiter went right into the meal order. We totally forgot to ask for drinks when we ordered the meal, being rather hungry and only thinking about the promise of food. When we finished the meal, the host/waiter popped out of nowhere and took our plates and instantly dropped the check off, not asking if we were doing okay or asking if we wanted anything else. The look of the restaurant is perplexing to me, with its padded fabric walls and its blackboard-paint tabletops. The mostly monochromatic colour scheme would be alright if it wasn't for the thick stabs of mustard yellow thrown in here and there, which I have to say was rather distracting while eating and an eyesore all around. I'm not crazy about the drop ceiling with most of the tiles gone, and I was even less crazy about the tiles left being that same obnoxious mustard yellow. And, of course, the cleanliness of the tables was atrocious. This space has been at least three or four different restaurants in the past two years, and I honestly don't see this one lasting very long. It doesn't help that the waffle craze was fairly big on the east coast four years ago, and it never really took off in Chicago. This waffle joint is four years too late, and a whole world behind the diners and restaurants in the Lakeview area. You know, those of us not in the food industry go to restaurants because we not only want food, but we want food (usually) that we cannot make ourselves in our own kitchens. We want to be mystified by what people can do with food, and that's why we are willing to pay for higher-end food. But anyone could make the waffles on this menu, and for a fraction of the price. I won't be giving this establishment another try, nor will my chef buddy. If I was in the mood for the gimmick of waffles and breakfast food anytime of the day, I'd rather walk down the street and go to the Ihop. There, I guarantee, we wouldn't have paid over $30 for waffles.",0.9629,0.9,0.063,0.037,0.5329718333614438
2013-03-20,1.0,"Yikes!!!! I'm not sure what happened here! The name of the restaurant is Waffles, yet it may have been one of the worst waffles I've had in a very long time. Great idea, very poor execution. My friend and I try different brunch places regularly and decided to give Waffles a try. It seemed like a cute concept and it had an appealing menu, however, that is ALL it had.  When we arrived we were told we had a 30 minute wait at the most and waited an hour. Debating between Waffles and another brunch place originally, we were very disappointed in our decision to stay. After we were seated, my friend had been very excited about the blackboard tables to draw on-that we were watching people have fun with during our 60 min wait. We were at a wobbly blackboard table-no chalk...they could not locate any. What's the point of a blackboard table without chalk? We both ordered straight up Belgium waffles, mine had bacon on the side, and both had fresh squeezed OJ. The OJ was delicious-but it came in about a 5oz glass and was $4.50...it wasn't that good, WAY over priced, holy cow! Next, we waited for our waffles for at least 30 min which then came out cold and hard-yes, cold and hard for a place that is named waffles, and they forgot my bacon. Needles to say, we will NEVER be back here. I actually think the Golden Apple down the street from my house could out 'waffle' these people any day of the week.  Don't waste your time or money here.

We walked in, and were told to sit wherever we liked.  We picked a table, and were then told that we needed to be seated by somebody first.  What?  Okay.  He sat us, asked if we wanted orange juice, and said he'd be back with menus.  He came back five minutes later with menus and our glasses of juice. We looked at the menus and did a double take -- $4.50 for orange juice?  I was appalled. We ordered our breakfast.  I had the red velvet waffle and he chose the liege waffle with apples, which was nothing more than a waffle that appeared burnt with apple pie filling.  I am a red velvet connoisseur, so I know good red velvet and this was definitely not it.  It had zero flavor, and was dyed hot pink instead of the rich red that red velvet should be.  I have never had such a bland breakfast in my life. The ambiance, if you can call it that, has about as much ambiance as an auto garage or a gym.  The walls are grey with what seems like padding on the top in bright orange and yellow.

It was so bland, that I bathed the thing in Tabasco. My friend had the chipped beef hash which was equally bland. Without the voucher, this meal with tip would have been over $30 for two people for brunch. In a city full of diners and other great brunch spots, this was an epic fail. The other side of this too is the dinning room is very cramped. They stuff tables so close to each other. The couple at the table next to us was practically in our laps.

The waffles were different from the usual, but on the smaller portion size. We had the waffle Benedict and the waffle sampler and they tasted just okay.

Walk in and you'll see the place is cobbled together with an odd sense of style.  It's got a drop ceiling with most of its tiles missing.  The walls appear to be adorned with multi-colored gym mats. When I showed up on a Friday morning, there were only two employees running around through the entire place: one server, one busser.  And even though there were empty tables, we waited a good five minutes to be seated after the server acknowledged us. As soon as you sit down, your hope soars.  Our Groupon provided a flight of four hot chocolates.  Each of the four comes in a tiny shot glass-sized mug.  Smooth and really tasty.  This was the highlight of the meal. I went with the ""flight"" of waffles as well.  That's four tiny (fist-sized) waffles with what seem to be interesting flavors: red velvet, green tea, mexican chocolate, and liege with blackberries. The problem is, the waffles themselves only have a hint of flavor.  Especially if you remove the yogurt and strawberries from atop the red velvet, you'd taste virtually nothing.  The liege waffle sounds amazing on the menu (""rich, dense, sweet and chewy. made with pearl sugar, which caramelizes on the inside and outside of the waffle""), but it tastes like pizza crust.  Oh, and my liege waffle was burnt. Waffles does earn a point for the fun chalkboard tables.  It's a good way to pass time waiting for your overwhelmed server to return.  Just be careful you don't lean your elbows on the table and wreck your shirt.

The food was pretty disappointing. I got the huevos rancheros verde and it was not very good. Everything was incredibly mushy and didn't have much flavor to it. Also, not very filling. My boyfriend got an eggs, potato and pork shoulder dish, and everything was incredibly greasy. The potatoes weren't crisp at all, and didn't leave much to be desired.

After about an hour and 15 minutes we asked how long and the host said he would finally seat us. He made a mistake and put us in another waiting area because the table he thought could be ours was given to someone else. He apologized and said we would be seated next; however, he forgot about us and seated 4 other tables before we finally asked someone else for help. We ordered our food expecting it to come rather quickly, but it took about half an hour and when it finally arrived it was clear that it was not worth the wait.

I ordered the green tea waffle and it was supposed to come with several toppings, but it just came with a little bit of whipped cream smeared on it. For the price, the portions were small.

Having visited Waffles' South Loop location on multiple occasions, I was really excited when I heard a new location was opening right around the corner from my apartment. My first visit was in early January and I had a similar experience to other reviewers: no organization whatsoever when putting my name in, very little space to wait with a number of people crammed in front of the door, mediocre at best bus and wait service, and hit or miss food (my liege waffles were fine, the other person I was dining with had problems with their Benedict waffle). I'm also not a fan of chalk dust, but some people like the chalkboard tables so to each there own. Overall I thought that it may just be kinks they would work out so I decided to give them another shot.  The best thing I can say is that they are now taking people's names down on an iPad. I went back this past weekend and found the same mass of people crammed into the entry way and the same mediocre to rude service. After waiting to be seated we encountered a table that might have had one swipe of a rag run over it before being turned over. There were still multiple areas where crusted over food had been left from the previous occupants. We asked the hostess (manager?) if someone could clear off the table and based on her reaction you would have thought we had just made the most unreasonable request imaginable. After about 5 minutes of waiting and another request for help, we got up and left. I decided to spare myself from what was already shaping up to be another disappointing experience.

The night before I headed out to visit the restaurant, I checked Yelp and was of course disheartened to read so many negative reviews.

I walked into Waffles and there were a just a few tables taken, which was not surprising considering my midday, midweek arrival. My dining companion and I were seated promptly and took a moment to check out the menu. So may great choices! I can't wait to go back and try the Chihuaha cheese waffle with short ribs, but I settled on the ham and cheese waffle with cheddar and an egg on top. My companion got the chicken and bacon waffle. Both were fantastic. Mine had huge chunks or real ham in there - not this processed deli stuff. The cheese was delicious but not overwhelming. Hers was awesome as well. It comes with a spicy syrup that had a little zing to it but nothing crazy. It was perfect. We also enjoyed a flight of hot cocoas, which were the perfect size, considering we got three of them. The caramel was easily the best though the peppermint and chocolate were good as well.  What really stood out though was the service.

I ordered a half caff / half decaf coffee and he refilled it regularly and remembered every time that it was half caff. Excellent!  We also mentioned to him that we were interested in trying the red velvet waffles and the next thing we knew he brought out some mini ones for us to try, topped with strawberry sauce and with a side of cream cheese whipped cream. What a lovely touch!  He also told us that they recently started serving dinner as well - which is a big bonus since the last I'd read they were only breakfast/lunch spot.

2013-02-08,3.0,"I want to give Waffles a higher rating, especially since there are so few brunch places in the area (sorry, Hearty boys doesn't cut it). I think this Waffles can be a 4-starer and beyond, but it's just not quite there yet. We had the Liege waffles with blackberry, Waffle Benedict, and Mac & Cheese. The waffles themselves are good, but mine in the benedict dish were very burned, like almost black. Luckily I like things burned (my bagel is not done until it is fully charred on top) so I did not complain or send it back. As others have said, it seems they have a quality control issue. Some things come out fine, others overdone or under-done. As soon as they rectify this, it'll be a huge bump up to a 4-star rating. The pork was quite good in the benedict dish. The mac & cheese had bacon in it, which was not mentioned, so we had to send it back since one of us does not eat that. They were nice about it  and quick to bring one without, but it should say somewhere that it has bacon. It was good mac n cheese though, so that was a plus. The service was okay. Nothing stellar, but not too bad. Luckily I knew about the hot chocolate menu because of Yelp, so I ordered one. My husband was like, ""what? Where did you see that?!"" To which I replied jokingly, ""Oh, you didn't see the blackboard which is totally obscured by that wall?"" Our waiter did not offer it to us nor mention it. This is something that needs to be changed: that whole menu on the far wall away from the seating area is pointless. Make a mini-version for the table.

2013-02-07,5.0,"I want to start out by saying that the people who are giving this place 1 star for decor and 2 stars for being busy ON THE WEEKEND are a bunch of c**kbags. That being said, you need to review this place solely on food, service and ambiance. Everything else is back burner. And now: the review. My friend got a Groupon for this place and chose me to partake in brunch with her. We went on a Wednesday afternoon, which I know isn't a typical time to go, but we were both off that day. The place only had a handful of people at a time, so it was nowhere near busy. I admit, I didn't know what to expect walking into the place seeing the decor, but I had checked out the menu and knew exactly what I wanted. I came fully prepared to eat and let my palate to the judging. We were greeted by a server promptly with carafe of cucumber water. After reviewing the menus we were handed (though I already, of course, knew what I wanted), we were greeted again by another server, who we later found out was the manager. He was polite and fun, joking around with us. We told him of our Groupon and he got the flights of hot chocolate ready for us which was included in the deal.  Side Note: for those of you who don't know what a flight is, a ""flight"" refers to a SAMPLING of a food or beverage. A Tasting. I have seen reviews from others who were dismissing these adorable little mugs as ""thimble sized"", as they clearly didn't understand that it was supposed to be a sample of these three hot chocolates. What did you want, full mug-sized drinks? Then purchase them individually at a later time. That is what this particular offering is FOR. At any rate, they were incredibly rich and delicious. They offered caramel, dark chocolate and peppermint flavors. My friend and I agreed the caramel was the best flavor hands down. Before receiving our hot chocolate flights, we put our order in. It wasn't even 10 minutes before we had it in front of us. I ordered their version of chicken and waffles: Chicken & Bacon. It consisted of 3 golden waffles topped with a fried chicken leg and thigh and crispy crumbled bacon, all covered with spiced maple syrup. They also sprinkled scallion greens on top. I wasn't quite sure about this at first, but it actually did lend to the savory/sweet balance they were going for. I even asked for more spicy maple and I was gladly given a small container full. My friend ordered the Ham & Cheese. It consisted of ham and Cheddar cheese baked into the waffle itself, topped with a creamy cheese sauce and a fried egg. She liked her dish immensely. I took a sampling and was pleasantly surprised as well. We both really liked the idea of the ham being inside of the waffle, and all the elements of the dish balanced quite well. The real reason I am giving Waffle Cafe a 5 star review was because of service. The food was very good, but if I had been served by someone who didn't care about what he/they was/were doing, it wouldn't have made for an enjoyable experience. As I said before, the waitstaff was polite and accommodating, and our server and the manager were a huge standout. The manager was talking to us about the restaurant and offerings and even joked about hanging out with us when taking a break. I mentioned, jokingly, that when he did he would have to bring some Red Velvet Waffles so we could sample them. Not long after our meal, my friend ordered some coffee and we were having a chat. The manager came by with mini red velvet waffles, topped with strawberry compote and whipped cream. On the house. We were so delighted! I definitely would recommend this place to a friend. It was warm and charming and though the decor was a little hodge-podge for my taste, I didn't mind. If a place has that much personality and really good food, I wouldn't care if I was eating in an alley. Sure, decor adds to the ambiance of a place, but it's not the reason you go to a restaurant: THE FOOD IS. I had a great time overall, and that's why I gave it this 5 star rating. I hope this place continues to be an option for people who live and visit the Lakeview neighborhood.",0.9992,0.806,0.18,0.014,0.549080459770115

2013-02-05,3.0,"I bought a groupon here as it is in the neighborhood of one of my regular brunch buddies and she always seems to be the one traveling to see me and our other friends.   She arrived a bit before me and put our name in and was told that we would be texted when our table was ready.  Since we had about 30 minutes to kill and we discovered it was BYOB, we headed down to Jewel to pick up some bubbly to start Super Bowl Sunday off right.   We headed to Jewel and came back to Waffles 30 minutes after we put our name in.  The entry way was packed so we stood off to the side near the restrooms (15 feet from the hostess stand).  The text for our table finally came in, so we went up to be seated, only to be told that our table had been given away as they had been trying to contact us for 15 minutes.  My friend showed her text  history to prove we had only just been contacted and were standing 15 feet away.  We were told that we would get the next table.  Luckily it was just a minute or so later. We sat down and our server came right over.  He brought a bucket for our champagne and asked us if we wanted a glass or carafe of oj.  Since we had a whole bottle, carafe was the obvious choice (I'll get back to this later).  The oj was brought quickly after being freshly squeezed...you could definitely taste the freshness...yum. With my groupon, a hot chocolate flight was included in the meal.  The hot chocolate was definitely yummy (and sugary), but I don't think it was worth it for what you get and what is charged.   My friend and I were chatting and finally decided what to order for our meal.  I am a picky eater, but love sweets so I went with the waffle flight.  It was sugar coma heaven and was already planning my second trip to the gym that day to help ward off the impact of the waffles.  My friend got the short ribs with cheddar waffles.  I don't know how her waffles were, but I tried the short rib and it was like cutting butter and was so yummy. We continued our lazy brunch  conversation and of course had to finish off our mimosas.  Then the waiter brought our check and I was shocked at the price.  It was a good thing I had a groupon.  The oj ended up being $18.  It was fresh and yummy, and I do take a bit of blame for not asking the price, but it was not advertised on the menu and the waiter didn't give us a heads up even though he offered it.  For a $3 glass, I wouldn't expect the carafe to be $18....maybe $12 or $15. Technology issues need to be resolved to avoid future customer dissatisfaction, the table was way too small (not mentioned before, but with all the liquids we consumed there was barely room for our silverware, let alone food, but we did like that they were chalkboard surfaces and chalk was provided), and prices need to be disclosed on the menu or servers should alert customers.  Despite these adverse aspects to our meal, I definitely want to come back and get the short ribs for myself as well as try some of the other items that looked yummy.  I am hoping my next experience earns Waffles a 4 or 5 star rating...",0.9957,0.813,0.142,0.045,0.43480716143759635
2013-02-03,1.0,"I wish I could give a rating of 0 stars as my dining and social media experience dictated this as well deserved. First I should mention that I live near the South Loop location and my girlfriend and I have eaten there well over 20+ times and typically order the same thing each visit. This time my girlfriend and I went to Waffles on opening day at the Lakeview location because it's near her house and thought that we should check the new location out. We both expected a wait and some bumps in the road because it was their opening day, but what complicated it was their Groupon deal. I can understand that the deal would bring people out to the locations, however, when you haven't worked out the bumps in the road, the complications clearly showed through. However, I won't focus so much on the things that you expect from a brunch location on a Sunday, but rather focus on their food, and actions of their Facebook page manager, owner, and hostess. As we do at the South Loop location, we ordered 2 Liege Waffles with a Strawberry topping. After a 40 minute wait for food, the order arrives and resembles something so foreign we ask if this is the correct order. When we were assured it was our order we began to eat and immediately noticed something was wrong. The waffle was not cooked all the way and did not have any of the characteristics that made us fall in love with the dish in the first place. The inside of the waffle has the texture of raw dough while the outside was along the lines of burnt. Also, the strawberry topping was not the same, and tasted nothing like strawberries. Lastly, the more important thing that we noted was the size of the portion; the waffles were significantly smaller. With all of this noted we asked to speak to the hostess and expressed our concerns. Her reaction was that of shock and surprise and no attempts to understand what could enhance our experience. We did not finish our meal and proceeded to the register to pay.  The hostess was waiting at the register standing next to the owner of Waffles, but unlike the patrons who paid immediately before us, we were not asked how we enjoyed our meal. There was no mention as to what we thought was different between the two locations or how our experience could have been better. I paid and left very disappointed.  I then let Waffles know about my negative experience at their Lakeview location directly on their Facebook page and expected a response. However, my comment, along with two others who wrote about their negative experiences had their's deleted. A few days later I wrote another comment talking about my negative experience at the Lakeview location, how I have eaten at the South Loop location weekly for almost 4 months, and that my previous comment had been deleted. It was of no surprise that that comment was deleted as well.  Overall, the Lakeview location is god awful compared to the South Loop. I am more upset about their actions on Facebook, because rather than addressing my negative criticism and attempt to understand the root of my opinion, it was deleted to avoid any bad press and I was ignored.  You may ask why am I posting this so late, but after reading how Applebee's has handled firing an employee and their responses on Facebook, I felt it was necessary to write a review where it could not be deleted and others could see.",-0.9884,0.832,0.06,0.108,0.4234716041534224

2013-02-02,2.0,So excited when this place opened. The neighborhood could use a good brunch diner option beyond IHOP. But for now big fail. The service was comically disappointing especially at the front on the part of the host. Waiters were no better and there was confusion as to whom should serve us after we were seated. While they argued we watched a party of five get seated at a table for 4 and a party of 2 stayed at a table for six. The waffle was good and inventive though over priced and under portioned. The omelet and potatoes were awful like what my high school cafeteria would cook if they made breakfast. But at least their name isn't 'Omelets' or 'Good Service.'

That being said, the place looks like a bad hot dog joint that sells coke if you order takeout and say the secret word. The decor is awful, and the service is nearly just as bad.

We had one server put our name on ""the list"" (which totally didn't exist), then proceed to go and seat other people as they walked in the door ahead of us who were already waiting for a table. We had to track down and ask another one of the gaggle of servers just to seat us, which he did, but the fact we had to manage their wait list really shows how disorganized the place is. We asked 3 of our 5 servers for water and not one brought it. We asked for a small glass of OJ for our champagne to make mimosas, and we got charged $4.50 each for a glass of OJ. $9.00 for a splash of OJ? That cost more than the champagne!

We also ordered the pancakes (with blueberries and lemon curd) and the Wisconsin and Short Rib Waffle. Both were really, really delicious, although a bit small.

2013-01-26,2.0,"I ventured down to the city on a Saturday afternoon to meet up with my friends, who are now city dwellers, and our journey brought us to Waffles. I was excited, even though I'm not a huge waffle guy. Upon arrival, the host took my friends phone number, and we were seated fairly quickly (party of 4). The menu is pretty limited, but it's mostly waffles, eggs, breakfast meat, and some sandwiches. The waffle selections are pretty diverse. Among them are the red velvet for the sweet tooths, and a short rib and cheddar waffle for the savory crowd.  I ordered the Whole wheat waffle topped with yogurt and granola. I opted not to have strawberries on the waffle because of the compote, so I had fresh ones on the side. I also requested sugar free syrup (1.00 charge). I changed my  mind upon the dish arriving, but was still charged. I also ordered a side of 2 eggs over medium. The 3 waffles were tasty, but nothing amazing. I'm more of a pancake guy to be honest. Also, I did like the chives on the side of eggs. As I write this review, I'm debating between a 2 and 3 star. Anyways, my friend ordered the waffle benedict, which was waffles topped with pork and poached eggs. Both of us ended up being hungry because our portions were pretty small, so we then decided to split an order of the green tea waffles. These were the money maker!!!  They came with some sort of cream topping, which was tangy and sweet, and very good. It was also pretty neat (nice word) how the batter of the waffle was slightly green, hence the green tea waffle. My other two friends did not get waffles. One of them ordered eggs, potatoes, and bacon. I finished off his egg because he's a wimp and has a small stomach. FInally, the best part of the meal was my friends grilled cheese, which he generously shared. Three slices of bread with cream cheese, red onion, and tomato. Definitely the tastiest and most memorable dish. You're probably thinking to yourself, wow, did you eat off of everyone's plate? And yeah, I DID! Gotta be fair in rating the whole experience of the restaurant! As for the decor and service, it's subpar. I don't know if the ceiling is meant to having missing tiles, hence making it look like a waffle, but it was weird. Also, the prices are steep, but that's the suburb talking in me. Also, the waiter wasn't that great, and the food took longer than 20 mins. This isn't a huge restaurant, but COME ON! The waiter also didn't even give us an option to split checks, so we were huge pains in the asses when we had to get our check split. It wasn't a big deal, except it seemed everyone else was leaving the place at the same time. In conclusion, Waffles is average at best. My one friend suggested Wishbone or Bakin and Eggs, and I wish we would have done that. It was my fault because I asked another friend of mine where he wanted to go, and he said Waffles, and that was it. Oops. I can honestly say that I'll probably never go back, unless I have some sort of incentive. Plus I'm a pancake guy, so going here in the first place is a battle. I'm sure there are much better places in the wrigleyville neighborhood, but I have no idea. I am updating my review from saturday, and bringing waffles down to 2 stars. The reason? My bill was 17.00... I tipped 3.00, for an even 20. Now mind you, I was charged an extra dollar for syrup I didn't get, and then on top of it, readin gmy credit card statement today...they charged me 21!

The waiting was a mess.  After half an hour, we were told ""our"" table was ready ( notice the word ""our"" in quotations because this is going to get interesting).

The restaurant gives the kids chalk to doodle on the tables while they eat.  So, the next person to sit in the table is left with a chalky dirty table.  Watch your sleeves people because u won't only have a terrible experience, you will need to do Landry later. After getting up to go to the register to pay, I wanted to buy some of the cookies in the glass cabinets.  It was sad to watch the lady behind the counter, scramble and look for containers for the desserts. Once she got the containers a couple of minutes later, it was depressing to watch her try and open the glass cabinets because she didn't know how to open them.  She almost broke them while trying to open them with a screw driver....

Now, I am not a complainer...this restaurant has potential, as I said the food is delicious...but in this day and age... just because you have a demand, does not mean you can skimp on the service to your customers!! This restaurant replaced a restaurant that was there for 15 years. If they want to continue in this neighborhood they better do a lot better. One of my friends on Facebook wrote something horrible and this friend happens to be a columnist for the RedEye... so you see where I am going. to succeed, either hire a staff that wants to work, or go out of busines. and I am told that the South Loop location is even worse!!",0.9596,0.845,0.094,0.062,0.4941171165435872
2013-01-20,1.0,"My girlfriend and I have tried twice to eat here, and both times we have walked away either before or immediately after being seated. That being said, I cannot comment on the quality of their food, but I can comment on their service as I've experienced it and their problems with layout and Groupons.  Let's start with the layout and getting seated. Their front entrance is very small, and in it is crammed seating for diners (which must be a lovely experience, eating with a mob of people brushing against the back of your chair), the counter where you are supposed to check in, and the register where you expected to return in order to pay for your meal. I would guess that this high traffic, crowded area is no more than 35 feet squared. You will bump into someone.  Now comes the part where you try to get a table. If you can find someone, or get any employee to pay attention to you, you give them your name and the size of your party. Normally at this point you'd expect a human being to tell you how long the wait might be for your table, but here you'll be asked your name again and then asked to provide them your cell phone number so they can text you that information. Personally, I don't like giving out my number to anyone I don't know. Too many advertising related texts from bartenders in the past. There doesn't appear to be an alternative available, since no employee offered to give me the information verbally on my first visit. I was then texted that my wait time- for waffles- would be 40 minutes. We left and dined on burgers instead that time.  This most recent visit we actually got to be seated! Table for two Sunday brunch with my girlfriend here we go! Except we were seated at the same table as another party. Which, if you're a theme restaurant might be OK, but this is a small place where we were seated directly next to another party at a smallish table. Before we even sat down (and I'd like to point out the server showed us the table and left, no drink orders being taken, not even water being poured) we heard the server speaking to other party at our table that they weren't accepting any Groupons because of ""the holiday"". This was the day *before* MLK day. Not only was it not a holiday, there was no signage or any notice of any kind saying they would not accept the Groupon. Since the Groupon was the whole reason we were trying this restaurant we left. We didn't even sit down.  This restaurant is trying to be too complex and cutting edge while sacrificing service in an apparent attempt to stay in the black. They need to step back, simplify things, maybe move some of that seating out of their lobby and focus on the customers instead of their bright front of house ideas. I'm not going back though.",0.6554,0.866,0.066,0.068,0.38344729344729356

I did notice groups being seated at odd tables, like other reviewers noted, with large groups at small tables and small groups at large tables. Service was pretty bad once everything started filling up. Despite being asked by multiple people about coffee refills, it took a long time to actually get the coffee and in the end wasn't worth it.  Food was OK but way over priced. The torta was the best order, although it would have been a lot better with a better, smaller bun. Chilaquiles were served without eggs (although we were later told they were ""scrambled into the dish""), which was disappointing. Cheddar and short ribs were decent, although the waffles didn't have any cheese flavor. Same with the waffle tasting.  With so many other great brunch places in Chicago, this one isn't worth the time or money. Even for people living in the neighborhood. And with a tab of over $80 for 4 people, it is way overpriced. I also must note that it is EXTREMELY INAPPROPRIATE TO OFFER MILK AND COOKIES AS A CHILD'S MENU OPTION FOR BRUNCH. While I understand that Waffles isn't going for health, I cannot believe that someone finds this acceptable to add on a menu at anytime.

2013-01-18,3.0,"I purchased a Travel Zoo deal to eat here: $19 for two entrees and two drinks. Three of us dined and had the following: 1. The heart healthy waffle, which came with strawberries 2. The albondigas waffle (made with cheese, covered with mint, and served with albondigas/meatballs) 3. The sampler platter, which came with four small waffles 4. Two hot chocolate flights 5. One coffee I was most excited about those hot chocolate flights, but for $6.95, you only get three hot chocolates and they are served in mugs the size of shot glasses. The albondigas waffle was great, as were the liege and green tea waffles in the sampler platter. The red velvet waffle was, surprisingly, sub-par. It was coated in cream cheese icing, which was just too overpowering. We showed up a little after 10:00 on a Saturday, which was early enough to beat the rush. When we left, the place was overflowing with people waiting to get in, and the restaurant seemed understaffed and unsure of how to deal with everyone. My guess is that they've put out way too many of these deals  (mine was Travel Zoo but I've also seen them pushing the same thing on Groupon) and can't really meet the demand. Service was slow but polite. I wonder if this place just needs to settle in more and then it'll improve. I think the food is good, but a little overpriced. Those hot chocolate flights should either be larger or there should be 5 of them, not 3. I'd check Waffles out again in six months to see if they've gotten their act together.

Here's what we ordered: - Flight of Hot Chocolate: Came with three lil cups of hot chocolate. Peppermint, chocolate, and caramel. All were really really really sweet. The peppermint did not taste like peppermint at all. It was just candy. The caramel one was also too sweet. The only decent one was the hot chocolate one....I guess cause it actually tasted somewhat like hot chocolate. - Chicken and bacon waffles: The waffles were good and then chicken was good. Nothing impressive. It was one of those not bad, but not impressive dishes. - Ham & Cheese waffle: My friend got this and said it was just ""whatever"". It was two waffles with yellow gooey cheese and a sunny side up egg on top. He was still hungry after eating it. - Orange juice: smaller than a tall coffee at starbucks. It is ""fresh squeezed"", but is room temperature. Also cost $4.50. NOT worth it.  The slow service and the mediocre food will not have us coming back.

When we got there it looked like there was only one waiter and a lot of dirty tables. He told us to pick whichever table we wanted so we chose one close to the door and he redirected us to a dirty booth, which is fine they cleaned it quickly.  The waiter came by fairly quickly to take our drink orders, we both got the hot chocolate flight with the groupon and my husband ordered a coffee. The coffee came in a tiny cup that the waiter only refilled 1 time, boo. The waiter came back almost 20 minutes later to take our order, asked us what we wanted and then went to the table next to us when I started talking--so that was weird. He took our order after the table next to us and I got the pancakes with blueberries and banana and a side of eggs scrambled. My husband got the Huevos Rancheros. The food came about 20 minutes later-although we still had not received out Hot chocolate flight.  The pancakes were good, nothing amazing but good I liked the fruit. The side of scrambled eggs was gross, it seemed like powered eggs mixed with taco seasoning. I couldn't even eat half of them and I love eggs. My husband also did not like his Huevos rancheros and he likes everything. When we were finished eating our hot chocolate flights finally came, which I thought were the best part but I would not spend $7 on them without the Groupon.

Saturday morning and a hankering for waffles. Get there and told one hour wait. Ok, can do some shopping, but doesn't help fill a puppy's belly. Finally seated and service was a little slw. The menu is intriguing and curious but limiting. A flight of so-so hot chocolate starts us off. Chocolate isn't good for a puppy so you can skip this step. Had fun drawing on the table while we waited and waited for food. Portions were small and expensive. Had to order an extra bone just to be filled.  For two with a very simple Mel, the cost was $50.

2013-01-07,2.0,"I'd actually give this place 2.5 stars if I could (instead of 2), but since I can't ... It seems that the Waffles in South Loop was so popular that they recently opened up this second location in Lakeview. When I say recent, I mean it - December 2012 - and I think it showed in my experience today (mishaps detailed below). What I hope that means, though, is that with time, the restaurant will get better and iron out a lot of its current wrinkles. I still probably wouldn't come back, though, because Chicago has too many amazing brunch places to choose from as it is (mmm, Bongo Room!) --- Got here around 1pm on a Sunday morning and there was a 40 minute wait. My roommate and I killed time at the nearby thrift store Brown Elephant, and sure enough, were seated when we returned about 40 minutes later. The first thing I noticed were the tables - all of them were painted with chalkboard paint, so that you could draw on the table (or play tic tac toe) with colored chalk. A cute concept that won points in my book (could be a life saver if your date turns sour...?) Although I loved the decor, the food wasn't as impressive. My roommate ordered the chicken and bacon waffles, as well as the hot chocolate flight; I got the waffle flight (green tea, red velvet, mexican chocolate, and liege) and the lavender iced tea (sounded too exotic to resist). Here's how the food stacked up: Lavender Iced Tea: interesting, though not my favorite (guess I don't like the combination). Not too sweet, though, so that was good Hot Chocolate Flight: comes with 3 mini cups (really tiny); these tasted extremely watery and came out lukewarm in temperature ...  Waffle Flight: 4 waffles may sound like a lot of food, but since all 4 waffles are kind of small, it wasn't a huge portion. My favorites, in order, were: liege, mexican chocolate, green tea, red velvet. To be honest, the green tea waffle didn't have any discernible green tea taste (as an Asian, this was especially disappointing to me, sigh). But I actually really liked the liege, and if I could go back in time, would have gotten that by itself instead. Chicken & Bacon Waffle: our chicken was undercooked. Normally, this is pretty hard to do (... it's chicken!) but the meat was red and even bloody, close to the bone. Nor did it seem like a one-off mistake - the man at the table next to us, on his way out, noticed my roommate's grimace and told us he had the same exact thing. Once we told the waiter, he apologized and offered to give us another round of the dish. The second time around, it was cooked just fine (and piping warm, which wasn't the case the first time). But there are clearly some issues with consistency ... We'd waited a very long time for the food, too, which made it all the more disappointing when we finally got it. Although I really wanted to love it (I'm generally a huge fan of brunch), Waffles fell pretty short of expectations - the food wasn't amazing, and the portions are definitely on the smaller side (compare to places like the Original Pancake House, Eggsperience, Hash House, etc.). If you do decide to come in the next few days, though, make sure to buy the groupon! (We were like, the only people in the restaurant who didn't ...)",0.9964,0.761,0.162,0.077,0.5262432249322493

To sum up: - Slow,  inattentive service (water was not refilled until we were able to flag down a waiter several times, had to ask server to come clear our plates and hot chocolate flights) - Hot chocolate flight was a bit pricy, only one flavor of the 3 was actually good, perhaps because that one actually tasted like chocolate while the others I really had no idea what flavor they were going after.  - Shortrib waffles were just incredibly salty, I half expected it to be the tender meat that falls off the bone but it really just wasnt.  - Packed on weekend brunch time, expect 30 minutes wait or longer in prime brunch times which is I guess pretty normal but the lack of staff training made the Emo chick hostess seem just too dazed and confused to handle the large crowd.  - Odd, inefficient seating arrangements where there were 2 people seated in 4 person or 8 person tables - Fun brunch concept  - Would be good alternative to Ihop if they are able to execute better",0.9255,0.834,0.112,0.054,0.4889153439153438

The service was a little odd- the hostess sat us, and then came back to get us drinks (coffee and the hot chocolate flights); while that was going on, someone else came up and said he would get the hot chocolate flights, so we had to tell him someone else was already on it; and then a third server came by to take our order with a very offhand manner - we had to call him back to the table to finish taking the order.  The hot chocolate flights were okay, though we weren't told what the flavors were. One seemed to be raspberry, and it had some chunky substance in it (raspberry puree?) that was a little strange to drink down. The caramel hot chocolate was way too sweet -  so I ended up dumping it in my coffee, which actually came out pretty good. I ordered the waffle flight, and partner got  the brussels waffle with the apple filling (we had to call the server back to specify our topping, which the menu made sound like came with the waffle but the server didn't ask if we wanted it/ which one we wanted.) The brussels waffle was the winner - or at least it was the least not-good. Nice texture, but a yeasty flavor, not vanilla-y at all which is how I like my maple-syrup vehicles. I didn't like any of the waffles in the flight at all. The red velvet waffle was a little salty and the cream cheese topping was like pure cream cheese - a  little heavy. The green tea waffle had an actively unpleasant flavor - a little tangy and sour. The mexican chocolate waffle didn't really have much of a flavor at all, and the liege waffle was really dense, chewy, and tasteless. Maybe these waffles would be a better base for a savory topping, but I wouldn't want to eat any of them again. Then to pay, you take the bill to the front register, and rather than pay at a side counter with plenty of space, they waved us around to the front, which was full of other people waiting to eat and a little difficult to maneuver through.

It's close to home and there were other things on the menu I'd like to try (like the hot chocolate flight) so I'm willing to give them some time to work things out and may visit again.",0.9011,0.886,0.114,0.0,0.365391156462585
2013-01-02,4.0,"I was going to buy a Groupon for this place but then decided against it since I wasn't sure that I would ever use it since I rarely get opportunities for brunch. My bf and I stopped by on New Year's Eve morning and there were few tables occupied. They told us to sit anywhere so we picked a booth and the two of us had plenty of space. They don't have their hot chocolate flavors listed on the menu though so make sure to pay attention to the board when you walk in or sit at a table where you can see it. The dark chocolate hot chocolate was excellent as was the caramel hot chocolate. The menu doesn't provide you with a lot of options but I feel like with a lot of these specialty places that's what you get. They do serve lunch so if you're not feeling eggs and waffles, it's a good option.  We decided to get two different kinds of waffles and then split it. I ordered the Mexican Chocolate waffle which had coco powder baked inside as well as some orange sauce on top. It was good but not super chocolatey and not too sweet. We also ordered the Heart Healthy Waffle which were whole wheat with strawberries, yogurt, and granola on top. It was amazing! I wasn't a big fan of the Mexican Chocolate but I would order the Heart Healthy again for sure. The bf also ordered a side of bacon well done and crispy and it came out perfectly. I would be game to try the Waffle Benedict next time around though. We didn't experience slow service, there weren't a lot of people in the restaurant but we didn't wait long for our food and our plates were cleared in a timely fashion. It was a bit pricey, about $35 before tip for the two of us. A couple two tables over tried to use their Groupon and the server wouldn't allow it since it was a ""holiday"" being New Year's Eve and all. I know I would have been a little upset but they let it go.",0.9649,0.801,0.119,0.079,0.5544507575757575
2012-12-31,1.0,"I love traveling around the city and trying a different breakfast place each morning...and this was by far one of the WORST experiences I have ever had for breakfast.  For a place called ""waffles"" these are HORRIBLE. I should preface this review by stating that I went to their original location and hated the food/crammed atmosphere...but I wanted to give the restaurant a second shot.  So, to be fair I ordered the waffle flight just in case I ""picked the wrong menu item"" the time before.  The waffles had a horrible after taste - they have interesting items like red velvet, green tea, etc.  But they were incredible dense and tasted heavily of baking-soda (or something close.) The only people in the restaurant who seemed to enjoy their food, appeared to be ordering their eggs.  Which would be great if it was Yolk!  My recommendation = forget Waffles (ditch your Groupons/TravelZoo and other vouchers - it isn't worth it!)  If you are looking for amazing flavors (the very same red velvet AND eggs) ... head to Yolk ( eatyolk.com ) instead.",0.3644,0.752,0.13,0.118,0.6015625000000001
2012-12-29,4.0,"I love going out for breakfast.  It's one of my favorite things to do when I first wake up in the morning (the other we can't talk about here, this is a family website).   When I saw Waffles opening up so very close to my place I was pretty excited.  I've already taken myself out for breakfast here a couple times, and I have plans to go back.  The decor is a little....jarring?  Doesn't really call to mind a cozy just-got-out-of-bed-need-something-yummy feeling.  But, it'll do. The menu has lots of creative waffle dishes as well as other breakfast and lunch options.  So far I've tried the red velvet waffles and the cheddar and spare ribs waffles.  Both were very good.  My only complaint is that the thin dent part of the waffle (I'm sorely unacquainted with waffle anatomy, I don't know if the parts have names) was almost burnt on both dishes.  With the cheese waffle I figured it was due to the cheese caramelizing, but I can't make excuses for the red velvet waffle.  Fix that and I might hand over the 5th star.  They have a lot of different syrup choices for coffee, tea, or hot chocolate.  I had earl grey tea with lavender syrup in it, it was delicious.   The service has been good on my visits, attentive enough but not hovering.  The server helped me decide what to get, which I always love.  Today I told him I couldn't decide between the red velvet and the mexican chocolate waffles and he said ""you'll have the red velvet""; I adore being told what to order in a restaurant.   Next time; beef brisket hash.  I don't know how I've waited this long to try it, seems if there's a hash on the menu it's just my instinct to order it",0.9893,0.862,0.133,0.005,0.498131313131313
2012-12-29,2.0,"Four of my friends and I went to Waffles today. We all live in the neighborhood and were really excited a new brunch place was opening up that was closer than Ann Sathers. I will agree with previous posts that their decor was a bit strange for a breakfast place. It was really frustrating watching them sit parties of two at 6 and 8 tops when there was clearly several larger groups waiting. We eventually squeezed in at a booth made for 4 with a chair at the end. Service was poor at best.  They brought out our drinks at first, but not the water---we had to ask twice. The fresh squeezed orange juice was great and the hot chocolate flight was awesome once it go to the table (probably 15 minutes after we ordered it). Three of the five plates came out together.  The fourth came out 5 minutes later and the fifth plate finally came 10-15 minutes after the first plate came out (they eventually took that off the bill). Our food was hot -- just poorly timed.  Everyone fully enjoyed their food.  They even made dietary accommodations for our friend, without making a stink.  We ran out of water half way through eating, and had to ask 3 different people. We eventually got it after receiving the bill. They never cleared the hot chocolate flight (which was done before we got the food) - and remember we are crammed on a too small table, so the extra space would have been welcomed. The food was good enough that we all decided that we would wait another 2-3 months to go back to let them work out their kinks (and boy do they have a lot of them). Frankly - not sure if they can last that long with their poor service -- there are too many other great brunch places in the neighborhood for them to just relax on good food and horrid service. In the mean time, we'll continue to walk a few blocks further to Ann Sathers for quick and amazing food and great service.",0.9951,0.767,0.181,0.052,0.5016500229568411
2012-12-29,4.0,"I was excited when I heard that one of my favorite brunch places had opened another location in Lakeview! They have a great selection of waffles, eggs & sandwiches. My favorite is the red velvet waffle. Also, definitely try the side of breakfast potatoes that are first baked and then flash fried to get a crispy skin on the outside and a soft baked inside. And if you're going there on a weekend, be prepared for a 30-45 minutes wait time!",0.9492,0.791,0.209,0.0,0.5259259259259258
2012-12-29,2.0,"I have frequented the South Loop location many times, so when I heard a new location was opening in Uptown, I did not waste anytime purchasing the Groupon for the new location.  This location is a tad smaller than the SL location. The doorway was jam-packed with patrons waiting to be seated. Similar to SL location, the cashier is front and center upon walking in, but with the crowd of people, I had to surf through to find the hostess. The hostess ignored my polite question of, ""hi, may I put my name down?"" by basically shoulder-checking me to call another party. I thought maybe he didn't hear me, but nonetheless, I still did not receive an ""excuse me"". I was seated fairly fast, about 15 minute wait. The waiter promptly brought us our hot chocolate flights. They were all delicious, except for the peppermint flavor (it tasted like cough medicine). After waiting about 20 minutes more for the waiter to return to take our order (I was with my boyfriend), we ordered and waited about an hour. YES! an hour! The waiter brought out a small pair of 'heart healthy' waffles to apologize for the wait, but they were burnt and cold. SHEESH! Finally our food arrives, and the portions were smaller than I remembered. I had the beef brisket and eggs and my boyfriend had the bacon waffles and chicken. The food was good, but after waiting so long I was more worried about the parking meter expiring than enjoying my food.  Environment: The decorating was terrible. The walls looked like they were part of a grade school gymnasium. The drop ceiling squares were painted in different colors, the ones that were actually there. Otherwise, the ceiling above you is mostly a dark gray and ventilation system (exposed). Also, there are 2x4's to close the gaps between the wall and ceiling in certain places. I was very surprised to see this location like this considering I'm a frequent flier at the SL location.  Service: I used to wait so I think I'm more peculiar than most patrons. But I do have to say that basic service principles were missing. There was no designated area for the hostess, leaving first-timers to stand in the checkout line, than signing in, causing them to fall further back on the list than needed. Seeing that the space is limited, the cashier that was front and center should have occasionally let people know that a hostess would have come around shortly to take their names.  The waiter was polite, but did not clear the table as needed. There are many things on the table, cups for water, cups of coffee, vase for flower, vase for water, so to not clear what isn't being used makes the table congested.  Even after the food was brought out, the waiter still not clear the plate that held the 'I'm sorry your food took so long to come out' plate of sample waffles; which added more clutter.  Also, this may really seem anal, but I do not think that the staff were conscious of the layout of the restaurant yet. They were bumping into seated patrons, into each other, and it made it very distracting.  OVERALL I gave this place 2/5 since the food wasn't terrible, but was weighed down by all of the negative factors. Maybe in time when the kinks are worked out this place will be better. I do not think it will ever be the same status as the SL location. I would suggest making it over to the SL location if you're a looking to really enjoy your time and food.",0.9327,0.846,0.085,0.068,0.4457822779856677
2012-12-29,2.0,"The only reason this restaurant gets 2 stars and not 1 is that they make really good hot chocolate. If you want good hot chocolate, take some to go. If you want good waffles go somewhere else. The waffle flavors, while great concepts like red velvet, are just weird in execution. The waffles come out lukewarm and the service is awful. It's incredibly slow with too few servers for the number of tables on a busy weekend. There are too many good breakfast places in Chicago to bother with this one.",0.9346,0.714,0.219,0.067,0.61

The orange juice machine looks like a Zamboni. The ceiling is truly industrial chic. The wait staff is soooo nice! Come early if you don't like to wait!

2012-12-27,4.0,"Problem:  It's two days after Christmas.  You aren't ready to start on your resolution list for the upcoming new year.  You're hungry.  You can't eat any more leftover mashed potatoes, as if eating leftover mashed potatoes were any fun to begin with. Solution:  Waffles new location in Lakeview!  Hooray!  I hesitate to add this first review lest more people find out about it, but it's all good.  Hopefully we'll be able to squeeze in the door once the crowds start filling it up. Review:   Location:  This is the same premise and ownership group as the successful restaurant of the same name in the South Loop.  The upshot is that this one is in Lakeview at the intersection of Broadway and Addison.  (Weird intersection to envision, I know--think a block south of the IHOP on the left side of the road and you're there.)  Groovy wife and I visited at around 10:30 on a Thursday, which was a fantastic time to go.  On street parking was plentiful. Atmosphere:  Plenty of available seating--small tables, large tables, and booths.  Plenty of choices and we were invited to seat ourselves.  The greeter mentioned that this was the case on weekdays, but there were lines out the door on weekends.  We settled into a comfortable booth with a view of the snow falling on Broadway.  Water and coffee were offered immediately.  We don't have kiddos, but if we did, I suspect this would be a fun spot.  The tabletops are painted with chalkboard paint, and a jar o' chalk is there for your amusement.  LCD TV's on the walls running Sportscenter.  Good light, not too much noise.   Menu:  Yes, there are creative waffles which was what brought us in on this snowy day, but for the more lunch-oriented set among the brunch crowd, there were a dozen good looking sandwich and salad options as well.  Prices were aligned with anything else you'd find in the neighborhood. -The Waffles:  Green Tea Waffles?  Cheddar and Short Rib Waffles?  ALBONDIGAS WAFFLES??  HAVE YOU LOST YOUR MINDS??  Too many cool options to choose from.  Luckily for me, as a professional fat kid, I didn't have to settle for just one.  They offered a ""Waffle Flight"" which enabled me to enjoy four varieties.  I ordered this, and received one red velvet, green tea, Brussels waffle, and liege waffle.  Groovy wife went all in for the green tea waffles and didn't regret it.  The green tea waffle (both the large variety she ordered and the flight portion I ordered) were light and interesting.  They come with a lemon-ginger chantilly-style creme on top and plenty of ground pistachios.  They were the highlight on the plate for us.  The red velvet waffle, while interesting was a tad sweet for my taste, but that's what they were going for.  The Brussels waffle was a great standby, and the liege was nice and chewy, just how it should be. -Beverages:  Groovy wife had the ginger-orange juice.  She said the ginger ""got her attention.""  I had a basic cup of coffee.  Free refills.  We shared the ""hot chocolate flight"" which was a lot of fun.  Six espresso-sized hot-chocolates, two each of caramel, Mexican chocolate, and peppermint.  These were terrific and worth the trip even if you didn't have the waffles. Service:  Achieved the ""Goldilocks position""...not too little attention, not too much attention....just right.   In sum, this place will do really well given its location and the great offerings.  They really are only trying to do one thing, and they do it very, very well.  We'll definitely be back.",0.9989,0.783,0.191,0.026,0.4698133560428642
2012-12-27,1.0,"We went to Waffles on 12/22 around 1:00pm (I only gave the time to let you know it wasn't a crazy morning rush or anything, we were sat right away) because we had purchased a Groupon that included two flights of hot chocolate and two entrees.  We were seated by a 10 year old girl (I'm guessing the owners daughter) which made us smile, but that smile quickly disappeared as we waited ~15-20 minutes for the server to greet us.  I explained I had a Groupon and asked if any of the entrees weren't included, he said everything was included except steak and eggs.  He said he would grab our flight of hot chocolate and came back about 5 minutes later with the hot chocolate, answered one question we had, and then said he would be right back for our order... ~15 minutes later he returned to take our order.  So far we are at about 35 minutes before our order was placed.  About 20 minutes, later my girlfriend's waffles with fresh strawberries come out and the server says he'll be right back with my pork Benedict waffles.  I told my girlfriend to start eating since we had been there almost an hour.  She takes her first bite and asks me if waffles are supposed to be served hot or cold because hers are cold.  I told her warm and asked if she wanted to send them back, she said no since at this point we were starving and continued eating.  Despite them being cold she liked them a lot.  Now another 5 minutes have gone by and my food still has not come out...I am getting annoyed.  Finally I see a server walking from the kitchen with my dish, but to my disbelief they walk right past me to the table next to mine.  He serves a single gentleman who I know arrived about 15 minutes after us and placed his order after me... now I am very upset... the server looks at me and probably could read my face and said yours will be out next... only because I timed it, I know that 9 minutes after my girlfriend received her meal I received mine... almost an hour and 15 minutes after being seated.   The pork Benedict on a waffle was actually pretty good but the poor service left such a bad taste in my mouth I could barely enjoy it.  At no point did the server or anyone in the restaurant make any attempt to apologize for the wait or service issue.  I think this location opened a week earlier on 12/12 so maybe it was opening week jitters; unfortunately it wasn't a good first impression for us.  We won't be returning anytime soon.",0.7077,0.863,0.076,0.061,0.5091765873015874
