2015-11-01,5.0,"Hidden in the Portage Park neighborhood in storefront location, The Portage is a wonderful gem of a restaurant.  Cozy warm decor, friendly staff, attentive service and good food to boot!  While off the beaten path, The Portage is convenient to the suburbs, O'Hare area hotels and downtown - just have to venture a visit. We visited on a whim for a weekend night couples get-away dinner.  The Portage changes the menu seasonally and we enjoyed the fall options which had a variety of root vegetable and squash inclusive dishes.  There is a bit of Asian fusion and spice in most of the dishes which suits my palate.  The parsnip soup with a dash of chili oil was very tasty.  I tried the roasted red beet salad (which were actually golden beets the night of our visit) and was pleased by the flavors of the beets, greens and kimchi. The bar menu has some terrific options with some house-made add-ins - some sweet, some savory.  The in-house tonic was very tasty for those who enjoy a bitter palate.  The wine menu is not extensive but very reasonably priced. For entrees, we tried the chicken dish which has a piece of fried and a piece of roasted so you don't feel over indulgent.  The scallion pancake was interesting and a nice accompaniment (although we thought that it would have been better with a potato pancake),  I enjoyed the vegetarian potstickers which were very good. Just a few dessert options and we tried the seasonal pumpkin cupcake.  Yum. I can't say enough about the attentive service.  Great job!",0.9898,0.828,0.158,0.014,0.5944086021505376

2015-08-09,4.0,"A group of us came to The Portage for dinner; I was pretty excited in checking this place out, as it's considered a hidden gem in the Portage Park neighborhood.  The cuisine is a fusion of American and Asian, and the menu consists of starters, soups, salads, entrees, and desserts. They also have a bar as well as an extensive wine list.  We started off with the Blistered Shishito Peppers (mizuna greens, Parmesan fonduta, pickled radish, and basil - a salad that was creamy from the fonduta, but not too heavy).  For the entrees, we tried: the Grilled Berkshire Pork Secreto (with sweet red chili sauce, lemongrass, Chinese longbeans, egg yolk, rice noodles, and a Korean lemon; this was my favorite dish of the night, as the sliced pork was cooked wonderfully and was so flavorful!); the Vietnamese Pork Meatballs (came with egg noodles, shitake mushrooms, smoked cream fraiche, white kimchi, asparagus, and basil; the meatballs, although I was slightly apprehensive about, were actually savory and tasty, and cooked all the way through; the egg noodles were yummy and and a nice touch; kind of reminded me of a Vietnamese version of beef stroganoff!); the Grilled Baby Octopus (with cauliflower puree, spiced lentils, pickled shishitos, shaved fennel salad, plum dressing, and a confit potato; this was my least favorite, as it was just bland; the lentils, while stating to be spiced, were flavorless, and the grilled octopus didn't really have much of a grilled taste to them); the Sea Scallops (with avocado puree, braised short rib, grapefruit, pickled jalapeno, sweet soy, and roasted spring onions; the scallops were cooked perfectly and they were plump, but it tasted just like it was cooked in a little bit butter); and, the Grilled CDK Skirt Steak (with roasted watermelon radishes, bulgogi sauce, grilled spring onion, crispy vermicelli, and cauliflower puree; this was cooked well and had a good flavor to it; I loved the end pieces!).  For dessert, we had: the Pretzel Chocolate Bread Pudding (with peanut butter sorbet, whipped honey, and caramel corn - this was an interesting combination of textures); the Cream Filled Fritters (caramel, red bean, and buttered popcorn ice cream; this was my favorite dessert of the night, as these little fritters were not overly sweet and just a great way to end a meal); a Plum Cobbler (pine nut crumble, vanilla bean ice cream, and Thai basil; this was very tart, and the ice cream melted right away from the heat; this was my least favorite); and, the Avocado Cake (tasted similar to a zucchini cake, this was very moist and quite yummy).  Service was awesome, as everyone was just so friendly, attentive, and patient.  The restaurant itself is small, but cute, and has a very relaxed vibe to it.  I'd love to check out their Monthly Dinners, in which they have pairings with a multi-course dinner.  Definitely a gem to check out! +Blistered Shishito Peppers +Grilled Berkshire Pork Secreto +Vietnamese Pork Meatballs +Cream Filled Fritters +Pretzel Chocolate Bread Pudding +friendly staff and service :D +free residential parking around the area",0.9989,0.808,0.189,0.003,0.5632524707996405
2015-07-21,4.0,"I've always wanted to try this place out but never really got a chance until now.  From looking at the menu this is a restaurant you'd expect to find in Logan square or wicker park so it's kinda refreshing to see a place like this closer to home. Went with my family as soon as they opened at 5pm on a Saturday. It wasn't too busy but filled up a bit by the time we left.  We started with the crab cakes, fries and short rib dumplings and they were all really good. The fries were definitely crispy enough and the miso aioli (mayo) was something you wouldn't expect.  I definitely had trouble making up my mind on my main. Went with the Vietnamese meatballs and there were awesome. Spiced just enough and came with a bunch of egg noodles. I was looking over at the Amish chicken and was a little jealous though. I had a taste and that's what I'd get if I went again.   The peanut paste that was on that plate is what's up.  They even overheard it was my brother's birthday and brought him out a scoop of ice cream with a candle at the end.  If you like ice cream, and who doesn't, don't think twice about getting it.  It was smoother and richer than any I've cream I've had in a while. I really hate to point this out since otherwise it was a great time was the bill after I got home.  The fries that were brought to the table were not something we ordered, but were assured it was on the house.  Usually I check the bill more closely but there were a number of us and I was in a hurry so I just paid it. I later realized they added the fries to the bill.  I was kinda bummed that it got snuck onto the bill after it was brought over unprompted.  I'm hopeful it was an honest mistake as I really wanted to give The Portage a great review. Edit: The manager reached out and confirmed that getting billed for the fries was an honest mistake.  I appreciated the courtesy and professionalism.  I'd definitely go back at some point.",0.9947,0.77,0.175,0.055,0.5190476190476191

Ask for some toast points to soak up the sauce. Then I had the Vietnamese pork meatballs. They were fantastic, had a slight kick. Jesse recommended the perfect wine to match with it.

2015-05-09,4.0,"The Portage: the service was slow and the atmosphere not perfect but incredible meals and great people behind the scenes. The bad: We came here on a Friday night with an 8 pm reservation. The environment suffered from a stuffiness and background noise that I put on management trying to squeeze too many tables and patrons into a smaller space. However, this is probably a situation that is not common as their air conditioner wasn't functioning well. The only other problem was that our service was slow. Not a total put off but enough to be recognizable as such.  The good: There is no denying that The Portage delivers exceptionally flavorful meals. I had the cabbage and tofu dumpling and it was beyond zesty. Moreover, the cuisine sides on the healthy end of dining and the portion sizes were on the opposite end of excessive. Overall, I will try the Portage again! The management team reached out to me directly to address some of my concerns and I find that to be incredibly respectable.

We started with the Wild Boar Potstickers. These were amazing. The potsticker was the perfect crunch and the wild boar was very robust. The sweet potato, blueberry, and eggplant seem like a weird combination with the potstickers but was actually the perfect addition. This was a great appetizer. I got the House Made Tagliatelle and my companion ordered the Miller Farms Amish Chicken. The Tagliatelle was the perfect al dente and high quality homemade pasta. The ragu sauce was also hearty and savory. The chicken came two ways, fried and oven roasted. The fried was obviously better but both were succulent and juicy.

2015-04-18,4.0,"Tonight was our second meal at The Portage after our first unplanned visit months ago. I understood then, that in order to get a table at this small-ish, kinda cramped yet cozy restaurant one MUST make a reservation. On that particular night we got lucky and sat at the bar...which actually turned out to be a good thing (surprise). We enjoyed ourselves thoroughly, drinks to dessert making a mental note to return again. And so, tonight, we did, in celebration of our birthdays... although this time I made a reservation... in advance! We got there 10 minutes early which was not a problem. I was a little surprised to see that the place was already packed...at 6:10pm! We were promptly escorted to our table located in the back room by the back door. A small, noisy room (it holds 3 tables; 1-2 top; 1-4 top and 1-5 top) where the conversation from the 4 top seemed amplified (maybe it's the hard wood floor and ceiling). Not the greatest but once people started eating it got better.  One thing I have to say is the food at The Portage is DE-LI-CIOUS. They serve and prepare top notch ingredients with care and attention to detail. On both of our visits we were very impressed with our meals. You will not be disappointed with the food here and I believe the quality/cost/flavor ratios are all in line. I think you get your money's worth here and do not think it is overpriced. I do have one complaint about our experience tonight and this is about the service. I'm not sure if it was the waitstaff or the kitchen but I do know that we waited for what seemed like a really long time for 1. my cocktail and 2. our dinner (long after our roasted beet salad was eaten). Granted, it's a busy restaurant but this wait seemed unusually long. Too, waiting for our check seemed to be really slow as well. When we got it I noticed that the time stamped on it said 6:12 pm (was this when our drink or dinner order was placed?) and we were still sitting, nearly 2 hours later, at almost 8pm, I was shocked. My husband was alas, not so happy.   This restaurant deserves 5 stars but I'm only giving it 4 because of the service tonight which is too bad because the food is outstanding. I don't know how anxious we'll be to go back. If we do, I think we'll ask to sit at the bar! I wonder... do you need to make a reservation to sit there?

We sat in at the high tops along the wall and it was a bit uncomfortable as we kept getting bumped into.  The waitstaff were all nice and very attentive. Our waiter answered all our questions and seemed to know the menu well and even went back to the kitchen to confirm a question with the chef, which was nice.  We stared with the duck fat fries, which were so yummy, and the wild boar potstickers. The latter, while tasty, was a rather meager serving for the price.  For our entrees, I had the Amish Chicken and hubby had the Berkshire Pork. Both the portions were perfect. I was a little underwhelmed with my meal. The chicken was a bit oversalted and the scallion pancake was kind of bland. My husband really the pork. We capped off the meal with three scoops of the homemade ice-cream: milk chocolate, burnt honey and mascarpone sorbet. Wow. All three were delicious, but the burnt honey was a standout.

The trout was ok however the three little pieces on the plate it was more like a appetizer. We were a group of 4 all were so disappointed. The pumpkin spiced cake was dry nothing to write home about and their only icecream was bacon flavor yuck double yuck. There was only 6-8 people there on the sat night in question I wonder why? Our Bill was near two hundred and fifty so over priced and everyone left hungry. We were so excited to have a special place in our neighborhood but this is a big no no.

Main dishes have good variety also from seafood to steak to vegetarian options. Always great whatever I order. For dessert go with their homemade gelato  Service is beyond good.

A north side gem.   We had reservations, they called to confirm, and were honored spot on , in spite of crowd. The bartender was quick with a great Manhattan as well.  Menu is a constant changing one and a little brief, but we all found great things to order.  Appetizers. Boar pot stickers. Ricotta balls. Pork belly. Fries. All good.  Entrees. Crab salad. Skirt steak. Scallops and very good octopus. Even a burger, which would have been very good if not for being overcooked.  Demerits, a few. They need another waitperson at busy times. Overcooked burger, which I had ordered the burger, changed to pork , but still got the burger.  But all recovered by having the best french fries in the city and a very good bartender.  If you are a north side foodie do try this place!",0.9871,0.76,0.209,0.031,0.4523976608187134
2015-03-15,5.0,"The Portage does fine dining right.  I feel like Portage Park does not have a lot of notoriety. We have been trying to find some nice places in the area so we came out to The Portage and we were not disappointed. The Portage is a perfect spot for those in the northwest side of the city. Located just southwest of Portage park, The Portage can say that it is the best restaurant in the area.  The Portage is a bright little spot kind of in the middle of nowhere right off of Cicero. If you weren't looking for it you may miss it. Don't let this fool you. The Portage is everything you could want in a night out.  Quaint and dimly lit, it seems like the restaurant is located in the space of a gutted home. Long and narrow, there is a dining area in the front, bar on left, tall boy tables down the right, as well as extra seating in the back.  Service was phenomenal and the waitstaff was knowledgeable on menu items including wine options. Dishes were brought out timely and were exceptional. I look forward to my next visit at The Portage.  Reservations are probably a must as it got pretty busy on a Saturday night. As we were finishing there were groups of people either waiting or just having a casual drink on a Saturday night. They were in their 30's to 40's but were still up for a good night out with some friends and cocktails.  Heard a cool song while dining.  youtube.com/watch?v=caY0… This is more for me than for the review :) The staff helped me find it.",0.9801,0.859,0.128,0.012,0.5331964969896006

I then started looking for more neighborhood restaurants around our area and came across The Portage. They had an opening for dinner and with the great reviews, I said, what the hell, let's try this place.  As others have stated, it's a small restaurant, it can probably hold 25 seated and another 8 or so at the bar. It's intimate, it's cozy, it's a perfect neighborhood spot. Upscale, great date night spot.  So... it's really damn good. It's surprisingly good. The appetizers are great, the entrees are great. I had the skirt steak the last two times and it's great. I love steak, everything from a $150+ steak to a hanger or skirt steak and this is a solid skirt steak. Perfectly cooked, great seasoning, great presentation, I'm craving it!  They had an appetizer special, an octopus and pork belly, a nice little surf and turf variation. So damn good! I'm afraid that more and more people will find out about this spot and it'll be tough to get into, but they deserve all the business and more.

For starters we had the duck fat fries, bacon wrapped dates, and curry sweet potato bisque. You may think that fries may be a boring thing to order as a starter but these were SO GOOD! I also highly recommend the sweet potato bisque - hot, silky smooth, and packed with really delicious flavors - perfect for a cold fall or winter night. For mains I had the Sea Scallops and my husband had the Chicken with Buttermilk Waffle. The scallops were great (loved the crispy brussels sprouts and pomegranate) but the chicken was the winning dish of the night.

None of us knew the neighborhood or the restaurant. All three of us were bowled over by the great service and the innovative yet satisfyingly tasty food. The noise level was a little high for about the first hour - small dining room and some large, fun-loving tables - but by the time we had dessert and coffee, the noise level was pretty reasonable. My mother in law had the candy striped beets appetizer (best beets she's ever had, she said) and the chicken-on-a-waffle (which was a large enough portion to offer her plenty of left-overs). I had the summer vegetable salad and the vegetable tagine, both of which were perfectly prepared and beautifully presented. The portion sizes were just right for me. My husband had the heirloom tomato appetizer and the skate entrée. Once again, perfectly prepared and nicely presented. The skate entrée lacked color in its presentation but the flavors went together so well that I'd hesitate to suggest any change in ingredients just for the sake of presentation.  Some other reviewers said the staff was not accommodating to special requests. Not in our case. My mother-in-law asked for the tabasco sauce accompanying the chicken to be offered on the side and they were happy to do so. Others have complained about the price.

Quay the owner greeted us at the door and sat us after a 5 minute wait in their beautiful back courtyard. The specialty drinks list is varied but definitely not intimidating and we settled upon some fresh delicious summer concoctions.  Let me tell you first of all, I typically despise beets! Yet being the GF's Bday and all, she wanted to try their beet salad as a starter and it truly did not disappoint. We also started with their bacon wrapped dates, which is a common appetizer at comparable restaurants. But what really made Portage's truly special was that they were blue cheese stuffed, which gave me a blue cheese food gasm. For our entrees, they simply continued the onslaught of Portage's surprise upon us. I probably do not need to extend any further commendation on my GF's Amish Chicken 'n waffle dish considering all the other Yelp reviews. Let's just say make sure that SOMEONE at your table orders it ;) My skate wing seafood special was special in its own right.

After letting JAKE know that my mother was not too pleased with the Kale, he immediately asked if she wanted to try something else.  JAKE was well-mannered, and made me feel like if I was eating at a higher-level restaurant in downtown. I must say that The Portage is a hidden gem in the neighborhood.  Once inside (especially in the back patio), I could feel that this was a very special place.  I had no idea this existed in the area, and will look forward to coming back again in the future. The price is a little high for the area, but worth the food and service.  Here, the food is served with superior style and elegance.  This is not just another ""nice"" place to eat, it is truly special.  I had the Amish-raised chicken, with waffle, and it was like nothing I have ever ate in my life!  This place IS a high-level restaurant, but for a lower-level price, compared to some of the extremely expensive restaurants in downtown Chicago.  I appreciate them setting up shop in the area.

I wish I had known about bacon wrapped dates years ago, but I only just found out about this dish that must be a Midwestern delicacy.

2014-05-17,5.0,"We love the Portage!  We go 3-4 times a year, and it's always a great meal and a good time. Quay is a consummate host, he always greets us warmly and goes out of his way to make sure we are comfortable. The rest of the staff is equally friendly and welcoming, even the bus staff remember us and say hello.  We've loved The Portage since before the Check Please! episode, and since it seems like that publicity is drawing a sightly wider audience I want to address some of the issues raised in the other reviews. It's true that on the whole The Portage's portions are not on the scale of the giant servings of, say your average corporate restaurant. OTOH, this evening my husband had the pork shank, which was a pound of pork, a generous helping of delicious polenta (and hubby isn't a huge polenta fan usually, but he ate it all up) . We shared two appetizers (the tuna tartare and the bacon wrapped dates, both awesome) , he had the pork and I had the brisket, also delicious, and we each had a dessert (he loves their not-sticky-sweet cobblers--tonight's was cherry, I had the greek yogurt cheesecake which was to die for). We are both feeling very well fed. I would suggest that if you feel like you need large amounts of food you order the larger servings--your server can recommend, or head around the corner to Leadbelly's for giant burgers and fries. There's a place for appropriate-sized portions of carefully prepared food. The Portage does this excellently.  Another thing The Portage's chef does excellently is fatty meats. I realize that a good pork belly or short rib or brisket isn't everybody's  thing, but if you like a nice marbled cut of meat The Portage does them tender, seasoned amazingly and paired with other flavor-enhancing sides, like the pickled shaved asparagus and jus-soaking rice cake I had with my brisket this evening. Yum.  Yes. sometimes the service is a little slow, like it might be if you were dining at a friend's house and they got caught up in conversation and laid out the appetizers a few minutes late. We've never had truly bad service, and the friendliness and attentiveness of the staff more than makes up for a little slow timing once in a while. I'm the sort of person who doesn't mind lingering over my drink a little longer while my appetizer is prepared, or while I finish my wine at the end of the meal before the check comes. I will say that on the occasions we have had to rush off to a movie or something, making that clear to the staff has expedited things for us.  Please come out to our neck of the woods and check out The Portage.

2014-05-13,3.0,"So this place was pretty good the one other time I ate there last Summer.  It was decent this past weekend also but there are certainly things that could have been better.  The Gnocchi appetizer, the ceviche special appetizer, the mixed cocktails, and the bread pudding were all excellent.  The only issue that I would have with these is that, for the price, the appetizers are ridiculously small (certainly not large enough to split between four people).  Also, they changed the liquor in one of my husband's cocktails because they ran out of one type of liquor.  They did not advise him of this substitution and did not fess up until he returned the drink.   As for the main courses, two in our party had the very healthy seared tuna - they were generally happy with this dish.  My husband's steak was tough even though it was cooked medium.  This ticked me off because the waiter insisted that he only order medium as ribeye gets tough past that temp.  Well, it was bloody and tough.  I had the roasted pork belly,  The polenta and veg that came with this dish was fantastic.  As for the meat itself, it was underwhelming and pretty poorly cooked.  I don't want that much chewy fat in one meal ever.  Beyond that, there was one thing that really ticked all four of us off.  We ordered drinks (which we received 20 minutes after ordering them, by the way).  After that the waiter came back and asked if we are ready to order.  I said yes appetizers,  Ordered the two apps we wanted, and he's like: so what would you like for your main courses? We told him that we need couple more minutes for that.  He said that he is not allowed to only put in an order for apps, that their policy is that everything has to be ordered at once or nothing at all.  So, needless to say, we sent him away while we decided.  What b.s. Based on the average of the two times that I have been there so far, I think I would return to enjoy some cocktails on their outside patio once it gets warmer.  I may try their food again to see if this weekend was just a fluke.",0.9929,0.803,0.148,0.049,0.5896520146520147

2014-05-01,2.0,"Hits and Misses! Heard raves about The Portage - so maybe I was expecting more. What was disappointing was the overall inconsistency of well...just about everything. Those Duck Fat Fries everyone raves about? Limp and soggy and tasted rather ordinary. The Bacon Wrapped Dates? If you're into average super-fatty chewy bacon, well this might be the dish for you. The Mac and Cheese? Like the two-star rating says: Meh. I've experienced better. While at the same time, the Brussels Sprouts were absolutely out of this world. Some of the best any of us had ever eaten in any of our dining experiences. And the Gnocci was beautifully done. Light and airy and...well...perfect. My entree was the Fried Chicken and it was excellent. Crisp outside and exceptionally juicy inside. Just what you want in good fried chicken. Don't be put-off by the ""bacon gravy"" which seems like it would overpower the dish. It's actually an excellent compliment to the chicken. For dessert, the hand made Gelato was very well done - the Cantaloupe stood out among the flavors. A white chocolate bread pudding sounded better on the menu than it tasted when it arrived. And the Limoncello Creme Brulee - what a bore - should be retired from the menu. So more than half the food was wonderful - why two stars and not three? Sadly, the service is slipshod. Pleasant and friendly enough yes - very nice people - but rough around the edges. A little service staff training would be in order.  We had asked for our cocktails to arrive before the appetizers, and the appetizers arrived before our cocktails. The server was adamant about taking away our menus after we ordered our appetizers. We wanted to keep them to look at the entrees. In an awkward moment, we relinquished two of the menus. Still, when it was time to order entrees, our dining companions were not returned their menus by the server.  In other, appetizer plates were cleared and while our dirty forks were cleared, our dirty knives were put directly on the wood table top, rather than cleared with our plates and then replaced. Also, drinks are set on coasters, which is fine, but when a coaster is covered with a spill, or gunk from the knife that you didn't change out, it should be replaced. Little stuff like that became bothersome throughout the meal. Would I eat here again? After all, what was great was great. Sure I would, in the hopes that between now and then, management tightens up the consistency of the food and service - because The Portage is a pleasant place, in an area with few restaurant choices of the same caliber.",0.9935,0.806,0.155,0.039,0.608611111111111

The Ambience is great, very calming and relaxing. The wait staff was very friendly and knowledgeable of the food and how it is cooked. This is a great place to catch up with your friends over some good food.  Drink: - The Pink Dragon - Mango vodka, pomegranate liquor, and some mint. There is an after taste to it that I didn't exactly enjoy. However, since I paid for the alcohol, it was a decent enough drink to be able to finish it. I do not think the pomegranate and mint flavours really go that well with each other.  Appetizers:  - Duck fat fries with homemade aioli - a mix of fat and skinny cuts of potato fried in duck fat. It was really good with the spicy aioli. It was a savoury and spicy combo.  - Mussels special cooked with white wine and with folded over brie - THIS MELTED IN YOUR MOUTH! If is it still there and you like seafood, this is a must have. The mussels were fresh and the sauce was so creamy and addictive. It came with some crostinis to soak up the sauce. Love it. - Bacon wrapped dates with a tomato jam and blue cheese - very sweet. I could do without the tomato jam in this combo, but it was good otherwise. - Seared Potato Gnocchi with smoked garlic, peanut, picked jalapeno, baby romaine, and grana padano - I liked how the Gnocchi tasted with the smoke garlic and peanuts. I didn't care for the tastes of the other things listed. Perhaps I'm not a very big fan of gnocchi, so I may be a little biased for this appetizer, but ingredients were fresh! My entree: - Seared Scallops (4) with english peas, roasted beef shank, smoked shallots, kumquat marmalade, black bean, pea shoot, and herb salad. This dish was very flavourful and all the different tastes mixed very well together. It has a sweet and savoury feel to it. The herbs and veggies helped to round out the dish.

2014-02-06,5.0,"We adore this place!  The love affair began when my boyfriend and I were renovating our kitchen and needed a place to grab brunch on the weekends.  Back then, the Portage had just opened and was serving Sunday brunch (they don't have brunch anymore, but I'll still hold out hope).  We loved it.  The service was great, super friendly, and the food: AAHMAZING!  I'd describe it as upscale American comfort food. Flash forward a few years and we are still coming here and having a great experience.  We visit so often that we've become friends with the owner, Quay, and former manager, Neil.  Quay, Neil, and all of The Portage staff have always made us feel welcome with their kind words and laid-back-but-still-professional attitudes.  Even though getting a table at The Portage on a Friday or Saturday night might be a difficult last-minute task, it makes me supremely happy because I can see that others are enjoying this hip joint as much as we are.  Let's keep this place hopping in Portage Park, people!! The food is upscale American comfort food, but there's always something unique about each dish: a flavorful gastrique, foam, puree, whatever.  The quality of the food (many times locally-sourced and always fresh) is the same you would get in a high-end restaurant in downtown Chicago, but also sits aside their famous comfort items like the bacon-wrapped dates and perfectly fried Amish chicken on the menu; I love that!   The drinks are just as fabulous as the food.  They are ALWAYS making some type of cool infusion, flavored liquor, or awesome puree for their cocktails. My love of The Portage goes beyond the people and the food itself, because it's even inspired me to become a more creative cook.  Once we set our taste buds on the buttered popcorn ice cream, it changed my life.  No joke here, it  changed.my.life  (and probably my waistline too).  I was so inspired by this delicious, crazy, fun ice cream that I went out and bought an ice cream maker myself.  Now I like to come into The Portage and swap crazy ice cream stories with the staff.  I just love this place!  You must check it out and I GUARANTEE (said in my best Justin Wilson voice) that you'll love it too!",0.9994,0.666,0.309,0.025,0.6234649122807018

We found a seat at the bar and I had one of the best old-fashioned's that I've ever had - problem solved! It was perfectly crafted. Once we were seated we had a very friendly and attentive waiter, who made great recommendations. We started with the bacon-wrapped dates with drizzled jalapeño honey - amazing! And, another data point to support the claim that bacon does make it better... For our main course, I had the candied beef short ribs (oh yes!) and my boyfriend had the amish chicken. We split the duck fat fries, with which I slathered lovingly with 1 and 1/2 servings of the sriacha aoli. Our taste buds were given a workout! We ate every last bite and contemplated licking our plates...I wish I was kidding but we discussed! We finished it all off with a creme brûlée, which did not disappoint.

2013-11-02,4.0,"The menu is not extensive and neither are the choices/selections, but this restaurant keeps their menu simple which we really appreciate. What they do offer is high quality, fresh ingredients, delectable and unique food that is beautifully plated. We ordered the fat-duck fries and bacon-wrapped dates. The fat-duck fries were fresh from the fryer, dusted with pecorino romano and herbs, and served with a generous portion of the same mustard aioli that's on the short-rib burger. You're going to eat every last one! (We had to toss a quarter, heads or tails, to see who would get the last one). We thought it was ""odd"" to have bacon wrapped dates as an Appetizer at this all-American restaurant. When I think of bacon wrapped dates I think of a typical Tapas restaurant, but nevertheless, we thought these were incredibly ethereal and mouthwatering delectable. The applewood bacon, blue cheese and jalapeño honey made for the perfect amalgamation. The salty and the sweet intermixture was an explosion of an unexpected union of flavors. We all agreed that these two appetizers deserved a five star rating! To give you an idea of what they offer, here are a few of their items from the menu. THEY ARE:   Candied Braised Shortrib with roasted trumpet royale covered with mushrooms, smoked tomato goat cheese grits, infused with ramp cream, pickled kolhrabi and petite herb salad; Bavette Steak served up with crispy potato croquette, creamy leeks, asparagus and beech mushrooms and an amazing smokey veal sauce;    Seared Scallops topped off with braised leeks, spatzle, fennel puree, nueske bacon, peach marmalade and basil oil; Lake Superior Red Trout served with fingerling potatoes and juxtaposed with swiss chard, andouille sausage, manila clams, pipperade broth;  Cider Glazed Confit Pork Belly celery root puree and an infusion of escarole with raisins and caraway, pearl onion marmalade and apple cress salad;  Shortrib Burger with fresh tomato, pickled red onion, bibbed lettuce, spicy aioli, pretzel roll and fresh house cut fries; and  Squash And Mushroom Bourguignon with butternut squash, pearl onions, crimini mushrooms, cheesy polenta, crispy onions. We went here with another couple on a Sunday evening. We ordered the red trout, short rib burger, candied braised short rib, and the Bavette steak.  We surveyed the group and asked each person to rate their food based on five stars and give three words to describe their dish/entree. Here is the breakdown: Red Trout = 5 stars (amazing, perfection and fresh) Short Rib burger = 4.5 stars (tender, succulent, flavorful) Candied Braised Short Rib = 5 stars (ethereal, awesome, tender) Bavette Steak = 5 stars (delectable, juicy and effete) he said he would give it 10 stars if he could! SERVICE: Excellent, friendly, attentive and efficacious (plates were removed when finished and recommendations were made prior to us ordering, which we really appreciated since it was our first time here). Water glasses were filled when needed. PRICE POINT:  Moderate (any where from $14 to $21 per entree). The Bavette Steak was the most expensive entree that we ordered and the Short Rib burger was the least expensive. The two appetizers were $14. For the area that it is located, it can be considered somewhat pricey, but oh so well worth every cent! We would go back for a ""special"" celebration. We did not have dessert since we were happily satisfied. Eating at this place was a gastronomical evening! This restaurant is located in a very unexpected area of the city. There really isn't very much in this area in terms of restaurants (there is a Colombian Steak House restaurant not very far away), so we were really surprised to see it on the show ""Check Please!"" This restaurant is in an area that has undergone a lot of changes (for the better) and located in a relatively safe area of the city.

The Portage is a neighborhood new-American kinda place that is better than it needs to be. I suspect every Chicago neighborhood has one of these... West Town used to have West Town Tavern and I'd say these two are pretty similar. As mentioned they serve mostly American fare, but with one or two ingredients/techniques that push the envelope a bit. Everything we had ranged from good to very good (we had gnocchi app, scallops, burger, and blueberry muffin cake). My main complaint is it's a bit pricey to be an everyday kinda place, but as a sometimes food I could see myself coming back here (this is high praise because the list of places to try in Chicago can be quite large). Also for some reason one or two lights in the dining room flicker occasionally. Really quite strange, I wish they would fix that as it was distracting to the conversation.  The dining room was small but we went when most people were eating outside on their back patio. Were it late fall or winter, I think it'd be more crowded and very hard to get a table in the place.

The interior has a dark and bar-clubby look to it, and there was a peculiar ambiance thanks to the dim lights blinking as if a power outage was about to take place.  The service was excellent from the staff, including a helpful hint about the beer menu selections going from dark to light in descending order.  They stock interesting domestic microbrew choices dueling with a few notable international choices, although I found it amusingly ironic that the German and Belgian selections were out on that day (and the coasters provided to us pushed the German brand that was out).   We split an order of thickly cut fries, and I had to talk my bud into it because he thought they would be coated with duck fat rather than just fried in it.  The fries came with two aioli dips, and we both liked the slightly spicy one better (well it was barely spicy, but tasted good).  The plate of Amish fried chicken was yummy, though I almost wish it came with a bit more of the bacon gravy atop the mashed potatoes.  I just found out now as I am writing this review that the ""haricot verts"" with the fried chicken are indeed the same as green beans but in French so ooh la la.  My friend ordered the Lake Superior red trout with a compelling mix of andouille sausage, fingerling potatoes, and clams.  For dessert I ordered the cherry streudel, and although it was tasty enough with a scoop of vanilla gelato I was a bit puzzled that it was more like a fruit cobbler rather than a flaky pastry.  Oh well.  My friend enjoyed his gelato plate, and he was allowed to select three flavors including popcorn flavor.",0.9963,0.803,0.175,0.022,0.441869918699187

Go on Thursdays when they have the mussels. They're brought out on a sizzling skillet and are served with an amazing dipping sauce; kind of spicy, totally amazing. The mussel shells are coated with seasoning that our bartender/server recommended we rub onto the mussels. Amazing. We had the short rib burger the first night, cooked perfectly medium-rare. We also had the pork belly. It was tender and crispy and came with a fantastic celery root purée. The crab cakes were mostly crabmeat, not much filler. We consider ourselves crab cake ""snobs""; we try them everywhere we go. These were definitely in the top 3. We returned last night for the mussels, and also had the scallops (I typically do not like scallops...too mushy, or too sweet, or too fishy...) which were delicious! Very appropriate dish for spring. The bacon-wrapped dates were great, but the best thing I've had so far is the short rib entree. It has a crispy, salty, sweet candied glaze, and fell apart on the fork. Super tender. The goat cheese-tomato grits were a great accompaniment. The flourless chocolate cake with buttered popcorn homemade ice cream paired well with a port that our bartender (Amy) chose. Not an overly-sweet dessert, which is a great alternative to most desserts that get drenched in some sugary syrup that ruins it. My compliments to the chef. He knows how to properly treat everything we've tried. Everything tasted fresh and the seasonings are spot-on. I hope he gets the recognition he deserves. The flavors he incorporates into his dishes are obviously chosen with care and executed beautifully.  Amy infuses fresh ingredients into the spirits she uses to make handcrafted cocktails.

2013-04-01,2.0,"My husband and I went to The Portage for our Easter dinner. A friend had been recommending this restaurant for a year now but we had never been able to go, since my husband is only off on Mondays and they are closed Mondays.  I have to agree with everyone that the service is really nice. The servers are pleasant, polite, and can describe the dishes, but they aren't overbearing. The menu changes seasonally, which I love and the dishes sound amazing... However, we were completely underwhelmed with the food and put off by the atmosphere. The restaurant is very small and the waiters and people had a hard time getting between the tables and we felt like we need to keep sucking in and scooting our chairs forward in order to let people by. The decorating is odd and the huge windows in front let in lots of nice light, but then lend a terrible view. The music playing was rather loud and an odd mix (from John legend, to something techno-sounding, to Florence and the Machine??). The atmosphere just wasn't cozy, inviting, or date-like. The food is where we were the most let-down because we had heard such great things and there are excellent reviews on yelp. The duck fat fries were great and they came with 2 dipping sauces that didn't have much flavor.  I ordered the Amish fried chicken that everyone raves about and I found it good, but nothing that I would crave or go back for. My husband wanted it to have more flavor. My husband ordered the burger, which yelpers had also recommended, and we both thought it was pretty bad. The meat was cooked well-done and was dry instead of the medium he had asked for. The meat had no juicy flavor at all and the pretzel bun was dry and tasted old. The burger is pretty plain/straightforward (lettuce, tomato, etc) besides the smoked gouda. Overall, it didn't have much flavor and we had a hard time finishing it. Our food experience with the somewhat high prices ($14 for that burger) made us decline dessert. My husband has no desire to return, but I'm wondering if we just went on a bad day or should have tried some of the other dishes? :(",0.9897,0.769,0.152,0.078,0.6153174603174604

The space is quaint, and there is even an outdoor patio, which we cannot wait to try when the weather turns warmer. We started with the bacon wrapped dates, which were amazing. Salty, savory, with a little sweet all in one bite. There was a snails appetizer special that was also incredible (if they do tarragon button on anything else, get it!). Both fish entrees (scallops and trout) were perfectly cooked with well balanced sides. Service was attentive, but certainly not overbearing or too stuffy. Nice wine and beer selection, too.

2012-10-11,3.0,"As much as I REALLY wanted to like this place, I can't. They made way too many goofs for me to give it anything more than a three-star review and I think even that is generous. First impression, we had 8PM reservations on a Saturday night and were not seated until 8:45 with very minimal apology. I don't need anyone layin' it on thick, but butter me up a bit and tell me that you are genuinely sorry for a near hour wait even though we had reservations. It also would have been nice if they kept us informed. There is no real waiting space inside, so my wife and I had to stand outside by the big front windows staring at diners inside as if they were a part of some stage production. Overall, the atmosphere was cramped and loud. Would be okay if this were just a bar, but if I'm forking out $80 for dinner I want to be able to hold a conversation too. Just my preference. Also, I understand that these things happen and they don't have total control on when people decide to leave. We ordered the bacon-wrapped dates, which seems to be a staple at EVERY new-american themed restaurant. They were certainly good. For an entree my wife ordered the braised beef, which was very good. The beef was tender and not at all fatty. The grits were very good. Listed with carrots, but more like a carrot. I could have ordered this dish and been very happy. However, I ordered the fried chicken because some broad at the table next to us had it and it looked fantastic. It came with Brussels sprouts (another new-american staple lately) and mashed potatoes both of which I also really love. My first piece of chicken was very good and flavorful. Crispy but still moist.  When I got to my second piece of chicken things took a turn for the worst. It was completely raw on the inside. I told the waitress, who told the manager. He came over and was very apologetic. He comped the chicken and offered us dessert. I have no complaints on how the handled the situation.  Here is the thing, like I said before there are a TON of new-american style restaurants. Many of which I've been to and reviewed that 1) have a better atmosphere, 2) more efficiently run and 3) never served me raw chicken. Though I'm sure it was just an off night at The Portage, there is no reason for me to ever go back. It I want bacon wrapped dates and fried chicken I can go to Sable Kitchen downtown or Fork in Lincoln Square and get nearly the exact same thing.",0.9945,0.814,0.145,0.041,0.5507373975231117

We sat on the patio, which had a nice city oasis feel complete with a water feature to drown out street noise.  They had a nice beer selection- I'm not a wine drinker but it looked like they had a decent amount of options for the spiked grape juice fans.

The entrance is at first a bit confusing; we were faced with three closed doors to choose from after the initial front door. We chose the quick left and were greeted by a positive-chill atmosphere.

Our waitress was helpful and articulate; it seemed to me  she enjoyed her job...it seemed like everyone enjoyed their job. The service was all around lovely and unassuming.

The chicken was moist and complemented perfectly by the veggies. My burger was layered with fresh spinach leaves and the juiciest slice of tomato held together by a surprisingly soft pretzel roll.

2012-06-07,4.0,"This is the second time we've ate at The Portage. The first occasion was excellent-I would give a 4.5 stars if possible. The second time 3.5 stars due to some kinks.  Upon initial entry, the restaurant appears almost cramped. After sitting down, it starts feeling comfortable-possibly due to the attentive service and the cushioned seats. The bartender is your best dude friend who knows to say, joke, and recommend. The cocktails are interesting and so far the three we've tried (The Pink Dragon, Firecracker, and I believe Summer Watermelon) are pretty solid drinks. No overwhelming alcohol taste just the way I like cocktails to be.  The duck fat fries are better than Hot Dougs, especially as it comes with the aioli sauce. They're crunchy enough, and aren't over saturated with grease in the mouth-even though we all know they are. The Portage burger isn't made of real kobe beef (since none are imported to the USA), but are juicy and very tasty. Pretty good burger. We had the special pasta-gnocchi with braised ribs. That was the highlight of our dinner. It was scrumptious! Perfect texture, accompanying sauce, and taste. I only wished the portion was a tad bigger-but we were all able to sample between the four of us. We tried the homemade ice cream; one of which flavor was bacon...mmm..bacon. It wasn't a slaughter fest of bacon on the taste buds, but a minor aftertaste. Light enough that the vast majority of bacon lovers, and regulars will still find it decent. I can't recall the other two flavors, but only that they tasted better than bacon. Service was friendly and attentive. The four of us walked out very content. Our second visit was less pleasant than the first. We choose the regular gnocchi starter, which we found to be a bit dry. Perhaps the special gnocchi should replace the regular, as it was a much better dish. We requested the tv to be turned on so that he could watch the game if possible. Our waitress explained that it was usually kept off until a customer requested, but she would see if it could be turned on. I saw that she conversed with the bartender, but minutes passed by and the tv was still off. Our waitress did not update us on that request, so ten minutes later we flagged someone else (who we discovered to be the owner later on), and the request was fulfilled. We finished our drinks, starter, and patiently waited for our steak to arrive. Dishes started coming out of the kitchen (other patrons had ordered around the same time frame as we had), and we enjoyed seeing how most ordered the burger. The clock started to tick by, and we started wondering where our food was...Everyone had received their entrees but us. Our waitress stopped by to let us know the steak would be coming out shortly. After about 25-30 minutes after the starter was removed, the steak finally arrived. He cut into the middle at first, saw that it was blood red, so cut again to see if there was any section we could eat that was more cooked. We had ordered medium rare, and it was nowhere near medium rare. It was bloody rare. Our waitress took it away. A few minutes later our same piece of steak came back medium rare. We were slightly disappointed that we didn't receive a new piece of steak since we did wait exceptionally long for it to arrive. I believe our order was forgotten, hence the longer than average wait, and was rushed to bring out to us. Between the two of us, we finished the steak in less than five minutes. By the time we finished our steak, the other patrons had either left or finished and were just chatting. Yes, our waitress was nice, however the unnecessary wait for our entree to arrive was very disappointing since it was a regular night and not too busy, add on that our order was not fulfilled properly. I felt that the waitress could have updated us on our entree in a timely manner, but then again she probably forgot entirely about our order. We perused the desert menu, but I didn't want anything since I felt so let down.  Before we left, the owner asked if we were in a rush since we would be getting desert on the house. We stayed for the desert and found the peanut butter dish to be pleasant. We ended up engaged in a conversation with the owner about the restaurant and what not. Very pleasant man who told us he heard some Vietnamese, and probably overheard our Vietnamese conversation regarding our disappointment, so he did damage control. It was nice that he comped the desert, but that of course, doesn't make up the lack of timing. We will still come back for the great food, but will cross our fingers that the second time was just a fluke. Perhaps the waitress had an off day, the kitchen had an off day, or any other reason...but the food was still great-when it came as ordered.",0.997,0.845,0.115,0.04,0.47518053215022904

Duck fat fries with a roasted leek n garlic dipping sauce as well as a scallion truffle sauce. Bacon wrapped dates served over arugula were also had.

The pork duo consists of  house made pork belly & seared terrine over cheddar grits with caramel apple and pork jus.  I knew the fried chicken was boneless and was skeptical but when it arrived, I really could not tell that it was boneless. I thought a mistake was made or maybe they changed it. It didn't matter. The chicken was the bomb - crispy, juicy with a nice kick of cayenne in the batter. Heavenly. The pork duo was also quite tasty. Anyone who knows me, knows I LOVE PORK BELLY! It was cooked perfectly and the cheddar grits were oh so yum. I'd eat both dishes again in a heartbeat.  We could not leave without dessert. We got the orange blossom ice cream served along side an orange scented cake. Light and scrumptious. They also make their ice cream in house so we got the sampler - chocolate, macadamia and bacon. All were delicious.  From start to finish, our evening was wonderful. Yes, the food was exceptional but what made our experience truly wonderful was the service. Everyone was so incredibly friendly and laid back. We joked with the GM, our waitress was a delight and we had a lovely conversation with the sous chef. Couple this with the charming space (inside and out) and you've got yourself a win/win. The Portage is a little off the beaten path, but totally worth looking for.",0.9982,0.771,0.203,0.027,0.6785714285714286

We waited about 15 mms for a spot on the back patio which was way worth the wait.  The weather was perfect and there was good lighting and nice soft music.  The owner was friendly and gave us ice cream on the house... Mmmm bacon ice cream is actually really good bc it has the perfect amount of salty/sweet combination working for it.  The orange blossom ice cream was perfect for the palette after the great meal.

Service was great and we didn't find ourselves lacking anything at any time. The food was excellent. We had the mac and cheese and bacon-wrapped dates. The M&C was delish, and the bacon-wrapped dates, while nearly impossible to screw up, were in-line with Cafe Ba Ba Reeba's, which means super-tasty. For entrees we had the scallops and bacon-wrapped kobe meatloaf (yes, I love bacon). I typically wouldn't order meatloaf anywhere (with the exception of my mother's) but both entrees were very good. At first, the portion sizes seemed small. But by the time we were halfway through our meal I realized I didn't need any more.

2012-01-21,4.0,"The Portage had been on my back burner radar for about a year after seeing consistently good reviews around here and some good local press. When a friend who lives near the place gave her own glowing review, we couldn't hit the road faster. As others say, this place is tucked away in a cozy little building that looks like it might have been an orthodontist's office in the 70s. We parked on the next east-west residential street past the building where there was ample parking, but noticed on the walk back that there is, in fact, reserved parking (after 6pm?) in a lot behind the restaurant off the side street. Good to know, indeed. Again, this is a very intimate space that felt more like a large dining room at someone's home than a restaurant and lounge. And once I settled in at the 8-10 seat bar, I realized that this was a good thing. Even with only a couple dozen people in the place, the room was abuzz with the cacophony of conversations and waiters gliding back and forth between the kitchen, bar and dining area. My wife and I chose to sit at the bar since we were only planning on appetizers and cocktails and this worked out perfectly. No sooner did we sit down that we were greeted by a very jovial bartender who obviously loves his job. The wife ordered a signature martini and I chose a selection off a beer list  that was a tad light, but had big potential. Meanwhile, we were being chatted up by a regular who runs a hair styling business around the corner. She had brought in some homemade cooking for the staff and seemed to know everyone in the place. Not surprising in a place like this where we were already feeling a bit like regulars. For food, we had to try the duckfat fries, of course. We added the bacon-wrapped dates with blue cheese because, well, they sounded awesome. Both were solid, but admittedly not the very best that we've had. I don't recall specifically which two sauces were served with the fries, but I found myself wanting for the simple garlic aioli that I've loved at Hopleaf for years and years. Still, quite a fun experience all in all. I spoke briefly with the manager at the bar and he obviously knew a thing or two about beer. I gave a couple recommendations that I thought might flesh out their list nicely. We'll definitely return for a proper meal sometime soon as the tidy dinner menu was full of interesting selections.

I almost ALWAYS order their Kobe beef burger, medium rare, and get the appetizer of duck-fat-fries with home-made sauces on the side.  Grab a brewski from their huge list (its all bottles). I have never left without thinking that this is a 5-star meal. Save room for dessert because they make some CRAZY ice-cream flavors!

The front room dining space is very small and cramped, which contributed to our server having a lot of difficulty in getting to our table.  Regardless, waiting 38 minutes (we counted) from sitting down to finally completing a drink order was way too long.  This was complicated by the fact that they were out of the first bottle we ordered (Duckhorn), but by the time our waitress came back with the second bottle in a different vintage than the one we ordered, we couldn't wait and ended up taking that despite the fact that the listed vintage was wrong.   As for the food, it was good overall, but uneven course-to-course.  They were out of the fish special when we finally put in our order (see above), so I went with the pork chop (another special).  Unfortunately, the chop was dry and overdone, and the broccoflower companion was anything but ""charred,"" as had been described.  (Closer to steamed with a couple of brownish edges).  On the other hand, my fiancee's fried chicken was perfect, and our other companions liked their food.  The apps were ok, with nothing particularly outstanding.  The duck fat fries were average, a tad underdone (slightly soggy), and the mac-n-cheese was without much vitality or anything to set it apart from competitors.  The beet salad we had was not good, although our dinner companions liked their duck confit salad.  At least the dessert (the Bananarama special) was good, and the owner was kind enough to comp it after our experience.

Firstly, I must say that the service was OUTSTANDING.  We wanted to sit on the back patio and were told that there were no umbrellas available so we'd have to sit in the sun.  We were ok with that... but as soon as an umbrella opened up, they immediately asked if we would like it and brought it over.  They were also extremely polite and attentive.  I also liked that after they described the special that they said how much it was because for some reason so many places don't do that. The food was awesome.  I got the Boozy French Toast and it was amazing... They had thick slices of bread that were soaked through with the batter, carrying the flavor throughout.  It had just a hint of the Makers Flavor, which was perfect.  The fruit salad it came with was fresh.  It was a very nice combo.  My boyfriend got the Pulled Pork Chilaquiles, requested it to be spicy, and it actually WAS spicy... So many places don't add enough heat.  He was also expecting that it would be mostly beans with a little pulled pork, but it was a perfect balance of the two with more meat than beans.

It was pretty baffling, and it took a while before someone could correct it. The plate portions have also appeared to have shrunken.

2011-07-02,2.0,"The chef is a genius, but the front of the house needs to step up their game in a big way.  Admittedly, three of us had a 7:45 reservation on a perfect summer Friday when the restaurant had just appeared in a magazine. Still, It was almost 9 before we were actually seated. It reminds me of restaurants in Greenwich Village or Chelsea: it is a very cute but tiny place, and every inch is dedicated to seating, and there is really nowhere to stand without being in the way, so the hour wait felt like two. We stood near the bar and had Green Limousines, green tea-infused vodka and ginger liqueur, which were awesome.  We sat on the patio, which was gorgeous. I would recommend avoiding ""the library"" which is basically a hallway between the dining room and the patio. I tried to order a tequila-based version of the Green Limousine, but they were out of designer tequila at its core. I asked for another Green Limousine, and the waiter replied, ""At least you're flexible."" For real?!? It was like I was at Ed Debevic's for a second.  We ordered three appetizers: the heirloom salad, the tempura green beans and the duck fat fries. The appetizers came out one at a time, and the third was was not what we had ordered. The waiter suggested that we share , even though we had already been clear that wasn't our plan. As my friends were finishing their appetizers, the fries appeared.  The entrees were beyond reproach: two fried chickens, which were boneless chicken breasts in a light, crispy tempura-like batter, a definitely refreshing spin on my mother's fried chicken, and the pork chop, which may have been the best pork chop I had ever eaten.  The appetizer mix-up repeated itself with the dessert service. We ordered three: the goat-cheese crème brûlée, the sweet polenta strawberry-rhubarb shortcake and the peach cobbler. The first two arrived, and the third was missing. About ten minutes later, our waiter came by to ask how dessert was and only then noticed that we were still waiting for the peach cobbler, probably the least complicated of the desserts and frankly the least remarkable. If I had it to do over, I would probably have ordered the sweet polenta.  The owner, who we met on entering, stopped by after dessert to introduce himself and was very friendly. I am sure I looked annoyed by this point, and he must have been curious, but I didn't feel like going into it. The bartender was equally friendly and talented. The place is probably terrific when they aren't overwhelmed like they seemed last night.  The ambiance on the patio was disappointing. As we dined, and we were seated almost two hours, the quiet 40- and 50-somethings were replaced by shrill, over-served 20-somethings, one of whom had a laugh so distinctive that half of the heads on the patio turned the first few times we heard it bellowing from the far side of the patio to make sure she wasn't choking.  I recognize that there is nothing the restaurant can do about that, and it is Portage Park, after all, not Chelsea. Our waiter's booming voice making small talk about his wife at the table next to ours drowned out what my friends were saying at our table more than once. Ed Debevic's again.  I struggled with how many stars to give The Portage; the food is definitely five stars, but the service last night was more one-and-a-half. I would go back, but on a Tuesday at 6, not on a Friday or Saturday at 8.",0.9982,0.791,0.166,0.043,0.4747795414462081

We had the prix fixe anyway which started with a scallop appetizer which was good, but nothing outstanding.  One big scallop with a few vegetables in some sort of balsamic sauce.  I would be more clear about what this was, but no server actually explained it to us.  The plates were plopped in front of us and the server walked away without a word.  Hmmmm.  Not too sure about that.  We also waited about 25 minutes in between appetizer and entree and only about 3 minutes between clearing the entree and bringing the dessert.  Timing was a bit off the whole night.  Also, a breadbasket would have been nice.   The next course was quail served with some corn relish.  This was just ok for me as well.  The quail was cooked nicely and was a good portion size, but overall the dish was forgettable.  Dessert was a goat cheese creme brulee which was very good.  I would order that again if we ever came back.   Overall, for how far away from downtown this place is and with the hiccups in service and just-ok food, we probably won't be back.  This is a nice neighborhood restaurant with decent food, but there are a zillion other places serving better food that are much closer.",0.9947,0.782,0.174,0.044,0.49777151211361736

Maybe the one positive is the stuff that was bad could be remedied fairly easily and make this place a real gem.  First the good: The Burgers were excellent. Very very good. i highly recommend them.  The wait staff seemed nice very personable Now the bad: When we ordered our burgers we were told ""we just had to run out and get some more meat so your order is going to take a while."" OK. Not a huge deal. BUT, I slowly start hearing around the restaurant, ""Your order is going to take a while"" for non-burger orders. This was around 8:00 on a Saturday night! This is your prime time be prepared! Now the ugly:  The cocktails were TERRIBLE. My wife ordered a mojito. The bartender reached into the fridge and grabbed the ""house mojito mix."" There were no mint leaves added or to be seen in the mix. There were no limes. Just the (relatively clear) mix, rum and soda. I tasted it myself and there was no mint or lime taste to it at all. It was basically sugar water. The bartender was a good guy and you could tell by the look in his face that this wasn't his idea of a good cocktail either. Possibly they have orders to go on the cheap? We ordered a peach cobbler (which took quite a while to prepare) for dessert. She walked up to us and said ""they just took it out of the oven"" and a few minutes later a server came out and set it on the table.  I'm sorry but they did not just take it out of the oven. It was quite cold. even chilled. This is fine when you are pulling something out of your fridge at home but this is a fancy restaurant.  All in all our time was average there despite an exceptionally good burger.

2011-05-23,3.0,"Yet another overly-hyped, overpriced restaurant everyone wants to give 5 stars. The food was mediocre, period. Service was slow, and though there were some high points, we won't be back.  The Portage has been calling my name for about a year now. Every time I pass it up it is jam-packed (which isn't necessarily a good thing, but it usually is). I had read a lot of positive reviews and decided to take the wife there on a packed Saturday night. It's also in the neighborhood and I'm all about supporting local small businesses when I can.  When we arrived, we were greeted warmly and were seated at a nice table by the window. We ordered the tempura-fried green beans as an appetizer. They finally arrived- over thirty minutes into the service. Thirty minutes to fry about thirty green beans seems excessive to me, but, I figured they must be really good. Not really. Interesting, but not really good. Bland and really greasy. Dipping them into the sweet & sour sauce led to a somewhat awkward flavor combination. I think they're trying to be hip with this, but, eh.  I ordered the fried chicken with red pepper sauce and my wife ordered the Kobe burger. Another thirty minutes into the service (restaurant was considerably less busy by this point, so....what gives?) and our food was brought to us. The chicken was pretty flavorless. It was juicy and not dried out, and I appreciate that, but it lacked flavor. The portion was very small, too. The highlight of my dish was the small bed of orzo that the chicken sat upon. Dead serious. My wife's burger was huge, and it was pretty good, albeit very greasy. Fries were good.  For dessert, I ordered the homemade ice cream, which includes three (very small) scoops. The flavor selection is eclectic to say the least and I was a bit unsure about chocolate chip and basil ice cream. But, I ordered it anyway, along with butter popcorn and strawberry and goat cheese. The chocolate chip/basil was terrible. Whoever thought it was a good idea to mix the two was just not right. Of course, I ordered it so I'm partially to blame. The butter popcorn and strawberry and goat cheese, however, were awesome. I assumed the butter popcorn ice cream would be nauseating but it was great. The strawberry and goat cheese was essentially strawberry cheesecake ice cream. My wife ordered the apple pie and didn't like it.  So, overall, I am glad to have gone, because I have wanted to go there for awhile now. But, I will not return. Our bill was fifty dollars. I can name scores of restaurants where much better food could be had for less than that-plus many more I haven't been to yet. The proprietors here have done a great job creating a ""cool"", modern, ""upscale"" restaurant in Portage Park, and I'm glad to see them succeeding. And I wish them the best.

Luckily, the restaurant wasn't very crowded on this Sunday evening, so none of the other diners had to sit very close to my germs. Thank goodness, otherwise I would have felt very guilty, because this place is very cozy, shall we say. Anyway, let's talk food. Although I could barely breathe/smell/taste my food, what I could taste was delicious. The octopus was nicely charred, but there was sauce all over the plate, which sadly my date has an aversion to, so therefore did not enjoy as much as I did *too bad*. I'm a huge fan of fried chicken, and their version is pretty tasty. It's boneless, kinda like two large well-seasoned chicken tenders, served with red pepper gravy.

2011-05-11,3.0,"If this comes off as an awkward review, it is because there were a lot things I really liked about The Portage, but it was far from perfect. The food was hit or miss. The Kobe burgers were delicious. Well seasoned and cooked to order. The mac and cheese was underwhelming- it's like the noodles weren't cooked enough. My dining companion enjoyed the BBQ Shrimp, but having just been in NOLA, perhaps my expectations were too high. A mild let down. To complicate matters, all of the food took a while. The restaurant was only mildly crowded on a Tuesday night and it took two hours to from when we sat down to when we got up.  I did really appreciate the owner coming up to us at the end of the meal and apologizing (albeit after we brought it up) for the slow service. He seemed like a pretty genuine guy, enough so that I'd be willing to make a return trip, even if the food didn't blow me away. We also briefly talked about why he doesn't like Yelpers (the reviews only come from the extremists) so it is with that in mind that I award The Portage 3 stars, right in the meaty part of the curve.",0.9917,0.796,0.186,0.019,0.6342097998619739

Our table had skirt steak (darn good), scallops (slightly undercooked but excellent quality), and fried chicken w/ mustard greens that I will crave! The Bad - not much. My only complaint would be the noise level when the restaurant is full can be challenging to conversation and they could probably do with one less table in the main dining room.

The crew raved about the octopus (I respectfully declined) and the Mac n cheese was amazing. Not too cheesy like the Kraft/velvetta version but fancy and tasty. Dinner: They had run out of everything on the menu except for one skirt steak, lots of the fried chicken and the tofu dish.  Ironically we all wanted the Red Fish, but we were flexible. One grabbed the skirt steak, the rest had the chicken and I took one for the team and ordered the tofu.  Everyone was pleased with their meal and they even made tofu taste half-way decent.  The chicken was very tasty - not like KFC but imagine a really fancy version of that basic concept. Dessert: Homemade ice cream - butter popcorn flavored...to.die.for. Home made apple pie was just okay (but I am also an apple pie snob) and the peach cobbler was also just okay.  Best was the ice cream. Great bar and wine options! Thought the prices were fare for what we got - my tofu dish was $12.  The atmosphere was really refined.  Thumbs up for The Portage. I would go back to try other menu options and pray they didn't run out of everything. The server said to come during the week cause the weekends get crazy.",0.9856,0.84,0.147,0.012,0.5650793650793651

I started off on the wrong foot. The bar has limited options for beer. But the bartender, Gerald, asked me what beer I preferred, I told him Stella Artois. He recommended a light Pilsner. Scrimshaw. I have found my new favorite beer. The experience just got better from there. We had the Duck Fat fries and the bacon wrapped dates to start. For entrees,  I had the Skirt Steak w/mashed potatoes and baby carrots. Perfect medium rare. It melted in my mouth.  My wife, had the Kobe Burger. Delicious. The desserts looked great, but frankly we just couldn't eat another bite. We will definitely have dessert next time.  The only reason, I did not give it 5 stars was because, it's a very small space. Normally this would make it cozy but it was very packed and you really couldn't have a conversation without raising your voice.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed. We started at the bar since we were early since I typically stick to beer and vodka sodas I thought I would try something off their drink list. I had the Fumo by recommendation of the bartender. It was disappointing there was a lot of pulp in the drink which I don't really mind in my favorite breakfast drink. I also found it to be much to sweet for my liking. My friend loved her drink the Red Sangriatini so much so she had 3 I tried it and yes it was delicious. I opted for an IPA for my next drink and I was much happier.  For appetizers we went with the baby octopus and mac and cheese. The baby octopus came with 4 tentacles, plums and a vanilla sauce. The vanilla sauce was so dessert like that I found myself wiping it off the octopus and the plums. The octopus was also a little chewy and cold. The mac and cheese was okay nothing to really write home about I have had far better else where.  Our entrees were very good we both had fish. I went with the Escarole and my friend the monk fish we both finished our plates they were very good.  Service was also good. Hostess was very friendly and our waitress was great.

We arrived at like 9:45pm and were welcomed with enthusiasm. We shared an appetizer special of juicy plump Mussels steamed in  spicy paprika and wine sauce and an heirloom salad with raspberry vinaigrette.

Next thing you know you're locked in the bathroom eating them off the back of the toilet and looking over your shoulder to make sure none of your friends ask for some. I've had the duck fat fries, and I'm not doing that again. It was just ugly. You know you have a problem when you tell your kid that he can't have any more of daddy's fries.  The Portage has a menu I plan on grazing through over the next few months. There's nothing pretentious here, but some trendy ingredients make an appearance. Pork belly, of course. Confit of this or that, yes. But to say it plainly, this is midwestern food for people who eat with silverware and put napkins on their laps. Pork chops, steaks, chicken, fish. But really, really well done.  My hanger steak was tender, juicy and bovine vampire rare, which is how I like it. The reduction was delicious and not overpowering. But the turnip/cauliflower gratin thingy was freakin awesome. The winter menu is probably gone or going, but if you can get there before it goes, eat this frikkin thing. Its just insanely good.  My wife had the sandwich special, which she said was excellent. I wouldn't know, I was licking my plate.  We ordered the mac and cheese appetizer for my son, and it was probably the best I've ever had. Just amazing, a little smokey and not overcooked, which is typically the issue. Between my wife and I, I think our son maybe got two bites.  We were on the early side and had a reservation, so we didn't wait at all. Service was outstanding. Really, our waiter was great, made good recommendations and the owner stopped by our table a couple of times, which always makes me feel like a muckety muck.

Prices are very good, especially for this food. I'd pay more and still go back. The dining room is small, but not elbow-your-neighbor-every-minute small.

My wife and I went the first week they opened last summer, and thought very little of it.  My wife ordered the gazpacho to start, and that just tasted like cold ketchup.  As an entree, I got the pork chop and I was not impressed.  All of the portions on my plate were very small and under-seasoned, and so was my wife's.  When one of the owners/managers came over to talk about our experience, we told him that the portions did not fit the price. We chalked it up as they're still learning and decided to go back for brunch a few weeks later -- that was a mistake.  I ordered the steak and eggs (the menu said 7oz steak).  Again, I was disappointed.  The steak was barely 4oz, they gave me maybe 6 little potato fingerlings, and the eggs were a little cold.  Obviously they don't take their patrons' advice about adequate portions to fit their prices.  And on top of all that, the owners seem to lurk over their customers and are much too nosey for feedback -- which I think is ironic since they don't heed any advice. This place is obviously masquerading as a wannabe ""high-end"" restaurant and trying to take advantage of the fact that there really are no fine dining places in the neighborhood; so they jack up their prices for sub-par food.  Please don't be fooled.  Go elsewhere.",0.2354,0.815,0.094,0.091,0.4428138528138528

Let's cut to the chase: There is one reason - and one reason alone - why The Portage is not getting 5 stars from me.  The goat cheese stuffed bacon wrapped dates were COLD.  Cold as in they were made earlier in the day and had been nuked before bringing them to our table.   Cold bacon wrapped dates = sacrilege.  Every BWD connoisseur knows that these delectable treats are best straight out of the broiler.   This did get the meal off to kind of a bad start in my eyes, but my fried chicken entree more than made up for it.  The fried chicken was boneless, which was awesome, and the meal came with mashed potatoes, gravy, and seared brussels sprouts.  I love brussels sprouts, and these might have been some of the best I've had.  Definitely tasty. The boyfriend had the porkchop dinner, and he said it is one of the best pork chops he has ever had.   After dinner I had a Mexican Coffee, which was very tasty.  I don't like my adult beverages to taste like adult beverages and this hit the spot.  It was sweet and cinnamon-y and fab. For dessert we tried an ice cream trio and enjoyed the following flavors: cherry pie & coffee, pop corn, and lemon ginger.  They were all delicious, although somewhat surprisingly the popcorn flavor was our favorite.  It was so tasty - just enough salt to be a fab sweet/salty treat. Our waitress was one of the best waitresses I've ever had.  She was knowledgeable and cheerful.  She stopped by a couple of times to ask how our food was, and told us about how the restaurant changes ice cream flavors every night.  For the first time ever I told the boyfriend to give her a big tip, because I really thought she added to the experience. Also, the two owners were wandering around the restaurant the entire time we were there and interacting with everyone.  I never saw them without smiles on their faces.

The wine was a delicious bonus. Being my first visit I was judging the place on the service and food.  Service: Everyone was very friendly and attentive without being obtrusive or weird.  There was a touch of upscale in the service like changing the silverware with each course. In my opinion it's those small details that lift a restaurant above all others. Food: Absolutely, amazingly delicious!  The first course; cucumber and melon consomme with quick-cured cobia: It was light and fresh. There were layers. Oh yum.  The second course; candy-striped beet salad, with brie and goat cheese croquettes, blood orange segments, and beet greens:  Apparently I like beets. I had no idea until I tasted this dish. The cheese croquettes you can't go wrong. Who doesn't like fried cheese, but the outer layer was flaky and perfectly prepared.  The third course; roasted quail, charred snap peas, salsify, hoisin demi: The best salsify I've ever had. It's like a little bit of creamy heaven just sitting there asking you to lick your plate. Of course we didn't do that... but it was hard to resist. The quail was tender and juicy, the peas crisp and the demi perfectly balanced with the salsify. The portions were small and at this point I'm thinking... man we might have to order more food after the dinner. Until the next course came....' Fourth course; boar loin stuffed with mustard fruits,over boar bacon and mushroom risotto, boar jus: Two words: Boar. Bacon. The boar loin was perfectly roasted to a medium finish, the mustard fruits a wonderful sweet addition to the savory boar bacon and mushroom risotto. The risotto was firm and it's sauce creamy and delicious.  The fifth and final course - dessert; chef's selection of cheese, house made toast points, fruit and madeira syrup: Drool, drool, drool... these cheese was a perfect finish. The Fruit and madeira syrup were sweet, the cheese creamy and salty. A great balance!

The Portage is a great addition out here; it's like being in a cool restaurant in River West or Bucktown without the parking hassle, the traffic, or the crowds.  They have a great menu that is unpretentious yet interesting, familiar but with touches of originality that distinguish the dishes. For example, they have fries, but they are duck fat fries with two dipping sauces. Their green beans are tempura green beans, and one of their salads is a romaine salad, but they grill the romaine and immediately chill it, so you have this crisp romaine texture but with subtle grilled overtones. For entrees, the fried chicken is boneless (which is nice), and is crispy on the outside and juicy inside. The kobe burger is always a winner, as is the pork chop.  The wine list has some very nice wines with good values, and they have a full cocktail and beer selection.  It's not very big, so it's usually busy, but there is good turnover and you typically don't have to wait very long for a table. Often, we'll just get a seat at the bar and dine there, as they have a very friendly bartending crew. Which brings me to another benefit of the Portage.

As recommended, we made a reservation in advance. First impression: this place is small. The interior of the restaurant was little too cramped for my liking. I just felt like I was always in the way of someone or something else, and I'm a pretty slim guy. I can't imagine a 300-pounder making his/her way through this place. Talk about a bull in a china shop. The restaurant management is impeccable. No complaints there whatsoever. The staff was friendly and welcoming, especially the guy at the front door, who I think was the owner. Even though we had a table reservation, we quickly decided to eat at the bar instead so that we could catch the Blackhawks game that night (showing on a lone LCD behind the bar). The bar area was crowded when we arrived at around 7:30pm, but we were still able to get adjoining seats fairly quickly. The bartender was great. He made some small talk with us, but not too much - just the perfect amount. I wasn't there to make a new best friend, and neither was he. He was very good about refilling our drinks and making sure our meal was going well. The food was very good overall. However, we were both slightly disappointed with the 'New Orleans turkey pie' appetizer that we shared. It was like a basic turkey chili with a biscuit. I don't know what we were expecting but it was not worth the $9 it cost. We would've gone w/ the duck fat fries as an appetizer if our entrees didn't already come with fries (which, I don't think, were actually the duck fat fries). I ordered the Kobe burger, cooked medium-rare, which was amazing, albeit a little messy (likely my doing). My brother had the pulled pork sandwich, which he loved. He did say that he felt the sandwich ""could use some sauce."" Fries were great as well. Once again, we both lived up to our 'Captain Cleanplate' namesakes. My dad joined us later in the evening ""for a drink"" once his shift ended. He ordered the Mac N Cheese appetizer and gobbled it up in a few minutes. He loved it. He said to me, ""It's mac 'n cheese. How can you fuck up mac 'n cheese?"" Truer words may never be spoken.  We stayed at The Portage well after our meal was over, had several drinks throughout the night (somewheres in the range of 5-6 apiece). Given that, I never once felt like I wasn't welcome, or that I needed to rush out of the bar/restaurant so that other people could be accommodated for dinner. It was great. I think our bill came to around $120 with our appetizers/entrees/drinks. Don't go there thinking it's the Olive Garden. The experience was well worth the $100+ price tag, in my opinion. Some people may disagree, especially those middle-class'ers in this particular neighborhood. Just check the website for menu prices before you go there, people. No surprises that way. I'll definitely visit The Portage again. Overall, I had a great time with the people I love. Good food, good drinks, good people. Can't beat that, right? I'm not sure my family is really the 'targeted clientele' for a place like this, but we still had a great experience nonetheless. Highly recommended.",0.9994,0.724,0.228,0.048,0.5229284034078556

2010-12-06,4.0,"I really had a fun time at this place. That definitely had a lot to do with the company, which was awesome, but this place had a fun atmosphere. We sat in the ""library"" area. Basically, they have a main dining room and a patio, with a wide hallway in between. They decided to put two tables in the hallway, a built-in bookshelf on one side, and bam....you have the ""library"". It's not as bad as it sounds...it's a cosy environment, and you can browse their selection of literary works...a good conversation piece, I guess. I just wish the books had more illustrations...coffee table books would be great to spark conversation as opposed to the Harry Potter series. Regardless, it was still pretty cool. The food, for the most part was pretty good. Here's a rundown: The group shared the following appetizers: 1. Mac N Cheese - miss. Definitely skip 2. Bacon Wrapped Dates - HIT. Amazing...out of this world. Definitely get this! 3. Fried Green Beans - eh...decent, but not spectacular.  4. Duck Fat Fries - eh....just french fries...nothing special For the entree, I ordered the Salmon...oh man. It was delicious. It was grilled and was covered with the perfect amount of a sweet and savory sauce. The portion wasn't too big. I think if we hadn't ordered appetizers and dessert, I would have left hungry.  Dessert was pretty lame.The Pumpkin and Ginger Creme Brulee sounded amazing, but fell flat. Not much zing...they needed more ginger. The Chocolate Cake was also the same...just kinda blah. It really deflated the overall meal.  Overall, I don't know if I'd go back. It was cool to try, a fun experience, but not worth the trek out from downtown. But if you haven't tried it, check it out...you'll enjoy yourself there. Just skip the dessert!",0.9984,0.713,0.273,0.014,0.45705782312925164

2010-10-25,5.0,"First of all, make a reservation. Second of all, confirm your reservation. The first time the wife and I went to the Portage we didn't have a reservation, and we were told, with sympathy, that we probably wouldn't be seated for quite some time. So, we went elsewhere, but the delicious smells emanating from this charming, if bustling, restaurant made us want to return. Saturday night we were celebrating our 10th anniversary, so I called the previous Tuesday to make a reservation for 7 p.m. Saturday. I was told that would be fine and they would see us then. But when we showed up, for some reason our reservation wasn't listed. I'd like to stress that this is not a negative review, particularly because the maitre'd didn't dismiss us when he couldn't find our reservation (we must have sincere faces), and instead told us he'd try to get us seated as soon as possible. Soon was about 20 minutes, which was more than reasonable for a Saturday night crowd. Our waiter, Matt, was very attentive and helpful, as were the other servers that night. Our glasses were kept filled, our food came quickly and was delicious, and (aside from the TV set over the bar) the atmosphere was lively and fun. As for the food, the bacon-wrapped dates were exquisite, and the southern-fried chicken and potatoes were overwhelmingly tasty. The also score points for stocking not only apple but also pear cider.

2010-10-17,3.0,"My husband and I live down the street from the Portage and were very excited to try it out.  We had dinner over the summer out on the patio.  The patio was not really ready to be opened as it was the restaurant's first week open, so we can't REALLY complain about the lack of lighting.... The owner, manager and waitstaff were ridiculously helpful and friendly...just overall genuinely nice people.  But.....the portion sizes were ridiculously small for the price.  When asked how our experience was, I told the owner what we thought and he seemed very receptive.  Everything we ate was good except for the gazpacho, which tasted like cold, bland pasta sauce.  We called it a night and said we'd wait awhile and try it again once they'd been opened longer.  About two weekends ago, my husband and I went to the Portage for brunch.  Again, the service was ridiculously outstanding and the portion sizes were ridiculously small.  My  husband ordered the the steak and eggs....the steak was supposed to have been 7 ounces but was 4.5-5 ounces at best!  I don't think you should ever have to go out to eat brunch and leave hungry.  Maybe that's just me.  I had the banana pancakes which were just okay, nothing spectacular.  I think when you have a small and liminted menu, that everything on that menu should be steller.  I also think that portion size is key to a good restaurant.  They were even stingy on the potatoes that came with my husband's breakfast!  Pototoes?  We were very disappointed because we had hoped this would become a neighborhood haunt for us.  I would rather eat at the Cozy Corner for brunch and pay less to be full than go to a nicer place like the Portage, pay more and leave hungry.  I hope they get it together!  I would love to go back, as the service is top notch, but seriously folks....people go out to eat to get fed!  Do you ever have people ask for a box to take home leftovers?  Please take another look at your menu and upgrade!!  We have eaten at restaurants all over the city, and if you want to compete, you need to step up your game.  You have the basics, now impress us!  FEED your customers!!!",0.9845,0.798,0.133,0.069,0.5579966329966332
2010-10-09,3.0,"I came. I saw. I waited. And waited. And waited. And just when I was ready to eat my arm off (or my friend's arm) we finally ordered food at the bar as there was seemingly no where to sit.  We got there in time for our 6:30 reservation. Now maybe this was our fault but when the host/manager came by the bar, we said we wanted to finish our drinks before moving to a table. He sad fine, that other tables were going to be opening up. Good, right? Not so much.  At 7:15 we flagged the host back down and he said it would be just a minute. By 8:00, we were ready start munching on the bar condiments and by 8:30 we had resigned ourselves that we needed to take matters into our own hands and ordered our appetizers and dinner at the bar or we would starve.  Funny. As soon as we finished our appetizers, the host came over and said he had a table by the window that we could eat our dinners at. So we moved to the table to finish what had to be the longest meal I have ever had in a bar in my life! 3 hours and 15 minutes later I walked out exhausted.  As for the food- it was okay. We started with the crawfish dip with pita (tasty) and the bacon wrapped stuffed dates which were also quite good. For our entrees- my friend had heard raves about the pork chop (not so much- overcooked with BBQ sauce on it) and my boneless fried chicken over mashed potatoes, while good (I mean- what can you do wrong with fried chicken) looked more like fried chicken strips on a kids menu. Also- the self touted ""bubbling hot"" macaroni and cheese came warm and dried out.  Cute space although I wonder what they are going to do in the Winter months when they don't have the outside patio which doubles the size of the dining room. On the plus side- there were really nice people working there which is what got this review up to three stars. Everyone said hi and thanked us for coming. It's just too bad that we were there long enough to become friends with so many of them!  Prices are reasonable (I think our dinner ran about $80 with drinks) and there is plenty of free street parking out front on Central or after 6 you can park for free in the parking lot of the building to the south of the restaurant.

We had a reservation on a Friday night and were seated immediately, inside (there was a wait for the patio). The place is very cute - almost like living room decor - drapes, sconces, Restoration-Hardware-looking light-blue paint. I didn't love the TV, but I suppose it goes with the living/family room theme! The service was so pleasant and warm from start to finish. As a former server, I would have been very cranky in our server's shoes - she kept having to squeeze between chairs and yell over everyone (it's VERY loud in there). But she couldn't have been nicer or more accomodating. As for food, we started with the fig salad, which was fine. But the BURGERS. Wow.

VERY reasonably-priced wines - I can't believe I saw a $5 glass of wine on a menu in Chicago at a restaurant like this. That makes me so happy! Would have loved to have tried the pumpkin-ginger creme brulee because I have a major sweet-tooth, but I actually decided to forego dessert to eat my entire burger. It was that good.

Ceasar told us about the unique craft beers, served up an appetizer and he chatted with us about Lincoln Square.  In what felt like 2 minutes but was nearly 2 beers later, Quay and Neal both stopped by separately to let us know our table was ready when we were.  Gina took over from there and the entire experience, though entirely spontaneous for us seemed as if it had been carefully choreographed for just the two of us.  Without being intrusive, the staff was always nearby when we wanted more of something or had a question.  Equally as delighful as the staff were the food and the back patio.  If you like the chill, almost zen-like patio atmosphere of places like Kirkwood on Sheffield in Lakeview (on a slow night) or In Fine Spirits in Andersonville, you'll love this place even more.  As for the food, we tried the duck fat fries as an app and had the Kobe burger and the salmon with succotash... all of which were incredible and we'd order again.  (And I don't even care for duck or salmon.)  Cannot wait to get back to this off the beaten path gem in Portage Park.  And hopefully someone else will drive me so I can try the rest of those beers next time!",0.9756,0.828,0.108,0.064,0.46303418803418805

We've been living in a fine dining dessert. However, I think you guys have some work to do.  Regarding the Food:  Here is what I suspect is going on. When taste testing the menu, I'm sure everything is rock solid and you all pat each other on the back. When it's game time, I think the kitchen is getting frazzled and corners are getting cut. I've eaten here twice and both times the food was either overcooked or undercooked. Perhaps there is a need for one more line cook?  Regarding the Service:  Exceptional. It's great to have excellent service at a place I'd like to consider dining out at frequently.  Regarding the decor:  I was blown away by the outdoor patio. Absolutely gorgeous. The inside is another story. It simply is not in line with the modern design of the patio. Furthermore, I think the little library area is a waste of a seating area if you ask me. Lastly, take a second look at the bathrooms. They feel as if they were the last thing on anyone's mind prior to opening. The blue mirror in the men's bathroom is awful.  In closing, I wish you had opened in Six Corners along Milwaukee but I don't blame you. I so desperately want you guys to be successful so that others take note and take a chance at Portage Park too.

You really don't get much of a choice on what you get (outside picking either a red or white) but they did do us the favor to pair the wine with our food.  Really nice job.  Later in the night we had dessert = home made ice cream (try the buttered popcorn flavor) and their flourless chocolate cake. Yum! I while i didn't mention specifics about the rest of their food last time i feel compelled to say that they burger is really good.  A nice juicy Kobe burger, with grilled onions and homemade pickles and other fixens give it such a great homemade and delicious flavor.  The pretzel roll is a little much for me (and that really could be said about all restaurants that offer their high-end burger on a pretzel roll) but i appreciate the build. Add their Duck Fat fries and you're in business.  Another dish to try is their Grilled, bone-in pork chops with creamed spinach and bacon + mashed sweet potatoes.  You won't be able to put that down.  It's really good.  I could go on and on since they have so much good food. Need more of these types of restaurants in the Portage/Old Irvin Park Area so I'm glad we have them now.  And i know those guys pay really close attention to reviews so i certainly applaud them for listening and addressing comments that come in.  Bottom line is that this is a great place and they're getting 5 stars given their continued pursuit of great food AND great service.

My husband and I stopped in kind of early on a Friday night, intrigued by the good review from a friend, and also by the interesting menu. We started with bacon wrapped dates, stuffed with goat cheese.  They were delicious, and not in a you-can't-go-wrong-when-you-wrap-anything-in-bacon way- these were delicous on their own merit.  Some sort of honey-based sauce drizzled on the top...a great start. The entrees were all interesting.  My pork chop with creamed spinach and mashed sweet potatoes pretty much melted in my mouth.  I ended up scarfing the entire thing down (!).  Excellent.   My husband got the short ribs over cous cous- also very delicious (yes I still managed to steal a couple bites from him despite my being so full from eating my own). We couldn't resist the flourless chocolate cake for dessert.  I thought, ""I'll just have a couple bites"", but we both kept going.  We were part of the clean plate club.  With everything. This is a new restaurant, but it seemed that tonight, they had all those new-restaurant kinks worked out.  We had a great server, the tables were well bussed, and the owner stopped by and chatted with us for a bit (but did not overstay his welcome).  Seems like some genuinely good peeps work here.  Actually, everyone who worked there seemed to be pretty happy.  I like that.  (I hate it when I go to a restaurant, and the food and service are just fine, but you can sense some underlying tension between the staff.  I did not get that vibe here at all.) Ambiance: Great environment.  We sat outside on the patio, and of course it didn't hurt that it was a great night out.  They have finished the back patio really nicely.  It had a warm, comfortable feel to it.   The inside looked great, too, although we didn't sit there. On our way out, my only concern was that we wouldn't be able to find a table in the winter time- it seems like at least half of their seating is outdoors, and the indoor dining area probably only seats 40 people (?).   All in all, a great evening!  We'll be back, and bringing friends with us!",0.9982,0.728,0.238,0.035,0.6578282828282829

We went to The Portage last night for my husband's birthday and we had a great time.  From the moment we walked in the door and were greeted by Neal to our creamy, delicious chocolate ice cream, everything was top notch.   My only complaint - which is very slight - is that I would have liked the bacon to be a bit more crispy on the Bacon Wrapped Date appetizer, but everything else was perfect.  We loved the Malt Vinegar Aioli that came with the Duck Fat Fries!  Everyone cleaned their plates and my son actually had 2 entrees (kid sized, but still delicious!).   I also love the Library and look forward to my next trip to trade some of my old books for some of their selections.  I'm also looking forward to another Red Sangriatini - what a perfect drink for sitting out in their beautiful outdoor patio!",0.9923,0.769,0.224,0.008,0.5898550724637681

I ordered a White Sangria martini, and it was strong and delicious. The food was just okay. Ordered the southern fried chicken, kinda tastes and had the consistency of Popeyes. The sauce it came with was tasty but didn't seem to go with the chicken, it was like sweetish gravy. Ordered mashed sweet potatoes on the side, and it was quite good. Friend had a reuben sandwich, wasn't that crazy about it, she especially didn't like the bread. The fries were good.

2010-08-23,5.0,I have been to The Portage three times already and it is now one of my favorite restaurants in the city. Great operation with the host and the owner having a front of the house well managed and the food coming out of the kitchen is great. I have tried a wide variety of items and each has been fantastic. The menu is often changing so it is great to see new items each time I have been. The dessert is also wonderful; I love the inventive ice creams they rotate (butter popcorn and apple/ bacon are two of the best). The outdoor space is very nice.

2010-08-20,5.0,"I hesitate to write a review about this place for two reasons: 1) I've only been there once so far and I like to try things a couple times before I review them and 2) I loved it so much I want to take it home and hide it in a box in my closet so no one knows and I can have it all to myself and take it out on holidays and pet it and love it and name it Walter...  ...Sorry, got a little off course there.  But I'm writing anyways because I was so charmed by the place and dammit, they deserve 5 star reviews and for the word to get out about them. I want these guys to stick around as long possible. I just hope that they don't go the way of Kuma's and get so overrun that I never go there anymore (which I don't). So I'm taking the risk. I'm going out on a limb for YOU, Portage, because it was so darn good.  The service was attentive and polite and, most importantly, sincere. I mean, it really seemed like everybody there honestly wanted us to have a great time. These are people I feel like I could be friends with. The manager and the owner visited our table and chatted with us - it was all very conversational and light and enjoyable.  And the food... the food was delightful. We had the bacon-wrapped dates as an appetizer which was a bit of test - I've prepared this particular nosh several times and I was curious to see if, and how, a restaurant could elevate the dish. Well, elevate they did with subtle touches; the bacon was hand-cut and local; the dates basked in lavender honey and a refreshing salad of frisee garnished the dish, a great balance to all that sweet and richness.  Our main courses were delectable as well. I had the southern fried chicken with coconut rice and fresh summer veggies - heavenly. The only tiny note I could possibly muster was I could have used maybe a tisch more of the sauce, which was reminiscent of a creamy southern pepper-gravy. The chicken was crispy yet light, the rice wasn't too sweet, the veggies cooked through but still crisp... they nailed it. My friend got the duck special, which was also prepared beautifully. Tender and flavorful... I was able to steal two bites and we both ended up with clean plates and full bellies. Which didn't stop us...  ... from ordering dessert. We were tempted by the many selections of house-made ice cream but I was feeling in a chocolate mood so we settled on the flourless chocolate cake. The portion was a slab, I mean, a frickin' SLAB of cake, it was ridiculous. And it was delicious. We could only eat so much of it but it was fantastic. Rich yet light, full of flavor but not cloying... Y-Y-Y-YUM. I brought the leftovers home to my boyfriend who eagerly bench pressed the remaining portion. I told him it was a preview of tasty things to come...  So yeah, this place... it's awesome. Nice variety of wines by the glass, all under $10; super reasonable prices for the quality of ingredients and portions; attentive and accommodating staff; forward-thinking yet accessible food that's well executed... it's got it all.

I got to the restaurant right as they opened and was greeted by the manager who made every effort to let me know that he and the staff were really grateful that I came in.  I was seated outside on a beautiful night on their relaxing and modern patio which made me forget that I was half a block from the busy irving /central intersection. The Kobe burger and fries were unbelievable!  Everything was so fresh and neat.  The Portage really turns out a quality product.  According to the waiter the restaurant makes the majority of the items on the menu from scratch, all the way down to the pickles that come with the burger.  I could probably rant and rave for another 3 paragraphs, but all I have to say is that the Portage is worth the trip.  Its great to finally see new local business moving to portage Park!",0.9732,0.818,0.157,0.025,0.46385937295028207
2010-08-18,5.0,"I've been to the Portage three times and each time the owners (Quay and Neil) have both recognized me and gave me a warm greeting. Already, I'm impressed!  The old ""Don't Worry Bar"" has been transformed into the quaint ""the Portage restaurant"". I'm a native Portage Parkian (born and raised), and I have to say this place is giving our little neighborhood a taste of Lincoln Park, Wicker Park and I'll even go as far as saying Ravenswood.  It's on Central just south of Irving. When you arrive to the front of the establishment, you'll find tall glass windows that allow you a peak inside. When you walk in, don't head straight ahead, make an immediate left and you'll be in the dining room. As the other reviewers have said, you'll be greeted by one of the owners or the friendly wait staff.  You have your choice of dining inside, where the lights are dim but lit enough to read the seasoned menu or if the weather permits you can sit outside in the beautiful outdoor patio. The patio is decorated with slate tile flooring and Brazilian wood trimmed fencing. There is even a subtle fountain to add to the dinning experience.  Backing up inside, before you get to the patio you'll pass the bar, where Cesar, your friendly bartender who makes a mean Green Limousine cocktail is there working hard. Wave hi! There are tables along the wall in the bar area - perfect for an intimate dinner with a date or a girls night out (just you and one girlfriend, tables seat 2).  Beyond the bar area is a step up to the restrooms and a little room that the owners like to call the library. Here you'll find couches and chairs and a coffee table that looks onto to a bookshelf filled with books. The books are for you to borrow and add to if you'd like.  The food - AMAZING! Portions are small enough but fill you up! Apps are unique and make you want to try all of them!  They recently received their liquor license and they have variety of wines and original cocktails. They also serve more micro brews (in a bottle) than Bud lites and Coronas, but I'd expect that from a place like this.  I highly recommend giving the Portage a try.

2010-08-17,2.0,"The Portage advertises itself as a gastropub. After dining here I had to re-visit the definition of the word. ""Equal parts pub and gastronomy."" I didn't quite get that at The Portage. First of all, no tap beers. Not to diminish from their bottle selection- which was nice.  But I think of a pub and I think of beer on tap. The lighting in the restaurant itself needs to be dimmed. Yet another restaurant in Chicago that cannot figure out how to properly light a space.  The menu was small but good - there were a few unexpected items.  Prices were very good- especially for drinks.  Service very friendly.  In fact the service was so friendly that it did not make sense. Walk in the door and the owner(s) greet you, shake your hand and introduce themselves. Then ask your name- as if they want to learn it.  So you think you're in for a fantastic experience.  Then a few minutes later when the owner comes by your table to say hello- you think, well isn't this nice, they really care. No, they really don't. Because after stopping by our table a number of times, the 'nice' owner still didn't realize it had taken the two of us over an hour to get our dinner. On a week night when the restaurant was barely half full.   The food was fine, the portions were small- which I am okay with. But I am seriously not okay with the fake chit chat and niceties when it doesn't translate into a good dining experience.  Look, I'm coming to your restaurant to have dinner. Not to sit around, get eaten by mosquitos on your patio and wait for over an hour while my mushroom caps and pork chops are being prepared. On the way out we kindly informed the owners of our wait.

2010-08-08,4.0,"We'd been looking forward to trying The Portage since we first heard that they were going to open. After reading some of the more critical Yelp reviews we weren't sure how it would go. I'm happy to report that our experience was great. We arrived early (~6pm) on a Friday evening and were seated outside. It was a beautiful evening. The outdoor seating area is very nicely done. The walls are lined with cute little ornamental bushes and the water feature is a nice touch. The chairs were comfortable and the ambience was great. The beer list was decent and spanned a number of styles from brown ales and stouts to IPA to lagers. The wine list had a number of good selections.  We ordered the Mac'n'Cheese and Roasted Tomato Watermelon Gazpacho as appetizers. The soup is wonderful blend of summer flavors and is very refreshing. The Mac'n'Cheese is good, but not great. I like more cheesiness in my Mac'n'Cheese. The pasta was properly cooked and the bread crumb topping provided a nice textural variation. We intended to order the pork chop and fried chicken as our entrees. However, I couldn't resist trying the diver scallops they had as a special. I was not disappointed. The scallops were perfectly seared and tasted great. The onion-potato pancake on which they were served was crunchy on the outside but soft and delicious on the inside. The blackberry balsamic sauce was delicate and used sparingly, perfectly complimenting the scallops. It would be easy to overwhelm the scallops if the chef had a heavy hand with the sauce. The grapefruit supremes, raspberries and greens that topped the dish looked great and accented the rest of the flavors in the dish. The pork chop was perfectly cooked. The sweet potato mash, of which I am normally not a fan, was really well prepared. The creamed spinach was wonderfully creamy. The only criticism I'd have for this dish is that the chop is a bit thin as a dinner chop. Another 1/4"" thicker and it would be perfect. For desert we had creme brulee and an order of the ice cream. The creme brulee was warm inside, caramelized on top and delicious everywhere. In other words, it was perfect. The ice cream...Wow! Apple bacon, buttered popcorn and strawberry ricotta. Three flavor combinations I'd never encountered in ice cream before. They were all fantastic. The apple bacon ice cream is a must have. My wife likes the buttered popcorn the best. The berry ricotta was interesting in a good way. The ice cream even has some of the texture of real ricotta. I'd order them all again. By the time we left the place was packed. The space inside is very small and was pretty loud. Not unexpected on a Friday night. We were told they were looking at ways of keeping the outside seating area open in the winter. I hope they come up with a good solution as they are going to need the extra tables. We'll be back to The Portage before too long.",0.9994,0.714,0.263,0.023,0.659532101397773

The service here is super friendly.  Which can be a good thing if they get things right, but if upon arrival the table next to you feels awkward to point out the the entrees they received are completely wrong, that cheerfulness can become pretty annoying. Started with cocktails, which were a little watery but okay. Ordered two apps to share:  the green beans and the bacon covered dates.  Whenever I go out for tapas, I get the bacon covered dates, I love them so!  What we got last night might have ruined my bacon-date desire for life.  What came to the table were tiny stuffed dates wrapped in barely cooked mostly fatty bacon that had no crispness whatsoever.  If we were not soooo bloody hungry we would have sent them back, and also at this point we did not want to start the meal on a sour note with the staff.  We gulped them down, but still can not fathom how any chef in his/her right mind would be okay with sending anything like that out.  Visually, the most unappetizing course I have had this year.  Far less grevious were the beans, which were too greasy and served with a very tasteless sauce. Ah...on the the entrees.  Hoping for something better...too bad, sucker!  The pork chop and sauce were okay, but the flavor was sort of soapy, and the thin breakfast chop did not justify the 16 dollar price tag, especially with such a meager serving of sweet potatoes and spinach.   The short rib was odd...the meat itself was flavorless...like the meat left over after making soup, and the sauce covering it was reduced to an extremely salty tongue-dessicating oblivion. Although we were still hungry, when we were asked if we wanted dessert, it was easy to say no.   Also, didn't help that they were out of any of the decent beers and the apple pie.

(I'm horrible with names, but the tall, shaven man) who was very proud of the establishment. The Portage has a library and a patio. We sit at our seats and check out the dual sided one page menu. I order the duck fat fries and the bone in porkchop. She gets the bacon wrapped dates and the skirt steak. The fries were delicious, but the chop not so much. Her dates were awesome (though that was the first time i had a date?) but her skirt steak was tender and ultra delicious. Let's go back to the fries for a second. Sweet and salty yet not over powering. They came with mayo and spicy mustard. I highly recommend the fries. To compliment our meals, we chose to bring some Goose Island brews- The Demolition and Fluer. I love Fluer and will recommend it with anything. The Portage should get thier liquor license within this month. The shelf is full, albeit with the usual suspects of top shelf material. I could see this place having a fine whiskey shelf, but give it time. We ordered dessert which was the ice cream - lemon, strawberry and BUTTER POPCORN. The first two were meh, but that BUTTER POPCORN deserves capslock and a ""humina"" twice. Here goes. BUTTER POPCORN HUMINA HUMINA. The final bill wasn't bad. I mean, total of 60 bucks for the aforementioned, is on par with other places. The appetizers are cheaper then than the entree, but the entrees are pretty expensive for the portions. It equals out. Still love it.  In short: visit, dine, smile.",0.996,0.787,0.186,0.026,0.5292447916666667
2010-07-05,5.0,"A perfect new place for Portage Park. Any opening night kinks that were mentioned in earlier reviews, have definitely been ironed out.  We have been there twice and can't wait to go back.  Very friendly staff and lovely decor.  The patio is comfortable and very secluded considering that the restaurant is close to a busy corner. And the food...well, it's really good!.  beet salad, green beans, pork chop with mashed sweet potatoes, skirt steak, gazpacho...everything is excellent.  And the portions are perfect (not grotesquely oversized).  We are thrilled this much-needed place is here.",0.9843,0.728,0.272,0.0,0.6179144385026738
2010-07-03,4.0,"So, I discovered this place reading the RedEye when i was on the train headed to class. When i first saw the article, I was very excited. There was finally a place near my house that wasn't fast food or Mexican cuisine! So looking at the online menu, I planned my attack and took my father with to pay. I lived in the Portage Park neighborhood my whole life and i never called ""Portage Park"" a neighborhood, just simply called it northwest side Chicago...so when first mentioning ""The Portage,"" the name didn't roll off my tongue easily.      The restaurant looks amazing! It looks like a house remodeled into a restaurant which i didn't mind. We were greeted with smiles and joy. Inside it didn't look like it could fit  25+. The tables we're close to each other but they did the best with what they had. They seated us on the outdoor patio.       The waiting staff is super friendly and talkative (not that fake friendliness). I ordered the Catfish Po'boy and my father ordered the Kobe (Bryant) Burger (my father is not funny). The food took awhile to come out but it was worth it!  WOW! The catfish was juicy and flaky and full of flavor.  I sneaked a piece of my father's burger and it was amazing. It was tender, juicy all on a pretzel bun with this sauce made for kings! The Mac n Cheese was really good too! When I tried the fries, they were cold but still tasted good. The portions of the fries were really small. The menu does need a little more work in order to satisfy my wants but hopefully in due time this will become a Portage Park staple.",0.9954,0.775,0.202,0.023,0.5548003072196621
2010-07-01,4.0,"Wonderful!  What a great surprise to see one of the local (scary) bars turned into an upscale restaurant! The food was Delicious, the service was perfect and the outdoor patio is lovely. So far it's still BYO which is OK by me.  Dinner so far? The burger is amazing on a pretzel roll. The fried chicken very tasty, and my friend said her pork chop with mashed sweet potato was perfection! Dessert was a taste of each of their homemade ice creams.  Buttered popcorn? Amen! You can't believe it!  Lemon ginger? Perfect on top of the apple pie.  Apple bacon? What?!#$ No way- yes please! Unbelievable.  I'm a fan, I'll be back!",0.9943,0.614,0.371,0.015,0.7388888888888889
2010-06-30,4.0,"I cannot express how happy I am to have such an amazing restaurant in my neighborhood. No more heading down to the loop (or further) for a nice dinner.  I have been there twice now and both times the food and service has been amazing. The staff are curtious and helpful, Neil is super friendly and easy to talk with. I love that he is living in the neighborhood and coming out to all the fun events that Portage Park has to offer. (In fact, I saw him at Movies in the Park last night!) I have had the Kobe burger, fries, mac and cheese, green beans and flourless cake (not all in one sitting) and each of them was incredibly delicious. My husband loved the adobo salmon and sweet potatoes. They have a nice selection for the kids which is hard to find in nicer restaurants, so that is always welcome and helpful. The new patio is beautiful and very inviting! I can't wait to try the new brunch menu!  I highly recommend The Portage and hope that they are the first of many great new restaurants in the Portage Park neighborhood!",0.9965,0.673,0.299,0.028,0.6144730639730639
2010-06-29,5.0,"This place is exactly what I have been hoping for since I moved to the neighborhood four years ago. I've been anxiously awaiting the opening for a few months - as I pass by this place frequently when I walk my dogs. Finally - I noticed it was open and my wife and I grabbed a few beers (they are currently BYO pending a liquor license) and paid a visit. Immediately upon entering, we were warmly greeted by the host and general manager. We chose to sit on the newly constructed patio in back. You would never know this place was formerly an ""old man"" dive bar with infrequent hours and questionable clientele. The joint has cleaned up nicely. The friendly service continued with our waiter and, for a minute, I forgot I was in Chicago - where rudeness seems to be the norm.  Now for the food: I opted for the oyster po' boy sandwich and my wife had the fried chicken. Both dishes did not disappoint. As self confessed food snobs (my wife is a chef), we are likely more critical than other diners when evaluating restaurant food. The butter popcorn ice cream on the desert menu was much too intriguing to pass up. I can't wait for our next visit - since many of the menu items sounded great.",0.7064,0.843,0.089,0.068,0.5145979020979021
2010-06-29,5.0,"Very excited to have a new swanky place on the NW side. We missed the grand opening, but finally made it a week after opening. I love what they did with the interior. Even though they don't have a liquor license yet, they have a beautiful bar with granite counter top. As you head to the rear, they designed a little lounge area that should become very popular too. We decided to eat in the patio since we brought our two boys and the staff was very friendly and receptive. Their kids menus while simple was delicious. We got the side of mac n cheese for both boys and they loved it! I think I would order that as an entree. I tried the Kobe burger-4stars. Loved it. My wife wasn't happy with her entree. The cut of meat wasn't to her liking. The owner immediately came by and replaced it at no cost with another dish. My wife loved it. We also had the following which were excellent. Duck fat fries- Butter popcorn icecream.  Overall, I would recommend it, especially the modern patio.  Hopefully other hip restaurants will follow their lead.",0.9944,0.689,0.252,0.059,0.6914403778040144
2010-06-27,5.0,"Well, at the risk of sounding redundant with all the other reviews, I want to say that The Portage is a welcome addition to the neighborhood! The wife and I stopped in last week. We were welcomed as soon as we entered the restaurant by Neil (sp?) and it is nice to see his enthusiasm while he took us on a tour of the restaurant. It's nice to see people that truly love their jobs.  They had not received their liquor license but were happy to pour us a glass of wine on the house. We tried as much as we could, fried chicken, beet salad, crab cakes, chocolate cake, some other dishes (I wish that I had written this review as soon as I came home, but I got busy until now...)  Service was spot on, the food took a little longer than expected coming out, but it was well worth the wait. Our waitress, Tiffany, was charming and personable. I'm torn about writing this review, I want them to stay open but I really want to keep this restaurant all to myself.",0.9804,0.781,0.192,0.028,0.537037037037037
2010-06-24,5.0,"Finally! We couldn't have been more excited about the prospect of a new go-to upscale casual restaurant in our neck of the woods. We stopped in last night and happily, our expectations were fully met by the wonderful food and service.  We tried a bit of everything on the menu - bacon wrapped dates, roasted tomato gazpacho, & beet and goat salad. Awesome!!! Then we shared the flank steak and pulled pork sandwich, both of which had interesting accents (really fresh chimichurri on the flank and slightly sweet & tangy slaw on the pork). Desserts are nice, classic combinations with a couple interesting twists. We sampled a couple of their ice cream flavors - bacon & strawberry-ricotta, which were creamy, sweet, smoky and balanced. We'll be trying the butter popcorn ice cream next time. Neil and team are obviously proud of the work they've put into the comfortable and contemporary space, as well as the well-executed food. We are looking forward to seeing The Portage become part of the northwest side community :)",0.9932,0.729,0.261,0.01,0.6462481962481963
2010-06-23,5.0,"My boyfriend and I where excited to find this swanky little restaurant in the neighborhood. The food was delicious, I had the pork chop with sweet potato mash and it had to be one of the best pork chop I have ever had. My boyfriend had the kobe burger which was also really good. Everyone was really friendly and the service was great!  I can't wait to go back.",0.9761,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.5611111111111111
2010-06-23,5.0,"It's so great that there's a new place for my husband and I to go to dinner right in the neighborhood. We're so used to going elsewhere to find a upscale dining. The service was great. We were greeted by at least 4 people one of which gave me a tour of the place. Throughout dinner, they checked to make sure we were all right. I didn't wait very long for anything. I was pleasantly surprised about that considering it was a Saturday night around 8 pm.  The restaurant is nicely decorated and the patio looks fabulous! I was informed they will be serving brunch starting this weekend which I will definitely be trying. The food was excellent. It definitely was not typical bar food. We had the duck fat fries for an appetizer. I had the amazing kobe burger on a pretzel bun and my husband had the skirt steak. Both were very tasty. It was hard to choose what to eat as there were many other tempting dishes - southern fried chicken, pork chops, pulled pork sandwich. Everything sounded fabulous! But, what I really have to talk about is dessert. Being stuffed,  I almost didn't order any. I'm so glad I did. We had the strawberry ricotta ice cream and the buttery popcorn ice cream. That was AMAZING! I had no trouble pushing it down despite my full belly. The strawberry ricotta ice cream was creamy but not heavy. And the buttery popcorn ice cream literally tasted like buttered popcorn. I wasn't sure how it would taste before I got it. Jelly Belly makes a jelly bean of the same flavor and that tastes ok. But, the ice cream was better than that. When I asked one of the staff how they get this flavor, they explained that they actually strain buttered popcorn to get the flavoring. I loved it! The other desserts looked great as well.  My husband and I will definitely be going there for another date night in the near future. But this weekend I will be stopping by for brunch. Hopefully brunch will be as good as dinner and I'll become a regular bruncher there!",0.9959,0.798,0.183,0.018,0.5518461462779645
2010-06-22,4.0,"I have driven by this place everyday and noticed its daily progress and was happy to see that it's finally open. You have to understand that the Portage Park area doesn't have any fine bistro dinning. It does have its fair share of great Mexican and polish restaurants but nothing when it comes to wanting a great Kobe burger with a side of sweet mash potatoes.  I ate outside and had the bacon wrapped dates stuffed with cheese and tempura fried green beans as an appetizer, I was with somebody so don't think I'm a glutton. Honestly you cant go wrong with wrapping everything in bacon. They both tasted as good as I hoped they would. After that we tried the smoked tomato gazpacho which was nice but almost needed a bit of something else to give it a kick. For the main course I went with the Kobe burger as I mentioned above and the flavors  were great and it seems like everyone is using pretzel buns for burgers now. Also had the side of mac and cheese was great and had just the right amount of cheese. I know some places go to much with the cheese so that your face feels greasy or the cheese is to overpowering.  For dessert, the apple pie with lemon ice cream fell a bit short. Most may like it but I'm tough when it comes to pie. You can't skimp on apples and you have to have a great crust or else you just made cobbler.  One interesting thing though is that they had a bacon flavored ice cream not on the dessert menu. It had an interesting texture and just a hint of smokey bacon. I liked it and was blown away by the thought that bacon could be used as an ice cream flavor. Glad I tried it but I don't' think I could always go for it. Overall a great start to a brand new venture and kudos to the owner for trying something like this in Portage Park and I hope he does well and gets his liquor license soon because it will definitely increase traffic, at least for me because I would have loved a Stella with my Kobe burger.",0.9988,0.741,0.252,0.007,0.5599146224146224
2010-06-19,5.0,"We are so excited to have The Portage in our neighborhood! We usually trek to other neighbohoods like Lincoln Square, Bucktown, or downtown to have dinner on the weekends. Now, we can walk two blocks for a restaurant that could easily be found in one of these trendier neighborhoods. We and our and friends in the neighborhood have been waiting for this for a long time! We sat out on the newly opened patio. It is a great looking space. The woodwork is amazing. I know we'll be spendng quite a few summer evenings out there!  We had 4 adults and 3 kids in our group. Between us, the food highlights were the tempura green beans, the gazpacho, the kobe burger, the pulled pork sandwich, and the salmon entree. Everything we ordered was great. If it weren't for our overly-tired daughter, we would have stayed for dessert. Next time for sure. Both the owner and manager came to our table to introduce themselves and welcome us. They seem to be hearing from many people like us in the neighborhood who are equally excited about The Portage's arrival in Portage Park.",0.9861,0.823,0.168,0.009,0.5563604797979798
