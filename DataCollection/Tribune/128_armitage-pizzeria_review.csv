The pizza itself is a little greasy, but the owner is very kind and gives you as many napkins as you need. Refreshingly, the owner asks only $1 for a can of soda, which by my book is quite affordable. The crust - on the large end-  is thick, crunchy, a little chewy, and supportive of the rest of the slice. It's easiest to eat the pizza by folding the small end in a little, and eating it like a pizza sandwich. Armitage pizza is super fun to eat, and PERFECT for dates!

There were plenty of toppings on the custom pizza that we ordered (pepperoni and red pepper) and the white pizza was delicious as well.

I'm not sure if the driver was upset that I didn't tip enough and made up the story about me accusing the pizza of being late, or if the owner had the wrong number (the delivery man had a third pizza with him, maybe those customers thought their pizza was late?).  Either way, the owner was a jerk and we will never return.

2013-08-19,2.0,"I was excited to try this place for the first time last night. When I placed the order for delivery the whole experience really started off on the wrong foot, the person who answered (who I believe is the owner) got annoyed with me that I added cheese on the list of ingredients I wanted on each pizza. The reason why I specified that I wanted cheese was that the first pizza I was ordered was their tomato pie and I wanted to make sure he didn't make all subsequent pizzas without cheese. You can be annoyed with me all you want, but I don't think you should vocalize that to a customer, especially not a first time customer. I then expressed that I did not want the pizzas delivered until 8:00 which was four hours after I placed the order. He got annoyed with me again and told me never to order that far in advance as he would be likely to misplace the ticket. OK. I obviously could do no right here. Come 8:15, the pizzas were nowhere in sight. I called the restaurant and the owner picked us saying ""I ran out of dough"". I got very upset due to the fact that I called several hours beforehand to place my order. He said that my pizzas were on their way but I got lucky since I ""circumvented the system"" by ordering so far in advance and that he had now run out of dough. He told me to never do that again. I have never been talked to like that before by a business owner. I am not a child and if he did not want to take my order so far in advance he should have told me to call back later. This is completely unacceptable. I should not be made to feel as though I am lucky to have received the pizza I ordered. This kind of terrible customer service made me feel like I was being punk'd and Ashton Kutcher was going to show up with my pizzas.  It was bizarre. The sad part is that my pizza was very good. The favors were balanced and it was cooked perfectly. When you have a solid product that you are selling, I find it very unfortunate when the customer service doesn't live up to the taste.",0.2087,0.815,0.097,0.088,0.5985478335478337

We had to pay for parking and it took us like 5 minutes to get across the street, what with all the bikers, cabs and maniacs flying up and down the road.  I was not happy.

2013-05-15,5.0,"There are many types of good pizza out there. Thin crust, deep dish, spa, cracker crust, etc. Being from MA, I have been looking for a great thin crust, just like home. That means thin, yet chewy, and you eat it with three fingers and fold it up in half a bit. After stumbling on some amazing food porn from the 2013 Time Out Chicago Eat Out Awards, I came across a photo of a delicious looking pie by Armitage Pizzeria, and mentally filed the name of Armitage Pizzeria away in my brain.  Fast forward 3 weeks...it was a perfect take out night and we were already on the road, so going to pick up this pie wasn't a big deal. I was told it was a 30 minute wait. I showed up in about 22, and took a seat on the side of this little shop until my order was ready. As I looked around, I saw Massachusetts license plates and chotchkies, and it dawned on me...my quest for pizza like back home landed me in a spot that was made from someone back home. And I was right. The owner is Jay and he's from Worcester. The shop is tiny, with 3 people working together. I'm not going to lie, it looked a little stressful, but the end product was so good. (so Good! so good! so good! a la ""Sweet Caroline""). There isn't a lot of distractions like Boiler Room with their crazy toppings or excessive use of corn meal on the bottom of their crust. It's simple, and therefore it has to be done perfect and use great ingredients. And it was. We got two pizzas, one sausage and the other veggie. We preferred the sausage, although both was great. There is only one size (14 inches) and they are cash only. But the drive is worth it. It really hit the spot for a year long craving. There is no website, so check out the photos to see the menu.

Then, when we were ready to order, he kept answering the phone, taking 3 orders before even talking to us.  Next, the food. In all respects this pizza was mediocre. First, the dough was very thin, neutral, which is fine, because that's what New York style is. Second, the sauce was tasteless and watery, so much so that most of the crust was wet and soggy and the toppings slid right off upon attempting to fold and eat. Third, the toppings (we got roma tomatoes, pepperoni, and jalapenos) were cheap -- the kind you could pick up at any run-of-the-mill grocery store -- and accordingly they tasted ordinary and plain.

Luckily, the pizza turned out to be delicious.  Thin and crisp, one of my favorites in the area.  The white pie was perfect.   I completely understand the complaints form people about no website and no credit cards.  It definitely makes the place less convenient, but the owner seems to just be all about pizza, damn convenience and technology.  It'd be easy enough to make a simple site, even if it just had the menu, address, and phone number.   The space is just too small really, as cool as it is to be a ""hole in the wall"" place.  Some narrow counters could be added very cheaply along the back wall to give a few more people some (standing) eating space. With such great pizza, the potential of this place is sky high, so I hope they capitalize on it.",0.9928,0.777,0.168,0.054,0.5558473389355743

From the second my wife, son, buddy and I entered this little(one tall table-CARRYOUT), we were greeted by the owner and his protege as if we were his bros' from back East. Both the fellas were as cool and friendly as can be, and just left us feeling so chill.  Anyhow, last night we ordered 2 pizzas, one White and one Meat. Both were incredible. From the crust, which was crispy and chewy, to the sauce which was just right, and the cheese which was gooey, and finally to the toppings, these pizzas just stood out. They were honestly just perfect, and left us stone cold quiet while scarfing them down. We also ordered the Caprese Salad, and this also was great. The tomatoes were fresh, the mozzarella was tasty, and the basil and olive oil were just right. Starting with this really got our taste-buds going. In closing, I wanted to get at least one point across. I have lived in the East, minutes north of the Bronx, and every time the question comes up, ""Is it East Coast Style Pizza"" I start to cringe. Living there taught me that there are many varying ways to toss a pie. Some slices I've had were huge, thin, foldable, chewy, etc.. WHILE SOME ARE TOTALLY DIFFERENT.

2012-11-02,5.0,"I love pizza in Chicago and I love quality. I search for quality and I reject poor craftsmanship. James and his sidekick (Ed?) labor for perfection. James takes pride in his craft. He is in the prime of his abilities and I hope he stays there for years. As I said, I search for quality. I believe there are three major types of pizza in Chicago: 1) Deep Dish; 2) Neapolitan; and 3) Thin Crust. Pequod's has the best deep dish, it's even better than Burt's Place, sadly. Spacca Napoli has the best Neapolitan style. James at AP is currently making the best thin crust. I won't waste my time with thin crust anywhere else, with occasional exceptions based on geography or circumstances.  Don't ask this man to put pineapple or ranch dressing on your pizza. Please, just don't ask. He plucks fresh toppings and to me the best possible combinations are the following: 1) Red sauce pizza with sausage, onion, garlic (not on menu but he will add it if you ask), basil (optional). You can add mushrooms if you want to get high or if you want a change of pace. 2) White pizza with sausage, onion, and tomato (don't forget the tomato to balance out the whiteness). He can and should raise his prices by about 10-15%. Be sure to get in here before he does that, as the quality simply does not match the prices at the moment. The first hit is always cheaper than the second. Also, come ready to joke around with James. Don't let this man get bored or even consider for a second that he should find a different job. Also, don't try to date him or to find him a girlfriend because it will distract him from his precise focus on his craft. AP spices up an otherwise intolerably organic makeup laden neighborhood.

2012-08-12,4.0,"An excellent neighborhood thin-crust pizzeria.  Armitage is situated in the heart of Lincoln Park, steps away from the most vibrant blocks of Armitage Avenue. Its location is well characterized as a no-frills hole in the wall take-out joint given its plain white exterior, minimal interior adornment, and limited seating. Armitage's menu is strictly pizza, and easily affordable, offering a variety of 14-inch pizzas starting at $10. The pizzeria is cash-only, so make sure to have some on hand.  Armitage's pizza is thin, crunchy, light, and full of flavor. Besides the standard cheese pizza, offering a well proportioned and blended mix of cheese and tomato, patrons would be remiss not to order the white pizza, featuring mozzarella and ricotta, and delicately finished with basil and oregano. A 14-inch pie is enough to serve two, and will leave patrons feeling satisfied, but not overly full.  Patrons will enjoy conversing with Armitage's amicable owner, James Spillane. A pizza industry veteran from the Bay State, James opened up Armitage a few months ago after leaving another Chicago pizza joint which he co-owned. James appears to be transitioning Armitage from a one-man shop, but still rolls dough, adds toppings, and attentively monitors pizza in the oven. Pizza connoisseurs will appreciate speaking with James about his approach to pizza making given his knowledge and experience in the industry.

Jay is a great, great guy, and chatted with us while we waited for our two pizzas to cook. It was fun to watch him put the pies together from scratch with simple, fresh ingredients -- after both watching and talking to him, you can tell he really cares about what he does and wants to make delicious, well-made food. After the pizzas hung out in the hot oven for a few minutes, he took them out to ask if they were cooked to our liking. Can't beat that! We initially planned on only ordering one, but he keeps the prices low enough where you'd be crazy not to try another variety. They are that good. We picked a cheese pizza and added fresh basil, and a white pizza. I'm a purist with pizza, so I went nuts for the former one -- it was incredibly light, flavorful, and the perfect mix of crispy and doughy. The white pizza was also wonderful, but I think we'll add sausage to it next time. I must admit, most of the second pizza was planned to be had for lunch the next day, but it didn't make it that long! Other reviews mention it is cash and carry-out only, but I believe it adds to the charm of the place -- you kind of have to seek it out, and if you like amazing pizza, this stuff is WORTH seeking out. Since it is a one-man operation for now, you can't hold the no delivery against him. I'm lucky enough to live down the street, so I will be pouring many more hard-earned dollars into this place.

I was so pleased with the whole experience that I stopped at the firehouse down the street on the walk home and told them to try it out ASAP :)",0.9962,0.783,0.189,0.029,0.4848131613756613
2012-07-16,5.0,"Best thin-crust I've had in Chicago. Pick-up only--no delivery--but absolutely worth dropping in. Only $14 for a whole pizza. It's a one-man operation, and very much worth supporting. You'll be hooked.",0.8945,0.68,0.32,0.0,0.35833333333333334

2012-07-06,5.0,"This place has the best thin crust pizza in Chicago.  Blows away anything I have had even in NYC.  The owner is very friendly and the pizza cooks in about 5 min. The cheese is perfect, the sauce is super delish, the crust is perfectly cracker style.  So you can order while you are there and be out the door. I wish my body could handle eating pizza everyday because i could eat this everyday.",0.9726,0.745,0.255,0.0,0.7083333333333333
2012-06-27,5.0,"I think I've finally found the place in Chicago that can give me that NYC style slice.  It's not too cheesy, it's greasy, it's thin, it's delish and it's cheap.  And best of all it feels like a NYC pizzeria. No bells and whistles just good plain tasty slices.   The owner/pizza maker is a super nice guy. Go check it out and support this welcome addition to the neighborhood.",0.9652,0.701,0.272,0.027,0.7373809523809524
2012-06-26,5.0,"Im very impressed with this simple yet delicious pizza. If you enjoy small business charm with big city taste, you have found your choice for dinner. Jay, the owner, is a great host and has a tremendous product. However, there is one caveat : the pizza is not for the health conscious. Its messy, greasy and 100% delicious.",0.9601,0.673,0.292,0.035,0.6370129870129871
2012-06-25,5.0,"FINALLY some thin crust pizza that doesn't tarnish the Chicago pizza reputation.  I know that the reputation is for deep dish/stuffed but it has been a exercise in futility to find decent thin crust in Lincoln Park/Old Town area.  This is the real deal with no bells and whistles.  The owner/chef/hostess/waiter picks up the phone, takes your order, makes it and collects your money (cash and pick-up only.)  The ingredients taste fresh and the crust is thin and crispy- perfect.",0.7351,0.874,0.093,0.033,0.7416666666666666

2012-06-20,5.0,"This pizza is incredible  - light crust and tastes amazing!  Jay, the owner, is incredibly friendly and has your pizza ready in no time (because the crust is so wonderfully thin!)  Can't recommend it enough although I hope the word doesnt get out too much as we like to have him all to ourselves...   6 out of 5 stars!!",0.9586,0.647,0.294,0.059,0.63125
