I've never had duck, but I would gladly return here for their duck. It was juicy, not too fatty and full of flavor. I had steak and it was just as good as the duck, but you can't get good duck breast everywhere.

Is there a new owner? How can a place go from the tops to the bottom so quickly.  The menu has been different the past 3 times I've been here. It's like as soon as I find a favorite new menu item, it's gone. And not just that, the quality of food and the service has gone down significantly. I was so disappointed in my omelet my last visit.The chef cooked the sausage, tomatoes and cheese together, then poured it into what can best be described as an egg taco - not fluffy, but more rubbery in texture. The cheese was melted (browning) to the sausage but not at all to the egg! It was heartbreaking for a cheese lover like me who was expecting melty goodness of a traditional omelette.  The entire atmosphere has also changed- with the installment of hightop shared tables. Forno, one of the best parts of your location are the giant windows overlooking 6 corners. Why on earth would you block that view with GIANT shared tables? I do not understand this decision at all. They take up a ton of space, block the windows and do people really enjoy sharing a table? I mean, really?? What happened to the cute, cozy and intimate feel you once had! Now, all of this being said, my boyfriend loved his breakfast hash. He's cool with anything meat and potatoes.

They had just changed the menu that day, and we were disappointed to find out that they trimmed it down to three pastas on the entire menu...at an ""Italian"" restaurant. My gf tried to order the oxtail pasta, but was informed that they have run out of it so she settle for the gnocchi which I ordered as well. This was about 7pm on a Friday night and it was not very busy. About 25 minutes go by and out waitress returns to inform us that they have also run out of gnocchi but can make the sauce with tagliatelle, a pasta that was not even on the menu. Fast forward 10 minutes and we finally got our burratta appetizer which was ok. Now about 60 minutes after we sat down, we still had no entree. You would think a restaurant would be overly apologetic and put some sort of emphasis on your order when they ran out of BOTH pastas you try and order, and are serving you a mashup of random ingredients anyways. We finally grabbed the manager as he walked by and asked for a status update. Our food came out five minutes later and it was extremely bland and the tagliatelle was rubber.  The service here was an absolute joke. Our server didn't have a clue what she was doing. She would walk up to our table, stand there like she's about to say Somethjng, then literally walk away. She would pace back and forth, stop at a table for a minute, pace back and forth some more, go back to the same table, pace back and forth again, and disappear all the while passing us by several times and not once checking in on us (again the customers whose two orders were run out of by 7pm on a Friday nights, I expected a sense of urgency to please us.) The manager did comp our appetizer, but I will never again go back here. I simply do not understand what kind of Italian restaurant has only three pastas on the menu and runs out of two of them early on.

I also got their bloody mary, which used to be full of spices and had a good kick, as well as a little beer-back.  No more beer, no more flavor.  You could see just looking at the glass that it was super watered down, and my alcoholic self had trouble chocking down the one I ordered, where I normally guzzle down two, no problem.   I think they made a big mistake changing the menu at all in the interim of reconcepting.  It gave me something to compare it to, and the comparison is that there isn't one.  They used to be full of flavor and deliciousness and now, I really can't see myself going back.  I may be the duchess for now, but my estate is officially on the market.   The stars it gets is for ambiance and service.  R.I.P.

That being said, the food was delicious.  I won the best ordering award with the Arancini Benedict - crispy risotto cakes, prosciutto, poached eggs, hollandaise, and a side of yummy breakfast potatoes.  My boyfriend ordered Baked Egg Florentina with a side of sausage which was also good.   Two breakfast entrees + two coffees was around $35.  Moral of the story is to make reservations or be ready to make some new friends.",0.9933,0.758,0.188,0.054,0.5215993265993267

The beer selection and wine selection is good. We started with a few appetizers that came out quickly. They have a lot of different pasta's and everyones looked delicious. Some orders were smaller than the others but they were prepared hot and were served quickly.  I think they also have a doughnut bar towards the end of the restaurant which serve doughnuts for 2.00 a piece and I heard this is a great stop for brunch as well.

It was Brunch time, and were we ever ready for it. I ordered the Eggs Sardou - a variation of eggs benny. instead of english muffins, the base of the benny was grilled artichoke hearts, topped with spinach, and perfectly poached eggs on top and I got the hollandaise sauce on the side. What a combination! It made for a nice lighter version of the traditional benedict. The flavours were perfection! It came with a side of their cripsy breakfast potatoes- which where DIVINE! It had a bit of a kick to them - I think it's jalapenos thrown in there. But best breakfast potatoes I have ever had!  I also had the garden margarita. It was more of a savory drink - I thought it tasted like a stronger (tequila based) caesar and but less salty. It had Jalapeno Infused tequila, strawberry and basil.  My friends had ordered the arancini benedict, The arancini was the base of the benedict cripsy and so cheesey! It was a really heavy dish. But oh so tasty! So rich- so good!  My other friend had ordered the french toast it had a bit of a citrus kick to it, and was topped with peaches.

The waitresses were switching off with each other assuming hosting duties- a mess. After ten minutes we received our first appearance from our server. Coffee served, orders placed.  And then we waited. Waited for our refills of coffee. Waited for our food. And might I add, waited for our food while we watched it sit under the heat lamps for TEN minutes located directly to our left. When our waitress strolled by to grab the food from under the heat lamps, she dropped it off without saying a word, about to leave the area before we spoke up asking for refills of our drinks. I actually got up three separate times, walked over to the coffee station, and refilled my drinks myself without anyone taking notice. The place was not overly busy, and there were multiple servers working, but I witnessed only one displaying any kind of hustle. You don't need to run around like something's burning, but at least move at an effective pace. If the place actually did catch fire, I'd likely be faster to the extinguisher than the staff.

I love the atmosphere and since their remodel the place looks gorgeous.  I have always had great customer service every time I have gone to eat at Frencesca's Forno.  They have a great selection of wine and I always enjoy their pastas.   The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because of the rotating menu.  I really wish they would keep some of the same pastas around.  I went there recently for Valentine's Day and had been craving a pasta I had there a few times before.  I was looking forward to it all day and then when we got there, it wasn't on the menu anymore.  Now, I'm not saying the pasta that I ended up getting wasn't good.  It just wasn't AS good as the one I was looking forward too.

The restaurant was about half full so we had no problem getting a table. Upon being seated, Aidan L. was staring (like really staring, so embarrassing) at the table next to ours where a gentleman had just received a very large man-breakfast. We deduced from the menu that this gargantuan plate was the Tomato Braised Pork Hash. He proceeded to order this and was a very happy camper. The pork shoulder shoulder was seasoned wonderfully and there were tons of veggies and eggs to accompany it.  Always a fan of breakfast sandwiches, I had the Monte Cristo. It was very flavorful, but small in size and the ""spicy"" tomato jam that came on the side was actually very sweet. Had to add some Cholula. Needing something sweet to go with our savory breakfasts, we shared the blueberry-ricotta-lemon pancakes which were so phenomenal. Light, tasty, filled with blueberries, these were the best pancakes I had consumed in a REAL long time.  They also served Intelligentsia coffee which makes me sooo happy.

We decided to get the Amaretto Soaked French Toast and Arancini Benedict. Sounds amazing right?? Meh. That's how I felt. Disappointing.

We didn't order off of the wine menu and that may have been a mistake.  My man ordered the Proper Negroni which had a decent composition but it was served on the rocks.  A negroni should be served up or notated otherwise.  My fancy ass ordered a Little Sumpin' Sumpin'. For our meals, I ordered the Capatelli + Mozzarella and my man ordered the Cappa + Egg (sub sausage rather than Cappa).  They were pretty awesome about the substitution and my boyfriend said it was great.  There really was nothing too special about the Capatelli, but I can say that it was the perfect portion amount.

Once seated our server disappered for a good 5minutes then came back to take our drink and food order.

Anyway- I got my hot water/tea right away however no one was served their coffee/latte's until their meal was served. Really? Also forgot two orders of bacon and at that point we just said ""forget it"". I ordered the Monte Cristo. My meal was probably the most depressing meal ever served at a brunch. I wanted substance and this was far from it. Even the presentation looked sad. One little mcmuffin sandwich with probably 6-8 potatoes.  I highly suggest ordering the BYO omelettes, everyone seemed to have enjoyed theirs.  bottom line- maybe it's good for lunch/dinner but I will never want to go back there solely on my brunch experience.

I ordered some chicken wings and a Negroni up, and my coworker ordered a beer and burger. Everything arrived very quickly, with our drinks coming first. The first thing I noticed was that there was ice in my drink, so I guess the waiter didn't know what a drink served ""up"" means (shaken/stirred on ice, strained and served without), but that's not a huge deal since he wasn't the bartender and Negronis are traditionally served on the rocks anyways. The chicken wings were decent, not spectacular, but they were surprisingly filling for chicken wings, which are usually more of an appetizer than a meal.  People watching from Francesca's is fun since the windows are huge and the North/Damen/Milwaukee intersection experiences heavy foot (and other) traffic.

Menu: it was tough to pick from all the goodies!  We'll definitely come back to try more.  I spent ten minutes picking out our order, and then when boy came and joined me they handed us the special brunch menu, and we had to start all over.  Ordered one of the specials, eggs sarnou, and a frittata with prosciutto, fresh mozzarella, and basil in it.  Both came with their HOLY POTATOES BATMAN these potatoes are amazing!  They're smashed, flash-fried, and dusted with deliciousness.  So so good. Both of our dishes were incredibly solid.  Loved that the eggs sarnou came on artichoke bottoms instead of an english muffin: it was eggs florentine (eggs benedict with spinach instead of ham), but done so well and so interestingly.  They didn't cheat and just cover everything in a heavy sauce of wonder, aka egg yolk and melted butter, but used the hollandaise as you should: to enhance the meal rather than overpower it.  It was beautiful with the artichoke and well-poached egg, which was neither too runny nor too done. The frittata had great moments, when the juicy mozzarella melted so well with the egg and basil and prosciutto, but there was just too much egg on the edges with nothing going on in them.  It's like when you're at home making your sandwich, and then realize that you've got  huge swathes of bread territory unclaimed by other foods.  And instead of fixing it, you just eat those big pieces of bread.  Only instead of bread, it's egg.  This was the ONLY low point of our meal.

What better place to go for some good Italian (real) pizza. We started with the Bruschetta, which I was not very happy with. The flavors were...exotic. Fennel, goat cheese, and some sort of salami? Interesting. But the flavors all mixed together and left a not so pleasant taste in my mouth that would not go away. Bummer. A few tomatoes or some balsalmic would've been awesome. Don't fix what isn't broken! We shared the #1 pizza but added prosciutto on half. I swear there was a whole pig on our pizza! Great if you love prosciutto. The pizza was good, average. The dough tasted a little...yeasty. It had an odd taste to it, like it needed to be cooked a bit more. But the crispy parts were great! The tomatoes and cheese was delicious. The herbal butter for the bread was very good. Honestly, my favorite part of the meal since the bruschetta's flavors overpowered the pizza.  Honestly, I'll probably be back to try something else.

But on to the food - we shared the roasted Brussels sprouts and cauliflower, meatball sliders, salami bruschetta and ribs and mac.  The sprouts/cauliflower was outstanding, super unique and flavorful, as was the bruschetta.  The meatball sliders were pretty standard, and the only item I wouldn't necessarily get again.  And the ribs and mac....holy crap.  It's deep fried ribs!  What!?  SOOOO good.  The mac is just ok, so don't get the side dish mac, go for the entree ribs and mac for sure!  Worth every penny!",0.9603,0.81,0.13,0.06,0.5966202233980012

It happened to be an executive decision as we had originally planned to dine at Papajin's down the street before hitting up Emporium Arcade Bar. However Papajin's was practically empty on a Saturday night during dinner time with only 3 tables seated. A bad sign in my book.   Especially with groups of people loading up on grub at surrounding establishments before heading off to their Halloween parties. My girl told me people usually order take-out from Papajin's and that's possibly why it's so empty. Plus it was a cold night, so we wanted something hearty. To be honest, I lived in Wicker Park a couple years back, off of the Damen blue line stop, so I always passed by this place, but never ventured in. From the outside, it looked too pricey and fancy for me. Once we stepped in the door though, that preconceived notion was shattered. Instead we were met with a really hip and fun vibe. It was busy and bustling as always. The staff seemed vibrant. Some of them were dressed up for Halloween.We had a 20-minute wait that didn't seem that long while we were waiting at the bar perusing the drink menu and watching the football and baseball games. Our waitress was very chill and helpful. She suggested the Coppa+Egg, which I ordered. My girl got the Mascarpone.

I was rewarded handsomely with a giant plate of everything delicious that you'd find on a fine antipasto platter, all chopped up with lettuce and a creamy parmesan dressing. Heather - 1, Diet - 0. I highly recommend this salad. Each bite was a delight of flavor and variety.  Otherwise, meatball sliders, awesome, pizza awesome, cocktail list fun.

My recent trip for dinner however was not impressive... I had the Chicken Saltimbocca which was nothing like I had imagined it would be. The chicken came out bone on... which usually is ok as long as the chicken is slow roasted and the meat falls off; however, that was not the case.

I had come back another couple times, ranging from fall to spring, hoping the menu had changed or increased, but it never did. Don't menus change for the season?? So disappointing!  I think they also changed the bruschetta, or ran out and impromptu made us some that was no where near as good as I had once recalled. (The tomatoes didn't have that marinated taste, just oily).

We decided to share a sandwich and left it up to our very personable and capable  server, great choice in hindsight....I was looking more at the Italian Cubano, she was eying the Prime Aged Burger w.

Big-time flake, and didn't seem to have the ""timing"" down that's necessary for a server, though the place was not crowded (i.e., wasn't like he was juggling 20 tables or anything.)

Friend: "" I ordered with the busboy but it hasn't come yet."" Waiter: ""Oh I'll see about that."" (wanders off; eventually returns) ""Anything else?"" Me: ""Well, I'd like to get some lemon for my water, but also..."" Him: ""Oh, okay."" (wanders off again) Me (to his back): ""...we're ready to order now..."" etc.  - you get a carafe of water at the table, but it was room temperature and smelled, uh, funky. Couldn't get the waiter's attention to ask for ice, finally stopped trying.  - Speaking of funky smells, the ladies' room had that smell that says ""we have old weird plumbing but we don't really care"" - also, my pancakes came with a small cup of maple syrup with a jaunty strand of someone's hair poking out (not mine, and not the curly-haired busser). Eeek. I called attention to that IMMEDIATELY.  There are a couple of Francesca's locations out in Naperville, where I live, and I've been to one some time ago and never felt the need to go back.

They now have this gigantic bar that takes up half the space reserved for tables, so as we sat down to eat, we were right next to extremely loud trying to hard girls drinking. It wasn't exactly a pleasing experience. And like I said, too many people are working there. Someone brought us drinks, then we had our waiter, then we had the busboy, then we had the assistant to busboy, and they the host, all walking back and forth in the aisles that can't fit more than one person at a time.

And as the bus boy pulled away the plate as soon as were done, the liquid from it spilled onto my jacket, and he didn't even notice.

2012-01-16,3.0,"I came here several times before they changed the menu and the layout and thought it was a pretty solid Italian restaurant. However, when I returned for the first time since the changes, my opinion became a bit more negative.  For starters, the layout is very awkward now. The bar area used to be sort of off to the side and now it's in the main dining area. Since this is where people wait for tables to become available, it feels extremely cramped around that area. In addition, there are small tables where people stand and wait that are farther out from the bar basically in the dining area. One of these tables was right behind us and it felt very claustrophobic while we were eating to have people basically hovering over us. This restaurant also gets extremely loud as it fills up. It's one thing to have noise from people talking, but to have blaring music on top of that just seems unnecessary. As for the food, I seem to recall that before the makeover, the menu was much more extensive, but maybe I'm imagining that. We started off with the bruschetta, which was amazing--probably the best part of the meal. For my main course, I had the monkfish with linguine. The fish itself was fine, but I wasn't a huge fan of the pasta--something about the sauce didn't really complement the fish all that well. I will probably come back here at some point, but I will try to come at an off time to avoid a crowd.",0.5455,0.899,0.057,0.044,0.4978479853479855

At that point, I definitely would have given 2 stars. Unfortunately, all the work they did only makes me want to add one more star to that.  The decor is nice. Kind of American-Italian night-clubby dinner spot. The music was loud and distracting, and inappropriate for the setting. I found it weird to listen to rap music while slurping my pasta in what I think is supposed to be a somewhat rustic Italian space. The service was good, but not super. We had a party of 4, and our dishes didn't come out together. With each course, one person waited while the other three stared at their food. As a matter of fact, I'm pretty sure my entree got screwed up in the kitchen and they had to re-fire it. I guess I'm glad they noticed before they brought it out, but they had already delivered everyone else's plates.  The food is also good, but not spectacular. Both the kid and I had the beet salad to start, and we agreed that it tasted great when we first started eating, but the more we ate, the less we liked it. I did like my pasta, though. I got the Mushroom & Mascarpone, which is made with spaghetti. I asked them to make it with a plain red sauce instead of the brandy-veal sauce listed on the menu, which is what I am sure necessitated the re-fire. I will admit that it was actually very delicious, and I took home what I didn't eat for my lunch the next day. We didn't even look at the dessert menu.

Nothing about the dining experience stood out for me, their service while friendly was not all that great, our server was being trained (shadowed by her manager I presume) so I don't take any marks away from here for not being familiar enough with the menu to give us her personal take on things, she did a good overall job but small things that should have been done right such as taking our drink orders without much delay and in turn not taking a long time for a glass of wine to appear by me, and how the very stale and cold our bread basket was.  Sure complaining about free bread seems a little unjust but they could have at least warmed them up a bit. Being filled with cheese was also a little unnecessary, what's wrong with giving us the option of adding just butter on them?  I ordered the risotto and it came in a large more thick than creamy portion which while OK was not great. I think I feel a little put off by Forno's as it looks like it's a better place than it is, walking in the interior lacks charm and did seem very ""chain restaurant"" ish. I must admit that my two dining companions didn't seem to mind their dishes too much, so I suppose it's just my bad luck that I didn't love my risotto and I probably had higher expectations for Forno hence leaving it more room to disappoint me.

I could understand sitting with others if I was with a friend but  I was on a date and I wasn't feeling that. Unfortunately after we declined to sit there we waited another 30 minutes without any communication from the hostess. They did try to make up for the lack of communication with a tasty appetizer, but it sort of ruined the night. Overall the feel of the restaurant was very different, and I have agree that the high oval tables were people stand are awkward. The menu was very limited and not what I was expecting.  Service was good, portions were small. Probably wont go back.",0.2935,0.807,0.1,0.093,0.5506412337662339

I really like the new layout and decor of the place. I think they did a really nice job!  The food we had was really amazing and the wine list is very reasonably priced! I don't think there is a bottle over $60? We had 2 of the specials, a procuitto app and a pasta entree as well as the lamb meatballs. Yum all around. Our table was slightly uneven and the wine bottle kept sliding towards me, but hey I can't complain about that, haha. Anyway, we would definitely be back! Since we live so close probably during the week when it is a little less crowded, but worth the wait!

We were given a small table near the windows, which had been opened for the beautiful weather. I was seated in the aisle and had to cram toward my friend because the host and busboys kept hitting my chair. Our server was clear and answered all our questions about the exciting menu, which had intriguing ingredients but was more vague about portion size and presentation. We didn't mind - we tried dishes that sounded unfamiliar and enjoyed all three, from the hen egg to the potatoes dish (our server's favorite). Our wine was delicious, but upon bringing it to the table, I noticed that the vintage was incorrect. I had picked it because it was a good value for an older wine, only to find that our bottle was two years younger. Though disappointed (as a wine fan, I like restaurants to keep updated wine lists!) and wishing for something with more body and weight, we enjoyed the wine. It was soft and went with everything, as we were promised. Overall, a very fun place to visit. Creative menu, trendy atmosphere, excellent design - dark colors, but well-lit.

2011-09-14,2.0,"What in gay hell has happened to this place? It's a shame that I have to sit here and echo what everyone else is saying: that I remember so many good times here in this old go-to Italian spot.  So many great breakfasts with out of town visitors in the sunny, cozy dining room.  And don't even ask me how many times I came here with my best friend at like 10:00 at night just to order 3 desserts and 2 spoons...quite the lady nightcap if I do say so myself (and I do). So now where that long wall with the bench seating used to be, there's this big light-up bar, and even though they're playing Radiohead at a reasonable volume in there, you can't help but hear UNTS UNTS UNTS UNTS in your head because it's glowing in there like the backdrop at a Vanilla Ice concert.  Just weird, weird ambiance.  Then the server comes over and he is neither a cute girl OR the guy who used to work there who looks like Jack Black.  (And if you're a returning, pre-renovation patron, you panic for a second like ""Oh my God WHAT HAVE THEY DONE WITH JACK BLACK WAITER?!?!""  But relax, he's okay, he works at Longman & Eagle now.  However, I don't think the pretty waitresses fared so well...they were unfortunately sucked into the vortex that ripped through the middle of the 6 corners when this place re-opened and channeled another dimension because of the overflow of douche energy between two commercial banks, a Starbucks, and some horrible place called ""Cafe Absinthe.""  For more information on this phenomenon, please see A Brief History of Time by Stephen Hawking, Chapter 17: Douche Vortex.) Anyway, so the server is wearing a band t-shirt and is just a super nice guy who's just coolin out and doin whatever and if he happens to be walking by your table he'll stop and say wassup.  He stopped and told us ""how this menu works,"" which made me laugh because I thought he meant how to unfold & read it.  NO.  He meant that the foods were SO special and SO precious that there was a certain way to order them!  ""These are all small plates, 'kay?  Which you may not be used to.  It's def less food than you're used to.""  Translation: that means it's more special!!!  Definitely too special to just say ""small plates to share"" or ""tapas.""  You wouldn't understand, nevermind.  You're not used to anything this special.  Dummies! He went on to recommend a few appetizers.  He mentioned that his favorite was this thing with watermelon in it.  That's what he said: ""This one's my favorite, it's got watermelon in it.""  Call me stupid, I didn't realize that when waiters in places like this, where the menu comes with instructions, recommend things to you, it means that it hasn't been selling well.  Also, when Brad Chad the Waistaff Wonder says ""watermelon IN it,"" he means that what you're ordering is a midsection slice of watermelon, cut into pizza triangles, dotted with cheese, mint leaves, balsamic vinegar, and of all other things under the sun, chopped olive thingies.  God, it was horrible.  It was like someone took a big dirty shit on the flavors of summertime.  ""It's not for everyone!"" Brad Chad joked when he cleared it from our table after we each took a single bite.  Well, thanks for telling us that when you recommended it to us, Chadders.  High five brah. The whole menu was like that.  It's like they took a few months off, got really stoned, and wrote the menu.  ""Know what would be goooood?  If we took like, watermelon??  No, hear me out!  Dude!  Dude!  So we take watermelon and cheese..."" One in our party ordered the mushroom spaghetti and said it was good.  My other companion ordered the trout with potatoes.  The fish looked leathery, so I tried one of the potatoes and it was grease-soaked and salty.  I ordered the beet salad and it was just weird and over-beety, giant choke-sized chunks of beets.  But they put it on a cute oddly-shaped plate and put all kinds of weird shit on it, like bite-size bits of honeycomb, so, you know, it was totally gourmet.  I also got the spinach and ricotta dumplings and they were just little flour-flavored pasta balls drowning in half a cup of grease, some kind of brown chunks at the bottom of the bowl, and Ragu on top.  This tiny bowl cost me $12.  For that amount, you can get a dish the size of a Ford Festiva and a kiss on the forehead at places like Buona Terra. Am I being too harsh?  If you're a prior-to-renovation patron, you'll think I'm not being harsh enough.  If you've never been there and you like to eat overpriced, crappy mixtures of weird foods with fancy sounding names, knock yourself out, you're going to love it.  As for me, I won't be back, not even to try their modern take on breakfast, because the morning is the worst time to be sad and disappointed.",0.9932,0.721,0.163,0.116,0.5689210367691381

Raised my rating to 4 stars. Formerly a semi-fine dining establishment, this place closed, re-opened with windows that roll back to admit the outdoors, and became a loud, very casual italian joint.  Though the food is still very good, the atmosphere will disappoint those used to Francesca's before summer 2011.  Our evening was marked by an offensively loud group at the bar (who it appeared had been served way too much by a bartender who was a friend. I assume a discount was involved, as it would rack up quite a bill to be that sloppy drunk at this place's prices).  Shouting and falling all over your friends while barely balancing on your chair is not my idea of good restaurant behavior.  And that's an indication of the kind of crowd Francesca's now invites.  Fashionably disheveled twenty-somethings who do not bother to remove their Bieber-billed hats regardless of their dates' cute dress added to the disillusionment. For those who enjoyed Francesca's of the past, the food quality will not disappoint (and even seems a bit lower priced).  Several of the cheeses for starters were awesome, and our server was fantastic, offering honest suggestions and prompt attention.  In fact, service overall was very good - the behavior of the staff stood in contrast to the clientele in general.   Final Answer: Though I may be back I'll never bother to put on decent clothes to come here again.  Come for the food (and in the summer the open air) but don't book this place for your anniversary  or other quiet special occasions.",0.9903,0.761,0.172,0.067,0.5215934065934066

Drinks:  Probably the only thing saving this place was a very friendly bartender who knew how to pour a decent drink. Dinner:  Mushroom spaghetti dish was flavorful, but nothing you couldn't make in your own kitchen in about 30 minutes.  Not really worth going out and paying for.  Fire-roasted chicken was actually pretty good, but the vegetables that it came with were disgusting - not ripe, burnt, poorly cooked.  Plus the whole thing was floating in this sauce that tasted like pure salt.

LOVED going here and was so addicted to their Caprese Salad (simple yet delicious, and could never replicate the same goodness at home or elsewhere) that we used to stop by and order takeout at least once a week. Old Francesca's was a neighborhood staple with decent portions, wonderful food, and reasonable prices. Called to order take-out after they reopened. Of course, none of my old favorites were on the new menu. Menu is not posted online anywhere. So, no take out order from us. Fast forward to last Friday when we decided to dine there with friends. Was quoted 30-45 minute wait which ended up being slightly over an hour. They encouraged us to order drinks/food at one of the floating bar tables near the bar while we waited. Bar service was pretty awful, the server was obviously busy and had too many tables. 4 of us ordered some drinks and 2 small appetizers. $70 later and we were off to our table.  **A note on the tables - with the renovation they have expanded the bar area and limited the entire back area to 6 person high tops. They seat multiple parties at these tables and it just feels awkward. I'm all about community/sharing tables at other restaurants around town, but those tables are generally bigger (8, 10, 20, etc). Not 6 tops. The 4 of us were seated with another couple. It was pretty cramped. Not a fan. ** After waiting nearly an hour and ordering a bottle of wine, the server informed us they were too busy to prepare any of the pasta or meat dishes, so they were only serving appetizers, salads, and pizzas. Um, ok. That would have been nice to know before we waited an hour! On a side note you think they could have brought us a round of drinks or discounted our bill for this, but no. The chef did send over a small appetizer of veal meatballs...  We ordered a huge cheese platter and we received 4 pieces of bread/toast for 4 people. Seemed pretty skimpy. They also used to serve delicious breads, butter, olive oil and that's gone. No more yummy bread. The 4 of us ordered 3 more pizzas and another bottle of wine (racking up quite a bill). Pizzas arrived and they were pretty good, not sure they were worth the price or waiting so long for though.  If you are looking for the delicious food of an old neighborhood favorite, think again.

I had the eggs benedict with pesto & prosciutto; my husband had the steak & eggs. Everything was perfectly prepared & tasty. The fried potatoes we both got with our eggs were really nice & crispy without a hint of grease...only minor criticism is that we thought the pecorino truffle fries would have been a better complement to his steak than plain hashed browns - we'll ask them to substitute next time. The bloody marys were great - spicy with a beer back & in my opinion a great deal ($6 for a pint glass sized cocktail). We were seated as soon as we walked in the door.

It had been a few years since my last visit and it's nice to see that the food and quality hadn't changed much. Francesca's Forno is the 15th and newest member of the franchise and features ""small plate dining, which encourages sampling"" as their website states.

This location features  a wood burning oven (yes!) and glass encased antipasto bar and I think, fits very well in this artistic community. We went here for a large birthday party and it was such the perfect choice for a group. Everyone ordered something different off the menu and from what I could see, licked their plates clean.  My boyfriend and I shared a bowl of minestroni soup and an OMG deliciously prepared pear-prosciutto-gorgonzola-arugula appetizer which was the perfect combination of salty and sweet. A must order!

The sausage was spicy and added just enough kick to give this dish something really special. I will order it again the next time I'm here. Also, they had some of the best bloody marys I've ever had. They are super spicy but they give you a little glass of beer to help you wash it down if you happen to choke on a red pepper flake or something.

The shrimp were delicious and the scallops were melt in your mouth good. I guess someone paid attention in cooking school on how to cook a scallop. My wife had tilapia which she thought was pretty good, although I am not crazy about that particular fish. Now, for chocolate lovers here it comes: Torta Lava. This was my dessert: a flourless chocolate cake with a liquid chocolate center, a scoop of vanilla gelato on top in a raspberry sauce. This is definitely a dessert to be savored.

We started off a friend's birthday night with reservations at 8:45. We were told, ""Your table will be ready in less than 5 minutes.""  There was no room at the bar to hang out while we waited, so we had to stand in the back near the bathrooms...for 20 minutes. That's ok, I was in good company. Once we got to our table, we got baskets of bread and garlic butter, which was amazing. It took another 15-20 minutes for our waiter to come by to finally take our order. After polishing off a basket of bread, we asked for another, which our waiter said he'd get right away. The bread never showed up. One of my fellow diners dropped her fork on the floor and asked for another. The waiter said he'd bring one back right away. He never did. When the food arrived, she still did not have a fork. I ordered the Carpanelle con Pollo, which was described as pasta and chicken with sun-dried tomatoes, peas, and a creamy parmesan sauce. My meal was ""just OK,"" however it was very large portions. The sun-dried tomatoes weren't. I had two or three large chunks of cooked tomato mingling with the pasta. Someone else at the table who'd ordered the same dish complained that she only had two or three small pieces of chicken in her pasta. The pasta was warm when it came to us, but not hot. While we waited for the check, several of us had put on coats because it became uncomfortably cold (and we were nowhere near the door).

For my meal, I got the Garlic Toast e Cerfoglio which is Italian garlic toast topped with a poached egg, prosciutto, tomatoes, watercress & olive oil. It was very good! She got the Italian BLT which looked very delicious. I tasted the fries that came with her meal and they were damn good.

Our waitress was nice enough to bring me a complimentary one and it was SPICY! Spicy but good!!!

I ordered the salmon with asparagus and unfortunately the salmon wasn't that good, it tasted like it had been frozen not fresh and when you cook frozen fish, it just kind of falls apart and doesn't taste right. I should have known better than to order fish, although my friends ordered the tilapia and were happy with it. What I should have ordered was the spinach-filled pasta because that was excellent!

The servers were great and not pushy.  The noise level was low so we could talk comfortably.  And then what a great view of the neighborhood while you eat.  Next time I will try a different dish just to make sure i wasn't lulled into writing such a good review by the two dishes i tasted.  I imagine though that the rest of the menu is equally good.   Can't wait for my next meal there.",0.9951,0.711,0.218,0.071,0.5509112286890064

The only thing I do NOT love is the wait.  We made reservations (for my birthday!) for 8pm, we didn't get seated until 8:45!  After nicely complaining about 5 times, the waitress said the manager was going to provide us with free appetizers, they brought out 3 kinds.  In terms of apps, nothing was too spectacular. I always get a pasta dish and am never unhappy.  Portions are good, but not so big that I feel wasteful leaving a few bites.  Last time I got a pasta dish with seafood - very good.   The manager also said we'd get free dessert, so we got 3 of them.  All were very good, my fav was the brownie with vanilla ice cream (no one ever does this dessert wrong).  After all the discounts, our meal was quite reasonable :)  I suggest if it ever takes more than 20 minutes for your seat, make sure to complain so you get something comped.",0.9893,0.751,0.226,0.024,0.681111111111111

Last night we had a party of 6 and sat at the corner table where the two windows come together which made it feel like we were sitting right on the street. Great people watching, really fun.

After reading some YELP reviews yesterday I ended up ordering a couple of highly recommened dishes and wasn't disappointed! The asapragus/egg/truffle salad was mouth-watering and the seafood pasta was packed with shrimp and scallops. I couldn't even eat half, it was so big. It'll be a nice late snack for tonight.

The atmosphere was cool - kind of rustic Italian with a really good contemporary music selection. Unfortunately, the chairs were totally uncomfortable and the tables were arranged in such an odd pattern that I ended up with the girl behind me banging her chair into mine constantly. Not awesome. As for the food....let me start by saying I'm a commercial Italian food nazi. It's true. So, by the look of the menu, I liked that it seemed like they were doing REAL traditional Italian dishes - not Americanized crap. The server was very accommodating. He helped us pick good wine pairings and was knowledgeable about each wine and each dish. He helped me decide on the daily special of beef ravioli with marrow and a brown butter sauce. And because I really wanted the campanelle (because it had peas in it) - he had them add peas to my ravioli! He was great. The ravioli were delicious, and my companions each had two salads that were really yummy (the squid salad and the watercress/pear/pine nuts/goat cheese). Unfortunately I thought their rigatoni was bland and boring. Overall the seating arrangements could use some work. The bar looked interesting, but unfortunately I did not get to check it out. The food is really good, generally. Of the four dishes we ordered, only one was a thumbs down (to me, it should be noted - both of my companions enjoyed what they had). Those are pretty decent odds. I think if I go back, I would do more of an Italian tapas style meal with carpaccio and some of the salumi/formaggi dishes/salads.

Business was winding down when I arrived but I could see it had been a madhouse.  The problem was there was only one server and he apparently was overwhelmed by the time I arrived starving. I'm very easy going and considerate with waiters because I've worked in the service industry; but...I got the Eye-Roll treatment and a rude and short answer when I quickly asked what the salad was like that came with the paninis.  A good surprise was that it was Romaine lettuce, not iceberg as I was told. It also had crispy carrots, tomatoes and cukes. The caprese panini was tasty and so was the salad and a large portion too. Alas, I knew I couldn't take it home because my waiter never checked back with me about the food and basically vanished until I stood up to get my bill so I could get back to work. I couldn't help but think that he figured a single diner wasn't worth his time because he chatted up the 3-tops at the expense of basic courtesy towards me.

Maybe I was ravenous but after I devoured the whole thing I looked at my brunch buddy and said, ""I think I'm still hungry"" and she, after her steak and eggs, said the same thing.

The space itself was interesting.  Not exactly cozy and almost spartan with its loft/industrial/exposed pipes and high ceilings look, but maybe I was just cold -- I think I wore my scarf throughout dinner and had my coat draped over my legs.  The restaurant is on the corner of a busy intersection and has 2 walls of windows which would make for great people watching.  I guess it's kind of romantic too being all dimly lit with candles (I think?), although I was confused to hear Everclear circa 1994 was setting the mood.   I gave into a craving for risotto, disregarding my better judgment for what's usually soggy, flat, flavored rice, and was impressed (even 3 months later) by perfectly cooked arborio with just the right balance of cheese, wine, and stock.  Also, the sausage in the risotto kicked ass!  We also ordered the bacon-wrapped pork tenderloin which reaffirmed for me that anything wrapped in bacon is going to taste awesome.  The portions were generous and we ended up taking almost half of our meal home.   Unexpected bonus: 1/2 price bottles of wine (Tuesday?)

The goat cheese and crostini appetizer, is really good, but really standard. Cafe Ba Ba Reeba has it, among other places. I guess there is not much you can do with it to change it up. The only thing about it was they gave you four pieces of crostinin with it. Really? Because figure at least two people are ordering this as an appetizer...so two pieces to devour a huge hunk of goat cheese and tomato sauce? The bus boy was on to us and brought more bread over; nice considering our server was M.I.A for the entire time we were there. The insalata con uova (Italian for egg) was hands down, the best salad I have ever had in my life. Argula, lemon-oil vinegarette, light parmesan shavings, grilled asparagus and a fried egg.  I must have looked like I was eating my last meal to the surronding tables, because I inhaled this salad. It was freakin awesome. My other two gal pals completely agreed. I mean, wow. Still thinking about it two days later... I ordered the rigatoni something, pretty good. Nothing to go on about, but it was good. They were nice about the sans meat substitution, which is always appreciated. The torta lava and the tiramisu were both fantastic as well; this place just all-around has great food. Our server? In a word, absent. He was very attentive to his other tables, but seemed to have a sight problem, because he would rush past our table without stopping.

While there was nothing really wrong with the restaurant, I don't quite feel like it deserves to be a part of the Francesca's family.  Here is my main problem: Francesca's restaurants update their menus almost daily. Forno uses same menu all the time. What this means - The chefs at Forno are not using the best ingredients available depending on the season. This is a REALLY BIG DEAL to me. So big I felt the need to capitalize. The reason I love Francesca's is that they always make the best meals with the best options given the time of year. I have never, ever had a bad meal at a Francesca's restaurant. Never. This is why my mediocre pasta at Forno the other night really let me down.  The waiter was great, the bread was amazingly fresh, and the atmosphere was warm and lively.

He was very nice and joked around a good deal with us. We started off with their fried calamari, it was very lightly battered with a graham cracker crust. It wasn't greasy and you could just get a hint of the cracker in it, probably some of the best fried calamari I've had. Our eyes were probably much larger than they should have been. We ordered spaghetti al funghetto, bianca pizza, and the linguini con frutti di mare, a few sides of funghi trifolati and patate alla calabrese. The portions weren't too large, which was a relief. They also sauced it the pasta in a more traditional manner, which is to lightly coat the pasta and not overwhelm it, thank you!  My spaghetti with mushrooms was awesome, it was bursting with flavor and the white truffle oil helped the mushrooms and mascarpone reach their full potential.

2008-05-13,3.0,"I like the Francesca's Family of restaurants.... especially Francesca's Amici and Mia Francesca. I pretty much knew what to expect when going for lunch last week at Francesca's Forno for the first time. The menus for all of the locations vary slightly, but you can always count on solid Italian basics; pastas, pizzas, calamari, gnocci, several fresh fish options and salads for the herbivores.  The decor was spot on in traditional Francesca's style with a bit of a rustic twist... warm woods, colorful Italian style - you know the drill...  A slight nuance however at this location was the butter served with that warm, crusty bread. It was heavily combined with garlic, parsley and chives and so very good that even my iron clad willpower was defenseless to it's temptations. Slather me up and call me silly, I'm Miss Garlic Butter USA.   I managed to avoid the carb caboose and stick to some nice greens for a light lunch. I chose the Insalata Con Uova. With baby greens, grilled asparagus, fried egg (I know, enough with the redundant runny eggs already), lemon vinaigrette and truffle oil; it made my mouth water just reading it off the menu. The salad did not disappoint and was delicious; tangy, savory and salty all at once. More than I could ask for... well, technically more would have been alright by me. Either I was especially hungry that day or the salad was not nearly enough for an entree size portion, I polished off the entire plate (which I rarely do) and was still wanting more.

I don't remember having a single bad dish, which is pretty impressive for a small plates concept. It's hard to stand out as an Italian restaurant, but there's some original dishes on the menu, and everything is done well. Brunch here has been a recent revelation. It's one of the rare places you can just walk into and get a table without waiting. The food is good, and there's even some lighter things on the menu (the girlfriend has gone with granola and yogurt both times we've been here-- sacrilege at a place that serves eggs and pancakes-- but it was pretty good). The room can get very, very noisy, but one big plus is the massive windows. From pretty much anywhere in the restaurant, you can watch the current mix of lonely goth, stubborn hipsters and trixies trying to ""slum it"" that currently parades around Wicker Park while you eat your dinner.",0.8419,0.816,0.114,0.071,0.5767913832199546

In fact, I went in a group of five, and no one was overly impressed with their meals at all. Two of us got the ""naked ravioli"" which is supposed to be a menu speciality--it was just okay.

Ok - the foods. My granola/yogurt/fruit dish was perfect, just what I wanted. For those more eager to fill their stomachs, the french toast and the egg polenta dish with some sort of meat and tomato sauce were the big winners.

We really like Francesca's Forno and typically come for dinner about once a month.  There are not a whole lot of surprises on the menu, but the food is good, the portions are normal-sized (i.e. this is not the place for you if you want a bucket of pasta) and therefore the prices are reasonable.  Pretty decent wine list.

(Unless bread is a traditional Italian after dinner mint?)  Every time she did show herself she kept asking where she knew me from. Its possible that she eventually remembered where she knew me from, decided she hated me and took it out on me by ignoring me. Whatever.

I have gone with friends several times now and have always been blown away by the appetizers (last night we had a cheese plate and some sort of pepper dish stuffed with cheese), the salads, and the entrees. My friend and I are addicted to the sausage rigatoni. Another friend loves the rissotto. Another friend swears by the frutti di mare.  On top of it all, we are continually shocked at how freakin' affordable it is. Whenever our bill comes, we always wonder at first whether things were accidentally left off. It's amazing. The deserts are fabulous as well, and our FAVORITE SERVER is Ellie. She's spicy and hilarious, and makes fabulous recommendations on what to eat that night. She also remembered us from last time and brought us free flutes of champagne just for fun. We will continue to go back here and ask for her section.

Our waiter was a little odd throughout our meal in the restaurant and at the end of the night used our credit cards to settle another table's bill. 3.

The portions are generous but not Buca De Beppoesque (too big).  The prices are reasonable; especially for Bucktown/Wicker Park.  We've gone on Friday nights without a reservation when the place is packed and been seated (party of 2 or 4) within 30 to 40 minutes.  We've also gone early on Sunday nights with our 2 year old and had a great experience as well.  The waiter we had did a great job interacting with our son. Some of my favorite dishes are the pastas, especially the frutti de mare, the salad with rocket, apples, goat cheese and pinenuts and the fish specials are always really good.  They have awesome gelatos (try the chocolate chip/banana) and the bread pudding is amazing.  My wife is more picky than I am and they will change any dish to accomodate your needs.  Honestly, I've never had a bad meal here and they are always changing their menu which I love (Hint to Le Bouchon).

2008-02-06,5.0,"Francesca's Forno is the Family of Francesca's Wicker Park location.  Appropriately, it is a much hipper and relaxed restaurant than the other incarnations.  Not to say it doesn't match up to the other Francesca's; when it comes to the food, it met my lofty expectations. I don't know if Francesca's has overly high expectations of their wait staff, or if I have just been lucky, but for my second straight visit to one of their venues, I was extremely impressed with our server.  He was very knowledgeable of the menu, offered great suggestions and stopped by at all the right times. We started with a pizza.  Actually, we started with the bread.  And continued with the bread.  And continued with the bread.  Francesca Forno's bread is out of this world!  It is chewy with a hard crispy crust and they provide you with herbed butter AND seasoned olive oil.  I couldn't decide which topping was better, so I kept grabbing more pieces to aid my decision.  It's still a toss-up. After two baskets of bread, and probably 8 pieces for me alone, we received our pizza appetizer.  It was three cheese with prosciutto, figs and a Chianti reduction.  It was a delicious blend of ingredients, with each bite bringing out different flavors. For entrees, she had a delicious gnocchi in a brown butter sage tomato sauce.  It was very good, but paled in comparison to my spaghetti with mushrooms in a veal broth, truffle oil sauce.  It was rich and savory, and quite possibly the best pasta I have ever tasted.  Still early in the year, it has a strong hold on best things I ate in 2008. Despite the massive amounts of bread consumed, my better half's extreme love for Nutella overruled our stomach's plea for no more food.  We split the crepes with Nutella and cream.  They weren't out-and-out amazing, but they will certainly greatly please any Nutella freaks out there.   Francesca's Forno definitely has a more unique feel than its sister locations.  The parent company did a great job of adapting their plan, tweaking it to the neighborhood, and still delivering some of the best Italian dining in the city.",0.9978,0.756,0.209,0.036,0.5607678571428572

The menu is a good size - not too overwhelming. Large menus scare me and I can't make decisions.  I went with the risotto of the day and my cousin got some chicken dish (I am so eloquent).  We had the appetizer special, which was a delicious bruschetta.  I don't recall the wine my cousin picked, but it was a dry Tuscan merlot.  For dessert we split an incredible, warm, flourless chocolate cake topped with mint gelato and berries.  Awesome. The service was great, as well.  Our waitress was knowledgeable, friendly, but not phony.  She was attentive and even corked our un-finished bottle of wine to take home (even going so far as to seal it in a plastic bag and include a copy of the receipt so in case we were pulled over there would not be an issue).

It turns out it was actually *very* good...

Reservations are a must in the future... we called and asked for reservations, were told 9pm was the soonest, but we could come in and wait and hope for the best... (""if you come *right now* I have a table for 3"")... We get there and he told us 20 minutes.  Fine, we went to the bar for drinks... We should've ordered an appetizer at the bar, the wait was probably 45 minutes.  Again, not totally his fault and even a little predictable.  The host was very nice about it and kept giving us updates on our table (""they're paying their bill"" ... ""they're drinking coffee"" ... ""they paid their bill, drank their coffee, and now they're just sitting around!"" ... he started getting frustrated and really wanted to turn the table). When we were seated we ordered grilled calamari.  Amazing... The best grilled calamari I've had in a long, long time.  No rubbery consistency whatsoever, perfectly cooked with a nice char flavor. We consulted the waiter on entree recommendations.  I was in the mood for something really meaty, which seemed to only leave 3 options or so.  He said the lamb shank special was great, but Brian wanted that... So that left the pork chop, which he kinda hinted wasn't his favorite thing but said it was the chef's favorite.  My sister ordered rigatoni. Brian loved his lamb entree, but I'm told I can't report on his meals anymore... he wants to. :P ... My pork chop was the thickest cut pork chop I've ever seen in my life.  I wouldn't recommend it for anyone that still thinks trichinosis exists and orders their food overly done, but I liked it at a nice medium... Parts of it were closer to medium rare though, it was a really thick cut.  A slightly thinner cut would've been easier to cook to a consistent medium, but overall it was pretty great.  It was topped with a mustardy charred sauce that gave it nice flavor.  The beans it floated atop were great, too.  My sister said she liked her rigatoni, the noodles themselves were huge. For dessert we ordered and shared a flour-less chocolate cake, which was topped with mint ice cream.  it was good, but ... kind of boring. and the ice cream was probably covering up for the lack of excitement.

Good salad, not 'wow-worthy' though.  - Entree: Funghi, Taleggio, e Cipolla, basically a wild mushroom pizza with truffle oil.

As we live closer to Forno, however (and because we're slightly lazy) we opted for Forno instead. We left wishing we'd have gone to Mia Francesca.  The reviews are on the money when they say the seating is close and it gets loud. Expecting this going in helped, but when we arrived the host took 3-4 phone calls before he even looked our way. OK, fine, he got slammed momentarily, we will not let this deter us. We were sat at a small table between 2 other couples, and I will warn you: God help you if you get sat next to a loud talker like I did, because not only do you have to try not to broadcast your own convo to the whole restaurant, you have to attempt to block out the other conversation and in my case, really try to avoid glaring. No one likes the glare... The wine selection was pretty good. Our server recommended one of the wines on the special card, and upon checking it out, of course he would, as it's $87/bottle. We ordered the grilled calamari, which was fine, if a little rubbery. The oil it was served in made a fantastic dip for the crusty bread we were brought. It would be the last time we would see our server for maybe 40 minutes.  I got the gnocchi-like dish and my companion got some large half-shell and veg dish. My portion was fairly small, or maybe it was because it was served in a HUGE cereal bowl and my perception got thrown off. Either way, it didn't fill me up. Then, my companion says to me after trying his dish, ""You know...this tastes like pasta with some kind of canned vegetable soup poured over it. Like Campbell's soup, without the broth."" I tried it; I was surprised; he was right. The pasta tasted good, had its own flavor; but the other ingredients...it was crazy, because I could SEE that they were fresh, but they really did taste like canned soup vegs.  :( All that having happened, we were eager to get out of there. The next time we managed to snag our server, I asked for the bill. He asked if we wanted dessert. We said no, we had other plans. Not even a coffee or an espresso, something to send us off? NO, thank you...just the check, please. Fifteen minutes pass before he comes back, sans bill. He apologizes, says he's just gotten super-busy, and he takes my card. He's back with the receipt within the minute with another apology, undoubtedly sensing his tip had been withering.  Unless I'm with others intent on going to this place, I won't be back. I may try out Mia Francesca, however...",0.9934,0.794,0.147,0.058,0.5342044134727062

2007-03-28,4.0,"Are you feeling... lucky? Well, it's all about chance at Francesca's! I have been there often enough (call me a pseudo-regular) to detect a certain ""pattern"" to the place: One day you'll get a meal that is quite delectable, but on a different day it will kinda... well, I don't want to use the word ""suck"", but it does on those unlucky days. Yup, it's all about hit or miss. However, today, my four stars are based on one of the good days. Yay!  I very much enjoy the herbed olive oil they give you to snack with bread, and the garlic butter is quite delish. As far as appetizers go, I'm not too thrilled about the tuna... I think they just empty out a can of the divine fish onto a bowl and make it pretty - not one of their finest dishes, but kudos for the presentation***. I do, however, highly, HIGHLY recommend the bruschetta, especially if you are a ""fungi"" lover (get it? Fungi? Fun-gai? FUN GUY?!?! carrying on...); it is, simply put, scrumptious.  The entrees are decent, but I would advice getting the specials - they change quite often and can be quite tasty, making me wish they were part of the main menu. The pizza entrees can be kinda salty (especially on the bad days), so watch out for those! They best part of the dining experience at Francesca's Forno is the dessert menu. Let me be more specific: The best part of the dining experience at Francesca's Forno is ordering the dessert platter. When I go in a group, we never fail to order these four different desserts served to share amongst all (and you save a couple of bucks too =). The menu explicitly says: ""Chef's choice"", but not *once* have we gone when we weren't able to get the desserts *we* wanted - all it takes is flashing a dashing smile to your server =) My favorites include the creme brulee, the chocolate bread pudding, the peanut butter ice-cream scoop stuffed with (you guessed it!) peanut butter, and the chocolate lava cake with mint chocolate chip ice-cream on top.  Great. Now I'm hungry.  Besides the food on ""bad days"", I haven't really had a bad service. The place can get crowded on Friday and Saturday nights, and it can be a pain to trek the tables, but it still has a friendly and comfortable feel to it. Best of all, it's situated right at the corner of North, Damen and Milwaukee, making it a people-watcher's haven. And you might even get to see a cab run over a pedestrian or two. I have spend many an-evening at this restaurant with family, friends, dates, etc etc etc, and I think I will keep going back for more =) *** Please refer to my review of ""Il Covo"" for this pressing issue",0.9989,0.716,0.236,0.048,0.5692102206736354

Our original server asked if we had any questions about the menu, left to give us a time to decide and then never came back. He was replaced (twenty minutes later) by someone else.  The brunch menu had a wide variety of choices. My skillet of eggs, sausage and potatoes was delicious and someone else I was with got a tuna melt, which looked awesome. Another of my friends, however, got the french toast and complained that it tasted chemical-y. I didn't believe her at first, but when I tried a bite, I did noticed a really strange taste -- almost like a dirty sponge or something. Gross. Somehow we saved room for dessert (I know, who eats dessert with brunch, right?) and it was very good, but not enough to save the rest of the meal.

I also followed my breakfast with dessert, which, now that I think about it, is kind of weird. As far as the food goes, I went with the chocolate chip pancakes with fresh fruit.  (They're supposed to be served with mascarpone as well, but I hate mascarpone so I opted out.  Also, as an aside, 'mascarpone' is misspelled on their menu.)  They were good, not the best ever, but good nonetheless. My boyfriend had an omelet with asparagus and other stuff.  He liked it. The aforementioned dessert was incredible.  I opted for the torta cioccolata, which was chocolate mousse and cake topped off with toasted hazelnuts.  It was SUPER delicious.  Actually, all of the desserts sounded great, so I'm planning on going back and trying every single one.  You know, just to make sure. The only *slight* downside?  It seemed like there were a lot of kids here, which I actually thought was kind of unusual for the area.  Still, they all seemed pretty well-behaved, so I guess it's a non-issue. And since a lot of these reviews have commented on the music: we got to listen to Verve Remixed Volume 3.  Which I love dearly, but am getting a little tired of.  Still, good brunch music.

As we were looking over the menu, The Pixies and then Magnetic Fields blared from the speakers. From the first bite into the warm bread I'd smeared butter onto, it was true love. This place is a keeper. For a starter, we picked Carciofi alla Romana, which was one of the most interesting tastes I've rolled around in my mouth for some time. It's artichokes, lemon, mint, and bread crumbs. It was a truly subtle touch, but the mint really smacked down your idea of what artichokes should be flavored with and I loved it.  We each got the same salad: Pinoli e Caprino, comprised of watercress, endive, arugula, pine nuts, pear, and goat cheese. Honestly, this is one of the best salads that I have ever had. The goat cheese is placed atop the salad and is slightly warm and each bite is just pure heaven. I tried to ration the goat cheese so that I'd have just a little bit in each bite. The fact that this salad is $6 is cryincrazyamazacrazy because most places that would serve a salad this good at such a nice portion would charge you at least $9. My invisible hat off to you, Francesca's Forno.  For my entree, I ordered Penne con Carciofi e Prosciutto (minus the prosciutto), which Zachary ordered the ravioli. Entree winner: Zachary. While my pasta was delicious, the ravioli was wonderful...some of the best I have ever had. We were so full, but for you, Yelp, to write as thorough of a review as we possibly could, we struggled on and split their gelato sandwiches, which were every bit as delicious as they sound.  A five star meal that totaled $67 (pre-tip), where we split an appetizer and dessert, and we each had a salad, an alcoholic beverage, and an entree. In every way except for one was this an amazing experience. When I had asked for my dinner to come without prosciutto, it arrived and I dug in, only to find a stray piece of prosciutto towards the bottom of the dish. Now, I don't know if it was a case of a cook accidently dropping that piece in or the server forgetting to tell the cook and then picking out the prociutto herself, but I let it slide because everything else was utterly enjoyable.

2006-07-27,1.0,"Greatest restaurant for a Sunday evening with friends.  We had perfect service and a great meal ... a heavenly bottle of wine and walked out satisfied (leaving a large tip). Next day ... we get a call saying we stole from the restaurant and did not pay our full bill.  We have credit card receipts to prove this allegation false, but I will never feel the same about a restaurant that demands we come back to pay for a meal a second time.   I hope these people can get their act together because it is a shame such a good meal was ruined.  None of us will ever go to this restaurant or any of the others ...  This was a few weeks ago and I am still beyond pissed just thinking about this situation.",0.7133,0.727,0.177,0.096,0.47525510204081634
2006-07-20,3.0,"This is a nice Italian restaurant that focuses on small plate dining. The food was decent and the prices were reasonable for the portions. The servings weren't as small as Spanish tapas but not as large as entree portions. I dined with 2 friends and we split 5 dishes and we were full. There are definitely some dishes that are larger portions and would be enough for an entree for one. We had this gelato ice cream sandwich dessert that was so cute and innovative! The one thing about this place, though, is that it was LOUD! The three of us had to basically yell across the table throughout the whole conversation. I wouldn't recommend it as a first date place.",0.9588,0.83,0.15,0.02,0.5340336134453781
2006-07-06,5.0,"From the moment my roomie and I walked in the service was just outstanding - from the hostess, the server, and the rest of the waitstaff.  I could have confused it with a 5 star restaurant!  The atmosphere is more casual than Mia Francesca's on Clark.  It was a weekday dinner, and so the restaurant wasn't packed.  We split the proscuitto and cheese balls which were very rich and delicious as the appetizer.  I had the tilapia special, and it was as good as the waiter described.  The tomatoes had a very rich flavor in the sauce, and it exquisitely complimented the fish.  I thought the portions seemed smaller than Mia Francesca's on Clark, but perfect for one person.  I had the Marscapone Cream and dates for dessert, and it was phenomenal.  I have never felt so guilty in my life eating the thing.  The presentation itself was damned impressive.  One of the servers came and put the dates and sauce on there, and it was almost too pretty to eat.  You have to have a sweet tooth to appreciate this.  I'm just going to end on saying that this place is a little too convenient for me to walk to.",0.9748,0.767,0.173,0.061,0.7896164021164022
2006-06-25,2.0,"Went here for brunch on a Sunday with a friend.  The service here was beyond excellent.  The atmosphere cute and quaint.  Not crowded at all.  My only complaint was that as a vegan, all I could order was a side of fruit.  I understand that vegans are quite a small minority and many restaurant owners do not feel they need to take us into account, but adding some kind of vegetable dish (even a plain salad) would be appreciated by many more than just vegans.  I didn't get a chance to look at the dinner menu, so maybe they would get more stars for that, but I don't go to restaurants for the service alone.",0.6898,0.85,0.096,0.054,0.5797619047619047
2006-06-25,5.0,"Outstanding. That is what my experience was at Forno on a Saturday night.  First off I went with a 12 year old, my roommate and myself, not exactly the most glitzy or experienced diners.  As soon as you walk in you're hit by an overwhelming noise...  Any other neighborhood and this would seem out of place, but in Wicker Park it was almost welcomed. To the 9's from start to finish..   Not wanting to bore my young diner with waiting for a table, I jokingly asked if I could leave a cell # to call me when a table was available.  I was willingly abliged, even suggested to try the record store.  Upon receiving our diner call, a quick 15 min later, after strolling down to the record store we came back in and were immediately seated.  The seating itself was an experience, while the restaurant was possibly too cramped for most people, the table was comfortable, intimate and warm.  The view from most of the tables is of the North/Damen/Milwaukee corner, and its fantastic to watch.  My roommate and I had problems keeping our eyes on our own table or even in the room, seems the best looking women in Wicker Park were sitting all around us or walking past the corner panoramic window.  Everyone how ever was dressed casual as plenty of shorts and sport shirts could be seen. Our waiter was initially very attentive and informed us immediately that he'd be right back.  He was very knowledgable of the menu and offered translations and descriptions readily.  Myself, being lost by the amazing array of choices, I asked for a suggestions.  The waiter didn't tell me the ravioli was good, he suggested 4 dishes and why they should be my choice, not simply the most expensive dish on the menu.  Or as happens quite often in Wicker Park, ""I don't eat meat, pfft."".  I let him complete my meal by suggesting the side and the dessert. To the food.  We received our dishes, wine, and sides very promptly. The bread was not to my guests liking as it was ""too hard"", I found the spiced olive oil, the garlic butter and the bread to be perfect.  My double cut pork chop ($18) was easily a $30+ pork chop at anything near Michigan Avenue, the peach on top, the perfect cooking, and the incredible sauce sealed the deal, this is a must have!  The dimmunitive friend had a seafood pasta ($12) that was very good, while a little confused about the shrimp still firmly attached to their tails she thoroughly enjoyed it.  My roommate's meal also looked quite good, it escapes me what he had as it was scarfed down in record times.  My house cabernet was also a fine selection ($9).  In addition we had a side of Potatoes in cheese fondue ($5), to be put it lightly this was also a must have.  It sounds simple but a pair of small potatoes expertly baked, flash fried, then sitting in a cheese fondue is a knockout. Then there was dessert, diminutive friend = dessert.  The youngin had a warm fruit tart topped with vanilla gelato ($6).  Fresh whip cream and caramel were applied at table side.  My roommate and I each had the special of the day, a rich flourless brownie topped by vanilla gelato (a rich ice cream made with cream basically), fudge and some nuts ($6).  The three desserts were expertly prepared and fantastic. 3 excellent meals, 1 wine, 2 iced teas, 3 deserts, and a side = $81.00 well spent. Seating time for a Saturday night, fantastic location, expertly prepared food, warm atmosphere, excellent service (from host & hostess to knowledgeable waiter and eager to please bus service), and the total bill I give this a 5, as long as you don't mind it loud!",0.999,0.785,0.189,0.026,0.5761155823831879
2006-06-23,4.0,"Francesca's Forno is surprisingly yummy.  Their menu is not normally what I crave, but somehow they always have a special or something that I am so happy with.  They are in a great location with great views of Bucktown/Wicker Park.  Service is consistant and good.  We have come here with out-of-town friends numerous times and it's always a hit.",0.9885,0.58,0.42,0.0,0.6651785714285714
2006-05-15,4.0,I've only ordered carryout from here so havent had the total dining experience but their brunch was delicious! I ordered a tuna sandwich and a caprese salad. It was delicious and served to perfection. They provided a loaf of bread with various sauces and a homemade butter. Delicious! I've been meaning to go in and have dinner.

2006-04-24,4.0,"I have never had such nice service and food while listening to 'Nimrod's Son,' and I loved watching all you pretty things walk by from my window seat. I guess you have to get here for early weekday dinners, 'cos it was empty and the service was awesome.  The herbed butter rocked.  You can order one entree each, or choose 3-5 smaller portions. Kathleen O. and I split everything.  Good carpaccio, fresh tomatoes and spinach.  The octopus salad was delicious, and the ricotta cheese in the traditional ravioli was perfect - ricotta just a little dry, how I love it.  The portions were all pretty small but with nice presentation, so we ordered two desserts to share thinking we'd daintily tuck into little petit fours and fruity thingies, but darn my cellulite if they weren't generous. Don't get all dolled up.  Or, get all dolled up. This is not your father's Milwaukee Avenue.",0.8793,0.803,0.139,0.059,0.7166666666666666
2006-02-07,3.0,"It's all about the butter.   I'm not the biggest fan of Italian-American food, but I must say that FF's has the best herb butter I've had in town.  It's so good that I wish I could purchase some for my home.  The portions at FF are perfect for one person, which is the way it should be.  The noise level can get a little out of control if you go during rush hour (after 7 pm), but the prices are very reasonable.  You can easily get away with spending about $10-12 per person and be more than satisfied.  The antipasti selection is also a good route to go if you're not sure what to eat.  I've tried the zucchini and the young artichoke in lemon juice with olive oil.  If you get 3 antipasti, it's $14 and they're individually priced at $4-6.  Service is spotty, and the seating isn't the most comfortable as the tables are jammed right next to each other, but the food is reliable and delicious.",0.9908,0.75,0.211,0.039,0.6112071846282374
