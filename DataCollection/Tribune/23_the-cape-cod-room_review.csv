2016-12-21,5.0,"This historic restaurant is closing at the end of 2016.  I just wanted to say a few things for anyone who is going in the next couple of weeks.  My mom and I dined there last night and I learned a few things that I think everyone should know if you are one of the lucky people to have a reservation during their last days. Here goes: The service is not good, but it is not because the servers aren't trying or they don't care.  At first, I was annoyed, but after taking some time to talk to our server, I learned that he has been working there since 1972.  Since the announcement of their closing, many of the servers have quit.  The staff who are left are extremely overworked.  At 11pm on a Tuesday, every table was filled.  He said on a night like that they would normally have 20 staff members, and they had maybe 5 people.  He said that the kitchen is severely understaffed as well.  He said that they are all very tired, and very overworked.  They have not had a single day off in 5 weeks, and many of them are expected to work on Christmas day as well.  The hotel was bought out, and unfortunately this historic restaurant will be turned into retail space. Please do not express your frustration with the servers by tipping them poorly.  In fact, I believe you should do just the opposite.  Many of these people will be losing their jobs at the end of this month. The slow service, food quality, etc. is NOT their fault.  They are genuinely doing the best they can in a very bad situation, that has been handled terribly by management of the restaurant/hotel.",-0.9472,0.813,0.071,0.116,0.4480317460317461

True to the vibe of the Drake it has old world charm. I won't say elegant about this particular restaurant as it has an east coast nautical feel. We started with drinks and the crab cake and calamari appetizers which were very good. In fact that was one of the best crab cakes I've eaten. You only get (1) @ $17 per order which is a bit high although it was a nice size. They also bring a plate of rolls and cracker like bread which were actually really good. For dinner I ordered the Roquefort crusted NY strip with white asparagus and fanned hasselback potato with butter. The steak with the Roquefort cheese crust was tasty and the potato side was absolutely delicious!

The problem was a table in the middle of the room with seven 20/30 somethings. All they did was drink for the majority of the evening. They ordered one bowl of soup for the seven of them. As they continued to drink their conversation    bordered on the obscene. Lots of swearing and discussions about genitalia size. I'm not sure why the restaurant allowed this.  My dinner was over $100. It got to the point where I quit eating and left. If you're going to make fun of groups of people don't do it loudly in a public space. I'm from a liberal West Coast city and even this was more than I could handle. I'm staying at the Drake Hotel and this is their restaurant. They should be more aware of what is going on in their establishment. It was a very loud group and everyone could hear the conversation.

The restaurant is located in the Drake hotel downtown, and it was really nice. Most people were fairly dressed up, and the place was pretty intimate. With it being in the center of downtown and in a very expensive hotel, it would only make sense that this place was very expensive. In my opinion, the food and service matched the price. Our server checked on us frequently, and answered all of our questions with great patience.  We had a crab cake to share as an appetizer, and it was great. The crab was clearly fresh (as it should be in a seafood restaurant), and it was very flavorful. This was a great start to an amazing meal. My girlfriend had the Swordfish which she really enjoyed, and I had the Rack of Lamb. The rack of lamb came with a great spinach salad that had a sweet dressing to go along with it. The Lamb was the best thing I tasted all night, and the portion size was great. It was cooked perfectly and seasoned well with rosemary and garlic. Lastly, to top everything off we had a slice of cheesecake to share.  With my girlfriend and I being long distance, it was an amazing end to her visit.

It was good, I was just disappointed that there weren't more shrimp or scallops instead of the mussels I was going to eat.  However, the garlic green broth in the hot pot had lots of depth of flavor and I enjoyed soaking up every last drop with my bread.

The clam chowder was great too, a bit too creamy for my taste but still good. We also go the ahi tuna that they forgot. It was a disappointment. It seems like they prepared it hours ago and threw it in the fridge till someone ordered it. Do not get the ahi tuna!!! We got the ny strip. It was a really bad cut of meat. Tons of tendons in it. The chef prepared how he should have but it just a bad cut. We also got the halibut. That was pretty great too. We got the fingerling potatoes for a side.

2014-08-30,5.0,"Quaint. Delicious. Flawless. MCB! Although located in the infamous Drake Hotel, I can't describe the ""Cape Cod Room"" setting as ""fancy.""  Though there is the wonderful history as well as fine food and linen tablecloths, there are also those heavy wooden chairs commonly seen in more casual seaside eateries. Though there are no less than three crisply-dressed attendants to your table, there is also a friendly ease with they serve you...and with a ready smile. Though the space is actually quite large, it's divided into intimate sections and multi-levels. Add some maritime artwork, wooden panels and copper lighting and you have yourself a spot reminiscent of well, of course, the eastern seaboard. Quaint.  Although you've got Oysters Rockefeller, you've still got French fries (and the enduring ketchup, ala Heinz.) The clam chowder was properly portioned with ... Clams! I've noted a recent rash of heavy potato and rosemary in ""clam chowders"" and it just won't do. All of us enjoyed our entrees. Diver scallops were smooth and buttery, perfectly prepared and plated in a cream corn sauce. The rack of lamb was tender and succulent - also beautifully plated. I found an unusual satisfaction in that there was no ""specialty"" cocktail menu at hand. This isn't trendy or fussy - let's get to the Vodka martini, straight up and have some nice wine with the meal. (Excellent selection by the glass.) Delicious.  Although there was no ""official"" host at the podium upon our arrival, we were nonetheless readily greeted and seated by a window overlooking Oak Street & Lake Shore Drive. Then, the ice man cometh. How many cubes? I notice subtle nuances that create a unique experience and something as seemingly ""little"" as ""how much ice would you like in your water"" suits me. (Not that he actually had to ask - big points on picking up nonverbal diner cues, Mr Iceman). No one, including our head server, Raul, missed a beat. Flawless.

What?! When we arrived (we decided to dress formal), all the men were wearing jackets and all the women were dressed up. What if we showed up in jeans?! Bar staff completely ignored us when we sat at the bar waiting for our table to be set up. We asked for a drink menu twice and finally someone brought the wine list and took our order. Whole process took 15 minutes and there were only two other couples at the bar. When our table was finally ready the hostess told us she preferred that we cash out at the bar and didn't want to take our drinks to the table? Weird huh. When we were finally seated, the waiter wanted to take our drink order, apps, and main course and sides all at once when we didn't even have a moment to look at the menu. Weird!!!  We ordered an expensive bottle of wine and apps and asked the waiter if we could look at the menu to decide on our main course. This was a bit of a problem for him and he showed it on his face. After 1.5 hours (YES, ONE HOUR AND THIRTY MINUTES!) of waiting for our bottle of wine to show up, we flagged down a nearby waiter and asked if we could talk to the manger because we haven't seen our waiter or our bottle of wine or our apps or ordered our main course. The manager said he would take care of our wine and asked if we would still like to order our main course. Since we were still enjoying our time together and didn't want to ruin our date, we decided to brave it out.  Our waiter showed up and rudely took our order.  So weird!  When our main courses arrived (we both ordered seafood), our meals tasted fishy!!  First time in my life that I ever tasted king crab legs that tasted like they were old and fishy. It was so gross!! I had two because I was hungry and couldn't believe that such an expensive place would serve such old gross food.  My boyfriend got the salmon and he too didn't even want to finish his meal.

I like The Drake hotel a lot for its historic atmosphere,  its lake view and the proximity to a few bars that always seem to be busy. Today I was in a bit of a rush for dinner with a craving for salmon, so I went to the Cap Cod Room. This was my first and last time there, even though I hope my experience was not representative. I had the lobster bisque and the salmon.  The lobster bisque was very good, better than most I've had (and I had many). Creamy, but not too creamy, slightly spicy and with a fresh distinct lobster taste. It also had the right amount of lobster in it and the portion size was on the generous side. And after having that, I was very much looking forward to the Loch Duart Salmon Steak I ordered which features a poached salmon. Poaching is one of my favorite ways of preparing fish, because if done well (i.e. fresh fish + correct timing), it results in incredibly tastful, soft, juicy fish. My salmon today however was severly over poached and as a result had a weird tough consistency and tasted really fishy. Salmon is specifically sensitive to over poaching and turns quickly from excellent to almost uneatable. This specific salmon was one of the worst salmons I had in a long, long time. When asked, I told the waitress what I thought about the salmon and she brought the manager. He listened to what I said, told me he would talk to the chef and went his way, without even trying to rectify the situation.  Dear Cap Cod Room, if you ask for $32 for a salmon, you better make that an awesome salmon and you better poach it on the spot. If you mess it up, which happens even in the best of restaurants, do something about it. This could be such a nice place, with the history and the atmosphere and I really wished you would have mastered either the food or the service tonight. 4 stars of the lobster bisque, 0 for the salmon and 0 for the service.",0.9935,0.82,0.149,0.032,0.5169111969111969

2011-02-26,4.0,"SP and I went to the Cape Cod Room last Saturday evening for Restaurant Week. We were not sure what to expect, given the restaurant's location in the Drake Hotel, but were pleasantly surprised by the relaxed, intimate atmosphere. Although the nautical theme was expected given the restaurant's seafood focus and namesake, we were not expecting the interior to really resemble a weathered inn that really could've been in Cape Cod. The low ceilings gave the place a cave-like feel and the dining room was divded into several smaller spaces which made the whole experience feel very cozy. The food was very good. The Restaurant Week menu was a good value and with two of us, we were basically able to try everything that was featured. The meal started off with some warm rolls. Nothing special, but still yummy (especially if you are a bread-lover like me). The Moules Frites (mussels with fries) was delicious and substantial, even for the tasting menu. The escargot were a little rubbery, however. We also ordered half a dozen oysters, which were tasty (although on the smallish side), but pricey at $3/$4 a piece for the east coast/west coast selections of the evening. We had the trout and the salmon for the entrees and they were both very good. Each dish was flavorful and not overcooked (which is often one of my biggest gripes about seafood at american restaurants). The desserts sounded better than they actually were, but we still finished both of them. The biggest flaw I saw was the wine list. Overall it was fairly limited and many of the wines by the glass (which were also available as bottles) were inexpensive (aka cheap) ones that you would see at your neighborhood Jewel for under $10. it's never a good feeling to know that for each glass you paid for, you could've bought a whole bottle.

We were greeted by the restaurant's myriad rewards and accolades from many years ago (struggled to find any such awards cica 2000) But the decor was charming, harking back to a time when ""Moby Dick"" was the NY times best seller...   But it was cute and cozy and we were excited to start our dining experience. We began by ordering  fried calamari. BIg Mistake. What appeared was a plate of deep-fried-oil-dripping-slop.  This frozen calamari was dreadful. Moving on... Ordered the Tandoori Grouper served on Lobster Mashed Potatoes with Grilled Asparagus.  Sounds great, right?  Yeah, I thought so too..  Then it came. The fish was okay.  But the mashed potatoes were dreadful.  I'm guessing they were either instant or processed.  Way to ""soupy"" for my taste... Grilled asparagus should be, after all, grilled.  ""where are the grill marks?"" I wondered.   I'm guessing they were simply boiled and stuck on my plate.  Looking wilted and pathetic, I opted to pass... We skipped desert and promptly paid the bill. This review would have been 1 star, but our server was quite pleasant.   With all the dining options available in Chicago,  pass on the Cape Cod Room.",0.9366,0.823,0.123,0.055,0.6643722943722944

There were two lifetime Chicagoans in our party of three, and none of us had visited this iconic maritime destination before. I'm a big fan of faded elegance, and the Cape Cod Room didn't disappoint. Situated in the bowels of the stately Drake Hotel, among luxury boutiques and galleries of bad figurative art, everything about the experience screams yesteryear. From the stodgy waitstaff to the shot of sherry in the requisite bookbinder soup, one has the sense that nothing has changed here since opening day.

For my first course, I had the signature Bookbinder soup, which was really good. The shot of sherry made it even better, as some people have mentioned, but I probably should have just added a little in at first, instead of dumping it all in, cause that did make the sherry flavor a bit too strong... Next, I had the Shrimp du Jonge, which was good, but nothing special. Potatoes and asparagus were yummy too. The dessert was amazing: Apple tart w/ cinnamon ice cream. Sigh. I wish grocery stores carried cinnamon ice cream.. I'd eat it all the time.  Overall.. This place was very good. It's supposed to be known for its seafood, but I didn't feel like the seafood that I tasted was that outstanding... but that doesn't mean that it isn't good. Just not ""the best.""

A jaunty little wooden sign in the shape of a whale welcomed us to a dim, quiet little space. Upscale Red Lobster? Why the hell not!?

I asked him how he was and he replied, ""Oh pretty good, the drugs are starting to kick in."" Hoho! My god, we were in good hands. My Sidecar was truly never ending. I only ordered one but the damn thing kept mysteriously refilling itself with the help of Michael's bottomless cocktail shaker.  Soon we were gabbing it up with the lovely couples on either side of us. Blah blah blah, isn't this just the ticket?  Before the end of the night the couple to our left even invited us to visit them at their home in Wisconsin.

2008-03-16,2.0,"This really and truly was one of my favorite restaurants. My opinion has sadly changed. Actually, I felt completely betrayed. Personally injured. To start, they've changed the ambiance. I liked the restaurant dark. It was meant to be dark. Halogens should have no relation to a restaurant of this sort. But, they've installed halogens. Our waiter rushed to explain that soon they would replace the bulbs in the new lights and they wouldn't be too bright. I was not comforted. The original-style red-and-white-check cotton table cloths are gone. They have been replaced by taupe under-cloths and blue over-cloths on the diagonal; the napkins are the same taupe fabric as the underlayment. The colors aren't my favorite, but I felt personally insulted by fact that they were a synthetic blend! I talking Polyester, people. No self-respecting restaurant of this caliber should ever have anything except cotton touching the delicate paws of its patrons! They did away with the perfectly good silverware they used to have, classic heavy stuff that felt solid in the hand, and replaced it with a new set that has, well, fish tails on the ends; simply ridiculous. What's next? The Capital Grill getting silverware with cow hooves on the bottom? Not only silly, really annoying as well: the new set has a hors-de-oeuvres-cum-salad-fork. This seems all well and good in theory, but in reality is quite impractical. A salad fork is not an oyster fork and vice-versa. It was too big for the Oysters Rockefeller and too small for the salad. The menu has changed as well. Say good-bye to ""Market Price"" lobster. Now you have standard-priced lobster. Probably imported from antibiotic-filled sewer ponds in Thailand. Auntie Says: never trust a standard-priced lobster. More than that, they have a new Chef, originally from New Orleans, who is trying to gussy up the menu with things like Lobster Bisque with squash and chipotle. Well, call me a Damn Yankee, but that's just wrong. The Cape Cod Room is not a trendy, fusion-type place. No gussying was needed here, thank you very much. Even the surf and turf was sad. The 8 oz. portion of fillet was tough and tasted livery; a sure sign of a poor cut of meat mixed with too low of a cooking heat. The Sea Bass was extremely fishy, overpowering the delicate flavor of this usually excellent item. Even the potatoes had been over-salted. The serving staff, while the same, was obviously demoralized by all the Corporate changes. When the waiter delivered my plate, he looked in the server station for a steak knife to give me. I saw the dawning shame on his face as he realized he could only offer me another fish-tale knife. This grand-dame of old Chicago is a tarted-up version of itself.
