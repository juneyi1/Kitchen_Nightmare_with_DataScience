2016-02-15,3.0,"Eat something before you dine here because service is SLOW!.  The saving grace for this Chili's, however, is the location, friendly waitresses and food is good, served hot.  Coffee was the exception.. not even lukewarm, no sugar offered so I exchanged drink order.  The slow wait appears to be as a result of not enough kitchen help and help to clear tables.  A manager or hostess was actually clearing tables.  When we entered no one was available to seat us so someone in our party had to seek help.   The staff was very good at addressing problems/concerns about our food and offered complimentary dishes to our satisfaction.  If you park in the self parking nearby lot, be sure to ask for ticket validation prior to leaving the restaurant, otherwise be prepared to pay $39.00.  Price was $14.00 with validation for the two hours we spent and I think this applies up to 3 hours.  For a downtown location the place does not have the appeal, cleanliness of the Chili's in suburban Orland, but it was much easier to access from our home.  All in all not a terrible choice for dining.",0.9563,0.826,0.143,0.03,0.44718954248366016

Ok, I get that she might not know them all so I asked about the skinny margarita. She yells over to to the bartender to ask him!  I received drink & that was the last I saw of her. The place was not that busy. I finally got her attention & asked for my check. She gave it to me & pointed to the checkout device on the table. It didn't work so I finally decided to pay cash & walked up to the bar & gave $ to bartender. After another wait, the server brought me my change. Terrible service. Btw, I had planned on eating.

2015-07-08,3.0,"Believe it or not I'm kinda of torn over this review because my wait staff is always amazing when I go to this location.  I have been more than four times maybe ten but I always forget to check in until I'm too far away...very true! Anyway, yet again when I went I didn't have a host/ess to seat us but a wonderful waitress saw me and my girlfriend looking like dears in headlights and helped us find a seat so she could serve us.  She was very pleasant and was very helpful....I'm sorry I forgot her name but I would know her face if I saw it. The last time I went which was about 2 or 3 weeks ago I ended up seating myself and eventually a waiter came to the table with a big smile who was so helpful that I forgot that I was standing at the door waiting to be seated for more than 10 minutes.  He also informed me and my daughter that the day he served us was his last day because he was moving to Florida...awwwwww but he was still one of the coolest waiters I met there....smile  I hope they hire more like him and the last waitress we had on our visit. He suggested a few of the newer drinks that Chili's was offering and I can say is mmmmmmmmmmmm so good.  Try the Watermelon one my daughter raved about it the entire time she sipped the straw from her glass...lol When we stopped in the last time we just got the Triple Decker Sampler...I hope I'm saying it right but you get to choose from a variety items and we chose the Fried Pickles(about 8), Onion Rings(about 8) and Southwestern Eggrolls(4)...all was good and mostly only good for two(maybe 3) so if you have a party of more than that you may want to order two and if I'm not mistaken I think the price was 13.59 plus tax. I have been here several times so I say with confidence I love there burgers, the 2 for 20 and if you upgrade the 2 for 35 that include a drink that is not watered down.  I also love the fajitas and I want to chicken crisp with the honey mustard, guacamole, loaded potato soup and wings...my girlfriend loves the boneless but I like the bone...but it is a matter of preference. I wasn't a fan of their steak I need to go to a place that specializes in steak because they are more of a burger and fry joint with a twist but not a steak place, but that is just my opinion from the last time I ordered one.  I have been to a few establishments but this one is actually the easiest to get to when you are using Public Transportation for me...take the Red Line Train to Grand walk a couple of blocks then your belly is ready to be full with some delightful treats...Oh that reminds me before I end this review....If you haven't try the chocolate chip cookie with ice cream it is enough for two maybe even three depending on how hungry you are so don't worry about the price you all can split it...lol...its worth it because the cookie comes out warm and the chocolate sauce marinates with the warm cookie and cold ice cream in just away that makes you want to order another one...smile. You also can pay at your table now if you are using a credit and debit card...which is cool but I don't see how that is going to stop people from eating and dodging the bill if they don't have anyone for a lack of a better word policing the area...that's just my opinion...so I hope they have some security in place. So, at the end of the day if they can either hire a host/ess or place a sign that says seat yourself so you will know that the rules have changed...don't take it out on the wait staff because they have never showed me nothing but the best service.

I called to see if we could make a reservation and was told by Fawn that they only accepted them for larger parties but they have a call ahead list that we could put our name on. This list is a joke. You call them to ""let them know you're coming in"" and then you have to ""check in"" and still continue to wait. What's the point? Anyways- that's not Fawns fault. However, I talked to her, said put is on the list, etc. and we would be down to check in. Literally, we walked out the door and into theirs: 6 minutes had passed. Climb though the crowds of people to get to the host stand and the hostess tells us we are not on the list and it had gone from a 45 min wait (which Fawn had quoted us) to 1 hr. We were also told by Dustin, the manager, that since we were not on the ""call ahead list"" we must not have actually called ahead. Are you kidding me? You're right sir, Fawn is such a common name I just decided to say that's who I talked to when I called. So Dustin asks when we called and I told him 7 min ago. He still doubts I called and calls back to Fawn on his headset. She tells him she didn't speak to me. So now there's a lie involved and I get very upset. Take responsibility for your mistake ma'am.  I shouldn't have to argue that indeed I DID call or show him my call log with Chili's phone number at the top of the list. To say the least, the manager didn't care.

It's a chain but always consistent in food quality and service.  The menu offers pastas, grilled burgers, ribs, and Mexican food (Sotto voice- ""Heh, Spaghetti Western.""). Some things I've ordered and liked: The Presidente Marg Chips and Salsa The chips are, admittedly, greasy. After eatting them my hands are so slippery... cuttlery and menus I touch slide between my fingers to the floor. Oy. The chips are also kinda thin and flaky, making it hard to hold thicker dips. Like... The Guacomole with fire roasted corn and veggies Good. The Chicken Fajitas Very good. They're served with grilled onions, grilled peppers, sides of grated cheese, chopped tomatoes, sour cream, guacomole, lettuce. This is not at all authentic. From what I heard. But if you could hear the expression on my face, you'd realize this is a chain and not meant to be authentic. And btw it's ok to like unconventional things. You aren't the boss of me. A-hem. Getting back to the chicken. The chicken filet entrees and sandwiches are fantastic. Moist and without gristle.  The desserts are distinctly good too.

Other things... the veggie quesadillas are good.  Oh, and I forgot what they're called, but I love the nachos from the appetizer menu.  They made the nachos where each chip is perfectly topped with every topping already set.  So no mixing stuff yourself... or running out of cheese or something on the last chips.  It's a great idea.

2007-02-07,3.0,"Since when did Chili's become so cool?  Beer and margaritas are now $3 after 5 PM.  This isn't a bad pre-gaming place for the cheap drinks and bottomless chips/salsa for $5.  The steak and chicken quesadilla is good (yes, you can combo the meats).  And I also love the steak fajita pita here!  And ""fajita pita"" is so fun to say!",0.8839,0.681,0.228,0.091,0.6238095238095239
2007-01-22,4.0,"Okay, you caught me.  I love Chili's.  This Chili's does pretty well as far as service goes.  I never have to sit with an empty soda glass for more than a minute.  It tends to get really crowded and I can not even imagine sitting and waiting for a table at Chili's when there are about 50 spectacular restaurants within walking distance. But, alas, the awesome blossom calls to me. I think when I tell people I went to Chili's for dinner if they ask what I did for the weekend they think I am using some dry humor thing on them.  Sadly, I kid them not.   I think Chili's may put the same crack in their ""secret sauce"" that Starbuck's puts in their coffees.  That is the only reason I can figure why we keep going back.",0.8979,0.827,0.125,0.048,0.6640625
2007-01-03,5.0,"Chili's is great restaurant that gives you bang for your buck. I went here with a couple friends plenty of time and I always get the $8.99 rib deal. It gives you not only your meal, but salad...and a dessert.  The ribs were delicious and for the dessert, I had the molten chocolate cake. That is some good dessert. It's sinfully spongy and everything!!! :) You gotta try it.",0.9605,0.763,0.237,0.0,0.8699999999999999

2006-04-14,4.0,"My friend had a craving for Chili's tonight so we looked it up and low and behold, in the city lies a Chili's. Out of all the chain restaurant, I would have to say that this is my favorite. I don't think you can go here without getting their chips and salsa. In fact, I don't even think you should be allowed in if you aren't willing to order them. : ) They have great margaritas. I like their salads and burgers. We also tried the Molton Cake, let me just say, I am not a fan of chocolate, but this cake was to die for. You won't leave hungry that is for sure!!!",0.2885,0.798,0.114,0.087,0.7814814814814813
