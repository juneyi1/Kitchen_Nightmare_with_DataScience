2016-07-12,4.0,"So we picked this place for dinner on a whim after seeing an instagram photo of one of their burgers one Friday night.  We typically do not visit the Logan Square neighborhood so it was a nice change!  Parking was super easy and the restaurant is located on a shady corner.  It's pretty cute inside with wood and Edison bulbs but also has a nice little outdoor area.  We both decided on the house burger, which wasn't bad but also wasn't anything special.  It definitely needed a signature sauce on it.  What we did enjoy most, however, was their cream of mushroom soup as an app and their drinks!  The sangria was good but the Meddy Neddy was amazing! It's like a sweeter, fizzier Moscow mule and you absolutely have to try it.",0.9887,0.729,0.252,0.018,0.721358543417367

2016-07-03,2.0,"To cut to the chase, expensive and not-so-great food. I won't be coming back. I paid over $70 after-tax and tip for the following experience. Service: Just OK. A casual establishment like this, I didn't expect much. Average overall. Nice staff. Ambiance/Environment: Cute, neighborhood place. I liked the outdoor seating and patio. The meal - this is where it all goes down the drain. This is what we had... Appetizer: We ordered the calamari. Not your typical fried calamari, it was steamed and it was just pretty good. I guess it was supposed to be a bit ""different"", you know how some chefs are, trying to reinvent the wheel for the sake of the craft. For $12 calamari, I wasn't impressed. Entree: We ordered the beet salad and the streak and frites. I ate the ladder...the presentation was beautiful, let's start with that, because after the presentation there isn't much to rave about. A valiant effort at steak, but I was disappointed. It was about seven or eight small slices of beef, seasoned with some herbs, and topped with butter, I believe rosemary butter, something ""creative."" The next part is, of course, completely subjective to me, but it just didn't taste that great. Not much flavor, the creative process with the herbs and the butter just didn't work. The fries, however, were delicious! I would've been happier with a plate of fries, and consider the price tag of the entire meal, I wouldn't be surprised if they charged me ten bucks for just the fries. I guess due to the holiday weekend there weren't that many patrons, that is what the staff said, too, but I should've been more suspicious. I've been wanting to try this place for awhile and have never seen that many people there, usually a red flag. So there you go. Anyone would be bummed to have spent all that money for a sub-par meal, but it happens I guess. Take my advice, pass on this one...if not, don't come hungry and share a dish if your curious to try it for yourself.",0.9565,0.834,0.111,0.055,0.5475146198830408

My husband asked to bring me granola and fruit instead. He quickly brought me yogurt and fruit. When we got our bill we were charged for the possible rotten chicken sandwich $13. We asked our server if we were being charged for the chicken sandwich we didn't eat. We then asked if the yogurt was the same price and he said it was $5 less he then asked the ""manager"" who was sitting enjoying her breakfast about how to handle the situation. She told him to tell us she could give us $5 cash or void the entire check and re charge. I think it would have been easier to come and first apologize about the bad chicken sandwich and about the bill. She never approached us nor make eye contact with us.

Also: the service.  We had to ask the waiter why our food hadn't come out after an hour of waiting, the explanation was that the food was made ""fresh"".  Okay, lots of places in Logan make fresh food to order.  They also get the food to your plate in less than an hour fifteen.  It literally took 10 minutes to eat because the portions were so small.

2016-05-12,1.0,"Don't bother. I came here with my girlfriend last Saturday evening. It took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get anything to drink, including a glass of wine and my cocktail, ""The Iliad"" which in this case could be summed up as 6 ounces of lemonade and a splash of gin, (it was $10..) Our waitress rolled her eyes when we asked for waters, which was actually the most personality she displayed during our time there. Every word she said sounded like a tired reading of a script. We placed our order, but were later told the kitchen was out of one of the key ingredients for our entree, so we had to choose another. This in and of itself isn't a huge deal, but the replacement Caesar salad was gross, bitter, and altogether inedible. I'd describe the calamari appetizer ($14) as 90% deep-fried flour, and 10% calamari, served with a little cup of mayo. I asked for my burger to be cooked medium, but it was well-done by anyone's standards. Didn't finish that either.. Slightly disconcerting side note: there was a random piece of cauliflower on my burger. Not sure what to do in that situation. At one point I thought their pretty respectable draft beer list would be the lone redeeming quality of this restaurant. Despite my efforts to flag down our waitress, who seemed extremely pre-occupied, casually chatting with the bar staff, I finally got the attention of a different waitress, who brought me the long-awaited beer. The place wasn't that busy. I think we were 1 out of maybe 5 tables. Pro-tip: if you make the mistake of coming here, ask for the size of the glass their draft beers come in, because it's not listed on the menu, and might take ya by surprise..

We've been wanting to try it for a while, since it's right down the street and the menu looked good, but our experience was kind of ""meh"". First off, the service wasn't very good. We waited a long time in the doorway for the staff to even acknowledge us, and we only saw our server three times after we were seated--once to take our drink order, once to take our food order, and once with the check, after we flagged him down! He didn't check in with us once during our meal. To be fair, they were pretty busy, but we've been to busier places with better service. The food tasted okay. A major issue was that the menus don't accurately describe what you're getting. I ordered the double cheeseburger and my boyfriend ordered the brunch burger (a play on biscuits and gravy), and neither of our orders matched the menu description. Mine, for instance, said it came with fries but it actually came with (cold) hashbrowns; his was supposed to be a single patty on a biscuit, but it actually came out as (kind of dry) sliders. Also: if you want milk in your coffee, they bring you those single-serve half-and-half containers that don't need refrigeration instead of real milk. Which is so strange for a restaurant that seems like it's trying to serve upscale food.

We arrived and stood in the door for nearly 10 minutes before anyone addressed us - this would be understandable if they were packed full, but we were the only ones waiting and while the patio was full, there were many open tables inside. Then there's the biggest issue: the wait for food. From the time we ordered to the time our food was delivered, we waited 35 minutes. To make matters worse, our food was all cold. Our veggie burger was cold, our eggs were cold, cold fries & potatoes, cold asparagus. The veggie burger was very good, but it was very small, and the steak (cooked rare - no 35 minute wait was needed) & eggs was really bland. The waiter did apologize and gave us 15% off our meal - that was kind and appreciated, but it didn't change the fact that we spent a good amount of money on pretty boring food that was cold and late.

The service was poor/disorganized, the amenities were bewilderingly uneven, and the food was overpriced & under-quality. My roommate and I went to check this place out not long after it opened, in September.  We were  seated promptly by the hostess - the patio seemed fairly full, but the inside dining area, where we were seated,  had only a few other tables occupied.  Opening busyness and not-yet-got-their-stride aside, I was pretty disgruntled that we sat there for 15 to 20 minutes before we got a server. We were talking about going to Masa Azul instead when a fellow who'd strolled past a half dozen times asked if we were being helped. However, the 2 things my roommate asked about on the menu were answered by the waiter readily enough, once he arrived.   The menu itself was eclectic and we had to look up what several of the dishes were supposed to be, but I ended up ordering a burger and my friend got a pasta dish.  I asked for mustard and was told that,  while they had regular ketchup on the table, they didn't have simple brown or yellow mustard. What they did have was some kind of mustard that required three or four adjectives (""whole grain organic...""?).  They also put out a small lidless salt cellar, with no serving spoon or anything. I'm disinclined to dig my fingers in for a pinch of salt others have been grubbing in, as well. My burger came with a more-cucumber-than-pickle slice; stale, tasteless shoestring fries; & unchewably fatty strips of possibly barbacoa. Overall, I've had better fast food burgers.  My friend said her bolognese was fine, but not good enough to warrant the price tag (full-meal) for the portion size (half-dish). Not impressed, not going back.",0.9667,0.881,0.091,0.028,0.4572816967978259

2016-02-15,5.0,"Man, Chicago really has some great places to eat. This is certainly one of them! Catalpa was conveniently close to our air bnb so we came in here one afternoon to recharge a cell phone and have a couple drinks to warm us up. The servers are very friendly and attentive. The beer and wine selection is great if you just want a drink. We got a good look at the menu and decided to come back to next morning for brunch. WOW the brunch! My partner got the bread pudding french toast. Holy good gosh. It was like dessert and absolutely delicious. So dense and rich and moist.. the perfect combo for bread pudding.  I got the special frittata that was outstanding! It came with a nice side salad and also ordered a side of the biscuit with jam. YUMMY, can I get this recipe? One of the best biscuits I've ever had. And the jam was amazing, can I just have a jar of this??? Bloody Mary's were hefty and very good too. We got mescal in ours which was a nice take on the BM.  Decor and vibe inside is gorgeous, very nice bathroom, and the open kitchen layout is beautiful. It's nice to see who is making your food. Bravo Catalpa!",0.9978,0.668,0.32,0.013,0.6930295566502462
2016-02-06,5.0,"So you are hungry in Logan Square and you are coming to Yelp to help you shrink down the universe just a bit. Likely you are faced with one obvious option-- Lula Cafe. Repeatedly ranked as the favorite restaurant in Chicago, it seems like the obvious must-try. I strongly implore you, however, to deviate from this obnoxious echo chamber and take a aesthetically pleasing stroll down Logan Blvd to CATALPA KITCHEN.  Catalpa's fare more than rivals Lula in price and quality. Their recipes are creative yet familiar and it sounds like they source their ingredients quite consciously. The shishito pepper appetizer for example (a play on the jalapeño popper?) is a mildly spicy pepper, stuffed with goat cheese, wrapped in pancetta ---deep fried--- then served with a side of anchovy dipping sauce. A fervent flavor combination for only $2/pepper. As far as main courses, the burger is one of the juiciest I have had and the pickle on the side, although usually a unremarkable afterthought at most establishments, is absolutely bursting with flavor. They need to package them up and sell them.  Drinks-- they usually have 4-5 beers on tap as well as a slew of unique bottled beers that I had never encountered before (kombucha cider!). Leah, the head bartender, has created a delicious mix of cocktails too. She really knows her stuff. Also the affordability here compared to other establishments in the area makes it easier to try a couple different things. They still have some kinks to work out but they really care about making a good impression. Since it's not crazy busy here you are never welcomed with a brusk ""whaddya want?"" The service has always been attentive and friendly. Seriously avoid the crowds and take a seat by the one of the huge windows, order some food and don't forget the beer and pickle.",0.9825,0.829,0.142,0.03,0.6086700336700336

I wish I didn't let that sway me but it did.  But I decided it was time to try this place for myself and, god damn, I am so glad I did. To all you haters out there... I recommend you give this place another go, because it was AWESOME.  First off, the decor inside is so cute and cozy. It was a perfect spot for a cold winter brunch.  The staff is warm and SUPER friendly. (Shout out to the LOVELY woman who filled my coffee without me even asking. You get me, girl.) They were attentive, quick, and helpful. And the food? So. Good. My friend and I split the veggie hash (really flavorful and comforting) and the Old Fashioned flapjacks. It wasn't until we were halfway though those that we realized that they were ""old fashioned"" but, rather, they were inspired by an OLD FASHIONED. And, jesus h, it was brilliant. The angostura whipped cream, the bourbon cherries.... all atop the fluffiest pancakes in town. Unreal. Also the coffee? Divine.  I always judge a brunch by how uncomfortable my pants feel when I leave. And after this brunch, I felt so uncomfortable I had to walk home (in the 26 degree weather), so this one was definitely a win.  Can't wait to go back.

The hostess (or manager?) was very nice and seated us promptly. Our server was also extremely good and along the way we were waited on by 4 people. Being from the south, I know proper from scratch buttermilk biscuits and sausage gravy when I see or smell it. A fresh tray of buttermilk biscuits was pulled out as we sat down which was totally on the up and up. My wife got the GIANT biscuits and gravy and I opted for the chilaquiles. Not realizing how big the order of B&G was, she mistakenly got a side of sausage links as well. By the time we finished, she'd barely made a dent in the biscuits and I snagged a single sausage link. In addition to the excellent food and superb service, this establishment gets a 5 star from me for the ambiance. It is a very Logan Square retro modern hipster vibe and gives it a unique feeling. From the bar stools that have old metal tractor seats welded on top to the unusual but still quite pretty artwork. Or the random wall of birch tree trunks. The kitchen is in plain view and we watched the cooks do their magic with good old fashioned cast iron skillets and butter... Just like mom used to do it.

Bottom Line There are more flavorful, price commensurate walking distance options (The General, Lula, Websters, etc) that are worth my dollar.

Food While the menu looks promising (American, Italian, French fusion), The flapjacks were good, but not $10 good and came out cold. The waitress told me that the flapjacks contained cherries soaked in bourbon and could get your BAC above the legal limit. However, there was nothing denoting this key fact as on the menu.  For dinner, the waiter recommended the bolognese and veggie burger. The bolognese is priced at $20 and the veggie burger at $12. The bolognese came out luke warm.

2015-09-14,2.0,"I get that it's a new restaurant so it still trying to work out some kinks, but it has A LOT of kinks it needs to work out if it wants to last. I went with a friend to try out their breakfast. Here is my experience.  Pros: It's beautifully designed on the inside. Lots of natural light, with cool decorations that aren't overdone and still tasteful. My favorite part is the patio. You don't have too many restaurants that sit on the Boulevard like this one does and it really is a great place, to sit outside and enjoy a good meal.  Cons: There were quite a few. First, the service was below average. Now this might be because it's new, but everywhere I looked ALL the servers seemed nervous and pretty much like they didn't know what they were doing. Our server did not seem to really know the menu, and when our server disappeared for what seemed forever, we had to track down another server just to get some jam. This server was completely clueless as to whether they even had jam and even told us she didn't believe jam was offered at the restaurant. We found that very suspicious seeing as a lot of their breakfast dishes come with toast on the side...... I get that it's a new place but it has been open for two weeks now and service should have been better than what we experienced.  The food though was the biggest disappointment. I am a big fan of Chilaquiles, and these were by far the worst I have ever had. It wasn't that the flavor was crappy it was the lack of effort put into them. I would say about 75% of the tortilla chips did not have the mole sauce or cheese on them. This meant that most of my meal, was more just like eating plain tortilla chips than actual chilaquiles. I suggest they really revamp the dish or scrap it altogether.  My friend was even more disappointed with her dish. She ordered a very simple breakfast that came with Bacon, scrambled eggs, toast and hash browns. I never thought a place could mess up something as simple as scrambled eggs, but they did. She told me they tasted funny, and I tried the eggs, and she was right. They had an odd taste, they almost tasted like fish and were very watery. She asked our server, if there was something special they put in the eggs because they taste strange, he said he didn't know but he would ask, and he never came back with an answer, just disappeared.  My last con is that for what you get, the prices really suck. I can go to Cafe con Leche and get chilaquiles that are much cheaper and 10x better, or go to Sunshine and get scrambled eggs, for 1/3 of the price. We had two very simple (and normally cheap dishes), one coffee, one orange juice, and our bill came out to about $40. Worth it if the food would have been good, but we both walked out of there feeling like it was a waste of our time and money.  I probably won't be returning here for a LONG time (if ever) until I see they make improvements. If you are looking for a good meal, I suggest you don't come here. Hopefully they fix the kinks and dishes, as the actual space and patio are very nice and it is in a great location.",0.9947,0.76,0.157,0.084,0.4466805148256762
2015-09-11,2.0,"I think that the vision here is on point but the execution is very poor. The chicken was bland, cold in the middle. Burger was decently cooked but was very plain.  The burger patties were not proportional to the bun, so the presentation was reminiscent of what we would cook ourselves in our college days. The bun was smashed and stale tasting. Fries were soggy. Love the space but given the creativity of the chefs in this area of town, this felt uninspired. Hopefully that improves.",0.924,0.778,0.177,0.045,0.6631168831168831
2015-09-08,1.0,"Decided to try Catalpa Kitchen for breakfast last Saturday after seeing the Trib review and hoped that the dining experience would be good. We expected to give them a little slack since they were so new, but there were many hiccups that should have been addressed prior (i.e. had to wait for menus to be printed; needed more waitstaff and cooks). We arrived a little after 9am and had to wait for a server for quite awhile and once we ordered, it took over 45 minutes to get our food. Another guest who sat down after us was served first and was done eating before we even got our meal. Our meal arrived lukewarm and the omelet I ordered was quite small and didn't come with toast (other people got toast). The hash browns seemed like they could have been frozen and the coffee was overpriced $4 a cup. The server kept apologizing but it would have been nice if they could have offered a free coffee for the wait. I believe they were so backed up that they were turning customers away upon arrival.Too bad, but won't be returning.",0.8653,0.883,0.085,0.031,0.46156881313131315
2015-09-07,2.0,"Count me as another member of the neighborhood that was eagerly anticipating another nice dining option in walking distance who was disappointed. While I hate to write a negative review of any venue - especially a new one, I also would hate for people to spend hard earned money and be disappointed in their meal. The issues at Catalpa sadly appear to extend beyond typical opening jitters that can quickly be remedied.  On the positive the restaurant design is well done; attractive interior and while most restaurants offering al fresco dining in the neighborhood settle for sidewalk seating, Catalpa Kitchen features a lovely and spacious patio. However a barely functioning air conditioner on a torridly hot day did not help make an initial positive impression; not sure how this was overlooked during the months preceding the opening.  As for the issues, Catalpa Kitchen received some press leading up to the opening, including an article in the Tribune. The article seemed to praise the ""global"" menu but my initial reaction was that the menu is all over the place - in fact Italian, French, Mexican, American fusion came to mind - not to mention also doing breakfast, lunch and dinner fare as well as opting to market themselves as farm-to-table. This is a lot for even a world class chef to take on - and something almost no world class chefs would take on; almost always a menu this ambitious results in quality suffering at the expense of quantity. ""Something for everybody"" is what the business touts; the menu reads items as diverse as chilaquiles with Oaxacan mole, several different burgers, Sardinian fritters, farmer's market frittata, Lyonnaise salad, three different house-made pastas, a ribeye, a ""pork blade steak"" with ""mashed plantains, citrus-annato sauce, cilantro, popcorn shoots""... heck they are even trying to be a juice bar to boot! Only other places I have seen this massive variety is at buffets on cruise ships and the Vegas strip. Even the various burgers are themed around different global regions - The Standard, The Juarez and the Mediterranean.  Not only is it impossible to properly execute such a vast array of dishes in a small kitchen, apparently whoever created the website even struggled: If you visit the restaurant's website and download the menu, under ""desserts"" the options read a Caprese Salad, a Grilled Cheese and a Belt (BLT with an egg).  I dined at Catalpa early on a weeknight for dinner; we were among the first guests that evening so the kitchen was not at all overwhelmed. I decided to keep it simple on my first visit and opted for a burger and a cocktail. Even this was a disaster; my bun was completely stale, my meat dried out from being overcooked and somehow my fries so under-cooked the thicker ones were completely raw in the middle. At the bottom of the online menu it states that ""catalpa kitchen uses local produce and meats wherever possible. farms and purveyors we love include ..."" Of note the ketchup was Heinz - immediately vacating any illusion of farm-to-table, local sourcing and emphasis on house-made.  In addition to the poorly executed burger, my cocktail did not fare much better; small but nice selection of spirits but it doesn't matter if it is not properly made. While service was certainly in no way poor; it did nothing to make me want to return. It was the same level of service I'd expect at a large corporate chain; my order was efficiently taken and food delivered but no warmth or personal aspect of the service one wants from a neighborhood venue.  All this would be easier to palate if the venue was charging diner prices, but the menu is moderately priced with many larger plates in the $20's (even pasta will run you $19 to $21). A dinner for two here with a couple rounds of drinks could easily run well north of $100. Heck, we dropped over $60 (including tax/tip) simply on one burger, one salad and two cocktails. Way too many phenomenal restaurants within approximately a half mile radius to be charging these prices and not deliver a fantastic experience.  Hopefully Catalpa Kitchen can figure things out; I do think management needs to be proactive and make some sweeping changes ASAP - including tightening up the restaurant's identity. Sometimes less is more.",0.9482,0.843,0.088,0.07,0.47898370967991233
2015-09-07,1.0,"Very disappointed. My wife and I live in the neighborhood, and have loved experiencing the evolution of restaurants in Logan Square. We attempt to try out all the new ones, and it being our anniversary, we picked Catalpa. The space is very attractive and the patio is gorgeous. We googled ""catalpa trees"" while waiting for our food; learned a lot, and gained an appreciation for the name. Unfortunately the food and service was lackluster. My wife asked the server her usual question ""what do you eat from the menu here?"". The server's response was ""I've never eaten anything here - we've been open less than a week."" Really? We quickly scaled back our expectations and decided to share rather than invest in a meal that did not bode well. We ordered the pate, and she came back to say there wasn't any left. We then took a shot at the burrata, and she said ""I'll see if we have that."" They did. It came as a spread-out blob on the plate with three anemic peach slices, some wine berries that had no flavor, and a garnish we weren't sure of. Since we didn't want to just eat spoonfuls of runny cheese, we asked for bread. Yup, no bread or other carrier came with it. It was not as described on the menu supposed to have mint and another herb as well. Because of the slowdown with the bread, our burger came out within seconds of the appetizer. The burger and bun were quite good. We realized we were not asked what temp we wanted it. It came out on the rare end of medium rare. Fortunately that worked well for me, but not-so-much for my wife. We decided to make due, and she ate a few bites of the more done portions and we called it a night. I know it's early in their run, and I trust things will get better. It's just such tough competition in the neighborhood, the new guys really have to bring their A-game from the start.",0.9135,0.889,0.067,0.045,0.5197579240682689

2015-09-05,1.0,"This a review just on the food alone since this place is so new and they are still working out some kinks with service. My wife got the veggie omelette and I got the chilaquiles. The veggie omelette was bland and small portioned.  The hash browns that came with the omelette were cold, but also sticky and burnt.  The chilaquiles were pretty much the worst chilaquiles I've ever had. They are basically just a bowl of tortilla chips with an fried egg on top and ""mole"".  The ""mole"" had a very odd flavor too.  I think it had too much cinnamon in it and it was too sweet.  I've had mole and chilaquiles lots of times before and this was far from the mark.  I don't mind waiting a long time for food if the food that comes out is actually good. Oh and it's a little overpriced.",0.5873,0.842,0.091,0.067,0.6041919191919193
2015-09-05,4.0,"So happy to see this building saved, renovated and put to good use!  I have already been there twice. The first experience was superior because it was a weekday breakfast (third day open!) and being their first week I am expecting some growing pains.  We had friendly attentive service and enjoyed everything.  Our food was delicious and fresh. My friend has the made in house sausage and biscuits. She is picky when it comes to sausage and gravy and said it was worth the price (ten bucks) and the best she's had. Not too greasy, good flavor good sausage. I had eggs benedict with pancetta and the sauce was light, the meat salty and poached eggs prepared correctly.  Enjoyed.  The kale apple lemon juice was delicious as well.   Second visit on a Saturday a bit inconsistent.  They are still finding their feet. My niece had eggs benedict and instead of it coming with a salad on separate plate as I had been served a few days earlier, it was a lettuce garnish this time.  Also pancetta in whole pieces and before it was diced I think.  Also she asked to hold the pancetta as she does not eat meat and they did not remember that so I had some pancetta with my toast!  small oops.  Not sure what's up with that. Not a huge deal, but should be tweaked. I had the vegetarian omelette and it was ok, but a bit rushed but we had been warned so it was still good (better than most).  That being said, when we were seated they said kitchen was a bit behind and we agreed to chill on the patio and had no time waiting for food.  Food did not really take that long even though we were warned it might so that says they are self aware and trying to get into the groove and doing the best they can.  I really liked the decor and all the people were nice that worked there including the Executive Chef who introduced himself to us the initial visit. The menu is not pretentious and the ingredients are quality. I am sure this place will be a neighborhood staple and I know I will be back.  Will update my review when I try the dinner.  For now, I did take off one star for two things: the slight inconsistencies of how same dish was served within a few days and also the desert we had the first time was good but the cast iron pan had tomato so a note to chef to be sure and keep the sweet and savory pans separate, you can taste it!    I wish them the best of luck and heartily welcome them to the neighborhood!

2015-09-04,2.0,"Gave it a try- so totally disorganized. Staff was friendly but confused, we were  seated right away, a bit busy on the outdoor patio on a perfect summer night.  One waiter stopped by took a drink order, I had a very tasty wheat beer that was on tap. The beer was not filled to the top of the glass- and I noticed that other beers served at other tables came the same way-  Please fill your drinks to the brim. My wife ordered a Burratta salad- it's on the menu- but our waiter had no idea what is was- he did go back to the kitchen to find out- and answered the question, my wife ordered it. Very tiny for 10 bucks. I had their #1 Cheeseburger which was very tasty and would order it again. The burger came with french fries that were not much better than McDonald's. They even looked like McDonald's fries. Were these frozen prior?   We had , no silverware or napkins as our food arrived- the server did notice that, and said he would get us some, which took another couple of minutes.  Meanwhile, other tables had left, their dirty dishes remained. There seemed to be a large staff working. Such chaos throughout the whole place. No salt shakers-  they serve sea salt in a little dish- The ketchup bottles- all of them on the tables had barely any ketchup in them- I had to ask the server for a bottle that had some ketchup in it.  He found a bottle, but it took him another couple of minutes. Our server never offered us any dessert, but did bring the check before we were done eating and said their was no rush...ahhh ok.  Seems like the wait staff here, is new to the concept of waiting on tables- When we asked for more water, it came after a few minutes- but the waiter poured water on my wife's foot.  He had no idea what he did. She was wearing sandals, it didn't really matter, but come on!  Catalpa Kitchen is a great space- and has so much potential- I will be back after they work out the first week kinks.

2015-09-04,3.0,"This is more like a 2.5 (for now!)  My guy and I have been walking by this space for months waiting for it to open and when it finally did, we were so excited! Their patio is WAY cute, and when we finally made our way over there for dinner we were able to choose a seat out there right away. Our server was really nice! He was honest and provided recommendations for their craft cocktails and seemed more than happy to run to the kitchen to ask questions about the dishes that he didn't know the answer to. A+ to the server! We decided to go the mixed drink route since the beer list wasn't very impressive so we ordered two cocktails based on his recommendation. I don't remember the names, but mine was a mango concoction that came in a tiki glass? I think a tiki-styled cocktail belongs in a completely different place but it was really good. It was fruity without being too sweet and had the right amount of acid. My boyfriend, on the other hand, had a cocktail that was cucumber based and very weak/bland. The spices settled to the bottom which made it hard to get the perfect sip, and even when it was stirred, it wasn't enough to spice up this heavy cucumber water cocktail. Definitely needs a citrus or SOMETHING. He didn't finish it.  Then the food. This is where the tables turned and my boyfriend had it good and I wasn't impressed. He got the #1 Burger and it was perfectly sized. I had a bite and the meat was perfectly seasoned and the aged-cheddar was great. He said he'd order it again. I got the spaghettini which was handmade pasta in a beurre-blanc sauce with veggies. On the menu it stated squash, mushrooms, and green beans, but it was mostly a medley of mushrooms and onions.  It was OKAY. The sauce was good, it was a nice light pasta dish for a nice night on the patio. I was just really disappointed that a $19 vegetarian pasta dish had a VERY small portion. Maybe it's just me, but if I'm spending almost $20 on pasta, I want some leftovers to show for it or something.  We'll definitely go back because it's right in the neighborhood and their patio is nice and the burger was great. Their dessert and breakfast menus also looked amazing! Plus, it's only their first week! Next time I'd just be more inclined to stick to their beer and burgers because the cocktails were so-so and the pasta was underwhelming and overpriced for the portion.",0.9976,0.789,0.181,0.03,0.6490029761904762
