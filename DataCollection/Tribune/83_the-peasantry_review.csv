It is now going to be our go to spot for more casual sit-down dining and drinks! First of all, it was very easy to get a reservation on a Saturday night. Some many think this is a sign of a bad place, but we enjoyed every aspect of the evening and loved not having to wait! The owner, who has a great Australian accent, is extremely nice and takes the time to talk to each table. The music was from the 90s and not loud so we could actually hear each other. The prices were good and the drink selection was great. The menu had something for everyone and a large vegetarian selection! There is a cozy fireplace and the tables are not too close together. The food was solid (we split the truffle tater tots, I had the burrata salad and my husband had the fish tacos, and we had a slice of flourless chocolate raspberry cake for dessert). All in all, we recommend this place for a weekday dinner or drinks. We also heard the brunch was amazing.",0.9931,0.778,0.206,0.016,0.5691017316017316

We started out with the truffle fries and duck tenders and both are an absolute must!! I ordered the pork tenderloin and it was delicious! The cinnamon and cranberries made for a thanksgiving feel in July. I tasted both the Boar burger and bone marrow burger. The Boar burger has a better balanced flavor palate overall compared to the bone marrow burger which was a little too rich and buttery for my liking. Don't get me wrong the bone marrow burger is amazing but I don't know if I would've been able to eat an entire burger. I order an espresso to finish the meal but it was the affogato  that stole the show! Gelato with table side pour espresso and coffee liquor, phenomenal!!!!

2016-06-20,5.0,"I picked this place for dinner because I was dining with four other people and didnt know two of them. I was was going to be in Lincoln Park, and this place was convenient and there was tables open on a Saturday night when I reserved. I wanted someplace that had menu that would work for pretty much anyone but with a little flair and had an atmosphere that would be conducive to chatting but not stuffy. The Peasantry hit all the marks. From the friendly service that included good cocktail and wine pairings (even by the glass, but we ended up with an Australian bottle suggested by the owner that was a real crowd pleaser), the cozy but still felt grown-up atmosphere, and the food, which was delicious and modern, but not inaccessible.  Between us, we had the beef and bone marrow burger, which was a pretty much perfect burger and pretty big, the pork, which was succulent , and I had the steak frites, which was perfectly done and tender.  For starters we got the chickpea fritters which were surprisingly spicy, but balanced, the duck tenders which I can't recommend enough (I'd go back just to nosh those and have a beer), and the triple truffle fries, which were highly recommended. In general, I'm *so over* truffle everything, especially truffle fries, because they usually are just doused in olive oil laced with cheap, chemical tasting truffle flavoring, but these tasted genuinely like truffles, delicately so, and were much better than I expected.    The only real drawback was that the restroom was waaaay dark. What's up with that? Also, I realized I had no trouble getting a table because it was pretty much empty the entire time. I can't understand why this place was not hopping with it's friendly, affordable menu and a space that would suit large parties, intimate dinners for two, or a couple of burgers with the boys.

The latte was mediocre and served in a very small glass. It was about two shot glasses of chai for $4. Truly, the main reason I'll never come back is because it's not fun to leave a $24 brunch for one not full. Just much much too expensive. Also!

2016-05-26,4.0,"I guess I had had writer's block or was on a Yelp hiatus when we dined at the Peasantry for dinner for the first time a few years ago.  What I remember about that experience was dying for those flavorful, crisp truffle fries and sending back the pasta dish bc it was a little toooo al dente for our taste, though the second attempt was still al dente. On this most recent visit, we dined in with friends for brunch.  My top 3 takeaways are: 1) The chilaquiles here are so tasty!  You get the CRUNCH (not soggy!) from the tortilla chips even though they have some salsa on them, some spice from the salsa, meatiness from any additional protein you add (contrary to the menu, steak is not available anymore, so I settled for chicken), and moisture from the sour cream, guac, cheese and eggs. Highly reco! 2) Portion sizes are modest.  Please sir, more gruel!  It's probably the right size for a meal, yes, but you likely won't leave with leftovers. 3) Brunch crowd gets bustling around noon!  The waiter told us he wanted to get our orders in bc it was so busy, but within the hour, the crowd died down pretty quickly, and we were one of the few tables still chatting it up over the smooth coffee.",0.5845,0.909,0.06,0.03,0.44411318150448587

Disprectful to patrons and their own employees. Please, please, for the love of brunch, take your business elsewhere.  A simple and obvious brunch necessity--coffee. I ordered coffee from a gentleman who I presume is the owner. After taking a few sips from my cup, I asked our server if I could have a warm up, as the coffee was cold. She whips out her ipad--seemingly to add this to our order--so I ask, ""wait, are you charging me for a refill?"" Long story short: she tells me that there are no free refills because they don't have coffee, they have Americano, so I will be charged for a second cup. Uhm, no, I would not like to pay for a second cup of something I DID NOT ORDER in the first place. She then went to chat with the gentleman who took my coffee order and came back to say they can heat up this cup or charge me for a second--not acknowledging that he didn't inform me ""coffee"" wasn't available. I asked that it instead be taken from the table and removed from the bill. She agreed. And yet, when the bill came, sure enough, I was charged for the Americano--and an upcharge for soy milk. When I called the waitress over to remind her she agreed to take it off the bill, she said her manager told her not to because I ""drank half of it."" WHAT?? I'm sorry, should I not have taken a few sips from the cup of what I thought was my order? Interestingly, they were willing to REMOVE the cup from the table (you know, since I didn't order it), but CHARGED me for it anyway. The waitress got her manager who came over with attitude, insisting that they would not take it off the bill, and if I wanted to ""punish them"" I could just ""not tip the waitress."" (Way to care about your staff.) She walked away when I was mid-sentence. In the end, it is not about the $4 Americano I didn't order, didn't drink, and was charged for. It is about a customer service opportunity that management could have easily remedied, but instead chose to be confrontational, with complete disregard for anyone but themselves. Can they really afford a business model where they'd rather have the $4 today versus the loyalty of a happy customer?  For those only concerned about the actual food--the place struck out there, too.

So this was one our GNO spots for November 2014. At first I was a little leary about this place and it's menu. I wasn't really drawn to anything on it and the items seemed a little high in price.  When we got there we were greeted by our nice, friendly waiter who asked us if we'd like something to drink. After a few samples, I went with the Breckenridge Christmas Ale. Yum! Aimee M also ended up getting a bottle of wine to share with the table.  The waiter showed us all the menu items (pictures) on their fancy schmancy iPad so I decided on the Steak & Frites. The steak was cooked to perfection, then I bit into the triple truffle fries and that was it. No questions asked, best fries on earth. Don't get me wrong, the steak was delicious but those triple truffle fries!!! Never had anything like them. I don't think I can get sick of saying that. HA! Aimee M had also ordered a side of truffle fries for the table. So after I finished mine I dug into hers. Well, the whole table did, and since those weren't enough we had to order one more side and then another for dessert. I mean, come on, who doesn't LOVE triple truffle fries for DESSERT! LOL Someone also ordered a side of shells and cheese for the table. Not sure who, but that's why I love this group, they enjoy food and beer as much as I do and they know how to share. =] The shells consisted of shells (obvi) fava beans, manchego cheese, prosciutto & breadcrumbs. Talk about comfort food! Those were gone quickly too. I got to try a little bit of everyone's meals which was nice.  Pricey? Yes, but if you go with a large group and share items, it's not as bad.

2015-03-17,3.0,"I was really looking forward to checking this place out when I saw that they described their menu as ""elevated street food"". In my head I was picturing it to be unique twists to dishes that were inspired by food carts from places ranging from NYC to Thailand. I'm still not sure how their actual menu items correspond to that motto. When I think of street food, I think of quick eats at a cheap price. Their menu items seemed a bit fancier and sophisticated, and definitely at a higher price point.  Ambiance: The restaurant had a small and cozy atmosphere, with only a couple seats at the bar and a few small tables on the side. It wasn't too busy when we went for dinner and our group ended up sitting at a larger picnic style table in the back.  Food: I didn't think the food was bad by any means. We enjoyed some of the dishes we ordered, but from a value standpoint I thought they were pretty expensive, and I wasn't even really blown away by any of the dishes. For example, we ordered the truffle fries, which were nice and crispy and pretty tasty overall. But it was $7 for a tiny bowl that barely had a handful of fries. We ended up having to put in another order because it was so small. Other dishes were good, but not very memorable. My friends and I typically like to order a bunch of things and then just get a taste of everything. For as much as we spent per person, I didn't feel as satisfied as some of the other restaurants I've visited with comparable prices.    Overall the food wasn't bad, but given how much the total bill was, I would expect the menu to be a bit more impressive.",0.9832,0.836,0.128,0.036,0.5360363247863248

Long story short, more than two and a half hours after our arrival, we were finally presented with the bill. There was no reasonable explanation for such a long dinner. I've enjoyed long meals when celebrating but this was not that. It was painfully, inexplicably slow. A small dining space and really no rationale for what transpired.  We were pumped to try this place after recent reviews inflated following a relaunch. Excellent. We were excited to be a part of the magic. However after an excruciating drawn-out experience, we were soured. Anyone who has had a decent meal at a decent restaurant, cannot possibly think our experience was ok.  We put in a few early orders. Out of those, some were immediately unavailable. Rabbit and octopus with an iPad-prompted run to check on sweetbreads' availability. Normally this would be fine but on an early Wednesday evening, the outages seemed unnecessary and excessive.  Great venue but clearly working hard to recoup the earlier reviews from before the relaunch. We were so pumped to try this place after the new chef in place. They struggled to meet the needs of our small party from the start. A loaf of bread was sent to the table after a 45 minute wait from arrival to appetizer. 45 minutes for a small loaf of bread, jam, and butter. Thank you, sir, for the refuge. 60 total minutes passed and the appetizers arrived. Well over an hour and 45 minutes passed and dinners had not yet arrived. Really, really not ok. Especially for a smaller place on a Wednesday night. Several orders of bread arrived and finally the food. So. Bizarre.  We're a chatty table so it was surprisingly initially unnoticed except for the one team member who arrived feeling hungry. A second round of drinks had to be heavily flagged. When food finally arrived, just the pork chops and sides prevailed. Another several minutes divides the two patrons and the other guests. The food arrived cold. Finally after a 10-15 minute wait between the first arrived dinner and the bouillabaisse, another dish arrived. It came with a flourish and a show but delayed dinner another 3-5 minutes. If your table waited for almost two hours (you've apologized maybe once or twice), it's time to drop the show and deliver a meal.  This is the strangest place. We were of three similarly sized tables with the others featuring several more guests. The bar was half-full and beyond this: NO OTHER GUESTS.

ALL the other tables left it was that bad. Did I mention we didn't finish until 11 pm? This is not Europe and we did not sign up for a 3.5 hour meal. To sum up the experience it was like a bad episode of Top Chef during restaurant wars when everything falls to pieces.  Some of the issues: * In the first hour all that we got was a single round of drinks. No water. Oh and I got the wrong drink. There was no offer to replace it with the correct one.  * I had to stop someone at the start of hour two and ask for water and the option to get more drinks. It took another 30 minutes. THREE times I went into the service area myself and got water for our table because it wasn't otherwise happening. Other tables did the same for things like silverware.  * When our first course came at 90 minutes in we only got three salads. The four other dishes came at the start of hour two after a second round of complaints. At this point two tables had walked out. We happened to have Cards Against Humanity with us and decided to just play a few rounds to pass the time.  * Our next several rounds of food came out half the table at a time like the earlier ones. Potatoes were cold, steak was good, dessert was inedible.  Now, here is my real issue. We were so nice to the service staff and manager. The manager looked like she was about to cry at several points. We told her not to worry, it was okay, etc. Again, we are one of only two tables that stayed through the meal. The rest left and planned on contesting charges with credit card companies. At the end we got the bill and it was $350 for the alcohol. I told the server/ manager that we would pay 20% tip directly to the server on the alcohol and would like them to give us 50% off the bill given the horrible service and ruined night. We had already paid $532 for the food. Several tables walked without paying the alcohol bill at all. We felt it would be fair to essential give us the alcohol at cost. We had a terrible meal, were trapped on NYE, and missed plans for the night.  Go back and read other single star reviews. You'll find the same comment I'm about to make. The owner is a colossal jerk. He stomps down asking what the problem is. The problem?! See above. He won't accept our offer and only takes the tip and 10% off and says he will take care of the server because it is his nephew. Sure. Whatever. Cue full on argument and him stating he is hunting down everyone who left that night. He then proceeds to tell us how we are wrong about the bill. He took NO ownership for the experience people had. He never apologized for the horrible food and service. He is one of those guys who WANTS to argue with you. I just cannot share how disrespectful he was after a disaster of a night. I wish we had just walked out like the other tables. Our mistake was giving this restaurant the benefit of the doubt.",-0.9883,0.795,0.077,0.129,0.48795952724524155

It took nearly an hour for my table of 4 to receive water and one round of drinks. After another hour 3 of 4 of us had received the first course,  a salad. We finally gave up after 2 1/2 hours. We asked to know what was going on,  and the wait staff seemed distraught and the place was in chaos. It's possible there was a crisis in the kitchen,  but at minimum we should be told that there is a problem and offered the choice of a refund or at least a drink while waiting. Whoever gave instructions to say they had no idea what was going on made a very bad mistake.

2014-12-06,5.0,"I'll be honest, I really didn't have high expectations of the Peasantry.  The menu seems a bit sparse and there wasn't anything that got me overly excited. Thursday night 7pm, there was only one other group there but by 8pm more people came in. We were able to make reservations but I guess somehow they got lost.  Luckily there was plenty of seating for us so the early folks were able to get seated immediately. The Peasantry was the November choice for my gals dinner group and what it just comes down to is a night out with my friends. So I figured I'd have some drinks, eat something and have a fun night out.  It was all that and more. Our server seemed to really want us to enjoy ourselves. Lots of drink suggestions, suggested pairings and even giving Osi V some taste testers to help her settle on her brew. Since dining experiences can be visually stimulating as well, he showed us pictures on his tablet of some of the entrees we were contemplating ordering. The wine I started off with for the night--Elm Tree Malbec--was a perfect drink for a cold night and I ended up getting a bottle to share with the table. It ended up being a perfect pairing for my meal.  I decided on the short rib--per their menu: braised bone-in local short rib, parsnip and english pea purees, roasted root vegetables & a demi-glace. I also ordered a side of their triple truffle fries to share. It was delicious. So well made, fall off the bone tender flavorful and I'm not ashamed to say after giving some of my table mates a portion to taste, I finished the rest off no problem.  I got to try some of the duck and that was also pretty stellar. The star of the table seemed to be the triple truffle fries. These are waffle fries with triple truffle flavor but none of the greasiness or heaviness when you think of fries.  You know you are part of group of kindred spirits when someone orders another order of triple truffle fries for dessert.  For the final course we shared the tempura banana cheesecake.  This was just OK to me. the flavors were excellent but it seemed kind of soggy to me. Honestly, another round of those triple truffle fries would have been welcomed again.  The menu is broken down into small plates and main meals. It can be pretty pricey or not depending on what you order and of course how much you drink.   I was really impressed that our bill came portioned out showing what each person ordered to help with splitting the bill.  Their brunch menu looked pretty fantastic, that might be worth another visit soon.",0.9986,0.761,0.214,0.025,0.569987080103359
2014-11-29,4.0,"The Peasantry exceeded my expectations.  A friend picked this place, and I wasn't really enthusiastic about it when I saw the menu online.  The Peasantry has a smaller menu, and it can get pricey depending on what you order (and if you're drinking), but most of the ingredients appear to be locally sourced.  Also, they have a new chef who is doing phenomenal things in the kitchen. I started with a cocktail, the French Orchard.  It was a delicious and refreshing gin-based drink , but also small and pricey.  The Peasantry isn't the kind of place that you will want to kick back and down a few drinks - but it's perfect for one tasty, well-made cocktail. The steak frites with triple truffle fries was my choice of entree.  Every bit was fantastic, and although the steak frites were a bit cold, they were cooked medium-well just as I had requested.  I know chefs prefer to cook steaks medium, but I just. can't. do. it. The triple truffle fries are THE BEST truffle fries I have EVER had.  Truffle salt, truffle butter, truffle oil.  I keep telling my husband that I will try to duplicate this at home.  I devoured the side that came with my steak, and my friends were all fans too.  I don't know how or when this transpired, but suddenly I looked up and there were two or three MORE sides of truffle fries at our table.  They're so good that you might want to skip dessert. Everyone else's entrees also looked really good, especially the duck and the short rib.  I would say the portions here are average; you will not need a to-go container, but you won't leave hungry either. We ended the meal sharing the award-winning banana cheesecake.  It was tempura-fried and was garnished with nuts and something else.  I only had two bites, but after stuffing myself with truffle fries, two bites was plenty! I spent about $40 on my meal (including tax), which included one cocktail and my entree.  Others spent upwards of $50, but that included some side dishes and/or shared bottles of wine. The interior of the restaurant is like a cozy farmhouse, perfect for a small group or intimate dining for two.",0.9953,0.84,0.147,0.012,0.5497948232323233
2014-11-25,5.0,"The Peasantry is not a very economical dining option for a near-pauper's pocketbook but, if you pinch your pennies, it's not unattainable. A member of our ladies dining group chose this place for the November 2014 dinner on a Thursday night. After browsing an older menu, a few of us were unsure if it was something to get excited about, and we considered changing venues when the person who picked it dropped out due to illness. However, we're a pretty versatile bunch, so we followed through with our original plans and I'm very glad we did! I arrived about 30 minutes early and found some confusion had occurred when reservations had been made. We'd accidentally reserved twice and canceled one, which somehow resulted in our reservation being lost completely. However, the restaurant was not very busy this particularly cold weeknight, so they were able to seat me immediately with enough room for our party of five. Before I knew it, I had a delicious Bourbon Cocktail #9 (I'm not normally a whiskey drinker) in hand, and I didn't mind waiting alone for the rest of the group because our server chatted with me. The drink decision wasn't very labor intensive. I asked for a recommendation and was pleased with it. My friends showed up shortly and we took a look at the somewhat small but well rounded beer list. I ended up ordering a glass of the Breckenridge Christmas Ale, as did a few of my drinking companions. They will let you sample the tap selection before making your final decision. Aimee M also had a glass of the Elm Tree Malbec, which I was a big fan of, and we eventually ordered a bottle to split. It went well with everything we ate. I had trouble deciding between the Beef Wellington and the Duck. One of the nice things about service is that our waiter used a tablet to take our order and he was able to pull up the menu and show us photos of the food on the spot. There was not a photo of the Duck since it's a newer item, but he showed me the Steak Frites and said it was arranged similarly. I went with the Duck, because Beef Wellington seems to be a standard item and this was seasonal, and believe it was the best dish of the night. I also had the chance to taste my friends' Short Rib, which came in at a close second, the Pork Chop, and the Steak Frites. I also had a side of Shells & Cheese. I'd never have thought to add fava beans to macaroni and cheese, but it worked! We pulled a Hobbit and ordered more Triple Truffle Fries for first dessert. Second dessert consisted of the Cheesecake, which is tempura battered banana cheesecake with fruit, nuts, and caramel sauce. It was very decadent and reminded me of fried ice cream. At the of the evening, they were able to split our bill. Everyone's cost was different depending on what all was ordered individually. For this dinner the range was $40-75 (before tip) for a full experience with all the bells and whistles. Considering that it's a top contender for best meal of the year, I'd say it's well worth it.

2014-11-15,4.0,"The Lakeview/Lincoln Park food tour continues, this time with a Friday night dinner at the Peasantry! A friend and I came in around 5:30pm, and it was pretty quiet - only one other group in the restaurant. I ordered the steak frites - steak with a side of their triple truffle fries - and my friend had the rabbit risotto. The steak was cooked to a perfect medium rare (though it was sliced up as opposed to being served as a whole steak, so it got cold kind of quickly while I was eating it). It was definitely delicious though. The fries were also amazing - they're called triple truffle fries because they're flavored with truffle in three ways: truffle butter, truffle salt, and truffle oil. Super good and just the right portion size. We split the cheesecake dessert, which is a bit of a misnomer since it's not really a cake - it's sort of cheesecake filling dipped in tempura batter and deep fried. So it's actually way better than actual cheesecake. We were raving about this dessert between every bite - it came with a salted caramel and rum-soaked raisins and was awesome. The only thing that's keeping it from five stars in my book is the price - most entrees will run you 20+, and while the food was great, it wasn't special enough in my book to merit a total dinner bill of $60 for two people. That being said, I really enjoyed the meal and service was great, so I could realistically see myself returning. The brunch menu looked pretty intriguing, so maybe that's what I'll come back for next time.",0.9949,0.804,0.188,0.008,0.6161255411255411

On this visit, the food was mostly quite good, and the music a little quieter and more enjoyable. We had small plates, and enjoyed all three. Beet carpaccio was a standout -- beautifully presented, nice combination of flavors. Stuffed saddle of rabbit over mushroom risotto was superb comfort food, tender and tasty. Shrimp & grits was quite nice with corn salsa and bacon lardons. The only food let-downs were a banana cheesecake dessert (promising premise, but the tempura bananas were cold and starting to sog), and vapid cappuccino. Service was friendly and showed evidence of good training regarding attentiveness & inquiry. Pacing was a little odd compared to last visit (when the food came quickly but servers weren't very attentive). This evening, drinks came quickly, but food plates took longer than I'd expect -- no big deal since we weren't in a hurry, but odd. I was disappointed in the wine service on this visit. We were informed that wines by the glass were half-price, which sounded good, since prices on the menu were in the $12-13 range (with bottles priced in the $40s and up). However, the pours were skimpy, so the ""special"" did not represent a particularly good value. Additionally, I later checked the online menu, and found that it completely different, with much more affordable prices by the glass and bottle ($6-10 glasses, $24-42 bottles). It makes me think the ""special"" is kind of phony. Whatever.

Ambiance: The interior has not changed, however, I liked the ambiance the first time and wouldn't think that was something that they needed to improve. I like the rustic and trendy vibe they have.  They also have these huge windows they open up when it is nice outside which I'd imagine would be lovely to sit by with a cocktail, dessert, and your main squeeze.  Additionally, as a side note- I really enjoyed the music they were playing (who doesn't like a little Johnny Cash) and it was being played at an appropriate volume to have a conversation while dining. Drinks: The Peasantry has loads of cool and delicious sounding cocktails, a wine list, a whiskey list, and a large variety of unique beers.  Our waiter was knowledgeable about types of beers and was able to help us make a choice after listening to the types of beers we usually like.   My husband and I both went with wheat beers which we liked and were fairly priced ($5 and $6).   Food: The Peasantry offers both small plates and large plates.  With the help of our waiter, my husband and I decided to share two small plates and a large plate.  Our waiter pointed out some of the small plates that were more filling so that we'd leave full.  We had the shrimp and grits which was phenomenal.  I will definitely return again to have more of those shrimp and grits!!  It was cheesy, the shrimp were huge and fresh, and extremely flavorful.  We also ordered the shells and cheese which is basically adult mac and cheese which were also yummy and rich.  Additionally, we decided to share Bouillabaisse which was like a seafood stew with three mussels, one jumbo prawn, a piece of king crab leg, and skate wing in a lobster broth.  The fish was fresh and the skate wing was very tender and light tasting and the broth was flavorful.  The Bouillabaisse was also a nice presentation where the chopped veggies, seafood, and broth were added to the bowl at the table.  Definitely a fun experience.  After eating those three dishes my husband and I were feeling pretty full, but were determined to try a dessert.  We ended up having the panna cotta which was their seasonal dessert.  It had peaches, candied mint.... I don't even know, but it was amazing!  Very unique but delicious flavors that lingered after you finished.  In all, I was satisfied to extremely satisfied with each dish I tried at The Peasantry. Staff: Our waiter, Jacob, was extremely helpful and attentive the entire time we were there.  He made great suggestions, was extremely polite, and timed the items we ordered perfectly (he checked to see if we needed more time between dishes or if we were ready for the next).   Our water glasses were always filled, plates and silverware were switched between courses, and we were checked on more than once to assure everything was going well.  We were also able to talk with Alexander, the owner, and he was super friendly and eager to impress his customers (we were).   So, if you went here before the changes, seriously, try it again for unique, delicious food that is competitively priced.  We are looking forward to returning again soon!",0.9985,0.807,0.183,0.01,0.6359699479264695

The place was pretty quiet on a Thursday evening.  We had a watermelon salad that we really enjoyed, but things really went downhill from there.  We ordered the Salmon Flatbread, and were surprised when it came out with no salmon on it.   We questioned the server who was a little flustered and went back to the kitchen. She comes out a few minutes later with a bowl with some pieces of salmon that the kitchen ""forgot"" to put on the flatbread.... ok... whatever. She apologizes up and down, says the kitchen is making a new one. 10 minutes later she comes back, says the chef asked if we ""really wanted a new one, or if we could eat the one they originally sent out?"" Um, what? I mean, I can understand honest mistakes (it's not like they were busy, but it happens), but seriously, asking if we can just eat the plain flatbread and bowl of cold salmon? So weird!   I don't think this place will be around much longer.  It was pretty empty on a Thursday night, the food was ok and the service was bad.  It's too bad b/c it really had a lot of promise when it opened!",-0.5917,0.775,0.103,0.122,0.5021701710987426

The braised goat chilaquiles were a hit with a family friend who's actually from Mexico, so they must have been good.  The eggs (my sister got scrambled, my mother fried) are also great, apparently, and the grilled toast comes with an amazing homemade blackberry jam.  My father ordered the ploughman's platter (bacon, eggs, chorizo, toast) and thought everything was very good except for the chorizo, which was only passable.

Should have sent them back, but decided not to.   We finished with the pork shoulder which had literally no taste and was extremely fatty.

2014-05-25,3.0,"It's been awhile since we stopped in here, living so close on a nice day it is usually pretty busy and hard to get  a spot. No reservations. Thursday evening was relatively quiet about three tables at 7 p.m. This allowed us to have great service.  The back wall is one large bench shared by everyone. If you are smaller sit on the chair side or you may feel uncomfortable not being able to adjust your seating position. The staff were very helpful. We had several questions about the food ingredients and when they didn't know the answer they went and found out. Go early or wait for a table, the bar is fun to sit at as well. They have a great rotating ""better"" craft beer list. They only have about three wines offered by the glass, more by the bottle. An eclectic menu that changes so check back often. For my main I had the Cheese and Oyster  Mushroom Flatbread. Some of my favorite flavors/food are truffle and mushroom. Unfortunately, many times restaurants pair these flavors with a strong funky cheese or goat cheese. I cannot eat goat cheese or funky cheese (I have an enzyme in my mouth that makes it very fowl tasting). I thought I was safe with their ingredients listed on the menu. The flatbread is about the size of a large serving plate with nice crust. A bit thicker than most. The greens had a healthy dose of truffle oil and it smelled soooooo good! I couldn't wait to take a bite. Once I did, I soon had a fowl, moldy taste in my mouth. I questioned what type of cheese they had used and was told that sometimes the chef changes it up. They confirmed it was a cow cheese but classified it as funky. I was so sad, my senses were conflicting, the truffle oil was making me salivate but I knew if I took a bit my taste buds would be repulsed. Instead I picked the greens off the top and ate around the edges. I gave the cheesy pieces to my boyfriend. Advice, don't always take the menu as is, question all ingredients if you know you don't like something.  I was happy I had started off with the buratta salad. Yum! It comes with three large mounds of buratta decorated with  veggies and some olives. I could have had done without the extras. I don't feel it added anything to the buratta, it was so good the buratta didn't need any help. I left the ornaments for my boyfriend and savored the buratta. It was fresh, the skin soft and a very creamy inside. Perfect. My boyfriend went with the Brussels sprouts side salad as a starter. It's a good size for an appetizer. The shredded sprouts are mixed lightly with almost an Asian flair. Not too spicy. He also had the lobster roll special. I am not sure how long they will have this, so we had to try it. It's a nice sized roll, on a split bun with chunks of lobster and lots of sauce. He devoured it not even offering me a taste.",0.9814,0.829,0.11,0.061,0.5515262515262516

The first time I came here the food was so salty that I had a hard time eating it...and that was every single dish. Usually, my boyfriend and I will get an appetizer, an entree, and a dessert to share. Against my better judgement, we returned. The next few times I loved every single part of my food. I have met the owner a few times and he is always very friendly and the waitstaff have been nothing but great. The second to the last time I was there they had introduced their longer cocktail list. The bees knees is FANTASTIC...but some of the others...are awful. Their beer and wine suggestions are always pretty good. My boyfriend actually researched all over Chicago to buy a six pack of a beer he tried here. Also, whenever we get their specials that are written on the board, they are FANTASTIC. Their juniper tartare was the best tartare I have ever had. My boyfriend has loved all their burgers ( that's what he usually sticks to) but we have shied away from the flat bread because of our initial over salinated experience. However, the last time I was there really was bad. We now know how to maneuver around the menu, avoiding certain things so it wasn't that bad. The beef potpie was warm and hearty ( no veggies at all though) and the beet salad was good and the farm burger was FANTASTIC.

The braised ox tail pasta had really well flavored and tender beef, although the pasta itself was too hard. I don't even mean that it was al dente...it was actually quite hard. The duck confit flatbread was pretty good too, with wonderfully tender duck breast combined with a wild selection of ingredients like curried squash puree, pickled cranberries, and bleu cheese. Kind of strange combinations but pretty good in taste. The mussels were also to our liking.

""i'm looking at the Ramen Tonkotsu, is the pork fried? no? i'll take it. someone from the kitchen brings out the truffle fries ""a little too long"" later. either sous or prep? we try it. it's fries. i did enjoy the scent of the truffle oil. i read other people's reviews as being very aromatic in the restaurant. meh, i didn't really smell much of it. let's just say that they were texturally perfect waffle fries. a little while longer and out comes our main dishes. the chef brings them out. says the name of the dishes, smiles, asks if he can get anything else for us, leaves. my girlfriend offers me a bite of her oxtail pasta, it's great! however, i was still staring at my ramen. this is when it started to go downhill. before my ramen was served i was served with a saucer full of sesame seed oil and black chilli paste with a pair of cheap metal chopsticks that were BENT. so i assumed that the saucer was for the ramen and i began to straighten out the bent chopsticks. i misunderstood the ramen. i read TONKATSU instead of TONKOTSU. hence i asked if the pork was fried. i didn't like it. growing up i've had my share of different korean and japanese ramen, and different korean and japanese versions of Tonkatsu. and i really disliked the Tonkotsu. the pork bone marrow broth ramen. eww. it was my bad. i misordered. i took a bite and called our nice waitress over. i told her it wasn't what i thought i had ordered and would like to send it back and to order a different item off of the menu, which was the Wild Boar Burger. i didn't even ask for a comp. minutes later i find this big face five inches away from my face and starts speaking to me with, ""hey, so i heard you didn't like our Ramen Tonkatsu and i would love to know why."" ""i had a different understanding of what it was, i don't like it."" ""well, i can bring out the chef to you and you can debate the authenticity of the ramen with him because he's Japanese from Hawaii."" ""if you're inviting me to debate with your chef, i will decline. i just want to eat my food, pay, and leave. i'm really hungry and i'm sure he's busy."" ""you know what, i don't understand your attitude, i'm going to bring your ramen back out and you're going to finish it!"" i got up, told my girlfriend that we're leaving. this random guy threatens to call the police on me for not paying, calls the police. chef comes out, greets me and my girlfriend. his name is Don. the japanese from hawaii as the random guy called him. he starts explaining to me about tonkatsu. i tell him i'm korean/japanese, my mother's a chef, i misread the a/o in the ENGLISH writing, and i finally ask him ""who the fuck is this guy getting all up in my face? he gets in my face, instigates me to debate with you about the authenticity of the ramen? and when i refuse he brings back the bowl the server took and tells me that i have to finish it?"" Don is almost in tears and asks us to ""please come by again"" over and over again. as if these altercations happen frequent. all in the while, this guy is hopping from table to table slandering me! my girlfriend was so in shock she couldn't say anything. i head to the front, guy gets in front of me, PUSHES ME, and tells me i'm not leaving. cops get there. he gets in my face again ""you come to my restaurant, i demand respect!"" ""if you came to MY place, i'd at least give you my fucking name! you instigate a debate with your chef, insult me in front of your other customers and demand to get paid?"" random guy = Alexander, the owner. the food is confusing and information isn't transparent, service is entry level, price is high for what they offer, and the owner is from a failed episode of Kitchen Nightmares. i feel sorry for Don who has to work for a 3/5 star restaurant. he was the only human being in there.",0.959,0.872,0.069,0.059,0.4546825396825398

We sat at the bar and started with the braised lamb bun (which was SO GOOD I could have eaten three more) and the frogs legs which had good flavor and crunch as well. We also had the charcuterie which was awesome. Our favorite item on the board was the chicken liver mousse but all the pickled accoutrements were on point as well. For our entree we shared the oxtail pasta. Maybe the kitchen was having issues with the pasta-making that day because it was nearly inedible. Both my boyfriend and I agreed that all the noodles were inconsistent and chewy so much so that it should not have been served to guests. Pre-made boxed pasta would have been better than that. (Although the oxtail itself was flavorful and delicious). What made our experience, though was the bartender. (I think her name was Amy) She was so helpful, friendly, gave some awesome drink recommendations, and just made our time there really enjoyable.

2013-12-19,2.0,"Living right down the street from this place, I had wanted to try it for some time. Unfortunately I didn't have the best experience and was really let down. I came for dinner with two friends on a Wednesday night at 7pm and should have taken it as a sign when walking in that there were only 4 other people in the restaurant.  I was recommended the Bourbon Joe by the waiter, a bourbon drink with coffee, among other things. I told him I wasn't really a bourbon drinker but since he was recommending it, I said I would give it a try. It really wasn't my thing, I honestly couldn't have more than three sips of it. I never send drinks back when at a restaurant, but since this guy had suggested it even knowing I had said bourbon wasn't my favorite, I told him so and ordered a beer instead. (Later I found that I was still charged for $10 for the Bourbon Joe and another waitress told me it's their policy that if a drink or food item is sent back because of ""taste"" then it's not taken off the tab. I thought that was a little ridiculous since the waiter had suggested it and I took him as reliable in his recommendations, but then that I would still be charged. A more upscale restaurant would remove it from your tab, especially since I was ordering another drink and never drank the Bourbon Joe.) We ordered the Green Curry appetizer which came with 6 very small pita bread chips, along with very watery curry. You honestly couldn't eat the stuff, and the solid lentils and orzo had sunken to the bottom. It was awkward and not that good. Then, because there were 3 of us and only 6 pieces of bread, the waiter asked if we wanted more. We said, ""Sure!"" Later we found out we had been charge $1 for ""bread."" Really? Does Maggiano's charge for more bread? Do Mexican restaurants charge for more tortilla chips? I thought the $1 made them seem extremely stingy and cheap, and was just kind of an insult to me. Again, we asked the waitress about this and she just said, ""Well because he asked you and you said yes, then you were charged."" Wait, what? Ridiculous. The entrees themselves were also sub-par. I ordered the mushroom pasta, which for $15 was not worth it at all. My friend ordered the burger for $15 and that was all he got, no sides or fries or anything. SO not worth a $15 burger, I'd rather go to Kuma's if I'm spending that on a burger. My other friend ordered the Lamb Hot Pockets which looked fine, but she wasn't commenting on whether they were great or not. We also ordered the truffle fries for $7 and the brussel sprouts side for $7, both of which were fine. Overall, I was very disappointed in the quality of the food. They're charging too much and then while their staff is friendly, they're not very knowledgeable of the menu items to explain the foods, flavors, etc to make you maybe realize why they're that expensive. I was also very turned off by how cheap they seemed to be in charging for a drink that had been recommending by their staff and then $1 for bread.

The mussel bake was about the same as every other pot of mussels in the States (if you are in Brussels get some mussels and be blown away).  The highlight for me was the oxtail pasta, but I love me some arrabiata sauce (or its close cousin ametriciana).  Dessert was some kind of strange pecan pie bar.  I think the ice cream and marscapone served with it stole the show. Anyways, it's pricey for the portion sizes and really did nothing to cement it in our minds as worthy of a repeat visit.  You really need at least one superb dish and unless we completely missed out mark, they don't have one.",0.9379,0.799,0.133,0.068,0.5617647058823529
2013-12-16,5.0,"Since this is a place to talk about food, drinks, and service, I'll start by saying brunch on Sunday was excellent as always.  Chef, love your new expressions on the menu.  Sorry, I haven't tried everything yet but I'm getting there.  Alexander, new cocktails look and taste great, happy to see so much local spirits and beer.   Now to business: In response to Mr. Jeremy S and his post from earlier today, I too once started a Yelp account to vent about an unpleasant experience I had.  I let loose at the ownership and went on about how they were losing out on future business.  With that in mind, I felt compelled to watch for your threatened Yelp review after witnessing your behavior at Peasantry yesterday afternoon.  I'm not here to talk about your brunch experience nor speculate on your conversation with the owner (other than the parts I couldn't help but overhear), I just wanted to point out to you and others some observations from a 3rd party perspective. First, the owner did not approach you, you approached the two of us and interrupted our conversation and started your own.  While I didn't catch your opening words, I did manage to get your condescending tone and your immediate promise that none of you would be returning.  It probably didn't occur to you that the owner was also the person making your drinks, and referring repeatedly to the Hot Toddy as ""Theraflu"" was not the most tactful way of getting him to but it for you.  It also brings your ""Foodie"" status into question.  Foodies usually know what Hot Toddy's are.  And while ""Theraflu"" isn't a typical flavor descriptor for Chamomile, lemon juice, honey, and booze, it does give one a pretty good idea of what the drink will taste like. You also asked him how he expected to get any repeat business.  This was where you probably lost the support of everyone still in the place, since it was full of regular diners and brunch goers.  I say, ""everyone still in the place,"" because 3 of your 4 guests waited for you outside, perhaps choosing not to be associated with the guy causing a scene at brunch.   I'm not sure if it was you or one of your friends that mentioned that the food was amazing and the service was excellent, but since your review didn't contain this information and it was the nicest thing said, I thought I should include it here.   As a self-proclaimed ""Foodie,"" you should appreciate a local establishment that doesn't charge you an arm and a leg for a cocktail (anticipating comps into the menu price from other guests that don't understand the drinks), especially when you're dealing with a mom n' pop place with a handful of tables versus a large corporate chain with endless cash flow.  Most people would tell you off and be glad you're not coming back; me, I'd rather you didn't miss out, since despite the Theraflu incident the rest of your brunch seemed to go quite well.  Have some perspective & soda, come back any Sunday, and I'll buy you your first Theraflu, I mean Bloody Mary.",0.9917,0.825,0.122,0.054,0.5395784125435288

2013-11-23,4.0,"The Peasantry is a great place that often exceeds expectations but sometimes slightly disappoints. This restaurant seems more experimental in its food offerings, so I think the occasional disappointment is to be expected. Given that I've been there about 20 times since it opened (which partially has to do with proximity), I really am a fan of this place, but am inclined to lean toward 4 stars because of the occasional letdown. The menu changes often, but here are some specifics about what I've had in the past: Mussel Bake - mussels served in a tangy, lemony broth that has all sorts of other stuff swimming around in it like (very tasty) sausage, fingerling potatoes, and corn on the cob. Served with slightly charred baguette. Excellent dish. Octopus Chorizo Flatbread - another huge hit. Flatbread is tender and delicious, almost like a good piece of naan. Octopus and chorizo mixed with a spicy mayo, fingering potatoes, and grapes (if I recall correctly). I've had it a few times and love it. Goat Curry - a well-spiced curry bursting with flavor, accompanied with really good naan. Very filling, but listed as a starter. Extremely spicy. Duck Burger - juicy duck burger mixed with apricot and topped with foie gras and arugula. Also a huge hit. Shellfish Paella - my friend had this and was disappointed. Said it was somewhat bland, and did not like that it was pretty much rice topped with seafood, instead of having it all mixed in like a traditional paella. Of course, this restaurant often specializes in ""deconstructed"" food, so the latter point is not too surprising. Sous Vide Turkey Leg (less classy: Turkey in Bag in Hot Water) - I'm guessing this is a Thanksgiving special. The turkey was very unremarkable and the cornbread-leek pudding was decent, but very gooey. Shaved brussel sprouts were great. Picked cranberries were as well, and almost singlehandedly redeemed the dish. Not recommended. Truffle Fries - most people seem to love these, but I personally could never get into them because I generally find waffle fries to be a little greasy.  Gyoza (deep fried) - crunchy, quite good. Brunch - pretty good. Portion size can be extremely variable, so make sure you know what you're getting if you're hungry. Standouts are the bacon-chocolate waffle, sweet potato pancakes, and chorizo-octopus breakfast flatbread. Excellent fresh-squeezed OJ. Drinks - the draft selection isn't huge, but always has some very unique offerings (that change constantly), such as Dark Horse Scotty Karate and Coney Island BA Human Blockhead. The owner keeps his eye out for good beer. I've never tried a cocktail here, but people generally say the offerings are great. Service - once you're at a table, the service is excellent. If you're waiting for a table and want to order a drink at the bar, it can be pretty difficult because the bartender is always very busy preparing drinks for the tables. The owner, who is from Australia, is almost always there and is very cool and friendly. Seating - the seating along the wall consists of a very narrow bench with a stiff cushion that sticks into your lower back. You get used to it, but it's pretty uncomfortable! Graciously offer those seats to your less-in-the-know friends. Overall, I think this is an excellent restaurant, but given its experimental nature, there is some risk involved, meaning you won't necessarily be satisfied every time - on the other hand, there will also be times when everything is amazing. I would give this restaurant 4.25 stars out of 5, which I will round down to a 4.",0.9993,0.726,0.233,0.041,0.5616366627951994

2013-09-15,5.0,"I started coming to the Peasantry last week and so far I've already been 4 times. I normally camp out at the nearby next door cafe to read and muse about innovation. I am absolutely in love with the neighborhood that I am at (even as I write this review) because it has everything I need (cafe, haircuts, drugs, clothes, booze, groceries) but especially because I can take my pick from a group of great places to eat. Had Empanadas the day before and Korean, Austrian, Lebanese, Italian, and Indian food was a bit too far to walk so I pulled out Yelp to see if anything was close by.  It found the Peasantry.  Took a peak and walked in because the interior suited my taste of clean, simple, wooden.  Every time I have come to the Peasantry except for dinner yesterday was during brunch.  Every thing that I have had eaten here has been absolutely delicious (The Bone and Marrow Burger, the Curried Breakfast Flatbread, The Pork Belly Sandwich).  Every thing that I have drank here has been phenomenal as well (White Russians, a fortified Digestif wine that tasted great and settled my stomach, a shandy with an amazing blond ale)  There are things around me that never will change. McDonald's, Chipotle will always serve the same Big Mac or Burrito I can eat in a hurry. Clubs like the Mid or Castle will always try to make money off their bottle service and there will always be people there for better or worse. I will always be able to buy a Coke almost anywhere.  While these things that don't change are convenient, they become boring, predictable  That's why I don't check in when I go to a Walgreens or a bank. The places I do check-in are restaurants, bars/lounges, and cafes that offer an experience I know I cannot get easily elsewhere.  The Peasantry does that for me. What if you could make a White Russian without Kahlua? What if you could turn the Kimchi vegetable into a aoli? What could we do to make a Bloody Mary an experience and not just a drink commodity item? It brings all these ideas to life.  We need restaurants that preserve great homemade family recipes that are passed down generation after generation. We also need places that can excite our tastes in ways in which we did not previously know. I happily put The Peasantry into the latter category and challenge to continue their innovations in cooking.  I'm off because I heard something about a Mako shark.

Our waitress was happy to tell us about the options, but I probably would have ordered another beer if the list was on our table. For an appetizer, we had the goat curry and it was fantastic.

2013-09-05,4.0,"I have only been here, twice, for brunch. I wanted to try something adventurous and not your standard pancakes and bacon fare.  The first time I went I ordered the Blueberry Belgium Waffle. OMG yummy!!! I am a huge fan of lemon pastries, and they definitely did not skimp on the lemon curd . The blueberries were fresh and delicious. It was amazing and I would definitely get this again.  The second time I met with some girlfriends for brunch and I ordered the Roasted Beef Hash. I was expecting more meat, something substantial as I was very hungry. While it was delicious and the flavors went well, I would have loved for it to have more poblano crema. The bread that it came with was a bit hard and I would have preferred something softer or maybe even some toast on the side that I could put jelly on.  I also had a mimosa, it was a little small for the price and I didn't enjoy it too much. But I will say, try the bloody mary. It was a great balance of tomato and vodka, with a hint of celery salt with every sip. They accessorized it with a purple block of blue cheese, two pickled scallion leaves and a chunk of smoked pork sausage. Looked like a mini-burger on a stick and very tasty, although I probably would have preferred my sausage warm.  I would go back for a bloody mary and another belgium waffle :)",0.9882,0.759,0.192,0.049,0.5629310344827586

Decor is charming and rustic, and we (surprisingly!) had no issues getting a table for 6 on a Saturday around noon. We had heard they served a Bloody Mary with a slider as its garnish, but were disappointed to hear that they had since changed it to a grilled shrimp garnish. We all ordered one, and didn't learn until the drinks were brought out that, actually, they were out of shrimp (?!). Annoying. If you're hoping for standard brunch fare, don't come here. The menu is comprised of seemingly mismatched pairings (a blueberry waffle with pesto sauce) and combinations not usually found at brunch. A friend ordered the blueberry/pesto dish, and it was surprisingly delicious and well-balanced. I ordered the octopus hash, which was equally good. My only small complaint was that it was slightly greasy, but otherwise, I would absolutely order it again. Some other friends had the brunch dogs and all seemed to love them.

Food was decent (upside is creativity, downside a bit over the top, seemingly complex for complexity's sake, not always adding flavor). Had a decked out hot dog, while D had bone marrow burger. Both fine for the $ but not mind-blowing, given all the detail provided about quality. The most annoying aspect of the experience was the service. Attentive enough (barely so), but our server argued with us about our preferred temp of the burger and essentially ignored us, bringing us the temp ""the chef prefers."" Ordered a Spanish wine that the server had no clue how to pronounce, and seemed put off by having to learn which one I was ordering. I guess I just don't see good execution of the concept: elevated street food, I assume, refers to Peasantry's efforts to take beloved street food and carry it to a new level in terms of freshness, unique flavors and creative combinations. Visually the plates achieve the look, but to me, at least with the dog and burger, the taste falls short of the mark (more ordinary than original). About the only thing ""elevated"" was the attitude of our server. Might give it another shot, but not sure.",-0.719,0.827,0.075,0.097,0.603932178932179

It also had this very greasy piece of unidentified meat under th tough biscuit that was nearly unflavored, but saturated in grease.  It seemed like leftover meat.   I don't know, but it was not good tasting.  Aside from being not tasty, I was left feeling very hungry and very poor as the menu is rather pricy.

When the check came, we noticed that a beer we had sent back because it was cloying sweet was still on the bill. A simple error, I thought. When I told our waitress, she sheepishly said, ""The manager doesn't let us take drinks off the bill."" ""But we never drank it,"" I said. ""I know, I'm sorry,"" she said. ""Let me speak to him,"" I said. She went over and told him that we wanted to talk to him and he proceeded to spend five minutes bantering with patrons at the bar. Finally, I approached him. I explained the situation and that she had taken away our drink after a single sip with no mention that it would stay on the bill. He insisted that he couldn't refund the $7. I told him that I thought it was normal in Chicago for beers to be refunded when a customer rejects it on the basis of taste. (I've had servers spontaneously offer to take beers I didn't like off the bill many times.) He said it was not normal. I was at a loss. I then asked him (impolitely) whether he knew anything about customer service. He then got in my face--yes, he actually did this in the middle of the restaurant with patrons watching in shock--and shouted, ""Yes, I was in marketing for 20 years! Do you know anything about paying for your food like an adult?!"" What was I to do? Call the cops? So, I paid for the $7 beer THAT I NEVER DRANK and then stood outside of Peasantry for five minutes to warn potential patrons.

Seriously?  I asked the waiter if there were hidden cameras.  After 10 minutes, he returned again and said that we could order another dish.  We ordered  the mushroom pasta, which was amazing.  When we got the check, the were told that we would be charged for the Anchovy pasta because they had to throw it away.  I really felt bad for the waiter because it was clearly not his fault or his decision.  I told the waiter to have the manger come over and talk to me directly to clear up any confusion.  He returned with the Anchovy Pasta removed from the bill.  It was completely unnecessary to harass customers over a bad pasta dish.  Especially when everything else that I have had on the menu has been amazing.  I loved this place and looked forward to returning frequently.

Highly focused on things local, seasonal, and house made (including condiments, breads, and cured meats) much in the style of their sister restaurant it should come as no surprise that the menu is one of the more eclectic in Chicago and while I personally find such an approach both daring and interesting it became clear within moments of seating that others do not as our server, Vanessa, shouting over one of the loudest dining rooms I've ever experienced had to field an inordinate amount of questions, requests, and modifications from tables both left and right; the best by far being a skinny 20-something female inquiring as to whether the PORK AND PANCETTA waffle could be made ""lower fat""...a request that would have led to me to telling her to get out (and hence the reason I'm not a waiter) and one that made me really wish there was more than a few inches between tables as we were privy to this woman's banal conversation for the next sixty minutes. Moving past the seating and acoustics to what really matters the vast majority of what we sampled from The Peasantry was not only unique, but very well priced and prepared when taking into account the portion size and quality of ingredients.  Obviously attempting to incorporate both sweet and savory into each plate I particularly enjoyed the French toast as the sweet custard soft brioche was beautifully caramelized on the exterior and nicely balanced by the nutty cream.  Additionally impressive was the Biscuits and Gravy that, although featuring both spicy red-eye gravy and rich, liver laden duck pate came off as rather light thanks to the flaky crumpet and bright, assertive chutney.   Certainly not a place for the unadventurous, those needing an excessive caffeine fix (no drip coffee, no refills,) or those looking for a quiet and leisurely breakfast I'd happily return to The Peasantry for either brunch or dinner, though in the future I'd undoubtedly target off-hours or request one of the centrally located tables as opposed to the booths along the wall.",0.9967,0.846,0.139,0.015,0.45848517643972186

For an area saturated with hamburgers and fast-casual restaurants, it is an excellent, distinct addition to the Diversey & Clark area. It got through its infancy well, but can still be a bit hit or miss. My favorite thing here is the Rabbit Tagliatelle - homemade pasta with braised rabbit in a brown sauce (used sparingly, not drowned). Paired with a good glass of cab, it's awesome on a cold night. My boo was a fan of the duck burger until they took it off the menu, but I've been told the bone marrow burger has its merits. On our last visit here, we tried the duck wings - largely because our previous favorites are no longer on the menu. These did not disappoint, though. The duck wings are served with a buttermilk sauce thinner than ranch dressing and a cherry compote of sorts. Duck can be a hard thing to get right, and this had the proper, just-crispy-enough texture. Quite good. The Cellar, their basement dining room, has a little more intimate of atmosphere than the community-oriented main dining room. When we ate down there, the service was pooled - two waiters working the entire room without one being dedicated to a table.

I like to browse menus online before I go to the actual restaurant, so I'd already decided I wanted the baby octopus gyro before I even got to The Peasantry. But when I sat down and started looking over the menu I ran into a problem: literally 90% of the other things on the menu sounded awesome too. What's a girl to do?  In the end I stuck with my gut, and I'm so happy I did. The octopus was cooked perfectly, and the bread it comes on is incredible. It's sort of like a naan, but also sort of like a crepe- one of my friends said he was going to go stage at the restaurant just so he could get the recipe. The cocktail menu is also really interesting (obviously, since Steele DePew from the Aviary put it together- though I still think his name is made up), and the gin was delicious with well balanced hibiscus- which so often can go so wrong.

2013-03-11,2.0,"Food: 4 Stars Service: 1 Star Atmosphere: 2 Stars I really, really wanted to like The Peasantry, but it unfortunately fell short across so many levels on a recent Friday night trip. My boyfriend and I arrived around 6pm to meet another couple for drinks and dinner. Upon arriving, the restaurant was well staffed and only a few tables were taken. We were able to pick our seats, so we chose a table in lieu of the communal seats in the center of the restaurant. The table was nestled back by the kitchen and around a short corner from the bar, so we saw a lot of the action of the restaurant. While we were waiting for our friends to arrive, we asked waitress #1 (this comes into play later) if they had a draught list since only bottles were listed on the menu and cocktails were on a separate rotating list on the table. The waitress informed us that the options were on the chalkboard behind the bar or she could go find her iPad mini for us to look at. We told her that we'd check out the beer listings ourselves and put in our drinks when she came back. In the meantime, our friends arrived and put in their drink orders. They were out of one of their specialty cocktails (which was essentially a unique Manhattan) so she opted for a beer on the bottle list, which they were also out of. Fast forward a few more hiccups (and several long minutes) later to a new specialty cocktail menu on our table and waitress #2 doting her iPad for our orders. We decided to try the Smoked Oyster Bruschetta and the Duck Wings for appetizers. As waitress #2 was walking away typing in the order, she came back confused and said, ""Just one order of the bruschetta?"" to which we nodded our heads and she walked back to the kitchen. We all thought this was bizarre, but it all made sense later when two thick cut pieces of bread were topped with what looked like one measly chopped up oyster in a sea of tomato and bean mash. I didn't even taste anything remotely oyster-esque in this dish, which was a letdown and a waste of money. As for the duck wings, they were much larger than expected, but we were served *3* wings, which made splitting them quite difficult. If only waitress #2 had clued us in.  For our main course, taken by waitress #3, my boyfriend and I decided to split the Wild Boar Burger and the Krazy Kimchi with a side of the truffle fries. The Krazy Kimchi was spot on flavor-wise and it made me forget about all the service errors of the evening. The hangar steak sausage was cooked to a medium perfection and went wonderfully with the short rib and spiciness of the turnips. The bun was soft and buttery--my only negative comment is that I would've loved to have had more of the kimchi action on top, but I can't be too greedy. As for the Wild Boar Burger, that was definitely the shining star of the evening. The burger was a nice medium temperature and the blackberry compote and brie cheese provided a sweet and sharp contrast that I'm still drooling over. The blackberry compote deserves an honorable mention for how fresh and flavorful it was. I was wowed by this burger and savored every last bite. The truffle fries were deliciously pungent, and a great side to the dog and burger. We noticed that throughout the night our water glasses were empty and service was incredibly slow in spite of how many employees were just standing around the dining room. I'm still perplexed as to why we had three different waitresses who all said they'd be taking care of us for the evening. Also, with so many waitresses, why are the chefs wordlessly running the dishes out to the tables? The Peasantry needs to improve their waitstaff, lose the iPads, turn their music down, and let the experience shine on their only strength which is their unique and flavorful menu. I probably won't be back, but I'll definitely give Frank and Dawgs a whirl.",0.9944,0.828,0.116,0.056,0.47735442661913247

2013-02-04,1.0,"The owner of this place is a JERK. I went for brunch on Saturday, having been several times before then with pleasant experiences. However, the series of events which occurred this weekend, and the treatment I received from the owner has caused me to vow never to return. I have been in the service industry before, so when my meal (pancakes) did not come out in a timely fashion (40 minutes after ordering), even though people around me who had ordered after me were getting their food, I didn't think anything of it. I know stuff happens, and the chef stopped by to say ours was on the way, therefore acknowledging that this was unusual. But when my pancakes were raw in the middle, I could ignore it no longer and I sent them back. The server was nonchalant about it and did not seem particularly concerned that there was a mistake, but again, she was not rude, and I was not offended by her reaction. I was offended, however, when I then had to wait another 20 minutes FOR PANCAKES when food was pouring out of the kitchen left and right. Meanwhile, my companion had ordered another coffee, and it took 15+ minutes for our server to realize it had not arrived. When she mentioned it, my friend said she no longer wanted the coffee; it arrived 2 minutes later, and we were charged for it on the bill. Not to mention she had to sit there staring at her food while it took them eons to cook me new pancakes. We were overall ignored by the entire staff during this debacle, although they did offer to make up for it by sending out a dessert on the house. By this point, we had been there for over an hour and a half for brunch, and just wanted to leave. The server offered to send the owner over once she realized how miffed we were. She approached him on two different occasions to implore him to come to our table; both times he ignored her. After waiting for him to stop by for 20 minutes, he finally brought our check, with the pancakes on it. I explained that we had a problem with the pancakes and I did not think I should be charged for them. He responded, without inquiring of the details, that ""I wouldn't stay in business if I gave out free food, and you did eat them eventually. If you were really in the industry, you would know that I cannot survive by comping meals."" I was shaking with rage at this point, to which the owner responded ""Don't come back if you don't like it."" I realized then and there that this was a losing battle, and the only option for me was to never return. If he can't afford to comp $9 pancakes, but can afford to alienate customers, I expect he won't be in business much longer anyway. Upon reading other comments, it seems this guy doesn't quite understand that comping a meal that costs him next to nothing in the name of making a customer happy is worth it.

There has been one time that we've attempted to have dinner here, and it was too crowded and busy (45 minute wait) so we ducked out because we were too hungry. They're planning on opening the basement level for more seating, so that should hopefully help with wait times in the future. The husband and wife dynamic here works, and they're both great hosts. Very sensitive to your wait. The staff is very attentive and knowledgeable of the food, great recommendations. I also appreciate that Joe Doren, lead chef, serves guests too -- great touch. Our favorite dishes include (with our favorites to start): Gizzards (fresh, battered and fried perfection), Truffle fries (our trips to Franks n' Dawgs which they also own are in the double digits where we met this umami explosion for the first time), Duck Wings (the combination of the fall off the bone duck meat with the cherry mustard is to die for). Notable dishes also include the Black Dog red wine and dark chocolate gelato, beef and bone marrow burger, and deviled sausage. The only dish that I'm on the fence with is the grilled pork belly gyro which I've had twice. So obviously a dish that I liked, but the second time the pork belly had no seasoning, the gyro was a little bit more greasy than I had remembered. But maybe it'll take a 3rd time.

The Wild Boar Burger ranked up there with one of the best I've ever eaten.   OK, lets start with the cutesy crap that I could care less about. The decor is pretty typical of what you would find in this area. Lots of red colors, and goofy art on the walls that I could really do without. In an area seething with cotton docker wearing Yuppsters, I shouldn't have expected anything else. But here's where the plot thickens. The service is fabulous and the food is really good.     We started out with a couple of appetizers. The Truffle fries were par for the course. Salty and delicious. The Duck wings were kind of dry and had that typical gamey taste you would expect from duck. No complaints, maybe it just didn't suit my palate. For my entree, I decided to try one of their wild game burgers and let me tell you, it was amazing. The Wild boar burger was crispy on the outside, juicy and delicious on the inside. It was lean, mean and tasty as hell. My Wife's Duck Burger was just as good. My only complaint would be the dainty size of the burger. For 15 bucks, I expect a little more meat on my plate.

More recently went for brunch and it might have to be one of the if not THE best brunches I've had (and I've done a lot of brunches: Publican, M. Henry, Bongo Room etc.). Get the:    Pancetta and chocolate waffle: perfect combination of sweet and salty (definitely not too sweet, which I was worried about). Enough chocolate but not overwhelming, pistachios and pancetta to add salt and texture and make you never want to stop eating. Pork Belly Breakfast Sandwich: It's hard to go wrong with pork belly - as long as they make it right, which they do. The kimchi aioli and brussel slaw added the right amount of tangy flavor that wasn't overwhelming and perfectly complemented the pork belly.  DRINKS:  Hot Rum: Wow. THE BEST hot drink I've ever had. If I could have one everyday, I would. It's like a mexican hot chocolate with expresso, topped off with a creamy meringue. Expresso with chocolate, chili, almonds, and rum? Can you really go wrong? No.  Now top it off with a thin layer of sweet meringue...and I'm pretty much in heaven.  The service was excellent. Everyone was very friendly and helpful.

I was surprised the truffle fries were even served as they were sitting in a pool of oil. The sauce on the rabbit pasta was very strongly masked by red wine.

We sat at the counter and were waited on by Alex, the owner. To the person who commented on his fake British accent, don't be an ass he is Aussie. From Melbourne in fact. Anyways we had already had dinner at Penny's Noodle Shop (holla!) and were interested in some vino. Alex talked about the house wines and how he picks them himself and so we tried the white and the red. They were alright. We then took a look at the menu and thought, wow this looks interesting. Alex noted that the prices were kept low because of the 'peasantry' name, he wanted good local food that everyone could afford. Ok that's cool. We decided to try a few things and got the truffle fries and the cheese plate. The truffle fries were a total disappointment. For $6 you get maybe 8 waffle fries. I've had better truffle fries at Bridget McNeill's of all places. The cheese plate was much better. The cheddar, goat and blue were nice portions but we were given 4 of the thinnest slices of bread. We asked for a few more pieces because there was a fair amount of cheese. This was an extra $1. The blueberries on the cheese plate were very good, but the mustard seed onions I could do without. We tried other wines on the menu, I suggested my friend and I do the viognier which was $7 and in my opinion much better and cheaper than the house wines. Normally I don't do dessert but sweet potato churros were too interesting to pass up. Sadly they weren't cooked well. They needed another 30 seconds or so in the fryer and they were falling apart even after they cooled. Plus there was a disgusting amount of sugar on them. My friend got the nutella toast with earl grey marshmallows and she said it was good. Our service was spotty. After our food was served we had to ask the owner for silverware, or cutlery as the Aussies would say, and we always had to ask for our water to be refilled even though there were other people working behind the bar/counter area. The contemporary interior is really neat. I would be interested to go back and try it after a few more kinks are worked out.",0.9917,0.818,0.142,0.04,0.46128787878787886

2012-11-11,1.0,"We walked in on a Saturday at 6:30. The room was inviting and had a good vibe. After perusing the menu, it seemed like we would not be disappointed. But we will discuss the food soon enough. After asking our server some basic wine questions on the very limited wine list, we were given some blank stares, some ""let me checks"" and some ""I don't know's"". Luckily, one of my dining companions and I know enough about wine where we could navigate the list ourselves. When the ""manager"" brought the bottle of wine over, he held the wine glasses in his hands as he poured the wine all at the corner of the table and handed the glasses out like candy to trick or treaters on Halloween. Apparently, basic wine service is not taught here, It took about 10 minutes to get water and only after we asked for it. No bread service is offered either, but I realize many restaurants are going that direction lately, so no beef there.  To the food. We started with a brussel sprout salad, which was the smallest ""salad"" I have ever seen at a restaurant. (including prix fixe menu portion sizes) $5 is not a lot to spend on a salad, but we should get more than a ramekin size dish of the dish. This is a recurring theme. Next came the pork belly kimchi skewer. The pork belly in kimchi itself was quite tasty and would have been a nice dish by itself, but it was a tiny size portion ($12) but the portion was the least of the issues with this dish. On the other half of the plate may have been the worst conceived and executed single food item I have eaten in my life. A combination of soba, crab and avacado buried under a salt lick of a ""dressing"" that was inedible. Crab is a delicate and sweet flavor that should shine on any dish and this was a saturated, mealy and  salty mess. (please note, I LOVE SALT) When we brought it to the waiters attention, there was virtually no response and he whisked the dish away. When he came back, I asked if the kitchen had tried the dish, as kitchen staff often do when a dish is sent back, and the server said they had tried it. He said they thought the dish was great as it was. Needless to say, I was shocked, but we move onto the next item.  The mussels were tasty enough and the broth with what seemed like excellent home made chorizo, amped it up even more. But, the amount of mussels were paltry. I counted 12 mussels in the entire bowl. I think the dish was $11. What the .......???!!!! It came with 3 small grilled pieces of bread, so when they brought the dish, one of my friends asked for more bread because the best part of mussel dishes is soaking up the broth. We received 3 small un-grilled pieces of bread and later found out we were charged $2 for this!!! Are you kidding me? It isn't the money that mattered, but my god, if you are going to charge for that: 1) tell me you are charging me for it and 2) grill the damn bread!! Another disaster waiting to happen, was the escargot. Billed as escargot with crispy fritters and a corn chowder, this was as confusing a dish as it was disappointing. The fritters were so burnt we couldn't taste anything on the plate and that is the best thing I can say about this dish. The chowder was remarkably bland and the escargot was rubbery. How this made it onto a menu, let alone onto my table I will never know. Now the octopus gyro. Grape gremolata was pretty much all I could taste. But the octopus was rubbery and not a lot of it was on the plate. (shocker) The pita tasted home made which was a nice touch, but it was so saturated in some sauce from the gremolata or something else, it too was a lost cause. The 3 of us were sharing all of the courses and through the first 4 courses no one offered to clear our small plates or switch out our silver, even though the plates were quite messy from the courses. Finally, a young woman with pink hair walked by and offered to bring us fresh plates. Hallelujah!! Someone was paying attention to the guest!  I am an experienced dinner and a former chef and this is literally the first review of any kind I have ever written. I have been tempted before, but having been in the industry for so long, I am so forgiving of errors or mistakes made. But this is an utter and complete failure on every level. The lack of effort to make the guest happy was clearly evident at every level.  A manager never touched our table, even though we complained about one dish (pork belly) which was not taken off our check, even though we only ate half of it. Another dish we had to ask the chef who ran our food to bring us a new dish (escargot) because it inedible due to the burnt fritters. Is there no training for the staff by management to communicate about unhappy guests?  I did not see one employee smile the entire time I was there, except when we were first greeted.  I went into the restaurant with high hopes, but I will certainly make sure people are aware of my abominable experience at The Peasantry.

Come here with a hungry belly and an open mind!  Peasantry is also easy on the pocketbook -- about $70 for several high-quality dishes to share, several cocktails and tip (for 2 guests). I like it and I like it a lot. I'm dying to come back for brunch. The menu looks amazing!",0.9657,0.708,0.196,0.097,0.5235627705627707

Maybe I was expecting something different, which would be my fault, but it just fell short. IT IS RIDICULOUSLY expensive. The portions are whack and they charge you an insane amount of money. At least throw some sides in there or something! The service was good and bad. Our waitress was nice, but it just felt like we weren't welcomed in general. I was also expecting more in the bar-end of the menu. There were 4 or 5 drinks on the cocktails list and it said to ask the waitress for more seasonal or special drinks. When I did that, the waitress made me feel dumb for asking. Other than that condescending instance, she was nice. My drink was not great and the food was sub-par, at least for what they were charging. My boyfriend got a lobster roll for $18 and he finished it within minutes. There were no sides or anything else that came with it, the plate just looked ridiculous when he brought it out with just a tiny sandwich on it. My boyfriend was still pretty much starving after that. We got the truffle fries which were good but again, there was just something lacking. The desserts looked amazing, I will say. I might comeback for dessert only, but it's probably not enough to save my opinion of this place.

For dinner I have tried the duck burger and it is awesome...great flavor and not too filling...got delicious truffle fries with it also! Came out to a total of $20!!! They have a good selection of craft beers as well. As far as brunch goes, the pork belly sandwich is off the chain and the short rib hash is something special! The short rib pastrami hash was pretty filling and worth every bite!

2012-10-23,1.0,"The service was poor, the food was bad and the management was rude.  We left unfulfilled, both literally and figuratively.  I am unsure as to why there are so many high ratings for The Peasantry on Yelp.   Perhaps brunch is a better option than dinner. --- We went on a Friday night around 8 pm and there was a wait, as I would expect.  The hostess was great, apologizing for the wait, checking in every few minutes, and even making small talk.  While waiting we decided to grab a drink.  The bar area was small and crowded, so we ordered a glass of wine and a beer.  It took several minutes before the drinks arrived, much longer than one would expect for a simple draft beer and glass of wine.  The next drink order took even longer as we had ordered two house cocktails.  By the time the second drink arrived, it was 35 minutes after our arrival and time to be seated. Once we sat down, there was no meaningful introduction by our waitress, no discussion of the restaurant style, cuisine, specials or recommendations.  We had to call her over to be able to order the starters that we wanted.  We ordered the kimchi popcorn, the escargot, and the cognac bbq frog legs. The kimchi popcorn was cold, and the ""dehydrated kimchi"" tasted like BBQ powder flavoring that you find at a movie theater.  We are big popcorn fans but this was very unappetizing.  The entire escargot dish tasted overpoweringly of smoke.  Every bite tasted of smoke and nothing much else.  Again, this was a disappointment.  The cognac bbq frog legs was the best starter, however, that isn't saying much.  They looked nothing like the picture on their website.  The website describes it as ""grilled frog legs,"" however these were deep dried.  The frog legs had a huge amount of breading on them that just slipped off the frog leg as soon as you bit into it.  You were then left with what tasted like the outside of a piece of fried chicken, covered in a BBQ sauce that tasted just like Sweet Baby Rays, and an unseasoned frog leg. We then had dirty plates on our table for some time.  During this wait, the table next to use was seated.  After a few minutes, their drink orders arrived.  They had each ordered a house specialty cocktail.  After a sip or two of each of the two cocktails, they told the waitress that the drinks were unpleasant and asked for something else.  The waitress removed the drinks and when she returned, she told them that they would have to pay 1/2 price for them anyway.  The patrons then asked to speak to the manager, and the waitress told them that the bartender was the owner and he himself had made that decision.  They persisted and the waitress left to tell the owner.  The waitress returned with the news that the owner was too busy and would not be coming by.  After a few moments of disbelief, the patrons had obviously made the decision to never return to this restaurant.  The owner eventually did come over to the table, reiterated that they would have to pay half price for drinks that they never drank, and mostly looked like he was annoyed that he had to even be by the table. I then flagged down our waitress to tell her that we needed another drink, to have the table cleared of dirty plates and would like to order entrees.  The entrees were a little more pleasing than the starters.  We ordered the pickled lamb tongue flatbread, the lamb merguez sausage sandwich and the triple truffle fries.  The fries were undercooked and under-seasoned.  I had smelled the fries go by earlier in the night and was excited by the strong aroma of truffle that wafted by, however, the fries that we received were just soggy and flavorless.  The duck tongue flatbread was bland as well.  The flatbread had been cooked within an inch of its life and crumbled and crunched as I bit into it.  The whole thing was dry and the ratio of bread to toppings was off.  The lamb merguez sausage was flavorful and by far the best thing that we ate this night. Again, I had to call over the waitress, as we hadn't seen her for some time.  We just decided to ask for the check.  We are not ones to leave food on a plate, but on this night most dishes went back to the kitchen with a good amount of the food they left there with still on them.  I have eaten at many restaurants around the world that offer unusual fare, however, it seems as if this restaurant cares more for which unusual ingredients they are going to use, than how delicious the food will be.   We left unfulfilled, both literally and figuratively.",0.9896,0.869,0.084,0.047,0.46156597962568124

2012-10-16,5.0,"Really nice addition to the neighborhood!  The Peasantry has a lot to offer:  it's convenient and a far cry from all of the other chain type of restaurants in the area, which have their place...but when I want to eat food that is more thoughtful and interesting, then usually non-chain is best.  The servers were very friendly and well informed.  She also told me about the kitchen crew; I was very impressed with the caliber of the people creating the food, they have got a LOT of fine dining experience and it is demonstrated in their work. It's also cozy and it's accessible/approachable.  We called ahead for a party of four seating.  They don't take reservations but advised us the best times to avoid a wait, and were very friendly on the phone and in person.  I like that.....and the friendliness also showed up in the servers (two different ones interacted with us).  Often I think trendy restaurants have a ""too cool for school"" attitude, and that was not the case at all here. Now to the important part:  the food was excellent - and I mean excellent. Items ordered at the table were duck burger, lamb burger, mussels, pork belly gyro, beet flatbread, truffle fries and goat curry!.  The combination of flavors was well thought out, which harkens back to the fine dining experience they have creating the menu and making the food.  Gyros can be found in a million different restaurants and they will be pretty much the same, but a pork belly gyro with roasted piquillo sour cream is the twist that pushes this over the top.  To be honest I didn't totally get the elevated street food concept but when I tried the gyro I got it....take something common like a gyro or a burger and elevate it.  The goat curry......oh my word - delicious and decadent, homemade roti prata that melted in your mouth.   Another nice touch and keeping up with the thoughtful flavors and combinations, there's a wine and beer suggestion for every item on the menu - LOVE IT. Long story short, I think this place is a great neighborhood option, great for a casual diner, but truly up the ""foodies"" alley.  Foodies - you will be very happy.",0.9989,0.716,0.273,0.011,0.6298611111111111

I asked to speak to the owner who is the bartender.........he saw me, made me wait.......in my opnion hoping i would leave and then came over. I said ""hi i was wondering why the 2 glasses of the Nior werent taken off of our bill seeing as we thought it was spoiled and we didnt drink it.  He went on a spiel by telling me that everyone has a different palet and that the price point on the wine reflects in my opinion ""Too Bad if you didnt like it, it is was it is""  I said to him "" as a business owner i cant beleive this is the conversation we are having and that we would not come back""  He then proceded to tell me ""Do you know how many places i have been and had CRAP food and NOT complained.""  I felt disrespected as a patron.  I also feel sorry for the staff........if i would have had enough cash to pay for the bill i would have left the $16 of the bill and placed $30 in the waiters hand.  If i didnt have respect for how difficult the restaturant industry is, i would have walked out on the bill........

2012-10-06,3.0,"I got a tip from an acquaintance to come here and try out the food. When I looked it up online it seemed really trendy and a nice place to try for a Friday night so I went there with my husband. Turns out the place that seems to finely straddle the line between pretentious and hip (which is a good place to be), is a bit uneven in its performance and the experience definitely turned out pretentious for us. The food was definitely a bit disappointing. It seems, from the reviews that the food is a bit up and down in this place and that on good days it's good bordering on great, but on bad days it's meh. We definitely came on a meh day. I ordered the mussel bake and while I don't understand the complaints about the lack of mussels (come on, it's a starter on the menu), I do understand the complaints about the taste. I don't know if I'm spoiled from eating really good mussels previously but these were far from satisfying and some mussels even tasted awful. At one point I ate a mussel and thought ""this is it, this was the one that's going to make me spend the rest of the night worshipping the great porcelain god."" Fortunately, that didn't happen, but if you use fresh mussels and they still taste off, something's wrong with the cooking. My husband ordered the kangaroo burger which is a really nice twist on the fall season. It had pumpkin spicing on and tasted generally nice. I think they do all their burgers slightly charred, so for those who don't like that, avoid the burgers. Husband really liked it, so he was happy. The issue with that meal wasn't the taste as much as the presentation. He orders a kangaroo burger for $18 and gets a burger on a white plate, nothing more. I understand they want us to order sides (which we did, truffle fries are delicious!) but he didn't even get a pickle and some coleslaw or some small side salad or even half a sliced tomato! It was just a burger on a plate. Pretty disappointing and really boring looking. I really wish they had a pub section to this 'elevated bar' because the drinks were fantastic, although slightly expensive. They now do cocktails, not a wide variety, but a fair few select ones that look pretty good. The beer selection is really good and so is the wine selection. I would love to come back here and eat some snacks, like the truffle fries and a small salad, but I don't want to come back for dinner.

I am supremely pumped that I ordered this as it was delicious, although some parts of the flatbread were a bit too hard to eat. We didn't stop with the flatbread though.

The Peasantry absolutely blew me away! The service was impeccable, friendly, and not pretentious in the least. The food was insanely good and to call it ""elevated street food"" is really an injustice because it's that and so much more. Have you ever looked at a menu and wanted to try absolutely everything on it? Well, the Peasantry is that place because its menu is so unique, yet it's somehow familiar because it's earthy, simple foods prepared in really creative and delicious ways.  My boyfriend and I had to sit on stools in the front of the restaurant because there initially wasn't a table available for us in which to sit. This surprisingly didn't hinder our dining experience in any way! Our waitress was incredibly friendly and attentive.  So refreshing!  We bought a bottle of wine to share, and then tucked into escargot and poutine for appetizers. The poutine, a French-Canadian street staple, was elevated due to the presence of duck confit and it was absolutely delicious. The escargot was the most unique presentation of snails I'd ever had, eschewing the typical garlic butter sauce for a corn sauce and bacon hush puppies. Amazing! For our dinner, we had the beef and bone marrow burger and the baby octopus gyro. Sounds a little out there for some, but believe me--it was out of this world! The burger was hangar steak with bone marrow, pickled cauliflower and shallot marmalade (delicious!) and it was the juiciest burger I've ever had. Truly. The baby octopus gyro was grilled with chorizo and little potatoes on some kind of delicious flatbread. My boyfriend and I agreed to share both items but I honestly wanted to eat that whole octopus gyro thing entirely myself! There were so many other items that looked equally incredible, and I look forward to going back.  I have to say, the Peasantry was as equally impressive an experience as some of the more well-known restaurants downtown, and half the price (Girl & the Goat, anyone?).  I cannot speak highly enough of this fantastic restaurant.

2012-10-01,1.0,"Very disappointing.  I'm frankly surprised at the all of the Yelp praise after the disastrous meal our party of 4 experienced a few Saturdays ago.  Note: the service was fine at first--friendly and prompt, and the beverage selection great; but the food was terrible!  Perhaps our expectations were too high, because the menu looks so good, with creative takes on ""street food,"" but every single dish was at best underwhelming and at the worst nearly inedible. Worst offender: their version of elote, with blue cheese and rosemary oil (which mercifully seems to have disappeared from the current menu) was inedible.  The oil overpowered every flavor, and if it wasn't rancid, well, anyone sampling this would have spit it out.  We did. Second worst: the baby octopus gyro: the octopus was horrendously prepared--tougher than a tire.  The only saving grace here is that there wasn't very much octopus to be had. Still, not a person sampling it could ingest the star of the dish.  The brussels sprout salad was also a mess--for all its promised flavors, the raw shredded spouts were extremely bitter and the blood orange oil and lemon zest did no favors--we honestly tried and couldn't choke this down.   Our gluten-free friend was excited about the mussel bake, but it was awful: behold the tiniest shriveled mussels you've ever seen--and all told there were *three* fewer mussels than shells.  The bulk of the bake was a strange yellow broth that had the flavor (and look) of shimmery margarine.  Again, inedible.  Thank his ""lucky"" gluten-free stars he didn't have bread to dip into this concoction... The marrow burger I ordered ended up being the only thing approaching acceptable, yet  the burger itself was dry and slightly overcooked (which was quite surprising since the server and I shared a moment extolling all meats prepared medium rare).  The pickled cauliflower and shallot marmalade were all that saved it from oblivion.   We had a couple more small sharing items that impressed no one; and when we were ready to leave, the server noticed we'd barely touched the brussels sprout salad and elote.  She asked if we were dissatisfied, and we politely explained that we were.  She then asked for specifics to relay to the chef, which we gladly provided.  A few minutes later our check arrived and nary an item was comped.

I happened to walk by the other night in search of a burger...at first, disappointed that Hai Yen had closed, but now, so thankful The Peasantry took its place.  I went with a friend and we split a bottle of wine, the Deconstructed Poutine, Mussel Bake, Beef and Bone Marrow Burger, and finally, the Affogato. Literally everything was plate-licking good. The look of the fries when they came out, I thought there wouldn't be enough gravy, but it was all piled in the middle which made for easy dipping. FYI, the online menu pictures them as waffle fries, but we were served shoestring. Either way, full of cheesy goodness. The sauce from the mussels was heavenly, but I could eat garlic-butter-white wine sauce on anything...which is why I saved it to drench my burger. And the three extra orders of crostini we glutton-ily requested. It could have gone without the awkward corn cob chunks and chorizo, but didn't stop my mouth from watering out the corners. from The pickled cauliflower was an interesting accompaniment to the beef; I enjoyed it very much but I plan to try the other burgers when I return. And while disaronno and espresso aren't really my things, I can't deny the unique presentation and my friend's smiling tummy. The bill came out to only $35 per person. What a steal! So not overpriced, and totally worth the pain of shoving my stomach full of delicious elevated street food. The atmosphere was very relaxing and service superb.

2012-09-28,3.0,"I have mixed feelings about The Peasantry.  First, the complimentary: I think the interior is fantastic, with regards to both ambiance and aesthetics.  I've always been fan of raw wood and exposed brick, both well represented here.  The feel is most decidedly casual; a few tables with benches in the middle, a long bar with about a dozen stools and more conventional tables on either the wall.   The service was exactly as it should be.  Attentive, but not overbearing with questions or suggestions.  Our waiter provided us with good descriptions of the beer and wine selection while also being thoroughly detailed about the specials. The food was a mixed bag for both me and my friend.  I ordered the kimchi popcorn as an appetizer and the lamb burger entrée.  The popcorn was particularly mediocre; loaded with powder flavoring - far too much of it - that was simply not very tasty.  As an avid eater of kimchi, I was disappointed.  The lamb burger was better, but overall still unimpressive.  The olive aioli was tasty, but I would have liked a bit more for flavor.  The lamb itself was cooked perfectly, but unfortunately bland.  The lamb also seemed to be soaked in some kind of oil; cutting into the piece was like The Poseidon Adventure for my hands, and this was not just the natural moisture of the meat.  It is not often that I eat lamb and it is a meat you rarely see on dinner menus, especially at Peasantry prices.  Again, overall I was disappointed, but it was by no means a poor or unacceptable dish.  Just okay. I think I may give The Peasantry another shot, probably for brunch.  The menu is rather unique, the interior is very well executed and the staff was great, so it is at least worth a try.",0.9602,0.759,0.15,0.091,0.5651631314422012

For entrees, we went all out.  I got the pickled lamb tongue flatbread, while the others at my table got the beet flatbread, the pork belly pita, and the chicken on corn pancake.  The pork belly really blew me away; the texture was everything you want in pork--bacony, chewy, but crisp around the edges.  Mine was my next favorite.  The pickled lamb tongue had an interesting texture but a rich savory flavor complimented by the greens and other appointments on the flatbread.  I didn't try the beet flatbread because of my aversion to the dreaded red devil root, but it looked similar to mine.  The chicken on corn pancake was good, and I recall the excellent breading on it, but it was by far the least adventurous of the entrees.  We also ordered the truffle fries as a shared side and they were pretty much what you'd expect.  I read somewhere on twitter that white women have spoken: truffle oil on everything, and after seeing it on the menu at every trendy Chicago establishment I'm just kind of bleh about the whole thing.  Doesn't really taste like much anywhere. No dessert for us as we had a giant meal.  I immediately raved about the food as we finished drinks near closing, but the others I was with were so-so on it.  They being a bit more critical (but no less adventurous) than I, I saw what they were talking about and, by consensus, ensured them that my Yelp review would be no more than a 4.

Then we ordered the truffle fries, the duck burger and the octopus gyro for our main. The truffle fries were delicious! I wanted to order like three bowls more. The duck burger was good, but the orange marmalade on it really didn't add to the dish. The octopus gyro was tasty; the octopus was a tad chewy, but had good flavor and a nice char. And I love octopus. The menu was full of delicious things. Next time, I need to try the Brussel sprout salad and the tur-doggin sausage. We saw a lot of those coming out of the kitchen. Yum! And truffle fries. Bowls an bowls of them. Also, if you need to eat gluten-free, the menu is clearly labeled with items they can make gf for you. These items are marked in red. I'm assuming it's just removing the bread (the burgers and sausages were among the list), but it's refreshing to see a restaurant like this be aware of issues like celiac. The one downfall was our server. She was nice enough, but didn't seem very knowledgable about the food. Or maybe she was too knowledgable without any first hand experience. We each asked for a recommendation between two items, and instead of one, we got a description of the items. I can read the descriptions in the menu, I was interested in what you thought was better. It made me feel like she had never eaten the food She also was a bit clueless about the handling of celiac guests when we asked. We have a friend coming in next week who has celiac disease and wanted to clarify a few points. However, it's still pretty new, right? So hopefully service will get a bit more comfortable. All in all, we really enjoyed our meal here and will be back.",0.9974,0.801,0.184,0.015,0.4782524493050808

I feel the need to go for a long run now but at the time of eating it, boy was it heavenly. The duck was perfectly juicy and the apricot strips gave it a hint of fresh, fruity zing with each bite. The foie gras that topped it all was purely decadent.  For how gourmet this burger was, $14 isn't too bad (and I'm pretty frugal).  We had an order of the truffle fries ($7.50) and reconstructed poutine fries ($6), split among 4 people.  Both were delicious but for the small portions, it's a bit on the pricey side. I would suggest just sticking to the entrees, especially since everything is relatively heavy, going along with street food theme.  The other dishes at my table looked scrumptious and everyone seemed to enjoy their meal.  The service was excellent, and I loved the chill crowd and slightly rustic decor.

2012-08-11,3.0,"I've been here about 4 times now, and I really wanted to like it.  The concept of the place is right up my alley -- elevated street food.  Anything that's borderline pretentious like this has the chance to be really really good. Unfortunately, I think this place is either flopping or experiencing some growing pains.  Let me also say this: I despise communal seating.  I get that it's probably a trend that people who aren't anti-social could enjoy; I don't enjoy it.  If I'm bringing a special friend out to dinner, the last thing I want to do is sit at the same table as some other fools.  It's not because I don't want to overhear them, it's more because I don't want them to hear the shit I'm saying.  Here's some of the good - I love the way they manage their alcohol selection.  It's always one case of wine (one of red and white) at a time.  That wine becomes the house special until it's gone, then the owner gets a new case.  He's had some really solid wines, and he sells them at really reasonable prices.  He does the same kind of thing with the beer. There's no cocktails to speak of. So, if you're just looking for a place to have a nice wine or a beer, this is a good place to go.  I think you should go here for drinks before eating your meal elsewhere.  That's kind of where the good ends.  I hate to bash the servers, because they've all been really nice, but they know nothing.  Nothing.  He didn't know whether they served cocktails.  He couldn't pronounce the names of the wine varietals they had on special.  He had no idea what his favorite items on the menu were.  Not cool.   I've sampled a number of items on the menu, and none of them are good enough to write to your grandma about. The bone marrow infused burger and the triple truffle fries are probably the best things on the menu, and are worth sampling.  Frog legs- tasted like bad fish mixed with lake water.  Chicken Gizzards -- totally buried in spice and cornmeal so the wonderful organ flavors are totally hidden Pork Belly Gyro -- Really large roti (flatbread) with some kind of fancy coleslaw, and maybe 10 tiny pieces of pork belly.  In reality, I just want a dish of pork.  Mmm.  There's an obsession with flatbreads here. I think it's to the point that the flatbreads are totally overdone -- meaning, the ratio of flatbread to meat is WAY too much in favor of the flatbread.   So, come here for a drink.  Stop in to sample the burger and fries. Other than that, this place is a ""pass,"" until they've got some of these things ironed out.",0.9893,0.796,0.146,0.058,0.5468704906204905
2012-08-08,4.0,"I'm so happy to see a place like The Peasantry open up in Lincoln Park! It's too hard to find eclectic, affordable food around here... especially on this very commercial stretch of Clark. I visited on a Friday night. The restaurant had all of its windows open, with some seating overlooking the street. Decor was bistro-ish and seating was a tad uncomfortable as my bench against the wall kept me pin-straight at all times. Adam R. and I were greeted immediately by the friendly hostess, who told us it would be a 25 minute wait. We sat at the bar to wait-- I had a glass of the house white (super fruity, which is good in my book) and he had an IPA. We were led to our table in about 10 minutes.  We started with the duck wings, which were super crispy and flavorful, but I wish there were more meat on them. We followed up with the frog legs, which weren't the best I'd ever had. Their flavor was masked by generous dollops of (albeit tasty) barbeque sauce. They weren't bad, just not up to par. The beef and bone marrow burger was DIVINE. Someone here said that their burger was inedibly salty-- it was at this point in the meal that I realized that they are pretty heavy-handed with the salt here. And that's coming from a salt lover. I didn't find the bone marrow burger to be overly salty... I actually think it added to its decadence. This is NOT a burger you just munch on. I thoroughly enjoyed it, and was glad to have split it in half with Adam R. The rabbit pasta was perfect-- noodles fresh and flavorful, deep wine-y flavor, and hearty rabbit and mushrooms throughout. We also had the shredded brussel sprout salad, which was meh. Besides a sprinkling of pistachios, it was pretty flavorless. Oh, and I can't forget the truffle fries: BEST truffle fries I've ever had. You really taste the richness of the truffle because they add it in 3 different forms.  Our waiter kind of disappeared toward the end... I think he left. Someone else gave us the bill. Overall the food was very good, especially for the low prices. It's a fun place, and you can't deny the opportunity to try things like lamb tongue and gizzards.

2012-08-08,1.0,"I ended up there with some friends for brunch last weekend. We were going to go across the street, but they were super busy, and The Peasantry wasn't all that busy (there was no wait, over half the seats were available), so there we went. In hindsight, we should have waited the 5-10 minutes across the street for brunch. After perusing the menu options, I settled on the French Toast; it sounded pretty good on their menu. The presentation was nice, but when I took my first bite, it tasted  a little burnt. I turned over that piece, and yup - it was BURNT. Some of the pieces were cooked perfectly fine, but half of it was burnt on one side. When the waitress came by to ask how the food was, I told her that the French Toast was inconsistently cooked and that some of it was actually burnt. She responded with, ""but did it taste okay?"", I answered with, ""well, the parts that weren't burnt"". She said that she'd tell the chef. At the end of our meal, where I ate less than half of it (leaving the burnt pieces uneaten), the waitress asked if I had enough to eat (well, it was what it was, and my companions were finished their meals completely, so I'm not sure where she was going with the question).  No manager-type person ever came over to apologize, and when our bill arrived, the burnt French Toast was still on it. Reading some of the other reviews, I've seen that burnt food has happened before at The Peasantry, and it seems like the staff aren't responding appropriately to deal with it. I'd never serve people in my home French Toast that's burnt, even if it's free, and I expect better from a restaurant. Screw-ups happen, and they didn't deal with it well at all. I don't expect that I'll ever be a return customer. There are just too many other restaurants out there.

My boyfriend and I ordered off of the brunch menu: mussels, hanger steak and bone marrow burger, and truffle fries. The food was presented well but that's when things became mediocre. The mussels were in a sauce that tasted slightly strange and there were not enough of them. As for the burger, it tasted like it was cooked over a grease fire. The fries were the best thing we ate. We also enjoyed the pickled cauliflower that topped the burger.  The service was good and waiter who served us was very nice. The chef however had a bit of an attitude.

Gizzards with a 5 Vulture beer- very satisfying beer, gizzards were good. Chicken Livers and Red's Rye beer- beer was good, Chicken livers cooked perfectly, everything else on the plate was burnt.

One piece perfect, the other two- ""C'mon Man, you served me burnt food"".  I tried a bite of everything to see if maybe it was my eyes but it was the food. Whole mouth covered in burnt tastes. For me, the problem is that people in chef whites bring the food to you. So a chef carried a clearly over cooked plate to me through the restaurant, put it in front of me, and left.

On the other hand, too many of them are simply reiterations of tired-out concepts. Not so with the Peasantry; this restaurant executes a novel concept (gussied up, gourmet versions of street food favorites), and does so very well. It's a pleasant surprise!  Duck wings ($9) are gargantuan, flavorful, and perfectly accompanied by currant jelly and buttermilk vinaigrette. They encapsulate all the addictiveness of good buffalo wings. Duck burger ($14), topped with foie gras, mustard greens, and apricot is supremely tender and rich - an excellent indulgence. Octopus and fingerling gyro ($11), served with grape gremolata is well-balanced, but feels a little bit small. It is good, but not great. The star, in my opinion, is the chicken-chocolate gyro ($11), dusted with cocoa powder, and served with apple and maple yogurt on a corn pancake - it sounds too sweet, but in actuality is one of the better balanced dishes I've enjoyed in recent memory. Probably the biggest letdown is the triple truffle fries ($6) - waffle-cut potatoes served with truffle oil, truffle butter, and truffle salt. Predictably, the copious amount of grease adds minimal truffle flavor, only serving to make the fries soggy before unappealingly pooling at the bottom of the bowl. Churros ($6) are made with macadamia nut and served with white chocolate and hibiscus creme anglaise - not too sweet, and a perfect cap to an excellent meal. The beer list is good, and the servers are friendly. All in all, The Peasantry has convinced me that the world has not, in fact, run out of ideas.

The chef of this place has led kitchens of famous restaurants...forget which ones but smthg along the lines of Tru, etc.  Pretty cool place and very decently priced!

Even though Yelp clearly states they don't take reservations my cousin decided to call and ask since there were 14 of us and they accepted an 8pm reservation for a Friday night. Well, loan behold we get their early around 7:45pm and here comes 8:30pm rolling around and we still weren't seated. They tell us they're waiting for the big group to leave and it should be shortly since they already paid, well, I knew better because I've worked in a restaurant and just because patrons pay doesn't mean they'll get up and leave right away. We decided to wait it out since we've already been waiting. Couldn't remember the time had to be at least around 9pm when we were seated and we we were all very hungry. Since our party was too big to fit in this ""party"" table we were split up.  The break down: Starters: Pigs in a blanket - chorizo inside a puff pastry how can you not like it! Delicious, great flavor. Duck wings - subpar, nothing to rave about Gizzards - same as just about anywhere else, needs more seasoning Frog Legs - this was the least liked from our table, odd taste Dishes: Baby octopus gyro - my friend really enjoyed this dish, full of flavor Pork belly gyro - seconds please! Lamb burger - worse of the pack, the flavor or seasoning left a bad taste, very dry Beef & bone marrow burger - tasty and very juicy Duck burger - hmMm the hint of orange is so good Tur-doggin sausage - great seasoning and very tasty Romesco pasta - how can you go wrong with pasta? oh was my bf not happy because this was a very bland dish Triple truffle fries - nothing special, needs more seasoning The portions of the dishes were a good size and the service was average.

My lady friends and i opted to do it ""tapas style""and ordered a bunch of items to share.  ROASTED BEET FLATBREAD: Like a delicious beet salad... but with carbs.  OCTOPUS GYRO: Probably the best bite of the evening. Super flavorful grilled octopus on chewy pita. Big win. BEEF AND BONE MARROW BURGER: Succulent, though at $14 I would normally expect some fries. BRUSSELS SPROUTS: Uber yummy, the orange oil was a nice touch. And for dessert, we had the churros with raspberry dipping sauce. These left something to be desired. They were more like a cake-donut than the churros I know and love (sold to me for $1 by a little old Hispanic lady on the D-train platform), and the dipping sauce lacked flavor. We should have quit while we were ahead OR ordered another app. My only complaint was that the banquette seating was SUPER uncomfortable. Too narrow and enforced rigid posture.

So we ordered 5 things: Beet Flat bread, Baby Octopus Gyro, and Beef & Bone Marrow burger, a side of Brussels sprouts salad and the White Chocolate Churros for dessert. We ordered assuming the portions would be petit, but that was far from the truth. The star of the show was the Baby Octopus Gyro. But everything was pretty darn good.  The Churros shouldn't of been called Churros and were much more like french toast sticks, but still satisfied a sweet tooth.

2012-07-01,5.0,"We accidentally ended up at The Peasantry while planning to go to Hai Yen which apparently closed down a few months ago. This is the kind of accident you want to end up in head first! We were cheerfully greeted by the bartender (Brian) who waved us in and let us pick any table we wanted and proceeded to humor my friend at the bar to create some crazy drink they came up with in the end. I glanced at the menu and 5 seconds in knew that this was probably going to be one of my favorite meals in a while... the menu starts with fried frog legs for pete's sake! Although I wasn't adventurous enough to try the frog legs I did opt for the duck wings which looked pretty crispy when served, were surprisingly juicy and moist. Served with a dill aioli and a cherry+mustard dipping sauce that I could probably slather on my shoe and still be delicious. We threw in an order of the truffle waffle fries which were basically layers upon layers of truffley goodness sprinkled on perfectly crispy and tender waffle fries.  for our main course we opted for the beef and bone marrow burger, and the oyster gyro served on roti prata (good chance to brush up on your singaporean/malaysian street foods)..my friend ended up ordering two servings of the roti prata!  We were a little limited as to what we could order for the entrees since alot of the stuff on the menu had some sort of pork product in it.  Note to non-pork eaters: The burgers and sausages don't really mention many pork products, but they do add pork to the meat or wrap their non pork sausages in pork casings to add fat or flavor. You just need to ask them the day you are there since they did say there are times when the meat has enough fat on its own that they don't need to add pork to it. What they can make without adding anything to it, they will gladly do so.  My friend was sufficiently pleased with the drinks that the bartender kept sending his way- all original recipes btw.  Aside from the great food it was the whole experience that spoke volumes about the establishment. The owner, Alexander (how badass is that! More Alex's should call themselves Alexander), came up to our table and gladly talked us through the menu, answered any all questions we had..and trust me.. I had alot of questions..right from asking if the meat was local, grassfed, imported etc.. and also told us about his inspiration for the roti pratas from his travels to Asia.  The Peasantry is the kind of place that you feel comfortable instantly.. you're welcomed.. there are friendly faces greeting you and will know you on a first name basis by the time you leave and will want you back visiting even if it's just to say hi walking down clark st.  Only critic would be to expand their dessert menu.. given my sweet tooth obviously. but everything was so great I didnt mind being limited to some pretty creative churros at the end of the meal.",0.9974,0.815,0.157,0.028,0.6188672438672437

I've had better chorizo before, but the dish worked. The beans that came with the dish were buttery, but good. Chicken gyro: This was a good dish, but I thought a couple bites were somewhat dry.

2012-06-14,5.0,"Peasantry is Alex Brunacci's (owner of popular Franks n Dawgs) new venue, bringing a much needed chic nose-to-tail cuisine venue to the Lincoln Park neighborhood (and a short walk from Lakeview). Peasantry aptly dubs their menu to be Elevated Street Food. This is the perfect description - they take typical comfort foods and make them modern and trendy. Want a burger? Have the hanger steak & bone marrow burger. Want fries? Have some triple truffle waffle fries (with truffle salt, butter and oil). Want pizza? Have a pickled lamb tongue flatbread. Want a gyro? Have one featuring octopus as the protein.  In addition to a outstanding menu, Peasantry has a great space. The decor is modern, inviting and energetic. The only knock on the space is it is on the smallish side, so tables are close together, there is some communal seating and the venue can become noisy. That said Peasantry is wonderful addition to the neighborhood; in terms of the vibe, menu and food quality it reminds me of Publican, Bristol and Longman & Eagle. The staff at Peasantry is extremely friendly and attentive as well. The owner (Alex) was behind the bar and his wife Ellen works as the hostess. She was very visible, making frequent rounds to check in with the patrons. Chicago is home to so many outstanding restaurants that great food is not enough, to thrive a restaurant also needs to make you feel welcome and Peasantry really pulls this off well. I dined tonight with a friend and so many items on the menu seemed appealing we decided to share several dishes. Much of the food is locally sourced and the menu is divided into various categories: Starters, Gyros, Flatbreads, Pizzas, Sausages (items you'd find at Frank n Dawgs), Pastas and Sides. There are a few choices for each category. My friend and I ordered the Pigs in the Blanket, Duck Wings, Baby Octopus Gyro, Beef & Bone Marrow Burger, Rabbit Pasta and Triple Truffle Fries. All were excellent and I am hard pressed to choose a favorite. I am glad my friend and I decided to share multiple plates as each was so different and resulted in such a fun experience. Portion sizes are reasonable, especially factoring in the pricing. While I have had better meals in Chicago, this might be the best dinner I have had at this price point. The only area of the menu lacking is dessert; there is only one option; while it sounded good (Deconstructed Candy Bar Platter) it was too rich for my taste and not up to par with the savories. Peasantry is still quite new and this is one area where they need to improve.  Beverage wise, Peasantry does not serve liquor, but has a great beer list. They have eight craft beers on tap that rotate frequently; these are all very high quality brews. I really enjoyed the Dogfish Head Festina Peche. There are also a handful of reasonably priced wines and their coffee features Lavazza beans. Our final tab for two starters, three entrees, truffle fries, one dessert, five beers and a cappuccino was just $127 before gratuity. We had a wonderful dinner, a great time and managed to leave with both a full belly and nearly full wallet! Peasantry has already become extremely popular (we had a short wait on a Thursday evening) and based on what we experienced tonight they are sure to thrive. I expect them to be awarded Bib Gourmand status next time Michelin updates their rankings. I do hope that Peasantry decides to start taking reservations in some form, as I really hate having to wait for a table, but they are off to an amazing start and should continue to improve. I will definitely be back and highly recommend dining here, especially to those with an adventurous palate.",0.9984,0.809,0.178,0.013,0.6150228675645342

There were 2 other tables there, it was before the dinner rush. Ther server was nice but did not know a lot about the menu, which was fine since he was probably still learning. We got the pigs in a blanket as an appetizer and it was just ok, it looked like something i can make at home and not worth the price. My boyfriend ordered the lamb burger and i ordered the bone marrow burger, we were going to split both. First I had half of his lamb burger and it was decent, he did not like it because it was too dry and he had already lost his appetite from the pigs in a blanket. Once i fininshed the half of the lamb burger i went on to the bone marrow burger. I literally could not take a bite from it because it smelled like a dead body. i dont know if this is because of the ""bone marrow"", since i have never had that before but i could not get myself to take a bite. my boyfriend, who has eaten bone marrow before did not take more than 1 bite. i was very disappointed and i will never come back here.

2012-05-30,4.0,"There is a picture of a pig with wings on the wall!  We came because we loved the other restaurant by the same owner, Franks 'n' Dawgs, and gave this a taste probably the first or second week they opened.  Food: Amazing! Rabbit stew - flavorfull, but a little heavy on the red wine for me, I could have used more rabbit. However, very tasty Lamb Flatbread - excellent, great idea, really loved the red-wine soaked feta with the pickeled lamb, it was delicious Shaved Brussel Sprout Salad - amazing. It has awesome citrus taste, crunch brussel sprout and shaved parmesan. Goes absolutely great with the meaty dishes, also very refreshing. Deconstructed Candy Bar - they one and only desert is really all you would ever need. It is actually 3 deserts - 1) a crumby sweetbread bar (kind of like the cookie in a Twix bar), 2) a soft chocolate brownie with caramelized sugar bits, and 3) a chocolate mouse. I honestly can't tell you what was better, but the sum was better than its parts Atmosphere: Not my favorite So, I might be critical when it comes to bars, and I love a certain cozyness to restaurants, but this did not frost my cookie. First of most tables have a long bench by the wall and a chair across it. The bench is wooden, and when we went, it was rickety, which isn't such a big deal. What is problematic is that it is a good 4-5 inches lower than the chair, so that my wife, sitting in the chair, found it rather uncomfortable to eat with the height of the table. The design was both rustic and modern, not my favorite combination. I loved the wood, the tables, the little japanese cast-iron tea pots that were converted into candle-holders, and I loved the big fireplace at the end. However, the brushed metal chairs, the bar (which was a little too shallow for comfortable seating), and the sparseness was not as appealing.  To sum up: Going back, but less often than to Franks 'n' Dawgs It is a lovely experience, and has some really innovative and delicious food, but the atmosphere was trying hard to be edgy and modern and rustic all at the same time, and lost me somewhere along the way.

Earlier that day, a friend had mentioned this new place, and we all marveled over the intriguing menu. I took a seat at the bar, ordered a beer, and had a quick chat with Alexander, the owner. He was very passionate and knowledgeable about his food and drink - already a good start. I ordered the chicken and corncake gyro - it's less ""gyro"" and more ""chicken and waffles."" But no matter what you call it, it was delicious. Alexander said they'd been adjusting the level of heat in the dish, and I found it adequate. The chicken was perfectly cooked - still moist inside, and very crispy and crunchy on the outside - a nice contrast to the corncake. The crisp apples provided a nice, tart balance.

It's worth 3 stars. But the bigger issue here is that I showed up with a group, one number larger than the table we were sat at. My wife and I were last to arrive - she took the last seat, and I asked our waiter, 2 other staffers and the owner for an extra seat - all to no avail. The waiter declined because ""the restaurant is an hour from its rush period, and others will need the remaining seats."" The 2 staffers said they would ""See what they could do"" and promptly ignored walking by us again. The owner declined based on fire code, but gave me a free beer to make up for the inconvenience of not having a seat. Neat. In the time it's taken to sort this out, I knelt on the floor by the table. Even that didn't earn me a chair. I'm currently sharing a friend's seat - one cheek on, one cheek off - solely because they won't provide a paying customer with one of two dozen free seats.  I'm big on customer service, and this is anything but. Update: We ended up staying for nearly two hours. I never received a chair.",0.6985,0.883,0.067,0.05,0.3772222222222223

Thank goodness there is a place like this in the neighborhood for craft beer, offal, and fat fanatics. I had an excellent sour beer, some amazing duck wings with buttermilk dressing and some cherry mustard, and an untraditional elote, which is corn covered with goodies - in this case blue cheese and pork rinds. The bone marrow burger is indeed very nice, with the marrow not completely blended in so it is distinctly luxurious. I really liked the pigs in a blanket, but the surprise was the delicious porky beans they come with that remind me of risotto.

We split a lamb burger and it was very flavorful. It is made with olives and that made the patty slightly too salty. However, it had a great slaw on top that had a nice clean acidic taste that enhanced the deep lamb flavor of the patty. I would definitely be happy to go back and try more dishes.",0.9837,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.5734920634920634
2012-05-19,4.0,"There's a big ass kangaroo painted on the wall. I like it.  But I didn't come here to stare at the walls - I came to eat a hanger steak and bone marrow burger topped with pickled cauliflower, shallot marmalade, arugula and manchego. While I didn't get to feel like a total barbarian and scrape the marrow out of roasted bones (my usual/favorite preparation of marrow), the burger was great. The bone marrow added the right amount of fat to the leaner hanger steak to make an awesome burger. My friend had the lamb burger, which while good, was physically overwhelmed by the aioli and asparagus pistou. She had to use a knife and fork to avoid the oily bottom bun. We shared the asparagus pasta and brussels sprouts salad. The nicely acidic sprouts salad usually comes with pistachios, but we had to do without since my friend has a nut allergy. I loved the peppery heat of the romesco on the pasta and the crusty bread that came on top. The pasta was pretty rich, and we kept alternating between the sprouts and pasta to cut the richness a bit. If we were not so full, I would have also gone for the pickled lamb tongue flatbread and an order of pigs in a blanket. I watched an order of pigs in a blanket pass by, and they looked/smelled really good. I can really appreciate the variety of meats on this smaller menu: duck wings, frog legs, chicken liver, lamb tongue, lamb, rabbit, etc. I also appreciate that most of the beers are $5.  There's only one option for dessert: the deconstructed candy bar platter. We were considering dessert but were told it has ""a LOT"" of nuts, so the decision was made for us. By the time we arrived, the only table open was the big, wooden communal table. Eventually two other groups of two sat there, but we never had someone right next to us. I liked the decor - it's a lot of wood and jar light fixtures and a fireplace and animal graffiti. The service was alright. Our waiter was nice, but he seemed either tired or just lackluster.  The Peasantry was a good (and not expensive) experience. I'll be back, because I seriously need those pigs in a blanket.",0.9946,0.799,0.164,0.037,0.583944658944659

2012-05-18,5.0,"This place is AMAZING.  I don't write many Yelp reviews, but I have to share my thoughts on this unique new addition to Clark Street.  It is fine dining food for a much more reasonable cost.  How can you beat that?!   The Food: First of all, I'll start by saying I'm vegetarian.  Typically when I go out to eat it's hard for me to find anything appetizing on the menu.  I'm stuck ordering an overpriced salad or bland veggie burger if lucky.  This is not the case at The Peasantry.  My husband and I ordered the Canellini Bean and Asparagus Salad, Beet Flatbread and Triple Truffle Fries to share.  The salad was very flavorful and fresh.  The asparagus was crisp, and I found myself wanting to scrape every last bit of chutney sauce out of the bowl.  Unlike my husband, I'm not a huge fan of beets but was willing to give the flatbread a try.  I'm so glad I did because the combinations of flavors (beets, goat cheese with a hint of citrus) made me forget I was even eating something I typically dislike.  The flatbread itself was the perfect consistency, crisp at the edges and soft in the middle.  As for the fries, there are no words to describe how delicious they are, as so many other reviewers have stated, so you're better off just taking a trip to The Peasantry to try them.   On to the main courses.  I ordered the Artichokes Pasta while my husband decided on the Lamb Burger.  The pasta yet again exceeded any expectations I had of a vegetarian dish at a non-vegetarian restaurant.  The homemade noodles were better than most I've had at the best Italian restaurants in the city.  Again, perfect consistency.  But what really made the pasta was the romesco sauce.  The sauce is hearty and has that right balance of acid from the tomatoes yet slightly sweet.  My husband ordered his lamb burger rare and said it was juicy and cooked just right.  We were both so full by the time the entrees came, we thought we couldn't possible finish them.  Of course by the end of dinner we had managed to eat everything minus a crumb or two to makes ourselves feel a little less guilty.  Needless to say the entire meal was phenomenal and service was great. The Atmosphere/Drinks: From the moment we walked in, we felt very relaxed and comfortable in our surroundings.  The fireplace adds an extra homeyness and ambiance, and the front bar is a great option for people watching.  We decided to eat at the bar and really appreciated the owner's wine and beer suggestions.  I tried the house white, and I must say it's the best house wine I've ever had.  There was no metallic taste or horrible finish.  It tasted more like a $12+ glass, so the fact that it was only $6.5 made me gladly order another.  My husband opted for beer and was happily surprised at the variety and quality of beers on tap.   Next time you're trying to decide what to eat for dinner, take a trip to Clark Street and check out The Peasantry.  I promise you will not be disappointed!",0.9982,0.776,0.178,0.046,0.5580881358225108

2012-05-17,4.0,"On my way up and down Clark I noticed the construction going on in this location and got really excited just by the name of the restaurant. I finally decided to stop in and check it out after asking them if I could look over the menu for 10 minutes and I completely lost track of time as I read it. So I had a hard time deciding between the shrimp & lobster roll and the tur-doggin sausage. They were out of the lobster which was great because it helped me decide what to order. So it has turkey date sausage, pickled carrot, duck confit, garlic aioli, onion relish - on a new england lobster roll. And let me say the lobster roll was a proper/traditional roll. Everything was delicious and I could taste all the ingredients. As soon as I bit into it I could totally taste the dates. I also loved the picked carrots and the duck confit topper. It came with a small slice of corn bread on the side and was really fresh and didn't need butter. We split the triple truffle fries. THEY ARE WAFFLE FRIES- this blew my mind bc I didn't see that description on the menu and I originally wanted to get the regular fries bc they are also waffle. Turns out the truffle fries are the best of both worlds. I know I will be ordering them every time I eat here. Also perfect for splitting at the table because a little truffle oil goes a long way. As a bonus they have house red and white wine. I tried both and recommend ordering both. I've recently become a fan of house wine to help keep my alcohol part of my tab lower than the food so I can order more things to eat. They also have wine pairing suggestions next to every item on the menu which is really helpful in deciding what to drink and creates a self guided tour of the menu. The prices are completely reasonable and I cannot wait to go back and work my way down/around the rest of the menu.

I did not expect this quality for the price point.  I mean the most expensive thing on the menu was $13 and most of their ingredients are sourced from local farms. We ordered the following: Pigs in a blanket- chorizo wrapped in a puff pastry served with white beans cooked in pancetta.  The beans were a bit salty due to the pancetta, but my friend liked the extra salt.  The poblano crema paired well with the chorizo. Porky goodness. Duck burger-the meat was tender, juicy and seasoned well. It also came with foie gras (what a deal!) and mustard greens. Triple truffle waffle fries-the waiter suggested these when we ordered the burger.  It looked greasy, but tasted like heaven. These are not your average truffle fries. Pork belly gyro- they had me at pork belly. They were meaty, crispy and not fatty at all. The slaw had apples which I loved.   The best part was the bread, it was a corn pancake, slightly sweet and crispy and chewy. Sooo good. Get this as an app and share.",0.9956,0.758,0.242,0.0,0.478125
2012-05-14,3.0,I have very mixed feelings about this restaurant. I went there with my son on Saturday night. The interesting craft beers first caught my attention. The menu had interesting items. My son ordered a baby octopus gyro. He said it was fantastic. I ordered the lamb burger. That was my big mistake. I was not asked how I wanted it cooked. It came with about a 1/4 inch char and the rest was RAW. The waiter asked how it was and said it was way undercooked. He just walked away. The hostess asked and I told her and the owner came right out and apologized. I'm not a restaurant complainer!! I should have said something earlier and sent it back instead of just eating to cooked part. The owner sent over a dessert and a pour of their dessert wine. It was handled very well which gets me to my mixed feelings. I got very sick that night with severe vomiting. All the symptoms of food poisoning. I can't help to blame it on the raw lamb burger. Although it could be a coincidence that I got sick but I felt fine before dinner. I feel really bad about this!,-0.7548,0.835,0.074,0.091,0.481819650937298

2012-05-13,5.0,"The Peasantry is fantastic. It's an upscale take on basic street food that makes it both comforting and interesting to try. We had the Mussels, which were fantastic  (you'll end up wanting to drink the broth, or at least get more bread to sop it up, it's amazing) - and I'm not even a big fan of mussels. I had the Beef and Bone Marrow burger.  It was packed with flavor and was a nice diversion from a typical burger.  We also tried the Rabbit Pasta, which was delicious. Admittedly I'd never had rabbit before and didn't know what to expect, but it was great. Their beer selection is a great combo of local / artisinal beers with plenty of your favorites (but a focus on finding new and interesting beers for you to try out).  Their wine selection is similarly extensive, but as I'm not a wine drinker I won't comment other than to say I doubt you'll be unable to find something interesting - the wine list is plenty lengthy. I'll definitely be back to The Peasantry once a month or so (which, given my propensity to want to try new restaurants whenever I go out, is saying a lot)",0.9871,0.795,0.183,0.022,0.5201101928374656

If you like the standard ""Chicken and Waffles"" most new restaurants are starting to dish up these days, you'll their ""Chicken and Pancakes"" they serve it Gyro style here!

2012-04-24,5.0,"The Peasantry is a new stand out restaurant in the bustling Clark and Diversy neighborhood that is a welcome addition to the fast service chains that dominate the area (I'm looking at you Panera, Chipotle, Jimmy Johns, Jamba Juice, etc. etc.).  From the street The Peasantry omits a soft glow and the décor is homey and welcoming. They have somehow managed to create the perfect combination of urban cool and log cabin warm and the menu is a further reflection of that theme. It is smattered with comfort and street food favorites, each with a twist. A little bone marrow with that burger, some rabbit in that homemade pasta, a sprinkling of truffles on those fries - don't mind if I do. Each dish has a unique component that takes it to the next level without being overdone.  I always commend a restaurant that has a limited menu but executes each item perfectly, and they seemed to achieve that here. While the number of items is limited, there is something for everyone and the great appetizers and sides offer plenty of opportunities to share and taste.  What put The Peasantry over the top for me was an expertly put together wine list that is both interesting and accessible. And the best part? A great glass only sets you back about $7. When was the last time that you got anything other than a watery glass of some mass produced house blend for less than $7!  Standouts from the menu include the housemande chorizo which was in the 'pig in a blanket' and the mussels. Also LOVED the onion marmalade on the burger and the tender, crispy, savory deliciousness of the chicken and pancakes. The ingredients are white tablecloth fancy schmancy but the prices are weeknight reasonable as is the atmosphere. Seems like a great spot to come with a group of friends or on a casual date. One other point about The Peasanty that deserves mentioning is the layout. They have a quaint bar at the front where you can saddle up for some wine and food and one long bench in the dining room provides lots of options for groups of all sizes. As a single lady and a frequent traveler I am often faced with the dilemma of wanting a high quality restaurant meal but not wanting to elicit the infamous 'table for one' from the host.
