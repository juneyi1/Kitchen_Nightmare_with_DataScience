2016-02-25,4.0,"So, I've been to the Breakroom several times now and it's time for a review. This place is within walking distance from my place and naturally I was excited for it to open.  I've come here for the $15 burger special on Wednesday. Burger, beer and a shot for $15 is an incredible deal. The burger is delicious. Cooked perfectly and the addition of brie and liver mousse really push it over the edge. I've had the burger a couple times (with & without the decadent add-ons) and it never disappointed. The charcuterie here is also very good as are the cheese curds! I've probably never met a curd that I didn't like but I'm partial to battered curds. In my opinion it's how all cheese curds should be done. And Breakroom has em with tomato basil sauce for dipping. The crispy pork sandwich is also extremely tasty and may be my new go-to. Roasted pork with sliced pears, endive, Roquefort and a delicious horseradish sauce? YES.  My only slight disappointment with Breakroom's food is their fries. Skinny fries are not my thing. Don't get me wrong, I still eat them. They are good and crispy here but I personally prefer a more substantial French fry. But the space, specifically the bar, is wonderful. They have a nice selection of beer on tap, wines and also their own root beer. I also love that this brew-pub opens up to the outside in the right weather. Fresh air is important, y'all.

2016-02-12,2.0,"I've been here about seven or eight times since it opened last year. It's gotten gradually worse each time, but tonight crossed the line into incompetence in the kitchen and a general lack of care that comes with management problems and a struggle for survival. The hefeweizen they brew there is as close to undrinkable as any beer I've ever tried -- the finish tasted like what wheatpaste smells like. The steak tartare is usually a safe bet but tonight's example was sour and overly seasoned to cover up a bad cut of meat, and wouldn't you know it, there was a sizable piece of gristle in there -- never found that in tartare before, anywhere. The wings have changed since last time, for the worse (tough since last time I had to send them back because they were undercooked) -- now they're way soggy and almost gummy, and the batter breading did it no favors. My wife got fish and chips which she rated as below average, and I took one bite of my daughter's grilled cheese to understand why she didn't want any. This is a nice space with potential that is wasted on mediocre food and beer, and the  lack of attention to detail that follows a struggling business. The service here is good, which gets them the second star, but there's a reason this place doesn't have an hour plus wait for dinner anymore; the prices have stayed high but there's nothing there to justify them.

2016-02-08,2.0,"My friends and I made the mistake of watching the Super Bowl at Breakroom. We called ahead and were told that they were hosting a party for the game; projector screen, specials and a crowd. We were, in fact, encouraged to reserve a table to make sure we'd have seating. That was unnecessary. I arrived first, took a seat at the bar, ordered a beer, then an order of cheese curds. The bartender was great, we chatted, he said something about a raffle for a growler, he did good bartender things. The problems started once the rest of our party arrived and we went to our table. From the jump our waiter acted like we were putting him out by sitting in his section. You would think that having 10 people sit in your section looking to spend 4 hours eating and drinking in a restaurant that was otherwise empty would be a good thing. Not to our waiter, he was short, he ignored one of our party's empty glass every time he came by and was generally unpleasant.  Second, the projector wasn't working. Not sure why you wouldn't check that out before your Super Bowl party or why, upon realizing it wasn't working you wouldn't pop out and replace it but they didn't. So, the game was on three screens one of which had horizontal lines running through it all game. On top of the less than ideal viewing situation we couldn't hear the game either. We were right in the middle of the bar and, as I said, there wasn't much of a crowd besides us. We asked repeatedly and they said it was as loud as it would get.  As far as the food and drink, their beer is decent, nothing special but at $5-$7 drafts the price is right. The food is mediocre, my buyer wasn't cooked to temp and the entire table got cold cries. Folks were raving about the mussels, I thought they were fine.  All things considered, I'd say pop in if you're in the area and want a few reasonably priced beers but go elsewhere to eat and never go there expecting to watch a game.",0.936,0.86,0.096,0.044,0.5623787477954145

2015-12-07,5.0,"This place is a great time. Food and drink are well worth the visit.  It's easily the biggest bar in the area, which is such a rare thing to have in Irving/Albany neighborhoods. The ambiance is relaxed and casual. Typical brewery style of dark wood, with a nice big old style bar, although everything is brand new. Plenty of room here. Music is more the rock, indie, metal, punk stuff that's typical of Chicago breweries these days. They have good TV coverage, and a large drop down screen for games. Expect them to host the local games. They also have upstairs balcony room for private events, or just overflow.  I have what I think is a accurate, well rounded palette when it comes to beer. Been drinking the good stuff since the mid-90's and grew as the scene developed though it's various phases of over the top beers with an obnoxious punch, to Belgiums, IPA explosion, to sours, to stouts, to the current well balanced beers, and a focus on quality lagers. I even love Hamm's. I'll try to simply describe the character of Breakroom's beers without the personal opinion B.S. At least you'll know what to expect, rather than know my personal tastes.  The beers as a whole, have a well balanced light refreshing nature, following the current trend. The hoppy stuff tends to be of the lighter citrus like grapefruity types. They also have very nice handle on the types of wheat Belgium hoppy crossovers that been coming to popularity in recent years. Many of their wheats, (which I typically do not go for) are exceptionally good, because they are not sweet. They also have a old wine barrel for sours, which they fuse wheat beers with as well, giving them a nice sour bite. Not your typical wheat beers. Very interesting stuff, and I want to stress again, refreshing and light is the name of the game. Except for their porter, which is a nice rich porter with coffee notes. Not too sweet. I could drink this for days. Their Artis Dream IPA is a nice aggressively hopped IPA, with cirtus like charecters. Again, all of these beers follow the typical trends, so I think they are spot on with style. If you're looking for sickly strong beers, with high ABV hitting in over 7%-8%, then this might not be the place for you; although I don't think too many breweries in Chicago fall into that category, (thinking of Founder's, and FFF). They do switch up beers all the time, besides the 4-5 anchors, so expect to see something different every time you walk in. They also host half their taps from local breweries as well their own. The food is a strong point here. The old chef from The Gauge runs the kitchen/menu, and he does what I would say, is an up scale spin on brew pub food. Everything I've had has been above par. The steak tartar here is the best I've ever tried, (spicy and smoked). My friend actually texts me about once a month with just the words, ""steak tartar?"" and drives across the city to have it. My only flaw in the menu is a lack of healthy eats, but then again, no one goes to a brew pub to eat healthy or light, but there are a few items. They do brunch well here I should add that they have wine on tap here. The liquor stock is minimal, as expected, but they do have a nice specialty cocktail list on the menu, which I've never tried, but looks to be your typical designer cocktail stuff you see at every gastropub these days.  I give this place 5 stars because they are the smaller, new guys to the scene, and I think they hit on all points. I also love that it's not over crowded and tucked away in a neighborhood. If you want a nice big brewery night, with out the mob scene, and with good food, this might be your place. I stop by often, and not just because I live close by.

First off I want to say that its nice that there are more of these spots popping up around the albany pank/irving park area which had nothing fun and exciting going on.  It's cool to have something nearby to walk to or a short drive. Having said that... The place is a nice looking spot, the lay out is nice and open and fits plenty of people.  It's a brewery, it has a rustic feel.  Plenty of Tv's and always playing something different. The beer is pretty good,  It's nice to have some fresh brew something unique from the typical brands you purchase.  They have a good variety and have tastes for everyone.  There are a few more I wouldn't mind still trying, but they keep running out.. so they must be good.  They have cocktails as well.. but I'm really starting to get tired of everyone thinking they have ""crafty cocktails"" and charging a lot for them.  I'll pass.. I can make Manhattans at home for goodness sake... when did a Manhattan become crafty!? It's two different types of booze!!  I'll stick with their actual specialty.. beer! The food... was disappointing.  we tried a couple dishes and was just not impressed.  It's that horrible feeling of the food wanting to be something its not.  It tries to be ""elevated"" to something but it just does not get there.  The food seems over priced and I really am not compelled to try more to be quit honest.  It's bar food in my opinion, I don't see much more beyond that. The service is very good, the waitstaff is very attentive and courteous.  The few times we've been there everyone has been great. I think if I were to go back its because of the beer and and the service and its nearby.  It's a cool spot to hang... I'm not in love with the place.. but, I'll go on occasion. you should try it...

2015-10-25,4.0,"UPDATE:  Reported closed, summer 2016 ________________ Another of the recent bloom of Chicago brewpub openings, in operation since the Spring of 2015.  This is a large, open room in a converted light-industrial building, with wooden roof trusses, some exposed ductwork, and an attractive (though newly-built) wooden back-bar, through which the some of the brewing floor can be glimpsed.  Additional seating available on a sort of balcony over the main bar area.  Big windows overlook Montrose Avenue.  Several TVs tuned to sports programming, and unobtrusive background music.  Open evenings daily, and for brunch on weekends. No sampler assortment is offered, but all beers are available in 5-ounce tulip glasses at $3 a pop.  At the time of my visit, six items were on tap: - Noble Gray Nitro Porter.  ABV is variously described as 5.8% or 6.2%.  Opaque dark brown, medium head.  Light nose is mostly roast malt.  Taste is intense roast malt, with a long bitter fade ending on a sour note. - Artis American Dream IPA.  6% ABV, 75 IBU.  Brassy-gold color, light ""Belgian lace"" head.  Citrus nose reflects citra hops.  Rather fizzy mouth-feel.  Substantial hoppiness, a bit of funk, and a Mandarin orange note at the end.   - Zuri Hop Belgian Pale Ale.  5%, 65 IBU.  Cloudy orange-gold, halo head.  Phenolic ""Band-Aid"" note in the nose.  Yeast is a definite flavor element, and there is more ethanol presence than the modest ABV figure would suggest.  There's a touch of grapefruit in the finish. - Breakfast Oktoberfest Marzen.  5%.  Clear copper, light head.  Minimal nose.  Malt-forward, rather dry, not as sweet as many Marzens.  Fizzy mouth-feel. - Imperial Alba Imperial India Pale Ale.  8%, 95 IBU.  Clear brassy-gold, with a light head shrinking to a halo.  Nose is a burst of piney aromatic hops and a hint of some sort of fruit.  Hop-forward taste, against a substantial malt base.   - Wide Ryed Rye Strong Ale.  9%, 35 IBU.  Cloudy chestnut, light head.  Moderate hop nose.  Taste is dominated by sweet malt and ethanol, dry-hopped with mosaic and amarillo.  Smooth and even oily mouth-feel.  Rye and honey are both included in the fermentables, but only the latter was apparent to me in the taste.  Definitely my favorite of the flight. Fair public transit access.  On the 78-Montrose bus line, connecting with the Brown Line at Montrose or the Red Line at Wilson.  Alternatively, a 3/8 mile walk from the Francisco Brown Line station.  For pub crawlers, about a mile west of Fountainhead.",0.9772,0.878,0.092,0.031,0.47093406593406584

My buddy mentioned that this place would be our destination on a nice Friday night so I was like cool. I drove over from Uptown and got a parking space on the side of the building which was awesome as it was the last space. I was the first of my group that arrived so I got a seat at the bar to wait. As I looked around I noticed the nice sized space as well as the upstairs area. I love the huge chalkboard beer menu behind the bar as its easy to pick out which brew you wanna go with. The staff behind the bar was very nice to me and kept me straight on what beers were a must try. I started with the Noble Gray against the advice of a guy who worked there but happened to be dining. The Noble Gray is porter with notes of caramel, chocolate and coffee. It was good, but his recommendation was so much better...The Mutiny which i think was a porter as well was very good and much better than the Noble Gray.  My group of 6 showed up and there was a table available for us instantly, near the back of the place. We had a very cool server named Ryan that was very awesome an accommodating. He told us the beer battered calamari was awesome so we went with it and it was very good...the cheese curds were decent as well. I was conflicted with the crispy pork sandwich and the chicken sandwich, but Ryan and the guy behind the bar told me the crispy pork was righteous.  They told me only get it if I am a fan of horseradish and pear...I am! The sandwich was good and crisp but the horseradish was in full effect...maybe could have held back on it a bit, but it was still good. I tried another beer called the Wide Ryed Strong Ale which was 9% alcohol content and was very good...it literally knocked my ass out....I had 2 of them!",0.9971,0.779,0.209,0.012,0.6096464646464647

2015-10-02,4.0,"My cohort and I met up for their Wednesday burger special. A Burger, Beer and a shot for $15.  It's not widely advertised but saw it on their FB page.  We were warmly greeted by the hostess and arrived early enough for dinner that we were able to snag a high top table by the open garage door along Montrose.  It's not the most scenic view, but it did allow for some fun people and dog watching.  The space is a cross between a saloon (the huge wooden bar was pretty gorgeous) to the industrial brewing area. Our servers were very nice and friendly.  The menu isn't huge, but it lists appetizers/shared plates, salads, steak, chicken, burgers, sandwiches.    BB picks the brew for their Wednesday special and when we visited it was the Gwenith which is their basic American wheat beer--I wished they would have let us choose the beer because I really wanted the Zuri or Makellos because sometimes it's just a one and done night. But the Gwenith was refreshing and a great light beer.  We opened with the charcuterie plate, the standout to me was the liver mousse and the pickled veg.  I loved the grilled bread served with it too. The presentation was really pretty and I would order it again in a heartbeat.  My burger was made to order--medium. The burger patty was ok, nothing too special, but the onion jam and bacon elevated it. Of course I had to try my son's grilled cheese and that was pretty good.  And his kiddie cocktail was perfect. Fries all around were good--couldn't stop eating those! But then again, I do love fries!",0.998,0.743,0.257,0.0,0.5944081632653061
2015-09-21,4.0,"Went on a Saturday night. Understandably the host said it would be about a half hour wait. So  she took our name and number and we headed across the street to the Montrose Saloon. They have an excellent beer list so we felt that we were headed in the right direction. One of the cooler things I've seen was the fact that Breakroom would text us when our table was ready. In fact they even said we could log in to a site which would show us our approximate wait time remaining and how many other tables in front of us. It was pretty cool.  So of course, not even 5 minutes after we got our beers at Montrose Saloon, our table was ready. We asked the host if they could hold our table for five minutes, to which she obliged.  Great things: The beer. Really, really good beer. Get the scotch egg, and the mussels. I wish we could've gotten more bread for dipping in the mussels gravy. Or some fries. Yeah, that would've been awesome.  Good things: The burger. The beef could use a bit of s&p or something else. Same for the fish & chips. Just needed something.  Things to work on: Service. Our server was awesome. But he was also spread pretty thin. This is where his team could fill in the gaps. Twice we had to ask for utensils and plates. And our plates took a pretty long time to clear. I know this sounds like whining.

The fries I ordered on the side were good, though. Until that moment when my food arrived and after I'd tried several of their beers, I was almost starting to wish I had went to Begyle instead, since I was debating between going here or Begyle, and this won out. Plus I liked that Breakroom had a dart area, which you can use when you give the staff a driver's license/state ID. Balcony area also looked nice, albeit slightly small. Didn't notice any noisy kids that some have noted in reviews when I came in around 9-9:30pm, so maybe they cutoff when kids can be here by a certain time like 8:30? Breakroom overall wasn't bad, but I'm not in a hurry to come back here when it comes to their beer. Glad it did open in this area, since I remember when there were once few places(and that they were mainly divey) years ago to drink and/or eat on both Irving Park and Montrose west of the river.

This is a true sign of a great chef in their kitchen! Anybody can throw a bunch of junk food together and make it taste good. It takes an expert to take that food and make every bite delicious. I don't think they have an outdoor seating area, which would be amazing, but I did notice a big overhead door they can open when the weather is nice. I really hope this place does well and expands their menu a bit. Definitely a great local restaurant!",0.9968,0.644,0.33,0.026,0.5825834879406308

What we're concerned with is the service - there was ample waitstaff people on the floor, but it took 30 min. to receive our drinks (when we were the 2nd party to arrive once they opened @ 1p). Also, the food took an additional 20 min, so almost an hour after ordering. The Bloody Mary mix wasn't being served for some reason, but again, it took 1/2 hr for a server to let us know it wouldn't be available. After the lengthy waits, and limited water glasses on the table, we thought a server would return to the table sooner. Also, delayed service on a holiday (Mother's Day) where it was obvious other customers  were also trying to get their servers' attention is an issue the Break Room should work on correcting. Most of the waitstaff  were hanging around the bar talking to each other rather than addressing patron tables.

2015-05-03,5.0,"After dining & drinking at the actual brewery multiple times and drinking different varieties of their brews at various bar takeovers, tastings, etc., I feel like I can give a decent review of the place.  Food: I initially visited on a Friday during Lent so I limited my food sampling to calamari and cheese and crackers.  The calamari was spot-on.  Served hot and not overly breaded.  The lemon aioli complemented the dish well.  The cheese and crackers are just that-- hunks of cheese and breakable crostini on a wooden board with a side of sweet jam.  The cheese includes roquefort and brie. Yum, bleu cheese! I went back with some friends and one ordered the burger, another ordered the crispy pork and I had the chicken.  My friends enjoyed their meals and my sandwich was great.  I really enjoyed the sliced grapes atop the chicken. Beer: They're a brewery.  Their brews are forever rotating.  I enjoy the hoppier varieties, so I stick to anything brewed with citra or mosaic hops.  That said, now that's it getting warmer out, I'm excited to try their kolsch. Service: Excellent.  I sat up at the bar during one of the busier times that I was there.  I truly enjoyed watching Danny the bartender make multi-step concoctions between pouring brews.  I have yet to try a mixed drink at the brewery, but their Manhattans and Old Fashions look amazing.  The people that have waited on me have been knowledgable about food & drink, quick to grab extra ketchup, and thorough.   Overall: Woohoo!  I'm quite pleased with my experiences so far.  I'm glad they're in the neighborhood.",0.9907,0.826,0.168,0.006,0.533087027914614

2015-04-30,3.0,"First, if you hate children you need to go somewhere else, like a bar such as Scofflaw that's like ""GET THAT BABY OUT!""  People move to neighborhoods like this one because they want to stay in the cook county tax bracket without living in a cramped condo near 4am bars.  It's inevitable children might come in.  Who the eff cares?  Props to Breakroom for being welcoming to parents that god forbid want some local beers with their lunch.  (I'm not a parent, I just don't get why parents are made to feel like they can't drink some beers and eat some food in public just because they have a child.) I didn't have high hopes coming here so I was actually surprised to find a few beers I liked.  Friends managed to get here before us (and 15 minutes before open) and jumped in the already forming line.  They managed to get us a table and had their flight by the time we walked in, so that's something to consider.  You can get seated without the full party being there.   Our server came over immediately, we both ordered their DIPA and then we waited...and waited...and waited.  That opening rush slammed the bar for a good 20-30 minutes at least.  For a little while after that it was relatively smooth service.  Getting the check was difficult and when we moved to the bar the bartender proceeded to ignore one of us (hint, it wasn't me.)  We didn't order food, but I'd definitely come back to try some dishes as many looked good.  Their beer was so-so.  I was pretty underwhelmed with their choices and my friend who did a flight only ended up liking about 2 (but I don't do flights because they're only slightly better than samples and don't really indicate a true taste....and she's picky.)

2015-04-28,5.0,"We hit this place last Friday and I haven't stopped thinking about it since! Normally I abjure any suggestion of trying a brand new restaurant until it has had time to work out the kinks. Nevertheless, my wife was itching to go, so we did... and I am eternally grateful. No kinks at all. I'm not a big Brew Pub guy, but the beer was good. The place has a hip/cool industrial set-up ( as it should be being that it's owned by a company that builds bars). Huge bar, big open dining space and a garage door that presumably will open up for outdoor seating in the summer. When we arrived at 7pm place was packed and pretty noisy. We were told there was a 20 min wait, but you can drink while you wait and so we did. I'm not sure why we couldn't wait at the bar, but it was 3 people deep anyway, so we were ushered to a corral of barrels (tables) and given beer menus. Drank some beer and liked it. Once seated I ordered the Scotch Egg. For whatever reason, I am fascinated by Scotch eggs and order them whenever possible. This one was by far the BEST (sorry Gage). It was served on a bed of mixed greens and vinaigrette. The outside was crisp falafel and the yolk was nice and runny. Once it was diced up the whole thing transformed into a fantastic little salad. And while that was a nice surprise, the Heinemann burger with liver mousse (optional) was the HIGHLIGHT of my 2015! Just f@@cking AWSOME! The burger was cooked perfectly and came with cheese and stuff on it, but I am so glad I added the mousse. It was perfect! Not too livery and the perfect hint of wine. Exceptional! I will gladly brave the crowds, noise and wait to get back to one of those burgers! Aside from that our server was a delightful guy and my wife enjoyed whatever it was that she had... which wasn't the burger with liver mousse, so who cares?",0.9984,0.754,0.231,0.015,0.6610814022578728

Cheese and crackers were a nice addition to munch on however just as a suggestion, I wish the cheeses that were on the platter were listed on the menu. We did not think to ask. Bleu cheese was one of the cheese and my friend sharing the dish hates Bleu cheese (I love it so it worked out). Noble Gray porter was delicious! More chocolate flavor then roasty flavor which I enjoy in any stout or porter. I do enjoy the fact that they offer sample size portions. Prices for beer are very reasonable. Most are low ABV which allowed my group to try more of them. Aurum IPA was a sessionable IPA. Very drinkable and enjoyable. Service was attentive and courteous but not intrusive at all.

Super cool atmosphere, think warehouse, exposed beams, charcoal walls.. The space is beautiful. I like all their beers, especially the rye pale ale. (It is a shame to see a bad review because someone didn't like the style of one of the beers they tried.) We've been back three times since the opening, and have had lots of delicious food. Their menu is a lot of fun. The calamari is a good sized portion, and has bits of fried gardiniera in it (!). The steak tartar is served in a smokey mason jar, smells heavenly, with just the right amount of kick and seasoning to it. Highly recommended. The scotch egg is a larger sized appetizer than you'd think and very good. The pickled vegetables, also served in a mason jar, were so lovely- I imagine the contents change, but mine had some unexpected veggies in there, which was such a nice surprise. The burger is great (you can add foie), and though I haven't tried it, the cauliflower steak looks so good, and I love that this is an option on the menu, for non meat eaters. Lastly, regarding food, the pork rinds are an absolute MUST! Order those right when you sit down- perfect thing to snack. I haven't had anything except beer here, but it's pretty awesome they have several wines on tap here too. And their cocktail list looks perfectly curated. I must try soon, if I can pry myself away from their rye beer. Misc. comments: music is a smidgen loud sometimes. Love the female bartender here- very attentive.

Very, very cool place, especially the upstairs as you wait - nice touch. (Semi) Cons: - The food is decent.  Not bad, but not good enough for the prices.  You can have mediocre food - nothing wrong with that, especially for a brewery.  But it has to be priced right.  Cut the portions back (they are huge) and lower the prices. Cons: - (As many others have stated) The sound is just insane! There is this ridiculously loud sound sound system cranked, bouncing off of a massively high, tin ceiling.  Everything - music, the Blackhawks game, etc - is completely inaudible.  A sound engineer alone could make this place  go from good to great.

2015-04-20,3.0,"Finally got the chance to stop in here. It was a hit-and-miss experience for me.  TL;DR VERSION FOR ADHD SUFFERERS: The music was too loud, the beer was just OK, the ambiance is stuffy and formulaic but beautifully done, the menu is too fussy and pricey, the service was top notch, and they programmed their Point-of-Sale system not to double-tax your drinks when you order food (believe it or not, most drinking establishments don't do this so your drinks are double-taxed if you order food). FULL VERSION: THE MISSES - The music: TURN THAT SHIT DOWN. Jesus fking Christ. This is a brewpub and restaurant, not a bloody dance club. I get that you want everyone to experience your seismic sound system and your super-hip, cutting-edge taste in music, but the bartender and I shouldn't have to shout at each other to be heard when there's only 12 other patrons in the entire place. - The beer. It's... OK. And with everything else going for this place, ""OK"" may be adequate. But for me, I judge a brewpub by its beer first and foremost; everything else is secondary. I tried every house beer except the porter, and every one of them except the Berliner had an astringently dry finish, even the Kolsch and the IPAs described as having a ""balanced"" flavor profile. Also, every beer is served in a snifter whether it's appropriate to the style or not. With the local craft-beer and brewpub scene heating up and providing more options than ever (or at least since the pre-prohibition days), this beer just isn't gonna cut it for me. - The ambiance. This is actually both a ""hit"" and ""miss"" for me. The interior is beautifully done, as one would expect from people who design and build bar interiors for a living, with very detailed woodwork (e.g. the wooden columns on the bar back) and vaulted ceilings with exposed rafters and what-not. But it feels a little too polished and formulaic (""Hey look, it's a vintage warehouse converted into a brewpub!!"" Yeah yeah, BTDT) -- almost like it's as much or more a showcase for their bar-building business as a place to get comfortable with a session brew. - The menu. I want to be clear, it's not the food that's a miss, but the menu. I didn't actually try any of the food because, well, it was awfully stuffy and pricey for brewpub fare. I realize this isn't unique to Breakroom; in fact, I don't understand why every new bar or brewpub these days is seemingly aiming for a Bib Gourmand nod from Michelin. What the hell is ""gochujang ketchup"" and why would I want it on my lamb scrumpet? What's wrong with good ol' Heinz ketchup? And what the hell is a scrumpet? This is a beer joint -- can't I just get some pizza or wings? THE HITS: -The ambiance. Despite my misgivings per above, it's undeniably an impressive space. - Attentive staff. It probably helped that the place was at least 2/3rds empty, but sometimes that actually works against customer service by lulling staff into complacency. No problems here, multiple servers made sure I was never without a beer if I needed one. - Having the stones to open a place like this in... well, let's face it, this isn't exactly a destination neighborhood if you don't already live around here. Maybe that will change with the help of Breakroom and nearby Templestowe. - Breaking out the drink tax as a separate line item. A $5 drink here rings up as $4.XX plus a separate line for the tax to bring the total price up to $5. Here's why that matters: most don't know that a drink price includes tax because it's built into the price and they never see the tax as a separate item on their tab like they would for a food order. The upshot then is that when you add, say, a plate of wings to your drink order, your drinks are often taxed again because the bar doesn't remove the tax from the drink price  before adding it to your food bill and taxing the whole tab. Consequently, when you order food, your drinks are almost always double-taxed. Just as a matter of principle, I can't fking stand having my drinks double-taxed whenever I order food just because the establishment is too lazy to program their POS system to tax drinks only once. (And chances are they're actually pocketing the difference rather than remitting it to the government as taxes.) By separating out the tax on drink items, Breakroom ensures your drinks are only taxed once even if you order food. Thank you Breakroom for doing this. It seems like a no-brainer but very, very few bars/taverns/whatever have programmed their POS terminals to not double-tax drinks when a food order is added. In short, I like this place and it's a very welcome addition to the neighborhood, but I don't intend to be a regular unless a) the beers improve, and b) I don't have to endure music blasting at ear-rupturing volume for no apparent reason.",0.9918,0.838,0.108,0.053,0.5096855501400958

Food:  Started with beer cheese soup which I normally find to be hit or miss.  This one was a hit.  Super creamy and flavorful.  My entree was the chicken thighs with bicsuits and sausage gravy.  My only compaint is that it was so delicious that I could have eaten an entire other portion in addition to my own.  You get three chicken thighs and two fairly large biscuits.  You will not have leftovers.  The chicken was super tender and the skin was crispy and a little burnt (I love that).  For dessert (yes, we are pigs) we got the stout cake.  For $7, I expected a huge piece of cake like you normally get at restaurants, but this was a cute little maybe 2 inch around circle of cake.  Good enough for a few bites each between two people.  Very chocolatey and rich. So, the soup and the tiny cake were $7 each which is slightly annoying because it's soup and a tiny cake, but whatever.  The food and beer and service were good enough that I forgot about / didn't care that my portion of the bill was $80.  We were there for a good 4 hours, too.  The beer is very reasonably priced - the 13 oz. glasses run $5 or $6, and $7 I believe for the Imperial IPA. One last note about the service - our waitress was unbelievable.  The place was packed and we had 5 people in our group, all drinking at difference paces.  None of us was ever without a beer.  This woman was amazing.  Other servers filled up our waters constantly, too.  We never once had to search for our waitress or wonder when she was coming back.  It was great. I will be back here many, many times.  So happy this place is finally open!!",0.9965,0.816,0.167,0.018,0.6157610544217686
2015-04-05,2.0,"Stopped by on a Saturday afternoon 13 minutes after it opened. The hostess let us know the wait for a table would be thirty minutes even though there were over 5 tables that were empty and no sign of any RSVP or reservation.  Why did we have to wait 30 minutes?    No explanation was given because it's just so logical that you have to wait 30 minutes for a table when there are 5 tables open. We left our name with the hostess and went upstairs where we were able to order a drink.  I started the stopwatch on my phone and despite being busy the beer arrived promptly in five minutes. I ordered a Noble Gray, which is an American Porter - every other beer on the menu was Pale Ale or Indian Pale Ale.  The beer selection only had 5 beers and although they all were on tap, there were no other beers on the menu.  The Noble Gray was tasty with a medium finish and was flavorful. That's all I can tell you about Breakroom Brewery.  Forty minutes went by and the upstairs waiting area got more packed, the server never came back to ask if we needed more drinks and no one ever came up to let us know our table was ready. I really wanted to love this brewery and try all of their beers and eat some of the menu that looked delicious, but they've got a lot of work to do.  I don't think I'll come back here for a long time.",0.5547,0.92,0.043,0.037,0.4254347826086957
2015-04-04,3.0,"If you like that hoppy flavor in your local microbrew aftertaste, this place is for you. Riding the American populist wave of preference to small batch ale, this hip space is crammed with all walks of life. I happen to dislike hoppy microbrews, so it was largely unpalatable. They don't serve outside beer. I sent one awful beer back but still had to pay $6 for it. Too crowded to try to ask for an exchange. Since I'm not a fan of this type of beer its hard to say if the brewmaster sucks or if that's how that's supposed to go. We know one of the waiters so it was nice seeing a familiar face. Bartenders are friendly too. Didn't get food, too crowded. Am interested to see how long this trend will last and how long this concept can keep bringing large crowds to Montrose Ave. Seems to draw as a novelty right now. Kept seeing expressions of wonder on first timers walking through the door. How many of those people will be back? Reminded me a little of Greenbush in Sawyer but urban. Likely some crossover in the patronage.",0.6127,0.87,0.068,0.063,0.3910218253968254
2015-04-03,5.0,"I was able to attend the 'soft opening' for the brewery. The space is gorgeous, the fine details of the wood work looks awesome and the place is very clean. The beers taste well above average and are reasonably priced.  Bottom line: Anyone looking to have a good brew or two with friends/family should most definitely check this place out.

2015-04-03,4.0,"During the day you have to look really hard and pay attention to find this place, at night, not so much. Breakroom just opened, and towards the end of our stay, the crowd of people standing around the bar made this brew pub feel like a Lincoln Park college bar. The food and prices quickly remind you this is not the case, but rather a somewhat sophisticated drink and eat option.   A couple of the beer prices are a dollar or two higher than they should be, but the taste isn't lacking. The rye pale ale and American IPA were the favorites. I'm sure they'll be adding more quantities and varieties, but for now it's 5 beers- 2 pale ales, 2 IPAs and a porter/brown ale.  The pork rinds were amazing, and the seasoning of sea salt pepper was spot on. The burger was cooked as requested, but really greasy- keep your napkin close by. They could use a couple simplistic options for sandwiches, entrees and appetizers...I'm not sure what all the kids running around were eating.  The decor is what really makes this place. Not surprising, the detail and craftsmanship of the bar itself is remarkable...considering the owner's background.",0.9719,0.874,0.114,0.013,0.4799652777777778

And the menu is beyond compare for a 'brewery'. Had the fresh Pork Rinds which were really fresh and slightly salty. The the House Burger with some Liver Mousse on top. Wow, what a great smokey flavor, done exactly as I ordered it. The soft onion roll brought it all together perfectly. Definitely try this place but, get there early to get a seat fast.",0.9927,0.657,0.343,0.0,0.5892156862745097
2015-04-02,3.0,"I want this place to do well and succeed and they're off to a good start.  Only a small handful of their own beers (5 if not mistaken?), but I imagine that will grow.  Food was very good, clearly thoughtful effort in that dept.  Beautiful place aesthetically too. My issue:  Tap beers all in a tulip glass for a 13oz pour?  C'mon.  Only place I saw that written was on the chalkboard menu - granted it's a big old chalkboard menu, but you need to write that on the handheld beer menu.  I just A) want to get a better pour for the $6 standard craft price, and B) don't dig my beers in a tulip unless it's one of those 9-10% ABV jobs that requires a 10-12 oz pour - and is advertised as so!   I know this sounds petty, but as a guy who has frequent outings for craft beer, you gotta weigh this stuff when making your choice. Again, I like the place. I want it to succeed.  I'll support it.  But as a guy who supports it, I have some requests, and I've stated them here.",0.9922,0.753,0.236,0.011,0.5676923076923077
2015-04-02,5.0,"Breakroom exceeded my expectations. After waiting for almost a year for this place to open, I thought I would be a little disappointed because my expectations were so high. I knew the chef has a great reputation, and the craft brew community seems pretty enamored by the product these guys put out. But even though I went on Sunday before the place even officially opened, it seemed like it had been around for a while, as if they had already had the opportunity to fine tune the food and the service. It was that good right off the bat. When we entered, we were greeted warmly by two of the owners. And even though it was pretty crowded, we were then seated right away, and our waiter was very knowledgeable and incredibly friendly. In regards to the food, I had the chicken thighs with spent grain biscuits and gravy. Seriously... one of the best dishes I've had in a long time. The biscuits were fluffy and the chicken fell off the bone. My friend had the sausage pot and was equally impressed. As far as the beer goes, I had the Artis IPA and it had just the right amount of hoppiness. We also tried the porter and the Imperial IPA. They were all outstanding.  I still can't get over the high quality of everything at this place, especially since it hasn't even been open a week. The group behind Breakroom has clearly put a great deal of care and attention into every detail to ensure this  place is several steps above what you'll get at other brew pubs. I can't wait to taste all of the other beers and everything else on the menu. It took us a while to order because everything sounded so good and was different from what other places are doing.  I have to say this was a difficult review to write because I'm encouraging people to try it out, which means I may have trouble getting a table next time I visit, but these guys deserve the rave reviews. So go to Breakroom. They've set the bar high, and you'll be thrilled with the results!",0.9845,0.862,0.123,0.015,0.5703986710963456
2015-04-01,5.0,"Better than average pub food.  Best looking bar in town. Went on opening night, so I expected some hiccups in service and food but happily had a great meal.  It took so long to open this place I was concerned the owners might be in over their heads, but I'll be back.  I tried four of their beers (don't judge), no complaints.  The burger was surprisingly good - it's actually two patties, and with the toasted bun there's a nice crunchy texture to it.  I found this double patty, toasted bun structure held up well during consumption, as opposed to collapsing into a greasy mass like other pub burgers. Overall the atmosphere was great.  Music was interesting mix of 10 year old alternative hits and some newer stuff I wasn't familiar with.  Service was great, no feeling of being rushed despite taking up a big table.  Kid friendly but also a serious place for good food and drinks.",0.996,0.652,0.327,0.022,0.45381944444444433
2015-03-31,5.0,"I'm actually dreading writing this review. Not because it's a horrible review, or I'm being forced to write it.  But because I'm a selfish little beer drinker who wants to be able to saunter down the street and into Breakroom Brewery after it's opening tomorrow and not have to contend with scads of people. I had the pleasure of going to Breakroom Brewery this past weekend for its soft opening.    Excited with the prospect of checking out a new local spot, and armed with three friends and an insatiable thirst for good beer, we set off for the block and a half walk to the bar to see what was going on with the place we've been walking by for the past countless months on our way to the El. Stepping into Breakroom, you're a bit taken aback with the atmosphere.  It doesn't seem like a bar fit for Albany Park/Irving Park.  The high, spacious ceilings, ample natural light, long communal booths and rails, dark wood, grunge rock streaming out of speakers, and upbeat vibe seems more fitting for Wicker Park than it does Albany Park. Grabbing a seat in one of the plush and comfortable booths, we studied our surroundings.  In the bar area, you're able to look up into the second floor where patrons can sit on bar stools and chairs and overlook the happenings on the first floor or commune around old beer barrels.  You can look into the garage of the Heineman Bar Company, peer in on the brewing tanks, or even see the small kitchen where chef Dirk Flanigan cranks out the upscale bar food. In terms of the beer, while I'm not a big fan of IPAs and tend to shy away from anything too ""hoppy"", I found myself enjoying the Demure Charm, even if it did give me a bit of a hoppy aftertaste.  My other friends checked out the remaining beers and couldn't find fault with any of them.  They are all beer that my friends and I would ""drink again...gladly"".   In addition to their own beers, Breakroom serves beer from other breweries, all written above the bar on a chalkboard.  We didn't check out or sample any of the other beers being served from other breweries; however, there will be plenty of time for that. After finishing up a beer, I decided to check out the margarita.  Pretty standard, delicious stuff.  Fresh and light.  I also had their vodka/lime/ginger beer concoction that I could have easily drank 12 of.  I could especially see myself finishing off a bunch of those on one of those lazy Chicago summer days, perched on a patio.    After making good friends with a couple of servers, we were delightfully informed that Breakroom would be opening a patio in the future.   Excitement abound! We couldn't just stop into Breakroom without checking out Chef Flanigan's food.  If you're looking for a bar menu comprised of nachos, wings, and your standard bar-pretzel fare, you won't find that here.  Instead, Chef Flanigan has created a menu that pairs well with the beer that Breakroom serves.    Like the menu says, it's ""food for drinking"". I decided to try the Steak Tartare which was served to me in a sealed mason jar alongside two char-grilled pieces of bread.  Lifting off the lid of the mason jar caused a mouthwatering little plume of smoke to escape.  I dug into my tartare, delicately placing the smoked beef, capers and pickled vegetables on my bread, bit in and was transported into heaven.  The smoke or char on the bread isn't overwhelming to the tender flavor of the beef.  Rather, it all pairs and compliments each other nicely.    My friends each got the House Pickled Vegetables (served in a mason jar), Fish and Chips (delicate and flavorful batter, lightly golden without an overwhelming feeling of eating a plate of grease), and the burger with bacon and egg.   Nothing bad to report with those.  We will be coming back to try out the other food offered soon. Overall, I'm beyond excited to add Breakroom to my collection of bars I don't have to hail a cab to go to.  The fact that the servers are super friendly, service is wonderful, the food is good, and the drinks are fantastic helps in adding Breakroom to my list of places I'll be heading back to again and again.",0.9972,0.821,0.138,0.04,0.5144380423957888
2015-03-30,4.0,"My husband and I went to Breakroom on their official opening day, Saturday. Good choice of beers, but I would have liked to see more than one cider. The current one is RightBee which I'm not a fan of. The food was excellent. We had:  - Lamb scrumpets - OMG soooo good, with a tasty little korean ketchup,  - Scotch egg which was very good and actually a vegetarian scotch egg which is a win for you veggies out there who've never experienced the delights of a scotch egg - Pickled Vegetables - very good, but maybe a little overpriced but a perfect accompaniment to the Charcuterie  (a small suggestion Breakroom - a small portion of these should come as standard with the charcuterie board) - We also had the Charcuterie board. To call it a  Charcuterie board was a little misleading - it actually only had duck pate and chicken liver mousse on it- but nonetheless it was outstanding. Both the mousse and the pate had been smoked and the flavor was incredible. It was only served with two small slices of bread which wasn't sufficient so we had to ask for more (another tip Breakroom - more bread with the board!) We were sat near the kitchen pass so saw most of the dishes coming past and they all looked pretty good. Great fit-out, very cool place - converted warehouse with huge triple height ceiling and a nice mezzanine level where you can wait for a table.   The music was a little loud for my taste though. The overall experience was good, although there were some teething problems with the service and organization but that's to be expected this early on. Definitely coming back here and I'm excited to have such a place in the neighborhood. I hope it does well enough to last.",0.9971,0.737,0.228,0.036,0.5839716312056739
