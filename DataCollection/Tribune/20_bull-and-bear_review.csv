2017-01-11,5.0,"I'm going to tell you all a little story about Bull & Bear. It was a Friday night and I had a couple of friend's coming over, but I had not yet had dinner. I was hungry, and I wanted a burger. To be completely honest, whenever I'm hungry I want a burger.  I went and checked GrubHub for a place to order a good burger. That is when I found it; I found the Bull & Bear Kobe Burger. Delivery was great, came way under the expected time, but that's besides the point. I'm not hear to talk about the delivery, I'm here to talk about this damn burger.  Let me just say, I eat a lot of burgers. I've even gone as far as to consider them a potential food group. This burger was the best burger I've ever had in my life. The cheese had the perfect bite to cut the sweet flavor of the marmalade, the kobe beef was out of this world. The bun had that perfect squishiness, and the caramelized onions were blowing my mind. I'm not one to hype up food to my loved ones because I don't want to let them down, but I wouldn't shut up about this freaking burger.  That leads us to right now. I'm sitting in the library of my college campus with a friend telling them that TONIGHT is the night they try this burger. I come on Yelp to show them a picture, so they too can marvel in the majesty of this hamburger. However life has deceived me once again. As if starting another semester of my college education isn't rough enough, Bull & Bear has CLOSED it's doors. So here I am, CRYING in the school library about how upset I am. Maybe it's a combination from the stress I know is upon me this semester, but I really do blame a lot of it on Bull & Bear closing.  Can you file a law suit for emotional damages caused by a burger you'll never be able to taste again? If there are any lawyers in the house, let me know.",0.9599,0.774,0.135,0.091,0.586345598845599

The bears were playing on Monday night this week so it wasn't very crowded. I can definitely see this place getting a nice crowd for them as they had a lot of tvs and those tap tables in the back.  So with that being said, it was crowded as in there was a lot of people seated but not crowded enough that people were standings around, and our services was just soooo agonizing slow. The waitress was just MIA most of the meal.  I ordered the day trader which was decent, classic bacon egg and cheese, which they forgot to put bacon on mine....so idk how you forget that on a class BEC sandwich and than with the slow service it was either eat it or starve to death trying to find and get our waitress attention.  My friend order the truffle mac and cheese which i took a bite of and I will say was amazing, but i love truffle anything really.  Other than that the other items orders were the brunch burger, and the crab cake eggs benedict, both good, nothing amazing.

I was coming home from dinner with friends, and trying to hail a taxi when it started pouring rain (while I had like 5 shopping bags in my hand). Out popped a bouncer (I asked him his name and I think he said Ermani) who invited me in to avoid the rain. He asked me where I was trying to hail a cab to, and within seconds he was outside in the pouring rain hailing me a taxi. (No customers were coming in as it was pouring, so he wasn't neglecting his job). He waited until I was safely in the taxi (and held open the door for me) until he retreated back in. Maybe I'm a softy, but I was in tears because of what a nice gesture it was.  I am going to be supporting this business with my friends this weekend in thanks for Ermani's kindness.

WTH.  So my comrades and I were forced to find seats at the bar.  As a curvy woman I hate bar seats so I wasn't extremely comfortable in the bar chairs.  No tables ever opened up so at the bar we stayed.  The hostess didn't really seem to give a damn and just pointed around the room so she sucked. Other than that, this is a cool spot.  We had a great view of the TV screen and enjoyed the game.  I loved our bartender.  I forget her name (sorry) but she was perfect.  Attentive enough to give us what we needed, and backed off enough not to annoy us.  I wanted a red apple ale, they didn't have it but she suggested a cider beer that was even better.  I had about six all night.  We went for a couple of the drink specials and enjoyed it all.  The parm fries were great, not too salty. The wings were, wings, nothing special but very good.  We also had some nachos, and everything we ate was delicious.  So for drinks and food this place gets an A-.  Aside from the hostesses, service was on point.

I was there Friday, we ordered an appetizer, several cocktails and got our bill with a full price appetizer. We asked why the app. was full price when online it said there was special till 7 for half price and our waitress was quite rude and said it was only till 6, we showed her the numerous websites that said it went till 7 and asked about it since thrillist, metromix, Chicago eater, chicagoist, all have their logo and info listed as half priced apps till . She said she would ask and told us they would not honor the half price as we ordered after 6. We asked when we ordered, she checked and said she put our order in at 6:16, mind you she was waiting on several tables, it was a Friday, and did not go directly to put our order in 16 minutes after the special ended. So long story short, we were charged full price, despite their being numerous websites saying their special went till 7 and the waitress knowing she did not put our order in immediately over 16 minutes  .

I would 100% recommend getting those, and they're perfect for sharing as it's a pretty large plate. The wings may have been a little over fried - but that's a personal preference, sliders were great, and the sweet potato fries had a light sugary coating.  The food for the St. Patty's day was a little underwhelming. Rather than having an open buffet, they had servers roam throughout with little mini bites. I understand how this would prevent people from wasting too much food, but it was tricky to manage having a few beers and also hunting down food as people were getting rowdier and rowdier throughout the morning. I would have much preferred to have arrived, eat, then drink instead of trying to manage the eating and drinking together in a crowded room without seating.  Overall, Bull & Bear is a great place.

It came with what they called ""regular fries"" that I could have subbed out for sweet potato fries or another side from the menu. But I went with the reggo fries and let me tell ya - there was nothing regular about them. In a good way! They had who knows what kind of seasoning on them but they were de-lish. Almost too delish. I for sure ate way too many. But that's neither here, nor there. The burger itself was really good! It was the first time I've had fried green tomatoes on a burger which was a tasty fun touch. The smoked gouda and sweet mustard paired perfectly as well. However, it's not the ultimate best dining experience I've ever had (kind of missing a wow factor), and I really don't like dropping $16 on lunch, so I couldn't give Bull & Bear a solid 5 stars at this point.

I met up with some friends here on a Friday night. We were there for a group event in which there were $5 drink vouchers given out. Already starting out on the right foot! The place was packed beyond belief. The bar had a decent selection. I was surprised that they didn't carry Sierra Nevada, as that brand is pretty popular in most Chicago bars.

There we found giant oversized booths with drinks on tap at nearly every table. Our group had something like bottle service with Absolut and the servers were pretty on top of things.

The bathrooms were decent too. Nothing to write home about, but they were clean. I guess what I really disliked was the fact that there was not much room to dance. But then again, this isn't a dance club. However, the music was SO loud, I thought I was in a nightclub for sure. Even if it were one though, I doubt I'd be dancing to Snoop Dogg or OPP, which they were playing a lot of. The DJ's music selections ranged from 1989-2002. Not even kidding. The service was pretty decent enough, considering the fact that the place was jam packed. Prices are pretty average too, which is good. Nothing crazy there. I would definitely come back.

It came with thick, crispy cuts of bacon and just the right amount of blue cheese. So worth the $7! The staff is fast and friendly and there are a decent amount of tvs around so that everyone has a pretty good view. We sat at a large U-shaped booth. The spread out space combined with the pretty loud background music makes it difficult to have a conversation with anyone at your table unless they're next to you, but that's fine if you're really mostly there to watch a game.

The reason I gave it 4 stars was for the PB&J Stuffed french toast ($11) - I am not a fan of french toast or jam but this was really good!! The flavors just blended really well. My friends got the mimosa ($5) but it's a big mini bucket which probably equals like 3 regular mimosa glasses.  It's a sports bar so I think a lot of people come here to watch games and drink.

Big group of us showed up (about 12 people I believe) and the workers had no idea what this discount was we were speaking of because the tickets they sold for NYE were sold through a third party company.

Everything we ate had a home cooked feel to it, and the chefs among us all were saying ""I can't wait to make this for my friends."" To start we had breakfast nachos and a savory pop tart; in both cases the standard taste of sausage egg and cheese benefitting from delivery mechanisms that let them pop. The Tart is a must - share it with the table.  Following that we shared four plates: Short Rib eggs Benedict were a stellar showcase of shredded beef done right. I'd prefer a smokier BBQ flavor to go along with the rich hollandaise, but hey, there's Tabasco for a kick.  Chorizo quesadilla Benedict was the weakest offering of the morning. Just two flavors that didn't really mesh - the hollandaise was much too potent for the cheese and mildly spiced sausage.  Sausage and egg with home made cheese biscuits were a crowd pleaser. A breakfast sandwich for the storybooks, a case study in good bread making a meal. There's no good sandwich without good bread, and these biscuits were wonderful.  Lastly and most importantly was the PB&J stuffed French toast.

Huge mistake. I'm allergic to gluten but saw immediately that their menu catered well to a gluten-free diet. First, I ordered a turkey sandwich on a rice wrap (which I was happy to see that they had). The meal typically comes with fries, but since their fries are made in a shares fryer (even though they claim that they're gf), I asked the waitress what I could substitute. She gave me a few options, and I picked the asparagus. When my sandwich arrived, I took a bite, and it was ridiculously spicy, which I couldn't understand for a plain old turkey sandwich. I asked the waitress if this was normal, and she acted perplexed. She went to ask the chef and returned saying it was due to the rub that was already on the turkey. Why this wasn't noted on the menu, why she didn't warn me of it when I ordered, or why she didn't even know that it was spicy (and not even a mild spice) was beyond me. She offered to get me another dish, which was in line with restaurant best practices and which I appreciated. The dish I ordered still didn't taste good, but I chalked that up to personal preference. When we got the bill, the first meal was removed, but we were charged $8 for the asparagus. Yes, I ate it, but I also wasn't told when ordering that it would cost any extra. The waitress made me think that it was an exact substitution since I physically couldn't eat the fries. Now, $8 isn't a ton of money, but in this situation, it just seemed absurd. I left miffed and won't be spreading any good word about the food or service here.",0.9228,0.845,0.095,0.061,0.4658289241622575

The restaurant itself is large, open, and airy with lots of dark wood - reminds me of the industrial chic look of Au Cheval.  Overall, it's a darker atmosphere but there is still plenty of natural light - I'm assuming it's decorated with the male clientele in mind.  This place has at least a dozen TVs throughout the bar and general dining area.  As far as I could tell, they were all HD flat screens. I've only been here on the weekends for brunch but I've ordered both breakfast and lunch items.  Everything has been at least good with many of the items being REALLY good.  I would highly recommend the kobe burger, parmesan truffle fries, and truffle mac & cheese - but not all in one meal!  The truffle mac & cheese is so rich and cheesy that you definitely need to share it with at least one other person.  Another option to consider: the seasonal ""pop tarts"" - They are always serving one sweet and one savory option (each order comes with 2, mix and match if you please).  They change often and every time we've had them, they've been outstanding.  They are not hard like traditional grocery store pop tarts - instead they have a flaky croissant/phyllo dough exterior. The only thing that irks me about this place is that the bathroom is downstairs (oh well) and one time the service was extremely slow when it was not busy at all.  Overall, I would give it 4.5 stars but my boyfriend loves it so much that I pushed it up to a 5.",0.9932,0.836,0.155,0.009,0.5106637806637806

For lunch, for dinner, for apps and drinks, to watch the game, and for private events.  1 Star - Food 1 Star - Service 3 Stars - Environment, Location 1.5 Stars - Food: The Junk Bond salad was 60% iceberg lettuce, 20% cabbage, and 20% romaine. Who puts cabbage in the mixed greens? The egg whites were so finely chopped that my friend, a blue cheese hater, could not pick out the blue cheese from her salad. The salad was garnished with a max of six cherry tomatoes (sliced in half) and the avocados were missing from both of our salads. The big bonus? My salad included one lonely black bean, which made up for the lack of protein I received from the small portion of chicken that was included in the salad. The food gets the extra half star for satisfying late night cravings, and that's it.  1 Star - Service: While Grub Hub is a nice service, delivery does not work for lunch hour at Bull & Bear. I waited nearly two hours for my food form the start of my order placement. TWO HOURS! As for dining in, I've always had to wait for my check.  3 Stars - Environment, Location This place works because alcohol is served and you can watch the game here. It also is in a good location.

I think the only thing that's still edible on this menu are the nachos and the hummus. The pepper steak with the szechwan glaze is sweet, sweet sweet! When I ordered it, I specifically asked the server whether it's sweet and she tried to school me on what szechwan is.  ""No, szechwan is a Chinese sauce and means it's spicy, it is not sweet."" Thanks for the education on my own culture, ditzy white girl.  But seriously, it's sweet. It does have some heat. But it's sweet. Their burger is HUGE but just not satisfying. Also by the time it came, I had to run back to the office for a meeting, so I asked them to put it in a to-go container for me...that took 20 minutes.  The melts are gross. Even the salads are somehow just wrong.  Last time I ordered the Southwest Salad with avocado and dressing on the side, it came with dressing in the salad and no avocado.  Maybe it means the food is bad, it definitely means the servers are idiots here.  They can't even bring out beers in under 10 minutes.

I actually ended up forgetting what I ordered, because a plate landed in front of me and I started eating the melt... and then a small plate of chicken was brought out right as I finished one half of my melt. Now, remember, I ordered turkey. But at that point, I wasn't really about to complain, since they agreed to comp my meal. The chicken was well seasoned but a bit dry. I don't think the goat cheese would have helped with that.

That same night someone mistook my coat for there's and took it. A week later we called up there and talked to Ben. He said someone had just returned my coat and apologized for the mishap.

Anyway, political rant aside, they be crowded in here.  And loud.  I'm a little hoarse today actually.  All the tables in the bar area are high tops, but they have booths and a more restaurant-y feel in the back.  I walked past one of the big booths and I'm 95% sure that I saw beer taps built into the table.  Is that for real??  Do they work??  That's nuts.  I love that idea.  I had a few vodka tonics while hanging out in the bar, and they were fairly watered down.  I know this because I had two, then later a gin and tonic, and was not even buzzed.  Problemo.   My friend and I were starving, so we went outside on the patio.  Despite Yelp saying this place is ""wheelchair accessible,"" only the front bar area and patio technically are.  Also the entire bar is high tops, so she can't eat there.  Or go to the bathroom.  So I'd take issue with their ""accessible"" cred.  Fortunately it was a warm night and not yet raining, and there were actually open tables outside, so we could eat.  They have a small-ish patio area that gives a nice view of the Merchandise Mart all lit up at night.  We started with calamari, which was actually pretty good.  The breading was super light and delicately crispy, and came with two sauces.  The creamy aioli-like one was my favorite.  I'm starving and wish I had some of that now...  Anyway then we split the grilled chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado, and swiss cheese.  And sweet potato fries.  The fries were of the ""sweet"" persuasion, with a light cinnamon and sugar dusting.  Still tasted good in ketchup.  The sandwich was pretty good, nothing special, no big flavors, but basically of good quality and exactly what you'd expect.  They split the sandwich in half and put it on two plates for us, which was really nice.   Bathrooms are down some cavernous stairs, and somebody is not keeping an eye on the toilet paper situation because two stalls were out.  Generally though, service was friendly if not super-attentive.   Meh.  I'll give it three stars because the food was pretty tasty, but they need to change the channel and put more G or V in their G&Ts/V&Ts.  I'd willingly come back if somebody else wanted to go, but wouldn't go out of my way!",0.9973,0.795,0.171,0.034,0.5137327188940093

The tables had reserved signs on almost every table. We were confined to a corner of the mid section bar. We were hungry and did not have enough space to eat in the small area we had. Sad to say, the four hours we were there none of those empty tables were ever occupied. We more than likely would have spent good money on food if had we had enough space to eat. 2nd experience: Not so bad as me and my buddy were able to get a couple of beers on a warm, rainy saturday afternoon. Decent selection of bottled beer. The guy behind the bar serving us was pretty cool. 3rd experience: Came on a Friday evening and the music was so loud that you had to scream @ the person next to you. Not an exaggeration. Service was a little up in the air as the girls behind the bar was so engulfed with their convo that they sometimes didn't realize we were trying to order another drink.

2013-08-21,3.0,"This review is specifically for trivia nights. I've been here twice now, both nights for trivia. I was here yesterday (8/20/13) for a Harry Potter trivia night. My friends and I were some of the first to RSVP to the Facebook event, and we immediately went to their website reservation system specifically for trivia. Showed up...they don't have our reservation. We were told the best way was to email them, since their online system is unreliable. It didn't say anything online about a confirmation email, so we had no idea that our table wasn't saved, so we were just out of luck since they were totally booked up.The event coordinator apologized and gave us a gift card and told us we could still stand and play. Then she left for the night. So we kind of stood around awkwardly for 40 minutes, moving out of the way, hoping a table would no-show, which to our luck, they did. So it ended up working out, and hostesses were even able to accommodate us to stay for the 8:30 game as well. So well done on them for handling the situation. They had themed cocktails and bites, which we took advantage of. Made for a more magical experience :) The trivia company, Geeks Who Drink, had a great Trivia Master and definitely chose some stumpers. My only suggestion would be to tally up the scores and announce the teams scores at some point during the competition, rather than just announcing winners at the end. I give Bull & Bear three stars because the hostessing staff and servers made up for the event coordinator's error.",0.9847,0.817,0.145,0.038,0.6470238095238096

2013-07-20,2.0,"I really have mixed feelings about this place. I'd come back for a bite to eat but I doubt I'll ever come back at night . After 5 or so visits, these are my thoughts: Their patio is dog friendly and they were super nice to my dog.  They brought him a water bowl and fed him a treat or two after asking if it was alright.  Really liked this, and one of the main reasons I was able to give B & B 2 stars.  I must say it got a little creepy that one of the bus boys, after seeing my dog, was inspired to tell us how he's taking loans out and working overtime to pay for his dog's surgery.  While he was sincere I would do the same if presented with the same situation, I went there for a meal not to hear some random dude's life story.   Like a lot of people said, their food is surprisingly good.  The appetizer portions were pretty large and all of our meals were delicious.  Their beer menu satisfied me, and the sangria was pretty good.  That is all I can say that is good about this establishment.  If you're looking for a dog friendly place to grab an above-average meal on a nice day, you will enjoy bull and bear.  Prices werent too crazy either.  Definitely average for the neighborhood. Do not under any circumstance come to Bull and Bear on a weekend night looking to have fun. Every experience Ive had here at night has left me unsatisfied. This place is just not fun.  A ton of dudes, minimal girls. While I was never going there on the hunt, I think the girl-guy ratio is very telling of a bar.  This is probably the youngest crowd you will see in River North.  You could tell there were a few groups of underaged kids there every time I went.  Someone who isnt me and all of his friends used to go here as 18/19 year olds with horrible fake ids.  The guys checking ids are a joke. I really didnt come to river north to hang out with people as old as my younger brother.  I will say that for some reason the patrons to this establishment have always been incredibly nice and that is something I cant say about all river north bars.  Its a long and thin layout so youre bound to bump into a couple people. Last night about 6 times the people I bumped into (my fault) turned to me and said sorry!  Dont buy into the wristband deal, youll be lucky to get your moneys worth.  The wait at the bar can be dreadful as it becomes a mosh of drunks pushing and jockeying their way through to get in front of the people that have been patiently waiting.  Bull and Bear really needs to get with the times though with their payment systems.  There are two bars.  After waiting in line at one of the bars and ordering a round of shots, I was informed that I couldnt pay for them with my tab that was opened at the other bar.  Do you not have a computer system that interacts with both bars?  I reiterate, dont buy into the wristband deal.  The drinks are alright but Ive never seen a drink with that much ice in it before.  Clearly, that is their policy for those that buy the wristband. They have to make money somehow and this is the way they choose. I was able to get 2 drinks last night in the hour I was there and then I was kicked out by a busboy that clearly was on a power trip. I will be the first one to admit what I did wasnt ""right"" per-se, but the actions did not warrant kicking me out.  As I mentioned the drinks are incredibly full of ice and its to the point where I couldnt even drink my beverage.  With no empty glasses near me, I  gingerly took a handful of ice out of my cup and set it on a table in the corner.  Again to make clear, what I did was wrong.  Next thing I know, a busboy aggressively grabbed me and informed me I was kicked out. Not enjoying the night anyways, I shrugged, said alright and began to walk towards the exit.  Then the busboy proceeded to put his hand up against my back and push me out.  Let me remind you I was already on my way out. I went to another bar alone since all of my friends purchased wristbands there and didnt want to leave.  I had way more fun alone than at bull and bear.   Come for the food and patio.  Stay far away at night time.",0.9988,0.783,0.169,0.049,0.4962215320910972
2013-07-17,3.0,"For an all American bar, Bull & Bear differentiates itself with a better than average menu and surprisingly decent food.  I've been there on weekend nights just for drinks and the place gets packed, loud, and can be quite a bit of fun.  I went by yesterday evening for the Game of Thrones trivia night (and was happy to see that there are people WAY more geeky than I thought I was since we came in 14th place). The table tap booths are pretty cool, and if you've never sat at a table tap then I recommend it.  There's nothing quite like being able to pour your own beer every time you need a refill and just pay by the ounce.  Matilda as a table tap might get you into some trouble, but how cool is that? We ordered a variety of appetizers: the mediterranean (basically hummus, vegetables, and pita), the vegetable quesadillas, the special GOT Dragon Fire Wings (which was really just a spicy peanut sauce), and the truffle mac n cheese.  I think their prices are slightly higher than what they should be for what you get, but I'd rather pay a couple extra bucks and enjoy the items than pay less and suffer through mediocre food.  The hummus was surprisingly fresh and tasty.  The truffle mac n cheese was very good as well as the vegetable quesadillas.  I didn't try the wings but they looked good and the sauce was great.  Nothing was oily or greasy.   This is not the type of place you come if you're looking for a delicious meal or a culinary experience, and they don't try to advertise themselves that way.  It's a great bar to come to if you're looking for a fun and unpretentious atmosphere, come-as-you-are dress code, good beer selection on tap, and actual enjoyable bar food that doesn't make you feel like you just blocked an artery.

First, the bathroom wasn't as clean as I'd prefer/expect (especially for 11:30am on a weekday).  I didn't mind that it was downstairs, but I definitely felt like the maintenance is an afterthought.

Supposedly there is a photo booth in the place somewhere, but I never saw it, only learned of it when I checked in on foursquare & received a Photogenic badge for checking into a third place that has a photo booth. Washrooms are downstairs, which is very inconvenient for us girls wearing high heels.  Music is pretty loud to the point that you have to basically yell if you want someone to hear you.  One cool thing I liked was their hanging lights. (I'm big on light fixtures.) They strung a bunch of lightbulbs together to create a modern chandelier.  Also, this was one of the first, if not the first, place I had heard of to have table taps.

I didn't even get to go inside! The place states they have valet when actually, they don't. I waited for 10 minutes before calling the hostess - she said, 'oh he might be parking a car, if you keep waiting, with your blinkers on, he'll eventually see you.' OK... So I wait another 5 minutes before driving off in hopes of finding street parking. So of course, no street parking and I return hoping to find the valet guy. He's still nowhere to be found. I call the hostess again and ask her, are you sure you have valet? She tells me, 'yes we do, hold on, let me come out and look'- I see a girl come out of the restaurant, look around, then go back. Then she tells me, 'hmmm, I don't know where he is, sorry, maybe you can park in the garage?' Ummm... 25 minutes of waiting for the valet? What kind of a bar is this?

Kind of disappointing because the ingredients they used were fresh and tasted good, but it was too much of a hassle to have to take toppings off of the top chips and spread them to the bare chips on the bottom.

2012-08-26,4.0,"***BRUNCH REVIEW ONLY*** You're going to have to excuse me, as I'm a little taken aback by the brunch served here.  I agreed to go, but went with the mindset stereotyping B&B as just another douchy River North location that would probably offer bottomless mimosas, hot waitresses, and ""meh"" food.   The first two were true; there are bottomless mimosa's and bloodies for $20, and the servers are, in fact, quite attractive.  But the third item. Holy crap, batman, I was absolutely blown away by the grub. Homemade pop-tarts were the first to come out, one sweet, one savory, changed every weekend.  We happened to have peanut butter and blueberry in the sweet, and smoked turkey, cheeses and....something in the other. The turkey was amazing, very homemade feeling, as if the chefs mother made it for you. The blueberry/PB combo was also tasty, although not as great, as I felt the pb overpowered and came on a bit strong.  MUCH LIKE THE MALE CLIENTAL THE NIGHT BEFORE, AMIRIGHT?!?! Sorry, sorry.  Moving on.  Second were breakfast tacos on your choice of corn or flour, leading to another of those Billy Madison-esque ""shampoo is better, no conditioner is"" debates between girlfriend and I ( youtube.com/watch?v=N_Gj… ).  Either way, tasty. Although could use a crunch element, and I know that makes me sound like a fool.  Oh, also Benedict, also featuring smoked turkey, asparagus, and tasty.  All tasty. Super tasty. Last, but best, was the belgian waffle. This isn't some namby-pamby Motel-6 make your own waffle by using the soda-type waffle batter dispenser. This is some dense, caramelized sugar bits and white chocolate and.  Look, I don't order waffles, as I generally DON'T do sweet, but this is in a class of it's own.  I could make some outrageous statement about sleeping with the chef to have one every morning, but I hate those people, and I couldn't think of a funny one. Coffee - surprisingly good. Service - came with a smile, but spend a bit more time reading the menu, and knowing whats on it. Facilities - Very clean. Booths - those backs were at a perfect 90 degree angle, that doesn't work for relaxing after gorging. TV's - a Plenty. Cocktail menu - uninspired.",0.9935,0.739,0.181,0.08,0.5992460317460317

In regards to their food, I would definitely say get a bunch of their appetizers because they are slamming. The calamari is unexpectedly phenomenal, so make sure you get that for sure and use the orange dipping sauce. Also make sure you order the hot wings. These things are freaking good and freaking hot. I mean there are literally jalapenos on the wings. I heard the burgers are slamming as well, so make sure to jump on that. The nightlife is very trendy and kinda shaky for my liking. The servers are amazing, but I truly think all of the clowns in Chicago that live in the loop come here for drinks before they go to Underground. If you're going with a group of people, make reservations for a table with a table top thingy (it dispenses alcohol at your table). I would stay away from this spot for late night drinking, but if you are coming to check out a game, B&B is a decent spot.",0.9472,0.845,0.13,0.025,0.7104861111111112

I worked with the event coordinator to set it up and specifically told her, I wanted to reserve two tables without a package and people would be coming in randomly throughout the night. There would be a total of 40 or so people. She was fine with this and informed be that there could only be one tab per table, which I was ok with.  Come the night of my birthday party, I walk in and I was told my entire party had to be there to be seated. I explained my situation and the hostess told me if I could get 5 people, we could be seated. So my boyfriend and I opened up a tab at the bar. Finally 3 other friends came and we could be seated but THEN were told, they couldn't hold the second table until 5 more people came which was a pain because I had clearly stated a head of time what I wanted.  Then, as the waitress came over, I explained that we were all ok with paying on 1 tab per table but she stated that people were paying in cash which was fine. Come to find out, she was upcharging all of my guests $1 per drink!!! So I sent people to the bar, or people started to not tip.  Lastly, not only did the place get too crowded, but as I went to close my tab at the bar at the end of the night, I waited patiently by the bar until the bar tender came up to me, told her I needed to close my tab. She looked at me and then started to help someone else. I thoguht she was going to help the next person and then get my credit card but instead I had to wait while she continued to help 15 + other people. I then had to get the hostess to help me close my tab, and the bartender passed her up too!!

Not gonna lie, it was a good burger, good bun, and well thought out combination of flavors, but it's a disappointment to not enjoy high quality beef like kobe at rare instead of the medium well they served it.  I'd likely come back with a group to hang out, as it seems like a potentially fun place with decent food.",0.9842,0.77,0.192,0.038,0.5865550595238095

Obviously you're not going to order a linguini or steak dinner; but as with most bars, the appetizers are where it's at, and they definitely suffice here at B&B. The DJ is usually playing some good music, a little mainstream, a little old school here and there, it works for me anyway. But the big thing about Bull & Bear is when there are Chicago sports playing. During football season you can find this place in a rage on Sunday's. During basketball season, if you can't make it to the Madhouse on Madison, UC, or anywhere near there, this is where you'd wanna' be. Surrounded by other avid Chicago fans in a great location. Overall, I like it, for smaller groups anyway. If you're looking for somewhere to go with upwards of 10+ people, you probably don't want to pack into here. But otherwise, a nice place to checkout.",0.9914,0.794,0.153,0.053,0.5315245478036176

My boyfriends Cesar had anchovies in the dressing, but he liked it.

2011-04-24,2.0,"Several weeks ago, weak from an inappropriate amount of drinking (for a woman of my distinguished years) My dear friend Auntie Fab called and suggested we meet for brunch at Meile. ( i have no idea what they serve there but judging from the lines on the weekend it might be crack). Of course there was a 60 minute wait so we debated and decided to give Bull&Bear a shot. She warned me up front that it is a ""guy place"" bleary eyed and makeup free I was not deterred and into the dark leathery woody halls of B& B we went. at 11:am it was empty... EMPTY so we crawled up into a roomy cigarette burned booth and set about ordering. I chose a Benedict with Green fried tomatoes, Serrano ham and a chipolte hollandaise, coffee, water and a mimosa ( you know what they say about falling off the horse)  *stop* let me add I am fussy about eggs, they have to have hard cooked white and runny yolks, an almost impossible feat I admit. When the dish arrived it was cold and the eggs were wet and mucous like. So I sent it back and what arrived ten minutes later was a magical dish, savory , spicy , salty , fatty , fresh and so good I joined the clean plate club for the first time in months, I even enjoyed the crispy hash brown / home fries.  I have been thinking about that dish ever since.  So this morning ( its Easter)  on my daily amble with Cash Money Svenson ( best dog in Chicago) I noticed B &B was open.  A quick check showed that Auntie Fab was also available so back we went.  Ugh  While waiting for AF - I ordered the Pop Tarts ( knowing they would take 15 minutes to arrive. By the time AF arrived we were both starving. Then here came the terrible service. REALLY terrible, TERRIBLE service from a very young, very attractive girl. Let me tell you the staff was having a ball - chatting laughing, flirting, me and Auntie Fab, jonesing for coffee and a Bloody Mary , not so much. We finally had a chance to order and requested the same Benedict that I had enjoyed the prior visit. The pop tarts came in a toaster, cute - but almost ridiculous to get out of the toaster. No complaints though, both the savory and the sweet were delicious. But when the Benedict came the crushing blow of disappointment was delivered. Eggs properly cooked, but cold, the ham was chewy , the chipolte sauce hovering on he verge of separating,  NO HASH BROWNS or Home fries whatever they are and our ooh so precious waitress - perkily unavailable.  I am starting to understand why real critics visit a restaurant more than once. Had I reviewed after the last visit B&B would have gotten a solid 3 1/2. Only the Pop Tarts kept them in the 2 zone today.   Maybe next time we will just stand in line at Miele?",0.9723,0.743,0.146,0.11,0.525216049382716

I went for a friends birthday party (hes white - i'm not), and they refused to let me and my friends in with immediate access and they made us wait in line, they said that we couldn't go in because the reservation was 830 and it was only good for two hours. Listen buddy, I know the look in your eye, I know your lying to me. So whatever we go to the end of the line and proceed to call our friend, who makes things happen after much persistence and then they only allow three of us inside, not even all of us so I guess they are limiting the number of brown people they are letting in. Whatever. I'm upset but not really PO'd.  Once we got in, I didn't understand why I even wanted to be there. I felt like cattle, that was stuck in one spot, not able to move in any direction. Getting jabbed every 5 seconds. Now I understand why they weren't letting minorities in...NOT.  Now this is what PISSED. ME. OFF.

Why the need to be so pretentious? 3) Don't be jealous of my year round tan & 4) I don't understand why they still let people in after capacity, they shouldn't have just been turning people they didn't like due to skin color away, they should have stopped when they reach capacity. The cops should know both about this discrimination, and the fact that they were drastically over capacity.

I've read the reviews on here about Bull & Bear and thought it might be a good place for us to catch up and enjoy lunch. I heard about the restaurant opening from Urban Daddy.  I forwarded the website menu link to her earlier in the week. She said her mouth was watering just looking at the menu.   We decided to go today and we wanted to beat a lunch rush, so we decided to meet at 11:15. Unfortunately, it was raining and the doors were locked because we forgot to check what time they opened for lunch. Not a problem it was only drizzling, so we headed to a dry spot and started catching up while we were waiting. I haven't seen her in over 2 years. Once they were open for lunch, we walked in and were greeted in a friendly manner right away and asked where we'd like to sit.  I've just read reviews from people on here, so I said the back. Also, I didn't want to sit by the door, since it was a little chilly out.  The back seating in the restaurant is not bad, since it was lunch, but can see how this can be a super crowded place to eat when they are busy. The hostess took us to our table and gave us the menu and our silverware.  Right away, our server Amy came to introduce herself, offer us beverages and ask what kind of water we wanted (?).  My friend and I were still catching up and every time Amy came back to take our order, we weren't ready.  Can you believe it?! I can't remember how much time passed, but we were finally ready to order and along comes Amy, at just the right time ;) Since my gift certificate from Chicagoland Savers was worth $50, Amy was nice enough to let me know that we could order something else so we don't waste any money.  We placed our order and then continued catching up even more. I ordered the Junk Bond salad (no tomato) and my friend ordered the Bull & Bear Burger.  Since we had a few extra $ to spend, I ordered the sweet potato fries. Yum!  They were good without any sauce. My salad was good and the portion size was just right. My friend said the burger was good and she really enjoyed the truffle fries. Service was good and the staff this afternoon were nice and even had smiles.  I'm not sure if it's the crew or the patrons, but we didn't have a bad experience like others on Yelp.  They even said thank you as we left and hour and a half later!!!  I might want to buy another one of those certificates.  (UPDATE: I just checked the Chicagoland Savers site and the coupons are SOLD OUT!!)  I'll keep my eye out and if they offer it again, I'll definitely grab one.

The mussels have too much garlic and were not fresh either of the 2 times I had them. After trying most things on the menu, I will say the steak tacos and calamari were good and I would eat them again.  But why go to a place filled with pretentious people to order a dish that anyone can make?

Speaking of the food, I got some kind of specialty burger and fries.  My companion got a fancy sandwich.  Everything was way overly greasy and salty...and I like greasy salty foods!  But this was a week's sodium intake and it wasn't just one thing, it was everything.

Really? Your entire job is JUST to seat people, and you don't know when you can do that? They offered us the bar, but that was cramped and loud as fuck so we said no. So they sat us outside (even though it looked like it might rain) in the damn wind tunnel of downtown. Now, the waitress was nice, I will give her that. And she braved the chill to get our orders and make sure we were okay. We ordered 5 buffalo wings, 5 asian wings, the sausage fest (lol), and the truffle fries. Once the food arrived, we were super pumped - not only because we were hungry, but we were hoping the hot food would warm us up. But of course, not 10 minutes into eating, it started to rain. We asked to go inside and the waitress said she wasn't sure we could. Wait. What? We were just told we could sit at the bar, and now it is THAT packed? She ended up seating us at a private table on the second level that was reserved for 7:15. It was 6:30. So, pretty much, we could have been sitting at the table the ENTIRE TIME. Damn. Since the waitress apparently only did outdoor seating, she asked us to order the rest of what we wanted so she could close our check. We ordered the s'mores  but they were out - wtf? how do you run out of S'MORES?? It has THREE INGREDIENTS.  So we ended up with another round of drinks and the cinnamon sugar doughnut holes. I gave her my groupon and she was off. The food was great. The medium wings were spicy, the asian wings had a great sauce, the fries were fucking AWESOME, and the sausage (lol) was great. Well...the lobster sausage was kind of gross. But the other two were tasty. Almost done with our food, she returned saying the Groupon pretty much made us even. Rad, I thought, waiting for her to return with the usual tax and tip fees. We got our doughnut thingies, which were the worst food served of the meal - bland fried hollow balls of dough. Avoid them. We pushed them to one side and started working on our drinks. And waited for them to bring our check and clear the table, since they had a reservation. We waited. And waited. After 40 minutes (WAY past the supposed ""reservation"" of the table), we threw down some cash for tip and headed out. I guess we were forgotten at our supposed ""high priority reservation"" seating.

Nachos were actually tasty and my friends said the Mac and Cheese is delicious.  After midnight (damn i stayed out to late last nite) the waiters walk around with platters full of finger food and every body gets to help themselves (i hope every one washed their hands. gross).

I wandered over since they were doing a Rank Your Frank (Hot Dogs, that is!) Week. As soon as I saw that I would be able to get 5 hot dogs for $9, my lunch plans were finalized. I got there intentionally after 1 pm, and things were fairly busy. Expect a little wait depending on the size of your party, your time of arrival, and insistence to lunch al fresco. Otherwise, the staff seemed relatively friendly. How was the hot dog flight, you wonder? Not so bad. Of the 5, two of them probably shouldn't return as an actual menu item. I could see the other 3 getting decent votes.",0.8765,0.885,0.09,0.025,0.5664565826330531

Sadly, I was immediately put off by the server's coordinated outfits (Sloppy and baggy looking plaid pajama pants, tight t-shirts, and orange skin.) Very sorowhore-chic, which some people might dig, but certainly not me.  The food was mediocre. I ordered a turkey burger which was dry, crumbly and very bland. I have become a believer in the bird after having a very succulent and tasty turkey burger at Rockit Bar and Grill but unfortunately I was very let down with the turkey burger at Bull & Bear. I ended the meal with an order of the homemade donuts, which were the best part of the meal, but probably won't be enough to warrant a return from me.

We sat outside at a table in the sun, and their staff was really quick to get an umbrella on request, which was good as we would have melted away in a matter of minutes otherwise, and that would have made it difficult to submit a full Yelp review. Inside, this place was super loud and really packed. If you are into that, maybe sit inside. If you are not, I imagine don't go here in the winter when there is no choice. There was a World Cup game going on, which is the one where people from different countries run around for an hour and a half or so playing tag in rainbow colored shorts. Understandably, people inside were intense about it. Best part of the meal: We saw a guy walk out of the bar, throw his hat on the sidewalk in anger, stand there for 2 minutes, say nothing, pick his hat back up, and walk back in. +10 YelpPoints for this entertaining display. Food was really good, the burgers were awesome. Drinks a little expensive. Convenient to the merchandise mart and downtown area. That place has so many windows! Next time I will ask their staff if they know how many, and if they can answer first try, I will add another star.

We were seated outside, which was just fine because we had a lot to talk about and inside was little bit loud from the Happy Hour crowd. We were seated quickly (even at 6:45) and the hostess was friendly, as was our server. We had to wait for our third friend ""C"" to arrive for about 15 minutes, but while we were waiting the busboy brought water, the server greeted us and brought menus, and we got our drinks (wine for me, a raspberry mojito for my friend ""M""). My wine was moderately priced at $8, and ""M"" liked her drink, which was HUGE for a mojito ($11), served in a pint glass! When our third arrived, the server reappeared almost instantly and got her drink order, and a second round me (""M"" was still working on her giant mojito). For dinner ""C"" and I both ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, and she got the sweet potato fries while I stuck to the regular kind. ""M"" got the quesadilla bites and a side of truffle fries. The grilled chicken sounds great on the menu, with avacado, bacon and smoky aioli on an onion roll, but I found it kind of bland and on the dry side. ""C""s sweet potato fries came dusted with sugar, which she said she liked. ""M"" chose the best out of the three of us...her quesadillas were cheesy with a really tasty salsa verde on top, and homemade guacamole on the side. Her truffle fries were *awesome*, and probably the best thing on the table. All in all, we had a nice, al fresco, casual dinner with decent upscale bar food, good service, and slightly pricey drinks.

You *cannot* move in here on a Saturday night.  I feel like they make enough on weak drinks to possibly cut down the number of people they let through the door.  And the clientele was fairly obnoxious overall.  There were girls in a booth two over who were standing on their booth having conversations, because no one would be able to see them/be in awe of them if they fraternized with the rest of us groundlings.  In my two passes through the bar there were quite a few mid life crises in full effect.  You would think that by your late 30s/early 40s you would learn how to check a girl out without being so obvious and skeezy.  I don't think anyone said excuse me once or even tapped me on the shoulder/back before smashing me up against someone or something.

I've been to Bull & Bear before, but only to the bar area. This table area was new. Here's how it works: Each table has two beer taps, one Bud Light and one something else. Ours was Bud Light and Stella. Some of the other tables had different kinds of Goose Island beers. The waitress gets you glasses and starts the meter and then you are free to help yourself to all the beer you want. There's a computer with a screen that displays how many ounces of each beer that you have poured. It's a pretty cool concept. Dangerous. We had so many people we were kind of all mingling in front of the table and the table was serving as our own private bar. I can imagine people sitting at the table and just drinking glass after glass without even the delay of wait staff going to get your drinks. Also, we wondered how many people had gotten totally bombed and put their mouths under the taps! I'm sure there's the obvious reason for this, but just seeing how many ounces you've poured without a dollar amount attached is pretty useless. 72 ounces?

I'm glad I waited almost 24 hours to write this because it would have been even more harsh than it's about to get up in here... We were invited here for a KU/Texas Alumni Association Happy Hour. ""Specials"" included half price wings and quesadillas (still $5.50 for the quesadilla - are you kidding me?), $5 bloody marys (isn't that what they usually cost?), and $3 bud light (woop dee freakin' doo, it's bud light, it should cost $1). So here we are at this overpriced, overcrowded bar filled with a f*ck ton more people than just our alumni event. A group of 8 of us squeezed into a booth and ordered a round of drinks after our server, Sarah S., took over 10 minutes just to find out what the specials were for our event (and to find out what time our event officially ""started"" even though we told her it started at 6 she didn't seem to believe us). We order the drinks, and I get this craptastic blood mary. A lime and a lemon wedge for garnish? Get with it folks, where's my pickle spear? A prosciutto slice? An olive? Nothing.  We order 5 quesadillas, 1 order of wings, and a chili. The food came out and my chicken quesadilla was delicious though I would have NEVER paid the full $11 for it. However, even though we ordered 5 quesadillas, 6 came out. The food runners just left the 6th quesadilla on our table even though we told them we didn't order it.  So now comes the bill and guess what? Not only did little miss snooty face waitress add the automatic gratuity on there (since she probably knew we weren't going to give her jack shit), she charged us for the 6th quesadilla. AND she gave us total attitude about it. When she walked away to find her manager, she huffed and puffed and when she spun away, she rolled her eyes - TWICE. So here comes the manager, Iggy, struttin up to us in his cheap Men's Warehouse blazer and gives us attitude about this damn quesadilla. Guess what guy? It's $5.50 - just comp it. You're a GD manager - take care of it. We're dropping a ton of money here, what's your beef? He finally goes to comp it for us and then throws out some snide remark about how Jayhawk basketball ""isn't even that good this year."" Regardless of how false this statement is, why on earth would he give us attitude about KU when half of the bar was filled with Jayhawks? What a d-bag. So, in conclusion: -overcrowded -overpriced -snooty, inexperienced waitresses who wear so much damn eye makeup they can't hardly see what they're doing. Seriously, they need to hire some better girls here because her customer service was terrible. I had MUCH trashier, poorer, and ruder people when I worked at Dave and Buster's in KC and I was 10 times as nice to them as she was to us.  -cocky faced managers who think because they graduated from some double wide that passed for a business school that they can be dicks to their customers -terrible bloody marys -no concept of what a ""special"" means I will most certainly not be back, thanks to Sarah S. and Iggy.",-0.9462,0.883,0.041,0.076,0.600297619047619

2009-10-24,4.0,"Bull & Bear is sort of a weekly staple for me because all my friends like to go there.  They like to go there because the ""girls are hot there"".  There's no question the girls are attractive there but there's a reason for this:  the guys are attractive there.  If you are an attractive girl looking for a hot finance guy, that's where you go.  That being said, the crowd is attractive - as far as the personalities of the people, it's a toss.  I've met a lot of attractive men there but I only want to hear 30% of them speak.   On a warm day, this place has a ridiculous line.  On a cold rainy day, this place has no line but  it's decently filled.  Considering how people like to hibernate in bad weather in this city - I'm going to say that that alone is impressive.  If you are looking to be around a lot of people, this place is a safe bet.  Although, put your d-bag radar on silent because it's gonna go nuts in there. Tap tables: You absolutely have to call ahead to reserve one.  If you are looking to get one on Thurs-Sat, I'd call early in the week.  I really would suggest a table because it get super packed in there and it's nice to have a homebase if you're going out with a large group.  You get 2 taps - one Budlight and the other varies (ie: Blue Moon).  They charge you by the ounce.  You pour your own after the first one (which your waitress will pour for you).  Don't do tap tables when you have a cheap alcoholic friend in your party. Food:  The burger is good here.  One of my friends rates it #1 on his Chicago Burger list.  The fries are SOOOOO yum.  The truffle fries?  Hi. Marry me.  The sweet potato fries? Delish.   Needless to say, we haven't done much more eating than that here - there's only so much room in our stomachs for drinking and eating. ;) Music: Hip-Hop/Pop40's/90's/BonJovi Service: Usual bar service of downtown Chicago. It's hit or miss.  However, the bartenders being mostly women - are better at being attentive with their male patrons.  Understandable.  I used to bartend too so I won't penalize for that.  Overall, I have a love-hate with this place.  I love this place most of the time as it will always offer a lively crowd, drinks, and the crowd is attractive.  BUT, the crowd is slightly uniform.  If it's a Thurs or any other weekday, it's a sea of light blue button-downs (what is it with finance boys and this particular color button-down?) and blackberry's.",0.997,0.78,0.178,0.042,0.6361811391223157

The beer selection is really good. They have taps built into some of the tables, and purchasing kegs is a rarely seen option. Digital readout on the table shows you how many ounces of beer you have left. If nothing else, kind of cool. The Cons:  The prices - $9 for Goose Island Mathilda which can be had for $6 at Hopleaf. Also, seating became a problem quickly. I arrived at 5:20pm on a Tuesday, and both front and back bar were full, as were the half dozen upright tables that sat 2-4. Herein lies the problem: all those tables situated for kegs are reserved for parties of 4 or more. I understand the reason for this, but the result is that the bar got PACKED with pairs of people. People blocking the bar, people (myself) blocking the door, people pretty much standing on top of each other...all while seating for about 30 remained available, but kept off limits. And while there were a half dozen cocktail servers, they were focused on the tables, so even though they were all over the place, I had to jam into the bar each time I needed a drink.

The place is a little narrow and it does get crowded, so the beer tap station kind of eliminates having to deal with the hassle by the bar. The display for games and matches are a little bit redundant. For instance, I saw the same game on two screens that were literally right below and above of each other--totally unnecessary.

2009-05-02,2.0,"In general, a nice looking place. Comfy booths.  Decent food (some hits and misses). Standard liquor and beer selection. Friendly waitresses.    I have been there twice in the past couple weeks, once on a Saturday and once during the week, so I'll break down each visit. On Saturday, there was a line outside.  The door guy was friendly, but not honest.  He would make people wait in line and say the bar was at capacity, but then let others in through a back door, thus insulting everyone standing in line.  The crowd was late 20s, lots of former frat boys and overdressed girls.  The DJ was mediocre at best - very little mixing or blending, random song selection, poor transitions. I don't know who wants to dance to Offspring at 1:30 on a Saturday night. We had one of the table taps, which is definitely the coolest part of this place.  No waiting, no lines, just beer.  But I assume it's pretty hard to snag one of these tables. On my Tuesday visit, there was a mix-up in seating.  Our group couldn't be seated because some tables were reserved or something.  Apparently this is one sports bar where you need a reservation.  We were told we would have a specific table within ten minutes, although the hostess clearly saw the group at that table had only just been served their soup.  Obviously they were at the table for another hour.  Meanwhile, my group stood around at the bar, staring at two empty tables.  Half our group left because of this.  We were finally seated after an hour and ordered a bunch of food and drinks.  One manager came over and bought a round of shots as an apology.  This manager was really nice - I wish I remembered his name - tall, skinny, brown-hair.   The other manager wasn't as helpful.  He seemed like he was used to working in clubs, because he just walked around and watched people.  He paid no attention to what was on the TVs.  This is my pet peeve for sports bars - there should be sports on the TVs.  If a game ended, I don't want to sit and watch Without A Trace - the manager needs to change the channel.  We asked him once but he made it seem like a big deal, so we didn't bother again. Towards the end of the night, there was a group of, well let's say, ""highly excitable"" people who sat next to us.  They kept getting up every few minutes to go to the bathroom.  They must have drank a lot of water before coming to B&B, because they didn't really drink anything there.  But they seemed to be pre-partying for Tuesday night at Stone Lotus (same ownership group).  The nice manager gave us passes for Stone Lotus, but after seeing the group next to us, we decided to skip going.  In summary - it's a decent place.  Not as big as I had thought it would be.  The whole table reservation thing is confusing.  Food and drinks are good but nothing to rave about.  Some members of the staff were really friendly, others not so much. Probably a good place to watch a Bulls or Cubs game.  Music wasn't good - crappy DJ on Saturday, 90s alt rock during the week.  One of the other reviewers hit the nail on the head when they said this place wasn't sure if it was a bar or a club.  Right now, it's not good at being either.",0.9922,0.829,0.118,0.053,0.45048291633037396

It's no different than any other place in Chicago!! Honestly, it was just a pricey Bdubs TRYING to be cool and trendy in formal wear. I do not want to wear my party heels to a sports bar nor eat chicken wings in my cocktail dress. All you yelpers out there know that Bdubs doesn't have the greatest food, but they don't try to be something they're not. It's a great place to gather, eat food, drink and catch the game. What else is there? If you want to go clubbing with the IN crowd go to the Underground. If you want a fancy ass, foo-foo cocktail that's $12 dollars go to Martini Park. Lastly THE FOOD!!! NOT. GOOD. We ordered two appetizers. First the Onion Ring Tower. It was 5 TINY o-rings on a stick in the corner of this huge wooden plate. It was the BIGGEST joke I have ever seen. I could have eaten all 5 tiny rings myself and I was with 2 other people. And it was on a stick. Not a tower!!  We also ordered the chicken wings. They were okay and I wouldn't even be complaining but this place is way pricey. And you could tell the wing sauce was butter and hot sauce. That's it-I figured the secret out! You could taste the butter. It was not good. Then I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich. It came with FATTY bacon. And let me tell you, I'm like Doug on the King of Queens-I use bacon as a condiment. This bacon was so gross I picked it off. And the chicken was seasoned with something that tasted not good. I opted for the ""healthy side"" of grilled veggies. Same nasty seasoning on them and BURNED to a crisp. Seriously, why did they serve me burned veggies and call it food??

The place looks great, is well designed and modern.  The staff are clearly very new, and seem awkward in their roles.    One thing that sets this place apart is the ""self-serve"" beer at the table.  This is technically very neat - with an embedded computer screen in the table keeping track of what you drink.   In practical, the bar staff does a pretty good job of keeping up, so the this isn't really necessary when you're stopping in for lunch or dinner.   To me, this is a gimmick - a neat gimmick, but one nonetheless. The food was good, but clearly overpriced.    I had a turkey club sandwich that was decent, but too expensive.  It came with sweet potato fries that were soggy.   The portions were huge, too much to consume in one sitting.",0.9734,0.781,0.191,0.028,0.6427272727272727

It's a a sports bar, plain and simple so forget any of the hype you hear. Plasma TV's everywhere. They even show games on the wall where there is no TV. In my opinion, they should stay with what they know. Offer up bar food and beer and call it a day, as to think this place is anything else is a mistake (which was my downfall as I believed the hype that it was a restaurant)  We went for dinner. I was told that the back area was less of a sports bar so I asked to sit there. But be forewarned- it doesn't matter where you sit- there will be TV's glaring in your face.  And there is no difference between the front and back room of this place. We ordered a couple of drinks. Before the server could even put mine down- I looked at it and knew it wasn't made properly. So back it went.  As for our food- their tuna appetizer has very little tuna and was ""well done"" versus seared. The mini Philly sandwiches were okay.  When our entrees came- both the pork chop and steak were also overcooked , the sweet potatoes undercooked, the truffle mac and cheese was pretty good once you dug under the burnt topping and everything was under seasoned. What the heck?  While the server tried- she was new and under trained as she should have noticed some of these things before the food and drink ever hit our table.  The manager did buy us a drink to try and compensate as the server told us that they have been having issues with their kitchen (thus the second star)  This place is expensive which is why, I guess, I expected more.  Dinner for two with a couple of drinks each was $150 before tip.  For that kind of money- I can pretty much eat at any place I love and have a great experience.

No less than 3 managers/supervisors, 2 busboys, and 2 servers were attending to our table. At face value that may sound like a good thing but it was too much, leaning towards overbearing.

The space offers up a warm, fun atmosphere, with a little more flavor, for people to just hang out, maybe watch the game, maybe flirt with friends & coworkers, definitely eat n drink, and have a good time.  Having to wait for a table (even if there are open tables with reserved signs, which are prob expected to be seated within an hour - decades to you, but not enough time for you to be done before they get there), or thirst for a drink a few extra minutes because it's really busy, can't possibly be the worst thing you could say about a new spot. The $500 booths were for opening weekend (and I think Super bowl Sunday too). Not at all the case regularly.

2009-01-25,5.0,"Congrats to Luke, David, and Brandon, along with Will and Morgan, and the rest of the B&B staff for a great grand opening weekend!  The much anticipated Bull and Bear has finally opened after years of conceptualization, planning, development, and staffing. And they have spared nothing to make this place great for its guests! First off, you might think it's just another ""American"" type pub in the River North area. How can it be any different? Well, let me be the one to tell you, it is! The atmosphere is ""sports, meets financial district, meets English Pub, meets lounge"". The best way to know this is to see it for yourself. Its décor is sleek and classy, yet comfortable and inviting. The ceilings are vaulted, which helps makes it feel larger than what it really is, helpful when they were packed on their opening night, not making me feel too claustrophobic! They have a DJ in their front area, where a large bar is also located for those wanting to stand in the front of the place and have easy people watching access. The DJ was spinning all types of music intermixed, and did a great job at balancing between top Pop hits and rap with old classics, making it not feel like a dance club or a lounge, but in some happy medium.  The exposed brick walls have projections of sports, and the large leather booths are reserved only, so be sure to snag one up if you plan on heading there with a group of people. The table tops have draft beer spouts, so that your beer is actually available for immediate consumption at the table without having to wait for your server to get it for you. B&B also boasts a pretty nice menu and offer late night eating as well. I felt so bad for their staff, especially the waitresses on Thursday night, as they were packed to the gill at the place, and they had to fight through a huge crowd to get to their tables. But these people are pros and I know many of them from previous employment in that area, so they have hired the best at this place. I can imagine this place being packed for Superbowl. It's a great place to go to still feel like you're going out without having to ""go out"" to a club or lounge and still dressy enough to not feel like you're at some dive joint. Great people watching, as River North's beautiful people were in full effect on their opening night, but I also saw tons of people that were there from surrounding offices, enjoying a great place to spend Happy Hour at.   I see stocks rising.

The food here is as good as it gets for a sports bar.  For appetizers we had the wings, nachos and pigs in a blanket.  All three were excellent.  The nachos had the perfect amount of cheese and toppings.  The pigs in the blanket were like nothing we'd ever seen.

The chef sent out a complimentary round of  vodka milkshakes that were just incredible.   For drinks we started with the built-in beer taps which are really a lot of fun.  I was pretty suspect about them at first, but the waitress was very upfront about the cost and how it worked.  At our table a Bud Light was $3.75 and a 312 was $5.  We moved onto cocktails towards the end which were very generously poured.

He agreed we could go out on a school night - but we'd be good and just drive there.  I called about 1/2 hour before departing and was informed that they DO have valet parking for $12 - fine - it would cost more to cab it.  We rolled up and were told to drive our own car to the parking lot kiddy corner from the bar. Some valet service!  Luckily, hubby got the LAST spot in the lot. We approach and were greeted by a stocky man dressed warmly representing The Carpenters Union - he handed me a flyer regarding the BULL about the Bull & Bear - and how it should be boycotted due to wage and benefit issues for the workers.  I've scanned it and attached to this review.

At first glance, I thought the place was pretty cool with nice flooring and big mirrors,  pretty, glossy 42"" plasmas all plastered against the walls and the gimicky stock ticker grazing the top of the main bar, but I soon realized that this place wasn't for me. It was the ""grand opening"" event which in my experience should be all about the bar showcasing all their best stuff.  Some free food, some free drinks - NADA.  The only thing this place had going for them were the scantily-clad and good looking waitresses (who by the way, were very SLOW) with their service.   There were a ton of empty booths which were all marked ""reserved"".  I asked our waitress what we could do to get a seat- we wanted dinner.  She said it would cost ""$500"".   I think B&B must be having some sort of identity crisis, not really knowing if they are a club or a bar?  There's no dance floor - so it's not a club.  But there are booths like a bar, so it must be a bar?  So, why the $500 table?  Figures, the owners are the same guys that run the douchebag clubs on Randolph. Eek!  Methinksnot!    This place is just stupid.  We ultimately left after downing our $4.50 budweiser f(we wanted out asap)  and headed next door to Lou Malnati's for a deep dish instead.  Yes, Lou's and B&B are at completely different levels but at least at Lou's - I know I'm spending my money on quality and not crap.

Although a little gimmicky (I'll admit) I love the idea of pouring your own beer at the table- I asked an employee and you can even reserve specific booths based on your beer preference! In addition to the booths, there are two large bars, a ton of high top tables and a very cozy VIP area that is elevated from the main floor.  All of the servers were friendly, upbeat and very knowledgeable about the menu.  By the end of the evening I had managed to try several of the specialty cocktails. They were all delicious, very creative and strong. The Vallarta was the fan favorite with blueberry infused Patron, it tasted like a grown up margarita! Usually sports bars with a good beer list don't have the greatest cocktail - this place really is the best of both worlds. All of the apps I tried were great. In sticking with the gourmet bar food theme, the nachos are made with a spicy turkey chili and homemade chunky guacamole- they were very tasty! They also have a selection of small sandwiches served in groups of three. We had the Philly cheese steak, and although they were a little stingy with the amount of meat, the flavors were great and the bread was perfect.  The star of the evening was the house cut fries served in a brown paper bag with a side of Aioli. Wow. I snagged a menu on the way out and all of the entrees, although a little pricey, sound great too- I can't wait to try them.   For us non-club types it's nice to have a bar like this where you can class it up every now and then with fancy drinks and food. It's great to catch the game and avoid the bouncer/techno scene at a sophisticated place.  I'm excited for this addition to the River North area, great to have an option like Bull and Bear around the corner from my office.",0.9978,0.764,0.213,0.023,0.6161417748917748
2009-01-20,4.0,"Bull and Bear is a great bar.  Seems like gimmicks on the way in, and there are a few, but if you want a good place to sit with good drinks and food in River North there are really very slim few choices. Good appetizers and sandwiches, anecdotally declicious selection of sweet sappy drinks from vodka to tequila to gin, and tabletop taps.  This is the biggst trick, but c'mon- who doesn't wish they could pour their own?  Polished service, friendly staff (eye candy).  The interior smells of nouveau whatever, but it's comfy and they've got tons of square feet of HD tv's which look awesome.  Great happy hour deals.  It might be my new place to get kicked out of often. PS. the bar has really bright lights underneath it- sort of highlight the lap area, dress (in)appropriately.",0.9928,0.683,0.278,0.038,0.6136363636363636

I was there tonight for the ""soft"" opening of the bar/grill.  We were able to sample many things off the menu and my friend and I had the following:  - Mashed potatoes with multiple types of cheese  - Philly steak minis  - Bison Burger  - Fries  - Apple pie  - Vanilla desert wih liquor (can't remember the name)   My favorite was the mashed potatoes with cheese, thick and cheesy, absolutely delicious.  The mini philly cheese steak are great because I don't think anyone else does a mini philly cheese steak and they are tasty.  The bison burger comes on challa bread with a fantastic relish on top and (I believe) brie cheese.   Eater beware, if you have not eaten bison before, please note that it is a very lean meat so you must order it Medium rare to Medium (at most).  Bison is not juicy (fatty) like a beef burger.   My favorite part of the meal was dessert, I loved ""Grandma's Apple Pie"" the crust was perfect.  My friend prefered the dessert beverage.   Sepciality cocktails were great, we tried the Gin cocktail with strawberry & basil.  But...what EVERYONE is going to be talking about will be the beer tappers on tables.  Yes, beer tap on your table.  You can pour your own beer, the allotment is measured electronically and you pay for the ounces you've consumed at the end of the evening.  What a concept!",0.99,0.819,0.158,0.023,0.6166666666666667
