2017-08-25,5.0,Must try!!! So delicious. I liked the veg one better than chicken surprisingly. Great portion and just perfection. Def sharable with sides if you're not starving since the crust and filling are pretty heavy. Reminded me of london :) The patio is also really cute and was covered with glass windows all around when we went. Adorable spot.,0.9881,0.562,0.438,0.0,0.85
2017-08-22,4.0,"I enjoy Pleasant House Pub. The ambience is that of a British pub, with a very limited selection of edibles, a large variety of beers on draft, excellent coffee and teas. The Royal Pies are not to be missed. My favorite is the Mushroom Kale pie. Second favorite is the Chicken Balti with a side of chutney. I also get a side salad (off menu) because it completes the meal so deliciously. The husband enjoys the after 5 PM Friday Special of fish and chips. Sometimes he treats me by sharing the crispier chips with me (yummy)! I love the Oatmeal Lace cookies sandwiched with deep dark chocolate ganache. Usually service is good. Our favorite waiter is Juneau, who is very knowledgeable, professional and friendly. His recommendations usually jive with ours. Street parking along Halsted or on Cermak near the Skylark. I highly recommend Pleasant House Pub.",0.9934,0.689,0.299,0.013,0.5563619047619048
2017-08-13,4.0,"Pleasant House Pub is one of my favorite places.   It's beautifully decorated with great ambiance and a relaxed vibe. I love that the menu sticks close to the English Pub vibe. I don't know many restaurants that specialize in pot pies (which I am not a huge fan of) but these pies are different with more of a flaky croissant consistency. The steak and ale pie has the most flavor.   And my favorite menu item is the Scotch Egg. I Wanted to try the weirdest things on the menu and ended up loving it.  It's a hard oiled egg rolled in sausage and fried in bread crumbs served with whole grain mustard and it's DELICIOUS!  Brunch is great as well. In a perfect world they would also Offer brunch on Saturday. I understand having seasonal menus or focusing on specific entrees but the menu is a little too limited.  And there aren't that many ""light"" options.

2017-08-08,4.0,"You know how hipster places often suck because the staff is either trying too hard or is taking itself too seriously? That is definitely not the case at the pleasant Pleasant House Pub. It's the same general setting as a ""hipster"" establishment (rustic, chic, and brunch) but there was no plaid clothing, facial hair, or eyewear anywhere! And, staff was genuinely nice and engaging, which is also contrary to hipsters! I'm glad we happened to dine in on a Tuesday, because they offer burger and beer pairings--which also come with a generous side of potatoes--for twenty dollars. I don't know if I'm just a sucker who has been conditioned to enjoy food-and-beverage pairings when they're presented to me by ""experts"", but I got the sense they have an appreciation for the craft. The beer offering complemented the brioche bun very well, and the portions were very generous. The overall presentation--from the food selections to the setting--has a very sophisticated feel to it. Strategy is methodical here without trying too hard. If I lived near here, I'd be a regular. Unfortunately, I live about 500 miles away from it.

I've passed by Pleasant House Pub many times usually on my way to Chinatown from the University Village area. Finally I decided to have a small birthday get-together here since I am into low key spots with good food and drinks, and this place was British! My friends and I met up in the evening and it was a grand ol' time. We had great service that kept checking in on us even though we weren't sitting in the main dining area. The outdoor patio is perfect in the summer with great people watching opportunities. While I wasn't hungry, I did try their Scotch Egg which was divine- a fried egg wrapped in pork sausage and coated in breadcrumbs. For libations, I stuck with their Bourbon Drink all the night and it got me sufficiently buzzed. Only major gripe is that there is a lot of construction happening next door beyond their control. If you're sitting in the patio, be weary that you may be competing with some unwanted noise during your time dining at this pub.

2017-07-23,4.0,"This place has been on my to-visit list, and I'm finally glad to make it happen. We came on a Sunday evening around 6:30pm, and all the tables were full. However, there were two open seats at the bar for us. It was a bit awkward in that all the beer dispensers were located in front of us and were a huge barrier between us and our server/bartender. He literally had to reach over the dispensers to give us waters and talk through the spaces between the dispensers to take our order. The inside of the restaurant is like a cafe when you first enter. There's a separate main dining area to the right. The bar is located between the dining area and kitchen, which is where we sat. The ambiance might be more romantic at night, but not as much during the day when the bright sunlight was illuminating the restaurant. The service was pretty slow at first. It took some time to get acknowledgment and our orders taken. That's what happens when you're working a dual role I suppose. We decided to order the following items: - Steak & Ale Pie: Though it wasn't bad, it didn't impress us either. We felt that the steak was too dry. On the other hand, I liked the crust. - Premium Steak Pasty: This was our second favorite dish. It was pretty savory and pleasant. The steak was more tender and moist than what was inside the Steak & Ale Pie. - Deluxe Gravy Chips: This was the best dish out of all three, though it was a side and not entree. It's a decent portion to be shared. The beef on top was tender and juicy while the potatoes were nice and crisp. Everything just worked well together. Though the portions look small, these three dishes were enough to make us both full. I think it's because they're all heavy dishes.",0.9948,0.816,0.168,0.016,0.5893537414965987

I also visited the old location next to Maria's (RIP) and remember the food quality being similar to when it was over there, so that's a positive. My friend and I came on Sunday at noon.  We ordered a Bloody Mary, orange juice, steak and ale pie, chicken balti pie, mash on the side, and home fries! I got the steak and ale pie and I enjoyed the buttery crust. The filling was good with plenty of tender beef but I think I prefer the chicken balti. The mash on the side was too gummy and hard (?) but the gravy helped a lot. My friend's home fries were delicious though, and in a huge portion. Perfectly crispy comers all around on those potatoes. The orange juice seemed to be freshly squeezed with tons of pulp, and it was relatively inexpensive for $2.50.

In my recent visit, my friend and I dined in early Thursday evening. It was just a tad busy at that time. We walked towards the bar and a delightful gentleman, who ended up being our server, told us to seat ourselves. We opted for a seat by the window. However, there ended up being a few ants there, so we relocated ourselves. We had great service throughout. He was very patient with us, especially since we took our time there and ended up staying for about two hours. Ambiance was great. There were a few other customers in the front room with us and we all conversed with each other (we weren't even next to each other), admiring the food. Great vibes. We both got the mushroom and kale pies, crowned and enjoyed a Beligan Pale Ale on draft. They have a fantastic drink list...many local breweries and solid cocktails. Our orders came out very quickly. The pie was so tasty and proportionately perfect. While creamy, I didn't think the sauce was too much so nor too heavy. The mushrooms and kale were definitely noticeable. The mashed potatoes and gravy were classic although the gravy was a bit too salty for me.  Overall, you can't go wrong with any of their food items.

Of course I couldn't leave without sampling the donuts and I must say, some of the best I've ever had!  They are naturally leavened and are currently filled with custard or homemade strawberry rhubarb jam.  The donuts are tossed in sugar, and the dough is perfect.  Not too sweet with the perfect ratio of density and fluffiness.  I would make a special trip just for those!   I can't recommend this place more!",0.9916,0.771,0.206,0.023,0.7368386243386245

The Steak & Ale and Chicken Balti Royal Pies were both delicious, each portioned exactly for one person. The pie crust was baked to crispy golden brown perfection and very flaky when you slice through it. I found them both to be well seasoned with the right amount of salt. If you like a traditional beef stew filling in your pie, go with the Steak & Ale. If you're feeling like having some Indian curry flare in your pie, go with the Chicken Balti.  I've never had Scotch egg before coming here, but now I'm wondering why more places don't serve this genius idea of wrapping sausage around a soft boiled egg and dunking the whole thing in the deep fryer. The result is a magical combination of crunchy, creamy, and savory all in one bite.  I had to try their toast because I simply love bread.

Now, I know you're busy, but at some point, you should have some place in your brain that tells you an inkling of my name, especially since I told you at least 5 times. You would think the host would have a slightly better sense of name to face since that's his job. After we sat, the waitress was very pleasant. The food was good. Nothing that blew my mind away, but definitely good food. Again, service was a little whacky. Someone brought the table next to us someone else's to go bag, and we were brought the wrong order.

2017-01-30,3.0,"I really really want to give this place five stars, but alas they haven't quite pulled it together yet, and I've been underwhelmed on more than one occasion. I have high hopes for Pleasant House - their pies are really quite delicious, and the ambience is absolutely lovely. Everything else just needs a bit of catching up.  Most notably - the service is very slow, and they don't accept reservations. More than once we have arrived to a room of empty tables (the front room), only to be told we can't be seated there. The excuse has been something different every time, so I really can't say what the deal is precisely.  My second concern with the place is that sometimes they don't have the food ready - i.e. they have no pies prepped (!) and as such they try to dissuade you from ordering those dishes. Something has been 86'd every time I've been there, so I think it really comes down to better tracking & planning on their part. This ties into the food taking a long time, I think. Third - the quality seems a bit inconsistent across the menu, once you venture outside of the pies. I'd love to be able to go there and get some lighter fare/some more vegetarian options. I know british grub is not renowned for its varied and daring palettes, but alas I feel something more could be done here.

I highly recommend the Chicken Balti or the Mushroom Kale. Eating this unique dinner pastry requires significant fortitude to refrain from devouring the creation in 2 min. Pay the 50 cents for sauce or gravy to top off all the extra crust from the pie. This may be the best part.  As with most any restaurant, the experience can be bettered or worsened by your waiter.

This location is far more spacious than their old location (on 31st street) and has more of a hipster gastropub feel as opposed to throwback 1920's bakery/possibly speakeasy.  I usually get the chicken balti pie which has a rich, delicious light-curry filling. The crust, of course, is out of this world. Dense yet flaky, perfect and delicious. I always look at the pies wishing they were a little bit bigger, but find myself sated and satisfied. If I ordered two pies, I could totally polish them off, but one pie is sufficient, despite how small they look. Their house made ginger fizz is amazing. It really packs a ginger punch but is sweet, syrupy and addictive. They always have different donuts on every visit. They remind me of paczki (pronounced poonch-kie) since they're round, stuffed with fruit or custard filling and rolled in granulated sugar. OMG the dough on these...it's seriously like eating a dense, heavenly cloud. And the fillings are interesting. I've had a pear jelly, papaya, and a blackberry before - all were rather unorthodox flavors but amazing! Damn, now I want a donut and a meat pie. D'oh!

We waited about 10 min to get sat, and granted we were waiting for the enclosed patio seating, but it really shouldn't take that long to clear off a table. For it being noon during brunch time, it wasn't that busy. When we finally sat, we were greeted by our server within 5 min., but he took 10 min to bring us our coffee. We ordered right when our drinks came, I had the Breakfast Chips, my boyfriend had The Cure. Who knew one sunny side up egg on top of sausage gravy potatoes and a dry bagel with two minuscule pieces of salmon with shitty whipped cream cheese would take almost an hour to prepare??? Our server came by once to refill our coffee, and then ignored us for 40 min. I saw another table that was also waiting awhile for their food, and I saw their server apologize to them for the wait and gave them a free croissant. Not only did our server not apologize, I literally did not see him for 40 min. He only checked up on us after our food finally came out, and I had to ask for a refill of coffee. I shouldn't have to ask! He didn't ask us how our food was. Me and my boyfriend have both worked as servers before, and we understand working when it's super busy or the kitchen is backed up. It wasn't even that busy! The whole experience took almost two hours out of my Sunday, and I normally don't mind that if I was having a few mimosas and brunching with my friends, but what we ordered should not have taken that long. The food was just ok, I feel like they spent more money on appearance. Cheap plastic cups for our water, along with plastic water pitcher--really?? The coffee was gas station coffee at best. My breakfast tasted like hamburger helper. My boyfriend's salmon and bagel looked mediocre and the cream cheese was probably imitation. Sometimes the food is worth the wait. In this case, it definitely wasn't. I'm extremely disappointed, and having just moved to the area, I thought this would be a nice new breakfast spot. I will never recommend this place to anyone.

We didn't go that late either on Saturday, so I was pretty bummed that they didn't have that. I was able to get the chips, and those were good. By chips, I don't mean crisps. They were perfectly crisp on the outside, just how I like my potatoes. I would say they resembled home fries in terms of their shape. I ended up getting the Mushroom and Kale pot pie. It was really good. I'm not sure what mushrooms they used but they really paired well with the kale. It was in a creamy sauce, but not overly creamy, just enough to hold the filling together. It was on the heavier side, so I wasn't able to finish the whole thing. We also got the Wee Jar O' Pickles, or something like that. Indeed, it was a wee mason jar with pickles. There were Polish dill pickles, radishes, beets, and cauliflower. I liked the pickled beets best.

The new location is the same great food plus an excellent beer menu.  The pies are as good as any you could find in in Bolton or East London.  And the beer selection is a sampling of what you would find in any good pub in the UK, plus a full range of US craft beer.  This is particularly pleasing because the boom in beer quality and diversity in the US in the last decade or surprisingly hasn't led to many American brewers producing any British ales.  This is one of the few places in the city where you can buy them - the Globe serves Greene King, but that's about it. A few small suggestions in case the management read this site:   1. A little more pie diversity would be good.  The steak & ale and chicken balti are classics, but an occasional lamb, or even a mozzarella & sundried tomato option for the vegetarians would be great.   2. Some of the beers are at the wrong temperature.  I had an ESB last night that was ice cold, which was a shame because it killed the taste of a great beer.  This might seem picky, but it was sort of like ordering a good red wine and finding an ice cube floating in it.  Bitters and the like should be cooler than room temperature, but certainly not cold.  Aim for just a hint of condensation on the glass, no more.   3. Don't put the mash on top of the pie -  it goes on the side!  And don't call it a Crown!  We get it - you have a royal theme going on.  But making your customers use your branding language when ordering is a bit Krustyburger.  Your food is much too good to need such gimmicks! Hmm.. I appear to have done a true British-style review here: 5 stars but more negative comments than positive.  Those were really very minor irritations - just the few things that stopped my trips from being perfect.  They certainly won't stop me going back repeatedly.",0.9952,0.749,0.184,0.067,0.4742658730158731

The chips were especially bad--undersalted, too small to taste the potato and with a layer of inedible hard crumbs on the bottom. Didn't help that they were served with no ketchup, mustard, hot sauce, vinegar, mayo or any other condiment. The peas were seemingly unflavored and not mashed in the traditional British style. The pasty was meaty and satisfying but lacking in spice. Service was also somewhat lacking. Not only were the chips delivered with no condiments, the coffee (bitter and overpriced at $3/cup, $1 refill) was served black with no inquiry about whether we wanted cream, milk or sugar.

Pros: --Beautiful, interesting decor--if you sit in the left room you get a nice view of a garden --Lots of seating. You could come here on a busy Saturday night and still be confident of getting a seat. --Good beer list, good cider options --Salad looked very good.

You have big beautiful windows. People like to look out windows. LIGHT is good. Seeing customers from the outside sitting and enjoying themselves in your establishment is EVEN BETTER.  When you move into a space like this it is not going to work just serving good honest food.

In addition to the same basic carryout kind of menu they have a few new things such as the Bangers and Mash which is considerable in size. As before, their cooking is determinedly a little lacking in seasoning and would be helped by salt & pepper shakers on the tables. Service was more than adequate, no waiting around here. For anyone allergic to soy, note that they use soy oil for all their frying (sob, sob). Ah, but the all-important thing here is: they have beverages! Interesting beers, and cocktails!

I really enjoyed the chicken balti with cilantro chutney and the cold pork pie with mustard and British pickle. The pie crusts were good and held up again the piping hot filling without getting soggy. The others with me also liked the steak and ale pie, but I missed the herb flavor in that one. The sides (chips, peas, mash with gravy) and optional sauces were good too. I was disappointed that they did not have the desserts listed on the menu. In their place, they had some cookies and other baked goods, which all looked good. We went with a couple of cookies, which we enjoyed as a starter. Overall it was a nice casual lunch. This place is good for a quick lunchtime bite or taking some time to enjoy a few pints on the patio. I would definitely go back when I'm craving some British flavors. Would like to try out the dinner service as the menu is bigger for that.

2016-04-04,4.0,"Tonight, I decided to try something different. Usually, you say something like ""I am in the mood for Chinese food"" or ""let's have Mexican."" But I discovered there is a British restaurant near me: the Pleasant House Bakery. I didn't even know British was a cuisine. I've never heard anyone say ""let's have British food."" In fact, from what I've heard, British people IN BRITAIN don't even say ""let's pop out for British food.""  I guess fish and chips is kind of a British food, right?  So, the place sells pies. Food pies. A nice, tall, flaky crust filled with a smooshed pile of dinner. The menu is simple. Just a few pies to choose from and half a dozen sides. Protip: ""chips"" is British for French fries. You aren't getting potato chips. The menu speaks British. I had the chicken balti pie and chips. It was very tasty and filling, but not too filling. It's rare to get just the right portion of food. The pie was flaky and perfect. The filling was a nice mix of flavors.  On the side, there was also a greenish paste which was a ""something something chutney."" I wasn't paying attention. When the really friendly, knowledgeable guy said ""would you like some glarble warble chutney, it's good,"" I didn't quite catch all of the words but my social awkwardness wouldn't let me say ""what is a chutney and what are those other words you said?"" Also, I didn't want to seem dumb by not knowing what chutney is. So I just said ""sure!"" After all, he SAID it was good. Why wouldn't I want something good? And it was pretty good. I can't really describe the flavor though. My advice: if they offer you the something something chutney, say yes and try it. It comes on the side, so you can ignore it.  The place is small and cozy, which is nice, but all of the tables are two-toppers. I am sure they would let you push them together if you came with a group, but I don't like to make assumptions about moving other people's furniture. So check ahead if you're bringing a group.  Two other minor notes. I took a window table and there was a little paper origami swan, about one inch long, sitting beside me in the window. I don't know if that's a permanent fixture or if someone just put it there or if some kid forgot their origami project, but if you can get the table with the paper origami swam, it actually adds a nice little bit of atmosphere. Not sure why. There's just something about origami paper swans. Maybe it's just a personal thing.  Secondly, when I went there, they were apparently playing one of Jan Hammer's collections over the music system. Jan Hammer was an electronic artist who enjoyed some minor fame in the 90s as a result of the Pure Moods albums and a series of computer animated shorts set to music called Beyond the Mind's Eye. And I haven't heard his music in years. It's very soothing. So, again, this is a point in the restaurants favor. But, I don't know if they play Jan Hammer all the time or just this one time. If you go in, maybe you can ask them to put on that CD. It's really good and kind of relaxing.  Actually, the combination of the origami paper swan and the Jan Hammer music might have been why it was such a relaxing experience. It really was a Pleasant House.",0.998,0.827,0.153,0.02,0.45826007326007323

It's a nice, unassumingly little place in my beloved Bridgeport and I appreciate the business owners who are trying to make the neighborhood better! I got a couple of things: 1. Scotch egg - Definitely a highlight, perfectly cooked, delightfully tasty. 2. Kale and mushroom pie - I liked this out of the two I tried. Nice and creamy. 3. Steak and ale pie - I thought it was good. Flavors didn't really excite me, but it was good. 3. Chips (home fries) - Pretty standard, good and crispy. There a few reasons I wasn't blown away. I wished the crust were more flaky--it was a bit dense and hard to get my knife through. The fillings were good, but it just wasn't anything too special.

This is my favorite British fare in the city; I can't stop raving about the royal pies! I'm very thankful, as someone who does not eat meat, that there is a kale and mushroom royal pie. The crust is SO crispy and flaky. Seriously. It is absolute perfection and if you haven't tried one of these babies, then you're seriously losing out! I also highly recommend getting the chips (basically fries) as a side, as well as the mouthwatering housemade ginger soda. I am NOT a soda-drinker whatsoever because those types of drinks are typically much, much too sweet for me. However, the ginger soda here is not overly sweet at all (yet still perfectly appeasing to my taste buds, I promise). You can tell that it's really fresh and they use real ginger.  Other info: You come in, you order and pay at the counter, you take a seat at the small yet respectable dining section, they bring you your food, you enjoy.

We walk in, we say hello, rude tattooed/pierced man doesn't respond.(nothing against his appearance, that's just the only description I have of him) My brother's girlfriend asked him what was in the salad, he answered ""it's in the case you can just look at it""...I'm sorry but as her and I both work in customer service, that is NOT how you answer. So based off what she was able to see, she just assumed she'd like all the ingredients in it. We went to sit down and each and every table was filthy. All were crumb filled and stained. We cleaned one off ourselves and sat down. When her salad came, she was disappointed that he didn't just tell her what was in it, as she doesn't like blue cheese.

It has a very limited menu which I don't mind because the main focus here is the royal pies. I think they have three types. I got the mushroom and kale pie. It was nice and hot but just a little heavy for my liking. The flavor was just okay for me. I also got the chips on the side which were pretty much dry crispy fries. For the drink I tried the hibiscus tea soda which I didn't like and preferred my friends ginger soda drink. My friends got the Baltic pie, steak pie, and scotch egg. My friends thought it was just okay too. It seemed like my friends liked the Egg mostly. I didn't try it though. In terms of pricing it's pretty affordable and it's street parking.

Ran out of fish and chips at the point though, so go early if you want it! Friend and I tried 2 pies to share, hibiscus soda, deluxe gravy chips, and a scotch egg. Steak and ale pie, deee-licious. So hearty, the crusty is beautifully flaky, and everything inside was cooked surprisingly well. Chicken balti tasted a bit too much like Chinese herbal medicine for both of us, maybe bad memories of childhood, idk. But we drowned it in the chutney they recommended on the side, and it was fine. I probably wouldn't get it again though.  Our scotch egg was perfectly runny inside, but the outside sausage was a bit bland... For $4.50 I'd probably skip this too. Deluxe gravy chips were really yummy. Really good beef. Small portion, but gets sooo heavy fast. We weren't even able to finish. Better to eat ASAP while still hot! The last thing I grabbed was one of their last loaves of sourdough for the day. Very affordable at $6 per loaf for ""artisanal"" bread, and pretty good! Wouldn't drive 30min out of the way to get it, but if you're in the area and eat bread regularly, this is really nice in the morning with some nice buttah... I feel like the pies for the size are a bit expensive, but with a side of chips we were pretty stuffed.

These aren't the huge full size dessert pies you are familiar with but rather are more like personal sized pies - perfect for a meal for one. It was just the right size for my dinner and I gobbled up every bit I could because it was so darn heavenly. My only regret - not trying their scotch egg.

In true British style, they offer vinegar for the chips as well.

I've also had the steak and ale pie, which is very good if what you want is meat and potatoes. I wouldn't call it bland, but it's quite simple.

It has curry in it the flavors were out of this world so rich n different the chicken was cooked to perfect the pie dough was so flaky i was just eating the left over pieces the green sauce makes this even better adds a garlicky spicy tone that really enhances the flavor of this pie was the best pie we had  Steak ale pie: it was good not great there was more carrots then steak in it jus it had no wow factor i wouldnt go out of my way to eat this wasnt my favorite  Deluxe gravy chips: it needed salt n i didnt really like the gravy wasnt as delicous as it was made out to seem on check please theres alot of meat n cheese n fries it just needed salt n they could have made the gravy taste better  Chocolate cake: i hate when theres a chocolate dessert n they dont say its dark chocolate its so bitter yuck :( plz say that it is dark chocolate so ik not to order it. Besides being bitter it was extremely dry like if i threw it at a window it would shatter it. also if ur gonna put frosting put alot not just a thin layer Almond cake: omg this was really good i hate really acidic things but since the almond cake was really sweet the lemony frosting really cuts through the sweetness n the actual cake wasnt as dry but it was still dry though they need to add something to make their cakes moist,0.9617,0.809,0.123,0.068,0.5925576519916143

I had eaten their fish and chips and tried all of their normal royal pies. It was pretty good. Inside with the macoroni and cheese were bits of tomato. The bacon was baked on top of the crust.  Reviewers had mentioned that the pies are only half-filled. Which is true as can be seen in the picture I have, and is more discernible without a runny sauce in the way. The peas were cooked quite well without being raw or squishy.  I also ordered their chocolate stout cake; the stout comes from those local brewery. The chocolate cake was so decadent, rich, moist, it was hard to eat down. The top coat of chocolate syrup was even smoother! It was honestly too much for me, and made me reevaluate labeling myself as a chocolate lover. Apparently I do have limits.  I wasn't able to wash down the cheesy pie with water, so I ordered a ginger soda. It was most helpful with the stout cake.  I like to come back to see how they continue to improve and update.

On that note I'll give you two VALID reasons why they got one star. #1 We sat in the back on the patio and 12 of us saw a RAT run into the establishment and back out TWICE!!!!  Now you are on an alley in Bridgeport you can't expect miracles but they must do something about that if they're running about with twelve people talking on a patio!  While this place is certainly not posh by any means I can deal with that.  I CANNOT deal with rodents OR RUDE SERVICE which brings me to   #2 We had twelve people eating there which was well over a few hundred dollars. We all had our plates and I went back into the restaurant and said to the register girl, who had about 4 people in line,  we're missing a gravy.  She said you'll have to wait a sec. and then she proceeded to go outside with drinks. Came back in and continued to take more orders at the counter.  She clearly saw me standing there so why not say I'll bring the gravy out or SAY ANYTHING! I'm NOT going to stand there and wait for you to take all of your orders while my our dish is getting cold waiting for something you forgot!  So I just said screw it.  This is ridiculous.  I left. She came back out running past our table of twelve and never said a word like do you guys have everything, how is everything.  IF YOU WANT THE SERVICE OF A HOT DOG STAND that's what you get!

My husband is British and sometimes, he gets that nostalgic look in his eyes when he recalls, Pasties, and Steak and Ale Pies--so, this was a great find.

But,for Valentine's Day, we decided to drive down to the 'sowd side' from our very comfortable existence in Old Town to experience the Bakery up close and personal. It was freezing cold and we found street parking on 31st Street which was an instant thumbs up. We walked in and to see the unpretentiousness of this restaurant in a world that has gone too far on superficial glitz, this is the antithesis. Small tables pushed up against the small eating area and just the act of setting your own table ware makes it very comfortable. I love the wall mounted fake fire. I had the Chef's special which was a curry beef pie. The pastry was what you would find on that fabulous baking show, 'the Great British Bake-Off', flaky and light. The curry was not one of those attack your taste buds to numb them flavors, but was a slow heat generating taste adventure in your palate. (You can roll your eyes...)But, it was really great and unusual. My husband got his Steak Pasty fix and even though he is a bit like 'Mike-y', he was won over. It is BYOB without a corkage charge.

2014-11-30,5.0,"I have a thing for portable food and I also have a thing for stuff that is wrapped all nice and pretty. Pleasant House Bakery's Royal Pies suits both of my loves - delicious little pies that can be eaten elsewhere and pies that are all wrapped in the most delicious crust.  The first time I ate here, it was because I had heard oodles about this place and I was literally driving past. I made my family stop to eat and it quickly became that one restaurant you reminisce about during family get-togethers. Located on an unassuming street in a quaint building, Pleasant House Bakery surprised us with their incredible food and their relaxed atmosphere. The first time we went, the place was quite busy - be warned: there is not a bunch of indoor seating - so we took our pies to go. Today, I went back with my family and actually was able to sit and enjoy the atmosphere. Quiet and mellow, with a waitress/cashier/employee (she seemed to do it all!) checking to make sure the tables were clean and the food was as amazing as expected.  As a family of four, we were able to try numerous items and each person was able to steal a bite of someone else's food. I personally ordered the Chicken Balti Pie with the side of chutney ($0.50 extra but definitely worth it!) and loved it so much that it was gone fast. I tried to savor each bite, and wait for it too cool off, but it was so delicious that I hardly stopped to talk to my family at the table. The chicken curry was seasoned perfectly - not too much of a kick - and the vegetables complemented it wonderfully. My father and sister each order the Steak & Ale and it was equally amazing. I had to fight my sister for just a taste. The steak was not tough at all. My mother ended up with the Steak Pasty and completely devoured that as well. My family and I love hearty food with great flavor and the Royal Pies were exactly what our taste buds desired.",0.9966,0.772,0.2,0.027,0.6046296296296297

The Scotch Egg- I have only had a few of these, but no complaints here, it was great.

We tried the Steak & Ale pie, scotch egg, and a Chicken Balti Pie. The staff suggested we add on a side of chutney ($0.50) and we agreed. Note: order the chutney. Order it. Ask how large a portion you can get and smuggle some home. Trust me.  We decided to dine al fresco in the rustic patio. It was pleasant but uses picnic tables. If you'd like a little more support and less road noise, stay inside.  The food arrived piping hot. The steak and ale pie was delicious and tasted strongly of its namesake ingredients. Imagine a high quality Irish stew in flaky crisp crust. The chicken Balti pie surprised. It is a curried chicken pie, but was very mild in heat while well spiced. Adding the chutney made it a transformative experience.  Lastly, the scotch egg. How they can consistently cook the egg so perfectly boggles the mind. It was, hands down, the best example of Scottish bar food I've had.

The place is like a small eatery and mainly for takeouts but that is not what I care about. I am for the pies ! My feedback (+ for good and - for you know what): (+) Good one person dinner sized pie (BIG) (-) The crusts are a little on the hard side (-) Ingredients do not fill the pies, they are like half-full (-) at $7.95 a pie with half-full ingredients, it is expensive (+) Steak and Ale pie: best meat pie ever tasted in Chicago area (-) Mushroom & Kale pie: lacking mushroom taste and fragrance (-) Chicken Balti pie: on the dry side so less tasty, better if moist May occsionally drop by for the Steak & Ale pies if around the area.

2013-07-21,5.0,"If all British food was like this, I suspect we'd be trying to go back to colonial status. Here's the straight dope on the Pleasant House Bakery. First, it ain't your mama's bakery. No pastel cookies, no petit fours, no row-upon-row of shortbread yellow smiley face cookies. Neither is it a light, airy Wonka-esque paradise.  The furniture is gray. The walls are gray. I'm fairly sure the floor is gray and for what it's worth, So, I think, is the ceiling. Several minimalist-but-sturdy tables and chairs, an open kitchen and a covered outdoor eating and bar area is all the place has. Frankly though, they could serve their food over 55 gallon drums and make people sit on pickle buckets.  They boast a largely farm-to-table set of raw materials, which is fantastic for people in small hats and tight jeans who pretend to care about that, as well as for anyone else who eats there. Good ingredients always make the best product. Always. We went on a Saturday morning just after open, so there was no crowd. In fact, we were the only ones in the joint. As this particular Saturday's weather was particularly brilliant, we ate outside. I ordered the Chicken and Leek and my date ;) ordered the mushroom and kale.  (as an aside, I've heard the word 'kale' more in the last 2 years than at any time in my life previously, and because of that, I fear it has lost its' meaning) I picked out a ginger fizz homemade soda and we sat down, waiting for the food to come. I hate to do comparisons like this, but I will. What Bang Bang is to biscuits, this place is to pies.  Sweet mother of pastry crust were these things delicious. The chicken was prepared well and properly sized in the pie (believe me, that counts). The leeks were tasty and a bit crisp and the crust will make you hate your gramma. The mushroom and kale was equally fantastic. ultra-thin slices of mushroom, wilted kale, white wine and herbs with fresh Parmesan.  I cannot say enough good about the home made sodas either. The ginger fizz will make you smile. It tastes REAL. Like sodas used to. The ginger and lemon in the soda was a winner. It's not diet though, and don't expect that. Oh, and for all you gluten-free jackanapes (that are just a few pounds overweight and not actually celiac) feed your secret gluten addiction and eat here. You can go back to hating your buckwheat pancakes tomorrow. A note on the service: Everyone we came in contact with was absolutely delightful, helpful and generally awesome (totally sorry to hear about your bike dude...good luck with that). I believe the owner pulled up in the pie truck just as we were leaving and thanked us and took a picture. Chive On, owner dude.

2013-06-23,4.0,"Capsule review: Inexpensive English pub food, counter service, sleek and modern setting.  The concept of the place is slightly confusing. You enter into a very small, irregularly shaped dining room that looks fairly upscale (minimalist furniture, monochromatic gray walls and floor, low lighting, stylish patrons). But when you approach the counter, the staff are wearing soccer jerseys and you order from a chalkboard menu. Meals are about $8 for a generous portion, and sides are a la carte. The focus is on pot pies. There was also a fish and chips option.  The pie tasted good and looked really beautiful. But I do not want to know the nutritional content of that meal. Good lord. Even though I had the veg version (mushroom and kale), I felt like I was about to have a coronary between the buttery crust and super creamy filling, not to mention the large portion size. But if you're not watching the fat content of your meal, this gets a thumbs up. It's very tasty, very filling, and very reasonably priced.    Pleasant House may not love this recommendation, but I gotta say, if you overconsume just a little at Maria's next door and you need something to slow the booze going to your brain, a pot pie at Pleasant House will do the job admirably.",0.9616,0.861,0.111,0.028,0.5489795918367347

We ordered two steak and ale pot pies with a hibiscus tea soda and ginger ale. Food and drinks were served within 10 minutes. The pot pies appear tiny but they're filling.

Ok, truth is I didn't have to take the bus here. We were having brunch someone else near and decided to walk here since it was nice outside. I didn't have much of an appetite and the boy was full from his meal, so we weren't thinking about getting food. I just wanted to check this place out. What, after all, is the big deal with these pot pies?  Located on a cute little cross street with some shops around the corner, Pleasant House is unassuming and relaxed. No waiter service or fancy decor. It looked a little messy in its own charming way. We walked in and was greeted by the man behind the counter. We chatted with him for a little and debating whether or not to get something to do. But too full from brunch, we couldn't think of possibly fitting something else in our stomachs, so I got a cookie and we sat down at an empty table while I munched on my cookie.  It must have been torturing for him to look at some others eating their pies, because about 2 minutes after we sat down, he gave in, stood up and took his wallet out:  ""Ok, I don't care if I'm full. I just want to try this stuff."" He said and walked to the counter.  And was I glad he did that, because I got to try a little of his pie, the steak and ale. It was soo yummy, with tender steak inside and flaky crust outside. I am never a big fan of pot pie or pie crush, but that thing was sooo good I kept munching on it. The best part, IMO, was the pie crush at the bottom, soaked with delicious flavor. Don't waste that crush, it's sinful! We also got a ginger soda (homemade to go), a little too sweet for my taste, but you can really taste the ginger (which is absolutely wonderful). As we wobbled out of Pleasant House, I immediately resented the fact that it's not closer to my hood! But my point is, if I had to take the bus here, I would.

The only place that has come close with the fish and chips is shaw's on hubbard but pleasant house has them beat! i recently tried their brunch menu - i was shocked at how good it was. not that i didn't think it would be, but also hands down one of the best breakfasts i've ever had. My boyfriend had a jerk chicken breakfast (only happens the first sunday of the month?) while i had sausage, eggs, ham and beans. really really well seasoned and all around grade A quality. i've never yelped before, but the thing to stress about pleasant house is the quality of ingredients that go into their food. they grow most of their vegetables and use local folks for the rest of their items, steak, fish etc. When you go, try their hibiscus tea mixed with the ginger ale like half and half. very refreshing. Also be sure to try one of the cookies - i'm not sure the name but it has a chocolaty inside and wafer crisp and thin. check this amazing place out and enjoy!

The house-made ginger soda was unbelievable.  Seriously, if you love ginger - and I mean LOVE ginger - this will blow your mind.  I wish I had the recipe. I ended up waiting a couple hours to eat the pie, and though it was recommended that I eat it hot, it was still just as delicious luke-warm (and is actually pretty well insulated by the crust).  The flavor was delicious, it was BIG, and the pastry crust was flaky and buttery and perfectly soft when soaked with the juices from the filling.

I ended up ordering the steak and ale pie with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy to go.  It took less than five minutes for them to pack it up.  The steak and ale pie was filled with steak, ale, carrots, and an assortment of herbs.  I didn't really enjoy the filling as I thought I would, but the crust is what really made the pie.  It was fried to a golden brown with the right enough crispiness and flakiness.  Nothing about the mashed potatoes stood out to me, it was pretty plain and kind of dry.  Thank goodness I said yes to the gravy. Overall, I'm glad that I tried out the pies for myself.  I know I wouldn't have enjoyed it as much without the crust.  Maybe I'll try out the other pies to see if I would like those more.  I just think it is a little overpriced for what you get.  It is $7.50 for a muffin size pie and $2.00 for a scoop of mashed potatoes.  But I still recommend you to give this place a try if you haven't already.",0.9822,0.852,0.125,0.024,0.5406298003072196

And then I recalled the public house being in Bridgeport. (Mouth wide shut) I was all set and ready to go to Pleasant House and it had dawned on me that while Bridgeport is undergoing a bit of change, there is a still a lingering sentiment in that part of Chicago that reminds me of being in the Southern part of the US again. Kale and mushroom pie. Steak and ale pie. Chicken balti pie. Ginger soda. Black tea. Trifle. On my first visit, I ordered a kale and mushroom pie for take-away. The inside of Pleasant House is small and all of the tables were taken. Even when one became available, there was an older guy there who stared at me as though I had decended in a spacecraft and ruined his garden. Leaving was a good option, as I enjoyed the kale and mushroom pie without further concern. I returned a few months later and got a seat. The steak and ale pie made me want to weep, as it was so reminiscent of what I've had in London that I was homesick. So much flavour from the tender steak and light gravy. The spuds with the red wine gravy and ginger soda were worthy of a second try of the eatery. For a third calling, I returned with a friend and had the chicken balti pie with spuds [again] and English peas buttered with mint. Pure happiness. And for a sweet, I had a trifle, a parfait of sponge cake, apples, and whipped cream. The service at Pleasant House is very representative of the name. There is a hipster air about the eatery in terms of the customer base, unlike what I had experienced the first time going.

I didn't want to be the black sheep again like I was with the cafe across the street, and so many other sub-standard businesses opening up in Bridgeport that are being raved about simply because they're in Bridgeport. On top of that, having lived in the UK for nearly 2 years and not having a single good meal outside of Indian restaurants, the odds were stacked against Pleasant House.  Well, I should have gone in sooner. The food is good. Not INCREDIBLE. But quite good. The 5 stars is because not only for how incredibly unique and courageous it is to open up a meat pie shop, but the customer service that was both extremely warm, friendly, and adept at the same time. It's a little pricey in comparison with some other food in the area, but you're getting a carefully baked culinary masterpiece, not a Gyros. Put in some white tablecloths, and this place could be asking a hell of a lot more than $10 for a meal.  Again, everything here is unique. Their recipes are different than the ones I'm familiar with in the UK, and quite superior. Even the baked goods are a dose of ""I'll try whatever the fuck that is"", and you're rewarded for your willingness to let them call the shots with your palette.  I can now understand how this place has an unintended viral marketing campaign in Chicago.

Steak ale pie - good home made taste, a little bland imo 3. Scottish egg - Tasty, but I would recommend sharing with someone if you can as the egg taste quite heavy along with a pie.  The only knock on Pleasant house is that the price is a bit steep. Especially $4.00 for a hard boiled egg deep fried with a thin layer of pork. The pies also have a lot more crust than fillings.

That being said, the bar next door isn't the best atmosphere for dinner.

The outside was golden crisp, the size of a 3 inch circle and 2 inches high. As I cut open the top, I tasted the minced meat, and it reminded me of minced meat you'd find in spaghetti which I absolutely LOVED. As I cut into the pie and ate the filling with the crust, it was a match made in heaven. It's nothing like a marie calendar pie. The dough that is used is much much tastier!

I'd walk in, look at all the pies visible through the glass and walnut case, sit down in a cozy spot and have my royal pie. Not having looked at the pics here, I had no idea it was a divey old fast-food space with all the charm of an old rec room. But I've always referred to Bridgeport as Chicago's basement rec room, so the symmetry was perfect. I also missed any kind of bakery smell, especially if they were making pasties. Pasties in the oven have a uniquely pungent and delicious aroma. I grew up with that smell. But enough about the space and my own imagination. We sauntered in for a weekday lunch when there were a few other patrons there. The pies are visible nowhere. There's a counter for ordering with a chalk board menu above.  I'd been longing for the kale mushroom pie I'd read about, so I ordered that. My chum got a pasty. We also had a hibiscus tea-flavored soda. We sipped our sodas, which were amazing, and waited about 10-15 minutes for the pies to arrive. We did not order sides, and the pies arrived on an otherwise lonely plate. Would be nice to get a thimble of slaw, or something ""with."" A smattering of greens? In short, both choices (I stole some pasty) were absolutely toothsome and flavorful. The pastry was nothing short of exquisite. I felt naughty eating it. In the midst of our dining, the owner blew in, greeted us warmly, and asked us how the food was. We just gushed. And it was good to hear that there are outlets up north for these wonderful, original pies.

2012-08-12,4.0,"When out-of-town friends ask me for a recos when in visiting sweet home Chicago, Pleasant House Bakery is on my rather long list of go-to spots that everybody loves and for the most part, can afford... but for myself, I wouldn't consider a destination spot.  Everyone I know rants and raves that Pleasant House is sooo good, and it is, but only to an extent. I've come here numerous times over the last year and a half, always on someone else's accord, be it work meeting, going away din before after party at Maria's or just for a Sunday lunch destination. I can't say that I've ever had a bad experience here as the staff are spectacular and the place is a decent amount dingy and a decent amount cute as f*ck, but I'm just really not in love with the pie.  Savory pies sound so delicious but as far as the one veggie pie option goes, it's just okay. Really cute, kinda dry and personally, I like a little more flavor variation. The Mushroom and kale veggie pie is a great option to have, but unless they switch it up soon, I probably won't be back. I'm just kind of over it and in all honesty, feel like it's at about a 3-star level these days. Today, in fact, I was so over my kinda of/sort of pretty bland pie that I gave 1/2 of it away to a much hungrier member of my crew and opted to grab a more tantalizing spicy dish at an area India restaurant after.  On the other hand, I just found out via a tiny sign hidden off to the side of a bunch of other signage near the counter, that they do Sunday brunch from 2-5 for $15 with what looked to me some really fantastic looking tea sandwiches, BUT you have to make reservations in advance. Boo. :(  Their house-made sodas are also usually a staple in my order at Pleasant House with the ginger-ale and hibiscus tea, but today I just wasn't digging how syrup-y the tea was and how not-so-gingery the ginger-ale was. I've definitely had better from them before.  Regardless of my less-than-rave review of PHB, I still think everyone should go at least once. It's an experience and it's unlike anything else the city has to offer. So while it's not my slice of pie, the odds are in favor of it being yours.",0.9968,0.782,0.182,0.036,0.6090909090909089

Drinks are all homemade. If you aren't familiar, make sure you ask for the taste. Otherwise prepare for a surprise! I came in with my boyfriend to try the steak and ale pie and the chicken balti pie. By the looks of it, it is about the size of a muffin with a crispy and brown crust. Beyond the crust sits the soft steak and carrot bits. The taste will mingle in your mouth as you prepare for a second bite. However, the crust was a bit packed too tightly and dry for my taste. Yet, it is doable if you have a drink to go with it. The service is awesome. The boss is funny and very nice. He will recommend and admit faults (he forgot our drink).  I'm not sure if we were supposed to grab our forks and napkins ourselves but the boss got them for us when the food came out.  I might come back in the near future when my cravings come again.

Service was very warm and friendly.  I was greeted as soon as I walked in and the owner/chef came by later to check on my meal.  The seating area is cozy if you're optimistic, or just plain cramped if you're a realist.  The food is definitely worth it, and you can always take your pies next door to Maria's Bar.  Or you can embark on your own DIY al fresco experience and head over to Stearns Quarry on Halsted for great views of Bridgeport and the city.   Judging from all the Yelp love, I'd say the cat's out of the bag on this place.  I'm glad to see a place with Pleasant House's dedication to quality ingredients and food thriving.  Seems like big things are ahead w/ their food truck and perhaps a wood fired oven in the future.",0.9962,0.777,0.204,0.019,0.5291639441639442

2012-06-14,3.0,"Even though I've read nothing but good things about Pleasant House it has taken me over a year to finally try their fare. I blame the fact that eating meat pies isn't a normal routine of mine.  The steak and ale pie was petite in size and traditional in taste. Though I'm no meat pie expert the flavor combination of the pie was familiar. It was tasty. I liked it enough and obviously made of quality ingredients. But I fear the crust was dry and the innards, though good, wasn't enough to balance out the dryness of the crust. Gravy might fix this. The side of chips, which are chunks of potato deep fried and put in a bowl, were a mixed bag. Some were undercooked. Some were overcooked. Nothing great about them. Ketchup couldn't save them. Gravy? Sure. Gravy might fix things. The ginger ale I drank with the meal was crisp, refreshing, very herby, and delicious. The day I went pizzas were the special and my wife ordered ""The Queen"" pizza which involved tomato sauce, spinach, and mozzarella cheese on a homemade crust. Good intentions. More or less mediocre.  And I guess that's the general theme of my visit. This place cares about their food. They care about their ingredients. They care about their customers. But good intentions only goes so far. The flavors were there at times but I left wanting something more and unfulfilled. But I'm not giving up. Restaurants who care need to stay in business and with their many weekly specials I'll have several options to continue to support them.

Situated conveniently close to Maria's next door (can't they just cut a hole through the wall though? Seriously!), Pleasant House serves an amazing burger. A few other places in Chicago are my normal go-to places for burgers, but PH blows them away. It was cooked to medium rare perfection, exactly as I ordered it. The only caveat about their burgers is, they don't have a long list of toppings you can add to a burger, just a few items. Otherwise, the burgers just come as they imagine them, and they do have quite a gastronomic imagination. The fries are also just as wonderful, chunky, crispy affairs that make you think of something homemade, rather than of something you ordered from a restaurant. I also tried the meat pie, Pauly style, and the Scotch egg. Both were equally as good as the burger, and I shall return for a full portion of the pie.

The menu is small and specialized. It's British food, but don't let that scare you off. There is such a thing as good English food, trust me, I lived there. And Pleasant House does a good job of it. They have pies and pasties and sometimes fish and chips. I tried a steak and ale pie with a side of chips and gravy. I will say the best thing about this pie was the flaky, perfect crust. It was seriously wonderful. The inside was hot and tasty. The chips were cut short and crispy which I really like. The side of gravy, aka: brown sauce, which I poured over the chips, was pretty good too. My sister got the mushroom and kale pie which I had a bite of, and it was delicious. The service was friendly and the food came out quickly. The table tops were marble, kinda unexpected for a place like this. I don't know why I felt this was noteworthy, but it jumped out at me and I liked it. I guess you will notice the name of the restaurant has the word ""bakery"" in it. Yes, they had sweet baked goods too. I guess I will have to try them on my next visit.  If half stars were available, I would give this place 4 1/2 stars.",0.9983,0.751,0.235,0.014,0.5486111111111112

The place specializes in meat pies; we sampled a Chicken Balti and a Steak and Ale pie. The crusts are almost impossibly flaky, and the fillings are exquisite and flavorful. The chips and mash we sampled on the side were both delicious. You can eat very well here for around $10. Oh, and it's BYOB... what more could you want? Pleasant House Bakery gets five stars because it's cheap, unique, and most importantly, delicious.

2012-03-09,4.0,"Wow. Small, nondescript store with a boring sign and a basic diner-style interior serves amazing British(?) pub fare. We went with Aaron's parents for dinner on Sunday night. The place is very small and busy, with lots of people coming in and out. And the menu is small--chicken pie, steak pie, mushroom pie, and a steak pasty (around $7.50 each), and there are several potato sides to choose from. This makes the choice easy. I don't know what I would have done if there had been more options. We had the steak and ale pie and the mushroom and kale pie, which were delicious! I would describe the mushroom and kale pie as heavier on kale than mushroom, and I loved that there were two superfoods in an indulgent gravy and even more indulgent ""pastry."" The mushroom filling was a little better than the steak, which wasn't as tender as I'd like, but both were great. The best part of the dishes, however, is the pie crust, which was incredibly flaky and buttery. In fact, I think it was the crust alone that elevated the pies to its memorable, mouth-watering status. In addition to the pies, we tried the Deluxe Gravy Chips, house-made ginger ale, and a lemon-Earl Grey trifle. The Deluxe Gravy Chips--potato wedges drizzled in a thin gravy with bits of steak and cheese--were tasty but not nearly as exciting as the pie.. The ginger ale could have been spicier (though Aaron said the ginger taste was already strong). The trifle very creamy, and I'm a huge fan of Earl Grey as a dessert flavoring.

We each got the same thing--the steak and ale pie, topped with mashed potatoes and gravy upon recommendation. I also got a glass of house-made ginger ale. We sat down at a little table and listened to some BRUCE along with the cheerful banter of the kitchen staff. The decor is fresh and modern and they let you bring drinks over from Maria's next door (Maria's will let you bring Pleasant House food into their bar too). My ginger ale was delicious and I look forward to trying some of the other house drinks. I have always gotten the steak and ale pie with mashed potatoes and gravy, but I hear the mushroom and kale pie is very good as well. I have also been eyeing their deserts.  A note about their meats: For the past two years I have been living as a pescatarian and only recently have begun adding other meats to my diet, as long as they are ethically derived.

Then again, I pointed at classmates when my geography teacher asked me if I knew where Chad and Jordan were on the world map... I kid, I kid, but Pleasant House Bakery does not. They put a lot of focus on keeping a simple menu full of items you're likely not to find at your average breakfast/brunch spot. It seemed apparent they will likely always have something different on their menu and in their glass case.  The exterior will add to the disconcerting feeling you may get when you walk in. That'll all erase when you talk to their friendly, humorous, and inviting staff. Most are quick to tell you what their known for, a little about the business, and what you should enjoy before leaving.  MAIN FOCUS, git you a stuffed pie! A friend had their mushroom and kale, I had their Steak and Ale. Their a husband & wife operation (with plenty of talented help) and the wife (sorry, didn't catch your name) is a pastry chef. So the pastry casing is excellent.  SECOND MAIN FOCUS, DO NOT!!!! I repeat, DO NOT leave without getting their scotch egg. The egg is medium boiled and has a fabulous velvety texture. The surrounding sausage is perfectly crispy and savory to compliment the expertly prepared egg.  Their citrus salad shouldn't be forgoten, clean and crisp endive with a suttle dressing, lots of black pepper, fennel, and what I wish was a few more pieces of grapefruit.  We also had a couple slices of dessert, cant remember what they were. One was an almond pie deal, the other a lemon meringue concoction. Again, they likely change this on the reg since one of the owners knows her stuff with a rolling pin.  Pleasant House Bakery is a ""pleasant"" surprise that serves up a twist on breakfast/brunch with a whole lotta personal attention to their product. You feel the love in this place and you can even wash yourself with their goods...becuase they sell soap, lip balms, and other homemade hygienics.",0.997,0.798,0.186,0.016,0.5826617826617827

I'm somewhat ashamed to admit that despite having been in the bar next door and frequenting a restaurant just down the street, it took Yelp to get me in the door.  Enough of that.

Incredibly friendly employees too, a 'pleasant' surprise at what essentially is a counter-service dive.

A TV showing pictures of the place and their rooftop garden.  I think of Two Fat Ladies when I read the menu. (For those of you who don't know about Two Fat Ladies its a cooking show from the early 90's that took place in England. The were very English). Because it looks like the kind of food that they would have enjoyed eating. Also a lot of English usage of words like Chips=fries. Meat pies are also very English.  They are all about the food here. Everything is hand made and super fresh. I had the steak and ale pie and it was everything it promised to be. The pie crust was super flaky and tasted of butter. Inside was super tender meat in a rich dark gravy that had an awesome dark beer after taste. The gravy chips are the best cheese fries ever. They take their chips stick em in a bowl drown them in a rich beef gravy top it with white cheddar and grilled onions. The were almost a meal in itself with the salty, cheese, beefy, perfectly fried potato goodness.  They also make their own sodas. The ginger soda is not super sweet and very gingery and refreshing. A nice counter for all the rich meaty goodness experienced here.  This place is also walking distance away from me. It's an awesome addition to our little neck of the woods.  You should go here.

2011-12-07,5.0,"Truth in advertising. Actually, they're under-selling a bit. It should be 'Awesome' House. It's not going to win any awards for decor and if you're not looking for it, you might pass it up BUT you're coming here for stick-to-your-ribs-knock-your-socks-off pies and everyone has a GPS (Big Brother) these days, so you'll be fine. Plus, you can eat your food at Maria's. Done. Right? Well, sorta. You need to know what to get, mkay? Everything. Get.everything. Obviously, it's a bakery, so you're going to want to hone in on the baked goods. I'm not much of a beef fan, so I stayed away from the steak and ale pie, but it smelled wonderful (which was a surprise to me; as said before, I don't eat beef). The chicken balti was a revelation of curry spice, tomato and chicken that tastes like it came from a farm, not a factory. But the real standout, the gotsa-gotsa... is the mushroom and kale pie. This is the second time in recent reviews that a veggie dish has turned me out. There might be a pattern. This pie is served in the same flaky, buttery shell as the others but inside, a rich chorus of greens, parmesan cheese, mushrooms, scallions, and white wine await to put your mouth, stomach and soul into a state of quiet nirvana. Usually, I am up slapping faces and screaming to the heavens when I find something this good to eat. Not so this time. I shut down. All that mattered in the universe was the forkful of veggie bliss that was going from my plate to my mouth. In.credible. This is the kind of food they eat in England? I've been tricked into thinking that I had nothing to look forward to but bland potatoes and boiled cabbage. I was sold a bill of goods! Now that I think of it, Henry VIII was pretty hefty... Beyond the pies, there are even more savory surprises. If you like poutine, you'll love the gravy chips... which are poutine with steak. Again, not being a fan of eating the cow, I forwent the meat, but thick-cut chips, covered in gravy and cheese is always ALWAYS good. And, it's also poutine. A side of coriander chutney made sure that all of my food had a nice aromatic kick and I was pleased as punch that my belly grew three times its size. Speaking of punch, you have to get the tropical tea soda. House-brewed tea. Homemade soda (it's a thing). Hibiscus. Has it sunk in? Pink, fruity, fizzy tea!! Homemade!

2011-11-27,5.0,"Have you ever find a place so astonishingly perfect that nothing or no one could make it better? Well, I found that place and it's actually a bar next to Pleasant House called Maria's. And when the boys manning the bar (the experts on cool) at Maria's started waxing poetic on the culinary revolution taking place at the little bakery that could, I was naturally all ears. Soon, a group of us met for dinner. Don't be fooled by the name - though Pleasant House is indeed a bakery, their menu consists of savory items exclusively.  Would Tarantino still dig this spot? Um, of course. You'll notice PH is a small space so we asked the staff if they could kindly deliver our prizes to Maria's. Seems they do this all the time - hooray! What did I try? What didn't I try is more consistent with what happened next. From the housemade tropical tea soda to the Chicken Balti pie, from the deluxe gravy chips (like a second cousin to poutine) to the decadent Scotch egg, it was all a blur of food that made everything right in the world. I wasn't sure what I'd think of the signature dish, the Royal Pie... after all, ""savory"" + ""pie"" summoned visions of Banquet frozen pot pies in my skeptical mind. But the outcome was exactly the opposite: The crust was spot-on flaky, with just the right amount of buttery love, zesty spice and plump, all-natural chicken.  A few weeks later, Maria's held a tasting and guess who catered the free event? Pleasant House! I took this special opportunity to try the mushroom and kale pie (surprisingly, my favorite of the lot!) and a steak pasty (I may prefer these to the pies!). Up next: A Friday visit to PH so I can get my hands on their beer-batter-fried fish with chips and homemade Meyer lemon tartar sauce.  Did you hear, um, read that? MEYER LEMON TARTAR SAUCE.

2011-11-21,5.0,"My #1 happy accident of 2011, bar none! My wife and I were wandering around the Bridgeport area and decided to go check out Maria's for a craft beer on a quiet Sunday afternoon. After parking up the street a bit, we immediately took notice of Pleasant House as we passed on our way to Maria's. As we were enjoying Maria's, we saw someone walk in with a large tray of assorted pastry-looking items and were struck by the AMAZING scent that followed. I felt like one of those cartoon characters who might float from the ground and wistfully follow a scent trail to its source. We inquired about the 'menu' to our bartender who clued us in on what was going on next door at Pleasant House Bakery. As we paid our tab and headed out, we knew we had to stop in and grab something to take home. We soon met Chelsea who welcomed us to her bakery and gladly walked us through the menu. We quickly decided on two royal pies; one steak and ale and one chicken balti. We were urged to order a side of coriander chutney to accompany the chicken balti pie and were egged on by the next customer in line who pleaded ""I swear you'll lick the container when you're done!"" SOLD! After a brief wait, we left with our wonderfully aromatic parcel and high-tailed it back home for a quick reheat in the oven and we were soon blissfully enjoying our pies. As another reviewer already mentioned, this is truly comfort food at its best. I can't wait to return on a cold snowy night to enjoy a couple dark ales at Maria's followed by a royal pie (or two???) and perhaps a nightcap at that cool-looking coffeehouse across the street!

2011-09-25,5.0,"I write on Yelp, only when emotionally moved about an establishment.  I only write to elaborate upon my experience about a restaurant that has impressed me.   A good friend of mine, who lived and studied in the UK recommended this place to me.  I, who have also lived and studied in the UK was craving a place, that reminded me of the Royal Empire - a place reminiscent of the Imperial days filled with hearty stews, fragrant dishes and Coleman's mustard.   From the clean and professional web-site, I had pre-conceived visions of white tables, with lace dolies adorning egg-shade ceramic plates with savory meat pies atop, joined with small snips of parsley for decoration.  Accompanying this presentation, would be servers dressed in white shirts with thin black ties, wearing long white aprons from waist down, quietly pouring steaming tea from stainless steel tea pots into white porcelain cups. What I was pleasantly surprised with, was that my pre-conceptions were immediately replaced with a small seating area of about 6 tables, close to a open-air kitchen with several people who were quietly working about preparing the morsels for the next day. We came to realize that the 4 of the 5 people working in the bakery/restaurant were all family members - the husband, the wife, the brother and the other brother.  We also came to find that they have been in business for 4 months and are frequently involved in selling their delicious victuals at various markets throughout the city.   We went up to the counter, and reviewed the perfectly sized menu; a menu where one can quickly determine items of interest and not spend an innordinate amount of time reviewing various options.  I place my order - Steak & Ale Pie.  My friend placed the order of the special Spinach and Goat Cheese Pie.  I ordered a Diet Rite, as I have not seen that on a menu in quite a long time or have had one to drink in decades.  The front man - as I will affectionately refer to him, was really cool/funny and was the brother of one of the owners, said that they housemade some wonderful drinks.  As a restauranteur, I very much appreciate recommendations made by restaurant owners or team.  So, I asked the front man, what would you recommend?  He said something to the affect, the ""Ginger Soda.""  I said, ""Ginger It Is.""   We proceeded to get our napkins and silverware from the self-service station in the dining room and took our seats looking out through the windows as well as the view of the plasma TV that was displaying delightful photographs of the establishment, their herb garden as well as the family members that operated Pleasant House.  I also noticed a bottle of Coleman's mustard on the self-service stand as well as a bottle of HB sauce - two of my favorites.  I noticed that the Coleman's bottle was empty and asked if they had anymore - the front man said, ""Sorry, that is the last bottle, more coming in on Monday.""  When I asked for another bottle of the Worcestershire sauce, because the one I also picked up was empty - I got the same response yelled from the kitchen - ""Sorry, that's also coming in on Monday."" What I was enamored with, was that the front man didn't take it so seriously - that is what was nice about the experience.  Very casual, geniune, no pretenses - they are who they are and are proud of it - as they should be, for we had some wonderful meat pies that were absolutely delicious without any need of condiments. In addition, the Ginger Soda drink was phenomenal.  I am not even fonf of Ginger drinks, as most them have high sugar content with only minor amounts of Ginger in them.  Pleasant House's Ginger Soda was a wonderful blend of potent finely grated/infused Ginger with just the right amount of sugar and carbonation.  After each sip, the Ginger after taste and aroma pleasantly lingered.  My Steak and Ale Pie was wonderfully rich and had a delicate crust.  The special Spinach and Goat Cheese Pie was even more savory.  The meal was moderately priced and left both of us feeling satiated.  We will definitely return. From a strategic business standpoint, Pleasant House is doing all the right things.  They are using social media to keep their patrons informed.  They are introducing their delicious victuals at various venues throughout the city.  They are also thinking about tweeting where they are going to be, so their patrons can follow them.  I believe the front man said that they were also going to go mobile with some sort of truck selling their meat pies. I wish them all the success and know that they will be incredibly successfull.  How do I know this?  Because Pleasant House reminds me of where my family's restaurant was 2 years ago and the successes that have followed since.",0.9989,0.84,0.15,0.01,0.5821076953988348

I drive through this intersection frequently so I was very confused how I could have missed an amazing new place but decided to pay better attention on my next trip to Bridgeport. I stopped last Thursday for lunch following a nearby meeting. The bakery is in the location of a former pizza place, I think.  The outside roof area has been painted yellow but the exterior just doesn't jump out at you and the name doesn't lure you inside either so I think that is why I missed it.  I was thinking ""What is a pleasant house and why should I want to find out more?""   I found out my answers once inside, which by the way was very pleasant, hehe. The owner was working behind the counter and I asked him some questions about the pasties. I decided to try to the mushroom and leek pasty because I really like leeks. I also had a piece of freshly made peach pie and homemade hibiscus soda. I sat down at one of the little tables and read the news article about the business that they had left on the counter. The name Pleasant House came from the English countryside home of the male owner's grandmother. Now the name made sense. The couple started the business to bring back simple middle class British fare using fresh local ingredients, much of which comes from their Pilsen garden. Also pretty cool.  The food and drink were fantastic. There was a sign saying that they will be opening a patio soon which will surely add to the already pleasant atmosphere.

Fast forward to last night.  My friend asked if we could walk over and give them a proper try.  I wasn't very enthusiastic about returning, but went along anyway.  It was pretty warm yesterday and as soon as we walked into the sweltering hot tiny shop, we were eyeball to eyeball with a nearly full house of diners enjoying pie and their BYO beverages.   We were greeted and had a much better experience this time as the staff patiently explained the different pie offerings on the menu.

Obviously this made the owner stressed and aggravated. No AC, no fryer, no carbonator, no credit card machine- I understand that this made for a bad day for the owner. However, he didn't seem interested in selling us any food. It took him about five minutes to even acknowledge our presence, and then he just said ""we can't do anything fried cos the dryer won't work, but we have some pies"" before going behind the counter and ignoring us for another few minutes.  When he deigned to acknowledge us again, we ordered three pies: In other words, one of every kind he had available. We had barely enough cash to cover it. However, having trekked down to Bridgeport from the north side, I was interested enough that if he'd had more pies to sell us, I would have gone to a danged ATM and gotten more cash. We sat in the small, pleasantly bright dining area and waited for our pies. They arrived quickly and were 3/3 delicious: steak&ale was reminiscent of a really really really good pot roast, the steak pasty was not the best pasty I've ever had but it was yummy, and the mushroom/leek was outta sight. Unfortunately, the experience was marred by the owner and his fawning over the table next to us. After barely acknowledging my party's presence, clearing our plates without any eye contact or a single word, he  spent at least half an hour chatting up the other group. Look, I get it. You sell English food. They're English. You want their approval. It makes emotional sense. But not fiscal. They don't live here, and they're never coming back. By alienating the locals, you could lose a lifetime of business.  The power came back on at some point while we were eating our pies.

2011-06-06,5.0,"Much like the owners fell in love with the Pleasant House estate in England, I have become enamored with Pleasant House Bakery in Bridgeport.  It has been over 10 years since I last visited England and I have spent those years missing delicious savory pies and pasties. While I understand the allure of a creamy chocolate cream pie, my salty tooth dominates and yearns for a savory pie with a flaky, buttery crust encasing meat and vegetables. Now, I don't need to hop on a plane to satiate these cravings - a simple trip to Bridgeport will suffice.  PHB specializes in savory or ""royal"" pies and pasties. We stopped in one afternoon and sampled: * Mushroom and kale pie: PHENOMENAL pie crust (so flaky!) encasing a rich, creamy mixture of mushrooms and kale. The kale reminds me of creamed spinach. I love how they've made a pie with my favorite vegetables.  * Pasty: No, this is not what you are thinking. Pasties are sort of like a British hand pie, shaped like a calzone. I believe pasties originate in Cornwall, but can be found all over England and also in the upper peninsula of Michigan. PHB only offers one pasty, and one is really all that they need (in my opinion). The all-natural steak pasty is spot on. Accompanied by potato, onions, rutabaga and spices, the filling is perfectly seasoned. Needless to say, the pasty dough is outstanding too.  * Deluxe gravy chips: Chips + gravy + cheddar cheese + skirt steak pieces. The bowl is cleaned out. Need I say more? * Crimson cooler: PHB makes 2 sodas in-house. A ginger soda and the crimson cooler, a sweet sparkling hibiscus tea. Refreshing. The owner, Art, came to talk to us and brought us a dessert plate because I tweeted at him during our meal - what a sweet gesture! The lavender shortbread was SO crumbly and buttery and we fought over the oatmeal chocolate lacy cookie. Talk to him if you see him! You'll really get a chance to see how passionate he is about this bakery. Pie maker swoon! They do a fish fry on Fridays now, which I will definitely be coming back for. In the cooler, you can also find a changing selection of specialty meats -- rashers, streaky bacon, cold pork pie. I had hoped to bring home a cold pork pie, but they were all out. Now I have even more excuses to return! Also, this place is BYOB and located next to a much talked about liquor store/bar: Maria's.

2011-05-30,4.0,"Here's a place that you should try just because of it's local sourcing model.  The Pleasant House Bakery is a product of the guys that run the Pleasant House farms - a local farm initiative that leverages abandoned parking lots in the Chicago area for farming.  Their farm is located in Bridgeport, just blockes from the bakery.  They've also partnered with a local farm from downstate Illinois for all of the meat. Don't expect much in terms of ambiance.  It's fairly news place that's been half renovated for the bakery.  Heck - there's no side outside of the door either - you'll have to ask the locals to direct you to the place.  The bakery has a unique offering - British inspired dishes that will soon satisfy any palet - but esp those from England.  We tried the Royal Pies (i.e. meat pies) - handmade savery pies with a buttery, flakey crust stuffed with one of the following: - steak and ale - all-natural beef braised with a strong British Ale, carrots, and herbs - Chicken Balti Pie (the groups favorite) - all-natural chicken in fresh ground curry spices and tomoto and Nigella seeds - Mushroom & Kale - Assorted mushrooms, kale, scallions, white wine, and herbs - Premium Pastry - all-natural steak, potato, rotabaga, onion, and spices. We also ordered the Deluxe Gravy and Chips dish with skirt steak, gravy, and cheddar cheese. This is really good. To drink, try the refreshing home made tropical teas sodas.  Really unique too - at least for me.  Also, they offer their home made meats, bangers, eggs, etc.  Really good fresh meat. I tested this place out with a British co-worker that's been in the states merely 1 year.  Let's just say he was very happy.  I thought it was just ok.  Some of the pies where a little dry for me.  But I do like the concept and you will too.

2011-05-22,4.0,"I'm about to ruin my image, all in the name of a meat pie. A buttery, flaky, filled with all types of delicious, meat pie.  In the midst of all the face melting metal on my ipod, one will find the soundtracks of several musicals. Among those, is Sweeney Todd: Demon Barber of Fleet Street. One of the songs on it is ""The Worst Pies In London"". The problem is, I've changed the words to ""the best pies in Bridgeport"". It doesn't really fit with the rest of the soundtrack. Curses! All things considered, I think I'll live with my new lyrics, as long as I get to eat delicious meat pies on a regular basis. Should be a cinch since they're walking distance from my place. Walking distance being key, since I'm sure they're using Paula Dean amounts of butter in that dough. So here's what you do. Stop next door at Maria's Packaged Goods and grab some craft beer to go. Enjoy with your classic pasty. OR, get a meat pie to go and eat at the bar next door. Either way, you've patronized two of the best spots in Bridgeport all in one trip.  Oh, and don't forget to call me.",0.8454,0.828,0.104,0.068,0.493723560390227
2011-05-21,5.0,"The most important thing to know- The deluxe fries are boss. Cheddar, gravy, and steak?! Heaven.  I went Friday night and got the fish and chips. The fish was very light and flavorful, and it came with a lovely tartar sauce. My boyfriend had the premium pasty and it was so good. The crust is so flaky! He also got an order of the deluxe chips.  Our meal on Friday was so good that we ended up going back for lunch Saturday. I got the chicken balti pasty and loved the subtle curry flavor. My boyfriend got the steak and ale. It was very comforting, like a beef stew in a sturdy pastry shell. We also tried their house made sodas. They were fabulous! Of course, we had to split an order of the deluxe chips to make it a well rounded meal. There were quite a few people there each time we visited. I am very excited for such a unique and wonderful new restaurant in Bridgeport. It is a little pricey, but oh so good. We will be back again soon.",0.9779,0.837,0.163,0.0,0.655814393939394

2011-05-20,4.0,"After a drink (or six) at Maria's Packaged Goods and Community Bar, a warm meat pie sounded very appealing.  So I rounded up a few fellow Yelpers and made the trek (approximately 15 steps) to Pleasant House Bakery. We were immediately greeted by the intoxicating aroma of baking pies. Imagine our frustration when we learned that they were sold out of all pastys and pies except for the mushroom and kale.   I was about to throw a fit when the lady behind the counter assured us that more pies would be ready in 15 minutes.  We were rewarded for our patience when we returned 20 minutes later. The original plan was to order different types of pies and share, but we all seemed to have settled on the steak and ale ($7.50).  The only option available to the vegetarian in our group was the mushroom and kale pie ($6.95).  Since she doesn't like mushrooms, she had to go hungry. If I was a vegetarian who didn't like mushrooms, I would consider not being a vegetarian. The steak and ale was very tasty.  I would have preferred the crust to be flakier and a little less hard, but the pie really hit the spot.   While at the store I noticed a plate of bangers and mash that looked very enticing too. The lady at the counter offered to upgrade my pie by putting a dollop of mashed potatoes ($1.99) on top of it but I opted to be a purist and just get the pie.  Next time I'll be trying it with the potatoes. The steak and ale pie goes great with a beer. Grab a pie and head next door to Maria's, and hope the bartenders there will be as accommodating with you as they were with us.",0.9462,0.879,0.096,0.025,0.45520833333333327
2011-05-20,5.0,"I am a sucker for the little guys. That's why I like kittens, puppies, underdogs, gnomes, Lichtenstein, our new mayor and Michael J. Fox. And small, personable, human-sized commerce.  Put the latter in a not so popular neighborhood (Bridgeport) and next to one of the greatest bars in the city (Maria's) and you are preeeeee-tty sure to get my attention. The smell escaping from the kitchen did work quite efficiently as well. The name - Pleasant House - kind of tells the tale. A small scale bakery (but it's exactly how they should be) as pleasant, cute and delicious as the house of your imaginary pastry chef grandma. There is this very distinct ""homey"" feeling about the place: no frills, chalk-written menu, bake with the flow attitude, smiling and enthusiastic people. THIS - is exactly how I like my food retailers to be. Their specialty: meat pies. Or let's say ""savory"" pies since there is a vegetarian option in the lot. Steak and ale. Curried chicken. Mushroom and kale. Pasties. Fish and chips on Friday. Home-made sides (please get the mashed potatoes and say yes to the gravy). Short, efficient and well-executed.  The steak and ale pie I savored next door with the blessing of the owner, Ed (pie eater extraordinaire and fan #1 of his oh-so-delicious-smelling neighbor) was a wonderful little doughy box filled with beef, carrots, onions and a rich unctuous sauce. The crust is intensely buttery and holds well to the filling; slightly flakier would have been better but I give them time to improve on the recipe. They opened a week ago. Patience is a virtue; I am learning it every day - the hard way. They are open until 11pm on Fridays and Saturdays - don't miss the opportunity to pop in and just enjoy. Rumor on the street is that they will open soon for brunch. Sounds like music to my ears.",0.9898,0.793,0.176,0.031,0.6083363942454854

Cousin told me to meet her there for dinner and had no idea what to expect from a ""bakery.""  Walked in to find a small menu of meat pies and pastys.  Couple of nice sides and homemade sodas.  Special of the day was a halibut fish fry that everyone seemed to enjoy. Seems like a great neighborhood establishment.  The people behind the counter and the chefs were all super nice and genuinely interested in the folks coming through the door.  Steady stream of people for the entire hour that we were there. I don't know if they actually have more bakery in the morning, but if you're looking for a change from your ""normal"" lunch or dinner, be sure to give it",0.9418,0.824,0.164,0.012,0.6449156746031747
2011-05-18,5.0,"Best Meat Pies In Chicago. And, not to be presumptuous, but I know Meat Pies. I've driven hours out of my way in rural Idaho to find towns where Cornish miners have lived searching for pasties (the meat pie kind, tho its true i've seen a fair share of the nipple covering kind also in my travels).  I have visited both pasty shops in Grass Valley California.  I've sought out a man in Calgary said to have been trained how to make Melton Mowbray Pork Pies in Leicestershire (they were okay, not awesome).   Not to mention every variant I could find while traveling around England and Ireland (yes, to my shame, I never made it to Wales, foul fate how I curse thee).  And thats not even beginning my research into what the UP'll ship to Chicago. And these are really really good Pasties. Oh, and try the deluxe chips with gravy, basically fries soaked with gravey, meat bits and cheese chunks.  Heart attack on a plate of goodness.",0.9599,0.767,0.166,0.067,0.665

2011-05-15,5.0,"During my one trip to London, I thought that English cuisine was nothing to write a Buckingham Palace postcard home about. After a few less than brilliant meals and having seen and smelled Indian food everywhere I went, I ate that instead.  Meet the Pleasant House Bakery: proving me wrong as the Brits do in fact have many a' postcard-worthy recipe while supporting my (obvious) observation that they do also love their Indian food.  My indecisiveness is bad on a good day and worse when you're picking and choosing between several delicious sounding options that will shape your first impression of a place. So here's the approach: [Salivating] Choose a pie per person (we did the crescent-shaped steak pasty and the chicken balti pie, the most Indian-influenced and the winner of the meal for me) Select a side per person (mashed potatoes and buttered peas) Let the ovens do their trick [Hunger pangs] Have a beer at Maria's next door [Ready to eat] Pick up bag Bike or walk (or maybe run) to Stearn's Quarry [Are we there yet?] Enjoy the best picnic you may have this year And then repeat. I absolutely will. I'm feeling a bit more foodie pride for my Anglo blood now.",0.9773,0.775,0.167,0.058,0.5293333333333333
2011-05-14,5.0,"Stumbled onto the Pleasant House after a gallery show in the area. Expected a bakery and found so much more. Several different savory pies -- and who doesn't like a good meat pie? -- along with a few sides. The menu isn't huge and not terribly veg friendly, but the pies were delectable. It's BYO and Maria's is right next door with a nice selection of packaged goods. They even have housemade sodas for the drivers/kiddies. No-fuss interior and even-less-fuss staff. Just good, mostly local, food well executed cleanly.",0.8462,0.744,0.159,0.097,0.5251488095238095
2011-05-11,5.0,"My friend told me about this new bakery opening on our street that sells pastys. I looked at him strangely and asked why a bakery would be selling nipple covers. Apparently ""pasties"" pronounced pay-stees is completely different from ""pastys"" pronounced pass-tees. One is a meat pie, which you would find at a British style bakery, and the other is a small adhesive applied to one's areola. It's so exciting having such a cute little bakery right down the street from me, and one that sells savory goods! I love British foods and today, i ordered the steak pasty. So delicious! Imagine a giant empanada. The crust is so flakey and buttery, and inside is potatoes and diced steak. I also got the scone with homemade strawberry jam and it was the perfect afternoon snack. The owners here are very devoted to the quality of the food they serve and make almost everything from scratch. They own a few patches of land where they grow their own vegetables that they use in their dishes. The atmosphere is like walking into a friend's  kitchen. Its so homey and welcoming, and everyone is so friendly. They even make fido bones themselves and i got one for my roommates dog. I really hope that everyone comes and tries out this place. I plan on going there often. I can't wait to try the fish fry on fridays and their other sit down meals.",0.9895,0.837,0.154,0.009,0.5080754636310192
2011-05-08,4.0,"Driving around this afternoon, trying to figure out what was new and exciting to treat my mom to, I remembered that this joint had recently opened. This long-awaited addition to the busy corner of 31st and Morgan is nestled into a small shop (formerly a burger and dog kind of place) that is right next door to the popular Maria's Packaged Goods and Community Bar. The place is completely nondescript right now, so if you're looking at Maria's it's the low gray building to the left - do not confuse this with the establishment on Morgan that has a sign for Bridgeport Pasties because that is an unrelated business that doesn't seem to have any kind of store or dining at present (I've heard it's going to be a food cart business?). Look closely and you'll see a small sign on the door for Pleasant House - don't be shy, head in. When we arrived the kitchen staff was just getting ready to serve customers, so Mom and I decided to head to the Bridgeport Coffee Company to grab some beverages while we waited a bit. Upon returning, the counter staff did a great job of letting us know what was fresh and ready to order from their menu, and what items may go well together. We wound up with the steak and ale pie, the chicken and bacon pie, an order of chips to split, and a homemade tea soda (yum, hibiscus and other goodies mixed with soda water). Our pies were delicious and very filling; the chips, which I doused in the vinegar handy on the table, were great, though I ran out of room and was unable to finish. I decided to buy something to take home for my husband to try for breakfast, and settled on the sausage rolls, which I had mistaken for being some kind of dessert turnover initially. Some small oatmeal/chocolate cookies also found their way into my bag - no idea how that happened... It should also be noted that Pleasant House also offers a nice line of house-made bath products that look and smell awesome - I'll have to check those out when I have more time. Right now the hours are still being worked on, but from what it sounded like, Mondays they're closed; Tuesday-Thursday they're open 11-9; Friday-Saturday they're open from 11-11; Sunday they're open 12-9. If I got this wrong, I am sorry, but it sounds like they're going to keeping info on hours up-to-date on their facebook, blog, and twitter accounts. Welcome to the neighborhood - this is a most delightful and welcome addition to a growing number of great places to eat, drink, and socialize in Bridgeport!",0.9924,0.845,0.131,0.024,0.562157287157287
