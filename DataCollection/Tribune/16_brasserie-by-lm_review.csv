2016-04-09,2.0,"I was excited when This restaurant first opened, as we don't have enough ""grown-up"" restaurants in the South Loop.  For awhile we stopped in fairly regularly, but then things started to go south. I think the best way to describe it was that it became very inconsistent. Sometimes you'd get a good meal and good service; the next time not. Example--I tried their croque vegetariano one day and loved it. So I brought my lunch group of six ladies, who all ordered the item. I had also raved about the french fries. Of course we got a rude server and all our fries were cold as was the be bechamel sauce on the sandwiches.  That type of thing happened way too often. So now we've stopped going.  I feel bad for the owner, but somewhere along the line she lost control.",0.7935,0.775,0.128,0.097,0.4662087912087912

I decided to order the Menu du Jour for $25...appetizer,  entrée, and dessert. How could I not?  The entrée I chose is $22 on the menu by itself!!!   A bottle of water is placed at the table, so there's no need to wait for a refill. I like that. Appetizer: MIXED GREENS SALAD with veggies and wine vinegrette is tasty.  I would order it again.  I forgot to ask for dressing on the side, so there was more dressing mixed in than I prefer, but I still enjoyed the salad. (Menu price $7) Entrée: BEEF BOURGUIGNON was superb.  Reminded me of my Grandma's roast,  potatoes, and carrots...only this was 10x better (sorry Grams).  Beef was very tende and shredded easily with my fork (no know needed),  potato puree was creamy and buttery, carrots were fresh, and the gravy/juice was flavorful.  I wonder this again for dinner tmrw!!!  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS ENTRÉE. (Menu price $22) Dessert: CHOCOLATE TART was sinful. It was rich, yet light. The powdered sugar added a nice flavor. The tart was cold but the chocolate sauce was warm.  A great ending to a wonderful dinner.  Another item I would order again.

The beef bourguignon was equally amazing with some of the most tender meat I've ever experienced. My only complaint was in the chocolate tart.

The salad mix is unique and excellent. The Boeuf Bourguignon was absolutely out of this world!! Very soft and tender and juicy like beef stew. Both rice pudding and chocolate tart were good. For the wine garlic herb mussels, they seemed to have a mix of small and big mussels with the big ones on top and the smaller ones hidden under the big ones inside the bowl. It did not have any cooked wine taste that I was expecting. Not sure the kind of wine used here. The French fries were slightly crunchy and tasted unique. The pasta Arrabiatta was good and flavorful.

My BFF and I came to Brasserie by LM for a catch up brunch and upon arrival we were greeted by...wait for it....NO ONE. We stood there for about a minute waiting for someone to acknowledge our presence. When we realize that wasn't going to happen I flagged down a lady who appeared to work there and ask if it was open seating or something because we had a reservation, but no one was manning the host/hostess desk. She just shrugged and kept walking. Annoyed at this point (3 minutes has passed now) I start staring down every waiter and waitress that I see trying to get someone to come and seat us. FINALLY a waitress comes over, asked if we have been helped (NO we respond), asked if we have a reservation (YES we respond) and then she says, ""OK"" I'll prepare a table. I thanked her and told her my stomach thanked her as well. Once we were seated we quickly ordered our food and prayed the service wouldn't continue to be crappy. Thankfully, it wasn't and our food arrived in a timely manner. The food was delicious so I highly recommend checking this place out, even though the beginning of our dining experience was less than desirable.  I recommend trying *Apple Tatin Pancakes (caramelized apple, crème chantilly, homemade pancakes, caramel sauce) - 4 stars so good, so rich, so sweet, so shareable *Croque Madame (hot ham and cheese sandwich, béchamel, Dijon mustard, fried egg) - 4 stars almost as good as the ones I ate when I lived in Paris. *Croque Vegetable (spinach, brie, caramelized onion, béchamel, Dijon mustard) - 4 stars Oh and I recommend you NOT try the apple juice as it cost $5.50!!! I mean who the hell charges that for apple juice?! If it had booze in it I would have been A OK paying that price.

The sauce was good, but the mussels themselves were pretty cold by the time they arrived at our table as were the fries, which also were way over cooked and over seasoned with cheese. Less would have been more in the case of the fries. Overall it was okay, but not great.

Ended up eating here twice for dinner, once as a couple on Sunday, and once with a big group on Friday.  Were seated right away; reservations are entirely unnecessary.  The prices can't be beat for a sit-down restaurant in the area, and the atmosphere is really very nice.  Service was gracious, if at times a bit slow and somewhat confused (had several mis-communications with our waiter the first night, so ordering felt needlessly complicated).   Some strange quirks with the food and menu:  asked what their vegetable du jour was and told that they don't have one (?!) although it's listed on the menu.  Everything was *just* a little bland; the soups esp. could have used more depth (sampled both lentil and onion).  Had moules-frites the first visit:  was reasonably good and v. hefty portion; the bowl was too deep, so I couldn't get at the sauce until I'd had a third of the mussels, which was frustrating.  There was a little grit in the mussels, but they didn't taste fishy or anything, so I think they were good and fresh.  Fries were very tasty (maybe a bit over-cheesed) and very plentiful in quantity.  Second visit had the vegetarian croque, and once again:  it was fine, but lacked depth of flavor... tasted like basic bread with cheese on it.  Both nights my partner got the spinach salad (slightly over-dressed) with salmon (very well done!).  Their basic green salad looks excellent! Overall:  I would neither seek out, nor avoid this place.  Incredibly good deal for the location and ambiance; I wish they'd punch up the food a bit.  Seems the management is really making an effort to improve everything, so I have hopes!   (P.S.  On that note, would love to see a non-French white wine on the by-the-glass menu--the California sauvignon blanc was a delight!)",0.9931,0.832,0.153,0.015,0.42506613756613754

Their menu is woefully inaccurate.  I saw a 312 on draft and ordered it.  Immediately, the server told me they didn't have 312 and told me as if they never had it in the first place.  Fine, but what restaurant in Chicago DOESN""T have 312??  Anyway I ordered a Sofie instead and the server came back to me and told me they were out...so now it looks like they don't keep a decent stock of drinks at their bar.  The upside though is I got a summer lizard wit beer which was fantastic.  Next, the food.  I ordered a pasta with chicken dish.  The pasta was overcooked, the sauce was bland and the chicken was shredded and tasted like it's been in a freezer for days. It was mushy, grainy and it was like chewing on wet carpet.  I was very disappointed with the entre I got and although I do not eat French-type food often, this would not make the cut in Chicago, Paris, or Buffalo NY for that matter.

I opted for the croque madame!!!! DO get this! i am uploading a photo of this too, but it was the perfect warm, juicy and burst of flavor in every bite. the cheese and ham was so good, and crispy perfection on the crust. the runny egg on top was the cherry on top! both came with a side of potato chips (thick) and it was so good too, sad I couldnt finish mine since I was so full!  if you are seeking brunch, DO GO if you are here on weekends.",0.9954,0.726,0.23,0.045,0.6059178743961352

The problem was when the service started, which was mystifyingly poor.  First, the hostess - who never smiled in our presence - walked up without comment or explanation and took our placemats away.  Every other table and every other patron in the place had placemats, but suddenly we didn't.  Why? I don't know. Even the little kids eating outside had placemats, but suddenly and without warning we were not worthy of placemats.   I got the benedict, which was clearly made with pride and accompanied by fried potatoes which could not have been any better.  I did not love their take on the hollandaise, but that's a small point of personal preference, because my food was obviously very high quality. My companion ordered eggs over medium and bacon.  What arrived was scrambled eggs and sausage... and after the food arrived we didn't see another employee - AT ALL - until the check came 30 minutes later (definitely did not see the unsmiling hostess who took our placemats), giving us no opportunity to ask them to correct their mistake.  All told, the ambiance and the quality of the food in no way compensated for the inattentive service.  Really disappointing to see such care put into the building and the cooking, and no care put into the patrons.",0.8211,0.753,0.143,0.105,0.4718126984126984

And when I say delicious, mouth is watering just thinking about my sunny side up eggs and sausages. Anywho, I was seated next to the big wall near the bar. My purse was hanging on the back of my chair NEXT to the wall. I NEVER got up, once. Our waiter seemed pretty cool, at some point he ended up leaving during our meal because it was the end of his shift.  I had taken my ID out of my wallet (in my purse) for our mimosa brunch and was putting it back in after maybe 45min/an hour? In this time period, I never got up from my chair. I went to put my ID back in my wallet and my wallet was gone. I initially was in disbelief because something like that has not ever happened to me, so it was a bit shocking. I decided to be mature and understanding and calmly asked the waiters if they had found a wallet, they said no. Then I decided ok I guess it was stolen. I told them that my wallet had been stolen but didn't understand how because I had never gotten up from my chair and I was sitting a considerably far distance from other people. The only people who came by my table and me were the bus boys who put down our plates and picked them back up and our two waiters. They immediately asked me if I was sure that I didn't get up from my chair. Then proceeded to ask me if I even brought my wallet..at this point my sister was furious that they tried to make me look like a fool.  Once we realized it could have been someone apart of the restaurant staff, we told them. The managers both vouched for the waiter, stating he'd been here for three years and he didn't need to steal. I don't know what that means, but ok. They kept lying for the waiter and said he was in the back doing some things, but when my sister kept insisting on speaking to him, he had miraculously left (a while ago).  At the end of it all, I had cancelled all my credit cards and had no money whatsoever with me. This was a Saturday and the banks had just closed an hour prior. You would think they would comp my meal, but they sent me my check with no apologies or anything.  It disappoints me to have to write this, because the food was amazing. But the way everything was handled was very irresponsible and I'm sure the restaurant owners wouldn't want any customer to feel the way we did: dissatisfied and disappointed. At the end of the day, the customer is the most important person. The least they could have done is comp-ed my meal.

We stopped in for a quick brunch before hitting the road, since it was so close to our hotel, and we were very disappointed. Our first red flag should have been that there were only a couple of tables of people at 10:30 AM. The service was horrible and the food was close behind, at least what I ordered. We were seated relatively quick, then sat there for several minutes before anyone even came over to take our beverage order. We actually were about to send someone up to the bar to place an order for some Bloody Mary's when our server arrived. He seemed very uncomfortable and confused, one of the most awkward servers I've ever had. He filled our coffees (a hefty $3.50 for coffee) and took our drink order, then said he would be right back with some cream for our coffee. He never brought it, so we went up to the bar to get some ourselves. By this time, we kind of figured out the service wasn't that great. So when our server brought our drinks, we told him we wanted to order right away. He reluctantly took our order. I then took my first sip of my Bloody Mary, which was awful. The worst Bloody I've ever had  (not what I expected for $8). When our food came out, I obviously chose the wrong thing to order. Everyone else got a Croque, which looked delightful. I ordered the beef hash and it came out looking more like beef stew, there was so much water in the skillet. There was no flavor to it at all. The only good part was the egg on top (after some salt and pepper). I was left wondering how I paid $11 for such an unimpressive meal. The bus boy kept hovering around us, basically watching for when he could grab our plates. About 10 minutes after we were done, we had to flag down our server to ask him for our bill, as we were in a hurry. He said ok, then went to the table of 8 next to us to take their order. BEFORE bringing our bill, which we asked for. He brought out one bill with everything on it. So we sent someone to go find him and asked to have him split it up. He seemed confused by our request.

It was a hot day and the place had outdoor seating in the shade so we were sold. However I should have known something was up as it was lunch time and the place was empty save for 2 tables who had just left.  The servers here hate their lives. Not sure what kind of internal drama is going on here but all the servers, hosts or bussers I encountered were VERY unprofessional. First thing when we walk in and approach the first host she just looks at us and walks away. A host had an exchange with another employee and,said ""You help them"" and after a look was exchanged between them we were taken outside to our table. The bar menu looked great and we were excited to order but it took 10-15 minutes for a server (different employee) to come back. Once we ordered we were left alone for a good 20-30 minutes before getting our drinks. I'm not sure what the hold up was as I said inside the place was empty. However in the meantime I did get the crap scared out of me when I look over and a busser was cleaning the inside window and just starring at us. Even my friend said it was weird. Finally we get our drinks and they aren't very good at all. I'm not hard to please when it comes to alcohol but the lavender and cucumber drinks we ordered tasted like they had been mixed completely wrong. But like I said it was alcohol and I wasn't about to waste it so me and my friend chugged them and decided it would be our last. This is where it really starts to get weird. Then a busser comes outside to bus tables and ask us how long the tables have been gone without being bussed. They were empty/people were leaving when we got there which had been over an hour by then and we told him so. He then proceeds to swear and murmur under his breath and storms back inside.

Was lured into the Brasserie on a Tuesday, drawn by the promise of bottomless mussels.  Not finding ""bottomless mussels"" on the menu, decided to order the standard serving of moules frites with white wine/herb broth, for $13. The broth was truly excellent.  Rich, flavorful, and not excessively sour as other mussel purveyors tend to offer, the white wine/herb broth was worth the price of admission. Unfortunately, that's where the good luck ended.  While the broth was good, there was precious little of it - while Chicago competitors such as the Publican, or my NYC go-to Le Parisien (Kips Bay, Manhattan) offer at least second-knuckle quantities to be slurped up, no such luck here.  Further, the smallish mussels were greatly overcooked, so much so that the outer ring of flesh was often fused to the shell.  For shame. The coup de grâce was the cooked-stiff fries.  While they looked rather appetizing covered in cheese and herbs, each bite required concentrated chewing to soften the potato staff, then to swallow.  How does a French place botch frites?  Outrageous. So against my better nature, I declined the second bowl (two bowls = bottomless???) of mussels and decided that my time would be better spent gawking at Sue the T-Rex.  Because her fossilized bones were probably softer than the fries.  (Heya!)",0.973,0.796,0.148,0.056,0.4491071428571428

She didn't know the menu or the specials; she was slow and inattentive. On top of that, after speaking with a manager, she was supposed to notify us that because we were a group of 5, we would be charged the (illegal!!!) added gratuity, but she didn't. The food overall was alright. I ordered the prefixe menu which included soup or salad, beef bourguignon or a chicken dish and dessert. I went with the salad and the beef bourguignon. It tasty, but the portions were smaller than I expected. For dessert I ordered some chocolate tarte-ish thing. The whole meal was actually very unmemorable. We ate on the patio, which was nice, but kind of cramped. People walking behind me kept bumping my chair and it got a little cooler than we would have liked, but that was on us (darn Chicago weather!). Oh and this kind of relates to the restaurant, but the bathroom (which actually is outside in the hotel lobby) was being cleaned while we ate here and I wanted to use the bathroom, so I knocked and tried to ask the man when he would be done.

2015-05-26,3.0,"If you go to Brasserie's website, they will happily provide a near-dictionary definition of 'brasserie.' They do not tell you who or what LM is, but I bet you can figure that out. That inconsistently accommodating approach may as well be the theme for the restaurant, which is almost apologetically French: relying on easy cognates where they can and eagerly translating the rest, but neglecting to inform whether you should, for example, wait to be seated. I'm referring obliquely to the overall service, of course, which has been touched on quite a few times in other reviews. And like I've intoned, the service was rough, inconsistent, and apologetic. Maybe the sheer steadfastness of owner responses here on Yelp can give you some idea of how apologetic they can be. The waitstaff seemed kind, but outnumbered. The food was fine; nothing unique in my experience, but the pricing is also generally modest, so there are few real surprises. The french fries were floppy and somewhat undercooked, which is a bizarre disappointment for a style of restaurant partially defined by steak frites. Clumps of what looked like Parmesan cheese were sprinkled over the fries, but didn't seem to lend anything other than visual interest. The beer selection is adequate, albeit unexpectedly constrained for the location's namesake (brassiere is the French word for 'brewery'). The decor is pretty funny, if you're in the right mood. It's ""French"" in the goofiest and most superficial sense -- my favorite aspect was the enormous black and white photo of the Eiffel tower (labeled ""la tour Eiffel,' helpfully), but that's just a prime example of the photo kitsch that breaks up otherwise solid reds and browns. It's a warm high-ceilinged cafe environment that just comes off a little gift shop-esque. The music is dreary dad rock hits, which is probably preferable to something more stereotypically and garishly Parisian. So: if you choose to patronize the Brassiere by LM, expect to get essentially the food that you pay for, expect to be sort of bored by the decor, and expect that you may need to be patient with the service.",0.9869,0.811,0.137,0.052,0.500915750915751
2015-05-21,2.0,"We ate here for dinner, and it was well below mediocre. I would give 1.5 stars if that was an option. We were staying upstairs, so it was convenient, but the food was bad and the service was worse. Now that I'm reading other reviews, this is a common theme. Great service makes mediocre food seem much better, and it's pretty easy to fix. 6 of us (2 kids) were sat at a table in the back. Waters were poured. It appeared that our server may have been in training, as every time he approached our table the manager hovered behind him. She seemed to be telling him what to do, but never actually helped him to catch up.  One of us ordered a drink, and the rest of us were not offered anything but water. It took 10+ minutes for someone to return with one beer and take our food (and remainder of drink) order. Several minutes after this, two more drinks came - the third never did arrive. It was only a soda, and she gave up.  Appetizers all came together, along with the kids' food. None of our food was brought by our server, and everything was auctioned at tableside. My husband was surprised at the charcuterie plate, because he had ordered it the previous afternoon while I was in a meeting, and said it had five different meats. Today it had three. Both that and the fromage were fine - not exciting, not bad, but less than he received the previous day which was odd.  When our server came by, I asked for another glass of wine and our friend another beer. Several minutes later the manager came to the table to tell us our drinks would arrive ""soon"". Why she didn't bring them to us, I will never know. Several more minutes passed before our server finally emerged from the kitchen and made it to the bar.  Our children had had a long day, and my son was fading fast. As our dinner had not yet arrived, my husband asked me to box his up so he could take our boy upstairs. When the runner attempted to auction a sandwich, we didn't know whose it was. I thought my husband had ordered the ""bratwurst dinner,"" but I wasn't sure it didn't come on bread so I accepted it for him. When I brought it to him, of course it wasn't what he had ordered.  My mussels were terrible. Strongly fishy, and the wine in the sauce hadn't been cooked off all the way. Our friend's steak was half gristle so he ate my fries. When we asked for our check, the manager asked if we had enjoyed our meal. I said, ""parts of it,"" and she didn't ask me to elaborate - just walked off. This was one of the worst meals any of us had had in a long time, and I'm pretty disappointed that we wasted one of our few nights here on food and service that were both so bad.

2015-05-18,2.0,"""Meh. I've experience better"" sums my wife and I's dinner last Friday night. We walked in and were seated promptly. The host was at his station and there was no wait, the place was maybe half full. That is when we discovered the Yelp reviews were pretty on-point. The server came, saw we had no water and left saying she'd get us some (no biggie). Then we waited, but not too long. Our server returned with a bottle of water and took our drink order, one beer. Then we waited. And waited some more. Until one of the other servers came to us and took our drink and entree orders (I guess the drink order was never placed). After the 2nd server took our order, the drink came immediately. Our wait for food wasn't too long either, but the food really wasn't anything special. I had mussels & fries and my wife had braised chicken & shells pasta. The mussels were okay, nothing special but decent food for the price (the fries were outstanding though). My wife's pasta was cooked well but under seasoned and we found a small bone and some cartilage mixed in with the chicken. After eating, we waited. And waited. And waited. Finally, we asked for the check and received it immediately. Upon inspection of the check, I found the price of the braised chicken & pasta was $16. The website and, I thought, the menu stated it was $14. I hope this was just a price change that wasn't updated, but after the service my conspiracy theorist mind started to think it was done on purpose (which I doubt and hope is not true). Anyway, the service is slow but it appears that all you have to do is flag down a server and they'll bring you what you want expeditiously (not that the customer should need to, but it seemed to work). The food was underwhelming but the prices aren't outrageous (that extra $2 aside). I might give it another chance as I live in the neighborhood and might want to try and prove my theory about the service. Otherwise, if you're in a hurry this may not be the place for you. If you have a lot of time to kill, get some ""frites"" and maybe order your drinks two at a time.",0.3828,0.868,0.073,0.059,0.5010582010582011

However, the restaurant was barely at 50% capacity, so I have a hard time feeling understanding.  It started when we walked through the door and were greeted by a server enter a bill/order who made no facial contact and barked at us to walk to down the hall to a host.

We then ordered what we thought would be best and were brought a wrong wine. He went back to try a different one and I'm still not convinced it was the one we had ordered. The waiter did not know how to open a bottle of wine. He provided some excuse for why he could not open it, but had simply not turned the opener far enough. He left for a few minutes and came back to try again. When he finally got it open, he poured two very full glasses without offering any tasting. Oh, and he brought two separate sized glasses -- one for white, one for red. It was 30 minutes before we even had wine at our table. Our food came out relatively quickly; none of our courses were cleared before the next arrived. We were asked if we were done while clearly midway through our meal. Our waiter was unprofessional and yelled at one point about a table across from us that hadn't received dessert.

He let us enjoy our food, but made sure we were never left wanting. He gave us great recommendations and pointed out all the specials. He was so happy, it was obvious we were not an inconvenience and he enjoyed doing what he was doing.

The restaurant is conveniently connected to the hotel that we stayed in. I am glad we took a chance because the staff and food were excellent. The ambiance was simple, but hip.   I like the wall decorations and the french music being played.  My hubby and I were also happy to find out they were a part of the Chicago downtown dining week.  Needless to say, we tried their lunch downtown dining week menu. We had the lobster bisque for starters. The soup did not look appetizing, but it tasted great. The taste actually reminded me of crab more than lobster. The soup did have a big chunk of crab meat in the middle. Next, my hubby ordered the short ribs. The plate did not look appetizing again, but it was tender and well seasoned. He was happy with his meal. I ordered the salmon with a dried apricot and green salad on top. It looked very appealing and the salmon was cooked well. I pretty much licked off my plate. Finally, we had a chocolate pot de Creme dessert with a beignet. I love desserts and this did not disappoint. I even liked the presentation.  The service was great too. Many of the customers were sitting more close to the window and the bar. The servers did not forget about us even when we decided to seat in the back with the booth. One of the servers saw us using our phones and iPad and offered the wifi password. My only concern was when we walked in, there was no host. I wasn't sure if we had to wait to be seated or we should find our own table. In the end, the servers kindly told us that we can chose our own table. Overall, we were happy with the food and service",0.9958,0.798,0.179,0.023,0.5774007936507937

Our intention was to go to the Bongo Room in the South Loop but we walked past this place and the sun was calling our names. Like all the other reviewers said, the service here is terrible. Our friend ordered coffee right away and she didn't get it until half way through our meal (and they still charged her full price even though that's one of those free refill things and she missed out on a lot of coffee drinking time). We tried to flag down our server multiple times to get her the coffee but she seemed to be intentionally avoiding eye contact. I had the LM Eggs Benedict - 3 stars. I love eggs benedict but there was nothing unique about these and they were missing a depth of flavors. My hubby had a burger and it was also just okay. They do have the $25 bottomless Mimosa special and most of the entrees are about $12, so that essentially equates to $13 for bottomless Mimosas. We entertained the idea but the service was so bad we knew we wouldn't get our money's worth out of the bottomless Mimosa so we stuck to water.

There seemed to be only two people working at the time, and finally when we had someone tell us to choose our seat they had a very nasty attitude.

The wait for the food was very very very long when we were told it would take no more than 9 minutes.  Overall, the food was delicious.

The food didn't come for another 10-20 minutes and when it finally did much of it was lukewarm.  My potatoes were under-cooked and my omelet was cold after about a minute.  Everyone else had a similar experience with their food.  We didn't see our waiter again until near the end of the meal (coffee and water empty for most of it). At one point we flagged down a busboy to ask for some hot sauce.  He told us okay and that was the last we saw of him. The place looks nice, and I imagine if the food was hot and cooked properly it'd be pretty good.  Our server (which seems to be a common problem these days), just didn't seem care.  He did, however, visit the table behind us with the two attractive woman in their 30's several times, walking past us every time without noticing our empty glasses.",0.8995,0.866,0.083,0.051,0.5041666666666668
2014-09-03,2.0,"I've been patronizing this restaurant loyally since it opened, and have actually frequented this location since 1987 when it was operating under a different name entirely. Of course, as Brasserie, it is currently enjoying it's best incarnation.  The food is superlative, the service is generally attentive and I come here at least bi-weekly for dinner, cocktails (or both) and on weekends for brunch and the bottomless mimosas. The mixologist is about the best in this neighborhood, plain and simple. One thing that recently gave me pause, however, was Sunday July 20th, when I invited a guest to meet me here for brunch.  I live just two blocks away, so it's often my first choice given the usually exhaustive weekend lines/waiting at Yolk restaurant, situated next-door to my apartment building. I walked into Brasserie that morning at around 11:00 a.m., and stepped up to the hostess' desk to check-in and secure a table for two. The woman at the desk looked up from her seating chart, pointed her finger up into the air as if to gesture ""One moment,"" walked to the back/kitchen area and never returned. She didn't greet me civilly or say anything at all to me verbally. Five minutes went by, then ten, then 15 and finally 20 minutes without a single word from anyone. By then, the line of people waiting behind me had grown to about 12. Wait staff strangely began the tactic of coming up and greeting white people in line behind me--as if I were invisible or something--and seating their parties. Those who didn't get seated right away, at least had information. Yes, there were two marathons going on in downtown Chicago that morning, and everybody and their mother had the same big idea of having breakfast on Michigan Ave.  It was frightfully busy, and confusing, and I get that. Even so, I was just hoping for a single table on a sunny Sunday morning, at a place I have come to for decades. That shouldn't be too much of a stretch.  The inside was pretty full, but there were about four tables available outside on the sidewalk. Staff virtually broke their necks to quickly accommodate the marathoners, and the predominantly white hotel guests spilling in the front and side doors from the Essex and Hilton Hotels, but looked right through me, the first person in line. After that 20 minutes with my jaw on the ground, I pulled out my smartphone, searched for another nearby restaurant and walked out.

What's better than bottomless mimosas after an exhausting day of racing and spectating in the scorching summer sun? We got the $25 bottomless mimosa deal again. That is a sweet deal that comes with a brunch entree. The only reason NOT to get this deal is if you don't imbibe. We've decided that our minimum is three mimosas at Brasserie By LM. Once again, we were seated right away in the bar area and we had a fabulous server. No problems in that department either time. My friends and I all ordered different foods than last time.

Obviously the service was exceptionally attentive and friendly this time around, and the food was also quite good. We got the cheese plate and the charcuterie to start - both were lovely. Absolutely recommend. For entrees we got the chicken, which was great. The corn purée that came with it was exceptional, as was the macaroni. Also got the beef bourguignon which was delicious. The steak frites and the fish du jour were good not as good as the other dishes. For dessert, the chocolate mousse was lovely and light, and the bread pudding and creme brûlée were good.

2014-07-07,3.0,"Many of the other reviews about this place were right. There was no hostess when we walked in and when she came, she was surly and unwelcoming. Although it was not crowded (3 groups outside, 3 inside) and there was ample staff (at least three waitresses that I saw, plus two bus boys) no one came to take our drink order for well over ten minutes. We gave our drinks order at the same time as our entree order and told the waitress to bring things as they were ready. We got a basket of really good, hot, French bread (being half French, bread is very important to me). Then we waited. My husband got his soup, and we had another long wait. In the meantime, the waitress never came by to refill our water, or check on us in any way. Finally some of our food came - and they brought us two orders of boeuf bourguignon and one order of mussels when it was supposed to be the other way around. We told the busboy and he said he would tell the waitress...and a while later she came by and asked how our meal was. My husband still did not have his sausages and my eldest son did not have his mussels, so she have been able to tell from looking that things were not ok.  After we told her we were missing food, she said she would check...and she never came back. Ten minutes later the manager came by and asked how things were. He immediately went to check on our order, which apparently the waitress had not done because he said he put the order in and had it expedited. The boeuf was good but more like a pot roast than actual boeuf bourguignon. There was no burgundy in the sauce. My sons enjoyed their mussels and my husband's sausage - which showed up after I had finished my dinner - was good. We had creme brulee for dessert, which was quite good although the custard was cold while the sugar crust was warm.  Our waitress, after messing up our order and ignoring us for most of the meal - we asked her for more bread three times, and only got it when we asked the manager - had the gall to add an 18% tip to our bill, which is typically only done for large parties. I suspect her poor service skills has been resulting in lower tips than she felt she deserved, so she has resorted to this tactic. The food is good, the new manager is trying hard to make the place run better, and the waitstaff is lazy, disorganized, and surly. Don't eat there if you don't have ample time, but the food is worth the wait.",0.9343,0.855,0.084,0.06,0.45171476671476674
2014-07-07,1.0,"Very disappointed with Brasserie by LM. Came across their very cute outdoor space and thought had hit on a winner.  The menu was simple but looked interesting. First disappointment was the Bloody Mary which just tasted bottled and off. Then our waiter did not know what a bellini was but said he would ask the bartender. He returned with a glass of sparkling wine of some sort and said ""We do have bellinis"" with a smile...to be fair he replaced it free of charge for a different drink. The croque vegetarian was greasy and the spinach really looked like it came from a can...that particular green colour cant be hidden. The croque monsieur was equally greasy and disappointing. Highlight was the coffee which was good quality.  Would never return sadly.",0.9289,0.708,0.196,0.095,0.5823412698412698
2014-06-26,1.0,"This place was so bad that I joined yelp to write this review.  I was there with my girlfriend a few weeks back and  it was likely the worst dining experience I have ever had in Chicago. It was a Tuesday night, they were pretty empty (maybe two or three other tables were occupied).  We were seated right away. Waited about 20 minutes before a server came to tell us they would be right back. Water came 10-15 minutes later. Apparently there was a there was a party of 8-9 people and the servers were rushing to get that party's table prepared. After about 45 minutes our server came by to take our drink order. We were starving at this point so we ordered drinks, appetizers and our entrees. Tuesdays are ""all you can eat mussels night"" so I ordered that for my entree. Shortly after we ordered our food. The party of 8-9 people showed up and the service just got worse from there.  Before the ""big"" party arrived our server would at least come by to make excuses. After the party arrived our server was re-assigned to that table and we did not have a server assigned to our table. We were not drunk (we had not been served yet) nor did we complain -- there wasn't anyone really to complain too.  Our drinks came by about 15 minutes after we placed our order. We would have ordered more drinks if we had a chance. After our initial glass of water our water glasses were empty for the rest of the evening. We never got our appetizers and we had been there for 2 hours when our food finally arrived.  The mussels were okay (that was the highlight) but I did not dare ask for a second plate considering how it took about an hour to get the first one.  The LOW POINT in the evening was when someone (manager or owner) came by to talk with the ""big party"" and make sure they had what they needed. We tried to get his attention but he was in a hurry and said he would be right back. He never came. It took 20 minutes to get our check after asking and, yes, we were charged for our appetizers. Instead of waiting for them to fix our bill I left enough cash to cover our bill (+ $10 for our ghost server) on the table and we went to 5 guys for a burger.  This place is the worst.

We ordered the first burger and it was well done, medium at best which was fine but by the third bite, just a little too difficult to handle.  My son spoke with the waiter who brought out the manager, and they took it back, happily I might add.  The second burger came out EXACTLY the same, medium to well.  At this point, we were....shall we say, a bit surprised...  We pointed this out to the waiter and the manager reappeared, kindly apologizing.  My son was honestly looking for a medium rare burger and not trying to cause trouble(!).  The manager brought out a THIRD burger, and...... it was exquisite.   The surprising part of the entire experience is that I at least wanted to make sure we covered some of the bill, but LM INSISTED that they cover it.  Kudos to the manager and LM for FINALLY a) serving a GREAT burger, b) for amazing service, and c) for some of the best fries in Chicago!",0.9954,0.762,0.216,0.022,0.5460826210826211

I grabbed Angela who returned them to the kitchen & returned with a full bowl of Mussels. She even commented about the size of this portion. I had to asked twice for bread.

2014-05-08,1.0,"I know there's a lot of good reviews here, so maybe I caught them on an off day.  It was 2pm on a Thursday, not peak dining time, which is why I figured they'd be attentive and the kitchen would be reasonably quick.  Wow, was I wrong. I'm first and foremost a foodie, so we'll get to the service later.  It takes a lot for me to give one star, and this place earned it on the food alone.  For what they charge, and the image they project, I shouldn't have to salt the egg on top of my salad Lyonnaise or scrape copious amounts of cheese from my Croque Monsieur.  It started with a plate of charcuterie, hard to mess up right?  The toasted baguette that came with it had obviously been toasted the day before because it was cold and dry but only barely toasted (more stale than anything) and the watercress was wilted.  Not just a little bit, it was sloppy enough that it had absolutely no crunch.  The meats were passable. Onto the salad, classic Lyonnaise.  Frisee with lardons, fingerling potatoes and a fried egg, all swimming in a moat of vinaigrette.  If you put enough dressing on frisee to make it wilt, you've gone well beyond what's necessary for human consumption.  Granted the dressing was really good, but it was all you tasted.  Which brings up the issue of the egg and potatoes.  Clearly not seasoned, at all, period.  Have you ever eaten a fried egg without salt or pepper on it?  I defy you to do it and declare that you enjoyed it.  Same goes for potatoes, without salt they shouldn't even be on the plate.  Sigh, where is Parc when you need it? Last, the Croque Monsieur.  How do you mess up a ham and cheese sandwich?  Easy, saturate the bread in butter, top it with three times more cheese than it needs and then don't leave it under the broiler long enough to actually melt it.  When I cut into the sandwich, butter squeezed out from under the bread.  Why do you hate me, God?  Why must I suffer this abomination of cheese?  I've never done anything to deserve this (except that time in Vegas, but you swore you would't bring that up anymore). So, did they manage to redeem themselves with their service?  Sadly, no. There were five tables including me.  Five.  One, two, three, four and five.  How then does it take you ten minutes to bring me water and take my drink order?  How does it take half an hour (half an hour!!!) to bring me my check?  The only thing they did right, and I'm a stickler for this so I have to give them kudos, is they kept my iced tea full the whole time.  Thank God for small miracles. I'll cut a place some slack if they've got good prices, or they're in a crappy neighborhood.  This place cost me $40 for lunch and is right on Michigan Ave, so I'm not pulling any punches.  Lots of people like this place, but be warned that your highly anticipated outing to Brasserie By LM may fall flat on its face.",0.8601,0.833,0.092,0.074,0.5052335164835164

The food was delicious as always, and I had a glass of the 2009 Bordeaux, which was good.  I still wish the portions were larger.  I received a tablespoon of mashed potatoes and a tiny piece of meat that had large sections of fat and my date had to order two entrees.  We both ordered desert.  My crème brulee was different from any other crème brulee that I've ever had.  The bruleed part was thicker than usual and tasted very toasted (a little burnt).  What was surprising was that the custard tasted like marshmallow!  So together, the custard with the burnt sugar, tasted like a roasted marshmallow!  Not what I expected, but definitely tasty.  I didn't eat all of the bruleed part because the taste was too overpowering for the mild custard, and I wish there was more custard. Service-wise, it took a while for the waiter to take our order but after that the staff was very attentive.  Also, I asked the waitress what time the restaurant closes and she said 9pm.  When I left I saw that the sign on the window says 10:30pm.  It's unfortunate that we were told that the restaurant was about to close because we would have stayed and had another drink.  Overall though, a pretty pleasant experience and I will most likely be going back.  I love the convenient location, the consistently good food, and now the ambience!",0.9883,0.85,0.134,0.016,0.5586834733893559

Even slow to bring drinks.... But then  things picked up.  Our food was awesome! When the waitress did pay attention to us, she was chatty. Same w the manahaer who later brought us complimentary creme brulee, a yummy and classy touch.  The kitchen was good about spacing our food, we ordered 3 items to share. French onion soup was great, as was beef bergoirion.  Mussels w bacon were just ok, warm French bread was delicious.  $5 martini specials were also great!  I would definitely return, cute and trendy atmosphere and good view of Mich Ave.  Only wish they would have had a little better service at start of our meal, quicker  drinks/greeting and bread service.  We will definitely go again! So... after having a redeemed visit previously to LM, I bought another groupon to igve it another try.  We love the SouthLoop and I""m always encouraging local restaurants.  So we wanted to try it again.   I made reservations, and they called to confirm. great.  But I should have been warned when I showed up at 7 pm (Granted it was Valnetines day, but hey if its your busiest night of the year, then you gear up) We show up and as before, they had a terrible time checking people in. The restaurnat was somewhat busy however there were tons of people milling about.  Seeing as there were many 2 tops in front of us, instead of the receptionist shwoign us to one of the many open availalbe tables, she was instructing people to wait in the hotel lobby citing they needed to 'clean tables'.  Um the tables were all cleaned?  Then they all seemed super flustered as they couldnt' find peopel to seat them.  The hostess and the manager both seemed in way over their heads.  I haven't been in the restaurant industry in over 10 years, but I could have sat people faster.  Instead they appeared to check us into the computer, and then a paper list (ummm 2 lists not necessary) instead just show people to 2 tops?  I get when you have a big party, however it would be much easier to get people seated and pass out some comp champagne?  Instead a whole group of us all milled around the restaurant for 20 min at least nad it appeared to be a huge CLUSTER. So we were finally seated, and it took 5 min for  anyone to even bring us water?  Finally the server came over to us and said we couldn't use our groupon (which would have saved us $15 i mean come on, not a big deal in the grand scheme of things) so he brought over the manager... and  honestly overall we were just handled in such a way that I was really discouraged.  They said they had a special menu so wouldn't honor it (fine nbd) but then you need to advertise this as they mentioned (this was happening all night).  after that i just could see that this restaurant was still in cluster a state and as we aren't Vday people we decided we didn't feel like spending 3 hours there, and walked a few blocks to our fav sushi/ thai place (shout out to MA&I!) where they easily found a table for us and had great service.  I want LM bistro to succeed but honestly - up your service people.  water+ bread and offer of drinks within 2 min of people seating is a no brainer.  as your bus boy can bring water and bread!  And as for greeting folks ? that should be within 1 min of them entering the restaurant and seated immediately.  And if your restaurant can't handle the overflow on a busy night you need a better back up plan.  Shooing people off to the hotel isn't a great idea.   The food here is good and the atmosphere is pretty cute too... However they really need to figure out the service here.  In my book they are 2 strikes and they are out.  I'm really reluctant to give them another try when there are so many other local places in the neighborhood that are much more friendly.",0.9987,0.78,0.181,0.04,0.5272704081632653

A few of us had the butternut squash soup. The taste was really good, but it was warm...not hot. My husband enjoyed the duck confit salad. As entree I had the salmon with mussels. The salmon was like any other salmon, but the unique part is that it's topped with muscles and the sauce was really good. It was delicious that I ended up eating the sauce at the end. Portions are smaller than what you are paying for, but it is filling enough if you have appetizer and dessert. A friend of mine ordered their burger and he said it was decent.. he enjoyed the pretzel bun. Two of my friends ordered their chicken..it's suppose to have a hint of apple but they didn't taste it. My husband ordered the short ribs which we both thought was good. Another friend ordered their beef stew like dish. She thought it was okay. For dessert, few of us ended with the chocolate cake..which was okay. I had the dessert that's like a donut with ice cream inside drizzled with caramelized banana. sauce. The sauce was good..the donut and ice cream was okay..I preferred eating the ice cream and banana sauce together.  We thought the food was decent as I mentioned, but the reason I am giving a 3 is because the service was terrible. It was either they were understaffed for V-day or their servers just weren't up to par. It took forever for our food to be served...no one came to check up on us... we had to keep asking to refill our water because it just wasn't enough for our table. It took us a long while before we got our bill - we were even kidding that we could easily walk out and not pay and they wouldn't even notice. One of the staff said they would come back to clean up the remaining plates on the table, but that took over 10 minutes for them to return.. When we asked for separate check, the waiter was confused even after we pointed out who should be in one tab, this tab, etc, and he ended up pointing at the wrong couple over and over again, so we just decided to stick with one tab and we'll figure it out. Maybe that was his trick to make us all put it on one tab, just so we don't have to keep explaining. Well whatever that was, it worked.",0.9972,0.816,0.157,0.027,0.5403061224489795

So glad we did, as it was excellent. We started with lobster bisque which was rich, silky, and savory. They also brought out a bread basket and a jug of water for the table. For the main dish my husband got sea bass and I got the hanger steak with hand cut French fries. My steak is where they lost a star from me. I asked for medium well and it was burnt to a crisp. The carmalized onions on top were the saving grace however, so it didn't completely ruin the meal for me. Creme brûlée is what won us both over. It was perfect and studded with vanilla beans. I also ordered a drink there called the stratosphere which I highly recommend. It is very fruity, smooth, and just a little sweet made with sparkling wine and creme de cassis.

2013-12-22,1.0,"Honestly my worst experience ever at any restaurant in my life. Food was good, but the service was enough to make me vomit. Doesn't honor reservations, even when there are empty tables. Doesn't honor guests' requests for plates for bread, or for glasses for bottled beer. Doesn't get orders right. Doesn't hesitate to hurry guests along, even when there are plenty of seats. And naturally doesn't hesitate to brazenly add a compulsory 18%tip for parties of five- regardless of ones satisfaction with the meal (not bad) or the service (worst I have ever encountered anywhere in the world, across the continents). Worst of all, our waiter was smug and confrontational when we negotiated to have the compulsory tip removed and left him with a tip corresponding to the service that we received. The manager was somewhat nicer, but then silently left the bill on our table without any apology for the horrible service we had received.  I am a generous tipper, giving 15 for the usual and 20 or 25 for great service. It would have been very easy for the waiter to receive a decent tip that evening! I only decided to tip horribly after an equally horrible experience: the decision to do so goes against every grain of kindness and gratitude in my body.  To then be openly confronted and accosted by a waiter on the way out (the first time that night he did anything quickly was to take our check and calculate the tip) really only added insult to unnecessary injury. But it further confirmed my dissatisfaction, insofar as it is thoroughly un-professional and shows clearly misplaced priorities. Our previous requests had been completely overlooked. It was only at tip time that our waiter became proactive- in fact, discomfitingly proactive.  To our waiter: If you want a decent tip, don't just expect it.  To potential customers: This restaurant seems to thrive on one time customers- take a look at yelp and consider your options. I've had better service at fast food chains, but there's no tip there.",0.8148,0.713,0.154,0.133,0.6510504201680672

With delicious options like orange, pineapple crush, and twisted frenchie they even persuaded me - a non-martini drinker - to get in on the action. They have a very small but nice assortment of beers on tap - I fell in love with a beer I had never heard of before, which is impressive for only having about 6 beers on tap. Beyond the crazy good food, I loved all the giant windows looking out onto the park. I had a great time eating here by myself and people watching.

Don't worry y'all, by the second time I came back that weekend she already had a new dude.

2013-05-26,4.0,"Came here for breakfast because Yolk had an hour wait.  I was staying at a nearby hotel playing tourist for the weekend with my family.  It is a very cool, sophisticated modern room.   However, I was put off by the fact that this rather large restaurant with many empty tables was going to make us wait twenty minutes to sit.  Many others felt the same way and left.  While waiting, I read the other Yelp reviews and realized this is there Achilles heel.  Slow service. I will say, the servers were all well dressed, professional looking and friendly.  But they seemed resigned to the fact that they knew they were going to be slow and therefore apologized in advance for it.  The hostess actually told us upon sitting, after making us wait in the hotel lobby for ten minutes (not twenty), she said she was sorry, but it would take us awhile to get our food.  This created a bit of anxiety as we were with children and didn't really want to spend an hour plus waiting on breakfast. The food, however, was excellent.  Really really excellent, in fact.  And worth the wait.  And while they brought my daughter the wrong meal, they rectified it quickly, apologizing the whole time. I had the eggs Benedict with a tomato bernaise that was light and airy and fresher tasting than any I've had before.  Perhaps my favorite eggs Benedict to date.  And I order eggs Benedict often.  My daughter ordered the hazelnut crepes off the kids menu and they delivered the pancake with fresh berrys and Nutella.  The crepes were good but I sure hope they didn't throw away that pancake because that looked awesome.  My hubbie got the European which was a fat croissant, Brie and ham that you assembled yourself.  Looked yummy.  He didn't share. If you're in the area and are willing to wait a little bit in a more relaxed and sophisticated atmosphere than Yolk, it's worth it.",0.995,0.776,0.182,0.042,0.5197905643738978

2013-05-10,4.0,"I ate here with several people from my french class while we were on an excursion to the Art Institute. (Great place for groups as it is very large and accommodating.) I had the Beef Bourguignon and it was unbelievably good. The meat was tender, juicy, and seasoned perfectly. I tried the La fin du monde which was a little too citrusy for me, but blue moon drinkers would probably love it. I also tried a glass of Chateau de la Bouyere, a Bordeaux, which was fan-fricking-tastic. I was surprised they did not have more choices for wine (unless you want to purchase a bottle). Lastly, I ordered the dark chocolate mousse but I really was not impressed. It was mediocre at best. The service could have been a little better, as they almost seemed nonexistent minus the one guy who continued to bring us refills of water. My assumption is that this is supposed to be a more authentic French restaurant, in which case, the dinner process is slower paced, the environment is more relaxed, and the wait staff spend less time hovering over you. In some aspects this is good, in others, not so much. In America, the arrival of the check can very much change the customers perception of the entire night if it takes too long to arrive. In this case, I think they expected us to spend more time relaxing and eating. It was refreshing not to be rushed from the table.  All this being said, I give it four stars because the food was cooked and tasted exactly as I would have hoped for, the drinks were delicious, and the desire to go back is high. I was also surprised at their price points being downtown Chicago, as they seemed generously reasonable considering the location. If you have never been to a French restaurant and would like to give one a try or you simply want a nice French restaurant to go to, this is definitely your place.",0.9961,0.809,0.181,0.01,0.46161375661375664

For dinner, I ordered the savory quiche, which was quite honestly to die for! It came out hot and moist with a crispy crust. Though it's listed on the hors d'oeuvres menu, the fact that it includes a generous side salad makes it more of a small entree. My friend chose the Bucati Pasta which had a light sauce with a simple but nice flavor. She found the noodles to be too 'al dente' for her taste though.  And to drink: the Twisted Frenchie. Yum! One sip swayed my friend to order one too.  For dessert, we shared the mocha mousse, served in a ramekin on a small slate board, accompanied by their housemade whipped cream, and a small cookie. The mousse was fine, the cookie didn't shine, but what was actually really good was the whipped cream!  Service was great, I thought. I can't agree with other reviewers' complaints about service being slow because my friend and I were in absolutely no rush. Therefore, our server seemed perfectly attentive and respectful of our leisurely pace.

2013-04-01,2.0,"I typically don't write Yelp reviews, but after coming to this place, I felt compelled to do so. Friday, I went with my work colleagues for an office lunch. The place was pretty empty except for three other tables, so we all figured we'd have a fairly quick lunch and head on our way. The service was terrible and unfortunately, because of this, we were there for nearly two hours. Thankfully, we were having a ""retreat"" day so we didn't need to be back to the office, but I can't imagine trying to ever come to this place during the lunch hour rush and actually making it back to the office in time if they were this slow with only three other tables to tend to. The food was just okay. I ordered the onion soup, which had a nice flavor to it, and the croque monsieur, which was really dry and didn't have the punch from the cheese that I've come to love with croques. Additionally, the bathroom in the hotel lobby was filthy and covered with empty toilet paper rolls and paper towels everywhere. I'm not sure if the restaurant is in charge of the cleaning or if the hotel is, but either way, customers have to use this and it would have been nice if someone had cleaned it ahead of time.  I came back to Brasserie on Sunday for their Easter brunch, and only did so because my parents made the reservation two weeks ago without realizing that I would be going there on Friday. I decided to give this place the benefit of the doubt and partake in their bottomless mimosa brunch with the rest of my family. We were seated by the hostess (who was really sweet) as soon as we entered - which was great because it was so crowded - but then about a minute after we were seated, the manager came over and said, ""Did the hostess seat you or did you seat yourselves because you know we have reservations today."" We said that we had reservations and the hostess had seated us and he said, ""Oh"" and walked away.  Weird. Anyway, our waiter was extremely nice and kept our glasses refilled, but once again, the service was ridiculously slow. My mom and I ordered eggs and toast - pretty basic - and it took over an hour to get them. I understand that the restaurant was busy, especially since it was Easter, but once our food finally arrived, it was cold. I asked the person who brought us the food (it wasn't our original waiter) for hot sauce and he said, ""Uhh I don't think we serve hot sauce here."" There was hot sauce at the table across from us, and those customers politely let us use theirs instead.  The mimosas were definitely the best part about the whole experience, but even those took a while to get from our waiter. After we asked for our check, the manager (who asked us if we had seated ourselves) came over and asked how everything had been. We let him know that the service was extremely slow and that our food arrived cold. He did apologize and he did even take some of the cost off of our bill, and we definitely appreciated that.  Both experiences definitely left a bad taste with me and I will likely not be back to this establishment.

The menu is simple (not in a bad way).  Things don't necessary blow your mind away, but it's just what you'd expect; in other words, it's reliable.  Last night, I had the onion soup gratinee and chicken coq au vin with a glass of cote du rhone.  Everything hit the spot.  The complimentary bread and butter were good too. I've gone with just my husband (for Thanksgiving dinner! - we were moving and didn't have the time/energy/space to cook at our packed up apartment), with my husband and a mutual friend (outside seating, great summer night on Michigan Ave), with several friends (plenty of space), and with just a girl friend. I could easily do business there if I worked in the area and had the sort of job where you took clients out for a meal.   I gave it 3 stars, ""A-OK"", because the food is really good, the price is reasonable for what you're getting, there's never a wait, and the service is decent.  To get 5 stars, it needs to have a livelier atmosphere and better service.  I don't want it to become so popular that I'd have to start waiting in lines to get in, but it felt appropriately busier and more energetic during a summer night when I got to sit out on the sidewalk and enjoy a beautiful breeze and Michigan Ave scene.  I'm a bit concerned that it won't make it if it's mostly as slow as it was when I went there the other times. As for service, it's not that it's bad, but it's just a bit off, often times a bit too slow.  Maybe the slowness of the atmosphere is contributing to the slowness of the service - people are affected by others' energy. In any case, I'm coming back and sincerely hope that it succeeds because I love the food and it's good value!",0.9981,0.741,0.226,0.033,0.5273469387755103

We get hungry early so we arrived about 5:30 pm and the place was nearly empty except for a few people at the bar.

She simply explained the deal and was very friendly in offering suggestions about good dishes to order. We ordered the charcuterie plate and the cheese plate for appetizers, and the coq au vin and the duck confit for entrees. Everything was outstanding, especially the coq au vin, and we are total converts. Having spent lots of time in New Orleans and in Montreal, we are so happy to have found a delicious, reasonably priced French-inspired bistro to come for a ""fix"" whenever we need it.

2013-01-06,2.0,"My two friends and I planned what we thought would be a fun Saturday evening: ice skating at Millennium Park followed by an 8 p.m. reservation at Brasserie by LM. The line for skate rental at MP was outrageously long so we wandered over to Brasserie around 7 p.m. to see whether we could be seated earlier. When we arrived, there were many open tables, and we were seated right away. We should have guessed that the restaurant was empty for a reason. Here are the highlights (sarcasm) of our visit: DRINKS: It took several minutes for our waitress to come to the table, but when she did, she alerted us that it was $5 martini night. We ordered three different martinis, which came to the table in an extremely slow fashion. We were sitting right next to the bar so we saw that the drinks were ready for a long time before our waitress retrieved them.  One of the martini glasses had a bit of liquid in the bottom, which my friend questioned the waitress about. She took the glass back to the bar, then came back to the table and told us that water was from the ice cubes that are used to cool the glasses. Weird that they wouldn't serve dry glasses, but whatever. Then the weirdest part of all: The waitress didn't know which drink was in which martini shaker. She put her nose to each shaker to smell it before pouring our drinks. Her nose was way up in there (what if she had the flu or something?), and she made some comment about how she hoped she would pour correctly. This happened not once, but twice! We ordered another round, and she did the same thing again.  I should mention that I didn't like my first martini (Twisted Frenchie). It had a very unpleasant taste, and I barely drank any of it. I asked the waitress for a new martini, and she took $5 off the bill. I appreciated that.  FOOD: Both a member of the wait staff and the waitress brought us square bowls of bread (strange presentation). The bread seemed to have been purchased from a store. It was not particularly tasty or fresh. It was also strange that the waitress brought us bread right after the wait staff. A lack of communication, I guess.  I ordered the menu du jour for $25. My menu consisted of carrot soup with lobster crostini, Lake Superior white fish with carrots, Israeli couscous and some unidentifiable green sauce, and rice pudding. The carrot soup was bland, and there was excess soup on the outside of the bowl. I didn't finish it. The fish was moist but oversalted, the carrots were undercooked, the couscous was underseasoned, and the unidentifiable green sauce was completely lacking in flavor. I actually asked the waitress to cancel my dessert after having tasted the soup and fish because I knew I would probably be disappointed.  One friend also ordered the white fish. Like the soup, her plate looked messy. And it was $17, which was too expensive for what we got. My other friend ordered mussels in white wine sauce with french fries. She received a lot of mussels, but there was not enough broth. Additionally, the manager brought her a bottle of ketchup and a bottle of Hellmann's mayonnaise. I understand the ketchup, but mayo? At least put it in a little bowl to make it look more refined. This is not Denny's!  SERVICE: Service was very, very slow. We did not leave the restaurant until 9 p.m.  Given the fact that the restaurant was not crowded, we should have been out of there in an hour and a half - TOPS.  Additionally, it was hotter than heck in this restaurant. My pants were actually sticking to my legs when we got up to leave.  After dinner, I wasn't even close to full. My friends and I went to Tavernita for drinks and dessert. If I could, I would give Brasserie a rating of 2.5. I once dined at the original LM and thoroughly enjoyed it.

We picked what we thought would be the best out of the other items that also did not stand out as sounding delicious. The salad with the savory quiche was sweet. The Lyonnaise salad tasted more sour. The two dishes together made a good balance. The quiche itself was delicious. The crust was super flaky and crunchy! The white fish was made perfectly--except it had a few little bones still in it (watch out for those!).  I dont know how the beef bourguignon tasted but I believe my friend enjoyed it and cleared off the plate.  Service was friendly but was not super attentive to us. Sometimes that's a good thing, but we had waited for her for a little while when we needed something so the lack of attentiveness ended up not being so great.

I wasn't looking for something big and fancy; just something nice and easy to take to-go.  I opted for the roast beef sandwich with fries.  Total came up to about 10 bucks, after tips. When I opened the box, my jaw dropped.  There was a HUGE portion of fries waiting for me, and a nice 9 inch sandwich cut in two.  The fries were much darker than other fries I've ever had (I come from SF) so I thought they were sweet potato fries.   Turns out this wasn't the only difference: these fries are MUCH MUCH saltier.  I don't know if this is a first time, or if their fries are ALWAYS this salty, but wow, that really threw me off.  I love fries, but not this salty, so one star gone (sorry if that's harsh =/) Hoping the sandwich would offer some reprieve, I dug in eagerly and was slightly disappointed.  The roast beef was fine, but the sandwich was rather dry.  There were about 4 pieces of cheese, so that didn't help much.  No lettuce or tomatoes to speak of, so it was just a basic sandwich made of bread, roast beef, and cheese (american).  Nothing fancy, and the bread wasn't that great.  Docked a star there =/. Wait time wasn't that good, and I expected much more in terms of quality.  The restaurant looked very cozy and nice so it was kind of sad that I had to take the meal to-go.  Maybe there will be a next time, to sit in and dine.  They do have a nice selection in terms of menu items.",0.9345,0.796,0.128,0.075,0.6309210526315789

2012-10-30,3.0,"I'm on a mission to sample the wares of all the new offspring of the now-defunct Lincoln Square restaurant, LM. Recently, I visited LM Bistro in River North (dumbed down a tiny bit to suit the hotel setting, but the cooking is still very good). Now, I've tried Brasserie by LM in the north South Loop, another incarnation in a hotel. The Brasserie is OK, but down yet another notch. There are two seating areas in the place: a brightly lit, TV-festooned bar area, and a dimmer, rather dead dining room. I chose the latter, and it was a little more cheerful near the front window. Service was brisk and efficient, if not warm. The menu offers a compact yet credible array of choices for all meals of the day, as you'd expect in a hotel. The beverage list is also compact: there are about a half-dozen beers on draft and another half-dozen bottled (if you exclude beverages with the word ""Lite"" in the name, since these are not actually beers). Oddly limited for a brasserie. The wine list is similarly limited, but there are acceptable choices for any likely taste. A mesclun salad with goat cheese was pleasant, as was a sausage mixed grille (with curry sausage being the daily choice -- not a typical pairing with rapini, but both were good). My companion's barramundi was also good. Both entrées were modest portions, but adequate. The dessert selection was limited, as well, and we passed. I wish the Brasserie well. It's a tough  job maintaining a balance between decent  food and being in a hotel setting. One factor in its favor is the dearth of affordable restaurants in the South Loop that serve decent food. I suspect I'll return...",0.9594,0.78,0.137,0.083,0.47901700992610075
2012-10-28,1.0,"It's been a long time since I had a more disappointing meal or one that was executed so incompetently or with so little concern for quality. We stopped for lunch at Brasserie by LM with somewhat high expectations, because we had twice had very positive experiences at the original LM Restaurant. It appears that expanding to four restaurants has spread their talents too thin, however, because this meal at Brasserie by LM showed that they had lost any control over the quality of their restaurants. Both of our dishes literally should not have left the kitchen, and if anyone had been paying attention, they wouldn't have. The spinach in my spinach, shallot, and brie omelette was overcooked to a color that does not exist in nature - that muddy, purplish green that vegetables get when they've been boiled or steamed for about ten minutes too long. No one who calls him or herself a chef or cares about the customer would ever have put that spinach in an omelette and served it. But the omelette was the best dish we had. My wife's eggs benedict came with two poached eggs on top that also had been overcooked beyond recognition. They were nearly hard-boiled inside - instead of cutting into them and having the yolk ooze out to form a sauce over the ingredients underneath, my wife cut into two solid egg whites and a solid yolk without even a teaspoon of uncooked yolk. My wife very seldom ever sends back food, but when she showed our server the dish, it was whisked away and replaced without any attempt to defend it. Even the toast and fried potatoes had issues. Each slice of toast was hard and brittle, but not burnt, which means it must have been stale even before it was toasted. How anyone would toast stale bread and think that the customer wouldn't notice is beyond me - and does not speak well of the attitude of the kitchen staff. The potato rounds were edible, but because they ranged in thickness from 1/8 to 1 inch, some were over-fried and crispy, while others were still a little raw in the middle. I will say that the server couldn't have been nicer or more apologetic, and even the manager (I think) came out to apologize for my wife's eggs. It became almost humorous, though, when she confidently asked me about my dish - expecting that at least my food was good - only to find that mine was just as bad as my wife's. Even though I told them not to bother replacing my stale toast, I was given a double portion of fresh bread toasted - none of which I ate, I'm afraid. The only positives about Brasserie by LM were that the space was well-designed and the servers were friendly, and our server in particular handled the situation as well as could be expected. There was no arguing or trying to convince us that our food was actually good - the incompetence of its preparation was too obvious - and the restaurant did cut our bill in half without our asking (another sign that they were more embarrassed than offended). But service and design - and even handling a bad situation well - couldn't possibly make us want to go back after such an aggressively bad performance by the kitchen. I'm still amazed that this restaurant allows food to be served to diners without someone doing some kind of quality check; even minimal effort would have caught these problems before the food got to our table. Do they not know or do they not care? If you're the customer, does it really matter?",-0.9133,0.822,0.081,0.097,0.485799321890231

2012-08-20,4.0,"I've been a long time lover of the original LM Restaurant, and Troquet is the cutest little French bar you could ever lose an afternoon to, so I was excited to try brunch at Brasserie by LM while staying downtown at the adjacent Hilton for Dance For Life's big event. The space is a big improvement on the prior tenant, Tribute.  The owners have softened up the walls with earth tones and photo-posters, and added a fake wall with a blackboard behind the circular table to give the space a cozier, bistro feel. The only sour note of the brunch occurred when I sat down and asked for the cocktail menu - they did not have one for brunch.  This was a minor inconvenience because I wanted a Kir Royale.  That, however, was a MAJOR inconvenience because they did not have Creme de Cassis.  What French restaurant does not have Creme de Cassis?  I was disappointed and shocked, and said so.  Our server, who also happened to be the manager, was sympathetic, as she is French and understood my disappointment.  Hopefully, she will take action and they will add it to their collection, and you, dear reader, will benefit from my disappointment.  I'm always looking out for you. I'm quite happy to say that the remainder of the meal was fantastic.  The croissants were light and airy, and the entrees were delicious.  I had the LM Benedict, and it was divine.  The Hollandaise was rich and creamy, the eggs perfectly cooked with a lovely runny yoke, the French ham smoky and flavorful, sauced with a delicious slice of tomato, all on top of a crispy English muffin.  One of the best breakfasts I've had.  And, most importantly, their coffee is superb.  Prices are all very affordable given the location, and I think LM will have more success here than Tribute did.  They had a good crowd at 11 am, but tables were still available. Finally, if you are less particular than I regarding your breakfast cocktail selection, they do have an all-you-can-drink Mimosa special, which could be a lovely indulgence on their sidewalk cafe on a sunny day. I also perused their dinner menu, and it looked delicious - the beef Bourguignon was always spectacular at LM, I'd expect no less here.  The wine list is very reasonable and I hope to make this an after work dinner spot in the imminent future.

2012-06-11,1.0,"I went to the old restaurant once where Brasserie LM now sits and wonder if it's the same owners that are trying to run us the customer away.  Me and a group went in last week on 3 consecutive evenings and had a server named (LaTrina?) .  She gave us great service and was very personable.  From our conversation she was still in training and it was her first week their.  Not only did we overhear the server who was to be training her talk down and try to make her look bad, but when we tried to give her a gratuity added on the the 18% that the restaurant automatically charges for groups, this server who was allegedly training her had some word to say that made us want to just get up a leave.  The food was clean and good, and I would go back for the food ONLY!!!!!  The attitude of the servers other than ours who was ""TRAINING"" was shoddy.  To top it off we came back to visit again and found out that they fired the only server that was actually doing their job.  I wont be going back anytime soon even though it's conveniently located by my office.  Fix your service issues or you will end up like the last restaurant that was in the same space CLOSED!!!! Also recognize when you have good talent that customers like because they will keep people coming back because the food wasn't an issue, but your PM servers are.   This is coming from an individual with 20+ years in the culinary industry, trained in classic french technique, cooked in 3 different countries, and currently am a personal chef running my own successful business.  If I treated my customer base the way your servers act then I'd have to change careers because nobody would want my service even though the food is outstanding. TAKE THIS AS A WAKE UP CALL.  I'll be back in 2 weeks to see if you actually listen to your customers.",0.9847,0.855,0.114,0.031,0.39181286549707595
2012-06-04,3.0,"I hope the owners/managers at Brasserie by LM read their Yelp reviews, because I SO want this place to make it, and with just a few tweaks, I think they can. Right now, too many things are hit or miss...the menu choices, the service, the food, etc. Décor - I like it.  Casual, interesting table groupings, nice big outdoor patio space, unusual chalkboard walls, open and airy space. Food Choices on the Menu - Mehh.  Seriously, when we sat down, we all looked at the menu for about 10 minutes, and nothing really jumped out at us. I'm not sure what it is, but something about the mix of food just makes everything seem so boring and unappealing.  It may be as simple as a redesign of the menu format...it doesn't read well, at all. Service - Uninspiring, to say the least.  With the exception of the bartender we had the first time we went in (long reddish brown hair...maybe Jessica?), who was fabulous, all of the servers are kind of boring, slow, and not very knowledgeable about the menu offerings. Food - Definitely hit or miss. The Fromage Plate starter...pretty yummy.  The Savory Quiche plate...nice large size for a starter...excellent side of mixed greens...and my sister said the quiche itself was decent, except the crust was much too hard.  The Sausage Grill...I liked a lot...interesting curry sausage the day we were there, out-of-this-world-good sautéed greens, and a darn tasty potato puree.  French Fries...wonderful homemade goodness...especially when ordered well done.  The Roast Beef Sandwich...big fail...no flavor at all...the bread overpowers the sandwich...and there was virtually no meat or cheese.  The Macaroni Gratin...blech...tasted like buttered noodles made for a 4 year old, with Kraft Parmesan Cheese sprinkled on top. So...I'll definitely give it another try...but I expect to see some improvements in the food, menu and service soon.  If not, I'll just hit the bar for a beer or two, when the fabulous bartender is working!!",0.9737,0.812,0.126,0.062,0.5367835097001765

2012-05-07,3.0,"While I'm excited to have a restaurant with strong credentials come to my neighborhood in the South Loop, I refuse to get attached until this place proves it has staying power. First, the good. I like the decor (although it didn't change much from its predecessor, Tribute). My dining companion and I were sat at a high table fronting Michigan Avenue. This meant great views of the park and people watching. I had veal sausage au gratin and she had pork belly., with no appetizers or desserts, but both were well prepared. Next time, I'll probably add one or the other, as portion sizes leave room for an add on. Two glasses of wine and the entree was $43 with tip, not too bad! So now, the bad. It's got a lot of baggage to overcome being housed in the Essex hotel (or most hotels for that matter). We arrived at 10 on a Saturday night after a ballet at the Auditorium. There was only a handful of patrons. And they closed just as we settled in (10:30)! Also, our kind server seemed to be the only one on staff to handle what customers that were there. So service was too slow. So everything disappointing here is surely fixable with strong word of mouth, longer hours, and more and better service as business grows!",0.9857,0.793,0.17,0.037,0.5581400966183575
2012-05-03,5.0,"This was my second visit to the Brasserie by LM and  the second time was as good as the first!  This time I tried the Mesclun salad with the fried goat cheese...It was yummy!!!  I ordered the roasted chicken...on our last visit my friend raved about it so I had to try it.  It was wonderful, as well as the sides that went with it!  A great choice!!!  My husband loved his Beef Bournignon and the goat salad.  The service was great.  Our friends loved their dishes as well.  The prices are reasonable and the portions are perfect...not small like the Tributes. I loved the decor!  It is friendly and warm and the colors are very soothing.  I hope that they will have outdoor eating soon.  This area of town is wonderful for sitting outside, we're it is peaceful.   It is across from beautiful Grant Park.

2012-04-16,1.0,"Uh-oh, service is no good here. We really hoped that this place would succeed, since they have such a great al-fresco space. But the service ruined everything. Once we were sat, we waited nearly 15 minutes before any server came to our table. We eventually had to ask the hostess, Christina(who was aimlessly walking around shuffling forks), if we could get some service here. She took our order and said she would bring out water to our table. Another 15 minutes went by without water, so we went to the bar and had to get it ourselves from the bartender.  Once the food came out, I was given the wrong dish and told that this was the dish that I had ordered. After a few bites, I asked to see the menu again and confirmed the fact that this was NOT the dish that I had ordered. No good there. I complained and was given an apology, nothing else. We made sure to order the check as soon as our entrees arrived because I couldn't wait any longer. The check was given, nothing had been discounted or taken off. Pretty much a very mediocre experience all around. The food was ok, not amazing and definitely not worth the aggravation.  This location seems to never allow a place to succeed. Or maybe every place that comes here is not run properly, so success is impossible.",0.914,0.784,0.127,0.089,0.5910493827160493
2012-04-05,2.0,"On the strength of the food alone, I would have rated this somewhat higher, but the entire experience just fell far short of expectations. Decor = high school cafeteria Bar = very limited selection of only the most basic items, 1 bourbon, no rye, no ability to make anything beyond basic cocktails. At this location a killer bar with a world class bartender and beverage selection should bring in crowds. This ain't cutting it. Ambiance = none. Cold, dead feeling, no music in the background, nothing. Staff = OK but so cold that we commented ""perhaps they're trying to make us feel like we're actually in France"" Wine list = small but actually nice selections that paired well with the food. Food = perfectly acceptable but not uplifting. Nothing wowed our socks off. Salads were OK, we were puzzled that the Bibb Salad and Lyonnaise Salad used the exact same lettuce mix (as far as we could tell). The egg on the Lyonnaise was overcooked meaning it didn't ""become one"" with the salad as it should. Entrees were also OK. Duck Confit was tasty as were the beans it was served on, the steak for the steak/frite was good, but a strip steak isn't authentic for this dish. SImilarly, the frite were giant steak fries instead of the thin cut we were hoping for. Dessert = can't say, we were never offered the chance to order dessert or coffee and by that time we were bored anyway so didn't make a point of it. Pricing = reasonable Crowd = minimal, on a Wednesday night with 2 big conventions in town, location right next to the giant Hilton. Maybe one tenth filled. By the time we left they were already setting up for breakfast in the side room that was entirely empty the entire time we were there. Bar crowd = zero. Not even hotel guests. There were a few people at the bar when we arrived but when we left at about 9:30 there were none. Hopes = unless things pick up we're looking at another DOA player in this troubled space.",-0.9676,0.761,0.091,0.148,0.5613122923588041
2012-04-03,5.0,"After my first trip to Paris a few years ago I fell in love with French food. I have been on the search trying different French restaurants in the city of Chicago. When the new Brasserie by LM opened I was anxious to see if it compared to my restaurant in Paris.  I dined with a friend so I was able to try a few different dishes. My friend had the goat cheese salad and I had the Lyonaise. Both were amazing! The portion sizing and value for the money were great. I tried the Lyonaise salad on recommendation by the waiter. It was filled with a delicious mustard vinaigrette, bacon, and little potatoes.  We tried the cheese plate that had was accompanied by french bread and a fig spread. The epoisses cheese mixed with the fig spread made my taste buds jump! For our entrees I had hanger steak and fries and my friend had mussels and fries. We were both very happy with our choices!  If you can believe it we had a little room for dessert. We tried the creme brulee. When I closed my eyes it brought me right back to my favorite restaurant in Paris. Its a must!
