We sat in the Patio ordered our food, I ordered a burger and asked for it to be well done.. a couple bites into it and it was pink. I instantly felt nauseous.. but it's a common mistake. I simply told the waitress and waited for a new burger. My burger arrived well done (dead just how I like it, sorry I don't like my animals alive) of course right while I was divulging into it, my significant other pointed out a dying mouse on the patio. I instantly lost my appetite, and wanted to take my food to go.

2017-06-07,4.0,"No basic burgers over here at Jerry's. What brought me here? Oh snap, I came to Order The Yelp! To start, there was a bit of confusion when I came in. The Yelp app says they close at one am but they actually stop serving food earlier (I arrived around 10). I told the server I was here to Order The Yelp and he didn't know about it (I had to show him my app & at this point I'm wondering how it will be priced). He went to the back and I was served quickly after that. Any hiccups were clearly made up for straightaway after I took the first bite. The perfect burger is a very personal matter - from the seasoning to the garnish. Here, with such intense flavor I was prevented from taking a break to blink or drink anything (it was that good guys). So the Jerry's Yelp item is called the Yelp Cinco Burger (choice of patty, American cheese, queso fresco, avocado, cilantro, red onion, lettuce, tortilla strips, southwest mayo & house bbq sauce). The chicken was so juicy and well-seasoned. I really enjoyed all of the textures from the fine chopped avocado to the crunch of the tortilla strips; and the fries were still sizzling and crisp. With Erykah Badu playing in the background & the Warriors dominating in the playoffs I was winning threefold. Ordering the Yelp goes on from June 4 - June 17, 2017 and is a delightful and delicious way to save and explore the culinary scene of the Chi.  Upon entry, Jerry's was very clean and clearly a hangout for the neighborhood folks. Ideally of course, they would've been ready for the Yelp deal - I was right at the end there was an issue with billing but I just pulled out the app again. Even if this isn't in your immediate neighborhood it is so worth a quick Uber to try something new and with your taste buds in mind. I can't wait to go back and try others things as well. P.S.A: Keep it classy & tip on the full value of the meal not the after-discount amount.",0.9966,0.792,0.185,0.022,0.5024826183917094
2017-06-03,4.0,"We came here to grab some drinks as the drinks menu was appealing to us. Not sure if this is the same Jerry's as the one that closed in Wicker Park not too long. Anyway, we had dinner elsewhere but weren't ready to call it a night just yet. We were promptly seated at a table of our choice. Our server was courteous and informed us well on the questions we had about their menu. We went for drafts of beer from the local beer companies from Jerry's menu. We wanted to try something unique. Along with our beers, we decided to have some finger foods as we had some room left after dinner and plus, I wanted to try some of their hot sauces. We ordered cheese curds and jalapeno poppers. The cheese curds were a bit too greasy and kinda small in size compared what I have had elsewhere. But not a problem. The jalapeno poppers were huge. A whole pepper stuffed with cream cheese and covered with fried batter. With or without the dipping sauces both the apps were tasty. From the beer drafts menu, we could order a pint or a smaller size where available so that was good as I had limited room in my stomach to consume a full pint. I can't remember which beer I had but I liked what I had.  Overall, we had a good experience here. Wish we had room for their sandwiches which is what they are known for. They have got a great variety of sandwiches. So next time I'll go for the sandwiches. Anyway, check out Jerry's. It's a good place for food and drinks. It has a nice atmosphere.

We were one of 5 tables in the restaurant. We were sat and brought water fairly quickly. It was a significant wait until our server came to take our order. We ordered our drinks, apps, and main dishes in one go, knowing that service would be slow. We received our chicken popper app before our beers were served. We sent the chicken poppers back, because the meat was obviously bad. Honestly, it was the first time I'd sent back food in recent memory.  The beers were good. That's the only reason for two stars. The sandwiches were okay. They used to be fresh and flavorful now they are bland and the bread  just short of stale.  We received our check at 6:03 with the chicken poppers still on the tab.

2017-05-11,2.0,Well it had been almost 2-years since I had eatin here so decided to give it another try and this time for lunch. Again I was drawn in by the attractive design of the restaurant and its gigantic list of interesting sammiches. Although again even though the restaurant was not busy the service just was not good. After ordering we basically never saw our server again. I had to ask other employees for water  refills and the check and hand the check to someone else for it to be payed.  The food was again disappointing. The vegetarian sandwich I ordered sounded wonderful on paper but was a heaping serving of dry bun with dry skimpy ingredients and 1 thin piece of cheese. The sides were pretty good but I came for a quality sandwich not chips or potato salad.  OHH...and to highlight the experience a MOUSE was running around the dining room and I was not the only one who noticed it.  Woman we're lifting their legs off the ground and then staff began to chase it with a broom and dust pan until eventually catching it. To be fair they had the front door open so perhaps it came in from the street but still as you are eating the last thing you want to see are rodents running around the restaurant.  Many patrons including myself lost their appetite and soon left.  I think for me I am done with the food and would only return for beers and/or to try the patio in back. But honestly it could very well be my final visit.,0.9503,0.861,0.104,0.036,0.6329861111111111

My sandwich was hard to eat -the meat wasn't that tinder and the bread seemed chewy and difficult to bite through. Also, the side of mac and cheese wasn't warm. My friends ordered the cheese and pretzels appetizer and the cheese dip was cold. We weren't sure if it was supposed to be cold, so we didn't say anything.

2017-04-26,1.0,"I committed quite the faux pas this passed weekend and decided to meet a friend at Jerry's for brunch instead of the original plan of brunching at Summer House (one of the best brunch places in Lincoln Park). My friend requested outside seating and we were happy to wait 20-30 minutes for a table as it was a warm Sunday afternoon and it would be understandably busy. We were seated in the middle of the patio without an umbrella or any type of shading and when I politely asked Molly (our belligerent and awful waitress from the bowls of Hell) for a different table, seeing that there was a table with an umbrella available, she rudely said no and that that's the best they can do. I guess there was a drought as well because, as we perspired and looked around for Molly (the Hell demon waitress from Satan's rectum) for water she was no where to be found.  I ordered a mimosa which was in a dirty glass and was barely even filled. The picture I have is after I'd taken one sip. Basically I payed $10 for a one finger drink.  My friend was also appalled to notice that our water glasses were NOT refilled even though we were baking in the sun. And after I turned around looking for Molly (our mercilessly torturer from Hell) I could see her eating in the back area, not giving two flying f#cks about her customers. This girl (Molly, whom I now despise with every fibre of my being) left a sour taste in my mouth to the point that I took one bite of my lunch and was putt off. She did not care about customer satisfaction nor whether or not the customer was comfortable, hydrated or even moderately tipsy which would garner her more tips... The surprising thing is, out of respect and basic etiquette, my friend and I did tip 20% (that's just good manners which is more than I can say for Molly, Satan's Hell mistress) and I did telephone the restaurant in hopes of speaking to the manager about Molly and lodge my complaint. But I was surprised when my grievances fell upon deaf ears. Friends, Chicagoans, Countrymen... if the management at Jerry's does not care then by golly why should their wait staff care either? And better yet, why should we, as paying customers care enough to patron this abominable establishment???!

It was about 7pm on a Thursday. There was one bar tender, and he also seemed to be waiting on folks sitting at the tables in the bar section.  When I sat down, the bar tender greeted me and provided menus. He was cordial enough. Another gentleman sat down next to me, also a solo diner. After discussing beer with the guy next to me, the bar tender asked me for my drink order, which I gave to him. I also wanted to eat, but, having worked in the service industry, I waited for him to ask whether I wanted food, because I assumed he was busy and would get back to me when he had a chance.  The bar tender then took the food and drink order of the gentleman next to me. He also checked on and greeted other guests, ran a check, presumably poured drinks for dining room orders, and so on. He never got back to me, and never asked me if I wanted food (again, I did).  Again, having been in the service industry, I wanted to give him space. But when, a half hour later, the bar tender simply asked me if I wanted another drink, and did not even ask if I wanted food, if I was doing ok, or any other prompt to determine if I needed anything other than a drink, I decided it was time to go, so I just asked for the check.

You really could have put just about anything in front of us and I think it would have been well received, so it was such a shame that their Beer Cheese Dip was so unappetizing that I sent it back. I hate to do that and rarely do, but that's really how bad it tasted to me. The Beer Cheese Dip comes with warm pretzel bites, fried pita slices and run of the mill pretzel sticks. Of course, the carbs on the side weren't the problem. Aside from the sticks, everything else was warm... except for the Beer Cheese. I've never had it served cold and it was such a shock. On top of that, it was overwhelmingly ""zing-y"". It's like they packed it with horseradish instead of any actual flavor. The appetizer fell flat, so back to the kitchen it went and off the bill it came! The Crab Dip was pretty good and served hot, as it should be. The Cheese Curds were also really good. There were lots of other things on the menu that looked good, too. But after the iffy appetizers, I wasn't willing to risk a full entrée of anything. The beer list is decent, though I foolishly went with an overpriced cocktail. $12 for Smokey the Pear that really was like drinking liquid smoke and not much else. Other friends have told me you're better off sticking to a sandwich and draft beer from this place. I'm inclined to believe them.

2016-06-14,4.0,"Our first & only visit to Jerry's thus far was in April 2016 (late reviewer here).  Overall, we really enjoyed our meal & would strongly consider returning the next time we are in the Andersonville Area.  We were in Andersonville to grab some goodies from the Swedish Bakery before driving into downtown to check into our hotel. After checking out at the bakery, we realized we were really hungry & decided to ditch our other lunch plans downtown. We started walking up & down the street, comparing menus at different places (& Yelp ratings), & Jerry's seemed like the best match for how we were feeling that day.  I'm glad we stopped in on a whim! We weren't disappointed.  I love that you got a choice of 2 sides with the sandwiches, it definitely made the decision easier. :-)  I had the Clint E Sandwich (grilled, marinated steak, herb butter, fried shitake mushroom, lettuce, swiss, aioli, horseradish dressing on baguette) with fries & mac'n'cheese. The sandwich was Outstanding, but it was frustrating having to ask for a steak knife which should have been served with this beast automatically. I dare someone to eat this sandwich by hand. The fries were good, the mac was ""so so""...but my husband liked it when I passed it off to him.  My husband had the Sandra O sandwich (fried chicken, Korean BBQ sauce, cucumber, cider slaw, cheddar, citrus mayo, sriracha, on pretzel bun)...and from the couple of nibbles I was able to steal, it was great as well! The -1 star here was for our service. They were a bit busy (surprisingly warm & sunny spring day), but our server was a bit neglectful. We kept having to ask for drink refills, & he was hard to flag down for things like placing our order, or requesting a steak knife. There was also a slight issue with the person working the host stand that day needing either a) to pull his pants up or b) a longer shirt...as there was definitely a ""crack'ed situation"" going on several times during our meal when he'd be clearing the tables around us. Not what I like to see when eating...  I think if we'd had stellar service, this would easily have been a 5 star review. Overall, next time we swing by Swedish Bakery on the way to or from downtown, we will probably be tempted to stop in for another well-crafted, stacked sandwich from Jerry's.",0.9895,0.806,0.145,0.049,0.5266975308641976

It sounded like kind of a lot for a single sandwich, but it all turned out to mix really well. They didn't skimp on the ingredients, and they combined for a meaty and subtly sweet total package. The sandwiches all come with two small sides. I got the mac and cheese and fries. The mac and cheese was not what I expected and if I had really been in the mood for something dripping with cheese I would have been disappointed, but as it was I enjoyed it. The fries are very standard, but I had them with Jerry's ranch, which is top notch.

We have experienced Jerry's in the winter, spring, summer and fall (eat and drink there about once week).  I have lived in Chicago for about 20 years and tried many establishments in a multitude of neighborhoods. Nick, Michael, Dash, (and more) are first-rate. The Bartenders are welcoming and can speak expertly about the lovely liquids they pour and mix behind the single-slab wood counter. We once dropped in on a busy Saturday night with a 12-top. Dash, who took care of us that evening, was exceptional. Jerry's has a contemporary, yet authentic feel. (It is not a trying-to-hard hipster joint.) So you know that this is an honest review, when the place gets slammed, it can get a little challenging for the kitchen to keep up. Also, you may have to wait a minute longer for your beer or what not. BLEEP happens. (Customers who have been to Jerry's once, drink one beer, leave, and then take time to write a 1-star review....perplexing).   All you weary and burdened, I suggest you spend some time at Jerry's. Try some of the beers in their amazing beer selection. The Bartenders are so patient and gracious, they will let you try a sip of any draft beer before you order a pour -- without tude.  AND Jerry's has two sizes ! -- a 6 oz,  ( which means you can try out a whole bunch of beers ---too many good ones) and a 12 oz.  They also modify their food and beer menu frequently.",0.9922,0.81,0.169,0.021,0.6528985507246378

Another 30 sec later, he returns with the same plate (my buddy adjusted the bread on the sandwich before it was taken away so we know it's the same one) and says never mind, this is yours. No apologies, no explanation. I understand that sometimes the kitchen can be running slow and that sometimes the wrong (or in this case, right) order could be delivered. But then just tell me that the kitchen is running slow so I know you didn't forget about me. And just say ""my apologies, this was your correct order all along.""

We have visited restaurants in Andersonville  coming from the Lakeview area, and I have to say 50/50 as to what kind of service you will get at an Andersonville establishment it seems.  We walked in and were seated promptly, which is a plus, but it really seemed to go downhill from the moment we set eyes on our server, Thomas. It seemed the moment I asked him his suggestion between the two options I was looking at on the menu, he flipped a switch, and became non-communicative, and seemed very annoyed. We brought this to the attention of the manager on duty, and he stated that he was surprised and that patrons ask for Thomas all the time, and it was the first time he had heard of any issues with Thomas. Seriously??? You really could have fooled me. When our food came, we were surprised at the portion size, could have been better, actually left still hungry, oh well, but Thomas never once came back to see how our food was to our liking....never once, he did however refill our drinks one time, any other interaction was non-existent.  Thomas constantly walked around the restaurant with a huge chip on his shoulder, and we wondered what we had done to deserve such treatment. We do not ask for much when dining out, we are easy to get along with, and we just want decent service, this certainly was not the case.  After we finished our meal Thomas proceeded to clear our dishes from the table in a way that said, here, get the hell out, and when he brought the check he threw it down on the table and did not say a word. One word, but if looks could kill, the coroner would have been called on the spot.  We felt so unwelcomed by Thomas, we attempted to just give the check to the hostess, and when Thomas looked at me, he just turned his head, finally taking the check and my card after the hostess stuttered and stammered as to why I was bringing the check to her.  We asked for the manager again, and low and behold he was no where to be seen, possibly down in the basement...avoiding the situation, avoidance is the best policy here!  Just terrible!!!!

2015-09-24,2.0,"For the bar side - one star. For the restaurant side - three stars.  I've come here on several occasions, and definitely experienced the very slow service everyone is writing about.  Bar side: I was at a table with five people, left for a while to drive someone home, and came back. The first time around the waiter was slow to pick up the table of 6 on the bar side, right behind the bar. Once we did put in our drink orders we had to wait to put in our food orders. Most of us ordered appetizers that were deep fried - so very very deep fried the taste of the oil took over. Cheese curds were good, the rest was bland and just 'meh'. After I dropped off my girlfriend, the cheque had already arrived and I still wanted to get a drink - I waited about 10+ minutes for a waiter to visit, and no one did, and I went over to the bar. There I got ignored by the barkeeps - they were either making the drinks for the folks in the restaurant or ignoring the female, because the men were definitely getting served ahead of me. After about 10+ minutes of this, I sat back down with my table - they finished their drinks and we all left.  Restaurant side: My numerous visits to this 'side' of Jerry's had left me in the neutral corner. While I had enjoyed the Santa Fe burger on occasion, had good sides like mashed potatoes or curds, and the beers, when they have them in stock, are great (love! the 6oz options), even when the service had been decent - a mistake here and there in what was brought back to the table: entree or side - the overall dining experience is not above 3 stars' worth. And that's too bad - because this place has so much potential! I think they made the menu smaller- which is great (this isn't dim sum or tapas), the options on paper look tastier than they actually feel in your mouth. Other burgers were consumed without fanfare - very little actual flavouring outside of what you can make for yourself on a grill.  Another patron pointed out that they do not keep the place tidy - I second that opinion. Plenty of dust on the chandeliers (look up - it's gross, and it flies down onto your food!) and the condiments bottles could be wiped down every once in a while, along with the seats and tables (the tables - more often than not - have been clean).  Tip to owner: less options, better emphasis on flavouring, and tell your male waiters that women and lesbians don't bite, and we also tip well, when served well.

There were deep fried pickle chips, an aioli mayo and other items. There were two split chicken breasts. They were absolutely outstanding. They were crispy, but not at all greasy. The chicken meat was flavorful. The sauce, which on traditional Korean chicken can be very sweet, was only mildly sweet making it a great blend with the rest of the food.

Our drink orders came and there was some confusion because we didn't see everything there. The man bringing it from the bar was extremely rude.

I re-ordered and that eventually got fixed. While waiting, we had a waiter drop a tray which splattered ketchup on the back our chairs and on my leg. We actually had to notify a waitress before anyone apologized for that one. The food came in after around an hour at which time we had to have her flagged down to check on the meal. The bill automatically gains a 20% gratuity on the meal so I don't know if that is why they seemed to be lackluster tonight.

Also, we were there celebrating my birthday.  My girlfriend asked the waiter if they do anything for birthdays, and he said ""sure, I'll bring you a dessert"".  But then he ended up putting the dessert on our bill anyway.  While I guess he never said outright that it would be comped, I think that's pretty clearly what the implication was when he said that he would bring us a dessert.  If you're charging us for it, how is that doing anything for a birthday?  It's no different than any other table ordering a dessert.",-0.7082,0.876,0.044,0.08,0.39178004535147387

We are locals and planned on eating our way down Clark St., sooner or later. One way or another. For it being fairly busy during the fest, the service was quick. The atmosphere was also aesthetically pleasing. One of the reasons which probably subconsciously drew us. The food looked good too but the taste was nothing flavorful to write about.

2015-06-13,1.0,"Just, no. The menu really caught my eye as there are a lot of options - an extensive beer list, and seemingly so many delicious sounding food choices to choose from. That, and I live in the neighborhood, so I'm always eager to try and support local businesses.  My boyfriend and I stopped in for dinner, and we were famished. Unfortunately, we were disappointed in all of the food that we chose despite being so hungry and so excited to try everything.  To start with the positive: our server, Shannon, was friendly and we didn't experience the poor service many other reviewers mentioned. Long list of beer selection and some food tables by open air windows and outdoor seating make it a cool space.   Unfortunately the main reason why we were there - the food - left us horribly disappointed. We shared two apps: fried chicken BBQ poppers and crab dip. We really didn't care for either of them. The waitress mentioned the poppers were ""Korean style"" which I'm very familiar with and typically LOVE. What we got were Chicken poppers that were dressed in a glaze that was SO salty we couldn't eat more than a few bites. It tasted like they were doused in so much soy sauce without anything to balance all the salt. We tried dabbing the sauce off, disguising it with other sauces -- to no avail. The crab dip was also really hard to eat - didn't care for the flavors, and was really fishy tasting.  We also shared the BLT which was a potato bun, fresh mozzarella, tomatoes and bacon. The bacon was one strip, not super crispy and the whole sandwich was just very soft and soggy in texture. The two sides that came with didn't help: the mashed potatoes were near liquid and the Mac n cheese was cold, extremely mushy and lacked any flavor whatsoever.  Considering we were famished coming into he restaurant, we'd typically be the easiest to please but the food left us so disappointed we couldn't stop talking about it even the day after.  Seeing the unprofessional and antagonistic tone in the management responses to other reviewers also leaves me with such a poor reflection on the business and there are too many outstanding restaurants and bars on the same street.",0.5394,0.812,0.098,0.09,0.5229261363636363

Very relaxed chill atomosphere. Not pretentious at all like some places like it that tout extensive beer and whiskey offerings. I was given the food and drink menus quickly with a glass of water without even asking for one, which was appreciated as I was parched. Great beer list. Looks like they have something for everybody as far as craft beers go. From listening to the bartender answer other patrons questions, seems like they are fairly knowledgeable about their offerings. Reasonably priced for Andersonville. Also a nice whiskey menu. Never had to wait for a refill. Service was quick but not necessarily warm and inviting. The menu is rather large, so I went with the Diego which was listed as a favorite. I did enjoy it. The bread was good, fresh avocados, and marinade was good. I'm not entirely convinced the meat was cooked to order but I'd order it again. Came with two sides, I got the fries and slaw. I liked the slaw because it wasn't completely drowned in sauce.

2015-05-21,2.0,"I'm giving two stars only because the food was, as usual, quite good. I ordered the usual Mushroom Burger with Cider Slaw and Fries and was very pleased. However, the service was just terrible, which was disappointing especially since I was looking forward to celebrating my birthday with friends. We have had our waiter several times before, and every time he has been rude, messed up our order, or acted like he had better things to do than wait on us. Unprovoked, several of my friends told me they had also had problems with this waiter before, but I figured it was my birthday, I wasn't going to worry about it. When we got there, he got us our drinks and told us everything could only be on one check. Understandable, we've got 20 people, that's a lot of checks to split, no worries, we can figure it out. He then proceeds to be short with many of my guests, and takes a substantially long amount of time to come back and check on us, often disappearing right before someone was about to order. If it had been busy, I would have been a little more understanding, but there were maybe four other tables full at this time, and they were all being served. But the kicker comes from the fact that the receipt was wrong three times. He had cashed out my friend when she left, and then left her meal on our ticket, even after my fiance, who is a mathematician, showed him that she had cashed out. He also left a salmon salad on the receipt which no one had ordered, but he took that off, so I can't be upset about that. He then argued with us that someone at our table had eaten a Cuban sandwich, even when I could tell him what everyone at the table ordered, and I knew that my friend who was sitting at a table who received a separate check had been the only one to order a Cuban. He insisted that he delivered one to our table, but everyone who sat there said that no one at that table had ordered a Cuban. He went and got his manager, who told us that his cook remembered preparing a Cuban for our table and therefore we needed to keep it on our bill. He told us he would take half off of the sandwich for our trouble. At this point, I was tired of arguing about a sandwich on my birthday, so I asked him how much the sandwich was ($12.50) and told him to take the money, anticipating that he would at some point take that half off and bring back change to me, which he never did. I am so disappointed. This was one of my favorite places to go in Andersonville up until this event. I had just had a fantastic afternoon at Jerry's the week before with a lovely waiter who I would have been happy to commend here had he waited on me on my birthday. Unfortunately, this particular waiter has ruined my Jerry's experience before, and it seems many of my friends previous experiences, and this time was no exception. I don't believe I, or any of my guests will be back to Jerry's any time soon. Oh, and waiter? We heard you complaining about us to your manager loud enough for us to hear, and yes, we did think it was necessary to argue about a sandwich on a $400 bill. Seems the customer is not always right.

I'm a nice, reasonable person. I'm not even remotely delusional about what's possible and not for staff.  When I stopped in, there were plenty of empty seats in both the bar and dining areas. I recognize the outside was full, but the weather was not a surprise that day. Were you not staffed to deal with a half-empty dining area? The hostess seated us at that table. We asked if it was available and she she said yes. She came to clear glasses and didn't wipe the table.  I didn't go anywhere on Mother's Day or the Saturday of Midsommarfest or any other example you'd like to give. I went to a restaurant at two in the afternoon on a nice day. If the staff were truly that overworked, then the failure is with you and your scheduling. People don't come to your establishment for sustenance. They come for an experience. Once you realize that, you won't be quieter than your comparable establishments four nights a week.

For our mains, I ordered the Sante Fe burger and my bf tried something on special, the surf and swine po'boy.  I'll start with the good: Nick LOVED his sandwich, and he really liked the mashed potatoes with poblano gravy. He also really loved all of the draught beer selection and whiskey menu (man heaven).  Now the bad: my burger just wasn't that good. It was edible, ok, fine; those are the only adjectives I can think of. I was hoping the poblano chile would have great flavor but it came sliced up and mushed on top of my burger. Flavorless really.

I got 2 whole enchilada tickets (both groups of restaurants) We decided to each take one map and 2 cards  of each since I had the tickets on my phone. We really liked the restaurants we visited and will be back to dine at many, Jerry's will not be one of them. Upon entry we presented the credentials.  The guy said we needed another map and we could only have one tasting. I get it was a hectic day and I thought he might be a little worn out so I proceeded to explain, showed him both tickets on my phone and pair of menu cards we had for the salt route.  He then turned to me and said  Host: Look honey I've been doing this all day and you need another map. Me: but I have 2 tickets *show again on my phone* That's just the map I have a receipt for 2 whole enchiladas and there are 2 people here. Host: well apparently somebody messed up at the swedish museum  My boyfriend: this hasn't been a problem any other place we've been to (it hadn't been) Host: well you need a second map and we aren't any other place (true you would need a sense of customer service) So I just grabbed 2 and walked away, I was done with him. Just a suggestion when it comes to customer service, don't get condescending at an event you volunteered to be a part of in order to court new business.  I work in customer service, so does my boyfriend.

Last weekend some friends and I--five of us in total--decided to get some drinks and maybe a bite in our neighborhood. We walked to several places but they all had long waits. We decided to go to Jerry's because they could seat us immediately. We waited quite some time before our initial drink orders were taken. We needed to look over the extensive drink menu. When the waiter came back I ordered something he recommended. I didn't like it but we'll get to that in a second. Eventually the drinks came and we put in our order. Everyone ordered cold sandwiches. I tried to order one of the specials but they were out so I switched to one of the Mexican chicken sandwiches. The four cold sandwiches took one hour and fifteen minutes to arrive. Our side dishes were tiny and cold. Yeah, potato salad should be cold but mac and cheese? I think not. My potato salad had two pieces of potato in it. Oh, and when I say it was cold I don't mean room temp cold I mean right out of the fridge cold. My sandwich wasn't good. The stuff was slopped onto it and the bun was crushed like someone grabbed it and made a fist. My tomato soup tasted like salsa dumped into a ramekin.  When the waiter brought our food I told him I didn't like the drink. He said I should've told him. Gee, buddy, I would've loved to but you disappeared for an hour and fifteen minutes.  We complained. Our drinks were comped. I'll never go back. If you can't serve people for an hour then tell them there's a wait. Don't charge $15 for a sandwich that looks like it was made by a toddler. Don't serve cold mac and cheese. If you recommend a drink, check back soon to see if the customer likes it. One of the people in our party is a career waiter, by the way. I'm not just on a tirade.

There was no light back there and the little lantern that was there didn't work. The host brought out a garden light on a stake that we put in the center of the table. It really didn't do much to help lighting. I noticed on the way out there was a table with 7-10 laterns lit on it. So not sure why we weren't brough one of these. Anyways.... Our server was pleasant and attentive. We each ordered a steak sandwich (Eddie H & Pittsburgh). The meat was tasty as were the sides. We shared a bread pudding for desert that wasn't heated all the way through as the center was still cold. Patio and open air seating is nice for summer/fall nights.

Seems odd given that there seemed to be only one other child in the whole place and she was already eating.  But he was able to tell us what was on said menu so we rallied, and ordered our meals. Food arrived fairly fast. My son's mac and cheese was a small bowl, served without a plate or silverware.

We were seated quickly and instantly we were overwhelmed by the size of the menus. I have worked in restaurants for 13 years and one of my biggest peeves is a overly large menu.  The beer list at Jerry's def gives you choices but their beer descriptions are terrible...one beer description was something like orange, dark chocolate, resin, coffee and so on..what the hell does resin taste like? And of the 50+ beers they have on the list, they aren't organized at all. It would help so much of they were sorted out by brew...ales, IPAs, etc. I settled on the old town abbey, as it seemed simple enough against the beers with over the top descriptions. Once getting through the huge dinner menu we settled on a burger and chicken burger. I asked for my burger MR But was told the kitchen does them medium. It was fine, I'm not overly picky. Once the food arrived I discovered my burger was well done. Again, I was hungry and I'm not overly picky so I just ate it. The flavor was there, so I would say this place is an ok spot for a burger or sandwich but nothing to send all my friends to.

Not necessary New Orleans good, but as good as I've had outside of NOLA.  For the sides we both got the pickled vegetables which were really good. My wife got the house made chips which were pretty good. I got the mac & cheese. It was ok flavor wise but was a little grainy in texture.  The service was excellent.

It's once you start interacting with the host/manager and some of the staff that it all falls apart and loses stars.  I have been here 5 or 6 times (lots of chances), and I have always had a very awkward seating experience--lots of low grumbles and confusion and strange questions.  A couple times it seemed like the host/manager asked servers where to seat me and my party and it seemed like the servers didn't want to take any new tables.  Very awkward when you're standing there listening to a restaurant discuss where you are wanted/not wanted in the restaurant.  Just seat me!  That's your job.   Once you are seated...service is slow to start...I'm talking 15-20 minutes to get your first drink.  Tonight I waited 30 minutes for an appetizer and then was finally told by management that my server had actually walked out on his shift and had not put our appetizer in before he decided to quit.  Luckily he did put our sandwiches in and they came out a few minutes later.  We were STARVING at this point and let the appetizer mistake slide...but Really?  Something is going on at this place that people are just walking out on a Friday night at 7pm.   The burger I ordered was good although it wasn't the burger I ordered, and my fiancée said her sandwich was good...although it wasn't what she ordered. At that point we would have eaten anything. We tried to wait for our check, but it took so long, we ended up having to go up to the obviously overwhelmed and stressed out manager who seemed to be having the most chaotic night of his life.

It was evident that the dining room was busy.  There was a long, tall table in the bar area that had a reserved sign on it, but the host (manager?) said we could sit there and that our server would be right with us.  She did not give us menus (my friend got up and grabbed them from  the host stand).  We sat for a bit and finally received waters.  A bit later a server came by to get our drink order (great beer selection and house cocktails look good but house wine is over-priced).  Since we had sat so long before being greeted, we were able to decide not only what drink we wanted, but also what we wanted to eat.  As the server went around the table taking drink orders, she came to my friend and I.  My friend asked if she were also taking food orders and she responded, tartly, ""I'm just taking drink orders right now.""  Deciding it was busy and perhaps our server was a bit stressed, my friend decided not to react to the tone of her response. We received our drinks in a fairly timely manner but it again was quite awhile until the server came back to take our food order.  There were three entrees and two appetizers ordered.  As we waited for our food, our drinks were now empty but our server had not come back since taking our order (keep in mind our group does love Sunday Funday and could have incurred a hefty drink tab).  When she did come by, she cruised by our table and quickly asked ""how is everyone doing on drinks?"" (they were all empty).  A couple people started asking for another drink.  My friend said (politely), ""we are hungry"" to which our server responded, ""your food will come out when it's done.""  She then went to the service well, filled a carafe with water and slammed it on the table stating, ""here is your water."" and walked away, completely ignoring any requests for more drinks. At this point, we alerted the host/manager that we would like our check and that we were leaving.  We asked her to cancel our food order (although it was probably already done and sitting in the window).  The host/manager was very apologetic and kind.  She defused the situation to the best of her ability and we thanked her for that.  The group then crossed the street to The Brixton and had dinner and drinks until 10pm.   While we understood the server was busy, some of us are industry vets and we agreed that having an attitude is not the way to get though a rough shift.",0.9946,0.853,0.12,0.026,0.48915816326530626

2014-03-18,4.0,"The stunning array of sandwiches never disappoints! Granted, it looks intimidating, but I love how it's broken down by the type of meat (fried chicken, steak, pork, etc), making it easier to narrow down your choices by craving. The most disappointing sandwich I've had there was still extremely tasty, which is quite a feat. I absolutely recommend taking the time to look at the weekly sandwich specials.     The draft and bottled beer selection is well thought out and has something for everyone. The whiskey list is great, and nice selection of cocktails as well.      What's the most thrilling for me is the huge selection of gluten-free food. Having a gluten allergy makes sandwich-focused restaurants extremely difficult for me, but I actually have a hard time choosing what I want here! It's a good problem to have.     What knocks it down is the service. I always sit at the bar, and am usually there off-peak so the bar is rarely more than half full. Yet  I often end up waiting to order food, or order a drink, or a water refill. A few weeks ago, my friend and I were the only ones at the bar. The bartender was chatting with a server, and even after making eye contact twice with us, we continued to wait to put in our food order with him. We actually had to ask him to put in our order.  Unfortunately, it's not an isolated experience.      Regardless, great food with obviously a lot of thought put into it.",0.9885,0.722,0.196,0.082,0.6008064516129032

2014-02-23,3.0,"Jerry's has proven to be a great addition to the area. I have been to Jerry's on several occasions and just recently decided to get together with friends for my birthday. I was thrilled to find out that I could make a reservation for a group of 12 but was told by the manager that he wanted to make a reservation for another group right afterwards so we would have to be done at a certain time. Totally reasonable, seeing as how it was a Saturday night.  Everyone arrived and enjoyed drinks, food and most importantly, just being there. I don't usually stare at my watch all night when socializing with friends. Apparently, we  had passed our reservation time and the next party was waiting for the table. This would have been a non-issue had the manager not come over to issue us a passive aggressive remark about how ""whoever he spoke to was told that the reservation would only be until 815ish. And that the next group was growing angry."" We all felt bad knowing that someone had been waiting but as a group we were more insulted by the tone and manner in which this all took place. Again, we were all having a great time not watching the clock and had this been such an issue, I would have appreciated the manager coming over to remind me in a more professional and less snarky manner. So to the group who waited, we apologize. And to the store manager, I will make sure to  set my alarm on my phone and place it at the center of the table, if we choose to return with friends.

2014-02-17,5.0,"I've been to Jerry's approx. a dozen times and overall it's one of my go-to restaurants.  They do sandwiches and beer, so if you don't want sandwiches or beer, this probably isn't the place for you.  The menu is rather intimidating with literally hundreds of options and so I feel like first-timers are easily overwhelmed by the options thus causing why, IMO, the yelp score of Jerry's is greatly lower than it deserves to be. Here are my tips for selecting a sandwich at Jerry's: -Get Challah Bread - Get the sandwich toasted - maximum of 2 meats - make sure there's a good meltable cheese - Have AT LEAST 2 condiments The best sandwiches I've had at Jerry's are 'wet' sandwiches rather than 'dry' sandwiches. That's why I go with the Challah bread, because the bread isn't as dense as a Wheat Bun, or even a pretzel bun. And even though pretzel buns are amazing (they are) a sandwich with only mayo on a pretzel bun is going to be significantly drier than a sandwich with hot sauce, mayo and ketchup on Challah bread. Here are some of my fav sandwiches at Jerry's: Munchy, Fried Chicken, William F, Doctor J Here are some sandwiches that I probably wouldn't order again: Buffalo Chicken, Fried Tofu, Molly B The top 4 sandwiches match the tips I have above, the bottom 3 don't.  An obvious argument is that Jerry's has too many options and should reduce their menu just to their 'best' selling ones or 'best' reviewed ones -- and cut out the excess. Sure a reduced menu might lead to more consistency overall but for some reason that's what I love about Jerry's. There are literally hundreds of options and with modifications there are thousands of combinations to try.  For a restaurant that solely does sandwiches and beer they easily could have  a menu of 10 sandwiches and 10 taps and call it a day. But they don't -- they are adventurous and bold, they have HUNDREDS of sandwiches and HUNDREDS of beers. The gluttony of Jerry's menu and food itself is what makes it fantastic.  Once you find your own approach to ordering/eating at Jerry's you'll want to keep coming back!",0.9794,0.877,0.102,0.021,0.6060035842293907

Since writing my previous review, I stopped in Jerry's for a nightcap after eating at a different new restaurant in the neighborhood.  The music that was playing was off-putting power ballads (many songs in a row).  Us, and the other people at the bar who we didn't know, got the bartender's attention and asked him why the soundtrack was so depressing.  He said ""it's Elton John Spotify, and it's just easier for me"".  Nothing changed, and the ballads ensued.  Don't get me wrong.  We were not expecting Lady Gaga to be pumping out of the speakers or even the Blackhawks game sound.  We just didn't want to be lulled to sleep.  All five people at the bar asked for their checks and left.  It was really awkward.   Overall, I have had one too many experiences where I left after having an awkward time and ended up at Hopleaf instead.",0.5229,0.819,0.096,0.086,0.5032380952380953

They had a ton of rare dark beers in and though im not normally a dark beer drinker, i had to try some of these. The place was, as expected, packed. The layout is pretty good, i really enjoyed the open walls in front, and i do believe they had outdoor seating in back.  The bartenders all had good pour technique and were fairly efficient but did a HORRIBLE job at paying attention to which customers were actually waiting to be served. The pricing was not what i would call cheap but in that area for that type of thing, i expected it.  The name is very misleading and for it, they lose a star. I am a sandwich/wrap and all around deli freak. If i was craving and i did a real quick yelp check for sandwiches in the area and went there, i'd be annoyed as shit because i'd be expecting a cheap sandwich shop, not a more expensive hipster hangout. At least try Jerry's sandwiches and bar or something. Lastly, just why in the hell is every type of sandwich combination named after a person? There are like 100 different names on your menu, who the hell is going to remember that they ordered a jackie?

2013-08-14,2.0,"What a night! It started with us being told they can't seat partial parties, which is fine. So I went to the bar (in the restaurant mind you) with my 6 year old to grab a beer for myself and a root beer for her. There was a stool at the end of the bar, which I placed her in. Immediately a bar tender comes over and says ""she's not 21, she can't sit at the bar!"". Really, are the cops going to bust a 6 year old with her dad at a bar in a restaurant? So after that I try and get his attention again to get our drinks. Literally after 20 minutes of me waiving my hands to get his attention, a dude stands next to me and gets the same bartenders attention right away and gets his drinks.  Moving on to being seated. We get to our table on the deck, which is quite lovely. All the tables are full and it seems they have one server for all of the tables. She is clearly frazzled. We quickly order our drinks and she won't take our app orders because she has ""other drinks to serve"". Finally when we get our food order in the sky opens up and people head inside. This turns chaos into a culinary apocalypse. They clearly aren't able to handle the amount of people without the rain, this grinds it to a halt. I track down the server and ask her to pack the food to go and i'll pay her. We head to the front of the house and literally wait 45 minutes.  They keep checking on our food and telling us 5 more minutes. Mind you that the people who were on the deck with us are halfway through their meals. Finally i've had it, I ask for my money back, which they oblige. Then miraculously  my food is ready when we're leaving. I'm stoked that we didn't have to pay after all that B.S. When we get to the car we find out that it is half of what we ordered, thank god I didn't pay. I remember going to the Jerry's when it was in the west loop and the prices were commensurate with the quality, it was simple and delicious.

I ordered a ""wedge salad"" expecting a wedge of iceberg lettuce with blue cheese dressing.  A bowl of chopped iceberg lettuce with croutons and bacon and a small amount of thousand island dressing showed up.  When I asked the server why their wedge salad wasn't a wedge she responded that it is ""more a theoretical concept"" than an actual wedge salad.  Regardless, it tasted terrible. I had a pork sandwich ($10.95).  I took a couple bites, scraped off the green chiles and slice of deli cheese and ate the pork.  It didn't have any flavor. As mentioned in other reviews, the service was terrible.  I finally took the check to the bar and payed it because we waited so long.  Even at the bar, the staff was more interested in changing the channels (there was some disagreement about watching a baseball game or watching a diva sing ballads) than actually letting me pay.

First off, they need to trim their menu by about 75%, as the number of options was completely overwhelming. I finally settled on the Stoner Grilled Cheese sandwich, which contained mac & cheese, American cheese, arugula, bacon and some kind of hot sauce that tasted like buffalo wings. We waited quite a while for our food to come out, and when it finally did, 2 of our sandwiches were ice cold. It was obvious they had been sitting in the window for a long time waiting for the rest of the order to be prepared.  My grilled cheese was horrible. The arugula was completely wilted and looked like it had just been thrown on the sandwich, the bacon was totally overcooked, the cheese was not melted and the whole thing was drenched in the hot sauce. If I'm going to pay $10 for a grilled cheese sandwich, it better be hot and delicious, and this one was neither. Probably the worst grilled cheese I have ever had. I chose cole slaw and herbed corn as my side dishes. The cole slaw was tasty, but the herbed corn was presented as a completely charred mini ear of corn, with no herbs detectable. Our server was either very inexperienced or very indifferent, because she never checked on our table and we had to initiate all the contact. Drinks were not refilled and water glasses sat empty for most of the meal. 2 of the 4 diners in my party, including me, asked for their food to be taken off the bill, and no manager came over to apologize for our bad experience or offered to make it right. We wondered if there was even a manager on duty. My friends were embarrassed that the place they had recommended and enjoyed in the past turned out to be such a bad choice, and I was bummed to have my time wasted by a kitchen and wait staff who showed no interest in providing me with a good dining experience.

The bread was toasted just right, the fried chicken was juicy, crispy, and tender, and the lettuce and tomato made me feel like I was being a tiny bit healthy. You get two sides with sandwiches, so I got the Mac and cheese and the grape and pineapple salad. I took one bite of the Mac and cheese and didn't stop until it was all gone. It was so good! None of that fake cheese Kraft nonsense. I only wish I got more. My grape and pineapple salad did not live up to its name, as there was ONE sad, tiny, little piece of pineapple. It looked like it snuck in there by accident. There were also some small pieces of honeydew and some dried cranberries. A little deceptive, but oh well!

We inquired about the patio out back and were happy to hear that there was seating available outside. WOW, this patio is HUGE! Likely the largest outdoor space I've seen anywhere on this stretch of Clark. Our server arrived immediately delivering menus and offering suggestions from their formidable beer list. A well-curated beer list makes or breaks a place for this beer geek and Jerry's always satisfies with a stupefying selection of drafts and even more bottles and cans. Enjoyed a stellar cask-conditioned Two Brothers Cane & Ebel and a rather tasty Sierra Nevada Hoptimum. As for food I had the Ansel A. which (as seen above) was likely a top 5 chicken sandwich in my lifetime. Spicy crispy crunchy breading over a juicy as all get out breast basted in buffalo sauce and topped with avocado, pepper jack and spicy mayo. Oh, did I mention pretzel roll? Hell to the yeah! And I love that this place offers two sides with every sandwich. Went with the greens and vinaigrette and the old standby peanut noodle salad. One very solid $11 plate, indeed!

2013-07-08,4.0,"Came here on the afternoon of July 4th with the hubby for a lazy lunch. It was moderately busy, and the patio, which had just opened, seemed busy. I've been meaning to review the place for a while, but after our enjoyable visit on the afternoon of the 4th, I couldn't figure out why I was waiting. This place is good and tries to be nothing that it is not.  First, the beer list is fantastic, except they ran out of the pumpkin selection the hubby had. It was great. It was nice to see Hoptimum on draft in the neighborhood. It is one of the best high gravities I've ever had, and I had two of them on our last visit. The manager allowed us to try several and we weren't disappointed.  The menu is large, and my hubby and I disagree on it a little. He likes the expansive amount of selections wherein choices might vary only by a condiment or topping, but I think they could pare things down a little. Also, as a ""pescatarian"" (Seafood is the only ""meat"" I consume) the menu could stand for some expansion beyond a shrimp po'boy, tuna salad selections, and cold-roasted salmon sandwiches. I think there is a fish-n-chips choice on the menu, but there could be some inventiveness in this area, especially since the rest of the menu is so broad with choices.  The sides are nice touches, but they are intrinsically a ramekin-size of whatever you choose. That's good sometimes but leaves some wanting. Maybe I just like big side dishes, but I feel like I just get a forkful of their beans (which are awesome). The macaroni and cheese is very good, and I can't resist it (I tried to do the greens last time but had to ask for the mac...worth it.) Service was a little slow, but we didn't mind because it was a lazy afternoon. I could see that it could be a concern, especially if you have servers running back and forth from the patio and the main dining area, which was occurring during the last visit. Perhaps it will get better as they figure out how to staff the patio area.  I struggled between three and four stars here, but I bumped up my stars because I have seen improvements each time we have visited. The place is less than a year old, so it takes time. With what I have experienced, this place will find its groove. It is very clear that they listen to feedback and seek ways to improve. That sort of focus is what can set apart a good local business as one who appreciates its customers versus one who seemingly has no need for them, as we experienced at In Fine Spirits across the street after our great time at Jerry's. Jerry's has work to do, but it understands that, and that sort of commitment makes a customer want to become a regular.",0.9975,0.811,0.163,0.027,0.5257138310861714

It didn't have any flavor, and hardly any avocado.  The beers are overpriced considering they serve you a 12 oz serving as opposed to the standard 16 oz. pour. Also, soda is served in cans with no refills. I really think this should be stated on the menu because typically, a soda comes from a fountain, and refills are provided. Entrees. My roommate got a turkey reuben, which she said tasted like nothing. I ordered a Kobe burger, medium. When I got my burger the entire patty was burnt to a crisp. The entire thing tasted and looked like charcoal. Also, it didn't even have the correct toppings on it. I had to send it back. 25 minutes later when the second burger came, it was ok. This is one of the most expensive burgers I have ordered in Chicago, and it was the most disappointing.

We have come to the conclusion that take-out may be the only way to enjoy Jerry's Sandwich shop. The food is awesome, it really is. I had a plantain pork sandwich that was amazing.

She had the chicken burger.  Asked for it blackened, didn't come out blackened and she said it didn't have much flavor.  Also asked for no onions, but had onions on it.  She just picked them off, but they were melted into the cheese, so it still tasted like onions.      In the end, this place gets 2 stars based almost solely on the beer selection.  The beer list was impressive, had nice descriptions for all the choices, and was basically organized from light to heavy.  I was torn between 2 and 3 stars, but the food just doesn't warrant 3.",0.9114,0.848,0.095,0.056,0.5091746031746032

2013-03-16,2.0,"So, this review is just about my experience ordering delivery. I ordered my food through GrubHub at 8:15pm, and paid for the meal (including tip) with my credit card. My ETA was 9:15pm. At 9:14pm, I got a text saying that the new ETA was 9:30, and we were getting hungry. The food didn't arrive till 9:40, and I found out that apparently my card wasn't charged and I was expected to pay cash. Luckily the delivery guy was really understanding, but he was not happy about it. I'm assuming my card will be charged later, but it just seems indicative of the other problems. They also gave me napkins, utensils and ketchup packets, even though I asked them not to. Again, it just seems like they weren't paying attention. I ordered the Bobby Z with BBQ beans and fries. My beans were cold and mushy and somehow spicy and bland at the same time; the fries were cold and rubbery. I've had both the beans and the fries at the WP location and they were delicious. My sandwich was cold as if it had just come out of the refrigerator. I guess this is how it's supposed to be, but that's not on the delivery menu. My roommate got the fried green tomatoes sandwich with fries and mixed greens & vinaigrette. The vinaigrette spilled all over her fries and sandwich, and she said that it tasted pretty good on both, but if she ordered anything else it could have been nasty. Her sandwich was also cold, but unlike mine it's not supposed to be. Long story short, it wasn't worth the wait, and I would have been better off ordering something else instead. I won't write off Jerry's in general, but I wouldn't get the delivery again. Based on the other reviews, I might just stick with the Wicker Park location.",0.937,0.858,0.094,0.047,0.5729312354312355
2013-03-16,4.0,"Who'da thunk it? The word ""sandwiches"" in the name leads one to believe that they're in for a local deli type establishment - you know, order your bread and meat and cheese and have someone else whip together your lunch order. While the sandwich is definitely an option, the name belies the truth about this place. Step into a warm, inviting restaurant with natural edged wood tables and bartops, puffy seats that invite you to stay for awhile and a tap selection that caters to those of us whose idea of a tasty beer isn't defined by Bud Light. Since we were seated at the bar, service was always spot on, friendly and very helpful (thanks for tracking down some ibuprofen for us and saving us the trip to the drugstore). Average beer prices for craft brews (anywhere from $5-8 depending on type) and a wide enough selection that we were all able to find something we enjoyed. The food menu was quite extensive, but since we had already eaten, we opted for dessert rather than entrees. On the recommendation of our bartender(s), we went for the carrot cake (described as dense and moist) and red velvet (described as light and crumbly), both for $7 a slice and served with sauce. Alas, a complete bust. Cold, dry and tasteless, we sent the desserts back after one bite. They seem to be doing drinks well, so, if our dessert experience is an indication of the rest of the food menu, then perhaps scaling back on solid calories and focusing more on liquid calories is the way to go. After all, it's better to do a few things well than alot of things mediocre...and they're doing atmosphere, drinks and service quite well.

2013-03-07,3.0,"I used to love me some Jerry's, but Wicker Park is far.  I was thrilled to hear of the opening of the Andersonville location, but after three visits I am downgrading ""love"" to ""respect but would not save room for on my dance card."" The service is often little slow and sometimes indifferent.  But my main beef is with the food--it's just so ordinary.  That is, the menu is ambitious but the execution does not meet the challenge.  Their sides are the worst offenders; they offer a varied and interesting list, but they're all so disappointing.  Herb buttered corn?  It's not easy to find good corn in March, but there was hardly any butter and absolutely no herbs in sight.  Peanut pasta salad is elbow macaroni in a peanut butter sauce.  Macaroni and cheese is the pasty, bland kind.  Ditto the ""barbecue"" baked beans. Appetizers fare no better.  For example, the soft pretzel is too dry and comes with an underwhelming mustard, while the onion ring batter tastes strongly of flour and nothing else. Thankfully, sandwiches are stronger suit but I haven't had a knockout yet.  The muffaletta is tasty but contains too much meat and not enough tapenade.  Excellent bread though.  The shrimp po boy is a very standard but solidly executed version.  I got a Nice salad for takeout and although the volume seemed meager, the quality was good.  Watch out--those blackened shrimp are spicy!  I also love that they divide most of the ingredients into different compartments to extend freshness. Jerry's strongest suit is the draft beer list, which is loaded with great choices, after you discount the typical over-representation of IPAs (not everyone is a hop-worshipper these days, you know).  They offer flight sizing so that you can try different ones. Maybe that's the ticket.  At this point, I will stop considering Jerry's as a solid dinner option, but I could see their bar as a good destination to have a few quality beers with a friend or two and watch some kind of sports on TV.  And if we stay long enough to get hungry, order a sandwich.  JUST a sandwich.",0.9849,0.715,0.177,0.108,0.5934523809523811

2013-01-31,2.0,"OK, the food at Jerry's was edible.  My partner and I ate our sandwiches, and we received what we ordered in a relatively timely manner.  But when I go to a restaurant that specializes in sandwiches, I expect the sandwiches to be, if not artful, at least tasty.   The sandwiches we tried at Jerry's were not tasty. I had the Green J, which sounds good: Cold lemon chicken, avocado, basil, aged provolone, pesto.  How could that not be delicious? Well, it could be if it doesn't taste like anything.  None of the ingredients had any impact on my taste buds and it for sure didn't smell like anything.   My partner had the French Dip, which also sounds delightful: Roast beef in housemade au jus, fresh mozzarella, olive-pepper relish on Italian roll, plus a ramekin of extra jus.  The French Dip that came out of the kitchen seemed be half way between french dip and italian beef, but a good representation of neither.  It was really just completely underwhelming. And I'm gonna give you that Jerry's might have better sandwiches on the menu, but the menu is entirely unfocused and encyclopedic.  We really wanted the waiter to give us some direction.  Unfortunately, when we asked him for recommendations--after finally managing to get his attention--he said we ""couldn't go wrong"", which is to say that of the roughly sixty options available in terms of sandwich that he didn't have any favorites or strong recommendations.  Geez.  What are waiters for if they don't have strong feelings about the food and can't help you make the best decision based on your personal preferences?!

So my sandwich was good, I can't say it wasn't.  But it surely wasn't the most amazing sandwich I'd ever had.  Ironically, the fruit salad side dish may have actually been the most amazing fruit salad side I've ever gotten in a restaurant.  It was delicious.  The mac n' cheese side was really unimpressive and bland, I wouldn't bother with it again.   And then the check came - $40 for two sandwiches, one can of pop, and one beer.  Not worth it.  So yeah, overall I'd consider Jerry's as a dinner option when I'm meeting with my veggie friends, but other than that, I won't be back.",0.9929,0.708,0.202,0.09,0.5326321248196249

We spoke for a good 15-20 minutes about service issues, kitchen issues, etc., and I feel that he genuinely took our advice and thoughts to heart.  Although it was definitely a slower night (Wednesday), our food (which we've never had a complaint about) came out promptly and our service was excellent.

I never realized that Jerrys was an actual restaurant.  I had pictured a little deli counter where you go up to place your order, then take your seat.  I certainly had no idea that they would have a full service bar with a HUGE beer selection.  What a great surprise.  After seeing the many reviews about poor service, I still wanted to venture out for myself and hope for the best.  I can honestly say that the service I had was wonderful.  We walked in, a smiling hostess seated us immediately and then our server showed up to our table a few minutes later, answering questions, making suggestions to us and was really right on the ball.   I chose the Salad/Half sandwich combo, my choices being a Brie/Apple Sandwich (my server suggested getting it grilled, good call) and the Wedge Salad.  Everything was really good.  The Wedge Salad was fresh and crispy with big chunks of Blue Cheese.  Very good.   I chose the chips for my side which were very good and my friend chose the Mac and Cheese for her side which I was happy to have sampled.  It was simply delicious.  It remined me of this Mac and Cheese recipe that I made years ago from a Martha Stewert recipe that had four kinds of cheeses including Gruyere and sprinkled with nutmeg.  This was just like it and just as tasty.  For dessert I decided on a Stout Beer.  Who was I kidding anyway, with that diet coke?  I love love love good beer.  I am not sure which Stout I chose but it was a Bells Brewery Stout, dark and delicious with almost a coffee flavor.  I savored that!  I am excited for the variety of vegetarian options that this place offers.  Usually, when I go to a place I am limited to maybe three items and I am used to that.  But here at Jerrys I can seriously go here OFTEN and not eat the same thing twice!  I will be going back for sure.",0.9884,0.806,0.157,0.037,0.5287669376693767

After a too long night on Saturday my boyfriend and I were lazy and didn't want to venture out of the house.  After looking through our options on Grub Hub we became excited that Jerry's was 1. In Andersonville and 2. That they Delivered!  SCORE.   After looking at their overwhelming menu we both decided on sandwiches that sounded DELICIOUS.  We placed our order and went back to our quality couch time.  After waiting for an hour our sandwiches were in hand.  We were off to a promising start.   We sat down at the table and each took a bite.  His sandwich was ice cold, the bread was soggy, and his corn on the cob was cold to the touch.  My sandwich was soaked through (I could quite literally squeeze water out of the bread), my fruit salad was sad and the pickled vegetables seemed to have seen better days.  Our food was completely inedible.  There is nothing worse in my book than soggy bread.   Now...having been to Jerry's I know that they make a delicious sandwich.  I also know that they aren't new to the game.  You would think that as long as they have been around they would have figured out how to deliver their food. I mean Jimmy John's has figured out how to do it right?  I think one good thing would be not to have your food delivered by bike...in the winter!  Of course the food is going to get cold!  How could it not?   So here we were....irritated, hungry and pissed that we had to put on clothes and venture out of the house.  I called Jerry's and spoke with Cassidy the manager.  She was very polite and understand and agreed to refund the entire order.   I of course will be going to back to Jerry's but will NEVER order delivery from them again.",0.9283,0.908,0.071,0.022,0.6247017367553083

We were glad to see that Jerry's opened this location in Andersonville.  It's much more convenient for us to get to from Evanston. We stopped by around 2:30 on Saturday.  The new space is attractive, with the impressive row of taps standing proudly behind the bar.  We were immediately seated at a table by the window. It took us a while to evaluate the massive food and beer menus.  The draft list is exclusively domestic and includes some brewers (the Bruery, Port) that I hadn't seen on Chicago draft lists before.  The beer was fresh and tasty, though our Great Lakes Christmas Ale was served a bit colder than was optimal.  A bit of time fixed that.  The taps were clean, but that's to be expected from a new place.  We'll see how clean they are after a few months. For food, we ordered a veggie muffaletta  with mashed potatoes and pasta salad as our sides.  The sandwich was very nice, served a bit too hot to eat upon arrival.  The fried green tomatoes worked well with the cheese and sourdough bread.  The mushrooms paired nicely with the olive relish.  We were happy with the mashed potatoes and gravy; it didn't need any further seasoning and were still a bit lumpy.  The peanut pasta salad was disappointing. For dessert, we got the bread pudding.  It was fantastic!  It had chocolate chips in place of raisins, which we prefer.  The whipped cream and ice cream provided a satisfying contrast with the hot slice of bread.

The overall look and feel of the place should allow Jerry's to do well in Andersonville, as it has that same comfortable feel as Lady Gregory or Charlie's Ale House.  Make sure you look up at the interesting light fixtures! The main problem here is the service.  It is slooooooooow.  Most likely, this is because the menu is ridiculously large, that the wait staff is probably tired of stopping at their tables just to find that the customers still have 2 pages of menu to peruse through.  The service is actually so slow that it even trips up the servers.  On an earlier visit, the food was taking so long that our waiter came up to the table and asked if we would like to see the dessert menu, to which we embarrassingly had to remind that we hadn't even gotten our food yet!   On another occasion, our server was somewhat rude and cocky.  You know that 'too cool for school' attitude, where you feel like any extra request you ask for is bothering him, even when it was something that HE forgot to bring in the first place?  I almost had to walk up the bar area, where he was having an especially long conversation with the bartender, just to get some silverware. I will say that the food is pretty good, but overpriced. WAY overpriced.

2012-10-13,1.0,"3-strikes you're out: 3 bad sandwiches in three visits in 3 weeks.   I went to Jerry's Sandwiches in Andersonville with friends 3 different times over the last 3 weeks and the numbers are not good: A total of 15 sandwiches eaten by us.  4/15 liked their sandwiches, 6/15 meh, 5/15 bad and several items returned to the kitchen.   That's less than a third liking their meal.  Last visit (Oct 12, 2012), a table of 4 guys next to us gave up and left (neglected by their waiter?), and the 3-top that replaced them sent 1 item back to the kitchen 2 or honestly I think 3 times. On my first visit I had a ""Walter D"" pork-loin sandwich.  It was cold, as in refrigerated-cold (I didn't expect that since the menu didn't say Cold).  The waiter told me all sandwiches are cold, except for the neo-classics and burgers.  Whether cold by design or not, it had no flavor (um, because it's pork and it was cold).   Later, the manager let me know that all items are marked in the menu if they are cold, he pointed in the direction of the ""Walter D"" but failed to register that none of the pork sandwiches say Cold.  Next visit I tried the neo-classic meatloaf. I don't remember it really, though it was anything but indulgent, disappointingly thin, and an opportunity lost to have a good meatloaf sandwich any number of places that night.  Final visit, french dip; meh.  To be clear, it wasn't bad, it was edible, but no better than a frozen/microwavable packaged version from a grocery store.  I know that sounds unbelievably harsh, but I'm serious.  That extra tiny ramekin of juice didn't go far enough.   I can only remember two of the 'liked' items; a shrimp po'boy and a burger (caveat emptor; another's burger was shriveled, black, and made it to the table on bread with no garnish, no condiments, nothing -- it was comical).  Oh!  The onion rings were really good 3/3 times, although different on the last time, but still good. It's too bad!  It's a great build-out, nice vibe/fun (if you don't notice other tables' frustrations), extensive beer list (true, similar-to-better beer lists can be found down the street, so....).  I was hoping Jerry's would work in Andersonville, but now, realistically, I wouldn't be able to get others to go back even if I were willing, which I'm not. I'm just saying....",-0.6854,0.8,0.096,0.104,0.5437037037037038

I loved all the options for hte sides that we could have. My partner had a philly cheesesteak which had all of its yumminess. The most impressive part of the meal was the onion rings to start. Really great batter, two good sauces with an impressive presentation. The service was ok - very amiable but I think still some kinks to work out. The flow of the meal seemed strange but fortunately we were not time pressed. Also, I was took a while for them to refill water and since I was a little hungover that caused a little stress.

The drink menu was very hard to read because the text was so small.  It's very extensive and some people might like that but sometimes you just want a simple drink - which is hard to find on this menu!  We finally navigated through the drink menu and finally ordered.  The drinks are costly and you actually pay for the Rum ($8) and the Coke ($1.75) separately for a rum and coke, which is strange and I was not happy with.

We had a beer at the bar while we waited 10 minutes for a table. Once at the table, our waitress was friendly and helpful. We ordered onion rings (among the best we've ever had), the special chicken sandwich and a meatloaf sandwich. We finished with two more beers each and everything was perfect and delicious. The food was great. The beer is cheap for the craft brews that they have and they have whiskey specials all the time. The only problem is making a decision--everything sounds so good, it's hard to decide what to get.  I frankly don't understand where these bad reviews are coming from.

The room was dirty, including our seats and table as we were seated.  The food was just okay at best. We tried the corn dogs, which are the daily sausage inside a fried ball of corn meal batter. The sausage was so chewy it was not edible. The chicken wing poppers were all right. We tried a tuna melt. It was just okay, but hard to work around the fire roasted tomatoes oozing out of the sandwich. Do not order the bbq beans! This smear of mashed beans and hunks of onion is a mistake!

The sides on the plate are very small.  Almost bite size. The sandwich was pretty tasty, but definitely not worth the $11.00.  She also got a cup of Tomato soup which she said was very bland.   Our check came and after ordering another beer, our total came out to over $60 dollars before gratuity.  Seriously, this place needs to realize that they are a sandwich place and not a gourmet 5 course restaurant.  The whiskey drink was $10 and was just a single.  My wife said the reason this place is so pricey, is because they have too many things on the menu that it drives up food cost.  Makes perfect sense!   Ok, so my wife is in food and has an amazing palette not to mention, has over 10 years of managerial experience so I really value her opinion.  She was not impressed with the food or service.  We probably wont come back here unless its just for the Fried Green Tomatoes.  But probably not.",0.9813,0.875,0.1,0.025,0.5689752567693744

It was a little more than we had planned on spending for lunch, $56, but we had 1 appetizer, 2 sandwiches and 2 iced teas and left feeling full.

We waited quite a while before a waiter approached us. It gave us plenty of time to peruse the menu.  We shouldn't have to spend so much time perusing a menu, they need to pare down the items listed.
