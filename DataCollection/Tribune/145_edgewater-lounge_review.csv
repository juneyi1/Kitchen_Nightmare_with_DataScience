She messed up almost every meal (mind you I was with a group of about 10, very easy going and frequent customers). She was inattentive and rude. Then tonight, I decide to try again.

I believe he was actually the bartender but didn't know what was on tap. Two of the meals came out 15 minutes before the other 2. It was the most unprofessional service I've ever experienced. Only one of the four meals ordered was correct. Not difficult orders... Just burgers and one fish and chips. To boot, the burger tasted.... Funky.

It was a wonderful night to be outside, and with a fine group of people, so what could go wrong? The service, or lack of such-- The food was adequate to above average. Several people ordered the all-you-can-eat fish fry, which they said was delicious. My ham and cheese sandwich was tasty, but I didn't enjoy the thick cuts of ham that required me to use a knife and fork. But back to the service. It was a busy evening, granted, but our waitress really needed some kind of instruction or a class on how to be a waitress, or maybe just how to be a nice and attentive person. To make a long story short, we were there for four hours, from 5 to 9 p.m. For the first three hours, I had one mixed drink and a small glass of water (never refilled). After hour 3, my husband flagged down the waitress to get me my second beer of the night. He likewise would have enjoyed another drink while we were chatting with friends, but she seemed to wait on one person at a time only, and would deliver a drink or food to one of our large group, then disappear for a while to another table, and then come back maybe 15 minutes later.  My husband had ordered the fish, which was supposed to be all you can eat. Well, I guess all you can eat equals one plate of food because the waitress took away his first plate and never offered a refill.  We ended up leaving earlier than we wanted to because of the overall lack of service and negative attitude of the waitress. She didn't actually say anything rude, but just seemed generally surly and unhappy to be there.

You proceeded to explain that you turned other patrons away because there were no more tables, when there were in fact 2 empty tables remaining on the patio.

I have experienced this the last three times I have come here, which is causing me not to ever come back. First of all, the entrance is small and narrow. There are no signs that tell you to wait to be seated, and it's one of those super low-key places where it would be easy to assume that one may just seat themselves. But BEWARE. If you attempt to do this, Miss Sourpuss will bite your head off and make your soul shrink two sizes. Or, if you attempt to nicely ask her if there is seating available, or how long the wait is, she will still respond in an incredibly bitchy and callous way.  Seriously, I don't understand this woman and what makes her think it's okay to be so rude to customers. No, she's not snarky, she's just plain rude. Maybe it's her schtick?

I saw the tappers full of microbrews, but since I had to pick up my car I thought I'd play it safe and have a good old American macrobrew.  I looked at the menu and my eyes lit up when I saw the chipotle grilled cheese listed.  The grilled cheese exceeded even my heightened expectations and I knew I had found a place that I'd be coming back to often. Over the ensuing nine years I've been back there countless times, including one time when a friend and I went in and ordered white russians, the bartender made the drinks set them on the bar in front of us and said, ""two caucasians,"" and have never had a bad experience.  The service is generally fantastic, although at times it can dip into the merely very good.  The beer selection is chock full of both bottled and tap American microbrews and also includes the standard big brewery beers.  The food is quite tasty and reasonably priced as well.  Also the outdoor seating area is amazingly peaceful and relaxing.   The one draw back is that the volume of the sound system in the back room is set way too high making it difficult at times to hold a conversation.",0.9879,0.855,0.115,0.03,0.41255892255892257

If you want good beers, a place to sit down and a staff that doesn't believe that you should wipe their ass for them every time they pour you a beer, Edgewater Lounge is where you need to be.  While the nearby Hop Leaf does specialize in a wide selection of hard-to-come-by Belgian beers, Edgewater Lounge focuses more on American microbrews such as Rogue, Bells and Three Floyds. It does boil down to preference, but anyone who says that American beers cannot compete with those from Belgium are either pretentious morons, charlatans whose idea of American beer is a can Old Milwaukee poured into a red cup, or Belgians. While the Belgian brewers have mastered the bold and hoppy Tripel ales, American microbreweries make their beers with a lot more fun and creativity often producing a hell of a beer in the process.  It doesn't appear to be much from the outside, but it's a very comfortable and clean place. I've never seen it too crowded or been there when loud music was blaring.

2010-11-05,4.0,"The fact that the Yelp Book Club meets here on occasion to discuss fiction is fitting since the very name of this bar contains a half-truth and a lie.  The sort of true statement is that it's in Edgewater.  According to the official 77 community areas of Chicago, Edgewater is north of Foster, south of Devon, east of Ravenswood, and west of the lake.  And this place definitely fits in this geographic area.  Andersonville is considered to be a neighborhood within this area, but any map of Chicago and the general feel of this area (rainbow flags flying everywhere) will tell you you're not edging near any body of water anymore.  And the walk from the Bryn Mawr stop on the Red Line will tell you something similar (though it's convenient to the 22 and 50 buses). The bold-faced lie is that it's a lounge.  It might have been at one point, but anyone who comes here expecting old drunks and jazzy entertainment could be upset with what they find.  What one does find inside is a pretty nice place with a friendly (though slightly hipsterish and a little loud) vibe.  They have a very diverse beer selection including many craft beers from the Midwest.  And they have an absolutely incredible dry cider that I haven't found anywhere else in the city. In reality, it's closer to a supper club than a lounge because the food here in great.  The sandwiches (I love the grilled cheese), comes with a surprisingly tasty vinegary slaw, and a pretty large pickle.  While the prices always manage to set me back a bit (no lie), the onion rings here make it worth the scrimping that is required afterwards.  And the portions, unless you've seen them, would sound like a fish tale when described. Finally, a real treat is that in the summer the patio is a pleasant, shady diversion.  A lounge with a patio?  That's almost as impossible as a dive bar with a patio!  Still.  Sure the place may lie to bring people in, but once it's got its hooks in most people, they don't even care anymore.",0.9944,0.821,0.154,0.025,0.5386604136604137

2010-09-26,2.0,"This is a beer review by iSpyBeerGuy. The Edgewater Lounge, situated at the top of Andersonville along Ashland Avenue, looks like a dive bar from the outside and improves only a little once indoors. This sort of review is tough, because Edgewater isn't trying to be anything special. If you live close by, perhaps you just want a place to grab a reasonably priced pint of ordinary craft beer. Perhaps you desire the familiar company of the local patrons. Maybe you even dig the mellow vibe enhanced by star lanterns, amorphous leave-like light coverings, green and purple walls and a few stained glass windows. All of this is understandable.  But the 70s rock is accompanied by worn, 70s furniture. The long, light wooden bar is unadorned and undistinguished. The crowd trends older. In a space that appears to aspire to a careful, free-spirited ambiance, I desired more of a commitment. A brightly-colored tapestry; a black light; something, anything ""strange."" There is a reasonable beer list, though many bars in the area can claim that distinction and just as many exceed it. Edgewater is a Rogue Ales bar, a nice change of pace, recently offering Dry Hopped Red, Dead Guy Ale, Shakespeare Stout and John's Locker Stout on draft and the First Growth Dirtoir Black Lager and Single Malt Ale in 22 oz. bottles.  In addition to the usual suspects - Anchor, Bell's, Great Lakes, New Holland, Stone, Three Floyds, and Sprecher - I was happy to see a firkin offering and, in bottles, Breckenridge's SummerBright (not Summer Brite) Ale, Flying Dog Doggie Style Ale from Maryland (not Colorado, folks), Three Floyds' Robert the Bruce Scotch Ale and Stone Ruination IPA.  Good taste won't be offended at the Edgewater Lounge - the place is clean and the staff is friendly - but I had hoped for more. Maybe that was the problem.

She stopped and made petty rude small talk with a large loud table of women behind us she knew personally, and the things that came out of these women's mouths were so hateful and hostile, it ruined our visit.  It was such a lovely atmosphere, good food and drinks, we ran into old friends inside on the way to the bathroom and they were loving it in there with the jukebox, and said they loved the beer so it's not a bad place.

First let's start with the beer.  They have a decent amount of taps and a good selection.  They also have a cask and you really can't beat cask beer.  I've been told the owner has a relationship with Rogue so they usually have a lot of Rogue beers on tap, including many that you're not going to find on tap elsewhere in the city.   The place itself is very simple.  I'm pretty sure most of the bar is in it's original condition.  This gives it the divey ambiance I enjoy.  The sign outside is faded and almost impossible to read.  This is great for keeping out people that I probably wouldn't enjoy.  I would recommend that they get a paper towel holder or hand dryer in the bathroom. The current revolving cloth hand towel thing is just gross.   I usually don't eat when I'm here so I can't say much about the food.  I have heard good things from a few different people.  One time I did order some onion rings after a few drinks.  I remember them being good but I probably wasn't in a good place to make food judgments.",0.972,0.832,0.152,0.017,0.49148877941981384

2010-01-04,2.0,"I had to sit on this review for a bit, so that I didn't get crazy subjective and start breathing fire.  1 star for the dip, and the fact they have a bigger beer selection than some hole in the walls. And for a cozy atmosphere. But that's honestly being really generous.  Drinks: For a place that's a hole in the wall, the drinks aren't that cheap. The biggest disappointment was that 2 whisky sours (even after I mixed and mixed with my baby straw) were mostly sour mix. Small glass. My boyfriend and I were considering driving down to the Hungry Brain. They make the BEST whisky sours ever.  Food: Deli-Style sandwich wraps are A-OK. Hummus - no flavor. Spinach dip - no idea what was in it, but it was absolutely delish. Tasted like re-fried beans almost but couldn't find any while mushing through it. Very good regardless. Overall - I'd go somewhere else for food to save money for their drinks if you're coming here. Nothing is extraordinary aside from the dip.  Atmosphere: Hole in the wall. Sticky tables, cramped, back room and front room. Not a lot of places to sit. Relatively quiet compared to some bars that are that cramped.  *****Experience: It's a lawsuit waiting to happen in my opinion. The one thing I need to point out is that through the back door you are walking into some guys backyard. Here's what happened.  We were sitting in the back room (my boyfriend and I). We saw people go out onto the back patio (the decor out there makes it look inviting, like a nice place to chill in the summer. Tall wooden fence surrounding it. Not a big area). They were smoking, in and out all night long.  Eventually we saw a dog, over-sized shaggy poodle looking dog. My boyfriend and I decided to go say hello to it. Here's where the trouble started.  As we're opening the door we see 2 more dogs in the back. One of them is a Husky looking dog that's smaller and looks like a wolf. He starts barking and leaping in the air coming toward us full speed, another dog is coming at us too but not very dangerous looking or anything just a big black dog. I'm not sure if it was the owner or who but he was this shaggy looking guy who was in the bar all night, runs up and goes ""THIS IS PRIVATE PROPERTY YOU ARE IN MY BACKYARD GET OUT."" and so we're feeling stupid at this point and apologize. ""THIS IS PRIVATE. PROPERTY"" he says again, ""Hey, we're SORRY"" my boyfriend repeats more aggressively this time. ""Okay"" the guy says quietly and then as he's tending to the dogs we sit back down and get ready to leave because I'm really pissed that in front of the whole bar I got yelled at by some old man and felt like a fucking idiot. I understand his reaction was from fear, but nonetheless.  MORAL OF THE STORY: If you're going to be bitching and fearful that your vicious dogs are going to maul people put a sign up on the damn door or better yet...LOCK THE DOOR. There's ZERO indication that you can't go back there and I was so pissed at the way that he handled it I called the cops who did basically nothing but I felt that maybe if they went over there they'd be able to tell him to at least put a sign up and then people wouldn't go out there. There are dogs roaming around a bunch of hole in the wall bars. It's not uncommon. I understand it's a neighborhood bar and all, but my God. That needs to be handled. I'm never going back to this bar not just because of this experience but because of the shitty drinks, bad prices and average food.",-0.9634,0.818,0.079,0.103,0.443844017094017

2009-12-09,3.0,"let's rewind to halloween night. after winning my unos gift card for third prize in a costume contest at the call, we stumbled across the street to edgewater lounge. there was a sign outside noting that they were also having a costume contest and i figured there was probably more pizza in store for me. i instantly liked the interior. it was small but cozy, dark but not cave-like; it had that great neighborhoody, corner bar vibe. the beer selection was decent and we got chatty with a couple of the regulars almost instantly (a short dude dressed like a scot and his drunk roomie dressed as a pirate).  so far so good... until we got to the costume contest. clearly the contest was set up to reward the regular customers, which is fine, but then i fail to see the point of advertising it on the street. there were 5 participants and 3 prizes. since our group made up 3/5ths of the group, and since i can do basic math, i figured we were a shoe in (at least one of us). the winner was calculated by audience applause. the scot won first prize, a girl dressed as a voodoo doll got second and one of our group won third. the problem? his prize, a $50 bar tab got awarded to the pirate, who wasn't even IN the contest! since i'm not a regular, and i already had my pizza gift card, i decided i didn't care that much and started to walk back to my table. the space between bar and table is fairly narrow, and as was squeezing through, someone (the owner?) spilled their ENTIRE beer on me. i was soaked and looked toward the two dudes sitting next to where i was standing, one of whom was holding an empty beer. they both sat there dumbfounded, twiddling their thumbs and pretending to ignore me. no apology, no nothin'. at this point, i would have been ready to leave, but the scot, knowing we had been robbed of our 3rd place prize decided to spend his 1st place prize of $100 cash buying us shots and beers. the crowd, sans the two douches that pretended not to spill beer on me, was pretty great. maybe halloween was a off night...",0.9967,0.723,0.208,0.069,0.41579939668174964

It's a neighborhood bar, with neighborhood people, and neighborhood prices. My hubby and I really enjoy going to Edgewater (especially Sunday Funday!) Of course, our patronizing Edgewater is soley bartender dependent. Christian, Lauren, and Paul have always been very friendly, accomodating, and delightful to be around. They are the reason we chose to go to Edgewater. There are a few other bartenders who are awful. If we see they are bartending, we will have one drink, and leave (usually complaining how rude they were, or how they overcharged us by 2 drinks on our walk back home). The food here is great! The beer selection is nice. The bar itself is clean. The live music is awesome. The regulars are fun. And for the most part the bartenders are good. I'd love to give Edgewater 5 stars, but I must minus one for the crab-ass mean guy 'tender, and the flakey-cards-me-everysingletime-can't-keep-my-tab-straight-lady, because they can turn a potentially great time into a drab one.",0.9722,0.821,0.148,0.031,0.5310185185185184

I moved out of the neighborhood three years ago, but I still keep coming back to this place because I work in the area. I wouldn't say that Edgewater Lounge is Andersonville's best kept secret, because plenty of people know about it. I would just say that the more popular bars in the neighborhood (Hopleaf & Simon's) do a good job of keeping the d-bags away. Let those guys go to those crowded and overpriced bars. For those of you who like a laid back atmosphere with good food & drink, this is THE place. I would have given it five stars if it wasn't for the fact that I see a lot of people bringing their kids here. In my opinion, it's a bar first and a restaurant second. Not exactly the kind of environment I'd want to bring my own child to. And don't expect these parents to tolerate any adult conversation near their children in this adult establishment. One surly father tried to start an altercation with my friend just because he dropped a couple f-bombs and didn't know there were children in the room.

Anyway, don't let Phred scare you.  Make your way over to the jukebox, where you'll find 99 of the down-to-earthiest CDs ever assembled.  I played some Carl Perkins, Elvis Presley, Elvis Costello, Alice Cooper, and Pixies, the last being the song that was played at the end of Fight Club, which the crowd appeared to dig.  ""With your feet in the air, and your head on the ground ... yeah."" Be sure to inform the staff before you put your money into the jukebox though, because they need to turn off the music coming out of their ipod first.  This seems strange to me, since a place such as this should have no need for such new-fangled gadgetry.  You know, a two-beer-and-a-shot dive. And that's exactly what this place is, and exactly why I like it.  I went there on a Friday for their all you can eat fish deal (because it was Lent and all), but arrived only 20 minutes before the deal was over because I was busy watching the original, unedited version of The Shawshank Redemption on cable.  Fortunately, my brother and friends who were already there gave me what they couldn't finish, along with the hummus my brother's fiance ordered.  It all tasted pretty good.  Cold, but good.  I don't know what it cost, and I didn't ask, because I'm a bum. We also ordered pitchers of Anchor Steam, and I know what those cost, since I arrived in time to buy the third one.  $18.  Pretty steep.  I don't know what else they have on tap, but I'll definitely come back to check it out. There's a back room too.  We didn't hang out there, but it looked nice and bright from where I was sitting.  Instead, we claimed the table right next to the jukebox, where we also had a sweet view of the Marathon gas station across the street. Yeah, I think it would be fair to say ... I liked this place from the start.",0.9965,0.81,0.159,0.031,0.4831254724111866
2009-03-01,4.0,"Came here the first Friday during lent to hit up the all you can eat fish.  Drove by this place on my way home and came to Yelp to investigate.  Looked to be right up my alley. FOOD:  I thought the all you can eat fish was good.  A little greasy and heavy on the breading, but you have to figure a slight loss in perfection when a small bar is churning out huge amounts of fried fish.  Three of us got the all you can eat plate.  We all let ourselves down with our lack of attack.  I had only two plates and was satisfied. $9 well spent.  My fiance had the hummus and veggie plate.  She said it was very good.  I am not one for hummus. DRINK:  We went through 5 pitchers of Anchor Steam.  They have a very good small selection of Draft beer.  Our buddy was Drinking Rogue Dead Guys all night and then we took a shot of Whiskey.  The pitchers ended up being $18 a piece which is steep.  Moody's only charges around $11. ATMOSPHERE:  I liked this place.  Neighborhood bar feel.  A bunch of older guys came in wearing North Western garb, most likely straight from a game.  Mix of crowd young to old.  Once we asked they turn off the Ipod and let the jukebox roll it was good times.  99 albums that would span the likes of XRT and the Drive.  Social D, Sly and the Family, Sabbath and much much more.  Back room was really bright.. we just hung out in the bar. I will be back at this place soon.  Hopefully when the weather breaks.  It is about a 1 mile walk from my place and 6 blocks west of the Red Line stop where my friends came from.  Needless to say it was a bit chilly, but we found a football in the street on the walk home.  Totally worth it.",0.9769,0.797,0.136,0.067,0.5022865722865723

Sure, your PBR has a time and a place (Cubs/Twins/Sox (pronounced 'sawx') day game).  It did win a blue ribbon after all. That being said, Edgewater lounge has one of the better beer selections I've seen since moving to Chicago.  The star of the show is four or five varieties of Rogue.  I usually stay away from bottled beer, but the list looked just as impressive, as the tap selections. Be prepared to pay five dollars a beer.  Despite this, I think there are specials from time to time. As far as food goes, everything I saw come out of the kitchen looked appetizing enough.  My fiancee and I actually ordered the home-made hummus.  I was very happy to see that the kitchen had actually washed the vegetables (not always a given).  It was light fare, but filling none the less. I felt a little left out, however.  Everyone else was diving face first into large portions of the all-you-can-eat fish fry (it was Friday), which left me all nostalgic for the St. Claire Broiler back in St. Paul. I like this place alot, I would probably go here before I went to Hamburger Mary's, so there.  The only knock on this place is that it's a tad narrow, and gets a little cramped when the party gets jumping.

Came back not that long ago during one of the hellacious below-zero weekends to meet up with some people.  A well lit fireplace and back room packed with friends welcomed me in from the biting winds and an obnoxious CTA journey.  I ordered myself the special, a $4 pint of Three Floyds Pride & Joy; not too shabby.  Everyone else had food but was getting close to finishing.  Scamming a bite here and there, I can tell you that everything was delicious.   We hung out for another couple hours around the fire, catching up on what had happened in the months since we'd last seen each other.  More beer came in, some people left, others joined us.  None of us had money for the jukebox so the Sabbath had to be kept in check but it was probably better that way.  Stayed until 1:30 when the plan was to leave much earlier.   I'm definitely kicking myself for not taking better advantage of the Edgewater Lounge when I lived a short red line ride away instead of half a city.  Bummer on my part.",0.9841,0.781,0.163,0.056,0.38255494505494503

They have good beers here - heavy on the Michigan variety - the Midwestern microbrews and regional brews that are hearty and often autumnal - even when they try not to be.  Autumn is the best though, and if it's too hot they have Hefeweiss and the Champagne of beers - which I'm always ready for. The jukebox is good - one small complaint is that in the back area it's often loud to the point of being obnoxious, especially if somebody decides it's novelty song night.  Once at the place we called the double nickel in San Francisco a bartender pleaded with a couple who walked in to please please please not play ""Don't Stop Believing"" - I really felt for the guy, if that guy was here I don't know if he would make it. The outside is perfect.  It's like a nice back porch and the hum of conversation weaves through sports, the Scene and curricula.  It closes a bit early, but no earlier than anywhere else.  I have never had bad service here.  Everybody is charming. One time this guy came and started yelling at everybody - but you know, I think it was the juke box.  I don't know if he worked there either. The food is surprisingly good for bar fare.  The cheese soup is wonderful, the popcorn makes it, but even without it, strong flavors work to complement each other - with chipotle, cheddar and pepper forging a bond of love and fun that makes me happy. I also, continuing with a cheese theme, am in love with their grilled cheese.  Oh man.  It's a bit salty, so it's perfect with beer or ginger ale. As well, the sweet potato fries are a nice treat, though I have to admit, I enjoy the fries to the point where I eschew any lingering worries I have for my heart - and I have them - and just order the fries, contemplating mortality all the while.  I suppose the solution is red wine. I've never had wine here - it's not really much of a wine place.  It's simple, unadorned and pleasant.  In short, it's the perfect place to have a beer, discuss the Cubs and find oneself enmeshed, quite suddenly, in philosophical digressions that spin over one last beer.

Show up on a Wednesday or Saturday and Johnny C will be behind the bar, pulling pints of great American Craft beers($3 pints on Wednesdays), fixing mean Margaritas, squeezing fresh juice for drinks such as the Delicious(heavenly for you vodka hounds), or one of the best Bloodys in town; but most importantly injecting you with humor, charm, wit and his fantastic music. Early evening he plays rockabilly and country such as Hank III and other real country artist; by 11 or 12 be prepared for full on rock by the likes of FuManchu, Cheap Trick, even Oasis. The other bartenders such as Dascha or Paulie also have great tunes so there is literally no need to use the rather stale juke.  The food here is simple, American comfort food. Not exactly traditional pub grub, but no pretentious presentations or $12 Burgers. Speaking of which, the burger is fantastic, appetizers are varied and delicious, cod sandwhich is excellent, and my personal favourite just for it's simple and perfectly combined flavours is the Ham and Cheese Sandwhich. They serve til midnight so even if you need a meal to find your feet again after hours on the drink, this is a great joint. The waitstaff is friendly and fun. I don't live anywhere near Edgewater, but find myself there at least once a week. Have made great friends of many ages and walks of life there and rarely is it a boring evening, even in the empty days of winter.  Beer drinkers will note The Edgewater has ALOT of Rogue beers on draft. This is due to the owners' special relationship with that brewery, and you will find Rogue beers here that only a few pubs outside of Oregon can even get. Up until a few months ago they were the last bastion of pubs you could get a Bell's beer at.

2007-04-26,5.0,"My new favorite bar.  For a little neighborhood joint, this place has a stellar selection of beer.  I love a place that has DeKoninck and Great Lakes on draft!  Friends tell me the food is great, too (as other reviewers here have pointed out).   The thing I like best, though, is that it is unpretentious and the decor is that of a corner bar: simple and comfortable.  It reminds me of the kind of place you find up in Madison (and not just because you can get Sprecher on tap).",0.9831,0.725,0.275,0.0,0.5863906926406927
2007-03-18,5.0,"This is one of my favorite places in the world! Great beer, great pub food. The Jerk Chicken sandwich is pretty much the best I've ever had. The owner is a former brewmaster, who was in on the regrettably closed Hepcats. Definately check it out.",0.9381,0.604,0.308,0.088,0.5611111111111111
2007-03-15,4.0,"This place is awesome!  They have local microbrewery beers from the Midwest and some Western states. Plenty of cool imported (bottled) beer selections too! I also read something about house brewed beer served at 58F degrees- what's that about?  I am a soup lover, and surprisingly for a bar, they have great soup selections (5 different kinds of homemade soup when I went there). I loved the coleslaw they serve with each sandwich- spicy and zesty. A half pounder sirloin burger at 4 bucks on Thursdays. Cool and hip decor. Well-behaved crowd. What more can you ask for from a cozy neighborhood bar? -------------------------------------- Update 3/29/07 Courtesy of Gregory H. ""58 degrees is what the British call cellar temperature.  Back in the day, a pub would store casks of ale in the cellar to keep cool.  Contrary to the myth that the English enjoy their ale warm or at room temp, most beers are served either at cellar temp or ice cold, another ""inspired"" American innovation.  did you try it?  Glad  you wrote about it.  cheers, g """,0.9908,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.4825757575757576
2007-02-28,4.0,"love the edgewater.  great beer selection. wonderful staff. tasty food. i've been a fan of the folks that run this place since the old augenblick days. man, i miss the augenblick. still, the spirit lives on with the edgewater.... this time around with some pretty great pub food. their chili is damn fine and their bisque comes with spiced popcorn. definitley one of the reasons i love the edgewater/andersonville area. and the guy who runs it loves rogue. i mean, he really loves rogue. so much so that i believe he actually was married at the rogue brewery by it's founder... or so he told me.",0.9866,0.682,0.284,0.033,0.5259615384615385

2007-01-23,4.0,"Am I ever glad I walked in!  The rest of Andersonville's uber sophistication and upscale prices juxtaposed with the lowball dumps in Edgewater/Uptown were getting depressing.  Don't let the illegible, sun-bleached yellow sign outside fool you.  The Lounge has great pub grup, cheap drinks, friendly staff and a cozy atmosphere.  It's my new favorite place to practice supine tendencies in their cozy booths, chill out, grab a bite to eat and stare at their cool lamps while I decompress from everything there is to decompress about.  There's nothing pretentious about it.  This place rocks. The men's bathroom was a little scary, but hey, we're men.  I can't vouch for the ladies yet but my spy will report back on that.  They only have one dessert but what more do you need besides a big chocolate brownie.  Between me and my girlfriend there was nothing left.  Oh!  This is where I first tried Famous Grouse.  It's a sweet little bird.",0.7864,0.853,0.092,0.055,0.5744949494949495
2007-01-15,4.0,"This place has a good slection of beer (as in good quality not huge slection). It also has well above average food for a bar. The beer is a little overpriced but i guess for beer of that kind (think bells and rouge) its about right. The outdoor seating is very nice, when they have live music its usually prety good and inside decure is nice as well.",0.9731,0.676,0.305,0.018,0.6065934065934067
2007-01-01,4.0,"Great selection of beer and good food. The front area, where the bar is located, can be a bit crowded due to the narrow walkways but the back room is spacious. The interior is Chicago dive bar-ish. Great place to while away an evening with friends.",0.936,0.741,0.259,0.0,0.4791666666666667
2006-11-03,4.0,"Not a bad place to spend a Thursday evening. Hidden behind Jewel off of Ashland, this place seems to avoid much of the crowd that frequents the Clark Street bars in the area. The decor is simple, the staff laid-back, and the drinks cheap. Oh, and they have candles on the tall tables. Our bartender recommended a pitcher for my group, so we ordered some sort of rogue ale. We got a little more than four pints out of it, all for $14! We'll definitely be back.",0.1511,0.857,0.08,0.063,0.4396825396825397
2005-11-28,5.0,"My bar. Comfy bohemian-type neighborhood bar that is borderline dive--in a good way! Hard to notice from the outside with its almost illegible sign and no frills exterior--I'm sure they intend to keep the place low key and unspoiled for a long time--I almost don't want to submit this one! Street parking on Ashland.  Dark but comfortable atmosphere.  Candles, xmas lights, panelled walls. Nice little outdoor patio on the warmer days and a cozy bar area good for meeting new friends.  Typical dive bar bathroom. Casual, mixed crowd--lots of blue collar and artsy types. Great place to meet new people or to just start talking to a complete stranger. The staff is friendly and enjoy talking with the customers.  Bonus--Live Blue Grass music on Mondays--no stage, they just stand next to the jukebox!  The bartenders usually bring in their own tunes on CD to play--lots of good stuff! Good selection of beer especially the Rogue ales--a few other microbrews on tap as well.  Simple bar menu--create your own sandwiches too. Try the chili! This place has a friendly feel to it and does not get overly crowded.  Definetly a good place to kick back after work or for a low key evening with friends.  Stop in how you are and experience a great Chicago neighborhood bar!",0.9964,0.699,0.264,0.037,0.5284613997113998
