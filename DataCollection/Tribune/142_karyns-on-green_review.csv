Some of it was burned some was undercooked and soggy.  The compote with the dish was disappointing as well.  Neither of our dishes were flavorful or highlighted the possibilities of a vegan restaurant.  I won't go back.   While I cannot speak for lunch/dinner options, given how the simplest dishes for breakfast were done so poorly I wonder where Karyn's went wrong.  Overall food was pretty sad considering what good reviews this place has received on yelp.",0.2006,0.784,0.11,0.105,0.5928571428571429

2015-02-14,3.0,"We went here last year for valentine's day and had a wonderful time, the food and service were great. We've been back a few times after with the same result so we thought we'd do valentine's again there this year. Unfortunately, both the food and service were not good this time.  We ordered the prix frixe for $55 each.  Nothing was spectacular but some was worse than others. The beet soup tasted like chilled nothing. I left the bowl full. My partner had the tomato soup which tasted like blah marinara he left his half full. The server upon seeing that we barely touched our soup said nothing as he removed the bowls and placed down the salads.  My salad was OK but my partner had the frisse salsad he did not like it and neither did I. The dressing tasted like chalk. When the server asked how everything was we spoke up this time saying that the frisse salad was not good. He offered to bring more dressing. The red velvet cinnamon roll was great! I got the chocolate mousse which was lumpy and barely tasted  like chocolate.  This would be the third thing that went uneaten in our 5 course meal.  Again we told the server and again he acted like there wasn't much he could do about it.  The servers ambivalence toward our displeasure at the food was not his only struggle in serving. Now to be fair I worked in fine dining as a server for several years and he was young. This may be his first serving job. There were only two of us and each time he brought the food he had to ask who had what. My partners glass of wine was empty through two courses and he was asked ""are you doing OK with wine?"" (The glass was empty) he didn't buss any of our plates until the next course was brought. He dropped the check with a full dessert that we had said we didn't like and only cleared it when we asked  to have room to finish our drinks. The seat I had faced the bar and the dirty dishes continued to pile up and in the middle of our dinner an overflowing trash can was dragged by us.  We spent $150 for valentine's day dinner two hours ago and are at home now waiting for a pizza. This is a shame.

2015-02-02,5.0,"While I am not technically vegan, I recently learned I have a dairy and an egg allergy as well as a possible soy allergy, which makes it REALLY hard to eat out. I picked Karyn's because I loved that their menu listed potential allergens in each menu item. Not only that, but the food was absolutely delectable. I had the portobello sandwich, and unlike most vegan selections, it actually felt like I was eating a hearty meal that warmed my soul on a cold winter day. The fries they served with it were absolutely to die for.  And the best part is, it's one of the few meals I've ate out in the past few years that hasn't made me feel immediately sick to my stomach and nauseous. The decor also has a very cool, modern vibe going on. Makes you feel like you're some L.A. hotshot film producer scoring a business deal in a trendy restaurant...or maybe just an average joe dining out in the West Loop. The staff, minus our waiter, was a little unfriendly. I chalked it up to them being pretentious raw foodists looking down on all of us carnivorous Chicago plebeians, but I think I'm just projecting my own fear of becoming one of them!

My other omnivorous friend who joined us, who was skeptical that he would be able to find something filling or tasty, was quite surprised, too! I think my favorite dish--which I didn't even order, just sampled from--was the butternut squash soup with roasted chickpeas sprinkled on top. It was like heaven in my mouth--like little vegan angels were doing happy dances on my taste buds. The staff was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable with our questions about the menu items, and the restaurant itself had a very elegant appearance. It was quiet and not too busy when we arrived--in the mid-afternoon between the shift from brunch to dinner. Overall, awesome experience.

2015-02-01,2.0,"I am a vegan and a raw food enthusiast.  This was my second time here and thought the first time a couple of years ago was much better.  I had the curry bowl with tofu and thought it was incredibly salty as was the butternut squash ravioli that my husband had.  And the sauce for the ravioli totally obscured the taste of the butternut squash. It could have been any filling in there and you wouldn't be able to taste the difference. The pasta might be called al dente or just hard. Salty food is not healthy food and would have been much better without all the salt.  This is a vegan restaurant and should be considered healthy!  I hope that Karyn's chef can take note of this.  Service was pretty bad, too. For instance, they asked if I wanted my water refilled, I said yes, and then they never came to refill my water. Also, a server touched my silverware and said he would have someone come give me new silverware ( I didnt even ask), but he left the old silverware there and no-one ever came to give me silverware! Also, why does a vegan restaurant name almost all their food with animal names, chicken this, sausage that. They even make it look like dead animal! (The calamari looks like it, for instance.)  They put quotation marks around the animal names but for some reason don't around the ""cheese"" (which is obviously not cheese), or the ice ""cream"" - weird. The restaurant decor is austere which is to say white and boring. The servers, all dressed in black, have a strange plastic friendliness combined with a haughtiness (as instructed, I'm sure).

2015-01-18,4.0,"This is an update of my last review. Please be sure to see that one as it really talks about the restaurant.  Update:  Alas the $8 breakfast bread table no longer exists. It was soooo good... But too good to be true I guess.  I have not made it back for dinner recently but the brunch has started to slide a bit on the experience side. In the last two times there have been issues with service from forgetting portions of the order to being out of multiple items, but not being told until after the order was placed. This, from my observation, is less about the server and more about them being understaffed during brunch hours (1 waitress from the entire place).  You may note that I knocked them down from 5 to 4 stars. With the service issues it is no longer a must-take-everyone-there place, but still good eats all around.  Finally as a new parent, I can comment on the kid-friendliness. This is a Sophisticated place... Not a place for children or babies. however brunch tends to be less crowded and they can seat you in the booths in the back so you have space. If you want to try this place go for t with your baby in tow, but plan for no changing stations or kids meals (which I would expect at a place of this caliber)",0.8225,0.888,0.074,0.038,0.39619949494949486

2015-01-01,4.0,"This was a first visit, and my carnivore mate joined me. First impressions, WOW! Beautiful and not expected for vegan food. We were all dressed up and wanted upscale eats to keep us feeling like adults hanging downtown. My review is more of what has already been said by others, very well decorated, good food, polite and attentive staff, and enough food to satisfy. We actually had leftovers. The crabcakes were a big hit with both of us. Dare I say they were the best thing I've ever eaten vegan. They were very well seasoned, and they had a nice outer texture with just enough crunch. I'd drive the 30 miles for them, or press that way when downtown. The crabcakes were part of the slider appetizer, which also included a meatball slider and a bbq slider that reminded me of pulled chicken. Of the 3, the meatball was my least favorite. It was flavored like an Italian meatball and packed with caraway seeds. Years ago when I ate meat I didn't like Italian sausage so I'm not a good opinion to follow for that. We also had the peanut butter chocolate brownie with vanilla bean ice cream on top. It was plenty to share. The ice cream tasted more like ice milk. I'm more partial to a particular commercial brand of coconut milk. This was just ok. As for the brownie, the agave coating on the plate was sweeter than the entire dessert. We sadly did not taste any peanut butter flavor. The texture was cake-like which some prefer, but I like the fudge texture more so I was a little sad about that. Still, the entire experience was well above average for both of us and we will go back. I'm so proud of Him for taking the adventure and that He found something enjoyable.

2014-12-21,3.0,"Full disclosure. I am not vegetarian or vegan. Full disclosure #2, I was excited about trying a soup that didn't end up being available. I had black bean soup. It had a nice kick and a robust flavor overall. That said, it was puréed, which I missed when it was described, and without actual beans it didn't  seem very filling.  I did get a side of home fries (kind of random, but I had a craving) and those were to die for. I'm going to go out on a limb and say that they may have been the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had (the seasoning was PERFECT). We'd heard about Karyn's from a vegan friend who loved the creme brûlée; even though we were there for brunch we decided to go for it. It reminded me of rice pudding. Very good with a hint of cinnamon. Overall, Karyn's was a-ok. I'm probably not the best person to review it because I'm not veggie/vegan and have an odd bias against meat substitutes.

2014-12-02,1.0,"I rarely take this much delight in writing an awful restaurant review so if you hear evil cackling in the background when you read this, you're not imagining.  Let me say straight away that this in an awful restaurant. My food was not horrible and neither was the service but I could not wait to leave this place and here's why.... The menu is so completely unimaginative and dated, even if they do a halfway decent job of serving up what they offer.  I'm going to from now on call this restaurant Karvn's. Why? Because the 'y' in Karyn got cut off on their ink stamp which brands all the brown paper table clothes in the restaurant, so Karyn became Karvn on every table. Hilarious.  More on the decor... snake plants to greet you at the door, tall green grass in the back, and tall brown grass far back. The overall decor and feel of the space is 'cruise ship fancy' - yes, think back to your first Carnival cruise, maybe a gentle waterfall over Karvn's initial K, the spa feel, the 'let's have a time out and pamper ourself right now if never again' moment that every narcissist craves. Maybe I can call it Kravn. (Craven)  How did this vanity ship set sail and keep going with so many rave reviews? Is it because vegans are so familiar with denying themselves that they don't feel they deserve exciting cuisine in a space that isn't a vanity project? The whole experience set my imagination running wild - who would create this place visually with such boring, bland, and dated food ideas?  If the food and the decor are at such an extreme level of cloying distaste, what would make the atmosphere even less pleasant? MUSIC. That's right. The random selections of dated pop/rap played on the channel they chose spewed ALL the bad words no one wants to hear whilst chasing that slippery portobello around your plate. No other diners seemed to notice the toxic language - an avalanche of 'F' words, 'B' words, and mmhmm girl, 'N' words too, floated at full volume through the cruise ship. This reminded me of an episode in Thailand at a hotel pool where lots of foreigners with young children were swimming and the most vile English language gangsta rap was blaring on the loud speaker. No one noticed there either, presumably because they didn't really speak English very well, and the people in charge of the music couldn't understand the words anyway. So it was again my special treat to endure a brutal accompaniment at a delightfully amusing establishment. But why then did no one else notice? Are they all suffering from a dissociative disorder that affects their awareness of all senses? Would that explain the yelp-ish love this place has gotten?  Wake up sheeple!

Then when it came time for figuring out where to have my Saturday birthday brunch last week, I was really dreading making plans for that.  Typically brunch for large groups in the city can be tough, with long waits and booked reservations and crabby restaurant folks when your entire party does not show up on time.  So I was happy when I was able to make a reservation for a table of 7 so easily.  That morning, texts from my friends were pouring in as they were running late due to traffic, weather, parking, small rowdy children, etc.  I was nervous about the reservation but there was nothing to fear!  The restaurant was calm and our table was set up in its own little nook to the side so it felt semi-private.  The staff were really kind and didn't mind at all that we were all trailing in at different times.  The restaurant itself is gorgeous, with large windows and simple lines and tasteful, modern decoration.  It was really relaxing and my group spent nearly 2 hours just taking our time to catch up.  They were also great and accommodated a high chair for my nephew, not minding at all that he was happily contributing to a whole mess on the floor.  So apart from the great logistics and staff, the food was amazing.  All of us agreed that it was delicious, including us meat eaters of the group.  Also I loved how it was one menu that had symbols next to it for GF (gluten free), SF (soy free), NF (nut free), and R (raw). I ordered the chicken fajita tacos with the butternut squash soup and did not regret my meal...devoured it!  But was also very tempted by other things on the menu when I was trying to decide...the corn cakes, roasted corn quinoa salad, and the portobello sandwich, meatball sliders, crab sliders, etc.  Basically everything!  Will have to get these next time. :)  The waiter told me too that they had GF bread that they could swap out any of the regular breads for among the sandwich choices which was helpful. In the end I also treated myself to a raw cinnamon roll and almond milk as a birthday treat, which was just ok.  Not mind blowing and I should have known better as raw is raw, but I was expecting more of a smoother creamier texture and it wasn't it.   The next time I want to have brunch in the West Loop on a Saturday I will not hesitate to go to Karyn's!  Or any other time of the week, really.  These guys know what they are doing and will relax you while serving you real, delicious food.",0.9986,0.795,0.19,0.015,0.5272672829815687

The best thing I had all night was the cheese plate, which was quite tasty. But the entree (chicken parm) was not good. The pasta it was served with was mushy and bland, and the vegetables on the side were cooked to a pulp. Also the ""buffalo mozzarella"" on top of the chicken parm was truly gross. I would just leave it off- it was very sour and not at all good (and I liked the ""cheeses"" in the appetizer so I'm not just a veg cheese hater).  Biggest disappointed was the charred brussels sprouts which came highly recommended by our server. Maybe they don't know what ""charred"" means in the kitchen, but there was no hint of char on those bad boys. They felt like they were lightly steamed- maybe sauteed? In any event they were also mostly raw. Almost too hard to pierce with a fork and very crunchy (our table of 3 all agreed). I am normally a fan but these were really terrible. They need to just rename this dish to ""dijon brussels sprouts"" because that's a better description- mostly raw sprouts covered in mustard.  My two girlfriends got the chicken legs. I tried a piece and thought the ""leg"" was pretty good. Their sides were ok- one friend liked and the other didn't like at all.  All in all I didn't think the menu sounded that great and certainly what I had did not inspire me to return. I've now eaten at all three of Karyn's restaurants and I thought Raw was the best... but that's not saying much.  Side note- Karyn was walking around and saying hello so that was nice, and I'm glad she stopped in while we were having our appetizer (cheese plate) so we could honestly say ""this is so good!"".

Two pieces of advice for when you go: ask about portion sizes.  My appetizer was larger and more filling than my entrée.  Similarly, consider whether you really want to go raw.  Though creative and innovative, raw dishes are just that--cool and uncooked.  Though I liked mine, I think I'd try something new the next time I find myself at the restaurant.  Speaking of which: l definitely will be back to Karyn's, and I can't wait for another delicious meal!",0.9966,0.787,0.196,0.017,0.5923098231133945

Cocktails were available in many varieties and were well made. Our only (minor) complaint was the slow pace of service.

2014-02-22,2.0,"I have been eating here for 5 years now at karyns. (Doesn't anyone else think she looks like Janet Jackson?) anyways, I have become very familiar with every menu item and pricing. Today me and boyfriend paid them a visit after 5 months (I've been eating at Native Foods). I'm a vegan and my bf eats meat but he loves those famous steak fries and BBQ sauce. So flavorful. We were eager to dig in after a day of work, the host was the nicest girl I've ever met in the restaurant. She asked to take our coats and we were surprised because we've never been offered in the 5 years. We were sat and the waiter was friendlier than most we've had before. However, do note as many other reviews say on here, service could be improved. You normally have to wait for a long time for your waiter to swing by if you want to get something or a refill. This, with all out waiters except Kyle, has been the same so I think it's a theme here. The guys who pour water though swing by too often, it's kind of comical. Anyways, we ordered the fries and got the Chicken legs (which are great dipped in BBQ). We were ok with splitting the plate because we normally get 3 legs  and a lot of fries. The chicken legs used to come in 4 but were then reduced to 3. It's still a pretty large plate.  When we received our food I realize I forgot to get our lemonades. But I got too distracted when we got our plate with 2 chicken legs and a weird color chipotle sauce. We started eating and soon realized the taste of the sauces was off. The BBQ was a bean dip. And the chipotle sauce was a very dense spicy almost sour sauce. We normally dip every food in sauce so sauce is a big deal for us and we have a special love for those two sauces. I thought maybe we got a bad batch of the sauce so I asked and we were told they were changed in recipe. The BBQ sauce though was a bean dip though it's still called BBQ.  Imagine you looking forward to the taste of one of your favorite things and realize it's been completely changed. I know.  We then asked about the chicken legs and we were told they changed the serving but the price was lowered. However that wasn't true, the plate was always $14. It seemed a bit over priced to pay $14 for two small chicken legs. We ordered another plate and our lemonades.  Our bill came to $50 and we just felt bad because we spent more than we would had on a whole foods pizza, thinking it was worth it because of those sweet sauces and fries, come to find the flavor and other things were changed.  I wanted to just pay and leave. The waiter was so sorry and we told him it wasn't him. He offered a giftcard for our next visit or a free dessert. I never turn down anything free. I usually abuse sample tables but I just wanted to leave.  I am not coming back here anymore.",0.9909,0.825,0.117,0.058,0.583983451536643
2014-02-21,1.0,"It was Valentine's Day. Any holiday like this is almost always expected to be hectic and stressful for anyone in the service industry. I have worked in the service industry and so has my boyfriend. We were very conscious of the havoc that a night like this can endure. I had never been to Karyn's(any of the restaurants) before. As a life-long vegetarian, I was thrilled to finally check this place out. We had a late dinner reservation for 10:30 through Open Table and arrived promptly at 10:30. Even with 2 hostesses at the desk and no one else in front of us, we weren't even acknowledged until nearly 10 minutes after our arrival. The first hostess told us it would be 5 minutes until we would be seated. After asking if we could wait at the bar, we were briskly told by the other hostess it would be 20 minutes or so before we would be seated.  At the bar there was a woman directly in front of us drying off glassware, another long-haired woman, and a gentleman all seemingly bartenders. The three of them seemed to be enjoying their friends and coworkers' company. No one said anything to us at all. During this time I watched as people next to us came up on either side ordered and received drinks. The woman with the long hair finally came over after we had been standing there smiling politely and asked if we needed help while making it obvious she was forcing a false smile. We felt as if we had really inconvenienced her! We finally ordered our drinks, two specialty gin cocktails another 10 minutes after waiting at the bar! We had to pay for our drinks at the bar before being seated because you can't transfer your tab to your table. Once we received our drinks we were tapped to be seated at our table. We were seated right next to the entrance by the waterfall. There we were not only freezing, but at this point no one had even said anything about our being sat down for dinner well after 11. It was 11:30 by the time we finally got our menus and ordered as quickly as we could because of the late hour.  We each ordered the $55, 5-course prix fixe dinner. I am limited to characters so here's the run down after waiting another hour for our food to arrive: 1: Zucchini Roll + Moroccan Skewers ($12 A La Carte) We received 2 zucchini rolls and 1 skewer. Both were cold. (Why the wait again?) Imagine a single zucchini slice wrapped around watercress and tomato with sour cream. That's what it was. The single skewer looked like something you'd see at a backyard BBQ but smaller. It tasted like that too. 1 small piece of tempeh, 2 pieces of red onion, 2 red pepper slices and 2 zucchini slices. That was it.  2: Red Chili Pepper + Avocado Puree and Tomato Bisque ($10 A La Carte) The Tomato Bisue tasted like Chef Boyardee sauce. Exactly like it. It was luke warm and about 5 spoonfuls in size. Seriously  5 spoonfuls.  The RC&A Puree was better but it was cold and again 5 spoonfuls in size. The soup bowls were nice though, we just wish they'd at least fill them half way. 3: Endive & Watercress with Raspberry Vinaigrette + Spinach & Strawberries salad with Balsamic Vinaigrette ($12 A La Carte) Both were cold. (Why the even  longer wait?)These salads tasted like they were tossed together and put on separate plates. The Spinach salad I can get from Pete's Market has more vegetables and taste than the slop we got instead. Both portioned to the size of a wine glass. 3 to 4 bites max. 4: Crab Cakes + Beet Dish I can't remember the name of ($16 A La Carte) There were 2 crab cakes, the size of a silver dollar and half an inch thick with accompanying sauce and a small pile of greens. This was possibly the biggest portion we'd seen all night. Decent in taste, not remarkable. The beet dish made up for it all. 2 small thin slices of beets on top of cream and smothered in sauce. It was ugly and laughable and tastelessly cold.  5: Date Square + Poached Pear ($10 A La Carte) This was heart-breaking. The pear was RAW and COLD. It tasted like someone microwaved a pear and tried to pass it off as poached. You couldn't even cut into the pear with a fork. The chocolate soup was cold and bland, there were no sugar croutons, nor ice cream. Just cold pear and cold chocolate soup. The date square was good but the cardamom ice cream was a tiny scoop and melted by the time they brought it to our table. There was no rouge sauce and no pecans!  The worst part was that all the other people who had to wait received apologies and complimentary bread. We weren't ever once offered an apology. No one said good bye to us or thanked us for coming. After spending nearly $200, we were still hungry and felt horrible for even going there. What an incredibly disappointing and humiliating experience. I don't think I will be back for a second visit.",0.9519,0.852,0.086,0.061,0.5500630582867426
2014-02-15,3.0,"I was kind of dissapointed, having read all the great reviews on Yelp. My boyfriend and I went to Karyn's on Valentine's Day and had their Prixe Fix menu. Food: The food was decent. I've never had vegan food, but I've had vegetarian (i.e. fake meats and such) and it was good. We had different dishes so that we could try each other's. My favorite was the Beet + Jicama Salad, the flavor was really good. I'd say food wise about 4 stars. Service: Our waiter was great; however, service times were RIDICULOUS. Between our appetizer and Soup was 25 mins, Soup and Salad was 35 mins, Salad and Main was 1 HOUR. We asked our waiter for the check because I was starving...and he apologized profusely and said the kitchen was backed up. We ended up staying a little longer for our Entrees (We were there for 2.5hrs before we got our entrees!) and then another 25 mins for our Desserts. I've been to slow restaurants, but this was appalling. We spend 3 hours from our reserved time for five courses!!

If they had said that these were Tapas, I wouldn't grudge on the price, but after five courses, I was still hungry. (Also, the timing might have affected my stomach...)

My salad was very good, but I had some order envy for my friend's roasted corn and quinoa salad as the dressing on it was out of this world. The veggie burger was just okay, I definitely could have made it myself at home, I think a better quality bun could have improved it for me... Also, what you get is actually the perfect lunch portion but my greedy little eyes thought the half burger looked sadly small. Anyway, overall it was a great great experience for lunch, but the dessert kind of killed it for me. We split a scoop of seasonal pumpkin ice cream and the strawberry cheesecake, how disappointing! The portions are quite tiny for the price, and I am almost 100% sure the cheesecake used store bought vegan cream cheese. Gross. The pumpkin ice cream was nice though.

She said that this was the BEST Crab Cake she ever had.....very Bold since she is not vegan/vegetarian and there is no actual Crab in the cake!!  We also ordered the Quinoa Hush Puppies with a Curry sauce and the Caramelized Brussel Sprout with a mustard dressing.  I loved the Brussel Sprouts but those Hush Puppies were to die for.   A very nice and thoughtful touch was that they gave me a dessert on the house since it was my birthday.  I chose the Chocolate Pecan Brownie.  It was one of the Raw items on their menu.  It was good but I could taste the Dates that is commonly used in Raw baking.  We also got an order of the Fried Ice Cream which had a yummy crunchy Panko coating and the best of all....Creme Brulee.  How do they make this Vegan style?  I am not sure but was it ever delicious.  Three bottles of wine split and a couple of Porters and we were good for the night.  Impeccable but not at all pretentious service and fantastic Vegan meal with my favorite friends made this the best birthday ever!",0.9969,0.79,0.185,0.025,0.6388575159408494

It was perfect. We ordered to quinoa hush puppies as a starter and they were hubs favorite part of the meal. Very turmeric-y dipping sauce. Very tasty side. The brussel sprouts were also excellent.

We came here for brunch early on a Sunday morning. The expanse of front windows, high ceilings, and white/neutral pallet of the interior makes this location bright and cheery. Compared to the other location we visited while in Chicago (Karyn's Cooked) this one felt fancier, shinier and newer (maybe because it is), and had a more contemporary decor. The music was played loud for early morning but curiously, we were able to conduct a civil, hushed breakfast conversation without raising our voices.  If I had to choose the best of the two to go on a date, I'd pick Karyn's Green (this one) hands down. When we arrived, there was only one other table seated. My partner and I were perplexed as to how a place like this wasn't hopping on a Sunday morning. Either Chicagoans like to sleep in hard on a weekend, or not enough people have heard how nice it is. It could also be the fact that the waffles for the Chicken and Waffles was only 3/4 of a full waffle (literally, there were three tiny triangles of waffle on my plate and if you connected them back together, there would have been a missing triangle to the circle) and the vegan chicken was on a drumstick curiously similar to the kind you can buy in bulk from vegan meat wholesalers. But the quality of the maple syrup with its full flavour and the perfect coating on the chicken made up for it in my opinion. We also ordered the Crab Sliders with a side caesar. The croutons on the caesar had a lovely paprika seasoning. The crab cakes were pretty realistic. Call it generous American sizing, but what is up with those giant ass dishes? The restaurant is full of classy little bistro tables but all the dish ware is huge and heavy and difficult to maneuver. The only instance it makes a bit of sense is with the generous coffee cup size, and then only if you drink your coffee fast because otherwise it's cold by the time you get half way through.

I had read that Karyn's portions were small so we ordered a ton of food, but we ended up with a doggie bag because that suggestion was completely incorrect. The portions were quite large and filling. To start, we split an order of crab cake sliders with a to-die-for sweet onion jam spread. I would love to take a jar of that sweet onion jam home, and I don't tend to like onions. We also split a rather large flatbread for our appetizers. It was covered in fresh arugula, caramelized onions and roasted yukon potatoes. It was delightful but after those two appetizers, my stomach was already filling up. I managed to save room somehow for our next course, the caesar salad, which was pretty good. The star of the meal, though, was the side dish that we ordered with our main: the elote roasted corn on the cob with root beer aioli. It sounds a bit strange, but it is oh so delectable. The main dish we ordered, also to split, was total comfort food: ""chicken"" legs served on a sweet potato mash with some sauteed rapini. It was definitely faux meat, and it was quite good, but I could barely eat two bites after everything else I had inhaled.

It is the height of sour cherry season, and Karyn's is offering carrot cake for dessert? This is not just carrot cake, but an extremely bad, dry carrot cake.

They have this great lunch deal - $10 for a cup of soup, a half sandwich, and a half salad.  Admittedly that's a lot of food, and maybe more than you'd want for lunch, but if you can't decide what to have and want to try anything (I always have this problem) then this is a great deal.

The dressing is the perfect complement to the beets and apples. For main courses, we've had the BBQ seitan, which is really good but next time I would ask for less BBQ sauce, or to have it on the side. The sides were also really good--savory cornbread stuffing and some sort of vegetable that I'm not remembering right now. The chicken legs are fantastic. They actually have a very similar texture to real chicken, and the taste is really good. Not super chicken-y, but that is a good thing. What you taste the most is the light breading on the outside which has a good flavor and crunch. Finally, we've had the crab cakes, which I'd say are decent. Not bad, just not my favorite. The spinach that comes with them is very good though. None of the desserts have sounded super appealing any time I've gone, and we've always been too stuffed to try--the portion sizes are good, which is another plus.

I had the banana pancakes and they were marvelous. There were four pancakes stuffed with bananas in addition to fried plantains and blueberries atop with sprinkled powdered sugar. As for desserts, we had bourbon poached white peach, lavender cheesecake, and chocolate peanut butter pie. Each dessert was delicately presented. The poached peach was very refreshing whereas the lavender cheesecake was light and very well-scented. Both of them were very enjoyable. The pie, on the other hand, was too rich for my preferences.  Service was quick and courteous. Parking was also relatively easy. Looking for healthy dining? Tis the place to be.",0.9928,0.766,0.234,0.0,0.6546491228070176

I had a delicious salad of corn, apples, onions, field greens, and a sesame dressing, the barbecue ""chicken wings,"" key lime pie, and the best drink ever: blueberry mint fizz. The salad was wonderfully light and refreshing.  Absolutely loved it and I pretty much hate corn (unless its by itself) and I also hate fruit in my salad and this is my new favorite salad! The chicken wings were spot on flavor and texture-wise, she uses wheat gluten instead of soy for the wings and if no one told you this wasn't chicken, you wouldn't know the difference.  Absolute perfection. And my drink, the blueberry mint fizz was to DIE for.  So yummy, light and clean.  You could taste all the flavors. And for dessert had her brand new key lime pie that she just came out with and it's addicting.  Could easily eat two huge pieces! Go here, NOW!",0.985,0.71,0.215,0.075,0.7746843434343433

2013-01-16,4.0,"Having visited Karyn's on Green multiple times I thought it more than time to post a review.  KoG is probably my favorite vegan restaurant in Chicago, especially for formal or semi-formal dinners.  For a more casual experience, there are a few places in Wicker Park that I may choose over it.  This is not to denigrate KoG in anyway, the atmosphere is excellent, but that and its location are just not as suited to a casual party night out. My feelings in sum: As I stated above the atmosphere is excellent.  The chill ambiance, crisp décor and accoutrements really tell you what the restaurant is about.  A very relaxed dining experience that really suits a quiet night out or an intimate gathering of friends. The menu and food are both excellent, but ever so slightly on the pricey side.  I tend to shy away from the meat analogues when they are on offer; I am not a remorseful vegetarian, I do not miss ""meaty"" flavor or texture and feel that the non-meat culinary world has so much to offer that the whole charade is just unnecessary.  However, I do understand that they have their place on the menu and do not hold it against the restaurant for offering them.  The bar is very respectable and selections are well paired with the food they have on offer.   The staff and management are both knowledgeable and friendly.  I'm never concerned about my service when I come here.

2013-01-15,4.0,"One of my best friends went vegan in the last year. It's transformed quite a few of our girls' nights out and opened up a whole new world of possibilities to us. Honestly, we were a little apprehensive at first - morningstar sausage patties are one thing, but to commit to fine dining vegan style is quite another. But I have to say, Karyn's on Green has been one of the most pleasant discoveries of this whole journey. The first time I met up with my girlfriend here, we had a few cocktails. The gin antibes fit the mood of the place - it was smooth and herbal, while the louisiana purchase was a spicy and sassy contrast. We devoured the savory and filling ""chorizo sliders"". The crab cakes were impressive in texture, very similar to an actual crabcake. We also split the risotto, which had a heavy pea flavor and felt relatively one note. Our last dish, a dessert of ice creams, fell the most flat. I hate to say it, but vegan ice cream is NOT particularly impressive. Surprise, surprise. But overall, we had a good experience and the service was stupendous. 8 months later we returned for a larger group outing. The skinny vegan was a quick light refreshing and voluminous drink. It lasted me through a round of appetizers, entrees and made it halfway to dessert, We ordered the chorizo sliders again, and  those and crab sliders were most definitely crowd pleasers. Our table was sold on the hush puppies with curry aioli in concept. In execution, I found them flavorful but ridiculously dense. By the time we got to my entree of chicken legs, I was so full and it was large enough to make an entire lunch for me today. Our entire table of 5 ended up splitting up a chocolate cake for dessert, which was also done very well, Yet again, the accompanying ice cream was a bit of a disappointment. Both times I left feeling satiated and without any longing for meat. Would it be my first choice for a night out? Probably not. But does it absolutely match Chicago's general standards for restaurants? Yes. Pick anything on this menu besides the ice cream and you likely won't go wrong. And if it's ""crab"", you're on a very good track.",0.993,0.818,0.151,0.031,0.4954361676059788

2013-01-04,4.0,"Three girlfriends and I went there to celebrate a birthday on a Thursday night at 8:00 pm. Two out of the four of us were vegetarians, so I thought Karyn's on Green would be the perfect balance for all four of us. The space was lined with ceiling to floor windows so the accent of lighting from the skyline was a nice touch. It was clean and decorated with contemporary furniture but not shabby and chic - just the right touch.  We spotted Karyn walking around and greeting each table (her cookbook was at the receptionist desk so we noticed her right away). Being that this restaurant provides a earth-friendly vegan approach there were a lot of questions to ask, such as, ""crab cakes"" ""chicken leg"" ""shepherd's pie""  and HOW? Our waitress was extremely resourceful and provided great recommendations. So let's review:  Drinks:  For date nights: There is an upstairs lounge! Crafted beer and organic and sustainable wine are offered in their versatile wine list. The best part of girls' night out is ordering a few drinks and then sharing. This is what we ordered:  Fifty Shades of Purple - Fresh lemon juice and prosecco sold me along with bitter truth violet liquor, gin, flamed lemon etc etc  Jalapeño-Cilantro Margarita - jalapeno and cilantro in your drink? IT'S A MUST TRY. One gf substituted the Fortaleza tequila for vodka and it actually worked as well. As the other gf ordered as is and that Tequila and jalapeno combo has a SPICY KICK - perfect to cleanse your pallet before dinner!  Forbidden Fruit - Whisky and cinnamon-vanilla syrup AND APPLE CIDER! This was a perfect fall/winter crafted cocktail. Black Thai Affair - Gin/blackberry/ Thai basil/ fresh lemonade and prosecco TOOK ME BACK TO BANGKOK! Who would have thought Gin and basil would complement each other so well.  Plates:  Small plates:  Chorizo Sliders- It really did taste like Chorizo! The Tomato-pepper jam was a great use!  Wild Mushrooms - They smoked the sweet corn to taste like bacon which was a great element to the dish. But overall we could have lived w/o it.  Large plates:  Zucchini Pasta- shredded marinated squash and laced with sundried tomato marinara. Eh... next time I would skip this and try the Shepherd's Pie.  Crab cakes - Boston crab cakes has turned vegan! ABSOULTY great texture! The crab texture was RIGHT on. The breading and seasoning was awesome.  Chicken legs- I love the portion of this entrée - very generous. My vegetarian friends continued to ask if this is how chicken tasted like AND IT WAS. I could not get enough of the chicken with sweet potato mash!  Over great space, menu, and crafted drinks! I would defiantly pass on the recommendation to my veggie friends and meat eaters! I can't wait to try Karyn's other restaurants. Karyn's cooked is NEXT!",0.9989,0.763,0.219,0.018,0.5424603174603173

It's a great place to have a fancy expensive dinner, but beware. If you're actually a vegan or are dating a vegan and have been so for a while there might be a few things that dampen the experience. Why do vegan restaurants coddle omnivores? This one definitely does. So much so that they went through what seems like a very scientific process to recreate a vegan version of chicken legs, problem is, some of Karyn's dishes seem to go too far out of the way to replicate meat dishes with vegan ingredients... and to make things worse they will actually call them ""chicken legs"" or ""steak"" or ""crab cakes"" on their menu. The try way too hard to make them actually taste just like chicken legs and steak and real crab cakes. If you've been a vegan for a while... none of those things are appetizing. Throw that on about $50 a seat. I've been here twice now. The first visit was great. I ordered a portabella ""steak"" and it was amazing. Second visit I ordered the ""crab"" cakes... They tasted so real it almost made me noxious I had to fight to keep it down. Major turn off... stop trying to emulate meat products and coddle omnivores. I have a feeling other vegans might agree.

The flatbread had veggies and a peanut butter taste to it which was quite interesting and different - in a good way. The squash had a grill flavor which was delicious.

2012-10-09,3.0,"I hate to give a lackluster review to a cruelty-free establishment. As a lifelong vegetarian, I appreciate any restaurant that caters exclusively to me. However, my meal at Karyn's was a severe disappointment and dare I say that three stars might be being generous? We came in on a Sunday afternoon for brunch. I would say the theme of the restaurant is pleasant, upscale food....a very open restaurant with lots of natural light and pretty spread out. The menu was rather uninspiring I thought. Being a connoisseur of vegan restaurants all over, I feel that Karyn's menu was rather bleh. I was also rather unimpressed that the orange juice they served was not squeezed in house. That's imperative in my brunch book.  Our order (for three of us): 1. Chicken and waffles -The ""chicken"" here is a piece of frozen VegiSoy (I think - i buy the exact same thing at my Asian grocery store) that is breaded and deep fried. I saw this and I was like ""Are you kidding me?"" The chicken itself lends itself an Asian taste due to the spices used to create it by a Taiwanese vegetarian conglomerate. This was served with blue-corn waffles that were not crispy and didn't have much of a taste aside from blue corn.  2. Crab cake Sliders -""Crab cakes"" on ciabatta - mini sliders. The ciabatta was extremely tough and dry. The crab cakes were OFFENSIVE. I literally could not eat this. Not even a bite. It tasted like dried seaweed with a bunch of corn starch.  3. Biscuits and gravy -Not really worth almost $10. But this was at least palatable.  The one saving grace was the side order of ""bacon"" which was some kind of mushroom protein that was beautifully cooked. Unfortunately, we ordered a second order which turned out to be overcooked and over-crisped.  Prices are rather steep, service is passable, the menu is uninspired, the restaurant is nice and the food is quite dismal.  I'm going to have to skip the Karyn's family of restaurants based on this heinous experience. I'm only giving this place 3 stars due to the fact that they accommodate my dietary needs 100%.

The tables have a brown butcher paper on the cloth, stamped with the karyns on green logo. Felt pretty DIY and clever. It also helps keep the place from feeling pretentious. There's a 2nd floor loft area which I was eyeballing, appeared to have pleather seating and a bar as well, not open at that time I guess, but I'd want to sit up there sometime. There was a tv or two on the wall by the bar...and i HATE tv's in restaurants because I find it very distracting, but my back was to it so it wasn't an issue, and I didn't hear any volume from it so that was good. The waitress was not knowledgeable on the menu. Not what the dish actually was, not what it would taste like because she hadn't tasted hardly anything, not what the meat substitute was made of (wheat? tofu? WHAT IS IT?) and didnt think to excuse herself to find out. but she was nice! Hoping she was new.  I ordered the porch swing tea (Tru Organic Gin, Journeyman Organic Rum, fresh lemon juice, simple syrup, muddled mint, mango iced tea) which was really tasty although I dont recall any muddled mint in it. My husband ordered...a whiskey flight ($18) I believe. SO good...and a nice lot of whiskey you get for that price, not just a shot of each. There was rye, a millet and another I don't recall. Great way to become acquainted with new varieties.  Next we ordered soup: I had the butternut squash soup, very mild, topped with crunchy chick peas which was great for adding texture, so much so that I made butternut squash soup and topped it with toasted chick peas at home the other day. It was ALSO topped with some sort of orange colored oil, which was also mild in flavor, and entirely unnecessary! Pretty for color but ugh, it was kind of a bunch of oil poured on my soup to no good end. I'd tell them to hold the oil next time. My husband had the raw broccoli soup, had a little kick to it, really good! Main course! I ordered the doubles with kale salad....why it's called that I don't know. But...it's 2 soft tortillas (or tortilla like bread?) topped with indian curried chickpeas. I love indian food so this was perfect for me! I ate it up, I've eaten so much indian at so many places and the flavor was right on. NOw, the lady at the table next to us ordered the exact same dish and did not hardly touch it, and refused to take it with her, made no comment on why.... my husband ordered some sort of cuban sandwich, satien or something in it, maybe bbq'd in flavor? I'm not 100% except that he liked it.  The meal in total with soup, entree and with drinks (keep in mind that we spent about $28 on drinks) was about $85. We had a $25 restaurants dot com coupon.

2012-09-18,5.0,"Karyn's on Green first opened a couple years ago as yet another restaurant in the Karyn's empire and I was one of the first to dine there. Upscale, vegan restaurants are few and far between so it is particularly exciting when a new one opens. This time, I was in Chicago for a few days and wanted to see how the restaurant had evolved since its inception. I couldn't convince anyone else to join me so I headed over alone. The restaurant is off the main strip in a neighborhoody type area. The decor is very modern and crisp with white walls and a white backlit bar along with contrasting dark wood accents. The decorations and fixtures imparted a natural feel with large plants, bamboo sticks, and a large waterfall along the wall. Above the door, a Buddha watches over. I started with the Skinny Vegan drink because I really wanted something light. It was made with VeeV Acai Spirit, fresh raspberries, fresh lemons, agave nectar, and club soda. It was listed as only 100 calories, which is great because I was getting ready to order a lot of food. :) I asked my waiter whether I should try the roasted foraged mushrooms or just a salad. He recommended the salad because he said their salads are very unique. Sure, why not?! So, I ordered the Spinach-Endive salad that had red onion with shaved watermelon radish. The radish was beautiful - I'd never seen one of these before!  The Bosc pear vinaigrette complemented the greens nicely. I really enjoyed this salad. The bread they put on the table was especially good. There was some mix-up with my order so I ended up waiting about 40 minutes for my entree during which time, I enjoyed the bread. They apologized several times and offered me a free glass of wine for my inconvenience. That sounded good to me. I ordered a Malbec '10 Pulenta La Flor Mednoza from Argentina, which was nice and light. Finally, my entree arrived -- I ordered the ""crab cake."" It is made in-house with texturized wheat and soy protein. It really tasted like crab to me. It was served with a quinoa succotash with black-eyed peas over a vanilla-sweet corn puree. The succotash was delicious and paired so well with the sweet-corn puree and cilantro oil.  The dish was garnished with chili threads, which added some heat. It was incredibly balanced with just the right flavors and texture. For dessert, I decided to try the German apple cake. This cake was pure perfection. It was a spongy upside down apple cake with spiced apples, vegan vanilla bean ice cream, caramel, and a dried apple chip. The cake was incredibly moist, the ice cream was creamy and the caramel was dreamy. I only wish I could take the whole cake home. Afterwards, my waiter, Derek, told me that they are making most items in house now and also trying to buy locally sourced products, which is great. I mentioned that the last time I was here a few years ago, we tried the ""chicken"" legs and they were made by a Chinese company. He mentioned they are still using that brand. So, not everything is made in-house, but most things are.  The manager also stopped by and told me that the chef, Jonathon Garecki, has been there since last spring. He started as a line cook, advanced to sous chef, and is now the head chef -- all within a few months. And...he is only 22 years old! Wow! I gave my complements to the chef. Karyn's on Green is a great place to go for a special dinner. The small plates are around $10 each and the large entrees are around $15 each so it certainly is a great value for the money. The service was great despite the long wait for my entree, which they made up for by offering me a glass of wine. I think this is one of the best vegan restaurants in the country. And I love their new tagline -- Making Vegan Sexy. And that they are. Highly recommended.",0.9982,0.842,0.148,0.01,0.5228535822042315

2012-09-16,5.0,"I had no idea what I was eating, but it was fantastic. We had the chorizo sliders, fried green tomatoes, crab cakes and fried okra. It was my first time eating okra and I found it to be non-objectionable, which is probably better than most people's first okra experiences. The dipping sauce, an aioli I believe, was great.  The crab cakes had a fantastic texture (I've never had actual crab cakes so can't compare) and the tomatoes were very good as well. The chorizo sliders were amazing although the bun was a tiny bit tough so the ""chorizo"" patty fell apart when I bit into it.  Drinks were great - it's always so nice to see a place that serves real drinks, not craptinis. I had the Corpse Reviver II, which was very nice, and I got the chance to taste my companion's barrel aged Manhattan. It was fantastic - I generally don't like whiskey in summer because it feels too heavy, but the Manhattan was so smooth with a great citrus punch from the flamed orange zest. Definitely worth the upcharge if you like Manhattans. Service was friendly and attentive although the bottles they poured water from took forever to fill the glass so the person was just kind of standing there waiting while pouring. I personally would have an issue with this as a waiter, but as a customer it was just a random thing that popped into my mind.  There was live music with a lot of character when we got there and it moved upstairs after closing- I think there was a private party, at which point it was easier to converse.  I had no room for dessert, but I'd love to go back and try more dishes!",0.9975,0.709,0.243,0.048,0.5707352941176471

Overall, I really liked Karyn's on Green.  Regardless of whether or not you're a vegan, carnivore, or omnivore, you'll find something delicious on the menu.  I'd bet you won't even miss the meat or dairy.",0.9987,0.715,0.257,0.028,0.5768884268884268

2012-09-04,3.0,"I wish 3.5 stars was an option because Karyn's is more than just A-OK, I'm just not quite sure it meets the 4 star status for me.  Quite honestly, it's the lovely atmosphere of Karyn's on Green (and the fact that I live right across the street) that bring me back to the restaurant more than the food itself. Karyn's is the type of place where you can enjoy a quiet dinner and a glass of wine by yourself, have a nice date with your significant other, grab lunch with co-workers during the workday, or do brunch with the girls over the weekend.  It really fits every occasion.  The restaurant is quite spacious with a clean and modern decor.  The upstairs offers a little lounge area where I believe they have live music sometimes. I have been to Karyn's for both dinner and brunch, and while both meals have been very enjoyable, I wouldn't necessarily consider them memorable.  I found the crab sliders and their crab cakes both to be tasty, but somehow their vegetarian crab has a fishy taste to it even more so than real crab.  This was perplexing to me and took away from the dish a little bit. If you are a mushroom fan, the wild mushroom starter offers a great variety of different mushrooms and the garlic flavoring is subtle and delicious.  The butternut squash soup is definitely one of the best butternut soups I've ever had.  Whether you are there for dinner or brunch, I highly recommend the soup.  For brunch, the tofu skillet was a nice choice, but most of the flavor came from the pico de gallo and the rest of the dish was a little on the bland side.  I was not too impressed with the seitan sausage.  The consistency was very grainy and very dense, and without any flavor.  I'd have to say that Prasino offers a better vegan sausage and a better tofu scramble (with tastier potatoes too). The buffalo chicken wrap was one of the more flavorful dishes that Karyn's offers.  The seitan chicken is tasty and the sauce adds a great touch.   Overall, the food at Karyn's on Green is clean, crisp, healthy, and presented beautifully.  The ingredients are fresh and great quality, and everything is prepared well.  My only complaint is that the dishes just don't seem original enough and the overall theme of the food is tailored to a more bland palate.  The brunch prices are very reasonable, but the dinner prices are a little higher than they need to be on some items.  $15-17 for a vegan entree seems a little unnecessary.  I will continue to go to Karyn's for the friendly service and the convenience when I want a healthy vegan option, but I think I will save them more for brunch than dinner.  With a little more originality and a little more flavor, Karyn's on Green could be one of the top vegetarian restaurant options in Chicago.",0.9981,0.796,0.185,0.019,0.5422945549527828

We started our meal with the hummus app. I know, I know... it sounds boring but they make their hummus with sunflower seeds instead of the traditional sesame so the taste and texture is much richer and creamier.

I had the eggplant. My friends raved about their meals. They liked them so much all 3 of us were completely silent until... I had to complain about mine.   I love ordering eggplant in restaurants because from some reason I can never have the same success in cooking it so that it is not bitter or overwhelmed by too many other flavors. Unfortunately I think I have done a better job in preparing eggplant myself than how mine was prepared at Karyn's. It was so bitter that no matter how good the black lentil and squash hash was with it... it could still not be eaten.

Like cheese. The raw ""cheese plate"" appetizer doesn't really taste like cheese. It's a waxy stuff that looks vaguely like cheese. Similarly, the wild mushroom pizza appetizer is quite good, but soy cheese doesn't really melt or taste like the real thing.

I picked this place out simply because they had vegan French toast and, darn it, I really wanted French toast! I made the reservation on Yelp (thanks Yelp!) for Sunday at 10AM. It wasn't busy at all when we arrived. It looks like a little white two story box with windows from the outside, but looks much more spacious inside. I ordered my French toast and was in Heaven! Three thick pieces of the goods sprinkled with powdered sugar and a cinnamon/ almond topping as well as some berries (strawberry and blueberry... if you're a fruit person ask for extra it's more for decoration). It comes with a side of thick cinnamon maple syrup. Dessert for breakfast basically, you will not be disappointed. Don't order the tofu scramble. Seriously, sad little froo froo food. My husband ordered it, and while he thought it was good he will order something else if we have the chance to eat here next time. It's basically mini potatoes with bits of tofu cubes, a little cup of pico de gallo, and mini flour tortillas. It was not worth $10. We shared a piece of peanut butter chocolate pie. I like dark chocolate so I thought it was tasty. Husband is more of a milk chocolate guy and though he liked it wasn't impressed. It was a bit expensive for what you get (I think $7 for a slice), but I hear it's a popular item. We did not order drinks, so I have no opinion about them.

2012-03-08,5.0,"My absolute favorite vegan spot in the city, modern elegance without being frou-frou. It's rare for me to get dressed up when dining out for vegetarian/vegan fare. There's tons of divey joints where I feel perfectly dressed in jeans and a t-shirt. Dressy jeans wouldn't be out of place, but I usually like to bump it up here. I've gotten a thumbs up from my carnivore friends, and they don't tend to humor me with lies. I'll note that they enjoyed the pure vegetable dishes vs the faux meat, while I tend to favor the later. To each his own. Karyn's really seems to cater to all, and I've been lucky enough to try so much on their menu. I'd highly recommend: Portobello Carpaccio - who knew thinly sliced mushrooms could taste so good? Planning to try this at home asap! Caramelized Brussels Sprouts - comes with a spicy mustard dipping sauce. I've gotten as both an app and a side. Pizza's, I'd recommend the Jerry's if you're a mushroom fan - If you get as an appetizer to share, be careful as it's nicely sized and pretty filling. I believe this is the same recipe used as Karyn's Cooked. Chicken Legs - This wouldn't be a fancy dish - Yes, they look like little breaded drum stick, even with the stick. I really enjoyed the flavor and texture of these. Barbeque Seitan - Again, this is a texture thing with me, I enjoyed it. My only wish is that they were closer to public transportation - but that's just me being lazy and somehow always walking from the El when it's winter and freezing. They are right off the 90, but I'd not recommend driving. Why you ask? Because their cocktail and wine list is Woot! Woot! inducing (yeah, I said it.)

However, each time I've dined at Karyn's the service has been worse and worse.  I brought a good friend of mine, who is vegetarian, to Karyn's to celebrate her birthday. I knew she would be impressed with the delicious and creative cuisine. I made reservations, and we arrived 15 minutes early. There was a live band playing when we entered, and the music was overpowering and unbelievably loud. I think the open layout of the restaurant amplified the sound. We looked at each other, knowing that the good conversation we were hoping to have over dinner would now be a challenging shouting match. We asked to sit further away from the music. Although there were about four open tables, we were told we'd have to wait, unless we wanted to be next to the band. We were directed to the bar.  For the first ten minutes we were there the bartender completely ignored us. Eventually, my girlfriend was able to make eye contact with him, and give him an unpleasant look, wherein he begrudgingly asked if we wanted anything. We ordered. He placed a martini glass in front of my girlfriend, and placed a lime wedge in it. Then we waited. For ten more minutes. We watched as he fulfilled other drink orders (understandable if they came in before ours), and took several trips to the back to restock the bar with glasses. Then he stood in the back and talked with other staff. I'm not sure what eventually persuaded him to finish our drinks and deliver them.  After about half an hour at the bar, the host came to seat us, noted that we had drinks, and told us she'd wait for us to cash out, and then seat us. Needless to say, getting the bartender's attention was another challenge. Finally, we were able to say, ""Excuse me, can we please have our bill?"". He never made eye contact, so I added, ""The host is waiting to seat us until we cash out, and we're starving"". The bartenders response (also without eye contact): ""They can wait."". Hmmm...is this good service? We were sat, and although the server was very nice, the time it took to get our food was excruciating. We asked for a bread basket three times. Of course, when the food arrived, it truly was amazing. However, our entire dining experience took three hours. We only ordered appetizers, and one entree to split between us. No dessert. Two drinks a piece total. Crazy-long wait.  I'm pretty sure Karyn, the owner, was there the night we were. She was seated with a large group, and taking intervals making rounds around the restaurant, talking with several other diners. I hoped that she would come to our table to ask about our experience, wherein I would have been polite, but honest. She never came to our table.

2012-02-20,4.0,"As a life-long and very committed meat-eater, my vegan palate is most definitely a very awkward teenager with more questions than answers. My enthusiasm for the fare here is rooted in the utter disbelief that what I ate was entirely meat and dairy free. Four of us were seated promptly in the upper level where there are only maybe six tables and a bar. Really a nice place to sit with a view of the restaurant floor below, it was a lot less noisy upstairs. The only drawback to this arrangement is that our server sort of vanished between the time we got the bill and wanted to settle up, but he was really great otherwise. We were the last people out the door, 20 minutes or so after closing time. Very big thanks for not rushing us out - we completely lost track of time over almost four hours! We decided to order a bunch of things and share; highly recommend this option as there are just too many good flavors to try! So, here's my bulleted list of things to eat, which precludes it from being ROTD-worthy since it doesn't have a bunch of references to orgasmic life-changing OMGWTFBBQisms, but I swear on my (quickly dwindling) single Yelp barony that everyone should print this out as their menu and go to Karyn's. * Maki roll was tasty, but not my favorite. I think it was a texture thing. There was a lot of flavor, and they definitely popped with a little soy, but I didn't rush for thirds. * Chorizo sliders are really, really good. A ""quick tip"" on Yelp is what prompted me to order them, and I'm glad I did. Incredibly tasty, and every bit as meaty as a ""real"" chorizo slider would likely be! * Seared tofu was, of everything, the most ""meh"" of the night. I like quinoa, I like tofu, I like hazelnuts, so maybe it's the ""roasted salsify"" since I have no clue what the hell that is. The taste was just off-putting. * Barbeque seitan was fannnnntastic. I've had seitan before, but not like this. It was thin and even had a bit of ""fatty"" texture and flavor. I didn't try the collard greens though the presentation was quite nice. I sort of hovered over the cornbread stuffing, hoping the other three at the table would be too engaged in conversation to eat any more of it. Delish. * Arugula pizza was really quite good. The crust was thin and buttery (but wait, no butter? how?) and the ""cheese"" was, well, cheesy. I went back for seconds of this one, but was too slow for thirds. * Hush puppies were absolutely fantastic. I can't think of anything else to say other than ""more, please, more!"" * Steak fries came with two dipping sauces, one barbecue and the other chipotle aioli. These went fast; they weren't the best fries I've ever had, but they were damn good. Take it from a fat childhood alum, the chocolate peanut butter pie and blood orange cheesecake are both very solid. While the crust on the peanut butter pie could have been more dense and pretzel-crunchy, it still worked. I didn't want to share the blood orange cheesecake; the size of a hockey puck, it was delightfully creamy with an entirely unnecessary but tasty brûlée finish. And now the million-dollar question: why on earth have I lived across the street so long and not walked over here?

The food is generally excellent, with a lot of meat and potatoes vegan such as the very reliable BBQ ""chicken legs"". Definitely a great place for non-vegans to feel comfortable alongside their veggie-loving breathen.

We mentioned the issue to our waitress who was entirely empathetic, instantly replaced our dish with a different side and legitimately communicated the issue to the kitchen.

For dinner, we had the Jerry's mushroom pizza, which I really liked but my friend didn't care for the cheese on it.  I would go back and get that for takeout.  We also had the Risotto with truffle oil, which had a sort of sour rather than savory flavor, and a pesto pasta w/cauliflower and pomegranates.  It was a bit bland, and could have used some seasoning and more pomegranates - since the few that were on there didn't really add flavor.  The couple bites where I could taste them they added something to the flavor, but there were very few.  We both had the TreeTini martinis, and we both liked it a lot.  So at least we contributed to planting 2 trees (they plant a tree for each one of their signature drinks) For dessert, we wanted the blood orange either cheesecake or brulee (I can't remember which), but it was out (although we were told it was the most popular, so it was disappointing they didn't have it).  We went with a hazelnut caviar dessert which the waiter described as having orange balls in sugar, and when it arrived we both thought we got the wrong dessert because there wasn't anything like that to taste on the plate.  It was an ok dessert, but not what we expected.   Overall, unless I'm in the area and want to get that mushroom pizza to go, we probably won't go back.",0.9827,0.838,0.121,0.041,0.46047619047619054

2012-01-13,5.0,"As I got closer to downtown Chicago - the traffic just became a 99 degrees Fahrenheit parking lot - not knowing the local regulations, and, in the heat - not caring much - I started lanesharing and just went through a lot of traffic. I didn't know where I was exactly - but it seemed like 4:30 in the afternoon was way too early for this kind of traffic! I finally just decided to pull off before I got heat stroke - and as fortune would have it, ended up 3 blocks from a highly rated gourmet vegan restaurant called Karyn's on Green ( karynsongreen.com ) which opened at 5pm. While I sipped my Blueberry Mint Fizz, I was able to charge my iPhone, review the maps & figure out where I was camping for the night. I had the most delicious meal: -- Roasted Foraged Mushrooms truffle chive polenta cake, scallions a la plancha, taro (pictured) - delicious oyster mushrooms and a very tasty polent cake, the grilled scallions were delicious but the crispy charred parts were mostly decorative, I think. -- Barbeque Pork house-made seitan, cornbread stuffing, braised collard greens, sweet barbeque sauce - this surprised me because it was presented on a rectangular plate and each of the three items was arranged as a trio of rectangles across the width of the plate - the cornbread was actually little nuggets (yum!) and the bbq seitan was just perfect with a Tennessee-style sweet-sour sauce on the thin (vs jammy) side. -- Chocolate Peanut Butter Pie - rich chocolate & peanut butter, pretzel-agave crust, cashew coconut cream - it was more delicious than it sounds - and totally decadent! The food was excellent and while I do not look forward to ever spending another second in Chicago freeway traffic, I would gladly return to try Karyn's again.  The interior is elegant and spare - with simple white cloth covered tables, a long bar and great big windows to let in light off the street.   Service was impeccable and for the quality of food - my tab including tip was around $50 - not at all bad by San Francisco standards, ymmv (and if you're going to complain - go back to the Midwest, you don't deserve Karyn's!).",0.9966,0.812,0.169,0.019,0.5956435006435006
2012-01-06,2.0,"UPDATE (2/6/12): I was contacted by the manager, who offered apologies and amends for my friend and I. His outreach in this matter is appreciated. _____________________________________________________________ I decided to take a close friend out to dinner this week for her birthday. Since she likes Karyn's restaurants, I thought this was a good gift. I was wrong, as the execution of the food and one aspect of the service were pretty terrible. A Travelzoo voucher (of $57 value) was used to garner us a shared appetizer or pizza, two large plates, and a shared dessert. We chose the following: - MAKI ROLLS ($10): It was decent. The rice was a bit undercooked. My friend agreed, adding that the faux nori was too thick. I felt the wasabi and ginger provided was miniscule and barely enough to share. Luckily, my friend didn't want ginger. - We both ordered CRAB CAKES, which came with black-eyed peas and extras (maybe $14 each):  I tasted the peas first. They seemed a bit undercooked (or dry) as well. Then, my friend told me ""GO!"" in terms of tasting the crab cake. I'm not sure what seasoning they did on this faux fish, but it was pretty sour and not appetizing at all. My response to her ""How is it?"" was, ""Strange."" She took a large bite of hers and then preceded to try to fight her gag reflex. Since I didn't see an enjoyable outcome from muscling through the large plate and obviously my friend wasn't going to try another bite, I had to respond to the waitress that eating the crab cakes wasn't going to happen. She was very accommodating and said that we could order something else without affecting the bill. - This time my friend ordered the soup special, which was some type of special SUNCHOKE SOUP ($7), while I went with the BUTTERNUT SQUASH RISOTTO ($13 or $14): She didn't enjoy the soup, as she said the sunchoke flavor was way too strong and we could both see a layer of oil on top. I didn't really enjoy the risotto because it was soupy, mushy, and came in a very large UFO-shaped dish that had concave sides. Such presentation and quality was not very conducive to eating, as I was given a fork.  We were over two hours into the meal, so we decided to just let this go. - CHOCOLATE-PEANUT BUTTER PIE ($8): We thought this was a safe bet. Unfortunately, it wasn't as expected. We both anticipated layers, but instead the chocolate & peanut butter were mixed together. The pretzel-agave crust was not enjoyed. The coconut-cashew cream and chocolate chip cookie aspect were good. I think the flavor combinations were off on this one. Note that our table had no less than three different servers, including the waitress. No names were offered. When the bill arrived, I noticed a mistake in the total. I notified the waitress of the problem and that I'd like to take another look at the voucher. She said that the manager would come to our table with it. He did. Lo and behold, the manager was the one who had served our entrees.  Without saying anything, he did some type of magic trick? He quickly snatched one black bill book and switched it with the one in his hand, then stood there.  After a few shocked seconds, I had to point to the new black book and ask, ""What is this?"" His response was that since he'd made a mistake when comping our crab cakes and the book in front of me contained the corrected version. Oooookay. I asked, ""Is that my voucher? Can I take a look at it?"" He gave it to me and I re-checked the calculations. There was more snatching action with the voucher and bill. I haven't had an encounter like that in a restaurant ever. The entire barely-a-conversation had notes of displeasure and disdain, which I didn't appreciate. The other service staff were extra pleasant though. Yet I don't plan to return. Incidentally, another friend was there with his girlfriend for a likely anniversary dinner. I hope they had a much better experience.",0.9888,0.796,0.129,0.076,0.5442248297511455

I had no idea what to expect from this place, because most Vegan places I've ever been to have been ""hipster"" or ""indie.""  Well this one was way different.  it was modern and hip, and an extremely nice space.  I was very impressed, but of course the food should speak for itself usually, right?

I noticed that the chipotle sauce was put on the wrong side of the bun, it was smothered on the bun and the bun was facing downwards into the dish, which made it kinda messy to eat ( but maybe its a cool innovative food thing that i'm not aware of). ENTREE- i ordered the chicken w/yukon potatoes and the bf ordered the mushroom steak. Tyler heard- bbq pork and mushroom steak. So, out came bbq pork and mushroom steak. When i told him it was the wrong entree, he was polite, apologized and took my plate away, so he could re-put in the order.  NOW,here's my beef with the place ( haha, i made a funny) :-  If there are 2 people at a table, and one person's order is messed up and therefore has to be taken back, , please then offer to take my partner's food off the table, so it doesn't sit there and get cold. Then, either replace it or heat it up so that we can both eat together on our anniversary and he doesn't have to watch his 15$ plate go cold.  ALSO, please offer the messed up dish on the house. A chain such as Applebees and TGI Fridays will do that, so why not Karyn's on the Green, they should attempt to out do any chain. My chicken was pretty okay- crispy on the outside and very juicy on the inside, but i didnt know it was fried. So suggestion- maybe put that description on the menu. Secondly, the plate was supposed to come with sauteed string beans, but it came out with spinach /collard greens instead. Thirdly,  the bf's food was cold, but he liked his steak, but according to him, it tasted nothing like steak. The mashed potatoes were not quite redeeming of the experience, but were pretty good for being vegan i must say. I understand that its very difficult to make vegan food stay moist and have flavor, but i've been to a few vegan places, of a bit lower ""standard"" and they have tasted better than this. Service in general was very consistent, our water was constantly replenished by servers around . I would have given it 3 stars. But i would have accepted these mistakes from a random chain restaurant, not from a place like Karyn's and most definitely not on our anniversary. I know my review goes against a majority of reviews. Sorry Karyns,  we really wanted to give you a chance and wanted to be wow-ed. If you see this, please give your server clear instructions as to how to take care of a customer if their order is not put in appropriately.",0.9961,0.803,0.143,0.054,0.5204741379310346

The place certainly doesn't give off the veggie vibe.   The walls aren't covered in obnoxious homemade green graffiti-art.   There aren't pictures of peace signs nor rainbows.  The wait staff aren't covered in tribal tattoos.   There's no olfactory resonance of patchouli.   They don't make you feel guilty for living in the real world. The food is incredibly well explained, well prepared and relatively delicious.   The appetizers were particularly good.   Mushroom wonderful amazing. An excellent beer and wine list. So why only three stars? We loved almost everything about this restaurant. Except....   (A) One of our entrees was absolutely terrible.  Not just bad,  terrible.   It was as if they had mistaken the vegetables with vomit. (B) Both of us were unquestionably poisoned during this evening.   Perhaps it was a part of some sort of evil vegan plot... but to say the least it was a LONG night of brutal aftermath for each of us.   The kind of thing that unfortunately could NOT have been a simple coincidence.    The bottom line.

2011-11-12,4.0,"So delicious! I went here for some gab and catch up time with an old friend while I was in town visiting. I was in need of quality vegan and this place hit the spot. The first thing our server told us was that everything on the menu was completely vegan. Sigh...it was so nice not to have to think about each item on the menu and to be able to order with confidence.   The ambiance was perfect -- a gem tucked away on a side street in the West Loop. Clean white walls and river rocks at the entrance with wide open windows and a design that allows for private seating even though the tables are not really separated from one another. Our server Tyler owned the night and worked really well with our tendency to get carried away in conversation. He was patient and made helpful suggestions and rocked the balance between unobtrusive and always-at-hand really well.  I had the new prix fix menu -- four courses plus dessert for $40. The dishes were all resized so that I didn't fill up on any one item and I wasn't button-popping stuffed when we walked away from the table, but satisfied. The shitake mushroom starter was probably my favorite item. The mushrooms were the perfect texture; they held just the right amount of flavor, a sort of light ginger soy sauce blend, and the right amount of bite. The butternut squash soup was a little less sweet than I usually like it, but the texture was spot on. It was just thick enough to work well with bread, but not so thick it felt like pudding. I was initially worried about the brussel sprout salad and almost didn't order the prix fix menu because of that very item, but Tyler reassured me that it was actually quite tasty so I went out on a limb. Until last night I had never tasted a brussel spout I liked, but apparently raw brussel sprouts with apple slivers and an uber light drizzle of a dressing appeals to my palate. Who knew? Tyler was right, it was quite good. The squash-filled pasta with gravy style sauce was also surprisingly tasty. Dessert was a warm baked cinnamon donut with a coffee flavored gelato/ice cream. Loved the donut, but I think it might pair better with a warm vegan honey or light cream than with the coffee gelato/ice cream.

Our first course was a brussel sprout leaf cold salad, with a blood orange vinigrette. SO GOOD! I could have ordered it as an entree and been completely satisfied. The toasted cashews, apples and grapes tied everything together perfectly. Next we had crab cake sliders and chorizo sliders. My mom was shocked at the texture imitation of the crab cakes (""How do they DO that?!""). And the chorizo sliders were the perfect amount of spicy-ness, and packed with flavor. Next we had the chicken legs and BBQ seitan with a side of spinach and cornbread stuffing. The BBQ seitan was the best I've ever had. Nice and juicy, and the texture was spot on, not to mention that All-American BBQ taste! The chicken legs, as always, were delicious. My mom couldn't believe the texture on that either. She said she wouldn't have known the difference - and that's a huge deal coming from my mom. Lastly, we had a dessert plate with a vanilla bean ice cream, pumpkin cheesecake, and a chocolate peanut butter cake. I would have asked for seconds if I wasn't so stuffed at that point.

It worked out pretty well because he really liked what he picked and I really liked what I picked - I actually can't wait to go back here again solely based on the sliders...so good! We then both picked a soup - hubby the Roasted Carrot Potato Leek and me the Butternut Squash. The soups were good, but I admit we both probably should have passed on that course to leave more room for the entrees.

I don't normally dine at such fine establishments when I am traveling solo, but I couldn't pass up the chance to experience a local, upscale vegan restaurant in the Windy City.  I sat at the bar, taking in the scenery and studying the menu.  Look real close, and there I am next to Buddha himself.  I could not make up my mind on what to order.  Normally I have one or two options to choose when I dine out,  but Karyn's had a full vegan menu.  I wasn't feeling very well, so I stayed away from the large plates - Barbeque ""Pork"" or Buffalo ""Chicken.""  I did see some large plates being delivered and large they were.  Karyn's does not skimp on the food.  After discussing things with my waiter, I decided on the Kale Slaw from the salads section and a Maki sushi roll from the small plates.  When my food arrived, my eyes quickly grew.  There was no way I was going to be able to eat all that food.   This was definitely not a small plate meal by my standards.  First up was the Maki roll. This sushi roll was light and refreshing, nothing too special, but the mango and avocado combo added a nice creamy-tart touch to the roll.  The chipotle aioli was a nice change to the typical soy sauce for a dipper.  I ate a few rolls and pushed it to the side to make room for the kale slaw.  When that arrived, it was overflowing the kale goodness. Unfortunately, the sesame vinaigrette really overpowered this salad.  The apple and cashews did add a nice touch to the slaw, but again, the dressing really saturated the salad leaving what could be a nice light dish, very heavy. I enjoyed the ambiance and dining experience at Karyn's.  Next time I'll come hungry, and try an entrée.  Eat well, Carolyn",0.9846,0.833,0.118,0.049,0.5293367346938774

The ambiance is upscale, but paper towels, battery operated candles, and a big screen television seem a little out of place in an upscale vegan restaurant that is trying to be environmentally friendly.

Seriously. I suggested this wasn't a credit card issue, but humored her and gave her another card, which of course didn't work either for the same reason - why would anyone think that not being able to obtain a dial tone is a credit card problem rather than a problem with the phones?

Please go there because if it is always as empty as it has been the multiple times I visited, this place cannot survive much longer. FOOD: 4 I've only been here for brunch (FOUR TIMES) so my comments are only about brunch menu. The food is just plain good, and easily could pass for carnivore meal if you chose to pretend with your guests.  French toast is fantastic as are the banana pancakes. The chicken and waffle are amazing, with a chicken ""drumstick"" that has great texture and flavor and even my uber-carnivorous Dad loved it. The biscuits with gravy ... orgasmic.  I could order a dozen of the biscuits and hang out with Netflix all day. SERVICE: 3 Friendly but off. The servers are great but there are two people that have been there every time that have never greeted, spoken, or acknowledged me. There is a guy that must be a manager that saw us at the door and did not say anything while we waited about 5 minutes. The bartender also saw us and did nothing. And this has been common. Each time we have gone, with reservations, we have waited at the host station awkwardly feeling as if we had walked in on a private dinner party. DECOR: 4 Beautiful open space that has not changed much since the days this place was Butter. Great place to have brunch with friends. Open, airy, and clean restaurant that has minimal noise, though not sure if this is due to the VERY low number of customers. VALUE: 5 You'll have a better breakfast here than most brunch spots in the city and your bill will be the same or less. My Dad even said he would go here before going back to Denny (gasp). Most brunch items are about $10 so you and a friend could dine with coffee and juice for under $40 including tip and taxes.",0.9952,0.78,0.183,0.037,0.5585617499032134

Karyn's on Green, however, blew them out of the water.  The cocktails were stellar - I stuck to mimosas, but my fiance loved his drink as well. I ordered the biscuits and mushroom gravy with a side of the mushroom bacon, which I'm pretty sure repaired years of scarring from that awful grocery store vegan ""bacon."" The biscuits and gravy were so good that when I finished, my fiance ate the rest of the gravy out of the bowl with a spoon. Seriously delicious.

The first thing was trying to find it on a ""SIDE"" STREET behind all of the GREEK TOWN restaurants. I would have driven right past it if it wasn't for the 'TWO"" customers sitting outside!! Anyways. I went inside and the restaurant was BEAUTIFUL! So i was excited! Now the first bad feeling i had was when there was a book right at the door which said: ""SOAK MY NUTS!!"" YIKES! Being a male, you know where my mind went first and I said ewwwh!! LOL! This didn't make me think at all about food! Duh!  So i still ordered from the menu written on a paperbag?? anyways, after looking at the expensive menu prices, I ordered multiple items to take home and try. I ordered first the crab cakes slider & chorizo sliders. Seeing that there was only 1 couple in this huge restaurant i came to the conclusion that my crab and chorizo sliders were PRE-MADE and left over probably from the LUNCH menu. they were cold and the SIZE was so SMALL that it made a white castle hamburger look like a whopper? good grief! BUT in fairness to the taste, the CRAB CAKE slider's TASTE was EXCELLENT! the chorizo was NOT! Oh how great the Crab slider probably is when it is HOT AND FRESH, hint hint hint?  Plus the bun, was TOO HARD to eat, i had to lick off the relish off both sliders. Darn! the PORTABELLA STEAKS were too small for the price and the fingerling potatoes were so darn DRY & NOT EDIBLE!  Again, leftovers not worth the price and serve in such a large tray to mock you at how small the meal actually was.   Lastly I had the Buffalo chicken wrap. which was RIDICULOUS.. the small chicken like crumbly things were fried and tasteless, no buffalo sauce was found anywhere in the wrap, and the wrap was really a tomato and vegetable wrap with a HINT of buffalo crumble stuff, i had to throw it away?? OVERALL, I started thinking about the show GORDON RAMSAY'S KITCHEN NIGHTMARES while I was eating and saying that this restaurant's owner needs a reality check!!

We went on a Saturday night had hummus and beet carpaccio to start, then french onion soup, butternut squash soup, and arugula salad.

2011-05-14,4.0,"I am not usually a brunch person. I like my meals clearly separated into their respective categories. While I sometimes get the pancake jones and do breakfast for dinner, in general I avoid crazy meal mishmashes. Well, Karyn's on Green changed my mind! We arrived at noon and were seated with no wait. The brunch menu had too many delicious-sounding things on it for me to bypass it and order a proper lunch food, like a sandwich. I was even torn between the biscuits and gravy (a childhood family favorite I haven't tasted in over a decade) and the chicken and waffles. The waitress helpfully assisted me in my decision, explaining to me that the chicken and waffles was a larger portion and that the gravy emulates sausage, not bacon, gravy. When the chicken and waffles arrived, four things seemed particularly noteworthy. 1) There was not just syrup, but also some delicious marmalade-type stuff that I could do shots of all day. 2) The waffles are pretty crispy. This is how my husband likes them, although I prefer them a bit softer. 3) The chicken has a great texture but isn't like fried chicken--more like shake and bake chicken. I was sort of hoping for the guilty pleasure, grease on my face, feeling like I might throw up experience, but Karyn's is into the whole ""healthy"" thing. Still, pretty good! 4) Fresh blueberries! Lots of them! My husband ordered the french toast. I found it rather good, much lighter and fluffier than I expected and also laden with fresh blueberries. My husband considers the vegan french toast at Pick Me Up the gold standard, so he was hoping for something heavier, with more vanilla flavor. Still, he scarfed the Karyn's french toast and says he'd try it again. We also got a side of breakfast potatoes, and again, a little crispier than I like, but just how my husband likes them. They were seasoned very well but arrived more or less still smoking! I burned my mouth, but that's really my fault, not the restaurant's. I'd like to come back here sometime for dinner. The beer selection looks pretty good. Actually, I'd like to come here for lunch--I sometimes have reason to eat lunch in Greektown but am not so into the Chicago Greek scene, as it's very heavy on seafood and flaming cheese--but Karyn's is not open for lunch during the week! Guess I'll just have to head to Wishbone.... Finally, a note on the service. I didn't find anybody snooty at all, and in fact, our server was very helpful. With so few other people in the restaurant, we did expect things to move a little faster, but I wouldn't call it slow or otherwise lacking. Karyn's is poised to gain a fifth star on my next visit if their dinner menu is tasty as their brunch.",0.9983,0.768,0.203,0.029,0.47978395061728396
2011-05-11,2.0,"I've heard such great things about Karyn's restaurants that I was excited to try this place.  I'm not vegan but was interested in giving vegan dining a try.  I LOVE the decor/atmosphere in this place.  It feels very open and casual and sort of calming.  Our server was very sweet and made recommendations from the menu and answered our questions about meat substitutes and the like.  There were four people in our party, and for an appetizer we had the ""crispy mixed basket.""  That was very good - the sesame tempura batter they use is absolutely delicious.  For our entrees, two of us had the sweet pea risotto, someone had the portobello steak, and someone had the crab cakes.  The risotto was OK, but it was just way too overloaded with peas.  You have to REALLY like peas to enjoy the dish, as there's not a whole lot else going on with it.  My friend enjoyed her portobello steak and my other friend said that while the crab cakes tasted pretty good, they bore almost no resemblance to crab aside from appearance.  (I understand that they weren't actually crab, but shouldn't the flavor at least be reminiscent of crab?)  We all agreed across the board that everything on our plates was extremely salty, which was baffling because there are so many other ways to season food to give it more flavor.  For dessert our server gushed about the chocolate peanut butter pie, so we gave that a shot and were very disappointed.  It was salty.  There was a bunch of sea salt on top, and salt in the pretzel crust, and it was just way too much.  All we could taste was a touch of chocolate, a hint of peanut butter, and a whole bunch of salt.  The coconut ice cream on top wasn't very good either - it wasn't cold (baffling) and had a really weird aftertaste.  I know it wasn't real ice cream so it wasn't going to taste exactly like real ice cream...but it should've at least tasted good, and to me it just didn't.  So overall, I was disappointed with my experience here.  Great atmosphere and good service, but the food itself just didn't do it for me.  This isn't intended to diss vegan cuisine overall, but I just didn't care for this restaurant.",0.9984,0.721,0.236,0.043,0.5577037037037037

I had the raw broccoli soup, the crab cakes, and the raw ice cream, while my husband had the shepherd's pie and the blueberry cobbler.

The guy couldn't have been less interested. ""No"" was the only response he provided. Though he obviously had a right to take this stand, I found his response disgusting and as self-righteous as this pompous restaurant likes to be. I know of several other restaurants that have honored the original purchase price of an overdue groupon if they won't honor the groupon itself. Several friends have done this without incident and groupon recommends this to their clients. The Philosophy of those restaurants is obviously ""honor thy customer."" Not so here. They just lost a customer (and all my referrals) who lives around the corner from Karyn's Cooked and was a frequent flier. A note on Karyn's food itself. if you're looking for healthy fare, steer clear of Karyn's Cooked - it may be vegetarian, but it's also really high fat/caloric content.

My husband and I have been to Karyn's twice now.  Once for a late lunch with a couple of friends on a Saturday and last night for dinner on a Tuesday night.  The first time the restaurant was dead and the service was slow.  Last night the restaurant was packed and the service was even slower.  Luckily both times we were not in any sort of rush.  Good thing I wasn't very hungry when we got there either. Besides the very slow service I am disappointed with Karyn's menu.  I'm not a big fan of vegetarian dishes that try to imitate meat dishes.  And the dishes that are not full of highly processed vegetable proteins, don't offer much in the way of protein.  Not that a person needs a ton of protein on their plate but I would like some interesting legume dishes without soy/tofu all the time. My husband and I had the portebella sandwich at lunch and though it was good, we have had much better.  He also got the ceasar salad and it too was ok but super small for the price.

The restaurant is decorated beautifully, the music was enjoyable but not too loud, the acoustics are good- we could still hear each other talk and the staff is friendly.   The food though....especially for the price...we have had much much better vegan food.  We will not be going back.",0.9968,0.745,0.198,0.058,0.4966287878787881

I've wanted to eat at one of her places for a while and now I'm kicking myself for not going there earlier. I'm no vegan, but damn was this some good eating.  I started my meal with a drink from their fantastic cocktail menu. So many wonderful options, but I went for the TreeTini because they plant a tree for every one that's ordered. I like saving the earth by drinking. The cocktail really hit the spot and got me ready for the food.  My friend and I ordered 2 small plates to start off, but honesty could have just done one. We got the coconut curry and roasted foraged mushrooms. Both were fantastic, but the polenta that came with the mushrooms was out of this world. If this is 'sexy vegan' count me in. I couldn't believe how much flavor they managed to get out of the vegetables.  For my main course I ordered the crab cakes on the servers suggestion. I really couldn't tell that there wasn't real crab in there. The cakes were nice and crunchy on the outside and flaky and moist inside. I also got a nonalcoholic cocktail (they have a really good selection of these), the Clip-On which was a tangy mix of lime juice, coconut water and almond syrup.  We were pretty full at this point, but went for dessert anyway. My friend got the Bananas Foster (and I was a little jealous because that looked fantastic) and I went for the raspberry panna cota.

2011-04-17,4.0,"Both my partner and I are vegetarians, and today is his birthday, and I thought that it would be a nice treat to take him out to a somewhat upscale/fancier restaurant. We'd been to Karyn's on Green before, and found it to be really enjoyable, and were both looking forward to another fantastic experience. It was excellent,  but it left us both with a strong desire to write a review as soon as we got home. And before I dig in here, I have to be fair and say ""they were swamped"". Tonight is Sunday, and I'm sure they weren't expecting to be nearly so busy, but they were just slammed. Understaffed, overfull, and trying really hard to make it work all the same. The food was excellent. We had Chorizo Sliders to start, which were delicious. The seitan was a little dry, but the flavor was excellent, and we were both very satisfied. I had the Fra Diavolo, It tasted great, and I was more than happy with it. The tempeh crab tasted excellent, but didn't really have a ""crab meat"" texture. But that's something you just expect . My partner had the Shepherds Pie, which was also awesome. We also (because I was buying and wanted to spoil him for his birthday) had an order of the Sweet Potato Casserole. Very sweet (topped with vegan marshmallows). Fantastic. After tax, it was 99 dollars. A lot cheaper than I was expecting, which is always appreciated. We also each had 2 cocktails, which were a little pricey, but most definitely worth it. However, my experience was... a little bit of a mixed bag. Keep in mind, again, that they were completely busy. We had a reservation at 7pm, and made it there on time. We arrived, gave the host our name, and were told that they were clearing a table for us, and that we would be seated in just a moment. Awesome. We get seated, and about a minute or so later we get our water, which is served to us by the host. We thank him, and get no response. Not a ""Your welcome"", not an ""No problem"", not even a nod. He's obviously busy, and there's someone else waiting to be checked in and seated, so I don't really think too much of it. About 5 minutes or so later, we get our two slices of bread with butter, and our host comes up again and refills our water glasses. We, again, say ""thank you very much"", and he once again doesn't respond. After he leaves, my partner mentions how he thinks it's somewhat rude, and I can't help but agree a little, but once again I don't think too much about it. They're busy, and he seems to be a little stressed out. Our waiter comes by, apologizes profusely for the wait, and explains that it's hectic. They're busy, and so service is a little slow. He's personable and professional - friendly without being saccharine. We both immediately take a shine to him. We order our food and drinks, and we don't see anyone besides our host who comes by to refill our water a few times (still not acknowledging our very existence, but acting as though he is filling a pair of unattended glasses that seem to be periodically drinking themselves), and begin to feel a little ignored. I understand that they are busy, but I couldn't help but feel a little put out. Before our ""small plate"" comes by, the host comes to fill our water again, and nods when we thank him. But then spills a bunch on the table, doesn't say ""sorry"", ""can I clean that up?"" or even an ""oops"". Just walks away. Bleh. So, about 20 to 25 minutes after we place our orders, the sliders come out. As I said before, delicious! Worth the wait! Our waiter comes by with our drinks less than a minute later, apologizes for the wait, and explains that the bartender is getting them out as fast as he can. We understand, thank him, and start enjoying our drinks. A little time goes by, and right when I start to wonder about when our entrees are coming, our waiter stops by, drops them off, and asks if we'd like more drinks. We order more, and the new ones come out a few minutes later. ...Now here's the problem. I still had a good mouthfull left in my glass, and my partner had roughly the same. But the guy (not our waiter) dropped off our new drinks, and picked up our old glasses - which still had a bit of our 10 dollar cocktails in them. Irksome, but whatever. It happens.  Dinner is delicious, new drinks are delicious. Karyn comes by when we're done, asks us how everything is - we've seen her going table to table and talking with everyone. She was awesome, and really made us smile. We pay, and she takes our check for us, but also takes my partners drink - which again isn't empty. This time, an 11 dollar cocktail. Not the end of the world, but it gave us both a ""wait... what?"" moment. Why does this keep happening? The food was great, but I don't know if I'll be back. I get they were understaffed and busy, but I guess it was just one thing too many.

My husband and I made a reservation for a Friday evening...it was for early evening (around 6:30) and when we got there the place was by no means packed and there were plenty of two-tops in the main dining area. But none the less, the hostess led us to a table in the back of the restaurant away from the lovely dining room where we were basically in a corner facing a wall. My husband, never one to complain, said we should ask to be moved. When I flagged the hostess and asked very politely that we'd like to be moved, she unleashed an evil look and snootily and reluctantly moved us to another table. Our server was great and the food was good, but not as good as Green Zebra. Even so, the rough start kind of colored what could have been a nice experience.

2011-04-01,3.0,"I recently dined at Karyn's on Green with a group of four friends and was alternately charmed and disappointed by the experience. It's true -- the food is pricy, but if you order thoughtfully, the expense can be worth it. My party had the chorizo sliders as an appetizer (good texture, a little over-spiced for my taste) and I ordered the sausage and broccolini pizza for my meal (thin crust with an alfredo-style sauce, topped with vegan sausage and roasted broccolini.) The pizza was a great value -- delicious, only $10, and enough to feed two people. One of my companions ordered the crab cake and I'm still thinking about the taste she let me have! If I ever end up dining at Karyn's on Green again, that's definitely what I'll be ordering. While I enjoyed my food, my experience with regard to service was not great. I don't eat at ""upscale"" restaurants very often, so when I do, I expect a certain level of service to correspond with the higher menu prices. Our waiter was forgetful, slow in coming over to our table to take our order, slow in placing our order with the kitchen staff, and rarely dropped in to see how we were doing/if we needed anything. We ended up having a ""mix up"" with our appetizer (fewer sliders than we ordered), waited ages for our appetizer and entrees, and spent what seemed like an eternity waiting for boxes (we asked our server twice before eventually approaching the bar to ask the bartender for to-go boxes, the bartender, in turn, reprimanded our server who eventually showed up with the boxes.) Additionally, the server made an error in splitting our checks, but by that point in the night we were all ready to get out of there and decided to sort things out on our own rather than asking them to recalculate the bill. While the food at Karyn's was delicious, the cost is a bit much, especially for the quality of service we experienced. I hate to judge a restaurant on just one visit, so I would definitely dine there again to see how the service experience changes.

If I would have served this at home or at a party I would been slapped or looked upon like I was torturing them. Karyn's on Green, for me was completely ""Meh. I've experienced better"" because it's true I have no shame being the ""uncool"" one here. The concept isn't lost on me and I do appreciate the creativity that goes into their food. It is the flavor that throws me off (the snobby waitress didn't help either). I understand being a vegan, I have friends that are. Vegetarian/ Vegan and Gluten-free food has never tasted this bad before, at least to me. Every plate was missing a few things but the most important was flavor. For the love of god Karyn, throw some spice my way!! I checked Vegans can have spices!  The prices are out there but you do get a good portion size. The decor and seating is upscale. The service was a bit snobbish for my taste but she eased up a bit later in the night. So Karyn's has three restaurants and even after this I'm open to trying another but I'm not super excited. Maki roll- red beet, avocado, cucumber, bell pepper, carrot, sushi rice, chipotle aioli. Would have been actually good but it was rolled sloppy and the chipotle aioli killed any taste of the veggies. Still I'd order again. Raw broccoli soup severed cold- olive oil, garlic, lemon. Yikes!! This was bad and really bad. I love broccoli and this didn't taste anything like broccoli. Also it gave me problems (see Johnny T issue). Endive mixed greens, chive cashew cheese, pickled red onion, cashew vinaigrette. Fine but the Endive was coated with this stuff that I can only describe as a peppery dirt taste.  Seared tofu gumbo red quinoa, radicchio sauté, fried leeks, spicy tomato broth. Tofu was excellent, so was leeks, and tomato broth. The Quinoa was nasty, tasted like charcoal.   Apple Pie -granny smith apples, vanilla bean ice-cream. Excellent!! I should have eaten only desserts here. Why didn't anyone tell me?! Whatever, I'm still trying to get the taste of overcooked Quinoa out of my mouth... blah! Also if you're going to run a ""nature"" dvd at least play it. It was stuck on a loop in the main menu. Just something I noticed as I'm sure others did.",0.903,0.722,0.152,0.126,0.5633428300094967

Great place for a party, a group of friends, a drink, or a date. Yes, it is expensive (most small plates $10  and large plates $15), however as soon as you walk in, you can see why. The place is gorgeous! Lovely contemporary design everywhere you look, a wonderful water feature in the front of the restaurant, and not one, but two full bars, one of which is located upstairs in a lovely lounge (with TV) perfect for having a drink or watching a game with friends...or both. :) As big as the place is, it still maintains a warm intimate feel. Both the food and the service are great! Wonderful for dinner or brunch on the weekend. For dinner, I love the chorizo sliders and the chicken legs, and for brunch I adore the buffalo chicken pita and banana pancakes with fried plantains.  NOW FOR THE GOOD PART! When I went there for the first time, I met Karyn. She came right up to the table and said hello! My boyfriend said he wished he could have taken a picture of my face! She even said I looked like a princess. *DEAD* Did I mention how much I love her??? She is definitely over 60 and looks under 40! Now I KNOW my being vegan is the right way to go!!! Even got invited to the upstairs lounge for a free drink and had my picture taken with her! :) I meet her almost every time I go out to KOG, including when I was there on NYE! The place had live music, $69.99 for a five course meal and a champagne toast at midnight. LOVELY!  I decided to dress up for the occasion as a New Years' Fairy and got my pics on their Facebook page! SCORE! So, yeah! You should go to Karyn's. And meet Karyn. And have a drink.

He failed to order my side dish and when my entree came without it, he turned it on me as though it was my fault. Hey, we all have bad days...

It's like when you have a good friend that tells you about how awesome THEIR friend is - they tell you ""if you guys ever met, you'd ADORE her!"" This is Karyn on Green - she was cool in concept, even cool in appearance, but when I finally met her, well.... The entire menu is vegan which is great because I never get to go to a restaurant and get my choice of anything I want. The restaurant itself is refined, upscale, and hip. The kind of restaurant that has great lighting that makes everyone's skin look amazing. We were there on a weekday and the upper level was closed. I would imagine that the atmosphere is all the more impressive when the entire area is opened up. I was there for a farewell dinner for my vegan friend who is moving out of Chicago. I was surprised that no one on the staff acknowledged the occasion since a note was made with the reservation but I guess that's not a given. We started off with drinks and everyone enjoyed their selection - thumbs up on drinks, especially the Sidecar. While noshing on the bread, a couple of us commented on how much the fake butter tasted like real butter but saltier. We were intrigued by what other culinary deceptions lay ahead. On the topic of salt, one of the big pitfalls of several items we ordered was too much salt, particularly in the caesar salad (from the croutons) and the quinoa. For an appetizer, I had the chorizo sliders. Tasty, but messy to eat. Someone had the sweet potato with marshmellow side that they hardly touched since the diced sweet potatoes were undercooked and hard.  I had the seared tofu gumbo. The tofu was great but I can't believe how salty the quinoa was. My boyfriend had the chicken legs - I was very tempted to reach over and take his entire plate - it was so good! If you get nothing else from this review, please note to get the chicken legs - I wish I had.  The overall vibe of the restaurant was a little confusing. Since the look of the restaurant was cool and hip - you would think there would be a lot of hustle, bustle, and chatter. Instead, it was eerily quiet. To the point where when we had a hearty laugh at the table, it would resonate, and we would look around embarrassed, like we made too much noise at the library. My new best friend?

2011-02-16,4.0,"My husband and I have visited Karyn's two different times. Both times were on Valentine's Day, one year apart. The first time we went there (the fact that I remember the meal one year later proves how good it was) we were both blown away by the beauty of the resturant. It is so bright, open, and sophisticated. When I walked in I immediately felt special and new I was going to have a great meal. We started off with some drinks, I'm not sure the name of mine but it was a spritzer with jalepenos, cilantro, lime juice and sweetened with simple syrup. It definitely sounds odd, but it was really delicious and refreshing. When we received the menu we did not know what to go with, we had the ""I want everything"" mentality. We ordered the appetizer basket and the chorizo sliders. I could take or leave the basket, but the sliders were one of the best things I have ever eaten. So good! Who needs real chorizo when fake tastes like this! For our main entree I had the chicken legs with bbq sauce and steamed greens and my husband had the shepards pie. De.lic.ious.  Now I don't know why it took us so long to come back to Karyn's, but we wanted to go somewhere out of the ordinary this Valentine's day and were craving brunch. We remembered that Karyn's had a brunch and once we checked out the menu, we could not pass it up. We showed up around 1:00pm with reservations and it pretty busy. Our waitress Karen, was wonderful. She was so nice and attentive. We ordered our drinks and checked out the menu. We decided on the chicken and waffles with a side of grits for my husband and the biscuits and gravy with a side of the ""amazing"" bacon I read about on Yelp. Our food took an inordinate amount of time to come out, about 45 minutes. All the people that were in the resturant already received their food and everyone who came after us was digging in on their food. We weren't sure what was up with that, but Karen apologized and assured us the food was on the way. The bacon was awesome, they fry it to obtain the texture of meat, but it was really good. I really liked the biscuits and gravy. It had a chorizo gravy and the biscuits were really buttery. The only thing I wasn't thrilled about was the abundance of sage in my dish, not a fan of sage. My husband's chicken and waffles were pretty good, although I wouldn't order it on my own.

2011-02-15,3.0,"I'm vegan and as such I really appreciate it when a restaurant is entirely vegan, as Karyn's three restaurants are: Karyn's Raw Cafe, Karyn's Cooked, and Karyn's on Green. I've eaten at Karyn's Cooked many times and in general have always been happy with the food there. It is the kind of place I can take almost anyone--from a longtime vegan to one of my meat-and-potatoes relatives--and know they will be satisfied. Maybe the best thing about Karyn's Cooked is the amazing desserts. So I was excited to try Karyn's on Green for more upscale dining. My first experience at Karyn's on Green, back in November, was wonderful. The sliders alone were worth a second visit. Karyn's on Green was therefore the obvious choice for my Valentine's day dinner with my husband. Karyn's on Green offered a fixed menu that seemed like an incredible value: 2 starters, 2 soups, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 desserts, and 2 glasses of champagne for $99. Amazing, right? And for the most part the food did prove to be a good deal. We were blown away by the chorizo stuffed cherry peppers with figs. We were mostly content with everything else, though we didn't like the fact that the zucchini pappardelle was served cold. Who eats cold pasta, except when you're bringing leftovers to work and in too much of a rush even to run to the microwave? We actually considered asking our server to warm it up for us. Then came dessert. We had been looking forward to the chocolate fondue for days in advance. I haven't had fondue in years and couldn't wait to have it prepared vegan. The menu stated: ""chocolate fondue with artisan cookies, fruits, and berries for two to share."" We pictured, as I think anyone who has ever eaten fondue would, a pot of steaming chocolate set on the table, with an array of sweets and skewers for dipping. This is what fondue is, right? Apparently not according to Karyn. What we got was a small bowl with a puddle of lukewarm chocolate sauce (it tasted just like Hershey's syrup), and in the bowl were two raspberries, two tiny strawberry slices, and three mushy cookies that tasted like bread dough. I took one bite and no more. The only thing that could make this pathetic excuse for fondue worse was the fact that it was intended for two people, and thus we had lost our one other chance at a decent dessert. I can't comprehend how anyone thought this was an adequate dessert for two people to share, and how anyone could conceive that it even resembled fondue. If it had been labeled ""sponge cake and fruit with chocolate sauce"" it might have been forgivable as a dessert for one at a casual restaurant. But this fell so far from the mark it almost seemed like a joke. I'm happy to have a veg-friendly fine-dining alternative to the Green Zebra in Chicago, especially one that is all-vegan. But I am not sure whether I will risk spending my money at Karyn's on Green again, knowing how inconsistent it can be.",0.9941,0.832,0.136,0.033,0.5503973803973805

I've had better vegan food at restaurants that don't, at all, specialize in vegan or vegetarian dishes. I'll agree with some of the other reviewers that I loved the Chorizo appetizer, but the meal trailed off after that--an unimpressive salad, bland risotto main course, and some cheesecake that hadn't been fully defrosted (why it was frozen in the first place became clear to me when it ""melted"" all over my plate). The staff was polite, but didn't stand out in terms of their attendance--twice during the 5-course meal, they brought out the next course before clearing the previous plates. Finally, upon paying, our waiter said he was ""having a problem"" processing our groupon.

It is definitely nicer than I expected, which normally makes me feel like a kid in a fine china store, but the atmosphere was still pretty relaxed.  The prices seem pretty normal and I felt comfortable in what I had worn without knowing what kind of place Karyn's on Green is.   The drink choices looked amazing and reasonably priced, but I stuck with a basic beer.  The menu was pretty incredible, in my opinion - definitely more interesting than your standard vegan fare.   We started with the polenta, which I was pleased with, followed by the crispy chicken legs for my friend and the grilled vegetable wrap for me.  While my wrap was pretty messy, it was also gone in a couple minutes because I loved it so much.

First off, don't let the plain jane front of the building fool you. It's quite simple yet elegant inside. Great light music and a friendly staff who was eager to make our experience a good one.  The waiter, Josh, walked us through the menu as newbies and made a couple of recommendations. Chorizo sliders (totally vegan) were amazing. The forged mushrooms were also quite delicious.  For dinner, the penne fra diavolo and my date had the marinated portobello steak. Both were unbelievable. Not good, unbelievable! Add a bottle of red wine between us and we were quite full. We ordered dessert after seeing some of the other deserts being paraded to other nearby tables. The pears were very good, but at the end of the day, how do you mess up a pear?

The restaurant is beautiful -- high ceilings, soft lighting, Chihuly-esque chandeliers, and unlike other veg places, none of that holier than thou hippy stuff -- our waitress was perky, friendly, and helpful -- and ensured that our water glasses were always full and that we were never without. Tried the potato leek soup (wonderful, creamy), the arugula salad (lively), the spinach lentil salad, tofu gumbo (delicious, smoky, hot), the beet carapaccio (only medicore thing I ate), the brussel sprout sides (mustardy and perfectly toothsome), the foraged roasted mushrooms w/ polenta (yes), the cauli curry (rich, nice flavor), the chorizo sliders (like a veg sloppy joe w/o being disgusting), the chocolate terrine (a bit crunchy, not overly sweet, yum) and the bananas foster (decent -- lots of nanas, I'm not a huge caramel person).  I think it was $162 w/ two glasses of wine and some $6 tea.

We also ordered the aged raw cheese platter, which I assumed would be a vegan cheese plate, but instead it was all nut-derived.....this was also a great dish! We also ordered the caesar salad---which was the perfect sharing portion for 3.  I ordered the linguini w/ mock crab---which tasted nothing like crab---more just like bland seitan-I was not blown away in the least by this dish... My sister had the penne marinera was decent but not very well seasoned..Overall I'd come back again for sure. The restaurant itself was beautiful and the atmoshphere was comfortable, young and non-pretentious.",0.9826,0.738,0.211,0.051,0.6006297795771481
2010-10-07,4.0,"Very fancy vegan place - this is place on the observation that most vegan places are NOT fancy. This is a nice ""date"" restaurant.  Went for dinner. Appetizer: I had the Raw Cheeze Plate appetizer - the cheezes are Dr. Cows cheezes which I have had before and they are very yummy. Could do with more flax crackers - it was definately skimpy on the crackers - I ran out of crackers before I ate all the cheezes. But I still ate them any way! The flax crackers are definately made there or at Karyns Raw and they are cheap to make  - so how about some extra Karyn?  Entree: I had the Chicken Drumsticks! Yum! They were good! Cute too - little stick in the middle so you could eat it like a 'real' drumstick and the faux vegan chicken meat pulls off just like real chicken (as far as I can remember real chicken!). The drumsticks came with a sweet bqq sauce and some weird hash that seemed more like it should go for a brunch or breakfast meal than a dinner - I  would suggest changing this and perhaps have another sauce option like a savory gravy.  My friend had the coconut curry as an appetizer and said it was bland. I didn't try it. And the Sliders for a main course. The sliders were definately cute with those little buns - but boy were they hot! Lots of jalopeno! Other than that they were tasty but on the dry side.  I would definately go back for those chicken drumsticks and maybe the cheeze plate. Even better if I could find them someplace myself and have them at home - they are obviously not made there because I have had them somewhere else before so hopefully I can buy them and have them with gravy!  Karyns on Green is a nice place. These are definatley 'date' prices. :) Although, I thought that it wasn't a bad price for 4 different Dr. Cow cheezes for the cheeze plate - those Dr. Cow cheezes are expensive if you buy them yourself.  You pay for some ambiance here. There aren't any other fancy all vegan places to go to in Chicago so this isn't a bad place if you want fancy.  I would go to try brunch out someday.

I starte off with their Green Mojito...wow!!!  Didn't taste like your typical Mojito, it has a hint of ginger which really gave it a kick.  My friend ordered a dirty martini which was apparently just as fantastic. The mushroom appetizer was pretty good, had a little bit of a bitter aftertaste but over all great....by the way the bread and butter was amazing! I got the butternut squash soup which was like heaven!  My friend got potato leek which was pretty good as well.   For the entree I chose the ""crab"" cakes...wow!!  Filling, delicious but very small portion.  My friend got the lasagna which had a bit of spicy flavoring but was ok..I wasn't a huge fan though. So of course we had to have dessert, we split the banana foster item and it was pretty sweet but great. The prices are are pretty steep, but I guess ""healthy"" eating isn't exactly the cheapest.

We tried the sliders, the butternut squash soup, the chicken legs, kale slaw and an endive salad. Everything. Was. DELCIOUS. I'm torn between the sliders here and at Mana Food Bar for my fave veggie burgers of all time; I think Karyn's might edge Mana out with their spiciness, great ciabatta bun, and delicious melty cheese. BF loved the chicken legs but as someone who hasn't eaten meat in 15 years they were a little too 'real' [unsettlingly so] for me. Of course this is probably a pro, not a con, for those who miss the taste and texture of meat. Tthe sweet potato and swiss chard hash that came with it was to die for Another standout was the endive salad- specifically the cashew cheese balls that came with it. I've never had a non milk-based cheese before and I was pleasantly surprised- it really melts in your mouth and sets off the flavour of the salad perfectly. The kale slaw was also incredible- tangy and flavourful, plus you get a large portion for just five bucks! The timing of our order got slightly mixed up [soup came last] but it actually worked out well- the sweetness of the butternut squash was the perfect 'dessert.' The service here was great- our server sent out another salad to apologize for the soup coming later, and another server [manager?] also came to check in with us.

A basket of fluffy truffled pop corn magically appeared to accompany our drinks.  I had ""the Wolf and the Dragon"" which is Suntory whiskey on the (green tea) rocks.  ""For relaxing times, make it Suntory time"" indeed! As everyone has mentioned, the faux chorizo sliders are super tasty, as are the ""chicken"" legs- I loved every bite and was blown away by the meaty texture (I'm not a vegetarian, so I'm impressed that I'm impressed. I mean this lovingly, but often what vegetarians claim to be quite meat like is nothing of the sort.)  The ""cheese"" plate was flavorful and tasty, but I would have enjoyed it more without the notion that it should be somewhat like cheese, because it wasn't. I hate to get into semantics, but those little tasties were much more like pate than cheese, and I think one's expectation of something influences how well it is or isn't received. Very tasty, just not cheese like. Butternut squash soup, also a total home run. The chewy, flavorful bread brought out to the table would put any bread basket to shame. So good! And I have no idea what the fake butter spread is made out of, but I would like to buy a tub. Awesome. The tofu gumbo had a great flavor, but again with the names. The dish in no way, shape, or form resembled gumbo, other than the inclusion of okra. A different name is in order here too, folks. This delicious dish deserves its own name.  I had the lasagna, which was strangely herbed/spiced in a way that unsettled me a little (didn't seem very Italian) but was very good, if somewhat left of center in terms of its flavor profile. I thought the bananas foster was terrible-- somehow the bananas were tough? like dried out? The ice cream was too sweet and much more like sorbet- fast melting with a watery mouth feel. I'm a pastry chef by trade, so I know how very easy it is to make good, creamy, vegan ice cream. I think a recipe revamp may be in order... Call it sorbet and that's fine, but ice cream it ain't.",0.9973,0.731,0.219,0.05,0.6565243902439025
2010-09-20,3.0,"My experience at Karyn's was very hit or miss. Directly walking in, I enjoyed the atmosphere and clean modern atmosphere. However, my greeting was less than satisfactory. One guy looked at me then proceeded to ignore me as he poured over their reservation system. Then oh here comes the hostess, she will sure notice us and at least say ""HI"" or something....nope she proceeds to ignore us and then they both begin an elaborate discussion about something, for like 5 minutes... I stare at my husband in disbelief, eyebrows raised, cock-eyed at the 2 as they continue their conversation. They almost BOTH walk off, when finally, the guy is like, ""oh wait, maybe we should talk to these people first..."" that's exactly what he said, OUT LOUD in front o fus....I couldn't believe it, I thought I was being punked... Ok, moving on. We are seated, and left with only one menu between us. Ok great, thanks for that too...I think your hostess needs more training and maybe not on a Saturday night quite yet. The Southern cocktail was delicious, and is basically a mojito but used Gin instead of Rum for a refreshing twist. For appetizers, we ordered the Heirloom Tomatoes and Roasted Foraged Mushrooms.  The tomatoe salad was your tyipcal run of the mill tomato salad...and yes yes there was some basil sorbet on there, but it was insanely sweet and I didn't orgasm over it like some fellow yelpers. The foraged mushrooms were good, but underseassoned and the eggplants accompanying them were still hard, meh. For entrees, we opted for the Portabello Steak and the Vegetable Terrine. At $20 and the most expensive item on the menu, the Terrine was the biggest disappointment of all. It was insanely overly smokey in flavor, and a sad stack of vegis with little to no flavor or sauce or moisture to speak of, just the smoke.  That's IT for $20 people. I asked why, because usually it relates to the cost of ingredients. The server said it was because it takes time to stack the vegis and the smoking process....GIVE ME A BREAK! I want a do-over, that Terrine was not good. The portabello steak entree was delicious. It was comforting, with traditional ""steak"" preparation for the portabello mushroom, with mashed potatoes and red wine reduction.  So satisfying you don't miss the meat at all...that's how this should be, now we're talkin'! For a side, we ordered the Kale Slaw, and as unappealing as that may sound to some of you, it was the best freakin' slaw I've ever had, yum!  For dessert, we got the Bananas Foster, which was Rummy to the max and delicious.   All in all, kinda over-priced for the food we got (hello $20 zuchini terrine, you suck), but I wouldn't rule out going again, I just have to make menu selections like a dining ninja...the table to our left seemed to be making smarter decisions, as their food looked better than our's. The table to our right was sad and hardly touched some of their less than discernable ingredients...you decide whether you can navigate through some of those potholes...I might be adventurous enough to try it again, we'll see.",0.9968,0.8,0.158,0.043,0.5664920634920635

That's where the fun in regards to food ended for me though.  Once again, the entrees left me wanting something different.  We tried the marinated portobello steak,  the sweet corn risotto, and what I thought was the Sausage pizza (that's a story in itself). The marinated portobello steak was mediocre at best.  Maybe it's not fair for me to say that since I am not the biggest mushroom fan, but I think I was expecting more than a few sliced mushrooms over some mushy potatoes on my plate. The sweet corn risotto was awful.  I don't think it's possible to make a good risotto without real cream and cheese - sorry, but it just isn't happening.  This dish tasted like someone took canned corned and mixed it together with really overcooked rice.  Not appealing at all. We had ordered the Sausage pizza also, or what we thought was the sausage pizza.  I was really looking forward to it too because the waitress said it was somewhat spicy, and I love spicy.  We get the pizza and start eating it.  First of all, I knew the cheese wasn't going to be that great since it's soy, but it looked like play-doh.  Then after a few bites we all realized it was missing the ""sausage"".  I call the waitress over and she says, ""oops!  I put it in wrong in the system.  I am so sorry.  That's the other pizza.""  I was pretty disappointed.  I know mistakes happen, but I was looking forward to the Sausage.  The pizza we got was Jerry's, and it wasn't good. Lastly, the drinks were super strong.  I am not a complete light-weight, but I remember the first time I went there and how great the drinks were.  You could actually taste the other ingredients in them and not just the alcohol.  That was not the case last night.  My first drink, which had become a favorite of mine - On Rosemary's Thyme - tasted like a gin margarita this time.  Not tasty at all.  I decided to give them a second chance and ordered the Wolf and the Dragon - again, it tasted overwhelmingly like pure scotch.  I love scotch, but I knew the drink should have had other flavors in it.  I asked the waitress if the bartenders changed and she said they had two bartenders in a row quit recently.  That explains the drinks I suppose.   So I guess I could have shortened this review, but long story short: 1. Go for the appetizers, they are worth it. 2. The drinks can be hit or miss.  Take a chance I suppose. 3. Don't expect much from the entrees, but if it's your first time try a couple to form your own opinions.",0.9959,0.773,0.154,0.073,0.47096354166666665

Highly recommended starter.  Crispy mixed basket -- a mixed basket of fried goodness. Mushrooms, avocado and traditional potato fries. Strangely light as the tempura batter did not hold on to much grease. Again highly recommended.  Marinated portobello steak -- As someone who has never had steak, i can't compare it to the real deal, however as a stand alone dish i found it to be well executed. The mashed potato side was creamy and had a great consistency, especially considering no butter was used in the dish.  Risoto -- Little bit sweet for my taste (the lack of Parmesan cheese is noticeable). However the risotto itself was cooked well. Makes a good side dish.  Jerry's pizza -- The only real misstep of the night on many levels. We ordered the sausage pizza, however we were served the Jerry's due to an error on our servers part. This pizza made me miss real cheese. Overall it tasted like taking spoonfuls of oil. I would recommend staying away from any dish that has ""cheese"" on the menu.

Well she did, literally every 1-2 minutes for the next 10 minutes or so. She was polite, but VERY impatient.  The other complaint I have is that she didn't explain anything.

The bacon here is my holy grail.  My search is over.  I have been vegan for about seven years and I have not been this excited about a new item of food in a long, long, long time.  Tears stung my eyes and I wept with joy as I snarfed down this bacony treasure.  Okay, maybe not really.  But it was as close to a religious experience as I'll ever get and it deserves one star all to itself.  There aren't enough caps in the world to describe HOW INSANELY GOOD IT IS. The grits? Amazing.  Served in their own cute little iron skillet type dishes - slightly sweet but sprinkled with pepper, reminds me of grits my dad made for me when I was a kid.  I had a nibble of my friend's french toast and damn it was GOOD.  There was only one place in the entire city where I can order vegan french toast and feel satisfied...now there are two.  They give the other guys a run for their money! For my entree I got the chicken and waffles...it was spectacular.  I am not a goji fan, and it comes with goji berry syrup which I was wary of.  Turns out it was maple syrup with gojis in it, which was fine, dandy, and delicious.  I would say maybe the waffles could be a touch, just a touch less crispy but other than that it was fab.  The chicken was crispy, flavorful, went perfectly with the waffles and syrup. If there was any way to turn someone's impression around, this brunch was it.  The staff was lovely, especially the hostess, who was kind enough to come out and take a post-brunch picture of us ladies all together.  Everyone I was with loved their meals, the experience was wonderful, and I will be back as soon as I can for more outta control brunch!",0.9976,0.761,0.208,0.031,0.5835183138374627

Drinks are tastey and classy and range from 7-11$. Even though it's nice to get dressed up, and typically most people are, you will not get booed out if you're wearing jeans and a flannel. For appetizers I've had the maki roll, and you experience so many flavors with each bite.  For dinner Ive had: Portebello Steak- Tastey and marinated and very ""wood grilled"" which I like, and the mashed potatoes and spinach that game along were great Poached Haddock- I do not think this is on the menu anymore, but this was the first time I had imitation fish, and it was pretty good. The texture was ever so slightly rubbery, but generally it was thumbs up Chicken Legs- Fuggg yeah! These were my favorite, very good flavors in the chicken (which was surprisingly made out of tofu and not seitan) and also the BBQ sauce. As always the potatoes and other garnishes were divine! Meatload- Of all the things Ive had at Karyn's, this has been my least favorite. It was very salty and not that many other flavors came through, and I felt generally it did not taste that innovative like the other dishes Ive had. For dessert Ive had the Banana's Foster, which is obviously a good idea, but a liiiitle too sweet. Also I've had the tarimisu, which while it was tastey, was a bit dry. The best part is tiny tan Karyn walks around and schmoozes with you, and often invites you upstairs to the lounge for a drink.

2010-05-24,5.0,"For me, Karyn's on Green filled the void for a hip and moderately priced vegan restaurant in Chicago. I think the space is absolutely gorgeous - it has a ""modern meets nature"" aesthetic with high ceilings, white walls, clean lines, cool chandeliers, waterfalls. It feels very airy and serene, yet there's a lot of energy.  I've dined here several times and have established some favorites:  * Heirloom Beet Salad - Straightforward beet and apple salad. It's simple, light, and tastes good.  * Chicken Legs with sweet potato hash, swiss chard, and bbq sauce - This is my favorite entree. ""Chicken"" is breaded, a little spicy, and is covered in bbq sauce. I don't know what the sweet potato hash is spiced with, but it's delic!!

Both the maki roll (app) and marinated portabello steak (entree) were good, however, I did not think they tasted any different than maki rolls or grilled portabellos prepared at non-veg restaurants. I guess these could be good options non-vegetarian diners who think vegan food is weird.  The only 2 menu items I haven't been particularly fond of are: * The Meatloaf - OK, but if you're going to go the fake meat route, I think the chicken legs are significantly tastier. Also, as a side note, the meatlof came with ""bacon"" which tasted like a very hard, thick spicy potato chip.  I've never had real bacon, but based on how much people love it, I can't imagine this fake bacon tasted like the real thing. * Fra Diavolo (pasta with crab) - This tasted very strange (in a bad way) to me.  I've never tasted real crab, but like the fake bacon, I can't imagine people liking real crab if this imitation crab tasted anything like the real thing.",0.9864,0.723,0.187,0.091,0.5910689484126985
2010-05-24,4.0,"I'm slightly reluctant about the four stars - maybe I'm more like a 3+. But we've been a few times now, and we always have a nice time. As everyone says, the decor is knockout. Airy, mod, relaxing, elegant but unpretentious. Even good music, and lighting. Ok, it's slightly pretentious that they invariably ask you if you have a reservation and look around discerningly for a free table, when I've yet to see the place more than 2/3 full - this really needs to stop. And it was slightly pretentious when Karyn asked our party to adjourn to the upstairs 'lounge' for a comp cocktail. I was game, but before our party of 8 could agree one guy said ""I don't need a drink"" and Karyn just stalked off. I was left saying ""hey wait! I want a free cocktail in the VIP room!"" Don't dis the Karyn, ya'll. I did sort of wonder how many times a day she gives her ""I'm 65, look at how fabulous I look, I have four restaurants and therapy center, I haven't eaten meat or had alcohol in 40 years and feel WONDERFUL!"" routine. Ah, boomer health divas. Ok, the food. Mostly really good. Went last night, and I would say great (like the just added sweet corn risotto - truffle oil makes if really rich and satisfying. Heirloom tomato with basil sorbet, amazing.) Yes, those chorizo sliders are delicious. Drinks are mostly fabulous, really smart concoctions. Favorite maybe the Corpse Reviver #2, also last night. Also like the one that they plant a tree each time you order it. It has a roasted rosemary sprig in it. I've had some things I wouldn't order again - the shepherds pie helped confirm for me that seitan outside of Chinese food is terrible. And gives me stomach aches. They will really need to mix the menu up regularly to keep people coming in, as I agree with another reviewer who says that its rare to find something here you can't live without. The menu is heavy on the faux-animal thing, which unlike another reviewer I didn't find evasive or any kind of subterfuge. It does make ordering something of a mystery game. The ""Salmon"", the ""Raw Cheese"" - both weird, but delicious on their own terms. The food is well prepared, portions are surprisingly hearty, and everything tastes fresh and healthy, if not especially complex  (I don't want complex often, and I don't go back to Blackbird or Schwa more than annually.) Also agree with others that the vegan desserts here (and elsewhere) are best passed over. Edible at best. Maybe a little overcompensation to the non-vegan crowd (which is most, me included) with all the fried, the fake meat, and heavyness. Service: just ok. Everyone has been nice, but not especially inviting. Maybe the reserve comes from not being busy enough and making enough dough, or from the vibe from top. You know the difference from a real pro who keeps you coming back, and the kid who just gets your food to you cordially. This has tended toward the latter. Biggest pluses are largely the price points, which are surprisingly low. I expected entrees to be ten dollars more on average than they are. Its nice to go out and have a high end experience on a medium budget, which keeps us going back.

The interior is very nice, but I did feel like a fly in a bowl of milk, it was so white.  I liked what they did though.  It rather reminded me of a cafe at a big art museum.  I didn't get up into the lounge, but it looked ok from below.  The bathrooms were just OK.  I expected more, but its just a bathroom, right? Service was very good.  My server was Nikki (sp?) and she was nice without being that pushy fake that a lot of fancy places throw at you where they want to prattle on about the specials for 5 minutes.  She kept the rolls coming and didn't drown us in water refills.  Just right for me. Food was delicious.  I wasn't sure what to get.  I tend to be more adventurous now, but wasn't so much before I was vegan.  So many of the old favorites that I'm sure lots of people miss, I never had in their proper form:  I never had 'real' chorizo or crab.  Conversely, there wasn't anything on the menu that looked really crazy enough that I HAD to try. That being said, the chorizo sliders were delish.  The crabcakes were OK, but smelled like crab smells.  the linguine fra diavolo was really good, and I needed those rolls to sop up all the sauce.  I will say the rolls were made with a low-protein flour (like cake four instead of bread flour) and thus were more like biscuits, but still, I liked. Dessert was great.  Panna cotta was good, but I'm not a big fan of that dish in general, but if you like it, you'll love it here.  The tiramisu was a deconstructed version, but very very good.  I would go here just for that.   Almost as good as the tiramisu was that someone actually cared about the berries they put on the desserts.  I think that most places think that customers are just amazed and overwhelmed by any crappy berries on any dish, and should just be grateful it's not artificial.  So I've had more than my share of strawberries and blueberries that are really just decoration:  Typically they are really huge and flavorless.  But here at KoG, they were normal-sized berries, and they had flavor.  You could tell someone actually paid attention, and did not just throw them on there as a garnish.  I suspect it was the pâtissier, but whoever it was, hats off! Ok, so even if you don't like berries, a great meal, and not as expensive as I would have thought.  Can't wait to return.",0.9987,0.713,0.24,0.047,0.5721841269841272

Meatloaf was good, but I can make a good vegan meatloaf (lentil and tofu is my fave; this one might have brown rice in it). Crab cakes, also good, might have a seitan base. I'll definitely go back.  Next time I'll try the pasta, sushi and raw hummus.

2010-05-10,2.0,"This menu drives me nuts. Occlusion, editing and dishonesty stand out here.  The entirely vegan menu is full of meat references -- so many dishes that are just copying meat dishes.  There is an entree listed as ""Salmon:  broccoli rabe, white wine lemon sauce .""  No explanation of what you will get. It certainly will not be salmon. Seitan? Tofu?  WTF is a Crab Cake gonna be?  Also the menu is all over the place. There is no ""style"" -- too typical for ""vegetarian"" restaurants. Dish by Dish: Mushroom risotto: The arborrio rice tasted like it was simply boiled, not ""risottoed.""  Grainy, not creamy.  My companion said ""the whole point of ordering risotto is that you don't want to break your arm off stirring it at home."" Same goes for polenta.  Sausage Pizza: The online menu confirmed that the dough was, in fact, tortillas.  The printed menu did not mention that it would have ""vegan cheese"" which it had in abundance. Tasteless at best, badly textured, goopy vegan cheese.  And it would have been a fine product without it -- even though it's made on tortillas a la high school and a toaster oven. Also the menu didn't mention the large amount of red pepper flakes. Basket of fried things: All were good except the avocado, which is horribly ill conceived.  I can imagine wanting to try it, but if I were in that kitchen and I tried this I would not have put in on the menu. I mean, the ""fry"" falls off the avocado. Fresh avocado on potato chips would be better. Shepherd's Pie: small, mostly mashed potato (barely a lick of horseradish in there), chunks of tough, unflavorful seitan. Portebello Steak: made me think of a veggie option at catered event in the late 90s. Totally boring. Fine, but boring. Chicken Legs.  Just what a vegetarian wants to order. ""I want legs for dinner, please.""  We had heard this was a very popular choice.  I'm not sure what it was -- something like seitan but the texture... marshmellowy goopy.  I would not order this again. That texture will haunt me for days. There is a mural on the way to the bathroom with calligraphic ""Famous Vegans and Vegetarians.""  The two that caught my eye were Elizabeth Berkeley and Rob Zombie.  Outstanding. Wine list is small and fine. Some inexpensive options. There's beer too, some of which is acceptable. Cocktails were tempting, overpriced.  Service was spotty -- pleasant but not always there. One reviewer put Karyn's on Green ""on par with Millennium"" (my most favored restaurant ever) and it most certainly is not. Millennium is all about complexity -- layers and layers of flavor which mix and stand out in mythic ways.   Their recipes routinely call for small amounts of other recipes which themselves call for small amounts of yet other recipes.  Karyn's is fairly simple food. There is some refinement but not too much. They really overplay the ""good for the world"" thing.  It's a bit offensive, really.  I'll give you ""Slightly less bad"" but not much more than that. It's also not particularly healthy. I'm not taken by my experience here. The menu needs to describe the food accurately. The textures are all off.  There is too much dependence on ""meat substitutes.""  Prices are relatively moderate (you could get a lighter meal for 10-15, up to a full meal with several drinks 50+). But mostly, nothing is innovative here. It might open vegetarianism to some people, but for vegetarians it is more of a step back. In 1995 (before I learned to cook) this place would have blown my mind.

I give Karyn credit for being on the forefront of at least offering options other than meat, but many of her options are less than healthy. This new location on Green is a nice place and that is mainly because it was a restaurant previously and little was done to enhance it from its predecessor.

My favorite was the eggplant cannelloni.  That dish had the most flavor out of all three.  The crispy chicken was impressive. But I think I like the chicken wings from Chicago Diner better. The chorizo slider had a nice spicy kick to it! For drinks we ordered the Chairman's Cobbler (non-alcoholic). It had green tea, pomegranate juice, ginger syrup, lemon juice, berries, and raspberries.  It was definitely more sour than sweet.  I dont recommend getting it if you dont like tart and sour things, and if you dont like raspberry seeds stuck in your teeth. We also got the green tea.  We tried ordering their specialty teas from their tea menu, but they ran out or it wasn't in stock. They charge $6 for tea, which I thought wasnt really worth it. Overall a nice experience. We're glad we came. Their desserts looked good, but we were too full to try any. Parking was available on the street.  They also offer valet.",0.9842,0.812,0.167,0.021,0.6577692307692308

After we added two to our reservation of 5 on a Sunday night I think they could tell we were going to be there a while, and yes! We just about closed the restaurant... We ordered the sliders for appetizers and while they tasted yummy the 'meat' part kinda fell apart as we tried to share. For drinks we got scrumptious 'elixirs' that were tasty, non-alcoholic and EXPENSIVE. I was kind of shocked them two of them cost us nearly $20, but I guess you have to try it at least once =) For an entree I got the 'chicken legs' that tasted amazing and came with a yummy sweet potato side. My only problem was that the 'legs' had wooden skewers inside them which I almost broke my tooth off on. From there on in I 'de-boned' the 'chicken' before tucking in. Service was attentive and informed, though a few of my dining partners were miffed that some menu items were sold out upon our arrival.

The plates are not as fancy-looking as Green Zebra's, but they're typically more filling and they're 100% vegan. It's almost overwhelming to see a whole menu full of delicious options! Gluten-free options are marked, but other than the portobello ""steak"", it's pretty much limited to salads, not filling entrees. The focus seems to be on faux meat, but it didn't have the blandness I've come to expect from substitutes. The chicken legs were eerily realistic in flavour and texture except for the wooden skewer ""bone"". The perfectly-tectured salmon dish gained its fishiness from seaweed, and the lemon and oil dressing suited it well. My favourite was the chorizo sliders, which offered many mouthfuls of slightly spicy, cheesy tastiness (more than I expected) and could have been a meal in themselves. I enjoyed the variety of mushrooms on ""Jerry's pizza"", but the crust is quite thin and becomes soft quickly. The fries are fried in grapeseed oil, making them perfectly crispy on the outside. I'll have to try more of the veggie-only (not faux meat) dishes next time. The Bloody Mary I had was more fresh-tasting than usual. They must make the mix themselves! I'd also like to try some of their creative non-alcoholic drinks. So far I haven't saved enough room for dessert, but I'm sure I will be back soon. The decor is fresh, airy and natural-looking, complete with a waterfall wall. There's a lounge area up the stairs with its own bar.

""sorta chocolate cake with coffee grinds"".  people, order another dessert  i've actually had chocolate vegan desserts before that were delicious, but this tiramisu was not. unfortunate. i saved the best for last. their mocktails are DELIGHTFUL. my friend had the ""aloe kombucha"", and i had the ""clip on"".  both were refreshing and tasty.  i'm not a fan of drinks that are overly sweet, or overly tangy, i thought both drinks were very well balanced.   i'd definitely come back for the mocktails and to try out some more of the small plates. one more thing, i thought it was quite funny and stereotypical that 90% of the customers were women.  c'mon men, embrace the tofu.",0.9955,0.766,0.192,0.042,0.6119735989633949

I especially loved the Butternut Squash soup (so creamy!) and the Spring Rolls.  One thing - the small plates/appetizers are difficult to share with more than one person, since they often come beautifully displayed with sauce on the plate.  My main entree was the spaghetti with crab & spicy tomato sauce. WOW!!! The texture of the ""crab"" was great, and I wanted to lick the sauce off the plate (I refrained, since the place is a bit upscale).  The tiramisu was tasty, although it seemed more like an opera cake than tiramisu.  It came with a little scoop of coffee ice cream that had cocoa nibs inside.  I only had one bite of the carrot cake - that was less popular at our table.  It had raisins, I think, and coconut flakes.  I wasn't really a fan of the brussels sprouts - they were a bit dry, but I also tried them after they had gotten cold, so maybe there were better when they first came out. There is also a full bar upstairs with a more casual atmosphere.  Karyn personally came by our dining table and offered us free drinks in the bar.  The bartender made us nice champagne cocktails and even made a special cocktail for a friend who can't have much sugar. I  also had The Southside cocktail, which was dry but with a sweet finish.   The service was also excellent.  The server let us order dishes throughout the meal.  The serving sizes were just right - if you are looking for huge portion sizes that you can take home in a doggie bag, this is not the place.

2010-03-14,3.0,"Well, well, well... isn't that *special*? Passing off mysterious products for delicious delicious meat. Some of it agrees with most digestive tracts. But, some of it can cause serious bloating and other digestive situations that are decidedly unsexy. Hmm. What would make someone do that? What dark lord could convince someone to experiment with others' digestive systems? Could it be... SEITAN? Thankfully, I have the Church Lady on speed dial, so I didn't make the mistake of choking down a gullet full of wheat gluten and be forced to take my sexy back. There would be no bringing it back from what that would have caused. I guess that's sort of my problem with this place. Do what you do and do it well. Faux meat is sorta, by-definition, nasty. I am not saying that I want to eat twigs and rocks but maybe concentrating on a menu that features veggies and spices *solely* might be a good direction for KoG. What I liked: the cauliflower curry. Again, veggies and spices. This is probably something I could order at Mysore Woodlands, but it was nonetheless good. My only suggestion for improvement would be to watch the oil content. My app was a little top-heavy with oil when I received it. Also good: the cocktails. I had an early day the next day, so I actually had a mocktail, but it was delicious. Whoever is making drinks knows what s/he's doing. Fantastic. My entire table was over the moon with our drink selections. Dessert: I had the bananas foster. Delicious. I'm guessing the ice cream was made from soy milk? The banana (is this a veggie or fruit?) was perfectly caramelized. The cinnamon (spice) made the brown sugar pop. And, the rum... just give me a bottle and show yourself out. Rum? It's Like Water for Johnny.  What am I leaving out? Oh yeah, the entree. I wanted to get the arugula salad with the blood orange and pomegranate seeds. They were all out of seeds and I didn't want to order an improperly constructed salad, so I order the linguini fra diavolo (SEITAN!). The 'crab' was made from tofu and from the first bites, I knew I'd made a mistake. The meat truly detracted from the taste of the dish. I couldn't concentrate on the sauce or noodles because of it's off-putting texture and taste. How much more delightful would the spicy red sauce have been with sauteed onions, fresh garlic, earthy mushrooms and lightly chopped kale. Note to the chef: you don't have to put faux meat in your dishes to appeal to meat eaters. Just make vegan dishes with vegan ingredients that taste good. Putting in the faux stuff is...not good.

We were all taken aback by the atmosphere, classy, modern, and clean, while not being stuffy and pretentious.

The meal began with fresh bread, and some amazing vegan butter. We got a variety of plates, all of which were tasty, the highlights being the potato leek soup, the portabello ""steak"" and the awesome french fries which were served with an out of this world BBQ sauce. For dessert we had carrot cake, which was pretty good, though I wouldn't really call it carrot cake... The prices were completely reasonable, and I even commented on how much more satisfied I was with this meal than a recent trip to a different vegetarian restaurant in which i spent $100 on a tasting menu that was wholly lackluster and unimpressive.

2010-03-08,5.0,"Chicago is undergoing a vegan renaissance and Karyn's on Green is the centerpiece of this transformation. As recently as a year ago, I was embarrassed by Chicago's lack of quality vegan restaurants---Chicago is the third largest city in the country and the best it could do was The Chicago Diner (which is overrated and decaying steadily) and Green Zebra (which isn't even fully vegetarian). But Karyn's on Green fixes all of that. It also corrects all of the errors and issues at its sister restaurant, Karyn's Cooked, and emerges as a sophisticated, smart and posh (yet affordable) bar-restaurant that competes with Millennium in San Francisco, Horizons in Philadelphia and Candle 79 in New York. First, Karyn's on Green is upscale, romantic, and cool. This is a great place to take a date or to impress out of town guests who are a) skeptical of vegan food and b) skeptical of Chicago's foodie credentials. Second, the food is awesome. I started off with an order of chorizo sliders ($8). This small plate consisted of two spicy, meaty mini-burgers that left me savoring and loving every bite. For my main plate I had a crispy chicken legs ($14). This dish consisted of three large chicken drumsticks, covered in a fried coating, served atop some swiss chard, sweet potato hash with bits of seitan, and barbecue sauce. It was filling and elegant, yet also down-home and all-American. The ""chicken"" was pretty realistic and the dish came together beautifully. I'm not a huge fan of barbecue sauce, but it worked in this dish; that said, I'd love to see what it would have been like with a different sauce as well. The menu is large and there's a lot of variety; it's one of those menus where you want to try everything. The service was friendly, helpful and welcoming, in stark contrast to the infamously poor service at sister joint Karyn's Cooked. I can't stress one other thing enough: Karyn's on Green is 40-50% cheaper than places like Millennium or Candle 79 or Horizons. The small plates here all are $6-8 a piece and could be full meals in themselves; similarly, the large plates are $12-15 and come in huge portion sizes. So Karyn's on Green is not only upscale and gourmet, but it's also a remarkably good value, which makes me appreciate the place even more. It's accessible and it's the type of place that will win over non-veg people in droves. Karyn's on Green is a masterpiece and catapults Chicago into the big league when it comes to vegan food.

The wine list will appease most, they even have some around $28. On to the food: I ordered the BBQ Meatloaf with fingerling potatoes and bacon.  After having the Meatloaf @ Monty's Blue Plate in Madison, Karyn's fell a bit short.  The dish was bland and the bacon was burnt. I smuggled some of my companions Fried Chicken onto my plate..and felt that the texture was a bit ""stringy"", but the dish wasn't that bad. Getting an extra side of BBQ sauce helped out. As a vegetarian, we have such few options, as such, I am obligated to try Karyn's once again hoping they will incorporate more bold flavors found in dishes served at her more casual restaurant on Wells.",0.9706,0.834,0.157,0.01,0.5607984607984607

2010-02-22,5.0,"I've died and gone to upscale veggie heaven. This is probably the only place on earth where you could have a five-course meal and never know that it was entirely meat-free. I don't know what kind of black magic is going on in the kitchen, but I want more. Nothing about this place screams vegetarian-friendly, so you might mistake it for a traditional white tablecloth steakhouse it you didn't know better. Not that many people are likely to just stumble across it - it's pretty out of the way. And thank god, because that means I can still get a table on three days' notice.  Everything on the menu is vegetarian, if not vegan. Again, you wouldn't know this just from looking at it. Nothing indicates that the crab cakes, scallops and delectible pork sliders are made from soy except for the teeny-tiny initials explained at the bottom of the page. You also wouldn't know this from eating it. The ""meatloaf"" tastes like meatloaf. The ""bacon"" tastes like bacon. The ""fish"" tastes like fish. And this is coming from someone who suffers through eating fake meats, wishing it tasted like the real thing instead of dry cardboard. Here, it does.  We split three small plates (pork sliders, crab cakes and mushroom risotto) and the meatloaf entree. All were amazing. If I could eat here every day, I wouldn't think twice about not eating a cheeseburger ever again. The only low note was that the risotto was a bit too rich for me, but Rick was practically licking the plate. The portions aren't gigantic, so doing the three small plates and one large, or two small and two large, is about right for a couple. You will even have room for dessert, which we skipped but will be back for. They also apparently have brunch. I'm interested to see if Karyn's can carry the magic over to breakfast.  Our server was great. Attentive but not hovery, and she made good recommendations. She also informed us that there are two sister restaurants, that do cooked and raw foods, respectively. I'm not so much with the raw, but will definitely be stopping by Karyn's Cooked.",0.9886,0.796,0.144,0.06,0.5835333526123

Chorizo sliders + butternut squash soup were both good Cauliflower dish would be really good but was bland Salt and pepper shakers only have salt and salt...no pepper...same type of salt in each shaker...weird.    Shepard's pie was a bit sweet and not something I would order again I give this place 3 stars because it's close to my house and the ambience is  very beautiful and comfortable for conversation.",0.9837,0.786,0.176,0.038,0.6653759820426488
2010-02-21,5.0,"My sister and I had such a pleasant experience here.  I wanted to try this place because I've been vegetarian for a year and am looking into veganism. We went here on an early Saturday evening.  The decor is upscale, contemporary, minimalist.  I felt underdressed despite wearing work attire, but the staff was very welcoming and down-to-earth, especially our waitress. We enjoyed everything we had, specifically: Drinks - I had the Emerald Sun Green Tea, which is green tea with a refreshing hit of flower.  My sister had the Aloe-Kombucha Cooler ""mocktail.""  She said the first sip was a bit bitter, but after she stirred it up and let the ice melt a little, she like it.  I had a taste of it too and thought it was fantastic!  I've never had aloe vera before, but this is what I would imagine it would taste like if I had.  There is just a hint of it at the end.  The lemon makes it very refreshing.  We also liked the fact that our waitress offered us a different drink because my sister didn't seem thrilled with it at first, but we declined after giving the drink a little more time. Appetizers - I had the mushroom risotto, which was delicious!  It is on the salty side, however, for those who watch their sodium intake.  My sister had the heirloom beets, which were very light and refreshing. Entrees - I had the shepherd's pie.  I've never eaten seitan before, but I suprisingly loved it!  No funny aftertaste as I've had with other mock meats.  It is also very filling.  I could barely finish half of it because my risotto had filled me up beforehand.  My sister had the portobello steak.  She felt this was delicious and light as well.  She especially liked the spinach that was included. Desserts - I had the banana's foster, which oh-so satisfied my sweet tooth.  My sister had the coconut cake, another light choice. If you're looking for light and refreshing options (yet still filling), I would choose my sister's eats.  If you're looking for heavier options (because you are super starving), I would choose my eats. Overall, we had a great experience.  The atmosphere and the view (Sears Tower and that castle building--the name escapes me--next to it) make for a great evening out.  I also appreciate that it's near my alma mater, UIC, which is great for a school whose students come from such diverse backgrounds and most likely has a number of vegetarians/vegans as well.  The menu prices were reasonable for such an upscale restaurant (another plus for students).  The staff was very knowledgeable and helpful with the menu. The food was excellent and a great introduction to the vegan world.   Wonderful to know that being a vegan doesn't mean eating grass all day and sacrificing taste!  Bravo!",0.9988,0.761,0.214,0.025,0.6482878787878787

Best cheesecake ever! Going into the restaurant I had no expectations cause I knew it just opened, with that said it blew my mind. -Arugula Salad: the blood oranges just made the salad. Perfectly seasoned and the pomegranate seeds gave it the perfect texture. I'm not a big fan of fennel but this salad made me love it! It showed me that if you use it correctly it can be amazing. -Jerry's Pizza: my boyfriend loved it. I only had a bite cause I wanted to save room but you can never go wrong with mushrooms on a pizza! -Chicken Wings: the chicken was great! I wonder if the house makes it. The bbq sauce was meh. It tasted like ketchup and onions. If you're going to have faux meat at the least accompany it with really fantastic sauce or sides. Am I wrong here? -Terrine: Again I didn't expect much for a vegan dessert but it was incredible! The plating made me want to wear my vegan stilettos! It came with this raspberry sorbet that the incredibly nice waitress said to be raw which amazed me.  -Service: everyone was so nice. Waitress wasn't the most knowledgeable but she always came back and answered my questions. The gentleman at the host stand was very professional but personal.  -The only reason why I'm rating this so low is not cause of the food. I think everything was great with a few tweeks here and there. Its just my boyfriend and I were there for Valentine's day and we wanted something romantic. How can we look lovingly into each other's eyes when all we hear is some old man yelling at his waitstaff the whole time? Some guy was yelling at everyone. He wasn't in the front of the restaurant but he sounded like he was at our table yelling. We honestly felt bad. He sounded like a slave laborer and he didn't care that the customers could hear him. I just feel something simple like keeping your voice down is a simple fix and for the fact that no one told him to hush down made the whole experience bad.

There weren't many there yet, so we had our pick of the place and choose an intimate little nook in the back banquettes. The space was stylish, yet inviting. Service proved impeccable. We started out w/ the crab cakes, which days later, I'm still trying to figure out how they emulated a crab texture! In the interim, we were served small, warm individual loaves of bread with a tasty herb butter. For mains, I chose the chicken tenders, which arrived 3 to a plate, on top of a bed of sweet potato hash, a bit of sauteed spinach and barbecue sauce. I enjoyed it quite a bit. My husband got the BBQ bacon meatloaf with fingerling potatoes and escarole. I tried it, it was delicious, but the bacon was a little overdone. And, we also split a side of baked mac and cheese, which served piping hot, was good, although a tad bland Teeze cheese is not my fave imposter in the world of fake cheeses). The cocktail list was also quite intriguing, so my husband ordered a sidecar, which was refreshingly grapefruit-citrusy. I opted for a glass of wine, but mentioned to our server that I was surprised that they served sazerac, having had a brush with one on my bday a few months ago (it tried to kill me). She advised me to give the drink another chance.  Well, a few minutes later, one showed up at our table compliments of the bartender, who even came over to discuss it with me, and I have to tell you, it was FANTASTIC! You can tell he's devoted to the craft of mixology. As a vegan, I've come to really cherish dessert, since that's the one thing I can't easily emulate on my own, so I saved some room and we split the chocolate terrine, which was the perfect end to a wonderful dinner. It tasted like flourless chocolate cake, which I adore, accompanied by a slice of pear and a really nice raspberry sorbet. All in all, a really enjoyable experience.

Service: our waitress was a bit clueless about everything, but in sorta a charming way, so we didn't mind at all.  The only service complaint i had is that they delivered every dish to the wrong person every time.  It's a minor thing, but it should be that hard to remember who ordered what.  9 dishes, all to the wrong people, 6 drinks, all to the wrong people..  Other than that, very attentive, without being over the top. Karyn came over to welcome us towards the end of the meal, and our friend got all giddy at meeting Karyn, it was very cute.  She invited us upstairs after dinner to have a drink, and we took her up on her offer. Drinks: Delicious.  We tried several, and although quite pricey, they were yummy.

Nice guy, right? We got there early because we had tickets to a show later.  The ambiance is cool & the space is fantastic.  Our waitress, Nikki, was very eager at first, but after a bit, she was really quite wonderful.

2010-02-02,5.0,"Hands down best new Vegan spot in Chicago!   So my friend and I decided to try Karyn's on Green last night, but when we drove by we weren't sure we were dressed up enough.  Well we decided to go in anyway and as it turns out, it doesn't matter how you're dressed - all of the employees were so friendly when we walked in too. The décor is amazing and the location is huge...shall I say the décor is amazing again?  Because it is!  This is a GREAT spot to take anyone on a date or a friend to a nice diner without the terribly high prices.  We were pleasantly surprised when we saw the prices, although they're not super cheap, the main courses averaged around $14. The food was amazing and presented nicely (and fancy-like), here's what we got:: ""Crab Cakes"" (appetizer):  These were amazing and that's coming from someone that doesn't like crab or imitation crab.  You get two crab cakes, sauteed spinach, and mustard sauce with this appetizer. ""Fried Chicken Legs"" (my meal):  This entree is like vegan heaven; the ""chicken"" legs have a consistency that closely resembles the real deal (mind you I haven't had chicken in over 20 years, but I'd like to think I remember the consistency).  This dish is served with sweet potato hash (I substituted this for the ""Baked Mac & Cheese""), Swiss chard (with little sausage bits), and Kentucky Bourbon barbecue sauce. ""Baked Mac & Cheese"" (my side):  This was good, but I thought it was bland overall.  It tasted much better when I added a lot of salt to it.  The thing that differentiated this dish from other vegan mac & cheese dishes it that it had cheese that melts on it, nice. ""BBQ Bacon Meatloaf"" (my non-vegan friend's meal):  This is served with horseradish roasted fingerlings, escarole, and Kansas City BBQ sauce.  My friend absolutely loved this dish and proceeded to talked about it the whole ride home.  I had a taste of this at the restaurant and agree that it was very good. ""Chocolate Terrine"" (dessert):  This comes with compressed pear, salted cashew mousse, raspberry sorbet, and cocoa nibs.  Needless to say, this dish was mind blowing.  The sorbet tasted homemade too, it was so good!   Overall this place gets an A+ in my book; I will surely bring all of my friends here, vegan or not.  :) ***Update*** I've been here 4 times now and have tried additional (amazing) things: ""Chorizo Sliders"" (appetizer):  Best appetizer ever!  They come with bacon, frisee, vegan cheese, chipotle aioli, tomato-pepper jam and are about the size of those White Castle burgers. ""Linguini Fra Diavolo"" (meal):  Is a spicy tomato sauce with crab meat and whole wheat pasta.  This meal was very good and had the right amount of kick to it.   ""Banana's Foster"" (dessert):  My new favorite dessert!  It comes with dark rum, vanilla bean ice cream, caramelized bananas, coconut tuile, and citrus dust....amazing!   Overall, Karyn's has never disappointed me, all of the food is amazing.",0.9991,0.742,0.227,0.032,0.6091787143673936

Lounge upstairs is kinda small, with TV playing ESPN.  Karyn was in the night we were there and came to our table to see how everything was and told us that first drink was on her.  So we took advantage, went upstairs to lounge and bartender whipped up these delish drinks based on our fave-o drinks.    I loved Karyn's on Green.  It doesn't have that stuffy ""we are too cool for you"" feel at all.  Very welcoming and warm and I felt very comfortable there.  I will definitely go back hopefully often, if I can get the boyfriend out of the house in this Chicago winter.",0.999,0.731,0.241,0.028,0.6034768009768009

To start, I had the potato-leek soup, which was tasty and beautifully presented, topped with red and green pepper sauces.  Unfortunately, I did find the soup slightly glutinous and perhaps slightly overcooked.  I also had the Caesar salad, which was simple but refreshing.  As an entree, I tried the grilled Portobello mushroom, which was perfectly cooked (not blackened, but not rubbery) on a bed of mashed potatoes and grilled asparagus, if I remember correctly.  Finally, for desert, I had the chocolate terrine, which was a miniature brownie-slash-candy-bar served artfully with a scoop of raspberry sorbet and carmel (?) sauce.  Very delicious. In addition to the food, I was pleasantly surprised to find a great selection of organic cocktails and tonics, inspired by some classic recipes from the nineteenth and mid-twentieth centuries.  I had the Sidecar (more citric than I'm used to but extremely smooth and refreshing), and a coconut water and orange-based elixir (non-alcoholic) called the ""Clip On.""  It was amazing. I visited on a Wednesday evening, only two days after the space was open to the public, so things were still coming together.  Nonetheless, I found the service to be extremely friendly and attentive. The wait staff seemed enthusiastic; my water glass was always filled; the manager (I'm presuming from his coat and tie) stopped by every table to see how they were doing.  As is often the case in her other locations, Karyn floated around as well, spending a few minutes with each group to share a tidbit of her philosophy on healthy food and lifestyle. I was a bit disappointed to learn that they will not be offering cooking classes or ""Karyn's at Home"" weekly meals at this location.  I was hoping to swing by on my way home from work and stock my fridge with healthy vegetarian eats.  But they do plan to open a market in the upstairs section with some of their most popular dishes eventually, so I'm very much looking forward to that. So far, they are open only for dinner, but plan to open for lunch and Sunday brunch later in the week. Overall, I'm excited to see how this place evolves and plan to become a regular.  In fact, I may go back tonight.",0.9969,0.826,0.154,0.02,0.5519200799200799
