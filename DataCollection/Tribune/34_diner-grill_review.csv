Hashbrowns, mediocre quality burger patties, fake American cheese, boring white bread buns. But late night greasy food... what more do you expect? It's cooked as well as it can be and in front of you in minutes.  The Slinger is NOT worth it though. It's just hashbrowns + 2 cheeseburger patties + egg + really mediocre chili.

We found some parking in the front which was not to hard to do at this late hour of the night. Walked into what looked like a old train car at one time or a trailer home. The place was brightly lit up and not very crowded which was a plus because there were not many seats in the place to start off with. So we flopped our ass at the counter and looked over what they had to eat. From looking at the grill I knew this was going to be another butter pit were everything was caked in butter for flavoring. I was wrong about that. My friend ordered a bowl of chili and a double burger and fries. I ordered some dish called the Slinger which consisted of the following toppings. A plate full of hash browns, Covered with Chili and onions with cheese, a hamburger pattie and two sunny side up egg's.  I was told if I could eat it all It would be free. Well I tried my best to eat it all there is just to much food there for one man to consume with a gut full of beer to go with it. The dish as awful as it sounds was pretty damn good with a little hot sauce it was even better. I don't think we will see Rachael Ray showing how too make this anytime soon it was real good.

A bacon cheeseburger is more than a dollar and a half cheaper than the sandwiches we got, and a DOUBLE bacon cheeseburger is about 10 cents more than a bacon grilled cheese.

For my Illini peepz, I consider it the city's version of Merry Ann's stack: hash browns, onions, cheeseburger, eggs, toast...and the whole thing is drowned in chili.  Not the same as sausage gravy, but quite delicious nonetheless.  Happily earned my certificate of completion last night. Also, because it was my friend's birthday, they made her a special birthday treat: a giant pancake penis, with a scoop of ice cream at the tip.  Might've been inappropriate to some...but those losers don't come to Diner Grill at 3am.  Us and the whole diner were laughing our asses off - I think we had more fun here than we would have if we tried to find another bar at that hour!  Good stuff, DG!",0.9849,0.77,0.187,0.043,0.489360119047619

I'd like to think that when ordering a sign, the owner either wasn't sure what to call the place or perhaps wasn't sure how to spell the choice he wanted. Not wanting to waste his time on such a decision, he said, ""Aw fuck it, have it say both!"" and then left the room to drink a case of beer and watch the Bears. The internet jukebox in the corner and the weekend post-bar crowd are the only things that detract from the authentic seediness of the joint. Otherwise you really get the feeling that this place hasn't changed much since it opened. As a matter a fact, I don't think Kenny - the paper-hatted, burger-slinging, fry-cook extraordinaire - has so much as changed his shirt since then. The fryer recently went up in flames so for the time being all orders of fries are replaced with hash browns. Your meal, which will be greasy and delicious, will be served on a paper plate and ready for you before you know it. You will pay with cash and if you come in enough, Kenny may pour you a free shot from a $7 bottle of whiskey he keeps under the counter. You will drink this out of a styrofoam cup.

When we came in with a group of hungry drunken Rugby players, I was eager to see what the hoopla was about. Having stuck to my annual ""Sober October"" ritual, I was completely coherent and hungry for some good diner style grub. The space is T-I-N-Y with only a few seats at the counter. Get there during peak bar hours, and you'll be greeted with a nice wait. I usually have no problem waiting to be seated, but at 3am, my patience wears thin! Sadly, the food didn't live up to the hype. I LOVE greasy spoons, but the food was so so. I had a burger. It was ok. I wish they served fries, but the hash browns had a nice flavor. Those 3 sentences are the most I can muster about my meal. Naturally, the rest of my group ordered Slingers and woofed them down like they were in an eating contest. As the plates were cleared one was bragging at the speed of consumption vs my boyfriend's boast of taking down the dish with an additional side of bacon. In the end it became painfully obvious that the appeal of Diner Grill was being able to get the nasties goopiest meal possible to kill the drunken munchies in a North Side institution. We had a good time during our short (eat and get out - people are waiting for your seat!) visit, and the Touch Tunes machine made for some great singalongs to some horrible songs. Based on atmosphere alone, Diner Grill might get the nod on another night in another month.

The famous Slinger was everything I hoped it would be, and I was horrified that I packed it all in. I think the cooks were astonished too. If you're going to order this dish, my only suggestion is to sub sausage patties for the hamburger, or if you prefer hamburger ask for bacon on top.    Diner Grill is greasy spoon perfection. It's dirty but not over the top. The cooks are surly but humorous And the food is swathed with the right amount of grease. The Slinger is the most expensive menu item at $8.50, but it's large enough to share with a couple of people.  Stumble over there after a long night of drinking.

2008-07-02,5.0,"OK, it is time to set the record straight. Yes, the Slinger is a sight to behold, and an adventure to eat (or is the adventure after you eat it?). I've got my certificate and earned every bit of it. And from all the reviews, the Slinger is well known and has earned its due. However, to me the real prize of the Diner Grill is an item that I've not seen listed on the menu board. Several years ago when Rich was still the cook, I was contemplating aloud what I should eat to help soak up my evening's bender (no Slinger on this fateful night). Me: ""Hmm, a bacon cheeseburger sure sounds good. But the garbage omelet is always really good too. Eggs always hit the spot at this hour."" Rich: ""Why don't you just have both?"" Me: ""Really? I can do that??""  Rich: ""Sure. These Irish guys (points to end of counter) do it all the time"" So I offer for your consideration what Rich recommended to me on that fateful night - the bacon double cheeseburger with fried egg. Now it is not unusual to find establishments that will put an egg on your burger. I've sampled them all over. However, there is something special about the Diner's take on this that sets it apart. Perhaps it is the grease. Maybe it is how the fried egg is never overdone and the yolk pours all over the burger. The pickles are a nice touch. Certainly the bacon helps. As do the thin burger patties that allow me to go for full artery clogging action by making it a double. I'm pretty sure ""Elvira"" by the Oak Ridge Boys was playing that night/morning also.  I don't know why the concept seemed so unusual to me on that particular night, but that is all I've ordered ever since. And while I give it 5 stars, don't be fooled - it is a diner. In a trailer. This is not Spiaggia. I do wish the crappy jukeboxes that were on the counter were still there instead of the new fancy one on the far wall. But aside from that, the Diner Grill remains a standout, quintessential late night diner food. Thank you Rich.",0.9864,0.837,0.143,0.02,0.5757000811688312

About a month ago I found myself in the diner at roughly 4am, prime slinger ordering hour, and shit was going off! (Note: Yes, I realize this place always gets rowdy in the wee hours of the morning, but there was something special in the air.) Some piece of trash older gentleman ordered a slinger, a stack of pancakes, french toast, a side of bacon, a cheeseburger, and coffee. He refused to sit at the counter, instead choosing to stand in the back corner, scowling at anyone who came near him or his food. I hope he's dead now. Meanwhile, some young hooligans out on the town had wandered in for some slingers of their own. A guy in his early 20s requested that his slinger be made up of the table scraps of three half eaten slingers left on the counter. His wish was granted and the chef scraped the remains on one plate, threw a few dollops of butter on top and off he went. His meal ended up being on the house; talk about good service! Health code be damned, they'll give you what you want. When I left with my friend we both threw up in the snow on the side of the building.

A couple of reasons/examples why I like this place: -Ken, the chef/order taker, is a guy that takes a lot of verbal shit, but spits it right back in a non-Weiner Circle way.  Specifically, I'm in the place around 3 a.m. or so one morning and a couple of  ""dudes"" come in to the place (think Alumni Club - Schaumburg type dudes) looking for some grub.  While ordering,  they ask Ken what kind of cheese are on the cheeseburgers.  His simple response, a Carson-like blank stare down the bar line and a ""you're kidding.""  Personally, I think the dudes should've gotten a certificate banning them for life from the place.  Alas, they were serverd, government cheese and all. -On one of my more impressive 6:30 a.m. night outs I came here with two Diner newbies, one of whom was a Packers fan.  The Bears were playing the Packers that morning so the cook made a pancake that he thought was fit for a Packer fan.  As far as the shape of the Packer Pancake goes, let's just say it rhymed with ""rock n'halls"" and required a whip cream topping. Now, why I took off one star from my rating: -The place is losing a bit of its old-old-old school charm.  I walked in earlier this year and saw the enormous jukebox, bose speaker system and re-done duct work and thought WTF?  Add those changes to the word getting out on this place and you have a recipe for burnout.  Still, I asked Ken about the changes and he just shook his head, took a drag from his cig and finished making me a bacon sandwich.
