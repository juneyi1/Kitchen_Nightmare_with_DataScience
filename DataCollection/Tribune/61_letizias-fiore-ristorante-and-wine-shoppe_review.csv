2016-04-03,5.0,"Highly recommended!  I have rarely had such an amazing overall experience.  Service was spot on. But the food... The food! Had never tried a hand-made pasta called trofie.  It's so good and the sauce was perfect.  Also the table-side polenta was truly the best I have ever had. Lots of options for the vegetarians who were with us.  The owner was consistently rounding on every table to ensure every guest was having a great experience.  Then we splurged and had some shared desserts. I couldn't choose a favorite. The chocolate cake, the caramel cheesecake, and the tiramisu were all so very good.  And I have to add that I am very particular about dessert - usually I just pass it up.  I'm so glad we didn't!  I will always come here when I'm in town!",0.9889,0.733,0.251,0.016,0.6135555555555555
2016-03-30,5.0,"The food here was absolutely amazing. I couldn't believe they had both wild boar and venison on the menu. Our waiter was super nice, and the atmosphere made it feel like we were in Europe rather than in Logan Square. The Tiramasu, while not what I expected was truly excellent. After eating we went down to the speakeasy where I had a delicious cocktail. I would definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a good place to eat in Logan Square.",0.9844,0.672,0.328,0.0,0.6755555555555557
2016-03-23,4.0,"Another great spot in our hood. We wanted to do a grub crawl but got here and stayed. I went because I'm addicted to wood fired pizza. I'll get back to that. We were quickly and graciously greeted by our server Steven who went over the specials and quickly got us a drink and some calamari. The space was warm and cozy. He picked my girl a nice glass of red I had a Stiegle on tap! The calamari was decent, not as good as BT's down the street closed on Monday hence our first visit here. We then split their Brussels sprout / arugula salad, a knock out! My favorite use of arugula ever. When discussing the pizza, Steven in his most professional, tactful way tried to explain that this place is clueless about pizza. He warned me that it would be a soggy mess in the middle but have nice crust on the edges. I ordered one anyway as I said I have a pizza problem. Here is what bugs me. Their oven was perfectly hot. I passed it on the way in. The ingredients were generous and of high quality. The dough was a nice dough. It really wanted to be a good pie. The execution is where they fell on their face. It was exactly as Steven had warned it would be. It was great along the edges and a bowl of pizzaish soup in the middle. So close yet so far! No biggy, I took it home and added more dough and cheese and rebaked it the next night. Now we also got their fungi pasta.....swoon! To say we both loved this dish was an understatement! Perfectly textured fresh pasta just covered in killer rich truffle cream sauce and tons of shrooms! No joke this may be my favorite pasta dish ever. We will be back for this alone! Steven picked my girl a different wine for this course, listening to what she wanted he got her a nice super Tuscan that we both loved. He packed up our pizza soup and as we were chatting about all being industry and clearly not impressed by the gloop. He brought us each an Amaro and an truly amazing tiramisu! I'm scared to say how much I enjoyed them together. I just can't admit to liking Amaro. I'm afraid I'll grow a mustash and get skinny jeans and a cowboy shirt and start making my own bitters! Anyway. Great service, salad, drinks and pasta. The pizza reminds me of the classic movie the jerk in that it should be served in a cup.",0.9957,0.69,0.201,0.109,0.5768171296296296

2015-11-05,5.0,"Solid pizza place.  We had a gilt city deal that included 2 drinks and a pizza each for a nice price. I made a reso using open table and hopped on over on a Thursday night when they have jazz or some other live music in an adjacent room.  We were greeted and seated quickly and told the specials. I quickly picked one of the specials as soon as I heard the world truffle in the ingredients. Hubby had the basil and ricotta which has globs of gooey cheese. When the pizzas came out, I realized there was meat on my pizza. I asked the waiter if it was a mistake and he said nope. It was just my impulsiveness, not listening to the rest of the ingredients. I asked if we could switch for anything else and without a problem or any attitude, he got me another amazing mushroom and truffle pizza in a jiffy.  The place was a little tight with seating but had cute decor with an intimate vibe. I thought the food was solid and the wonderful customer service just took it to the next level. I was full and tipsy by the time i left (2 most important post-meal feelings!) and didn't make it to the Jazz as it was a weekday but I would definitely go back and check it out.",0.9702,0.875,0.118,0.008,0.49553571428571425
2015-10-31,2.0,"We went here on a lark. We wanted a decent dinner without dealing with the crowds on the Square. So, we found Letizia's on an Open Table search. But we didn't make a reservation, and this seems to have been a mistake. When we told the fellow (manager?) that we didn't have a ""resie"", we were escorted to the basement...excuse me, the ""Speakeasy"". First impressions of the place is that it's cute and well put together, but the basement was, well, a basement, complete with giant trash can and smelly mop bucket.  We like to go out to eat and spend a little more than the food is probably worth for the experience. Atmosphere is very important. The last thing I want is to look at a trash can with dirty dishes pilled on top and smell bleachy mop water while I'm drinking a $9 glass of wine. The basement area was a mess. It seemed as though they had thrown it together with little thought to its actual utility. But more importantly the SMELL was terrible.  Our server did her best under the circumstances. This place clearly has some management issues. There were 6 or 7 tables in the basement and one server. This wouldn't be such an issue, if they hadn't sat ALL of the tables within a 20 minute period. Our poor server was slammed, but she handled it with a smile. Meanwhile, other servers and the *owner* simply looked on without lending a hand. So, it took us much longer to actually get food and drinks than it really should have. We left a big tip for our lovely server. Meanwhile, the wet mop sat in the corner smelling up the place and the phone rang LOUDLY and incessantly. It felt more like a crappy sports bar than a nice-ish restaurant.  I figured that the main dining room upstairs would be packed when we left - surely this would explain why we were relegated to the bowels of the building. Alas, there were at least 4 empty tables when we left. I'm sure the upstairs experience is far superior. The food was good, though our order was wrong (we didn't say anything as we were moving into hour 2 and needed to get to a party). A messed up order happens in that chaos (again, management should have stepped in to help our server). I haven't written a yelp review in years. I don't like to complain in public forums unless it is to serve some purpose for others. So, I just want to warn potential patrons to ask to NOT be sat in the basement. And hopefully, the management will see this and do something about it. Take into consideration that your patrons are not just paying for food, but also for the experience. Build a broom closet, for crying out loud. Organize the place and make sure the musty basement, mop water smells are gone before you ask people to eat there. I also plan to write an e-mail to the restaurant to alert them to these issues.  I'm sorry to say that, despite the delicious food, we probably won't be back.",0.9698,0.773,0.135,0.092,0.5286147186147186

Don't get me wrong, the pasta here is fresh and it was good. But I found the portions small, the food (again, very tasty and obviously fresh) pretty standard, but the thing that makes my review so low is this place was expensive.  I don't see any reason to pay fifteen dollars for pasta with marinara and peas. Not very filling. Just not a spot for people who don't like to burn their money. It was a very nice set up inside, and the staff was attentive and even helpful with recommendations. (Not just looking to tack on the bill, but actually helpful and knowledgeable. They pitch well.)

2015-08-13,4.0,"Love this place.  Our first time here was last April when we stumbled upon it using Yelp reviews. We had pasta (forgot what we had, but it was great) and then went downstairs to their Speakeasy for a post-dinner drink.  We promised that when we returned, we'd try the pizza made in their wood-burning pizza oven.  Fast forward more than a year later and we made our way our to Letizia's from our River North hotel. The restaurant was weirdly empty, but oh well!  No one to judge us for eating too much. And bonus: we learned that Tuesday and Wednesday are $10 pizza night. (All pizzas on the menu are $10.)  We started with the calamari saute appetizer.  Delicious!  Next time we might just order that for our entree! We then had the Caprese Invernale.  Turns out I'm not much of a fan of roasted tomatoes. It was ok, but I'll skip it next time.  We ordered the Capricciosa pizza with an egg on top, and then followed with dessert (chocolate cake thing).  Pizza was great.  We also ordered a bottle of wine with dinner. Service starts with the usual bread and olive oil.  The bread wasn't anything too special. Service was excellent.  It's very relaxing. They have a lovely outdoor dining area plus a small bocce ball court.   What makes Letizia's so special is its relaxed vibe, consistently good food, atmosphere (great music track), and service. It's worth it to make your way here. Get away from the crowded, noisy restaurants with long waits and average food. Letizia's is about 4 blocks north of the California exit off the Blue Line, so easy to get to/from downtown (for you out-of-owners). There's also a Divvy station right next to the restaurant.",0.9932,0.764,0.177,0.06,0.4394345238095239

Got the del Bosco and loved the mushrooms. But, the crust and oven-fire cooking made the real different. We're sure all of the pizzas are delicious and intend to find out. Give us time.

The server would disappear for long stretches and it took forever to get anything, from her or the assisting waitstaff. We had to ask for drink refills and more bread (and were lucky if they came quickly... or at all). One of my guests was condescended to when asked if they just had basic spaghetti: ""Ha um, no, we don't have that here."" (She actually laughed a little. Nice.) After waiting 15-20 minutes to finally order, she told us she'd ""just found out"" that they were out of all three of their meat pastas. ALL THREE. There are only 7 or 8 pastas in total! And really? At 6:00 on a Sunday? The food wasn't bad but it wasn't good. Oh and they messed up one of the pizzas, of course for the person she was rude to earlier. Even getting the food was an ordeal... it took 5 solid minutes to get everyone's food out, despite the fact that three people were serving. And then the check... we were charged for two bottles of a particular wine instead of glasses, and the funniest part is that person had only had one glass because she never brought the second one they'd asked for. And while I understand that mistakes happen, she didn't even take ownership of the error! She blamed it on someone else in the back! She was definitely the worst part but the service was terrible overall. I have several more examples but I'll end it here. You get the picture. I feel terrible that I put my family through that.

The pizzas were dispassionately average.  The salami and the sausage on the pizzas were very unimpressive, and the dough/crust was majorly disappointing for having come out of a wood fired oven.   The pasta was ok, but nothing I felt I couldn't make at home.  I'm happy to have this place in the neighborhood, and I might come back in a pinch, but i'd rather go to Reno for Pizza, or drive a little further for better pasta.  I'm hoping it was an off night.  I'll go back and give it another shot, but i was expecting better on my first foray.",0.9808,0.704,0.218,0.078,0.5938492063492063

Very generous portion for the price, and it featured some excellent prosciutto. Highly recommended. The pastas are all made in house. The gnocchi was great, tagliatelle was excellent, sauces were so good, and the portions will satisfy even the hungriest diners.  The only notes I have are related to the service.

2015-01-29,5.0,"I actually signed up on Yelp to drop this review. This was my first experience with this place, and what an interesting one! Want to know why? Was looking for some good Italian that delivered, and this place popped up on my radar. Reviews were positive, so I gave it a shot, especially since the arancini was highly recommended, and after a stint in Boston's North End... That stuff is like crack. All in. So, I place my order over the phone, arancini and the papardelle with mushrooms and truffle butter. I get the standard 55-1hr delivery time. 90 Hangry minutes later, no food, so I call. They say the food went out some time ago, so try to get a hold of the driver, and get nothing.  They offer to fire up a new order for me and get it over quickly.  I get a call about 20 minutes later, and I'm surprised the host can hear me over the sounds my stomach is making: somewhere between stretching rubber and a frog croaking.  What the host, Lindsay said next put an immediate stop to that.  ""We apologize, this hasn't happened before, so tonight your Meal is on us. The owner is on his way to your house right now to apologize and bring you your meal."" What??? Holy shizz, I was floored! This one star review based on service just catapulted to five stars faster than Hussain Bolt on a case of Redbull! As he says his fair well, the other driver shows up with the original order, over two hours later. Comedy ensues. (Dinner AND a show?!) Normally, I would post some pic of the food, but it was in to-go containers and wouldn't be nearly as fair to a place that prides itself on it's product as much as they do. So? I'll just tell you how it was. The arancini had sausage inside with a nice red sauce around them. It came with some bread as well. The papardelle with mushrooms and truffle butter? Well... You could put truffle butter on a shoe and it would be the best thing you ever ate. This was not much different. They also included a wonderful slice of cheese cake to top it off. Totally not expected. For the food? I had to go back to a four star rating.  Fast forward to the following day. Based on the amazing customer service experience and four star food, I have to give these guys another shot, as it was that good the night before. Night two? Arancini... Again. Strangely, it was better than before. Also, ordered the Tagliatelle Rosina with sausage and peas in a nice creamy sauce. The food this time? Boom: five stars. Delivery?

We had the great arancini filled with goat cheese, wonderful tortellini and the marinara pizza that comes without cheese but great tomato and basil. Dessert: chocolate cake! Letizia stopped by the table (as she did with all tables) to ask how it went, we discussed the different recipes and the great dough. She gave me some good cooking advices. Service was top and pricing is just right. We also had each a glass of wine. Food here is made with natural and fresh ingredients. It is simple as Italian food is, not mixing 10 veggies in a plate, just a couple so you know what you are eating and can enjoy the products. We like that, some people like many sauces, many spices and tons of veggies and meat in the same plate, but that is not what Italian food is about and I appreciate a place that gets it right.

I was seated right away even though my date didn't show up yet which was nice and they also served me bread and olive oil while I waited.  She finally arrived and we decided to go with the whole experience. We started out with the Arancini Cardinale which was fried rice balls with cheese and beets. Three delicious treats floating ever so lightly on their marinara which was great for Fare la scarpetta! For those who don't know that is the ritual of using the table bread to sop up the sauce.  We also got a caprese salad which was full of flavor but way too cold in my opinion. Not a deal breaker and it was tasty but I don't want to taste the cold initially.  The main dishes were the star of the show. My dish was the Fall special - Sweet Potato Gnocchi with sage butter.. it was great! My date had the salmon ravioli and that was good too. We complemented the meal with a really bold Sangiovese which I forgot the name but it went well with the meal. We ended with a slice of pumpkin pie which was decent.. It was surounded by these spots of sugary caramel spots that were great for dipping.  Overall it was a good dining experience with delicious food, attentive service and a pleasant environment to eat in.

We were seated outside on their side seating area and it took about 10 minutes for the server to even acknowledge our presence. The buser was very attentive and we probably talked to him twice before I asked him to ask about our server. The server came over and took our order for wine and salads and then we did not see him again for 20 minutes at our table, he walked by us a couple times, but never acknowledged our existence when we tried to get his attention to order our main courses. He then just drops off our salads and wine and then again walks away for awhile. He took our main course order finally about an hour after we sat down. He made excuses that the restaurant was poorly laid out and not conducive providing easy service and that is what the delay was, but how is that possible when you walk by your tables and ignore them multiple times when they are trying to get your attention. That is not a layout issue, that is a server issue.  The food was so so, but the service was so bad we discussed twice just asking the buser to tell our server to bring our check (once before our salads arrived and once after they did before we ordered our main meal).

Kraig is a new bartender there and he made a perfectly balanced drink with basil vodka, campari, aperol and orange San Pelligrino. I'll be drinking it on their giant patio in the summertime!

We started with the wood-fired mushroom caps - highly recommended. The caprese salad had super fresh burrata - so fresh that I had to know where it was from because I suspected they might even make it themselves (they get it from not far). And the pizza is killer. Again, super fresh mozzarella, very flavorful sauce, and wood-fired. Our server, Vittorio, an actual Italian waiter at an Italian restaurant (pretty rare in Chicago), gave great description of all the dishes and all-around excellent service. It should be noted that the restaurant is owned by Italians from Italy, not the second- or third-generation Italians that usually serve up canned tomato sauce and make food that scarcely resembles its origins.

The server couldn't remember the specials or the table numbers. And if he was new he should not have been working cause it was a Friday night. The only thing good about the meal was my drink, called UGO. Their ""popular"" salad, insalata estiva, was topped with FROZEN broccolini, not slightly frozen, but hit with your fork ice cube frozen. What kind of restaurant uses frozen vegetables for their salads, really?  My first bite was a broccolini ice cube, not a pleasant 1st impression. The server never bothered to check on how it was, but I left it on the side of the dish and explained to the bus boy that he needs to tell the server. My pizza was the rucola, I asked for w/o the prosciutto( I think that was the meat on it) Anyway, it was just a hard cooked, crispy pizza crust topped with olive oil and mounds of arugula and shaved parmesan, that is it.  It was basically an arugula salad on an overly crispy pizza crust, with mounds of sea salt. It was way TOO SALTY. I've had arugula pizza many times before, I did notice on the menu it said no sauce, but I was surprised there was no mozzarella or other cooked cheese topping under the arugula. Maybe that is their chef's special twist, but you might as well order a salad. My sixteen year old had the artichoke ravioli, I tried it, the pasta was not even cooked properly.  Then the dish was covered in black pepper, not cracked black pepper. like cheap table pepper, all around the plate and over the four giant empanada looking pieces of pasta. There was too much pepper. They need to fire their chef, if the only seasoning he knows is salt & table pepper, and he can't even control the use of that. Pathetic! If I had not gone w/o eating all day I would have sent it all back, the entire meal was a disaster.  They should apologize for wasting my time & money.

I understand that they probably can't make gluten free in the kitchen full of flour, but the dish was about 18 dollars, the noodles were over cooked, the whole thing took an hour to arrive at our table (for pasta?) and it seemed wildly over priced, in addition to being slimy and gross.

As the morning wears on toward lunch, they bring out pizzas and some other things as well, but I'm usually in around breakfast time. Daytime also features a great dessert case, with a good range of cookies, crostata (TINY PIES), and other items like muffins and bagels and lord knows what else. I have yet to be disappoined with anything, though the chocolate chip cookies aren't really my 'style.' Still good, but a little weird. I'm obsessed with their crostata, though. Teeny-tiny single serving fruit pies, man! Fuck! They also make a pretty solid hot chocolate. Nice selection of hot beverages, as well as cold drinks in the little cooler thing by the register, and another cooler full of Naked juice ... it's just a nice, cozy selection all around.

2012-08-16,3.0,"The food at Letizia's is really good, but recently they've devoted more and more restaurant energy to their dinners (which are $$$.  Unaffordable if you have a small income or are in school). I have been frequenting this place since it opened but have found myself cutting back for numerous reasons.  They no longer use the brick oven for the cafe (only for dinner), so their sandwiches are pre-made and grilled on a panini grill now.  This means that sometimes the food is semi-cold and sometimes you can't even get food, because they've run out.  Also, there's not as much selection since it's not baked fresh.  And they took away the best item on the menu- the garlic bomb!!   Another thing that I find somewhat frustrating is the inconsistent service.  At times I get exactly what I ordered, but more than a few times something is missing.  But again, since the oven is not in use, there is less chance of that happening. Don't get me wrong, the food here is very good and the coffee, too!  I'm giving it 3 stars, because I dislike the recent changes they've made.  What made Letizia's special before was the fresh-made food and the brick oven, and now that they have done away with both those things, it feels like just another generic cafe.",0.9439,0.777,0.139,0.083,0.43556935817805376

2012-08-09,5.0,"I live at the corner of Logan and California and can see the Starbucks from every window in my apartment. And yet I take the brief sojourn to Letizia's for coffee most mornings. Why, you ask? Because, as Kati M. said, it's just a billion times better than Starbucks (not to mention a local business). They serve Caffe Umbria, which is a delicious dark Italian roast and is actually coffee, as opposed to Starbuck's crap. I regularly get skim lattes and skim chais there and they're both fantastic. There's usually only one barista on weekday mornings but they're always nice and quick. And the food! Their donuts are incredible. They just started serving bagels which they get delivered daily. The only time I've tried a bagel it was pretty stale, but I'll give them another try. I also ate here for dinner once and it was super delicious, though pretty pricey for a neighborhood joint. The pasta is homemade and fantastic. Everything is simple with fresh ingredients.

2012-08-07,5.0,"Real talk time: if I ever have to move anywhere in this city that's more than a short walking distance away from Letizia's, I will probably cry. And for good reason.  The bakery and cafe would be enough on its own - their iced chai lattes on a balmy day are better relief than anything the 'Bucks down the street has to offer, and anything made with coffee or espresso - even the red eye, the eloquently-named half espresso/half drip offering - is smooth as can be. The ambience day or night is wonderful, the wine and coffee selections fantastic, and the service is great, with friendly baristas that are fast as can be without messing up your order during the day, and equally speedy, knowledgeable, attentive (and, let's be real here, frighteningly pretty) wait staff in the evening. Here's the kicker: they're gluten-free friendly. At an Italian restaurant and bakery!  I know! Most restaurants, I've become used to picking from whatever limited selection of naturally gluten-free dishes are offered and keeping my fingers crossed that they don't end up tasting like cardboard or containing hidden gluten in seasonings or fillers,  and while Letizia's is no different, the experience is above-par.  Maybe it's because they seem to exercise the philosophy of simple, high-quality ingredients prepared well, but even a naturally gf dish like risotto or a chicken entree with vegetable side is a pleasure.  Even better, as of this month they have both rice flour and corn flour penne pasta that you can substitute into any pasta dish on the menu, rendering the better majority of the dinner menu's entrees celiac-friendly. And if you're worried about  safety, it's all good there too - I'm not sure how, by some miraculous divine presence gracing the place or maybe just good hygienic practices, I've never been cross-contaminated here.  Not once, not from coffee, not from dinner, not even a twinge, and this is from someone who's been put in the hospital by products tested down to 5ppm.

2012-01-17,5.0,"Tremendous. That alone justifies the five-star review from these hands. Letizia's, to me, was always another neighborhood café. But recently they decided to turn the café to an upscale Italian eatery during the evening hours, boasting of their 40 bottles for less than $40. (Don't worry: most of them are between $30 and $35.) I made a last-minute reservation for a Friday night on OpenTable for about 6:30p and came into an empty restaurant. We thought we had made a mistake but it quickly filled up. The ambiance is quiet, easy to have a date night in but also one can imagine having a small group of friends for a going-away party or something low-key. The crowd varied for sure. Now, on to the food. The menu was, well, pricey. And that's okay because the experience of eating was well worth the cost. We started with insalata finocchio, which they nicely split for the two of us. The oranges were the highlight of course one, dominating the calming flavors of the fennel and the strangely-tasteless olive. Next was the garlic bread. This is when I realized I needed to suspend the idea of Olive Garden-style Italian food. Here was a thin slice of bread gently garnished with delicious olive oil and garlic. It wasn't overwhelming, but just right. Then came the mains. Homemade. Scratch made. Totally-made-for-me pasta. The black grouper was just heaven. The noodles were imperfect but had a great taste on their own. The mini tomatoes burst in your mouth and touched every one of of my taste buds individually shaking them from their dormant state. I love fish and this was prepared by someone who gets that and isn't scared to make a fish dish fishy. My partner's eggplant ravioli (and she does not like eggplant) was done to perfection. For once the eggplant wasn't mushy. It nearly had the texture of a fine ricotta. It was pressed into a hand-made ravioli and brushed with a scrumptious tomato cream sauce. (I am using a lot of adjectives I don't normally use. I apologize.) Now, we're full at this point. But we cannot stop ourselves from at least looking at the menu. And we're not committed by any means. We can stop. We ... will ... try at least. But we lose to a pumpin cheesecake and a chocolate cloud. Let's start with the cloud. Imagine a round ball of chocolate, about the size of a softball, maybe a little larger. Then imagine it filled with a mousse-like substance. Then imagine putting big pieces of cake inside this mass. It doesn't seem possible, but it is incredible. And I've saved the best for last. I love pumpkin and cheesecake. The best cheesecake I've ever had was at a place that no longer exists. But this one is out of this world. The owner herself made this recipe and it is by far the most amazing cheesecake. It's like the entire month of November was dumped into this one slice. There are notes of nutmeg, vanilla, rich pumpkin and the sweetness (not over sweet) of the cream cheese and a bit of sugar. Then topped off with a semi-sweet caramel. It's just incredible and just works so well. With two apps, two entrees, a bottle of wine and two desserts the total comes to $101. That's a great date night, but definitely one of those places you cannot go EVERY night.

I got it one early morning on my way downtown, and was disappointed that is was just cheese on flatbread. It needed... something, like pesto or some kind of spread. It was just not worth the money. -- The service is really patchy. It seems to depend a lot on who's in that day.

The donut was one of the best I have ever had, the cookies were good, but unfortunately didn't knock my socks off as I had been hoping.  What is great is absolutely everything is made from scratch, in-house.

Natural (almost loose leaf type) bagged teas.  Great coffee drink selection, soups, sandwiches, and good donuts.  The donut was ""melt-in-your-mouth,"" covered with a raspberry glaze.",0.9791,0.646,0.318,0.035,0.6835664335664337

2011-01-03,3.0,"I'm going to agree with Colin on this one. I was really excited for them to open, but I'd most definitely rather go to New Wave for coffee.  The coffee here just isn't very good. The garlic thingy and the pizza was very good, and it is really beautiful inside.  I am anticipating liking this place more once they've worked out there kinks... for instance, I've had mixed experiences with the staff; some have been really nice and helpful, while another was complaining about her co-workers and talking about how bad New Wave was while we ate. I will recommend their pastries.",0.9392,0.673,0.22,0.107,0.6258275058275059
2011-01-01,5.0,"I come here most mornings for coffee.  I either get their sugar doughnuts (which are, by the way, the best doughnuts i've ever had.  this includes the cider mill doughnuts i've had growing up) or their roasted tomato piadina.   At first I wanted them to have more food items on the menu.  That was until I realized that if they had more food, I'd probably stick with their piadinas and their doughnuts anyway.   So while more food on the menu would be fine, it's really not necessary for me.  they have really delicious basics that keep me satisfied.  The staff is always really nice.  Once they thought they forgot to give me my sandwich and made me another one.  When they realized that they didn't forget anything, they gave it to me for free anywyay!   Their coffee is probably the best in logan square and I love the natural light in the front of the building.  I look forward to going again!",0.9862,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.6208333333333332
2010-12-31,4.0,"was so glad to see this place FINALLY open. was supposed to open in june, but they hit a few bumps and it didn't open until a couple months ago. i believe it was supposed to be the same model as the one on division (sharing with enoteca) but it's just them at this one now. the interior is really cute. it's definitely a  lounge coffee shop rather than a grab and go, or rather that was my experience when i tried to go there in the morning before work. they have plenty of outlets by the booths and window seating up front. so if you need a new spot for mobile working this might be for you. the dining area in the back is huge, but i can't see it ever being crowded.  their coffee is good. their baked goods are as delicious as the other location--you won't be disappointed there. the apple muffin gets a thumbs up--tried my friends. their donuts look sublime, but haven't tried yet. this location has a pizza oven. they have a breakfast pizza that sounded good and you can get other things on it. the best thing on their menu in theory is their garlic pizza--states that it comes with a breath mint.",0.9915,0.826,0.174,0.0,0.5321969696969697

Maybe a bit less variety on the menu than the place on Division, but not bad. The breakfast sandwich with egg and proscuitto on flatbread was quite tasty, and the chai was nice, if unremarkable. Ooh, and free wifi. Has the Division spot started offering it free?  Anyway, this is on my way to some northside places I frequent. I'll be back.",0.9683,0.764,0.22,0.016,0.5933333333333333
2010-12-08,2.0,"I eagerly awaited the opening of this location since I loved going to their other location on Division when I lived in Bucktown.  I don't live far from the California location now, and was thrilled when I saw the signs about this place coming soon.  I waited a few weeks for them to work out the kinds and stopped in to get a piece of pizza while I was out running errands one Sat.  All I ordered was a slice of the pizza.  It took a very long time to heat it up.  And I think they misplaced my order of one slice of pizza because after a while they asked me what I ordered.  So after the long wait I went to the back seating area to try out the pizza.  The decor of the place is great -- warm and inviting.  What was not inviting were all of the unbussed tables I found in the back room.  I tried the pizza, and it was pretty good flavor-wise.  But it was not all that warm considering the length of time I waited for it.  Also, it didn't seem worth the money I shelled out for it.  Plus in the time it took me to consume the pizza, no one ever came to bus the tables that I found unbussed when I arrived.  Unbussed tables are just not inviting.  And if you want people to bus their own, give them a place to put their dirty dishes.  Sadly, I was very disappointed by my outing after all my initial excitement.  Will I try it again?   Probably.  Am I rushing to go back?  No.  Hopefully they will work out some of their kinks in the months to come, because this place has the potential to be a good addition to the Logan Square area.",0.9705,0.811,0.131,0.058,0.5448
2010-12-05,3.0,"I live around the corner from this place, and had been waiting for a while for it to open - ever since they gut rehabbed the sketchy looking building it used to be and turned it into some wanna-be Los Angeles modern building.  I should be stoked for yet another bakery  / coffee shop / place to do crosswords in the hood, and the closer the better, right?  My hope was that it would turn into my go-to place for morning coffee before work - I love New Wave, but it's a 5 minute walk out of the way. Well, I've been a handful of times and its hit or miss to be honest.  And i've been back to New Wave at least twice as many times since, if that's any indication.  The pastries and donuts are delightful, yet the coffee awful.  One time I got a regular coffee, and it had grinds floating around in it... it was worse than gas-station variety.  The other times I got a latte, which is fine, but not really what I want to drink all the time - I'm just too scared to get the coffee.  I do appreciate that they have sandwiches and pizza - New Wave's lunch / food selection is lacking. The staff is friendly but seem scatterbrained. More than once I've been skipped over or they've mixed up orders, or made someone else's drink before mine even though I ordered first.  Not a huge deal, but if you're in a hurry, it'd be annoying.  Finally, I found that the layout is confusing. Checkout is right next to the door, where I'm standing in the way when (inevitably) waiting for my drink.  People coming in and out of the restaurant don't know where to order, and it's just...a bit awkward. So I'm not going to ban this place, as I presume some of these issues are simply growing pains - and I will check out the food sometime, and am intrigued by the restaurant's potential - but it has not toppled New Wave as the king of coffee in Logan Square.",0.8932,0.823,0.103,0.074,0.5423431330574188

2010-11-09,4.0,"Finally! I've been waiting for this place to open, like many others. I was finally going to make it here today. I took my 1 year old daughter and my friend along for lunch. Let me start by saying I love the building. It is really beautiful. Inside is very warm and cozy. One con is it doesn't have much space for a full size stroller, much less for several. When we went to sit in back there were several mothers with their children as well as strollers. I guess they didn't expect so many moms to make it a meeting place.  The food was delicious! My friend and I had the tomato and pesto pizza along with a slice of tiramisu and a smoked turkey piadina. The pizza was very good, even my daughter gobbled up the pieces I gave her.  It took a pretty long time for us to get our piadina. The staff seemed a little flustered and disorganized. They were arguing about who would man the oven and coffee maker. I guess once they establish a better system, the food would be ready faster. Not too many complaints. I will definitely be back for more pizza.

2010-11-08,5.0,"I have been impatiently waiting on this place to open, so when I had time to stop in on Sunday I went for it. I've been watching the progress of this building since they started construction and it seems that Letizia's is a great fit for the building. I had a sugar doughnut and a medium coffee. My compadre ordered a slice of pizza, and an arancine. We were both pleasantly surprised by how good everything was. The arancine was definitely the highlight, but everything else was delicious too. Letizia came to check on us about halfway into our meal and we chatted with her for a while. She is trying her best to get a hold of natural and organic ingredients and keep things simple recipe wise. She told me that the sugar covered doughnut is vegan (wheat flour, soy flour, olive oil, and yeast) though the glazed doughnut is not because they use a bit of butter in the glaze.  They have a wood fired stove, enough variety in the food and plenty of vegetarian options. I'll definitely be returning.",0.9791,0.773,0.186,0.042,0.6076530612244897
2010-11-07,4.0,"This is a very good and much anticipated addition to the neighborhood.  The food is all high quality and well prepared.  I had the arancino, which is a ball of risotto with a filling, and the whole thing fried.  Delicious.  They also make Piadina, which is a flat bread ""sandwich"" very specific to Emilia Romagna region of Italy.  I will try one next time for sure.  The pizza also looks very good.  The pizzas and piadina are prepared in the wood burning oven. I will say that some in Logan might be put off by the prices.  I had an Arancino, a cappucino and a small bottle of sparkling water and it totaled about $12.  But, that's only about 8.5 Euros and I saved on the plane ticket to Bologna.  If you think of it that way, and are interested in something good and authentic, then you will be happy!",0.9837,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.5703993055555556

Pastries might be natural but are anything but healthy.  Muffins are out of this world..SOO moist and delicious.  The glazed doughnuts and apple tart looked exceptionally naughty. Next time, will try the lunch menu.  Seemingly limited but how much do you really need to chose from when it comes to lunch. The service:  very lacking.  Zero focus from the register lady; failure to listen in a big way.  Coffee lady was on it but seemed nervous and exasperated.  There were only 3 people in line so probably a good idea for them to get their act together soon. Parking = street only. Am able to walk there so that's always a plus for me. For now, they close at 6 the lady said.  Still way too soon in the game for me to take them seriously and have some kinks to work out; as with any new place.  They opened for biz on Halloween...so I'd give it another 3 weeks before I expect smooth sailing.
