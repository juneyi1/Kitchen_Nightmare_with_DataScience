2015-09-12,2.0,"This review is based solely on my dining experience here. The inside of Mystic Celt is very nice in terms of the restaurant layout, TV selection, and style. I guess I would consider Mystic Celt a 'classier' type of sports restaurant and bar (compared to BW3's and the likewise). In addition, their menu features more unique food options (specifically, Irish inspired) than typical sports bar.  The group I came with decided to split the homemade mac and cheese cake as an app. Like all the food I tried here, it was just okay, nothing extraordinary. The size of one mac and cheese cake was equivalent to the size of a 'man that lifts' closed fist. I think a mac and cheese cake is pretty much mac & cheese rolled into a patty, soaked in eggs, sprinkled with flour, then deep fried. It was pretty heavy and a bit greasier than I would have liked, but the mac & cheese itself was pretty good. In addition to the mac and cheese cake, I tried the Juicy Maclucy burger. This is an angus patty stuffed with mac and cheese and topped with a few onion rings. (It was just one of those mac n cheese days, you know?) I knew after eating the mac and cheese cake, there was no way I would be able to finish my meal. It was just too much heavy food. The burger was just okay. I asked for it medium-well and would have liked for the outside of the burger to have been a little crispier. The mac and cheese left no impact on the taste of the burger, I kind of forgot it was on the burger. If I were to come back, I wouldn't be ""dying"" to have a burger from here. I realize the mac and cheese cake with the Juicy Maclucy burger was a poorly planned execution of meal planning on my part, but regardless, nothing in my meal really impressed me.  Based on just the food, I would have given Mystic Celtic three stars. It was just average.  I gave this review two stars because the customer service was lacking. Our waitress stopped by our table just a couple of times and neglected to fill our drinks. We had to ask her for refills and I left the restaurant thirsting for water. I would probably give Mystic Celt another opportunity but it would have to be on an occasion when I am wanting to go somewhere to eat lightly and focus majorly on drinking and watching a sporting event. I feel as though the surrounding restaurants around Mystic Celt are more appealing, but I would not reject the offer of going to Mystic Celt for a few drinks.",0.9651,0.893,0.079,0.028,0.525

2015-06-01,5.0,"This review is a bit goofy, because it deals with a meal that we had at the Mystic Celt more than 12 years ago.  But I remembered it this morning and thought it was worth writing up. In November 2002, my wife and I were sworn in as lawyers.  Her mother and 88-year-old grandma came to the ceremony, and took us out for a celebratory lunch afterwards.  The Mystic Celt was new-ish at the time, and my wife's grandma was southside Irish (she was a little old lady who grew up over the tavern that her family ran before settling in Beverly and raising a gaggle of kids.  You'd never expect it but she could keep up when cocktails were being served.)   So that was the place we picked.   It was a weekday lunch, so the place was quiet.  My grandma-in-law explained to the waiter why we were there - clearly proud of her newly-minted lawyer granddaughter - and told him to bring over a bottle of champagne to toast the occasion.  But the waiter apologized that the bar didn't sell any sparkling wine (they do now, I see).  She was disappointed but we went on. To our great surprise, about 15 minutes later the waiter came over to the table with a bottle of champagne.  When we asked what had changed in that time, he said that the manager felt bad that we couldn't properly celebrate, and sent him up the street to Osco to take care of the request.  The manager apparently paid for it out of his pocket and insisted that it was on the house.  We drank out of wine glasses, and though it was probably cheap drug store stuff it tasted pretty great under the circumstances. My grandma-in-law died less than a year later.  She was the best.  I am glad to have that memory of her.  Thanks, Mystic Celt manager from 12 years ago. (P.S.

The drink list was pretty good and they had a few rotating on tap. I had plenty to choose from though I stayed safe with a Matilda.  Good spot, not too overpriced.

The drink service was prompt, but the food came out really slowly (we thought they forgot about us for a while there). When the food did come out, it was hot and I really enjoyed my wings. They had some nice heat and were a good size.  The inside was really nice and the there were TVs for those who wanted them by the bar and then the rest felt more like a restaurant. We only went to share a few drinks, but sitting at a table it definitely felt like our time was limited. Service was pretty slow, too, so that was too bad.

I was allowed to bring in my own cake as well, and the staff at Mystic Celt helped set it up and provided plates, forks, and cutting services for it free of charge. I was able to bring my own iPod and plug it into their sound system, and the party felt very private even though there was a dance party in the next room. I originally booked the room for three hours, but as our end time came around, it was clear that a lot of people weren't quite ready to leave, so the amazing Caroline offered to keep the bar open for us a little longer.

The host looked as though she wanted to kill herself because she was at work, was rude, slammed our menus down and walked away without even a smile. Our server was an idiot. After our food was delivered she didn't come to check and make sure everything was okay for 9 minutes (yeah, I timed it). I figured ""oh maybe she's busy"". NOPE! I look over and see her and about 3 other servers just texting away by their POS. I was instantly pissed and after I boxed my food up and asked for the check we sat there for another 10 minutes for her to come take the check presenter from us because I hate leaving cash on the table.

What was most frustrating about the place is the fact that they admittedly have confusing signage for specials. The prices for the wings and burgers don't match up on the banner outside of the door with the menu descriptions. It seems like a no-brainer to change one or the other if it's clearly confusing customers and servers. The wings were nothing to write home about as they were a mix of varying chicken parts with more sauce than meat, and the spinach-artichoke dip had a thin consistency making it seem as if it originated from one of those pouched seasoning mixes. But, I did appreciate the crunch on the wings from the frying and the duo of chip and pita bread on the side of the dip. A plus is that drink menus provided more options than the typical domestic beers and standard cocktails. My friend and I ordered the Summer Brew - beer, lemonade and vodka so it tasted like a pumped-up summer shandy.

This last time, we figured we'd give it a shot, because it seemed family friendly and we were in the mood for a good burger and thought a pub would be the place to go. Wrong. The burger was the least delicious bar burger I've ever had and the ""bacon"" was not bacon. I can't remember what they called it, but it was a crazy thick and I could not even take a bite out of it. It was like jerky, and they put it on my burger in lieu of bacon because, wait for it..... they ran out of bacon!!! They comped the burger, but the disappointment of craving a juicy bacon cheeseburger and getting that still lingers. The fries were ok though, the saving grace of the dish, really, but they were nothing special. The employees were friendly, but not very prompt.

On the day of our event, the back room (which accommodates up 90 people) was perfectly set up.  We had one bartender for our group, but they made it clear that they'd add an extra bartender if needed.  The light appetizers were great and more than I expected - bruschettta, a veggie plate, and guacamole.  When our group expressed that they were still hungry, Justin, the manager, brought out pizzas.  He was in and out of the room regularly to make sure the event was running smoothly and everyone was happy. Mystic Celt is a great neighborhood Irish pub - not just for dinner, snacks and drinks but also to host events.",0.9874,0.833,0.16,0.007,0.42286089978397673

On the negative side, I've had bad service several times, and it was always when it wasn't even busy. Our waitress would eventually forget about us, or no one would ever come over to begin with and we'd have to go find someone at the bar to send someone.

2011-09-12,2.0,"UPDATE:  I got a nice message from the server who I referred to talking about the situation and she apologized for Sunday's service and put things in context.  I thought that was nice and everyone has an off night.  While my review still stands, I think the fact that she took the time out of her day to reach out means more than a few late drinks.   So I'll be returning to Mystic Celt and hopefully have her again, because the waitress who emailed me is the one who I believe is the server on most nights that I'd get, not yesterday's.   Well, that could have went better. It had been a long weekend for my girlfriend and I, with us flying back from a family matter in Boston earlier in the day.   We knew that Mystic Celt had beer and food specials and could be a great place to watch the Jets / Cowboys game with friends and cheer us up. We invited 8 other friends to join us.  We sat by the bar to watch the game, but were utterly disappointed with the service.  Having worked as a server, I understand how crappy it might be to work a Sunday night but what we went through was inexcusable.  Our server, a blonde woman with a short bob haircut who signs all her checks with a peace sign, gave us some of the most lackluster service I've ever had in a restaurant.   A few things: - She was extremely inattentive to our entire table's needs.  She'd take a beer order from two people then walk away from the table of ten. - The special was Miller Lite pint cans.  We were given bottles (charged correctly) but still, she could have upsold us!  We asked for them! - Large spans of time existed where she simply wasn't around to take any orders.  When she did appear, she did what was listed above. - When we got fed up and left at half time, she cashed out a majority of the table on one check.  Which is fine but she left zero cash for us to divy up.  She simply took what was left over as her tip.  She mumbled something about if we needed cash and walked away.  We were so fed up that it wasn't worth fighting about so we left and went to Lange's instead.   Also, I'm not sure why y'all publish football specials when the bar itself has an ambiance that implies dance club.  While we were watching the game (with no sound), loud dance music was blasted while the lights were turned down very low.  I'd like to point out that we were basically the only people in the bar at this point.   I hate writing these types of reviews because I've been on the service side and know it isn't easy.  I was just very disappointed because we WANTED to be there, to spend our money, to buy celebratory shots, to eat more food, etc!   I will say that my curry wings were great.  I've always enjoyed the food here.  It might not blow me away but if you want stuff to go with a nice cold beer (if it gets to you, that is) then it isn't bad.   Better luck next time?  I'll give them another shot but not for groups of football fans.  GO TO LANGE'S!",0.909,0.834,0.098,0.067,0.48629679544773885

There are many great appetizers, including the nachos, spinach and artichoke dip (which is mild and nutmegy, not overly garlicky), and the combination platter (my favorite). The burgers are very good, but order them rarer than you usually do because they overcook them a bit.  It also seems that whenever I ask for something other than fries (like tater tots or waffle fries), either my server or the kitchen ignores it. It's happened often enough that I think it's the kitchen. There's one thing I dislike in particular: the noise level. The front room has a tendency to be very loud anyway, but then they crank the music up around dinnertime and it's incredibly hard to converse at all. That's fine for a bar with a dance floor, but not when you're sitting in a booth trying to share a meal.

The waitress brought 2 pitchers of water because she ""couldn't keep up.""  That is very acceptable for a big group.  The problem was that she never refilled the pitchers.  This was because she spent most of her time at our table flirting with 3 of the guys at our table.  I don't care that I was part of the other 12 accept for the fact that the rest of us received terrible service. We received our food and it was the usual mediocre food (no qualms there).  She brought us the bill all on one tab with gratuity included already.  (Not very happy about this since she sucked, but that's common with big groups.) The waitress refused to split the bill and told us we had to do it ourselves.  We complained to the manager and were told the same thing.  We had to divide out gratuity, tax, and our food orders and it took us about an hour.

2011-02-20,5.0,"I have been going to Mystic Celt for almost two years now and have yet to review it. When I lived in Wrigleyville Mystic Celt was a great go to during the week for lunch or dinner because of the great specials. We initially went in for the 1/2 price appetizers on Mondays and it definitely kept us coming back. The first time we went we signed up for the e-mail list which kept us in the know about all of the great specials and I even got a $20 gift card on my birthday!  My friends and I decided to go out for restaurant week about a month ago and made reservations. We planned a girls night out and decided a wrist band special might be a good idea to save us some money after an expensive dinner. I recalled an e-mail I received from Mystic Celt about six months ago advertising a $20 all you can drink any Friday or Saturday for three hours. As wristbands go in the city that's an awesome deal as far as we were concerned. We then decided to make a party of it and invite all of our friends. The $20 wristband did not disappoint. In addition to the special we were given a large private room with plenty of tables in the back of the bar and a private bartender. The music was great and it was definitely awesome to have our own bartender. She did not skimp on the mixed drinks and they were far stronger than ones you would get during your average wristband deal. I do have one complaint though. The bouncer who was managing our private room was a complete jerk. He would not let in people who did not want to purchase the wristband. This was annoying because there was plenty of room for other folks to come in and they did not tell me that we had a private room or that people who did not want to purchase the wristband did not have to come in. He was not very nice about it and when we were bouncing in and out of the room to check in with friends without the wristband he ripped a drink out of one of my friends hands because he thought one of us had given it to her. I think this is an isolated incident and will be taking it up with the person who helped us set up our party. All in all I would highly recommend a private party or simply dinner and drinks at Mystic Celt, I know I'll be back.",0.9959,0.811,0.158,0.031,0.5226804567981038

This place consistently sucks.  The food is awful, the service is even worse, and I'm pretty sure the drinks are over-priced (I can't quite remember because the last few times I've been there it's been for a wrist band party).   Speaking of wrist band parties, I went to one here about a year ago for a friend's engagement.  I was really sick but wanted to attend the party, so I figured I'd stop by and not drink.  This was not acceptable to the guy at the door.  He kept insisting that I had to pay $30 to merely enter the room and not drink.  He thought I was trying to pull a fast one and get a friend to order drinks for me off of their wrist band.  He actually called a manager over to check if it was ok that I went in without drinking/paying.   After much discussion, they finally let me in (I think I may have had to pay like $10, mind you I was already in the bar, this was just to get into the party room).  Then, the manager proceeded to take the bartender aside to point me out as a non-drinker. Seriously.  (Wouldn't the absence of a wrist band been an indicator to the bartender?)  When I was trying to order a water at the bar, I was ignored, so I had a friend get one for me.  And then the same manager came over, saw a cup in my hand, and asked what it was.  Seriously?  PS.  Isn't the point of the wrist band party to only serve those wearing wrist bands?  Did I really need to be pointed out and then repeatedly checked on like a child?? The next wristband party I went to, a couple months ago, the bartenders kept insisting that certain drinks were not part of the package (that clearly were).  An argument ensued, and the bartender was corrected by another bartender.  Hello idiot, without our party the bar would have been empty, and you're haggling us?  Guess who doesn't want to get tipped tonight! Anyway, this place is to be avoided at all costs.  I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 because the place is never full so it's pretty easy to get a seat.  That's the only thing going for them.",0.9881,0.761,0.154,0.085,0.5784102182539681

I was wrong, it's a faux-Irish bar that has a loud dj playing a lot of rap and hip-hop while a bunch of the Wrigleyville spillover comes to grind on each other. $6 for a pint of Guinness, which is just ridiculous, why is this bar more expensive than any other bar-a dollar doesn't seem to much but when you're buying a round it can add up.  I had to go to the bathroom and uh yikes is all I have to say.

The server was super attentive considering there was about 15 of us.  Overall, I was pretty impressed.  In the summer, they have outdoor sweeting which is pretty sweet.",0.9903,0.648,0.352,0.0,0.6133053221288516

My friend and I went to Mystic Celt for an after dinner drink on a Saturday.  We were hoping this bar would be less insane as some of the bars are in the area.  Everyone watches college games all day, by the time evening rolls around they are well on their way if not way past gone.  We went to the bar and I was looking at the variety of beers.  My friend went first and ordered hers then I was left standing there.  After about 6 or so people had gone ahead of me, I tried to get the bartenders attention.  He came over to the bar but then ignored me and started taking the order of the couple next to me. AND he put up his finger at me, telling me he was too busy to listen to me.  By this time, my friend was at least a third way done with her beer.   I walked away from the bar, too furious to have a beer at this point anyway.  The music was decent, at least some variety from hip hop that blares at every other bar.  The crowd was a bit more subdued than where we stopped at first, the crowd slightly older and more mature even though most had been drinking since Noon also.

We didn't ask for 6 separate checks, but it turned out to be too complicated and we had to have one big check.  After this first round we decided to go to the bar to get our drinks because it was easier to everyone to pay for their own drinks and it was also faster.  Throughout the night some food was ordered and I was able to sample the fried pickles, which I have never had before and they were delicious. I also had the boneless chicken wings which were also very good and of course the fries were nice and crispy.

We had a private area in the back, and the World Cup championship game was on, so that was nice. The back area is pretty cool, but the TV by the comfy chairs was broken, so that was kind of lame. All in all, I'd probably go back for some pub-grub if I was in the Southport area and wanted to watch a game. I also think it's really cool that they will do fundraising things there.

If you sign up for their email club they often send you half off of their already great deals. The food is always good-- I've had the burgers, mac and cheese, fish and chips, pizzas (the goat cheese one is delicious), and bangers and mash. The drinks are good and they have decent deals on drinks everyday.  One thing that is not so great about Mystic Celt is the service. Although there are a couple of good servers, I have found that some are rude and much of the time the service is very slow. Last night, my boyfriend and I sat at a bar table for 10 minutes with no service. Eventually I went up to the bartender and she sent someone over to us and apologized.

2010-01-25,3.0,"The Mystic Celt is pretty consistently mediocre. I've never had anything I hated, or anything I really loved.  However, I am a member of their e-mail club and get great coupons I.E. appetizers for a quarter of the  price, which keeps me going back pretty regularly (I'm a sucker for a good deal).         This isn't going to be gourmet dining experience, but if you're looking for some decent specials on a week night,  a decent burger, mac & cheese, or other standard pub fare the Mystic Celt will probably do the trick. They even sent me a gift card for my Birthday which was a nice touch.          My major gripe is the service (especially during the brunch hours), the waitresses aren't always attentive (or pleasant) and they seem to be a little understaffed at times.  The waitresses often disappear for extended periods of time(it seems). I don't reccomend Mystic Celt if your in a hurry or like being visted by your surver every 10 minitues.  Up until recently, it seemed like there were different servers every time we went and most seemed like they just started working there.        There is plenty of seating aviable, although they are usally pretty crowded. The décor is pretty standard for an Irish Pub. In fact, Standard sums up the entire Mystic Celt experience pretty well.  It's kind of like a line from that old Gin Blossoms song ""If you don't expect too much from me, you might not be let down.""

(FYI, a martin should be pow at first sip). The waitress apparently made it herself (see below), poured it tableside and carried the lime wedge in her hand. She un-palmed it to hook onto my glass. One dinner companion didn't get a full glass worth, the other had weak beer. You can tell when the beer is watered down, especially when you drink it regularly. The fuming flame was lit. This should be illegal. Now, for a Thursday night it was busy. Two words: one bartender. Really? This is why our waitress made the drinks herself. I asked for a shot of tequila to rouse my margatini and that helped, but I was already miffed. First impressions... Why were people (and families with kids) there afterall? Is this the best Southport has to offer? We came for dinner, which wasn't terrible. The side salad was fresh and good. Ice cream dessert was a nice touch. Not being charged for the tequila shot was smart, or I would have gone off. Diluting the drinks really sucks, so i'm done with this place. Too bad. Better drinks would have cause the 3 of us to order at least 2 more rounds but we hightailed it outta there at last bite. Maybe it was also because the sound on the sports TV (no game was actually being played) was cranked so loud that our table conversation was drowned.

She stopped walking and turned to me seemingly annoyed and told me it was about a 30-45 minute wait. So I told her I'd sit inside but I'd like to sit as close to the windows as possible. She grabbed two other menus and pointed to a table as she did so and said, ""That's as close as I can get you."" So that's where I sat. My friend showed up about 10 minutes later and the hostess came over and took our 3rd menu. My friend stopped her and told her we needed it because we had a third person coming.

So then we find out that due to the mixup in scheduling, there might be a problem getting the room.  Enter the manager, who seemed kind of sore about the whole thing, but of course I cant argue with him because I am too busy being mesmerized by his accent...dammit! I'm not exactly sure what transpired, but in the end we were allowed to stay - thank god! I had the burger special which was great as a $5 burger.  Had it been more than that it wouldnt have been so great.  Some folks got other kinds of cheese that they didnt like, but I got blue and I think that helped greatly.   Then this board game group kind of muscled (do board game group members ""muscle""?)  their way into our room because they ""needed the better lighting"".  Um...Okay...sure!  Want a Yelp sticker?

I give Mystic Celt four stars for their specials and the stellar service we received, but I think on any other night I would have given it two or three stars.  I don't see myself going out of my way to come here.",0.9964,0.817,0.166,0.017,0.5702533068783069

However, my cobb salad was terrible.  I think that this cobb salad is going to be the straw that breaks my back in terms of ordering 'our take on the cobb salad.'  Spinach greens don't really belong with a cobb.  Nor does turkey in lieu of chicken.  Apples don't make sense.  And a small army of green olives are a terrible edition.   Oh yeah, cobbs are better with feta.  Cheddar on a salad?  Why?  Just why? My girlfriend got the vegetarian chili.  I don't know the usual protocol on vegetarian chili, but it felt more like a soup with kidney beans in it than it felt like chili.  It wasn't bad, per se, but it wasn't chili either.  Rather disappointing.

Most of the positive reviews on here center around their food. If the food isn't bad, I could see Mystic Celt being a nice restaurant setting. However, I don't like this place as a bar. There's no je ne sais quoi bar atmosphere that makes it different from a bunch of people drinking at an apartment.  I had an enjoyable post date drink here a few months ago, but in thinking about that, the bar had nothing to do with my enjoyment. Every other night here has bored me to tears. I blame the design of the bar. A large portion of the bar is full of low tables and therefore doesn't provide an area for people to stand. If no seating is available, you have to pack like sardines up front. This makes it really difficult to meet anyone outside of your party. I love my friends, but as a textbook social butterfly, I like to meet new people as often as I can.   The bathroom setup is a bit bizarre.

2006-11-17,4.0,"I miss you Mystic Celt.  I used to live near you and we would stop by on Monday's when you had the excellent special ($4 burgers and $3 microbrew pints).  It's been a while since we've moved but I think about you often.  Do you remember me? Your food was always good, pints were always cold and service was mostly decent.  I especially liked you when it was nice out and we were lucky enough to score a prime table outside.  But your inside is just fine with your cozy booths and long bar.  One thing I never understood about you, why would an Irish Pub bring in a DJ on Fri and Sat nights?  You don't need that!  That's why I avoided you on the weekends.  I'll stop by and see you soon, I promise.",0.9558,0.769,0.171,0.059,0.6107142857142858
2006-10-26,3.0,"I went there last night on a blind date. The food was great. There are always specials, as I have read on the website, and also from other people's reviews.  I would have given them a better star rating, but our server was terrible. She didn't introduce herself, gave me a dirty look when I asked her what kind of beers she had on tap, and then proceeded to just say ""are you ready yet?""  When we said no, stead of saying, ""Would you like anything to drink to start?"" She just walked away. I definately didn't feel welcome. It looked like every other table had a better server. The buss boys gave us more service than she did. She didn't check up on us at all. And when we finished our beers, she took away the glasses, instead of saying, ""May I get you another?"" Doesn't a higher bill, good service mean higher tip? I am totally confused on her way of service. I wish I could have smacked her in the head. But I didn't. I have named her Rude Ruth. Yes, I renamed her. Just beware of Ruth. Although the roasted veggie wrap was GREAT. And plus it was only $5.00. I love drink specials. So go there for a fast, chill, drink special night.

2006-07-07,3.0,"So it's not exactly like a pub you'd find in Ireland.  Not even close.  Well, maybe in Dublin in Trinity Bar where all the tourists go, but let's just say it's not traditional.  In that, it's not dirty & dark & full of Guinness farts. Well, maybe Guinness farts, but we won't know for sure until the smoking ban goes into effect. I digress. I've been here for lunch, for dinner, for after a Cubs game, & for a private party in one of the back rooms.  Each time a good time.  Once, the group of guys I was with was a little over-zealous (now THAT's an Irish pub!) & we were kicked out (now that's NOT an irish pub!), but they were awfully cordial about it & yeah, I'd've kicked the idiots out, too ... they were pretty much major wankers. & they pour a decent Guinness, so fart away!",0.9298,0.801,0.143,0.056,0.5266975308641976

2006-05-28,3.0,"Though the theme screams Irish, it's just another typical joint, but one worth checking out.  Great music each night (though they could turn it down a bit), decent food (been there for lunch, brunch, and dinner, and liked it each time), and a great place to meet friends for drinks.  Can't ask for much more. Try snagging a spot on the street front patio in good weather: excellent people watching opportunities abound.  The inside offers a good number of booths, but unless you get there early, good luck getting one.  The place can get crowded at nights, but it's not one of those places that makes you feel claustrophobic by 9 pm.  It's a nice low-key change from the normal Wrigleyville joints.",0.9946,0.661,0.328,0.01,0.5475308641975309
