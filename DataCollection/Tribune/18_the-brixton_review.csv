2016-08-27,3.0,"Came here for an early dinner and to try to catch Puppet Bike down the street on a Friday night.  The place was fairly empty since it was before six.  All the tables are high tops, so we weren't able to use a standard high chair.  They did seat us in a corner table so we could take advantage of that extra side of the booth for the baby. The drinks were great, although it did take some time for the slushie machine to get going for my Mr. Pink drink.  I was so happy to see Pimento Cheese as an appetizer so we ordered that with the Shishito Peppers.  The peppers were standard fare.  The cheese was delicious and came with a generous serving of bread.  Probably my favorite dish of the night.  The entrees took a while longer to come out.  Hubby enjoyed his Octopus dish.  I had the mussels, which were okay and had too much fennel for my taste.  Also, there wasn't enough sauce to dip the crostini, which wasn't too crispy.  We split a slice of cake that was moist and had some fresh fruit that complimented the cake.  The servers were nice and tried to interact with baby girl.  Looks like this place is popular for the bar scene, but us oldies/parents wouldn't be able to comment on that since we were done before 730!",0.9646,0.874,0.12,0.006,0.5394949494949495

2016-08-17,5.0,"I LOVED this place!! Probably one of the best restaurants in Andersonville. They have a great menu selection that I believe changes regularly. Everything we tried was better than expected.  I highly recommend the pimento cheese spread and mussels. Both were amazing! I'm a big fan of tartare and have to try it everywhere I go. Our server told us people have said their steak tartare is the best in the city and he wasn't lying. It was hands down one of the best steak tartare dishes I had ever had.  Their risotto was good but of all the things we tried it was probably my least favorite, but still really tasty.  If you're in the area, definitely check this place out. It's a friendly atmosphere with good music and a cool style of decor. You won't be disappointed!",0.9889,0.705,0.275,0.02,0.49789580789580784
2016-05-22,4.0,"Have been here for both dinner and brunch and really like the place. The urban rustic interior is nice and the music is appropriately laid back - a slow RnB mix for a lazy Sunday brunch, it could be so much worse (see: Replay). Service has been lacking each time I've been here. It's courteous and friendly enough, but mindbogglingly slow at times. At least they get the orders right, and food comes out hot. The menu is somewhat limited, but what's on there is top notch. Last time, I started with a simple broccoli/garlic/chili/parmesan appetizer. If you can do something that simple THAT well, it speaks volumes about the rest of the menu. I could seriously have ordered just that and been fine. Tried the Brixton Frittata and the Chicken Sando - both were delicious, although a little on the salty side. The bacon on the sandwich was possibly the best I've ever had; perfectly crispy and wonderfully smoky, the smell alone worth the price. The radish aioli was not quite detectable, but the blended flavor was superb. The asparagus came through very nicely in the frittata, which was beautifully flaky around the edge. Coffee was great, the juice not quite, but the drink menu is fabulous. With better service, Brixton might earn a fifth star.",0.996,0.706,0.254,0.04,0.5993386243386243

Tonight I was in with my girlfriend and ordered a drink, there were no more than 10 people at the bar...but I guess you need to be friends with the bartender to get a refill in that place. I waited with an empty glass for about five minutes before I started flagging the bartender, who didn't respond and the bar back who also didn't respond. I had to wave them down and when the bartender stopped flirting with another customer he shadily served me.  I'm sorry Millenial, it is inappropriate in a business setting to throw shade. Yes, even in Andersonville. My sweet girlfriend still tried to tip you $10 on two rounds of drafts; but I'm sorry, I'm old school service industry and, no, you do not get a tip ""just because"".  I will never set foot in this establishment that is just steps from my house. I would rather spend my money somewhere that knows to refill my drink when it is empty, and they are happy to do it. Andersonville embraces the heart of small business. Maybe the Brixton should consider that when they hire bartenders. I would never go back. I guess Acre or Jerry's will get this neighborhood girl's business. Or maybe the Brixton should reconsider the face they are presenting to the public.

If you love cheese, you need to try the pimento cheese! The best part was, the bartender heard us deciding on which appetizer we wanted, and she had it put in prior to us making our decision. We all really liked that she was so attentive. Downstairs, we had an amazing waiter. He gave us the honest truth on the items that we were thinking about ordering. My boyfriend had the sausage and kraut, while our friends had the risotto and famous burger. I had to try a little bit of two dishes and shared with the rest of the table.

Pros: your food, your drinks, you make me happy. The menu changes pretty frequently (to the point apparently that we received a different menu from what was posted on the website the same day that we went) which is a nice perk for returning. There were grits that were beyond amazing. The cocktail list is pretty short - would like to see a few more options. there were a couple vegetarian options, so i was pretty full after leaving, which is always a good sign. Cons: SERVICE. To me, service is the hardest thing to get right, as there is such a delicate balance between coming over too frequently and never showing up. We went as a party of four, and when we were seated, we were told we were a large party (four people???) and that it was highly recommended we should order appetizers and main dishes NOW and they'd course it out for us. PET PEEVE. There were quite a few apps we wanted to try, and by the time we worked our way through, half of us didn't even want to eat a main dish. Now, what exactly would have happened if we had ordered our food in advance?

The Brixton was pretty empty when we arrived because of the holiday. The bartender was also our waitress. She was friendly and fun. Our vodka cocktails were delicious and strong. I ordered the Amish Chicken. I have to say, it was the best chicken dish I have had in quite some time. The presentation was lovely. The combination of the green beans and the pickled radishes with the tender, juicy pieces of chicken and special gravy is out of this world. The sausages are a delightful addition to the plate too.

I would have expected the owner, Ted, to check in with us at some point into our meal. he did not. the entire evening felt like they were trying out the running of a restaurant. like ""this looks like fun, lets give it a try"" way to many gaps existed.  as I mentioned the food was good. every other component was terrible! my understanding is that they have been there for a while. these were items that wouldn't be acceptable the first week of operation. bad training, bad communication and bad ordering on the part of the kitchen. based on this, I would not recommend this restaurant, and I would certainly choice not to return.  my mistake...choosing this place to celebrate valentine's day....as a cubs fan...what until next year!!!",0.6219,0.839,0.079,0.082,0.5204112554112555

Hire a manager, assign sections, have the host at the podium you built at the front, have the servers serve there sections and deliver the food for that section.  First time I went there I walked in with my girlfriend. No one there to seat us. We walked all the way to the back and got the waitress, she sat us and we could immediately tell she was intoxicated. This was Easter night by the way. She asked for our drink orders and never brought the drinks until we asked again, and then, after about 30 minutes inside sitting at the restaurant she took our order. UNACCEPTABLE.  The food came out and it was all right, for sure. But we couldn't get over our drunk server. I mean DRUNK. The night sucked. Decided I wouldn't go back for a while.  Walked in tonight. No host at the podium. Waited. Finally went to the back and asked someone. The host sat us and took a drink order, I got a PBR. Then for the next 12 minutes i watched her bus tables and and get her purse downstairs and then leave. I looked at my girlfriend and told her we were gonna get our food to go. Ordered from a man and he had it together. Brought my drink, took my order, closed me out and then brought my food out.  The food is good and would be so much better and so much more reasonable if they could just get the service working. It's an immature restaurant and I've seen it time and time again and been a part of that time and time again. I blame the owner and managers. CARE!

I hosted my birthday party there last Saturday and it was such a fabulous experience that I'd give them 6 stars if I could. Owner Tim Casey helped me plan the party in the upstairs area. We primarily used the back room and the deck, but guests also spilled out into the main area where they played pool and communed by the bar. I ordered appetizers for the group--meat and cheese plates, house made beef jerky, spiced popcorn, delicious sautéed broccoli--and they were quickly consumed with thumbs up from everyone. Some guests wanted a full meal and headed downstairs to the main restaurant when the party was drawing to a close. The upstairs space has a great vibe, very laid back, great music primarily from the 80's, (some tunes really took me back) and a fabulous lounge-y feel without being pretentious or trying too hard. And the service was unparalleled. I really felt taken care of and couldn't have asked for a better birthday celebration!

The mussels were perfectly flavored - not too salty and actually seasoned well. Much better compared to Vincent's, Lady Gregory and even Hopleaf! It came with grilled pieces of bread which added greatly to the flavor. The risotto was probably one of the best that I've ever had.

Each time our servers were these incredibly batty chicks that got a little too comfortable with their customers and were just totally ""not all there."" Last night I'm positive our server was high as a kite, completely neglecting our group (which was one of only a few there at the time), forcing us to order our drinks from the bartender and repeat our food orders several times.

My date had the pork which was cooked perfectly and paired with puréed sweet potatoes that were decadent, smooth, and sweet.

2014-04-19,1.0,"I had a dinner here last night with 7 people. It was a typical Friday night, busy but not overly crowded. A few of us had gotten there early and took a spot at the bar where my friend enjoyed a great cocktail and a I myself had a house red wine and our friends had a beer. This was THE BEST PART OF THE NIGHT.  After the rest of the group arrived we were seated at a round table and greeted by a Johnny Depp look-alike waiter. As he was pouring the water my friend made the comment, ""what's wrong,"" (as he had an attitude and dismayed look on his face) and his response was, ""oh these glasses to pour the water are too far for me to reach."" His attitude about it was disgusting. Instead of simply asking for our glasses he rolls his eyes and walks away from us, not even asking if we were ready to order anything off the menu. We had our water and about 15-20 min later he finally reappeared asking for our orders.  A few of us had ordered the burger, a couple people ordered the scallops and one person ordered the pork shoulder, and the risotto. After we got our food, everyone in the group got what they ordered except for the girl who ordered the risotto. We finally are able to flag our waiter down asking about it and he runs off, without saying a single word. Comes back and basically throws down the risotto and walks off.  At this point. 45 min have passed no sign of our waiter and drinks are finished meals are done and were waiting for our check. We FINALLY are able to get him to bring us our check and we told him specifically how to do it. He wasn't listening, rolling his eyes and comes back and goes I got most of these right except this one- which was my friends and charged the wrong amount. As we were in the process of talking to him, he looks at us and goes, ""this is just too stressful and walks off."" You screwed up the bill and we are trying to understand what you did and it's somehow OUR FAULT. You were just basically dividing things in half, not that difficult to do; and no other place seems to have issues. Well, they dont until last night here at The Brixton. The waiter we had either needs a lesson on customer service or doesn't need to be in the service industry. It's quite frustrating when you are trying to be nice and polite and get nothing but eye rolling, attitude and walking away WHILE SOMEONE IS TALKING TO YOU. Completely rude, unprofessional and so disrespectful. Very disappointed in the service we received and we will NOT be returning.

2014-03-26,5.0,"Boy Oh Boy is it ever time for a review update for Brixton. My previous review was 4 stars because I was afraid to declare 5 stars before trying them a few more times. 2 more meals since the first review and a visit to the upstairs bar for drinks and I can safely say Brixton is 5 stars all the way and perhaps the best restaurant in Andersonville, surpassing Anteprima which I have held in high regard for some time now.  On our second dinner visit I had the risotto as I promised I would in my original review. Jesus Christ. I mean seriously, Lord in Heaven. We are talking magical savory, creamy, crunchy, salty, roasted, umami, perfectly cooked risotto goodness. We get a pouched egg on top. Why? Because the chef loves us. We get amazingly delicious crispy but light fried kale to let lovingly melt in our mouths. We get roasted broccoli and aged cheese. We get the most delicious dish ever. I'm not joking around here. Boyfriend had the Scallops at this second dinner visit and basically emitted all the same moanings I've typed above. Perfectly cooked and tender with truffle and cheese. They really know what they are doing here.  On our third dinner visit I decided I would try the burger. I didn't think the burger would be mediocre by any means but I did not expect it to be one of the greatest burgers I have ever had. I don't know if I can do it justice with words. To start the meat was actually seasoned, truly flavorful and moist. The burger wasn't a soggy, dripping mess that runs down your hands and arms. They didn't over do it with excessive toppings either (see Marys, Lady Gregs, Bop N Grill (in Rogers Park)). Shallot jam, bacon, cheddar and fixins. And when they say fixins they mean some sort of dressed frisee that makes this burger go from good to great. It adds crispness, freshness, lightness. Yes. Boyfriend ordered the Octopus. Again insert all of the above praise, moans and possible sorcery to create yet another ridiculously delicious dish. Potato confit, more magical frisee (I never knew frisee was GOOD) and PORK CHEEK.  Are you not convinced yet? If you disagree with me or the many other good reviews here you are simply wrong. I'm sorry. I've never felt more confidently about something. Their chef is a star and makes his dishes very well. I've asked if they will add a dessert menu or start opening for brunch and apparently these things are in the works. I can't wait to see what they will do for brunch. But regardless, they are doing dinner so well they don't need to rush it.

2014-03-16,4.0,"This place is the real deal, y'all. We came here for dinner late-ish (9:30 or so) on a Saturday night and got a table after waiting less than five minutes at the bar.  First off, the drinks were phenomenal (mine was an unusual but tasty bourbon cocktail with thyme) and I was eyeing several others on the cocktail menu I wanted to try (as well as the alcoholic root beer they have on tap). The food was also fantastic. My boo enjoyed the Brixton burger and I am now obsessed with the risotto. (Who knew risotto could be so exciting? The fried kale really helped add a ton of character and flavor to this dish.) Our sides were the fries and the broccoli, both of which were also extra tasty. This would have been a 5 star were it not for two minor things: 1) The two-tops in the front of the room are very tightly spaced together so if you are sat next to a very loud and very awkward date (like we were on Saturday), prepare yourself for that (and just hope it's entertaining). 2) The service, as others have pointed out, is not anywhere near as great as the food. Our server was very awkward, dead set on up-selling and kept unnecessarily tapping me on the shoulder or otherwise hardcore invading my personal space bubble. Very attentive except for when we were waiting for the check. Also, we waited almost five minutes at the door before a host greeted us, which was a little bizarre since they weren't terribly busy at the time. Those issues aside, will definitely be back in a heartbeat, especially to check out the upstairs lounge which I've heard a lot of positives about.

2014-03-12,1.0,"I NEVER write reviews. This experience made me so angry I just had too write something. I would have just sent an email to the manager, but they don't seem to have a website (weird). At first I was really impressed with this place. I think the interior design of Brixton, the most recent restaurant to occupy this space is by far the best it has been. It's warm, inviting, and not stuffy. The menu is limited, which in my mind is a great thing. I want a place to do a couple of things really well, verses having 150 menu items that are done so-so. The place was packed! There were 5 of us and we waited an hour for a table, no big deal, it's Friday night and they don't take reservations. It's what you expect. After a few minutes we found a couple of seats at the bar to get cocktails. The drinks were by far the highlight of our night. The bartender was busy, but still pretty attentive. And the drinks were great! We ordered a couple of snacks at the bar; cheese board and mussels. They were both pretty delicious. Then we get seated... and this is where our experience takes a turn for the worse. Our server, whom I would love to name, but I don't think it's fair to name online, was rude from the time we sat down. He was busy, I understand! But there was an almost contempt for us from the get go. We ordered a couple more snacks while we decided on entrees. He would barely let us finish our order before just walking off. You never knew if he actually heard what you were saying. And obviously he didn't on a couple of occasions. First a couple of us ordered more cocktails and only 2 out of 3 would show up. So we would have to ask again for the 3rd. Annoying, but no one was thirsty. We can deal. THEN it happened with the entrees. We all ordered entrees. Only 4 out of 5 showed up. He never seemed to care. A couple of minutes pass and we flag him down (I hate having to do this). We ask where the 5th entree is and he looks confused and asks what it was. Then scurries off to the kitchen without a word and comes back to say it'll be out in a minute and walks off again. So after a couple more minutes my friend tells the rest of us to eat so our food isn't cold. We all finish our meals slowly and still no food. The waiter finally stopped by again, not seeming to care that someone was still without food and the rest of the plates are empty. So I ask again and he runs to the kitchen without a word. This time he does return with my friends meal. Which later my friend said was one of the worst things he's ever had to eat. The server was NEVER apologetic. He seemed irritated that we are even here. He never had the manager come over to talk to us. No apologies and then he charged us for the meal that my friend barely ate.  As for the food... The other entrees were pretty good. Scallops good. Pork Shoulder OK. The chicken sandwich was the fave of the night though. Stay away from the octopus! I'm very sad that I had this terrible experience. I was so excited for a new place to hang out in AVille. I might go back for a drink at the bar, but never to eat and surely not ever anywhere near that horrible server. If the management would like to know his name, please let me know. I saved the receipt.

My date had the chicken sandwich and said it was incredible. Pork rillettes app was great. Only food complaint was that things were pretty intensely salty, and I adore salt.

2014-03-09,1.0,Stopped in on a recent Friday night. the place wasn't busy and we were excited to try the relatively new restaurant in Andersonville.  The waitress was determined to tell us way too many things about the menu even though we were clearly interested in talking with each other. We politely mentioned that we didn't need to know about the so-called organic origins of the food and drinks but she continued time and time again- she became very overbearing and down right annoying. We ordered drinks that were just average at an above average cost. with just a sip of the drink she returned to tell us about the ingredients even though we were not interested as well as not being all that sure herself. I didn't want to be rude but felt I had to be more direct with her.  We ordered and the food was very undercooked- I'm not one to return food to the kitchen but I was literally afraid of getting sick due to undercooked meat. I did order it medium-well. The meal was returned later and it was apparent they just reheated it as the outside of the meat was now nearly burnt but the inside was still close to raw. It was not only unappealing but I again was afraid of eating undercooked meat. Partners meal was average at best.  We finally decided we just wanted to get out as the service was bad and the food unappetizing. We paid our bill and informed the waitress about the food being undercooked. We went to another local restaurant where we had an excellent meal at a better price. The entrees as well as appetizers we had were awful and the service even worse. Customer do not want to be forced to listen to details about where the food came from especially when we specifically politely asked several times about it.The waitress was very ditsy and didn't have a clue. it was an awful experience and I left hungry and feeling ripped off.,-0.9083,0.809,0.08,0.111,0.5107103298592662

2014-02-19,4.0,"Where there's smoke there's.... more smoke? Has anyone else experienced this yet at The Brixton? Plumes of burnt somethingorother wafting out from the kitchen like the place was on fire? It was so bad last night that two people in our party had eye problems and the entire joint was filled with gray/black smoke.  I asked our lovely server/hostess what the deal was and she said it's normal..... I hate to disagree, but that's NOT normal, and if it is, let's invest in some better HVAC because it was uncomfortable. That's why I give The Brixton 4/5 stars - get some fans or open the kitchen window! That level of smoke isn't enjoyable for anyone.  Other than that issue, we had a fantastic time last night. Has this place read the reviews about their bad service? Because that was NOT the case for us. I walked in with a friend at 6:15 p.m. and told the hostess we'd have a part of 7 or 8 for around 7 p.m. I asked her if she advised that we sit upstairs in the bar for half an hour and then come back down (because, you know, most restaurants will not seat you unless your entire party has arrived......) but, she insisted we take a booth she had open. ""Otherwise, it might get filled and then you'd have a 2-hour wait, maybe.""  I think my mouth fell to the floor. She let two of us sit down, for 45 minutes ahead of when everyone else was going to arrive. Whoa. Major brownie points!!!! We ordered an onslaught of food and beverage; beers, wine, cocktails. Small plates and large plates (mussels - delicious, lemony broth; scallops - cooked to perfection; octopus - smoky (((is this why it was so smoky???))) and flavorful; two different dips, the risotto, duck, the cheese platter, etc etc. We might have ordered almost everything except the burger, now that I think of it... and everyone was satisfied. The only issue was that the large plates weren't entirely large, so order a few small plates to coincide if you're terribly hungry. Our hostess/server was quick with our drinks, and I just can't give enough praise to her for actually seating us without our entire group. I'd love to go for another dinner, but until the ventilation issue is solved - or summer allows the windows to be open - I probably won't venture back.",0.9584,0.819,0.108,0.073,0.5465961199294533

I've also been for wine on the first floor.  It gets busy, so service is a little slow but we weren't in a rush.  Our server was able to guide me through the list, I enjoyed the Super Baby Tuscan red, but like the Shiraz even more (fruit forward with a nice spice to it).  My friend enjoyed both his Riesling and Gewurtz.  We snacked on the pepperoni popcorn which hit the spot.

2014-02-16,1.0,"A MUST READ REVIEW - This was the single craziest dinner experience I've ever had.  After a drink in the lounge upstairs, and a fairly pleasant experience the five of us were seated in one of the booths downstairs.  Our server, who slightly resembled Johnny Depp - I say that because you should know if your being served by him and run in the other direction - was in a foul mood, no hello, no greeting.  He asked us for our drink order which took several minutes.  We then placed our appetizer order - the food was really very good.  Enter disaster and more MAJOR attitude from Johnny Depp.  We ordered our entrees.  Three burgers and one Octopus.  After a 15-20 minute wait, the Octopus entree came out.  Ten minutes later no other food.  Finally after 15 minutes, two of the three burgers came out.  Over-cooked.  One was sent back.  JOHNNY frankly was just being a complete jerk at this point.  He finally found the courage to utter a sarcastic ""I'm sorry!"" We asked for the manager who came to the table.  We explained the situation and he said he'd go see what was going on.  He never came back.  Admittedly inappropriate, one very frustrated person at our table called Johnny a b**** which frankly was a compliment compared to what I would have called him.  He said he was going to ask us to leave if our behavior continued.  We said ""with pleasure!"" And asked for our check.  We were told not to worry about the check.  We grabbed our things to leave and courageous manager finally had the testicular fortitude to appear and say these kind words. ""Good bye. Please don't come back, go online and tell all of your friends about how bad we are!""  I was blown away.  Completely one-sided!  The customer clearly is always wrong here.  And honestly, the only thing needed to rectify the entire situation was a simple, ""Hey, we screwed up your order, really sorry, what can we do to make it better?""  Instead his parting remark was, ""I can't BELEIVE you guys are acting like this when you drank and ate for free!""

So I marched out into the snowstorm. When I arrived, the tables and bar were nearly full--a good sign! After a bit of a wait (and the party behind me calling out, ""Helloooo!""), a friendly man in a plaid shirt seated us. We walked into the cozy dining area, and were greeted with the powerful aromas of bacon and shellfish. The crowd was mainly late-30s and older, and male, as if the bearded and plaid-clad hipsters of the early 2000s had entered the upper tax brackets and become portly. Mason jars and Bulleit bottles for water were a notable part of the pastiche, although the cocktail menu was surprisingly light on bourbon and rye. The wine list was pleasantly extensive and diverse, and I look forward to exploring it. I however ordered an aviation, which was decidedly unpleasant--lukewarm, green, and unstrained--with a cherry that was a welcome touch.  The menu was, in short, meat and potatoes (including jerky...), so there was very little in the way of veg fare. Hopefully it's just the winter menu, as I'd like to go back and try something besides salad and fries.  The butter lettuce salad I had was very tasty, there was a little shaved fennel mixed in, and the vinaigrette it was tossed with was very well-balanced.  There was a risotto on the menu, which I admit I would never order at a New American place, in part because it's difficult to do well--especially without the bootstraps of butter and cheese--and in part because it only reminds me of the efforts of a hundred apologetic banquet servers at every wedding you've ever attended, scraping something together for the vegetarian diners amid a kitchen full of dry, curled up chicken cutlets and cold prime rib.

2014-01-10,4.0,"Over the years, the space at 5420 N. Clark has had its fair share of tenants. The venerable and dependable In Fine Spirits made way for Premise -- which soon learned that a cute meta-handle does not a concept make -- and, later, Brassiere 54 by LM, which always seemed like it wasn't big enough for its britches. (For a more focused, satisfying French bistro experience, check out LM's Torquet on Montrose. One word: Poutine.)  And now, we have The Brixton, a new spot in an old (and, some may say, cursed) spot offering what's become many of the creature comforts you'd find in today's modern bar: mason jar glasses, a cocktail menu filled with ingredients you've never heard of, ""Daisy Cutter"" and ""Revolution"" uttered in common, languid tones.  But there's nothing common about The Brixton. In fact, in only a few short weeks, The Brixton has created the kind of experience that's been missing in the Edgewater neighborhood for years. The Brixton is exciting, it's food ambitious, even audacious, and that personality fills both levels of the space (more on that later). Some places come close. Acre has the product, Ombra the execution, Tanoshii the creativity. As a composed concept, Hopleaf and Vincent are contemporaries. But Hopleaf hasn't changed it's menu in ages (with the exception of now thin-slicing their brisket. And, by the by, I haven't forgiven you bastards for that) and you know what to expect from Vincent: Dutch-inspired, seasonal, comfortable. Meanwhile, The Brixton risks.  I found that out with my first dish, a twice-baked potato soup that, in all honestly, has ruined me for fries. A server (who I later learned was one of the owners) poured the velvety, thick-yet-silky soup into a bowl filled with crispy bacon, semi-melted white cheddar and a homemade creme fraiche. The tang of the cream rounded out an already-intense potato flavor that built on the other ingredients. Seriously, bacon and cheddar and the potato's the star? Who'da thunk it?  As I contemplated licking the bowl, my bartender Bill dropped off a piece of jerky. So let's talk about jerky for a moment.  Not a fan. As the horse from ""Ren & Stimpy"" like to say: ""No, sir. I don't like it."" Tasty shoe leather is not my idea of a good time. But I decided to give this somewhat-delayed amuse bouche a shot. Long story short, I got an order for dessert.  For $4, you get a mason jar of what I can only describe as succulent strips of marbled beef, juicy for no earthy good goddamn reason, like it didn't have shit else to do but go hang out in a steam room for 45 minutes. ""I got time,"" said the jerky. This particular jerky came lacquered in a teriyaki peppercorn sauce that hit all the salty-peppery-sweet notes. I inhaled it. No chewing, I just breathed it in, and then had a philosophical conversation with myself about gluttony and moderation because that wonderful jar o' meat was FOUR FRIGGIN' BUCKS.  It was the kind of surprise you never see coming, like finally finding Andy Samberg funny.   There was a miss, though, namely the octopus entree, which was good but not great. The octopus was a little chewy, especially on the smaller legs, but then, if you've had the spicy octopus over giant cannellini beans at Ombra, you'd find perfectly cooked scallops chewy. Still, for all its cephalopod-cooking mastery, Ombra's dish feels one-note compared to The Brixton's. Grilled eggplant in a squid ink sauce and a lightly dressed frisee salad gave the smoky octopus a bright taste. A pork-cheek crépinette acted almost like a roll to sop up that ridiculous black sauce. As a composed dish, it works beautifully. And, dude, say it with me, now: ""Pork cheek crépinette."" Before I headed out, I took a quick look upstairs. 5420's second floor has always been a fun spot, whether it offered a night of drinking and storytelling (Thanks, 2nd Story!)  or  the occasional cocktail and random chatting up of waitstaff. At The Brixton, the second floor has been converted into an adult hangout (not like that. Mind out of the gutter) complete with a pool table, tons of couches, a cool-ass fireplace and a full bar.  So, yeah, this is going to be fun, and it's going to put a dent in my wallet. I'm okay with it; I'm already planning out my next meal. Bill the bartender, a former suds slinger at Acre, considers The Brixton just a bar, a concept the neighborhood needs. I agree to disagree. Between the 80-seat restaurant, the summer patio (always fun) and the second-floor cocktail lounge, the space at 5420 N. Clark needs more than a bar. Thankfully, The Brixton is up to the challenge.  Welcome to the 'hood, guys. May you stay a good, long while.",0.9977,0.83,0.138,0.032,0.5132624950806769
2014-01-06,5.0,"My new favorite bar/restaurant/hangout!  The drinks are made from scratch by amazing bartenders - definitely try the Whiskey Thyme drink, it is one of the best whiskey cocktails in Chicago.  Every food item would fit nicely on the tables of Chicago's finest and most innovative restaurants.  The paté is out of this world.  And oh my god the french fries!  I know that sounds crazy, but trust me, they are worth ordering.  When we ate their my wife and I had the pork belly (yes!) and the grilled octopus dish (so tender!) - both were 100% delicious.  After dinner you can go upstairs where there is a fireplace, lounge chairs, couches, a pool table, and an upstairs bar.  The only bummer is I wish it was closer to my house so I didn't have to drive there!",0.9768,0.752,0.214,0.033,0.6467532467532467

2014-01-03,5.0,"So happy that there is a new quality restaurant in our neighborhood. We ate at the bar and had a lovely experience. The host, bartenders, busers and servers all worked together to provide us seem less service, hot food and a fun night. We had the crab dip (I was expecting it to be hot, but it was cold) to start and it had great flavor and plenty of toast to accompany it. We then tried the mussels, which were plump and fresh with a delicious buttery broth. Finally, we split a burger and fries. It was rich and perfectly cooked, delicious bun, cheese and an onion jam topping. I would highly recommend it all, an we look forward to going back to try more.",0.9918,0.731,0.269,0.0,0.6784006734006733

Some interesting special cocktails on the menu and a request for a margarita was super tasty! We had 3 small plates for our table of 5 and then ordered entrees for each. Crab dip was especially delish. Larger plates were awesome -- risotto was out of this world, burgers were great and steak was very good and cooked perfectly.

2013-12-26,4.0,"The beau and I had dinner there last week.  The feel of the place is warm and inviting and the food is very good.  We had popcorn with bacon powder and chives - very yummy.  The brocoli with chili, garlic and cheese was just a bit over-cooked, but still tasted very good.  I thought the mussels were fantastic, with a perfect balance between the butter and the lemon in the sauce.  My beau preferred the scallops with cauliflower (which was cooked just right) plus black truffle which he loves.   The wine list is short but strong.  I tried 3 of the red wines by the glass and enjoyed all three, especially the Round Pond Cab which is rarely sold by the glass. The upstairs is the lounge, and it feels a bit like upstairs at Danny's back-in-the-day.  Seating is comfortable and the drinks are tasty.  We'll certainly go back, probably soon.",0.9934,0.736,0.264,0.0,0.5682804232804233
2013-12-23,2.0,"Hearing the Brixton was 'hip' and 'up-scale' we went to Brixton for a special pre-Christmas dinner for two on Sunday. Dinner with wine was just under $200. I'm sorry to say that Brixton is neither 'hip' nor 'up-scale', save for their prices. Our server was excellent, to be sure. Beyond that, our experience there was both confusing and disappointing. The food was a huge miss. The plates were sloppy and muddied.  Despite our best efforts, everything we ordered lacked color, brightness, acid and crunch. Further, if you're going to charge patrons $65 for a bottle of Sauvignon Blanc, your staff should not be wearing hoodies and Chicago Bears jerseys, nor should you be blasting the Bears game on every large screen TV's.  Why are there TV's in a restaurant, anyway? What a waste of money and time! If we wanted the Hooters experience, we would have gone to Hooters and saved the money.",0.8578,0.797,0.123,0.079,0.6029914529914531

Cocktails we sampled included the old fashioned, the High Thyme, the Sid Malicious, and the Mule Skinner Blues. All were excellent. Both couples split burgers and scallops, which were also totally on point. Love it when the default cooking temp for my burger is medium rare, and it comes out truly medium rare.  Service was warm and relaxed, and the decor and seating feel like a big step up from when it was Brasserie LM. I'm excited to spend some time upstairs at the pool table and fireplace with a nice cocktail on a snowy winter night.",0.978,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.6929166666666666
2013-12-19,5.0,"The Brixton is exactly what I was waiting for in Andersonville. Upscale food in a laid back/unpretentious atmosphere. This space has been through a few owners recently but with Kevin McMullen (formerly of EL Ideas) as executive chef I knew the food would be top notch and I wasn't disappointed. Have been back twice in the past week since i'm in the neighborhood and the menu includes everything from great twists on bar snacks and enormous burgers to octopus and chicken liver pate - all of which are fantastic and as a bonus the kitchen is open till Midnight so its a great spot for a late bite and a drink. After dinner you can also head upstairs and hit the lounge, there are lots of little nooks to have a drink or you can shoot some pool and listen to good music. The lounge is open till 2AM. To top it off the staff and service are on point, the beer list is well thought out and provides some nice craft beer options as well as decent inexpensive options, and the cocktails provide some great twists on classics as well. Basically I will be spending a lot of time here and recommend you do the same.",0.9946,0.761,0.226,0.013,0.5257246376811594
2013-12-16,5.0,"The wife and I were heading to Andersonville to grab dinner with some friends.  On the way she saw this custom perfume store for the holidays and I noticed that there was a bar next door.  After agreeing that she will play with the scents while I go for a drink we were on our way.  Shortly into this she decided to join me in Brixton. We walk in and it has a really chill atmosphere with good music that is at a perfect volume to enjoy a conversation and your drink. So we sit by the bar and Rudy is the barkeep.  We get to talking and this is followed by looking at their signature mixed drinks.  And with the amount of fresh citrus, spices, Luxaro cherries, and so forth at their disposal I would be ashamed to order anything but one of their specialties.  I had a High Thyme, Old Fashioned, some mixed drink that started with an L (sort of like a Manhattan but with Rye), and a Malort drink!! Yes this place makes Malort taste amazing.  I do not know how they do that. We ended up having our friends meet us here where we went to town on the food menu.  Home made Jerkey (yes my friends a bar with an extensive whiskey menu and home made jerkey), bacon popcorn, pate, crab dip, and then hanger steak.  They are all solid choices and I am happy I ate way too much here.  I'd do this every week if I didn't live in the suburbs.",0.9899,0.828,0.164,0.008,0.4337254901960784

I almost forgot about the upstairs.  I didn't spend much time up there, but it has a lounge feel, very cozy.  There is a fireplace and a pool table, fun couches and seating nooks.  Definitely worth a weekend evening.",0.9771,0.802,0.18,0.018,0.5472132034632035
