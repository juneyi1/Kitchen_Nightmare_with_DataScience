We were greeted by the owner or manager or whoever he is talking on his phone. He continued to stay on his phone while he grabbed menus and seated us. Our server came over and we soon learned they were out of all the bottles of wine that we wanted. We settled on a bottle of Rose. We immediately  put in our food order since the bottle took some time to get to us. 2 simple pasta dishes and a salad. Halfway through the bottle, THEN they decide to bring out the bucket with ice...a little too late? It took a little longer than it should have for our food to come out, but we had drinks so we were fine. The food came out and it was delicious! No complaints at all about the food. We ordered an extra glass of wine as we were winding down our meals since we had to get back to work soon. After waiting and waiting and WAITING for our server to come back, we had to literally SHOUT over to him for a box and our check. We shouted like 3 times before he actually paid any attention to us. Mind you, this was NOT a busy time. I think there were maybe 2 tables inside and two outside. He had another server bring out our check and since the service wasn't exactly quick, we had our cards and ready to just split it 3 ways evenly. We waited another 20 minutes before I just walked into the door and stood there as the owner and two servers stood there running our cards. Once they realized I was standing there he explained to me that because we had 3 cards it took some time. I explained that I was a server and it shouldn't really take that long to swipe cards. No apology, no offer for a drink, nothing. We then signed out tabs and quickly left.

This place was about the closest I've found so far. While it looked expansive when we walked in, the host guided us to a smaller dining room that reminded me of some of the places I dined in Venice and Rome. Their wine menu was decent, but would have loved the option of draught wines in liters like you'd fine in Italy. To their credit, I haven't found any restaurant that does this in Chicago... But I thought this would be it! I would have loved to compare the lasagna to that found by the Rialto bridge in venice (the best ever)... But I saw the goat cheese and pesto stuffed chicken and couldn't resist. Goat cheese is something I just can't turn down, ever. Although my experience was fantastic and I would certainly return to sample more of the menu - I was a little disappointed to find out more than 5 minutes after ordering that they were out of goat cheese.

The small, homey atmosphere from the moment you walk in tells you this is an authentic, family restaurant. A rare commodity for being on the border of the Loop.

Ask for extra basil if you're a fan - I could've gone with more than one leaf in topped on the center. I can't not mention the accommodating and friendly staff! I dined in on a Wednesday night and barely made a dent in my pizza. They packaged it up but I forgot to snatch it when I left!

2014-12-27,2.0,"Sub-par pasta, which is actually something that's difficult to make. This is the one ""nice"" place within a 90-second walk of my office, so it remains on the list of lunch choices when there is a festive occasion. There is a nice outdoor patio, and the inside is warm and cozy enough.  Helpful servers that sometimes err on the side of attentiveness.   Perhaps I'm not ordering the right thing, but I have never liked my food here. I once tried the farfalle with chicken and peas. The peas were somehow overcooked and dried out and the pasta was undercooked, well beyond al dente.  How do you screw that up?   I also had a perfectly mediocre penne arrabbiata (too garlicky, and again with the way too al dente), and the appetizers I've tried (bruschetta and calamari) are ordinary at best.  Co-workers have been similarly underimpressed by the sandwich offerings.  I do hear good things about both the pumpkin ravioli and the gnocchi, but both of those are a little heavy for lunch, if I want to avoid napping under my desk.   I can't speak to the drink offerings (as I've only been for work lunches) but they do seem to have an okay selection of wines. Perhaps my strategy should be happy hours when the outdoor dining section is re-opened, and steer clear of the ""meh"" pasta offerings.",0.9809,0.814,0.149,0.037,0.65995670995671

The service was the worst I've had in Chicago for this price-range. Four separate instances contributed to this: (1) When we arrived, the restaurant actually meant to ""close off"" all OpenTable bookings since they had two bridal showers on the same day. Because of this, they had to scramble together to find a table for us. Even more odd, was the manager, Jennifer, confided to us that it was an accident they booked the two same bridal showers in the same day. It seemed generally unorganized. (2) Their OpenTable status is byob and no corkage fee. However, at the restaurant their menu says $15 for corkage fee. But verbally, they told us it was $20. When we asked about the misleading information our waitress Mariya barely apologized nor gave us an explanation.  (3) There was about a 45 minute period where the waitstaff did not check on us. Our plates of unfinished food was on the table. Because the tables are so small, we just moved the plates ourselves to another empty table so we could have some space. (4) It took us about 25 minutes to get our check. Ultimately, I had to find the manager to ask for our check. Then, after another 10 minutes the check still did not come, where I had to find the manager again (because our waitress was MIA) to ask for the check.  Overall, the food was OK, but the service was very neglectful and disrespectful.

We were a little skeptical about Isabella's but again, we were hungry so we went for it. To start, the waiter was rude. He largely ignored me. I'm saying he turned his back on me to talk to my date. We ordered bruschetta. It was all wrong. There was literally only one piece of basil, set in the middle of the plate as a garnish. We ordered pasta (pesto gnocchi and duck tortellini) and both dishes were swimming in sauce. Italians don't drown their pasta in sauce! Also it was definitely reheated. I'd eat one tortellini and it would be lukewarm, another and it'd be scalding. When we were finally able to pay our bill our waiter started complaining to us about how another waiter was yelling at him. He then came back and asked us if we really needed change back and when we asked for $5 he started to sweat and explained that there was no money in the cash register (what???) and that he'd have to run around all over town looking for money.

The wine list is mostly Italian but nicely affordable.  We started with an appetizer and then had several main courses, mostly pastas, and their lamb chops.  I had the Linguini Calabrese (shrimp, broccoli, spinach in a white wine sauce), very nice.  The portion sizes were average for dining in the city.   The service was attentive and friendly, the owner stopped by to say hello and ask about our experience, which is always a nice touch.  We ended our meal with espresso, cannoli and lemoncello gelato - all delicious.  All in all, Tratorria Isabella is a solid choice for Italian if you're in the area.  I'm not sure it was good enough to rate a special trip, but if you're looking for a great patio experience on an 80 degree Saturday evening in the city - you should absolutely give it a try.",0.9922,0.774,0.2,0.026,0.5369160997732426

My boyfriend has lived in the area for years and we had always walked past the patio and wanted to try it. We finally wandered in and had a seat in the wonderful outdoor patio. I started with a glass of wine, he had a dirty martini on the rocks with blue cheese stuffed olives. The waiter came back with his drink in a classic martini glass (not on the rocks) and then gave him a glass of ice to fix it himself. He then informed us they were out of blue cheese, so it had a lonely pitted olive that was ROTTEN. I'm talking he bit into it, spit it out and saw that it was actually purple inside (no, it wasn't a black olive.. just a really old green olive). We got the Frito Misto as an appetizer and it came out luke-warm, unseasoned and with an awful mayo-like sauce. One bite into the calamari and shrimp and I could immediately tell it was well-beyond its shelf life. It was so awfully fishy and strange-tasting, it made my stomach queasy almost instantaneously.  We then received our dinners, his the chicken marsala (sp?) and mine a bowtie, chicken pasta dish. My pasta was okay; however I picked out the chicken as it was rubbery and offered no flavor.

If you are looking for a cool patio to dine on in the summer months and don't really care about the food, this place will do the trick.

The clams were not fresh at all and there was no taste in the pasta. The mezzaluna was just bland...  Service - Horrible. Our server was not nice and we barely even saw him through the meal. He just seemed annoyed to be there and spoke very coldly. He would disappear sporadically and we had to wait about 20 minutes after eating just to get our check. Would not go there again!!! There are too many other Italian restaurants in the city to go to for better food and better service. Don't waste your time here.",-0.5702,0.77,0.105,0.125,0.5628472222222223

2011-12-19,2.0,"The staff at this restaurant are friendly and very helpful. Somehow there is a lack of coordination. After our party was seated, we ordered drinks. While we were waiting for our drinks, two more waiters came by our table to take our drink order. Not a big deal but usually a disappointing indicator of things to come. One of us asked for a hot toddy. We were told that even though the barman worked at famous hotels' bars for years he'd never heard of the drink. Maybe. Even so, they could have looked up the drink on their copy of Professional Bartender's Handbook. Or they could have looked up the drink on their computer (yes they have at least one connected to the internet) or on a smartphone. C'mon now. Bread was brought to the table. Stale and dry, and at room temperature, as if it was sliced hours ago. Is it that difficult to serve the bread warm?  Next disappointment: no homemade pasta except for the papardelle.  This is a pet peeve of mine. No italian restaurant worth its olive oil uses dry pasta. If you can make dough for papardelle you can also cut it into spaghetti, tagliatelle, and just about anything else you want. If I can do that at home with my little Imperia roller, so can you Trattoria Isabella. The antipasto plate we ordered for starters looked like a presliced plate you find at supermarket's deli counters. That was disappointing as well. With so many decent salumeria's in Chicago, there is no excuse for serving Wild Boar-quality antipasto. The roasted beet appetizer was ok. The beets were too thin for this kind of dish, I think. The main entrees were unremarkable. The portions were decent. What the dishes lacked in flavor they compensated with the richness of butter or cream added in them. Given the restaurant's location, it could be an awesome destination for city dwellers of the nearby high-rise buildings. It can also be a popular after-work destination.

We were completely ravenous after a day where coffee was our only nourishment.  Perhaps this is why the warm, crispy basket of bread, brought out with garlic-infused olive oil, seemed so amazing. For wine, we ordered Terrabianca Campaccio Super Tuscan that at one point in time, we had at home on the wine rack.  The mark-up at the restaurant was a bit steep, as to be expected, but it fit the bill for our heavy dinner. We decided to share two appetizers, the grilled octopus and a gnocchi pasta special.  We received an entree-sized portion of octopus for around $9.  My tastes are forever biased after living in one of the octopus capitols of the world, but I did find the texture of the octopus at Trattoria Isabella to be tough and chewy in spots. The gnocchi was a delightful surprise!  These little potato pillows were just a tiny bit firm (mushy gnocchi? - no thanks!) and were cooked in a plum tomato sauce of the perfect acidity. For the main course, I ordered whitefish, which came with assorted vegetables.  The fish was lightly prepared in a lemon butter sauce, topped with diced shrimp, and the portion was large enough to have leftovers for the following day.  It was a solid and simple dinner; comfort food is generally not meant to overwhelm the senses. I also snagged a taste (and some leftovers) of bucatini in a meat-based tomato sauce.  (Bucatini looks like spaghetti, except the center is hollowed out.)  We asked whether the pastas are fresh and made on-site.  Unfortunately, they are not which is surprising for a ""traditional"" Italian restaurant.  This was also a hearty, comforting dish prepared in an excellent sauce. For dessert, we shared the ""famous"" tiramisu.  It broke my heart to consider this tiramisu.  A sad, pathetic slice of sponge cake was topped with whipped cream that faintly tasted of coffee.  Where was the marscapone?  And the coffee-soaked savoiardi?  Accept no imitations!  3.5 stars - I'll definitely be back to Trattoria Isabella but I will also be on the lookout for venues to feast on homemade pasta.",0.9911,0.763,0.17,0.067,0.5848777348777349

If I didn't have to go back to work I would have taken more advantage of such a pleasant setup. Service was fairly good and to the point. They have a reasonable range of draft beers and a large variety of Italian dishes. My friends selected the tilapia special, which looked good and they were quite pleased with it as it came with two filets of tilapia, potatoes and greens. As for myself - just a straightforward bolognese which I find is one of the most reliable barometers of an Italian restaurant. It was ok - sofrito thankfully was not overt and obvious - sauce had a nice taste overall but nothing really stood out about it.

2011-06-07,2.0,"Frankly, I do not know how this place remains in business with so many other top notch and well celebrated restaurants at a stone's throw from this place.  The food at Trattoria Isabella is mediocre at best and nothing to rave about. The marinara sauce that came with the pasta and pancetta was so sour that it was quite difficult to enjoy. Their fried calamari is just adequate but forgettable. I think the saving grace for this place is their outdoor patio. The patio is probably the only reason they remain in business. In the summer, their patio is always packed but once you peek into the dining room, it's empty. Last summer on a weekend, my husband and I ate at the dining room as it was a little too hot for comfort sitting outside. We were the only ones in the dining room while the patio was bustling. It was strange. During winter, we don't see many people inside the dining room either whenever we walk by it. My theory is that they depend on the summer profits from the patio to compensate for the lack of business at the dining room when it's not summer. And really, I think people are there in the summer just to hang out at the patio since their food is lacking in goodness.

2010-04-23,2.0,"I would really like to give a better rating to Trattoria. It was my first time dining there and first impressions are sometimes hard to overcome. I took a couple of clients there for dinner who were in town for the Kitchen and Bath Show. Probably should have stayed with a known restaurant but what the heck, thought I'd give it a try. The food -  Overall, our food was quite good. The grilled calamari was perfectly cooked and seasoned. I had the Risotto Primavera while my clients both had specials of the day. So the food gets a solid 4-Star rating. The menu - Wow....that was a bit of a chore to get through. Personally, I think a smaller menu would be a really good idea. Too many choices. Even though I enjoyed my Risotto, I couldn't help but think about all the other things on the menu and wonder if I had made the best choice.  The atmosphere - The night was a beautiful evening so the patio was open so of course we decided to enjoy the nice air. The patio is huge and with KBIS in town, it was packed. I went inside to check it out and felt it was both welcoming and warm and certainly somewhere you would want to come dine with friends and linger over good food and good conversation. The service - I can say I've had worse but have had better and much, much better more often. One thing that really bothered me was our waiter had dirty fingernails. Eww. Maybe because the restaurant was crowded (on the patio) I felt a bit rushed. We were in no hurry but he kept coming back and asking for our order. I ordered wine and when asked for recommendations, the first question was ""how much do you want to spend"". Of course budgets parameters need to be established but how about ""do you prefer red or white"" ""medium or full bodied"" or the usual questions. The bread basket was literally plopped on our table - no parm, no olive oil poured on the plate, just ""here's your bread"". Other than bugging us to order, our waiter was not that attentive. The first impression - Here is where the stars burn out. The host was at best rude. Very short with us and quite frankly seemed annoyed that we were there. I realize you've been at this a long time but really, no need to bark at us. He seemed quite angry at something. Maybe because the place was busy? Not sure. But anyway, he sat people that came in after us and I noticed that both times it was all men. Am I reading something in that? Maybe not. Maybe he was just confused. But the worst part was how rude he was when he did come to take us to our table. He waved to us and pointed to the dining area. What? Then when he saw we had drinks in our hands, he came over and barked ""you pay then you sit"". I said ""ok"" and was promptly barked at again...""you pay then you sit"". The bartender was busy so she wasn't able to immediately rush over with our tab. He became flustered and came over and scowled at us and kept trying to rustle us off to our table. Well, dude, I was trying to pay first as ordered. I know that if we were not all really hungry at that point, we would have left. The bottom line - I'll go back but am not relishing the thought of encountering the angry elderly man or lack of top rate service. In this city, with so many choices, you really have to be on the top of your game in every area. Tratorria Isabella is on it when it comes to the food.

We walked in through the bar entrance and found 3-4 people at the bar and perhaps three tables occupied in the bar area.  We opted to sit in the dining room because the bar had a guy on a Casio blaring tunes.   When we got to the dining room we saw one table occupied.  I started to hope this wasn't a harbinger, as it was at one particular Italian-French place on West Randolph that ended up being a disaster. I ordered the rigatoni with vodka sauce.  She had the cheese tortellini with some chicken added.  We also had the bruschetta for an appetizer.  The bruschetta was alright and a steal at $5.  She liked her tortellini.  I tasted it but only thought it was okay, as it was a bit bland.  As to my rigatoni with vodka sauce,  I was pretty disappointed.  I've had vodka sauce quite a few times at Italian restaurants and cook up pasta myself at home with vodka sauce.  This wasn't a vodka sauce.  It was an arrabiata sauce, of which I'm generally not a fan.  It was spicy and not creamy whatsoever.  I ate it, but I was disappointed. Service here is a team effort and was generally good, but they really dropped the ball badly but not having any parmesan cheese for the olive oil and bread or my pasta.  That is a major faux pas in an Italian restaurant. By the time we left at around 8 p.m., there were 6-7 tables occupied in the dining room, making it approximately one-quarter full.  I don't know if that's due to the economic times we are in, the quality of the food or a combination of both.   There are too many places that I think are better than Isabella for me to return here.  Tuscany, Rosebud and Orso's and three places that immediately come to mind that are much better.   I tried, Izzy.  Two stars.",-0.1761,0.871,0.065,0.064,0.5252164502164501

What I got was a bit of a puzzle for while Trattoria Isabella welcomed me with open arms ( a very friendly manager/owner greeted us and asked for our return business upon our departure), the food and service in the dining room, did not live up to my expectations.  First the positives. I liked the bar. The bartender quickly poured me the perfect drink and the patrons were friendly as I waited for my friend to arrive. The music was a bit funny (all Bee Gees all the time) and played at a high volume that they finally turned down when they realized it was playing at the same volume in the dining room as well.  In the corner of the bar area was the wood burning oven making the room warm and toasty.  I probably should have gone with the wood fired pizza as it looked terrific coming out of the oven and the melted cheese smelled amazing.  But on this blustery night- warm, filling comfort food was needed so I knew I was going to be having pasta.  First up- for my appetizer I went with the grilled calamari salad. While there was plenty of calamari on the plate- it had such a charred after taste it was not good. And my friend's minestrone soup came up cold and it needed to be sent back.  The highlight of the dinner was my bow tie pasta with chicken, peas and mushrooms in a creamy red sauce. Quite tasty and a huge portion (there will definitely be leftovers for later). Unfortunately, my friend's whitefish was not as good and came drowning in the sauce.  Service was just okay but not overly attentive. We could not get the servers attention to take the soup back to heat it up. We finally had to flag down a busser to get the server- here again- a good server is usually more aware of what people are doing in their section, and not eating their food, should be a clue to a problem.  Dinner for two with no drinks and no dessert ran about $67 before tip.  With so many great Italian restaurants in the Chicago area- I doubt I will be back unless it is too have a drink in the bar. Too bad- as there are not alot of places in this neighborhood within walking distance of my friend's place for Italian food. Darn!

To start with we ordered a bottle of wine which was good enough, but when our glasses were drained our waiter never came to refill them. We ended up having to refill them ourselves, big service no no. Also bread was never brought to our table, we had to ask for it when we got our meal.  Overall the service was pretty bad, our waiter said it was his first night and that he had this huge section, which when we looked, it wasn't very huge at all. He also didn't know the table numbers so the food runners kept bringing out food to our table that wasn't ours and our food to other tables... The whole night.

Here is a rundown of service snafus over two separate visits to Isabellas (wanted to give it a second chance): Waiter takes my date's order for an appetizer than runs away from the table without asking me if I want to order an appetizer also. I only have the chance to order mine after he brings hers. In a near empty restaurant, we wait 30 minutes between the appetizer and having the opportunity to order our entree. Waiter recommends a wine that he then finds out they are out of. Waiter fails to ask if we want dessert or coffee and brings the check. Hugely disinterested waiter fails to tell us about any of the specials on the night's menu or about any of the du jour dishes but we know they have them because other tables get them. At least 4 times (yes, 4) the assistant waiter/busboy brings us someone else's dish before bringing ours. We watch him move from table to table with the dishes asking people if the order is theirs. I flag him down and ask him if they do not have a system for knowing which order goes with which table and he tells me that sometimes the waiters do not put down the table number (Inexcusable!)   We are told they have creme brulee on the dessert menu and order it only to be told by a second waiter that they do not have creme brulee.  Long waits again in between ordering and we have to flag down the waiter to do so. He is neither friendly nor efficient and disinterested to the point of being rude.  These people do not have even a small clue about how to provide service at a restaurant. I am not in the industry but I could run a better place than this shoddy excuse for a restaurant.

The food and service are very good.  I've been several times and I've had several of the fish dishes, chicken vesuvio, a salad, soup and dessert.  Everything is fresh and homemade.   I don't know if I will frequent as often once winter hits, because the interior isn't as compelling.",0.9425,0.779,0.202,0.019,0.5746666666666667

Love the Spaghetti Bolognese.  It's a true bolognese as opposed to an Olive Garden tomato sauce, so if that's what you expect you'll be disappointed. Friends had the grilled octopus and grilled calamari and were happy. The frutti de mer (sp?) was abundant, maybe even more fish than noodles.  Everyone was very pleased with their entrees.",0.9781,0.741,0.259,0.0,0.7616883116883119

2008-06-25,3.0,"I work across the street and this place has been jumping for weeks with both lunch and dinner crowds. The outdoor patio is nicely spaced so you don't feel like everyone around you is sitting at your table. Indoors is just the opposite, a little too crowded for the seating, but the raised floor gives a nice view if you're seated by the windows. The food is always fresh and delicious. Groups I've gone with have had pastas, burgers, and meat entrees. No one has ever said anything bad. Be warned, though, that the food arrives HOT! Be careful before taking your first few bites, don't want to burn your mouth! The servings are very generous, so we haven't tried their desserts. If you go for dinner, you have better chances of finding metered street parking than you would at lunch hour since most of the workers from surrounding buildings have left for the day, but it's only 1 block from the Clinton el stop, so easily accessible by the CTA. Overall, the food and experience is good and the wait staff is friendly and attentive. I'd reccomend for a nice dinner out.",0.9785,0.729,0.186,0.085,0.5738636363636364
2008-06-21,4.0,"I first ate here when it first opened and was not impressed. Several weeks ago, I went back with friends - the four of us had a very good meal. So which is the real Isabella. Was back last weekend again with friends and the 4 of us had very good meals. We sat out on the patio which is great. The food is typical Italian, the pasta was very good as were the appetizers as well as the selection, again no surprises. We did not do desserts but had coffee and wine. The wine selection is very good both by the glass and bottle and the prices are reasonable. Do not expect this to be Guide Michelin 3 star food - and I am not trying to knock Isabella's but is is very good and worth eating at.",0.9678,0.794,0.183,0.023,0.437962962962963
2008-06-17,4.0,"Went to try this place again now that they have the outdoor patio open and was much more impressed this time around. First off, they did an amazing job with the patio and nicely custom built outdoor full bar with TVs included. Secondly, I tried a different pasta this time around and it was much better than last time. The tortellini quattro formaggi was excellent. On a somewhat sour note, the cheese cake wasn't quite as good as the first time. Overall, a much improved experience though!",0.955,0.77,0.204,0.026,0.48137254901960774
2008-06-16,2.0,"What to do for lunch?  Let's try that new place on Clinton? Ok.  Trattoria Isabella it is! Just as we took our seats on their outdoor patio I noticed a strong smell of cigarette smoke.  I noticed the lady to our right was smoking a cigarette. First off I think that's illegal. Secondly, I hate cigarettes and the smell of them!  Audrey and I decided to move tables rather than smelling like a dirty ashtray by the end of our lunch.  The manager rushed over from the table where the smoker was sitting and asked why we were moving. I let him know that it was due to the cigarette smoke. Rather than apologizing or having his friend put out her cigarette he just escorted us to our new table.  He said ""there aren't many people here right now so I thought it would be ok to let her smoke.""  Yikes!   Our server quickly brought out water and bread for us. The bread was very good and they have a bottle of rosemary infused olive oil on the table which was also yummy.  I tried to order the Caprese salad, but the waiter informed me that because of the ecoli scare they were not serving tomatoes.  I understand their concern, but an independent restaurant like this could easily procure quality non ecoli infested tomatoes from one of a hundred different purveyors in Chicago. I was just at the Green City Market that morning and there were plenty of beautiful Tomatoes available.  I made a comment about wanting to order the Bruschetta as well and the waiter let us know that they were replacing the tomatoes in that dish with roasted peppers.  So we ordered the Bruschetta, the Carpaccio, Garbanzo Bean Soup, and the Carbonara to share.  The Roasted Red Pepper Bruschetta was delicious as was the Carpaccio!  The Carpaccio was topped with mixed greens, heart of palm, grilled artichoke hearts, and capers. The Garbanzo Bean soup was also good.  For our entree we split the Spaghetti Carbonara and asked that the spaghetti be switched to penne.  The sauce was creamy, rich, and the prosciutto added a nice fat to the dish.  I did notice that there we two different types of penne on our plate.  I don't think this was intentional.   We sat on their patio so I can't speak to the interior space, but the patio is really nice. The tables and chairs aren't the most comfortable, but there aren't many patios larger than this in the entire city.  The service was odd.  Mostly because of the cigarette snafu, but there were other things that just made me wonder. One server tried to deliver another table's order to us and most of the servers were watching the Euro Cup more closely than their tables.  All in all the food was really good, but the service was as odd as the food was good.   I love supporting local mom and pop's. However, the manager said that they own many other restaurants. I asked which other restaurants the group owned and he basically said none at the moment. Apparently, this group buys restaurants and then sells them once they are operating.  If I'm in a pickle and can't make it to Gio's I'd try it again. 1 Soup 1 Bruschetta 1 Carpaccio 1 Penne Carbonara ------------------------------ $38.00",0.993,0.84,0.118,0.043,0.5369493771534589

When I feel like a little change I order the linguine fruitte di mare.  Both are huge portions and I always take leftovers home.  Chicken parm is also quite good.  The best part is the addition of the outdoor patio and full bar.  The west loop finally has a place where you can go, order a decent bottle of wine for not a lot of money and just enjoy being outside.",0.9748,0.738,0.216,0.046,0.6120833333333334
2008-06-10,4.0,"Picked a perfect night to sit outside on their 'urban' patio and try this place for the first time.  The wines we chose (Red Zin and the Chianti) were OK.  Caesar salad above average.  The entrees, Veal Parmesan and the Gnocchi were very, very good.  They even added broccoli to the Gnocchi upon my wife's request.  Also substituted farfale for the spaghetti with my veal, without complaint.  Service with Felipe was attentive and friendly.  Canolli to top it off at the end was very good.  We will make the 20 minute walk from our condo again for this very good place.  Prices about average.",0.9717,0.799,0.201,0.0,0.4514583333333334
2008-06-10,3.0,"My husband and I are locals and have eaten there twice. Both times on Saturday around 6:30 and 7:30. Earlier on it's not bad, but as the tables fill the noise is considerable, especially dishes and silverware being thrown around in the kitchen behind you.  Our first waitresss was OK, our second one had a bit of an attitude when I pointed out my glass was filthy, but she did offer to get me a clean one. So the atmostphere is not romantic if that's what you're looking for, and with so much noise you can't hear across the table. It would not be so bad if it wasn't so noisy. The food is alright for the price, nothing to write home about but not bad. We've had the seafood specials and the linguini and clams, all too salty but probably OK for most people. Not much of a selection for dessert (3 total, including 2 cheeecakes).  We probably won't go back. Our last meal cost $92 and I only had an entree and an espresso, so there is better food for that price around. Not sure if they'll be able to stay in business... the outdoro area might save them, particularly with locals looking for an easy hangout.",0.99,0.811,0.176,0.012,0.5415598290598291
2008-06-02,3.0,"Sunday afternoon in the West loop is a dire affair, walking by some of the most outstanding restaurants in the city with no lights on and locked doors.  Alas, the new addition to the neighborhood came to the rescue with their even more recent patio and bar addition.   It was a sunny afternoon and cafe style fit the bill. Yeah I read Anthony Bourdain's Kitchen Confidential last week and I pretty much figured Sunday was going to be the previous nights leftovers but I still gotta eat.  Our Menus arrived at 12pm and it clearly was labelled 'Dinner'; I inquired about this since it was a bit early for dinner and was told it was dinner all day as it would be too much to switch over from lunch.  I might agree if the menus were that much different other than a sandwich section.  Fire up your damn Foreman grill and make me a panini!  We were offered to split a plate as the waiter assumed the reason I wanted the lunch menu was money.  That was insulting; I just don't feel like eating a full Italian spaghetti and meatballs at noon on a Sunday.     So at any rate, I at least avoided the specials and ordered Farfalle Pollo in pink sauce.  The sauce that arrived was orange, the portion very large, but mostly just pasta, sauce and a few peas accompanied by about an ounce of chicken.  Don't skimp me on chicken, I'll bring you a rotisserie chicken from Dominick's to mix in if you insist; protein people. The atmosphere from the nice day, large patio and tasteful outdoor addition/bar was very pleasant and the main selling point. Yeah I'll be back because I live around the corner and the restaurateurs have yet to swoop in on the weekend hours, probably waiting until the mega-condos complete.  Next time I'm holding out for a better experience though.",0.912,0.831,0.103,0.066,0.49139610389610383

The prices here are pretty moderate... like between $12-$16 for most dishes.  The place is also decorated really well - looks pretty upscale.  Also they're still in the process of finishing their patio, which includes a full bar and looks like it will be awesome this summer!   Finally, I just have to address the comment below by Rose regarding the ""third world staff"".  Uhh, seriously??  Please keep your ignorant self out of my neighborhood, thanks.  I personally found the staff to be nothing but delightful.",0.9932,0.767,0.199,0.034,0.5948015873015873
