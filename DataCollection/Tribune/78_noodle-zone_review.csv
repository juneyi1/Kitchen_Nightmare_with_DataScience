Crab rangoon is usually my favorite part of takeout Thai/Chinese/etc, but this time I barely ate any of it. My Mongolian beef was... okay. It was drowning in sauce and everything was soggy as a result. I also find it odd that I have to pay $1.00 extra for the rice that would be included with the dish anywhere else. I did really like the mango peach bubble tea, but I don't appreciate paying $20 for food that can be summed up as ""Meh, I've had better.""",0.2029,0.836,0.081,0.083,0.46111111111111114

Solidly mediocre.  Edible, and sort of Thai, almost Chinese, and kind of Japanese.  I'm going to say that the Chineseish dishes are your best choices, the pseudo-Japanese clearly your worst.  Maybe they should add Korean and Filipino dishes to create kind of a World War II zones of conflict theme.  Would anyone think a restaurant serving ""North American cuisine,"" could work?  I guess actually a place that served poutine, tamales and brats might arouse my curiosity so strike that.

She'd originally suggested a Thai restaurant nearby that was mysteriously closed on a Saturday night, so she suggested Noodle Zone as another BYOB noodle/Asian place. The restaurant is not very big although I think they probably do a lot of takeout - eating in wasn't terribly busy. We sat down with our bomber of beer and bottle of wine and were presented with menus, wine glasses and a bottle opener. The menu is what I would call pan-Asian - everything from pad Thai to sushi to curry to potstickers. We started with potstickers and I ordered the drunken noodles with chicken. While they may not do everything well, the potstickers were crispy (deep fried) and juicy, and the drunken noodles were really good - not an enormous portion, but it was only about $9. Unfortunately I made a huge mess when we tried to open the beer - I guess it had gotten shaken up in my car more than I realized and it overflowed all over the table. The wait staff was very kind and helped us mop everything up, replacing napkins and sticky menus and telling us not to worry about it. And, they never bugged us to get out after we'd finished eating - we sat there a bit longer with our wine, in the relatively quiet restaurant, and they just kept refilling our water. This is not high-end cuisine, and it may not be the most authentic, but it's cozy, comfortable, friendly and the food is tasty and inexpensive. And BYOB!",0.9589,0.87,0.096,0.034,0.5942793317793319

I thought it was supposed to be some sort of hidden gem but I guess everyone knows about it. With that said, I didn't wanna be that dude going in there surrounded by all these people on dates and shit while I slurp on ramen by my lonesome. I was just hungry and didn't feel like being judged you know? So I U-turned my bike and went back south on Clark when I saw the neon sign. ""Noodle Zone"" it said. They gotta have ramen right? ""Who cares! Just lock this bitch up and eat already!"" my stomach growled.  Inside was a table of loud, old, asian men shooting the shit. I'm guessing one of them was the owner and the rest were his homies. The cute waitress sat me down quickly; I was the only other person there. The menu was divided into two parts: all sorts of asian and sushi. Ramen was nowhere to be found. Oh well. They did have udon but I wasn't feelin' it.

Throw in a spicy salmon roll too just because. The sushi came first. It wasn't that all that and I can see why they have 1/2 off every day but it was edible and I wasn't sick the next morning. The curry however was quite interesting. I don't know where they get their duck from but for some reason this dish worked.

I now know that you can't judge a place by it's Yelp! reviews.  The waitress was polite, cute, and very helpful, despite not being too refined in her English communication skills.  She made suggestions, rather than simply agreeing with everything we asked about (which is typical of Asian restaurants).   The menu was also a plus, full of pictures, but somehow looked tasteful and placed less emphasis on sheer quantity (with an annoying numbering system like many Asian restaurants insist on implementing), and more emphasis on type of food (the noodle dishes were all in one place, easy to find, and organized by type of meat/ingredients, same with the curries, sushi, etc.)  The appetizer came out on time, and the main course was ready when the appetizer was finished. The half-price sushi is a great idea, allowing you to mix-and-match different rolls onto one plate, for a reasonable price.  If it were up to me, this place would have ONE dollar sign. The duck curry was AMAZING!!! I've never had anything like it.  Coconut-base with steamed lychee, pineapple and raisins in the sauce, and delicious thinly-sliced duck. The shrimp hot pot was also great.  For being so cheap, the shrimp had that sweet and fresh taste that high-quality shrimp usually have.  They were medium-sized, and plentiful.  You could tell they had not been frozen, and the other ingredients in the sauce complemented their flavor without overpowering it.  The spicyness was perfect!!! The bubble teas were great.  Pretty much the same as a bubble tea from Argyle Street or Joy Yee, and reasonably priced.

The story: I have ordered Thai take out here twice, so I can't comment on the service or the Sushi. The first time I got Pad Thai and Spring Rolls- you know, pretty standard, a good benchmark.  The Pad Thai was hot and fresh, but super bland.  But additionally, they gave me a pretty large portion, and I'm always a fan of stretching leftovers for more than a day.  And I enjoyed the spring roll, so I figured I'd give them the benefit of the doubt. Second time, I got Pad Seew and Crab Rangoon.  At my favorite Thai places, the Pad Seew is in a rich brown sauce.  Here, it's the same color as the Pad Thai.  Light orange.  And it's just as bland, possibly more so.  And, as Laura B commented, the noodles were kind of mushy.  But Crab Ragoon was slightly better than average and I ate that with great joy in my heart.

Noodle Zone dropped a few balls on our take out order last night. (1) Wrong item included, followed by less than helpful attitude. Had ordered a tofu satay, got there and saw chicken satay on my receipt.  The girl told me I said chicken.  Thing is, I don't eat chicken, so there's no chance I said chicken.  Then she asked if I would wait 5 - 10 minutes for them to swap it out.  Sure, why not?  I've just got my hazards on in a no parking zone and we'll let the rest of the order cool off a bit while you fix that mistake.  They did take it off the bill at my request, but appeared a bit put off by my asking for that.  And it's not like I took the chicken with me.   (2) Requested preparation not done right. I had asked if it was possible to hold the mushrooms on the Thai pepper steak dish.   Was told that wouldn't be a problem.  Got home with a dish that had about 12 big honkin' mushrooms in it.   Nuisance more than anything else, but it's the principle of the thing.   (3) Bland food. The pepper steak was really flavorless.  Just didn't stand out in any kind of way.   Hopefully it was just one  bad night, but nonetheless, now that we're much closer to Ben's, I don't really see why I'd go back to Noodle Zone for Thai take out again after this disappointment.

If you're itching for Thai food and you don't want to go out of the neighborhood, go here but realize it's not going to be anything outstanding.  There is another Thai restaurant in Edgewater called Indie Cafe that definitely has better tasting Thai food.",0.9381,0.776,0.205,0.018,0.6488095238095237

2005-08-02,4.0,This is a very cute thai restaurant with great food for cheap. The service is great here. We celebrated a friend's birthday here and we brought in a slightly larger group. The staff accomadated us with no problem and even gave the birthday girl a gift. I would recommend this place to anyone. The ambiance is cheerful and the food is tasty. I'd recommend the Drunken Noodles.,0.9709,0.623,0.319,0.059,0.7785714285714286

Casual place, prices don't go above $9 or so for thai food, but higher for sushi.",0.5994,0.859,0.141,0.0,0.6190476190476192
