2016-05-15,5.0,"My girlfriend and I recently had dinner at Vivo on a Saturday evening to celebrate my birthday. We were visiting Chicago from out of town. Our first impression upon walking into the restaurant was how tasteful and inviting the decor was. The exposed brick and wood beams along with the hardwood flooring and dim lighting give the restaurant a warm, rustic feel to it. Fortunately we had a reservation and were shown to our table right away. Our server was very knowledgeable and helpful with the various wines on the list and I chose a glass of Riesling while my girlfriend went with the Moscato. As we had worked up a healthy appetite walking around the city all day we also immediately ordered the prosciutto and cheese plate as our appetizer. It arrived quickly along with some bread. There were two tasty spreads that came with the cheese plate, one tomato based and the other was mango flavored. The appetizer was just the right sized serving for the two of us. As for the main courses that followed, I thoroughly enjoyed the veal cutlet which was cooked absolutely perfectly and with just the right amount of seasoning. My girlfriend selected the Tagliatelle and enjoyed both the shrimp and fresh pasta. For dessert we elected to share a piece of cheesecake. The restaurant added a birthday candle to the top of the cheesecake and kindly omitted the cheesecake from the final bill as a birthday present. My girlfriend commented that the cheesecake was absolutely delicious but also not as heavy and filling as some cheesecakes can be which we agreed was a real plus. We can't say enough positive words about Vivo.

2016-04-20,1.0,"Let it be known, I signed up for a yelp account just to write this review. Because for the most part, if any place simply involves food- I love it. My boyfriend and I were celebrating his 30th birthday and we chose Vivo's famous Table 70 as the spot to celebrate. Romantic, prixe fixe menu, intimate, special, etc. All things we love. We were so excited to go to Chicago's ""Most Romantic Table"" on such a special occasion. Ugh heartbreak. Well, the physical table + the setting certainly does not disappoint. The food- really good. Unfortunately, there's the service. Or lack thereof. When we did have the waitstaff's attention- it was as if we were a bother to them. Our water glasses stayed empty from right after the bread plate all the way until the check came. Which, to point out, I had to get up, walk down the stairs to find someone, and ask for the check 45 minutes after the dessert came because no one had come to check on us. We would have loved to order a second bottle of wine to have with our main course and dessert, but unfortunately the runner's basically dropped the dishes off and sprinted away. By the time our actual waiter came to check on us (which was only 3 times over the course of a 3 hour meal- to say hello, take our order, then drop off the check)- we were already done with the entire dinner and the dreams of a second bottle of wine were crushed. My salmon was extremely undercooked but again, no one could be bothered to come ask how our meal was, so after sitting, staring out over the restaurant waiting to catch ANYONE'S attention, I finally just said eff it, and split the chicken marsala dish my boyfriend ordered (which was fabulous, btw).  There's one thing to be said about having privacy at a table like that, but it's a totally separate issue when you're just straight up forgotten about, and when you do actually have someone's attention- they can't get away fast enough and they make you feel like the world's biggest inconvenience. I get it- we were a little secluded. BUT COME ON it's only an extra 5 stairs. A couple ""how is everything tasting?"" or ""can I get you guys anything to drink?"" checkpoints would have gone a long way. And knowing that people usually request that table for special occasions- the staff should be a little more in-tune.

2016-02-01,3.0,"My wife and I had a weekend getaway to Chicago planned this past weekend, January 29-31, so I called on the Tuesday before we arrived to see if the famous Table 70 was available.  Miraculously, the 9:45pm seating was available, so we booked it.  I asked them to call if the previous reservation cancelled so that we could slide into that spot to avoid eating dinner really late.  At about 7:55pm, shortly after we made it into town and checked into our hotel, we received a call from Vivo, in which the hostess informed us we could come in at any time because the reservation ahead of us cancelled.  We got ready, hailed a cab, and made it to the restaurant by 9pm, elated that we didn't have to wait until almost 10pm to start eating.   The evening took a turn for the worse as soon as we walked in the door and saw that someone was sitting at Table 70 enjoying a meal.  The hostess said in a half-joking tone, ""I gave away your table...just joking...well, kind of.  We were running behind, and a party asked if they could sit there, so we let them.  But they'll be done around 9:30.""  I replied, ""You should have called us and let us know so that we wouldn't have to wait around here at the restaurant.""   She arrogantly said, ""Sorry.  It will be worth your wait.  You can go have drinks at the bar until they're gone.""   At this point we were annoyed, but not enough to change plans.  We figured we would wait it out at the bar, and still be seated 15 minutes before our original reservation.  We also both agreed that it wouldn't have been as big of a deal if the hostess had not been so snotty about it.  So, we sat at the bar, I ordered an old fashioned, and we enjoyed watching the bar tenders and all of the people at the bar (we like people-watching).  Soon 9:45pm rolled around and the party was still going strong up at Table 70.  I asked the bar tender to send over the manager so we could discuss the situation.  The bar tender introduced himself to us as Murph, and explained that he was one of the managers.  He apologized, told us the drinks at the bar were on him, he would send up champagne when we finally got up to our table, and our first round of drinks at our table were on the house as well.  If we were really big drinkers, this would have been a great deal...but we're not really.  The floor manager, a female whose name I didn't catch, came and apologized, though she seemed half-hearted about the apology and didn't seem to genuinely care like Murph did.  At about 10:00pm, I noticed Murph talking to the server at Table 70, and it seemed she was frustrated that the party wasn't leaving even after she had informed them of the next reservation.  Murph climbed the stairs and took care of it, and within five minutes we were seated.   True to his word, Murph sent up champagne, and comped us our drink at the bar and our glasses of wine we had at the table.  Our server was absolutely wonderful, and it's obvious that Murph actually did what he could to take good care of us.  The snotty hostess and the floor manager who didn't seem to really own up to the mistake, however, left a sour taste in our mouths. Now onto the food...the food was fantastic!  It was a five course prixe fixe menu, and it did not disappoint.  I won't go into all of the detail because my understanding is that the menu at Table 70 changes based on the chef's choices for the evening.  I will say that the gniocchi and whatever kind of ravioli they served was delicious, and my wife loved her grilled salmon entree.  I felt the filet mignon was one of the best I've ever had.  I'd say the weak point of the meal was dessert, but that's probably more because of OUR tastes than the taste of the food.  Dessert was chocolate cake and then some type of gelato.  The gelato was really good, but the chocolate cake was just chocolate cake...not our thing.  So, overall experience was just a three, food was probably 4.5, service was sort of a split personality of a 2 (for the hostess and floor manager) and a 5 (for Murph and our server).  Maybe next time (if there is a next time) there won't be the big debacle that we faced...of course then our bill would be an extra 60 bucks for the drinks!",0.9984,0.838,0.136,0.026,0.47548076923076926

The food was great and the Food & Beverage minimum was one of the lowest I found in the city!  My guests absolutely raved about the Mushroom/Gorgonzola bruschetta & the Sausage & Peppers appetizer. The thing that made this so great to have a rehearsal dinner here was that my venue would not allow us to hold ceremony rehearsals in our actually space and this space was big enough that we just held our rehearsal here.  Meaghan was helpful to work with and allowed us to come in early without any extra cost.

I had looked on yelp to see what dishes were recommended and that kept popping up- I am so glad it did. Some of the best gnocchi ever, and a really good sized portion which I feel is rare for gnocchi. We also got the Chicken Milanese.

Obviously they wanted us in and out quickly on a sat night. Given the prices ( least expensive glass of white wine is $13)I consider this unattractive. Food is ok to very good.

This place discovered WL before the neighborhood knew it's name or what was to become. With a high list following; what they call Table 70 is a single second story table that seats 4 & comes with privacy bell to reach the waiter when needed usually reserved for 3 weeks in advance.  Now let's talk food. Going back to the basics of simplicity and freshness, ViVo over delivers. Unlike many Chicago restaurants trying to one up each other on ingredients that the norm needs to google to figure out. ViVo keeps their food delicious and straight to the point down to the little things as powdered parmesan & a juicy lemon garnish. The staff is like family, you can tell by their demeanor towards one another & it's refreshing to witness.  Overall, ViVo gives you that dinner at home cooked by a chef and hosted by the best 'feel' that keep you coming back for the next invite.",0.9674,0.89,0.11,0.0,0.34372260015117156

2015-04-01,5.0,"This review is long overdue. My wife and I were in Chicago a few weeks ago for business and our trip coincided with her birthday. I was looking for some place very unique and special to celebrate it. During an internet search, I was lucky to come across Vivo and their famous table 70. I called and spoke to a very professional and friendly young lady by the name of Sterling (General Manager). She answered all of my questions, suggested an excellent touch in a personalized menu and booked us for a Saturday seating.  The same friendly voice was there to greet us when we arrived. Sterling gave us a wonderful welcome and wished my wife Happy Birthday. We were escorted through a beautiful dining area, past a very unique bar, to the stairway that led to our private table. An original elevator shaft that had been renovated and turned into a single, second floor private table. The view of this setting was grand, (see photo). It was exactly what I'd hoped it would be.  We were seated and soon after met Mike, our waiter. He was outgoing, upbeat and very helpful. He went above and beyond to take care of us. He achieved the perfect balance between being there for as long as we needed him and gone long enough for us to have plenty of alone time. I am not that familiar with Italian wines; Mike was very knowledgeable and helpful. We chose a wonderful wine that complimented the meal greatly. The five course meal was excellent. Our only regret was that we couldn't finish the last two courses. I apologized to the chef on the way out. We ate so little of our entrees that it would appear we didn't enjoy it, which was absolutely not the case.  My biggest surprise was how little this evening cost. I would have easily expected to pay twice as much for this experience. This was the perfect evening and I definitely scored major points for this selection. When back in Chicago we will definitely dine here again and will ask for Mike. We will probably ask for table 70. The main dining room would be a great place to dine but I'm afraid we've been spoiled.  Thanks Sterling, thanks Mike, thanks Vivo!",0.9946,0.808,0.176,0.016,0.5363868003341685

The dining experience was absolutely awful on a special occasion entirely due to the appalling level of service and hospitality. Our waitress was rarely able to be found and it took 20-25min before she even approached our table to take orders. She was the nice-but-not-friendly type of waitress, doing her job, nothing more (basic expectation. Can't complain I guess, I'll take that). When we informed the manager, Sterling, the service was lacking and slow throughout she decided to counter with a listing of times that each part of the service got done. When the bill came, we asked for split checks and she balked at first before giving me instructions to do the work of the splitting! She even offered me her calculator! Very disrespectful but I obliged anyway because she said that would be ""the easiest and fastest way"" to take care of a bill and we were already running late because of the slow service. After I followed her instructions to the very letter and confirmed with her, she herself managed to screw up the charges. Sterling refused to apologize about the whole thing and continued to be argumentative and was not receptive. The shining light of the night was the hostess whose level of service was absolutely impeccable! It stood out in stark contrast to the way the manager handled us, which is just shameful. Sterling killed what could've otherwise been a great experience. She was argumentative, disrespectful, could-do-no-wrong attitude, and unapologetic.  Food was not the issue. It was nothing mind-blowing, but it was good. All in all, it just seemed to us that service was lacking because the manager and waitress knew they would charge us the mandatory 20% gratuity for our party anyway.

It started with the hostess being distracted and rude when greeting us. We arrived 5 minutes early for our 7:30 reservation on a Saturday night. The other members of our party were waiting for us at the bar. 20 minutes later the hostess came to apologize for the wait and said they would like to buy us a round of drinks to thank us for our patience. Just then a table opened up which she said we could have. She then asked if we had closed our bar tab. I reminded her that she had just offered to buy us a round of drinks since we had to wait 20 min for a table even with a reservation. She said ""well that's when we thought you were going to have to wait longer."" um, wrong answer. Listen, I have worked in restaurants - I totally get that sometimes tables just sit and there's nothing you can do and that is frustrating on a Saturday night. But it is the restaurant's JOB to accommodate the waiting party and make them feel appreciated for being patient & we did not feel that at all. The waitress (a cute girl with several arm tattoos) was super friendly and knowledgeable - not overly attentive, but around whenever we had a question. (best part of the night) The food runners literally shoved our entrees down in front of us while we were only 1/2 way through appetizers and salads - didn't event look at us to see the confusion on our faces. Entrees were so disappointing - this place used to be one of my favorite Italian places in all of Chicago (which is a bold statement in this city). The ravioli filling was really bland and over powered by the sauce. The penne was dry - not enough sauce (it has been my fave dish there for years.)

Luckily, Vivo was able to accommodate our party of 6 at last minute. It is for this reason (and their wonderful olive oil and bread) that I give them two stars.  I really wanted to like this place. Unfortunately, the service was incredibly unprofessional. After placing my order with the rest of my table, the runner brought out a significantly more expensive dish that I had not ordered.

By the time my friends were finishing their meals, I motioned for the waitress to come over to the table. I asked her if she knew when my dish would be ready.

Others in my party enjoyed their food more than I did so I'm willing to give Vivo the benefit of the doubt on that one.  However, the service was something else. It was early on a Sunday evening, and there were maybe 4 other tables occupied. They can hardly blame the dinner rush. And yet, the waiter did not know the specials, messed up the orders (brought out one dish of the 5 completely wrong, and another dish after everyone else was done eating), and when we inquired when they began to charge for bread - beware that when they ask you if you want bread service, they're going to charge you $2 despite the food prices holding steady - the waitress curtly chirped ""we're just trying to break even!"" as though she wasn't about to charge us $25 for a bowl of pasta. They kept sending over different servers to ""deal with"" us, which annoyed me more because we couldn't simply work out the miscommunication - if there was one - with the person who had taken our orders. At one point we asked the ""break even"" lady whether the dish that hadn't been delivered was in progress (we'd been waiting quite awhile) and she said ""It's cooking."" SUPER helpful, thanks. At the end of the night, after we paid the check and were getting up from the table to leave, they shoved a piece of tirimisu on the table with 5 spoons, presumably to make up for the disappointing evening (sidenote: it was tasty).  I would've been appalled if I got this service in any restaurant, but for the prices you're paying at Vivo, you should at least be able to expect them to confirm your order if they're confused, rather than guess, and at the very least stop acting like they are doing you some sort of favor by serving you overpriced food with snotty attitudes.

2013-04-09,2.0,"#Chicago's #VIvo was a bit of a disappointment for me.  I went specifically for the gnocchi and to try what many Chicagoans claim is the best chocolate cake on the street. The atmosphere was quaint and welcoming, but the restaurant was poorly lit- nice for your romantic rencontre, but terrible for menu reading. I could barely see my plate (see pictures). We were immediately offered a wine list and water options.  We went with bottled flat water and an Italian chardonnay.  The wine was fabulous and we looked forward to pairing it with our meal.   For our shared appetizers, we got the calamari on a salad bed and the bruschetta.  The latter was full of flavour, seasoned with gorgonzola and sun-dried tomatoes, but the calamari was sour and its accompanying insalate had an acidic dressing.  The calamari also came with a spicy tomato puree, but even this garnish could not save that dish.  For our entrees, I had the anticipated black truffle infused gnocchi and my friend went with the Mahi Mahi special. Both plates failed to meet our expectations.  The gnocchi gratinati was in fact parmesan crusted but the different flavours didn't come together.  I asked for a grilled chicken breast and that was well seasoned, but the actual potato pasta and sauce, while tender and warm, were not memorable.  This can't be the best gnocchi in town! My friend also disliked her $33 fish entree, finding the fish extremely bland.  Even the green beans weren't blanched properly and she spent more time salting and peppering her plate than eating its content.  Finally we asked for our plates to be wrapped to-go and decided to share the Crostata di Cioccolata con Nocciole. The dessert's name alone was promising- a double chocolate cake with ganache frosting and white chocolate gelato couldn't go wrong. But this too fell flat. The gelato was more white than chocolate (again, flavourless) and the chocolate cake was more icing than cake. This also got a doggy bag. Three courses and $140 later, our party was over and we were ready to put our vivo experiment behind. We really wanted to love this place, especially as it is a walk away from where my friend resides, but we won't be going back.  I RECOMMEND: Going in strictly to explore the vast wine list. EXTRA TIP: The panna (bread) that is served at the beginning of the meal is not complimentary. It is $5 and $3 for refills yet is not brought upon request.

The atmosphere is nice, dimly lit with brick walls and rustic decor.   Our waitress was very personable.  I inquired about the possibility of getting an apertivo that wasn't on their menu.  She was very nice and quickly suggested an acceptable substitute.  The drink was perfect way to start - aperol, citron vodka, prosecco, and bit of orange peel.  The menu has a very nice selection of starters, salads, pastas, and entrees.  We decided to split a caprese salad and the spaghetti  frutti di mare. They were both exceptionally good! The buffalo mozzarella was so creamy and delicious, the tomatoes were so flavorful.  This is not a typical caprese salad.  The spaghetti frutti di mare was perfectly prepared and seasoned.  For two hungry women splitting these two dishes were perfect.   I found it to be very reasonably priced for the items we selected and the quality and quantity was perfect!   To top it off, I inquired where we should go to have an after dinner drink and our waitress recommended Maude's Liqour Bar next door.  That was a winner too!",0.994,0.803,0.197,0.0,0.6405383022774326

2012-12-06,4.0,"Hiding right in plain sight. That's the impression Vivo left on me. After eight years of living in Chicago and coming to this stretch of Randolph Street, I'd never paid any attention to this pleasant Italian eatery and that was my mistake (for sure). To begin with, Vivo has an ambiance that's well suited to a casual night with friends, a special night with a special lady friend or a night of popped collars, tight jeans and Pumas. being that it helped anchor Randolph long before the Restaurant Row revolution, one has to give credit to the old girl for keeping up with the times and remaining relevant.  Forgoing the scene of downstairs and eschewing the nooks (those are for lovers), my group took up a good chunk of the upstairs space and settled in for an evening of laughing, gossip, toasts, and new beginnings. In eight years, much had changed with our group: people had moved away, people had moved back, folks had gotten married, folks had gotten pregnant, folks had bought real, grownup houses... and now one was about to leave this comfortable nest and fly into the unknown. This would require food and drink. Starting in with some delicious glasses of PG, I surveyed the menu and went about navigating my way to an Italian food baby. Two of us (well, three) could play this pregnancy game. I started with a Fantasia Salad. Rather than quacking at me with 'Yeah yeah yeahs' about 'hood boys' (even though that track is pretty dope), this Fantasia was full of pear, walnuts, gorgonzola, and tomatoes. Pears, walnuts and stinky cheese are always a good combo. Balsamic, watercress and tomato simply round out what's already a good base. More wine. My entree was a no-brainer. The Linguine alla Polpa di Granchio had my name all over it. Black linguine served up with a generous amount of crab and onion and tossed in a peperoncini sauce would have a very hard time not being delicious. This was delicious. The kick from the sauce complemented the buttery creaminess of the crab and I could eat onion in just about anything (so that's why I'm single). The novelty of black noodles just made the dish more fun. More wine. And since no Italian meal is complete without dessert (and I was the man of the evening), I ordered a Crostata di Cioccolata con Nocciole. What the h double hockey sticks is that? Heaven. It's heaven. If that's not descriptive enough, how does Double chocolate cake with ganache frosting and white chocolate gelato sound? The best part of the dessert was having it all to myself! I'm an only child and I have a wicked sweet tooth. As a farewell gesture, my friends allowed me the peace of devouring this enormously chocolately decadence all to myself -- and no one made a move on it. That's love, people. Thanks for the sendoff.

I went to the bathroom and their soap dispenser was broken, so they had lifted off the top of the soap dispenser so that you would have to scoop out you own liquid soap from the soap dispenser/vat of soap. This was just gross. Everyone who goes to the bathroom then sticks their hand in this vat of liquid soap. I informed two ladies who worked at the restaurant about this, and both gave identical bitchy responses. They explained that they opened the top of the soap dispenser, as if this was a brilliant idea. When I explained why this was gross, they said that they didn't know what else they could really do. I suggested going to Walgreen's and getting a pump soap for the night (or they could go to Target and get a nice soap dispenser and pour the liquid soap in there.)

I expected a spot with those all too common large family style antipasti platters drowned in calamari and lemon, fried eggplant and the same ol same.  Not so.

2012-01-22,2.0,"First, let me start by saying--I am a Vivo fan. I have been to this restaurant many times over the years. I've hosted a party in the party room, and have had  friends host parties here and have been doing so for almost 10 years.   So for my birthday, I decided I wanted Italian this year.  I'd called early in the week to make a reservation for a party of 15 for the night of my birthday (which was last Friday).  I'd also contracted a party bus to ensure that everyone would arrive promptly.    I got  a call early Friday to confirm. Well, Friday just happened to be the day of a small Chicago blizzard.  So, I got a second call later in the evening from Vivo to confirm again, as they told me they were getting a lot of cancellations.  Well, there will be no cancelling from me! Myself and my friends will be there. In fact, we may even have an extra person!  Simple enough. My friends and I struggled but all made it downtown to a hotel room I'd rented for the weekend where the bus would pick us up to take us to dinner.  We were relieved and excited to get to dinner at Vivo.  On the bus, we decided to do a little toast. Everyone had a small cup where we toasted and got ready for a great night.  The bus ride took about 5 minutes, and next thing we knew, we were at the restaurant.  I was the last to arrive into the restaurant but by the time I got through the door, two of my guests were huddled in the hallway.  I was told that they were scolded for bringing in their cups from the toast,  so they were finishing them to throw them away.  Totally understandable.  There is no way cups from the toast should have been brought into the restaurant. No problem.  Sorry, Vivo!   We get inside, and I realize that they do not have a table large enough to accommodate all of my guest.  That actually would be fine except that 12 of us arrived together with 3 more coming on their own.  The table was set up for 8 people.  We squeezed in 2 chairs to seat 10 people.  But, that left 2 people without a place to sit.  With all of the shuffling and confusion going on as we tried to figure out how to be able to sit together, there was a young lady pouring water.  When she got to me, she paused, looked down at the other end of the table, rolled her eyes and sighed.  I said to a friend ""wow, she has an attitude"".  She looked at me and said ""What?""  So, I told her  ""You have an attitude, and it's unnecessary.""   At that point, she proceeded to tell me with the nastiest tone and attitude ever how she didn't even say anything.  We went back and forth as I tried to explain to her that  rolling your eyes, sighing and then asking me ""what"" I'd said to someone else is a clear indication that you're not having a good day.  She decides to call over someone named Diego who apologized on her behalf and was really kind.  He clearly is on hand to help deal with the nasty attitudes of the two staff who were not having a good night.  Diego asked her to apologize (she refused).   It was clear that HE valued customer service and satisfaction while she and her short male co-worker with black rimmed glasses stood back ""whispering"" to each other that we were all ""drunk"".   At that point, with the seating fiasco, the nasty attitude, hostility and clear snobbery by two of the hosts,  I was confident that I wouldn't be able to eat anything. I didn't feel welcomed at all and was afraid that the remaining service or food wouldn't be what I have come to expect from Vivo.  I let one person in my party know that I wanted them to eat but I couldn't.  They then  collectively decided that we had to leave because it wouldn't be a good night if we didn't start off with good food.  So, we left.  I was disappointed because not only did I want and plan to eat Italian,  I also wanted to support the restaurant.  It was pretty empty as a result of the blizzard, and surely the $600-700 we would spend should have been welcomed.  Nevertheless, we received an extreme welcome, great food and AMAZING service right next door at Dragonfly.   I only wish that Vivo would have thought to seat us in the party room (since it was empty and we would have been together and out of the way of the guests downstairs with such a big party of girls).  Or, that the nicer of the staff who kept apologizing for the two rude persons would have been the only ones at work that night.  As the result of those 2 employees at Vivo that night, my dream of Italian birthday dinner did not come true.",0.995,0.769,0.143,0.088,0.5021825396825397

2011-10-16,1.0,"**RUINED BIRTHDAY - PLEASE READ** For those that don't know, Vivo has a special table set in a converted elevator shaft - private, very romantic, and ideal for special occasions. I called Vivo in early August to reserve it for my boyfriend and I this weekend, October 15th, to celebrate his birthday. I was told in complete confidence that the table would be ours. I called Vivo on October 8th to confirm the reservation and to make sure we'd get the table. I was again told yes, for sure.  We arrived at Vivo ten minutes ahead of our reservation time and the elevator shaft had just been seated with a party of 6.  I was told that my request for that table ""must have been overlooked"". When I informed the hostess that the only reason I had made the reservation was so we could sit there and that I expected to be compensated for their mistake, I received an attitude-ridden ""I'm sorry."" We were then handed a glass of champagne each. Being that it was 8pm on a Saturday night, I knew the chances of not having to wait at least an hour anywhere decent on Randolph were slim, so we really had no choice but to stay.  The hostess sat us at a table that was no more than 5 inches away from the tables on either side of us. Calling it communal seating would not be a large exaggeration. Anytime I reached down to get something out of my purse, my head brushed the lap of the man sitting next to me. Extremely uncomfortable. After being seated, we waited 20 minutes to be acknowledged by the waiter. We received no apology for this. Throughout the meal, the 2 couples sitting to my right became increasingly more intoxicated to the point of being downright obnoxious. Being so close to them, there was really no way of escaping their rudeness. Things escalated between their table and ours and we ended up not even ordering dessert as planned because we wanted to leave so badly. That concluded my boyfriend's birthday dinner. The only things we were comped were the champagne at the beginning and my cappucino at the end. It was by far the worst dining experience either of us has ever had.  I'm no where near snobby when it comes to restaurants - bring me good food in an efficient amount of time and I'm happy.

FULL DISCLOSURE:  I was only there for lunch.   It's possible their dinner is amazing.   I wouldn't know. The reviews I've read of Vivo, both on Yelp and elsewhere, were very mixed.   And I admit I would never had walked over for lunch if it weren't for the Groupon Now deal:  $10 for $20 (with a $5 discount because I had previously bought another Groupon).   For a $5 lunch, anything is worth a try. I had the $15 lunch special, which includes a soup or salad, and any pasta or panini.    I had their mixed greens salad, which was kinda of uninteresting, though the vegetables were extremely fresh (especially the tomatoes).   For my main course, I had a rigatoni pasta dish with sundried tomatoes and sausage.    Again, the ingredients were top notch.  But there was nothing special about the pasta either. But I did leave feeling full and satisfied.    So if you have a Groupon deal, Vivo is worth a visit.    If not, save your money and get better elsewhere.   Chicago has many wonderful choices for Italian.",0.9677,0.785,0.158,0.057,0.5763278388278389

Veal or Chicken parmesan is one of the most traditional american-italian cuisines and is very hard to f**** up, yet these guys did a sensational job of just that.  Not to mention, my fiance got the special ravioli and their red sauce was incredibly spicy.  You could barely taste the cheese flavors in the pasta.  The only good food was the free bread and olive oil, as well as the free olives.",0.864,0.808,0.114,0.078,0.5478980654761904

The service was good overall.  Our server was very knowledgeable and had a chill personality.  He also made good recommendations. Now for the food.... We began with two wonderful glasses of Chardonnay.   The fresh bread on the table was delicious and accompanied by a small plate of olive oil, crushed red pepper, basil, and parmesan cheese.   So good!   For appetizers, we shared a bowl of cream of asparagus soup, a half order of the Bruschetta, and the Carpaccio Tricolore.  The soup was wonderfully creamy with a fresh flavor.  The Bruschetta contained a generous amount of tomatoes, shallots, and basil.  The Carpaccio was perfectly accented by arugula, shaved parmesan, and capers.   For our entrees, we had the lamb special and the Gnocchi Gratina.  Both of our meals were excellent!  The lamp was perfectly cooked to med-rare and was drizzled in a cherry glaze reduction. The gnocchi were covered with a parmesan and truffle cream sauce.  I would get them again in a second!

Oh, but don't worry, you will still be paying as though you are in a hip, semi-fine-dining establishment. Just try to be understanding when they send you bland pasta dishes, microwaved Betty Crocker desserts, and poorly grown and slightly grey-colored fruits. Started off strong, but really disappointing. Personally, I could do without the obnoxious hipster beats you play lightly on the sounds system, and the massive decorative collection of wine bottles. Give me some quality dishes instead.

The server was on the slow side in terms of getting our orders straightened out and refilling water and wine. The food, itself, was meh.   To start, the arugula salad was over salted. I sent mine back and requested more bread instead. They came back with another salad, which I said I didn't want. After I rejected the 2nd salad, they put it in a box for me as if I really wanted to stick it in the car while we partied, stick in the fridge in the wee hours, and dive in the next day.  The carpaccio was good, and they managed not to over salt the arugula sitting atop the beef.  We split the penne con rapini. The spicy chicken sausage and noodles were decent, but they got crazy again with the Morton's salt cylinder when it came to the broccoli and spinach.  We had to push away the salty produce and order a side of marinara to improve the super dry dish. My friend raved about Vivo and was bummed at the service/food that night. Everyone has a bad night here and there.

I really wanted more out of the food and menu.  It was a pleasant atmosphere and the service was pleasant.  Overall the food was unimpressive, they have a male-female shared bathroom that I didn't care for, and a serious lack of parking.  With so many other better options to choose from on this same street, I probably won't return.",0.886,0.786,0.136,0.078,0.5058783321941217

2010-11-01,3.0,"It's been absolute ages since I've eaten at Vivo; it's hard to believe it's been open for nearly twenty years. To be honest, I kind of thought that the whole Randolph Street dining scene was kind of passé, but with the opening of ""Girl and Goat,"" it's enjoyed quite a revival.  My best beau and I had theater tickets Saturday night in the West Loop and needed to find a spot for dinner beforehand. We had purchased a Groupon for Vivo some months back so last Saturday was a perfect time to use it.  We arrived on the early side, just after 6, so it felt a little like senior-citizen hour, but there was already a few tables that were well into their dinner. I assume that they were on their way to a game at the UC because I can't imagine eating dinner so early unless that was your destination.  As it was the night before Halloween (and the night everyone was celebrating it), most of the staff was in costume, so that automatically gave the place a fun, laid-back vibe. We were seated at a deuce along the wall in the back and were able to check out the whole scene.  We each started with a glass of Sangiovese and ordered carpaccio and eggplant for appetizers. The eggplant was quite good; it was lightly breaded and topped with tomato sauce and melted provolone. I thought it could have used some more sauce, but overall it was tasty and a generous portion. It would be the ideal entrée size for a smaller appetite.  The carpaccio was really good and was adorned with shaved parmesan and capers, served alongside mixed greens. We both enjoyed it as evidenced by the plate practically being licked clean.  The server went over specials which made our main-course decisions that much harder. The smell of roasted fish filled the air so we toyed with the idea of getting that until we heard about the pumpkin risotto special they were serving. And the fact that the risotto was served in a hollowed-out pumpkin made it too irresistible to pass up.  In addition to the risotto, we also ordered the gnocchi gratinati, which was gnocchi in a parmesan cream sauce with truffle essence. Our main dishes arrived and the risotto came topped with huge sea scallops and big chunks of pumpkin. I don't care for scallops but I did try the risotto and it was good, but not very creamy.  The gnocchi had been put under the broiler as the sauce was somewhat ""bruléed"" on top. The gnocchi was perfectly al-dente, and even though the sauce was rich, it was pretty bland, and I detected very little of the truffle essence, which was what prompted me to order this in the first place.  We decided to skip dessert since nothing seemed splurgeworthy, so we just ordered a double espresso and cappuccino.  Service was fine; the food was good; the atmosphere was nice; it's just that nothing was remarkable or stood out. I'm glad I revisited Vivo, but I'm grateful that we had the Groupon or we might have felt a little overcharged.

This dish is 5-star worthy, bursting with a succulent truffle flavor. Yum! The bruschetta was also above average. My fiance had the rigatoni alla buttera which he gave 3.5 stars and equated it to an upscale Bertolli dish.   The service was very good, and our water was always refilled in a timely manner.

After checking the website and reading some reviews, I thought, well, let's find out why they want to draw in some diners and so I purchased the groupon which promised $60 worth of grub for $30. Arriving at Vivo I thought - heck, they must have some serious issues if they offer they Groupon as the place itself is amazing. Great location right on Randolph, exposed brick, the industrial look - great atmosphere. . And the place was buzzing , too. Really busy, loud, nice vibe.

Bruschetta for starters, overloaded tomato bread , bit difficult to eat, but not too bad for , err, starters.  Now, moving on to the Pasta. Well, it is overpriced. Pasta for $15 ? Please , no Pasta is worth spending that. And to add insult to injury , unfortunately , this Pasta was even overcooked, dry, and , more or less flavorless. Shame really. Quick rush to the (according to the waitress) homemade Tiramisu (as always (check previous reviews) I have to include that) Fresh, light, quite tasty, even though there was some chocolate sauce on top and a strawberry and cream on the side. Leave that away as less is more in this case. Not too bad - basically the highlight of the meal. So why do they need a Groupon ?    The answer: This place is great.

2010-04-21,4.0,"This spot for discriminating diners has made a home for itself in the rejuvenated market district. Snuggled among the refurbished warehouses and funky eateries along West Randolph Street, Vivo offers one of the most romantic tables in the city. An iron staircase leads half a story up to the only table in the converted elevator shaft, where such notables as Robert Redford and Axl Rose have dined and where Richard Gere proposed to Cindy Crawford. It appears imposing as the trek up the stairs begins to reveal an iron candelabra that illuminates the seemingly limitless ceiling and bounces shadows against the exposed brick. The long table - which can seat up to six comfortably - appears to expand into a large wrought iron mirror that hangs on the far wall. Velvet drapes frame the intense mini spotlight that hangs just above the entrance to the best see-and-be-seen table in the city. And as it is with all prime romantic spots in the city, the table has been host to several hundred engagements ... and only two of the intended have declined. An attentive and timely wait staff helps make for an unintimidating experience. The chef lends sincerity to the Southern Italian fare, which includes veal medallion, bathed in a white wine mushroom sauce and served with rosemary potatoes, and grilled salmon served on a bed of sautéed spinach. Other notables include risotto and rigatoni alla butera, a spicy dish served with sun-dried tomatoes and goat cheese. The decent wine list is a welcome change for the purist, as it features more than 100 wines - none of them Californias and chiefly Italian, including selections such as 1993 Brunello di Montalcino, 1995 Pomino Rosso and 1995 Sacrisassi Rosso. Bruschetta at an Italian ristorante is like sauerbraten at a bierstube, but Vivo offers a memorable dish that is served with chunks of fresh tomatoes spilling onto the plate over bread that is grilled with the garlic right on the toast. There is no time limit on the table, so if you're enjoying the semi-celebrity status in the rather private loft, you and yours don't have to leave - at least until closing time.

It is low lighting, stacked wine bottles along the exposed brick walls, and italian style close quarters seating arrangement, which some may not enjoy, offers a particular intimacy that is truly unique. SERVICE: The service has always been exceptional. Of the many times we visit, we are always sure to request service from ""Eric"". He offers an expertise with each dish that is unmatchable, and is always honest with recommendations. In addition to being very attentive to his tables, he has an ability to flow with the restaurant culture very well. We rarely request a server at a restaurant, however, Eric is perhaps the best we have ever encountered, and has made every evening at Vivo exceptionally pleasant. He is truly brilliant. FOOD The food is as always fantastic. The bread and oil is to die for. We recommend the Kalamari to begin. Pasta dish portions are quite large, and very filling. For something basic, you can never go wrong with the Spagetti Pomodoro. However, just about every other pasta dish has proven to be outstanding. The Spagetti alla Vongole has been a favorite as well.

I had read elsewhere about the quiet table which several people have mentioned here as the table in the elevator shaft. Thinking back to my bill, no charge for the request. The staff there was very helpful, I had had a dozen pink roses delivered to be set on the table as well as two flutes of prosecco.  When we got to Vivo, and walked around and up to the table, Tracy knew something was up... but I was able to play it cool, no clues through dinner, dessert and she began to think it wasn't going to happen.  Oh, I should talk about the food and service too. Our waitress was great, she knew what my plans were as did the host staff, the waitress tried to give us our privacy while also serving us, not an easy balance with the elevated table. Our food was as expected... I tried to get Tracy to order more than her favorite of spaghetti and red sauce... but could get it done, so I ordered one of the many specials of a bone-in rib eye, not what I'd normally order while out for Italian, but I knew the enormity of the night :)! Hers was very very good and a very large portion, mine was done right, very good flavor, the roasted potatoes were great as well. If you want to compare, I might say the food is as good or better than Maggiano's, the prices comparable but the ambiance is much more intimate  and service is much better.  So we were finally done, I had paid the bill and Tracy thought. Well, just a great ""Date Night"" As I stepped down the first two steps of the stairs, I paused and said, one more thing and dropped down on one knee and popped the question. I was nervous and shaking... but managed through... She said Yes! I figured at this point the whole restaurant goers below would be watching...but not a peep from everyone below, that's how private that room can be... as we came down the staff congratulated us...

The first time I went there we sat in the infamous elevator shaft room; it gave the night a little more oomph. The staff are all really pleasant.

The food here is definitely delish, but it's not the best I've ever had. I've been here with groups and I'm a firm believer in trying at least one bite of every dish on the table. I'd say one dish would be amazing, and the others were just okay. Both times we got the appetizer that was on special and they were fabulous: a tray of cheeses, meats, fruits, and nuts.  The salads and main dishes that I gave a thumbs up to are the fantasia salad (pears, walnuts, gorgonzola), caprese, rigatoni (with sausage, peas, in a creamy tomato sauce...so f-ing good), tortellacci (stuffed with cheese, pancetta, peas in a dreamy cream sauce, it was really rich in a really good way), veal shank (very flavorful and melts in your mouth), gnocchi (in parmesan cream sauce with truffle essence).

The rigatoni alla buttera is to die for, with that delicious tomato sauce with goat cheese, because we all know, goat cheese makes anything 100 times better.  I was never a big fan of gnocchi, and then I had it at Vivo and found out what difference good gnocchi makes. HOLY YUM!  The seafood dishes are delicious as well, but I go here for my pasta fix.  The meat dishes are allegedly really good too, but I have to admit that I base that statement on what others have said. As for appetizers, you cannot go wrong with anything here, but my favorite is the ever traditional and delicious bruschetta.  I would also highly recommend the roasted garlic mashed potatoes.  Even if you're on a date, it's worth it (if your date doesn't appreciate the deliciousness of roasted garlic, then he/she is not for you.) Make reservations and go now.  The prices are a little high, but I think it's worth it for the once in a while good Italian meal.  If you work around the western part of the loop, this isn't too far of a cab ride from work for a nice work lunch, and the prices are lower for lunch, but still a little pricey.  I do like the ambiance though, a little dimly-lit and quiet, so it's a great spot for a date night.",0.9963,0.672,0.243,0.085,0.5838095238095239

The appetizers selected were probably my least favorite part of the evening - just because they were nothing to write home about. My favorite were the crab cakes which were drizzled in a sweetly tangy Dijon vinaigrette.

The host staff was nice when it came to making the reservations, they even requested the special table that overlooks the restaurant without me even asking.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is so romantic, the lighting really helps out and the couches in the lounge are so soft. We weren't able to get the special table, so we were seated 10 minutes later and there was this delicious bread with olive oil, that was the best thing I've ever eaten in my life. For appetizers,  I ordered the calamari and my boyfriend got the Caesar salad and those were both good, they weren't great, but they were good. The best part was the main course and we both ordered the Salomone grigliati. It was perfect. The seasoning of the salmon just made it melt in your mouth. I loved it! The rosemary scented potatoes and asparagus that came with it were also very good, but that salmon is unforgettable. Vivo was a great experience and I am definitely going there again. The only problems I really had was an issue with a server and a Long Island Iced Tea. First of all, I never really knew exactly who my server was because at one point there were 4 different people taking care of us, I think that the busser actually brought us our salmon, which is fine, but it made it confusing as to who to tip at the end of our meal. Secondly, my boyfriend ordered a Long Island Iced Tea and it was ridiculously strong, it tasted like Robitussin.  Overall, great restaurant for a nice meal.

2008-09-09,4.0,"Vivo is a romantic, Southern Italian eatery on Restaurant Row. Their interior is dark and sensual, their walls lined with bottles of wine. Last month when we were there, the DJ next door (DJ Sativa) played 80's and 90's music, fun yet low key, letting us carry a conversation with ease. For starters, friends and I shared the formaggio del giorno (~$25?), a collection of artisan meats and cheese, the highlight (for me) being the carpaccio - can't beat thinly sliced beef tenderloin. Everyone loved the specialty cheese. My entree, the linguini gamberoni ($21), was irresistible. While the shrimp seemed to get in the way, the zesty combination of herbs, fresh cherry tomatoes, arugula, and an amazing basil pesto sauce carried itself, and made me want to finish the whole dish, even AFTER I was full. That's some mean pasta, and some of the best Italian I've had in recent memory. Drinks-wise, our waiter (Erick, we got along famously!) got us tasty peach kamikazes on the house. He also brought me a vodka gimlet; that's vodka straight (in my case, but you can get it on the rocks) with lime juice. Relaxing. He suggested one of their signature desserts, but after it came out, no one really found it remarkable. (No loss, I don't like dessert anyway.) Our hotel concierge recommended this place to us, and they didn't disappoint. In the mood for Italian? Check out Vivo for yourself!",0.9773,0.797,0.161,0.042,0.41892361111111115

The pasta could have had a bit less olive oil, and was sort of overcooked, but for the most part it was good. Super pleasant outdoor cafe, and dog friendly for good dogs. My lunch companion had the shrimp appetizer and it looked appetizing. The waitress - I liked her - but . . . it always annoys me when the waitstaff hover around when people are obviously having a conversation. AND don't interrupt our conversation, 'cos invariably people lose their train of thought. My friend happened to be talking about the women's beach volleyball team, and hey - it was a fun conversation! Anyway. A small complaint, 'cos the food was good, maybe this is just a peeve of mine. This place was super hot ten  years ago, and still has its Monday Industry Night - which I remember going to a number of times, back in the day.

I think they have re-vamped the space a bit because I didn't think there was such a nice lounge and outdoor area before. I was there with 5 others and we started with a couple cocktails in the lounge. The decor was beautiful, and the drinks very tasty (I had the Bellini-Up cocktail). The only reason I took off one star was because we had to wait almost an hour from our reservation time because a couple people refused to leave their table even though they had already paid their check....not really the restaurant's fault. The manager went over and politely got them to leave and apologized to us by sending over 3 appetizers for our group. The must try dish of the night was the Gnocchi that was sent over....unbelievably good!! Apparently, the secret ingredient is something with truffles. Everyone at the table enjoyed their dinners. My scallops were perfectly cooked and made for a nice light dish (which was perfect after indulging in the very creamy, gnocchi) My boyfriend's pork chop was also delicious and  served with some outstanding, creamy mashed potatoes. Overall a great experience, minus the wait, but they took care of that very nicely.

Vivo offers up intimate southern Italian dining in a great space.   I recently attended a private party in the upstairs party space that they share with VICE and was really impressed.  It's like an urban loft up there with a beautiful space and lots of windows. The only downside to having a party up there is at the end of the night- you have to navigate your way down the stairs that are a bit tricky if you are not paying attention. We started our most recent dinner with some of their appetizers, the cheese plate with prosciutto, the tuna and some of their gnochhi that I am always raving about.  Couple that with a great steak entree and the country style rigatoni and we had an amazing dinner. In the Summer months- I like to sit outside under the awning and enjoy a glass of wine watching the world walk by on Randolph.

2007-10-01,4.0,"As others have said, the atmosphere at Vivo is wonderful. Exposed brick, architectural flower arrangements, and an open floor plan all add to a great ambiance. Plus, they have the great uplighting that makes everyone look gorgeous while seated around the table. Love that. The food was good as well: the caprese salad is absolutely amazing and you MUST get it. I had scallops that were quite tasty and I also sampled the risotto (a special of the night) that was even better. The bread was awesome as well: the perfect crusty, salty, Italian stuff. The waiter was knowledgeable about the menu and never hovered, which I always appreciate.  There were a couple of things that kept this from being a 5 star restaurant. The first was a small thing, but definitely obnoxious: the man who refilled our water was obviously not very well trained, as he splashed the water ALL over the place. It would always interrupt things and was more than a bit annoying. Also, the restaurant only has one unisex bathroom which is difficult to find. Finally, (and this is just a weird pet peeve of mine) the waiter was wearing a tshirt and jeans. I know that this isn't necessarily a dressy place, but it was a Saturday night and all of the guests were dressed nicer than the waiter, which I don't think is right. I know I'm crazy, but I noticed it and didn't like it and therefore I'm allowed to yelp about it, right?

The only downside is the restaurant is pretty small so while you're waiting for your table to be available its hard not to feel like you're in the way.  You're also very close to the other diners so not very private conversations which I don't really mind if strangers hear what I'm saying anyway.,0.9817,0.762,0.204,0.034,0.6369755244755244

Got a table without a reservation at 7pm on a friday night, really cute romantic atmosphere and best of all delicious olives and bread with olive oil at the table. The bread was standard white bread but the olive oil and olives were some of the best I've had. Then came the food. We decided to do a few small plates so we order the grilled veggies app, the mashed potatoes, and a radicchio salad. First of all, all the food we got was cold. (Including the GRILLED vegetables.) We contemplated sending the veggies back but the flavor was fine (average, what a vegetable with olive oil on it tastes like) and we didn't really feel like going through the hassle. The potatoes were standard, yummy creamy mashed potato but no interesting flavor or anything. The salad bordered on gross because it was covered in waaay too much super-potent blue cheese. Our waiter totally ignored us through the meal and we waited forever to ask for a desert menu. I told the waiter I was torn between two options (a vanilla custard and white choc cheesecake) and he told us they were both bad. I asked for a non-chocolate desert rec and he had to look at the desert menu and really contemplate it. I liked that he warned us but was a little worried that it was so hard to come up with a tasty desert! We went with the pistachio ice cream which was very good.  I would come back here to have a drink (especially if they give you those olives at the bar!) because of the cute atmosphere.

2006-05-19,1.0,"I never thought I would give any restaurant only one star, especially one on Randolph that had a decent reputation, but I was pretty disgusted with just about everything about Vivo, and because I left $80 poorer after eating a meal worse than I've had at Sbarro at O'Hare, I feel it's warranted.  First the little that was good: the aesthetic, as others have mentioned is cool.  Exposed brick walls, dark, lots of candles, etc. Vivo had the potential to be a very romantic dinner.  Unfortunately, the decor was the only good part about our experience there. If you are just looking for someplace to have a drink, this might be a good place, but I absolutely can't recommend it for dinner.  Now for the bad: We walked in fairly late night, around 10pm and there were a few tables with patrons. The host/hostess was no place to be found; we just stood there for 10 minutes waiting to be seated. Once we sat we ordered drinks, a salad and dinner.  That was the last time we heard from our waiter until we received the bill.    We ordered a ""fantasia"" salad which was watercress, pears, gorgonzola, walnuts, tomato, and a vinaigrette.  The salad was $9 but was no bigger than a typical house salad. Sounded good in concept but it came with a drop of dressing, a large dolop of cheese, and 2 walnuts.  About 5 minutes later we were presented with our entrees. Despite seeing we were not done with our salad, the food runner dropped off our two massive plates (note not massive portions) of food. There was not even enough room on the table for everything so we couldn't possibly have even kept the salad around to nibble on it. The table was just entirely too small, more like a cocktail table.  The runner actually balanced our plates on each edge and I was seriously worried we were both going to end up with plates of pasta in our laps.  So we told him to take the salad and began to eat.  Unfortunately not much sounded good so we both ordered the ""ravioli special"" which was 4-cheese ravioli in a simple marinara.  Not hard to screw up, right?  Wrong. I've had better from the frozen aisle of Costco. The ravioli filling was barely detectable and tasteless, and the sauce was extremely bland with no amount of salt, pepper, or parmesan being able to come to the rescue, not to mention the whole dish was swimming in pasta water because the raviolis were clearly not drained well before being served. After having a few bites I would have preferred to make a Dominick's run and had Vivo allow me to heat up a jar of prego in the microwave in back instead. And as I mentioned before, the ghost town service wasn't even around after our meal was served to listen to a complaint.  To top it all off, there was something blowing out of the air vents: dandelion particles?  Dust? Asbestos?  I have no idea, but it was landing in our food and drinks.  Gross.  Now some of you may be saying; you should have sent it back and thrown a fit, but I'm just not like that. Who likes to start bitching at the waiter at what is supposed to be a nice quiet candle-lit dinner.    Sigh. Maybe I was just feeling poor on my Vivo night so I was offended by the $10 cocktails and the $15 plates of barely edible ravioli, or maybe I was feeling a little impatient because it was later in the evening and Red Light, our original destination, was closing its kitchen as we got there, who knows. I certainly wasn't in a bad mood; I had just seen Spamalot for pete's sake which was hilarious and I'm STILL fired up about this enough to write this freakin' novel about Vivo.  Bottom line: read what I wrote, see the other review about the food being subpar, and really think if you want to risk blowing an evening and a c-note on dinner at this place, especially for Italian. Even read my other reviews and see that I'm not one of these snotty people who are miserable in their lives and never pleased with anything.  I'll never go back to Vivo again.  My fellow Yelpers, you can do a lot better.",-0.8194,0.767,0.112,0.121,0.5366990005878894
