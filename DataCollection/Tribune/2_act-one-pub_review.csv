So many good times had here, with enormous quantities of beef, chicken, potatoes and alcohols consumed. The best Mac and Cheese around! S. and I want to thank all the servers, bartenders, bussers, musicians and managers who have so often made our times here special and caused us to feel special, too. It's been you all who, with your individual warmth, charm, professionalism, good humour and willingness to enter into relationship with us and so many others, who have shared with us your gifts and, for a brief while made life in Rogers Park filling and fulfilling. We will miss you. We wish you all- those there and gone through the years to you ending your service locking up in March- all the best life offers. You've done well by us and we thank you.

2016-01-07,2.0,"Went in on a Saturday around noon for brunch. They have good brunch drink specials on the weekends - $4 bloody marys and mimosas. The bloody was okay, it was more spice than anything else. Gave me awful heartburn, but it was drinkable. The mimosa had an aspartame aftertaste, I'm assuming they used low-cal OJ, which is a terrible idea, and if it's true, just warn the customer. I ordered the BLTE, which was so disappointing. First of all, a BLT means mostly bacon, right? It's the main ingredient on the sandwich. Well I got TWO slices of bacon. BTW this sandwich was $9. I was pissed. Also, the bacon is sickeningly sweet, no salt, nothing, just this weird maple flavor that gives no satisfaction of eating bacon at all. Once we had our food, our server did not even glance our way once. We had to stand up and flag her down after sitting with empty drinks for ten minutes. It took just as long to get the check. All in all, this place is not very good, and adding shitty service when the place is near empty, I will not be returning, and the three people with me agreed.",-0.9656,0.714,0.101,0.186,0.5751276501276503

The main pull: brunch, especially the BLOODY MARYS.  They are by far the best bloody marys I have ever had.  I lived in New York City - the brunch mecca - and never came across one like this.  It's perfectly spiced, full-bodied, flavorful...and...get this: they are 3 bucks.  And it's not in some tiny glass with a ton of ice, it's a 16 oz. glass.  The key to the greatness is that Manny, one of the all-star bartenders, makes the mix himself.  Between the mix and his decorative abilities, this is the most delicious and beautiful bloody one could ever encounter.",0.9862,0.727,0.202,0.071,0.6982213438735178

It's connected to Mayne Stage, a concert venue, but they also have live music in the pub itself on the weekends. I didn't mind, but it was too loud for the rest of our party, so we left shortly after the band started playing. Awesome draft beer specials ($3 Lagunitas Pale Ales? $4 Bells Winter Whites? Sign me up!) I was surprised to see such good specials on a Friday evening. The food was all good. I ate nachos, since they had them on the menu. The chips were obviously freshly fried and delicious, and stood up well to the toppings. Fake cheese sauce was in abundance, and there was a large amount of pico de gallo, a few pickled jalapenos, and some sour cream on the top. I ordered the pulled pork option, which was good, but definitely already had barbeque sauce on it- this is not an ideal nacho topping, since cheese + barbecue sauce = yech. Overall, though, I'd give them a 4/5 and just order the veggie nachos next time. Two people at the table ordered the fish and chips, which, although bizarrely expensive, got good reviews. Another person got a burger, which he also enjoyed, particularly the siracha garlic mayo that came with it.

The trivia is epic, the house bands are phenomenal, the beer list is off the hizzy, and the menu is free of missteps. This place, and Mayne Stage - the venue to which it is attached, are incredible. I've never seen a bad show or had a bad meal at either. The prices are reasonable, and the bar staff is really knowledgable. They're always running a special that seems too good to be true. The burgers are all incredible, if the brisket is on special it's worth canceling plans, and if you haven't had their breakfast sliders, you are missing out on the platonic ideal of what a breakfast sandwich is supposed to be. I am almost mad at the breakfast sliders because they have made me realize how inferior all other breakfast sandwiches are to them. Brioche bun, hand made sausage, and a softly scrambled egg topped with mounds of gooey, delicious cheese. They are one of those sandwiches that you eat in preposterously small bites as to savor every flavor. They made me realize what James Brown's cohorts were trying to equate when they cried, ""Don't hurt 'em so good."" Seriously, since Morseland has closed they've really stepped up to the plate, moving from beyond a serviceable restaurant that was the natural extension of a venue into an entity and flavor of its own.

My guests that enjoy great whiskies are also never disappointed, and until I bring in my winos, I still don't know the extent of what this place can impress with.  2) Absolutely amazing service.  Again, even when the place is slammed, and it takes a while to get seen after an almost immediate seating, I get courteous apologies and great service once I'm able to place my order.  3) Food is on point, hot, tasty, and given in almost exaggeratedly huge portions.  I like to order seafood appetizers from them because they come with this great white sauce with green flecks of what I've been told is tarragon.  THAT SAUCE IS AMAZING.  I would order fried dough and just dip it in that sauce, and I would pay $12.00 for it.  Do you hear me, Act One Pub?  125% profit on a girl like me, and I know I'm not alone. And regarding the decor, it's beautiful.  It's just plain gorgeous.  I go in feeling underdressed every time I come in.  And while that's not saying a lot, because I don't really bother to wear fancy dancy clothes anymore, it's still great to be in a place that by proxy makes you feel special.  The bathrooms are gigantic, the lighting in there is flattering, and the venue itself, when you get into the show - is spacious and great.  More people need to check out Act One Pub and The Mayne Stage.  Period.",0.9956,0.745,0.217,0.038,0.6134761904761905

They have a really nice outdor seating area where you can enjoy their brunch drink specials; bottomless mimosas, beermosas or bloody marys for $8.00 which really cannot be beat.

Yelp/Open Table helped us zero in on Act One and we were thrilled. Service was fast and attentive and even the television programming (strong man competition and I Love Lucy) was perfect for us.

Clean plates all around. The bottomless mimosas/bloody marys and Mother's Day special (2-for-1 entrees) helped keep costs down.

The bar was empty aside from maybe 4 people at the end near the server station. The bartender, Anthony (from the receipt), eventually came down and said hello. He didn't give us menus and went back to the other end of the bar. I was telling my friend what I usually get and what I thought he would like, but I wanted him to see the menu. Eventually, the bartender came back and I asked for a menu. Nothing seemed to be prompt with this guy, as we were waiting like 10 minutes just to order a drink. We finally got our cocktails, they were done well and my friend commented ""great choice"" for drinks.  Service only got worse from here. We had finished our drinks and wanted round two, the bartender had to come our way because two other people had sat at the end of the bar. We thought great, we will get service, apparently they were musicians or somebody special, because he was pre-occupied with finding a manager for them maybe for comps or something. At this point my friend and I were completely annoyed and just wanted the check. So, when he was within ear shot we asked for the check. The bartender acknowledged us then proceeded to clear the empty bar top where no one was sitting and talk to the folks at the end of the bar, it was like he was ignoring us on purpose. My friend was visibly annoyed at this point, and very loudly asked for the check.  We were planning on spending the evening having a few great cocktails, instead we left having only one and went to Sidecar where we got impeccable service and great drinks (they are now serving Buffalo Trace).  I am not sure why we were discriminated against by this bartender, but it seemed as if he was to busy talking to friends at the end of the bar than to do his job.  Wait on your bar, be observant, check back if folks want another round, don't ignore your customers...seems pretty simple to me.

2012-10-08,3.0,"It's time for an update on this joint. Boyfriend and I recently thought - it's been a relatively long time since we forever swore this place off. Their website showed they had a new menu, new dishes, better choices - so we risked it and it was worth it. This place is vastly better than it was when I wrote my first, probably scathing, review. I don't know if  it's new owners, new cooks or both, coupled with a better menu, but the food is actually good here now and I don't hate myself after a meal. We've been back many times actually since discovering this place isn't total garbage anymore. This isn't fine dining by any means or anything out of the ordinary, its standard American pub fare but not low quality bar food and  the restaurant itself is very nice, inviting, warm, with rich dark wood everywhere, it's an upstanding looking place and a nice change from Morseland down the street that we've been to so many times its almost painful going now. The prices at both Act One and Morseland are basically the same too.  Apps - their calamari is fresh, crunchy, not soggy, the breading doesn't fall off, good flavor, not bland. Their soft pretzels are phenom, made at some local bakery without the horrible huge salt chunks on the outside (cheese sauce is crummy and needs to be made with real cheese but it still suffices) and their Korean BBQ wings are very good, nice flavor change if you are looking for wings but don't want the norm. Their flatbreads are fun but the crust kinda weirds me out after a bit, I think because they are so thin, you can like, feel the grease on them? Because there is no dough to soak it up? Not sure how to explain it, still enjoyed them but they could probably improve the flatbread recipe itself.  The boyfriend enjoys their burgers and turkey burgers (must order with sriracha garlic mayo, holy heavens). I've had a great fish sandwich, fish and chips are good (not out of this world, but good) and their Market Chopped salad with lemon basil vinaigrette is a nice, refreshing change from heavy food .... plus they have a nice bar, great beer selection.  This place is busyyyyy on Friday nights (and I'm sure Saturday nights too) but that makes the atmosphere that much more enjoyable, its no fun eating in an empty restaurant.

Would we go back?  Sure, but probably wouldn't be our first choice.  One thing to note about this area is that it is still in a transitional stage so don't be surprised if you see a lot of police in the area.  Having the Pritzker name attached to a business in the neighborhood has done the area a bit of good.  They also have valet parking for $5.00 if you don't feel adventurous enough to venture out onto the side streets for a spot.  I would also suggest reservations on a weekend show night.  I seemed to be filling up quickly.",0.9759,0.846,0.124,0.03,0.5995370370370371

That is one of the craziest things I have heard! Most people use buttermilk when frying chicken. He must have been absent on the day his class learned to fry chicken when he was in culinary school.  I told her to cancel the chicken and I order a scrambled egg instead. The waffles was light and flavorful; quite delicious. The egg was perfectly scrambled, light, fluffy, and not over cooked.

The place was pleasant, which is especially impressive when it's surrounded by so much unpleasant.   I'd generally prefer to eat somewhere where I don't worry about my car or the forgetful panhandlers who request my cash multiple times, but if I had to be on Morse St, I'd certainly consider Act One again.",0.8449,0.812,0.141,0.046,0.5300396825396826

Act One was the bright light on a night that started out disappointing - we planned to go to the Morseland but they weren't seating anyone for dinner because of an event that went from 6p-9p, and they weren't even taking delivery because it was a 2.5 hour wait the night before a Groupon expired (methinks the Morseland did this on purpose as a big middle finger to Groupon, but they also gave that finger directly to their customers as well).  Sooo, my fellow Rogers Park denizens and anyone who might plan to travel to the far north side - skip the Morseland's mediocre food and annoying events that make it impossible to talk to your companions during dinner (if you can even get in) - and head a block west to Act One for better food & atmosphere at a similar price.",0.9371,0.808,0.144,0.047,0.7167130488559059

Hidden gem in Chicago! I had a gift card to go so we finally went and it exceeded everything that I thought it would be.  The cheese plate and mussels were amazing.  The cheese plate had 4 cheese from tangy to mild and the walnuts were sweet and spicy. I loved that the sauce for the mussels was a creamy sauce and so you could sauce everything up with the crispy baguettes. The Bacon Mac was smokey and cheesy.   The tots were perfect peppery and a little extra salt. The BLT was yummy with thick-cut bacon and toasted bread with crispy lettuce. Best BLT I've had in a long time. The burger (cooked medium) was juicy and tasty and the fried goat cheese on it, well, I ate it by itself while it was hot and melty.

Caesar salads were pleasant. The high point was my companion's scallop entrée -- the presentation was a nice departure, with scallops arrayed on the plate and linguini strands woven through them, slalom-style (she said they were among the tastiest scallops she's had). My bistro steak was serviceable; it reminded me of a top of the menu Ponderosa steak from decades ago, served with mashed potatoes that cried out ""instant!"" -- OK, but just. We liked a malted chocolate pot au crème for dessert. The wine selection is good. Service was OK (about what I expect from a ""gastropub,"" which is how Act One bills itself).

I think the sound carries because there was one group of patrons who seemed a little overserved  (maybe just obnoxious) but they kinda disrupted the laid back atmosphere.  Good neighborhood place to relax have a beer and watch the game.  Fish and chips were giant but I would say under seasoned and not a fan of the coleslaw.  On the other hand the pork wellington looked small in initial presentation but delivered on flavor and portion.  Bartender and server did a good job with drinks and extra info about menu.  I could have used some ice cream with flourless chocolate cake. It was so rich and good, served hot, mmmm.  Not much of a view but that part of the the neighborhood is still transitioning.  I love Rogers Park and this is great addition.  I hear Fri/Sat nights are busy but early Sunday was easy and laid back.  I will go back both the scallops and salmon dishes looked interesting.  I am looking forward to trying them when I go next time.",0.9955,0.751,0.239,0.01,0.4772295321637426

I don't think this place quite lives up to the self-assigned gastropub label.  Dad ordered fish and chips. Fries were okay, fish was humongous and came wrapped in newspaper printed sandwich-style paper. I ordered the BLT, which as another review mentioned, was a very weak attempt at a BLT. Two pieces of white bread toasted, two pieces of uninspired bacon, a thin smear of what was advertised as garlic aioli,  mealy tomatoes, and limp butter lettuce. I opted for a size caesar salad that closely resembled caesars at most chain restaurants. Tootsie roll cheesecake was okay.  The cheesecake was fine, the tootsie roll ganache was lacking any tootsie roll or chocolate flavor.

Our server made sure we were done by 7:40ish so we could grab seats for the show. 2 stars!  After that, it was downhill.   We quickly discovered that the food needed to exit stage left.... We started with the cheese plate. The cheese wasn't anything special, and tasted pretty bland. It's a fancy bar environment so we didn't expect anything that fancy, but it kinda sucked. One of the cheeses was definitely basic string cheese in a bulbous form. We are cheese lovers and usually like most cheeses, but this plate was lame and flavorless overall. At least the portions were good. On to the entrees.  I had the BLT and my wife had the vegetarian Shepard's Pie.  We both didn't like our food. My BLT was the weakest attempt at a BLT I've ever seen. Each slice had two small tomato slices, one wilty lettuce leaf and some old, two pieces of microwaved bacon that was chewy like baco-gum. Not cool!  I'm guessing the bacon came straight out of the fridge (after being cooked the night before and stored away) and was microwaved to reach room temp. It was dry and flavorless (a theme here apparently). The side of fries were OK. Fries, you are my hero!  I know a BLT isn't something chefs dream of making, but put some effort in!  My wife's said her Shepard's Pie tasted odd, with the peas overwhelming it too much. The whipped potatoes on top were lumpy and flavorless.   Food - 0 stars for being the low point of a fun night. Maybe we should've tried something else?  Maybe we should've brought our own food?  Who knows but if it's on the menu, it better be good or don't put it on there. Know that... know that.  We probably won't be back since there are other places to eat before a show. BTW, the Mayne Stage venue (attached to restaurant) was really cool.

The plating was excellent--very attractive--but the food was nothing too special. The cheese plate had way too much cheese, compared the amount of olives/bread/grapes we were given, and the cheeses themselves somehow didn't go that well together (tasted like Swiss, Bleu, and Cheddar to me, plus a tiny ramekin of chevre). I would recommend getting the cheese plate only if you have 4 people in your party, and ask for extra bread.

2011-01-08,4.0,"Act One Pub was a great experience for my fiance and I.  We discovered this place through Groupon and gave it a shot due to the close proximity to our home.   If you are not familiar with this neighborhood, the actual Act One Pub was somewhat difficult to see by driving by.  The Pub name signs on the doors and windows are dwarfed in comparison to the brightly lite neon marquee sign advertising the Mayne Stage.  We found parking difficult in this neighbor hood.  We spent 20 minutes driving around to find street parking, but realized there is a free parking lot about 2 blocks away on Morse. We go inside, the host was very pleasant and when I asked questions regarding the music playing in the venue (Mayne Stage) connected to the pub, he was very prompt at send over someone to tell me about the band and how these two places work together.   We sat down for dinner at 9:00 pm on Saturday approximatively 3/4 of the tables  were full.  (Mostly couples and there were two large groups friends) it looked like the rest of the people that had been previously dinner were standing in the back room bar awaiting to go into the music venue.  The interior decor is very welcoming and warm and cozy feeling and it reminds me of a larger, newer version of Cullens Pub (on Southport and Grace).  Act One has a decent amount of seats, both booths and 4 seat high tops.  We sat in a booth and it was comfortable.  There are little old Irish looking lights which softly illuminate the table in each booth.  For me, it's a very nice homey touch.  They have a somewhat typical wooden Irish bar.  It's new and clean, but has the look of an Irish / English pub feel.  I like it a lot.  Seated at the bar was one couple and a couple groups of friends.  When we were there the crowd seemed nice and in the age range with what seemed like 25 - 45. Most of the people seemed to be in their 30's.  Everyone seemed to be having a good time though and the room was full of conversation. Our server was excellent and knew about the tastes and flavor of the three micro brew beers I had asked questions on.  It was helpful, and the waitress was spot on.  My fiance had the 3 Floyds Pride and Joy, and I had Magic #9 from Magic Hat Brewery in VT.  We told our waitress what we felt like drinking in a beer and she suggested this, and it turned out to be a great match to what we wanted.  The beer selection was not extensive, however, the people who put together the beer menu did a great job at picking a few good ones that seem to fit a variety of tastes.  We didn't pay attention to their wine menu so I can not comment on that.  Value speaking, I say top notch!  We paid $5 each for a Three Floyd's and a Magic Hat.  You find these particular beers in other bars around the city priced somewhere around the current market price of gold...  We found the menu to off a medium amount of choices, however, I would rate the range of choices, large, due to the varying items they offer.  Keep in mind, Act One seems to be advertising themselves as a pub, not a restaurant, and in my opinion, with this taken into account the I say the menu is excellent for a Pub.   My fiance ordered the lobster mac to start, and the ribwich.  She liked the lobster mac and thought it was very flavor full, but thought more lobster chucks could be added.  The ribwich was flavorful, and meaty, not overcooked or over flavored with BBQ sauce, very moist and tender.  I chose the tuna carpaccio to start and the grilled sea scallops with cappollini and spinach.  For me it was absolutely excellent.  For this day, the tuna seemed very fresh, a sliced very well.  The carpaccio was paired with fresh avacado and side greens.  These were a great start and think they were great together.   The scallops seemed beyond fresh and were cooked perfectly!  There was no metallic taste at all and they melted like butter.  Pasta pasta was served atop the spinach leaves and these were both cooked perfectly in my opinion. Our apps were served within less that 10 minuets after receiving our beers.  The entrées came out exactly when we finished out apps.  I would have preferred, maybe 5 minute interval.  But again, this is promoted primarily as a pub not a restaurant.   Overall, staff is excellent, very friendly, personable, and knowledgeable.  The two types of beers we had were great and at an excellent price (compared to other bars or restaurants).  The food was great, and at a fair price.  I think they are very competitively priced.

We had plans to go to a show at Mayne Stage last Saturday, so we decided to check out Act One beforehand, as we were told that by making dinner reservations here, we would also get reserved seats in the theatre.  Well, the place was packed when we walked in, so lucky we had the reservations.  But the table we were given was space better used for the passage of people.  Cramped.  Awkward.  I cannot use those words enough. We ordered the lobster mac as an appetizer, and were disappointed.  It was almost completely devoid of flavor.  I could taste the few chunks of lobster, but the cheese was tasteless.  For my entree, I got the wrap, and my bf got the fish and chips.  And while my wrap came with a gigantic bowl of fries, his fish came with ... American chips?  It was a little odd.  The wrap was tasty, and I did like the fries, but the boy was taken aback by how salty the chips were. Now, I'm making the assumption that it is the restaurant's responsibility to communicate to Mayne Stage who is on the reservation list, so they can reserve seats accordingly.  But when we arrived next door for our show, our name was nowhere on the list!!  Perhaps they were just having an off night - they were very busy - but this is unacceptable.  (See my review for Mayne Stage for what happened next.)",0.2339,0.918,0.044,0.038,0.4550793650793651

I remember a person involved said they couldnt support whatever came afterwards.  Personally I cant tell the difference between the food from both places. Each time very good food. Awesome atmosphere and good service. I think some people have either strange taste or are just too tricky with their tastes or reviews. Well I guess we all dont have the same tastebuds.   In short this is a great place, is it perfect? No, I had the tunafish sandwich once and it was too minty, but they let me have another entree which was very good, the hamburger. And the steaks are great too. Great Bar and Beer selection. Please anyone out there please tell me if there is another restaurant with the amazing interior of Act One.

It's so rare that a dish like that comes with actual vegetables, in this case zucchini, yellow squash, carrots and red pepper. I loved them.

While I do not subscribe to the belief that goat cheese can make all things ""prettier"" or ""fancier,"" I am a firm believer in this marriage of tater and cheese.

Roasted chicken and sauteed spinach, pork chop with a bit of pineapple and a berry galette have won my heart. Also, the tots. Always, the tots.

2010-08-21,2.0,"My boyfriend and I live in the neighborhood and were excited to try a new place for dinner! The atmosphere was nice--mood lighting and professionally dressed wait staff. The sports on the TV was a bit out-of-place and distracting, though. Our waitress was nice, but seemed to lose interest in serving our table the second neither of us ordered drinks. I'm aware sticking with water might say ""cheapskate,"" but that doesn't mean a waitress should assume a poor tip. The busboy ended up being more attentive--and being the one to refill my water after it had been empty about five minutes. (Btw, we did tip 20%, and I hope some went to that busboy). We started with the tater tots with a goat cheese dip. Really enjoyed these. The bf ordered the porkchops, and loved them! He inhaled the chops and plain, but well-made, mashed potatoes. Both of our meals included a side of cooked spinach that was bitter and limp, which we left mostly untouched. I had the roast chicken, described in the menu as ""Miller's Farm airline breast served with bacon gremolata and roasted new potatoes."" The potatoes were good, but the chicken tasted SO lemony and salty, and the plate was without a hint of bacon. With nothing to relieve the overpowering lemon and salt flavors, I didn't eat much of it.  For dessert, we had the berry crumble. This was delicious! I would just order a plate of it for dinner if I could. Overall, there is definitely room for improvement. I hope they do make some changes to their entrees, especially because they were a bit pricey to be only so-so.",0.9818,0.8,0.141,0.059,0.5483476345083487

The interior and out door seating area's are beautiful and the inside is comfortable but still classy. It reminds me of a restaurant from the 1930's.  For our appetizer we did the Spicy-Chicken spring rolls. This might have been the only disappointing thing about my meal. They were good, but they had a processed taste to them. It tasted like they were just taken out of the freezer and thrown in the fryer. The Albacore Tuna-Salad Sandwich that I ordered for my entree was delicious. It was served with a side of Tater Tots. The best part of the entree is that they gave me a fresh bowl of Goat Cheese to accompany my meal. The Cheese was delicious.  Act One offers a fully stocked bar that offered some of my favorite Bourbons. They were a bit pricey, but the drinks were generously poured.

My Rogers Park Foodie friends and I, afraid of the Morseland Groupon, decided to give Act One a try last week. We were pleasantly surprised! Brielle, our waitress, was friendly and knowledgeable. Oftentimes, I'm on the fence when I hear recommendations. This time, I trusted her when she suggested the white wines and to go for the fish and chips. I'm not a huge fan of white wine - but Brielle's choices were right on the spot. And they went well with fried fish! I'm also tempted to argue that their fish and chips were one of the top 3 I've ever had - the batter was perfectly crisp, light, and not greasy. The fish was excellent. The only (small) complaint was that their tartar sauce might be made with greek yogurt rather than mayo (it had a taste...not sure what I thought of it). Their menu was appetizing and their food was wonderful. Service was great. I'd definitely go again.",0.9908,0.736,0.224,0.04,0.5133885438233264

We happended to be there for the half priced wine bottles on Wednesday night and their wine selection is quite nice and a great value! Be sure to save room for desert ....the bread pudding was AWESOME! Perhaps the best part of the meal was the service...Matt was our waiter and he was absolutely attentive, helpful and friendly. He took the time to get to know us and offered to take us on a tour of the attached theater.

2010-06-13,4.0,"Okay, this place probably only deserve 3.5 stars at the moment but they're brand new so I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt.  Plus, the more I think about the meal I had, the more I liked it. I went for dinner with my neighbor the other night since we both live down the street from the restaurant (or we wouldn't be neighbors, duh) and have been wanting to check it out.  I kind of thought it would be a little cozier and slightly more charming, but it seemed to lack atmosphere and warmth.  We went late and it wasn't very crowded so maybe it's different with more body count. Anyway, I thought they had a nice drink menu and I applaud them for having some old fashioned drinks available, but as another reviewer commented, I'm not sure they know what a Dark and Stormy actually is? (Sidebar: For the best D&S ever, go to The Bristol in Bucktown.) The special of the evening was lobster mac and cheese, so we ordered one serving to share as an appetizer, and I must say it was very good.  Very cheesy with big chunks of actual lobster and very good quality pasta.  And it wasn't even expensive.  My neighbor had the burger, which he said he liked, and I had the caesar salad with steak which I really enjoyed.  As the menu mentions, the dressing is spiced with a special ingredient to give it a little something extra, and it worked.  The steak was also cooked properly to order and was seasoned nicely. We then split the Tootsie Roll cheesecake for dessert out of morbid curiosity, and were pleasantly surprised.  If someone didn't tell me it had Tootsie Roll bits in the crust, I probably wouldn't have noticed, but it was very well made cheesecake regardless.  It had a homemade taste and texture that one doesn't usually find in restaurant cheesecake.  Really good stuff.   The service was okay...pretty slow considering how not-busy they were, and our waiter was only so-so, but I've certainly had worse. Our total bill was only like $45 which was cheaper than I would have expected and we left very full.  So all in all, a good experience, but I'm kind of worried about this place.  I was so glad when it (re)opened and it certainly has potential, but it's never very busy when I walk by, so I really encourage you to check it out, especially if you live nearby and want a change of pace from Morseland.",0.9984,0.749,0.219,0.033,0.5685291411097865

The food was mediocre at best. I had the ravioli, which was bland and soggy. My partner had a burger, which was okay, but nothing to write home about.  The entrees don't come with bread or sides. The entree portion sizes were not large enough to compensate. I left the restaurant hungry. (Come on guys, this is not a high end restaurant where you expect to order everything al la carte.)  Although I didn't feel rushed out the door, since we got our food promptly and since there was so little of it, we were done with dinner in about 25 minutes. This would be great if I were going to a show, but I actually wanted a dining experience.  On the other hand, the service was very good, and the drinks selection was admirable.

2010-06-04,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place as it is a few blocks from my house, but unfortunately none of us among our party of 4 were pleased with our experience. First off, the drinks. Decent beer and wine selection plus a few concoctions.  On to the appetizer - the veggie tots. These were billed as zucchini, red pepper, and olive ""tots"" with a goat cheese dip. The goat cheese dip was great but the tots ended up being breaded and the vegetables mentioned pureed so it kind of tasted like eating fried mashed potatoes.   For entrees we kept it simple: fish and chips, a burger, the french dip, and the ravioli. The fish was very greasy and the breading tasteless, the burger cooked well-done despite a request for medium rare, the french dip made of pork vs. beef was literally mince meat and very greasy, and the ravioli was swimming in butter and cream. The prices on the menu were fairly reasonable and service was attentive, but this was some of the poorer tasting food I've had at a restaurant in awhile. I'll likely give this place one more shot in a few weeks given its proximity, but competition with uncommon ground, ropa, and morseland cafe whom are in the same game price-wise this is not. Man I'm getting more depressed writing this because I wanted this so badly to be good. It would be really nice if they added to the menu healthier and additional vegetarian options, i.e. less grease.

2010-06-01,4.0,"Glad to have it in the neighborhood. Not perfect; they're trying a little too hard with the food. One dish had some baconed something-or-other as part of it, and when we asked what it was, she clearly thought we were asking about the giardiniera. Our food was delicious, but a little wacky. Here's what I mean by ""trying too hard."" My pork french dip was more of a loose meat sandwich. The mustard was so hot, it would burn the chrome off of your Buick. Thankfully, the menu warns you of this. The fries were entirely average. If I had a dollar for every time the menu said ""house made"" next to something, I'd be rich. You don't need to make your own mayo, really. We'll still love you. Regardless, like I said, the food was tasty, and we're very glad to see this place back up and running. I had an ""Elder Statesman"" cocktail, a gin + elderberry liqueur drink served on the rocks. Very good. Service was very attentive.   It's been open less than two weeks.

The old managers (back when it was The Morse Theatre) gave the place a classy, yet comfortable and welcoming neighborhood feel. I got none of that this time. The new vibe is generic and sterile.

2010-05-22,5.0,"Hot Damn and hallelujah! I've been waiting for this restaurant to open up!  We had the opportunity to dine here opening night, and wow!  It was definitely worth the trek! For starters, we ordered their veggie tater tots, calamari, french fries, seared scallops and Caesar salad.  It was seriously an explosion of flavors.  The sauce and dip that accompanied the calamari and veggie tater tots were incredible.  What we really liked about the tator tots is the fact that it incorporates so many veggies instead of being just a plain potato tot.  This is a great way to get your serving of veggies and it would fool a veggie hater.  We inhaled the scallops!  I think that I could eat 4 of these on my own.  My husband went crazy over their Caesar.  The dressing had a kick unlike any Caesar that he had ever tasted.   For entrees, my husband ordered the Bistro steak and I ordered the Fish and chips.  Portions were way bigger than we anticipated. The Bistro steak was a steal at $18.  It's the most beautiful cut of meat, the hangar steak.  It came with a Guinness Bordelaise sauce  and perfectly seasoned mashed potatoes.  My fish was perfect.  Flaky, and moist on the inside with the crispiest batter on the outside.   For dessert, we chose their Tootsie roll cheesecake and their bread pudding.  My son claimed that it was the best dessert that he ever had. Service was impeccable.  Dishes were cleared immediately, clean silver brought with each course.  What makes the service really shine for me is that I am a chronic coffee drinker.  Instead of refilling my cup and throwing off my sugar to cream ratio, our server brought me a fresh cup every single time.  More restaurants should offer this service. My son is not at the age where he can sit and savor a food coma.  He wanted to mingle and be a bar fly.  I really want to thank the staff for their patience and for entertaining him.  They offered him  cherries and gave him a private tour of the entire restaurant and theater.  It really made his night.  They are definitely not there to entertain children, but they have mad skills.  It gave us more time to be absolute pigs. I am horrified to admit this, but our whole family went to sleep at 830pm after eating that amazing meal.   When their brunch opens, I'm in trouble. P.S.  The theater will soon be open for live acts.  I imagine that the sound will be incredible.  They have an incredible sound system and booth in place.",0.9256,0.843,0.099,0.058,0.5606107660455484
