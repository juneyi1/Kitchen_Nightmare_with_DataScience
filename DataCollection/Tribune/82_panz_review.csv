Have gone once before and was craving it this week and stopped by 3 times during the posted hours, but no one was seen inside and the doors are locked! The biggest tease ever since its delicious and now I want it to be a regular meal :( Can't even find a phone number to call and ask what's going on. To the owner: please fill us in!",0.615,0.763,0.137,0.1,0.7395604395604395

The restaurant is new and seems to be family owned, which is really nice. The manager came by and actually had a conversation with me and my friends. It made us feel extremely welcomed. I will definitely be going back. I would definitely recommend them to anyone :)",0.9885,0.609,0.391,0.0,0.6205627705627705
2016-06-08,4.0,"I ended up here after seeing the hour-long line at chicago pizza & oven grinder. Ashley (and her friend Jackie) were both super nice, and the calzone (or panzerotti, or whatever you call it) was pretty good!  Since this is a new restaurant, here's my advice for improvement: 1) Consider offering the jardin spice served separately on the side, to avoid making the 'panz' too watery inside. 2) I was initially worried I'd be paying way more for a vegetarian panz due to seeing the $1 per topping price. Thankfully we talked and I got something with a bunch of different veggies for 8-9 bucks. Make it official and add a veggie special to the menu! 3) This is a stretch, but i could see 'vegetarians going nuts' for this place if you added eggplant as a topping. 4) Beer. Was really craving one to pair with the panzerotti!",0.8392,0.845,0.114,0.041,0.5425127902400629

2016-05-31,5.0,"Been wanting to try this since it opened, but just finally made it in tonight. I live a block away, and let me warn you that this place is dangerously good. We walked in at 9:50, but even though it was a few minutes before closing, the women working there were extremely nice. I ordered the Mac n cheese. Took about 5 mins to cook and came out piping hot. Delicious. Do yourself a favor and stop in here!",0.7671,0.687,0.181,0.132,0.7214285714285715
2016-05-22,3.0,"I was in my way to chipotle when I saw panz. Never heard of it so I figured I'd give it a try. I like the concept and you get a lot of food, but I feel like the sauce has no flavor. I added sausage and jalapeño to my calls e and it mostly tasted like a breads tick dipped in cheap marinara. Like I said, I was full and it was a decent price, but the flavor was lacking. The people working were super nice and friendly though and I had a decent conversation with one whole I waited for mine to bake",0.9721,0.746,0.229,0.026,0.6277777777777778
2016-05-20,5.0,"I was curious to try this  interesting concept that opened at the short-lived Pizza Persona. Ignore the review by Tyler ""bug up his ass"" H below, I had an awesome customer service experience at Panz tonight . Actually to be honest, I had the best service I've had in a local place in a long time. I ordered the BBQ Mac n Cheese Panz after I had a run through of each of the menu items with the server/cashier. I decided to add sausage and veggies to my ""base"" Panz.  Yes, it's $1 extra to add veggies or meat but my dinner still came under $10. That is still pretty darn cheap for a huge Panz. I did not eat in and took my Panz to go. By the time I ate it, it was still piping hot! I have to say that this thing was delicious! Only thing that I wish I would maybe have asked is maybe a dipping sauce for the crust. I will definitely be back and highly recommend others to try this neighborhood gem and looking forward to the patio seating!",0.9859,0.788,0.191,0.021,0.658235294117647
2016-05-19,5.0,"I really enjoyed the food at Panz. I live in the neighborhood and wanted to check out this new restaurant. I came on Yelp to find out what kind of food it was, like a calzone, but way better. There was one negative review, based only on the staff, I have to say that the person who wrote that was very wrong. I was greeted by the staff right when I walked in the door, they were friendly and helpful. I also got to meet the owner and had a lovely conversation with him. All in all it was great food and friendly staff. I will absolutely be coming back. Very happy there is another pizza place in the 'hood. I definitely recommend everyone to check out Panz!",0.9899,0.647,0.293,0.061,0.640603514132926
2016-05-18,4.0,"I went in the other day because I live really close so wanted to see what this new place was about. As soon as I walked in, I was greeted right away and since I didn't know what was being served, the lady explained the concept to me and even gave suggestions on what was popular. I went with the basic panz with the addition of pepperoni. I don't even technically eat pepperoni, but it was good! The cashier was a young gentlemen who was really nice and made conversation with me while I waited. The panzerotti itself was delicious, it is cool that it is cooked right there in front of you, the dough is yummy and soft. It was pretty big too. Even though I was pretty hungry, I couldn't even finish it in one sitting, had to eat the other half the next day, I re-heated it in my toaster over and it was delicious. The only thing I would add to it is garlic because I freaking love garlic and it would be awesome. They had a lot of veggie/meat add ins, I should have asked if they had garlic. My only other suggestion to this new business is to have a list of the additional toppings up on the menu board so that we know whats available without having to look at the toppings because there were quite a few.",0.9938,0.793,0.192,0.014,0.5432395382395382

2016-05-09,1.0,"Walked in, the employee didn't ask if I or my friend I was with had been there before, strike one. Basically had to talk through the process with her--she works there she should know and engage the clients. Then once she got my friends order started another woman came behind the counter to take the next order me in line, however for some reason unbeknownst to me she proceeded to not ask me if I needed help but take the order of the person behind me, strike two. Completely disgusted I told my friend I was going to chipotle next door. The owner working the register not only didn't ask if I wanted anything or if there was a reason I was walking out without buying anything he didn't even acknowledge me, strike three. How can you have a business that doesn't engage its customers. Money in your pocket is walking out the door, I guess they don't care.  In regards to the food which I will never eat after the awful customer service my friend told me it was average and the fact that adding a veggie is $1 each when you are getting like 4 slices of onions.  I won't be back and neither will my friend. Wish this experience would have went better as I was excited to try a new restaurant in my neighborhood at a location that was vacant for a few years.",0.9648,0.787,0.146,0.067,0.5080419580419581
2016-05-09,5.0,"As far as panzerottis go, this was one of the better ones I had. They make the orders when you order so it isn't fast food but it is good food. I had the Jeanetti. The tomato sauce has a nice sweet flavor to it and the meatballs were moist and delicious. I also like the crust they use as it is nice and flakey. Would eat again.",0.9788,0.691,0.309,0.0,0.7937500000000001
2016-05-03,4.0,"I never write Yelp reviews, but I figured I would to support a local small business. After all, I am a self employed person myself, and I live in the neighborhood. I ordered the panzerotti with meatballs. The meatballs tasted like they weren't frozen garbage and were made fresh. I got mushrooms, spinach leaves, and hot peppers in my pizza pocket. I think some people might prefer these raw veggies to be sautéed in some garlic / oil to follow the Italian theme of this restaurant. The hot peppers were the pickled variety, which is common in Chicago.  As an aside, I ate here on the 2nd day of opening. The owner and staff of the restaurant seem to of had a dismissive attitude, which others noted as well. I am going to give them the benefit of the doubt and assume it is due to the stress of the restaurant industry in general. However, since this is the hospitality industry I cannot give them 5 stars due to this. I was trying to talk to them about the business, but they didn't seem to want to talk to me. So much for sharing the excitement of a new local small business opening... I was told to sit down like I am a child, and I had to sit and stare at the wall while I waited for my food to be prepared. This normally wouldn't of bothered me, however the restaurant was empty except for me and the staff. They should definitely get into GrubHub take out / delivery or something similar. A lot of people in this neighborhood love to have their food delivered to them. Also, they should really do something with their store front to catch people's eyes and make them think about coming to them instead of Chipotle.",0.9869,0.833,0.134,0.033,0.3960405335405335
2016-05-02,4.0,"Stopped by the restaurant today, apparently it's their third day so I can assume they're still tweaking things.  Even though they've been open less than a week things are looking (and tasting promising). I've never had a panzerotti before so I wasn't quite sure what to expect, or even how to eat it.. fork & knife? Hands?  I think the best way to describe it is a small calzone.  There were a lot of toppings to choose from at the counter which resembles the familiar made-to-order fast food assembly line concept popular for 'healthy-fresh' offerings.  I ended up taking one of the suggested menu items which was a panzerotti with cheese, meatballs and tomato sauce. Even though I've never had a panzerroti I had a pretty good idea of what a baked bread, tomato, cheese and meatball sandwich should taste like and the food delivered on that expectation.  The tomato sauce was fresh and I saw one of the staff working the dough so I'm going to assume a lot of the items are freshly made. The portion size was just right, I left feeling satisfied without being stuffed.  My total order came out to a little over $11 which included a fountain drink.  Mentally, breaking the $10 lunch barrier is tough for me when I'm out to get a quick bite.  That being said I do understand that it's 2016 and rent+insurance+payroll+healthcare+food costs make it difficult to get a lunch down to under $10, especially for small non-franchised businesses just starting out.  It doesn't help that our sales tax is over 10% either..  Despite this I think they need to work out some kind of $9-$10 combo deal (food+drink) for some of the more basic panzerotti offerings. Either that or find some low food cost starter you can throw into the combo (garlic bread knots?) so people feel that they're getting something worth $10+. The space itself is clean and nice.  It looks sort of modern industrial.  There are a bunch of communal tables which I personally happen to like but I know a lot of people dislike.  Perhaps if people in Chicago learned how to use inside voices this wouldn't be a problem.  The owner let me know they're working on their sidewalk permit which should be nice once it finally warms up. I'm going to give this a solid four stars, especially considering how new they are.  Service was good, food was fresh, decor suits the concept and price-point.  It's nice to see these non-chain stores opening in the neighborhood.  Panz is a welcome addition to my lunch time spot rotation.",0.9828,0.861,0.107,0.032,0.5541964677834245
2016-04-30,4.0,"Panz recently opened in the East Lakeview area. They exclusively serve Panzerotti which is pastry similar to a calzone, but a bit smaller and lighter.  We got a meatball Panzerotti with sauce, cheese, onion and green pepper. And a make your own with sauce, cheese, pepperoni and onion. Both were very good, the dough is amazing and ingredients are fresh. We definitely could have shared one, as the portions are very big. Expect a 5-6 minute cook time, they have 2 TV's playing sports which is nice. The two Panzerottis and one fountain drink came to around $23, which seemed a bit high, but the quality of ingredients made up for it.  The owner and workers were extremely nice and friendly. We will definitely be back!",0.99,0.745,0.255,0.0,0.5533333333333333
