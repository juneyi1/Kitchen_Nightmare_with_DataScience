I wish Yelp had more options other than just a five start over all review. The customer service and manger were a 10 plus for the night. The waitress that took my order was also a delight. She recommended a great wine selection and dishes off the menu. Started out with a crisp glass of Care Bread 13, Chardonnay paired with pipping hot Lump Crab, Roasted Shrimp & Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms under a Parmesan-panko crust. To DIE for! They were absolutely delish plus small enough where you weren't to full for dinner. Moving on to the main dish, another amazing glass of wine that complemented my fish selection perfect. Went with Spy Valley 14, Savignac Blanc paired with the chef selection that was recommend Asian -Glazed  Chilean Sea Bass Entrée over a organic black rice, snow peas, shiitake mushrooms, micro wasabi.

Came to this location for the first time on a Wednesday night for an early dinner (6:15) and the place was pretty empty. Guess I didn't need to make a reservation. My friend & I decided to split a bunch of things because we couldn't decide- everything looked so good: Ambiance- Great! Large booths, dimly lit room but not too dim. Easy to have a conversation with your tablemates. Also our waiter was really friendly and didn't rush us as we were catching up and took awhile to order each course, but was always available when we were ready to order. Artichoke & Goat Cheese Flatbread- Delicious! Flavors worked very well together, the cheese wasn't too heavy and the crust was very very light Stuffed Mushrooms (seasonal) - So good! Very heavy spinach flavor for the stuffing but if you like Spinach, then this is your dish. Comes with 3, so not the easiest to split with 2 as it was messy to cut in half. Asian Glazed Grilled Chicken Skewers- Great! Also comes with 3 but easier to split as we just cut the 3rd skewer in half. Chilean Sea Bass- Comparable to the Sea Bass I got from Joe`s. Fantastic! Came on a bed of black rice which neither of us had ever had which was quite good, and some snow peas. Only recommendation would be more snowpeas. I love this place.

Flatbreads are featured heavy on their menu, but there are no complaints from this girl. Each flatbread was just as delicious as the one before it - my favorite was the one with arugula! The wonderful part of the flatbreads was that they each had a wine pairing that was perfect. In terms of food, the other exciting features to the menu are the butternut squash ravioli with sweet potatoes and the glazed chicken skewers. Those ravioli were so delicious and the chicken was so perfectly cooked that it just easily came apart when you went to go in for a bite (I hate it when the food on skewers is overcooked and tough). Although I love good food my favorite parts of the event were the two cocktails featured. The pair cocktail was delicious! If you go you must try it! Not too sweet at all.  But the real knockout was the Pisco Sour. Pisco is an amber colored brandy made in the winemaking regions of Peru and Chile. The sour part comes from the citrus juices. I loved this drink because it brought back memories of sitting on the patio of a fancy restaurant in the Miraflores district of Lima, Peru, sipping on my first Pisco Sour, just a day after I had landed. The drink is amazing and it seemed pretty authentic - although it wasn't as strong as any cocktail I had in Peru.  Overall, this was a wonderful opportunity and the food and company were wonderful!

They looked like lamb chops but tasted like pork and I haven't been able to find a likelier item on the menu. Anyways, these mystery chops were also delicious and juicy despite being enigmatic.  Off the wine flight selections, I enjoyed the Montevina Pinot Grigio the most. The riesling offered was on the sweet side but well-balanced. Their reds were more alcohol-forward but soft mouthfeel. Their flatbreads were of the thin crisp variety rather than the chewy bread kind but generously decked with toppings. Favorites were: Roasted Roma Tomato, Blackened Steak and Blue Cheese, and the Trio of Roasted Mushrooms flatbread.  Off the Autumn Dinner menu, the Porcini Mushroom Bisque didn't look attractive but was very good. The Caramelized Brussel Sprouts were much more exciting than the Roasted Acorn Squash. Finally, Kabocha Squash Ravioli were al dente on the outside but filled with scalding hot nutty orange sweet goodness. Eat with caution but gusto.  Staff was uniformly friendly and competent despite being surrounded by excitable Yelpers!",0.9941,0.774,0.19,0.037,0.6289080459770114
2015-08-31,4.0,Came here for a yelp elite event and what a good experience. The event itself was that we would get a tasting of the fall menu. So we started out with sampling all sorts of flatbreads that I can't remember the names of because they were so good. I do know that there was a mushroom one and a steak with blue cheese flatbread that I couldn't stop eating. The mushroom soup was also delicious: lots of flavor and not too filling. There was then some grilled butternut squash and some other vegetables: pretty well done. I will say that the entrees or what I would assume would be entrees on the actual menu were soo good. The chicken skewer had a good glaze that didn't overpower the actual taste of the chicken. The lamb chop was so tender; I don't think I've had a better one. The ravioli with squash and walnuts was such an interesting but well thought out mix of flavors. There were also tastings of wine and cocktails but since I'm not much of a drinker I didn't really try any but the yelpers I met enjoyed them. I must say that the service here is great. The staff took the time to explain what everything was and they were super nice. Definitely want to come back for the full restaurant experience!,0.9906,0.81,0.19,0.0,0.5434027777777778

We tried the new fall menu, which includes: three mushroom soup, pesto chicken flatbread, lobster flatbread, steak flatbread, mushroom flatbread, tomato pesto flatbread, artichoke flatbread, cheese and squash ravioli, teriyaki chicken screwers, seasoned squash, brussels sprouts and lamb chops. Each of the dishes came with an accompanying wine, which were complimentary together.  The food was unbelievably delicious. Compliments to the chef! Everyone was seasoned beautiful and the fall presence was felt through each bite. My favorite was the lobster flatbread and chicken screwers. The mushroom soup was very good, and tasted great. The rest of the flatbreads were nice as well. The lamb chops were cooked to perfection (medium well) with a slight grilled char on the outside, I would say it was a bit salty but besides that excellent nonetheless.  The interior is beautiful. An elegant and upscale dining experience. One of the best steakhouses in Chicago by far.  The waiting staff and manager were excellent. The service was fast, friendly and efficient.

The staff is attentive. My dining partner and I split two flatbreads which provided some variation.  The flatbread is enough for a light lunch but to eat the whole thing is a bit boring.  The artichoke and goat cheese flatbread was very flavorful; the seasonal flatbread with bacon, fig and arugula had no shortage of greens but the bacon flavor just didn't come through and there was little visual evidence of bacon.   Lunch prices are reasonable for the River North neighborhood but I think that there are more interesting menus at this price point in the neighborhood.  The desserts weren't offered to us (did we look like we were in a hurry or not interested?) but are attractively presented on a tray to entice diners who want an indulgence of 400 calories or less.  By the way, I do like the fact that calories are shown on the menu.",0.9056,0.85,0.107,0.043,0.5019047619047619

2015-07-19,3.0,This review is about 6 months later than my actual experience because it dawned on me that I never wrote a review for this place.  Better late than never! Solid three stars from me.  This restaurant felt very corporate-chain-y and geared toward more mature patrons.  It was something that less adventuresome eaters would enjoy as the menu was pretty generic and the wine pours were plentiful. I'm just not a big fan of the corporate chains I guess. We sampled a bunch of things from the happy hour menu as we were in here after work in a large group a while back.

2015-07-04,4.0,"Made sure we had reservations for a Saturday night dinner but it was not packed at all. A very quiet scene that was more filled with the older crowd. The flat breads were really good for appetizer and reasonably priced. It threw me off a little because everything that was raved about on yelp wasn't on their menu anymore, since they change their menu weekly depending on what ingredients they have. Their dishes were not cheap but it was mostly seafood or nice meats. My food was alright and my friends who got scallops or pasta liked it, but found that the vegetables on the side were funky or hard to chew. I kind of wish I just ordered another flatbread. They have a bunch of cute dessert shooters to choose from and anyone who's birthday it is gets one for free! We tried almost all of them and thought they were pretty good, just a nice little touch to end your meal on a sweet note. I think part of the reason why I couldn't wrap my head around how this restaurant is supposed to be really nice is just because I hear it's related to Olive Garden but at the end of the day the food was pretty good - there's nothing else on the menu that would really draw me back right now, but if I had to go again for some occasion, I know I could find something edible to eat (although will probably be $20+)",0.996,0.773,0.215,0.011,0.6416529830322933

Our server, Nathaniel was thorough, he just needed to check in on us more often.  Full disclosure: I drank a glass of beer and downed a Pinot Noir on an empty stomach, prior to eating... So maybe my palette wasn't 100% accurate at the time... But im pretty sure the food was good, which accounts for the full 3 stars.  I ordered lamb (medium) and he ordered NY strip steak (medium rare). Perfectly cooked and seasoned/garnished.  Dessert was pretty good as well. They have a cute set-up where they bring you all of their desserts in shot glasses and you choose which one you want.  The place needs a bit updating, it looks like a step above Olive Garden... But their service and attentiveness at Olive Garden is actually better. they had a hostess who was taking people to their tables, so right before us she took a couple to their table and took FOREVER to get back to the front and service us. They should have the hostess stay int he front and have the servers take the people to their table. We almost left -- we already waited enough at Purple Pig.

But (and this is an important but), we didn't realize it was part of the same family as Red Lobster and Olive Garden until after the second time we'd eaten here. The only real indication of it being part of the chain lies in the complete nutritional information they provide for their dishes...and this I appreciate, as I need to limit sodium in my diet.

I'd wished there was more risotto so that I would've felt fully satisfied. I think it's a little pricey for what it is. The scallop dish and a glass of wine cost me $35.

We couldn't get out of there without trying some of their mini desserts and selected three. Ginger snap pumpkin, chocolate peanut butter, and S'mores were put to the test. My favorite was the spiced pumpkin and my wife preferred the s'mores... but the peanut butter was also good.

We walked in and was greeted by two welcoming hostesses and made a reservation for 8pm. We had some good wine and started out with a delicious three mushroom flatbread as appetizer. Then a couple of two different green salads that we both thought it was too much but too scrumptious to not finish. My friend had the trout with seasoned steamed baby potatoes and some other side dish. I had the swordfish dish and we both enjoyed our entree very much. The only regret I have is not having room for dessert. I should have just gone for it. The whole meal was astonishing. Our server Patrick was the best, nice, respectful, and very informative about the food (ingredients) and even the establishment. They have a live singer who plays the piano as well. Her voice was quite good matter of fact for all sorts of songs she sang that night. Overall it was the best dinner for a last night of my visit in Chicago.

I purchased a gilt city special which included a four course meal for two plus a specialty cocktail for each of us. We started with this squash soup, followed by chicken flatbread. Next I chose the braised beef tacos and my lunch date had chose a separate entree. He also had a pomegranate martini while I had a paradise martini. Then I had a chocolate martini with my dessert.  Now I purposely menu listed what we enjoyed instead of writing about how each item tasted. The reason I did so is because EVERYTHING was phenomenally fresh, well mixed, cooked perfectly. Our waiter showed us total attentiveness and gave his honest opinion on what was popular, etc. I would surely pay the regular menu prices next time because this place is worth it.

The atmosphere is low key and perfect if you need to unwind after a long day, have a date night, or a girl's night out! The wine selection is exquisite, no matter what you type of wine you like, they will have something you love here! And be sure to check out the wine descriptions at this location, the manager was also a sommelier at some point in her career and her descriptions are extremely entertaining!  The food was amazing (as always)! Our waiter was wonderful, we found out at the end of our meal that it was only his 2nd week working there, none of us ever would have guessed it with how knowledgable he was with both the drink and food menu as well as his service. The menu changes often (hence the name), the food is always fresh and on the low calorie side but full of flavor!!! And then, last but certainly not least is the dessert. I get hungry just thinking about it! They bring a variety of desserts to choose from that come in little glass ""shooters"" and they are to die for! Do not skip dessert! You can also get a few different ones to share if you are in a group which is nice. My fav...the pecan pie...sooooo good!!!!

Their menu changes by the season (hence the name) and your taste buds dance along to the live music that they have nightly. *angels singing* My friend and I started off our dinner the right way - with wine flights. BOOZE!!! I had the white wine flight that consisted of a Rose, a Pinot and a Riesling. Deslish! I also decided to try their Port wine, which was a 10 year aged Tawny Port. Totally savory! The red wine flight that my friend had was awesome as well and the best thing about it? You get a full glass of whichever wine was your favorite. Didnt like any in the flight? They'll almost for certain give you a glass of whatever you prefer. BOOZE! For dinner, I chose the Shrimp Cavatappi Pasta. Im not a huge fan of veggies, but this dish consisted of roasted tomatoes, mushrooms, broccolini and peppers and  I almost bit my fingers off devouring this dish. You can definitely tell that everything is fresh and in-season - from the shrimp to the veggies. Im sure that they have their own personal shrimp-swimmer-catcher'er!! The Salmon that my friend had was roasted on a cedar plank and was cooked to perfection. I couldve totally been a beaver and ate the wood plank that it was cooked on (Okay I know Beavers dont EAT wood) Dont judge me.  If I had of had room for desert, Im sure it wouldve been a scrumptious as everything else.  Seasons 52 is a definite go to for a semi-upscale, relaxing, dining experience.

2014-08-17,4.0,"Making the reservations was simple, and the website was easy to navigate. You could find the menu, wines, and address easily. As we were driving to the restaurant, which is located on Grand and Rush, we did not see the valet. We went to a public parking place and ended up paying $27 instead of the $14 for valet, but no one was outside when we drove by so we just assumed there was no valet. As we were walking to the restaurant from the parking building we really could not see their signs, a recommendation would be to enlarge the signs so you could see them clearly across the street.    When we entered the restaurant there were three hosts who welcomed us and asked if we had a reservation. As we were led to our seats, beautiful music filled my ears. A man behind the bar sat behind his piano. His fingers danced to the melody they were creating while he sang. The ambiance was just beautiful in the restaurant. It was all a stone and dark wood theme. It was enchanting. When she was seating us she did make casual 'weather' conversation to the table, complemented me on my dress, and pulled out a chair for me. She did not mention the server's name when seating us. It took the server around 7 minutes to come and acknowledge us. He did ask if this was our first time which was nice and explained the Seasons 52 theme and how they change their menu. He also mentioned the desserts because they are known for their presentation of desserts. There uniform was a bit odd because it was just plain black pants and a black t-shirt, it seemed too casual for me.   Taking the order he asked about cocktails first, but we did not get any. He then he asked about other drinks like beer, wine, or teas. Since I am not 21, I did not order alcohol but the person I was with did order a Cabernet Savion, which he said was one of the best he has ever tried. The server did not ask about allergies or dietary restrictions before taking our order, which could pose as a health hazard to customers. When it came to the appetizer he suggested a few and we went with the Tandoori-Style Grilled Chicken Skewers tropical chutney, cucumber raita, which was very flavorful and delicious. He checked back on us within the 2 minutes/2 bits rule. Then once we were done we ordered the entrees and I ordered the Oak-Grilled Filet Mignon with cremini mushrooms, steamed leaf spinach, mashed potatoes, red wine sauce, but I did not want the mushrooms so he suggested brocolini. I was not sure what it was and he explained it as longer broccoli like vegetables. The other person I went with ordered the Oak-Grilled Rack of Lamb spring vegetables, yukon Gold mashed potatoes, and shallot jus. This took about 17 minutes to cook and bring to the table that was brought by a food runner I am assuming. He almost forgot to bring out steak knives before the meal. The meal was delicious and and everything was cooked to perfection pretty much, well at least the way we asked. When we had polished off our meal, the waiter returned he was sure we were finished, but he did not take the dishes to our right. He only cleared the dishes in front of us.   When it came to desserts a different waiter presented the desserts to us because he has a party of 15 he was taking care of at the moment. They severed mini indulgences, which were just a longer shot glass filled with the cake, filling, or cream based dessert. We ordered the Mocha Macchiato and the Belgian Chocolate S'more. The sweet flavors filled my mouth upon contact with my taste buds. The server never came and refilled my water and did not check up on us during dessert. When the check was brought he charged us for 5 extra desserts we did not order so we had to wait around for that.",0.9967,0.858,0.114,0.028,0.5708937198067633

Having been to Seasons in Schaumburg, I knew their  organic and locally sourced food would be a hit, and the quiet ambiance of a private room was perfect for us.  It was easy to book for a private party, I just had to fill out an online form and return a PDF to show intent to save the date. This location's dining layout isn't quite as expansive as the Schaumburg location, but you'll find warm wood toned booths and tables, and this location is near the heart of River North shopping and dining.   For group dining Seasons 52 has a few different Prix Fixe choices, and I went with the Pinot Noir menu. The menu gave us lots of options, but we all ate: Flatbreads- Roasted Roma Tomato, and Grilled Garlic Chicken Pesto were both great Salad- Crisp Romaine and Kale Caesar, a great take on a Caesar Then we got to choose between: Herb-Roasted Chicken, Wood-Roasted Pork Tenderloin, Cedar Plank Roasted Salmon  I chose the salmon, which came with a nice side of roasted potatoes and carrots. The salmon was excellent and it was a popular choice among our group.  Service was very good- they constantly checked in to see if the room temp was good, if we wanted music piped into the room, and recommended great wine pairings. The only tip I would add for groups is to introduce the restaurant's unique mission to the group, and also explain what would be brought out family style, and what the diners could choose for themselves.

Our server, Jeff, was very friendly from the start, knowledgable about the menu, and courteous.  The atmosphere was calm and had a warm feel to it.

We decided to change our minds and go with Seasons 52 (Mostly because they had open reservations last minute on a Saturday night!). It was not a bad choice. I had salmon and my wife had chicken. We had a flatbread as an appetizer with prosciutto and asparagus that was really good! In my mind it seemed like it was pricey just because it was Chicago. I feel as though I could have gotten the same meal downstate for half the price. With that said, our waitress was really nice and did a good job of seeing to our needs the entire time we were there. The atmosphere was pleasant and made for an enjoyable evening out.

2014-06-21,3.0,"This place has a pretty cool vibe. There is live music in the front, which on the night that we were there was something to avoid. The guy was singing off key and kind of yelling. Not the best atmosphere while you are drinking a glass of good wine. I had the Grilled Garlic Pesto Chicken flatbread for an appetizer. It was good, but not great. I know that this is a low-fat, healthier place, and given that specialization, the flatbread was flavorful. What was it missing? Uh, fat. Give me some more olive oil if you are not going to layer it in cheese. My wife had Lump Crab, Roasted Shrimp & Spinach Stuffed Mushrooms for her appetizer. Again, because the dish had so little fat (some parmesan cheese), the spinach's wateriness dulled the flavor. Again, it was tasty for what it was trying to be, but it was definitely not the best stuffed mushroom that i have had. For our entrees we had the grilled trout and the filet mignon. I hate to sound like a broken record, and I KNOW I was at a lower fat restaurant, but the red wine sauce for the filet was missing something--BUTTER! And the trout was a little dry. Finally, this place prides itself on its wine pairings. Our waitress, however, didn't seem to know very much about wine. I knew more than she did. The wines are good, don't get me wrong; but when I look for a recommendation, I want to try something that I might not order on my own, rather than have a waitress tell me, ""Well the Cab is really good with red meat."" No kidding, Nancy Drew. Overall, if you are limited in your diet, this is a good place to get a good, tasty, healthy meal with a decent wine list. If you're like me and you would miss the fat, even if your doctor would recommend that you eat less, I would try somewhere else and spend another 45 minutes on the elliptical.",0.969,0.762,0.15,0.088,0.5239510939510941

We both had the petite filet with a side of asparagus.  The meat was tender and cut like butter.  The preparation was simple and clean. Usually, we don't order dessert.

All started out well; service was great in the beginning, got our wine and flat-breads in record speed, but then things went downhill.  The chef came out and asked how we enjoyed the flat-breads (which they were amazing), and then said the soup would be right up.  Right up, meaning 45 mins later...finally that showed up (come on how long can it take to pour soup into a bowl).  Then the waitress came out to clear the soup bowls and mentioned to us that we would have to pick a different salad or appetizer since the kitchen ran out of pears for the pear salad.  Then miraculously the pears appeared 20 mins later so we ended up getting the pear salad (I'm sure someone ran to Jewel quick to buy them out of pears...which was fine because the salad was great).  Before the entrees showed up, the chef made an appearance yet again to apologize about the slowness of the service saying our entree's would be right up. At that time I wanted to ask the chef politely to please box up our entrees and dessert so we could leave since we had been sitting there for 2 hours already.

By that time people in my group were getting annoyed with the slow service and just wanted to get dessert and take off.  All while this was going on, I was watching the tables around us...they got served right away, ate and left (and I can imagine they were all dining for restaurant week as well).  Finally when we got dessert, it was about 2 hours and 45 mins after we got seated.  I am fine with a 3 hour dining experience if I'm in Europe or taking a client out for dinner...but with a group of friends that had to work the next day...I would have been fine with 2 hours.  Finally Jesse the Manager stopped by our table and apologized for the service and the slow kitchen.  He then handed us a $25 gift card (that had to be used by 2/14) and couldn't be used that night.  It was a nice gesture, but I don't think anyone in my group will be returning anytime soon.",0.9912,0.865,0.114,0.021,0.6042403628117914

2014-02-02,4.0,"We tried out Seasons 52 on a snowy cold Saturday lunch. We went quite late so the restaurant was empty. We received a gift certificate of $35 so we thought we would try it out. The restaurant is big, with a very wooden feel with many wine bottles displayed around the seating area. I ordered a flatbread pizza (grilled chicken) which I highly recommend, as it was thin and crispy with the right amount of topping. I also got the tuna burger which was tasty as well with a wasabi mayo sauce accompanying it. The prices of the dishes are very reasonable and it helps knowing that every dish is below 475 calories! I also had the roasted potatoes as a side. That was probably the only dish that I would think had lost a little on taste due to trying to keep below the 475 calories as they were roasted instead of fried but still very tasty. The service was perfect, we had a friendly server that was very knowledgable that recommended us a couple of dishes. At the end the meal she brought out the mini indulgence desserts very well displayed which would tempt any person to try one! Great place for those health conscious people trying to eat reasonably sized portions.",0.9776,0.859,0.127,0.014,0.5673051948051949
2014-02-01,5.0,"I have never left a Seasons 52 disappointed, and today was no different. We came for their restaurant week lunch menu and for $22 a person it is a ton of food. Healthy and delicious food at that. We each ordered flatbreads for course one; Roma tomato mozzarella and garlic pesto chicken so we could share. I was almost full just after eating those! For my main course I got the braised mole beef tacos that had jalapeño cilantro lime slaw, pickled red onions, guacamole, and a tomatillo salsa on the side. I could eat those every single day and be happy. As my choice of a side I got the quinoa and citrus grains salad. I wasn't as crazy for that simply because it had dried cherries which I don't care for and clashed with tacos.  My husband got the ahi tuna crunch salad with roasted potato wedges and he loved all of it. I tried the fries and they were perfect. Baked, not fried but still with wonderful flavor and a nice crispy exterior. We were pretty much ready to burst at this point, but alas we still had dessert. They are mini dessert shooters, so trust me you have room even if you think you are full! I got the mocha macchiato one with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and a yummy shaved chocolate straw. My husband got the pecan pie one and it was very rich. At dinner our waitress said the restaurant week menu is five courses so my advice is come hungry. This is by far one of our favorite restaurants in the city. They change their menu seasonally so they can highlight items at their peak making each meal extra special.

When we got there, no valet guy was to be found, and the hostess was completely clueless and said we should park in the parking lot. When we walked in after parking, we were immediately greeted and the hostess told us they would be able to validate our parking for a discount. When we left, their ""validation"" was simply giving us cash to pay for the parking. Nice save!  Now about the meal. Service was awesome! The waitress and every one who helped service our table were extremely nice. But why three stars you ask? Well, the highlight of the meal was the flatbread we ordered as our appetizer. All the food that came after was mediocre. Portions were huge and flavors were okay. The boys ordered bison burgers; eh it was okay. Nothing special, a little on the dry side. The potato wedges that came with the order tasted chewy, a very odd texture for potato wedges. My sister and I each ordered a salad. Decent, but nothing to rave about. And my other friend ordered the mole tacos, which were just okay.  In addition to our gargantuous meal, we opted to try the tamale tots and Fuji apple slaw. The tamale tots were mushy. Not at all what we were expecting. The Fuji apple slaw was delicious, a tad bit on the sweet side though. Lastly, desserts. We were pretty stuffed at this point, but had to still taste the desserts. Not bad, but I would say choose chocolate anything. They were pretty solid.  All in all, food was okay.

Out waiter (Heather) was very helpful and friendly, with just the right amount of attention and helpful input on choices. We were surprised by the spinach salad, which was quite large. It was reasonably dressed and tasty. The beef tacos were nicely spicy without being overbearing; they seemed to have enough filling for a full-size taco in a slightly smaller shell. The green salsa provided a nice extra punch. The chicken also came with a nice sauce and was a fairly large serving. The potato wedges came with a very nice dipping sauce. And we love the mini-desserts, which are small enough to eat more than one, if you're so inclined, without feeling too guilty about it.

Pros: -Nice ambience, interior to the restaurant; there was even a piano man during the meal -You get your money's worth on the RW menu  -The steak and bleu cheese flatbread was very good -The individual dessert servings were tasty and refreshing Cons: -Too much food on the RW menu, so we were pretty much full by the time our entrees came out.  A tasting menu should be an appropriate amount of food picked out by the restaurant -The seafood tasted 'off' -- like funky crab or something -- in the stuffed mushrooms -The soup was like a french onion with beef chunks, which didn't pack much flavor -I experienced one of the worst food poisonings in my life.  My girlfriend and I shared everything besides our entrees (I had the filet, and she had the salmon), so I imagine the filet was the issue.  The filet looked like a good piece of meat, cooked how I requested it, but it was covered in a 'red wine sauce' that reminded me of a salisbury steak from middle school.  Why take a nice piece of meat and cover it with a glaze?  Let it speak for itself if it's a good cut.  When we left the restaurant, I thought I was just uncomfortably full, but instead I got uncontrollably sick. Thoughts: RW is usually a good way to try a restaurant and get a good feel for the place.  Initially, I thought Seasons 52 was decent, but after not being able to sleep for more than an hour last night, I will not be returning.",0.8871,0.819,0.114,0.068,0.49294745484400654

2014-01-19,3.0,"Friday night and we need a spot to check out.  With the new year and new resolutions to eat healthier and blah, blah, blah, I guess we were looking for something a bit healthier to check out.   And whaddaya know, we had a nice mailer that gave us $35 off at Seasons 52, a reasonably new addition to Chicago, Seasons 52 is a nationwide upscale dining chain, with a focus on natural ingredients and comfort foods. It's big schtick is that all of their dishes are under 440 calories, which in a world that is increasingly more health-conscious, is a pretty good schtick to have.  Looking down the standard menu, there's a pretty good variety of dishes that are clearly healthier and easy to keep in that calorie range, and they save some calories with some of the entree-type dishes by cutting back on portion sizes and shrinking the role of the carb-heavy sides.  On top of the standard menu, there were a number of seasonal specials that were extremely enticing as well. In the end, we each got an entree and split an appetizer, so to get a dinner meal knowing that it was under 660 calories was a bonus.  Started with the lobster, scallion, and sweet pepper flatbread that had a good mix of flavors and textures.  The lobster was chopped pretty small, but added a good meatiness, but lacked a bit of flavor.  The scallions had a nice sharp bite, and the sweet peppers balanced the dish out with a softer texture.  The flatbread itself was nice and thin with a good crisp, slightly burnt crust. For entree #1, we  got the Mesquite-grilled garlic shrimp with saffron-chorizo risotto - good portion size.  It had a nice char, but in the process, the shrimp was a bit overcooked, so it lacked that soft meatiness.  The flavor itself was a subtle garlicky, and the supporting players - the risotto and broccolini were pretty average.  The risotto was a bit gummy and overcooked, and heavy on olives, which overpowered the dish, and there's not much to say about broccolini - simple preparation The second entree was a whole roasted branzino (the smallest branzino I've seen) from the specials menu - In the end, it was much better than the above dish.  While the portion size was small, it was solidly cooked. Branzino is a Mediterranean seabass, mostly found in Italian dishes.  It has a soft, buttery texture, and at Seasons, they topped it off with a lemon butter that added to the overall smoothness of the fish (and again, it's under 440 calories!).  The supporting cast - a trio of roasted white and purple potatoes and some grilled broccolini and red peppers were simple but a solid addition to the dish. The desserts at Seasons are also under 440 calories, but that's because they serve them in shot glasses. There was a good mix, but we passed on dessert, as Eataly, a block north, was calling our name.   In the end, Seasons 52 is a great idea, but the prices unfortunately don't always drop to the extent that the portion sizes do, which make it difficult to justify the cost if I'm paying full price.   Thankfully, with the mailer, the total bill with tax and tip came out to well under $50. eatinginchicago2014.word…",0.9974,0.811,0.164,0.026,0.5002626713564216

I wanted to sit down and warm up after walking a few blocks in the blustery weather that was hitting the city that day, but it was only a 4 min wait or so.

Being located downtown surrounded by so many hotels and offices you would think that this place would have a steady flow of customers, but the place was pretty much dead.

Sitting at the bar you wouldn't know that this was just the 3rd night of Seasons 52's infancy in the Grand/Mag mile area.  They were pouring drinks and chatting up customers like it has been a Chicago local spot for years.  A friendly, and experienced group indeed.  Just a great overall feel to the place.  If your lady, or feminine man needs a foo foo drink, try the superfruit martini.  Its delightful, so my wife says. It was time to move from the bar (my favorite place in a restaurant for a multitude of reasons) to the dining area.  Our server was Carlo who was outstanding, and had a good grasp of the menu ans their specials which fitted fall like a glass slipper on a Disney princess.  Hmmm, I am going to lose my man card with that last comment.  How about fitted fall like a freshly tapped hand fits a boxing glove.  Anyhow, I typically don't go with specials for some reason, but tonight something in the air said be wild.  I unleashed the beast within me, and went for the flappy part of the menu (you know the real narrow piece with the specials on it) and I went special.  We started with the truffled mushroom flatbread which was fantastic, and had the crab/shrimp shrooms as well.  Both were great.  The flatbread was very rustic with its hearty shrooms, a nearly non existent amount of truffle oil (would have liked to taste more) and its roasted garlic chunks.  All in all it was great.  The stuffed shrooms were great as well, and they are served in a cool round thingy that was made for the dish.  They imported them from a small village in the Andes where the villagers make these by hand.  Its a 1000 year old tradition, and is created by very primitive tools/means.  Its amazing.  Underneath the dish you can even see the carvings by the exact villager who created it!  They have one at the Chicago Field Museum that talks all about the process. On to the dinner, and I was totally kidding about the villagers making the dish thing.  I went with the quail special.  It was good.  Gamey, nice glaze, and some tasty risotto.  Oh yeah, there was spinach and some pearl onions on there as well, all equally tasty.  My wife got a salad (I know right?) which she really enjoyed.  It's a salad, and I didn't eat it so I am not gougn  Now the desert part.  Carlo, the devil he is, brought out some serious evil with the little dessert shots.  I went with the pumpkin pie which was off the chain, and my wife got the pecan pie.  Both were outstanding, and really don't make you feel too bad because they are in large shot glasses.  This actually brings me back to something cool that Carlo (that desert slinging monster) said.  All of the dinners at Seasons 52 are 475 cals or less.  Yeah, you can eat a plate of food here that is only 100 cals higher than the pumpkin latte from Starbucks that you gulped down this morning.  Impressive huh.  I thought so. Any new restaurant is not without its flaws and hiccups.  Seasons had some very minor ones, and they are more than apologetic/aware.  At the same time, the restaurant had a 90 minute wait, and was wall to wall packed.  Not sure how high your expectations are, but to run a place effectively as they did without being open for a week is pretty rockstar in my book.  Kudos to the crew that came in from out of the other restaurants to get this one up and running! Good job Seasons 52 glad we visited!",0.9994,0.75,0.221,0.029,0.5433261183261182
2013-10-20,4.0,"My colleagues and I have been wanting to try the original location in the burbs, but were excited to find out they opened a spot downtown, conveniently near the Grand- Red Line.  Incidentally, we visited on opening night.  My colleague made reservations online easily.  Despite running 20 mins late, we were seated immediately. Our server was super friendly and enthusiastic about the menu.  I couldn't believe all the menu items were under 475 calories.  The cedar-planked roasted salmon with vegetables was delicious.  One friend had the roasted half-chicken and the other friend had the pork tenderloin.  Both dishes were also fantastic. The best part was the dessert sampler.  The server brought a display of the ""mini-indulgences"" which were the perfect dessert portions.  They had a great variety to offer from chocolate-based to fruit-based.  We each sampled one, the best being the mocha macchiato, followed by the pumpkin pie with the gingersnap crust, then the raspberry chocolate chip cannoli, which was a distant third. Great place to grab a healthy dinner made of fresh ingredients in reasonable portion sizes.",0.998,0.655,0.34,0.006,0.5967391304347827
