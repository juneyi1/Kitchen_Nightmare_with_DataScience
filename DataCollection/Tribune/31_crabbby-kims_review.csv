2015-01-26,2.0,"Much like the seasoning of aged skin, time hasn't been too good, to Crabbby Kim.  A few updates..  They updated their bar!  A nicer look but still an odd experience.  However, they didn't update their washrooms??  Still cesspools of hate, angst and the possibility of a ""jail-house-butt-raping.""  The square footage in those tiny washrooms; if one were to get stuck in there... it'd be psychological I tell ya. Another update is that I haven't seen a bikini in here in over a year!  I wonder if Feminists are clapping.  =)  What happened? Who knows.  This isn't one of my usual stops but when our bowling league is in play, the guys might like to arrange a meetup over here to see how the ladies of the team take it.  Childish? Definitely, except for those times when it's the ladies requesting we meet there for drinks.   Of the bars nearby this one serves food and chips and fries are made fresh at the time of order.  (Or frozen fries and freshly fried chips for salsa)  On a few trips, slow cookers were going with something interesting bubbling inside adding a new scent to the room. I would guess that due to the economy within their walls, it's taken a turn for the worse.  Way back when, they offered draft beer.  Today they don't and you can see beer spouts missing handles! (To see a draft spout missing handles, is quite depressing.  I guess as depressing as seeing a bikini bar minus the bikini-clad-bartenders)    Beer and booze are available but only beer by the bottle and booze that's stirred.  As I've never seen a cocktail shaken.  Prices are still cheap and they offer specials on both offerings. In the writing of this review, for the sake of shits and giggles, I Google searched for other local bikini bars. In the research results I found the most interesting ""easter egg"" YouTube videos about Crabby Kims!  Who knew they were ""popular"" at one time...  Harlem Shake video:   youtube.com/watch?v=Q8fz…",-0.9213,0.797,0.086,0.117,0.4530748663101605

The drinks are phenomenally, ridiculously cheap, especially considering that they don't use the plastic 2 liter jug stuff here. Kim does not skimp on the quality liquor! I've never had anything I didn't like, which is due in large part to the helpful staff. The women who work here are friendly, helpful, and yes, super pretty.

The food is always really yummy; Paul the cook/manager is awesome at what he does.

Yeah, the clientele can be a little weird, but I've never been made to feel uncomfortable. And from what I've seen of Kim in action, he'd never let a degenerate or asshole wear out his welcome.

It started out as a guys night, and we figured what better way to spend it than at a random bar where the bartenders are in Bikinis.  Sure the service will probably be terrible, the food will be pretty bad, and the drink selection will be weak, if not expensive.  Oh how wrong we were! Upon entering we were surprised at just how divey Crabbby Kim's is, and that's a good thing.  Dark, dingy, small-to-medium sized with no ventilation, it was right up our alley. Next up the service.  Sure they may be in bikinis, but that didn't slow down the two bartenders who make our drinks and took our food orders during the course of the night.  They were quick, attentive, personable, not not trashy whatsoever (a concern one might have knowing your server works in a bikini at a bar). On to the food, now this one was probably the biggest shock of the night.  The special for the evening was Hamburgers & Fries for $3.00, and I'll be damned if that wasn't one of the best (bar) burgers I've ever had in my life, and it didn't hurt that the fries were extra greasy & fried.  The chips for the chips & salsa came out hot and freshly made which was a big surprise as well.  Lastly, the booze.  Call drinks were only $3 and were made strong, which was a heckuva deal.  I'm not sure about beer prices (allergic to that stuff, no really, I am), but judging from my friends multiple rounds the prices must've been more than acceptable. So what I'm trying to get at in my longest yelp review ever is:  Crabbby Kim's is fantastic.  If you're not going, you're missing out. ps: To make the night that much more exceptional, go to Waveland bowl across the street for cosmic bowling, now that was a good nightcap!",0.9906,0.745,0.176,0.079,0.5528817082388512
