2015-02-10,2.0,"Think of a mountain that is majestic and beautiful. Trees, flowers, the American Eagle flying overhead. You can see the snowcaps above the tree line.  Baby cubs playing in the distant valley. Pure bliss! Then out of nowhere a monsterous mudslide destroys all the trees, wipes out all the villages at the bottom of the mountain. All the while you barely escape with your life. Now your asking what does this gotta do with a pizza place? I will tell you. Leading up to my first bite everything was beautiful. Mamma Mia's (MM) is in my neighborhood. Inside the decor is pretty cool. The walls are painted to look like your in a small Italian village. Its clean and cozy. The girls at the counter were polite and professional. They cook your pizza to order even if you get slices no heat lamps. Free Wifi. The best part only $2/ slice. This place was a beautiful thing. Im thinking how it took so long to discover this hidden gem. My first bites. Chomp chomp chomp! *Weird face*  *WTF is that face* Now I know why I didn't know about this place. The crust is simply aweful, wayyy to chewy in places. The sauce is only a small step above Ragu. The ingredients on top did not seem fresh or tasty by any means. All three sides of this piece had crust instead of one where you hold it. Gross!  What looked to be a very promising place turned into a mudslide nightmare.  Unfortunately all the free wifi, $2, nice decor blah blah blah will not save this place from my wrath.

After some mumbo jumbo from the store person about some discount on my next order.  He then offered to go back to the store and retrieve the appetizer, which he did.  I asked him to bring back an up to date menu because clearly the one I had was old.  When he returned he gave me some old Super Bowl menus and said they were out of the other ones....Sure you were.  Clearly, this store makes up its own prices/specials, and lie to customers, then let the driver take the heat.  I'm so glad I did not hassle the driver because he in essence solved the problem.  No help from the store itself.  Needless to say, I will not be ordering from here again.  Service is not the same as before, and the prices are ridiculous ($28 for a 18 inch pizza and 2 liter pop minus chicken strips/fries originally) Then had to wait again for chicken strips, thanks to the driver.",0.974,0.823,0.119,0.058,0.46843033509700166

My sister said most likely the reviews were writen by people who know the workers. Eitherway I will explain why I will never order from here again. I ordered a margherita slice. This is the weirdest crust i have ever seen in my life. It has little holes in and is hard as a rock. Kind of like tostinos pizza when you microwave it... but nastier. When i told tge manager this he said that how our crust is hard when wedo it by the slice. Lol. Im like so u agree it is nasty, lol. Then the fettucine and i paid extra for chicken. The other yelp review said her mom liked it. Dunno what planet her mom was on at the time. The fettucine was perfectly cooked al dente. The sauce was ragu. No lie ... it tasted just like ragu. I told the counter girl this and even the manager even though the girl said no mgr is onsite lol. He was like the chef tasted it, he said it was good. I told him can you in good conscience say this tastes like leonas or olive garden... silence u cant cuz its ragu from a jar. And the chicken needs salt. Did they forget. Then the vodka pasta. It was watery and sure did not taste like rosatis. Worst thing was that meatball. It was so hard!!! Like a rock like over cooked i couldnt explain it, but meatballs r supposed to be tender not like that.  First they were like 20 off ur next order. I was like no cuz im never ordering again. My kid said he wud eat the pizza topping ans the pop give me half back. Then the girl like i cant do it if he  eats.it  lol. Im like pizza 5 im still paying 15 for crappy food. So finally a manager got on the phone althougj supposedly in the beginning they had nomanager. He was argumentative rude and thought he was rite. I told him give me 20 this cover the delivery and wut little we tasted of the food . I gave the delivery guy a tip. So hard lesson learned.

The pizza was supposed to be half sausage and was all sausage which is a no go with vegetarians in the house. Called and they first told me I ordered all sausage until I told them I have the grubhub receipt that clearly says half. They offered 15% off and I said I wanted a new pizza. They said only if they could pick up the old pizza. Which I thought was weird since they just verified they had messed up and I thought at least the meat eaters could eat in the meantime. What do places do with incorrect orders, eat them themselves? So not wanting to make everyone wait an hour I asked for a refund and they said the order isn't really their's it's grubhub's. Hung up and called grubhub and they refunded me for the pizza but we had to make something for the vegetarians to eat.  On to the food. Tasted the wings and not too good. They came with fries which were stale and soggy. As for the incorrectly topped pizza, it was bland, I would say typical at best, also not very hot.

They get our drinks then never come back to take our order so my boyfriend goes up to them and has to place his order up front. Mind you the officers already ordered. Pizza finally comes but our drinks our pretty much empty. No one asks to refill them. I get up snd ask am i suppose to fill these myself..? They say ill fill then and take them to you.. anyways i go sit back down..they bring the drinks.. ling period of time goes by no one checks on us...we are done with our food..so we finally wave someone down can we get a box. Comez back with the box ..no one prints up our bill. Again standing there talking.. like we went there to be waited on not wait on ourself. Then they argue witb us like we did something wrong.

2014-10-10,1.0,"It's been a long time since I made a bad review, but this one is a case apart. After been craving for a calzone I went to this app to find a place where I can get one. I came in with my son. I ordered a calzone with anchovies, ricotta, mushrooms, Canadian bacon and basil. My son ordered chicken wings in spicy BBQ. Let's start with the positive first.  The kid attended my table was really attentive and provided us a good service. That's it! Let's go now to the food. It was dreadful, bad, horrible. Let's talk about the wings first. While I was eating the second wing I found a hair in the wing. I informed about the situation to a waiter and she retired the plate just to bring it back a minute later telling me that it wasn't a hair, but a feather!!! Really??? First time I hear something like that. I was like... Anyhow, let me talk now about the calzone. I've been eating calzones over 30 years now so I think that I have a good idea how a calzone should be (at least I believed so). That's being said, the crust of the calzone was THICK so thick it was difficult to cut it with the knife.  The ingredients were OK, but the fact it was so thick and it costed me $17.80 plus taxes makes it ridiculous. At the end I ended up paying $28.81 (after I claimed to pay just half of the wings because I retuned half of the order). In summary, I'll never will go back and I am warning you about my experience. If you dare to stop by, share your experience maybe today was their bad bad they and I ended up paying for it. Update: If you crave a good calzone go to : @PhillysBest they know to prepare a good one. I just ate one yesterday 1/9/15.",-0.9218,0.784,0.089,0.128,0.5173484848484847

I'm happy I found them and tried them out!",0.8241,0.807,0.127,0.066,0.620436507936508
2012-08-16,4.0,"We had lunch catered from here and everything was good! The pizza was good.  the crust was crispy, and the sauce and cheese were good.  It wasn't too greasy. The BBQ chicken wings were good.  I liked the BBQ sauce a lot.  I ate a lot of the fries covered in BBQ sauce! The salad was fine.  It was a decent Greek salad.  It went well with all of our less healthy food. We had two pasta dishes.  Baked rigatoni, and rigatoni with chicken, green peppers, onion, and mushrooms.  I only tried the second one, but it was good. It's hard to think of what to say about the food, because I'm in a major food coma now.",0.9215,0.832,0.155,0.013,0.5144736842105262
2012-06-06,3.0,"I was craving some buffalo wings and didn't feel like driving far. I first went to Cochiaros and they were out. I looked up on yelp and saw that this place has wings. I walked in and looked over the menu since they don't have one online. I ordered the 6 piece hot wings w/ fries and cheesy garlic bread. I was expecting hot buffalo wings. What I received was hot bbq wings. I was pretty disappointed since I was craving buffalo wings. The wings were smothered in the sauce beneath some fries. I barely ate any of the fries since they were swimming in that bbq sauce.  The cheesy garlic bread was okay. I bit into a couple of big chunks of garlic...not good.  I wouldn't order these things again, but I will have to try the pizza one day. It looked pretty good.",0.8623,0.867,0.097,0.036,0.7022222222222221

2012-01-09,5.0,"Since my initial review I have tried lots of things at Mamma Mia.  The pizza is really good.  I usually get the veggie pizza that comes with spinach, garlic, black olives, mushrooms, onions and green peppers.  The crust is really crunchy and delicious.   One thing I would really like to add about Mamma Mia is that their service is awesome.  The owner is always there and is always throwing in special coupons for me here and there just because I am a loyal customer.  He always remembers me when I call in and that says a lot. I highly recommend Mamma Mia,  It is so important to support a good neighborhood business, especially in an area where good restaurants options are slim.   GO TO MAMMA MIA TODAY!",0.9779,0.7,0.235,0.065,0.5705059523809524

2010-05-25,2.0,"I went to Mamma Mia with friends who were visiting. Earlier in the day we had walked by the restaurant and it appeared to be a nice sit down place. We came back later for dinner. The evening was warm so they had the front windows open. It looked like a nice place to get some pizza and also enjoy the nice Chicago night. The inside of the restaurant has been remodeled to look like an Italian Village; the detail involved in this process appears to have been quite painstaking. The walls are painted as a mural with scenes from the village. A ceiling fan as the propeller for an air plane toward the entrance is very cool. The place presented really well, but then the service took over and things dropped by three stars. There were two nice tables right by the windows, but a manager was sitting in one of them using his laptop. With the weather it would have been nice to have the best seats in the house available for customers. The only menu they had was for take out, and it seemed take out was really what they were open for. They gave us soda in cans and then later on Styrofoam cups to pour them into. An employee told us we could refill the cups at the fountain, which made no sense since we'd already been given cans. Finally, we ordered the pizza. Sausage and Pepperoni. The pizza itself tasted pretty good. The crust was crunchy and flavorful and unlike other thin crust pizza I've had, it was not too greasy. While it is more traditional for pizza in Chicago to be cut in squares, they cut their slices in triangles, unfortunately, they did not cut it all the way through. We had to rip the pizza apart to get the pieces out. This was made even more difficult because we were given no utensils to go with our paper plates. Mamma Mia offers a different type of pizza than most restaurants in Portage Park and the pizza itself is tasty and a good alternative to the general Chicago style. I hope we just caught this place on a bad night or too soon, because it would be a shame if all of the work they have done on the inside of the restaurant went to waste. I feel like if I had ordered the pizza and had it delivered I would have ended up with a much different opinion of Mamma Mia. My visit left it unclear if they wanted me to dine in or if they wanted me to order their product for delivery. With all the work they've done I would assume come in and sit down, but the impression I got was that they didn't know how to deal with in house visitors.",0.7937,0.814,0.104,0.082,0.5404799697656841
