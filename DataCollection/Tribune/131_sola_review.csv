The food was great--we ordered the Tuna and the Hanger Steak as well as truffle fries and cantaloupe soup as a starter. All were amazing. Only slight disappointment was they had somehow run out of the brussels sprout dish so we weren't able to order that (one of Sola's signature dishes). Excellent neighborhood place.

2015-08-03,2.0,"I used to dream about the short rib benedict. The restaurant has recently changed ownership, and sadly, the place just isn't the same. After waiting a while to even be asked for an order (I had to ask a bus girl to get my waitress for me), I finally was able to order. In the restaurant of old, the potatoes were no slouch to the benedict, and the potatoes this time around were basically inedible. Cold, stringy and slimy. The benedict was dry and had a hair in it. I abandoned my attempts at this and decided to put in an order of the malasadas. In the past, you were able to dip the doughnut into your topping of choice. This time, they came smothered in both the raspberry and chocolate. I complained, but was starving, so didn't want to wait to have them redone. I'd give this one star except the waitress told the manager I complained, and she came out to apologize and took the malasadas off my order. Sadly, I think Sola just can't be redeemed without Carol in the kitchen and running it.",-0.9574,0.86,0.016,0.124,0.5267857142857143

2015-07-30,4.0,"Came here with the husband for anniversary dinner.  I have been wanting to try it for some time.  We went there uber early so we had the whole place ALMOST to ourselves.  1.  The restaurant is slightly leveled. The main floor and a few steps to an upper level. Very slight but enough to separate the place and allow some privacy.  The place is decorated nicely with some amber colors in the main area.  The upper level has some blue walls which complimented the wood tables.  2. Dishes:  I ordered the scallops served with creamy polenta and a light sauce that had some heat to it. The scallops had tiny pieces of pork on top which were crispy like bacon. Just  a good added touch. The polenta and scallops were so tasty.  Then I ordered the Black sesame crusted tuna served with Wasabi couscous and a pickled ginger slaw. It was delicious.  I really enjoyed the wasabi couscous against the flavor of the tuna and acid balance with the slaw. Yummy.  Husband ordered the Vietnamese BBQ chicken which was served with a spaetzle, a sauteed kohlrabi (turnipy type of cabbage) and pickled ramps.  He enjoyed the kitchen and spaetzle but wasn't digging the kohlrabi.  I loved the pickled ramps omg such a great addition to that dish to break the smokey/spicy sauce on the chicken. Hubs doesn't like ramps so I had those.  Dessert: AMAZING!! it was on their specials list.  I had a passion fruit napoleon: passion fruit custard or curd filling in that napolean crust topped with black sesame ice cream and braised pineapple on top and a sauce I cannot recall at this time. This was a divine dessert.  I was oh so happy to have had it!!! Our server was nice, knowledgeable and easy going. Our host who sat us down knew from my husband that it was our anniversary so we were greeted with two glasses of champagne! Then my dessert had an extra plate that said Congratulations in chocolate with two chocolate truffles.   Overall a lovely place, nicely decorated, with such friendly staff who made our visit here so wonderful.  Try their food, its done well.

There was no issue until I opened my container and onions everywhere and when I bit into my burger it was at best medium rare but on the rare side. Disappointed I pulled off the onions and ate some of it because I needed to eat on my break. It came with Parmesan fries which were the only good part about the meal. Not worth the $20.

I do hope they bring the grade A tuna back.  Steak & Eggs: I ordered a medium rare sirloin steak. Meat is overcooked and underseasoned.  Just not expecting from this restaurant.

I was in the mood to try a couple of things so I went with small plates. I had seared scallops and the Kahlua Pork. I had also ordered the mushroom salad because of a rave review on Yelp but the description did not match the salad: ""shaved mushrooms with arugula"" was actually arugula with some shavings of mushroom on it. I had to send it back. First time for everything. The two medium scallops were accompanied by a creamy pureed parsnip sauce, to die for! My Kahlua pork was a nice pulled pork dish with a sweet stuffing type accompaniment that was too sweet and sauce way too rich and dense for me. The ""bread"" brought to the table at the start was thin crisps that tasted like rye + mild licorice. Turned out to be anise and other healthy ingredients. Very light and very good. I drank a non-alcoholic pho mojito which was described as ginger syrup and something in soda with mint. Tons of mint and limes tho, I mean Tons. I didn't taste the ginger at all. However, it was a tasty mint & lime refreshing drink. I had fun listening to the 4 gay guys' chat about their trip to Shanghai. The place had only male servers, for what it's worth.

Nice low lighting for a date or a small party, plenty of space as well so I anticipate using the online reservations in the future to be sure. The service was also exceptional. Very friendly staff all around. We started off with the Tuna Poke which was great and a plenty of appetizer for two. Great flavor, and eye catching presentation. The tuna was very fresh, and we practically licked our plate clean. For the main course, we went with the salmon, and the tuna as well. The salman had a great sweet flavor, and the lighted fried greens on the top were a great touch. The tuna had lightly fried avocado on top which was a great compliment. So much flavor going on again with this dish, some wasabi but also had some sweet accents as well. All on a bed of rice. And to top it off, the portion size was great. Not too little, and plenty to leave you feeling satisfied. For dessert, they had a great slew of options, but we opted out with just the Kona martini, which if you enjoy coffee, this was a perfect night cap. This was a great dining experience, and reminds me why I enjoy city dining. If you are looking for a nice sit down date, not too pricey with fantastic food, don't hesitate.

I appreciate when that information is given if the fish plate price has increased but just like that $5.00 more for a dish that was marked differently in the menu, I don't find it right... Other than that they have a nice customer service and good cocktails though you get them better and more creative in other restaurants in Chicago but it's not bad at all.

I ordered the artichoke fritter appetizer, and the chicken entree, which came with a side of falafel.   I found this place to be 'Tasty, but Undercooked', which applies to both food and Staff. Service I was excited to try this place and the staff seemed nice over the phone but in person was a slightly different story... Upon arrival, I went inside through a door labeled as a pick up entry. The were a few bodies in the dining room not more than 12 people total. I didn't see any wait staff on the floor. The person behind the bar looked up but did not acknowledge me, continuing to work. I stood there waiting what seemed like 15 mins (was probably more like 7, still too long for customer acknowledgment) until after the employee completed task. Still without greeting I was asked what I needed and instructed to wait by the host station. I don't know, because I usually don't have any issues when I spend my money, but it just seemed kinda rude and I hate to play the race card but I AM Black American. It may be in my head, and they are in fact really nice people but they weren't showing it to me. I feel as though I got better service over the phone than in person. Nothing for nothing, and regardless of if race played a part or not, Sola staff needs to step up their Customer Service! The Food PRICE - It is a little pricey, by the portions are nice for the price. TASTE - The Chicken, while very tasty, was also very undercooked.The falafel is DELICIOUS! I don't know if they make their own cucumber sauce, but it's GOOD! ;-) The artichoke fritters were also good. I don't care for artichokes but I was curious, so if you do you'll love theses!

Hubs and I started with the artichoke fritters that came with two dipping sauces. We weren't impressed with the dish. It was edible but nothing special and we could've done without it. I had the burger, which I give high marks. It's topped with cambozola which is kind of a cross between brie and bleu cheese. Very yummy flavor if you're into that. The parmesan truffle fries that accompanied it were tasty but a little tough (maybe over-fried?).  Hubs had the special, which was lamb chops stuffed with that cambozola. He was not happy with his meal. In particular he said the cheese totally overpowered the lamb and that the ""Shake-and-Bake-type breading was soggy."" For dessert we had the peach tart with honey-miso ice cream. Hubs was all about this. I thought it was OK. The ice cream had kind of a salty taste that I found off-putting.

We had reservations for a week night dinner, and when we walked in, there were not too many people. The ambiance and decor is flat - not too casual and informal, but not elegant either. It was somewhere in between, and it seemed to have missed the mark.  Lets get on to the food. I ordered a salad (I forget the name) but it had candied hazelnuts in them. The salad was pretty good, but here is my issue with it. It was full of the hazelnuts, there were so many of them, at the end of dinner my plate had a bunch of them left as I couldn't eat them all. Hubby ordered the soba noodle dish from the entrees. As it arrived, it looked great. But it was a cold dish - I wish we were forewarned. Maybe it was our fault to assume it would be a hot dish. It had veggies and peanut sauce and more peanuts on top for garnish. Again - there were so many peanuts in the dish.

2014-09-27,2.0,"I'm really disappointed I cannot rank Sola higher. After seeing Sola's short rib eggs benedict listed in the top 5 eggs benedict in Chicago (in TimeOut Chicago), friends and bf and I had to pay a visit ASAP. Their menu reads like a foodie's dream. Creative takes on chiliquiles, eggs benedict, wagyu burgers and steaks. The brunch and dinner menus look fantastic. From what we sampled at brunch I wouldn't say the food is bad, I wouldn't even be opposed to going back, but nothing was outstanding, I've had better brunch. My friend and I both had the short rib eggs benedict, boyfriend had the wagyu steak and eggs and other friend had the bacon omelet.  Short rib eggs benedict: Immediate points off, like, HUGE points off, because both my eggs and my friends were over cooked. These were not poached eggs, no delicious yolk pouring over the pulled short ribs. Nope, just poorly cooked hard-boiled eggs. Seriously frustrating. The short rib meat itself was tasty. The cheddar biscuits good but not remarkable. Didn't really seem freshly made, not buttery and flakey or fluffy. Cheddar flavor present but not overly noticeable. Pesto hollandaise good, standard. So the meal was OK, it didn't taste bad but it wasn't amazing, the eggs were a disaster (and the main freaking reason anyone orders eggs benedict!). There is no way I would rank these eggs benedict in any food list. They were decent, not perfect. Don't f*ck up the eggs for christ's sake!  Wagyu steak and eggs: Bf's panko coated poached egg was actually cooked properly, unlike the eggs in the eggs benedict. Wagyu steak was tough, per bf. I tasted a bite, I got the toughness but the flavor was good. Sauce on the steak was a sort of soy-sauced based steak sauce, it was very tasty. I think the sauce, in my boyfriends opinion, saved the steak. Gave it good flavor.  I think he was pretty unimpressed by how tough the steak was and also disappointed like I was. Bacon omelet: Friend seemed to enjoy it, said had good amount of bacon in it and a lot of white cheddar which he seemed to really like. Didn't comment very much on it when asked but said he liked it. Lastly, our waiter was basically absent. No bedside (tableside?) manner. Gruff, semi-rude, uninterested, walked away before we were finished talking. I kind of hate him. I haven't had such an obviously uninterested waiter in a really long time. Service was really lacking. I would hope this isn't the case at dinner considering their dinner menu is pretty pricey. The place itself has very little ambience, I cannot really picture paying higher end prices to eat here for a special dinner. Also, this place is supposed to be Hawaiian some how? I didn't get any indication of that on the brunch menu. Maybe it is present on the dinner menu. All in all - if I lived in North Center I would probably go here from time to time because the menu reads really well, I'd be willing to try more things.

Once we looked over the menu we were pleasantly surprised to find alot of food that meet our dietary restrictions. We ordered the artichoke fritters (based on other yelpers reviews) and the gnocchi. The Gnocchi was DELICIOUS! I only wish there was more on the plate for $13! There were barely 5-6 tiny tiny pieces of sweet potato gnocchi. But overall the flavors on the plate blend so beautifully in your mouth. Aha! Heaven. This is a must-try..I guess I had too high expectations from the artichoke fritters. My husband liked it and said it was really well cooked, but I found it to be just ok. Then we ordered the Veggie burger. That was mind-blowing! The quinoa and veggies were perfectly blended and was so soft that it literally melted in your mouth. Thankfully, this dish was big enough to fill my still-empty tummy after the tiny appetizers. We then ordered the 3 ice cream plate each. The 5 spice salted caramel was a lil too 'spice-filled' for my liking. I could distinctly taste the cinnamon and clove and that's not a flavor I appreciate much in my ice cream. But if you do like those flavors, you might like this one. The white chocolate and mocha, and the bourbon butterscotch pecan were delicious! (and im not even a bourbon drinker!). Overall, we were pleased with our experience here. The server was also super friendly and didn't seem to be pissed that I asked her to describe almost all the ice cream flavors before I finally made my choice.",0.9937,0.772,0.195,0.033,0.5393888888888888

2014-04-09,4.0,"Sola has a 4.4 for me.  Really close to a 5.  Damn close.   I have to preface my review of Sola with an anecdote about Roy's - a chain of restaurants that originated on the Hawaiian islands with the same basic concept as Sola with Hawaiian/European fusion.  I used to go to Roy's Chicago all the time.  When I was traveling around Hawaii last year, I also happened to go to three different Roy's on different islands in one trip (it wasn't planned!  It just happened) and I was blown away time and time again.  Recently, I went to Roy's Chicago and had a disappointing dining experience.  I was sad that I wouldn't be able to have that awesome style of food around Chicago anymore.   In steps Sola.  YES.  It's back.  I'll stop talking about Roy's, because Sola stands strongly on its own.   Hawaiian fusion is one of my favorite styles of food because it combines strong Asian flavors with European deliciousness.  It reminds me of a crazy fancy version of the idea behind the fusion that inspired Bahn Mi sandwichs (not necessarily Vietnamese, but cross-continental fusion that marries extremely well) .  For appetizers, we ordered tuna poke and duck potstickers.  The poke was nice and everything I wanted and expect it to be.  The duck was rich and delicious.  For appetizers, I ordered the halibut that was on special.  It was cooked very well, and the sides accompanied the fish nicely.  My partner ordered the lamb, which I think was one of the only awkward parts of the meal.  The racks were cut into double-rib cutlets, but they were stuffed with cheese, which unfortunately lead to them being a bit overcooked.  Overall, however, I was extremely impressed.  For dessert, we ordered the house made ice cream.  We (independently of the server) picked the 3 most popular flavors: five spice salted caramel, fresh mint chocolate chip, and the sesame brittle.  The caramel and mint chip were outstanding, but the sesame brittle was to die for.  And you can buy it to go.  I'm certain I'll be in there soon to buy a pint to go.   You should try Sola.  It's excellent!",0.9929,0.788,0.16,0.052,0.6362797619047619

2014-03-13,4.0,"Sola is located in an interesting part of Lakeview, off of Lincoln Ave in a part of town you might not associate with foodie type restaurants. That being said, complaints of it being expensive are in my opinion, somewhat overrated but I can see how some people might think that depending on what you order. If this place were on Randolph Street in West Loop, it would be average priced so keep that in mind depending on if you're a beer and pizza kinda person or a Girl and the Goat person. Now onto the review! The space consists of actually two sections. A main dining room we sat in and another cordoned off area which I guess they use for when it's busier. The main space is a big open square somewhat dimly lit with a fireplace upfront. Tables are quite close together as I found myself banging my elbow into the chair at the table behind me. So if you're looking for intimate, this isn't is as most tables are out in the open save for the ones near the window. I would imagine it could also get loud in there as you are in a big open space. Kinda reminded me of someones slightly better decorated basement. A big open square... A heads up on seating - last night was around 25 degrees and the two couples we observed being seated at the window tables both asked to be moved. I'm figuring it's pretty drafty up there! The drink menu is quite varied with a nice selection of cocktails ($8-$12), wines by the glass $9-$12, and bottled beers. I had a Wicked Wahine which was a mixture of sweet and peppery flavors and quite tasty while the wife stuck to wine. Cocktail was on the strong side so perhaps one will do! Also had a glass of the New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc (also $10) which was light and crisp and a nice compliment to the chicken we ordered.  The food menu is where it gets interesting. There are really three menus it seems: the specials of the day, the fixed price menu (last night's theme was carrots - looked good) which includes a starter, entree and desert for $30 (with wine parings add $15) and the regular menu.  Small plates can vary from $10 - $15 per if memory serves me correctly and depending on what you get can either be a good value ($11 for a pile of Kalua pork on banana bread - YUM!) to pricey like $14 for 2 scallops. Ouch.  Mind you, both dishes were very good but two scallops probably not gonna fill you up. We then split an entree of chicken served with greens and coconut curry cous cous. Say that 3 times fast. The chicken was glazed with a Rosemary Orange glaze so it has an Asian feel to it. Moist and tasty and at $18, a bargain compared to those scallops! We also ordered the crispy Brussels sprouts and they were the best of the bunch (and cheapest at $8).  We finished off our  meal with the pineapple upside down cake served with homemade ice cream and macadamia nut brittle. This thing was awesome ($10) and some Hawaiian coffee. If we had to do it again, we'd probably come for a few small plates and one drink to keep costs in line. This is a ""sometimes treat"" kinda place as the food is good but you can easily drop $150 here in a heartbeat which feels a bit odd for Lakeview.  Then again since I live in the area, it saves me a trip to West Loop and a $20 cab ride!",0.9968,0.857,0.121,0.023,0.5061794584016807

My entree this evening was the Barramundi with Soba Noodles delicately seasoned with a Soy Vinaigrette and garnished with julienned Green Papaya, Carrots and Red Pepper. The fish was one of the best I have had recently. The Trio of Sorbets were tasty and not too sweet. The Coconut and the Banana were my favorites.

I had the stuffed lamb special dish, which was phenomenal. My sister's barramundi dish was also very good as was her fiance's short rib dish.

Our waitress was very friendly & attentive, the cocktail I ordered was really delicious, and all of the dishes we ordered were so great.

It was served with smashed edamame & tempura green beans, with this really delicious sauce around the plate that just brought everything together.

I also had the crispy brussels sprouts, and those were great.  Since we had a Groupon we ordered way more than we normally would have, but the prices seem pretty fair for what is ordered.

I would have given the restaurant 4 stars until we had a HORRIBLE brunch experience there.  I have an allergy to certain foods. I am always very clear and open about this with servers when ordering at restaurants. Sola had previously been accommodating with my allergy/dietary concerns.  During this visit, I shared with the server three times about my allergy and he claimed he even checked with the kitchen about the dish I ordered. When my food was brought out I asked to confirm the ingredients once again. He assured me everything was fine. Two bites in and something didn't taste right. I called him over and he again assured me and said you are definitely safe to keep eating. I took one more bite and then knew for sure something was wrong. My husband and I rushed out of the restaurant to the car to get my medication. (Unfortunately I did not bring it into the restaurant on that day.)  On the way out the manager asked for our number and my husband quickly gave it to her. She called and left a message checking to see how I was feeling later that day and asked me to return her call. She said she would like to extend an apology and a meal on the restaurant in response to their error. This seemed like a nice gesture; however, I called back four times for the next few weeks and spoke to staff and answering machines leaving messages for her. Never heard from her again.  I have been in many situations at restaurants, given my allergy, and I have seen staff and managers handle things professionally (in which case I am happy to then return) and I have seen them handle things unprofessionally and without regard for their customers (in which case I do not return.)

2013-10-12,2.0,"My husband I went to Sola based on the hundreds of excellent reviews it has received, but we were disappointed with the food. We were seated by the window, which was nice, but directly under the air conditioning vent, which blew on me for the duration of our stay. One thing that I did very much like is that the hostess offered me a shawl to stay warm. Sadly, the shawl smelled like it needed to be washed. We ordered soup, three small plates, and one large plate and were disappointed with all of them except the soup. The egg rolls were bland, the pot stickers were bland and overcooked, and the pulled pork was flavorless and served on soggy banana bread. The ginger-glazed salmon was tasty and cooked well, but was served on a big glob of edamame purée that was, to me, horrible. The pho with oxtail broth was very good, and I enjoyed it very much.  The best thing about our experience at Sola was our server, a delightful woman with an English accent who seemed absolutely thrilled to be serving us. I felt like we were doing her a favor, instead of the other way around. She was happy, attentive, accommodating...truly a delight. She brought my husband a little birthday treat at the end of our meal, and explained the Hawaiian writing on the plate. The two little house-made truffles were beautifully presented, but I wanted to spit it out after taking a bite. I can't quite explain the flavor - sort of caramel, sort of salty, sort of buttery, but runny with an unappealing aftertaste. I'm sorry, Sola, I'm not trying to be mean, and I do appreciate the excellent service, but we really didn't enjoy our meal, and with so many other options, we won't be back to try again. :-(",0.9954,0.721,0.21,0.069,0.6252091377091377

I'm so glad she did---the food and the service were delightful.  We ate outside, which one should always do in Chicago since the season is so short.  The outside vibe was so-so.  The glare from the street lights was a little off-putting, but that was no fault of the restaurant. The menu cites a Hawaiian vibe, but I wouldn't have noticed the influence if it hadn't been mentioned.  We split a beet and goat cheese salad--which the kitchen plated separately, always a nice touch.  We also shared a scallop appetizer---D loved it while I found the texture a little mushy.  But, that was me.  My entree of grouper was perfectly prepared and hit all of the right taste notes. D ordered the signature tuna dish, which I tasted and found good although I prefered my grouper. We started off with a mai-tai (as a sweet and festive kick off to a 30 year high school reunion).  If it werent' for the calorie and alcohol content, I could've consumed about fifty of them---so good!

2013-07-09,5.0,"Sola Restaurant has a big-box look to it, yet without the big-box feel. The atmosphere is trendy, the service ranks high -- from my first experience there, and the price is comparable to what you will find at a lot of breakfast spots where people wait what seems like forever to feast off of a limited menu. And now that I've gotten the fluff out of the way, here is the proper review. Red dawn. Malasadas. Upside down banana pancake. Oh my God! You can't go to brunch and not have a flavoured alcoholic beverage. That was the red dawn for me. I can get my fingers around a glass of champagne and blood orange, even if I can't get my mind around downing drinks before noon. Now, you have heard me say this first. The best doughnuts in the world are bofrots - Ghanaian doughnuts. The second best are malasadas and it is in your best interest to go to Sola and order some. Forget about beignets and Krispy Kreme. One thing I will warn you about is the upside down banana pancake. Do not eat anything else before attempting to devour that plate of happiness. It is filling. I ate half at the restaurant and took the remainder home. It was actually just as good heated later on in a conventional oven. I haven't tried anything from the Hawaiian menu, as that will require a visit for lunch or dinner. I may not make it back for lunch or dinner, but I will definitely return for brunch.

We shared several dishes: ham and cheese french toast, smoked fish scrambled eggs, and an Asian chicken salad. The salad was light and refreshing, with exotic greens and just a touch of very flavorful dressing. The smoked fish scrambled eggs was good, the highlight being a dollop of very flavorful cream cheese, and some nicely cooked hash browns, but I probably wouldn't order that dish again. The best was the ham and cheese french toast, which reminded my of a Montecristo sandwich. It was slathered with fresh strawberry preserves that contained a hint of five spice.

I have to say, Sola did an excellent job at hiring some of the best, most attentive waiting staff. Good job to all of them! My dad and I ordered the lentil/quinoa burger. We usually have good luck with veggie burgers of this sort. This burger was...mush. It had a crispy outside but was just too big because the moment I bit down the inside oozed out the side of the sandwich. Luckily I hadn't eaten all day so I was hungry enough to scarf it anyway. Dad had a similar experience. The bun was good, the toppings were fantastic (love that they put arugula on top!) but the burger....just bleh.

The Tuna Poke was excellent (though it took the request of a little soy sauce to get it there), presentation was very good, and the food was also quite good, I just don't see myself coming back. After the $50 Groupon, the balance came to $80 all tolled after three drinks, two starters, one main, and a dessert. That's not bad at all, but without the Groupon, I may have walked out feeling a little ripped (for $130). The service was sub-par, which I attribute to the server's presumptions that we're cheap and not going to tip well, so he sort of stranded us at key points in the meal.

We started with some cocktails...mine being the Solzerac, there take on the classic New Orleans Sazerac cocktail. Unfortunately, the bartender had overdone the absinthe (it should only be a light wash) and it completely overpowered the drink, especially the rye whiskey.  My wife was nice enough to swap drinks and give me her manhattan (she hates complaining about food), but our server was so adept that she noticed we had exchanged drinks and she immediately had the bartender remake it. Now that is great service! The food was outstanding. My salmon was superb; served rare with a soy, ginger, and truffle-teriyaki sauce atop a fluffy edamame puree + green bean tempura. It was cooked perfectly and flavors of sauce complemented the fish beautifully. The tuna steak is our absolute favorite here. Rare ahi tuna lightly encrusted with a hoisin-mustard panko; served atop bamboo rice and the best part...fried avocado!  We elected to end our meal with 20-year port and a trio of bourbon-caramel, peanut butter, and mint chocolate ice cream.  Overall, we had an amazing meal.

Tuna Poke- if you've ever been to Hawaii and had the poke there, this is definitely a high class version and will definitely transport you back!

We came back 4 days later for dinner, figuring at this point we were committed to using this coupon up before it expired.  Both visits were pleasant and enjoyable, but not necessarily memorable.  I will say I enjoyed the dinner a little bit more, which seems to be against the grain as other yelpers seem to rave about the brunch.   Brunch: The atmosphere was a nice combination of sort of trendy but also breakfast diner-ish and the service between both the server and hostess was very welcoming and friendly.  I went with a new item - a whitefish scramble while my fiance chose the short rib benedict.  The whitefish was smoked but did not have a fishy taste to it at all and blended nicely with the flavors of the scramble.  I didn't taste any of the sirracha that was supposedly mixed in, but it was flavorful enough.  My fiance enjoyed his benedict but it didn't seem to be especially different or special.  The bacon he got as his side was weird and inedible.  The hash browns, however, were crispy and seasoned and quite tasty.  The drink menu is a little disappointing for brunch and they definitely have better drinks available at dinner time.  The bloody mary was very good, served with a healthy piece of shrimp and with a nice amount of spice.  I like a good bloody on a Sunday morning and this one was delicious and hit the spot.  My fiance went with some sort of mixed drink that had St. Germaine's in it and should have been delicious but instead was watered down and bland. Dinner: Dinner appealed to us a little bit more and we enjoyed the evening drink options as well.  I went with a pear martini that was refreshing and tasty (made with Le Poir) and he went with a whiskey based specialty cocktail that was a little too similar to bourbon and ginger ale.  The amuse bouche was a tasty bite of vegetarian heaven.  We had the artichoke fritters to start and they were fresh and crispy and tasty.  Not overly greasy and the two dipping sauces were yummy.  For our entrees I had the barramundi special, and was very pleased with it.  The fish came flaky and crisp and was very fresh with a lovely yellow slightly sweet glaze.  My fiance went, once again, with the short rib that Sola is famous for.  He enjoyed the dish, but not so much that we'll be back.  Sola is a very good restaurant and worth visiting once.  But neither the brunch or dinner left a lasting impression or memory.  They were just missing that extra effect.  A wow factor, if you will.

Tastes pretty much like what I eat at home. The waiter told us they were fried so I don't know how healthy they are. Our total bill was $62 without alcohol or desert so it's a little on the pricier side but I'd say it's worth the splurge. The fritters, burger and ambiance earned this place a 4 star as opposed to 3.  I would definitely recommend you make reservations for the weekend. The bar is full service but only has 6 spots. I called ahead and was told that the time we wanted was booked with reservations but they definitely took walk-ins. Well, seems like that really shouldn't be the case because we waited quite a while just hoping to get a bar stool and everyone who came in after us was immediately sat because they had reservations. It's also quite loud by 8 pm once the wine has been flowing for a while. I don't suggest this place for an intimate dinner or first date. Go with a bunch of friends for the cozy atmosphere and delicious food :-)",0.9972,0.747,0.228,0.025,0.6336904761904761

The staff is friendly and courteous.  Our server was happy to answer any questions we had about the menu as well as give a number of recommendations since it was our first time.  He also gave us a sampler of beet, fennel leaf and goat cheese that was quite fresh and tasty.

My girlfriend also got something, but I only remember my meal.  Before I get into the food, the waiter was awesome. He was very friendly and very prompt. I was very thirsty that day and probably went through 10 cokes, which were all refilled promptly.  The food itself was amazing. At first I was skeptical because I do not eat seafood and the menu appeared to have a good majority of seafood. The Kalua Pork was delicious, who would have ever thought that a BBQ pulled pork would go well with banana? Well it does. The short ribs were also amazing, pulled right apart and went well with the mac and cheese (I did not get the brussel sprouts and got green bean tempora). The fries, also amazing, although I was not a huge fan of the truffle aioli.  The dinner was so good that I actually purchased another Groupon while we were eating and we enjoyed our next meal that was just a week ago. Again the food was amazing and I highly recommend anyone to go here. While it is a little pricy, it is well worth it and I could eat here every week if I had the money.

2013-01-18,5.0,"OMG Groupon is amazing for having a deal to Sola! I do not leave a restaurant thinking that it was one of the best meal's I've ever had too often, but I did after Sola! We came about half an hour early for our dinner reservation, the host was very nice and told us that there will not be table til then for us, but we can grab a drink at the bar top. Dont mind if we do... We ordered the scallops to share with my boyfriend and a drink.. Before our food was brought out a waitress brought us a bite of beet salad with goat cheese and it was so refreshing and a perfect way to start out night. The scallops were absolutely the best that I have ever had! The softest, biggest, most flavorful scallops! My mouth is watering just thinking about them! When our reservation time came, the host came to us and told us we can proceed to the table when we are ready. The table was right by the window, and usually I do not care where I am seated, but very cold air was coming from the window so we ended up sitting at the end of the table to be farther from the cold. It's okay though, was not a deal breaker, we are in Chicago, cold happens. So for the food. Besides the scallops, we got 2 small plates (wagyu steak tartar -capers, candied ginger, chile oil, tempura egg, green beans, arugula, miso) and (potstickers- duck confit, napa slaw, radish, five- spice syrup),1 main entree  (tuna - hoisin-mustard panko, bamboo rice, avocado, soy-wasabi buerre blancand) and a  dessert (adzuki bean cake - maple confit, kabocha squash, bacon-praline brittle, vanilla miso ice cream, sweet soy, maple reduction, candied seaweed). Tartar - the runny egg on top was perfect, everything was so smooth and fresh Potstickers - yes you can get potstickers anywhere, and my boyfriend gets them everywhere because he likes them a lot. He said that this is the best potstickers that he has ever had! They were perfectly balances between the outside slight crunch and the flavorful meat inside. Tuna - omg the tuna was the best cooked tuna I've ever had! If you like tuna... what the heck if you don't even like tuna you will absolutely love this dish! The outside is fried, and the inside is raw, it is peeeerfect. The rice with the tuna had a hint of sweetness, and the avocado provided smoothness, oooh and the wasabi and soy were not overpowering at alll, and I usually hate wasabi... mmmm Adzuki bean cake - it was tasty, but nothing to write home about. After reading so many great reviews I had high expectations, but according to my boyfriend after such an amazing dinner, the dessert was the worst point, it was just not that great.

2013-01-18,4.0,"I have mixed feelings about Sola, but I think this may be due to some less-than-ideal ordering. Overall, it was enjoyable and the service was stellar. Every person involved in seating us, serving our food, and clearing away empty plates was prompt, pleasant, and polite. Our server Alison was especially nice. The dining room was lovely. It felt very modern but the soft lighting gave the room a warmth that is sometimes lacking in contemporary establishments. The fireplace was lit, and we sat right by it. The mistake we made, though, was to split four small plates and then one entree. I think we would have been better off ordering entrees, because the small plates were a little, well, small. What we loved: The seared scallops and the kalua pork over banana bread. Both of these dishes were amazing. My boyfriend isn't crazy about bananas, but even he admitted that the kalua pork was his second favorite (after the scallops). There are only two scallops in the appetizer/small plate, but they are plump and perfectly prepared. What we liked: The wagyu burger (our split entree) and the artichoke fritters. I would've preferred the burger without the cambozola, which is a blue-veined cheese (and I'm just not that crazy about blue cheese). Otherwise, this was nice and came with truffle fries. Our server asked us if we wanted truffle aioli with the fries, which we agreed to. However, these came with a surprising $2 charge when we got the bill. It was not enough to complain about but just enough to be a little irritating. Overall, I wasn't that fond of the truffle aioli, which was also served with the artichoke fritters. The fritters themselves were nice, although there were just five of them for $8. What we weren't crazy about: Sweet potato gnocchi. The actual gnocchi was fantastic, but the rest of this dish was just okay. It was a heaping amount of fava beans with roughly 5-7 gnocchi. Had this proportion been reversed, this would have been a much more satisfying dish. Overall, our bill for four small plates, one entree (one of the cheapest at just $16), one beer, and one soda plus tax and tip was just shy of $100. This is a bit high for casual dining, but I think we could've sliced this in half if we'd ordered a bit smarter.

2013-01-02,3.0,"The boy and I came here to celebrate my birthday and the end of the semester. After hearing how great it was from Karen T., we were both excited. We reached there a little bit after our reservation due to some traffic, but the staff greeted us very courteously. I love the fact that they took our coats for us. We were seated in front of a very large group of very loud middle-early high schoolers. Throughout their meal, they carried extremely loud discussions which put a damper on what was supposed to be an intimate meal. After we were shown to our table, our waiter approached us. This is where the night started to be less than ideal. He quickly asked us what we wanted to drink, when we had just gotten the menus a few seconds ago. No introductions, no ""Hi and welcome to Sola, I'll be your server this evening!"". Just straight up ""can I get you any drinks"". That's when I knew that this visit wouldn't be great, since service usually makes or breaks the deal for me.  Anyway, after placing our drink orders, our waiter left. While we perused the menu, we noticed that other tables had received bread baskets. We were a bit puzzled, but didn't question it. We ultimately ended up receiving the basket about 15-20 minutes after we sat down at the table, which again, wasn't ideal. I guess I don't need to overeat on bread anyway, so its okay? The basket was great, and had an assortment of breads-sourdough, pretzel, and some spiced crispy flatbread. It reminded me of something we have in India, and tasted like it, so the boy and I loved it. The pretzel roll was also great. When we finally got the waiters attention, we were able to order food. We ended up ordering the entire meal because we didn't know when we would be able to get him again. For appetizers, we ordered the cheese plate and the artichoke fritters. The cheese plate was kind of small, but I guess that was expected. 4 kinds of cheese, some pickled veggies, 2 cuts of meat. The cheese was great, and I loved the tart and tangy flavor to the vegetables. The artichoke fritters were also good. They had a crispy exterior, and the tangy aspect that you expect from artichokes. The dip that they provided was excellent as well. A creamy, cool truffle sauce paired excellently with the warm lemony fritters. Delicious. Now for entrees. I don't know why it takes so long to get food here, but it does. I appreciate that they want to give us time to digest, talk and get ready for the next course. Usually I never start wondering about the next course after I'm done with the current one, since it always comes out so quickly. However, we began to anxiously await our food. I would say it was an average of 15-20 minutes in between each course, which was way too long. The boy ordered the chicken, and I ordered the veggie burger. The burger seemed to be made with lentils, quinoa and black beans, all of which I love. It was huge, but delicious. The crispy exterior and creamy interior of the burger paired well with the tangy candied onions inside. However, I know veggie burgers have trouble staying together, and this was no exception. Half of the burger fell out of the bun when I went to take my first bite. It was a messy ordeal, and I ended up using my fork and knife. I wasn't a huge fan of the vegetable chips that they gave (sweet potato I think). They were kind of bland to me.  The boy enjoyed his meal, and said the chicken was extremely juicy. He wasn't, however, a fan of the spaetzle they substituted for the polenta (he's a big polenta fan). We also got parmesan truffle fries to share with the truffle aioli. The fries were heavenly and had a great presentation. They were perfectly warm and crispy, which paired well with the fragrant smooth truffle aioli. However, I think next time I would skip on the aioli, since it ended up being too much truffle for our tastes. Desserts: The boy asked the waiter to bring out something special for my birthday while I was in the ladies room. I saw a waiter bring a tray with a candle on it to the table behind us, so I knew it was coming. Then came the second tray....and it didn't come to our table for another 5 minutes. The waiter kept walking around, confused as to where it was going. It kind of ruined it. When it finally arrived, it had Happy Birthday written on it with chocolate sauce with two decadently rich dark chocolate truffles. We also got the molten chocolate cake and a sample of three ice creams (gingersnap, vanilla and bourbon butterscotch pecan). Wasn't a fan of the gingersnap, but the others were deliciously cool, creamy and flavorful. With the cake, the sesame brittle ice cream paired well with the molten interior of the cake. I tried to stay away from the wasabi and vanilla syrup that was also on the plate. I got what they were going for, but the flavors just weren't jiving with my palate.  Overall, would I return? Maybe, but only for a good deal. The waiter was super flaky, and he made an otherwise enjoyable experience into just",0.9995,0.777,0.187,0.036,0.5992411271624755

2012-11-28,5.0,"My first yelp review! I've always wondered what restaurant would compel me to finally write an actual review since I love going out to eat and have gone to a lot of nice Chicago restaurants w/bf.  I really liked Sola. The ambiance is simple, open, and warm. Best of all, it's quiet so you can actually hear your date. I like this. Only 1 motor function at a time for me and and having to repeat something mundane like ""the floor is brown"" b/c people can't hear you is not ideal. Anyways, although the ambiance was great, the dish I had could've been served in an alley next to two dogs sharing spaghetti for all i care because the food was just so unique and flavorful. I got the seasonal entree, the cobia, which is a white fish. It was encrusted in pumpkin seeds and served with a a puree of something I can't remember, but it was a mashed root of some sort...maybe parsnips... it was light, fluffy, and sweet. There were also chopped chestnuts and roasted sunchokes. My favorite part of the dish, they were perfectly roasted and wonderfully caramelized. I liked this dish so much because first of all, the components themselves are pretty unique. But it wasn't just the uniqueness of the ingredients that made this dish so memorable. It was the way the flavors of each perfectly complemented each other. They all had a salty, sweet thing going on. The crunch of the pumpkin seeds balanced the softness of the puree, fish, and chestnuts. The sunchokes' nutty aftertaste married perfectly with the chestnut. The sweetness of the chestnut tied in well with the puree. The soft, neutral (and perfectly cooked) fish's flavor was just somehow heightened by the accoutrements. It was just a very well thought-out dish. I enjoy that fact that overall profile was very mellow but to a very high scale. Overall, a very flavorful meal. I liked it so much that I'm considering going back before this item is off the menu...and that's kind a big deal because I have an actual written list of all the Chicago restaurants I want to try and have been slowly ticking them off. Repeats have been rare. The bf had the Wagyu burger that he said was good. I pouched some of his truffle fries-they were tasty w /good truffle flavor. We also got the scallop and cheese plate appetizers. Both were beautifully presented -as were all the dishes - and as balanced as my entree. My entire meal went well with the glass of riesling I ordered. High praises to Sola. Even bf strangely gets points just for taking me there. You guys deserve more street recognition. I wish I had brought my camera to take pictures of the dishes- guess I'll have to go back :)",0.9989,0.77,0.221,0.009,0.5502591725214676

Is it a special or is it a menu item? Anyway she recommended them and said they were unlike any other mussels we might have had before. Well she was right; they were definitely different but not for the better. The mussels were very dry and smoked with some type of spice that left a powdery texture and taste in my mouth. We then split the tuna poke which was not that great either. It was definitely edible, but I would never want to order it again.  On the plus side we split our main entree, the halibut, and it was good for the most part. The service was also outstanding. The hostess and server were very friendly and attentive.

Each of our meals were delicious and huge- Green City Market Omelet, short ribs Benedict and the breakfast burger. Our server was attentive and friendly. This is a place to go with a few close girlfriends, your family, or as a couple- not a place for loud, half-drunk groups of guys and girls like some brunch places. Tip- We arrived at 10, so we could sit at the first come/first served patio, and it was filling up by 11.

Beautiful atmosphere out there, and service did not lag, which is always a concern of mine. There was a table available, so we were seated right away - rare for a Saturday night walk-in. We started dinner around 8pm. The amuse was delicious and unexpected. They have a wonderful beer and wine menu. I tried a new Pear Hard Cider that I had never had before and am now in love with. Bread basket was good - homemade tuile is a nice touch, loved the Hawaiian sea salt on the butter, perfect touch. We ordered and shared quite a few plates including: scallops, grilled octopus, onion strings, Waygu beef tartar (to die for) and the beet salad. The server was so sweet and gave beautiful descriptions of all of the menu items...she sold me on dessert, which is really hard to do. They have an amazing and fun selection of housemade ice creams and sorbets, and I ordered the banana ice cream fudge sundae because our server made it sounds so yummy - it delievered! This place has a lot of things going for it. The decor is modern and beautiful without being stuffy and pretentious, the restrooms are beautiful and better yet, they were really clean!

First, we had the scallop for an app. We were not very big fans. I would avoid this item at all costs. The scallop was cold, rubbery and whatever else they put with it was not the right thing to put with it. I think it was some kind of fruit. Now, the reason this place gets four stars. I had the salmon and my GF had the halibut. We both agreed that these were the two best fish dishes we have ever had. We both tried each others dishes and liked them equally.

2012-08-22,4.0,"Sola is a Hawaiian - Midwest fusion restaurant - Ahhhhh ha! I didn't quite know the concept before visiting. All I knew from my fellow Yelpers was that it was supposed to be great. I had a lovely meal and a lovely evening tonight at S(s)ola. Is it all lowercase? I'm such a noob! They list small plates/appetizers and large plates/entrees on their menu which kind of confused my friend and I. So how many plates do we order? An app and two entrees like we would at a standard restaurant? Or a bunch of small plates like at tapas? Confusion! We gave our best guess a go and it turned out to be the perfect amount for us - 3 Small Plates, 1 Large Plate and 1 Raw item. Our meal was brought out to us in 3 courses for sharing - our waitress knew what she was doing! Amuse Bouche - Fantastic bite! All I remember from the ingredients rattled off was micro greens but it was a harmonious bite for sure. Bowl of bread - Pretzel bun with their special butter is top notch! It honestly may have been my favorite part of the entire meal!  Small Plate 1 - Gnocchi - $12 - Not really a fan. I didn't find the gnocchi had much flavor and wasn't a big fan of this dish, overall. Small Plate 2 - Kalua pork - $11 - This pork in BBQ sauce was scrumptious! I wasn't into the banana bread but overall a great dish. Small Plate 3 - Cheese plate - $14 - ursinis, sunset bay, six-year cheddar, cured meats, pickled mushrooms & onions. I loved this plate! The cheese choices were great and it came with duck belly and pancetta as the cured meats. We could have used some crackers or fruit or something to pair the cheeses with. Raw Dish - Wagyu steak tartar - $10 - Cool, inventive dish! A tempura egg that seemed to be prepared 5:10 style, burst open over the wagyu making this dish super cool and super tasty. Loved the flavors in this and would get the dish again for sure. Large Plate - Halibut - $26 - Highly, highly, HIGHLY recommended. This may have been the most perfectly cooked fish I've ever had. It was moist and succulent and the whitest white I've ever seen. The halibut had a sesame pepper crust and was on a bed of black rice. Loved it, so glad I tried it, and I must say again that I highly recommend it! When one course finished, the plates were cleared and the next was immediately brought out. Not a second of lag time! Our total time eating was just an hour. Things got quite busy for our waitress though because once we finished we waited about 20 minutes for her to come by and drop off our bill. The same went for the table next to us. Another random sidenote, there was a couple on a date next to us. The guy flipped out on the girl because she said she liked beets! haha Fun times at sola.Total bill $99 including tax and tip.

We ordered: Tuna - Which the waiter stressed is their signature dish Short Ribs  Tuna - The waiter prewarned us that it was going to be mostly raw which I was fine with. It was a good portion size of fish and it was probably a good quality fish. I think it lacked some seasoning because the fish was bland and nothing really brought out the flavor. It was served with some breaded avocadoes but the breading just made the avocadoes crunchy and chewy. It didn't really complement the fish with. The rice that it was served with was good but for this being the signature dish, I don't think this was that great. Short Ribs - This is what I originally ordered. The short ribs were very tender and moist like the waiter promised. However, it was really salty so much so I switched my dish with my husband who seemed to tolerate it.

2012-08-14,4.0,"Solid brunch with friendly service.  I have been to Sola several times for brunch and each time I come, I am pleased.  It never seems to be too busy, which surprises me, given the food and the neighborhood.  I like to start my brunches with a cocktail and the red dawn mimosa always delivers (champagne and blood orange).  I also like the maui-mosa which is champagne combined with peach and passion fruit juices.  We tend to order the malasadas as a starter, which are these delicious donuts that come with chocolate and raspberry dipping sauces.  Then on to the main event -- I am a big fan of the short rib benedict.  The short ribs provide a nice compliment to the eggs and the pesto hollandaise definitely kicks this brunch item up a notch.  I am also a big fan of the huevos benedictos -- eggs benedict with chorizo and a salsa hollandaise. This is a great place for brunch with friends but I have also taken my parents to brunch here on occasion.  They have been very accommodating to us with our little man and I feel comfortable bringing a baby here. It's nice to be able to go out for a nicer brunch without feeling bad about having a kid around.  We tend to hit this place early (like right when it opens for brunch) so later it may not be quite so great with a kid.   If you're looking for a different brunch option in the North Center neighborhood, this is definitely one to try.  I'd like to check it out for dinner -- hopefully it will live up to the high standards set by the brunch.",0.9946,0.786,0.208,0.005,0.46669047619047616

2012-07-19,2.0,"What a wholly average experience. This attractive restaurant in North Center has received mixed reviews here on Yelp. Many people praise the food and lament the service. Some people praise the drinks and mention underwhelming food. Others hate everything. And a few of you, who I'll refer to as the low standards group, loved everything. I'm just kidding. That's not very nice. About the standards anyway. The hostess was friendly and quickly sat us at a table. I'd made a reservation via OpenTable, which really limits the opportunity for a hostess to shine. Maybe I should've created a complex seating dilemma? ""Yes, we'd like to make sure our table faces west. WEST, damnit!"" However, it took 15 minutes for us to get a visit from our waiter. We had barely placed our cocktail order before the waiter was gone again. I immediately noticed that he didn't look down at us. He was staring across the room. This was to be an ongoing theme for his demeanor. Maybe he's distracted I thought. Or maybe he's an aloof prick who is resentful of his job. Or us. Or his employer. Or life. Regardless of the reason, his lack of interest in his customers was apparent. Thirty minutes in, we managed to place our food order. I ordered the grilled octopus appetizer and the tuna entree. My date ordered the salmon. Rare. Once the order was actually taken, food arrived in a timely fashion. The grilled octopus was amazing (possibly the best I've ever had) and a nice treat, a cheese/vinegar amuse bouche was brought over. My tuna entree was plentiful, and honestly, was too much food. It seemed like 12 oz. of seared ahi. That's a huge hunking piece of raw fish, man! The quality was good, but Its flavor was lacking. I had gotten my fill a few bites in, so being left with nearly a pound of very, very mild fish was disappointing. My date's salmon was worse. Not only was it not rare, but it wasn't even medium rare. I'd say it was more towards medium. It's a damn shame, as the flavor was good despite this. A proper temperature would've made for an above average meal. Alas, after the $100 bill was settled, I was left completely uninspired, bored, anxious, and slightly annoyed. The average cocktails, poor service, mostly below average food (for the price point) left a bad taste in my mouth. Or wait, is that the nearly flavorless wasabi sauce that was dressed over my tuna?

2012-06-24,3.0,"Good food, but not the best service hence the three star review.  Thankfully I dined with a Groupon and saved $50. To start, the boyfriend and I shared the waygu steak tartar and the truffle fries.  The tartar came with a salad dressed with a very crisp, light and refreshing dressing that I could have eaten more of.  I enjoyed the creative presentation of the tartar as well.  The egg had a light fried batter coating - kinda like a tempura egg, which was really neat.  I could have eaten a lot more of that.  In retrospect, we overpaid big time for the fries - $10 including $2 for a truffle aioli, which was just OK.  The fries were good, but not worth the $ in my opinion.  I could have had more tartar for that price.  I had the salmon with the edamame puree and like the other reviewers, I found the ratio of fish to puree to be completely off.  There was way too much puree!  I've never had anything like it and I give them points for creativity.  But, it's weird because they have the consistency of mashed potatoes and to me, eating mashed potatoes and fish is weird.  I'm used to having some vegetable medley or succotash on the bottom.  Nevertheless, it was good and I ate it all.  Would I have it again?  Perhaps not - especially since the boyfriend's dish blew mine away. He had the pork chop, which came with a rice mixed with some mango and other yummy goodies.  The sauce to accompany the dish was sweet and the meat was cooked to perfection. Oh, side note - our server told us that the salmon and pork would be cooked medium rare.  Um... not so much for me.  I go, ""Um..."" and he goes, ""Well, we can cook it however you want!"" and so I requested to have it prepared more medium.  I just felt like it was so awkward to bring up how it's done.  Maybe he should have asked how I wanted it prepared before telling me how they do it.  That way, if he knew I wanted it medium he could have just done that instead of weirding me out with the suggestion as to how it's done.  The boyfriend okayed to have his done medium rare and it came out more medium and he was relieved at that. For dessert, we had the sorbet trio of guava, mango and passionfruit.  I highly recommend these items as a great palate cleanser after your meal. My only gripe was our server.  He wasn't particularly welcoming or friendly.  He wasn't downright rude or anything, but just didn't seem particularly thrilled to have us dining there.  He checked up on us just fine, but i just wasn't feel his service.  Honestly, I liked the people who brought out my food and refilled my water better.   Bottom line: good food and creative menu options.  I may give it a try and perhaps would have liked it better if I had a better server or had mine been friendlier.",0.9989,0.742,0.223,0.034,0.596063829787234

2012-06-21,3.0,"Slightly disappointed with Sola after all the great reviews. Creative pan-asian/hawaiian food with warm atmosphere. I recommend the tuna tartar appetizer (under the ""raw"" section).  I tried the salmon with the edamame puree, and the salmon was cooked perfectly but you couldn't really taste the truffle in the truffle-teriyaki sauce. I thought the portions were a little off because there was just TOO much edamame puree (tasty like mashed potatoes). Green bean tempura was good.  Skip the truffle fries (WAY BETTER AT HB restaurant!) The aioli was truly sub-par. Creative drinks as well (too strong for me!).  Dessert we had was super creative but honestly wasn't THAT tasty.. I never thought I'd say this but... too many flavors! Really strange service experience. Our waiter barely came to our table even when we tried to flag him down.

2012-06-10,4.0,"Still a good choice for dining al fresco- Sola was a bit of hit or miss the other night. The positives?  As I was waiting for the valet to come and park my car- one of the servers walked over and said that there was no valet on that particular night but that I should just lock up my car and leave it where it was.  Nice!  That same server then got us a couple of menus and found us a great table for two on the patio.  Too bad it wasn't in his section as I think he would have made our entire night! While the food was quite good on this visit, the service wasn't.  Our server came and went . . . .oftentimes leaving us with empty glasses or wanting for something.  Not sure what was going on but we had to keep flagging her down. She was pleasant, friendly and quick with suggestions . . .she just wasn't present the way she should have been. Now let's talk about the food- the good part of the night!  We started with the raw oysters.  I found it odd that they come 5 to a serving but oh well.  They were fresh and almost creamy.  But know that they don't come with the more traditional cocktail sauce and horseradish or even any kind of sauce.  Nope.   But still delicious! For our entrees we had the duck breast over risotto and the special of the night which were lamb chops stuffed with cheese.  The duck was good . . but those lamb chops were amazing!  Lightly breaded, every bite was a delight!

There have been ups & downs, though: downs are usually service related, but sometimes the cooking slumps. Still, I keep coming back because when it's good, it's very good. Tonight was a good night, probably because Chef Carol was in the kitchen. We are both suckers for the crisp mushroom salad - innovative, tasty, attractive. You must try it. Entrées were also terrific. A lovely boneless pork chop was glorified by a Vietnamese caramel sauce. My companion's sesame-crusted halibut was also nicely presented and yummy. For dessert, a trio of homemade ice creams hit a perfect note. The wine list is well chosen, though a bit pricier than it needs to be. Cappuccino was very good.

2012-05-30,3.0,"I had very high hopes for Sola, and unfortunately it let me down. :( Not enough for me to never go back, but enough to leave me disappointed. My boyfriend and I went together because he travels to Hawaii for work and was looking forward to sharing with me some similar dishes he's had on his trips there. We sat out on the patio, which was really nice. Our server was a friendly guy but seemed like he was spread a bit too thin. We waited a very long time before he took our drink order...then our appetizer order...then our main course order.  Unfortunately, they were out of the one thing my boyfriend really wanted me to try and had been raving about for months, the kalua pork. We decided on scallops instead. After another long wait, a different server brought out our main meals instead of our appetizer. Although that was annoying, we were impressed with the new server's insistence on bringing us out our appetizer and re-making our meals. She really went above and beyond to make up for another server's mistake (he didn't write it down). When the scallops did come out, they were fantastic and worth waiting for.  Then we got our main meals: tuna and pan-seared chicken. I cannot describe how amazing the chicken was. I rarely order a half chicken because I'm not a fan of bone-in, nor do I think chicken is the most exciting thing. However, this was phenomenal. It was crunchy and seasoned on the outside, juicy and tender on the inside and sitting in a delicious curry-like sauce. SO GOOD. My boyfriend liked his tuna, too. For dessert we decided on the flight of ice cream/sorbet. The server brought out a list of about 10 ice creams and five sorbets, and we chose our three: honey ginger ice cream, papaya sorbet and chocolate pepper ice cream. Unfortunately, there was nothing special about any of them. Although the service wasn't great, the servers were nice. And even though the one forgot to write down the appetizer, he did remember to write down my boyfriend's food allergies.

It wasn't spectacular, especially for the price, but with the groupon it was fine. The salads, crispy mushrooms and sea greens were great. I would say that the crispy mushroom was better though.  Mains were the tuna and the halibut. Really loved my tuna, but it did seem like a lot of wasabi underneath. The girlfriend loved the halibut and I thought it was really, really good as well. Overall, the service was kind of slow, but it was good. Really loved both our entrees and really liked our salads. With that, it definitely is a 4.

(it was my worst trial of the night)  Crispy mushroom salad: simple lots of arugula and slices of apple tossed together. nothing fancy about this. I can make this at home! Wagyu burger: it was good but how can you screwed up a burger really...  Truffle pamesan fries with truffle honey aioli: this is probably the best dish we've got. i can sense & taste the truffle. The aioli can be thicker  Wagyu hanger steak: ok.  Red bean cake: again way too sweet. They just have a lot of sweet components in one plate: red bean paste, sweet potato and etc. They have salty caramel but still it doesn't help much  the waiter kinda annoyed us, tried to keep the place while we barely finished the meal yet. the atmosphere was good but the flavor was just not there. i won't go back here again",0.9713,0.785,0.147,0.067,0.44627329192546583

Thebest advice I can give is that if a flavor combination sounds reeeeally strange, ORDER IT (I'm looking at you, banana bread topped with BBQ pulled pork). The menu is small by Cheesecake Factory-type restaurant standards, but every single thing on it is carefully crafted and delicious. The portions are also ""small"" by today's gargantuan standards, but they're actually closer to normal human-sized portions, and you will not leave hungry.  Our server's friendliness was outstripped only by her helpfulness in navigating the menu to make delicious choices. She also seemed to have a good relationship with the chef and was able to give input on exactly how each dish was created and served. The pho-jito is the greatest cocktail I've ever had; you won't even miss the booze. We were so impressed with how flat-out delicious everything we ordered was (and we ordered quite a lot for just two people) that we asked our server to let the chef know how pleased we were. Our server obviously did so because a few moments later the chef was at our table graciously thanking us for the compliments.

The first time I came here I got an entree for myself and this most recent time we got a bunch of small plates to try everything and it was a much better option! For our small plates we ordered - the tuna tartare, artichoke fritters, seared scallops, and kalua pork. The tuna tartare and kalua pork were definitely the stars of this meal. A visit to Sola would not be complete without these two! The artichoke fritters were ok but they had a cornmeal breading on them and I think a lighter breading should have been used. The seared scallops was delicious and cooked well. For dessert, we ordered the trio of ice cream flavors. We ordered the fresh mint chocolate, salted caramel, and one other one that I can't remember. They have about 20 different flavors of really unique ice creams. You should at least ask just to see the ice cream and sorbet list because there are so many interesting flavors! For drinks, I ordered the black sand beach martini which was their take on the lemon drop martini. Instead of sugared rim, it has a black salted rim. Interesting idea - and having been to the black sand beaches in hawaii I liked the creativity - but overall I like the plain sugared rim better.

The ability to secure a reservation sealed our fate, and I was very excited to share in the brunch-magic with my female compadres.  And magic, it was not. From the very beginning our brunch experience was mediocre at best, verging on somewhat disastrous.  I won't give a play-by-play, but suffice it to say:  *slow on the coffee *overcooked eggs on the benedict - sent back.  *forgotten cocktails - 25 minutes *average french toast (and this was something I'd had before and loved!) - sort of cold.  *lackluster service - absentminded/negligent moreso than rude.  *incorrect bill, incorrect charges on credit cards resulting in a restart.  After years of sending folks to Sola, I have to say I couldn't do so in good faith anymore.

2012-03-30,3.0,"My take? Come for dinner. As vaunted as brunch was, it didn't quite satisfy. But, there has to be a reason so many people rave about sola. My guess is that they came for dinner. I didn't dislike anything about my brunch and one thing - in particular - called me 'Susan': the malasadas. First off, just say it a few times. It's fun, right? Then, prepare to sneeze on the dish as soon as it comes out because you're going to want it all to yourself. These sugary, Portuguese-style donuts come with a rich, chocolate fudge sauce and a tart, fruity raspberry coulis. It's like getting the best part of a filled donut (the filling) and getting to eat as much of it as you want. Had I had a brunch full of malasadas, I would, definitely, have given sola 4 stars or more. I'd also have a 44 waist, DDs and many more lonely nights. Portion control is our friend. Beach season is coming and my Baywatch reunion mates are real b!tches. But, sadly for me (and sola) brunch was more than just malasadas (I am determined to say it as much as possible). The Maui Mosa which started my meal left me a bit flat. On paper, sparkling wine, passionfruit and pineapple juice sounds like a no-brainer. In execution... not so much. I would have been more satisfied with a regular mimosa or maybe I just didn't have a well-crafted one. I was still on a high from my malasadas, so I hadn't given up hope. I needed to decide between the breakfast wrap and egg sandwich. Given ingredients like kalua pork, avocado, bean, egg, and spinach, the wrap was an easy sell. It's frustrating, then, that with every bite, I was, like, ""the magic starts... NOW!... Now?... now?"" I just don't understand how I was so bored by a dish with good ingredients. Not only did I find it bland but I was disinterested in finishing. Me. Disinterested in eating. That says something. sola has plenty of fans and few detractors. I don't think I am either. Perhaps if I came back for dinner, I'd change my mind... but I don't see that happening anytime soon.",0.9384,0.877,0.091,0.031,0.5253047415547416

At the very least, just to give everyone a taste of my experience, here is the letter I wrote to the chef/owner. ""Hey Carol,   My girlfriend and I came to your restaurant and wanted to let you know that we absolutely loved your staff. Jenny, the very cute blonde that appears to run the hosting scene of things was a pleasurable person to encounter when first entering the door. She has a beautiful smile and a lovely personality. She also was able to pull up our reservation and seat us immediately. Now on to Pete our server. A very handsome and helpful fellow. My girlfriend and I both agreed that he looks exactly like Scott Speedman, AKA Ben Covington from a show called Felcitiy, but we did not notify him of this fact in fear of embarassing him. He's a charmer too. Definitely had it going on with making my girlfriend laugh and smile. I'm all about that when we go out to eat. Impress my partner and you leave me feeling happy. On a side note, I'm a server too, and I know there are a lot of people in our business that don't go out of there way to do a song and a dance to please the guest. They are there to take you order, serve your food, and maybe give you an occasional refill on your drink if they remember to check. Not Pete, he's one of the good ones. Love Him! He was also very kind in understanding our situation with having to leave to watch a friends presentation before we were able to eat the dessert we ordered. I'm a complete bozo and I should have let him know that we are on time contraints from the get go, but I didn't, so he paced the meal as I normally expected it should be. We finished our main course and came back a couple hours later to continue where we left off. Oh man was that bananna sundae thing good! I'm actually glad we were able to let our food digest. With the appetizer, salad, and main course....I just dont think we could have pulled it off, and if we did, I'm not sure if it would have appreciated as much if we were to have rushed through it.   So long story short, if you haven't gotten this much so far: A) You have people that look like models working at your place :o) B) They are very kind and friendly. C) We love them. Thanks for the great dining experience. I hope the restaurant continues to do well. See you soon.""",0.9993,0.723,0.255,0.022,0.5269509043927648

The place was full staffed and pleasant and inviting.    The hostess looked over at a large group of people and said it looks like some of your party is here.  We were afraid they would think since we arrived early that our party for seven wouldn't show up so we told the hostess that  we were early.   When my boyfriend and I arrived early since we live only a couple miles down the street,  I was pleased to see our table for seven being saved as we scurried to the bar and ordered espresso.  They make delicious mojitos non alcoholic and I learned that they use the mild and tangy ginger which I like in a few drinks and dishes.   The enthusiast bar tender brought our hot drinks and came back to give us our check to move to the tables. I let the hostess know our party would be late and that my boyfriend and I wanted to sit at the table to wait.  And she asked if we were paid out at the bar.   Then a woman came and asked if she could take the five menus and replace them later like they didn't have enough menus to go around.  I said ok and she did bring more menus later and the bread basket didn't arive until all seven people were sitting down.  While my boyfriend and I sat at the large round table waiting our server took our order for two appetizers but couldn't bring their bread basket.    The party of ours arrived soon and we ordered a plate of kalua pork with bbq sauce and banana bread for an appetizer.  The pot stickers were small and dry with very little duck confit fillings for $12.   The sirloin burger called the wagyu burger with french fries cooked in truffle oil was delicious. Our party of seven ate heartily salmon, roasted chicken breast in apple cider liquer, Ahi Ahi Tuna Steak, and short ribs for mom, and the dessert was eye catching, a chocolate sundae, banana flavoring, and some kinda crusty and dried out truffles that fell apart with one bite.   Although we enjoyed the food and service, I felt the night was very crowded and the poor servers barely had any room getting around everyone.  The tables were so close together and we were all kinda crammed.  I enjoyed the jubilant servers and there efficiency although the art on the walls did not flatter their colorful and exotic menu items and atmosphere.  I think more of the elegant side of the Hawaiin style could be enhanced in the ambiance here.  For example, large flowers of purple and blue or fruit basket decor with coconuts and or pineapples.

Unfortunately, our experience did not live up to the years of anticipation.  We were seated near the fireplace, which was a great cozy seat on cold evening.  The inside of sola is pretty, but spare and the tv showing the basketball over the bar seemed incongruous in a restaurant charging $28 for entrees.  Our waitress was adorable, friendly and prompt (serious shout out to her - I didn't catch her name, but she had a British accent).   The breadbasket to start was awesome (honestly, probably the high point of the meal - if pretzel rolls are wrong, I don't want to be right).  We started with the much ballyhooed artichoke fritters.  I don't know what I was expecting, but these were disappointing - not terribly flavorful and just a bit...odd.  I don't think artichokes really lend themselves to fritter-izing all that well.  I thought both of the accompanying sauces were okay, but my dining companion did not care for the aioli at all.  For our mains we opted for a whitefish special and the wagyu burger to split.  The whitefish was far and away the better of the two, but I still wasn't as blown away by the entree as I expected to be at this pricepoint.  The burger was pretty disappointing.  It was a little dry and nothing special - I couldn't taste the difference in the wagyu beef at all.  The truffle fries on the side were good, but we both agreed that the burgers at Bad Apple, a much lower scale restaurant, are actually better (and I don't necessarily think those are that fantastic, either). All in all dinner was fine, but not worth the menu prices.  The general public seems to agree with me since sola constantly has coupons and specials (They offer their own ""solupon"" on their website now for $25 for $50 towards dinner.  They're also  restaurant.com , gdine, savored, and have offered Groupons.)  Unfortunately there was nothing about dinner at sola that would compel me to return.  That said, I've heard great things about the brunch and would be willing to go back to give that a shot.",0.994,0.754,0.17,0.075,0.6073714285714286

2012-02-13,4.0,"Hawaiian fusion? How could I not like it? The food was outstanding.  I had their special for the night which was a fish native to Hawaii (I forgot the name...shocker) but it was delicious and just the right amount.  My co-diner had the short rib and was also a big fan. Personally, I think if you come here, you should order fish or some type of seafood.  I don't think red meat is their specialty.   We sat at the bar as we came on a Friday night without a reservation. The bartender was awesome, super friendly, attentive and made great cocktails. The only thing I want to say that is not favorable about this place is the woman who greeted us when we came in.  We had called before to see if there was an opening. She informed us that there wasn't but that the wait might not be too long so she took our name down.   Once we got there, she recognized the name and got a bit of an attitude when we asked how long she thought it would be.  We knew we didn't have a reservation so we were not expecting to sit down right away.  We were more than happy to grab some drinks at the bar after a long week. Her response and general demeanor is what threw me.  Her response over and over again (like a broken record) was, ""I can't promise you anything. I have no idea. If someone doesn't come in, then you can have their table"".  Ok, fine. So if someone didn't come in, what is the soonest you think a table would be available?....broken record resumes. Sidebar:  we sat at the bar and had a lovely dinner but sure enough about 20 minutes, 3 tables opened up and by the time we left only half the restaurant was full. Service can be a deal breaker for me. Thankfully the bartender and great food made up for this woman's poor attitude.",0.9944,0.774,0.177,0.049,0.5547959183673472

Also, I believe they are on  savored.com , so you can get 30% off your entire bill if you sign up. Things to try at Sola: -Salmon or Cobia -Pork: They serve it two ways on your plate (cheek and tenderloin) Super juicy and tender, just how a cheek and a loin should be. ;) -Mushroom fried salad or Duck pot stickers to start. -The various breads(pretzel, wheat, flat bread) are not to be missed, so grab a piece or two. -Sesame ice cream or Mango. You won't regret it. Nice affordable wine list and attentive service. Very warm and welcoming environment that is hoppin on a Saturday night.

I forgot the name, but the server said it was a triple cream brie...and creamy it was! Burger was cooked to perfection and the pretzel bun was a nice touch. The truffle fries were amazing and I could eat them plain.  Place was packed for a Friday night, so I would suggest reservations.

2012-01-19,4.0,"It would've been tough for dinner service to hold up to the high standard of my brunch experience here.  Still, we had a pretty tasty meal that felt just a little overpriced to me. We were very impressed with the bread basket we were started with, containing what was clearly fresh baked sourdough, a pretzel roll, and an ingenius lavash style cracker with a complex blend of spices that I couldn't identify but kept me eating and guessing.  We started with the artichoke fritters which were wonderfully delicately breaded and fried, but were served with two overpowering dipping sauces, a truffle aioli (sadly it is possible to be over truffled) and a pungent lime soy sauce. My entree was pretty spectacular.  A delightful piece of seared medium rare salmon, served on an out of this world edamame puree and surrounded in a fantastic truffle teriyaki sauce (much subtler than the aioli and a far better match for its accompaniment). My wife's entree was tasty as well, if not quite as perfect.  Despite a rich, fork-tender piece of short rib served on top of a nice base of barley that provided a welcome al dente bite, there was some barely perceptible intangible that was wrong with this dish.  I wish I could put my finger on it. We finished with a five-spice creme brulee, which was quite a novel take on this classic french dessert, giving a gentle suggestion of savory liveliness melded with the creamy sub-saccharine body of this dish. I am sure we will be back to try out some more of the dinner offerings here (and to drink another Anderson Valley Boont Amber Ale, which I have not seen anywhere else but Sola).  But for me, brunch is still where this place shines the brightest.",0.9967,0.746,0.225,0.029,0.662996632996633
2012-01-18,4.0,"Just came back from dinner at Sola, and both of us are pretty satisfied.  We like trying new places, and Sola's Hawaiian inspired menu sounded intriguing.  Walking into the place at 8pm on a Wednesday night, the place was packed except for a private room off to the side.  Warm, modern ambiance, but it was so loud we could barely hear the server.  Based on other reviews, we tried the Kalua Pork and Artichoke Fritters for appetizers, and had the Steak Tartare and Raw Tuna, along with a side of Mac and Cheese for our main entree.  Kalua Pork - very sweet, like a honey bbq flavor, which was also served on top of banana bread. Artichoke Fritters - I'm surprised how much I really like artichokes in this fashion.  About 6 to an order, with 2 very interesting sauces. Raw Tuna - This was my favorite.  It tastes like a piece of tuna maki with wasabi and tobiko, and had so much flavor and spice, that it just hit the spot. Steak Tartare - Neither of us cared for this.  Maybe because we just finished the Tuna dish, and the flavors of the two dishes did not mesh well together. Mac n Cheese - I'm always tempted to try my child hood favorite everywhere I go, and I was not disappointed.  Absolutely delicious!  At first glance, my husband thought the dishes were small, but we both left satisfied after finishing our meal.  Sola has a cool wine and beer list, along with many interesting Signature cocktails. Service was awesome - the way it should be always!  I can see myself comparing future service experiences to the way we had it at Sola's!   Will definitely return.

2012-01-12,4.0,"Lately the hubby and I have been allowing Groupon to dictate where our ritual Date Night dinner will take place each week.  This can be good, and this can be bad.  Last night Groupon sent us to Sola, which was very, very good. The place was a little hard to find:  The address is on Lincoln, but the restaurant itself is on Byron.  However, we overcame that obstacle fairly easily.  The interior is all clean lines and earth tones, definitely appealing to me.  Staff was friendly.  We were seated across from the fire place.  Always a plus. The server started us off with a little amuse-bouche of goat cheese and green apple on a cracker.  Simple but tasty.  They also offer an array of intriguing cocktails.  I tried something involving ginger vodka and passion fruit which was quite good.  Hubby had the especially tasty non-alcoholic ""Pho-jito.""   The Groupon was good for one appetizer, two soups/salads, and two entrees.  The menu had a lot to offer.    We started with some artichoke fritters with two dipping sauces:  A soy lime sauce, which I liked, and a truffle aioli, which I was afraid the hubby was going to eat with a spoon.  He followed that with a bowl of bowl of pho and I had a salad with apples, walnuts, and cheese.  Both of us were well pleased with our choices.   Then came the main course.  I'm a vegetarian, and, although it is much easier for a vegetarian to dine out now than it was in years past, sometimes the vegetarian offerings are just not that inspired.  I don't need a lot of choices on a menu, so long as the choices that are offered are good.  At Sola, there is one vegetarian entrée, which they call Greens and Grains.  Not very descriptive, but I suppose that this allows the chef to vary the offering with the season. Which I think is great.  Currently, Greens and Grains consists of couscous with roasted brussel sprouts and green beans, topped by a slab of seared tofu in a teriyaki sauce.  Oh, it was yummy!  I'd have been just as happy without the tofu, but I do understand why it was there.  The brussel sprouts were delightful.   Hubby was equally pleased with his ginger-glazed salmon, perched atop an edamame puree. Desert menu looked intriguing, but alas, we were too full to partake of it.  Next time, for sure.",0.9964,0.794,0.171,0.036,0.5820446950710109

The room -- very nice-- classy beiges, neat pendent lighting -- except for the huge flat screen TV over the bar, which hits a really false aesthetic note.  We went on a Satuday night and the place was mobbed.  Nice for Sola's owners but it was like every table was screaming to be heard and the noise level made any real conversation impossible.  So my girlfriend and I -- who had looked forward to a nice talk about all sorts of things -- just managed to stare at each other over the two-top and shout a few words. The service -- Our waitress was very nice and professional.   The menu reads really yummy, but the food on the plate was sort of boring.   I ordered the pot sticks for appetizers but the waitress suggested the artichoke fritters instead -- saying Sola was  'known for' its fritters which were served with a truffle aioli dipping sauce.  I'd seen positive mention of the fritters on Yelp so I went with the suggestion.  To my dismay, the artichokes were canned (or perhaps frozen), certainly not fresh.  The batter was light and non-greasy, but the 'aioli' on the side was runny-- not thick like a good aioli should be -- but the truffle oil made it relatively tasty, which is sort of a cheap trick.  My friend had a salad with crispy mushrooms, which she was was decent but nothing special. I ordered the tuna with wasabi crust and some risotto.  The crust on the tuna was very nice and the risotto was decent, but very mildly flavored.  The only problem with the dish was the fish itself . . . seared on the outside and served raw/cold in the middle.  That's great if you have impeccably fresh tuna.  This tasted like it was a day past impeccably fresh. My friend had the salmon.  She didn't mention it while we were eating (probably because of noise level and impossibility of conversation), but I asked as we left how it was.  She said it was okay but nothing special. We were pretty full so for dessert we just shared a scoop of ginger ice cream.  It was the highlight of the meal. Bottom line?  I'll give it one more try on a weeknight when hopefully the noise level will  be tolerable and I'll order some different dishes- maybe try the pork..  If that doesn't turn out to be a better meal, I'd give it a pass.  There are too many good restaurants in town to spend money on places that are just three star level.",0.9954,0.771,0.164,0.065,0.5700322553263731

2011-10-16,3.0,"A great chef knows how to bring together quality ingredients that create new flavor combinations.  If done well, you'll be singing, ""A Whole New World"" after every course.  Chef Carol Wallack creates these amazing flavor profiles, but only when you eat as instructed. The amouse bouche that came out first was the foretelling of her style.  A single tortilla chip-like crisp, lovingly cupped a tiny spot of bbq sauce unagi and a slice of banana.  A single bite that was all fishy, sweet, savory, and crunchy all in a moment's bliss. But other courses, when deconstructed, didn't stand up on their own.  The gooey chocolate cake was just chocolate cake, even a bit dry at first bite.  But when put in combination with the ice cream and the special sauce, it is transformed.  The Kalua pork just okay, but when scooped into your mouth with a bite of the moist banana bread and microgreens, it was a thing of beauty. These dishes left me perplexed.  I wanted more of the tantalizing sweet and savory experience, and yet, since none of the dish's main attractions stood out, I'm was left un-satisfied.  I will leave that  culinary conundrum for some other sap! One combination, however, absolutely failed.  Great service with personality and flair didn't mix with the interior that reminded me more of a corporate hotel lobby.  With food so intimate and tables so close, you think they could have created an atmosphere where you felt more like home and could actually enjoy your dinner company.",0.9946,0.758,0.21,0.031,0.4860516934046347

She went out of her way to check with the kitchen about the dishes I was interested in and let me know what was safe and what could be accommodated with alterations.  Everything I ate was delicious.  If you have to eat gluten-free (and can freely eat soy), this is an amazing restaurant with a gluten-free menu that rivals the regular menu.  I was especially excited to eat the soft-shell crab since at most places it is battered or dredged in flour and then fried.  At Sola it was cooked in a delicious sauce with a side of pork belly.  It was wonderful.  My only suggestion is to put the gluten-free menu on their website.  We will definitely be returning to Sola.",0.9844,0.83,0.16,0.011,0.5987179487179487
2011-09-24,4.0,"I brought my sister to Sola for her birthday this past week and we both had a really wonderful experience. Inside is warmly lit with yellow lights hanging from the ceiling and large front windows. My sister and I sat at a table by the window. The server asked us if we felt a draft (I did not) and offered to adjust the ceiling vents if we wanted (I thought it was nice of her). The service really was peachy. Karen was our server and she was all smiles and friendly butterflies, but was still professional and did not hover. I liked that the hostess also helped with bringing food to the tables even though they weren't very busy. We had a really wonderful amuse bouche that looked unimpressive but was extremely flavorful. We chose to order truffle fries, onion rings, and artichoke fritters to start followed by some small salads for entrees. The fries and onions both came in tall glasses lined with parchment paper. They were both delicious. We could see the truffle oil collecting at the bottom on the onion ring glass and took that as a sign of liberal quality. The artichoke fritters really were the star of the evening though. They were crispy on the outside and warm and soft on the inside. They were not greasy. My sister got the tomato salad and I got the sea greens salad. We both preferred her salad over mine. I like sea weed, but this one seemed to have grainy, crunchy dirt mixed in with it. I hated feeling the grittiness in my teeth. Our cocktails were also wonderful - especially the lavender one. I highly recommend it. It was refreshing and light. For dessert I got the bean cake. It was the perfect portion for a dainty dessert. There was a cube of cake, a small scoop of ice-cream, bacon flavored jelly cubes, and some sort of drizzle on the plate. All together it was amazing. As far as price goes, I think everything was priced splendidly. It's a great price for really inventive food, good service, and a great atmosphere. I think it'd be a good place to bring someone special for a lovely evening without breaking the bank. Our entire dinner came to about $85 (and that includes alcohol).",0.9972,0.769,0.196,0.034,0.6411538461538461
2011-09-20,4.0,"I can't believe I forgot to write my review of sola! After being on my to-do list, I finally made it to this place! I admit the main reason I wanted to dine at sola was for the waygu beef burger. It looked delish and sounded to die for. Anyone who really knows me knows that I like da beef! There is so much more to sola than a waygu beef burger on a pretzel bun with caramelized onion & cambozola and truffle parmesan fries. Although if there weren't, I'm pretty sure I'd be happy with JUST the burger.  My pals and I dove right into the menu and ordered up the artichoke fritters, the roasted beet & pineapple salad, kalua pork and gnocchi....oh and the waygu beef burger of course! After all, that was my reason for bookmarking sola in the first place! Everything we had was delicious and spot on. We didn't exactly get the Hawaiian influence but it was all very tasty just the same. The stand outs for me were the gnocchi and also the artichoke fritters b/c the truffle aioli was sinful. The burger was quite delicious as well, cooked to perfection and something I would be happy to eat again. The fries were amazeballs...even moreso dipped in the truffle aioli. The pork was also another favorite at our table, but how can you not love a dish that contains bacon bread pudding? Exactly.  We rounded out our meal with dessert. We ordered two but I only remember one...the adzuki bean cake with kabocha squash and sweet miso ice cream. The kabocha squash is an interesting vegetable. In fact, I had just been introduced to it at another establishment prior to my visit to sola. The kobocha squash is often dubbed the ""Japanese pumpkin"" as it has a similar texture and sweetness but it can also have the same flavor and texture similar to that of a potato - which how I first had this vegetable (it was in a Thai dish to be more specific). Anyways, I was really curious to see what Chef Wallack would do with the kabocha. My friends were hesitant to order this up but were singing a different tune once they tried it. One of the more memorable desserts I've had while dining out.  I am happy that sola has been scratched off my to-do list but have a feeling it will land itself back on my list sooner rather than later.",0.9916,0.83,0.13,0.04,0.5402667548500882

Great service - funny, chatty host;  fast refills, plate clearing, food service.  Nice, friendly server.   Food was beautifully presented, though portions could have been a little larger for the price of the entrees (several were $28 or so).  I ordered the mahi-mahi special - served with an onion miso broth, wilted greens and truffled peaches.  It was good - not the best mahi dish I've ever had, but still pretty and tasted good.  I tried the panko-crusted tuna steak dish, which I actually preferred over mine.   All in all, a fine, upscale but not too upscale place to dine.  Lots of great seafood options, all with unique twists and side dishes.  They do have a few other standbys for people looking for chicken, steak or just a burger.",0.9871,0.75,0.237,0.013,0.573309449171518
2011-09-15,3.0,"Spent an evening at Sola for my friend's birthday this past Saturday. Everyone raves about the brunch that they serve, I almost wish I went for brunch instead of dinner.  We were a party of 7 and ordered 2 appetizers: the tuna poke for $15 and the kalua pot stickers for $10. The tuna poke was just ok, a little fishy. I thought the flavors weren't very strong and the fishiness overwhelmed the rest of the dish. The best part of the pot stickers was the mango salsa.  The ladies I was with loved the kumquat mojitos although by the end of the evening, there was significantly less kumquats in the glasses compared to earlier in the evening.  For dinner, I had the waygu flat iron steak. They recommended medium rare, but I'm not a rare kind of girl so I stuck with medium. Even if I had gotten medium rare, it would not have improved the tendon running through my steak. For an upscale restaurant charging $30 for a steak, I had higher expectations for the quality of the steak. Amongst the 7 of us, we had the ahi tuna, barrimundi, scallops, halibut,  I just felt like I wasn't getting what i was paying for. The meal wasn't bad, but I wouldn't go back for dinner. I tried all the other dishes and while they were cooked to the proper temperature, I didn't think they were outstanding or worth a trip back. the flavors didn't really meld for me.",0.9419,0.855,0.11,0.035,0.45702898550724635
2011-09-13,3.0,"A long overdue visit to this talked about restaurant left me satisfied, but not so much that I am ready to come back.  Tasty food and good service overall.  The main reason is price.  We had a groupon to use, so we did get $25 off the meal - and it was our anniversary, so we may have spent more than normal.  But even so, it was too much money for what we got. We shared 3 of the small plates and a side of fries.  My favorite was the seared scallops, but at $14 a plate, we only got 2 scallops.   We each got to have one and then done.  Bummer. Sadness. We also had the kalua pork ($11)  which was a little more substantial and very tasty as well.  The soft shell crab ($15) was the third plate, and while it had good flavor I didn't care for the texture of it.  The fries ($8)... good potential, but they were stuck together and almost soggy.  I prefer a little crispiness.  The one plus here was that because they serve them in the glass, they stay hot. The ""kick in the bill"" for us were the cocktails.  We each had a mixed drink first (about $12 ea) and a bottle of wine at $40.   The entire wine list was higher than normal to pick from, and we picked one on the lower end.  With tax, a $120 meal.  Fine for this special occasion, but probably won't go back, except our friends say the ice cream is to die for.  So, maybe a litttle dessert trip :)",0.9667,0.783,0.145,0.072,0.48647486772486775

I have been here both on Saturdays and Sundays anytime after 11:00am and it's never busy. Ever. It's the perfect spot.  Usually, I tend to get the Green Market omelet (which has seasonal vegetables and goat cheese). It comes with toast and breakfast potatoes. It's so good! My other favorite is the ham and cheese French toast. Thick country ham and Swiss cheese surrounded by French toast with mustard honey and plum preserves. The mustard honey threw me off - at first. But it went so well with the plum preserves and the sandwich, I can't think of anything else that could go with it. And the plum preserves? I want a jar to take home. And smother everything in it. Service is always great. They usually have no problem letting you linger over coffee. Or give you a few more minutes with the menu -- there are always 2-3 items that make it hard for me to choose!

2011-09-01,2.0,"It saddens me that this will be my very first yelp review, as I wanted to enjoy my experience here so much. I first had dinner at sola about 4 years ago and was so blown away by the pork tenderloin I ate that night that I've been ranting and raving about the restaurant ever since. So, when my boyfriend told me that we would be celebrating our 3 year anniversary here, I was extremely excited to finally visit again! When we entered, I was disappointed to see that the beautiful elevated dining area of the restaurant was closed and we were seated at a bare table next to the windows looking out on the patio. Okay, fine--but it felt like we were having a quick workday lunch instead of a special occasion dining experience. The giant plasma TV hovering over the bar really detracted from the elegance of the room. The reservation noted our special occasion, so I would have thought they'd reserve a table in the middle of the room for us so that we could enjoy the beautiful lighting. Guess not. Okay, so the ambiance is not what I'd expected--at least the food will be amazing...right??   The seared scallop appetizer was my favorite part of the meal. Sweet, salty, and a bit spicy with a wasabi crust. The accompanying veggies were nice and the mushrooms were soo good, but there were only two (very small) scallops and that was a bit of a bummer. We also ordered the gnocchi and that was kind of 'blah', but I do love ramps. The truffle fries were truffle fries and you really can't go wrong with truffle fries--my boyfriend loved them. Still starving because of the tiny portions of our appetizers and our inability to eat too many truffle fries, I was looking forward to our entrees. I ordered the tuna and my bf got the wagyu steak. There was definitely some time spent wondering when our food was coming and, after looking around, I realized that there appeared to be only one waiter for the 12 or so tables that needed to be served (what?!). My water glass sat only a quarter-full for most of the meal (trying to be optimistic here) and I only had one glass of wine because I was never offered another--nor could I flag the waiter down as he flew past our table to help the other neglected guests.  So anyway, we finally get our entrees. All I can say about the tuna/tempura avocado/bamboo rice: soft/soft/soft and subtle. The texture of my dinner was so consistently mushy and so subtly flavored that I stopped eating it out of sheer boredom. The tuna was of great quality and cooked perfectly, but I couldn't really taste the mustard in the crust and there was virtually no ""crunch"" to it. The avocado was a big disappointment as, having eaten/made love to the tempura-fried avocado at The Drawing Room, I had high expectations. Here, it was more like fried avocado as there was no fluffy, flavorful or crispy coating as is expected with foods with tempura in their names, yanno? I would have liked some kind of bright and bold flavor or texture somewhere in the dish, but never found either. My boyfriend seemed a bit uninspired by his meal but wanted more food on his plate because, well, he was still hungry. We agreed that the small portions would have been completely acceptable if the flavors were more unique and the service had been better. My wine glass was empty for the entirety of my entree. For dessert we ordered the soft centered chocolate cake because I had a chocolate hankering. Meh. Again, we ate our tiny portion with our tiny dessert spoons (gotta stay consistent, I guess) and wished there was more sesame ice cream on the plate (it seemed to have been scooped on with our tiny spoons) because that was the most interesting thing about the dessert. The cake itself was a snooze. After we finished that, they brought out two little chocolate truffles with ""Happy Anniversary"" written on the plate in chocolate--the waiter managed to squeeze in half a moment to say ""Congratulations"" before running off to another table. It was a nice touch, but that was about as special as we got to feel that night. We often compare our nights out to the incredibly special and attentive experience we had celebrating my bf's birthday at Joe's on Grand last year--the service at sola was not even in the same ballpark. This is the world's longest yelp review, I'm sorry. The experience was just so deflating. I understand that they're trying a different concept with this space, but why does the customer's experience have to suffer while they transition?

I knew nothing of the restaurant besides the fact that it was across the street from the theatre we'd be going to later in the evening. We went in on a Wednesday evening and there was absolutely no wait and we were quickly seated on the patio, which we had requested. We were assisted by several different staff members - one brought the water, one brought the bread, so I was a little confused as to who our server may have been at first.  I'll break it down... SERVICE: Prompt, not pushy or slow. Just right. Other than the initial server confusion, of course! Waiter even had our food split in half before it came out to the table, made it much easier for my friend and I to share. However, it is important to note that you should tell the waiter you want your check split up front, or else at the end of your meal they cant go back and split it. Frustrating, but understandable.  FOOD: We split the artichoke fritters, the chicken entree, and the truffle parmesan fries. And it was worth the price we paid! I could not stop eating those fries, they were like heaven in my mouth. I also had a LOVELY pineapple mojito. Definitely recommended. We also received samples of a salmon dish, compliments of the chef...which were also delicious.

Let's start with the good. The burger! It was on my ""to do"" list of best burgers in Chicago, and I can see why! It was excellent, definitely in my top 10. Three of the four of us ordered that and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. Properly cooked, good flavor, great toppings, on a perfect pretzel roll. The fries good, and an order of the mac & cheese we got to share was tasty as well. And the not so good? Let's start with the service. I skimmed some recent reviews before writing this one, and saw several with things like ""while the waitress was friendly and knowledgeable, service was quite slow"" and that pretty much matches my experience. The waitress was nice and had a lovely English accent. But we had to ask for bread, and then got a basket with two rolls and 2 big cracker-like slabs for a table of four. Drinks took too long to appear, and the food seemed a bit delayed, too. At least we got an amuse bouche! Then there were the desserts. All in all they were a bit disappointing. The portions were small (in all honesty, they are about how big a dessert for one probably should be, but for $8-9 we were expecting a typically large restaurant-sized serving). The angel food cake was not very light, and the ""chocolate chip ice cream"" it came with turned out to be MINT chocolate chip, and the mint was quite strong (they clearly used real mint, so props for that...but it was a bit much). The sundae was better, but there seemed to be as much whipped cream as there was ice cream. So even with an outstanding burger, the flaws keep this a ""strong 3 stars"" . . . not quite a four.

Food:  stellar.  We were served a nice amuse bouche which was goat cheese and apples on a fried wonton.  My only complaint is with the price of the scallop appetizer; $14 for two scallops with some veggies is outlandish.  We expected more, though they were super tasty.  I had the tuna with bamboo rice and it was cooked perfectly, and by that, I mean the tuna was rare as can be inside and nicely seared with some crunchy goodness on the outside.  Not cheap at $28 but worth it.  He had the Wagyu burger and loved every minute of it.  Cooked medium-rare to order and served on a delightful pretzel bun with truffle parmesan fries, which he also loved.

2011-08-15,2.0,"We'd wanted to dine at Sola for a while since it has great reviews, a constantly changing menu and is in the neighborhood. Unfortunately, I left disappointed and feeling a bit salty after our recent dinner there. Literally. Atmosphere: We went here on a weekday and only one of the two dining rooms was open. The décor was pleasant and the lighting steals the show. The seating is nice and open with a mix of open booths and tables.   There is a decent sized bar on the end and a nice fireplace which I'm sure makes this place feel cozy in the winter months.  The crowd was a bit older than expected (nothing wrong with that) and the outdoor patio was also open. We opted to sit indoors. Service: Our waitress was very pleasant and kind, however, service was SLOOOOOOOOOW. It seemed evident from the looks on other diners' faces that they too were frustrated with the pace of service.  It appeared that there were not enough servers.  The waitresses also had to make their own drinks. What is the point of having a bar without a bartender? Also, it was a nice evening so people were seated both indoors and outdoors so perhaps that exacerbated the problem of what seemed to be short staffing. Food: I ordered the Wagyu Hangar Steak with Swiss chard over a sweet potato purple potato pancake. The steak itself was tasty - very juicy and well flavored. However the portion was very small. My main issue was that the rest of the course was extremely salty to the point where it was inedible - especially the chard. The sweet potato pancake also soaked up a lot of the saltiness and just had a really off taste. I was really hungry still since we skipped an appetizer and most of my meal (sans the steak) was inedible so in my desperation I  took a bite of what seemed like a fried potato chip only to find it was roasted elephant garlic!

Unfortunately, my last dining experience there, for my birthday, was beyond disappointing. The service was so horribly bad, it almost seemed like a joke. The server had a horrible attitude and made us feel unwelcome. From greeting our table 20 minutes after we were seated, to serving our appetizers before our first drink, to literally rolling his eyes when we ordered a after dinner drink. The list goes on for this dinner fiasco. Ok, he may have had a bad night. However, the owner was not there when we left, so I sent the owner an email expressing my disapointment and my husband also contacted her. Neither of us heard back. To me, that is just unacceptable for a good owner to not care about her customers. The food is excellent, but I can't get past the owner's lack of care or consideration.

We decided to try the softshell crab and scallop appetizers. I haven't had much softshell crab and found it to be super salty, which may be the norm. It was okay. The scallops were great but there were only two of them, for about $14 or $16! That seemed a bit ridiculous to me. For the entree, I ordered the halibut which came with fava bean risotto and red curry artichoke. The portions are minimal but I was full after eating most of it. The fish was good. My date had the mahi mahi which was quite peppery... he liked it though. For dessert we split the angel food cake topped with fruit and served next to a scoop of chocolate chip ice cream.

For the main course I ordered short ribs (with quinoa and brussel sprouts) and my husband got the tuna.  Both were delicious, but the tuna was really exceptional.  Panko-crusted with some creamy-yet-light rice and drizzled with the most delicious glaze, this dish made me wonder how I could have thought that tuna was fishy.  It was wicked good.  To wrap up the meal we split a hot fudge sundae, which came with house-made banana ice cream and just the right amount of fudge at the bottom.  Perfection. As for the decor and such, I liked that too.  It's modern and on the minimalist side, but the woven chairs on the patio were very comfortable and suitable for a relaxed, multi-course meal.  Prices are on the expensive side, but appropriate given the care that goes into the food.

I was surprised to find out, after the fact, that Sola's cuisine was advertised as Hawaiian - nothing in the menu really screamed ""Hawaii"" in my opinion.  The menu provides a selection of small plates, big plates, salads, raw dishes, and side dishes.  We decided to do a mix, trying a stuffed lambchop special, salad, soft shell crab, tuna, and the truffle parmesan fries.  Nothing that we tried was disappointing, and the fries are a must-try, though we were surprised when they didn't show up until the entrees arrived - they came out in a fairly big serving and it would have been nice to munch on them as we were waiting for our main courses. Our waitress was especially accommodating, going back and forth to the kitchen several times to check on recommendations for the gluten-averse at our table and another nearby table.

The food while delicious couldn't make up for the poor service.  I gave Sola two stars not because I thought the food was awful - but I thought I received some of the worst service at a restaurant ever.  First off, upon arriving, we were seated next to an extremely noisy dinner part of 8 people. It was odd considering that the restaurant was only half full!  Second, our waitress, while friendly and very knowledgeable about the menu, stopped by our table only a few times. We only had two drinks throughout the dinner - we would have had more had she stopped. We would have ordered dessert - but 25 minutes actually passed between when she handed us the dessert menu and returned to take our order. At that point we were worried that the meter had expired at the car, so we opted for the check!  At this point, we were already discussing our general disappointment with the place. I was particularly distressed because I had enjoyed Sola on many other occasions and had talked up the place to friends and family constantly getting them to go there.  The cherry on the cake of our non-dessert was the fact that when I walked to the bathroom, I stepped on something incredibly slippery on the floor near the kitchen and took a topple. The only person who bothered to help me up was a passing bus boy, one wait staff sidestepped around me, and the hostess peaked her head around the hostess stand to see what the commotion was about.  Overall, I vent more because of my disappointment in Sola's service and the fact that it absolutely did not match the food.",-0.9546,0.818,0.063,0.119,0.5196759259259258

I had the salmon which came with an edamame puree that resembled a giant hunk of wasabi. The sauce on the plate was good but there wasn't much of it so the fish was pretty bland too. My husband had the fish special which he liked minus the skin.  We opted to go to DQ for dessert because we knew it would be good and cheap.

The amuse bouche of salmon and avocado on top of a chip definitely amused my tongue. I was in a happy place when I tasted the wagyu burger.

2011-07-03,5.0,"We dined at Sola for the first time a few weeks ago and enjoyed the experience so much we went back this past weekend. Both meals were outstanding. Sola features a fairly extensive menu with a nice array of options - in fact I was a little overwhelmed the first time trying to narrow down what I wanted to order as so many dishes seemed appealing. Our server Carlos was so friendly and helpful; he provided an overview of the menu and everything he recommended turned out to be just to our taste. In addition to outstanding food, Sola also features a long list of unique cocktails and a good beer list to boot (though all bottled beers, not draft). As good as the appetizers and main courses are, be sure to save room for dessert as the desserts are creative and not to be missed. As somebody who grew up in the Boston area, I tend to shy away from fish in most Chicago restaurants, but the Tuna main course is to die for. It was so good my first visit to Sola that I ordered again the second time and it was as good as I remembered. The accompaniments (avocado tempura and a hoisin bamboo rice) were outstanding as well. I hate to say it, but this dish was superior to any fish dish I have tried in the Boston area and will be ordering once again next time I return to Sola. Across both visits we sampled many of the appetizers (soft shell crab, seared scallops, kalua pork, waygu steak tartar and raw oysters); all were amazing but the soft shell crab was my favorite.  Be sure to also order the truffle Parmesan fries; possibly the best French fries I have tasted.  Sola also has a nice ambiance. A fireplace for the wintertime, al fresco seating for those nice Chicago summer evenings, friendly staff, highly competent servers and as an added bonus the chef came and spent some time chatting with us last visit (which was much appreciated).

Okay, so on to the food.  For starters we went with miso black cod and artichoke fritters.  The artichoke fritters were battered in cornmeal and came with both a garlic aioli and a sesame/soy sauce for dipping.  These were delicious.  The cod, though.  Oh, the cod.  I would like to personally thank the person who cooked this piece of fish.  Talk about light and buttery.  My teeth were happy to take the role of bystander as each bite just melted in my mouth.  The accompanying pea shoots, English peas, mushrooms and barley provided a great balance in flavor and texture.  I would go back just to eat this dish again. The entrees varied slightly from the menu posted online, but who could possibly complain about changes due to the use of seasonal, locally-sourced ingredients?  Wagyu hangar steak?  Yes please.  I will be happy to eat you with a sweet purple potato pancake, swiss chard, and roasted elephant garlic.  Oh, and you're cooked perfectly?  Even better!  We ordered this dish to share and, to our pleasant surprise, they split the entree onto two separate plates for us, even cooking the portions of steak individually.   Everything has been good so far, might as well top it off with dessert.  Now, I'm not a huge dessert person, but I love me some good chocolate cake every once in a while.  The soft center chocolate cake was right up my alley.  The accompanying ice cream and wasabi vanilla syrup were so very flavorful.  Being the couth individual that I am, I resisted licking the plate clean. Service was helpful without being overbearing.  Everything was conducted in a very efficient manner.  Plates were removed promptly and water glasses were always filled.  Tables were turned over quickly and all of the patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves and their meals.

Lots of tables, wood finishes and a fireplace near the front that would probably look awesome if lit.  A long bar along the side is the best place to view the lone TV if desired. They have an alright beer list full of local brews.  The cocktail list is tropically themed and poured heavy handedly.  Wine list had a wide selection as well.  The service was attentive with asking how we were and with refills, but they need to be more clear when explaining the specials; a written out list of specials would have helped.  The busing was spectacular and kept our table clean. Given the Hawaiian theme of the place, I ordered the Sea Greens, Wagyu Steak Tartar and the Kalua Pork.  Before the dished came out we had an amuse-buoche, it was a little heavy in gorgonzola or whatever cheese it was, but a nice way to start.  The sea greens really tasted of the ocean, in a good way.  The seaweed was fresh and the macadamia nuts and water chestnuts added some great texture to it all.  The lotus root was a pleasant surprise.  The tartar was not as finely chopped as I thought it'd be but it was probably to accentuate the marbling of the wagyu.  The fried wontons were a bit too salty for the dish and best left to the side. The Kalua pork was shredded and in a sweet bbq sauce, and served atop banana bread.  Overall the dish was very flavorful but could be too sweet for some people.  The fried onion strands were good, but a little too oily. The 5 spice sweet soy brulee i tried for dessert was not my thing; the anise was too strong for me. Overall it's a tastefully designed restaurant with good service and well rounded menu, although lacking in seafood variety. I chose not to try the mid-week pre-fixe special because the theme for the month was plums, but even still, getting 3 appetizer sized dishes for about the same price seemed a better deal.  I would try this place again probably as it was very good overall, even though vaguely Hawaiian to me.",0.9977,0.791,0.195,0.014,0.48713718820861684

Regardless, the food was good. It had the right amount of moisture whereas I wouldn't call it 'dry' or 'chewy food.'  We had some pork and artichoke fritters as our appitizers. I like that they served artichoke fritters, as it is simply too cruel to eat an artichoke's heart. To think they killed a poor innocent baby artichoke for my dining pleasure is simply intolerable. You'd think I wasn't so upset since I've given them 5 stars. Weird?  For the main course, I had a cheeseburger made from ""waygu beef."" It was fitting, because the thing was way gooey, but also delicious. It was a contender for best city burger (not the winner, but a contender- more like a 5th seed in the playoffs).  The dessert was really good too. They had some kind of bannana's foster with chocolate thing that was great. I cannot remember the name because I was getting a bit intoxicated by the time the sweet tray rolled around. I did not fall down or barf on my exit from the premises, so that is another positive.",0.9935,0.744,0.212,0.044,0.5596236171236171

We coordinated a set menu with the following: Starters: Fruit Malasadas (so yummy!) Entrees: (Guest picked one from the following) Ham & Cheese French Toast Miso Cod Green City Market Omelet Huevos Benedictos Sides: Bacon & Sausage Dessert: Delicious birthday cake - yellow with buttercream frosting (everyone kept asking where I got it from!) Most people ended up getting the Green City Market Omelet which was so great (fresh veggies and goat cheese), but the people who ordered the cod, Huevos Benedictos and the ham & cheese French Toast were raving too.  I will admit, deciding what to order was the hardest thing about the entire brunch because it is all so good.  I requested that the guest be given a glass of Cava upon arrival and to replenish as needed.  The staff was fantastic about that too. I can't say enough about how wonderful the food, service and atmosphere were.  The entire sola team is so helpful and nice.  Most importantly, all of my guests had a fantastic time!  Thank you for an amazing celebration!",0.9962,0.755,0.245,0.0,0.6050595238095237
2011-05-16,3.0,"The hubby and I tried Sola for the first time last Friday night. We had bought the groupon and finally got around to trying it. I have to say, it was not all that I had expected. The second I walked in, I was hit by the extremely strong smell of fish. Don't get me wrong, I like fish. But your restaurant shouldn't be over-powered by the smell. We decided to order a bunch of the small plates, so we can try more than just one dish. Here's what we ordered and a short assessment of each. 1. Kalua pork This tasted like tender pulled pork on some bread. It was good, but not great. 2. Artichoke fritters Does it make sense to say this tasted a little too deep fried? The fried coating was really thick and the dipping sauces they brought out with it didn't add much to the dish. 3. Seared scallops These were cooked perfectly and were exactly the right consistency. Their taste was amazing. 4. Gnocchi These or the scallops were my favorite. The gnocchi just melted in your mouth with each bite, and the veggies served with it complemented the dish wonderfully.  5. Truffle parmesean fries As we ordered everything at once, and our server said he'd stagger the plates, I was surprised that the fries came out with the last batch of food. They would have been good to have at the beginning, to eat throughout the meal. They were tasty, but not amazing. 6. Adzuki bean cake We tried this unusual dessert. Bean paste is such an unusual texture and has a really interesting taste. The dessert was pretty good. We each also had a cocktail that seemed overpriced. I had a pear-ginger mixed drink that was about $10 and I believe my husband's was about $11. Stick to the wine, I guess. The plates were on the small side, so thought it seems like we ordered a lot of food, we really didn't. I felt full, but not stuffed with what we ordered. Just don't expect a lot of food if you order a small plate. For example, the seared scallop dish came with only 2 scallops. I did find that the service itself was great. Our waters were constantly filled, our plates were taken away soon after we finished the food on them, and our server was always nearby if we needed something. Overall, I don't think I'd go back for dinner. I did read some great reviews about brunch, so I may have to try that, but save your money on an overpriced dinner and go somewhere else.",0.9934,0.841,0.13,0.028,0.570016611295681

I love the food.  It was all very fresh, nicely seasoned and just delicious.  When we go, we like to get plates and share them.  This way you can try a little bit of everything.  The portions are very nice and they can make anything entree size if you are with a crowd of non-sharing/small plate people.   You must get the truffle parmesan fries.  Sound so basic, but are SO delicious.  I also really quite enjoy the seared scallops and the raw tuna for light appetizers.  Both taste so fresh such that they were just caught from the ocean.  For entrees, the wagyu hanger steak was absolutely cooked to perfection!  We also tried a seasonal lambchop dish which was cooked good although it was stuffed with blue cheese (a negative in my book on personal taste only).  The pork is also very nice.  I find the dessert menu lacking to my taste, but thankfully they have a chocolate cake that is delicious.  It is good, but nothing that separates it from every other chocolate cake.  One down side is that the kitchen can close early (10-10:30).  This is key if you are meeting for a late dinner.  Yet, you can hang out and have your drinks after that.  Now that we know that, we probably wouldn't want a dinner later than 8-8:30 to give yourself plenty of time to savor the food and pick new things out.   Overall - a hit!

Honestly I expected the meat to be slightly more tender, but that's because I'm used to short ribs that have been used as a base in a red pasta sauce. Absolutely delicious with a bit of pesto on top, and not drowned in hollandaise. I love benedicts so much, but i hate when there's 2 cups of sauce poured all over it. This was perfect.

The balance of flavors was perfect on everything that my date and I ate, from appetizers all through to desserts. My only criticisms are few: The portions could be larger for the entree sized plates, as they do not seem to reflect the prices. I paid $30 for what looked like 4-6oz of hangar steak, the cheapest cut of steak! The cocktails could be improved, as I feel like they do not match the flavors or level of skill of the food. The big screen tv by the bar is somewhat distracting and confusing.

We shared a wagyu beef tartar and truffle oil Parmesan fries for appetizers. My boyfriend ordered the hanger steak while I got the soup of the day (miso fennel with duck confit) and the prawn appetizers. The food was amazing. I especially loved the soup, which was creamy but not overly heavy. I also loooved the flatbread (made with rosemary, black pepper, and fennel) that came with the bread, and the waitress was so kind to pack us an extra box to take home. For dessert, we had the chocolate fudge sundae that the waitress highly recommended. I loved the homemade banana ice cream, although I felt like the flavors of the chocolate fudge overpowered the more subtle banana flavors -- nonetheless it was quite enjoyable. My ooonnly complaint is that there was not that much of a discrepancy between the size of an appetizer and an entree.

But again, it wasn't exactly cooked to perfection. I will say, though, that the truffle parmesan fries were perfection. Plentiful in quantity and quality, these skin-on fries were stuffed into a pint glass and sprinkled [very generously] with parmesan and truffles. Yummers.

As I write this review, I realize that that means their menu hasn't changed at all in the past nine months. That isn't the sort of philosophy a restaurant should be following unless that restaurant is Applebee's. In Sola's defense, many of those brunch options are quite tasty. In the past, I have enjoyed the French toast sandwich (which I would call a Monte Cristo, but perhaps they are ardent anti-Bonapartists) and the pork hash. This trip, Daniel and I ended up ordering two dishes we had experienced before -- the short rib Benedict and the horrifically-titled huevos benedictos. Out overly-polite server (whom D and I have also had before) brought the plates out -- well, three of them; the cornbread cornbed of my benedictos needed to be turned down, it seems -- and immediately, once it arrived, Michelle and I noticed that our poached eggs were practically hard-boiled. This is something that happens at least once in every 10 poached eggs that are plopped on my plate; it's always annoying (since the chef who created the dish intended the yolk to serve as a sauce, not a spread) and I am also always too hungry/lazy/polite to say anything. Michelle, however, possesses a bolder soul than me; she asked for new eggs. After an uncomfortably long time, she did receive perfectly juicy eggs, but we had already polished most of our food off by then (and then, oh, I was rude and made her talk as she tried to finish her meal). The benedictos was quite good. The corn bread is a lovely addition to the growing number of permutations that barely can call themselves Benedicts. The potatoes that accompanied it resembled sliced onions and were dry and flavorless. I would guess this was owing to our later arrival time in the brunch schedule, and I certainly managed to choke a few forkfuls down (despite the fact that, after the cornbread, did I really need MORE carbs?), but I'd like to see improvements here. The short-rib Benedict offered a good combination of flavors and textures; the peppery punch in the pesto complemented the typically mild-flavored short ribs, and the hollandaise was good if not standard. I've heard murmurs about Sola possibly, possibly not reformatting their concept. I would recommend changing up their dinner offerings -- they are too unpleasant and expensive to even waste my time on a review of them, sadly. But brunch? I'd recommend holding on to some of their best-sellers and experimenting -- finally -- with a few new plates.",0.9828,0.829,0.117,0.054,0.47095332204027857

I must admit I was a bit skeptical about the restaurant because asian and hawaii fusion seemed out of this world however it was amazing! The potstickers with mango salsa was great! The hamachi and salmon poke was to die for especially you lovee the taste of wasabi. The ribs are so tender it literally melts in your mouth. The mac and cheese was made just right and the truffle paramesan fries literally has you eating non stop!  I was was really satisfied with the service, very attentive but not overbearing. to close out the night the bean cake def, was an orgasm to the mouth. mmm loved this place!",0.9262,0.836,0.126,0.038,0.7259740259740259

I usually don't have such a hard time narrowing down menu choices, but I couldn't decide among FIVE dishes, folks. That's really saying something. After the meal, I am certain that the indecisiveness was justified. The hubs and I shared the artichoke fritters, soup of the day (crab/apple soup), the burger, and the pork entree. Everything was absolutely FANTASTIC. The blend of flavors were innovative and mind-blowing. Finally, it felt like I was a judge on Top Chef! The service was excellent. Water was constantly filled. What I appreciated the most was the hostess calling me two days prior to the reservation to kindly inform me that the entrance is actually on Byron St. and not Lincoln Ave. as posted. Very thoughtful and appreciated. Entrees run about $30/each, and the portions are perfect (no slathering butter on the doorways to squeeze yourself out!).

2011-02-05,4.0,"Sola is a great spot to dine for any occasion. I have had personal and business meet ups here. The ambiance (upscale yet comfortable and casual) and excellent service provide the perfect environment for conversation and then you add in the delicious food and perfection. I am particularly fond of having brunch here and most recently enjoyed the huevos benedictos without the chorizo. The foundation of cornbread caught my eye. The portions are huge so bring your appetite. It seems like the portions have grown since they first opened years back. And the menu has shifted (still excellent) from kind of hawaiian-esque fare to more spanish influenced comfort food. The dessert menu still reminds me of when Sola first opened.

2011-01-11,5.0,"Sometimes you dine at a place and before you waddle out the door, already start making plans to return (headed back on Monday!). A few of my examples: Takashi on Sunday nights, Table 52, Girl and the Goat. I would like to extend a welcome to Sola for joining that list!  I had heard somewhere that New Year's Eve was going to be Sola's last night, so in December, we came and dined. The room is so relaxing and warm -- browns everywhere, pretty lighting fixtures -- I always feel so warm and fuzzy (can rooms give hugs? I think so) and therefore, happy (!) when I am in a beautifully decorated place.  Anyway, more importantly: food! Artichoke hearts? Definitely on my list of vegetables that I really really like. Fritter?! A word that I always have problems pronouncing but who said that ordered fried food should be easy for me? By the way, artichoke fritter totally trumps calling ""deep fried artichoke heart"". Fritter fritter fritter! The french onion soup had BACON FAT in it. I love when people describe food to me, even more so when they use the words ""bacon fat"". Also thrown into the mix was the word ""pineapple"". Interesting... and much appreciated when it helped cut the richness and fat of the dish. Genius! The dish that I would return for (and eat over and over again) is the duck entree. The breast is PERFECT. Crispy duck skin on the outside and a beautiful pink on the inside. Crispy kale, kumquats, gnocchi and parsnip puree share the attention. This plate is a flavor and texture wonderland.  I also really enjoyed the pork trio dish... more like quartet as it was served with BACON BREAD PUDDING. Awesomesauce! However, the winner of the evening (on top of all this?! It can be done!) was the dessert: an adzuki bean cake with kabocha squash and sweet miso ice cream. I have deemed this the best dessert I have eaten in 2010 (and yes, I've had the Bristol's house-made nutter butters). Seriously, it is about time that bean desserts start popping up on menus. Ask any Chinese bakery fanatic: bean paste rocks. It is sweet and brings this earthy quality to desserts that cannot be recreated with chocolate or fruit. Whoever came up with this dessert is brilliant. And next time, I'm ordering one per person.  Fortunately, Sola is going to remain open until April. I think Carol Wollack is going to open another restaurant in River North. I hope (hope hope!) that Sola remains open forever, so I can go eat adzuki bean cake every month.

The pork with the bacon bread pudding is amazing, and the scallops with truffle vinaigrette are fantastic as well! Thursdays are Burger, Beer, and Bacon days - the delicious burger comes on a pretzel roll and comes with a side of parmesan truffle fries. Even if you don't get the burger, try the fries - they're ridiculous! Sola is moving closer to the loop in 2011, but its current location will become a new restaurant with a new, casual, neighborhood-friendly menu, still under the guidance of Chef Wallack.

I'm usually too hungover to make it this far west, but when I get someone else to drive, I am never disappointed. If they have shrimp, the wasabi bloody mary is a must. For dining excellence, you absolutely have to try: 1) The Doughnuts 2) The Short Rib Benedict 3) The Chocolate chip banana and bacon pancakes with nutella.  That is certainly not something I'd ever dream of ordering, but I did it on a solid recommendation and I couldn't have been happier. Service is always interesting. It's good, or good things happen. One time a server spilled a glass of water on a Friend Zoner's iphone  while trying to jam a plate in an inadequately open space. He was a little impatient but it was ok. But the bill ended up being half off, and it was her phone, not mine, so I was happy as a clam.  Top honors for Sola.

The wine list was pretty extensive and a bit pricey.  The lack of draft beer (even with a full bar) was slightly mitigated by their solid selection of craft bottles.  If you prefer beer anyways, definitely get a few beers and you'll same some coin in the end.  The hoppy Sierra Nevada pale ale went very well with our dishes.",0.9953,0.733,0.24,0.028,0.5506565656565658

2011-01-04,4.0,"Hate to take a star away, but the truth is that this is a 5-star brunch place and a 3 to 3.5-star dinner place. For starters, the dinner prices are wayyyy too high for the area and for the quality in my opinion. Entrees are in the $25-$30 range. Should probably knock those prices down by $5-$10. The starters were good. Interesting pot stickers and nice onion soup. The pork entree was tasty, though I am still weirded out when they suggest that I eat pork medium rare. I asked for medium and wished I had asked for medium well. The best pieces were the non-loin pieces that were well cooked. Now to the big disappointment...the tuna dish was somewhere between mediocre and bad. They serves us two large pieces of tuna, but it was really fatty and not well prepared in my opinion. The edges had a fried crust which was also not to my liking. My big problem though was with the quality of the fish. For $29 I expect to be served a really nice piece of tuna, and as I said, it was really below average. The wines by the glass are also very expensive ranging from $10-$15. I am not a wine connoisseur, but the first $12 glass of wine was awful. Tasted like the bottle had been left open for a few days. The server was nice and changed it right away. The second glass I got was a different brand of Pinot Noir. It was better, but still not great. I took a  restaurant.com  coupon and my dinner still came out to almost $100. This is a really nice space and the service is good, but given the prices, the overall experience really didn't quite deliver.

They gave us an amuse-bouche of a fried wonton, goat cheese, and i think ginger?  It was really light and the ginger (or whatever it was) cut through the saltiness of the cheese to leave a really fresh, clean taste in your mouth. Yum! Tried the pork belly (I think it was an appetizer) as my main course - it literally melts in your mouth.  It's fatty and porky.  I loved it!  The bed of spinach (i think) and the small cubed potatoes and toast really went well together.   Ordered a side of macaroni and cheese and it was decadent and delicious.  A little creamier than I would like, but the texture was perfect. The husband got their special for the night - potato prix fixe menu with the wine pairings.  5-spice potato gnocchi: delicious.  Wagyu sirloin: cooked medium rare and also delicious.  Comes with fries which are good, but nothing special.  Macadamia/date cake dessert with potato ice cream?!  AMAZING.  It tastes a little bit like dried fig newtons and the potato ice cream is weird and delicious all in one. The alcohol is nice and strong - definitely recommend a cocktail with dinner!  Server is super friendly and prompt.

A gathering of some of my chicas & I came upon Sola on a very lovely Saturday morning...we were ready for some good chow & some even better company (hello, we were celebrating me :-).   I was immediately struck by the ambiance as we entered through the doors...Sola has an understated elegance.  It is fancy without making you feel uncomfortable. I absolutely love the lighting & the warm colors. Of course we started with coffee which is brewed nicely & not at all weak...truth is some of these fancy schmancy places do good food, but their coffee can be blah (not the case here).  Then since we were a slightly indecisive group...we started with the donuts (2 orders of them), they were highly recommended by our server and good gracious he did not steer us wrong.  I am not a fan of donuts, but these sort of knocked my socks off...they were light & airy, sprinkled with sugar, and came with dipping sauce (oh the dipping sauces...I wanted to drink them).  Everyone raved about them & it was a great way to start what was an excellent brunch. Now as others have mentioned, the brunch menu is not extensive, but it is still rather difficult to decide what to eat.  Everything (and I mean EVERYTHING) just sounds so damn good.  Then there is the battle of sweet or savory...this time savory won out & I ordered the chilaquiles (which is rather a fun word to say by the by)...tortilla hash, eggs, pico de gallo, guacamole, sour cream.  This came is a rather attractive presentation & was devoured immediately...it was very tasty.  In what can be considered a miracle when you have a gathering of 8...each of us ordered something different (yay)...so taste testing was abounding.  So, I got to taste multiple dishes & can say that I will be back as everything tasted wonderful.    I definitely want to go back & get the breakfast wrap sometime....so good.

I ordered a stout from Dogfish Head...mmm really good for dark beer lovers.  What is just ORDINARY: We ordered the Carrot Prix Fixe meal, which consisted of a three course meal for 30 bucks. Seemed like a good deal at that time since their regular entrees go for $28+ anyways.  1st course was Spiced Carrot and Pumpkin soup - tasted like a regular squash soup i could make at home. Nothing outstanding. 2nd course was a Pork Tenderloin with grilled baby carrots, bacon, a small side of potatoes and spinach. Honestly, the portions are very small and while the presentation was delightful, the flavor in the entree wasn't standout and only a couple of bites in the center of the meat  were tender and juicy.  3rd course was a carrot pecan pie - I ate only half of it cuz it tasted like processed desserts i could buy at Dominicks.",0.9958,0.743,0.251,0.006,0.5310081585081584

Don't let the clever food descriptions and different ingredients scare you if you're not an experimental foodie. I'm not hugely experimental (Rabbit? Leave it in the forest, please), but I love to eat. You can safely enjoy a meal at Sola without having to ingest something that might make you squirm. We started our evening with a Wicked Wahini cocktail, which was different and tasty. And if I'd had more than 2, I would have needed a stretcher to carry me home. Instead I opted for the Prix Fixe for $30, which had the October theme of apples. Every bite was delicious. The only thing I didn't like was that my food started to pile up while I savored my courses. I am ok with waiting a minute between courses rather than feeling like I have to rush so something doesn't get cold. The atmosphere was pleasant. Not too quiet, but intimate enough to enjoy a private conversation. There was a large table of ladies (10+ cougars) that arrived mid-way through our meal and even their gossiping didn't cause us to have to raise our voices.

I used to know a chef that was part of the opening team in Sola so I went a few times in 2006 and always enjoyed the food, service and atmosphere. I met Carol a few times and she was always pleasant and clearly had a huge interest and pride in her new and shiny restaurant. I was served once by Dale Levitski and I really thought this was a great restaurant. Fast forward 4 years and I brought my parents and fiancee for dinner in Sola on a cold and wet Saturday. We were seated in their raised area near the window and it was very cold. So much so everybody at my table put their coats back on. I mentioned it to our server (as we were right underneath the air con) and his answer was ""well I'm ok"" and started giggling. I was shocked by his answer and attitude but didn't make more of a deal of it as my parents had driven 7 hours to be with me that day and didn't want to cause a fuss. Server got 0 stars but the bussers were great and were always fussing around the table. To start I had the Potstickers which were ok. I've had much better in Chinatown. The others at my table had the French Onion soup which was tasty but there was too much bread in the dish so the great beefy broth was soaked up entirely by the bread. My father and I had the scallops which were average and I expected them to be better (we had brunch at NOMI the next day and their scallops were so much better), especially as I had been saying for so long how well they cook fish at Sola. My mothers Halibut was undercooked and not at the level I have come to expect from Carols team. The Tuna was very good and the best dish of the evening. I would have stayed for dessert but it was way too cold so we moved onto Le Colonial. Just before we left I saw Carol helping to bring out the main courses for a large table of 12 that was seated right next to us.

Although my salmon wasn't cooked to my taste when I first got my plate, I was able to send it back and get it cooked right to where I like it. The edamame puree was to die for.

The Brunch was amazing.    My visit to Sola gave me a major case of Deja vu. It took me a good hour to figure out that Sola is located in the same storefront that used to be a Bargain Town Toy store that I went to as a kid. The Deja Vu aside, the interior was what you would expect from a restaurant in Lakeview. It was Artsy and almost tacky. But like I always say, it's all about the food.   The Brunch menu was impressive. I saw at least three things that I wanted to order. I settled on the huevos benedictos. The Dish consisted of a Poached egg, Chorizo and hash browns that were covered in their on special Hollandaise sauce. The Dish was delicious and was almost more food than this Hockey watching Neanderthal could handle. It was a hearty dish that left me with a full tummy and a smile on my face.   The bottom line on Sola is a lesson of how looks can be deceiving. This Artsy, yuppie filled Fu Fu joint served up a man sized, heaping helping of artery clogging goodness.

I had heard about Sola and the amazing brunch offered but I had never been.  Normally I would be nervous taking people to an ""untested"" place, but the reviews from others that had been put me at ease.  We started out with what I was told was the house specialty, the Masaladas.  Masaladas are Portuguese fried donuts, which look like a larger version of a donut hole. They came four  to a plate and were accompanied by a raspberry sauce and a chocolate sauce.  Simply divine! You must order these if you come here. Then, as others have mentioned, narrowing down the choices on this relatively small menu is shockingly difficult.  Just when you think you know what you want you see two other things that look better.  I had decided, and then as a joke said the only way you would be able to make a quick decision is to close your eyes and point.  Which I then did and looked to see what it was.  And I immediately changed my mind because what I landed on was a wild mushroom and goat cheese omelet (how did I miss this!!).  Nicely balanced with big chunks of mushrooms and a layer of creamy goat cheese.  A fan!  Other dishes, such as the chilaquiles, the green city market omelet, and the huevos benedictos were beautifully presented and looked fantastically yum. One minor thing I should mention is pay attention to the coffee refillers.  Although they were very efficient and consistently went around to attend to your cup,  at one point we noticed that we were being given decaf (i think the regular was out and he was just filling the cups with what he had left).  When we said we didn't want that the cups were all immediately replaced with new, but since so few people drink decaf it definitely seemed odd that they would give you that in the first place without asking.   Anyway, the moral of this story is, go, close your eyes, point and order.  You will not be disappointed!",0.9908,0.826,0.137,0.037,0.46472223063132156

It I got my eggs cooked over-medium and it worked out perfect. The dish has some spice to it, but the cold guac and sour cream cooled it right off. My brother had the short rib benedict which was poached eggs, cheddar biscuits, pesto, hollandaise. This was truly delicious the tender beef and cheddar biscuits melted in your mouth.  Our service was great! The server suggested these freshly baked Swedish donuts with a raspberry and chocolate dipping sauce. Before we even had a chance to finish those up, our food was being delivered hot to your table. The server refilled out coffee, water, and picked up all our plates.  Also tried the maui-mosa- champagne, pineapple & passionfruit juice. It was good, but not worth $9. Next time just stick to the coffee! I learned about this place on yelp earlier that morning!

2010-09-01,3.0,"I'm giving sola 3 stars mainly because of the sneaking suspicion that I've become a food snob.. but really, it was nothing special. Went to sola last friday for their ""foodie fridays"" promotion with my boyfriend and our friend; I was the only non-vegetarian. Instead of ordering entrees, we each ordered 2 appetizers to try out the food. The artichoke fritters came with soy-lime & white truffle-honey sauces, which, while I love truffle, really didn't go with the artichokes. The artichokes themselves were sour, fried, and not very special--Home Bistro makes MUCH better artichoke fritters with an amazing roasted garlic aioli. So, I've had better. The soup of the day was a chilled corn soup with crab, which was not bad but would have been better hot. The grilled asparagus was just that. Nothing special, especially at $8. We then waited something like 30-40 minutes for our next dishes. I also had the squash blossoms with pork belly and kimchi. The squash blossoms were sour (pickled) which was too much considering the kimchi was already sour enough. Overall, I was pretty disappointed with the dish. I only ordered it because it sounded exotic and I was trying to be adventurous, and the squash, which was supposed to be the highlight of the dish, pretty much killed it. The truffle parmesan fries didn't come out until 2/3 of the way through the meal, which was way too late. The fries were my #1 reason for wanting to try sola, and I was pretty disappointed. I really didn't taste much truffle and they came out at a random time in the evening. Rockit's truffle fries are much better. The greens and grains was pretty good, although I forget the exact details. I love the whole IDEA of local food and everything, but considering how many things were pickled and how lackluster most of the food was, I don't think I'll ever go back.",0.9946,0.742,0.193,0.065,0.489564336372847

I went during ""foodie Fridays"" when they offered 25% off every Friday in August. Maybe they couldn't handle the crowd. The food was ok. The amuse buche was a highlight. Our squash blossom appetizer was greasy, but the flavors were good.  The main dishes were just ok -- deliciously prepared meats, but the rest of the plate was lacking. The parmesan truffle fries came out halfway through the meal and were a half-cooked, soggy disaster. I sent fries back for the first time in my life. Any supposed Hawaiian influence was certainly in hiding this month. What really tipped the scales was the poor service. Our waiter would disappear for 20 minutes at a time. He gave recommendations when we sat down, then contradicted himself a few minutes later. I wasn't sure that he even knew what the meals were. All in all, it was just ok.

I ordered the Short Rib Benedict, which I knew I was going to get once I looked at the menu online.  The hubs ordered the Chocolate Chip, Banana, & Bacon pancakes and my parents both got the special Salmon Benedict.  The food was delicious.  My short ribs were a little cold and I only got one egg.  Well, one egg with yolk and one egg white.  The poached egg was perfect.  The yolk ran when I broke the egg.  The cheddar biscuits were a nice surprise and worked really well with the short ribs, egg and hollandaise sauce.  I could definitely have used more of that sauce though.  The potatoes were good but the benedict was filling.  Everyone enjoyed their meal and we definitely agreed to come back for the dinner menu.   This was a great brunch spot and I'm ready to try everything else on the menu.  Go here.  Fast.  I promise you won't be disappointed!!",0.9967,0.718,0.255,0.027,0.5665029761904763
2010-08-14,5.0,"My husband and I recently hosted a large group (20 people) on a Friday night at Sola. This was not our first visit to Sola. My husband and I are date night regulars. But their flawless attention to our group brought my respect for Sola to a whole new level. First, Sola accommodated our request to seat us all together at one table in the main dining room, but we were discretely located on one side so our toasts did not disturb the other guests. The set-up was perfect. Second, the service was outstanding, which is no small feat for a group our size. Our server was highly attentive, tracking a diverse array of cocktail orders without error. Our water glasses were regularly filled, and our dinner promptly served. Most importantly, the wait staff was friendly and really helpful. Third, our meal was totally decedent. The appetizer menu is so tempting that we opted to pass our plates around family style so we could each sample each other's selections which included everything from artichoke fritters (yum yum!) to a tuna poke to a summer watermelon salad. Popular entrees among our group included a lamb chop special, ginger glazed salmon, and sliced duck breast, complimented by generously proportioned side orders of truffle parmesan fries and mac 'n cheese. Although we were pretty stuffed by the time we finished our entrees, we could not resist sampling a few deserts including the warm center chocolate cake and the mai'a hot fudge sundae. Before writing this review, I took a few minutes to see what other people had to say on Yelp about their experiences at Sola. Many reviews are about their brunch.

All dishes were good portion sizes and cooked to our request (i.e. scrambled eggs instead of fried eggs).  My favorite dish out of all of them was the kalua pork hash - the shredded pork was tender and so good w/ the fresh guac.  Next was the eggs benedict cuz of their homemade canadian bacon and last was the pancakes.  Just b/c the pancakes were in last place doesn't mean that you shouldn't try it.  You don't taste too much of the bacon cuz it's not spread all over but it was still a nice flavor combination. Then we ended the shower on malasadas (portuguese style donuts, chocolate sauce & raspberry coulis).  These reminded me of beignets and were so good w/ the raspberry coulis.  The chocolate didn't has as much as an effect on me like the coulis did.

2010-06-27,3.0,"Don't be mistaken by the 3 stars.  The food was excellent, but.....since when did it become popular to serve entrees the same size or smaller than appetizers? Nouvelle cuisine to me is and always has been nothing more than appetizers, except there is not enough to share - I ordered the Halibut - it was outstanding, but I was still hungry when we left. The appetizers were excellent, but again, we were all still hungry when we left because who is kidding who - especially in FAT America. When you wait until 8:00 to eat dinner, you are HUNGRY!.  The service was good, but....the waiter didn't know that the cloth napkin used for the Champagne serves 2 purposes - 1) To uncork the bottle and prevent the cork from flying in the air or someones face, and 2) TO WRAP the bottle when you are POURING so the $180 Champagne so it ends up in THE GLASSES and not the table or someone lap. Plus it prevents the WATER FROM THE MELTING ICE IN THE BUCKET FROM DRIPPING ALL OVER THE GROCERY BAG PAPER ON THE TABLE!  He was in intelligent waiter who knew the menu well, but didn't have the common sense to take the hint and BRING THE F'ING BREAD basket NOW after I mentioned to him twice that none of us had eaten since Noon. I had to ask another waiter to bring us some bread while waiting for him 10 minutes to bring a bottle of Chanpagne from the back of the restauarnt, although it seemed like he flew to FRANCE to get it -  He was also not about to take my courteous suggestion when I told him on the side about the napkin for the Champagne because when the 2nd bottle came, he poured it the exact same sloppy manner he did for the first bottle. I personally would have rather skipped the Champagne and order another entree but I was not the only person at the table so I decided to STFU.  One of the guests ordered an 8 oz special prime steak - what came out were 2 very small slices of steak on a small bed of grilled vegetable's, if we were coming for Tapa's, then I get it, but this was supposed to be an ENTREE not an appetizer.  The Decor was very nice, but what is up with the brown grocery bag paper over a linen tablecloth? Why bother having a nice table cloth on a table if all you are going to do is cover it up with cheap, ugly brown grocery store paper that gets WET FROM THE SWEATING WATER, WINE AND CHAMPAGNE GLASSES???  The clientele was typical to that of any gentrified area - lots of young, well do to, good looking professionals - or those who portray that image, and then you had those who were trying to hard to look young, but were either very well off and in their Golden years, or leveraged so far that there is no return so who gives a flyin' F - in any case, the cars were incredible and one of the girls at our table was going nuts over all the women's shoes - that I will never understand, but I rarely get to see A BMW Alpina so for me that was pretty impressive - even more so than A Porsche because those are too common.  The manager was incredible - when the guest asked very nicely if this was supposed to be an 8 oz. portion, she had the chef cook up more meat and served it to him personally - plus, she took it OFF the bill and gave us a free desert, even though we were all going to order some to share anyway. Now THAT is an outstanding manager who KNOWS WHAT CUSTOMER SERVICE is all about. If I owned a restaurant I WOULD WANT HER ON MY STAFF!!  So, if you are looking for an excellent dinner that is a bit pricey that may or may not leave you feeling hungry afterwards? You will probably enjoy it very much. I personally believe that QUANTITY does NOT constitute QUALITY, but if I am going to pay a good buck for dinner, then you had leave me satisfied - I don't care how good it is.  I would rate their food a 9 but unfortunately, it left me more hungry than BOKA on Halsted, which was a total rip off, but that review is coming later.  All in all, it was excellent,  expensive,  and forced me to get  a slice of Pizza before we finally went home.",0.9984,0.809,0.152,0.039,0.6048681318681319

Sola had a very nice decor about it.. felt very natural with the taupes, coffees, and beige colors. We were seated right away near the windows and not outside because I didn't want to sweat through dinner. The outside seating area is right in front of the restaurant. Marnie was our server and she was impressive. She chatted us up and gave us full details on anything on the menu. She has a very calming voice, which sort of made me enjoy dinner more. Dan had water but I decided to enjoy my day with a nice White Bordeaux. mmmm so satisfying and I don't like white wines! The bread basket came by and you know how I love the bread.. I dug right in. They had crackers and 3 different kinds of rolls, which were warm and so delicious. We wanted to start out with an appetizer and after Marnie answered our questions between a few different fish options.. we went with the Tuna Poke.. which was AMAZING. So fresh and had bursts of flavors. YUMMY! We ordered an order of Truffle fries with our meal instead of a starter and OMG.. the Parmesan, the flavors.. mm mm Fries!  For dinner I went with the Fish (I can't remember the spelling) and Dan went with the Pork! Dan had 3 different types of Pork on his plate and Bacon bread pudding.

2010-06-17,4.0,"The flavor profiles are right up my alley.  The location is also fairly convenient for me.  I want to love this place, but execution in the kitchen can be slightly off. Let me begin with the tuna poke.  It's an appetizer I must get every time I eat here.  The ingredients meld together flawlessly.  They should never, ever stop serving it.  They used to serve a sea greens salad that was phenomenal, but it's no longer on the menu.  I pray they don't do that with the poke.  Since my must have dish is an appetizer, I still get to sample a good portion of the entrees. Bread service features a boring multi-grain, excellent peppery flatbread and a fantastic pretzel roll.  The pretzel roll is featured on the burger, which comes with a simple yet tasty asian slaw. I recently had the short ribs, which were extremely salty.  I could have done without the hoisin and soy.  A reduction of the braising liquid would have been fine with me.  To counter the saltiness, the dish came with citrus sections that were WAY too tart (I don't know the name of the fruit, but it was the size of a persimmon and the taste of a very intense white grapefruit).  As I mentioned earlier, slightly off. Desserts are utterly forgettable.  I would like them to completely revamp the dessert menu.  At best, it's boring. The room is laid out very nicely, with tables comfortably apart.  Service is efficient, but can be a bit hovering at times.  The pricing is a little high, especially for the neighborhood.  They do offer a prix-fixe that is a good deal, and it's usually themed.  Plenty of street parking is available.  They offer valet, but it's not really necessary. I enjoy eating here, but I often leave with the feeling that my meal was good, but could have been exceptional with a little tweak here and there.  The poke is proof that the kitchen is capable of producing outstanding dishes.  I wish that level of excellence was more prevalent than it is.",0.9968,0.757,0.208,0.036,0.5961265969802556

2010-06-14,4.0,"Went here for brunch yesterday with my favorite female dining partner in crime before we hit up some vintage clothing stores. We had originally planned on going to M Henry, but decided that with the Midsommar Fest it would be more of a zoo there than usual, and instead chose to go to Sola based on all the great reviews. I hadn't thought to make a reservation and it was hopping at 12:45, including two big parties, one replete with the dreaded diaper cake. The host managed to scare up a table, thankfully, far away from the ensuing ooohing and ahhhing of the baby shower. PIC arrived shortly thereafter and the waitress greeted us. She had a very sing-song -y Irish accent and she was more perky than anyone should be on a Sunday morning (okay, technically it was afternoon, but still). She gave us menus and asked if we wanted some donuts to start while we looked over the menu. In a flash, we both looked at each other and read each other's minds. You bet your ass we wanted those donuts. To that, we also ordered mimosas - a Red Dawn for me and a Palmango for Keri.  I love blood orange juice and this was a delicious twist on a classic mimosa. The donuts, actually called ""malasadas,"" were placed down in front of us. There were four of these little beauties and also small pitchers of raspberry coulis and chocolate sauces for dunkin'. I am always a fan of breakfast/brunch appetizers, especially sweet ones, (I'm specifically talking about the breakfast bread pudding at m henry :::swoons:::) so these more than hit the spot and the sauces were spectacular. For our main courses, I ordered a wild mushroom, asparagus and goat cheese omelette and she ordered the huevos benedictos - a spin on classic eggs benedict. The food arrived and we dug in. On the side were hash browns which neither of us cared for. They were shredded but not at all crunchy.  They were just big chunks of steamed potatoes with no texture at all. That is a big fail in my book. My omelette was good, but it was cooked a bit longer than I like and was more like a frittata than an omelette. Keri liked, but didn't love her dish, which admittedly had a lot going on. Sweet cornbread, a ton of crumbled chorizo and some heat from the salsa, which she thought didn't necessarily play well off of each other. The service was cheerful and friendly, almost too friendly, but she was knowledgeable and efficient, so I can't complain. I'd say Sola is a solid 3.5 stars for brunch, but I look forward to returning for dinner and updating my review.",0.9956,0.772,0.167,0.062,0.47660493827160494

A few months ago we sat inside to eat and the waitress told us about a special soup that included crabmeat. When I told her it sounded great but I was allergic to shellfish, she said she was also allergic and lo and behold they had made a version without crabmeat! What luck! She then proceeded to give me the version WITH crabmeat and didnt realize it until I had had about 5-6 bites and noticed it myself. So what did they do to make up for the fact that my life was threatened with a mistake?? Comp the whole meal? Nope. Comp my meal? Nope. Comp my entree?? Nope. They offered a free desert which we didnt even want. THANKS! Listen, the food as Sola is good. But it isn't great and you could debate the high prices - maybe worth it, maybe not. But never has the service been *great* and twice the service had been insulting. We will not be back. Seems like Sola wants to be social by linking their site to their facebook page but then doesnt even have the name or email address of the manager on their site. Another company that doesnt understand social media. If that manager wants to call me my number is 773-732-1717 Chris",0.8559,0.825,0.095,0.079,0.3268962585034013

2010-03-08,3.0,"Sunday morning.  A man and woman, uninspired and hungry, decide it is time to take advantage of their recently purchased A La Card deck and try somewhere new for brunch.  A spin through the deck and a quick peek at a brunch menu online sends them journeying off to Sola as a gentle rain begins to fall. Okay, enough of that.  We did the Sunday brunch at Sola and I was impressed.  I'll get the bad out of the way quickly.  I'm a stickler for having something to drink available at all times.  I'll forgive a lot of things much more readily.  Slow pacing, waiter forgets a dish, an underwhelming entree...these things happen in our imperfect and flawed world.  But if I'm eating a meal, and my glasses, both soda and water are empty for a double digit span of time, that just burns my biscuits.  I understand our waiter was quite slammed with the arrival of a very large party, so I don't mind the lack of refill on my drink.  But the fact that I had my water refilled just before the entree arrived, and didn't see another pitcher near my table until I was ready to have my plate cleared away seemed a bit much. With that out of the way, onto the good.  And there was plenty good at Sola.  I had the just absurdly decadent chocolate, banana, bacon pancakes with Nutella.  Everything you want in such a dish.  Gooey chocolate, a little bit of salty goodness with the bacon.  Total dessert junk food breakfast.  The Mrs. went for the steak and eggs.  The steak was tender and covered in Hollandaise sauce that tasted great without totally dominating the steak.  We both had the Togarashi Hash Browns.  These shredded potatoes had a little kick to them not always found in hash browns, and were an excellent compliment to the meal. The service, outside of the aforementioned drink issue was good.  The hostess was very friendly and steered us away from a table that was about to be right next to a huge party.  Our waiter was prompt and answered all our questions.   Overall this was a positive experience.  We will definitely be coming back here for brunch in the future, and I would be quite willing to revisit this rating if they tighten the service up just a bit more, because, well because I really really loved the pancakes!",0.9952,0.819,0.163,0.018,0.5118783068783069

No really, the food was fantastic... let's start with my favourite topic :: the bread.  I love the randomness of Sola's bread basket... it's like bread basket surprise.  You have the typically loaf stuff, but then they throw in something fun like a pretzel roll (and seriously, pretzel rolls are friggin amazing and should really start being the rule, rather than the exception), and then you get these tasty flatbread-esque crisps that are basically flavor explosions of herbs + spices... sooo yummy.  You can tell that they make everything from scratch and really, I would have been totally content with just eating the bread with my wine.  SO GOOD. But then we ventured into small plates, and it was game over.  King Crab :: a modern twist on the crab cake... huge chunks of fresh crab + potato gnocchi bites.  Not your usual greasy crab pancake... this plate is crab chunk (CHUNK!) heaven. We got the sashimi that was on special... hamachi + salmon... superb, especially with the sriracha they had on hand (yay for sriracha!!!).  Normally comes with shrimp, but the bf is allergic and Sola had no problem doubling up on the other fishies to make up for the shrimp.   Tuna poke :: a really generous portion.... love the fact that they found a way to put rice in the poke without taking away from flavors and the tuna itself.  Delicious.   Wine :: good solid selection, priced at +8 bones... but they have half bottles in case you try a couple of different things.  Cocktails have a hand-made factor to them... Everything seemed crushed, pureed, mixed fresh on the spot.   The bf had artichoke fritters (good) + soft center chocolate cake (really good).  The chocolate cake was reminiscent of Roy's infamous chocolate souffle, and the ice cream tasted homemade.  Both were perfectly not-too-sweet where you could enjoy the whole thing.

Hard decisions. It's my first date with this guy. He's cute and I think we clicked. We are to meet under the Bean in Millenium Park. I prefer calling it the Cloud Gate...way more romantic. Right? I am nervous. My English is not that good and I will have to talk all day long....wow...can I nod all day? Hmmm.... Februrary 4th, 2010: The date went pretty well. He took me to the suburbs (first trip ever for me!!) and we had a lovely time at the zoo....we hold hands watching dolphins. I learned one of my favorite English words, pacifier. I made a mess eating sushi. We listened to Travis in the car. And now it's 5 years later. So much happened since that day, a lot of bad actually...but a lot of love too. We are good together, in a very peaceful and serene way. We got married last year. And in all that time we ate our way out through Chicago. With much delight. We had come to sola a few times already for brunch (pre-Yelp era) and decided to give it a try for dinner this time.

And a monkey card. We go in, sit down and get lost in the menu. One of our favorite things in the world. I spot right away my appetizer, butter poached crab. I spot his. Share the news. We are ready to start. The crab is a true delight. Two big chunks of king crab legs, a wonderful crab cake, sweet potato gnocchi, chive, ginger, tatsoi.... Rich, balanced, exquisite. It is followed by the fish special of the day, opaka paka (Hawaiian red snapper) served with crispy skin. Roasted chestnut, long green beans, wild mushroom, ponzu reduction. Solid if not mind-blowing. The true moment of grace was dessert. We chose the butternut squash bread pudding which was absolutely divine, Ho'oponopono style. Served with a soft soy ice cream (out of this world), a black sesame brittle and a sweet balsamic reduction it was no ordinary bread pudding....no....light and airy, it was more along the line of a slightly sweet custard with melting pieces of squash and it made my heart flutter.

Regardless, I was STARVING so I ordered the Spare Rib Benedict.  I was craving protein so I figured why not.  While the taste was good, it was served to me cold.  At this point we had been waiting for what seemed like years for our food, so I decided to scarf it down without sending it back.  It was decent, perhaps way too rich for a 11:00 a.m. meal, but immediately it was like a punch to the stomach.  Way way way too heavy for me.

So, my husband and I decided to have a last hurrah dinner last night before the semester started and we stop seeing each other at all.  Again.  Not to mention we had a  restaurant.com  certificate. The restaurant was pretty empty when we arrived, but it was a hella cold Monday and they had just opened (can we say 1000 point OpenTable reservation?).  We were immediately seated near the fireplace, which helped with that cold.  There is a great, laid back feeling to the place, and it looks like there is a good spot for private groups to the right of the door. Our server Marnie, was FANTASTIC.  She walked the line between attentive and hovering perfectly, always had a recommendation, didn't push, and offered samples of wine when I decided to get indecisive.  Everyone one of her recommendations was accurate and spot-on. As for the food.  My husband's lentil soup was solid.  Nothing fantastic, but it was good.  Could have used more seasoning perhaps?  Of course, it didn't use a chicken or beef base, so that may have been part of the issue. My king crab appetizer was pricey, but great!  Excellent mash of flavors, and really enjoyable. Nick's pork 3-way was awesome.  Really, really fantastic.  Great presentation, good mix of textures, and the flavors were out of this world.  They also offered the tenderloin to order, and I can't tell you how nice it is to not have pork overcooked because someone has a random trichinosis fear.  Unfortunately, it didn't get the attention it deserved because it was competing with... One of the best Wagyu steaks I've ever had.  Seriously.  The flavor and texture of my new york strip was  out.of.this.world .  And the preperation was perfect.  There was one small issue that my mushrooms didn't initially come out.  The only reason I even realized it was because Marnie and I had discussed them - the dish didn't seem to be missing anything.  However, once they were quickly whisked to my table, I couldn't believe I had ever lived without them.  Seriously. Drinks were very good, but not inexpensive.  I really liked the pretty in pink  drink of the month, worth the $ (although I skipped a second because of the $.)  Great selection of wines by the glass, and knowledgeable staff.

Anyhow, it was cold and we got a table right away for Saturday brunch next to the fireplace, so I figured it was OK. It got more OK when my food came; short ribs eggs benedict.

Next the eggs; one was perfectly poached with a runny yolk, the other was solid inside (one of my pet peeves), but at least they got one out of two right.

We had a largish group of 7 adults and four babies for Sola on a Sunday morning.  They accepted our reservation (probably with a bit of a hesitation - I know I would have!) and were all ready for us when we arrived!  It was awesome!  Our table was centrally located and I loved the atmosphere.  It was just loud enough for a Sunday a.m. to lull my baby to sleep in his carseat and not too loud that we could have a conversation and talk without yelling. Our server was a lovely British (maybe?? Cute accent, that's all I know!) who was very helpful with the menu and only slightly scattered.  Despite her being a bit slow with the bill, everything else was AH-MA-ZING (as Sarah G. would say). So ...let's just discuss the food...We started off with drinks.  I had the palmango mimosa (soooo pretty and good), and we ordered these fried dough balls that came with lemon and raspberry dipping sauce.  DE-LISH-IS-NESS!  I wish I could have made my entire meal out of those but I am so happy I didn't. :P  i personally ordered the chilaquiles which was awesome!! There was a bit of kick to it but it was an incredible way to start my day (did I mention I was in a bad mood - I was, but they fixed it!).  I am just sitting here remembering the mouthwatering bites of the eggs, pico and guac all together now...mmmmmmm. I also indulged in a bite of Sarah G's short rib Benedict.  I believe that is the only reason she comes to this place! :) And, the kiddos had pancakes and some other goodies.  Everything was so wonderful!

I tried my friend's NY Strip from the prix fixe and there is no comparison. Hers tasted like something from Applebee's compared to my hangar steak. I also tried my other friend's short ribs, which were also delicious. Mine was a 10. Short ribs were an 8. NY strip was a 6. I had the hot fudge sundae for dessert which was pretty good.

For dinner, they had an appealing $30 prix fixe of soup, steak, and dessert. Two of us got that and the other two got the specials of the night, which were a Colorado Rack and a bacon wrapped white fish. All of the dishes were nicely plated. The butternut (?) soup had great flavor and texture. The steaks were cooked nicely, but I was disappointed that the meat was so tough. The fish was dry, despite being bacon wrapped. The rack looked great. Dessert was a crepe with a pastry built like a nest and topped with vanilla ice cream. It also came with a shot of mixed liquid, which had an apple turnaround taste. Ice cream was awesome and probably the highlight of the meal. Overall, it was an average meal, but I felt it was overpriced. Execution of the main courses could have been better.

2009-11-05,4.0,"jimandbrittneyeatchicago…   It was our first Valentine's Day, and we're spending it at another Á la Card establishment! Sola was ready for the big day, with gorgeous table tops and a printed specials menu. We opted for a mix of the aphrodisiacs on the list and some items from their everyday menu. We started with two wines, the Duval-Leroy Brut Champagne (France) and the Brooks Amycas (Oregon). With the wine came our first special, the oysters two ways - kumamotos on the half shell with Meyer lemon emulsion, and Thai basil... and malpecs tempura with avocado wasabi puree, basil cucumber salad, and American sturgeon caviar. The kumamotos were extremely fresh for the Midwest. We both commented that they ""tasted like the sea."" We had never had fried oysters before, but they were surprisingly light, and the avocado wasabi puree was delicious. A very successful aphrodisiac, from what we could tell. We then shared the crispy mushroom salad, which was baby arugula, Asian pear, shallots, pleasant ridge, cider truffle vinaigrette, and of course, crispy mushrooms! This salad could do no wrong. The mushrooms were like nothing we'd ever tasted, the pears added a delightful sweetness, and how on earth could cider truffle vinaigrette not be amazing?! It was a great salad, and it was unique enough to be memorable. For her entree, Brittney had the scallops with green apple crab risotto, green beans, and apple curry butter. The description made this dish sound perfect for me, but it turned out to be pretty disappointing. Though the scallops were very well down, and the apple curry flavor was nice when I could taste it, the risotto was extremely fishy and didn't taste at all like apples or crab. I ate most of the scallops and the green beans, but I left the risotto, which I thought would be the highlight of the dish, mostly untouched. For his entree, Jim ordered a special, Carol's Colorado lamb chops with cambazola cheese, cauliflower puree, wilted spinach, shallots, and shaved fennel. For our final course, we ordered a sweet dish and a savory one. To satisfy Brittney's ever-growing desire for sugar, we got caramel apple bread pudding with Roxbury russet, Szechwan peppercorn-cider sauce, and sweet soy vanilla ice cream. Yes, it was definitely as good as it looks and sounds. This was quite possibly the best bread pudding we've had, and that's saying a lot. We always gravitate towards it on any menu, mostly because it tends to come with interesting pairings. This was no exception, and it was a perfect Valentine's Day treat. However, next year they should find a way to make it pink. To satisfy our (constant) cravings for cheese, we got a really nice cheese plate, which included housemade fruit preserves, nuts humboldt fog (California, goats milk), gouda aged 4 yr. (Holland, cows milk), and manchego (Spain, sheeps milk).  Each new cheese was better than the last, and we literally scraped the plate clean. A perfect ending to an almost perfect Valentine's Day meal (company was perfect, risotto was troubling).  The ambiance of the place was pretty lively and friendly, and we even struck up a conversation about whisky with a nearby table. However, we told them ahead of time that we wanted a slow meal, and we instead got the feeling that they wanted to turn over our table three times before V-Day was over. Overall, the food only missed the mark once, but frankly, we're not likely to go back any time soon. If you're in the area and want to stop in for salads and dessert, then we say, ""Bon appétit!""",0.9993,0.729,0.236,0.035,0.5944892649438104

Well, that was my sentiment as I entered Sola on saturday morning. The first thing I ordered was the malasadas (portugese donut).  I have had malasadas in Hawaii, where they sell them in parking lots and on the side of the street.  I would say they are comparable.  What I loved about the malasadas here were the lovely dipping sauces, one raspberry and one mango.  Oww oww.   We actually saved the two sauces to dip our bread in.  People kept trying to take them away from us, and we would have to slap their hands away (and apologize later...maybe). Another Hawaiian dish I love is Kalua Pork.  Good Kalua pork is the bomb.  You can imagine my delight when I saw Kalua Pork hash on the menu!  This dish hassss PERFECTLY cooked kalua pork, yummy hashbrowns, egg, and guacamole!   HANDS DOWN, BEST BRUNCH DISH I'VE EVER HAD.  I was so in love with it I ate it all and wanted more.   If only the dinner was this good, I'd try to move in to Sola.  Sleeping bag under the reception desk... and I could shower in the sink.  It'd be awesome.",0.9981,0.718,0.282,0.0,0.5924836601307188
2009-10-29,4.0,"I was really impressed with sola. The woman I spoke with when making reservations was polite and helpful and our service was really excellent when we arrived. We had 2 servers because one was new and both were great- I never would have guessed one was being trained. He actually steered me towards a cheaper entree of the two I was considering, which is nice (and also appreciated, since the short ribs were excellent). My friend had the wasabi crusted tuna which was also delicious. The tab was much more than I'd like to spend but it was a really great place to have a special meal or to treat yourself once in awhile. We each had an entree and their lowest price glass of wine and our tab was $75. Each entree was $25-$30, which is about double what I'm used to spending. The food was worth it for sure, but I can't dine out at this price often.  Judging from the reviews and the photos on Yelp it sounds like sola changes its menu frequently which seems cool and a way to try new things each time. I'd love to come back.",0.9916,0.76,0.225,0.016,0.548543255686113
2009-10-28,4.0,"After going here I realized how long it's been since I've gone to a restaurant where the food comes out looking so pretty. I regrettably forgot to charge my camera before going (Ugh!) so I unfortunately don't have photographic evidence of said pretty food. Trust me though, it's quite aesthetically pleasing. Ah, but the prices make my eyes water just a tad, lol. Let's get started. I must inform you that this place is NOT on Lincoln Ave. It's like a door and 1/2 west of Lincoln Ave which had me befuddled for a few minutes when I was 100% sure I was reading the addresses correctly. Go to 3900 N. Lincoln Ave and look West. As you will see right away, it has an open and fresh decor of wood, metal, glass, and white. A contemporary environment with a hint of casual. I immediately felt it to be the restaurant equivalent of Jake clothing store. Yep, if you've been to Jake you know what I mean. The hostess was very friendly when I entered and didn't question my intentions when I walked toward the table where my dinner companion was waiting for me. It requires repeating that it has sadly been a while since I've dined at a place like this so I was bit taken aback by the relatively small menu. There wasn't much to choose from. And from the selection that existed, there was a lot of fusion going on. I like new and innovative dishes, but some flavors I just can do without being fused together. Wasabi ketchup? Ginger kumquat jam? Apple togarashi compote along w/port and red curry jus in a dish? Now you guys are just ""doing the most."" What did I have? I won't lie. I played it safe with the least Jackson Pollock-like dish on there. I got the 1/2 chicken with shallots and some chopped spinach, on top of Chinese black rice dressed with minted yogurt ($21). It was damn tasty. The chicken was pan fried with that type of golden light crisp to the skin that you can only get in restaurants such as these. The meat was juicy and flavorful with there being a leg and a breast. The minted yogurt was a fantastic complement. I only wish there would have been more on the plate. I liked the rice. It had a hearty flavor with a bit of sweetness much like you get with chianti. Now it said spinach on the menu, but it didn't taste like spinach. It taste more like chard and it overpowered the other flavors when I ate it. Most of that stayed on the plate. I also got a side of mac and cheese ($6) which was really a side. It was a generous portion of creamy 4 cheese deliciousness. It had the lovely baked golden top to it and paired with the entree, filling but not too much. Dessert. Once again I was confronted by strange fusions of flavors that just weren't sounding like dessert, let alone appetizing. Black vinegar sorbet? Wasabi vanilla bean syrup? Mmmmmmn, I can't do it. I was going to opt for the mai'a hot fudge sundae which was banana ice cream, hot fudge, macadamia nuts, and bruleed banana ($8). I thought banana ice cream AND bruleed banana was just too much b-a-n-a-n-a-s for me, but the waiter was going to have vanilla ice cream substituted. I knew I couldn't eat it alone and my dinner companion wasn't up for it, so I missed out. Boooooo. Just means I'll have to go back! So even though I wasn't feeling all of the fusiony trendy options, I would definitely go back. The prices are a little higher than I've gotten used to paying, but it's not in the Tavern on Rush price territory. Sola has an extensive wine list and some great sounding cocktails. I'd could see myself dropping back in for appetizers, cocktails and dessert while sitting at the bar. Ooooh, sounds like a great date idea!",0.998,0.798,0.158,0.044,0.5419309306214067
2009-10-26,4.0,"I have frequently been here for dinner, which is excellent for fresh seasonal ingredients, and fish dishes (also meat dishes).  However, their brunch should not be overlooked either. For starters, while it doesn't appear it would be a kid friendly restaurant, their Sunday brunch gets plenty (and early dinners do as well).  So, definitely don't be afraid to bring the whole family. I have had their steak and eggs, which is excellent with a prime piece of meat, and a couple of eggs.  However, this past visit I strayed and had the pork hash, which was fantastic!  It was pulled pork (slightly smoked) blended with what seemed were their house potatos (well spiced and super fresh), topped with a couple of eggs of your choice.  The combo was truly excellent, and I can't wait to have it again. Also at the table was the farmers market omelet, which was basically what was freshly picked up at the Green City Mkt.  It too was good, but the cheese was more like a super rich cream cheese (my laymans assessment) and would have been substituted with a more basic swiss had we known. Plus, coffee was good, which is definitely a necessity for any breakfast/brunch out. Finally, look for their coupons on  dining.com  ($10 off usable Sunday).",0.9912,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.577

As you probably gathered, I started with the foie gras ravioli with Vietnamese caramel.  It was a great combination of flavors and I loved it.  For the main course, I ordered the pork, which is comprised of grilled loin, braised cheek and kalua pork with figs and bacon bread pudding.  I love kalua pork, but the highlight of the dish was the grilled loin.  It was delicious and prepared perfectly.  My bf chose the cobia, served with potato gnocchi and mussels.  It was also very good.

Attended a six-person surprise birthday brunch here last weekend and, I have to say, we had a really excellent time. Being that we were a surprise brunch, the hostess and server were gracious in seating us and putting up with our antics before the Birthday Boy arrived. The coffee is decent. A bit of a lighter roast than I like but drinkable. I also ordered a juice which was underwhelming. The malasadas, however, were outstanding. Perfect little sugary pillows of yum! There were 5 different dishes ordered at our table: Crab & Leek omelet, Huevos Benedictos, Short Ribs Benedict, French Toast, and two orders of the 5-Spice waffle.  According to the meat eaters, the Short Ribs Benedict was the winner in the meals, with the other benedict recipe a close second. The eater of the French Toast didn't express much love for her dish, but both waffles were devoured. The Crab and Leek omelet was good, but the Philistine in me prefers whitefish to crab for flavor in omelets. [Go 3-Mile Omelet at the Omelet Parlor in Colorado Springs!] Also, the staff brought out a fancy plate of truffles for the Birthday Boy which was sweet of them.

What inspired me to come here with another couple is the Chicago Gourmet event - I was really impressed by the tuna poke that was served there and I wanted to branch out with my friends into a neighborhood that we don't normally go to.  This restaurant is in North Center which is quite a trek for us near South folks. Other than that, I will say that we all really enjoyed our food. Appetizers ordered: Sweetbreads (special) - delicious, but really tiny portion.  I do recommend it but pricey for how much you get ($15) Heirloom Tomatoes - nice ripe, colorful tomatoes, tasted fresh Potstickers - these were ok - I've eaten millions of potstickers in my life (I'm Asian!) and I prefer the skin of the potsticker to be a bit thinner but nice bold flavors Tuna Poke - I have never been to Hawaii, so I'm not sure how Poke is typically served but I've never seen is served with rice.  It was still very good - the tuna and the dressings were served justed like at Chicago Gourmet (but no rice at CG). Entrees - star of the show was by far - the short ribs - which I learned had won an award in 2007 from the Restaurant Association.  super tender and absolutely flavorful. Halibut - served very undercooked but fresh Duck Confit - My husband says his dish was 7/10 - so very good but not stellar. I had the pork done three ways which if it had been served hot, I would have loved it.  Really tender - flavors were penetrated deep into the meat which was exceptional.  I've often had or made pork from center cut meat and found it difficult to have flavor unless marinated for long periods of 24 hours or more. Dessert - Mmmm...the four of us shared the soft centered chocolate cake - is was AWESOME!

The grand marnier souffle french toast was good, but it wasn't great. It was pretty cold by the time it got to us (sitting outside), and while it was good, it didn't blow me away like I was expecting it to. Still, service was good. We ate outside, but I like the atmosphere inside from what little I saw--very warm and subdued. The tea was a little disappointing since it was from bags and served in a pot that got cold very quickly (again, sitting outside, so maybe that was part of it?). Also, we ordered a side of seasonal fruit that had some less than seasonal-tasting items in it, but it was quite large and only $3, so we weren't peeved.

Tracy had the Cobia, I had the Pork.  Both were good but not great.  Sola seems to put all of their effort into the sides that accompany the main dish.  If I could have a plate of nothing but the excellent sounding sides, for example the Bacon Bread Pudding, I'd be happy. Service was fine, but not great.  Ambiance was fine, but nothing special.  On the whole, I enjoyed the experience, but am I in a hurry to go back and pay $140 to relive it?  No I'm not. The best part for me was the dessert.  The sesame brittle icecream that sat along side the soft center chocolate cake was great.  Tracy was moaning in an eerily suggestive manor over the chocolate cake, but I had similarly erotic thoughts about the ice cream. Beer / drink selection was good, the fries are way overrated. So yeah, if the meal was $50 less or the main courses were far more memorable, this would have been a 4 star review.

The eggs benedict were damn delicious. The eggs were perfectly poached and oozed perfectly down the plate smothering the english muffin in a yolky nirvana. Sola's Canadian bacon was surprise.

After reviewing such rave reviews, a friend of mine and I had looked forward to trying a couple of starters in particular -- the truffle parmesan fries and the kalua potstickers.  The potstickers were very good, although as I ate them I wished that the pork itself had more flavor -- I found myself trying to scrape every last drop of the  mango kumquat salsa and cilantro oil off the plate.  I'd recommend them, but again...wish the potsticker itself had more going on.  As for the truffle parmesan fries...well, they were...just fries.  As I ate them, I couldn't help but think that there really wasn't much there and that I would have appreciated them more had I had a hot dog or burger to accompany them. Of the other sides and appetizers, I'd skip them.

First off, I must say that every time we've eaten there I've been blown away by the food and the terrific cocktails. This restaurant has a nice relaxing atmosphere which is beautiful not not stuffy. It's a neighborhood place that folks bring their kids to, but it's not loud and obnoxious. The kids seem to know to behave, or the parents are actually good parents (that's a whole other story). It's peaceful. The brunch menu is really very extensive and offers a lot of great choices. We started with the yummy Portugese donuts which we loved. We also had two different mimosa's, one with pomegranite and mango the other with pineapple and passion fruit. Spectacular! Fresh fruit juice with decent champagne. Sola always has unique drink offerings on the menu and brunch is no exception.  I had the Short Rib Benedict. I've had the short ribs before so I knew they would be killer - and the dish did not disappoint. The cheddar corn biscuit that replaced the english muffin was delicious. Sola always uses the best fresh and local ingredients, which really makes the difference. The hollandaise was light and tasty as well. The hash browns were crunchy golden with a dash of spices.  My girlfriend had the Big Kahuna - Waygu hamburger with 2 eggs, potatoes, cheddar cheese and house-made bacon. This was HUGE and very, very good. Frankly, we could have split that item alone. I ended up helping her with it and it was delicious. The hamburger was just outstanding.  The service was impeccable the waitress was attentive but not annoying and was ready to answer any question we had. It was a very relaxing meal - we ate outside this time because it was such a nice day. We were a little to close to the prep station, which may not usually be a problem, but this day the bus boy seemed to be dropping things every couple of minutes, he seemed a little off his game, so it was pretty loud.

Enjoying a lovely summer evening on the patio, we started out with cocktails...she had the Couger margarita (made with elderflower liquer--she liked it, I thought it was ok) and I had the Manhattan (too strong.  wait, did I just say that? and some taste in it to which Ijust didn't quite take a liking.)  My second drink, however, the Black Cherry Soda, may very well have become one of my new favorite drinks--effen black cherry vodka, ibc cream soda, and brandied cherries.  I could have drank those all night were it not for the fact I wanted to keep standing (or sitting, rather). Delicious and obviously effective on me. To start, they gave us an amuse bouche of salmon on a wonton chip.  Fantastic.  then we shared the artichoke fritters and the potato gnocchi appetizers.  I was pretty disappointed, they were pretty small portions for the price, and flavorwise nothing stood out.  The food was not even hot either. I would skip the apps next time. For our entree, we split an order of the scallops and they were good (a little undercooked I thought, but I know some restaurants make them that way), but not mind-blowing.  For the prices, I expected more wow. The one saving grace was the truffle parmesan fries.  Now I normally do not even like french fries, but OHMYGODTHESEWEREAFLAVORGASM.  Seriously.  I would have licked the waxpaper they were coned in if no one was watching (heck, another drink and I may have done it anyway).

I ordered the scallops with soba dumplings and mushrooms, and oh my god was it delicious!  The scallops were perfect - sweet and fresh and perfectly seared.  Yum!  Hubby ordered the short ribs, which he devoured with gusto.  The flavor was amazing from the couple of bites I stole.   To finish off the meal we shared a blueberry lemongrass creme brulee, which was great as well.  The lemongrass gave the dish a light, refreshing taste that we loved.   Overall, this was an excellent splurge meal for us.  We had a coupon from  restaurant.com  ($25 off, which we paid $2 for), but our bill with tip was still $85.  Definitely not an inexpensive place, but it was a fabulous meal.  The ambiance of the place is somehow both fancy and relaxing and we never felt rushed or out of place.",0.9977,0.675,0.309,0.015,0.7282608695652174

It really is a foodie dream, but to those who don't care about presentation and creative ingredient pairings, it's still a great place to eat.  We started with a glass of wine at the bar, and I was duly impressed with their selection. I personally think wine is such an important part of a good meal, so having an excellent selection offering shows me that the restaurant really knows their food. We started with the Tuna Poke, which was absolutely perfect. I ordered the Scallops, of course, and was rewarded for my choice. The Soba Dumplings were amazing too! Scuba Steve had the Cobia, not only because he is a fish fan like me, but an even bigger bacon fan. It was a tough choice for him because their short ribs came highly recommended (which I almost ordered) but since he had had them there before he decided to try something new, and he also loved his dish. To top it off we ordered the Jasmine Rice Pudding Spring Roll, which came with a Black Vinegar Sorbet  - the juxtaposition of the sweetness and richness of the Spring Roll and the tanginess of the sorbet was incredible - it amplified the flavors of both items without detracting from either one of them. They had several other offerings as well, but I was extremely happy with our selection! Our server was also incredibly well-informed and helpful in selecting our choices, and while the service was a wee bit slow, it was understable since it was a Saturday night!

2009-06-05,5.0,"I'm knocking sola up to 5 stars, with the clear understanding that 1) it's probably not a ""5 star"" restaurant, and 2) there is room for improvement. BUT ... I always have a great time here. You know those places where you can just go and relax, where you feel comfortable bringing friends because you feel confident they'll enjoy it? That's my experience with sola. Everything about the place is so professionally run, and the food is so good and (god help us) creative, that I trust them to take care of me. I stopped in this week with a friend and her mother. Both mother and daughter can be picky, and both were happy as clams. It was chilly, but the fireplace was roaring, so that got us off to a good start. I had the house Manhattan, which was a delight. Mom had a special drink order, and it was delivered flawlessly. For dinner, I had the lamb chops which were on special, and they were cooked perfectly. If you've had lamb chops that were not cooked perfectly, you know what that means. Mom had the short ribs -- braised with an Asian touch, with hoisin and lemongrass, I cannot recommend these enough. I started off with the roasted beet and pineapple salad, which sounds strange, but turned out to be a lovely blend of sweet, earthy, and sharp, from the manchego cheese. This is the way in which the food is creative -- interesting combinations, without being too cute or clever. For me, the one flaw is dessert. They're either too pedestrian -- molten chocolate cake -- or too odd -- sweet potato and beet tart, jasmine rice pudding spring roll. I recommend opting for a flight of the ice creams and/or sorbets, which are consistently good. sola is not inexpensive. But my experience there is on par with places that charge twice as much. And that makes worth 5 stars.",0.9975,0.712,0.248,0.04,0.6200892857142857
2009-06-02,3.0,"A friend and I went for an early dinner together. Our waitress was very friendly. She seemed comfortable with us and perhaps enjoyed the fact that we were quite ""normal"" and laid back. (The clientele there seemed to be very Gold Coast-like--we were definitely not in our element. And perhaps my overly sensitive female side of me sensed that type of snubbishness from who I thought to be the manager--or maybe he just didn't like to smile much. Who knows.) Now for the food. They provided a bread ""basket"". The pretzel rolls were delicious. I even indulged in one after the meal. The crispy flatbread, pretty as it was, was okay. It felt more like a garnish. We moved onto the appetizer. Taking everyone's recommendation, we started with the truffle parmesean fries. They were very tasty and seemed to have been cooked in a different type of oil due to their flavor. Personally, though, I find seasoned, crispy fries to be the best so I wasn't blown away. But then again, I'm not a fry conoissieur. Then the actual meal began. They brought out an amuse bouche. It was carrot curry soup with goat cheese and a crouton. Delicious. Following that came our entrees. I ordered the bacon wrapped Cobia after reading the rave reviews here on Yelp. To be honest, I was very disappointed. I take that back--for $27 extremely dissappoited. While it was plated beautifully, the bacon that was wrapped around the fish was quite chewey and was simply not flavorful. The fish itself was too salty and, for lack of a better word--blah. The sauces on the plate were not too flavorful either. At least none of them stuck out to me or were rich enough in flavor to mask the blandness of the meal.  There were, however, tasty morsels of bacon at the bottom of the dish. That would have to be my highlight. I will say that I do hesitate in my critique when I look over the other reviews of this dish but my friend felt the same after taking a bite. She got the kalua pork potstickers and said they were wonderful (I should have taken a bite). So in short, my main entree merits 2 stars in my book but I will rate the overall expereince with 3. I just had extremely high expectations for this dinner and found it to be one of the worst meals I have had in quite some time. Sorry Sola! Maybe it was just a bad day.  Oh! and if you're looking to save some money on the check go to  restaurant.com  and buy a $25 gift certificate. Usually they cost $10 but you can find discount codes by digging around online (Google). I paid only $2.",0.9839,0.836,0.118,0.046,0.5339958592132504

I would go here anyday, anytime, for any meal.  I thought for as good as the food was, it was still fairly reasonable.  Our waitress was SUPER cool but got kind of lazy/unattentive after our food came (and we needed drink refills) which was a smidge annoying, because they weren't busy.  In her defense, we are lushes.  But otherwise the service was great and I am chomping at the bit to go back.",0.9911,0.73,0.215,0.054,0.5786099865047234

2009-05-11,3.0,"Went here for Mother's Day brunch. After reading all of the fantastic reviews we were pretty disappointed. Service: 2 stars Perhaps they weren't used to the traffic, but our waitress was a little distracted. We had to wait for coffee, the runner spilled coffee and water all over the table, she didn't know the details about the specials and she was definitely distracted.  Food: 3 stars we had the pineapple upside down french toast -- although light and not heavy it wasn't flavorful either. The black forest omelet was tasty but not particularly noteworthy. The short rib benedict was just odd -- the short rib was too sour and overwhelmed the delicious cheddar biscuit and the pesto hollandaise. The crab quiche was not good at all -- it was too fishy, too salty, lukewarm, would have preferred warm or cold and i unfortunately had to send it back. The chilaquiles were the one dish we all agreed was delicious. It was flavorful and had a nice spice level. The maui mimosa was also delicious. Value: The brunch was pretty expensive for brunch but incredibly affordable for Mother's Day which I liked. When I called and asked if there was a special prix fix menu for Mother's Day the greeter said ""no, we don't do that here"". I really appreciated their simple honesty and desire not to ""stiff"" customers just because it was Mother's Day.

2009-04-18,5.0,"10 things I love about Sola (and that you will too): 1) The Asian-Hawaiian influence manifests itself in their cooking, but never overbearingly or underwhelmingly. Sola is amazingly consistent and skilled in creating new dishes for their menu. It seems as if they always use fresh, seasonal ingredients to create unconventional but delicious pairings.  2) Being part of their mailing list. I love getting e-mails about the latest food competition they've entered a classic dish in, or about the latest prix fixe and wine pairing, which brings me to... 3) The latest meal I had there: an Artichoke prix fixe of 3 courses for $30 with wine pairing at $15. A steal of a deal in terms of quantity/quality. 4) An appetizer staple: Artichoke fritters with a white truffle honey sauce that made me consider being totally indecent and drinking the leftover sauce. 5) They made a candied artichoke tart with goat cheese mascarpone and meyer lemon that was amazing. I'll be honest, I was hesitant to think of a sweet artichoke/goat cheese dessert, and boyfriend was outright cynical about it, but it was sheer bliss - one of the best desserts I've had the privilege of indulging in at this city. For the less adventurous, their regular desserts (such as their molten center chocolate cake) are just as orgasmic and palate-pleasing. 6) Dale Levitski - A Top Chef Season 3 highlight who waits at tables here, Dale is engaging and charming to all who ask about his plans to open a new restaurant (and I hear at least one table ask every time I visit).   7) Brunch. I can't get over it. Whenever we have people from out of town for brunch, we take them to sola. It's classy, understated, yet reasonably priced...and there's always something for everyone.  8) Parmesan truffle fries: enough said. 9) Drinks: For the oenophiles, trust them with the pairings, they will bring a great compliment to your meal. And for the rest of the lushes: the drink list is great. Martinis, mimosas, bloody mary's, beers, oh my, the wizard of (bo)oz(e). 10) Attention  restaurant.com  users, they honor their coupons with subtlety - it's incredibly easy so don't hesitate to visit with one.

2009-03-04,4.0,"I had the pleasure of trying this place when my coworker forwarded an email about Sola's ""Da Governor"" dirty martini and appetizer special (in honor of Gov. Rod Blagojevich's impending impeachment). The martini was laughable (and free with purchase of appetizer), garnished with a mini comb flanked with two green olives, and the appetizers were exquisite.  When I made reservations with Sola for our group of 5, I was a bit taken aback that the restaurant requested to keep a credit card on file. It was the first time I ever heard of such a practice, and I believe it is because they charge you for missing your reservation, although you can safely cancel your reservation up to 5 minutes before your intended arrival. The concierge was also gracious in accepting my requests that day to push our reservation back...twice. My friend described walking into the restaurant as ""walking into a J. Crew catalog."" All of the patrons were nicely dressed and looked financially well-off, whereas we were a group of relatively under-dressed 20somethings who were taking advantage of a promotional offer. It took 15 minutes for the staff to clear a table for us since we arrived during dinnertime on a weekend. In the meantime, they hung our coats for us and allowed us to wait at the bar to order drinks. Other patrons admired our ""Da Governor"" martinis that were not on the main menu. The martini was well shaken and smooth. Appetizers were preceded with an ""amuse-bouche"", a new experience for me that truly did ""amuse my mouth"" with its taste that readied my palate for the forthcoming appetizers. We each ordered different appetizers: calamari tempura, tuna poke, 'kalua' pot stickers, crispy mushroom salad, and the crab cake special. The calamari tempura was lightly breaded and not oily, with perfectly soft calamari. The tuna poke looked like a large cut of a maki roll, and was good, though its not something I would order again. The crispy mushroom salad was excellent and lightly dressed, including fresh, spicy arugula. The 'kalua' pot stickers were the most favored appetizer among my peers; and the crab cakes were a special that I remember having a nice sweetness to them.  Because we were so impressed with our appetizers, we also ordered dessert: butternut squash and sweet potato tart, yuzu cheesecake, banana hazelnut brulee, and assorted ice cream and sorbet. The tart was unusual and I applaud the restaurant for taking a risk with dessert. The banana hazelnut brulee is what I plan to order next time, and the other desserts were just tasty. Overall, I really liked Sola and hope to come back and try their entrees.",0.997,0.783,0.184,0.033,0.5576257076257075
2009-03-04,4.0,"Any place that serves an amuse-bouche and also has it taste like heaven is my kind of place... plus then I can say amuse-bouche over and over the rest of the night.  Sola is now my perfect example of elegant dining. As soon as you walk in you are greeted warmly plus we were seated right away, so bonus. Though we did have reservations but regardless we didn't have to wait for a table which is very unusual (though they have a beautiful bar area so I wouldn't have minded). The decor and table settings are perfect, not to intrusive but very stylish. I don't know if anybody else has noticed but the flatware was from IKEA**, which is really funny to me (I was admiring how cool they were and then I flipped them over and went Nooooooooooooo). My only complaint is that the tables are a little too close to each other (the girl at the next table got up and we got full shot of her ass and it almost dragged on our table as she went by... she was very tall) and that it gets extremely loud.  Sola seems to really wHip their servers into shape. Not only was it great service but I would give a star for actually remembering all the specials, which took almost 5 minutes to go over all of them. Very attentive without being overbearing. Just a note for the water-boys, let my glass go down at least halfway before refilling. I swear this dude just stood be hind me the entire night filling my glass after each sip.  Again as I said elegant, their menu is creative and executed wonderfully. We started with the Calamari tempura with a saffron aioli sauce, it was a hard choice for the apps but we were more then satisfied with the pick. Actually the whole menu is really hard to pick from because you want it all. For our main course she had the Tuna hoisin-mustard-panko crusted, bamboo rice, avocado tempura, soy-wasabi buerre blanc and of course I HAD to have a bite or two or four. I went with the 1/2 chicken shallots, spinach, minted yogurt, Chinese black rice. The chicken was tender and gone in no time. And last the dessert ( I have to say that I'm a little pissed off at their dessert menu... there is WAY TOO MUCH AWESOME desserts to pick from), we finally after much debate chose the mai'a hot fudge sundae, banana ice cream, hot fudge, macadamia nuts, bruleed banana. It was the perfect ending.  I'm going back to try their lunch and brunch menus as soon as I can!! **IKEA = HELL on Earth",0.9922,0.792,0.147,0.061,0.6398253968253969

2009-02-17,3.0,"Ate here on the Sunday after Valentines Day to miss the large crowd and rush of the Holiday (and I forgot to make reservations earlier than a week in advance, please dont PM Brianna W this info). Their phone etiquette when making the reservation for Sunday made me want to ask the guy to hang out with me this coming weekend (very friendly).  Place seemed pretty minimalist in design and somewhat boring to me. Nonetheless, I thought it a pleasant environment for a meal. I can see how someone might say the people are crammed into the place with how the tables are laid out. Since we were here on a Sunday (and at 5:30pm even, call me grandpa if you'd like), there weren't many people.  The food itself, I thought also worth of 3 stars. Since they still had the Valentines Day aphrodisiac menu available, I tried to order as much from it as possible. For appetizers, we had the two types of mussels (OK) and the foix grois and scallops (my first experience with foix grois and more than likely my last, just not my bag baby). I had the wagyu strip and thought prepared nicely, just didnt grab me. It came with new potatoes: it seriously was one new potato about the size of a chickens egg chopped into small cubes (~10 marble sized pieces). It also came with ~4 asparagus stalks. Brianna W had the salmon and I didnt think too much of it when I snuck a bite when she went to the bathroom (jk BLW). Had the bread pudding desert (opted for the soy ice cream versus the chefs option of bacon crisp) and again, nothing special.

The experience overall was poor. We felt very rushed. We ordered a bottle of wine, soup, entrees, and desert.

2009-02-15,5.0,"Great work Sola.  You made our Valentine's Day a great success.   The finance and I decided on Sola for this years V-day dinner and we were very happy.  We had early reservations so service was fine to be expected.  Very welcoming upon walking in and our waitress was very nice, knowledgeable and accommodating.   Now. . . we are easy guests. . . not too picky.  However the table next to us defined ""pain-in-the-ass"" ""wait-staff-nightmare"" ""if-you-are-never-happy-why-do-you-go-out?""  First, they got seated at a table next to wall.  Wow!  You would have thought they got sat next to a stinky garbage can.  They made a huge deal of this and were moved (all of 10') to the other side of us.  Then, they also freaked out when their entrees came out 5 minutes after their apps.  Mind you it's Valentine's Day and I'm sure the kitchen was just slammin.  Bottom line, the wait staff was SO ACCOMMODATING and nice to these freaks.  We really could not believe how composed and nice they remained.  Service = 5. Drink.  We had some pre-dinner cocktails and mine was awesome.  The Newton was a Calvados (apple brandy) and apple cider concoction that was like an upscale, apple version of my favorite cocktail, the Brandy Old Fashion.  Only thing missing was an apple garnish of some sort.  Our waitress was also very knowledgeable about wine when it came to dinner time and they have a wine manager on hand as well. Food.  Foie and scallop appetizer was good.  As were some pork potsickers.  Well seasoned and presented.  Fiance got the stuffed lamb chops and I had a Waygu strip.  Whatever the lamb chops were stuffed with was awesome, some sort of cheese stuffing that really complimented the lamb flavor.  My Waygu was cooked perfectly and had a peppery, well finished sauce.  I thought the serving sizes were good, 8-10 oz steak and Fiance got 3 chops with her order.   The food highlight was desert.  We got too very different deserts.  One was a grapefruit sorbet surrounded by a crispy shell and custard.  The sorbet had a very light and crisp flavor which was an interesting contrast to the the light, acidic, sorbet.  The two actually were very good together, and the shell gave some good texture.   Our other desert was a trio of house made ice cream . . .vanilla. . .banana. . . and . . . . drum roll please . . . . BACON ice cream. . oh yeah!  it was valentine's day and I fell in love all over again.  Leave it to bacon ice cream to make the fiance jealous!  It was a delicious butter custard with sprinklings of candied bacon throughout.  really. . .really. . .really good.  I considered canceling the rest of our plans for the night and just asking for a pint and going home!  Much like the bacon sausage at Hot Doug's, I will be devoting a large part of my life to replicating this treat at home. All in all a great success, 10 times better than last year's v-day nightmare at Le Sardine.  I signed up for the newsletter and I expect we'll be seeing you again soon.  I really like restaurants that strive to change things up and experiment and looking at the newsletter, I can't wait!",0.9988,0.765,0.214,0.021,0.5415901875901877

I went with a group of friends to dinner, I see a lot of reviews here are brunch goers so I do not mean to offend, but here goes:  The staff was friendly, and other then not hearing our waiter correctly once or twice, he did a good job and i have no issues here. We had a sampling of 3 before and 3 after courses, and a varied main course across the table. I had the salmon - it was very very good. As with each dish and each course, the presentation was excellent, really obvious that is was a very big part of the experience and they put a lot of effort into it. However portions were very small, and we were Left wanting after each course, maybe a good thing for some, and I am not asking for 10 pound plate portions like some restaurants seem to think is necessary, but more is better when the food is this good.  1 person tried the tuna, and was very unhappy with it compared to other restaurants - all the other meals were satisfactory. I had a side of veggies which were very fresh, and we also had a round of the fries and onion strings - both were tasty and worth ordering. Overall the food was good, but the menu was limited to very specific main courses and each was smaller then I would have expected to see for the price we paid, 6 people and the bill was almost $5 large with a few drinks and a bottle of vino, ouch. I know some higher price places will cost more, but I would not expect to pay this much and walk away with anything unsatisfactory.  The deserts had more choices then the dinners, and were again presented very well and were very tasty, but again were small.

So since we were in the same hood,  I suggested Sola because the others in the group hadn't been and believe me they were thrilled that I did. They were much busier than they had expect, but the service was still great. Our waiter was Dale from Top Chef and I thought it was him when he first came by and then K confirmed that it was him, but we didn't say anything at first.  All the food was excellent, I got the Chiliaquiles again but this time with some chroizo, nice touch. K got the same thing but was a little disappointed that the tortillas weren't actually chips but cut into smaller pieces. So for you fans of Chiliaquiles, just be warned. C got the crabcakes and said they were really good too, but that lead to a 15 minute discussion about what time of the day one should eat seafood.  But let me move on to the real treat of the meal......since we had four people and no one really wants just pancakes for brunch, we were able to get the banana macadamia nuts for the table after our regular brunch items were done. Incredible!!!  Its one of those things that you just want a few bites of, so having the extra people to split them with was key. For those of your that don't get dessert at brunch, don't knock it till you've tried it.  Being Sunday, we ventured out a bit on the drink menu. C and I got the bloody marys with the beer chaser, I know classy but still good. K and D got some fruity mango champagne drink. I think they were pretty good, but a little sweet. There was one drink really intrigued the table....the ""sneaky pete""!  So being the daring one I order one of those and everyone liked it but having a bartender with us we decided we could make it better. We changed out the spirit for just soda water and that didn't quite work and then figured out that the best combo was half sprite and half soda. So if you get the sneaky pete, go with the half soda half sprite combo. So by this time, meaning our 3rd round, Dale makes the comment ""I want to have brunch with you guys"".

2009-01-05,4.0,Been hearing about this place for a while and I know it's a little pricey so we saved it for NYE and it was soooo worth it!  Ambiance was romantic and cozy.  Had foie gras for the first time...discovered I like it...but I feel guilty about that.  Our server was very helpful and was informative about the dishes and specials.  I was especially impressed that when I made the reservations I told them we had tics for Martyr's at 9pm and they got us out of there in perfect time.  We'll be back for a special occasion or to try a brewmaster's dinner. P.S.  I just realized one would think all I do is go out to eat based on my yelp reviews...I do go to other places...I just tend to yelp only about the food...don't know why...LOL!,0.963,0.816,0.165,0.02,0.5715201465201465

Next, parking was super easy to find on Lincoln and we passed up sola since it's not actually on Lincoln but behind the Chase bank there on the corner.  Service was super friendly and we were seated right away.  I noticed a decent sized group of ten people so it's definitely fit for a group meal, as well.  There were also families there with little kids, as well. The decor and ambiance was warm and cozy.  We watched a little girl point out the fireplace to her father.  Onto the most important part, the food.  As tempted as I was to get the steak and eggs, I withheld and got the egg sandwich which was savory yet light.  It had arugula, bacon, and egg with hash browns on the side.  My husband ordered the black forest omelette which had Gruyere, crispy leeks, black forest ham, and onions in it.  He said that it was so fresh tasting and went down smoothly.  When I went to go sneak in a bite, his food was practically all gone!  Our other friend tried their eggs Benedict which was served on cornbread and super filling and delicious, as well.  I cannot wait to come back here and try their lunch and the truffled Parmesan fries!",0.9974,0.759,0.236,0.005,0.522047152194211
2009-01-02,5.0,"We went to Sola for NYE and were absolutely blown away by the food! Being that I was born and raised in Hawaii, I have pretty high standards for restaurants that claim they serve Hawaiian food, since that typically means they throw pineapple and macadamia nuts on pork and call it authentic. Totally not the case here... We started off with the tuna poke (see photo) that was extremely fresh and tasty.  I had the Tuna that was cooked medium rare with a panko crust, bamboo rice, and tempura avocado. It was like an orgasm in my mouth, all the flavors  and sauces melded together were incredible. My boyfriend had the Wagyu beef, which he said was tender and very flavorful. We ended the meal with the banana split, which sounds pretty boring, but it was refreshing and very unique with a brulee banana, fresh banana ice cream, mac nuts, fudge and crem fresh. We were both in foodie heaven and were totally impressed by the staff, they were friendly and attentive. Even though we were 45 minutes early for our reservations they were more than happy to accomomdate us (even on NYE). I would recommend Sola to anyone who appreciates great seafood and would rank it right up there next to Roys, for a little less money.  *Oh and I forgot to mention the little touches that made our experience extra special: -The lavosh in the breadbasket is superb! -They gave us complimentary salmon appetizers and champagne truffles",0.9959,0.761,0.217,0.022,0.6564790764790766

After reading the Yelpers reviews, always being up for a new dining experience, and not to mention, the perfect ending to a romantic date with my hubby, we were there. Unfortunately, the moment we were seated, it all went downhill from there. The menu is fantastic. I will give Sola that. The bread was good, and the busser (who refilled our water) was on the ball. Our server was cold and seemed like she'd rather be somewhere else, especially when we didn't order wine or cocktails with our meal. I ordered mixed greens to start with, and the dressing was great- a passion fruit vinegarette, but the greens were wilty, and for $6, I was hoping for more than a tiny handful of California greens. But it happens. The entrees were very tasty- hubby ordered the Bacon Prie Fixe, and he enjoyed it. I ordered the 1/2 Chicken, which was very good, although the rice was *really* squishy and overcooked. Our deserts were okay, but nothing memorable, with the exception for the bacon ice cream. My hubby liked it, but the taste of bacon overpowered the bite I tried. So here's my problem with Sola... Not only was the ambience waaaay to stuffy-- I felt uncomfortable my whole dining experience (and I've worked in upscale restaurants- I'm really easy to please), but the service was not good. My hubby went to the bathroom, and when he was gone, the server came by, said ""ugh"" and refolded his napkin on the table. Also, we had a $25 Gift Certificate from  restaurant.com , and they apparently had decided we couldn't use it *after* we were finished eating, and that we should ""come back another day"". Then table next to us, an older and more affluent looking table had a gift cert. as well, and then our server came over and said ""Well, I guess you can use it, but don't go telling any of your friends"". Whatever. At least we could get our check and leave. We paid cash, and left her a good 20+% tip, and she seemed irritated as she took the check from us. No smile, no genuine thank you, nothing. Not a very welcoming experience. So, I'm happy others have enjoyed their Sola experiences, and perhaps we went on an off night, but we won't be back.

Dinner: While it is pricey, the dinner here is totally worth the money. My boyfriend took me here for a special occasion, and it was the perfect spot. The staff was attentive without being overbearing. The artichoke fritter appetizer was surprisingly light, and the accompanying truffle honey was a perfect dip. For my main course, I had a lamb chop special that came with mashed potatoes, carrots, and shaved fennel. The lamb was so tender and juicy, and it was stuffed with the perfect amount of gooey cheese.

First, a public service announcement: if you cannot afford to hire a babysitter, you should not be able to afford a dinner out at SOLA.  Bringing your crying newborns, infants, and toddlers into this restaurant is plainly inconsiderate.  You are a bad parent, and a horrible person. Rug rats notwithstanding, Sola was an excellent experience.  The service was very professional and friendly.  The drinks menu was predictably expensive, but the cocktails were strong and the beer and wine selection was very good. The food was excellent.  The calamari appetizer ($12) was tender and my carnivorous companions seemed to enjoy the pork dumplings ($9).  The two appetizers were enough to whet seven appetites.  For an entree I had the salmon ($27), cooked medium rare and served with an edamame puree.  The edamame was bland but worked well as a dip for the tremendous truffle oil french fries ($8).  One side of fries was more than enough for our party of seven (although I'm sure no one would have complained if there had been more).  I tried a bite of my friend's tuna ($26), which was crusted, pan-seared and served with a buerre blanc sauce.  It was fresh and delicious. It was a beautiful night outside.  Unfortunately for those of us sitting inside the dining room, however, this meant we had to suffer the cost of good weather (flies buzzing around our table) without the benefit of the fresh air.   Although the ambience left a little to be desired, the competence of our servers and the quality of the food warrants four stars.",0.9852,0.734,0.177,0.089,0.598981859410431

I will be back again!  This is definitely up there as one of my new fave restaurants!  :)",0.9993,0.583,0.386,0.03,0.7523262932353842

I enjoyed Sola before I even tasted a bit of food because our wonderful server explained the specials and even recommended a great drink to start (the mai tai was just perfect, not too sweet and a refreshing way to begin our meal).  We had the artichoke fritters with truffle sauce and the bacon pineapple salad to begin (the salad was the best combination of sweet and salty I have ever had - LOVED it...and the fritters, well I think you could give me anything with truffle and I would be happy :) I had the tuna for my entree (excellent clean flavors and I loved the texture contrast between the tuna and the tempura avocado), and the little lady had the stuffed lamb special (I previously thought I hated lamb...as it turns out, I hate all lamb except for Chef Carol's lamb).  We had the truffled fries (incredible) and stir fried veggies for sides.  Everything was fresh, local (yay for dedication to seasonal market fresh produce), and served beautifully. For dessert we had braised pineapple and a s'more type thing - both were delicious and the perfect way to end a perfect dinner out...that is until our waitress brought over two glasses of moscato d'asti and a few chocolates to celebrate our planning a little Hawaiian honeymoon of sorts - talk about getting ready for the islands!

2008-07-11,4.0,"I feel renewed after reading a thread where people brought up reasons to review a place even if it has a bazillion reviews already... so here goes.   The staff at sola is extremely polite and impressively knowledgeable.  I really appreciate that our server took the time to explain every dish and answer all our questions.  I am mentioning this specifically due to the fact that my husband and I both have baby faces and look like we are approximately 17 and therefore are not always given the best service ever especially at nice places... Just because we look young doesn't mean we don't have jobs, yo!! (end rant).  I have been to sola twice, but once was yesterday, so I remember than one better, okay???  We ended up going with the parmesan truffle fries to start with.  I am not a big cheese fan, but these were go-oooo-ood.  Salty, like regular fries but with a special sumthin' sumthin' underneath that flavor.  I really hate to say this, but I think they would be bitch'n with Katsup.  (did not have the balls to ask for it).  One last thing about the fries is a warning for those of you that get hungry before your entree and just want to munch - the fry order is large.  I think we would have been much more content-feeling after our meals had we not eaten so many of these fries.  We only finished about half, too.  Just saying.  I also recall that had the gnocchi last time...and were not too too impressed.  They were really little and not too exciting.   Alrighty - I had the tuna which has some sort of panko-mustard crust.  The ""crust"" was not ""crunchy"" but it tasted damn good.  The tuna was cooked rare/med-rare and was awesome.  My husband got the washu beef special and I think he may have died and gone to heaven for a moment there.   We did not get dessert, because were just weren't feeling any of the listed desserts and to be honest, I just wanted a Susie's choc-marshmallow shake after all that.  (Okay - the katsup and susie's refs may not be making me look too mature after all :)   A few quick notes about drinks, though I know this is long... The first time I went I got a really fab, strong, well mixed cocktail, yum!  The second time, however, somehow we got persuaded to get a half-bottle of wine.  I'm gonna say it - I don't think half bottles are worth it.  I feel like each of us got 1 glass of wine out of the deal, and while the wine was quite a nice Zin which we couldn't have gotten by the glass, still felt like a raw deal for me.  I may have rather done 2 different wines by the glass, or maybe cocktails.  Lastly, the first time I went I saw Dale from top chef, and the second time I went I saw Linda Yu from, you know, the news...  I wonder who I'll see next time dining at Sola!",0.9948,0.792,0.153,0.055,0.4731144688644689
2008-07-10,3.0,"Does Chicago know that Dale from Top Chef works here?!  Yes, we were served by Dale.  Good marketing keeping him out front for all to see.   Stopped in the other night for a birthday dinner with family, headed there on a Wednesday evening and it just so happened they offered a prix fix (3 course) for the evening, $30. Half of us were able to take part in the prix fix while the others were left to pick and choose.  An 8pm reservation and the prix fix was nearly sold out. (Outside seating is first come basis)  Plating and garnishing was excellent.  One of the servers a tall, dark haired dude that brought many of the dishes was very elegant in the way that he laid the plates, I've never seen a tall guy so graceful, I think he was posing as he did it.  In between courses I'm wondering where Dale is, my freakin' cocktail has expired and I need a refill man!  Thank goodness the runner was refilling the water often.  I think when you're spending money ($$$) on a meal, I'm talking over the normal standards; you should get a higher level of service or regard from the waiters.  Right?  Like when the plate is served, some detail or gesture from the server like ""buon appetite"" or some sh*t. It shouldn't just be placed and then dude takes off.  I've gotten friendlier service at Golden Nugget, now those ladies work for their tip and they don't forget to refill the glass.   More on the food: The pom fritte fries were awesome.  Why is it so faux pas to ask for ketchup, I mean I gotta have it! Since it wasn't my birthday, I skipped the ketchup and sat on silent protest. The calamari was good although the spicy aioli sauce on the side was hardly spicy, terribly bland and tasteless. When it comes down to the entree I've let go of my strict standards of cooking and now allowed these popular restaurants to just serve it and deal with what I get.  (WTF is it such a big deal anyway if I want my meat cooked fully?)  The lamb (slightly pink) and the sea bass were perfect.  My short rib was overcooked and dry; it sat on thinly sliced carrots and garnish.  A very light Hoisin sauce encompassed the meat; just a bit more would've really helped that meal.  Another cocktail would've really helped as well!  The duck breast was severely undercooked, I can't even bare to get a bite in when the meat is red, people eat bird rare / medium rare? Blah.  The wait from the appetizer to the entree and then the desserts was hella long.  Bring good company and get a smaller table, its easy for people to feel left out.  There wasn't any music in the background so there isn't much people noise.  Divine desserts that must be tried? All of'em.    FYI, dress is casual.  Like, nice clothing casual. Want to save a few bucks?  1) hit the Prix fix, they have two nights that it's offered. 2)  restaurant.com   They may still have a few gift certificates available. ******** I was just re-thinking the night I was here last and talked about it with family, whom I ate with.  I'd forgotten many details when writing my original review.  There were blatant grievances with service and just stupidity.  The food by itself was great.  But the customer / service moments were failures.  It wasn't a good experience, it was just food in a decent diner.  Forgetting to ask if a table needs drinks refreshed, new cocktails, any additionals; is just incomplete customer service.  I remember thinking that day, I have a gift certificate to this place, I don't know if I want to use it.  Maybe I can give it away.   It was busy, but not terribly busy.  In the end, its your server / waiter that needs to be paying attention.  When they have staff helping them with the serving and refills, what are they doing for us now? What's got them so busy?  When it came time to tip, I was bothered.  Not knowing who all benefits from the tip, (waiter sharing with the other staff) I don't want to short those that did a good job.   We over tipped, but even today, I think it was too much.   I'm on the fence on whether this was a 2 star or 3 star experience.",0.9916,0.862,0.107,0.031,0.512175675404842

I started out with the pork cheeks special appetizer which was unbelievably good followed by the spare ribs that were unfortunately a bit overcooked. The flavor profiles of these two dishes were amazing and the infusion of Hawaiian/Asian cuisine into modern American food really creates something that I've not been served at too many other restaurants. Now for the crowd. I came with 6 of my closest friends, we were drinking and some of us had been drinking prior to making our entrance into Sola. It was my birthday, so getting tipsy on a Wednesday night seemed like a viable dinner activity. But, putting together alcohol and 7 very good friends can sort of bring up the volume at the table to levels that maybe wouldn't be appreciated by the other patrons at the restaurant. We were given dirty looks by everyone who was eating there for just having a little bit of fun as opposed to sitting quietly and eating. Our waitress catered to our every need and she definitely deserved the large tip that we gave her.

They keep the menu simple, yet not with ingredients, but with choices. Not overdone, just great combinations with an Asian contemporary twist. When you go here, get at least a four choice meal...appetizers, salad, entree, and dessert. It's worth doing a tour of the entire menu. During the Summer, they have a beet salad that is so amazing! Try the Tuna Entree and Short Ribs too. They also have daily specials, which are always good.

Parmesan truffle fries: also fantastic and full of truffly goodness. I ordered the salmon entree and loved it and I never like fish that's been cooked.  Disclaimer: I ordered the salmon super extra rare.  It comes medium rare by default.  The edamame puree underneath it and a teriyaki truffle sauce over the top were both pretty and unique and wonderful. My sexy date had the braised short ribs which were also great but closely guarded.  We finished with the ice cream trio/sampler/flight contraption.  The waitress listed off a dozen options and we picked three at random that were all good on their own but could have been better matched with the others had we had a list of some sort.

For my appetizer, I had the artichoke fritters with a honey truffle dipping sauce and a soy, lime, chili dipping sauce.  They were delicious.  B had quail tempura, which he really enjoyed.  For my entree, I had salmon with a truffle teriyaki sauce, edamame puree, and tempura green beans.  B had hoisin mustard panko-crusted tuna with bamboo rice and tempura avocado.  He loved it, and mine was really good as well. For dessert, we had chocolate cake with a soft center, sesame brittle ice cream, and vanilla wasabi sauce.  It was really, really good.  The bitterness of the chocolate cake and the sweetness of the ice cream was perfectly balanced.  Really, really good.

After being seated at what was a truly uncomfortable, cramped, and jacked up table, the intrepid hostess promptly reseated us in a much better corner by the front windows.  Boo for the jacked up table, hooray for the intrepid hostess! The menu, which is influenced by seasonal, local, and Hawaiian/ Asian flavors, covers a range of vegan options to full-on red meat entrees, which made my mixed group of vegetarians and unrepentant meat-eaters very happy. We ordered a varied lot of options, including the vegan soup of the day and the greens and grains meal.  Everything was flavorful and rich, and obviously very fresh.  The portions admittedly look small, but the dishes themselves are so hearty that everyone left feeling full. Desserts were very tasty -- the banana/mango/coconut concoction was very original, but the little apple tart with macadamia nut ice cream and flaky crust was without question the winner. Solid service and NO MUSIC also made the whole experience really topnotch.  Blessed silence!

Then the mahi mahi and lobster risotto. For dessert, warm chocolate cake and banana ice cream sundae.  The artichoke fritters were delicate and yummy. I didn't think the sauces did much for the fritters.  The gnocchi, was an extremely tiny portion for the price.  The mahi mahi, was the best part of the dinner. The fish was flaky and tender.  The lobster risotto had no bite to the risotto and the flavor was not very rich. It also wasn't creamy enough.  The desserts were pretty good though.  Overall I was just surprised at the cost and portion size of the selections. It was pretty ironic considering the tables were covered with a big sheet of brown paper.

Our coats were taken, we were seated promptly and the restaurant gave a cheerful, sunny vibe to start our meal and day. Everything about this restaurant is very clean - from the tablesettings, decor, style and presentation of our dishes. It's what I expected after having one of their very own became a celebrity through Bravo's Top Chef reality tv show. For our meal, we started off with... Coffee & Blood Orange hot tea. I liked their coffee (then again, I'll take any caffiene I can get in the morning) while my companions raved about their tea.  Malasadas ($7) - which are portuguese style donuts that came with a mango curd and raspberry coulis for dipping. My companions preferred the mango curd while I opted for the raspberry coulis. The only critique I have is that they should consider serving the curd & coulis in larger dipping bowls for the malasadas to fit in. The donuts were a little to big to achieve a perfect ""dunk"" into the sweet sauces. My husband ordered the steak & eggs.... and that was done nicely. The thickness of the steak wasn't too thin, just perfect for a brunch serving. My friend ordered the pineapply upside down french toast... and it was heavenly. The dish was extremely rich, especially with the mango curd, tropical fruits and creme anglaise that accompanied it. She barely finished half so if you decide to order this, you may want to consider asking for a half order or splitting it with a friend. I ordered their savory chilaquiles... tortilla hash, scrambled eggs, guacamole, pico de gallo and sour cream. A nice smoky hint of chorizo was mixed in somewhere and it definitely was filling. The only thing I would have preferred is that it be served on a plate, rather than a square bowl. I thought it was a bit odd, but having all the components of the toppings presented more clearly, rather than just plopped on would have made a nicer presentation of the dish. Nonetheless, it was a great meal to start the day. I would recommend this place for brunch!",0.9917,0.852,0.144,0.004,0.6078104575163398

It has star anise floating in it, it HAS to be good. Anyhow, the first time I ate at Sola was just 3 weeks ago. 2 of my co-workers and I went there for a team dinner.  For appetizers, we ordered the blue cheese fritters and the Gnocchi. The fritters were pretty darn good. I was hoping for more of a blue cheese flavor, but they were good nonetheless. (I'm a stinky cheese freak.) The Gnocchi, on the other hand was out of this world. For my entree I ordered the pulled pork. I'm not a huge meat eater, but for some reason this sounded really really good that night. And, boy, was I right! The meat was so tender and tasty. I finished the whole thing and almost licked the plate clean. My co-worker got the scallops, and after tasting hers I wished I'd ordered that! Everything was so incredibly good. The only reason I give 4 stars instead of 5 is the price. It's not as expensive as I thought it would be, but I was a little surprised at the portion size in comparison to the price. I'd been there lots of times prior, and eventhough I didn't eat the food, I was still eye-balling everyone's plates in the place. The portions seem to have gotten considerably smaller.

2008-03-18,4.0,"Fiancee and I have been looking forward to Sola for quite a while, but every time it came up as an option, it was too late to get a reservation.  I think I booked this one a good 4 weeks in advance.  Went last Friday night, 8pm.  Fiancee and one other friend who was in town visiting. The Space: The atmosphere is pretty swanky and cool.  It did get a litlte loud, but that's not unique in this town.  The light fixtures are pretty cool, but my friend commented that there were too many of them, and I agree.  In all, the place looks cooler from the outside than the inside. The Service:  The waitress was great.  There were 7 different specials (we counted) to remember, and she knew them backwards and forwards.  We could tell she knew them because she loves food, but because of rote memorization.  The best part of the service is the ""Muse"" delivery guy.  How do I get that job?  We saw him once all night.  He told us that ""tonight's muse is made of carrots....etc.""  Where do you put ""muse delivery guy"" on a resume?  But I digress. The food: For me, this place is all about the food, and it came through in a big way.  We had a special appetizer of duck breast and root veggies with micro-greens and a vinegarette.  Delicious in a curious way.  Some of the flavors we had a hard time identifying, but they were great nonetheless.  I had the short rib.  I had been looking forward to it for quite a while, and the flavor is fantastic.  It comes with a soy based sauce, which is unique compared to other short ribs that tend to come in beef gravies or with latin american flavors.  There was also a perfectly ratio-ed taste of citrus fruit in the sauce that keeps you guessing and makes the heavy dish almost refreshing.  The thing was fork tender, which is expected with a braised short rib.  I didn't care too much for the veggies in the presentation.  For me, they were a little heavy on the shittake mushroom flavor.  I couldn't taste any other vegetable flavor.  They were cooked well, and the pea pods and green beans had a nice pop to them, but the flavor seemed to be hidden behind the shittakes, which was strong for me.  Fiancee's tuna was top notch.  She was practically licking the plate by the end of the night.  I'm not much of a tuna guy, but I tasted it, and it did melt in your mouth.  Friend had the pork tenderloin.  I'll just come out and say it...I'm afraid of pink pork.  The serving came out nothing past rare.  I've seen pork cooked medium and medium well, and been okay with it.  But this looked like it was about to ""oink.""  He gave me a taste, which luckily came from the outside and was at least seared, and the flavors were very nice.  I would probably have asked them to cook it further and been fine.  He didn't complain, so maybe it's just me. Summary:  In all, this is a very nice place that is certainly worth trying.  I'm not sure it's going to be our special occasion place, but we may come back if friends suggest it or want to go there.  For the same price point, I'd probably go back to Chalkboard before I went back to Sola.  But we didn't try the desserts, which might have changed my view.",0.9991,0.785,0.201,0.013,0.5371441169060215

2008-02-21,5.0,"I'm glad I get to jump the gun and review the Sola Prix Fixe 3-course meal featuring Bacon before the big Yelp group heads out to get their fix tonight.  I went to Sola for the first time last night with 3 girlfriends. We were tempted by the $30 Bacon extravaganza special since Sola has been on our 'places to try' list forever; I'm glad our common love of all things bacon finally got us in the door. We were seated by the window where we could admire the total lunar eclipse outside and the rows of pretty illuminated lanterns inside. Other than the lighting, Sola's decor is warm and sophisticated with what appeared (at least on a Wednesday) to be a more mature crowd enjoying the Asian and Hawaiian inspired menu.  After the menus were brought to us and we ordered a few bottles of wine from a nice selection, 2 of my girls immediately decided to depart from the Bacon plan and go with other items too tempting to pass up. Before we get to those however let me give you the breakdown on the bacon offering and what I had:  1ST COURSE - Bacon & Grilled Pineapple Salad; pineapple, rosemary, black vinegar, pineapple coulis This salad was the perfect starter... amazing flavor and a nice balance of salty and sweet, neither were too overpowering and the rosemary was a really interesting and tasty addition.   2ND COURSE - Bacon Wrapped Pork Tenderloin; Hawaiian sweet potato puree, Chinese broccoli, Sczechwan peppercorn jus Typically I don't really enjoy bacon wrapped meats... in theory it sounds great, but the bacon is never really crispy enough and ends up sitting in a fatty pile off to the side of my plate. Not at Sola my friend!! They found a way to cook the pork to keep it juicy and still crisp up the bacon enough so that you can really enjoy it and it's not just used to flavor the meat. Dipping it in the sweet potato puree was divine!! The chinese broccoli was OK, but I found it to be a bit tough and difficult to cut.  3RD COURSE - Taffy Apple Pie with Bacon Brittle Ice Cream; apple cider five spice syrup So this dessert was exactly as amazing as it sounds. Bacon brittle ice cream brings two of the best things in the world (Ice Cream and Bacon) together and uses it to top a warm gooey caramel apple tart to make a sinful treat that is so good it will leave you speechless. Of the 3 courses, this was the only item I noticed is not on their regular menu but definitely should be, hopefully after bacon week it will be a new addition.  We also ordered their Mashed Potatoes and Mac 'n Cheese as sides to share... skip the Mash, it was a bit dry and could have used some zing and pizzaz. The M'nC however was delish and super creamy, it's just one of those guilty pleasures impossible for me to pass up.  So my friends who departed from Bacon Party USA ordered up the Crabcakes and the Salmon. The crabcakes were crabcakes...sorry I'm a bit biased here because I always think it's the most boring thing to order on a menu. Just not very adventurous, ya know? She said they were great, so there you have it. The Salmon was AMAZING... I could smell it's truffle broth the second I walked into Sola and the edamame puree was light and surprisingly flavorful. This is a must have for the next time.  Our server was a total doll and knew her stuff really well... we even bantered a bit about Hot Doug's before she encouraged us to come back for their brunch and try the pineapple upside down french toast and blood orange mimosas. HA, I bet they have bacon too (just call me Dr. Obvious)!!

The room was bright and airy, without being a hit-you-over-the-head sensory assault. Great way to start a weekend meal. Service was attentive and unobtrusive at once, made us feel very relaxed.  There were four of us, and we started off with some good morning cocktails, although the bloody mary was a true standout. Once the food arrived, though, I forgot all about my red dawn mimosa. The pineapple upside down french toast is simply heaven on a plate. Absolutely the best french toast I've had, and I've had plenty! Bread was so light, the sweetness wasn't overwhelming, and it was the perfect combination of flavors - pineapple, rum, and vanilla creme anglaise...yum! My husband loved his huevos benedictos, and sola's omelettes were a big hit with our friends as well. It's a little more than we usually spend on brunch, but worth every cent. Can't wait to come back here for dinner! Part 2 - Dinner Finally made it back here for dinner, and it was spectacular. The drinks were fab - black cherry soda anyone? The appetizers outdid themselves - the blue cheese fritters and sea green salad were both great, and the waitress brought out a complimentary plate of the gnocchi too, which turned out to be wonderful as well.

Overall, it was wonderful experience and I loved the sleek clean look of the restaurant.  It definitely allows patrons to focus more on the food.  I think.  It was just too bad about the short ribs and occasionally our server would forget what oil was in a dish and what the sorbet of the day was.  Not a huge deal but, I tend to over-analyze at times.  I will be back though.  I'm curious about there upcoming wine tasting.",0.9975,0.775,0.178,0.048,0.5941274170274172

They've got a great wine list with some very good selections by the glass, as well as generous pours.  Our server was attentive, friendly, and informative.  Bussing staff and runners were also professional and friendly.

Finishing up a solid meal we had the banana and nutella ""egg roll"" which was as decadent as it sounds - delicious.  The insides were molten hot, though, which is about the only complaint I can find with the entire meal.

We were about 20 minutes late for our reservation, because the weather was miserable that night. But we were seated right away, much to my surprise. The atmosphere was nice, though I do think that they tried to cram a few too many tables in the space. We might as well have been at the same table as our neighbors, as we eyed each others' food and my table cautiously eavesdropped on their awkward date.  Appetizers and desserts were excellent. Entrees were well done, but my male friends were a little concerned about their size (or lack thereof). By the time we had wrapped up dessert, we were cutting it close to the time that we were supposed to be elsewhere, so I asked the waiter to bring the check after we put in our dessert order. He didn't, so we asked again as we were finishing our desserts and it took at least another 15 minutes. We had let him know at the beginning of the meal that we had somewhere to be, so his lack of promptness was a little disappointing.

FOOD Qual Tempura was well worth the trip.  Though serving them bone-in forced me to eat with my fingers.  My wife's soup of the day was splendid, and her short ribs were fantastic.  The lamb special was not satisfactory, being void of flavor and of fatty texture.  For dessert, the best chocolate cake I've ever had. SERVICE The waitstaff (despite the overcasual uniforms) have an encyclopedic knowledge of the menu.  If I didn't know better, I'd say they were cooking it themselves.  Friendly, knowledgeable, accomodating, fast, and of good taste.

All 5 of us had different entrees, and all 5 of us were extremely happy with our choices....That is a rarity for all five of us to try every single entree and love them all.

My meal was slightly overshadowed by my favorite dish, my sister's braised short ribs. They were pulled off the bone and rolled up into one huge log-like structure. I know that's not too appetizing of a description, but the meat was so incredibly tender you could cut it with the edge of your fork. Above and beyond, amazing.

Truffle Parmesan cheese fries and the Mac & Cheese are playfully presented, but have bold flavors that give them grown up tastes.  Just an overall unbelievable meal last night.

Once I finally found the place (it is just me or is it not actually on Lincoln?), I settled in and was surprised at how much bigger it was than I expected. We took a long time with our menus but it worked because the restaurant was busy on a Thursday night. We went through the appetizer list, eliminating things based on what we were planning to order for dinner, and ended up selecting the potstickers. They were great, and how often do you say that about potstickers? For entrees, my friends chose the tuna (our server's favorite) and the lamb chop special stuffed with Cambozola cheese. I ordered the scallops, but unfortunately they'd run out so I had to substitute with the pork tenderloin special. Our server was extremely accommodating while I chose again, and even helped me select a substitute side dish. Not one of the entrees disappointed. I never order tuna as an entree (too much rare tuna is overwhelming to me) but I would go back and order this one in a second. The panko-mustard crust around it was amazing. The lamb chops were also rich and heavenly. And my pork tenderloin (wrapped in bacon, hello!!) was I think the most juicy and tender I've ever had. Somehow we ended up ordering 3 desserts (something with apples, a panna cotta and a creme brulee). The (chocolate hazelnut?) creme brulee was huge and the hands-down favorite. PLUS they also brought out a chocolate truffle plate with ""happy birthday"" written on it, such a nice touch. I think we were the last table to leave and still we never felt rushed.

First off, if you can get a seat on the patio, it is an absolutely gorgeous setting when the weather is nice.  It's well shaded, and just off the corner of Lincoln.  It's calm and serene, but with the buzz of the busy street just a bit away.  And getting a seat has not seemed to be a problem.  The two times I've visited have been at the height of regular Sunday brunch rush, and we had zero wait.  That point alone makes it a great brunch find.  But I haven't even arrived at the best part... The food at Sola is mouth-wateringly delicious.  I'm salivating right now just thinking about it.  They serve little donuts with fruit dipping sauce you can get as an appetizer (terribly located on the menu, so be sure to ask) that are little balls of heaven.  I'm pretty sure I could get two orders of these for my meal, but then I couldn't get the Huevos Benedictos.  Now that would be a shame.  The Huevos Bendictos is pretty much a tex-mex version of Eggs Benedict, swapping out the ham and muffin for corn bread and chorizo.  It's even better than it sounds - trust me!  The service is on par with the food.

The four of us enjoyed some flavorful pot stickers and a fantastic squash blossom appetizer with a bright cilantro sauce--very tasty and surprisingly light; a nice way to whet the appetite. The entrees were so enjoyed that no one was willing to share--a rarity for our group, indeed.  My 4 wasabi-crusted scallops were enormous and delicious, prepared perfectly and immensely enjoyed--I even enjoyed the micro greens with enoki mushrooms and I am not a fungi kind of girl.  Other entrees at the table included the flat iron steak and the striped bass and lamb specials, all which received rave reviews (although I heard the lamb was especially rich, stuffed with a yummy cambozola cheese as it was, but again, I didn't see anyone offering any samples from their plates).  The heirloom tomato salad was scrumptious and the checkerboard beet salad artfully presented (not such a fan of beets, myself, but they sure looked pretty!).  Dessert was not quite as orgasmic as I'd expected--the baked haleakala's chocolate cake was good, but nothing particularly amazing and the salted caramel ice cream is second to that at Hot Chocolate, but I did enjoy the toasted marshmallow flavors of the meringue.  Next time I think I'd try the banana ice cream hot fudge sundae... Cocktails were very well-made and our server was fantastic--very attentive and kind, never obtrusive or rushed, and she made wonderful wine suggestions. I would say sola is on the pricey side, so it won't be my typical go-to for regular dinners out, but then again, it's not a ""regular"" type of place.  It's much more special than that, so I would recommend it for a lovely date, special occasion or splurge with friends.  I can't stop thinking about those scallops, so I'll have to make up some special occasion soon so I can go back again.  :)  4.5 stars and a very happy birthday girl.",0.9976,0.748,0.236,0.016,0.6568226834893502

We gorged ourselves on the bread basket enough so we actually skipped an appetizer, a rarity for us.  They had pretzel rolls!  Yum!  I ordered the special Hawaiian sea bass with veggies, basil risotto and the most amazing light lemony sauce.  It was seriously amazing.  My husband had the special cheese stuffed lamb chops.  He loved it too.  Of course, i barely got a bite of that since he inhaled it.   We also shared a side of those parmesan encrusted truffle fries.  Frankly, I was rather disappointed in them.  The fries were flavored a little on the salty side and also a bit soggy.   Who wants a soggy fry even if it is truffle encrusted?  Try sweets and savories truffle fries instead.  They're much much better and served with fig ketchup.  I didn't even want dessert because i was so full, but since when has that ever stopped me?  We shared the baked alaska type dish.  It was amazing!  It was this chocalate cake covered with salted caramel ice cream and burnt meringue.  Try it!   We waddled home afterward and promptly fell asleep on the couch due to a food coma.  Bliss!",0.9888,0.831,0.147,0.022,0.5220238095238096

We were a party of 7 or 8 on a Saturday night and didn't have to wait at all to be seated. Anyway, most of us began with salad. I got the beets one and others tried the pears one. We also all shared potstickers. For dinner I got the beef tenderloin and my sharing companion got the halibut. They surprised me with a chocolate dessert dish that spelled out Happy Birthday and it was really rich and tasty. Oh! Several of us ordered the truffle parmesan fries and then proceeded to make fools of ourselves fighting to lick the crumbs. No, I am not kidding. They are a gluttonous must-order IMHO. Also: they seated us as we arrived. None of that annoying ""wait until the rest"" arrive crap.

2007-07-19,5.0,"The kids are away so the wife and I treated ourselves to Sola last night. Wife had the miso black cod. It was so delicious that she actually refused to share a single bite with me. It's served with ""forbidden black rice."" That sounds kind of racy doesn't it? Well up until the rice part perhaps. SAT style analogy: deleece/salmon, sola/cod. Signature fish dishes for a thousand Alex. I had one of their three specials, a 12 oz. ribeye steak with corn / mushroom hash and broccoli rabe. Like everyone else (according to the waitress) I ordered mine M/MR; it arrived still pretty red in the center but with a nice char outside. My cut was very tender. The sauce was rich and heady but I am too embarassed at the poverty of my ability to accurately invoke the flavor to even make the attempt. The steak was so large and the flavor so rich and indulgent that I decided at first bite to save enough for the next day so as not to overwhelm my peasantlike capacity to appreciate the experience. In fact I just finished the leftover portion at my desk so I am a little intoxicated again. Wow that's good. OK I'll try to compose myself so you can decide what to order. There is a $29 beef tenderloin entree on their regular menu that the waitress thought was in fact better than my special ribeye. That's better among equals, like in the tour de france when one rider actually wins the final sprint, but there were five riders in contention, and they all get the same finish time, and they are all fantastically gifted and worthy of the win. Thank you very much. You might also want to try the spareribs. I heard they are amazing, I just couldn't order a prole cut of meat at a posh resto like this. They had a lamb chop special too but as they were stuffed with very rich french cheeses, it sounded a bit much on a dark and stormy summer night. But undoubtedly excellent. We noshed on an order of their truffle Parmesan fries for openers. It arrived in a wax paper cone upright in a fountain milkshake schooner. Delicious of course but let's explore the broader context a bit. I thought it was a bit of a dirty trick on the chef's part to offer such a pandering side dish. Who doesn't love fresh cut fries? Cheddar shmeddar, let's put parmesan on 'em! Ooh, truffle oil too! Maybe she was stoned when she dreamt this one up. Eating the fries made me feel desperate and I ended up matching the wife 2 for 1 on these. This made my side of the conversation a little clumsy and awkward at times but fortunately there were no major bite wounds on my fingers afterwards. Yes I'd go back just for the fries. Just need to calm down a bit. Lots of girlie cocktails on their drink card but we flipped that over and opted for some nice american microbrews. I had Bitter End, a satisfying IPA. Apologies for sounding negative here but why are you other yelpers going tentpole on mac and cheese? And breadbaskets? Had a side of mixed beans. Very crisp, again with the rich dressing. Service was good. Decor pleasant. Good sound system and choice of music. The meal left us very satisfied. We skipped dessert but had a few cups of their good coffee.

2007-07-11,5.0,"One of the best restaurants in the city. Every time I have come here, the experience is authentic and consistent, which goes a long way in my book. Carol Wallack used to be the personal chef for Jack Nicholson, so we say if it's good enough for Jack, it's good enough for us. She also used to live in Hawaii, and the menu is bent that way. The room is open, with a bar to the left and a 2 level dining room. There's a large 2 sided fireplace by the host desk, surrounded by an exotic looking wood. The color scheme is very natural and clean. In the summer they greatly expand their capacity by offering outdoor seating. Started out with an inventive well-blended drink from their cocktail menu. Refreshing. The basket with a variety of breads, cracker-like flatbreads and butter was first very satisfying, and made us hungry for more. We started with the endive salad with pear, and the heirloom tomato salad, simply dressed with microgreens and a shave of manchego cheese. Fresh and tasty. For entrees, we had lamb chops (perfectly cooked, stuffed with bleu cheese, and served with sesame spinach), the seared panko-crusted tuna (cooked rare and served with fried avocado and bamboo rice), and the braised shortrib (with hoisin and mixed veggies). Absolutely terrific. Everything is presented proudly and simply on oversized white china. We also ordered sides of truffle fries and mac and cheese for the table, and killed those too. Desserts are spectacular. Banana cream pie tartlettes, thai coffee creme brulee, baked haleakala and a hot fudge sundae with banana ice cream and macadamia nuts. Carol does the desserts too, which is quite astounding, given that places of this caliber frequently have separate pastry chefs. Portions are generous, service is smooth and attentive, and staff is friendly and knowledgable. Total for four people with tax, tip and booze was about $220. It's a fabulous place.

2007-06-18,4.0,"Great place for a first date, girls' dinner, or a grown-ups meal.  I wouldn't really recommend for families or children.  Not only did I not see any children, I didn't really see anything on the menu for them nor did I see any high-chairs or the sort.   My BF and I visited Sola this past weekend.  Sola is located near Byron and Lincoln - although it has a Lincoln Avenue address, it is actually more solidly on Byron Street.  It has ample outdoor seating, and a relatively spacious indoor dining area.  The decor is contemporary, Zen-like, and simple with its boxy-square theme (the menus are square, the plates are square, etc.).   The place was a tiny bit more upscale than casual (you might feel a tad bit out of place if you wear shorts or ripped jeans), but I did see a couple of people in shorts (who  looked outta place).  There is a lovely little bar area.  We were a tad bit early, but we were not seated until 10-15 minutes after our reservation's time.  Oh well, we enjoyed a drink at the bar.  Unfortunately the hostess sat us at a table right next to the fireplace at a table that I felt was ""hidden"" from view.  Plus, the smell of gas emanating from the fireplace was a little troubling.  I was ready to pull a Smokey the Bear routine and tackle anyone who was going to try to smoke near us.   Sure enough, our table location proved to be a problem as we received verrrrrry slow and forgetful service.  Our server didn't come by for about 35 minutes after we sat down.  Our drinks didn't appear until 20 minutes later.  I think we saw our server a total of 2 times.  Other servers brought our meals out, refreshed our drinks, and brought us our bill.  They forgot one of our dishes.  Our server showed up towards the end of our meal to ask us how the food was.  My BF was a little upset that I left a 15% tip (I usually tip 20-25%) and thought I should have left 10% to send a stronger message.  Although I felt that the sh*tty service primarily resulted from placement at such an odd location (like they shoved a table into this small space just to have another table), my BF is probably right that this reason didn't justify the bad service. The food was amazing!  Kudos to the chef.  Sola presents American contemporary cuisine with a pan-Asian twist.  The tuna was perfectly cooked with just enough flavor - I usually lament about seared tuna entrees as having either too much or too bland sauce, but Sola does it just right.  Tuna melted like butta in my mouth.  My BF's flat iron steak was soft and tender as well, cooked to perfection.  Our plates were nearly licked clean!  We also ordered mac-n-cheese, but they had forgotten to bring the dish out and by the time they did, it was soupy and a little bit undercooked.   Finally, don't overlook dessert!  I had a hard time deciding between the Thai iced coffee creme brulee, the banana cream pie and the chocolate cake, but we went with the chocolate cake dessert.  We were not disappointed, although it was a tad bit tiny for 2 people.  They have a decent selection of port/dessert wines, too.

The menu was impressive looking.  I thought the choices were different and really exciting.  The food, however, was not in reality very different or exciting.  I really enjoyed the malasadas (sp?) that we had as an appetizer (if you can have an appetizer for breakfast) -- donuty things that tasted sort of like begnets (sp?) from New Orleans, though they had a different texture than those.  My potato pie thing was okay and my mom's french toast was tasty, but not amazing.  My husband had the huevos benedictos, which had meat so I didn't try it, was very good.  So, we had mixed experiences with our food. Our waiter was terrible.  He was not snotty or offensive, but he was perhaps just too young and inexperienced.  When he brought us the malasadas, he did not bring us plates, which was ridiculous, since they were very messy.  When I asked for plates, he acted a little like it was a strange request.  He never really checked in to see if every thing was okay.  He was just bad at his job, unfortunately -- though the bus staff was great. In all, I think the best part of the meal was the Mother's Day cookies that they sent us home with.  They were yummy!  I don't think I'd ever really seek out Sola again, but I wouldn't avoid it either.  I might try it for dinner some time to see if my theory about time of day affecting one's enjoyment of the restaurant stands.  It was a fairly disappointing experience since I was aiming for something special for Mother's Day.",0.9946,0.744,0.188,0.069,0.5957612712490761

The menu was fairly limited, but I still had a bit of trouble settling on an entree because they all sounded so good. Creative without getting too esoteric and, as it turned out, prepared perfectly. The portions were perfect, too. I just managed to eat all of my dinner. I have to agree with Courtney about the noise, too, though I am not sure how the food could be ""too flavored"" unless that means over-salted or something.

2006-12-28,3.0,"While I am delighted that haute cuisine is manifest destinying northward, I need more than proximity to the hood to return to Sola.  Sola's decor leans toward mod with clean lines and patterned booths.  Yet, its modernistic tones tandem with little comfort in seating.  The setting is, however, intimate, and the tables spaced enough to engender casual or romantic interludes.  On this particular night, it was packed, yet unintrusive.  We initially sidled up to the bar while awaiting our table.  The bartender and wait staff were efficient and friendly.  The bartender pointed us to wines by the glass and the omnipresent flavored martini list. While both seemed appealing, they connote an identity tension with what will please the bar crowd in the hood and what will match the menu with thought.   The menu at Sola leans toward Thai fusion with a touch of French and American influence.  The flavors strive to be big, but the execution missed.  We began with artichoke fritters that were both overdone and overbreaded.  While I was looking for a tempura-esque preparation that would allow me to taste an artichoke, I was slammed with cornmeal and pepper that would be better suited to a fried meat or fish.   We next tried salads, and the sea greens salad is a standout.   We proceeded to a pumpkin seed encursted mahi mahi and a venison tenderloin that were good, and are both best described as solid.  The mahi crust was tasty and the fish properly meaty without being overdone.  But the combination of flavors was difficult to discern from a nut or bread crust cooked under high heat.  The venison was, as the mahi, good, but the bacon wrapped around it lacked both crispness and saltiness that would have better complimented the rare and brilliantly gamey venison loin.   My compliments, however, to the vendor that provided the venison, its consistency, presentation and inherent flavor were spot on.     The wait staff was a bit laid back, a little too much so.  Our waiter did not know much about the menu beyond the specials he had memorized, could not answer wine questions, and was unfamiliar with what after-dinner drinks the bar stocked.  He was equally somewhat tired in his service and had mentioned more than once that he was quite exhausted.  I was too, after a long day of work, but I didn't mention that to him.... For the cost of admission, we were looking for more than solid from Sola.  With tax and tip, and a bottle of wine, we left with a 180 bill.  I have no compunction about paying that to dine, but it simply was not worth it just to be able to walk down the street and back . Moreover, I don't need to ever notice that I am eating with IKEA flatware while I am settling that bill.  Sola is an interesting entre' into a neighborhood that is sorely lacking in restaurants of its type.  It had its high notes, but, I can say little more than it was interestingly unremarkable.  I doubt we will return knowing that two Sola visits would equal one visit to Arun's.",0.9879,0.846,0.11,0.044,0.4127653283535636

The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful and the service was great from the minute we walked in.  The drink menu alone got me excited and I especially enjoyed one of their specialties of black cherry effen and cream soda (my 2 favorite drinks combined).  We started with the lobster shitake dumplings (yum!) and then moved on to our entrees.  My friend and I shared the miso cod and the seared scallops. Both were unbelievable, but I preferred the scallops, which worked out well since my friend was all about the cod.  The other people at our table were also quite delighted with the tuna and shitake pad thai. The dumplings, delicious bread basket, and entrees would have been more than enough for us, but we still felt the need to go to town on the sides.  How could we possibly say no to truffle Parmesan french fries and mac & cheese.  The fries were especially good...I was so full, but even thought about loosening my belt just to make room for more fries. Sola is by no means inexpensive, but I found it to be reasonable for the quality of the food.
