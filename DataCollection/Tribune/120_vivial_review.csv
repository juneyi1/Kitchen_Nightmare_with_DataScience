2016-03-10,5.0,"For Saturday morning brunch the place wasn't too packed which was great. The staff was very welcoming and helpful. I was stuck waiting for the rest of my party to arrive and they were very attentive and made sure all my needs were met. When we eventually ordered the food came very fast. We ordered a bloody mary and shared the fried chicken and grits. The grits were savory and cooked to perfection, while the chicken was crispy and went very well with the hot sauce - which I would recommend ordering. The bloody mary wasn't too spicy. It's a beautiful restaurant and despite the baby that was crying that morning the overall vibe was enjoyable and I would definitely return.",0.9749,0.679,0.246,0.075,0.7043055555555555
2016-03-06,4.0,"This place is great. I've been there twice now and enjoyed all of the dishes I have had. The beer and cheese soup is off the chain. The Duck Rillette, Frisee Lardon and the short rib are all excellent. My wife has also vouched for the tartare. The staff is warm and friendly and the cocktails are well done.  The only thing wrong with this place is the music. The only way I can describe it is as elevator music you would hear in hell. And they play it pretty loud, too. I'd rather listen to Kenny G. while dining than this. It's absolutely brutal. There is one song, in particular, that is just a loop of what sounds like a guy singing ""Ahhh"" in a high-pitched voice. Heard it both times I have been here. Both times it made want to rip my ears off of my head.  Seriously, this place is great. I am looking forward to trying the brunch. But if the folks who run the place read this, please, I beseech you, take the current playlist, burn it on to a CD, pour holy water all over it and then bury it at a crossroad.

2016-02-24,4.0,"Enjoyed an excellent happy hour cocktail with a friend at Vivial this week. I had the snoky, sweet tequila-pineapple cocktail ad she had the bourbon-egg white cocktail. Both stellar. The duck rillette was a creamy, salty, sweet appetizer for us to share. The presentation was strange, but interesting, with the rillette being tucked inside a stout mason jar. The bread was toasted and perfectly moist with oil. Yum! I was bummed that offered no happy hour specials, since most of the Chicago spots have jumped on board with that, now that it's back! And it was strange that in our two hour hangout (5p-7p) there was noone else in the entire restaurant. Since living in big cities my whole life, what has always been a red flag. I have no explanation for it...but it made things a bit awkward ambiance-wise.",0.9661,0.731,0.199,0.07,0.5092105263157896
2016-02-18,2.0,"Unfortunately, my visit seems to have been at odds with other reviewers...perhaps this place is better at brunch? My wife and I ate dinner there last night, and enjoyed the atmosphere, service, and cocktails. Those were all good, so you should go for a drink.  The food, on the other hand, was pretty disappointing.  We started with beer bread, which had a FANTASTIC crust/crunch on it, but was quite salty.  Some of that salt should have been reserved for our main dishes (mahi en papillote and duck confit).  The mahi was cooked pretty well and simply needed a little more seasoning. The duck dish was very disappointing.  It was both under-seasoned and over cooked. The baked beans that came with it were under cooked to the point some were still hard. I think maybe they were going for a variation of al dente, but these beans were half cooked at best. Finally, the plate composition was really out of balance. The plate was about 80% filled with beans, there were two small pieces of fried kale, and one small duck leg.  The crust on the duck was well-crisped, so that was a redeeming quality, but the meat was so over-cooked I eventually just stopped eating it.  TL;DR - go for a casual cocktail, maybe snack on the beer bread, eat dinner elsewhere.",0.9289,0.835,0.114,0.051,0.5804670329670331

2016-02-05,5.0,"I dined here during the soft opening with a couple of friends.  There are more candles than chairs.

The brunch menu is as equally impressive as dinner and more kid friendly.  Seriously, bring all the babies you can...  I'm sure they have enough high chairs.  ;)  Be sure to make a reservation through Yelp, OpenTable, or Tock...or else it will be hard to get a table.  (The bar is walk-in friendly)  Can't wait to come back and pick fights with the other diners!",0.9468,0.758,0.174,0.069,0.5675555555555555
2016-01-24,2.0,"EDIT: Nick Spencer, owner of Vivial, called me regarding my experience. This guy cares about his restaurant and the neighborhood. We discussed my visit and he was awesome and understanding. He explained the situation with the service level I experienced and the bloody mary not being available. It must be a good sign that they ran out and they have been experiencing an increase in covers. I will be re-visiting Vivial in the near future and will update my review. I'm sure my comments below are an outlier given the other high marks reviewers have left. ---------------------------------------- Long time viewer, first time poster. Purchased a Gilt City voucher for Vivial since I live in the neighborhood and the brunch menu looked good. Made a reservation day-of for 1 pm. Got there a few minutes before 1 and was directed to the bar to wait for a table, which is acceptable as we were early. However, we waited at the bar about 20 minutes before we were seated at a table that had been ready for a few minutes. Cut them a little slack with this since things happen during a brunch rush. After we sat at the table, no one came to give us a menu or offer coffee. It was radio silence. Then what we guessed was our waiter offered us coffee. A few moments later another waiter was checking in to see if anyone brought us menus and we said no. Our waiter came back with coffee and the menu. We informed him we had the Gilt City voucher and he walked us through the deal. They only had 3 cocktails on the menu and I was looking forward to trying their bloody mary creation, so I was let down to hear they ran out of supplies to make a bloody mary. I haven't come across any brunch place where this has happened before, but maybe it was an off day and they weren't prepared for the influx of Guilt city redeemers. I ordered the short rib hash as an entree. Short ribs are trendy and I'm always a fan of anything with this cut of meat. Sounded awesome. Unfortunately, it was bland and boring. The short rib was flavorless and did not have any hint of green chile as advertised. The corn tasted like it was straight out of the can or bag and had no seasoning. I don't recall tasting any caramelized onions. Overall, the dish was underwhelming and you could get a better tasting meal down the street. It was a bad combination of poor and confusing service, lack of a bloody mary for brunch, and bland tasting food. Maybe it was an off day, which happens. But I don't understand the hype to this place and will not be coming back.",-0.8876,0.836,0.071,0.093,0.503768115942029
2016-01-24,2.0,"we live in the neighborhood and really liked the prior place (jolly posh).  But we left with mixed reviews for Vivial.The burger is solid and tasty but my wife had the braised chicken which was way too small for $21. It also was salty, dry and hardly any meat on the bone. The potatoes were also salty and it turned us off so much that we will probably never go back.  We had the pepper appetizer that was just ok and nothing special.  The service was great and wine was acceptable. Overall, it was hard to find anything healthy on the menu and was very disappointed in the braised chicken meal.",0.8489,0.788,0.141,0.07,0.45648809523809525

2016-01-22,3.0,"A mixed review from me.  Four of us dined at Vivial and our responses to the food ranged from ""Wow!"" to ""meh.""  The duck was perfect, the seafood options fine but nothing special.  The shared dishes we ordered were both terrific and a bummer -- terrific in that they were delicious, but a bummer because the portions were almost comically small.  Our waiter directed us to the middle section of the menu as the place to find dishes ""for the table,"" but the outstanding bread serving was the size of a dinner roll.  Sharing that among four people gave us each about two croutons' worth.  Similarly, a flat bread dish with a wonderful spread came with five pieces of flat bread that were each about the size of a small child's finger.  Sharing these reduced us to cutting up a tiny bit of flat bread in a way that seemed simply silly.   While I appreciate Vivial bucking the trend of serving portions that are massive, excessive and wasteful, I think they swung the pendulum too far.  The entrees and the cocktails were also very modest portions -- actually, they were simply small; ""modest"" doesn't quite capture it.  So, overall, there seems to be a LOT of talent in the kitchen, but they either need to bump up the generosity of their portions or do a better job of guiding guests to order up.  We skipped dessert because we were afraid that the portions would be similar skimpy, and we left the restaurant feeling a mix of things -- impressed, hungry, and little resentful.",0.9926,0.743,0.198,0.058,0.6013655462184873
2016-01-20,5.0,"Fabulous gem of a place. My date and I spent a lovely dinner on a Wednesday evening at Vivial and everything was superb. The service was spot on and the artisanal food was delicious and attractively prepared.  We stuck to the featured beers and opted for sharing several ""for the table"" dishes as our dinner and we have no regrets.  We started with the for-starters Crudo (Marinated Skate, Spanish Onions, Sweet Potatoes, Cilantro, Chili Oil) which was light and refreshing and continued with the Steak Tartare, Bruxelle Noir, and the Duck Rillette, and finished with the Toffee dessert. While everything was delicious, our by far favorite was the Bruxelle Noir  (Charred Brussel Sprouts, Bacon, Baby Carrots, Balsamic, Pumpkin Seeds, Grilled Cheese) which I highly recommend.  The flavors were intricate and played well together and it was a real treat.  The manager himself saw us out and chatted with us while we awaited our ride.  Overall this is a wonderfully intimate establishment with superb service and food and I will definitely come again to try the brunch menu.",0.9932,0.701,0.262,0.037,0.6352380952380953
2016-01-16,5.0,"We came for brunch, and it was delicious.  Hubs got the breakfast burrito and it was excellent.  I got the smoked salmon with eggs.  The smoked salmon is in a mousse, and the eggs are done as a '64 degree egg, ' (more info here:  seriouseats.com/2013/10/… ).   Mine was not quite to my liking (seemed more like the 62.8 degree egg, LOL), so they re-made them.    It is up to the diner to decide how to combine the toasted bread, salmon mousse, and eggs.  The manager (owner?) also came by to inquire about my satisfaction - the staff is excellent - and explained how the eggs were made.  He told me his favorite way was to put the mousse on the toasts, stir the eggs, and pour the egg mixture over.  You could also dip the toasts into the eggs, depending on how crispy you like the toasts to stay!  No wrong way to do it.  It made for interesting conversation and it was delectable! We also got the blackberry muffin to take home.  For $6, it is quite small, so I cannot recommend it.   Will be going back to try out the evening menu.  Truly a neighborhood gem!",0.9822,0.802,0.163,0.035,0.6818181818181819

To start we had the baked potato skins that were creamy and delicious as well as the steak tartare with egg yolk and accompanying salts.  Clean tasting, simple tartare which I think is how it should be!   I had the polenta with mushrooms which was rich and very enjoyable, if a tad salty at times but not really complaining since I love salt.  My husband had the duck confit and liked it.   For dessert we had the play on creme brulee which tasted great but had not set and was a bit soupy.  We nicely asked if that's how the texture should be and the server spoke with the chef and they agreed it had not set and wasn't supposed to be that soupy.  Not a big deal to us, and they wanted to send out another but we were too full!    Short and concise wine list with some very reasonably priced wines, I had a marlborough sauv blanc for $8 a glass which is very reasonable.  We had a bottle of chianti that was super smooth and we both really liked it.   The manager was very friendly and hands on and found me on Facebook after my husband left his credit card!  We will definitely be back and would like to try the burger for sure as well as some other items.  Definitely a great addition to the neighborhood as there are several pub like/family friendly restaurants and this is a touch higher end than those.",0.9978,0.727,0.273,0.0,0.5614905753968253
