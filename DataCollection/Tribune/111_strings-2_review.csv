2016-04-09,4.0,"All I can say is that I like it, but I don't love it. As some people have indicated, the Lincoln Park location is not as good in terms of the broth or the noodles as the Chinatown location. The broth here is less complex, less milky, and less umami. The housemade noodles here are more chewy and a little harder.  But the extra ingredients and ramen options are definitely a selling point at this location. This location offers seasonal dacho (i.e. lean, protein-rich ostrich meat) often, in addition to other less basic meat options such as beef tongue, clams, lobster, etc., which the Chinatown location doesnt offer. For the extra protein options alone, this location is worth visiting. I met my fiancé here for lunch, and we both had the Premium Tonkotsu ramen, which has 48-hr. pork bone broth, tender Berkshire pork belly, a slightly tough pork cut, bits of cubed Berkshire pork belly, a super unctuous beef tongue slice, green onions, sesame seeds, black mayu oil, and garlic oil. While, like I said earlier, the broth and the noodles were't great, the toppings more than made up for it.  Carnivorous folks, come here for your meat-y fix.

2016-04-02,5.0,"After spending 4 hours outside in the cold and rain at a protest (proud CPS teacher here) what could be more delicious and welcome than a steaming hot bowl of ramen? I'm fairly new to the ramen scene (unless you count the Maruchan packets of my college days) and have actually only ever had it at one other place in Chicago (and its Santa Monica location).  I have quickly become addicted and Strings 2 has helped to feed (haha) that addiction.   We entered downstairs but were then brought upstairs to our table.  Everything about this place is lovely - the lighting, the green plants hanging everywhere, all made for very pleasant dining ambiance. The waitress was super friendly and patient as she went through her spiel of describing the different broths and proteins available.  There are 4 kinds of broth and then there is Hell broth, and in addition to the different types of ramen (lots of exotic meats) there is also an extensive menu of sandwiches, appetizers, and even a sake lobster pasta which my friend had and loved.  I was boring and went with the tonkotsu, basic pork broth and meat, but I do like my spice so I got a side of Hell sauce (level 2). It was beyond heavenly.  The broth was creamy and silky and the meat oh so tender.  I'm not a noodle expert as some yelpers seems to be, but they seemed good to me - not mushy but not undercooked either.  And again, that broth was amazing.  The Hell sauce added a great kick - enough to make my lips burn and my nose run, but in a good way and not so much that I was gulping down water.  The gyoza were also really good. To cool off we ordered an ice cream dessert - straciatella - vanilla ice cream with coffee and chocolate sauce, that was a great finish to the meal.  I did not leave feeling overly stuffed, just cozily full. At the end a very nice woman (the owner?) came over and talked to us for a long time too, which just added to the warm fuzzy happy in my belly feeling.

The other one is in Chinatown.  When we walked in we were greeted in Japanese so that was pretty cool.  Plus this location is kind of underground so it has that old school restaurant feel to it.  Our waitress explained everything to us so it was easy for us to understand all the dishes. I ordered the hell ramen at level 1. Our waitress said it was only with a kick but man she was wrong or I'm weak!  It was super spicy.  Level 4 and 5 require a waiver to be signed so watch out!  My girlfriend ordered the tonkotsu premium ramen which was delicious.  This is what I should have ordered. Tasty broth, well cooked noodles, and lots of goodies in the bowl.  The gyoza was very good too.  The dipping sauce it came with had the right amount of kick it.

We started with some gyoza that were delicious, though the sauce they came with was a little too spicy for my sensitive palate. (Assuming you now know that I did NOT get the Hell Ramen, haha). My ramen dish was pretty delicious, and the man loved his as well. Mine did come out a little on the luke-warm end, but the waitress said that would be because of the crab meat being cold? I feel like that's an easy fix... just warm up the crab meat when adding it, right? My one big complaint is the price... these dishes are crazy expensive. For 2 people without drinks, our bill was close to $60 before tip. That's a bit crazy for me for ramen... but it was really tasty so... it is what it is.

The broth was just too fatty and after letting the broth sit and cool off, there was a layer of fat that I could scoop off. Ended up just eating the meat and small amount of noodles given.

2016-01-15,1.0,"This was probably one of the most disappointing experiences I've had of any restaurant in recent memory. Based on all the positive reviews on here and a glance at their menu, this place really seems like they are dialed in able to spit out some serious ramen with a lot of variety to boot, the bowl I experienced last night was far from anything I could describe as serious however. We got there at 9, the tables was sparsely filled and far from capacity.  My roommate were seated quickly but it took about 10 minutes for a server to even ask us about ordering, when we did order it was a pretty limited menu because they were out of multiple items on the menu.  I came to try the tonkatsu premium, upon ordering our server told me they have the items but out of the broth so I should substitute.  Kind of defeats the whole concept, so I ordered a different shoyu bowl. We both order our 2nd picks, not really phased at this point, stuff happens so hopefully our picks will be good.  We wait another 30 minutes, an amount of time that is waaaaay too long for ramen.  Given the amount of people in the restaurant, I don't know what was going on but a bowl of ramen really shouldn't that long. We finally get the bowls and I immediately notice how translucent my broth looks, it basically looks like tea.  I take a slurp and it was tepid and flavorless. No exaggeration, there was NOTHING going on in it and it was barely warm.  I'm immediately dreading this bowl, I pack it full of seasoning on the table and dig in cause we were going to a movie later.  The noodles were under cooked and also flavorless, if you can't slurp them they are too firm.  The pork was very underwhelming, the small piece that was braised had some nice flavor but most of it was very bland.  The boiled egg was good, but it's an egg, pretty hard to mess that up. I'm not one to EVER waste food, I eat what's put in front of me.  This is the first time in a very long time that I even considered not finishing what was served to me.  Everything was under seasoned, barely warm, and just seemed like they were thrown in a bowl of water and served.  I'm no stranger to ramen, I have spent and extensive amount of time in Japan and ate ramen nearly everyday I spent there.  While I'm use to mediocre renditions in the states, this was above and beyond the most sub-par ramen I've ever experienced in the city.  A lot of my frustration would probably be quelled if I didn't pay $20 for such an experience, I'm shocked they are able to charge those prices for what we received.  One bowl and a cup of water, $20 bucks.  Totally ridiculous. I like to give shops a second chance, I understand inconsistencies occur, but this was such a poor experience I don't think I'll ever be returning and/or recommend to anyone seeking out ramen.  Going to stick to my regular digs like Furious Spoon that are quick, consistent, and give you more than your money's worth every single time.",0.8546,0.821,0.097,0.082,0.4840724449679675

The venue is very similar to the Chinatown location - very green and modern, but not much seating. Obviously, not a problem for us as we were the first ones there. I ordered the Kani Tama / Seafood Ramen and he got the Umai Aji, their Winter special. Our waitress also honored our social media post (listed on their menu) which got us the free soft boiled egg. Before, I dive into describing the ramen, I want to allocate a special shoutout to this egg. It's a soy sauce soaked egg that was perfectly timed to boil so that it reaches a heavenly state that's not too oozy, but just soft enough. It elicited a moment of silence from my brother when he first bit into this dreamy side. So, seriously, people, don't you dare go without ordering this egg - it's worth every penny! Now, the ramen. My seafood ramen had homemade noodles, king crab leg, small shrimp, orgasmic pork belly and other various ingredients, but it all came together so well. My giant bowl was slurped down in minutes! Only quip was that the miso broth was just okay, but nothing to tell yo mamma about. My brother's umai aji came in an almost comically smaller bowl. He had immediate order regrets, but then he took a sip of the hearty broth and never looked back. This ramen special contains beef tongue and some swai fish in a spicy broth. Delicious! Compared to some other ramen places in Chicago (Oiistar, you beautiful thing, you), the broth at Strings doesn't quite measure up, but their fun, exciting ingredients (and hello, that egg!!) will keep me coming back for more.",0.9964,0.789,0.194,0.017,0.48105105105105106

2015-10-26,3.0,"More of a 2.5 star review to be honest - my experience at Strings 2 in LP was sorta.. uncomfortable. Came in around noon with man friend, the design of the restaurant is swanky and modern looking - dark and kinda moody, but in a good way. We sat down at one of their four top tables (there were maybe five four top tables in the front room all in a row, not sure if they have more seating in the rear of the restaurant), and there was only one other table seated. Our waiter came by and asked us if we had been to the restaurant before, to which we replied we had not. He kind of explained the menu to us, pointing out the various sections of ramen, soba, and rice dishes, and then asked us if we were in the mood for rice or brothy ramen, or 'dry ramen' (which is how he describe the yakisoba). His manner was friendly.. but something about it was kind of off-putting to me. His speaking tone was kind of stilted, as if he was trying to recite a vaguely-remembered script. I also noticed that as more customers trickled in, his treatment of various customers ranged from very friendly to downright cold. Overall it was really strange to experience. We asked for a bit more time to peruse the menu, and ended up ordered the spicy wasabi string beans, the Level 2 'Hell Ramen', and the Kani Tama Miso Ramen. Maybe my taste buds were a little off, but everything was SUPER salty to me. Probably the best thing I tasted was the Level 2 Hell Ramen, and that was my boyfriend's so I only got a few spoonfuls. With all the great ramen joints around Chicago (I'm looking at you Wasabi and Furious Spoon), I probably won't be back to Strings 2. Maybe I'll check out their original location in Chinatown to see if that location is any better, but for now I'll have to give a thumbs down to Strings.",0.9529,0.814,0.116,0.07,0.5613425925925927

Started with the Cat Rice, not having any idea what it was but had heard good things. It's rice, cubes of tuna, seaweed, all topped with a rich and fatty sauce. If you love tuna... get this.  For ramen, my friend had the tonkatsu. The tonkatsu was flavorful and creamy-- the last place this friend and I had ramen was Yusho and we liked String's version better, a touch less rich.  I had jigoku hell ramen, level three. I had actually tried to order jigoku level four, but the waiter talked me down to three. I asked if he could compare the heat level to anything and he wasn't able to, but he said for levels four and five you have to sign an insurance waiver. Really? Anyways, I got level three and it was delicious. Noodles were fresh and chewy, and the ground pork made it so savory. I could've done without the fried pork skin as it got mushy in the broth. The broth was less hot than Jake Melnick's superhot wings, but hotter than BWW's wild. What, you don't measure heat level by wing sauces? So it was spicy, so yummy, and I wasn't disappointed, but I'm definitely going for four next time I'm in.  We both ordered a soft boiled egg on the side for $1. Didn't get an ice bucket for the bottle of wine we brought, boo. We also uncorked it.  Ended the meal with some notably good mochi.

Each spoonful of the broth was amazing and I absolutely loved every bit of it, especially the pork belly. It seems as if it was grilled, which made it taste even better than if it had just been boiled. I made sure to order an egg to throw into the ramen cuz ramen without eggs is just nuts! Also, you gotta make sure you  slurp the noodles, can't just chopstick them up into your mouth (since you can't spoon them in, rather ladle them in, though I guess you can if you swirl them into your spoon with the chopsticks). The whole experience was excellent from beginning to end.

The decor was nice, very woodsy and comforting. I got the tonkotsu ramen with ostrich meat added, and my boyfriend got the standard tonkotsu ramen. We also ordered a starter of a cold salmon noodle dish, dressed with a spicy yuzu (?) sauce. The starter was underwhelming, the noodles improperly cooked, salmon tasting a little funny. The sauce was delicious, but the whole dish didn't come together in a nice way. It was like eating separate components of a potentially great dish, missing the one ingredient that would tie the whole dish together.  The ramen, the whole reason we came, was extremely disappointing. First of all, the noodles were undercooked. Throughout Japan, I've had ramen noodles cooked to different extents, but if I can't even slurp the noodles, it's too al dente. The broth, which claims a long process of cooking down and extracting the goodness of broth bones, was just lacking in depth. You can really taste the love in a ramen broth, and this came up short. It also tastes like they used peanut oil or some kind of nut oil in the process of making the broth, and the flavor overwhelmed the entire soup. The only redeeming quality in the ramen was the char siu which was melt-in-your-mouth tender. I wish I just ordered plates and plates of this and nothing else. I left full but unsatisfied, the worst kind of full. Overall, I won't be returning to this restaurant.

The kitchen and food preparation area is so unnecessarily YUGE in relation to the dining areas that the latter are crowded beyond belief despite the relatively small number of diners present on a quiet Sunday.  When we arrived after a show, we were seated next to the cavernous kitchen but we occupied no-elbows-allowed territory, and after placing our respective orders were promptly told we must relocate to an even more scrunched area between loud couples. No breathing territory there, almost literally. Our server, rather a nice fellow as it turns out, eventually canceled our transfer so we remained merely painfully cramped.  So on to the food. It was okay.

Unfortunately, they never bothered warning us about the spiciness level of the ""Jigoku ramen"", which has 5 levels of spiciness.

It was almost completely empty, which was nice because we were seated right away. The service was great and so was the food...until 3 hours later when we were both hit by a fairly severe case of food poisoning. We know it was because of the food we had at Springs because we both ordered the EXACT same thing: the pork broth ramen with pork belly.  Three hours after consuming this food, we were both hit with nausea and severe headaches. Five hours later...I'll spare you the details. We were sick for about a day and a half. After we started feeling a bit better, I called Strings to let them know what happened and hopefully find some sort of compromise since we were both pretty upset since we spent over $40 here. In a short review of the conversation, here's some of the fantastic comments I was given as far as my food poisoning:  ""Maybe if you bring us a doctors note we can do something for you."" (We already spent $40 on food that gave us food poisoning and you want us to go to the doctor and pay a copay so we can bring you a note? Sure.)  ""We have never received any complaints or any calls like this"" (There's a first for everything!)  ""I'm pretty sure you didn't get food poisoning from my food"" (Calling your customer a liar is sure to go over well)  ""I'm going to speak to my manager and give you a call back"" (First off, I asked to speak to a manager to begin with so who the heck have I been talking to for almost 10 minutes?! Almost two days later, no call back)  Maybe I'm frustrated because the least I expect from  an establishment whose food gives me food poisoning is a refund and an apology, not them calling me a liar and telling me to go to the doctor. My boyfriend has worked in the restaurant industry for years and so have I.

2015-08-10,4.0,"After having my first bowl of (real) ramen in NYC the day before, it seemed fitting to grab some ramen on my way home from O'hare after my trip :) Pretty empty Sunday evening around 8pm. Lots of empty tables at that time (though it's pretty small- maybe 25 person capacity max). Menu is a bit overwhelming but our server was really nice and helped explain lots of things and guide us. For non pork eaters, several broth options here (nice chance from Ippudo in NYC with just one option). I went with the mushroom broth and ramen bowl- it's supposed to come with ground meat and I asked if I could just sub fish balls for the meat portion. Husband went with Hell ramen (minus pork/sub turkey on server's suggestion) at level 3. He originally wanted a 5 but when I heard you have to sign a waiver (SIGN A WAIVER) for levels 4 and 5 I thought maybe he should try 3 before forging ahead.  Thank god he did. He was HURTING. And he eats a LOT of spicy food. Be warned. I'd start low and work your way up. I have to ding them on service though. Along with my ramen I ordered the toasted garlic- never came out and when I asked, was told they were out. Ok but should have told me, I shouldn't have to go looking for it. Also my fish balls were forgotten- had to be brought out later. Another misstep. All in all I thought it was super tasty (husband LOVED the hell ramen, even through his snot and tears lol) but the mountain potato in my bowl was foul. I had never had it before but it's got a really slimy texture (looked like cream of wheat or something, but gooey) and a really off-putting flavor. I scooped most of mine out into another empty dish but next time I'd request without. In any event, we'll be back!",0.3251,0.809,0.099,0.092,0.5092592592592592

We went in there at 10 PM on a Saturday evening but it was empty ... For about 20 minutes. Then drunk young people started filtering in. The waitstaff was super apologetic and attentive to my shellfish allergies. So I thought the noodle and broth was fine but my partner thought that his miso ramen was sort of tasteless and the portions were too small. Imo: 1. Everything tastes fine except that certain topping items weren't available, such as the boiled duck egg.  2. I was excited to see that they offered ostrich and also venison and I opted for the ostrich shoyu ramen. The meat tasted fine, like beef, but my partner Felt like something tastes kind of off. Then again, he never had ostrich meat before. 3. Food poisoning? later that evening several hours after I had a few drinks from emporium, I experience stabbing gut pains and had to go to the washroom twice. I shat til I felt the chills and the room was turning when I got up.  I don't know if it was the drinks I had later that evening or if it was strings... I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt but I perhaps won't go back in a while...

2015-07-29,1.0,"Star rating based on inconsistencies and most recent service experience. However, the ramen itself and atmosphere is 3 stars, with the caveat that Chef is working the kitchen. When Chef isn't present I've found my pork belly is overcooked/chewy, the broth is too salty and overall not as fresh. When it is done well, the pork belly is the second best I've had in local ramen shops. It's thick, fatty, tender, and flavorful.  Sister location to Strings on Archer (Chinatown). I came here for the ""soft opening"" and was generously given loyalty cards and discounted offers to use by the end of July. Was very excited and impressed in the beginning. After 25+ visits, it's becoming unsatisfactory. First, the Dacho (ostrich meat) was highly advertised, then never really available. Don't expect seating for more than 4 guests. Most all the tables with the exception of one large one in the back (past the kitchen) seats up to 4. I met the Chef outside the front door on one visit and inside the dining room on another visit and that was enjoyable. I sang praises and am now regretting being overly complimentary.  Best servers are Lakecia and Luke, who have been here since the soft opening. Last occasion visited, Christopher wasn't impressive and at one point argumentative with me about taking my ramen with me, because ""the ramen continues to cook and taking it to-go isn't recommended by the Chef""... finally accommodated when I've explained that I've taken my leftovers to-go and had no problems enjoying later, like I have in the past. I found this even more perplexing since Strings advertises delivery on GrubHub and often have walk-in patrons ordering to-go! I felt like I was in a Seinfeld episode and only allowed permission to eat ALL of my ramen on the spot. Additionally, the lava egg (extra cost) wasn't available this time or the last 2x but I wasn't told this until after I ordered. Then, as I was waiting for my ramen, the server sat two gentleman at the table next to me and offered to include a lava egg in their ramen. The Shoyu is infused with wasabi oil that's far too overpowering and not a gentle Shoyu broth like most. The Miso is the best with the silkiest broth. Opt to leave out the actual clam pieces, it messes with the texture and taste. Unless you want a lingering tingle, then up to the Level 2 of the spicy variety is the most appreciated by my palate. Lava egg is whole and has always been soft boiled perfectly but cooled, with a semi-runny, chilled yolk.  Sriracha Broccoli with Bacon bits is worth it.",0.9869,0.857,0.109,0.034,0.3939468864468866

We were greeted warmly and were seated right away.The space was nice and cozy, but not exactly dive-y. There were only two other occupied tables. Service was great. Staff was helpful and constantly refilled our mini pitcher of water when necessary, which is always a plus. I ended up getting the Level 3 of the Jigoku (hell) ramen as boo got the venison shio ramen (they were out of dacho). Our ramen came out at an appropriate time and portions were decent. I noticed right away that mines was super oily. I thought it would be fine once I ate it, but it was seriously just noodles based in chili oil, instead of an actual broth. Maybe that's how it was supposed to be, but it was seriously off-putting and rather disgusting. I've had spicy ramen at other establishments and their broth certainly was not oil based. The spice level was satisfying for me, although I do think I could have handled Level 4. While I was satisfied with the spice level, it was very one-dimensional and the whole ramen lacked any real flavor. The noodles were cooked well but were forgettable. The ground pork did nothing for the ramen. Pickled veggies were okay. The only thing I did enjoy was the pork rinds. Don't think I've ever actually not enjoyed something spicy as it's my addiction. However, this tasted pretty bad to me. I tried boo's broth and his was much better...still a little oily, but not completely and had a more complex flavor. It was interesting. There was a tang to it...lemongrass maybe? Overall, the service was splendid. I would not mind coming back and trying other dishes, but certainly none of the 'hell ramen' again, which is disappointing since I love spice.

Unfortunately that never happened, but my visits to Strings 2 were both filled with positive experiences all around. Sad they don't have oden here, but instead they've added a few dishes unique to Strings 2. To be fair, my ramen standards have probably lowered. If I wanted my delicious bowl of silky tonkotsu and chewy curly ramen noodles, I'd still go to Wasabi. But for ultimate comfort and general noodle craving satisfaction, I'd definitely be happy going less than a mile to come here instead... and at hours convenient to me, too! 2AM after a long Saturday of work = best time for a bowl of ramen.  The noodles are straight in every bowl and not particularly chewy. They're very al dente in the way pasta is and some people love that, but I prefer mine to have a chewy resistance. Brothwise, they're all flavorful. Nothing is out of this world. But they're very distinct, interesting toppings. There was Chinese pickled mustard and a nice subtle acidity to the shio broth, so keep in mind not everything is necessarily traditional, but like I said, I was happy with the several ramens I've tried here.  There's also ostrich on the menu, and my friends all seemed to get a kick out of that when I whored myself on social media for my free egg (a perfectly cooked and marinated egg yay). Our ramen came with 6 thin medium-rare slices for a $6 premium, and as far as taste goes... a little gamey, but that's expected, and while I was glad I tried it and it tasted okay, I'd be happy never eating it again at Strings 2. Menu also has some summer veggie specials... all pretty simple, but shishito peppers, broccoli... a good offering. Spicy cat rice also has decent portion of big pieces of tuna (instead of the diced mashed stuff you'd see in some sushi rolls). What else... what else... service, friendly. They try to greet you with ""irrashaimase!"" in mostly butchered Japanese, but it's cute and I'm sure they're cringing a little too.

The selection is very rich and you'd have to eat here very many times to even cover half of the combinations you can order, but Chris expertly guided us into our final choices - a delicious broccoli dish, some chicken qyoza, miso seafood ramen, and pork/ostrich tounketsu.  Let me tell you, our meals were amazing. The broccoli/bacon dish had a fresh crunch and a nice spice to it. The gyoza were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside (though slightly under seasoned). The seafood ramen had shrimp, pork belly, snow crab legs, and a whole assortment of fresh vegetables and perfectly cooked ramen. I think there were also oysters? The tounketsu with ostrich was also glorious and delectable with large pieces of meat and a very healthy serving of vegetables and noodles. We were both stuffed! While we were waiting for our meals and the check, I paid attention to what an adjacent table ordered: some sort of spicy broth whose heat you could control by ordering different levels.

The staff looked like they either tired or ready to go home. You could read it all over their faces. I get it, it's Sunday there are other places you would rather be, but I mean fake it till you make it.  I went with a friend who has never been so I'm trying to explain the menu and tell him which were the spicy ramen. Our waitress comes and sets up our drinks, we say hello and I finish explaining what I think he should get. She interrupts me and yells hello as if she didn't hear us greet her in the beginning. I could tell she was either annoyed with us already or just having a bad day. We try to place in our orders and they don't have all the levels of Hell ramen!!  Nooooooooo! I said this sarcastically to lighten the mood, but she wasn't amused. Can you say, ""AWKWARD"".  So she left and put in our orders. I mentioned to my friend that we should have went to the Chinatown location, just bc he likes really spicy food and he's never been to strings before. She might have overheard me and maybe my comment upset her among us not vibing from the beginning bc we never saw her again during the entire meal. On a positive note, our food runner was very nice and more attentive than our waitress. The only reason I tipped was bc he was so nice to us.   The food was good. The broth wasn't very hot, but the flavors were there. The melon cream soda they have there is amazing too!! I would recommend that to any honeydew lover.  All in all, I will not be coming back to this location bc of our experience we had with the waitstaff. We left disappointed.",0.9388,0.766,0.135,0.099,0.6407340647857889
2015-04-19,4.0,"We stumbled in here past 2:30AM on a Saturday night and there were maybe only 2 other groups here. I never considered ramen to be a late night eat, but it's awesome that this place is open till 4AM, so they're open even later than some of the more typical greezy drunk food spots.  Ambiance: Instead of going for that dark Japanese hole in the wall feel, it was bright with wooden decor and plants everywhere. There were just a handful of tables in the front and I didn't see a bar with stools like they have at other ramen places, so I'm not sure how convenient it is to come here solo for a quick bite. Food: The menu itself was actually really cool looking. It gives some history about ramen from the different parts of Japan and there's even sections on ramen terminology and step by step guide on how you're supposed to eat it haha. I really liked how the menu was organized because it clearly lists the different types of ramen (Shoyu, Shio, Miso, Tonkotsu) and what the broth is made of. Then it pretty much lists all the toppings that come on the different types of ramen. This is super helpful for ramen newbies and people who have food restrictions. They also had a super spicy ramen (Jigoku) with 5 different levels of spice, and there's even an official ramen challenge they have for people who think they can take the heat. I went with the Tonkotsu ramen with the pork belly.  Toppings You have the option of getting pork loin or pork belly. I went with the pork belly, and it came with one big slab of gloriously fatty pork belly. It was so tender and amazingly fatty that it just melted in my mouth. I wish they gave more than one piece though. Like High Five, Strings 2 is pretty minimal with their tonkotsu toppings. Outside of the noodles and broth, it basically just came with a sheet of nori and some bamboo shoots, which is actually the way I like it. The one complaint I had was the lack of an egg. What kind of monster decided to not put at the very least half of a soft boiled egg in the ramen??? It's a must have! Noodles The noodles here were probably the most al dente out of all the places I've been. I think on the menu it said they only cook them for 45 seconds. I personally liked the texture but I could see people thinking the noodles are a little too firm. I also love how they have the option to add more noodles if you want, although I couldn't do that since I slurped up all the broth anyway haha.  Broth Ah, the star of the show for me. Broth is my main criteria when it comes to ramen and Strings 2 passes with flying colors. The broth had that depth and fattiness that I really enjoy. It was very rich, salty, and meaty and I slurped it all up. It's up there with High Five and Wasabi as some of my favorite broths I've tasted. While the bowls look pretty big, it's actually a little misleading since it narrows significantly closer to the bottom. Gimme some more!!  We also got the chicken gyoza. They had a nice crispy sear on the outside, but other than that they were pretty standard. The spicy dipping sauce it came with though was awesome. $8 was way too expensive for what you get though.  Service: Our waiter was awesome. He was super helpful in explaining the menu and helped my friends pick the right type of ramen since we had a vegetarian and one person who doesn't eat pork in our group. The food came out super fast and overall it was a quick bite. Even the manager was cool and was chatting with us about all the awesome ramen places around the city. Overall I really enjoyed the food here, and since it's open super late, it's definitely gonna be added to my late night eats rotation. I'm not sure how long the waits usually are during peak times, but if it's not so busy like it was when I went, it would be a great alternative to waiting High Five and Wasabi. The menu has a ton of other stuff I still wanna try so I will definitely be back here.",0.9995,0.772,0.207,0.021,0.5401080715974332
2015-04-19,3.0,"I would say I'm a semi-regular customer at the Chinatown location. Would go back any time. However, this new LP location has a lot of things still needed to be worked out. When my friends and I walked in there was no hostess. And someone hastily took down our name and told us to wait. After about 10 minutes, another guy came up to us and offered us a seat upstairs, which was mostly empty. Now my question is, why weren't we offered the upstairs seating earlier.  The menu was similar/exactly the same as the Chinatown location. However, when the food came out I think the LP location is a lot more oily than the Chinatown one, and the broth is a bit saltier. I'll probably come back when I have my ramen cravings again, and I hope they would be better organized next time.",0.7096,0.91,0.062,0.028,0.28684343434343434

2015-04-15,5.0,"I am so excited we have we have a Ramen place in the neighborhood!  My husband and I went last night without reservations (around 7:30 pm), and we were seated right away. It's BYOB so we brought a bottle of wine and cracked it open upon being seated.  We started with the pork gyoza, which was very good, and then we each ordered the tonkotsu ramen. My husband added the pork belly and an egg, while I added just the pork loin. He also added a side of the toasted garlic, which we both ate by itself and then added a few cloves to our ramen. It was pretty good! Almost tasted more like a potato, and was served cold and on the side, but we liked it. I'm not super familiar with traditional ramen, I've only had it a few times before, but this place seemed to know what they were doing.  Also, I noticed in a few other reviews where people said their broth came out lukewarm, well that was NOT the case with ours. Both of our soups came out very hot, and the noodles were cooked perfectly al-dente. Our server was very good and knowledgable about the main menu, but didn't actually explain the dessert ""chocolate truffle"" accurately. Basically it's a big ball of chocolate ice cream with a vanilla ice cream center. There are a few specks/small chunks of chocolate on the outside of the truffle and I believe it was dusted with a cocoa powder of some sort. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I actually asked her if the outer portion was chocolate ice cream and she said it wasn't.... But it was. Anyway, nothing too crazy, I'm just not a huge fan of chocolate ice cream, but that's not to say it wasn't delicious.  Anyway, the inside is very basic, similar to what I remember the other ramen places I've been to looked like. Long bench with simple style tables. It seems smaller than what it is.. Apparently there is a whole back section for seating which my husband noticed on his way to the restroom. Which is good because I can see this place getting busy! Also, the main menu can be a bit confusing, but our server did a decent job explaining it. She was also very attentive without being overbearing, and her pronunciations were ON POINT. All in all I would highly recommend this place to anyone who likes ramen or wants to try it out.",0.993,0.845,0.129,0.026,0.5099089635854341

2015-04-13,3.0,"3.5 stars.  They are pretty new, around the block, so I figure it should improve with time! The space is very conducive to intimate ramen consumption.  Great location, right around the fremont shopping area and a good spot for a quick bite before a show for sure. Menu is similar to the original with a few additions here and there.  The prices, for ramen, is sky high, but each bowl includes most every important topping.   I had the miso with pork.  The broth was smokey in flavor which I enjoyed.  Opted for loin, no belly and the meat was super tender and flavorful, really enjoyed it.  The components of the miso are excessive, not necessarily bad, but lots going on.  The portion is huge, in comparison to a bowl of tonkotsu.  Main complaint was the broth was lukewarm pretty quickly because the clams were cold, like out of the fridge.  Mentioned it to the staff, hopefully to amend for next batch.   also had a side of the spicy cat rice which is a bowl of spicy tuna with roasted nori -- really outstanding bowl of rice -- thankful that the rice wasn't hot as to cook the wonderful tuna :) instagram yourself or your food for a complimentary side of edamame or an egg.   Overall, would love it more if prices were just a little lower and the broth needs to be super hot to start and end.  loved the cat rice!",0.9978,0.676,0.291,0.033,0.6340379990379992

2015-04-12,3.0,"Ramen is a quick affair, so I'll be as brief as possible: The Good: - Hearty, lip-smackin' good miso broth, the tastiest I've had so far in Illinois - Unique, toothsome noodles - Delicious, tender Kurobuta pork loin - Getting to choose either loin or belly (I hate pork belly) - Side of spicy menma -- a must if you dig bamboo shoots - BYOB - Terrific location at Halsted and North - Open till 2 a.m. Sun.-Thu., till 4 a.m. Fri. and Sat. The Bad: - LUKEWARM broth -- unacceptable - Corn tasted of nothing, seemed frozen. The hell? This is the Midwest. - The worst gyoza (and dipping sauce) I've ever had, ever - The same loud, incongruous hip-hop that plagues ramen joints citywide - The same bewilderingly high prices that plague ramen joints citywide -- $14 for ramen and, even worse, $8 for gyoza is ridiculous I'll try Strings 2 again to see if it's worth my continued business. As long as I steer clear of the gyoza and ask them to hold the corn, maybe I'll enjoy myself more.",-0.7351,0.77,0.104,0.126,0.6322222222222221

2015-04-06,4.0,The broth is totally legit!!!! This is a first for Chicago (or second given their Chinatown location). We do not have to drive to Mitsuwa for real ramen.... I am moved to tears! The one star off is because (1) I thought the noodles were undercooked (maybe because we were there on the first day of the soft opening before things really smoothed out?? (2) the price a little high for ramen: ramen is cheap in Japan!!!  Will be back!,-0.5312,0.956,0.0,0.044,0.36424242424242426
