My food tasted great, the restaurant was clean and the staff was very friendly. I even overheard the manager helping a customer put together a custom order of larger sized subs.

Also, the ""muffuletta style"" bread rolls they were served on were nice and  stale, which was ironically complemented by the abundance of vegetable condiment.

The employees have never been what I would call friendly - they seem to think they are doing you a favor by serving them. This past Thursday my experience with the girl taking my order was the same - I made a lame joke which she rolled her eyes at. Whatever. The extreme rudeness started though with customers who came after me.  As I sat down to eat my sandwich, two middle-aged Asian women came in and had the audacity to ask for coffee. I guess that's a big no-no?! The guy behind the counter - not sure of his name but I've seen him there several times - directed them to Starbucks, and before they were even out the door, begin loudly mocking them - ""who orders coffee in a sandwich shop?!"" After the women left, the disdain grew even louder, accompanied by several four letter words. He then began telling more stories of stupid customers, making no attempt to lower his voice, curb potentially offensive language, or even maintain any semblance of professionalism.

Problem 2: MAYO OVERLOAD.  Like whoa.  I'm just as big of a fan of the chipotle mayo as any girl, but too much of a good thing is never satisfying.  I'd recommend easing up just a bit on the mayo application. Problem 3: The rice krispie treats seemed like a steal at $.89 a pop, but mine tragically tasted like soap.  I'm not really sure how/why something like this happens, but needless to say it was not the best way to cap off my meal. Despite some issues, I'm OK with Costello's.  I appreciate that their ""delux"" special is under $9 and provides you with a huge sandwich, a bag of pretzels, chips or an apple, a side dish (got the chili and was very satisfied) and a drink.  In theory, this should get you through two meals if you eat half the sandwich and one of your sides each time. I was also happy that our order was 100% accurate.  Three women = lots of custom ordering and Costello's nailed it.

I stopped by just to see you, I was in the neighbor hood, hungry and knew I had to stop in. Same look, which I will never get tired of looking at, but I got my sandwich on wheat roll and it was still good. I do have to say my chipotle mac and cheese was a little thin and runny with the sauce at the end, but I didn't mind, it had a kick and you know how I like my spicy heat. Besides all that, my sandwich automatically came with a bag of chips. I was jealous of how many other people you knew their name, faces, orders. You were still warm and friendly but maybe if I came around more, if I saw you a little more often you would remember me, but no hard feelings. I'm full and I have a smile on my face when I left.
