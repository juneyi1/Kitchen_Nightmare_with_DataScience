2015-09-19,3.0,I recommend the bun bao and the popcorn shrimp but not the ramen. I tried the beef galbi bun bao and they were pretty good. Popcorn shrimp were crispy and sweet. Ramen had huge chunks of pork which was bland. Used a groupon and it is a good deal. Place was too dim inside though.,0.967,0.685,0.315,0.0,0.7261904761904763

They were out of beef, no problem.  Asked about the ramen and how it compared to other places in the area.  Waiter didn't really know.  I wanted to know spice level and was hoping it wasn't too spicy, waiter said it wasn't spicy but a little tangy.  I asked to leave jalapeños off  just to be safe. So how was the ramen you're wondering?  In one word?  Awful. Huge chunks of pork belly and egg were nice additions, but pork belly was largely flavorless.  The broth was incredibly spicy and not tasty.  The noodles were bland.  I'm usually a good eater, but this just wasn't worth it knowing there are places like oiistar that serve incredible ramen just down the street. Maybe Rodan is more of a night time drink spot, but it certainly isn't great bc of the food.   What saved this from a one star review?  Waiter didn't think twice about removing ramen from our bill when we stated our dissatisfaction.   Bottom line.  There's so much better in the area, keep on walking.",0.9345,0.744,0.155,0.1,0.6187896825396827

The atmosphere here is super unique--DJ in the back playing stuff that may match up with the huge video on the projector, but it may not. The daily specials all look like a great deal; we were happy with $4 3 Floyds Alpha King drafts. We started with the steamed edamame, spicy style. All this meant was regular edamame with a pile of dry spice on top. Strange, not really tasty, but at least we were able to knock off as much of the stuff as we could. Would've been much better with just sea salt. I ordered short rib bao buns, which came with raw jalapeños. The jalapeños overwhelmed the flavor of the meat and sauce inside... And the meat was cold and super hard and chewy. I don't know if I'd feed it to my dog. The Szechuan green beans saved my meal, but I could've made them at home. My boyfriend got the ramen, which we thought was decent, but nowhere near as good as the ramen across the street at Oiistar. It did have a hearty portion of crispy pork belly though.

On this visit, my dinner mate and I ordered the popcorn shrimp, fish and chips, wasabi fries, and bao buns. Dinner mate had the shrimp on a prior visit, and lamented the freshness of the app. The fish was tender, but the coating was overly crispy and ""cracked"" off the fish. I skipped the wasabi aioli as it left something to be desired, so I ate the fries by themselves. Bao was dry and overly chewy, and the kalbi was fattier than expected.

Asian fusion is one of my favorites, so I might be a bit biased! On my last trip, they had a different menu, so I think they change menus seasonally. I had a quinoa dish with added pork belly that was awesome! On this trip, we shared the Thai chili wings and coconut curry wings and the pork belly bao buns. Loved the Thai wings, but the curry ones could have used more sauce. The pork belly buns were really good! I would recommend them. Drinks were solid. I loved lychee, so I tried the drink with lychee and champagne. Also good--and the waitress told me it's their monday special for $4!

It was a Friday night so many of the popular places were packed and had over 1hr wait. So I  yelped to see what was around and found this place. I have recently been to Chicago's wingfest and know that these guys won in 2014, but was  unable to taste thier wings at this years event because they ran out, so that means it must be good. I assumed like many great wing spots this was a sports bar, I was so very wrong. We walked in it was very dark, with some trance music playing. The vibe was very clubish. My first impression was this is a lounge, theres no way they serve food here, but they did.   Everything on the menu looked so good. Its Asian fusion, Im talking pork bellys, boas, burgers, noddles, all that good stuff. We got 12 wings 4 of each flavor (  coconut curry my fav, thai chili, rodan(sweet). The wings were good, loved the asian flavors to them.  We also got the hanover burger, and rodan burger. They accidently brought 2 hangover burgers and let us keep the extra for free. The hangover burger is spicy with a hint of wasabi, fried egg. The Rodan is a amazing wagyu patty with porkbelly and kimchi. The flavors here are the real deal. Beer list is unimpressive for this area, and the vibe is deff diff, but I dont know what it is but something is missing. Part of me thinks the trance music and lighting doesn't work but part of me kinda likes it. Overall great flavors and a unique dining experience!",0.9947,0.764,0.194,0.041,0.5097435897435898

I liked the thick cut bacon, but I'm still not sure if I liked pairing it w/ the satay -Fried pork belly baos: these were real solid. Good sized piece of pork with cucumbers and some pickled carrots. The place is pretty dimly lit. There's a DJ in the back that spins while random movies are being projected onto the screen behind the DJ (when we were there, it was a mix of the Matrix and some old Alfred Hitchcock movie).

Umm, more like jerky ribs with maybe a bite or two of meat on there... and you really had to chew them. Not a good start. I got the steak fried rice, HOLY SALT. I literally ate 4 forkfuls because it was BEYOND salty. And my gf tried it too, she couldn't even swallow it. Pure salt, inedible, and such a waste. I imagine he took a box of salt, cut a hole and dumped the whole thing into the dish. It was that bad.  She got the hungover burger, nothing to rave about on her end. Wasabi fries... they are just mushy fries and wasabi aioli. Such a bummer.  We settled up our check and ran out of there. While we were walking, we stopped at another restaurant up the street because I've never seen it and I wanted to check out their menu. We got to talking with the hostess and she told us that Rodan is very ""hit or miss and they are mainly about their drinks""... so clearly tonight, a huge miss.  It could probably be better next time around, but I definitely will never go back to find out. Good luck and hopefully you get a ""hit"" when you go!",0.9372,0.836,0.106,0.058,0.4043859649122806

On a Wednesday... 1/2 price wings on Wednesday is a decent deal.  But without the deal, I'm not sure if I'd ever willingly choose to go here.  Kind of like going to see your dentist on a Wednesday, only if it was half off... ::WINGS:: They have 4 flavors: Japanese BBQ, Korean BBQ, Thai chili buffalo, and Rodan sauce.   -The flavor profile on the Korean BBQ and the Rodan Sauce were very similar.  A mildly spicy, but tangy sauce with some hints of sesame and onion flavoring.  The sauces were solid, but I did not feel like they needed to be classified into 2 separate flavors.  I have similar feelings toward Mary Kate and Ashley... -The Thai chili buffalo is definitely different and seemed like a hit or miss amongst our group.  The thai chili definitely takes priority over the buffalo flavoring.  It almost becomes like a curry type flavoring, which for me is a little weird on wings.  But I can see how people will like it.  I have similar feelings toward Mary Kate and Ashley... -The Japanese BBQ was the weakest.  The sauce was overly sweet and did NOT take advantage of the smokiness it was dying to complement the sweetness.   I had similar feelings toward Mary Kate and Ashley (Full House years)... Another disappointment about the wings were they didn't maintain that crispness through the sauce.   As the old anonymous saying goes ""Nothing is worse than a basket of flaccid wings.""

Not much else to say there Food.... Overall the food was very good. Some of the dishes really stood out with others leaving something to be desired. So 3 of us went, using a groupon for 2 and buying additional food. We ordered the Mussels, the Pork Belly Fried Rice, the chicken curry dish and the fried fish and chips. Mussels: easily the shining star of the menu. The mussels were decent in size and were cooked perfectly. The sauce was the special side of this dish. With a curry backbone, there was a strong Star Anise flavor which is a unique spice for those not used to it, and something I've never tried in mussel broth before. It worked excellently though and is a dish I will happily order again. I might have (ok I totally)  had them box up the broth for me to use as a simmer sauce cooking at home! The fries have a blue cheese crumble melted on top, which if you love blue cheese (I don't) works very well. Fish & Chips: the piece of fish was surprisingly thick, and fried perfectly. Crispy, yet totally moist inside and not too greasy. The fries were the same as with the Mussels. Pork Belly Fried Rice: the fried rice part was excellent. it seemed like they used an Indian type basmati rice as it wasn't sticky and all the ingredients weren't in one clump which I prefer. The jalapeno was a nice touch for some heat. My only complaint, and a fairly big one, while the pork belly was cooked perfectly, seemed to have a good deal more fat (and less meat) than I've come to expect from a good pork belly dish. Maybe this was a 1-time thing, so I'll try it again but this dish is only worth it if you get a good serving of meat Chicken Curry Dish: this was the weakest by far and was just OK. It's also of note that this is the only dish we didn't finish Ambiance: It is sort of clubby inside with a giant 100""+ tv screen playing some Christian Bale movie with trance music playing. This is not really my scene but one of my friends loved it. I will say that the space is put together really well and we had a nice seat on benches/couch chairs for a low key meal.  DRINKS!!! Can't forget the (arguably) most important part of the meal! while their beer selection was only OK they did have an awesome special for a Tuesday night ($4 Revolution beers, including Bottom Up Whit, Anti-Hero & Eugene Porter).

Holy salt, the hummus and chips were so salty we could barely eat it, and this coming from someone that often likes overly salty food.

The buns had good flavor but were pretty tiny for the $12 price tag, and did not include the side of fries ($4).  The fries were crispy, but did not have much of a wasabi flavor. The coconut curry was unusual. It looked like a giant bowl of spaghetti, and hardly had any sauce or vegetables. Overall this was probably the worst meal out I've eaten...and we decided this before I woke up sick in the middle of the night...

The atmosphere is sparse and not at all like the current reclaimed wood craze - the vintage video mash up projected on the wall made me feel like I was at a rave, but hey good memories! The menu is really random - I had a moment of hesitation where I thought maybe we should leave, but I'm glad we stayed!  The drink menu was nice and varied. Sake? Check. PBR? Check. Wine? Check. Craft beer? Check. Plus a full bar - your options are covered.  There really wasn't much on the menu that I could eat as I have issues eating spicy or fried foods, so I ordered the udon stir fry and my husband ordered the coconut curry.   The food arrived timely and at first bite, we both proclaimed ""YUM!"". The Rodan sauce on my stir fry (which by the way is a bit spicy even though our waitress said it was not spicy at all) was delicious - a very nice sweet-hot soy sauce based sauce that apparently they are known for. My husband (a curry connoisseur) loved his coconut curry - he said it was unlike anything he had ever had and ate up every last bite of it. I would have tried dessert but their two options of tempura-something and mochi ice cream were not too enticing for me.  So I guess this place is a restaurant/bar/lounge. It had some couches and a place where a dj could set up, plus that weird video projection wall for when you want to space out... The music was electronic/loungey/Hotel Costes which I totally dig. I'm surprised it wasn't busier but maybe it was just a slow night on the town.  I would have given it five stars if there were more options on the menu that weren't fried or spicy. Otherwise, I would recommend as a great option in Wicker Park! Other bonuses: Everyone who worked there was very nice.  Our waters were regularly refilled. They have outdoor seating options.

We arrived at 6:30ish, and due to the early timing, were among just a few other patrons there. To begin, we ordered a few cocktails - which were delicious - y mas fuerte. Then we ordered the tempura green beans - which were a simple, but scrumptious snack to hold our hands down the aisle of our next cocktail. Two cocktails in and we we're feeling a Chicago-summer-buzz in all of its glory. As we began to hit that high, Josh - Rodan's bearded culinary conductor, stopped by our table to deliver a COMPLIMENTARY second appetizer, brazed pork belly, covered in his (signature?) homemade asian-inspired sauce. The magnificence of the taste was only superseded by the elation we felt by receiving a FREE dish. In other words, hospitality makes everything taste better (not that it needed it) and makes everyone feel better (again, thanks to the cocktails, not that we needed it).  Then, after chatting with Josh some more (which further enriched the experience) we ordered an entree - the pork boas. Not surprisingly, they were delicious. Also, our waiter put in another FREE side order of green beans for us - just because. Another score! As we were wrapping up our meal and waiting for our check, Josh emerged AGAIN with ANOTHER COMPLIMENTARY entree - a ramen dish. Needless to say, we were taken aback by the level of generosity and congeniality Josh provided us - all amounting to a wonderful dining experience which we having been raving to others about ever since.

We sat down and a great runner brought us some water. We asked for lemon and he graciously brought it. Then I looked at the glass and that thang had lipstick on it. I asked the waitress for a new glass of water and pointed out the lipstick. She didn't apologize and wasn't rude. More so indifferent, and brought a new water. Then the runner came back in and apologized. I wasn't pressed. I was hungry and ready to order. Reached down to take a quick sip and the replacement glass had lipstick AGAAINNN.  See now y'all had me messed up. I was like oh no. I told the waitress and this trick rolled her eyes. That's when I had to tell that trick I wouldn't be dining there.

2014-07-09,4.0,"Pan/fusion-Asian place with a chill ambiance  in the early evening but it can get loud later! The food might be 3 stars but the drinks are 5!  The fries are decent though and come with a seasoning and horseradish sauce that is quite addictive. otherwise the food is alright-palatable (average bao with average tofu or pork fillings and average pan Asian tasting spicy string beans)... But nothing special. What it lacks in zing in makes up for in decor and drink selection.  Highly recommend any of the cocktails: esp. Ginger Hibiscus, Horse Feathers, Lychee Martini.  The place has a projection wall and dancefloor-ish space that most of their young professional crowd feel too self-conscious to dance in until a few get absolutely plastered. Of all bars I've visited in Chicago so far, I think they've got the music nailed with live DJs on most nights. If you like funky house, disco house, deep house, techno, this place is for you.

Big let down. So I thought no big deal. They'll just replace it right? Wrong!  I usually never ever say anything to waitstaff esp since I have worked in restaurants myself. I inquired with one guy about the fried rice. First he says something about it being a typo. I show him it in the menu. He acts like he's going to go ask someone and then never comes back with any sort of answer.  Finally, I flag him down again and he says that it is garlic fried rice.  He says it rice with garlic sprinkled on it.

2014-01-27,2.0,"Four of us came here on a Sunday morning for brunch with bottomless mimosas.  The place was empty, save for a couple sat near the front, but I think they were friends with one of the staff.  Our waitress, an eastern European woman, was pretty hard to understand, but otherwise average to friendly.   At first, they wouldn't sell us the bottomless mimosas because they were almost out of champagne (they would still sell us mimosas at the per-glass price, of course).  So, since the bottomless part was the reason we came, we decided to go to Crocodile instead (we'd been before and loved it).  When the waitress saw us putting on our coats, though, she ran over and said the manager changed their mind and we could have the special after all.   They were pretty weak (which I guess in hindsight we should've seen coming). (A few months later, another group of friends went and ordered the bottomless mimosas with brunch at Rodan, as well.  At some point during their meal, their waitress told them they were out of champagne.  Those friends laughed it off... hey, we drank Rodan dry!... but I'm starting to wonder if this isn't an excuse Rodan uses to limit how much people drink.) Now, on to the food.  The dish I ordered sounded SO good on the menu.  It was pancakes with strawberries and blueberries, honey butter, and coconut whipped cream.  When the plate arrived, though, it was really disappointing.  The amount of fruit wouldn't have even filled my palm, the butter didn't taste any different from regular butter, no whipped cream (coconut or otherwise) to be found, and the pancakes were dry. I felt like someone was trying to put me on a diet. Music:  It was nice at first, some kind of generic-sounding pleasant music for our Sunday morning (ish), but it changed to annoying thumping electronica midway through our meal.  Even though we were now the only people in the place who didn't work there (and continued to be until we left), they wouldn't change it back for us.   Verdict:  Skip it.  There are tons of places to get brunch with better food, better service... and better bottomless mimosas, which you won't have to threaten to leave to actually get.",0.9965,0.773,0.181,0.045,0.4891446391446392

Their idea seems to be to infuse American flavors into Asian cuisine, and Asian flavors into American cuisines. This doesn't always translate into a winner. The cocktail menu also swings from American traditional Manhattan to a Lychee Royale. The décor and ambiance say neither Asian nor Gastro pub.  It screams lounge. All of this put together throws this place off in my opinion. They should maybe focus on infusing  American with one specific Asian cuisine.

2013-09-01,1.0,"Ah Rodan, where do I start.  Let's start with the only thing that really matters - the food is atrocious.  I showed up for brunch today and ordered their Hawaiian-style breakfast platter: fried rice, a fried egg, choice of breakfast meat, and a cucumber-tomato salad on the side. They had spam elsewhere on the menu, and I shamelessly adore the stuff (I'm Korean), so when asked, were kind enough to substitute spam for ""PBR-soaked sausage,"" among other things. So far, no overtly obvious red flags. Apparently soaking random stuff in PBR is a thing now? I'm a bit confused but whatever. The taste of the rice was easy to describe - ever cooked rice, left it in an open container, forgot about it for 24 hours, and then came back and tried to eat it? That's exactly what it tasted like. Except also brown with cheap soy sauce and a handful of chopped spring onions on top in a presumably half-hearted attempt to avert complete disaster. It didn't really work.  I guess I've had worse fried eggs. It came out cold. Woops? The spam tasted like spam. They managed not to screw up something that came out of a can. Good job?  I came with two friends. One of them ordered chai-spiced french toast, and I tried a bite. Remember when you visit your relatives for the holidays and your 12 year-old nephew or cousin offers to make you french toast and he basically just takes wonderbread, dips it in beaten egg, and fries it in a pan with butter and you pretend to enjoy it because 1) you're not an asshole and 2) come on, it's adorable. Except you're not my nephew and it's not adorable and oh my god you cannot just take a 12 year-old's french toast, sprinkle chai-spice powder on top and pass it off as a brunch item.  My other friend ordered a salad and a plate of veggie gyoza. I didn't try the salad, but the gyoza tasted exactly like a certain Korean brand of frozen gyoza from H-mart. Should I have been surprised? I guess not. What should I have expected walking into a japanese-themed brunch place that has such eclectic items as Sapporo ramen and chicken and waffles? Oh, don't worry, the chicken is fried ""Thai-style.""  So normally, I don't comment too much on the decor, but having big red lanterns swinging just an inch above your diner's heads seems like a bad idea? Like it was literally an inch above my head. And I'm only 5'8"". At least they had pop-eye projected on the wall to distract me from the obnoxious asian-trance mix they had blaring incessantly.  The sooner you leave this place, the better.

2013-05-16,5.0,"Rodan is an Asian-fusion underground-hip-hop dive bar gone disco hipster. The setup and decor is brilliant. The medium-brown finished wood walls that wrap around to the ceilings are surprising and worth sitting back and admiring the taste level. Every table has a glow; either from a centered tea candle or a floating paper lamp. You can tell this place is Asian fusion without looking at the menu. The seating options are; outside, bar-side, 2-4 seaters next to the huge open window facing the crowd of Milwaukee Ave--- or booths next to a live DJ and digital TV projection screen. Large groups or tuck-a-way dates have the option of contemporary gray sectionals or a rustic bench. You seat yourself, I like that. Sometimes I want to impress someone by having the sectional all to ourselves. The servers greet you, recommend specials and keep it moving--- it's a bar. I prefer it that way. Good specials. I remember an option for either a PBR & Jamo shot for $6 or $2 cans. I've never tried anything other than the burgers here, it doesn't give me that ""chef in the back"" vibe I need to start ordering soups and whatnot. I stick to burgers and appetizers. The audio system sounds incredible and the DJ was not amateur by any means. I found myself with Shazaam on my phone constantly trying to snatch the song being played to download later. The music ranged from disco to funk to Motown to R&B. The vibe of this bar is extremely eclectic and great for a night out, a date or meetup. It offers a ton of variety and is one of those bars where you don't have to talk to the person you're with, just sit back drink and zone out in the ambience.  The crowd is an eclectic bunch of people, I never know what to expect when I arrive at Rodan--- it's spontaneous. I ordered Edamame Hummus, a Togarishi Burger w/ Wasabi Dusted Fries and a Delirium... all while listening to Outkast being spun live to the Rocky Horror Picture Show.  My only negative is the bathroom. That's where the dive bar comes in. Tagged walls and that awkward moment where you and another guy are trying to figure out if the bathroom is for one... or two dudes.

I came here for brunch on a Satuday after attempting to go to Bongo room down the street but the line was too long there. Walked up and read the menu and they had a pinoy breakfast. Being Filipino myself, I definitely had to try this out. For comparison purpose, I'm comparing the food to Uncle Mikes, which is another diner that also has a filipino breakfast.  First I asked how many Longanisa comes with the meal (at Uncle Mike's it's 3). Longanisa is like a small pork sausage for anyone that doesn't know. My waitress told me 1. So I was confused, was it just 1 huge sausage or do you only get 1 small sausage? Either way, I was thrown off and went with the thai chicken and waffles instead. That was kind of weird. I understand that they throw asian flair onto their dishes but it was just too weird for me. Don't really recommend that.  My gf got the tosino which wasn't too bad. Still no Uncle Mike's though. Good amount of meat though for the price. Not sure if it was garlic rice or suppose to be normal fried rice but either or it tasted plain. It was ok though, nice to know that there's filipino  breakfast available walking distance from her apartment.  They did have outdoor seating which was pretty cool. People watching on Milwaukee avenue is pretty entertaining. Watching people park is funny, all the dogs that walk by are cute.

The Wasabi Dusted Fries are really good as well. Most importantly however, it's a really cool bar. They show old movies on a projector in the back, it always seems to have an amount of crowdedness optimal for the time of day and all the waitstaff/bartenders are super nice and helpful.  In the end, I want Rodan to continue to exist and I'm proud to call it a neighborhood bar.   And quite frankly, I'm not sure how I ever considered giving a bar named for a Godzilla villain anything but a positive rating.

But then some food was ok and some was meh.   Delicious: I had their mussels and they were just perfect, amazingly balanced and tangy coconut curry broth, plenty of toasts for dipping in the broth, perfectly cooked and cleaned mussels. Just great.  My companions had two other soups and said they were delicious too. Okay: Before that I had the avocado bao, which rather dry. It needed a sauce of some kind.The bun was kinda dry and dense, although tasty. The filling was well-prepared, it just needed more sauce to make it sing (they mentioned a mayo but I couldn't taste or feel it). I also think their take on bao (where it's just a fold of dough rather than a full bun) reduces the doughy delight of bao where you get a whole pillowy mouthful.  Meh: Their vegan cheesecake was disappointing. It appeared basically to be a condensed brick of mostly-unflavored tofu. The texture was dense and not creamy at all. It had hardly any flavor. There were two cherries on top but they didn't add much - perhaps a coulis would have helped? The deconstructed graham cracker crust was tasty but also extremely dry and would have been well-paired with moister creamier cake. I've had good vegan cheesecake so I know it's possible, but they need to retune this recipe. Service was great, music was rather loud for dinner (and kept switching in volume).

Mostly, food was delicious, some of the items were overcooked; for example, the crostinis and the buns.  Hummus was above par, liked the cucumber accent.  The mussels were a great dish, especially  the seafood broth, yum, but half of the shells were empty.  Sad face.  The chardonnay was amazing.  I even took a picture of the bottle for future purchase.  Service?  Let me tell you.  She dressed well but did not make up for her inattentiveness.  My disingenuous waitress was too busy doing shots with a perspective suitor at the bar than if i wanted that second bottle of  wine which i had to get up and ask her for (one of three times I had to stand up and request service) Our busser was more attentive than our snooty waitress whom gave us attitude everytime we asked for something, even as ordinary as silverware.  However, we even complimented our busser on his skills and commented that we wish their roles were reversed and he were our server instead.  He did not accept our compliments well, odd.  As wine connoisseurs, I was offput by the uncorked bottle dropped at the table.  Not once did either the server nor the assistance smile or say your welcome for the constant thank you's we gave them.  I am an audio engineer, I love dj'ing and they had a killer setup (rig) but were unabashedly, admittedly playing youtube unmixed.  Shameful.  I love dj Terry Allen aka Frique and know he spins there, wish he were there that night.  I will be back, but have to say......cheers friends",0.9862,0.775,0.155,0.07,0.49690476190476196

We kind of lingered between drinks, apps and entrees and he never rushed us one bit. He also gave great recommendations, which I always appreciate, and absolutely went above and beyond with one of my friends and her choice of entree: she's doesn't eat pork or shellfish, but was interested in the ramen (which mentions both pork belly and fish cake.)  She asked if the dish was made with the pork belly or if it could be made without and also asked what type of fish was in the fishcake. He was beyond helpful - he went back to the kitchen and since the soup was made with the pork, he offered to use their red miso broth, but add the noodles and poached egg. He said they couldn't be quite sure about the fish cake, so best to leave that off. She would have been fine picking something else entirely, but I was seriously impressed with his kindness and professionalism.

We split the wasabi dusted fries, which were amazing, and each got a couple of their tacos. I tried the fish taco (mediocre), and a Korean taco (amazing).  We saw our waiter exactly 3 times. And each time was awkward. He never smiled, made eye contact, uttered more than monosyllabic short sentences, or checked on us. I don't expect stellar service everywhere I go, but this was just dumb. We would have ordered more drinks, but it was too painful to sit there and try to see if we could get his attention again. The drinks and atmosphere weren't *that* good...  That being said, we got our food quickly, and our dishes were cleared quickly, but that unfortunately had nothing to do with our waiter. I almost sought out our busboy to give him the tip instead of our waiter....  Food = GREAT (4 stars) Service = Pathetic (1 star) Atmosphere = Wicker Park ""hip"" (3 stars) I'd actually really like to go back to try some of their other food as they have a great menu and tasty food, but I'll have to wait until I forget about the poor service, or explore their take out options (?).",0.0543,0.806,0.099,0.095,0.578954081632653
2012-01-23,5.0,"I signed up for a Yelp account just to write this review.  I like burgers.  I usually get burgers the first time I go somewhere.  Kinda a test I guess. Their burger is the best constructed burger I have had in very long time.  Do you want a 3/4 pound sloppy slab of beef that soaks the bun and slides all over?  Well don't come here.  Hard to explain well, but the burger stays together very nicely and is a joy to eat.  Meat is very good.  It was cooked properly as ordered.  I can't think of a better burger on Milwaukee from Division to Western.  On Division, Smoke Daddy competes, but that is about it for the area as far as I am concerned.  Wife had some fish soup with awesome-tasting broth.  Pleasantly surprised with this place. I will say the atmosphere is not my cup of tea, but it doesn't rub me the wrong way either.  I rate on food-only, so who cares about that.  Service was fine.",0.9785,0.761,0.199,0.039,0.5359375

Upon entering, the place was fairly busy, Dj was playing good tunes, and we found our group in a booth toward the back.  We started off the night with a few lychee drinks (they were indeed delicious- 4 stars).  However, we pretty much had to get our drinks each and every time. I think I saw the server visit our booth once... not acceptable.  We are a pretty low maintenance group, but this was disappointing.  The ambiance was ok, nothing too special.  I had a great time because of the company that I was with-- if that were out of the picture, it would have been borderline boredom.",0.9681,0.686,0.215,0.099,0.5401098901098901
2011-12-19,4.0,I pretty much love this place! Since I live really close this is one of my go to places for both food and drinks. FOOD: I have tried many food items from old to new menus here but I stick with what I love the most.  The Togarashi Burger is probably one of the best burgers I have had in the area.  The burger is always prepared perfectly medium every time I have ordered it and loved the wasabi fries.  Sometimes I'll get the fries as a side if not too hungry or the tempura green beans.  The Korean Tacos are wonderful and even better on Thursday $2 taco night though you're only saving a $1/taco. DRINKS: Nice beer selection and I love the Moscow Mule.  Reasonable drink prices and a nice chill place to meet for just drinks either at the bar or a booth. SERVICE: The service is a bit slow but I am never really in a hurry here anyways.  I do wish the servers would recognize some of us regulars even though I am not in here everyday like others but enough that you would think they would remember. BOTTOM LINE: Good food and drinks and an overall chill/cool atmosphere.  Rodan hasn't done anything wrong to make me not want to come back.,0.997,0.731,0.264,0.005,0.5662337662337661
2011-12-11,3.0,"Hands down, Rodan has one of the coolest atmospheres of the bars in Chicago. It is a good place to go at the beginning of the night and decide where to party, or if you just want to have a chill night with friends. It is also a perfect place for a date.  Over the years I've seen Rodan go through many different menus and music nights. What is still there is the Asian influence in the cuisine, and the popular Tuesday Jazz  night. This night features members of Tortoise for some cool freejazz instrumentals if you're into that sort of un-rhythmical thing. What Rodan lacks now is the DJ Rickshaw reggae night on the 2nd Fridays, which had everyone bumping and grooving in the aisles.  There is still a reggae dub vibe earlier in the evenings on Fridays dubbed ""Early Dub"". Now that was a lot of dub. But this feeds into the more atmospheric side of Rodan, which is probably it's best. The current 2nd Fridays have the ""Solid Gold"" 90s hip-hop and dance night. Frankly it is too cheesy for me. I think if your going to do a dance atmosphere do it right, if you want to be whimsical and sarcastic that's another vibe. Not one so much for a dance party anyway.  If you are going to Rodan for a late dinner and chilling rather than dancing, here is what I would recommend. First of, you must try the signature cocktail Lychee Royale. It is composed of refreshing Cava a.k.a. Spanish Champagne, lychee juice, and a lychee fruit bubbling at the bottom of your glass. This combo is most superb and delicious, and I am not even a champagne drinker. It's priced at $8. As far as food, you must go with the Sapporo Ramen. OMG. Yummers! This is one fancy $12 bowl of spicy white miso broth, smoked pork belly, poached egg, fishcake and veggies. Your taste buds will delight in the contrast of the spicy white broth and intense smokiness of the pork. The poached egg is done just right and soaks up all the flavors in the bowl. This is definitely a filling meal of high quality and worth the $20. There are some other innovative Asian influenced dishes on the menu like the Chili Pan Fish and Korean Surf and Turf.  The one other thing that can be lacking at this joint is service. Sometimes it's impossible to get a drink. One time I walked in with a friend and sat at a table and a rushing stressed out served came to yell at us about sitting down while others were waiting to be seated. Yet, when we walked in there was no one at the door to take our names or let us know that there is a wait on the seating. But again, Rodan's style and atmosphere are unmatched in this city and with good drinks and grub it's easy to forgive and forget ;)",0.995,0.84,0.136,0.024,0.5139547450185749

Since I have read a previous review to try the Lychee Royale, I ordered it and gave it a chance. It was pretty good, but I suppose I expected it to be juicier or have a strong lychee taste, but that's just me. However, it was great to have the fruit in the bubbly glass.  I also ordered the Togarashi Burger (medium rare) with the Wasabi Fries. The burger was really good and juicy, and I thought the presentation was nice. The grilled marks on the burger buns made it look gourmet. Like other gourmet burgers, this one was pretty tall, but I surprisingly didn't have major messy issues or had too much of its contents spewing out. And dipping the fries into the wasabi sauce transported me into a stage of foodgasm! It was sooo good, it was tempting to not share-- but I wanted my friends to have a taste at this awesome side. Honestly, if I were to come back I would probably have those fries (maybe 2 orders) as my whole meal! And don't worry, the sauce isn't really that hot at all! The atmosphere was good, and so was the service.

Being vegetarian it can sometimes be difficult at fusion restaurants to find yummy and exciting fare to eat. Not at Rodan. Their menu changes fairly constantly and it always features a few delicious and inventive vegetarian options. I love their Jungle Curry and just recently I tried the Tofu Tacos (from the small plates menu) which I must say BLEW MY MIND. The tofu was cooked so wonderfully it was really the best veggie taco I've ever had. Meat lovers fear not, my husband comes here for one thing, the steak, and it never disappoints. Our our most recent trip he got the Korean Steak and Eggs and was quite happy. Again I don't have enough good things to say about this place. Their beer menu is also wonderful.

The decor is really nice and svelte, with candlelit booths towards the back of the restaurant. It was pretty quiet when we came in but there was a DJ spinning some reggae later on in the night so I'm guessing it probably picked up after we left. That was fine with us, since we were just there for the food and didn't really care for reggae. We ordered: veggie fruit (maki avocado, asparagus, mango, tempura flakes) - probably the most disappointing dish of the night. I thought it was pretty bland. My boyfriend thought it was okay. Would have been better if the mango was ripe. wasabi dusted fries (served with wasabi aioli) - this was really good. the wasabi dust had this cool sweet-savory umami thing going on. the fries were also pretty good quality. tofu tacos (cornmeal breaded tofu, miso corn and tomatillo salsa) - boyfriend didn't like the tomatillo salsa too much, but he did like the flavor of the tacos. korean tacos (crispy pork belly, kimchee and mozzarella) - this was good. Reminiscent of Del Seoul kimchee porkbelly fries, except with much better pork belly (crispy and larger portions). Would have benefited from a sharper cheese (like cheddar) and scallions (this analysis is based on the Del Seoul fries).  Service was pretty meh, but wasn't horrible.

Oh, and you've spoken to him maybe once or twice, but the way his deep, velvety voice caressed the words, ""I think you dropped this,"" as he handed you back your pencil gave you the shivers.  In a good way.

Maybe it was the lighting: warm and amber in the candlelight; cool and blue on the mini-dance floor-- but always soft and muted just so. Maybe it was the Asian fusion burger: tender, juicy, and paired with delicious wasabi fries. Maybe it was the sake.  Or the lychee champagne cocktail-- which was, obviously, delightful. Maybe it was the fact that I could have a delicious, reasonably priced, and possibly romantic meal-- or grab a couple of drinks with friends in a lounge-type setting-- and then get up and dance right afterwards.  In the same place.  (Yeah; it might be a little awkward, and people might stare, but that's just part of the high school experience, right?)

You walk into Rodan and it's a very nice looking and clean bar/restaurant.  However, which do they want to be, a bar or a restaurant?  What do I mean you ask.  The bathroom in this place made me feel like I was walking into a college bar's bathroom complete with the smell of cheap paint splattered across the urinal and toilet.  In addition the mirror is this smoked out thing which only provides reflection when close up, and at that a smoked hazy reflection.  In and of itself I think it's neat but doesn't belong in the bathroom.  Still, they could get away with it in a guys bathroom but the ladies not so much.  The ladies I was with pointed out how much the ladies want a mirror.  The second issue was the waitress.  They were having a presentation in the back and the place wasn't busy.  Considering the time she should have had on her hands she wasn't, oh how shall I say it, attentive or caring in any fashion she had customers.  Ah well, I'll chalk that up to a bad day but the bathroom is un excusable. Now then, that is enough negativity lets move onto the good things because I did like their food and liquor.  They have a small selection of beers but a GOOD selection of beers.  The list isn't cluttered with a bunch of innocuous cr**; the selection is well thought out and high quality.  The four of us ordered up the wasabi dusted French fries, tempura green beans, and crab cakes.  The aiolies are bar none the best thing these guys have going for them.  The wasabi aioli was fantastic and was really good on the fries, which themselves were nothing special.  The crab cakes were good and had an interesting sweetness to them that was enjoyable.  The tempura green beans were crisp and refreshing with a perfect tempura on them not to crusty or oily but adding to the texture and flavor.  I had the seared ahi tuna which in itself was fine but the sauce on the salad beneath it was good enough to buy by the jar.  It has the perfect intermingling of sweet and sour with the infusion of Asian flavors to compliment the greens and tuna.  My girlfriend had the fish taco which was very good but a bit dry.  The fish had a nice light battering on it which was quite tasty.  As soon as I through some garlic aioli on it for her it turned into an A.  All-in-all you can see I thoroughly enjoyed the food and would like to eat there again.  However, they don't know whether they are a nasty college bar or an Asian Fusion Bistro.  Their service could use a slight upgrade to.  I won't steer away from the place and will try them again but only for appetizers on my way to a place where I don't feel like I'm standing in pee if I need to use the little foodies room.

2010-06-07,1.0,"One star, because the food WAS pretty good. However, it takes more than good food to run a place. This past Friday, I met a few friends at Rodan. I coudn't find parking, so I told them to get seated and order, and I'd  be in as soon as possible to order, because we had a show to get to. SO, I arrived 5 minutes after them. They had ordered drinks and food and told the server to come back for me in a few minutes. It took 20 minutes for us to flag down a server and get me a drink and food order. I sat there PARCHED, wanting a simple water. By the time she came to our table, everyone had already gotten their food,  and I decided I needed a drink to deal with this. SO, I order a glass of water, a French Martini, and an entree. I am IMMEDIATELY disappointed when I try to order sweet potato fries, and my waitress says, i'm sorry, your entree comes with regular fries, we cannot substitute. ""I said, oh? I didn't realize it came with fries, can't we do an upcharge for the sweet potato fries? I really had my eye on them?"" She said, ""Oh, we can't do that anymore. You can get a salad instead of fries, and then order a $6 side of fries on top of your entree."" YEA...because i want to order WAY more food than i need.... ridiculous. I ate regular french fries that evening. Then, I receive my mediocre $10 martini. French Martinis are my FAVORITE drink, and I can tell when they don't use the right ingredients. It's quite simple really, vodka, pineapple juice, and a bit of Chambord. This cocktail did NOT have Chambord, and instead used some other sub par fruity  liquer in it. Sorry if I sound snooty, its just that in a restaurant this nice, I'd expect my $10 martini to be made properly. Even dive bars make the drink better. After that, I got my entree, I drank all my water and no one came to fill it a single time. I finally sat it at the edge of the table to make it more obvious after waiting for water for 15 minutes. Someone came by and TOOK the glass .... and never returned it with water. I also know they were going around with pitchers filling water glasses, so they wouldn't have probably taken it with intention to refill anyway. Bogus. Lastly, our server was VERY short and rude when dealing with the bill. She acted like it was the end of the world because we gave her cash and two cards for a bill of 7 friends... In a nutshell, terrible martini, terrible service, good and creative food.",0.9607,0.869,0.086,0.044,0.5117105961671181

Seriously middle of the road, Pan-Wanna be. It was like the eighties version of Pan-Fusion.  My tuna roll was tough and oddly minced. It completely lacked any flavor,at all. My Udon soup - was noodles and a indistinguishable broth - with a very heavy after taste of sesame.  Steak was OK. It was well done and not medium rare I requested. It was the most retro piece of meat, I have ever eaten. Almost like salisbury.  Dessert was a white chocolate mousse. Yet, it wasn't mousse, it  was a pool of milky cream with rhubarb baby foodsauce on top. Seriously, don't order it - it may actually be the grossest thing I have eaten all year. Didn't have any cocktails - because I was dying to go home and make myself a better meal.  Great staff - but I would avoid it until they tinker with the menu. It needs a lot of work, alot of work.

I come to this place exclusively for the Tempura Green Beans and $3 Lychee Royals on Monday. Mondays are also fun for another reason; grab a window seat and watch all the inappropriately-dressed underage gals skip to Rehab at Debonair, just down the street. Don't get me wrong, I go to Rehab now and then, but Rodan is the perfect escape...a pseudo-Japanese oasis in the middle of Milwaukee Ave. They also carry some amazing brews and while the liquor selection is not vast, they have what I like: St. Germain's Elderflower Liqeur and Hendrick's Gin. And for some reason the PBR always tastes sweet here; it's on tap which I guess explains it.  The Togarashi Burger is heavenly...a fine patty of beef (or ground-up vegetables, I've had both) covered in sprouts and a tangy Asian sauce. My friends are partial to the Wasabi-dusted fries as a side, but I prefer paying for the 'bean upgrade.

The green beans have very light tempura batter so the tempura:green bean ratio doesn't spoil the flavor.  2) Spicy Tuna Maki (4 stars): What can I say -- I'm a sucker for sushi anywhere I go. Although the tuna was mulched, it was well done here. I did miss my side of unagi sauce though.... 3) NY Strip Steak (3 stars):  This was the fiance's dish. It was average. You could taste that the meat was previously frozen. It was cooked well (medium-rare) though. The tempura onion rings were a nice touch, and the shallot vinaigrette dressing on the side salad was excellent.  4) Chef Special (4 stars): My dish. Very innovative. It had prosciutto, sweet sausage, and some other pork dish that I'm unfamiliar with, but it was all very good. The side of a deviled egg was a nice touch. One star off for the pate. It was way too mustardy and sinus clearing (in a bad way).  Overall, I thought the food was cutesy, innovative, and very good. Not bad for $42. Even better with our $40 Groupon.

Great lights and decor, really nice chill atmosphere, dark, good music, hip crowd. The food was amazing fusion of east Asian and Latin American. But people always went more to drink then to eat. This was a great disappointment as the food was fantastic and not very expensive. The giant video wall, some occasional dancing, the low-lounge chairs, and the video screens instead of mirrors in the bathrooms all worked well to make this place a fun night now. Flash forward now 5 years to 2010. The video screens in the bathrooms stopped working 3 years ago and have never been fixed. The host and a few waiters have not changed in the entire time. They just look older and like they still want it to be 5 years ago. The menu has changed, some of the drinks have changed, and people still go more for hanging out and drinking than they do to eat, perhaps even more so than 5 years ago. BUT....it is still a great, underrated place to go! In fact, I feel like it is more underrated than it used to be. Like it always was, the crowd is still mixed. You get 1-part hipster, 1-part frat boy, 1-part urban professional. The different groups blend well, the music is still great, the atmosphere is still hip, and the food is still amazing. They seem to have slimmed their menu down, no doubt in part because people just don't seem to go their to eat. I ate there last night for the first time in about a year and was surprised to see how much the menu had been cut and also that it had become much cheaper. You can now have a very fancy meal, presented very nicely, all for under the price of $20 not including drinks.  I would definitely recommend the tempura green beans for an appetizer. They are a decent size and can feed 3-4 people to get you going. I would also have the Hong Kong crab cakes. You only get 2 but they are exquisite. Finally, I ordered the NY Strip Steak. I have to say, I wasn't sure what to expect with the steak. I used to get their Argentinian skirt steak back with their old fusion menu. I was worried this might be disappointing. But it wasn't. Perfectly cut slices topped with incredible seasoning made each bite an incredible sensation.  Although I still regularly go for drinks, I regret now that I have not been back for dinner until now.

The Wasabi Fries, although they tasted good, seemed to be frozen fries from a bag, which is a shame. The Edamame Hummus was too garlicky and the Togarashi Burger just tasted like a burger.

It's good for a date, a girls night, or just with a friend to grab drinks. Any reason to come to Rodan is a good enough one for me. I've munched on their sweet potato fries (yum!) and their tempura fried green beans (more yum!).

So, I finally stepped inside.  I was pleasantly surprised.  This cozy and intimate environment features small booths (personal digital TVs I could do without), brick walls, a mini balcony with a couple more intimate tables, couches in the back, and a nice hardwood bar.  Though being over 30 puts me outside the demographic, it's easy to make this environment your own. The beer menu keeps up with the times- 50 or so choices (15 draughts), including some British Isle options beyond Guinness (Smithwick's, Tetley's).  Food options average around $10 for bar sandwiches.  I got the burger with Kobe beef just to try it.  The verdict is that there are other types of cattle I'd much more readily sink my teeth into, but it's good to have the option.",0.9666,0.885,0.105,0.01,0.4617901234567902

The result was a large shallow bowl of some kind of brown gunky curry, with steamed rice plopped in the middle.

I was told that they would be here around 10pm, I was here about 9:50pm, finding stellar parking about a block away. I came in, no sign of them. Okay, well they did say around 10pm. So I wait. While I wait I get hungry. I snag a four top table and peruse a menu. I don't know how long they are going to be so I ordered a sesame encrusted seared ahi tuna salad and some Belgian fries. (What? I had the salad to balance the fries off.) At this point the place is starting to fill up. I look around, throngs of people, some dressed to the nines, some dressed in jeans and t-shirts, some in skirts, some in skinny jeans, a mixture of people, so I didn't feel too out of place waiting for the friends, (um, where the hell are they?) and eating alone, (actually ,I have no problem eating alone). The scenery really is a slight upscale lounge type, exposed brick, slick walls, low seated couches to one side, tables to the other. Low level mood lighting and people noshing, chatting and in various forms of flirting and commiserating. The food comes out quick, the salad is pretty and pretty tasty. Remarkable and awe inspiring? No. Setting high standards in the culinary world? Nope. It was just pretty tasty. The tuna was a little more than seared, but still pretty good, the addition of the tangerines hit the acidity and gave some brightness to the dish. The fries had some flavor, but not not close to crispy, ( I actually don't need them to be crispy but limp isn't the way I roll with my fries.. I need some firmness), and the aioli needed something to give it a little more flavor. Something. Anything.  My server was friendly and quick when I needed things, although at this point it was creeping closer to 10:40pm and I decided that I needed to get going and I felt bad for taking up a four top as people still were coming in but not the ones I expected.

It also has a bit of window seats to get a view of the street and all of its debauchery. I've only been here a couple times, each on a Saturday and enjoyed making a different kinds of people going there. (I tend to be forced to dbag bars, so its nice to get out).

Edit- Went a 2nd time and must take off a star, first of all, the waitress was rather rude and unfriendly when we were asking for a different seat for a birthday dinner.  I understand she's the only one there and must be busy but a smile and some basic, standard politeness could go a long way!  Secondly, I ordered the wasabi fries and asked for extra wasabi since I didn't taste any the first time I came, and AGAIN, it simply tasted like seasoned fries.  Crispy yes, but no wasabi flavor at all!  Thirdly, the prices are decent but the amount you get for the peruvian steak or the argentinian beef is very meager.  Maybe ok for a lincoln park trixie but I want mah MEAT!  And finally, the chimichuri sauce was a weak knock off green paste with no kick, I was very dissapointed and almost take 2 stars off my initial 5 star rating, but I'll go again to see if that was simply a bad night.",0.955,0.766,0.146,0.089,0.47859730848861287

The service was average (though see below about early plate clearing) and it seemed sitting at the bar with a drink was a thing to do. But there menu looked so amazing that we ordered dinner. I decided on three stars for potential. Wasabi Fries: Was there wasabi here? Tasted like extra-crunchy french fries to me, good, but not wasabi. It came with two sauces, a very, very subtle peanut dip and a soy type thing. Didn't really do it for me, and would rather have had something else. Sticks buns: there was curry in there? really? kind of plain. And then the bread came out, which we were supposed to get in the beginning. Also, the guy came buy and swept everything up. There weren't people waiting, and we weren't finished ordering, so it was kind of strange.  Orange sesame crepe: Also not as flavorful as it had potential to be, and I think I could easily make this at home. I thought there would be at least some veggies in there too, but it was just tofu and spinach. A little boring. I told the waitress it was my friends birthday, and they nicely brought out cake. But two things: first, they brought the cake out with our entree, and second, they charged me for the cake. Now, I didn't say anything about the cake charge, but I also never specifically asked for cake either, I just mentioned it was her birthday.  It was getting more crowded as we were leaving.

Our table of 5 shared the appetizers of cigarette rolls with shrimp and pork rolled in egg wonton wrappers (6) (reminiscent of lumpia shanghai) and the wasabi tempura battered fries with spicy peanut and honey wasabi sauces (6), fresh sea bass ceviche with grilled sweet corn (8).  The cigarette rolls were small with 6-7 qty served with a vinegar sauce.  The wasabi fries had a yummy crunch and texture but did not have the slightest taste of wasabi.  As for the ceviche, very small and very sour, served along with 5 small tortilla chips.  On request, the pandisal and chips were refilled.   I also shared the Spicy shrimp and rice coconut curry soup (6). The soup needed more vegetables, but good spicy flavor, and a pretty big portion.

I thought it'd be one of those weird, uncomfortable dining situation where you're the only table in the restaurant, but we grabbed the last available booth near the turntables and people were consistently streaming in.

Anyway, our waitress was slow to get to us, but two other tables walked in just before we did, so we let it slide. I've been craving veggie sushi ever since I had the veggie kun at SushiSamba (don't even get me started) so we decided to start with the tempura avocado and lime-glazed asparagus rolls and the veggie dumplings for good measure. The rolls were amazing! Crunchy and creamy avocado nestled near sweet asparagus and a piece of their mild pickled ginger had the best texture and a uniquely delicious taste. The dumplings were okay; I like the ones at Zen Noodles a little better, but they weren't bad.  For entrees, my homie got their fish n chips and I went for the quinoa tofu stew. I don't get down with eating animals, but my friend ate every single last crumb on his plate. The stew had a light broth with onions, cranberries, walnuts, glass noodles and chunks of green papaya. It was very flavorful and hearty, but at this point of the meal I knew I was going to go easy on it so I could have room to share a piece of espresso chocolate cake with raspberry sauce (yeah, we went all out). I knew I'd be so full that I'd barely be able to walk home, but I went for it anyway, and I'm glad I did, because it was yummy and the perfect way to end the meal.

Great drink selection - full bar, GREAT beers (from PBR to Duvel), wine too. Good food - Its a lounge that happens to also serve very interesting and tasty bites. Portions could be bigger but I'm typically impressed. Great Audio/Visual - Love the bathroom screens, keeps my mood up after a long day. The music is eclectic and varied depending on who knows what. DJs are always choosing and blending well. Sometimes they pull down a big projection screen in front of the dance floor and play cool films without sound, just music and awesome visuals. Love it. And maybe its that I like the crowd so much. The people are either pretty, interesting, or both. Generally a personable group made all the more by the setting.

I also like that on a Thurs-Sat night, the place gradually gets busy/crazy, so if you want an easy vibe, go early, and if you want loud beats and crowd, go late.  We went early and stayed late.  Love the transition. The special effects stuff is pretty neat, but would probably be a little lame if I ever go back.   So unless you have a violent reaction to hipsters or frat dudes, give Rodan a couple hours of your life and experience something a little less ordinary.",0.9793,0.728,0.194,0.079,0.5543154761904762

2007-09-10,3.0,"DINNER REVIEW (as opposed to brunch or the bar) I came here on a Saturday night to have dinner with a small group of my friends. First of all, they didn't take reservations, which didn't actually end up mattering because we got there at nearly 9. But this surprised me because Yelpers seemed to say that they TAKE reservations.  The space here is definitely loungey. They've only got a handful of tables, and wide open spaces for the later bar crowd to come in and mill about. In fact, as we were finishing up, this bar crowd (and their cigarette smoke) settled in on the bench immediately behind us. The smell of cigarette smoke does not make the food appetizing. Then there is the lighting problem. I'm in my early-mid twenties, and I am having problems reading the menu with their basically non-existent lighting. I had to resort to borrowing the light from cell phones to read their small menu. This plus the strange light show against the wall? That's not really appropriate for dinner. Or anything that doesn't involve illicit drugs.  Between the five of us, we ordered the veggie dumplings, sea bass ceviche, empanadas, and wasabi fries for appetizers. We were starving! The only thing I tasted, unfortunately, was the wasabi fries, which were basically just battered french fries with absolutely NO wasabi kick. What's up with that? Nor did either of the dipping sauces have any kick to them either, just sugary sweetness. Not really spectacular - I would NOT recommend them. I had the grilled salmon curry for the entree, which was a salmon steak covered in an uninspiring curry sauce, with a ice-cream-scoop of rice to accompany. The salmon was grilled well, but the curry sauce was halfway to a cream sauce - just, again, not enough flavor. And I hate to force the point, but the darkness makes the food pretty unappetizing. The best thing was their drinks menu. Bobatini - with tapioca balls - were a new twist, and the lychee martinis were a great blend of sweet tropical fruit and dry sparkling wine. The service wasn't all bad, either.  But I can definitely think of better places to shell out $35 for dinner.",0.983,0.835,0.115,0.05,0.582987012987013

I guess he wanted Toast.   Neither of them liked the side of Yuca potatoes they serve with just about everything...    They were severely over-seasoned, it tasted like eating a pine tree.  His eggs were also undercooked (runny egg whites) from what was ordered.  I liked what I ordered but it was on the soupy side.  The coffee was slightly burnt and/or bitter tasting.   The atmosphere screemed, ""Hi, I'm really a late night lounge but hey we'll serve you food too in the morning if you want..."" ...

Rodan is a lovely space, clean lines and modern, but so minimalist that the sign outside is really easy to miss.  We went with a party of eight for brunch last Sunday and didn't have to wait too long, which is an anomaly for the area for sure.  The food, as many have mentioned, is a fusion of Southeast Asian with South American with American, and as far as the brunch goes, it seems to work.  They have both healthy/vegetarian/vegan choices and more indulgent items for reasonable prices.  I loved my huevos rancheros, and everyone else seemed to love their choices too, from the salmon benedict to the flank steak and eggs to the crepes.  The portions are huge.  The drinks, like the raspberry bellinis, are good as well. The only problem was that, as our server informed us reluctantly, they were two people short, and so service was a bit quirky and slow.  Some items got mixed up and drinks took a long time to be made.  But our server was very sweet and earnest and apologetic and it was clear he and everyone else was doing the best they could.  But in any case it didn't dampen our experience at all and we had a great time. This is more of a three and a half-star review but I'll give it the benefit of the doubt.  I'd love to see how it is at night--it seems pretty cool.

As for the food, this is probably not the place you want to go for dinner but only get some expensive bar snacks.  In my opinion, the food needed some major help.  Upon reading the menu, it was obvious that the meshing of Asian and South American cooking styles sounded experimental.   I sampled the Adobo Cornish Hen and give it a big thumbs down.  Needs more vingegar!!!  The Tuna Kilawin wasnt spicy enough and lacked a fresh quality.  I asked for my Argentinian Beef to be cooked medium rare and it came out dry and well done.   Overall the food did let me down, but the whole atmosphere put out a cool vibe that I really liked.  I would only reccomend this place as a place to get a few drinks and chill.  Forget the food, it blows!!!",0.9683,0.849,0.138,0.012,0.45790711346266905

I got the impression that Rodan is where the truly beautiful people hang out.  Not pretentious hipsters (if you check it out on a weekday, not sure about the weekend) but normal, sexy, people.  I had a few drinks here with Em last night and was impressed.  The drinks are reasonably priced (or at least my Ketel One drink special was)  I hear the food is excellent, and the atmosphere is lovely and low key.  The perfect spot to curl up on a couch and bring your journal and drop a few pages of poetry.    Drawbacks...They actually need to cancel the whole projection gimmick altogether though - please get real mirrors in the bathroom because I need to know when there is seaweed in my teeth before I go chat up one of the beautiful men who filters through Rodan during the course of the night.  And the projection show on the big screen is just weird.",0.989,0.725,0.186,0.09,0.5655363155363156
