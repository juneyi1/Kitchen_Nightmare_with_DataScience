2015-03-14,4.0,I have been wanting to come here for months but never found the time to do it until today.  When I walked in I was greeted by a guy behind the counter. He was really nice and told me about each loaf. He also offered me a sample to try. They all looked so good and I couldn't make up my mind. The guy suggested that I get one cupcake and a loafie. Which I thought was a great idea since I couldn't make a choice on one. So I got the Omega-3 cupcake and the Roma loafie. It took them about 5min to warm up and was ready to eat. I will definitely go back to try more.,0.9812,0.786,0.214,0.0,0.58125

The people whom work here are soo friendly, and they also had plenty of sample for us to try.  We tried the loaf a roma, and the garlic mashed potatoes.  The loaf of roma didn't really taste particularly special, so I guess the novelty is that they are in cupcake form.  We purchased the fuego loaf, which is a spicy meat on top and the garlic mashed potatoes on the bottom.  This loaf also came with a side of gravy.  I was kind of disappointed when I got home because there was nothing fuego about the fuego loaf, not spicy at all.  They could have amped up the spice quite a bit.  Plus it was also kind of pricey $8, for a not so tasty piece of meat with mashed potatoes.

The building (at least) has about 200+ people in it and alot of people get excited for these days.... with that in mind... The Meatloaf Bakery brings their food truck to our lot (they were about 45 minutes late from their scheduled time- which is crucial when you have a lunch break) , people start to line up to get their food... except by the time the first 5-10 people had ordered THEY HAD NO FOOD LEFT. How is it possible to run out of food after 5-10 guests all buying 1-2 things each? I was probably 8th in line and getting cold meatloaf to heat up myself was the only option left for me-- so I bought ""the mother"" and a whoopie pie-- WAY OVERPRICED-- For $13 I could have gotten warm food that actually filled me up and I enjoyed. Take-a-ways: If you dont care how much you are spending on mediocre food then go for it, but if you are looking for something that is quick, reasonably priced, and convenient-- this is NOT the place to get it.

This was a concept I was surprised hadn't been executed yet- meatloaf is comforting, versatile to many adaptation, and lends itself to healthy manifestations. Eagerly I selected the classic ""mother"" loaf and dug in. Firstly, ten dollars for a meat ""loaf"" of this miniature size is absurd- they call it a cupcake for a reason. I don't know where they are sourcing ingredients from but nowhere does the bakery claim to be locally sourced or organic.  For 20 bucks I can make a 2 pound loaf with grass fed beef... Am I missing something here? All that said if the establishment delivered a once-in-a-lifetime meatloaf, I'd gladly pay the price for it. Alas, the meatloaf was crumbly, dry, and very one-dimensional. It tasted like the herbs in my loaf were dry, not fresh (again, given the price and promise of an amazing meatloaf this is disappointing).

They come neatly packaged in cupcake tins with a cover and all.  The mother loaf is a big meatball piped with mash potatoes and glazed with a demi-glace. Roma is a big meatball topped with swirls of marinara sauced angel hair. It's novel for sure to have meatballs and sides dressed up as a pretty cupcake but the truth is that the size is pretty small. While I like the Roma quite a bit, I kinda wished that there were a lot more angel hair pasta because it tasted so good. I resent the fact that I have to make sacrifice for aesthetics. And while I got my meatloaf cupcakes for a reasonable price. Their menu advertise a single cupcake for a little under $10, a price that I am not willing to pay until  inflation catches up in 5-10 years.

They knew exactly what was on board and what ingredients made up the scrumptious little loaf. I went with the Herby Turkey and a side of MAC-nificent Pasta. The Herby Turkey was incredible. The meat was packed with tons of herby flavors and fresh veggies. Not to mention, it wasn't the least bit dry! The mac however, left me yearning for more. The portion was tiny and there was certainly a lack of cheese and an abundance of grease.  Since I was feeling loafy and lazy, I decided to grab a couple more meat cakes for dinner. Since my boyfriend is a meat and potatoes kind of guy it was only appropriate that I grab him a Mother Loaf. I decided to go without meat and picked up a Yentl Lentl. Both of them were top notch. The Mother Loaf reminded me of Mom's good old-fashioned meatloaf, smothered in whipped, creamy mashed potatoes. The Yentl Lentl on the other hand made me want to become vegetarian all over again. Lentils, brown rice and veggies? Yep - those are staples in my diet.  The one downfall - These meaty little babies are priced a little under $10 each. I thought the price was somewhat on the high side given that each little loaf is no bigger than a cupcake, and some of them need to be reheated. Either way - my belly was full. My belly was happy.

Things that are hotter than El Fuego: 1) Antonio Banderas 2) Mild chorizo 3) Chicago in January I was expecting flavors along the lines of spicy chorizo and smoked paprika, but instead tasted flavors analogous to your typical burger.  The garlic mashed potato topping was alright, so the experience wasn't an entire wash. Thankfully, I wasn't overly hungry, so one of the Meatloaf Bakery's creations was enough for me.  With each ""cupcake"" in the $8-10 price range, lunch can get expensive quickly if you're looking to feel full.  Although the food isn't the best, the employees are very friendly and efficient.",0.9662,0.777,0.164,0.059,0.635167748917749

We lamented the fact that we didn't have a second groupon because the biggest downside to this place is the price. I understand that good quality ingredients, especially meats, aren't cheap. And if they used cheap quality meat, I probably wouldn't like their products. But that still doesn't change the fact that I can get more food at other places for the same price.

I tried two loafies (mini cupcake versions).  First up, The Mother Loaf.  Your basic meatloaf with a little pillow of taters on top to simulate frosting.  Moist, meatloafy-tasting.  I guess it is what you would expect if you liked meatloaf.  This was supposed to come with a side of demi-glace, but I was not offered any.  The two girls next to me, on the other hand, received more than enough demi-glace for their meatcakes.  Hmm.... Second, Herby Turkey Loaf.  The chunks of red peppers were a little large for this mini-tart.  I would have pared down the brunoise to a more proportionate size.  Again, moist and meatloafy-tasting and missing the cranberry sauce.  Of course, I only realized my condiments were missing after scarfing down the two loafies; otherwise, I would have been requesting my mini-sauce as well.   Also disappointing was the fact that they were out of the Omega-3 Loaf.  At 12PM on a Thursday, you have already exhausted your supply?  Maybe make a few more next week, and I'll be back to try them. I recognized the owner from the framed newspaper article on the wall.  She was very upbeat and engaging, which is always a plus.  It's nice to see someone with a passion, and it's uplifting to see them hard at work, filling the salt shakers and doing what needs to be done to make it work.

The tiny lobby had two mod high tables and chairs and a bakery case with a bustling crew in the background. The cheery folks behind the counter get you in and out quickly. I got the burger loaf which came with a lovely mashed potato swirl on top. The loaf was really good at first but I knew because it was so savory and tangy that it was going to be overwhelming before I could finish - which is exactly what happened. It also contained so much salt that within an hours after I finished my meal I chugged two glasses of water. My body can't handle all the salt.

2011-02-11,4.0,"I am going to preface this review by saying I make a freaking mean meatloaf and have only bought one before in a moment of weakness (we were at a diner after we had spent 4 hours moving into our new apartment and I was starving. Don't judge.). And it of course was, not surprisingly, heavy, somewhat bland, and unsatisfying. I admit I was intrigued though by the Meatloaf Bakery's concept.  Pretty little cups o'meat topped with carb ""icing"" (generally mashed potato).  One ""cupcake"" is generally larger than a standard dessert cupcake, so it is an appropriate single serving, but after seeing the pictures online I wanted to try them all they are so delightful looking.   When I went in they were being slammed with the last few days of Groupon stragglers, and the case was completely empty.  However, the lady who I took to be the owner was extremely apologetic and was trying to make the best of the situation. They were in the process of making new batches, so some of the flavours I was really interested in weren't available.  I ended up getting a Mother Loaf (Beef, pork and veal cozy up to onions, ketchup and a special blend of seasonings and herbs. Topped with Yukon Smashers and meatloaf demi-glace on the side.), a Turkey Loaf (Lean ground turkey with a blend of spices, garlic, red pepper, fresh herbs and a dusting of aged Parmesan-reggiano cheese. Crowned with herby bread stuffing and served with cranberry sauce, of course!) and a Roma Loaf (Gooey fresh mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil and a splash of red wine in a beef and Italian sausage meatloaf. Topped with a swirl of angel hair pasta and served with marinara sauce.) Well, I say I got these three, but I suspect I got 2 Mothers and no Turkey, because boy they looked and tasted almost exactly the same and i didnt get any stuffing, only more potato.   As far as taste, I think they did a good job. The one thing that displeased me was the texture of the meat. It was very smooth and creamy - almost pate-like which was not a personal favourite of mine as I like my meatloaf with some density behind it.  Basically, if you are short on time, or a dud in the kitchen, this is a place to come.  Its a little bit on the pricey side, but that's what you get for shopping in Lincoln Park and not learning to cook for yourself.",0.9741,0.851,0.098,0.051,0.4850536091815162

2010-12-01,2.0,"I agree with Melissa M. below, Meatloaf Bakery is Fun, Creative, and Unique, though unfortunately over priced needs to be added to that list.  Like any respectable mother mine taught me not to judge a book by its cover, but luckily for me meatloaf is not a book and I totally prejudged the Meatloaf Bakery due to its fabulous presentation including whipped potato frosting and of course its adorable website.  My Yelp buddy Lisa T. had a Groupon to Meatloaf Bakery and I was ecstatic when she said she wanted to check it out; I had heard about this place a few months ago and was DYING to try it, I'm mean who doesn't love cupcakes... made of meat? right?  Meatloaf Bakery is a great concept, it is the kind of place you want so desperately to love, it kills you when when you don't fall head over heels. Overall I was not impressed with the Meatloaf Bakery though I have to say the staff who I am assuming were the owners were super nice and obviously hard working.  VERY SMALL store front which houses two small pub height tables, a refrigerated display case holding the precious meatloaf treasure, and a bookcase of Condiments for sale, yes that's all, the rest of the space is the meatloaf kitchen.  Do not plan on eating in, some others said that you need to eat in for the atmosphere, unless the atmosphere your going for is sitting on tall uncomfortable tables and waiting for 15 minutes for them to heat your meatloaf up as you are seated 2.5ft from the door that is the only thing standing between you and the below freezing temps that Chicago has in store for you, then there is no atmosphere to be had here.  They offer 3 different sizes of their meatloaf; loafies which are bite sized meatloaves, cupcakes which are the size of cupcakes ha, and loafs which are like meatloaf cakes, yes apparently that exist . All are presented fabulously, I really wanted to try a loafie or 10 they were just so cute and adorable but I decided that I could not stomach paying $2 for 2 bites of something.  I had the No Buns about it Burger Cupcake: $8.95, Lisa had the Mother Cupcake: 7.95 and we split the MACNIFICENT Pasta Cupcake: 4.95. Our total came to $24.20 which is decent for two people but that is not including a tip for service since we got it to go nor is it including drinks AND we were not stuffed by any means at the end of this meal. The meatloaf is good, though honestly all meatloaf is kinda the same, I mean it is chopped up beef and other stuff, its not like its a steak in which there are different cuts and textures, meatloaf is always tender right ? For $24.20 I am quite certain I could make two whole meatloaf cakes that could myself along with upwards of 10 of my favorite meatloaf loving friends. Just saying.  Other than the meatloaf being just mediocre and not a good value in my eyes it was also quite greasy, mainly the mac and cheese one, I know what your thinking its mac and cheese it never healthy, but when I got them out of the oven and saw the oil surrounding all 3 of them, oil that I would be putting directly in my body, I started to wonder why the Meatloaf Bakery was trying to clog my arteries so fast.  Overall it is the cutest concept around but their prices are just too steep for what you get, I will not be back, Sorry Meatloaf Bakery, really I wanted to love you but I just don't.

A friend was visiting the 'hood, so we ventured down and I must admit that the staff is fantastic and helpful and will answer questions about every single thing on the shelf, as though they haven't answered the same questions three hundred times before in that hour alone.  They get double kudos just for that. There was sparse seating, but we were the only ones there, so it didn't affect us as others have said.  I did think the 15 min wait is a long time, especially if you are just standing there.    I also feel this isn't something to bring home.  I think of it as a novelty to experience on the spot.   I have one groupon left and will bring an out of towner with me next time so they can experience something different.   Overall.  Food good, staff excellent, prices high.",0.9806,0.768,0.173,0.06,0.5007269841269841

What I didn't realize was that it's mainly a shop front and there isn't really anywhere to sit and eat this savory cuppin' cake.  Also, I hadn't realized that it would end up costing me a ridiculous amount of money (like $9 I think?  I try not to remember).  I had the loaf-a-roma, which is like a mini-poorly-proportioned spaghetti and meatball meal.   As for my usual food related conquests, I took a picture.  When I showed it to a friend of mine, the short conversation that we had pretty much summed up the experience: ""Okay, those are definitely meat blobs more than cupcakes. I'm disappointed"" ""Cupcakes are just cake blobs. You are aware of this, right?"" ""You just spent $9 on a poorly formed blob of meat.  You are aware of this, right?""",0.7608,0.891,0.075,0.034,0.4844611528822055

The no buns about it burger loaf was delish- loved the cheesy potatoes on top! came with special sauce (tasted a lot like thousand island), i would have preferred some ketchup instead but was good without it. the chicken shishka loaf was awesome, loved it. loooooved it. came with a lemony/citrusy sauce that i could have dont without but i would def get this one again.  the website made it sound like it was more of a cafe- its actually just 2 bar tables and a few chairs. next time i will get some to take home and heat up because if you eat there its kind of like you're in the way. staff was very friendly tho, checking in and asking how everything was.  i think the price was right. we got $20 off with the groupon and then i think it was another $13 for 3 cupcakes and 2 sodas.

2010-09-26,4.0,"On one of my many jaunts up and down Clark Street, this adorable little place caught my eye.  It's cute.  It's colorful.  And it's a bakery--- wait, what?  Those aren't cupcakes?  They're... meatloaves?  Hm.  My interest piqued, I thought, ""one of these days I'm going to try--- nah.  It's meatloaf.  Blah.  I don't even like meatloaf.  But... those are really cute!  Oh screw it; I'll just ... well... let me think about it,"" and off I went back down the street thinking, ""Meatloaf.  Blah. Cute place, though!"" The above inner dialogue has taken place in my mind no less that half a dozen times over the past few months.  Last night, my curiosity finally got the best of me and I stopped in with a friend to give the old American classic dish a go.   Here's the thing about The Meatloaf Bakery.  Newsflash:  It's.  A.  MEATLOAF.  Bakery.  So when you go in........you're gonna order a meatloaf.  I kind of get a kick out of the people who complain about that.  It's not The Entree Bakery.  It's not The Cupcake Bakery.  It's The Meatloaf Bakery.  Get it?  Meatloaf in the shape of cupcakes with a cute topping of some sort (usually, but not always, mashed potatoes).  It's a theme that intends to show patrons that *yawn* boring ho-hum meatloaf can be exciting and delicious - and on that score, The Meatloaf Bakery delivers.  I'm not sure why people are complaining about the price - for $7 - $9, you get a very hearty meatloaf and a side of potatoes that will leave you in a food coma.  That's actually a little cheaper than what you'd pay at most restaurants for plain, old boring meatloaf with mashed potatoes and soggy green beans.  Standard price for meatloaf at standard restaurant?  $8.95 or more. But enough kvetching - back to me.  And my friend, of course.  We thought the shop was adorable, the food was enticing and, while we wanted to try everything, we opted for one loaf each.  Each loaf is ""themed"" - there's an Omega-3 loaf (salmon with wasabi mashed potatoes), No Buns About It loaf (a cheeseburger with bacon, onions and all the fixin's topped with cheesy potatoes), and so on.  Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I'll admit something:  I was slightly skeptical about the value to dollar ratio in the beginning.  The loaves are deceptively small.  Or so I thought.  My friend ordered the Herby Turkey loaf (a flavorful turkey meatloaf, complete with its own stuffing topping and a side of cranberry sauce) and I opted for the Wing and a Prayer loaf (buffalo chicken meatloaf, fully loaded with creamy bleu cheese, topped with bleu cheese mashed potatoes and a side of.... bleu cheese, yum!!).   The one thing that confused us was that, while we informed the guy at the counter that we would be dining in, he didn't explain to us that it would be a few minutes... we figured it out eventually but it would have been a nice, simple touch for him to just say ""have a seat and I'll bring your food to you in 10 minutes.  I mean, we probably should have just assumed that but, for some reason, we didn't.   Anyway! 10 minutes after seating ourselves, our meatloaves arrived.  I looked at my meatloaf on the little square plate and thought, ""hmm.  Hello, you.  I'm not sure I'm going to be a fan but you're cute and, hey, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?""  and then I took my first bite of meatloaf nirvana.  Holy crap, this thing was GOOD.  Thank goodness my dining companion didn't like bleu cheese - this baby was ALL MINE.  muahahahahaha!  Every bite was an explosion of bleu cheese and buffalo chicken and yes.  It was -that- good.  My friend let me try a bite of her meatloaf - and wow!  A totally different, equally delicious flavor!  I loved that!  I mean... yes, sure, they were both meatloaves but I was actually amazed that they could taste so different yet equally delicious - I mean, you know... it's meatloaf!  Aren't I supposed to be saying ho-hum?  Not so at The Meatloaf Bakery.  And remember how I said I was slightly dubious about the value to dollar ratio?  Yeah, about that.  I was so wrong.  I was so full that I really just wanted to take a nap by the time we walked out.  Not kidding.   Total bill for two entrees and one Hanson's beverage?  $20.  Not pricey at all, if you ask me. My only ""complaint"" (if you will) is that they're not open later!!!!  We want our meatloaf at all hours, gosh darn it!  We can hardly wait to go back to try the Mother Loaf and the No Buns About It Burger Loaf!  I never thought I would say this but yes!

I pay $8-$9 for sandwiches and salads on a regular basis, so why not meatloaf? I finish a sandwich in one sitting and have room for more, but I can barely finish one of these cupcakes--and when I do, I am stuffed! I tried the Wing and a Prayer Loaf and the No Buns About It Burger Loaf, both in cupcake portions. I also tried one of the Chicken Shish Ka Loafies. I will agree with everyone that the loafies aren't worth it--not because they're that small, but because it's the sauce that  makes these meatloaves and you don't get any with the loafies.  They give you some kind of sauce for each cupcake you get and it seriously enhances the flavor. The burger loaf honestly would have been a little bland without the special sauce, and the wing one would have been good, but not excellent, had they omitted the ranch dressing. With the ranch, that wing loaf was amazing! My biggest complaint was that the mashed potatoes are really pretty tasteless. I think they just need some salt though, so it's not major.  Everyone working in the bakery seemed nice. The owner was in there working with the other girls which made me appreciate the place a bit more.

Unfortunately, I'm not sure if I would eat here again without a Groupon because it is a bit out of my price-league. The Meatloaf,  which is really yummy and looks like cupcakes (which is the best part), ranges from $8 -$9 a cupcake. For two of us with two drinks, though, our total came to $25 and when we left we got some soup from Panera to fill us up completely.  PROS The food is delicious. Customer service is awesome. Lots to choose from.  Each type of meatloaf comes with its own special sauce. They do weekly specials with some great flavors of meatloaf. The owner is actually working - she greeted us and told us about her passion to cook. They cook the meatloaf while you wait or you can take it to go or get delivery.  There is indoor seating. The entire establish smells incredible.  They cater. Probably the most creative restaurant I've been to in a while. Easy to find and located in a great neighborhood. CONS Only two tables inside which can make the 15 minute cook-time a little awkward. $9 a cupcake can be a little spendy.  Not super filling. Don't go on a completely empty stomach. No outdoor seating arrangement except a bench. We didn't get a punchcard because we used Groupon.

2010-01-27,2.0,"Anne's Rule of Menu Decision-Making: if I can make it myself, I order something else. But rules are meant to be broken, especially when the menu item in question is an adorable mini meatloaf. Sadly, cute can't compensate for lack of flavor. My usual dining companion and I aren't exactly flush with cash at the moment, so we decided to split one cupcake-sized loaf. A friendly behind-the-counter employee offered us free samples of the Herby Turkey and A Wing And A Prayer loaves to help us with our decision. We weren't inspired to shell out for the larger version of either one.  Lured by the promise of wasabi mashed potato topping, we settled on the inoffensive and unimpressive Omega-3 Loaf. This salmon loaf's pleasantly moist consistency couldn't make up for the fact that it didn't really taste like anything, and neither one of us could detect any of the wasabi that had attracted us to it in the first place. At almost $10 per cupcake, I expect something superior to the patties I make out of canned salmon. And though I appreciated the Tuesday special--a free scoop of mashed potatoes with the purchase of a cupcake--if your menu describes Cheesy Taters as ""bursting with the flavor of cheddar, Parmesan-reggiano and asiago cheeses,"" they shouldn't remind me of the Kraft Singles and instant mashed potato combination I used to microwave for myself as an after-school snack.   I didn't want to write a snarky review of this place.

And then you were still hungry. And now you had to pay for it. It's time to call it a day with all the gimmick restaurants.

We had fun looking at the selection, which was what I wrote above..... all in the shape of a large cupcake. We decided to split 2 of the cupcakes, a meatball one and a salmon one. We were about to order when we saw the price. $9-$10 for a cupcake-sized portion of COMMON FOOD THAT WE COULD MAKE OURSELF???? I don't think so. We felt bad for walking out without buying anything after trying a free sample, so we each split a mini-bite portion (Loafette? something gimmicky-named). Imagine a 1-inch meatball with a tiny croissant around it. Even that tiny thing cost $2. It tasted fine, just like a meatball should taste. But instead of 50c or something reasonable, it was $2.

I made meatballs by the hundreds for my fraternity. So good job, you didn't mess it up. But seriously, $9 for a cupcake and $2 for a meatball?

Joe and I went to eat dinner there, it was around 7, 7:30 because he got off work at 6 and we took a bus up there.  They were closing... And this seemed inconvenient for somewhere that sells meatloaf to be closing so early.  The pet peeve comes from them microwaving the muffins for us to eat there.  I don't really like to microwave food and was scared of how it was going to turn out, but it turned out ok.  Ideally, i think we would go and get a dozen and heat 'em up in the oven :)   I'd still say if you haven't tried it here, to try it.",0.8807,0.848,0.111,0.04,0.7

Who woulda thought there were so many variations on boring ole meatloaf? The meatloaf tasted pretty good. We got the Mother Loaf and The Loaf del Fuego. When I had the sample of the Mother Loaf I was really impressed. But when we got the whole meatloaf, it was disappointingly cold. It made the Loaf del Fuego taste more like the Loaf de Nieve. No, it wasn't that bad- just not as hot as it should have been. We should have just asked them to heat it up more. However, the place seems more geared toward take-home meatloaf in which case the temperature shouldn't be an issue. And based on the samples, they have the potential to be delicious. My only other issue was the price. I get that the place was supposed to be some meeting of low brow cuisine in a high brow presentation, but 8$ for a little cupcake sized meatloaf seems a like lot.

Beginning with the HERBY TURKEY LOAF featuring ""Lean ground turkey with a blend of spices, garlic, red pepper, fresh herbs and a dusting of aged parmesan-reggiano cheese. Crowned with herby bread dressing and served with cranberry sauce, of course!"" I must say I was impressed - an excellent turkey meatloaf with subtle nuance added by the spices plus textural contrasts from the dressing and cranberry sauce the 1.5 bite piece was quite pleasant and if I lived locally I'd certainly consider trying it in a larger portion.   The second choice, OMEGA-3 LOAF featured ""wild caught Alaskan salmon; rich and fluffy with a hint of lemon, parsley and dill and topped with wasabi mashed potatoes and served with fresh lemon-dill yogurt sauce"" and was also quite good with the heavy fish well accented by the lemon and yogurt sauce and just a bit of spice lent from the potatoes.   Browsing the website after our visit I have to say I was amused by some of their ""cakes"" with frosting made of mashed potatoes and would actually love to do such a thing for a potluck sometime.  Cool concept, well executed, good prices, and a heck of a salesman - can't argue with that.",0.996,0.811,0.18,0.009,0.45176651305683563

The food was... well, it was good, but not as awesome as I had hoped from a place with such a cool concept. We tried loafies of the Omega-3, Loaf-A-Roma, and the specialty Lamb.  Omega-3 was made with salmon instead of beef (as one would expect from the name), and apparently in the larger forms comes with a lemon-dill yogurt sauce. It was decent, but not a very strong salmon taste, and we didn't get the yogurt sauce with the mini. Loaf-A-Roma contained mozzarella, sun dried tomatoes, basil, beef, and italian sausage, and was adorable topped with a little swirl of angel hair pasta and sauce. I quite enjoyed this one, and might consider ordering a larger size. However, the Lamb was our favorite.

2009-01-19,3.0,"I must preface this review by saying that as a kid, I at some point decided that I didn't like meatloaf. Then, for years, I never bothered to try it again and kept my stigma against the meaty, loafy wonder that has graced American dinner tables for ages. When my friend asked me to join him for dinner at a place solely devoted to such a food, I was wary. Upon entering I must agree with other reviewers upon the annoyance that there is essentially no seating. Not knowing beforehand and having a group this was rather frustrating, but thankfully there were just enough chairs for all four of us. While I was waiting for my friends to arrive, I was treated to a sample of their special for the day - a loaf made with lamb. The spices were fairly good, but the lamb had a very overwhelming lamb flavor - which means it probably wasn't made with the best meat. But...I'm not a huge baby sheep fan, so I wasn't planning on getting that loaf anyway. I settled on their 3 loafie deal (which, in all honesty, isn't a deal money wise - it's just a way to encourage you to buy three). I had the Loaf del Fuego (ground pork with chorizo, green olives, hot peppers, almonds, garlic and a touch of sherry), the Loaf-a-Roma (mozzarella cheese, sun dried tomatoes, fresh basil, beef, italian sausage, and red wine), and the Wing and a Prayer Loaf (wing sauce,crumbled blue cheese, ground chicken and celery). The Loaf del Fuego was my favorite - not too spicy but having a wonderful flavor and being very moist. The Loaf-a-Roma came in second, and was a little disappointing due to the dryness of the loaf and the spaghetti swirl becoming a dried glob on top. The flavor was good though. Finally the Wing and a Prayer loaf was good but needed a bit more of Buffalo sauce in it. Unfortunately the loafies are not served with any of the sauces in the menu descriptions. Overall, I love the concept. The staff was super friendly and talked to us for awhile while we ate. They have plenty of various types of loafs, as well as a few sides, and even meatloaf sandwiches. AND...they did encourage me to try a food I had been turned off by, and find that I could enjoy it. However, keeping the loafs chilled and then heating them up in a microwave for customers just makes them lose a lot of flavor. Plus, they don't always have what is on their menu, which isn't made clear by their website or menu. Personally I think they should 'half-bake' some of the items, and then be prepared to finish baking them so customers can go home with a fresh baked product. Or maybe even have a way to preorder so you can get a fresh loaf. Overall, I want this place to survive since it is family owned and has decent food. I think they just need to work on their prep a bit more.",0.9975,0.772,0.181,0.047,0.5217619047619049

2009-01-15,3.0,"felt like i was celebrating a holiday when I warmed up our to-go meatloaf, mashies, and mac n cheese. yes the bill was a tad expensive ($40 for a 3 person dinner) and the selection was reather limited to...well meatloaf, but if you like this sort of food you should really give it a try. i had the classic mother loaf and it was spot on. also i'm not sure if the two women running the store were the owners or not but they were incredibly sweet and gave the place an authentic feel. i hope this place makes it so i can enjoy another home cooked meal that i didn't make!",0.9683,0.749,0.218,0.033,0.49980158730158725
2009-01-11,2.0,"Although this place smelled all sorts of delicious when I walked in my appetite was somewhat turned off by the prices of the meatloaf cupcakes.  Since I was on my way to a dinner reservation I decided to only try one of their ""loafies"".  This sample sized portion was $2, which I origionally did not think was bad, but when I could pop it in my mouth in one bite I was kind of sad.  The price for a full sized cupcake was kind of ridiculous, even for Lincoln Park standards.  I could buy a pound of meet and spaghetti and several of my own for the price they charged.  I know that the price is high because they need to sell a lot of meatloaf to pay rent in this area, but maybe they should have thought about that before they opened a bakery dedicated to only meatloaf products.  Also they only have two small high-top tables to sit at... so pretty much if you buy somethign you have to get it to go.",0.4349,0.855,0.077,0.067,0.7597916666666665
2009-01-10,4.0,"We thoroughly enjoyed our meatloaf dinner with four friends... for about $60 we got 5 meatloafs a mac and cheese and potatoes.   We thought the Loaf-a-Roma (spaghetti and meatballs) scored high along with the No Buns About It (Bacon Cheddar Burger).  We picked up the food, heated the loafs (muffins) in the oven for 20 minutes, nuked the taters (add a little butter to the top) and ate our hearts out. To all those who say its overpriced, remember that you have to sell a lot of meat loaf to pay rent in Lincoln Park.   This is a nice way to have dinner at home with no effort and some distinctive food...  god knows we could all use less dinners out in the new economy!

2009-01-06,2.0,"I really wanted to love this place, cause I love meatloaf and I live pretty close to it. Although after seeing the prices, maybe I'm glad it wasn't too fabulous. I went in with my boyfriend thinking we might dine in, but apparently that's not really an option. It was fine though, since we live nearby, so we went ahead and selected our loaves to go. We each got a cupcake - he got the buffalo wing one and I got the bacon burger one. The very nice lady behind the counter had given us samples, and both seemed really good.  We paid our $19 bill (yes, two individual meatloaves is all we got for $19) and headed home to pop them in the oven. They smelled good and I was excited to eat, but somehow they lost their allure with every bite. By the end, we were definitely full, but hardly satisfied. Next time, I'll just get my mom's recipe and make it for myself.",0.9827,0.787,0.187,0.026,0.6025
2008-12-28,3.0,"Very cute concept and space.  Who would have figured you could make meatloaf cupcakes?!?  How come I never think of this kind of stuff? Stopped by this place with a friend because we walked past an were intrigued.  They had samples set up and they were pretty good so we both got one meat-cake thing to go.  I got the Herby Turkey meatloaf cupcake.  It's really enough for two meals so it being close to $9 wasn't too bad.  It kind of sucks that you have to heat the thing on your own in a conventional oven for it to turn out right though.  I'm not a big fan of paying full price for food that you actually have to cook yourself, but eh whatever-I wanted to at least give it a try.  Overall, the meatloaf was very good. It's kind of hard to describe and something you really have to try for yourself.  Don't try to buy any of the baked sweets though.  I saw that they had a freaking $4 cookie.  Not a few cookies for $4, ONE cookie was $4.  Seriously, that's just a crazy markup for what looked like a basic cookie.  So stick with the meat-cake things.",0.8288,0.822,0.105,0.073,0.5349142857142857
2008-12-27,2.0,"I went into the Meatloaf Bakery expecting expensive meatloaf.  After all, this is Lincoln Park we're talking about.  Within 3 blocks of Clark you can get designer cupcakes, pizza, and now...meatloaf.  However, I was intrigued by what seemed to be the Meatloaf Bakery's unique take on meatloaf so I knew I wanted to try the place.   I'm a vegetarian and opted for their macaroni and cheese.  Needing additional comfort food, I got an order of their regular mashed potatoes.  The mac n cheese was delicious!  The mashed potatoes were not that great though.  They were pretty dry and not that flavorful (I had to doctor them up at home with some milk, butter, and salt when I re-heated them). Overall, I'm glad I tried The Meatloaf Bakery.  It's not for everyone and it's definitely pretentious--to make these kinds of foods, which have been traditionally cooked and served at dinner tables across this country because of their inexpensive ingredients, and sell them for Meatloaf Bakery prices is annoying.  I enjoyed most of my meal but I probably won't make a habit out of eating here.",0.7223,0.9,0.069,0.03,0.6769230769230768
2008-12-22,3.0,"i've been curious about this place since the sign went up, but i wasn't sure what to expect. i noticed it had opened (with minimal fanfare) so stopped in after work last week. honestly, i didn't know if it was going to be sweets, dinner food or dog food - really! i just couldn't figure it out. turns out it's exactly how it sounds! a tiny bakery full of different little meat cupcakes. the women who work there are so sweet and helped me pick out my meatcake. i had 'a wing and a prayer' which is a spicy meatloaf with a blue cheese 'frosting' crust. it came with ranch dipping sauce and a teeny tiny bottle of hot sauce - i love the cuteness factor! it's more of a 'take and bake' place...they give you heating instructions along with your cake. there is a couple of tables and they will microwave your cupcake if you want to eat it there. i think they would taste better in the oven, though overall, interesting concept, but the cakes could be bigger for the price ($8-$9). if i have a craving for some comfort food, i'll stop back in.",0.9861,0.78,0.181,0.04,0.4888888888888889
2008-12-17,2.0,"well my boss and i tried it the other day and we both are very disappointed! we work down the street and had been  anticpating a new lunch spot while waiting for it to open, but this will not be it. it is way over priced, for a little bite size meatloaf its $2, you would need to get 6 to fill up and that would cost $12 alone! this is not including a side of mashed potatoes or anything, those are $4.25 for a ice cream scoop!!!! i ordered the vegetarian one which was $9 for a cupcake size and i was displeased to discover mushrooms which were not listed anywhere under ingredients on the menu! the meatloaf was ok, but they serve it COLD!!!! it was a pain to even get it warmed up there..... how is this suppose to be a lunch spot when you have to heat it yourself! we dont have an oven at work!!!! i could have went to a nice sit down restaurant and received the same thing served on real plate and HOT!!!! i think the concept is good, but priced way too high for what you are getting. ill go back once the prices go down......",-0.6502,0.848,0.068,0.084,0.5325673400673401
