I'm not sure if they were just super busy, but the way it worked today was that they would bring out one tray of fresh baked goods at a time and everyone who had been lurking around the register would buy one of whatever it was. As someone who likes choice and predictability, this didn't really work for me. It also gave us a weird slightly Hunger Games-ish vibe to standing around - ""what will they bring out next? Will I be able to get one?"" (note: I never ran into not being able to get something off whatever tray came out).

Instead, it came from a thermos discreetly located to the left of the barista:  Did I get a cup of drip coffee? Yes.  Was it the best cup I ever had? No.  Would I come here again? No-Because if I wanted my coffee to come from a thermos, I can walk the same distance from the Paulina brown line stop to Starbucks and get my thermos-pressed coffee there. Brewed fresh every 8 minutes, too!  My experience at BW made me wonder if anyone can special request a freshly brewed cup of coffee made to order.

The space itself is trendy without trying to be, and Bad Wolf gets bonus points for the TARDIS painted on one of the doors.

They serve Four Barrel beans, which I hadn't had since living in Berkeley - and they bake fresh, organic pastries on-site daily - Jonathan, the owner, has quite the pedigree - and clearly takes this game seriously, as the shop reeks of coffee pretension. And deliciousness. Hidden menu and it changes daily. Don't try to order anything resembling a venti white chocolate chip frappe - go in expecting flat black, drip coffee, macchiato, or cappuccino. Service isn't warm and fuzzy. There is a long bar where you can stand with your coffee and canele and judge quietly everyone else who dares to walk in. As it's just Jonathan who is making drinks and working the register, it is sloooooow - don't stop in if you have anywhere to be in the next 30m, as the line moves at a glacial pace. Drip is $3. Fancier drinks are a bit more, maybe $4-5. Pastries are $4-6, I think. Menu changes daily.

I will never go back, and here is why: Keep in mind this is my first time here. When entering with my sister and exclaiming ""where'd the chairs go?"" In a joking tone, the bearded man behind the counter retorted ""we've never had chairs."" in a serious tone without any explanation for the obvious first time customer--strike one, I didn't feel at home.  Then he asked ""what would you like?"" Now there's no issue with this except that the menu is practically hidden. Not only is not behind the counter like most would expect at a coffee shop, but it's marker written on a small mirror to the left, and let me say there would not be an issue either except for in our search for the menu he offered nothing. No ""here is our menu"" or ""today we have.."" or ""our options include""--any one of those would have aided in me ordering and more importantly feeling accepted as a cavalier customer. Strike two. Then we received our overpriced and undersized cappuccinos without any conversation or hint of care. We looked around silently as the nice music played,(there's ONE good thing).... A minor note, but since the place was vacant minus the bearded man and one customer hovering next to the counter eating a sandwich and fries--Still no seating-- I notice the floor was quite dirty with leaves, dirt, and papers/plastics. He really could have swept, or I could have considering I would have felt more comfortable and valued doing that than just receiving my bland offering of café. Half strike. Then we payed for our cappuccinos and our pastries, blueberry bar and croissant, and left. Not ten feet out the door and we both gave a sigh outward and exclaimed how uncomfortable and awkward we felt. Then we drank our coffee and ate our pastries and felt even more used than before, fore the quality did NOT match the pricing. Strike four. We will never be back again.

This review is solely for their pastries as I do not own the proper taste buds to properly judge coffee. I tried all the pastries they had available for the day which included a pumpkin muffin and a blueberry oat bar. While these were delicious, there were two that slightly changed my life forever. First, the canele. Being the uncultured person I am, I had no idea what it was but my girlfriend insisted she wanted to try it. The outside looks burnt, but it's actually a perfeclty carmelized crust with a little bit of texture that compliments the soft innards. The insides are vanilla flavored and texture-wise, somewhere between bread and pudding (bread pudding?). I could have eaten a hundred of these. But if there's anything I will sacrifice the caneles for, it would be the Kouign-amann (I won't lie, I had to google the spelling). The kouign-amanns here look more like a croissant than some of the other pictures I have seen but to compare the taste to a croissant would be blasphemous. While it does have a similar flakiness on the inside, the ridiculous, crispy texture of the outside, the slightly sweet bites that seem to appear out of nowhere, and the cloud-like interior make this one of the best pastries I've ever had in my life.

Rich, enjoyable flavors without a trace of the unpleasant bitter or burnt notes that make us reach for the sugar. I had a cappuccino, and the milk was perfection as well. Creamy, light, and foamy without being frothy, just the right vehicle for a perfect espresso. A delicious drink with truly no need for sugar, and I say that as a sugar fiend, a dessert before dinner girl who has happily downed more than a few mochas and hazelnut lattes. Honestly, my love for sugary treats is a notch or two above my love for coffee.  So I bought a kouign amman as well.  It was light and flaky, yet also rich and satisfying.

Seems like you could have just sucked it up and gotten a black coffee with soy milk like I offered instead of acting entitled like a place has to make you something special just because you elected to follow an alternative diet a few weeks ago.

You're young and such a rebel. But heads up, if you're going to disrespect someone do it to their face.

2014-03-20,5.0,"So I started coming to Bad Wolf a few weeks ago and I love the place! Let me preface this whole review by saying I'm no expert in coffee or pastries. I just eat what tastes good and go to places I like. I think most people are that way. So here we go: Coffee: It's great. I usually get an americano or just a regular cup o' coffee. The coffee is smooth and not really bitter. I used to always add milk to my coffee, still do at some places, but the coffee here is fresh (?). I'm not sure that's the right description, what I'm trying to say is... there's no overpowering bitterness etc which would be the general reason to use milk/sweeteners. Also, if you're staying try a cortado, them things are superb. Pastries: I know everyone is always talkin about how delicious the cannelle's and kouign-amann (or as I like to call it when ordering ""that sweet croissant thing""). It's true those things are delicious, but my favorite thing is the cheese danishes. I could seriously eat 12 of them in one sitting. They're so good!! The dough is kinda flaky and light and the cheese part GUH I have no words to describe. I never even used to like cheese danishes but these things are so freaking delicious!! You need to try one. For serious. All the other pastries are also super good, I've tried them all, and I've got no bad words to say about you if happen to like something else he sells better. Atmosphere: I really dig the whole no chairs, standing around at the bar/communal table thing. I've been living in Chicago for two years and in the past few weeks I have literally chatted with more random cool people while standing around Bad Wolf Coffee than the entire time I've lived here.

2014-01-20,5.0,"So I just got back from Italy, right? And the thing about being in Italy is that you can wake up at the ass crack of dawn and go to whatever coffee shop and get the most perfect cappuccino for like, a euro. And a pastry for less than that. There's no tables. There's no wifi. There's no mobile work stations set up. People get in, they chug their coffee, and they get the fuck out. It's wonderful. Bad Wolf is like that. There are no seats. No tiny tables where people can set up their laptops. There might be wifi but I didn't ask because I have wifi at my goddamned house. You walk up to the counter and you order and then the owner, Jonathan (who is the same guy you order from and the same guy you pay), makes you your fantastic latte or cappuccino or cortado or whatever. Then you pay and you drink and it's lovely and you think to yourself, ""This is a damn fine cup of coffee."" And it is. If there are still pastries left when you go, order some. If there are multiple varieties, get one of each. And they won't be the type of bullshit you see at Starbucks. No chocolate croissants. Instead, think canelés - a French pastry that takes two days to make and has a glazed/crusted outside and a custardy inside. They're perfect. Only 26 are made at a time and they're fucking perfect and they sell out all the time. So basically. If you find yourself near the Paulina brown line stop and you think to yourself, ""Damn.

The decor is kind of tacky, but I'm sure some people like it. I attribute some of that to the fact that the place is new, so I'll let that slide. The coffee is overall fantastic. Great flavor and the guys really know what they are doing. The weirdest part is that they totally undersell their baked goods. They keep them in the back w/o any signs of descriptions, and when you ask about them, the guys act as if it's like a burden to explain them to you. They use their fancy terminology too, so it's barely helpful. If you do get something, it'll likely be really tasty.

They both failed to notice or at least failed to say anything even though we all were within inches of each other and no one else was in the place. Ordered brewed coffee and if they are so committed to the craft, it seems like someone would have uttered a word about the varietal that was being served that day. Instead, cash guy picks up his little handheld pay device that seems to take the place of an actual cash register; that takes all his attention, like he has no idea that a cup of coffee plus tax is going to cost $3 (it is expensive but I could live with the price if service and accoutrements were better), exactly as it has every other time he has sold one. I was curious about the pastries--they were sitting on a baker's rack behind the counter--no signage to indicate what anything was. It seemed too hard to ask mute guys to explain what they were so I didn't ask. Did ask for half-and-half, though and one of them pulled out a carton of Kilgus--very good sign. Except it was milk and frankly I don't want milk in my coffee--I want half-and-half which doesn't seem like a huge expectation in a coffee joint. Plus he didn't bother to say anything about the milk vs half-and-half switch or even take the plastic safety seal off the unopened carton.

So when I was looking at the desserts, I asked the guy if he could recommend something to me. He immediately said no and apparently that was the end of that for him, and I found that to be pretty strange. And I would have been a little more understanding if I could tell that he was having a bad day, but he was really cheerful with all of the other customers in the shop. But what bothered me the most was that when he was getting the desserts, he didn't use gloves at all to grab them, and he was also taking care of two other customers at the same time, so as he was grabbing our food, he was also handling their cash and credit cards, as well as his smartphone to ring them up, and then going back to the food to cut the canele open and put the lemon curd cream inside. And the entire time I was there, I never saw him wash his hands. I was pretty concerned and a little disgusted. And I understand that he was the only person working there, but i think he should be aware that this kind of disregard for health code really puts some people off.",0.806,0.779,0.119,0.102,0.5299357208448118

I've gone to this place about 5 times since they opened in the summer, and I love it each time.  The Doctor Who references are beyond me since I don't watch the show, though they have a phonebooth painted over the door to the basement if that means anything to anyone.  It's about as bare bones as you can get for a coffeehouse, and the standing room only approach keeps those idiots who like to come write their graduate thesis in public spaces out.   The owner (his name his escaping me) is a cool guy who clearly loves what he does, something that we all really aspire for, and has great taste in music.  I think I've tried everything on the menu, but my usual go-to is an iced coffee, iced tea, and kouign amman.  Yes, I get two drinks because they're small, cheap, and delicious.  I'll probably switch to the cortado once it gets chilly out, which I don't even want to think about as I pen this on a sunny September afternoon.   If this place was on my way to work, I'd probably go 3-4 times a week, but sadly it's not.  Therefore, I make an effort most weekends to get some friends together and go to Bad Wolf, because it sure as hell beats the pants off anywhere else in Lakeview that I can think of.  Actually, scratch that, this place called Starbucks just moved into a huge storefront on Southport and Roscoe...I hear they douse anything and everything in pumpkin spice flavor.",0.9487,0.822,0.122,0.056,0.5685645272601795

My brother and I went this afternoon and everything from the pastries, coffee and service were great.  We snagged the last kouigh amman and two paris brest from what was left. Normally, my brothers reaction to almost everything is, ""It's alright."" So I was shocked when he told me the pastries were delicious and that he wished we had gotten here earlier.  The paris brest was soft and the choux cream (hazelnut?) was luscious. The kouigh amman was good too, maybe my new favorite in Chicago(sorry Floriole) though my favorite is the version I had in Montreal a few months back. Counter Culture coffee was good but I prefer the darker roast I had from Dark Matter. $3 for coffee is overpriced? You can have your watered down $1 cup of McDonalds coffee.  The pastries aren't the overhyped crap like the Cronut, which sells for $5 and up. $2.75-$3 for these delicious pastries feels just about right and I am definitely planning on going back to try the other offerings.   The owner did mention to me that business on the weekends is great but weekdays could be better.  He's hoping for some more word of mouth.

2013-07-26,5.0,"One of the very best coffee shops in the city and my absolute favourite for classic coffee drinks, pastries, and conversation. The only downside is the lack of seating, which is tough on people with disabilities or who work on their feet already, but it's a really amazing place overall. Jonathan, the owner, let me know that the cities rules about seating would have made it another $20k+ to open and there's really not room for him to add the required public restroom in the space (the two go hand in hand, newly opened spots have to have a an accessible public bathroom if they have seating of any kind) but he tried to make it comfy with the high tables and bar area and it makes for a great location to meet new people and chat with your neighbors. Jonathan makes all of the pastries in house and uses organic and local ingredients whenever he can. He makes some great classic American breakfast things like cheddar biscuits and blueberry muffins but what's really awesome are the various regional pastries like kouign amann, canelé, miguelitos, palmiers and more that are pretty tough to find in the city, much less done well. The coffee, from Counter Culture, and tea, from Rishi, are both phenomenal due to the combined careful sourcing of the producers and Jonathan's absolute dedication to his product. He sources different milks from local farms and while you can request whatever you want (2%, whole, 5%, soy, etc), he prefers to pair them with the right drink and roast for best effect. Drinks run $3-4, which it totally reasonable considering what you'd pay around the corner at Starbucks for a lower quality French style burntastic roast. Coffee should be about community and that's really what's going on at Bad Wolf. Local food made by locals for locals. Conversations between friends, neighbors, and strangers alike. It's a kind of coffee experience that hasn't been popular in the US for a while but really should be. When was the last time you talked to the other people in your building?

The first thing we noticed was the sign on the door that read ""Open 6 am-close."" That was the first turnoff. This communicated a lack of seriousness about their business (i.e. that they'll close when they feel like it) as well as a lack of consistency. As a new business, having steady hours is essential for building a clientele. This is especially true in a coffee place, since closing times can run the gamut from 5 pm to 11 pm or later. We still wanted to give them a chance though, so we walked into a rather huge space with no chairs. Not a single one. There was one communal table but nowhere to sit. ""You don't have tables and chairs?"" I asked, expecting some sort of explanation as to why they had not arrived yet or when they would be there. ""Nope."" One of the two guys behind the counter replied.  My husband and I turned around and walked out. We got in our car and headed over to Ellipsis, which also serves Counter Culture Coffee.  They seem pretty confused about what they're going for with this place. On the one hand, they seem like they want to present an alternative to chain coffee places by their use of Counter Culture Coffee and by the obvious pop culture reference in their name. The rather large space indicates that this is somewhere to hang out, not just a coffee stand. Yet, they run their business like they just want to be another ""coffee for commuters"" place, by not having a definite closing time and not having anywhere to sit. Given the size of the space and the likely cost of running a business in Roscoe Village, their business model seems untenable unless some changes are made.  Perhaps they opened before they were ready and what I experienced was not indicative of how they do business. If this is the case, then I'll gladly revisit and write another review should I hear of improvements.
