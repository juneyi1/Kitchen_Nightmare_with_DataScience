2016-08-25,4.0,"So my wife and I ordered a pick up order to go and upon arrival you are greeted by the awesome smokey aroma of BBQ.  We ordered a Papa Q where you get samples from all the different meats they have to offer. Supposedly it's meant for two but holy cow they pack so much good stuff you can easily feed 4 with it.  The meats were tender, smokey and juicy. I had a small issue with the beef brisket, it was a bit on the tough side. If I have to pick my favorites it's a tie between the burnt ends and Texas sausage which is pretty spicy the way I like it.  The mashed potatoes with brisket gravy was very savory, you shouldnt pass this up when it comes to sides. Bbq baked beans was delicious and the cornbread was sweet but not overwhelming.  The mac and cheese was ok but I didnt care for the Cheeze-itz like crumbs on top. They forgot our order of hush puppies. An infraction I would have taken an issue with but all in all the experience and food is top notch. If youre in the area I highly recommend Q.",0.991,0.768,0.209,0.024,0.6514583333333333

So, when the Lakview location of Q-BBQ opened, I was thrilled- first visit, got a the burnt ends sandwich, thought it was really good. 2nd trip, same thing, not as good as the first time, but close. Tonight, I came back and got a slab of baby back ribs- last I was there they gave me a 5 dollar of coupon, I was close by, called my order into go- they said it would be 10 minutes- perfect- I was there in 10 minutes. Upon arrival, was told, it would be a few more minutes- 6PM on Thursday, place was empty. 3 people behind the counter, all seemed confused.  As I waited for my order, one of the counter people put a bag of to-go food in the warmer.  After waiting for about another 7-10 minutes- the guy behind the counter took out the bag from the warmer, it was my order all along.   So despite that my order was ready as I walked in- I had to wait- cause the counter people are just not paying attention. The guy even asked me what my sides were again...geez- The ribs were meaty, just fair at best, I found the sweet Memphis Sauce to be kind of dry and too thick.

2016-04-20,4.0,"A few weeks ago a friend and I were wandering down Diversey looking for a place to grab lunch. We stumbled upon Q-BBQ and decided to give it a try. We were greeted immediately by the host who handed us menus. Neither of us had been there before so we needed extra time to familiarize ourselves with the menu. I didn't make it past the brunch menu. What caught my eye were the brunch sandwiches partially because they have eggs on top...and I'm a sucker for brunch. I opted for the BBQ brisket brunch sandwich with an egg while my friend opted for the BBQ burnt ends brunch sandwiches. The brunch sandwiches all come with garlic butter Parmesan fries. We sat down at our table and waited for our meals. When the food arrived it looked delicious. The meat was well cooked and tasty and truth be told I didn't use much sauce because the meat itself was seasoned and cooked well. I do like that Q-BBQ has a variety of sauces with different bases. I'm not much of a Carolina BBQ fan only because I dislike mustard but there were other sauces which worked just great. And the egg on top was a perfect topper! I also tried my friend's burnt ends and those were good too. As for the Parmesan fries, they were addictive and I could have eaten the whole pile but I practiced great self restraint and finished about half. The staff were also very attentive cleaning up our trays, asking how our food was, checking in, etc.  Would I go back? Yup! I'm not a big fan of Q-BBQ being a chain however it's pretty solid BBQ nonetheless. Next time I won't try the sandwiches though but rather the sliced brisket or perhaps the ribs or burnt ends.

What is the good news?  Well, when I asked about the missing mustard sauce, a manager-looking guy told me the bad news, but offered me a free unopened bottle that they had squirreled away in the back.  I didn't mention to him that I had driven all the way from the northwest suburbs--on pseudo-Saint Patrick's Shit Show Saturday, no less--with the intention of purchasing a few bottles to take home.  But he must have seen the heartbreak in my face.  How is that for exceptional customer service??

2015-12-15,1.0,"I never thought I would experience a BBQ place that tastes worse than Wrigley BBQ. My overall thought of Q-BBQ is that I want my money back. Like most BBQ joints it's a little bit pricer and they have a ton of signs around the room claiming to be the best BBQ place. Where do I begin...I guess I'll start with the positives since that list is much smaller.  I like the way that Q-BBQ is setup. I'm a huge fan of any place that has a ton of booth options around the room. The restaurant is extremely spacious so it would be great for big groups. Now let's get down to the reason I still want my money back after dining here. I think I made better drunk food in college than this restaurant serves on their best day. I'm a huge lover of mac-n-cheese so it was a definite must that I order it as my side. I wasn't sure which meat to order so I ordered the trio sliders. This is a great idea because you can choose three different meats to taste out.  I was excited to get my food and enjoy the greatness to come. I wish I could travel back in time to the moment when my friend and I was searching through Yelp to find a place to eat.  When our food arrived I was still very optimistic. I was slightly turned off by the mac-n-cheese because it looked like it came straight out of a kraft box with cheez-its crushed on-top. I moved past that because the sliders looked delicious and I was ready to chow down. I bit into the first one, which was the pulled chicken slider, and instantly felt dehydrated. It was so dry that I almost poured my beverage on it to relive it. To quote my friend, ""it was so dry that I drank two glasses of water and still felt thirsty."" Unfortunately he got the regular sized pulled chicken sandwich so I watched him choke down as much as he could.  I had two more sliders left so I was still optimistic. The next one up was the burnt ends. I've had some great burnt ends before it's hard to mess them up. The crispiness of the burnt ends is what makes them appealing to me. But Q-BBQ managed to take the concept of burnt ends to another level. They burnt the ends way too much! The meat was dried out and it was so salty.  By the time I moved onto my last slider I was dang near praying that it would make the entire experience worthwhile. I was mistaken because it was the one sliders that I couldn't even stomach, it was the pulled pork. I don't think a bucket of sauce could've saved my poor sliders. I forgot to mention that I could've held open the door with the bun they provided with my slider based off how hard it was. I'm not sure how they got rated so high but I wouldn't let me worst enemy eat here. I might have to revisit Wrigleyville BBQ now that I know there is a place that is far worst than them. Please don't waste your money dining here. Visit the Trader Joe's up the street and buy your own BBQ if you are craving BBQ that badly.",0.9867,0.82,0.128,0.052,0.505980315980316

I opted for the pulled pork with sides of spicy brussel sprouts and green beans- you know, to keep it healthy. The green beans weren't as flavorful as I'd hoped, but they seemed to stay on the lighter side of the caloric scale, so I appreciated that. The brussels sprouts were delicious, but of course, it was because they were doused in the oil they were roasted in. I enjoyed the flavor so much, however, especially the spicy kick coming from the jalapeno peppers, that I forgave the added fat. The meat itself was both good and ok- depending on which piece I was chewing on at the time. I cleaned my plate so I definitely tried all of it- and I had some fairly dry and tough pieces mixed in with the more tender, delicious ones. I enjoyed their selection of BBQ sauces- especially when mixing the sweet and spicy (and spicy is really spicy so watch out!). I had a bite of the hush puppies and didn't find them to be worth the deep friedness- thankfully, they're small, so if you like them, your heart will probably be ok.

2015-09-13,3.0,"Let me start off by saying that I've only ever eaten barbecue prepared by my family at various cookouts in small town, Alabama. So my bbq expectations stay high.  The way this restaurant works is that you go up to the counter, order and pay for your meal, then they bring your food out to you. Simple. I ordered a pulled pork sandwich, which comes with two hush puppies and your choice of side. There are specialty sides that you can purchase at extra cost, but I opted for the mac n cheese.  The Pros: - There wasn't too long of a wait for the food. That could vary on a far more crowded day.  - Very friendly waitstaff, but not that annoying, bother you every few minutes friendly.  - The music. Temptations, Four Tops, Smokey Robinson and the Miracles? YES. YESSSS! - Price. For my food, along with a beer, I paid about $14.  - From what I could see, solid little beer selection.  The Eh's: - The pulled pork sandwich was decent, but I wasn't in love with it. It wasn't too dry, but it could stand a bit more flavor....though I will say that they do have an array of sauces on the tables, so I guess I could have made it more flavorful myself. My friend had some sort of sausage, now that was pretty tasty.  The Kind of Cons: - The mac needed more flavor. It wasn't bad, but bland. And there were crumbled up Cheez-its on top....I like Cheez-its as a late night snack, I do not understand them on top of my mac. I should have gone with my gut and sprung for the brussel sprouts.

They give you two hush puppies with every dish but they are way too good to just have two. Once mine were a little cold but then I complained and got a new batch right out of the fryer. I suggest you do too if you get cold ones. The sizes can be a little inconsistent too, they should be about the size of a thumb (albeit a fat one) but I have been given pinkie sized ones too. I wish they were all fat thumb size though, and they usually are. The Sweet sauce is the best sauce. I pour about an ounce or so on top of the sandwich and another ounce for dipping the hush puppies in. I usually alternate dipping in the sweet sauce and some extra aioli, that I always ask for on the side. It's very good. I only wish they had an outside seating area.

The others were just alright, and Boyfriend couldn't figure out what made the ""spicy Texas"" very Texas-y (it's hot in Texas? ""spicy""=""hot?"").  I'll just go ahead with letter grades here for the rest of the food items: Pulled pork: Solid B+ Brisket: D (dry, clearly not done right) Burnt ends: C- (inconsistently tender, not very crunchy on the outside, likely came from the crummy brisket...and there should be no need to coat burnt ends in sauce. Ever.) Mac and cheese: meh Baked beans: B+  Green beans: B (no ham?!?!?) Cornbread: sweet (take that as you will) They do have Shiner Bock and Ruby Red which made Boyfriend very happy.

I ordered the Pulled Pork plate with Q Slaw and MaQroni. They have your typical soft drink selection - coke products and Dr. Pepper, along with some killer iced tea.  Though the restaurant wasn't busy, I waited about 15 minutes for my plate to come out. When it did arrive, the pulled pork was kind of lukewarm. However: it was so tasty, I didn't really mind.  Pulled pork was the perfect balance of smoky but not over smoked. We've all had BBQ that tastes like you're eating hickory twigs in the past, right? There was a selection of barbeque sauce on the table (mustard, vinegar, sweet, hot), and the vinegar sauce went super well with the pork.  The MaQroni was really good. Cheesy, with a topping of crushed cheez-its. Surprisingly tasty. The coleslaw was meh. Same coleslaw you can have at any fast food restaurant. The huspuppies were really quite dissapointing: fried cornmeal mush, no spicing to it. Really greasy and not super fresh.  tl:Dr : service was friendly but slow.

The sauces are pretty standard fare. One was sweet, one was spicy (a bit of a nose runner but not without a great flavor), one was vinegar based, and the last one was South Carolina mustard (yuck ).

Even their sauces were radical in their flavors.  They have one for a spicy sauce, one for a vinegar sauce, one for sweet, and one for mustard.  Every single one of them was so far off-the-charts of the flavor they advertised that it totally blew any other flavor that existed there out of the water.  In essence, any semblance of balance was nonexistent.  As a result when you poured some of any of the sauces over the meats, you lost the flavor the meat altogether, especially when most of the meat had little to no salt on it to begin with.

Unfortunately, I just don't like the sauces and the wings leave something to be desired. The 'spicy bbq' sauce is too sugary and not spicy to me at all. The spicy wings also aren't spicy. The other sauces are also too sugary and don't give me the southern bbq feel I hope for. I will try it again in the future in hopes they improve the sauces and offer a meat that lives up to the spicy designation.",0.9721,0.76,0.199,0.041,0.5503540903540903

2015-01-17,5.0,"This place is so legit. I lived by the original in LaGrange since its debut, but this one takes the cake. I'm a big fan of the OG, but the Lincoln Park location is amazing.  I am so sick of their brisket, so I got burnt ends. Not loving them when I had them in the burbs, I was hesitant, but they were bomb. And this location has more side options. I hate their fries, so I love the multiple other side choices. Their mashed potatoes, Brussel sprouts and green beans are amazing. And I never order veggies as a side.  This location is huge and beautiful, and has brunch. My LEAST favorite meal ever, but they make it sound delicious. The 1 thing I have to address is the price. I spend a ton of money on food, but I'm blown away by the numerous reviews of the ""value"" here. My daughter and I easily spend $60 plus dollars every time we come, with not much left over for lunch. To me, BBQ is an inexpensive dining experience.

2015-01-05,4.0,"Finally checked out this place as we were hungry and in the area. It was 4pm Saturday so it was not busy at all.  I loved the setup and feel of the place. For some reason, I was expecting a hole in the wall. But the place was quite spacious, clean, and inviting. I get the spicy wings with mashed potatoes and baked beans, as bf gets the full rack of ribs with mashed potatoes and cornbread. Each also came with 2 hushpuppies (Q-pups).This place is half service, in that you order your food and they bring it out to you. Our food comes out in about 5 minutes. They gave us an order of fries instead of the mashed potatoes and when my bf asked about it, the lady said no problem and brought us out an additional mashed potatoes. That was really nice and we ended up getting to indulge in the fries as well, which very tasty and well-seasoned. Mashed potatoes were also very good, along with the baked beans. The wings were quite unique and I give props for that. It was nice to see a generous amount of wings (although the price was appropriate). I loved the texture as they were perfectly crispy/chewy on the outside but chicken was super moist, nearly falling off the bones. While it was super tasty, I can't say I would get it again, as I found the rosemary to be overpowering. Bf found his ribs to be pretty tasty but while falling off the bone, it was still a little dry. He attributed this as to probably getting the 'leftovers' from the brunch hour (which ended at 3). He still enjoyed them, although def not the best he's had. He really liked the cornbread and mashed potatoes as well. What I was probably most disappointed in were their sauces. I tried all the usual four, and found all to be pretty lackluster or 'off.' I would have liked them to taste more traditional. I did like that they tell you what each sauce should be paired with. My favorite part was that each table had their own roll of paper towels and there was a sink in the middle of the restaurant to easily wash your hands. Also by the sink, was your own self-help station, equipped with to-go boxes, wet naps, and other helpful items. Overall, I would love to come back with a group of friends or anyone really and try some other items on the menu.",0.9965,0.794,0.172,0.034,0.610530303030303

The Good: The Sauces were all pretty good. The Memphis Sweet is loaded with brown sugar.  Try the Texas Spicy for a late peppery blast.  Hush puppies and fries were good.  And, I thought the people working there will energetic, efficient and nice. The Bad: The Sliced Brisket tasted like it was parboiled too long (not smoked) OR three days old, reheated in a microwave - very tough and chewy.  The Brisket Burnt Ends were better, but a few chunks were not so tender.  The pulled pork was average, but not very smoky.  The beans seemed canned with some ingredients added - see ""Semi-Homemade Cooking"" with Sandra Lee on the Food Network. The Funny: The day I was there, they had no breads - no buns for sandwiches or sliders, etc.  The employees forewarned me of the bread issue saying they had not planned for the amount of business they received that day.  It was Jan. 2; no one may have been there the day before?

2014-11-10,4.0,"Ironically, I found this place on Yelp. I had some family come over and visit my new apartment and we decided to go out to eat. Dad asked if there were any BBQ joints around here and I remembered passing by this place. I had no idea if they were good or not, so we decided to hit up Yelp to help us decide. We saw some good ratings and pics of tasty-looking food and were sold.  This place is actually walking distance from my apartment, so instead of taking a chance on street parking, we footed it. As soon as we walked in, we were surprised by the warm, cozy feel of the place. I really didn't expect that. We ordered and sat down. What's different about this place is that it's not exactly fast-foodesque, but it's also not a sit-down restaurant either. This place is right smack dab in the middle. You walk up to the counter to order and they bring your food out to you. The service was great, the staff was all super nice. I will say that they had a strange mix of music genres playing. During our visit, we seriously heard everything from old country to Diana Ross to James Brown. I guess they want variety in their music! The food was delicious! I got the pulled pork sandwich along with their Bacon Mac-Q-Roni. The mac was pretty cheddar-y, which isn't a bad thing. Just different. The pulled pork was pretty good, but felt a tad bit dry. Their sauces, however, helped to make up for it. My favorite was the Memphis Sweet. I tried one drop of the Texas spicy and boy, was it spicy! The North Carolina Vinegar one was good, but a little on the watery side. And the only one I didn't try was the South Carolina one because the whitish color kind of scared me..  Another thing I liked was the fact that they had a sink right out near the drink/condiment station, so people with sticky BBQ fingers can wash their hands. All in all, this was a pretty good place! And I was pleased to find out they deliver, too! Tip: the Sweet Tea isn't very sweet. But their amazing cornbread more than makes up for that. :)",0.9976,0.753,0.209,0.037,0.6432526259270444

2014-10-25,4.0,"nomnomnom. My friend and I came in for dinner around 6pm on a Friday, and it was actually relatively quiet - not too many people around. I had the pulled pork with cornbread and salad, and she had a half rack of ribs with fries and salad. Neither of us actually touched the salad, claiming we were too full, but in reality it was a pretty sad salad - all iceberg lettuce, pale tomatoes and carrots. I mean, most people don't come to a BBQ place and get salad. That's cool. I get it. Luckily, the rest of the food more than made up for it. The pulled pork was awesome - definitely helped along, too, by the four sauces they offered: South Carolina style mustard, North Carolina style vinegar sauce, Texas style spicy sauce, and Memphis style sweet. I actually liked every single one of them, though I'm generally pretty loyal to NC-style barbecue. The cornbread was also wonderful - fluffy and sweet, and even better when topped with some butter. Service was fantastic - well, whatever service is possible when you're ordering at a counter. Every employee we talked to was wonderfully nice and helpful, really going the extra mile for us. My only gripe (preventing me from giving five stars) was the price. For my pulled pork platter and a fountain soda, the price was $16 - plus $2 for tip. (I honestly don't know if it makes sense to tip at a place like this. For example, when I order takeout, I never tip because I'm not receiving any service. When it's a sit-down place, I tip because someone is refilling my water, bringing food to me, and bussing the table. Q-BBQ is kind of a weird amalgamation of the two - you order at the counter, but the food is brought to you and cleared for you when you're done.) But anyway, my total bill came out to $18, which is pretty steep to me for a casual place like this (and all I'm really getting is some pulled pork and a piece of cornbread). I've been to comparably good places that aren't as expensive, so I'm not sure. Regardless, I would be remiss not to recommend Q-BBQ. Food, atmosphere, service, all wonderful - definitely worth a visit if you're in the neighborhood.",0.9985,0.731,0.242,0.027,0.6584287603930461
2014-10-25,2.0,"My on-going mission:  to seek out new BBQ, and new flavours; to boldly go where no foodie has gone before....  I Could not let this place go undiscovered, so I took the plunge. I always get suspicious when I read '' voted best'' or if I  see TV channel endorsements, but why discriminate?  I walked in and was sort of put off the the decor as it seemed a bit - ''planned'', sort of like a Panera bread feel to it actually,...maybe corporate looking?  but I really dont care about ambiance if the grub it good so let us continue. Ribs: very, very tender yet not slimey. My rule in the BBQ rib world is this: tender does not = great BBQ, it is a componant! Flavour was good but not earth moving and my issue is this:  no smokey flavour at all. They seemed like they were cooked in a crock pot and had sort of a boiled pork taste. So, lets rate the ribs at a 7.5 Fries: useless. short stuby uneventful, and my instinct tells me they were pre pre-fried, then set aside, until service. I rate these things at a generous 3.0 Mac and Cheese: boring. dry. below average. Dont even bother with a rating of 2.9 Cole slaw: one step above the Jewel deli, and that does'nt say much.   Brisket, chopped: decent.... tender but has quite a bit of fat nubbies in it. Same crock pot boiled pork flavour. And it was more like ground brisket than chopped. If I am in good spirits, I will hand out a 4.1 for a rating. They clearly have a skill ( or a connect someplace ) in marketing themselves and getting publicity, and I can see why these establishments are sucessful as the general public is pretty easy to please.

Walking in the door, I was happy to see a nice, clean-looking space.  Tastefully decorated, yet I felt that it was missing something.  Ah, ha...the fragrance of smoke!?  I have long-ago learned that if you don't at least SMELL the smokers in the restaurant, you're destined to be disappointed with the meats.  Alas, I was disappointed. I ordered a two meat platter, brisket and pulled pork.  I figured that a decent bbq would at least do one of them right!  Not in this case.  While visually appealing, I found the brisket to be dry and lacking any smoke flavor at all.  As a matter of fact, I couldn't taste much of anything in the way of a rub either.  Luckily, the Texas sauce was pretty good at adding both moisture and flavor to the disappointing slices.  I then moved over to the smallish scoop of pulled pork on the other side of the tray.  Oh, oh... 0-2!  I found the pork to also be tasteless and overcooked- almost to the point of ""mushiness"".  No sign of bark, no sign of seasoning, no sign of taste.  I proceeded to add a ample amount of Carolina sauce to it, and at that point found it pretty flavorful.  Problem is, I go to a bbq to taste the meat and the blend of meaty texture, seasoning, and smokiness that are signs of a good bbq.  If I wanted to enjoy the sauce, I could have had it on sliced bread- only there is no bread served with the platter (and I paid for this meat...) My sides were good (mac n' cheese & cole slaw), but really small portions for a $17 platter.  The Q-puppies were also pretty tasty.   All in all, a boing experience in a pretty boring bbq city.  Though many places have opened in the last five years, there are VERY few that would pass muster in a real bbq city.  Add this one to the list.  Not great, barely good!",0.9699,0.826,0.113,0.061,0.6370363408521303

The crown jewel of late summer- the first day of college football-was upon us and nothing but BBQ was going to fit the bill. So we stopped in Q for lunch and ordered from the counter, rather than a server. I went with the $11.99 plate with one meat and two sides plus hush puppies, and the mister had the $8.99 slider trio with a side and hush puppies. We went with sweet tea but they also have a nice selection of beers and root beers available.  While we waited, we snacked on pickles and taste-tested the BBQ sauces available at the self-serve counter next to the sink. At first I thought the sink was a little much, until I realized that sometimes BBQ happens... and when it does, you need soap and water lickety-split. Smart. The other really smart thing Q did was not only put the reel of brown paper towels on the tables and by the self-serve station, but they bought perforated ones. Now I know what you're thinking, ""Um, why is this weirdo noticing the paper towels..."" but honestly, I friggin' hate using the brown paper towels because they are so dag on annoying to tear off. There's always that obnoxious tail left, which is utterly useless. And then I'm frustrated because the paper towel looks messy so I have to tear the tail off and end up making a way bigger tail on the TOP of the roll.... and thus the OCD cycle begins and effectively ruins my dining experience. I can't be the only one that this has happened to... right? Right guys?? In short order, our food arrived. I had a whole mess of chopped (sliced available too) of brisket, and the Mister had a three types of meaty sliders to chomp on. The brisket was good. Very good. Not too fatty, already sauced, and absolutely succulent. I had a good time mixing the North Carolina sauce with the Carolina mustard sauce to make an awesome dip for my corn hush puppies, which were little fried balls of heaven, I tell you. For sides, I had the spicy brussel sprouts and the mashed potatoes and gravy, and the mister had the mac and cheese. The brussel sprouts were bomb. Crispy, flavorful, and lightly fried, I think? I wouldn't have minded them being cut in half, because I'm dainty, but I managed. The potatoes and gravy were just like home. The mac and cheese had a crunchy topping of Cheezits. CHEEZIT mac and cheese topping, people. Total game changer.  If Q had TVs, I'd say this was the perfect spot to cozy up and stuff yourself full of saucey BBQ goodness, but alas, I don't think that was the goal they were going for. It's more family-oriented than screaming-at-the-TV-in-a-beer-and-BBQ-rage kind of joint. They do deliver, but... I don't have perforated paper towels.

Everything about our visit was underwhelming...we started out fair and quickly went downhill after food arrived to the table. The space is nice when you walk in. We were a little confused initially, not realizing you order up front, but this was soon remedied by friendly staff. Overall service and atmosphere rate a solid 4 stars. The menu looks good on the wall. There were a lot of choices, but we narrowed it down while moving through the line. Prices were fair for the most part as well. Food arrived to our table in a timely manner. Here's where things fell apart; the food was a total letdown. I had the two meat platter with brisket and pulled pork. The brisket was tough and dry. Pulled pork (one of my favorite things ever) was bland, dry, and not all that ""pulled."" Not to mention I picked out numerous fatty lumps from my plate. The sides were redeeming, but only to an extent. I had the baked beans and cornbread, both of which were tasty but only marginally better than something from a box/can. Fiancé had the Mac & cheese side, which was unremarkable and also rather small (think 3 bites and you're done). This same portion felt more appropriate for the beans. Fiancé's Carolina pulled pork sandwich- made Q style- was also disappointing. The toppings (Gouda cheese and cole slaw) were complementary, but his meat was no better than mine.  In an attempt to improve things at the table, we taste tested the Q sauces available. Again, a great disappointment. The sweet sauce was sugar overload, the Carolina vinegar was overwhelming vinegar, and the spicy Texas BBQ had a little kick but lacked well rounded flavor. All of the sauces lacked depth, you can find better in the grocery aisle. By the end of out visit, we walked out, discussing snacks at home for later.",0.9826,0.785,0.145,0.07,0.5669973544973544

Ok, and it's not like I ""know"" barbecue.  I mean, I grew up in Northeast Ohio.  Barbecues to us are family parties where we invite all our friends and family over, light up the gas grill, and throw mounds of burgers and wieners on the racks.  And they're all store bought meats, not anything formed by the cook and seasoned with their own special recipe.  And then they use cost-cutter buns because ""they're half the price but not half the flavor"" and use boring toppings because people from those parts don't crave adventure, just food.  Really, the only reason I even have a bit of y'all in me is because of my extensive travels to the South for work.  Oy. I like a bit of spice with my sauce and this delivered.  4 sauces to choose from, one I avoid (mustard, eek), all a blast on the taste buds.  The Texas Spice has kick like the cowboy boots I picked up in Dallas, and the vinegar sauce found itself all over every bit of my food. Oh, the food.  The pulled chicken sandwich, add bacon, is a meat bonanza.  Piled high, so come hungry.  Or come half-hungry and take half home.  Don't share with friends, it's too good.  I ordered mine without the slaw because it's mayo-based and ain't nobody got time for mayo.  The green beans are full of flavor and full of not healthy, but that's ok, cause they're the bomb.  If you skip them, you nuts.  The Q pups?  I mean, they're bread.  Whatever.  Dip 'em in sauce and you've got yourself some flavored bread.  MMM. For dessert we went with small sides of the burnt ends.  MEAT FOR DESSERT?  Chyeah.  They were so good I could have shoveled a truckload of them into my mouth.  And I would have if I had not eaten a whole meal earlier. $30 for two full meals.  No leftovers, cause I am a fatty.",0.1979,0.833,0.082,0.085,0.5274914965986396

There's a handwashing station as well, and I believe that they make their sauce in house) I've also had their memphis wings (could be larger but not terribly small) and their side of mashed potatoes and baked beans. Both sides were great but they do run a little small and it's about $3 for a large side. The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because I think their meat could be more flavorful and I was dissapointed in the size of their wings.

The two star rating applies to only one meal I have eaten at this establishment. I think it has potential, so I do plan to return and try something else. I ordered the chopped brisket plate which comes with hush puppies and two sides. I selected mashed potatoes and cornbread. I also ordered an iced tea. There were two problems with the chopped brisket. It was super fatty, and topped with a sweet vinegar sauce. I only ate about half of it, picking around the fatty bits, desperately searching for a bite of meat. The sauce wasn't terrible, but I would have definitely preferred it without. The mashed potatoes were fine, nothing spectacular, but not bad either. The portion size was small though. The cornbread tasted like yellow cake with a hint of corn flavor. It didn't taste bad, but it wasn't a hearty cornbread that I was hoping for. It was also served cold. The hush puppies were actually good, but it felt kinda weird eating them with barbecue. These are almost exclusively served with seafood in Texas. The shining star from my meal was the iced tea. It was brewed fresh and sweetened while hot. And though it wasn't nearly as sweet as you might find in the South, I consider that a good thing (I still cut it with half a glass of unsweetened tea.)

I like the fact they have a condiment section where you can add your own pickles and sauces. The end sandwich was delicious and I tried all the different BBQ sauces on the table. The only thing I would recommend, is NOT getting the ""slaw"" on top of the sandwich. I thought it was going to be a side but, they put it on the sandwich which gets pretty messing. Mac 'n cheese was smooth and cheesy. Q crumbles Cheez It crackers, mixes them with some butter and adds them as topping to the mac 'n cheese. Yummo!

They were exactly what I want in rib tips. Nice and crunchy.  The pulled pork...ehh. It was ok, it seemed to already have a sauce on it and was a little soupy looking and while I know it is BBQ, our portion had loads of fat. Definitely too fatty. I prefer the Carolina sauce on this even though it isn't a true Carolina sauce it is tasty.  The mashed potatoes were good as was the coleslaw.  Nothing to write home about but nothing to complain about.  The hush puppies or Q-pups were disappointing to me.

While you're ordering at the counter, someone else is helping find you a table, pretty seamless process.  For dinner, I went with the mix-n-match sliders. I simply couldn't decide between one sandwich and was pleasantly surprised when was allowed to order the sliders ""Q Style."" This is definitely different from most BBQ places I've been to, the addition of toppings such as slaw, gouda, and bacon definitely strays from your traditional BBQ. However, the sliders were by far the best part of my meal. I went with the spicy sausage that was prepared with Carolina mustard, pulled pork that had a vinegar sauce, and the Texas brisket, also with a vinegar sauce. All three sandwiches were fantastic, filled with flavor, moist meat, great toppings. I think the pulled pork takes the cake though. I definitely recommend trying the sliders so you can sample a little of everything. I give Q's sliders a 5, but have to drop the rating down because I feel like the sides were lacking. The Q pups, like hush puppies, were probably our favorite side. However, the cornbread, mashed potatoes, and bacon mac 'n cheese were all a little lacking, almost bland.

2014-04-23,3.0,"Solid, if unspectacular, BBQ fare.  I did a three-meat platter (sliced brisket, pulled pork, burnt ends), with the baked beans side and the spicy brussels sprouts.  (We weren't even given the Q-Pups, so shame on me for not following up and shame on Q for not giving us all of our food!) The sprouts were pretty tasty, as were the beans.  Meats were nothing special, but the burnt ends were the ""best"" of the three I tasted.  What was really tasty?  The sauces...in fact, these give Lillie's Q a run for my favorite BBQ sauce selection in town.  (Note:  Lillie's Q also had pretty average to average+ meats, so maybe that's the thing--if the sauces are really good, the meats aren't???) Space was huge, staff was friendly, ordering Chipotle-style from the menus was easy.  Portion size was just right (i.e., just a little short) with the three-meat platter for two people, and we dropped about $24 for all the food plus a soda to share.  After you've been to Smalls, Smoke Daddy, Smoque, or Green Street (haven't hit the latter, but I'm hearing good things), Q doesn't register on the top-tier of smoked meats, but I might go back if I'm in the 'hood.",0.9774,0.806,0.146,0.048,0.4828798185941044

2014-04-20,3.0,For BBQ not my favorite. It's definitely fast food BBQ. Ordered the Q sampler platter with two sides. The chicken and turkey were good. The burnt tips good. The pulled pork and beef very average. Sausages good. My critiques come with the wings for the most part because they came dusted in granular sugar. I didn't care for the cloying sweetness and the grittiness from the sugar. Just too sweet and unnecessary in my opinion. The Mac and cheese is made with a velveeta type cheese and is not my favorite considering all the real good Mac and cheese in Chicago. So- I won't go back because it just doesn't suit my taste buds.

2014-04-15,3.0,"I finally mustered up the courage to try my second Chicagoland barbecue joint (with the much-acclaimed Smoque first on my list), choosing to venture up to Lakeview to check out the new outpost of Q-BBQ. According to the Internets, this is Q's third location, having mastered success at its original outpost in La Grange and opening a second shop in Naperville. As with my Smoque review, my huge caveat applies: I'm from Texas and am grading on a steep curve. Q-BBQ is so fresh and so clean, in a sort of sterile, faux-country way I'm not really sure you want to see in your BBQ joints. I'm sure city limits prevent access, but I saw no smoker and smelled no smoke. Like prior to my initial Smoque visit, I had just done a tour (my second) to the fantastically delicious Pappy's in St. Louis, where no smoker exists in plain sight but the wafting smell of smoked meat lingered in the air. That, my friends, is how a barbecue place should smell. As for the menu, the a la carte offerings might be a plus to a hopeless wanderer, but I'd rather Q stand for one thing in particular. As it is, their menu offers a smorgasbord of stuff: Texas brisket and sausage, Carolina pulled pork, Kansas City burnt ends, Memphis ribs. Even their sauces are spread across four states. Does that mean they do everything well, or nothing spectacular? I'm leaning towards the latter. Given that a two meat plate costs $16 and a Papa Q's platter (a sampler feast) costs $30, the wife and I went with the latter. Papa Q's platter comes with every meat Q offers, including a half-slab of ribs and a couple unique items, the smoked chicken wings (Memphis-style, I'm told) and burnt ends (KC's finest). In order of tastiness: ribs, burnt ends, chopped brisket, chicken wings, pulled chicken, sausage, turkey, sliced brisket. First, some praise, and then a few qualms. The burnt ends, while not blow your mind good like Pecan Lodge's in Dallas, were solid with a nice crisp and some juicy, fatty pieces. I also really liked the ribs. Again, not Pappy's good, but solid enough that I'd take them home to mama. The chopped brisket lasted a few days, turning itself into a very solid sandwich. I also liked the pickle bar and sweet tea availability--very Rudy's Texan of you, Q-BBQ. Of the sauces, the only one I took home was the mustard, very useful for sandwich making. Green beans were one of two sides, and very good. So were the hush puppies. Now the problem. Smoking your meat for 22 hours (as Q-BBQ claims to do) is irrelevant to quality. You can smoke those suckers until the cows come home, but if you're not temperature controlling, your meat can and will dry out. Q's did. Likewise for the turkey--too dry, friends. The sausage tasted like Oscar Meyer. Don't cover everything in sauce. If I need it, I can do that myself. Why are there Cheese-its on the mac n cheese? Of everything aghast, the wife couldn't believe that travesty occurred. Save your BBQ mac n cheese cravings for Smoque. Overall, it was a solid meal and good value (assuming the Papa Q's platter), if you value leftovers. It was good enough to go to once, but given the proliferation of new BBQ options in Chicago, I don't think I'll be heading back anytime soon.",0.9974,0.79,0.167,0.043,0.47346963684463694

2014-04-09,4.0,"First visit to Q BBQ was a success.  I went with a group of five for an early dine-in dinner on a weekday. You order at the front and they give you your table number so they can deliver your metal tray of good ol'BBQ. Very informal, like BBQ should be. They have assorted beers in the cooler and specialty root beers too. I got a root beer this time, but next time I'll go for the sweet tea (BBQ and sweet tea is obviously sacrosanct). In case you're wondering their beer list included blue moon, 312, daisy ale and others. Our table got an array of the food they offer. Most got the plates of meat, which they all seemed to enjoy. I got the three sliders, two pork, one chopped brisket. None of my sliders were super juicy but they weren't dry at all. The brioche bread made the sliders that better too.  I like to mix it up with my sauces so I tried all four (N. Carolina Vinegar paired with the mustard). They were all tasty, but my favorite was the combo on the pork slider. The spicy wasn't that spicy, and the Memphis sweet wasn't that sweet, so don't come here expecting the extremes. It's good pleasing BBQ.  The sides were VERY good. I had the hush puppies, delicious, and the mashed potatoes which were perfectly seasoned. I bummed some of the beans and Brussels sprouts for tasting from my groups plates and those were above norm too. The five of us split their s'mores cereal treat which was a gooey mess of simple goodness. And the waiters were all super nice and friendly. Well accommodating!

Potatoes sadly are known to be a bit dry, and this one fit the stereotype. It was a big potion but had very little of the topping.

2014-03-22,3.0,"A welcome addition to Chicago, as I think BBQ places here are a little under-represented. Unfortunately, I consider this place only okay, so it is doubtful it will be entering my regular rotation of places to go for lunch. A few specifics: Pulled Pork Sandwich - decent, although I came across a big piece of non-tasty fat (as opposed to tasty fat that can really make a great BBQ place really shine) that made it seem like it needed to be slow-cooked for a longer time. The bread-to-meat ratio was a little high, and the brioche bun was cold, dense, and mostly uninteresting.  Brisket Sandwich - decent again. Little bits of brisket piled onto the sandwich instead of the big slices of tender, fatty brisket I was hoping for. Meat is good, but doesn't stand out. If you get it Q-style, there is also slaw and blue cheese on the sandwich. The blue cheese has a pretty controlling flavor and really doesn't belong on this sandwich.  Texas Sausage - pretty tasty. My favorite of the meats I tried.  The Sauces - they really seem to load heavily on the sugar. I know Memphis-style sauce is typically sweet, but theirs went way overboard. The Texas spicy sauce was probably the best of the sauces and had a nice kick to it, but still pretty sugary. Strangely, I also found the Carolina vinegar sauce to be a little too sweet. I think there's a lot of improvement needed in this area. Corn Fritters - it looks like two of these accompany any meal order. Soft on the inside, sweet, mostly pretty tasty. Beans - decent, though I've definitely had better at other BBQ places (and Little Goat). You can definitely taste the sugar in these as well. Mashed Potatoes with Gravy - pretty good. Mashed potatoes are really nice, brisket gravy could use a little more flavor. Service - very friendly, efficiently run place. The place comes across as a little too confident in the quality of the food it is offering. Overall, an okay place that definitely has room for improvement and maybe needs to lighten up a bit on the sugar. 3 stars.",0.9988,0.714,0.271,0.015,0.5487113174182138

2014-03-17,5.0,"A friend had been to the location in La Grange and gave me a heads up when this one was about to open.  Walgreens has a parking lot barely half a block away, so I ducked in and bought a couple things first to save finding a spot on the street.  I've been touring Chicago's BBQ scene, eating at Smoque, Fat Willy's, Smokin' Woody's, Honey 1, Wrigley BBQ etc. and I now have a new favorite.  I got the four meat platter and then some, so here's the breakdown: Pulled Chicken - Surprisingly, this one was my favorite.  The hickory and apple wood smoke were absorbed nicely, the meat tender and juicy, and the Memphis sweet sauce they put on it is incredible. Pulled Pork - Unlike the chicken, which naturally has little flavor, the pork had a very nice taste of its own and was also smoky and mostly tender (there were a few barky bits that must have been from the outer portion).  Also wonderful. Sliced Brisket - Tender, less smoky, it was my main choice for trying the various sauces. Ribs - I got a taste portion, which was 3 ribs, including an end one.  They were baby back size, the meat came off the bone and fell apart a bit too easy, caramelization was decent but not remarkable.  Fat Willy's spare ribs are far superior to these. Burnt Ends - This was the first time I ever had burnt ends, which are pieces of brisket cooked a second time to add more bark and deepen the flavor.  To me it just tasted like overcooked, dry brisket.  Totally disappointing and I'd never get it again.  I can't say whether it's their fault or I'm just not into that item. Baked Beans - Smoky, delicious, and reasonably thick.  Personally I like them so thick they nearly stick to the spoon, but these tasted so good I was still very happy. French Fries - Seasoned steak fries, plentiful, tasty on their own but perfect for dipping. BBQ Sauces - My own preference in descending order was Memphis sweet, Carolina mustard, Texas spicy, Carolina vinegar.  The sweet is fairly thick and sticky with a perfect flavor that actually made my mouth tingle on the first bite.  The mustard variety is very creamy and also thick, and went really well with the brisket; it's not really BBQ sauce as I tasted no tomato in it, but very tasty.  The spicy has a little kick but nothing that will burn unless you eat a lot of it.  The watery vinegar variety just isn't my scene.  In the expanding and very competitive BBQ restaurant business, having all the bottles on the table so I can have as much as I like gives Q an edge over places like Smoque that portion out sauce a shot glass worth at a time.  Sadly I can't rate the Q-pups since they forgot them, and I didn't even notice until I was home, having ordered enough food for two people (a feast that cost just under $30 and was worth every penny).  The decor is what you'd expect, wood floors and a somewhat western feel, and with everything brand new it was all pristine.  Service was very friendly and attentive even though it's an order at the counter and get your own beverages setup.  They asked if I needed anything else, if I needed a box for leftovers, and the manager came to see how I liked everything.  With the exception of the ribs, everything at Q outdid all the other places I've been to.  That's several meats, superior sides, and the most attentive (yet not badgering) customer service each beating a half dozen other BBQ places.  On the way home I actually wondered whether I'll ever take the long drive to Smoque again, my previous favorite. To wrap up, I've written you a short novel and rated Q 5 stars for good reason.  When a guy at the table next to mine dug in, he OMG'd out loud 3 times in about 45 seconds.  Give your taste buds a huge treat and help ensure this place is successful.",0.9985,0.798,0.169,0.033,0.5529780564263322

2014-03-10,3.0,"George Costanza once said, ""if it were socially acceptable, I'd drape myself in velvet.""  Now while growing up on Seinfeld and listening to my father proclaim episode after episode that ""George is such an idiot"" I have to say there should be no shame in draping yourself in anything you have a burning passion for.  That's how I feel with BBQ - except a sticky mess prevents me from wearing it like war-paint like the Ashaninka of South America. Ok, let's get down to the saucy secrets, shall we? On a Friday evening, expect to wait 30-45 minutes.  Also expect to order a drink (beer) and grab a deep-friend hunk of cornbread (I forgot what they call them) while you wait.  BONUS.   While waiting, I noticed their non-traditional system for ordering and seating.  Basically, you receive your number and wait and wait and wait to order.  Once you order, you go to your table where your number is.  The food then arrives in a bout 10 minutes giving you time to try their four sauces and I highly encourage you do. We split the 2 meat special which comes with 2 sides.  It's a good amount of food and at a great price if you split the cost.  Maybe $19.00 total?  For meat we got the pulled chicken and the brisket.  The brisket was excellent, I'd order that any day of the week.  The chicken however did not stand alone as it was on the dry side and lacked flavor.  For sides we had the mac'n'cheese and green beans.  The mac comes with crushed Cheeze-Its on top which actually doesn't do it any favors, in my opinion.  And if you F up green beans, so help you god. The service was fantastic; a young energetic bunch, probably all with a passion for BBQ.  I would go back to Q-BBQ, a little wiser, and a little hungrier, just so I can try more smoky creations.",0.9931,0.768,0.192,0.039,0.5052586713697825

2014-03-07,3.0,"I walk past this place every day on my way to work, and then home again. It smells incredible from outside, so I just had to try it. I love BBQ, and I'm from Southern Illinois (which you may not think of as 'the South', but I grew up closer to Kentucky & Tennessee, than Chicago) - and I've spent a good amount of time in Memphis, as well. Let's talk food first... the menu is generous, while not being overwhelming. There are several smoked meats to chose from and they boast that they've all been smoked for 22 hours. After my first meal there, I'm a believer. It was difficult to choose, but I went with the '2-meat plate', and decided on pulled chicken & burnt ends (brisket), and they were perfect. I'm excited to go back and try a few of the others, now. There is a good selection of southern sides to pick from as well ~ the usual suspects, and a few unexpected gems. I went with the garlic green beans, and a side salad. And every 'plate' order comes with two QPups (there version of a corn dog hush puppy), so I didn't order those. The green beans were cooked perfectly - crunchy, juicy, and well balanced with the garlic & seasoning. The Qpups were amazing & totally naughty!! you should eat them for dessert. Just think - indulgent. Unfortunately, they missed the mark (big time) on the side salad. Iceberg lettuce?! Really? What is this now - Denny's? McDonalds? Oh, what a shame - PLEASE, for the love of 'soul food' - scratch the side salad and throw some greens in there instead, Q-BBQ, you're not doing yourself any favors here - the side salad demerits the rest of the menu! YUCK! (that was one star I couldn't 'check'.) The second 'missing' star in this rating is because you've got the place lit up like Wrigley Field! For the love of Jeeeebus, turn that &*%# off!  Yes, we noticed the lovely wooden interior, the cool photos on the walls, all of the tasty condiments on the table & even the farm sink for washing your sweet barbecue covered mitts, but I really didn't need to see the aging process of the woman at the table next to me, or the eye-liner faux pas of the hostess. Plus, don't you know that the brighter the lights, the LOUDER the people?! I mean, that's kindergarten 101. PLEASE (again) - dim the lights a bit - you have plenty of beautiful lighting fixtures - everyone noticed!!! (how could we miss them blaring in our sauce covered faces), but someone needs a lesson on mood-lighting, ASAP! Otherwise, well done.

2014-03-04,4.0,"Sing along if you like......Lets talk about meat, baby lets talk about pork and beef lets talk about all the good meats and the bad meats that may be. Actually it's mostly really good meat, sides I'm still on the fence about.  The first time I picked up from Q-BBQ we ordered the 4 choice plate, that's a choice of 4 meats 2 sides and 2 Qpups. The second time we ordered only meat, which included  1 pound of brisket, 2 pounds of pulled pork and a slab of baby back ribs. The Brisket and pork seemed like a totally different product then we originally received. Both the pork and beef had more meat flavor to them, crispy crust, it was moist and juicy and had a nice smoke to it but not over powering, It was very good. The ribs (first time ordering these)  where excellent tender but not fall of the bone they had a little chew to them, smokey nice pork flavor, so good no sauce needed. A full slab is a big portion they are meaty and can feed two, well two moderately hungry people at least.  Ok here is what I think the difference was from the first time I picked up, the bulk meat is packed in tupperware and the plate meat is wrapped tightly in foil like pouches. The tupperware meat is not crushed, it looks very tasty, the nice crust edges are in tacked and not torn apart, not only does it look more appealing it tasted better. The same was true for the pulled pork. I think when the meat is wrapped in the foil it crushes it to like a lump and  steams it more which ruins the  crispy crust and some how it tasted different then when cut up and put in containers. What ever the case  the bulk meat was fabulous I imagine when you eat  at the restaurant you get a better product like the tupperware packed meat too.  I gotta come clean I lied we did get some Qpups they are awesome and every visit to Q-BBQ will include them. We ended up making our own sides as I am not crazy about QBBQ''s and they seem a bit expensive for what you get.

I decided on getting the spicy sausage plate which came with a couple of Qpups and your choice of two small sides, which I decided on mashed potatoes with brisket gravy and green beans with garlic balsamic dressing.  The sausages were delicious.  It wasn't overly greasy and had the right amount of kick to it.  The Qpups (deep fried cornbread aka hush puppies) were also pretty good.  It was airy, crunchy, and had bits of actual corn throughout.  I also enjoyed the sides as well.  The mashed potato was nothing special, but that brisket gravy gave it so much flavor.  The green beans weren't overcooked, so it still was crunchy and the balsamic dressing gave them a little acidic flavor.  My co-worker enjoyed her food as well, but the Texas chopped brisket wasn't the best she had ever eaten.  She also told me to pass on the mac and cheese because it lacked flavor, almost like it was cooked from the box. The staff here was phenomenal ever since I walked in until I left.  I was greeted upon entering the restaurant, greeted again when I walked up to the register, and was even given a s'more cereal bar for the small inconvenience of waiting to get rung up due to system issues.  What great customer service here!  I also appreciate that this place wasn't overly consumed with the smell of BBQ, so you won't leave smelling like you were the one cooking.  I enjoyed everything I ordered, but a few hiccups with my co-worker's order.  But I'll probably come back to try out their other items.  A 3 star review doesn't make this place bad, it's just that there isn't much that makes this place outstanding.  So go give this place a try if you haven't already.",0.9846,0.831,0.126,0.043,0.4741551459293394

I actually thought it was pretty good, I could have gone without the cheeze- it crumbs on top though, maybe a normal bread crumb instead.

The brisket was smoked just right, but the pork and chicken were just slightly overcooked. Overall, I'd give the food 4 stars and the service 5. However, I'm in the sales and customer service industry, so I respect how hard they are working to uphold legendary customer service, but I could see some Chicagoans being just slightly overwhelmed with 5 or 6 different staff members all asking them how they are doing and if they can do anything else for them. Atmosphere is great, and Viktor was a great hire. He took great care of us. My only suggestion would be to make sure that customers can eat their meals without interruptions if they prefer not to be bothered. I'm not one of those customers but they are bound to come across some everyday.",0.992,0.751,0.232,0.017,0.6386468253968254

We ordered the Platter which consisted of ribs,chicken wings,brisket,hush puppies n turkey and my fav the burnetts.Everthing was  amazing and cook to perfection.I don't know much about BBQ but I know what I tasted and it can't get much better than this place! The service was fast and very pleasant.The homemade sauces were a very nice surprise and on the label it tells you what meat to pair sauces with but i tried them on everything and loved it all.The owner was on hand to explain the menu and just welcome ppl in general.I can't wait to go back (Friday) and to be a regular In the future.This is def one of the best additions to lake view in a long long time .Do yourself a favor and go indulge in some great BBQ.",0.9937,0.724,0.26,0.016,0.5598290598290598
