Maybe short staffed due to new places just opening in Andersonville, but that's a hopeful guess. We (2 of us) arrived at 7:30pm and seated among three other tables occupied in the dining room. One of them was a kid's birthday party of about 8 in total. After about 15 minutes I went and asked the waiter if we could at least place an order for drinks. He said sure, but then never came to our table. After about 5 more minutes I went and asked the bartender to send someone over. We waited about 5 more minutes, but then we walked out and went to Rock's, which was packed almost to capacity, but we were served immediately.

So I could be recognized in their nearly empty restaurant as being a person who is drinking an unlimited amount of bloody mary!!  I also ended up ordering the Chicken Bacon Jack Panini - no complaints there!

2015-10-19,2.0,"I've been to Halsted's a couple of times in the past and it's somewhere I would go if my friends really want to go there, but independently I don't think I'd ever recommend it to anyone. It's definitely a perfectly acceptable location for food if you're okay with a very traditional, no frills, no creativity, not heavily seasoned, foods.  Very recently I was there for Sunday brunch and got a steak and eggs dish.  The eggs (scrambled) did not have seasoning, the tater tots were lackluster (which was particularly disappointing since it's really hard to go wrong with tots), the steak was ordered rare and came out probably a little too rare by health standards (but that's okay, I like it that way).  I ended up needing hot sauce and a lot of salt to flavor the eggs, which I very rarely do.  On the same trip, I was there with a bunch of friends, and three of them had problems with the food and had to have it sent back to the kitchen, one had to send it back to the kitchen twice before giving up and just asking for it to be taken off the bill.  Realistically, it was probably the kitchen's fault as our server, John (Sean?), was really great about all the errors and ended up giving us all a discount on the food.  But see, here's the thing about discounting things on bills... you should never have messed up to start with that discounting and taking things off the tab is necessary.  The only part of the service that was particularly disappointing was the lack of refills on beverages.  I think the server came around once to refill my water, and while he left a pitcher at the table 1) I go places for the services and 2) he never refilled the pitcher, so when that got empty... I've also been there in the past for other meals and honestly... I can't remember any of the them.  Nothing stood out.  Nothing wow'ed me.  Nothing makes me want to go back specifically.  But, like I said, it's a perfectly acceptable place to go and the service is pretty much on par with what I would expect at a casual dining location (not stellar, not amazing, but they work hard and do their best).  Definitely a ""no frills"" kind of place, which definitely has it's place, especially in Boystown.",0.985,0.738,0.166,0.096,0.5808139534883721

The food is great, love the tomato soup! The burgers are very good as well. The first time we came here, it was just excellent! However, on our last visit, it was horrible service, and if this had been our first time here, it would have been the last!  We were waited on by a gentleman, who truly had no idea what was going on. I ordered the tomato soup for an app, and waited and waited for it to come, when I finally asked about it (15 minutes later), the waiter says, let me check on that....really?? Lets get real, when you have soup on the menu, it is usually made ahead, and based of off the first visit, and have the soup delivered within 2-3 minutes, this was clearly a case of him forgetting my soup. Ok, I will give you a pass on this, things happen. The burgers come out, and they are way overdone, I ask for medium rare, and get well done. My partners fries are cold....nice.  Well, I will say that the manager did come to the rescue, this is why they get 3.5 stars. He had the kitchen remake our food, comped the bill, and gave us free dessert! After we complained about the issues we were having, the waiter REALLY stepped it up, almost to the point of annoyance, but hey, at least they took notice.

I brought my parents from out of town to Halsted's to show them a little bit of why I love living in Boystown. The place was a little quiet since we came on a Monday night, so I expected great service. However, the service was extremely slow and we had to wait about 40 minutes for our food. Once our food finally arrived, the French fries were cold and severely undercooked. We asked the waiter to take them back and he didn't apologize or offer a replacement. We also had to wait quite a while for our check.  The atmosphere is so fun here, and the back patio is especially great. The lighting and water(wall?) is really cool. Definitely welcoming and a nice place to hang out. Also, the tater tots are super fresh and delicious. They also have a wide variety of craft beers and specials during the week.

It makes me feel like my food is surrounded by the germs of thousands of people. Not to mention, one misplaced elbow and you've got mustard on your chest.  2. $6 Bud Light. The $6 part isn't the problem. I feel like elaborating any further will make me seem like a snob...which I admittedly can be when it comes to beer selections.  After weaving through the crowd at least twice, Halsted's back patio felt like an oasis. I mean, it does have a waterfall and all. Given that it was Market Days, the beer selection wasn't as big as normal, but I paid $6 for something that wasn't Bud, and that's all I asked for. We had the nachos, which were good, though not particularly memorable. I greatly enjoyed the fried green beans and would recommend giving them a try. For as busy as that day was, I think the service moved along as quickly as it could have. And our waiter was awesome.

While my first encounter with Halsted's and their Bottomless Mimosa Brunch was a success, recently I haven't felt the same. For instance, this past Saturday we went to a fairly empty Halsted's for a late dinner. We really wanted the Dragon Fruit pitcher that was advertised on the wall with a huge billboard. ""Sorry, they forgot to take that down after last summer's patio season"" says the waiter... wait... what?? ""But you could try the Stiegl Radler pitcher, that's fruity!"" UM OK NO, that's beer, not a cocktail buddy. We settled on the Boystown Long Island... which ended up being an electric blue sugar bomb. I wonder what the Dragon Fruit cocktail tastes like. On a positive note, the Margarite pitcher was delicious... but how can you screw up a Margarita? Things seemed to be going just fine while we waited for our food. When the waiter came out with three heaping plates of spinach, well I'm pretty sure I was worried. Sure enough, the waiter had put in three orders of the spinach salad instead of one spinach salad and two southwest salads. We offered to just keep them since we were starving, but he did take them back to bring us what we ordered which we ended up wanting anyway. The salads came out when the rest of our friends were close to finishing their plates, but it was definitely a decent salad. Nothing to write home about though.

I LOVE IT! The bartender, severs, and hotess were all great! It was a good start to a good night. The menu is colossal! How does one choose ONE ENTREE?  Well, I'll was able to reach a decision by pictures and descriptions. It is ALWAYS a GREAT thing when a menu has pictures. I got the turkey burger because I wanted to be a fatass but not be fat at the end of the night. My friend order a Chicken  Panini with sweet potatoe fries. I would love to have tried the tator tots because they looked like the cool thing to order... that & the mini sliders. The menu doesnt just include any mini sliders they have a mexican rendition, a blue cheese option, and I believe ONE more option for these finger-licking baby hamburgie! So many options and only ONE stomach to fill.  I order a beer... I had to. Its a sports bar but without the sports =)  The food came out looking fresh & hot. My turkey burger, being turkey meat was not dry at all. It was juicy and had enough lettuce and tomatoe to occupy some more space in my tum tum. My friend finished his panini in 2 minutes. I'm assuming he more than enjoyed his selection. This was a random visit and was not expecting to be so happy with this place. It definately surprised me! Other people might have high expectations because its in Lakeview, but this isnt a place for kids and its not a place you get gourmet food. It is American food and its fresh and good. If you want over the top then pay more money and go somewhere else like Alinea in Lincoln Park if you are so bougie!

When I pointed it out, he took one of my plates I was working on away from me, and when I said, hey, leave that, I'm eating that, he called me rude in front of my friend. I informed him that you don't call a customer rude when they ask politely for the correct order when you messed up as the waiter i in the first place.

That said the burgers here are always really solid. But they need to look at the frequent reviewed mentions of bad service and work on that. There are a lot of burger options around here.

(really? it is?! i thought restaurants have to be free from all rodents)... and then the waiter proceeded to tell us all about all the rat findings in halsted's... that it had been inside, they are always out here on the patio area... even a time that it had run inside the dining area and started bouncing up and down on the booth cushions. sick. that makes me not want to sit inside. then when i am finishing up my drink and a friend is about to go to the restroom and we finish up... a ran runs across my friend's foot and touches the back of my foot (thank god i was wearing wedges, and could just feel it)... i screamed bloody murder because i HATE rodents... we had the manager run up along with the waiter... because they thought i had been shot... yeah, wouldn't you hear a bang? we told them about the rat, and they just laughed it off, nonchalantly... like, well, that shit happens all the time. no, let me get something off your bill... we are calling the health department and getting rid of our rats, just... aren't the rats funny... yeah, we have a problem. we also thought it was amusing that another group just kept sitting there, like, it's okay that rats are here. i will NEVER eat at halsted's again.

Recommend going there on Sunday nights when it's still busy but not packed -- if you go there  on a Friday or Saturday night, you're probably going to have to wait to get in.  If you have a large group, call in advance -- because they are so busy on weekends, you'll want to talk to the host about a good time to come and if they can hold a table for you.  I did that once last year and they were very accomodating, even sitting us in the beer garden on a busy Saturday night, although I could tell that they were concerned that so many in my party were sooo late (I was embarrassed myself -- note to people out there -- if it's a group thing, like 8 or more, SHOW UP ON TIME --  if the restaurant is a busy one, they need the table more than they need to wait an hour or more on your diva ass).

Halsted's was the latest stop for the Beer Garden Bus, and anyone who's drunk with Yelpers know we can be a chore. But Halsted's did a good job of keeping up with us. When the manager found out there would be a big group of us, he came over to see what we needed, and set aside a few tables for us. This was nice, considering that the patio was open for food service, and we didn't really know how many people would be coming or when. Yelpers being Yelpers, folks grabbed whatever tables they wanted, but at least they tried. Our first server was kind of grumpy, but I think that was part of his routine. And he actually did some nice things for us, such as separating out one couple's order, and letting us continue to open and close checks as we went. The second server was more fun, but the first guy had borne the brunt of the service, so he could relax! Halsted's does food, and while I only tried a little, what I had was very good. I split a breakfast panini with the lovely Amy H. It came with eggs, cheese, avocado and some spicy mayo thing, and was better than a patio sandwich has a right to be. It came with tater tots, since they're everywhere these days, and Amy was wise enough to get a chipotle dipping sauce on the side. Good call. The tots come on their own, as a small and large order, and the large is large.

I like mine with a little more cheese but that was easily fixed with I asked for a side of cheese.  They had no problem with that.  I liked Kellie's fries and didn't really notice the salt factor but I always tend to shake my fries anyway.

In the hot summer months when the rest of the city is sweltering and melting, you can sip a cool beverage at a table underneath an outdoor fan.  On my first visit, a true testament to the cooling power of the fan, I was with a very pregnant friend on an afternoon in the late summer months and the only reason she wasn't comfortable was due to the chair and her back.  The heat didn't even bother her.   Because it was a shift change, my dining companion and I ended up with 2 servers on my most recent visit.  Combined together, they provided us with fairly fast, super-attentive, albeit a little confusing service.  My first visit, on the other hand, left me going up to the bar myself several times.  I'd like to think that the most recent experience is a better indicator of the current level of service. You're likely to find something for everyone on the huge menu.  There are also daily food and drink specials, so be sure to check them out.  I tried the regular burger and was impressed that they cooked it to my specification.  It came with a side of potato, so I opted for the fries.  They were a little too salty for my taste, though overall not bad and the portion size was just about the right amount.   The next time I'm in Boystown, I'll surely stop in here for some afternoon refreshment over just about anywhere else nearby.",0.9894,0.822,0.154,0.025,0.4907014942729229

The atmosphere is like a sports bar, so if you're coming only for drinks, you'll probably be fine as long as you sit outside (the music inside is loud). I wouldn't spend money to dine here, however. The service is mediocre - it takes quite a while to get served and the servers I've had are less than enthusiastic. The food, however is my main complaint. I can forgive a lot of service issues if the food is truly great. The food is just not good. I've had burgers a couple of times and they have always been over cooked (the last time I ordered it medium-rare, thinking I would get it medium and it was cooked well). Thank god for ketchup.

We also LOVED our food.  We ordered the hummus appetizer to split.  The little pitas came out fresh off the grill - warm and with grill marks.  The hummus was also quite tasty.  We needed extras pitas to finish off the hummus and they were only $1.50, not too shabby.  We shared a chicken sandwich with goat cheese and basil pesto on a hearty wheat roll.  It was tasty, PLUS they split the sandwich for us and had them plated separately.  We probably got triple the serving of tater tots too.  We both had bloody marys and they were quite enjoyable and the bar has a wide-variety of bloody marys to fit anyone's taste buds plus the requisite mimosas.  I live just down the block and I'm thrilled to have a laidback bar/restaurant in my hood.  I am even planning on bringing my conservative dad back for lunch with my girlfriends in a couple weeks!!!

Wait 15-20 minutes for main course.  (Remember, mine had already arrived once).  Average meatloaf.  Room temperature grilled cheese (appeared to be 1-2 slices of Kraft cheese on thick bread).  AWESOME soup.  Sent the grilled cheese back.  Prayed it didn't fall off the plate and dent the floor.
