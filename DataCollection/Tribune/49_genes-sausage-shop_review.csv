Against my better judgment (because I refused to believe they were going bad already), I cooked them, but was not surprised when they tasted rancid. The price was rather inexpensive compared to Jewel or Mariano's ($3.49/lb), but it was frustrating and disappointing to throw the chicken breasts away, especially when the sell by date was still two days away.

'DELI' .. its just the small assortment of cakey sweets they do have makes me crave more), but the liquor section is huuuge and well stocked and includes some european treasures u dont see very often elsewhere. (Try the cherry liquer bottled with cherries by Cracovia) There is also a nice variety of imported canned products, both in tins and jars and condiments tucked into those general rows. Very easy to visit Genes and buy some precooked schnitzel, beet salad and a quart of soup for dinner that night and shop for your deli needs at the same time =D ..  4 stars instead of 5 because of the cons-and there arent many. The largest one has to do with the language barrier. Most of the shelved products and the sausages are labelled in polish (which makes sense since the shelved products are mostly imported and the sausages are just going by their names, but a little guidance would be nice) The other con is what other reviewers have mentioned before - you may not get the most helpful attitude if u dont appear to be  Polish.  We went to the Deli and spent $50 (which is a feat here !) and the girl behind the counter pretended at first not to understand me ..then was impatient and slightly bored as we ordered items. A request to suggest a sausage that we might like was met with an eye roll and we were handed a regular polish sausage out of all the varieties available lol but hey maybe she was just having a bad day .. I lived in the neighborhood about 20 yrs ago and Genes was going strong back then-and yes, the attitude situation was the same back then. After the people in the shop got to know me tho, it changed and i was always treated nicely on my weekly forays for tidbits. Im planning on being enough of a regular again now that we've moved closer once more-so heres hoping =)  Either way, the goodies are worth a little bit of tude.",0.9957,0.834,0.142,0.024,0.46892073068543655
2009-05-14,4.0,"When I first walked in here I thought sheesh,  what a sausage fest. (badumbum!) A fellow yelper, G.R., knew I was in search of a good deli that could rival the NY delis ouf my youth, and recommended this place.  I walked in and really enjoyed looking around at some of the more unusual litems.  I love ethnic groceries for that reason.  However, as someone who rarely eats beef or poultry, I was at first thinking I was not going to be able to review it highly because there wasn't much I wanted to buy. Then I got home and tried what I had bought.  Whoa.  I bought a piece of stuffed cabbage (I was in need of childhood comfort food memories) and some beet salad.  I never had beet salad like that, and while at first I wasn't sure I liked it, that changed in a a few seconds and I happily and eagerly devoured it.  For another meal I bought cheese pierogis, sauerkraut and mushroom pierogis, and potato pierogis, and all were also really good (though really, what isn't going to taste good when fried in real butter?).  The prices were amazing--my pound of beet salad was a little over two bucks, a pound of cole slaw was a little under $2, a thing of strawberries (which were in better shape than most grocery stores that charge way more) were $1.89 I think.   If you are a meat eater, make your way here for the vast assortment of items, they did look really good and interesting.  If I am in the neighborhood, I will definitely return to try some more of the vegetable and fish items. Note: they have a parking lot.  Note 2: Credit care minimum is $15.  (Prices were so cheap I didn't hit it!)",0.9925,0.818,0.167,0.014,0.5630286738351253
2008-12-31,5.0,"Let me just say HEX YEAH!!  I love Gene's and go every year at Christmas and take things in a cooler back to Arizona with me.  This year the airport security people confiscated several items (previously permitted) and I wasn't happy but hey-at least some smoked porky goodness made it through.  Maybe I should have hid them in my burkha LOL!!   Their kabanosy and gypsy ham are not to be missed, though I have never had anything that wasn't absolutely delicious.  The counter help can be a bit b!tchy if you're not Polish but this last time the lady was real nice!",0.9577,0.716,0.217,0.067,0.49333333333333335
2008-10-28,5.0,"Being a ""raging Polski,"" (as many of my non-Polish friends call me)  I know a couple things about Polish food.  This place is hands down, without an argument, my all time favorite Polish deli.  They have a wide variety of Polish sausages, as well as various deli meats, as well as other groceries.  The reason this place shines brighter than other Polish delis in the area is that it's well kept, organized and very friendly. This used to be my neighborhood Polish deli growing up and I'll still go out of my way to stop by here to get my fix of Polish goodness.",0.9494,0.74,0.213,0.047,0.5111111111111112
2008-06-02,4.0,"My husband would give this place five stars, I'm not there yet but we'll see.  This small store (huge inside) seemingly has every Polish product you could get on the boat and sneak into the States.  Just about nothing is in English and there are such a variety of jars, packets, boxes of curious items - that unless I bring a translator I'll just never know what to make of them.  They do have 2 aisles dedicated to chocolate, a huge deli, lots of cold items and a big barrel of dead (probably pickled) fish.  We like the sausage - bought 6 lbs of fresh made italian, polish, and bratwurst along with fresh mustard and homemade kraut - came to $14.  $14.  Not sure if you read it, but $14.  Holy.  Good for cookouts, experimental Eastern European food shopping, and deli items (potato pancakes and german potato salad).",0.9578,0.802,0.161,0.037,0.47581699346405226
2007-07-16,5.0,"Just incredible! This place is really good. This place is on my mom's list as one of the best. Yes we're polish. So is most of the staff behind the deli counter. I try to order my stuff in my very limited Polish, they humor me and give me the goods. So many ready made items, you can put together dinners for over a week. In addition to that, they have a butcher area. Some items cross nationalities, such as potato pancakes, knishes, and more. You can get everything here, they have grocery items, fresh produce and they carry liquor also;  from Vodkas, a Polish must have staple, like pasta is to an Italian , to various Polish and other European beers. I'm not a big beer drinker and I always bring home one of their sale beers. Hey it's a sale right! Bakery selection could use improvement, however they carry a good selection of bread, especially rye.  Yes it is out of the way for some, but remember this place is amply sized and you can complete your shopping list here. And during the holidays they carry all the specialties. I should of done this review before eating  dinner, I just made myself hungry. Darn it, double calories, time to nosh.",0.9339,0.89,0.102,0.008,0.4180194805194805
2006-08-05,4.0,"In an area loaded with Polish deli's Gene's is a little different.  First, it's not just a Deli, it's a mini grocery store- they've a side parking lot and inside you'll find produce area, canned goods, beer, etc.  You'll know you've found it by the giant cow on the roof!  And the deli counter really is something to see- the longest deli counter I've seen!  I usually order something, even if as a non-Pole I don't know what it is!  This place had it's 15 minutes of fame years back when the Frugal Gourmet paid a visit on his show (alright, enough with the young boy jokes)- it was good enough to put on TV and I'm sure you'll find it's good enough to pay a visit.  'I bid you peace.'",0.8879,0.898,0.091,0.011,0.4692592592592593
