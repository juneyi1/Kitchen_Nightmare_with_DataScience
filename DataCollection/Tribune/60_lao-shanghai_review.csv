2016-04-18,4.0,"It's my first time dining at Lao Shanghai, I have tried Tony Hu's other Lao restaurants and this goes along the same theme just different style of Chinese cooking.  It's a very small restaurant sitting about 7 tables in total but service was outstanding.  We started out with the crispy shrimp with a little sweet and sour sauce to the appetizer. I'm glad it had a light coating of crispness to it not like the traditional deep fried versions.  The pot stickers that came out next were tasty but very tiny dumplings, I'm used to the larger more meaty dumplings.  The shrimp dumplings were traditional fare, nothing spectacular.  The Shanghai style noodles were thick like udon noodles with bits of shredded meat, black mushrooms and green vegetables. They had good flavoring to the dish.  My favorite by far was the eggplant dish which was done in the style of salt and pepper dishes and very light crispy coating and good saltiness without being too greasy which often is the case with eggplant dishes.  The last entree was the Chinese broccoli in garlic sauce which was traditional.  Would I come back...not so sure because I felt we didn't order $60 worth of food. I felt this was on the expensive side for what you get in Chinatown these days.",0.9675,0.825,0.12,0.054,0.5372063492063492

If you come here you will be spending a pretty penny for some good Taiwanese cuisine. Northern China has pretty much taken over a lot of Chinatown square as well as Chinatown. It's like will my broken Cantonese even be accepted in these restaurants anymore? Well with steppingi into Lao Shanghai having a friend who speaks fluent Mandarin is always helpful. In my case I came prepared with a friend who speaks and knows how to order food. We ordered their crispy duck,  xiao long bao, stir fried beef with pea pods and had their crispy scallion pancakes. It was all good flavors and we enjoyed our queen size lunch. Here is the load down in each dish we tried. Crispy duck I believe was $12.95 it was crispy and tasty but I don't know if we got entire duck for that huge price tag. The plate of duck looked tiny. The beef with pea pod was delicious I would want to order that again and again. xiao long bao, I can take it or leave it there. Their soup wasn't hot enough for me inside the dumplings Crispy scallion pancakes by far were my favorite item on their menu. It was crispy soft on the inside with layers of dough and scallions were flavorful and it was salty in a good way.  I would love to dine at Lao Shanghai with friends again and it was a great experience. A little tip I did get a Groupon deal so it made the price tag not such a big sting in the wallet. Would I pay those prices regularly perhaps if I were in a mood for Taiwanese food in Chinatown Square.

If it hadn't been for our Groupon ($26 for $50), I might have given it 2 stars...  Service: getting seated and giving our orders was fine, but we thought something was strange when they started bringing out our entrees first before the xiao long bao and soup we had ordered. As we saw people at nearby tables who had ordered after us get their xiao long bao first, we realized they had probably forgotten our order. When we asked our waiter what happened to our order, he just said ""let me go check"" and didn't come back until 20 minutes later, which meant they probably had to place a new order. At that point, we had pretty much finished our meal already.  Food: nothing impressive, and looked better than it tasted. Here's what we had: - Shanghai fried rice cake: yummy and chewy with good flavor. Probably my favorite dish out of the ones we ordered but I like fried rice cake a lot lol. - Short ribs with mushroom and onion: decent, slightly greasy - Shui zhu yu (spicy fish fillet): I have a low spice tolerance and even I didn't think this was spicy at all, except maybe towards the end. Also lacked salt. I was disappointed because Lao Szechuan has such a good version of this. - Tofu, egg, and veggie soup: okay, nothing to write home about.  - Xiao long bao: disappointing after reading all the positive reviews, but maybe it didn't taste as good after we were already full. It had an odd stale kind of flavor to it; perhaps they are frozen like some reviewers suggest.  Overall disappointing experience here, but maybe we didn't order the right dishes.

I took one bite and spit it out - I didn't want to swallow because it seemed like there was something in that fried rice that wasn't supposed to be consumed.  - The sesame balls I ordered were so overcooked, they were blackish-brown and hard as a rock on the outside, completely dry on the inside.  - The sauce that came with my chicken had blatantly been watered down - it was the consistency of broth. The chicken was over-cooked and the coating on the outside was hard.  All-in-all, I ordered $40 worth of food, and every single last bit went into the trash. I realize I was probably one of their last orders of the day, but that doesn't make delivering garbage food OK. I would have rather they cancelled my order than deliver what they did. Incidentally, I ordered from their sister restaurant Lao Beijing last week and was pleasantly at how fresh everything tasted - and everything was literally steaming hot when it got to my door.

We got the following : - dry chili chicken - maybe on a weekend this would be better. Half the dish was dry red chilies and it was very dry...as in it seemed like it was just sitting out for a while. - tony gourmet eggplant - bad idea. it was just fried salt/pepper eggplant  - beef rib with cumin - this was tasty but it was fatty pieces of bone.    - Szechwan scallops - best dish out of everything we ordered. HOWEVER - I'm pretty sure we got kung po scallops instead of Szechwan ...it had no veggies. just peanuts in a dry dark tasty sauce. it was still less prepared with no finesse. (scallops looked a bit flash fried). We used a  restaurant.com  certificate that made it all worth the visit.

The dry bean curd and greens appetizer had that rich sesame flavor. Bitter melon with black bean sauce didn't hold back - real bitter melon - as it should be.

2013-11-21,3.0,"When we walked in this past Friday night there were two tables of groups that were about to finish.  One larger group and one smaller, though both were all Caucasian.  The dining room had a serene quiet to it, as you could easily here the chatter of either table.  The waiters stood a few (mere) feet away, always watching in case to offer service. During this lull, we took our time to place orders for appetizers and then our dinner entrees.  Slowly, both tables finished and left before our first course hit the table. Now.. once all the White people were gone, shit got boisterous in that motherfucker.  Have you ever seen Russell Peters do a Chinese accent?  I couldn't tell if these dudes were fucking with us by purposefully doing that accent overboard or what.  I don't mean for that to sound as ignorant as it does, it's just that how the heck could they go from quiet to ruckus loud once one race of customer leaves the building??  The situation was so fucked up, but we just had to laugh it off.  Cheer and chatter filled the air like a busy street corner, these guys were engulfed in lively chatter, tom foolery and other joyous interactions.  Many of them came out and dined together at a table a few feet away. The kicker was this one waiter (maybe a head waiter) that seemed to be having a silent conversation with me in the form of trying to figure me out via blatant and sometimes constant stares and looks.  I didn't appreciate this very much. Moving on.   Starters: Shanghai egg rolls and potstickers.  The egg rolls were smaller than the length of their spoons, also it contained less than a 1/2 teaspoon full of stuffing.  The coating must have been 2 or 3 layers of wrapper, deep fried to an almost brown with dark edges.  (Me thinks they were talking a bit too much in the back)  Needless to say, we weren't a fan.  Their potstickers were pretty cute in that they were of a miniature size. Although tasty. Entrees: Empress chicken. = Snooze inducing, could have used more sauce although fried nicely & a bit too salty.  Country style shredded beef which is fried shredded beef made crispy then sauteed  w/julienne carrot and celery in hot Szechuan bean sauce.  This was not a favorite of mine, again another entree in need of sauce, over salted and did not compliment the meal.  The only saving grace was the rice element, which was the standard shrimp fried rice made a bit spicy.  If not for the fried rice, I would have had to stop elsewhere for a second dinner. Typically I would say this was a ""one and done experience"" but seeing photos and reading other reviews once again, I think I may need to return to try those soup dumplings.  Who knows.. a bit pricey with small portions; that remembered may thwart any future plans.",0.9643,0.862,0.082,0.056,0.45671383647798747

Typically we eat across the courtyard at Tony's, Lao Sze Chuan, which is truly incredible.  So I am comparing this location to its brother across the way. If I had nothing to compare it too then I might go 3.1 stars but I really know Tony Hu is better then this.  First we had the Dry Chili Chicken. It looked the same as what they serve at Lao Sze Chuan but it did not have the same wow punch or addictive flavor. I don't understand  why because its the same restaurant group. I would assume it would be the same recipe for both locations. I am sure it is but the chef is not preparing it like they do across the way. This was a huge let down and primarily why we came here.  We also had the Dry Chili Beef which tasted much better then the Dry Chili chicken. Nice thick slices of ginger and garlic and of course the dried red chilies. I had nothing to compare this to but I secretly want to try this across the way now. If it was good here it might be crazy good over there. Both of the entrees came with rice for free. If we were at Lao Sze Chuan we would have been charged $1 per person for rice. So that was a nice bonus to save $2.  We were both surprised with how good the Singapore Noodles were. It came with shrimp, pork and vegetables. It ended up being my wives favorite. I was Shanghai'ed again. She typically doesn't order noodles but she loved these. My girls are always stealing my Asian dishes. I need to stop sharing.  We rounded out lunch with an egg roll which was good but not great. I was really surprised with the spicy sour soup. I actually ordered it for my wife but the sour was too much for her. I actually liked how the sour complimented the spicy. Perfect on a cold Fall day plus I couldn't stop eating the unique flavor.  The staff was really nice and I would give them 5 stars. Customer service was not an issue here.  My two stars here are based on the high level that Tony Hu has set when it comes to Asian Food in Chicago. He has set it really high and this location did not meet it. I was fortunate in my life to travel and work in Asia, so this is why I'm so critical when it comes to Asian food. Once you have authentic you can't go back to the American crap version of Asian. The food here was not bad but it was not great. I'm glad I tried it but I do know that next time I will just stick with what I know and I know Lao Sze Chuan is incredible.

My friend had recently returned from the city of Shanghai, but we were not attempting to compare dishes which he tasted there with what was on offer here. We particularly wanted to try Lao Shanghai's version of xiao long bao (soup dumplings), so we shared an order of 8 of the twisted top dumplings as our appetizer.

The vinegared soy sauce supplied complimented the delicate gingery pork dumpling, which contained less than a half teaspoon of bland soup inside. No one got squirted on!

I spent about $20. I ordered on GrubHub, tipped 20% up front, and made sure to ask for 2 sets of eating utensils because my husband and I are at a hotel right now.  Not only did they not give us 2 sets of eating utensils, but they didn't even include a spoon for the soup. I had to use the fork for the wantons and drink the soup straight out of the container. On the bright side, the soup was decent - nothing to write home about, but it wasn't terrible. The same can be said of the egg rolls, which were a little smaller than I'm used to. The sweet and sour chicken, however, was so bad that I lost my appetite. It was served by having the fried chicken in one container and the sauce in another. The chicken was so greasy that there was a shallow pool of oil at the bottom of the container, and since they didn't provide plates, I couldn't put it on a bed of rice (though they did provide white rice) and ended up only eating the top layer of chicken by dipping it in the sauce.  For a $9.95 dish, it was a total rip off. I've had much better Chinese food from fast food places at malls, and that's saying something, since I'm kind of a foodie.

I decided to order all lofan food since I was with a lofan who likes to complain about anything and everything. The walnut shrimp was good but....you can't really mess that up. The xiao long bao was just bad....they seemed like they were store bought and they had some strong ginger-type overtone. yuck. I was done after one dumpling but I had 2 out of guilt. I could not stomach the meatball in the second one. We also ordered pea shoots in garlic sauce. Those may have been the best thing we ordered besides the walnut shrimp.

I think it would be hard to mess up Xiao Long Bao and they did not prove me wrong. The dumplings could've been ""soupier"", but in the end they were hot, soft and savory. We polished them right off. We followed up with bowls of Hot & Sour and Wonton soups. Both were better than average, but you don't expect too much there. For our main entrees we got the Seafood Platter (Shrimp, Scallops & Whitefish in a savory sauce with vegetables) and Mongolian Beef. the seafood was a star of the meal and really left us both scrambling over the last scallop.

The flavor is fine.  The pork ball and broth were not too salty, not too oily. 2. The wonton skin was too thick, and the dumpling itself too small.  Anyone who has had the real deal in China (Din Tai Fung) or had the best in NY (see my review for Nan Xiang Xiao Long Bao in Flushing, Queens) knows that the dumpling should be delicately filled to the brim with soup, so that even moving the little pocket of joy to your spoon with your chopsticks should be dangerous.  No danger here folks!   3. The presentation was sloppy.  There was no care to the placement of the dumplings, which were haphazardly plopped on top of the steamed cabbage.  The perfect spacing is actually important.  This way the dumplings don't stick to each other or to the sides of the steamer, which helps the eater from breaking the skin and losing all the soup.  However, since there was hardly any soup in the dumplings anyway, I guess this didn't matter to anyone back in the kitchen. 4. Pork only.  Many of the new places will offer a crab roe version as well, which always tastes better.  No such option here.

2011-11-01,3.0,"Psst, you want to know a secret about Chinese restaurants? Since I'm so awesome, I'll give you four.  Let's count with me, children: #1:  It's all about the value-service equation.  This is a spectacularly simple relationship I've learned from years and years of my parents dragging me to Chinese restaurants, regardless of whether we're in the middle of the boondocks of Adirondacks or the metropolis of Shanghai.  The worse the service, the better the value of food.  It's that easy. #2:  Note how I said ""value of food,"" not ""quality or quantity.""  That's important.  Value is very simply this:  would I pay the same amount of money to eat this again?  Would I rather have a Chipotle burrito?   #3:  Don't make a reservation at a Chinese restaurant unless you have a wedding party or you have at least 50 people.  If you do make a reservation, expect that they're going to ""lose it"" or ""get your phone number/name wrong.""  I'm sorry.  Not to be racist or anything -- considering I am Chinese -- but I don't think Chinese people understand the concept of waiting for customers to arrive and turning away people who are already there.  I think our attitude is much more like, ""a bird in hand is MUCH MUCH MUCH better than two birds in the bush.""  That's why I always go early or late (and luckily for non-Chinese people, we define ""late"" as ""after 8:00 PM""). #4:  Don't waste your time ordering vegetables, unless it's pea-tips.   Given all that, Lao Shanghai's value to service equation is kinda iffy.  The soup dumplings (or xiaolongbao) are probably some of the better I've had in Chicago, but let's face it, I can get a pack of 30 from Chinatown Market for $4.99 and heat it up myself in my rice cooker and they taste pretty damn close (trust me).  They do have really good noodles, the Shanghai chow mein being the dish that did my eating partner in.  So this lands it in the solid three-star territory, good but there's plenty better in Chinatown.",0.9936,0.799,0.165,0.037,0.4681643625192013

The one item on the menu that I was the most excited about was the shanghai soup dumplings (xiao long bao). If you haven't had it before, it's definitely something to experience. They are dumplings are filled with meat or seafood with soup. What's unique is that the soup remains in the dumpling, a delicious phenomenon. I won't get into the details of how they do it but just imagine how the collagen in bone marrow turns into gelatin after being cooked for hours in stock.   Although the xiao long bao wasn't as good as what I experienced in New York or Toronto, they were enjoyable enough for my friends who never tried them before. Unfortunately for me, I have eaten excellent soup dumplings that are hard to surpass. At the Lao Shanghai, the wrappers were too thick and absorbed a lot of the soup so that there wasn't enough broth to enjoy. I still enjoyed them since this the broth was flavorful and the wrappers were cooked well.  Overall, my first experience at Lao Shanghai was enjoyable. The interior is clean with a modern dark wood interior. The food came out quickly and we received good service. I would definitely go there again and try some of their other items.

2011-03-02,1.0,"Decadent, tantalizing, savory; all of these words can be used to describe meals that have come from establishments that really had it together. Unfortunately, in the case of Lao ShangHai, they are more applicable as antonyms that describe the pitiful quality of their entrees and service. One would think that a restaurant located in the midst of Chinatown would have some idea about how to deliver quality Asian cuisine, but regrettably their efforts more closely resemble army ration handouts than a Chinatown eatery in a major Metropolitan city. In the interest of full disclosure, I have not been to the restaurant, but have only encountered their meals via delivery (Thank God).  My experience was bad from the very beginning when the order arrived 20 minutes later than promised. Now I understand that it's not easy to get around Chicago in a timely fashion, but according to Google maps, they are only 15 minutes from my house! Why does it take 70 minutes to drive 6.5 miles in the middle of the business day? The delivery person didn't apologize for being late, and did not even give me the receipt for my credit card payment. As I proceeded to try the variety of items I ordered, the disappointment I felt only grew from one item to the next.   The hot & sour soup barely had any flavor or spice and I found myself reaching for the Sriracha sauce to mask its lackluster broth. The shrimp dumplings were very doughy, and tasted like they sat way too long in the steamer. Also, the shrimp brought out a flavor I can only presume came from boiling it in sewer water. Finally, the General Tso's Chicken (their ""most famous"" dish), was something you had to see to believe. The chicken was very lumpy and you could not even discern which part of the fowl you were actually eating. The red peppers added zero spice, there was no ginger, and oh yeah, there was a medium sized bone in one of the pieces of chicken!  Clearly this hidden surprise must have been why the dish was so famous? I tried to stay open minded about the experience, and kept eating but soon realized that this meal would not do even as left overs. Finally, the restaurant must be accustomed to delivering such ""stellar"" offerings since they did not even include a menu in the bag for future orders. I recommend that they partner up with Binny's and include a free bottle of Vodka with every order to help you forget this disaster. Good riddance!",0.8162,0.835,0.089,0.075,0.5231481481481481

(Sorry, peeps!) After leaving Giftland last Saturday night, a friend and I decided to stroll through the Chinatown square to choose a restaurant to eat at. Remembering Amaliya L.'s review of this spot, I suggested we go here. Upon seeing a decent mix of ethnicities happily dining inside, we decided to go in. Upon coming in, we were immediately greeted and shown a table we could sit at. Afterward, we were promptly brought a cute clay kettle of tea and glasses of water. I was already digging the service.  We came hungry and ready to order up a bunch of food. Between the two of us, we got: Sweet & Sour - Spare Ribs, Chicken, Shrimp Chinese Broccoli in garlic and clam sauce Scallion Pancake Wonton Soup Pork Shumai I can say the only things I weren't too crazy about were that the pork shumai is basically like a big pork potsticker, and the broccoli was mostly stalks. Other than that, the scallion pancake was magically delicious. I shared a little of this with my friend out of proper social etiquette, but I reeeeeeally didn't want to!  I had never had spare ribs as sweet & sour, so I was curious as to how well that work. It's not the same as how they do it for the chicken and shrimp. It's more of a gingery sweet soy saucey type of flavor with a nice tang. It was so delicious. I even think them using a clay pot instead of a porcelain one made a difference with the tea. I was drinking more of that than the water, which is unusual for me cause I'm Southern sweet tea lover.  I've been to a few other Chinese restaurants over there and always just enjoyed the food for what it was. I didn't have a go-to place. Lao Shanghai, for me, stands out.

The establishment had numerous posted printed reviews in its windows that raved about the xiao long bao so of course we were excited to add the dish to our list of salt and pepper fish and orange chicken. The xiao long bao came as eight little dumplings arranged neatly and presented modestly in a steamer basket. However, with each bite of the dumplings, it was clear that the modest presentation was nothing more than a ploy to conceal the explosion of flavorful juices wrapped into each dumpling. Although we only visited one restaurant in Chinatown, after biting into each of those dumplings, it was hard to imagine that any other restaurant could top what he had experienced. While the crispy salt and peppered fish and the sweet orange chicken were quite delicious as well, it was the xiao long bao that made our meal and we had almost hoped it would have been worth it to order the dish towards the end of the meal to end on a high note.",0.9616,0.846,0.122,0.032,0.5975

We ordered the following:  soup dumplings, braised pork belly in bean curd sauce, plum flavored spare ribs and the shanghai style fish filet.  Everything was pretty good, but the standouts were the two pork dishes. The pork belly had a layer of a red sauce that looked like it would be spicy but ended up being a little sweet.  The pork was cooked well, had fat but not too much fat, and the meat was tender but had a bit of chew which I liked. It was delicious.  The plum flavored spareribs were awesome too.  They were lightly dusted with flour or cornstarch then flash fried, with a plum glaze.  They used the dried plum as the base of the glaze, which is something you don't see anywhere really at all, considering that the plums are considered as an Asian candy or as a snack.  It's salty. sweet and licorice-y at the same time.  I loved this dish.  The fish filet dish was good, but was kind of bland to me.  It had this white translucent sauce (a lot of it) and it was a little greasy. The soup dumplings were good as well, but I think I prefer the regular siu mai.  I would definitely come back for the pork dishes, and keep in mind that this place is BYOB.",0.9962,0.79,0.193,0.017,0.5458934294871794

And from what we remember, the fried rice cake we had there last time was 10 times better. I have come to the conclusion that either they had hired a new chef or just suck at maintaining the quality of food at a consistent level.

Having had a subpar dining experience at Tony Hu's other award winning Lao restaurant -- i.e. Lao Szechuan -- I was a bit skeptical. Much to my relief, Lao Shanghai exceeded my non-existent expectations. Eight plump and juicy xiao long bao were excellent starters. Rich in flavor and chewy in texture, the only thing that could have possibly made this appetizer a flawless one is the amount of broth spewing out from these ""soup dumplings."" Mains were Lao Shanghai's signature Shanghai style fish fillet and the beef with green peppers (jalapenos.) Teeming with taste and rich in quality, both dishes were perfectly executed. At first glance, the Shanghai style fish fillet did not look too promising, but the wine sauce proved me wrong. Wanting to sample as much Shanghai cuisine as possible, we ended our meal with an order of the sweet red bean pan cake. Flaky dough encasing a thin layer of red bean, this was as good of an end to the meal as the xiao long bao were to the start of the meal.

2010-01-29,5.0,"Let me preface this review by telling you all that I am not a neophyte when it comes to eating in Chinatown.  Chinatown is definitely my favorite dining neighborhood in the city and I come here frequently despite it not being close/convenient at all and have done so for the last two decades.  That should prepare you for the epic statement I am about to reveal: with the unfortunate burning down of Penang, this is my new favorite restaurant in all of Chinatown. What is so great about Lao Shanghai? The food - Shanghainese cuisine is pretty great.  It is spicy, eclectic, and overall delicious.  So far I have tried about 30 dishes from the menu, I haven't had any bad ones yet (I've had dishes that I thought were not amazing or as good as the best menu items, but none I would classify as bad).  Some of my favorites are the smoked tea duck, pork with edamame, sizzling lamb, and the 8 precious.  The signature dish of this restaurant is most assuredly the xiao long bao aka the soup dumplings, you must try this if you go here.  As with most chinese restaurants, I recommend going in a large group and ordering several dishes, we usually do one dish per person in the group and some amount of dumplings.  This ensures that you will get to try a lot of the many dishes this restaurant has to order, and that's the way it should be. The service - This is the best service in Chinatown, probably of any Chinese restaurant I've been to.  Usually when I go to a Chinese restaurant I expect to have to flag down the waitstaff when I need help, negotiate our order like a hostage situation, and deal with other unforeseen issues.  Not so here, Elaine and Tony (I know their names because they are always working here and because they are awesome)  are always there to take your order when you want to eat, recommend dishes, refill your tea, get you another beer,  and generally make your eating experience pleasant. The price - This place is so reasonable.  I always stuff myself silly when I come here, sometimes also drink beers, and I never pay above 20$.  Again, see my recommendation of coming with a large group, it will definitely be cheaper that way (coming by yourself or with 2 will usually be more expensive since you'll want to order more than 1 dish per person since there are so many choices). The atmosphere - the paintings and calligraphy on the wall are all very beautiful and authentic, helping make this place seem like a restaurant you might walk into in Shanghai.  The place is also clean, with a clean bathroom, which you should never take for granted in Chinatown.  The only detriment of this restaurant is that because it is so popular, it is sometimes hard to get seated, especially on weekend evenings. Overall this one is a Chinatown gem, I've introduced many to it and they are rarely disappointed.  Hope to be visiting for decades to come.",0.9978,0.803,0.172,0.025,0.5604877091719197

For our entrees we had empress chicken, salt and pepper fish fillet, and beef with broccoli.  All of them were amazing.  The fish was flaky and flavorful.  The beef was nice and lean and juicy.  The empress chicken was crunchy on the outside from the breading, and tender and juicy in the center.   All in all it was a great meal.  Each dish was done perfectly, and everything had a lot of flavor.  Plus each person got their own bowl of rice!  The bill for all those dishes plus 2 glasses of wine and 2 pots of tea was $66, which seems like an amazing deal!

So, after JN said he was craving xiao long bao (and he NEVER wants to eat asian food, well, hardly ever) we hopped in the car for an early Chinatown dinner. A 4:30pm arrival in Chinatown made street parking really easy. There was only 1 other table at Lao Shanghai when we walked in and most of the staff was at another table prepping green beans. Mmm, green beans. Anyway, we ordered: 2 steamers of xiao long bao Vegetarian duck (cold appetizer) Hot and sour soup (yeah, weird, but I was really cold that day, and it was good!) Tong cai (ong choi) stir-fried with garlic Pork, mustard greens, and peas (the peas are actually edamame) The menu is pretty enormous and ordering for 2 was a little painful, as I really had to hold back. But I really like this place and will be back soon (hellooooo pork belly).  Everything was delicious! I absolutely adore food from Shanghai because their vegetarian cold dishes are incredible. All made from bean curd products, it is very different from the fake meat you find here. This means: order the vegetarian duck!!!  As for the xiao long bao, I don't know where else to get good xiao long bao in this city. Place bao in spoon, bite little piece of wrapper off, SIP hot salty soup (mmmmmm), put some vinegar with ginger pieces into bao through opening, and nom nom nom. Repeat. If I wanted to be picky, I would say that the wrapper is a little on the thick side and they seem to only use pork as filling in theirs. My favorite xiao long bao are the pork and crab (!!!) ones but then again, I was in Shanghai. They don't always have tong cai but if they do, it is such a treat. Also know as the vegetable with the hole in the middle, I eat this every chance I get. We really had a lot of fun here. JN got to practice his Chinese by reading the menu, I got to feel at home by ordering in Chinese, the servers were really friendly and the food came out fast.  I love every one of Tony's restaurants.

2009-10-16,3.0,"Upon entering, I saw an old Chinese couple just finishing up their meals.  In my mind I thought, ""Ah, old Chinese people are eating here, this place must be good.""  The size of the restaurant was smaller than I had expected, and while the walls were elegantly decorated, I couldn't say the same for the tables and the floor tiles.  Each table had a white piece of parchment paper covering the white tablecloth underneath and it reminded me of the Macaroni Grill.  I had the weird sensation of asking the waiter for crayons.  The floor tiles clashed with the rest of the decor.  It was something more suited for the bathroom.  Ok, on to the food. The first dish I ordered was the xiao long bao.  Since the place is called Lao Shanghai, I figured it would be fairly decent.  The dumplings came out in a bamboo steamer and boy, was I ready to dig in.  As I lifted the lid, I noticed the dumplings were a bit undersized.  Is the shrinkage from the cold weather?  As I took the first one out of the steamer, I noticed that the wrapper was a bit on the thick side.  Taking a bite, I thought to myself, ""where's the hot, steamy, mouth-blistering broth?""  There's barely any broth in the dumplings.  All in all, I was extremely disappointed with the dumplings and I would compare them to store  bought brands.  There's a restaurant by where I live in New Jersey and it's far better than what was served at Lao Shanghai.  Damn, Chicago - 0, New Jersey - 1 The next dish that came was the Braised Pork Belly in Preserved Bean Curd Sauce.  I was expecting something like the picture shown in the menu, but instead out came this gelatinous mass that was a little too heavy on the red food coloring.  After brushing off the thick red sauce, the pork belly that was revealed underneath was actually quite tasty.  After downing all that pork and pork fat, I realized that I didn't really taste any of the bean curd that it was braised in.  I don't think I've had that much pork fat in a while.  I felt like a pork slut afterwards. Next was the seasonal Tong Cai greens stir-fried with garlic.  This dish was fresh, the flavor was just right and didn't have the overpowering taste in garlic.  All in all, a job well done. The forth dish I ordered was the Beef Short Ribs in Chef's Special Sauce.  Odd, I didn't find anything special about it.  The short ribs were dry, a bit chewy, and way too salty. The food at the restaurant is average, and this is supposed to be one of the better restaurants in Chinatown?  What a joke!  Maybe I went into the restaurant with high expectations and high hopes.  There's nothing that really distinguishes this place from all the other Chinese restaurants I have eaten at.  Even though the place is called Lao Shanghai, a good number of dishes are not Shanghainese, but in fact remind me more of Cantonese cuisine.  On a lighter note, the price point will do little damage to your wallet.  Each lunch portion I ordered hovered around the $4.50 mark and the portions are more than enough for the average person.  If you're looking for an authentic Shanghainese Restaurant, this place isn't it. 3 Stars Overall, 2 Stars for the Xiao Long Bao.",0.9324,0.889,0.067,0.044,0.40715866144437574

Our group had made a reservation in advance, confirmed earlier that day, but when we arrived minutes before our reservation time, it was apparent no table would be available for us. The one table that could have accommodated us was occupied, and just recently. That group had not yet been served their food. I believe that those people took over our table. If they had just walked in off the street and helped themselves to what they thought was an open table, when in fact it was reserved, it was up to management to tell them that the table was not available. Instead, management chose to tell us to wait 10 minutes or so for some other tables to open up. Looking around it was clear that no one in the whole (very tiny) place was going to be ready to leave in that time. Let me add that the group that took our table had a number of children. Nothing against children, but they just do not eat as much as adults do; so again management made the wrong choice in seating them at our reserved table. We would have spent (and probably tipped) a lot more than that group. There are so many other great choices in Chinatown, why waste time with a poorly run establishment?

2009-05-08,4.0,"Lao Shanghai is one of those restaurants that my husband and i will list off in attempts in finding a place to eat in Chinatown.  Great food up to par with some of our favorites like Lao Sze Chuan =) First off, sorry to all you xiao long bao lovers of this place, but I didn't think it was all that great.  Not many places around here serve xiao long bao so i guess you can't be too picky, but Hmart and I'm sure some other asian grocery stores sell frozen xiao long bao that taste very very similar.  not saying theirs are frozen/not handmade, but i can get a bag of em (20 pieces?) for $5.   Most other items off the menu are pretty good.  When we dined in we tried (and almost every table around us tried as well) their dry chili chicken.  It's a Shanghai variation of Tony's Chicken at Lao Sze Chuan but not as saucey or sweet.  Bite-size pieces of chicken lightly fried up with dry chilis and scallions.  A little salty with a hint of spice, but not tongue on fire hot.  my husband loved this dish.  We also liked the salt and pepper tofu, though it would have been better with more salt and spice.  Other dishes we had were ok, but i would definitely go back for the chicken and tofu and to try other items. Service is prompt until you get your food.  When we were done and wanted the check, we had to flag someone down, but i think sometimes waiters/waitresses are trying to be sensitive to those things and not rush you?  All waitstaff was super nice and attentive.  I would definitely come back again to try out some of their other items.  I think i still like Lao Sze Chuan a little bit better though.  Shanghai seems more simple foods with good simple flavor.  Sze Chuan has more spices and stronger, more complex flavors.  Sze Chuan also has a huuuuuuge menu and plenty of seating.",0.9977,0.786,0.211,0.003,0.5805204517704516

The Xiao Long Bao soupy dumplings (on the menu under Shangai specialties) are good.  Not as good as we've had in NY, or SF, but decent.  This most recent time, the dumplings were the best of the 4 times, more broth inside than usual.   Not sure if they are tweaking the recipe.  They have a couple of different dumplings on the menu, so if you're not sure, ask the waiter for the Xiao Long Bao. We've generally ordered from the first page of Shanghai specialties.  We ordered a seafood casserole from the nightly specials menu one night and really enjoyed the complex flavors with the seafood.  The braised pork belly with special sauce is a bit too sweet and a bit too much pork belly.  The fish fillet pieces with special Shanghai sauce (notice a trend with special sauces here) had a nice complex flavor of rice wine with smooth fish fillet pieces.  This is a dish that can be a bit oily, but they make the sauce smooth without the feeling of greasiness.  The stir fried green beans were nicely flavored with dried shrimp and other seasonings and not greasy as well.

Normally I would just head on over to the restaurant since I live so close to Chinatown, but on this day I was feeling pretty lazy.  Lao Shanghai charges $3 to deliver, which is fine, considering their menu prices are entirely reasonable.   I got the Kung Pao Beef, which was excellent with lots of heat and no grisly beef.  The Sesame chicken was very good too, and doesn't come gussied up with some soggy-ass broccoli like other places.  One star short of 5 because of the Shanghai egg rolls, which I didn't find to be all that good.  I actually prefer the deep-fried freezer bag egg rolls other Chinese places have.",0.9627,0.763,0.175,0.062,0.5862121212121211
2008-07-23,4.0,"Part of the Tony Hu mini restaurant empire, Lao Shanghai in Chicago's Chinatown serves up a rather satisfying meal.  As a visitor to this fine city, had I not researched the restaurant options in the oddly constructed ""mall"" that housed this restaurant, I would have been at a loss as to which establishment to choose, since outside of medicinal and nick knack shops, the only other activity is to eat, as one restaurant after another lined this center. The shopping center is inverted - as we walked to it, all of the steel gates were down and given the time of day, 3:00 pm, we figured that we were out of luck for a late lunch/very early dinner, as we assumed that the restaurants were closed, however, as we walked alongside the building, we discovered the walkway, which was the center of the mall and all of the businesses were open. I'm a bit of a nut for xian long bao and Lao Shanghai did not disappoint.  Full of piping hot juice, these 8 little tender balls of yumminess were a mere $4.95, a bargain compared to the Mag Mile Shanghai Terrace restaurant at the Peninsula Hotel where they charge almost $12.00 for 4.  I've had xian long bao that was more flavorful at other restaurants in Shanghai and in San Francisco, but I would return to Lao Shanghai for another 2 orders again. General chicken was crisp and well prepared, but one of my favorite side dishes was the Shanghai broccoli - thinly sliced and just a touch spicy, this vegetable side dish was fantastic.

2008-07-01,4.0,"I brought my two picky eaters here for dinner after a day walking all over China Town.  The husband was worried it would be expensive as the interior is much nicer than our usual Chinatown staples & the waiters were practically fawning all over us.  Being used to somewhat more curt service and grim interiors around China Town, this was a very pleasant surprise. I wanted my sister in law to have a chance to try the xiao long bao - she lives in a small town in Connecticut and doesn't have a lot of variety amongst her usual dining choices - so we started out with an order of those, a Hot and Sour soup for me, and a chicken soup for the  cowardly dining brigade, comprised of my husband and his little sister.  They also ordered the cashew and the orange chicken (see what I mean?) while I got the salt and pepper fish.  I was going to get the salt and pepper crab, but the waiter warned me off telling me it was very, very messy as it was still in the shell ~ very nice of him. The soups were great and the servings generous.  The chicken soup for two could easily serve twice that number.  My hot and sour was one of the better versions I've had in Chicago and I'd certainly go back for that alone. The xiao long bao, while good, were a bit of a disappointment - as other reviewers have noted, they are a bit dry.  Still good, but I really like them more soupy.  Perhaps we got them on an off night. Entrees  were excellent - my salt and pepper fish was incredible, the very, very best I've ever had - light batter, perfectly spiced, fresh and delectable fish.  The husband's safe cashew chicken was just that; quite good, but nothing to write home about.  The little sister in law's Orange chicken was a really pleasant surprise - I'm not a fan of Orange chicken at all, but hers was really fantastic.  The breading was not too heavy, it wasn't too sweet, and the sauce was light enough that you could still taste the chicken.  The portions are HUGE - unless you want leftovers, 3 people could easily share two entrees.  We had to pack up over 1/2 of the food we ordered to take home. Soup dumplings, soup, and 3 ridiculously generous entrees set us back about $40 bucks with tip.  The staff is fantastic, the interior lovely, the food is relatively inexpensive & quite good, and my two picky dining companions loved everything.  A new addition to my usual China Town rotation ~ hooray!",0.9988,0.696,0.248,0.056,0.6211351417399803

We also had a couple of other dishes, including clams, duck, and some veggies.  With the exception of the clams, everything was excellent.  In fact, my stomach still kind of hurts from eating entirely too much duck.

Toward the end fo the meal, Tony came by and gave us a complimentary dessert:  a crepe-like thing (more like a flour tortilla) filled with red bean paste.  It looked like a quesadilla, but was sweet and yummy.  Overall, it was a good experience.",0.9956,0.746,0.218,0.036,0.5609584859584859
