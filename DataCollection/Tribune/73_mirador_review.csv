2016-01-24,5.0,"Thanks to our friends who suggested this place,  we were able to try it with them last night.  It's a short walk from our condo which we really like. We showed up a bit late for our reservations but had called to let them know. Unfortunately we had to wait a bit for a table to be available so the wonderfully charming owner/chef bought us a drink to make it right. The drinks were delicious and the bartender was gracious. While we waited for our table we listened to a musician sing and play guitar. Great selection of songs by current artists. The place is warm and inviting and very well decorated. I loved the feel of the place! The menu is diverse and has several gluten free dishes which always makes me happy. I had the Coq Au Vin. It was fantastic. The chicken and the mushrooms with that sauce went so well together. The rest of my group all loved their meals too. I look forward to trying another dish soon as well as listen to music. Great night, thanks Mirador.",0.9981,0.63,0.357,0.013,0.5907242063492063

2015-12-21,4.0,"I thought this place was great. If you like live music this place is for you, that touch is perfect. I thought just the waiters and waitresses coming out to order took forever. I was there with 4 people and it took 45 minutes to get our food. Their service is really nice. I also liked how they asked questions instead of just going ahead.

The dish is good enough to take home and snuggle it in bed... if you're into that sort of thing. Otherwise, just eat it at the restaurant while you enjoy a great cocktail and live music on Friday or Saturday night.",0.9819,0.692,0.308,0.0,0.5388888888888889
2015-10-06,4.0,"Looks like there have been several (excellent) changes to the menu since I've last been here. Lots more veg/pescatarian options, which is great! We got a bottle of Pinot Noir and shared some (Tuesday half-price) appetizers and all menu items were delicious. And, our dog eats a dog treat every few days from the bowl of treats they leave out, so that has tempered my friendly feelings towards Mirador. Bartender was nice, too. All in all, and much improved food experience, made excellent by the feeling that we had a lot to choose from despite not eating meat.",0.9814,0.729,0.26,0.01,0.556060606060606
2015-10-03,4.0,"This place has potential. The menu is pretty standard, which is not entirely a bad thing for a neighborhood restaurant, however, they need to step it up a bit. Both my appetizer and entree came lukewarm; I didn't say anything because the waitress was so nice and I noticed that one of the customers in the table next door was being a TOTAL prick to her. The escargots were very light on the garlic (really!?) and for dessert we ordered the beignets which were good but a bit dry, even though they came with sauce; they should've given you the option of a side of ice cream. I gave them four stars because the ambiance was outstanding and the live music was nice and not loud. It was definitely a date night crowd. I also liked that there was equally as many opposite as same sex couples there. Friendly place. I'm gonna give it another shot. One last thing to the management: the servers wearing ""Mirador"" T-shirts don't look very classy. What's wrong with the standard white shirt and long waist apron? You can take it from there and get creative.",0.9781,0.789,0.165,0.046,0.5604761904761906

2015-07-12,3.0,"So much good, but enough bad that it is worth noting. Been here twice, first time for drinks with family, second for dinner.  Pros: location and venue are fantastic. Super cute local spot in the neighborhood so you get the neighborhood feel. Outdoor seating, although we chose to sit inside with a nice outdoor view. Customer wise, a mix as there were families with kids and/or dogs outside. Inside, was more of a date night crowd.  Bartender and drinks - shawty is awesome. Personable and knows how to recommend and make amazing drinks.  Live music - Friday nights, they have a live guitarist who was fantastic. Great add.  Cons: wanted to love the food as it looked like it had so much potential, but it was just so so bland. I ordered the half roasted chicken and husband ordered the shredded chicken pasta. Both weren't terrible, but they weren't anything I would order again, as they lacked flavor in every aspect.  Cost - at $30/ plate I would expect the food to be good. It wasn't which makes the cost way too high Service - for food and water, slow as all get out. Took 45 mins to get our entrees. Wasn't an extremely big deal as the bartender made it up with drinks always being served and the live music entertaining us, however it is worth noting. Summary - we will be back, but only for drinks before going to eat at another restaurant",0.9973,0.731,0.253,0.016,0.5890740740740741

The look and feel of the place was really well thought through and attention to detail complemented the older building (which comes with history - I won't spoil it - ask the owner to tell some stories) Now onto the drinks. Your not short changed here. Drinks were strong and almost over poured. No complaints here. Wine selection was spot on and reasonable prices as well.  Let's go to the food. We had a table of 6 people and each had a different meal. There were no complaints from the following selections: short rib, salmon, risotto, mahi, filet  and roasted chicken.  Bartender was great and very interactive. Chef was out to meet and great and we love the personal attention.  Will be back for sure!",0.9609,0.749,0.185,0.066,0.5062091503267974

The charcuterie plate had a nice assortment of nibbles and lots of cheese, so a good appy for 4. The black bean hummus was light and flavorful. We had the beet salad, roasted cauliflower salad and the panzanella salad. All were interesting variations. I like my panzanella with a little more tomato but otherwise the salads were a hit. The braised short ribs and pulled chicken pasta were both well received--we will have both again! The caramel salted potato chips, YUM, and the apple tart was perfect.

Food: B-, started with beef tips, way overdone, and a really small portion. Not super impressed. I got the baked salmon for dinner, which was excellent! My boyfriend got a butternut squash ravioli special, which was ok, nothing to write home about. For the price, we were not wowed by the food (with the exception of the salmon).

2015-04-02,2.0,"This place is fine. Really, fine is the word. It is cute and quaint and the staff and atmosphere are really nice. The food is mediocre. The burger is bland and tough. The fries are bland and soggy. The flatbread is fine, but the bread comes from Cosco and the pre-cubed portobello chunks are hardly ""wild mushrooms."" But it's good.  The drinks are fine. But EVERYTHING is overpriced. This is a neighborhood spot that wants to charge $28 for entrees. And it doesn't deliver at that price point.  That's probably why it's always empty. I'm just not sure they're good enough for be charging $60/diner for an evening. They won't make it as a destination restaurant, but I hope they find a way to make it work as a neighborhood spot.",0.9337,0.803,0.155,0.042,0.6522875816993464
