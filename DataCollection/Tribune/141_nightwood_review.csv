This was by far one of my favorite places I visited while in Chicago. The space is so rustic, I could see myself venturing out here in the mornings for brunch. I really liked the chairs so much, I had to sneak a picture of one. This is also one of the first places that I have come across to have polenta on the menu so early in morning, and I loved every last savory bite! If it was socially acceptable, I probably would've licked the bowl... I scraped the bowl with my spoon for good measure though. This was really the perfect way to end my Chicago visit.

2015-07-10,5.0,"Attention Chicago: nightwood closes on Saturday.  GO GO GO GO GO.  I went here last night as a goodbye to my favorite restaurant.  We got to sit on the beautiful patio, right next to the fireplace (which they unfortunately did not light!).  The atmosphere was perfect - the restaurant was busy and loud because everyone's trying to get their last trip in, but the restaurant maintains an aura of peace/ happiness. The meal was so good, I legitimately shed a tear over the fact that I'll never get to eat at Nightwood again.  We got: -Chicken liver mousse with strawberries, mint, snap peas, and Szechuan pepper - the mousse was so smooth and flavorful!  It tasted like delicious silk.  I wished they'd given us more amazing, toasty bread to go with it but instead we just opted to pack tons of mousse onto every slice and this was totally fine with me.  The strawberries went so well with it. -spit-roasted, maple-glazed half chicken with cashew bread salad, chili oil, ham, and pea shoots - this was the part of the meal that brought on emotions.  I usually don't get chicken dishes when I go out to eat, but I always get them at nightwood because they're so INSANELY good.  The flavors, sweet and spicy, paired together perfectly, allowing for a rich, incredibly tasty dish.  If you make it there in the next two days, I beg you to get this; eating it was an experience that I'm sad I'll never have again. -the nightwood cheeseburger - always said I was going to get it next time I went...so now was the time!  It was very well-cooked and seasoned.  I wish there had been more cheese and sauce because it did taste a little plain.  All in all though, this was our least favorite dish of the meal and it was still very, very good.   Nightwood, I'll miss you.  Chicagoans, GO NOW.",0.9968,0.784,0.195,0.021,0.5877655677655677

Our table was small there was a 4 person table to the left and to my right another 2 person table. Very close togther, i didnt feel like i was having dinner with my husband, instead 6 strangers. We got oysters and spagetti for starters, my husband and i split the spagetti and he eat all the oysters. So he liked them. Spaghetti was okay very small portion we got about 2 medium bites not worth $15. Dinner options were bad from the start. I had the trout which seemed okay but the waitress described something completely different. She said crispy skin and the skin was slimmy and it had this weird popcorn like crust that was disgusting. She came over about 30 seconds after we got our meal so i told here it was fine because i didnt even take a bit. It was pretty gross l moved all the skin and popcorn crust off and eat about 1/2 of the bare fish. The bus boy took my plate away, not asking if i was happy with the meal. Next time the waitress came over was to drop off the dessert menu. On the car ride home my stomach started hurting and i got diarrhea from the meal.

I don't know why they are making their own bagels - mine was bread in the shape of a bagel, not an actual bagel (no bagel chew, and pretty lacking in flavor, which they tried to overcome with butter).   I had really high hopes for the donut (a fruit one, not the bacon one), and it was only alright, and certainly not worth the $5 they are charging for it. The tots are terrible: unseasoned fried balls of nothing.  Seriously, I had to dump salt on these, and that hardly helped. My partner had a scrambled egg dish that he said was pretty boring.  My friend ordered bacon (extra crispy) and toast and didn't eat the bacon, and the server didn't ask if there was a problem with the bacon.

I live nearby and love checking out the trendy restaurants in Pilsen. Don't get me wrong, I love my Mexican restaurants, but I can eat some foie gras and steak too. The menu changes so while looking at pictures will make your mouth water, know it might not be available. The place is GORGEOUS. So much space, even the patio seating is enclosed. All of the breeze, none of the pollen, of outside seating. While it looks faaaancy, they were family friendly during brunch time when we went. Bathrooms were clean, always a plus when we try someplace new.  Ok, now the food. Menu wasn't as crazy/weird as some other places I have gone. That's a good thing when dining with children. They were able to make a regular pancake with maple syrup for my 3 year old. My husband ordered the double burger (pictured) and I had the rolled omelet. We LOVED it. It was filling, but not like I need to take a nap filling. My omelet had ricotta and asparagus. The little brown balls are deep fried hash browns. Super tasty, and I like the crunchiness of them. Service was awesome, it was a Sunday so the full staff was out. My husband loved the burger,  cooked medium. It was a little heavy on the mayo ( I don't like mayo) my hubby thought it was perfect.  We ended it with a butterscotch glazed donut with bacon crumbles on top. YUMMMMM. Even my little one was eating bacon! Definitely recommend and would try again.

2015-06-05,4.0,"Located at 21st and Halsted, Nightwood is kind of in the rapidly gentrifying Pilsen neighborhood, but not really. A little off the main drag nexus of 18th and Blue Island, Nightwood feels like its own little outpost away from it all. It still subscribes to the Chicago-patented ""Trendy Casual American (New)"" that defines the mid-price point deliciousness of the city. We went for a last-minute, no reservations brunch and were seated in the the very lovely courtyard. On a good day (like that day), the shining light and charming atmosphere already provides a scenic sereneness perfect with a cup of joe and a plate of eggs. The butterscotch donut with bacon crumble? It's all that Yelp says it is. I love me the maple bacon donuts of Chicago (get thee to Bridgeport Bakery), but I'm totally willing to pay the premium for Nightwood's concoction. That bad boy costs $5, but the superior bacon plus butterscotch plus sugared donut holes on the side are worth the willingness to pay. The brunch menu is scant and short, but chock full of good stuff. The bagel sandwich gets lots of love. Its description leads with a smoked trout cream cheese spread. Note, though, that the main meat of the sandwich is crispy bacon, and that the trout is infused in the spread. Regardless, it's a very good brunch option. The accompanying potato croquettes might be my favorite thing on the menu. I went with the polenta, which was solid, though the short rib was extremely rich for breakfast. The soft boiled egg was cooked perfectly. I almost got the fabled cheeseburger, and after seeing another table receive that order, I got that buyer's remorse thing. Alas. Our table also ordered the scrambled eggs (mostly for the baby, natch), which was solid as well. Nightwood definitely gets plus points on a good-weather day, as the patio setting is hard to beat. The food is good, and with a lot of similar competition in the city, the unique location becomes a key differentiator. Food-wise, there are other, similar places I just like better (think Dusek's nearby), but I won't dissuade you if you think Nightwood is amongst the best.",0.9981,0.722,0.23,0.048,0.5770217803030304

Each dish had a beautiful presentation, just the right amount of serving, and most importantly had wonderful flavors.  For the main course I ordered the half chicken dish.

I'll start with the pros of this place.  Very nice atmosphere and the staff was amazing.  I mean, I've been to a lot of restaurants and have friends who own restaurants and they Nightwood is definitely one of the best for service. Now the food.  One think I can say about every single dish is salty.  Very, very, very salty.  I was constantly drinking water and this morning I woke up feeling awful after these courses.  Also, it's almost like there are too many things going on in every dish.  Like, just over thought and the flavors just didn't make sense. For the first course we had the burrata with white asparagus and dill and the spinach and endive salad.  I'll sum it up.  VERY SALTY.  I actually didn't finish the burrata.  it wasn't my thing to be honest.  The salad was a highlight.  The dressing was very good but it was salty.  My partner said that she thought it was salty right away.  Anyway, we moved on.  Second course was the red wine braised lamb neck and borlotti beans and the pasta with a hazelnut sauce.  The star here was the lamb neck.  Just that though.  The other flavors in the dish made no sense to me.  The beans seemed dry and old and had no flavor.  The sauce it was in was sort of bitter.  Anyway, we ate around everything and only took the meat.  Now the pasta.  The sauce was good.  We ate the majority.  But the spaghetti used was grossly under cooked almost like it was sitting under a heat lamp for a while.  The sauce was very good.  But all in all it was very salty as well.  The last course was the maitake mushroom and the hanger steak.  The mushroom dish was so salty that I took one bite and could barely swallow it.  And the mushroom was just not good.  When we tried it, it was almost like when you have to respect your grandma's cooking even though it's bad.  The flavors again made no sense to me.  There was a lot going on that turned me off.  The first hanger steak I received was cold so I sent it back for another and I got a hot steak that was cooked perfectly.  But the cut I received the second time had a lot of gristle and again, it was overly salted.  And the feta and chickpeas are a nice touch, but the feta just added to the salty flavor.  I don't want to get into dessert because I saw cracker jacks on one plate and cheez-it bits on the other.  And I just laughed.  But the desert was good.  Probably the star of the entire course.   Honestly, when we left we could barely feel our tongue.  Everything was over seasoned and for the prices you pay you'd expect more dishes that make sense.  Then again, any place that charges $16 for a burger you might have to question.  Is the food the star or is the chef just showing off?  I've been to a lot of places around the world and this being in my home town in very low on the list.  I usually don't go on yelp and post a review.  This time I had to because the prices don't match up the quality and execution.  What a let down.",0.9956,0.795,0.14,0.065,0.468479797979798

2015-04-08,5.0,"I went to Nightwood when it opened and had not been back since. I think my first visit was sometime in the fall of 2008 because I recall listening to Vampire Weekend on the drive to the restaurant but I could be wrong. Anyhow, I finally back came to Nightwood two weeks ago to get the burger because I'm in a burger club with some friends. We call it Burgz with Friends (it's a play on words). The burger was delicious in a totally unmanageable way. I cut my burgers in half because I'm civilized like that. I don't not regret that decision (I couldn't envision eating any more than a half of this grass-fed-monster) but the mess -as others have noted - is real. Lost among this beef-analysis is the fries are really good also. Would happily return to eat again. It's an interesting trend that almost all contemporary-American/farm-to-table restaurants have a burger on their menu now. I'm all for giving the people what they want (I certainly have eaten my share of burgers at restaurants known for cuisine to which burgers aren't native i.e. Owen & Engine, Three Aces, etc) but part of me wonders if some of these chefs don't resent customers like myself i.e. the internet-reader-eaters that have come in specifically to try one menu item that is sort of an aberration amidst the rest of their menu. For example, Acadia is now known for their burger. This dude has a Michelin star and people write about them to talk about their burger. That's not cool, I think. Maybe it is. You know what? I'm not sure I care. I'm going back for the burger. I think I hate Nightwood.",0.9621,0.758,0.15,0.092,0.5150992063492064

The food at Nighwood is tasty, but that burger is enormous and really could be shared by two people.  We made the mistake of having an appetizer and drinks two doors down at Del Toro.  Don't make the same mistake we did - just don't.  You're hungry?  Trust me, you can wait. I made reservations a week or two in advance for a Tuesday at 6:00 p.m.  When we arrived, there was only one other table occupied.  By the time we left, there was a good crowd, but I would not say that reservations are mandatory on a weeknight.  Service was fantastic.  Our server was attentive and did a great job explaining some of the drinks to us. Try the cocktails!  I had the ""Fit and Working Again,"" with vodka, apple crisp, elderflower, and lemon.  I love drinks with elderflower, and this one was fantastic.  Courtney C had a drink with blackberry in it and spent a few minutes pondering how to make her own at home.  The cocktails at Nightwood are fabulous - get one! We both started with the Sunchoke Clam Chowder, which is as good as soup is ever going to get.  For $10, you get a large bowl of soup, but I would have been happy with a smaller portion.  I mean, $10 for SOUP?  It was very good though, and it was a $10 well spent.  Nightwood also serves piping hot, complimentary pretzel bread and garlic butter.  I shouldn't have eaten all of that bread... Then came the burger, which was more like a TOWER of food.  The burger was cooked to my liking, and very good.  I don't think it cracked my top 5 though.  As I mentioned before, this burger is a total belly buster.  We each ate about half of ours and took the rest home.  The burger is also served with a massive portion of fries, which are also very good.

Our Waiter was such a nice guy.  He was helpful in making suggestions and checking on us throughout our dining experience to make sure we were enjoying.

We were seated around the time of our reservation (reservations are recommended).  Service was good.  Our waitress was helpful in providing wine and food recommendations.  She checked on us the right amount and no one batted an eye that we had a very long dinner.  Even though our table had a mix of still and sparkling water, they got it right the entire night (and I got to avoid my ""I-really-don't-like-sparkling-water"" face).  For appetizers, we split the potato risotto, the spinach and endive salad and the steak tartare. While I don't say it often, the salad was my favorite starter.  It was fresh and the pecorino cheese was amazing.  There was just enough of the tasty buttermilk-hemp seed dressing without it being overdressed.  However, I would skip the potato risotto next time (with uni butter and black truffles). First, the risotto was undercooked and had too much of a bite to it.  The other problem was I didn't get the uni taste from the uni butter and it was a small portion for $18.  The entrees were tasty.  We tried the trout, cod, winter squash, and pork belly.  We also split the carrots and beets for sides which the table enjoyed.  Everything was cooked perfectly and it is hard to pick a favorite.  The winter squash dish was very flavorful. While I don't normally pass the meat dishes for vegetarian dishes, I just couldn't put it down which says a lot.  Of the two fish dishes, I preferred the cod with the light lemon sauce.  The fish was so tender and flakey it was falling off my fork. The pork belly and the trout were very good but I preferred the other two entrees.  With good food and service, next up is to try their brunch.",0.9638,0.884,0.091,0.025,0.5629505135387488

Many restaurants have items on their Restaurant Week menus that aren't on their regular menus, so it's hard to know if you're actually getting a deal and you don't get to try the great dishes that everyone talks about. Nightwood, however, was offering their big fat Nightwood Cheeseburger, usually found for $16 on their regular menus, as part of their $22 3-course lunch menu during restaurant week. Not only is the cheeseburger one of their most popular dishes, for 3 courses it was a total steal! Those two juicy patties topped with 8-year cheddar, a crispy onion ring, crunchy pickles, mustard, and special sauce, served with a side of fries, made it a no-brainer. I added a glass of their Black Currant Fizz soda, the bright Beet Salad with winter citrus, and the tart Honey Goat Cheese Ice Cream to round out a DELICIOUS weekday lunch.

Ever since then, Nightwood has been on my list of places to go, and Chicago Restaurant Week provided the perfect opportunity. The place looks pretty small from the outside. We got seated in the front room, which was pretty tight space wise. This could be a disadvantage for some places with the setup not being conducive to intimate conversation; I didn't get that feel at all here since the area wasn't loud and we could comfortably carry out a conversation while enjoying our meal. We had a few choices for our four course prix-fixe meal: I started off with the dry aged beef tartare, with rich duck yolk, parsley, winter pickles, and tallow roasted bread.  Second, I had the sunchoke & clam bisque, with grilled sage, sweet leeks, & Pecorino Toscana. The main course consisted of the braised pork, with eight winter vegetables. (I didn't count, I trust the chef put exactly eight in there). The menu was capped with a plate of apple bread pudding with vanilla creme fraiche, pine nuts, house made cheese its (yum!) & rosemary ice cream. I was comfortably full after that meal; everything that I ate was a nice mixture of sweet, sour, and succulent. It also helped that we had a long walk back to the car afterwards to work the meal off. Service was great and I can tell that the chef had a great attention to detail with each plate. This is definitely a place worth coming back to.",0.9939,0.779,0.195,0.026,0.5052827380952382

2015-01-27,4.0,"Nightwood has been on my to-do list for.. well.... a long time. Suffice it to say that the only thing keeping me from going was that (I think) they used to not take OpenTable reservations, and I was like ""I have to actually talk to a person to make reservations? nah son"". The other day though, I noticed them showing up on OpenTable and made a reservation immediately. We came in on a Saturday night at 5:30pm and were seated quickly. The interior of the restaurant is super cozy and cool - lots of wood, industrial looking, pretty much right up my alley decor-wise. There were several other people dining so it was lively but the atmosphere was still relatively intimate - good place to bring your friends, parents, or a date (but probably a good idea to leave the under-12 set at home). We started off with the potato gnocchi appetizer, which was delicious and topped with sliced truffles (this was a kicker for me - the menu says truffles, and usually I anticipate ground truffles because that's what most places do - they actually give you whole slices! Hallelujah.) They also give you bread to start. Not sure if this changes with the menu, but ours was house-made pretzel bread with butter or spread of some sort. No idea what the spread actually was but it was buttery (yay) and also green (??). Delicious though, so I didn't actually really care what it was. I had the huckleberry smoked and glazed pork belly and my dining companion had the wood-grilled duck breast. The pork belly was amazing in texture and I loved that it didn't have huge hunks of fat on it - fat on pork belly is obviously essential, but sometimes there's just way too much of it. Not the case here. My one complaint was that it was a bit too salty, but I cleaned my plate so it couldn't have been too bad. The quinoa was surprisingly good too - I don't usually like quinoa, but it worked well on this dish. I also sampled the duck breast, which was tender and delicious as well. For dessert we ordered the honeycrisp apple bread pudding. One of my favorite dishes of the night probably - the bread pudding is more bread than pudding (if they hadn't called it that on the menu, I would never have guessed) but really tasty and came with a side of rosemary ice cream. Have you ever had rosemary ice cream? Me neither, and I'm a better person now for having tried it (just kidding, but it was really unexpectedly good). Overall a really nice experience - definitely worth a trip on a special occasion. I'm hoping to try their brunch the next time around!",0.997,0.782,0.175,0.043,0.514768806073154

The biscuit was nice and moist and easy to cut up with each bite of the shrimp and gravy, so I was a happy camper.

They looked like little pieces of art they were definitely the fanciest breakfast hashbrowns ever.

Our French toast came with  pear compote and a well paired cinnamon spiced creme anglaise- sweet tooth required for this dish! Other dishes are more contemporary, like my favourite dish of the day, confit duck and goats cheese crepes. Rich and juicy duck meat, delicate freshly made crepes and a perfectly runny egg to top it off! We also ordered the cavatelli, which although flavourful, for me was the least successful. Served with a rich tomato sauce and topped with an egg, which for my taste could have been a touch runnier, and the pasta was ever so slightly underdone, bordering on chewy in some places. Please note this is me being real picky!! Another house speciality are the donuts, labeled as starters on the menu.

Salmon with spaghetti squash: This may have been the juicest piece of salmon I have ever eaten!  Another nicely balanced dish served with perfectly done spaghetti squash and some kind of green (don't remember what it was).  So delicious, highly recommended if you're in the mood for fish! Cheeseburger with fries: This burger was outstanding, right up there with other gourmet burger places in LA like Father's Office and Standing Room.  The cheddar and mustard went so well together, beef patties were a perfectly done medium, and the thick skin-on fries were the perfect complement. Highly recommended!  Peach cake: Our server recommended this and we really enjoyed it.  It was served a la mode and I think I remember a little ginger in there too.  Recommended.

I ordered the cheeseburger which is probably the cheapest thing on the menu; however, you get the largest portion of food.  The burger is a double burger with 8 year old aged chedder cheese in melted form.  They also top it with onion rings, lettuce and pickles.  The pickles were so fresh they actually stood out in taste, especially blended with the amazing chedder sauce.  The was absolutely delicious too.  The beef was of top quality but in thin patty form.  The great news is they put two patties on the burger, so you get double the burger goodness.  The fries were really good, not home cut in appearance but the taste says otherwise.   The wait staff is extremely attentative and do not leave you thirsty of sitting in filth.  After your complementary bread with jam they wipe down your area, after your appetizer they wipe down your area, after your meal they wipe down your area, after your desert they wipe down your area.  They also refill your water glass constantly as soon as someone, anyone, at your table gets half full.   The desert I had was a chocolate tart with strawberys and ice cream filled into it.  The ice cream on the side was amazing and fresh tasting.  The tart was thick and rice, but not too rich.

The menu was promising, with innovative combinations and seemingly good ingredients. However, some things didn't work so well -- and all were way over-salted. We started with a couple of small plates. Grilled octopus in a molé did not work for me -- the sauce was too gloppy, too picanté and too salty, overpowering the delicate octopus. Churchillini, an amusing handmade pasta aggregation, would have been pleasant but for the salt. Ditto a striped bass entrée; the delicate morels and other ingredients were overpowered by, you guessed it -- salt. A grilled sirloin steak with potatoes and romesco was pretty good, though a salty buttermilk dressing detracted. Dessert, a cherry pie & ice cream montage tagged ""Special Agent Dale Cooper"", was pleasant enough -- and it was not salty! So what's with all this salt? We were wondering if no one actually tasted things in the kitchen, or if they just salt everything with wild abandon (as has been the case with a couple of other seemingly conscientious farm-to-table restaurants around town).

Yes, you might want to sit near the window to make sure that your car doesn't get broken into while you eat, but you won't be sorry you came. From beginning to end, this was a foodie's dream dining experience. Our server was one of the most genuinely nice people I've ever encountered in food service. Her attention to detail, and genuine interest in what we wanted was incredible. Even if the food sucked, I'd probably still walk out of here happy because her demeanor was just that refreshing. The two of us had some of the best meals we'd had in ages. The boyfriend started with some of the fried pig ear, about which he could not stop gushing. Although not my thing in the least, his obsession was so palpable that I had to take a small bite. Still not my thing, but that really doesn't mean anything. People who are into eating any part of Babe would, I'm sure, love those.

The person filling water however was completely on point - I never had less than half a glass full before he would swing by with a refill. The food was pretty good. We started with a tagliatelle with morels, a butter sauce, and some spring peas. Pasta was cooked well although there were not many mushrooms (from what I could see - maybe my dining mate vacuumed them into his mouth when I wasn't looking), and the spring peas were super fresh and delicious.  We also had the crispy pig ear app - the flavor of the dish was wonderful, but as my date mentioned after a few minutes of rather loud chewing, it was kind of a jaw workout.  The pig ears were somehow strangely chewy in places and super hard and ""crunchy"" in others. I was a little afraid of cracking a tooth.  For my entree I had the striped bass with a prosciutto and frisée salad and a 45 minute egg.

In from out of town for one night, I was staying in the Pilsen neighborhood and lucked upon Nightwood. First of all, the house cocktails are unlike anything I've seen before (even compared to NY or Miami). The combinations of liquor and house-infused intoxicants create flavors that are delightfully difficult to decipher-- and delicious and refreshing! Complexity, a bit of tartness, and cube-shaped ice cubes (my personal fave).  Starters and entreés are innovative, sometimes new twists on old (almost unrecognizable but in a good way) classics. For example, I chose to start with a salad made from a wedge of local lettuce, house-made green goddess dressing, and bacon croutons (it was more complex than that, but you get the idea... a new take on the ""wedge"" salad). The lettuce has true green flavor, the bacon bits were crunchy and chewy, and the other tidbits created additional complexity of flavor. A delightful touch is the house-made foccacia (lightest I've ever had) baked and served in an individual ramekin.  Desserts are equally inventive. Because I was visiting the midwest, I selected the rhubarb pie. It was baked as an individual tartlet and accompanied by a swoosh of honey-flavored crema (guaranteed to make you swoon), and a chèvre and honey flavored ice cream. A twist on grandma's classic, but updated. Yum! Dining alone is always a gamble. It can be weird or a special treat. The service was excellent and the server was happy to take the time to explain the cocktails and suggest wines to accompany each course.

I am glad that I took advantage when I did, as I am typing this and looking out at a wintry mix (rain/sleet). Mainly in mind of a drink, I decided to have a seat at the bar. I must have timed it right, as it was not nearly as hopping when I came in (around 7 pm) as it became later on. I went with a glass of the Wilamette Valley Sauvignon Blanc. It was a very smooth pour and the classic, crisp finish made me realize what I'd been missing all of these hibernating months with my default to Yellowtail Chardonnay. Later on, a couple came into the bar and sat down nearby. From the way the chef greeted them, I could tell that they were regulars here, so I decided to check out what they were ordering. I thought that I had gotten the same pasta dish as what they had ordered, but I ended up with the house-made pasta with a sauce that included veal. I was pleased that the portion was small, and not gut-busting, allowing me to savor the nuances of this decadent dish. The bread provided with dipping sauce was an inspired touch, as the bread appeared to have been baked in a mid-size ramekin and the cheese-based dipping sauce provided with it served as an excellent amuse bouche (though on a less precious scale) to whet my appetite for the main course.

I have heard nothing but good things about their excellent brunch, which is why I rallied a group of other first-timers for brunch last weekend. (Always a risk to pick the restaurant when you've never been), but that's how confident I was that our experience would be amazing! First of all, they were very busy- I get it. It's not easy to provide impeccable service when the place is overflowing with eager brunchsters. But I DO expect someone to swing by the table earlier than 15 minutes after we've been seated.  Unfortunately we had to flag down someone, who made it clear she was not our server, but would take our drink order (thanks?). However, she did end up being our server for the duration... The bloody mary was good- could have used more garnish, however, considering the price (cauliflower?) The doughnuts= amazing and worth it!!! Beyond that, our group was unimpressed with their food. My bagel sandwich was good, but it's hard to screw that up. No one in the group had rave reviews and (politely) said their entrees were 'fine!' I was surprised to find the lack of non-meat options on the menu. I realize as a pescatarian I am annoying, but a few items I asked if the bacon could be removed, and the server advised it was already 'mixed in' (um, pre made?) and therefore they could not accomodate. Which literally left me with the bagel sandwich or the yogurt as my options. Bottom line, the service was subpar, and the food was just 'OK'.

As you bite into it, the succulent mushrooms slowly release flavors while the ricotta pours a nice flavor over it.

2014-03-11,2.0,"I've never written a Yelp review before. I wish my first review were a positive one, but I was driven to create this account by a very disappointing dining experience at Nightwood. I had very high hopes for Nightwood. I tried to reserve a table for 2 for Valentine's Day with my girlfriend, but missed availability. So, I decided to reserve early for our anniversary one month later. I was expecting extremely fresh and tasty food from local suppliers. Maybe I hyped the restaurant too much in my mind from all the great reviews here, but it was by far my most disappointing dining experience in Chicago. The night started well. We were seated immediately upon arrival at a good table and were provided water and visited by our server within a few minutes. We ordered the crispy pig ears to start. They literally were brought to the table 1 minute after ordering them, were way too crunchy (almost to the point of hurting your teeth), were cold, and had obviously just been brushed with a sweet glaze. It was in no way fresh and seemed it had been sitting out for quite a while before being brought to our table. We looked passed the first appetizer and asked our server for a recommendation. He pointed us toward the veal shortrib casoncelli, which we ordered. About 5 minutes later the dish came out with 6 small pieces of stuffed pasta, each the size of a quarter on a huge white plate. The pasta was fresh, and the flavor was good, not great, but it seemed ridiculous to charge $18 for a plate with such small portions. I get that the pasta is handmade and used prime ingredients, but that breaks down to $3 per quarter-sized piece of pasta. If you're going to price dishes this way at least put it on an appropriate sized plate that complements the small portion, not exacerbates it. We were a bit turned off at this point, but still had high hopes for the main course. After asking our server for recommendations, I chose the top sirloin steak and my girlfriend chose the striped bass. As a side note, when I asked my server where the sirloin was sourced from, he didn't know. I asked if it was from Slagel Farms, and he said, ""Oh yeah, that place I think."" This wouldn't normally turn me off, but if you're featuring locally sourced protein dishes at those prices, please make sure servers are knowledgeable of the dishes. We then ordered a bottle of wine for the main course. When our server came back with the wine and poured, he spilled wine down the side of the bottle, on the label, on the side of my wine glass, and dripped wine onto the table. He didn't acknowledge any of this and didn't come back to wipe any of it up. If I hadn't noticed and had leaned forward on the table I would have stained my shirt. I waited for 10 minutes for it to be wiped down and then did it myself. After an appropriate amount of time the main dishes came out. They smelled and looked great. Upon looking closer at my steak, which I ordered rare-medium-rare, I could tell it was a bit overcooked to medium-medium-rare. No biggie. Then I took a bite and was completely overwhelmed by the saltiness of the dish. The steak was over-seasoned, not allowing me to taste the great piece of local meat I just ordered. Even worse, the farro beneath the steak was even saltier. I've never made faces at a nice dinner before, but I admit to contorting my face in reaction to the absurd levels of salt in this dish that ruined the taste of it all. I tried the steak just with the bacon jam, which was better, but overall it was a waste of $34. I implored my girlfriend to try her fish, hoping her main course was better than mine. I'm fine with my dish being bad on our anniversary, but not hers. The delicate striped bass was also a bit over cooked and over seasoned with salt. It wasn't as bad as the steak, but the salt overpowered the taste of the fish and threw the flavor profile of the dish out of balance. I know. I should have said something in the moment. Sent the dishes back. Grabbed the manager at that moment and said, can you make this right? But I didn't. I'm a bit shy, don't speak out at restaurants and didn't want to do so and mess up a nice anniversary dinner with my girlfriend. We did grab the manager on the way out. He listened to our concerns and said he wished I'd have said something during dinner service. He apologized, left our more than $200 bill on the table and walked away. I'm not looking for a discount, but the fact that nothing was done to make up for our bad experience was another turn off. I know I should have said something during dinner service and they probably would have fixed my dish. The bottom line is that I came here expecting what they advertise and was deeply disappointed. A restaurant critic won't send dishes back. They'll judge and review the restaurant based upon what was served and the overall experience. That's what I'm doing here.

Dark lighting, tight seating, and music loud enough to mute the surrounding conversations led to an intimate feel. Everything we tried was very good. After ordering the appetizer, the server brought out an individual focaccia bread - it was lightly salted and came with a cheese/oil dip. The bread was hot fresh and full of holes - really well done.  We had the braised shortrib ""ravioli"", which was pretty small given the price - but was really flavorful, and the pasta was perfectly cooked. We split the Nightwood burger and the duck cassoulet for the main dishes. The duck was juicy, with a very tasting bark on the outside of the slices. Duck can be difficult to do well, but it was very well done in this case. The burger was like a Big Mac on steroids. Same type of ingredients, only well done, instead of McD style. The burger patties were a little overcooked, but they had good flavor, so can't fault them too much. The fries weren't quite as hot as would have been ideal, but they were well seasoned and clearly home made. The service was excellent. Maybe it's because there were few tables, but we never went without water, and were left alone an appropriate amount. No complaints, and only compliments there. Everything was on the upper end of the price scale, it was good, but the prices are pushing the envelope. Overall an intimate, well cooked meal - someplace to go for a date, or a quiet dinner.

The bucatini sauce was very flavorful, but the noodles wasn't as al dente as I like them to be. The sauce really made up for it and thus it was an overall enjoyable dish. My friends said there was a lot of fat in the steak. A big let down for them especially because the price tag made you expect something amazing. The best thing we had was dessert. We shared the marscapone cheesecake. The texture was soft and silky. It melted in your mouth. Definitely the highlight of the whole night. I'm glad I got to try Nightwood.

Prices are unreasonable for a hit or miss experience. I have walked past this restaurant many times, because it's only 4 blocks from my house and I've avoided it due to mixed reviews regarding quality of service and food taste and price. However, my gf recommended it as a good place for brunch. So off I went. Some parts were good, some parts not so great. I sat at the bar to wait for my party to arrive before getting seated, and the bartender hardly acknowledged me...let alone barely talked to me. She was very personable to the guy next to me. She spent a good while telling him about her favorite food. When she finally took my drink order, she looked less than thrilled to even to assist me. I ordered the Americano drink, which  I cannot find on the online menu right now. I am all for trying new cocktails and learning about them, but this thing was badly bitter, and I like bitter stuff. It took a lot of diluting, lemon juice and swirling for it to grow on me. If any of you cocktail connoisseurs can educate me about that drink, please send me a message so I'm not so biased. Otherwise, I do not recommend that drink. And just before my party arrived, the bartender didn't say a word to me. She just gave me the bill in a glass and walked away. total: $8.85 for a bitter, crappy drink and crappy service. Ok, I admit I was dressed in yoga pants and a yoga hoodie; but really, shouldn't they treat us all the same? Do I need to tell you I'm dressed like that because I just ran 8 miles only an hour before i got to your snobby counter and my body is sore? Thank god I had cash and just begrudgingly threw in a $10 bill. I really should have just left her  $0.15 as a tip, considering how indifferent she was to me. I WILL be back to find her and remind her how she treated me. I do, after all walk past that place weekly from my nearby home to grab myself 2 delicious craft beers at skylark--for the same price as that drink. Upon getting seated, service was far better. The girl in the glasses was very, very attentive and pleasant. I ordered the bacon butterscotch donut, which is THE BEST donut in the world. I will go back to order that for takeout. Delicious, absolutely, positively delicious. If you've ever had the bacon long john from Glazed and Infused (and you know it's fab), this is even better. It is well worth the price. I also ordered the den-fjord: listed as a rye flour crepe Swedish meatballs smoked salmon, braised kale, glazed cippolinis (unreadable handwritten item), sunnyside egg. The dish looked absolutely scrumptious, but I'm really not sure what happened there. First, it was really salty; but to be fair, I don't like a lot of salt in my food in general. My friend likes her food salty so that just depends on your palate. However, the saltiness didn't really do much for the overall flavor. With all those ingredients, I expected more flavor. Flavor from the kale, maybe a tad more flavor from the salmon. I'm not sure. I wouldn't have minded paying the $14 for that dish if the overall taste was more than just meh.  To close out our meal, we caved and ordered bloody Marys...we really like our bloody Marys. So when they came in at a more than bitter taste, we were really disappointed. The garnish was really tasty, i believe it was a sliver of ginger (very good), but i don't remember what the second garnish was, it was salmon colored and crunch--that was it. I reiterate that service at the table was great, despite the crowd at 12p-ish. I'm all for giving places a second try but $20+ dollars for 2 bad drinks is outright insane. I will return for the donut as takeout but I really hope some of those folks, or that bartender chick treats all patrons better and the same across the board. After all, Pilsen is my home and I support my local businesses. I don't demand high services, but I do notice snobby service when I'm being a friendly customer and you do not reciprocate the gesture. I won't say I won't ever be back, but I will think twice next time.",0.9957,0.743,0.163,0.095,0.46801235140520847

He was competing in the Grand Cochon against culinary chefs like Naomi Pomeroy, Michelle Bernstein, and Mark Forgone. Quoting Chef Jason Vincent after winning the Grand Cochon, ""Naomi Pomeroy and Michelle f'ing Bernstein?"" Yeah, you beat them. I had no idea who Jason Vincent was and he was the featured chef representing Chicago! Though after eating his bacon butterscotch doughnut and his version of a Spanish style pork and vegetable stew cocido, I could still taste it today. Fast forward to a few, finally having dinner at Nightwood, Chef Jason Vincent still has the magic. Had a 5 course tasting menu created by the man himself. The crispy pig ears, foie gras apple salad, and split roasted duck were the favorites. Keep in mind though the menu does change daily. The service was by far Michelin Star quality. The room was dark yet intimate. Nightwood is definitely date worthy. I would go back and recommend this place.

2014-02-12,2.0,"Overpriced overhyped pretentious hipster service! To start, we shared the crispy pig ears which was more like candied pig ears: sweet and cold. It was fine, but a little too hard IMO. Pig ears already have a crunchiness to it, I really don't think you have to make it harder. To follow was the scramble eggs running yolk - which was blah. The brilliant presentation (the poached egg had a beautiful egg-white cover that made us wonder about the technique they used) did not make up for the lack of flavor and the disappointing portion. Ricotta cheese and egg yolk together just seem like a lot of fat for me, and this dish fell short.  As main entree, we had the trout and a shrimp pasta which was supposed to have kale. Both plates came out cold, even thought we both had hot entrees. The pasta was not fully cooked. Portion was disappointing for the price. I debated whether to send mine back but our server never came by to check on us. Dessert was fine - perhaps the best part of the meal (we had the apple bread pudding).  Service was horrible - our server, after taking our order and presenting our wine, went MIA for the rest of the night. The food runner (or perhaps another server) literally threw the dishes in front of our face and walked straight away without explaining anything. I didn't have a chance to catch her to tell her about the cold plate. When we asked her about some ingredients on the dessert, she had no clue and had to run back to the kitchen to check. I know it's not fine-dining by no mean but the items aren't cheap on the menu and if you're going to charge that much please educate your staff.

The restaurant is so inviting - cosy, dimly lit and exposed brick and an open kitchen. I could have stayed for hours had it not been a work night.  A nice thing about the restaurant week menu here is that it is a separate, special menu. The options were so delicious-sounding that it was hard to choose. Thankfully, there were 2 options from each of the four courses and 2 of us, so we each got to try the entire menu! First up, foie gras and pear. WOW! The beet salad was also good, but the pear was the best.  Second course - oyster chowder. Yep, you read that right and darn it was delicious! The corned beef also wonderful and I don't even like corned beef very much! I had an amazing lemon scented ricotta ravioli with bolognese sauce and got a few bites of pork loin as well. Both - wonderful though I think I preferred the ravioli as it was light and really unique.  Desserts - yum! Chocolate with the cutest caramel corn and an apple bread pudding. Both insanely good!

The oysters had just enough crunch, which played well off the texture of the remoulade.  We then had a dungeness crab salad and roasted carrots. It had a sharp flavor that worked well with the Burgundy. The next course was a ricotta ravioli and honey. I never thought these flavors would go well with a red wine, but the pairing was fantastic. The ravioli were cooked perfect.  The next course was a sturgeon. Again, we paired it with a red wine that perfectly complimented the dish. The mushroom accompanying the sturgeon made the red wine appropriate. It added body to an otherwise light dish. The main course was a flank steak accompanied by an apple chutney. The textures in the dish were amazing, balancing hard and soft. The ranch on the side gave it the right sharpness to pair with our Syrah.  The service was perfect, atmosphere perfect, food perfect.

The menu has so many fantastic choices, the decor is nice, the food is outstanding, and the service was satisfactory enough.  First off - wine: We ordered a bottle of the Old Soul Red from Mendocino, CA. The waitress didn't seem very knowledgable about the wine list,  so I think she defaulted on what she knew and recommended this one. It wasn't bad, but it was a bit too fruity. This was my only gripe - if she didn't know the wines, she should have asked someone who did to recommend one based on our description. But moving on to the food. For appetizers we ordered: + The Brussels Sprouts with Fermented Sablefish - not my favorite version of brussels sprouts, but extremely tasty nonetheless. I would order it again. + Fried squid with Cucumber, Yogurt, and Chili Arbol - I love calamari and I love spicy things, so this was a hit for me. The presentation was nice with the yogurt dip on the bottom of the dish. For entrees: + Lake Superior Walleye - Omg this was absolutely amazing. The onion and corn on the bottom was unbelievably delicious and the fish was perfection. Love Love Love this dish. + Spaghetti alla Rock Shrimp, etc - Homemade al dente spaghetti with shrimp, beans, and other good things. Totally unique and surprisingly well-composed. I would never have thought of putting beans in spaghetti, but it worked! And finally, for dessert: + Mexican Chocolate Cremeux - insanely rich, insanely good.  + Laura's Pumpkin Pie - I can't put into words how much I loved this dish. The chai ice cream was out of this world when paired with the pie. I'll be dreaming about this pie for a long time. I need to know how to make it!! Overall a very nice meal.

My drink was a bit heavy on the bitters. The service was excellent. We arrived for an 8:15 reservation and could not be seated until 9:00. The maitre'd kept us informed and apologized. We understood the difficulties, but they were nice enough to offer us a few WONDERFUL appetizers on the house.  Which brings me to the appetizers. These were the star of the dinner. They were each unique in taste, profile and presentation. The pig ears and the peppers were each great, but their menu changes daily. The server was very helpful and knowledgable about the dishes. As others have said, entrées were a little on the bland side. Not horrible, but not as daring as the appetizers. If I were here again, I'd order a main dish (or two) to split among the group, but go all out on the appetizers. The desserts were perfect. Nice wine and limited but decent beer list. Definitely a spot Chicagoans should check out.",0.9869,0.77,0.174,0.056,0.6042162698412699

When we got there, I was happy I made a reservation (even despite a 9pm one) because the place was packed. My initial impression was that the place has a nice ambience (although I prefer the indoors than outdoor patio).  The drinks and service was very good. I ordered the fish entree and it was good as well. Overall, the portion sizes are just right. If you end up going for the full experience with drinks to desserts, the bill will run up. Why not 5 stars? My only critique is that my entree (and I tried one of my friend's entree) was somewhat bland.

Started off on a disappointing note with the fried squid - over-fried, salty and too much breading and barely any squid. The only good part was the layer of cucumbers in yogurt under the squid.  Our entrees definitely made up for the appetizer miss. I had the wood-grilled trout - cooked perfectly, so many flavors and loved the addition of almonds. Husband had the farm chicken breast, almost as good - more of a sweet taste w/ plums. We had the pumpkin pie for dessert - not your average pie - with a scoop of ice cream (cinnamon?), brown sugar and apple pieces on the side...yum!

Husband had Monte Cristo type sandwich; this was fine from a serving size perspective, but overpowered by the maple syrup it was coated in to the point where he could only manage to eat half. He took it home to give the second half a chance; managed to finish another quarter of a sandwich there before finally tossing it. I had some kind of Asian-inspired rice/scrambled egg dish, which was fine, but nothing mind-blowing - it was better than something I could have put together myself, but not anywhere near the kind of consistently awesome flavor combinations you experience at the Publican, for example (the Publican continues to be my gold standard for what brunch *can* be like). My portion size was super small; about half a cup of egg/rice mixture. Thankfully there were enough toast and tater tots to round the dish out, but for $13 per plate, I expected more (as in, more food). I was also put off by the fact that the beef rib tips that were supposed to be a part of the meal basically consisted of two millimeter thick slivers of meat hidden amongst the eggs. Why bother naming it if it's not going to be a substantial component of the dish? We had the server recommended bacon/butterscotch donut, and I was underwhelmed. I love myself a good, fresh, gourmet donut (Dazed and Confused, DoRite, etc.); this one was just too one-dimensionally sweet, so hard to enjoy after more than one bite.

We were seated on the patio, which had a great ambience but unfortunately very uncomfortable chairs. Nice wine and cocktail menu to start off. We had heard great things about the burger, so decided to share that for our entree and get 3 starters as well. The crispy pig ear was pretty delicious (salty and sweet, a little sticky but nicely done), and we enjoyed the melon salad (although as my hubby pointed out, anyone could cut up a good melon and top it with queso fresco - the trick is getting a good melon, which Nightwood definitely did). We also had the warm tomato salad with a baguette and were underwhelmed. The tomatoes were nice, the baguette was average, but the sauce, which was described as a yogurt dill sauce, actually tasted more like a Thai peanut sauce, which I did not love. I'm not sure if others have had the same experience, or maybe the chef just made a mistake on our dish? The burger was very good, and super filling, so we were too full to try their dessert menu.

The grilled octopus appetizer was very good and flavorful, and came with beans and sausage slices.  The spaghetti entree that comes with a shrimp sauce and beans was odd but interesting, as I've never had a variety of beans as the sauce. The texture of the spaghetti was interesting as well--it was made square and a little tougher to the bite (think shriveled tofu), rather than the smooth usual bite you get. But, overall the cheapest item on the menu that was very tasty.  The flank steak was also very tasty, and came over a bed of watercress, which made me feel awkward. With such a beautifully done meat, it was odd to pair it with such a raw, peppery spicy kind of green.  Overall, the service was great; all of our entrees were delivered at the same time by multiple wait staff, and our silverware were cleared often and waters replenished.

The beers were craft beers so I'm not going to complain about the price.   The app was literally a plate of sliced cucumbers laid delicately on a plate drizzled with olive oil and topped with chopped peppers, radish, onions and jalapenos.  Worst salad EVER! We came here for the burgers as we have seen it listed on many Top Burgers in Chicago lists.   When we ordered the burgers with the server, we were not asked how we wanted them cooked, so I asked how they are prepared.  The server said they are usually cooked Medium.  I had a hunch this would be a mistake as I recalled reading on the menu that the burger consisted of two patties which usually meant 2 patties that equated to a burger somewhere in between a 1/4 lb. to 1/2 lb. burger. Knowing that the patties would be thin, it meant that the burgers would likely be over cooked especially at medium.  That was EXACTLY what we were served.  Overcooked patties, in between a focaccia type bun that did not help the burger.  The burger was under seasoned and the only redeeming feature of this burger was the onion ring that almost got lost with soaked bun.  Usually when you are paying $15 for a burger, you would expect better quality burger.   Outside of the food (that we ordered), this place appears to be a trendy restaurant as it was nearly packed (both outside seating and inside dining) on a Wednesday evening.  The server mentioned that the menu changes daily depending on what ingredients the kitchen wants to use.  The service was impeccable as everyone was friendly was the host to the people clearing our table.  I won't say I'm ruling this place out as it has great outdoor patio seating and the menu suggests that they use fresh ingredients.  I strongly recommend not trying the burger as you can definitely go somewhere else for a tastier burger with less damage to your wallet.",0.9658,0.846,0.106,0.048,0.5017241379310345

FOOD: The menu changes but you will not find fresher, more succulent, and original dishes anywhere. We recently had the cucumber dish and it was spicy and refreshing at the same time. The DESSERTS are A MUST. YOU MUST try them. They have a cherry pie with a coffee dessert that is sweet and hits the spot. There are also cookies galore for the cookie monster in you.

There's some chairs in the back if you want to watch the kitchen work it's magic. I'm sure theyyy luhhhhhhve that...

The pirate ship like atmosphere is what I tend to love about kitchens, hopefully they wouldn't hold back for fussy dining crowds. Who knows, maybe you could even get some innovative creations tossed your way from time to time.  Their cocktails compliment the fresh cuisine. Plenty of ingenuity with their wide array of spirits, liqueurs, and extras can be found in their well crafted drinks.  The food is about as fresh as your gonna get. Some dishes are raw and simple so you can get the best out of certain ingredients, while other entrees clearly have an expressive attention to detail and skill. It mus be great to be a local so you can come in here frequently and try the always changing menu. Although it must stink to have something you loved, gone the next week. BUT THAT'S HOW THEY GETCHA! Their dessert. ""GREAT SCOTT!"" They could open a small pastry or dessert shop based entirely on the expertise of sweets they got goin' on.

Everything about this donut was divine from the raspberry glaze and oat topping, and that greek yogurt custard, not overly sweet thanks to the Greek yogurt but sweet enough to be a bit indulgent. Perfection. I think almost every table had a donut brought over to it at some point, I don't think I've ever seen something quite like it at another restaurant.

The food is fantastic.  You'll fight to not request additional warm bread; the cocktails are quite good (the Pink Whippet and the Dark Star were two of the three I put to bed...sassy), the farfalle was tasty, and the Nightwood Cheeseburger is surprisingly good for a burger at a semi-fancy restaurant.  I tasted my wife's salmon entree and that was also very good...the outside was crispy, but not crunchy, just right.  Dessert was a minor misstep, as the descriptions for the Chocolate Bombe and the Soft Pretzel Bread Pudding were written better than they tasted.  Good, just not as amazing as ""dark chocolate, caramel vanilla bean, chocolate-covered pretzel ice cream"" sounds! The crowd got larger as 8 turned to 9 PM, so it got lively later, and when we left around 10:30 it was closing time.  I got the sense that this is a great place to take your parents and because the neighborhood has the look of ""transitioning"" (a popular term where I was back in DC), you'll get that jewel-in-the-nile feel when you walk back to your parked car two blocks away.  This is also reflected in the incredible mix of people inside; people of all races, faiths, ages and interests seem to eat at Nightwood, so it's got a decent people-watching quotient too.  Good stuff!",0.993,0.78,0.181,0.039,0.4746279761904762

The night we were there, spring lamb on lentils was on the menu as was flattened salmon. We paired this a pleasant Sauvignon Blanc at a very modest price.  In fact their wine list is comfortably approachable; not a whole bunch of listings with astronomical numbers which always makes me feel small and inadequate.  Portions are generous without being threatening to your waistline and it's worth checking the dessert menu, because more creativity abounds here.

I've never heard of a brunch place taking reservations. Well, except for Marion Street Cheese Market (and I adore them). I drove and found free street parking around the corner from the restaurant. The entrance is a bit strange. I'm not quite sure how to describe it. You go down a dark hallway. On the left it seems as if there might be something of an unused patio area. At the end of the hall is another door that goes into the bustling restaurant. It was about noon and it was really hopping! I couldn't be seated until Daniel arrived, but that was cool. Eventually I made my way to the bar. The bartender seemed really busy or something because it took him a while to acknowledge me and offer me a menu. I promptly ordered a Bloody Mary. It was served in a short glass and was pretty spicy. I felt as if the balance of Bloody Mary components assuredly tipped on the side of spice. I like spice, but I didn't like this Bloody Mary. We were seated at a two person table along the front window the moment Daniel arrived. It was comfortable and sunny. I found the atmosphere to be lively to distraction. Even though it wasn't insanely loud, I had a hard time focusing on our conversation. Daniel ordered both donuts right away. I tasted a bit of both of them and they were really delicious. The donuts were squishy (not cake donuts), glazed, and not overly sweet. I thought the custard filled one was entirely reminiscent of a bun from China Town. The bacon one was incredibly good. Both were phenomenal and the very best thing about Nightwood. They are not to be passed up! Daniel ordered the Nick Tahou Burrito. It was served with pasta on the inside and an egg on top. He liked it. I got the Fish cake and a side of bacon. The fish cake was like a hash brown where the potato shreds were mixed with fish pieces. Cooked kale was served on the side and there was a creamy tomato sauce on top of the fish cake. It was good. My bacon was served hard and burnt along the edges. It was good for dipping in my Bloody Mary but not for eating. The service really wasn't that great. I can't say that it was friendly. The host, bar tender, and server didn't smile or make any kind of small talk. They weren't rude, but they definitely could have been less utilitarian. The server had to be reminded about my bacon. The total of our brunch came to $60 ($69 if you include my Bloody Mary), which I think is overpriced for what we got.

It was truly spectacular, and served with a chorizo grilled cheese. J, who is never shy about proclaiming his dislike of gazpacho, actually enjoyed this one.  Brunch here has probably become my favorite in the city. Their donuts are SO light and airy, like a ring cloud of carbs, glazed in either bacon butterscotch, or whatever seasonal glaze/topping they put on the menu that week (subscribe to their newsletter - you'll be sent the Sunday brunch menus on Saturday, and will drool at every one of them. promise). The Bloody Mary is perfect and served with pickled brussel sprouts - what?! Even the gazpacho-hater liked it: ""It's very good for a Bloody Mary."" The bagel sandwich with smoked trout cream cheese is also highly recommended. As are their tater tots, that from far away look like falafel, but are freakin' awesome. Very unique.

The doughnut is done with a butterscotch glaze, piled high with bits of cubed fried bacony goodness and served with sugared doughnut holes. OMIGOSH. I died.  Nightwood is also serving the best tots in all of Chicago. You heard me right. THE BEST. I'm not normally a tot person. Up until this brunch, Hot Doug's held this title. Sorry Doug but Nightwood has you beat. I got three hefty perfectly golden balls of freshly grated tots. They are ridiculous. Accompanying my tots were a soft scramble of eggs with celeriac cream, anchovy, gruyere, parsley & truffle oil. It was cooked perfectly, wonderful smokiness. The homemade blueberry compote that arrived along side my toast was also delicious.  As if this wasn't enough, Nightwood cures their own bacon. Don't think twice about this. Get it. Fresh juice and Intelligentsia coffee rounded out this seemingly perfect  brunch. I cannot wait to return to Nightwood and might even check out the dinner menu if I can tear myself way from those tots.",0.9971,0.748,0.223,0.029,0.644779541446208

The menu changes a lot, so whatever I rave about is probably gone by now....suffice it to say that the dishes are inventive and complex, if you will, but also delicious. Sometimes high-concept food gets lost in the concept, but every bite of every dish I've had here has been memorable. If there is an app with foie, get it. I've had two different ones and both were stellar.  The prize-winning pork tastes as good as the name implies. The seafood entrees are also great -- I've had trout and scallops.  Save room for dessert -- I had blueberry pancake ice cream there once and I still think about it.

They were flavored with dill and trout, and they were awesome. Next, we got the rolled pasta with ricotta and pepperoni sauce. The sauce was really good, but this dish was probably our least favorite of the evening. We split the mushrooms with polenta and sturgeon for our entrees.

2013-01-20,5.0,"We visited Nightwood for a delicious Sunday Brunch... and you should too!  We walked in to the Pilsen farm-to-table restaurant for a late brunch and were shocked to find there wasn't a wait. We were immediately seated in the front room, which was beautifully lit from the sun shining in from large street-facing windows. Almost every table was full. The service was great; very friendly and happily recommended menu-favorites.  What we ordered: --Traditional Bloody Mary--  This is a bloody mary we look forward to ordering again! It was a great way to start off the meal; it accurately reflects the feel of the restaurant: fresh, quality ingredients. The tomato juice in the drink tasted as if it had just been juiced. We especially loved that it was garnished with pickled brussel sprouts. Very unique and something we haven't seen in Chicago before! Amazing and one of our new favorites.  --Rolled Omelet w Roasted Apples and Sunchokes, Smokey Blue Cheese, and Tarragon--  This omelet was light and packed with flavor. The egg was cooked perfectly, the blue cheese wasn't overpowering, and the roasted apples and sunchokes offered an unexpected twist to the dish. Wonderful omelet to try! --Bagel Sandwich Smoked Trout Cream Cheese, Slaw, Bacon, and Fried Egg Served Over Easy-- One of the (if not the...) best breakfast sandwiches in Chicago. Hands down. This sandwich blew us away. Each ingredient has a unique and vibrant flavor that it adds to the dish. It's important to get a little bit of everything into each bite. Served with amazing bite-sized crispy hashbrown balls that left us wanting more... This is a breakfast sandwich that will be on our minds for quite some time.  --Coffe Custard Donut w Chocolate Glaze-- A truly delicious, decadent donut. The coffee custard filling oozed out with every bite... leaving us wanting more.  In addition to Brunch, we strongly recommend visiting Nightwood for dinner! This was our second time dining at the Pilsen restaurant. On our first visit, we sat outside on their beautiful patio and enjoyed a delicious dinner, with many ingredients coming from the garden in the back of the restaurant.",0.997,0.773,0.199,0.028,0.6508407051885312

What I thought it was and what I got were two different worlds. The menu just had the name not a description of what you were getting. I did not complain as it looked like a White Russian and tasted like heaven. Had I known, I would have asked for a scoop of ice cream to go with it. Our table was at one of the huge windows in what is a quaint dining room. I started with the spinach salad and a glass of Lumos. Excellent wine, I should have gotten the bottle. The salad was amazing with its subdued flavors that would pop with flavor as you eating. The walleye came next with a glass of Lambet. Not too fond of that choice, but by that time I was very happy! The fish on the other hand was excellent. With a smear of mashed underfoot and the bean sauce on the side. I polished that plate in record time! The staff collects the plates, silverware and glasses between each course as well as wipe down the table. I went to the washroom and I saw the lineup of desserts and I had to try the espresso tart with Illinois figs. Now I have never had a fig in my life, because I didn't like they way they looked at me! But these were delicious and the tart was nice and light. I ate quite a bit and I went home feeling content, not bloated. The atmosphere was young and casual.

I went with a friend from the Netherlands.  We started off with an appetizer with a rolled piece of pasta stuffed with ricotta and on the outside some grilled chorizo or sausage and some heavenly sauce. For dinner, I got the duck which was perfectly cooked, crunchy on the outside and succulent on the inside, served over lentils. Don't ask me how the lentils were cooked, but the flavor was bountiful. My friend ordered the  rabbit and if I remember correctly, he almost licked the plate clean. For dessert, I got a small cake, that at first bite, resembled cornbread, but then evolved into a sweet bite.  A plop of pumpkin ice cream with candid walnuts topped this piece of genius. The other dessert was a molten chocolate cake topped with vanilla ice cream.  Needless to say, we couldn't help but devour every bite of our meals.

I ordered the spit-roasted half chicken, which looked impressive as it was carried to my table.  But to be honest, while it was moist, it was also very bland.  I liked the fingerling potatoes.  My wife had the scallops, and to be honest, she and our other friend who also got the scallops were not wowed.  My friend got the lamb chop and was not blown away. The almond butter cake was excellent, we all fought over it.  The bittersweet chocolate cake was well received and had it not competed with the almond cake it would have been even more popular. I will say that we four tend to like spicy interesting food, and the somewhat bland flavorings of the entrees were a little underwhelming.  But don't go by just my review I would read a number of them.  Ironically I had just eaten somewhere else a week ago and though the food was overly seasoned.  There's just no pleasing some folks.",0.9948,0.725,0.242,0.033,0.7560897435897433

For our entree I got the rabbit and corn flautas and the hubby got a burger. The portion sizes were definately on the smaller end and like I mentioned at the beginning of my review, they were just OK. Nothing spectacular, just as promised. The one complaint that my boyfriend had was that the choice of the bun for his burger seemed a little tough and everytime he took a bite, the bun would push the burger out and he's end up with a mouthful of bun, and a burger hanging over the side of his remaining bun. As for the service, again, it was just OK. Noone stepping on our toes, just a straight forward ""What will you have?""  Would I go back?

This breakfast sandwich was delicious, but could be made better with a better grade bagel. Now, the bagel wasn't BAD, it just wasn't top notch.

The decor and ambiance were also very pleasant.  Appetizer was a combination of lightly sauteed cauliflower, nectarines, sorrel and stracchion cheese (from Italy) on top of a big slice of Wisconsin bacon. The dish was a delightful little summer affair. For entree I ordered the spit roasted Illinois rabbit. The meat was succulent with a faint woody note, not at all gamey as rabbit sometimes can be. The sauce was a savory broth made of finely diced bacon bits, fennel, porcini and whole shishito peppers.  My dinner mate had the strip steak cooked to medium well. I was really concern about that when he ordered but when I tried the steak it was perfection. To be able to get a steak to such tenderness at medium well is nothing short of a true testament to the chef's culinary skill! For dessert I picked blueberry crisp with strawberry ice cream which completely blew me away. I could even venture to say that it was the best dessert I've ever had. The strawberry ice cream was packed with flavor. The blueberry crisp was almost good enough to die for with fresh whole blue berries at the bottom.

I moved to Pilsen from Wicker Park a few months ago, and I miss all of those elegant, fine dining establishments that seem to be on every corner in the 60622. I never knew a place as nice as Nightwood could exist in Pilsen, for obvious reasons. However, I was proved wrong when I ate here a few days ago on my birthday. Nightwood is nestled right on Halsted, a little north of Skylark and Cermak Rd. My boyfriend and I were greeted by a warm, inviting host when we walked in. The decor is contemporary, and the kitchen/food prep area is completely visible to guests. Our server was very knowledgable about Nightwood's cuisine, stating how its always fresh and only bought from local farming vendors. I ordered the roasted half chicken, which came with some kind of mint infused quinoa side which was orgasmic! The chicken tasted so fresh and was so tender, it melted in my mouth. My dish was also reasonably portioned; it was not small and scant like some fine dining restaurants are with their food. I felt full after I finished my plate, and that is pretty important to me.  My boyfriend hinted that it was my birthday while I was in the bathroom, and our server brought us some delectable pastries for dessert....which were complimentary I might add.  The only drawback I can say about Nightwood is the price of the cuisine. For a Pilsen restaurant, its pretty expensive. My plate was $25, but worth it. The menu changes daily, and I would say on average a person can expect to pay between $20-$35 per plate, excluding drinks. However, I understand why the dishes are on the expensive side. Nightwood goes to great lengths to ensure that the food is fresh and organic. In my opinion, this restaurant is worth the extra money.",0.985,0.843,0.141,0.015,0.5455865272938444

I must admit that I was extremely worried about my parents being able to find things on the small ever-changing menu that would appeal to them. My dad is allergic to most fish and my mom is mostly vegetarian (actually, she doesn't really eat much at all, but that's besides the point).  I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful combinations of flavors and textures in the food at Nightwood. I shared the eggplant, summer squash, breadcrumbs, aioli, capers, and lemon oil app, and it was quite possibly one of the best appetizers I have ever had. Creamy, flavorful, rich, and just the perfect portion for sharing. Loved it. We also split the crispy pig ear at the table, which, after becoming obsessed with the pig ear dish at the Purple Pig, I was skeptical. Also very good, though. My entree was the spaghetti alla chitarra with five animal bolognese. To be honest, I think I was just intrigued by the idea of eating five animals in one dish. The dish was delicious. Just salty enough, just savory enough, perfect portion. Even my picky dad tried it and wished he had ordered it.  My husband loved his NY Strip with the non-vegetable ratatouille. I like that the ratatouille was advertised by the server as having only meats in it, so that it wouldn't deter vegetable skeptics like my husband. My mom said she liked her spit-roasted Slagel farm half chicken with plums and quinoa, but she only ate about one bite, so who knows. Dad enjoyed his trout but, as expected, didn't like the accompaniment because it was too spicy. The shock came when my simple-meat-and-potatoes-loving-brother ordered the rabbit and loved it, despite his difficulties with figuring out how to get the meat off the bones (he's 21, which means his palate is fond of cheeseburgers, steak, burritos, and Natty Lite, so what did I expect?). Desserts included the blueberry crisp and peach bread pudding with ice cream and they were both some of the best desserts I have ever had, and I am a major dessert person.

Overall, I couldn't have been happier with our meal...except for that walleye, if only it was a bit cheaper!",0.986,0.814,0.157,0.028,0.6060386473429952

That said, the spin on modern comfort food here is nicely seasoned and smartly blended between the sweet and the savory.  The three of us were all happy with our meals, if the portions were a tad small for the prices.  An early-ish (1015a)  brunch should still leave you satisfied enough to make it through to dinner--not ready for a real lunch just two hours later.  However, the meal was good enough that I would have been willing to give it a go at Nightwood again at 12:30p, if my credit card weren't still so sore!",0.9869,0.747,0.206,0.047,0.5630476190476191

2012-06-01,3.0,"I went to Nightwood for brunch with friends after hearing about it for months. We made reservations, and when we arrived there we let the hostess know we were there. She said it would be a few minutes. So we waited outside (there was really no other place to wait), and waited... and waited... Had she forgotten about us? We had no clue, so we went back in and the woman said ""Oh! Your table is ready!"" as if we were supposed to guess that. Uh, okay. So we sit down, and one of my friends tries to order chai tea. They're out of almost all of their teas, and chai tea isn't on the menu. However, a chai latte is on the menu. So my friend asks if they have chai tea - he specifies TEA, not a latte - our waitress thinks about it for a moment and tells us she can make something like that. Great. A few minutes later she comes out with a cup full of warm chai concentrate and water. Um, what?! That is NOT chai tea. There are also no free refills on this weird chai concoction, which is problematic for my friend who drinks five cups of tea with most meals. So my friend lets the waitress know that he asked for chai tea, and that's not what he received. The waitress looks at us for a minute as if my friend had made a mistake in ordering his drink and was now inconveniencing her with trivialities. Yeah no. That's not how that works. After a few seconds of looking like she's trying to hide the fact that she hates us, the waitress takes the drink back to the kitchen. Not off to a good start. We ordered the doughnuts as an appetizer, which were absolutely delicious (the strawberry/custard ones). Our meals came a little while later, and the food was alright. Good, even, if a little boring. Maybe that's my fault for not ordering some weird meat I've never heard of. Oh well, I can settle for good food. At least the hash brown balls were awesome (yes, they come in little fried balls). So we get our check and head out. Definitely a bit pricey for such small portions, but it's local/free-range/organic/award winning... I get it.

We decided to be seated outside on the covered patio. I would recommend dining outside to those who would like the fresh air minus the direct sunlight exposure.  DRINKS: We ordered about four drinks, each of them very unique and what I'd call ""grown up drinks''. They were good, complex, and stiff with just enough flavor to make them smooth palatable-certainly worth the the twelve bucks. We also had their Moscato Diasti, which was delicious! Even for myself, one who isn't a huge fan of sweet white wine. FOOD: I ordered the lamb and my partner ordered the pasta. We also had the smelt for as an appetizer. There's no doubt the food quality was impeccable. Don't let the small portions deter you. Although, I'm a fan of large dishes, I'm also aware that when food is of high quality and richness, it doesn't take as much to to feel satiated. The smelt was our favorite dish of all. It's breaded, lightly salted and had very little oil. The lamb was served with polenta. Although it was supposed to have squid, there was only one small piece in the whole plate. I enjoyed the texture of the meat, however the flavor wasn't for me. It reminded me of salty bbq. I enjoy salty sweet flavors, but not with my lamb. I tried the pasta with ricotta cheese and again they seemed have gotten carried away with the salt a bit. It' didn't really taste like like a pasta dish to me. Again, the quality, service and ambiance  was super. I think those who are huge fans of traditional ultra gourmet style American cuisine will appreciate this place.

With the steady stream of beer, fresh squeezed juices, and elaborate mixed drinks finally letting up long enough for the bar staff to catch their breath I was greeted perhaps five minutes after sitting down and explaining that I just wanted two doughnuts to go the bartender almost looked relieved that I didn't want anything to drink and telling me it would be ""about ten minutes - it has been crazy busy this morning"" he offered me a coffee while I waited - an offer I accepted but was not charged for and a very nice gesture considering the quality of the brew, a smooth locally roasted Ethiopian Yirgacheffe - a nicety very much unexpected given the attitude of service at sister restaurant Lula Café. With donuts in hand and bill paid after one cup of coffee and fifteen minutes at the bar I emerged from Nightwood into the sunny Chicago weather and opting to indulge while the donuts were still warm I started with the $4 Bacon Butterscotch option, a choice I'd heard much about and all things being equal a good option with a nice yeasty rise and ample coating with sweet butterscotch plus smoky bacon but in my opinion a bit too oily - a problem not suffered by the delicious cinnamon sugar doughnut holes included with the order. Moving next to an even more pricey option, the $5 seasonal ""Shamrock shake"" option, my fourth St. Patrick's Day Special of the trip and the most pricey doughnut I've ever purchased; in a word it was awesome and in two words, really awesome.  Appearing first to be a round yeast donut with copious frosting closer inspection actually revealed it to be a filled doughnut, the interior a light Bailey's and Peppermint cream, while the topping was actually an amalgam of melted dark Ghirardelli chocolate and Andes mints.  Served warm and with a trio of doughnut holes I'd be hard pressed to decide if it was better or worse than the holiday special at Doughnut Vault as they were quite different, but in my opinion in trumped the one at Do-Rite though admittedly at twice the cost and certainly makes me curious as to how the rest of the brunch menu stacks up; something that will require investigation on a later date at an earlier time.",0.9977,0.798,0.169,0.033,0.5101700502562573

2012-04-08,4.0,"I live in Ravenswood. It is a complete and utter pain in the ass to get from Ravenswood to Pilsen via public transportation. You have to take the brown line to the red line to the orange line and THEN, if you're going to Nightwood, you have to double back and walk north for however many blocks and pass a bunch of what look like abandoned factories so you walk with your keys in your hand just in case you need to stab someone. But your end goal in all this is Nightwood, which is an amazing personal reward for not being murdered for walking on Cermack or whatever murder-filled street it is at night. And in the event that you bring a friend with you, you get to try twice as much as you normally would, unless you're the sort of person who eats like, 4 plates of food at every meal and then I'm going to wonder about your metabolism and why you don't have a reality or whatever. Anyhow. In the event that you bring a friend, here's what you should order: -- The agnolotti with the GODDAMNED FOIE GRAS INSIDE. I cannot stress this enough. You should order at least one plate of this for every two people that go to Nightwood, in order to minimize sharing because you will not want to share because it's pasta with GODDAMNED FOIE GRAS IN IT. And you will bite into it and your eyes will become as giant and wide as saucers and you will shovel the remaining pasta into your face with the kind of reckless abandon usually reserved for afternoon quickies before the kids get home from school. -- The sturgeon with the lemon and the creme freche and the BACON BRAISED POTATOES. Don't get me wrong here, the sturgeon is the star of the show and there is nothing better than a big steaky fish that doesn't smell or taste ""fishy"". But oh lord, I want everything to be braised in bacon after having those potatoes. -- The half chicken with black beans, pickled onions, white sauce, and CORNBREAD CROUTONS. Don't judge me for getting this solely because of the fucking croutons, okay? Because that's pretty much 100% of the reason why I got it. And to Nightwood's credit, chicken is a really easy dish to fuck up or overdo or make boring or lame or whatever - and this was some GOOD chicken. Perfectly seasoned, super moist, and all the flavors went together perfectly, provided you got a magic cornbread crouton in your grill piece.

The table split one of the Bacon Butterscotch doughnuts and one of the Raspberry Jelly doughnuts with Chocolate Glaze and Candied Coco Nibs.  While the doughnuts  tasted decent, they are not worth the menu prices of $4 and $5 respectively.  Hell, the Bacon Butterscotch doughnut is simply a regular doughnut covered in butterscotch sauce and pieces of bacon--no infusion, twist, or anything that seemed particularly innovative. The Duck Confit and Pig Skin Stew with Scrambled Eggs and Tortilla Chips was substantially better.  An odd combination to be sure, but the duck and pig skin make for an extremely hearty pairing.  The rest of the plate is practically an afterthought (or perhaps a last-minute attempt to characterize this as a brunch dish), but the eggs and salsa were pretty good while the tortilla chips (think more along the lines of what you'd get in a tortilla soup at Houlihan's) were probably unnecessary. Overall, I was pretty pleased with Nightwood, and the restaurant should get extra credit for changing the menu frequently to keep things fresh and keep the diners on their toes.  Of brunch spots I've visited in Chicago, though, Nightwood falls behind The Gage and Jam (at least at the old location).",0.973,0.811,0.133,0.057,0.5666390956713535

Went here for the CRW 2012 dinner and essentially tried every dish on the menu (was with 2 other people so we just shared things)--most of their dishes appear on their regular menu as well:  -Spinach salad with buttermilk dressing, artichokes, pecans and fried onions--I thought it was too much dressing and cheese, making it a bit on the heavy side -Crostini--I thought they put too much gorgonzola to the point of overpowering the garlicky bread (which was great) -Foie agnolotti--delicious but the foie was a bit on the salty side, I would've preferred that it would've been either less salty or balanced off with more of the balsamic reduction sauce -Soft-scrambled egg with Michigan char roe--pretty creamy and delicious with the toast, but if this is supposedly a similar value to the foie risotto, it may be a bit of a ripoff -Spit roasted pork loin with farro, capers, onion rings, sugar--I was expecting something a bit more substantial than thin slices of pork with some farro, but it was cooked well, smoky, and had lots of ""delicious fat"" as stated on the menu -Chicken with a side salad and radish--reminded me of a mashup of sweet-and-sour chicken and barbeque (it was slightly spicy); the chicken didn't seem to have much meat on it, and the sauce just reminded me of eating spicy sweet and sour dishes (ie in Chinese cuisine) -Semifreddo with brownie chunks--deliciously like eating clouds of light but oh-so-creamy ice cream; I wish the brownie chunks were chewy instead of hard though  -Sourdough bread pudding with toffee and salted caramel--probably the best bread pudding I've had so far because it was not cloyingly sweet nor too heavy or soggy Overall: food was not bad--just in some cases overseasoned; given portion size and the regular prices (30+ for the entrees), I don't think I would go here...it's a little bit overrated for my taste.",0.9949,0.842,0.148,0.01,0.4843956043956043

The chicken was flavored well but really was nothing to write home about and the portion was also severely lacking.

2012-02-18,2.0,"It is the first day of Restaurant week and my boyfriend and I decided to try Nightwood in Pilsen.  I have driven by some many times that I needed to see what it was all about and it had some nice write ups in Time Out magazine.  We got there on time for our reservation and the place was packed.   Once we were seated, I immediately read the prix fixe menu for restaurant week and there were NO  vegetarian options!  You had a choice of chicken or pork as your main course.  I was so shocked and disappointed that it immediately colored my opinion of the restaurant. It touts that it is local, organic and sustainable.  Usually that also means Vegetarian friendly.  So I was not able to participate in the ""restaurant week experience"" and my boyfriend was able to enjoy a 4 course $44 menu.  So I reluctantly went to their usual menu and choose the fried Meyer lemon and Mizuna salad ($9) and Pumpkin ravioli  ($14) as my main course.  The only other vegetarian option was Hominy, Chickpea and beet creation for $16.  It did not sound appetizing.  I received the salad and it had 5 fried thin lemon slices and a small (I mean tiny -would fit in a table spoon) heap of Mizuna greens.  It was tasty and who knew fried meyer lemon was yummy, but it was so small that I finished in 3 bites.  My boyfriend's first course of lemon cheese bread with mixed greens was HUGE compared to serving and just as tasty.  So I of course had salad envy. He got his second course of fish roe /egg mix on toast.   I was not a fan but the meat eating boyfriend liked it.   Then the mains came.  Surprisingly the pasta was very good and the presentation was very modern, but again it was tiny in portion.  I had 3 average size ravioli on my plate with a smear of sauce on the side.   I really wish they would increase the portion of what little vegetarian friendly food they have.  My boyfriend got a nice size piece of chicken with turnips.  We finished the night with dessert and finally that is when everything felt right.  He had bread pudding, which was great and I had a trio of ice cream (red velvet, vanilla and blood orange sorbet).  We had a spoon war over the ice cream.  So in conclusion, the meal was ""ok"" but still teetering on ""lack luster"" for the experience and price ($128 with tax and tip).  I do not think I will be revisiting Nightwood for any future meals until they become more veggie friendly. PS: Nightwood, we veggie folks like gourmand experiences as well; and if Joel Robuchon can provide a stellar vegetarian experience, so can you!

The Women Who Bike showed up about 25 strong and the servers and kitchen handled it reasonably well, breaking us up into smaller groups for ordering and keeping the water and coffee refilled regularly.  I tried the two eggs, hashbrowns and toast with a side of veggie sausage. It was a LOT of food for one small person. The eggs and toast were standard (not sure how you can improve, though props for getting the eggs a nice 'n' runny over easy). Loved the veggie sausage and couldn't come close to finishing the three big slabs. The real knockout were the hashbrowns. They came in the form of three large tatertots, but, like, the BEST tatertots you've ever had. Crispy outside, mashed potato inside. Perfection. I am dying to know how they make these.  My chai was also good, but nothing super special. Wish they had the option of soy milk and a little surprised they didn't, given the aesthetic.  [Bad vegetarian aside: So I may have taken a nibble of the bacon donut. Holy wow. Super rich and yummy. Props to anyone who can tackle a whole one because I hit a sugar wall after one bite.] The only issue came up when I tried to pay early and leave. The server was more than happy to accommodate, but then added someone else's egg sandwich to my bill instead of the side of veggie saus. I didn't really have the time or inclination to ask her to fix it (and run the risk of looking like more than a pill than I already did with the leaving early business), so it was kind of a bummer but in the grand scheme it's no big deal.

I love the extremely creative menu.  Ingredients were first rate and the food was superb.  Nearly every meal at our table looked and smelled like something I'd thoroughly enjoy.  The tea was of excellent quality and served in a teapot, however there was no way to remove the tea leaves from the water so it steeped too long and got bitter.  A system that allows the customer to lift the tea leaves out of the water after the proper steeping time would improve the experience and do justice to the quality of the tea they serve. The decor was visually interesting.  Employees were friendly and professional.  Except for the noise level, this place would be nearly perfect.  There were no sound-absorbing surfaces, so it was not conversation friendly.  I could barely hear the person across the table from me.  It was difficult to have a conversation with anyone who wasn't right next to me.  Others in my party also found this extremely frustrating. I enjoyed the food enough that I would go back again, but only at an off-peak time (or on the patio in summer) so that I could actually enjoy conversation with my meal.  I hope that the management will consider adding some sound absorbing surfaces, such as textile art.  I would not return for brunch unless there is some improvement on the noise issue.  I look forward to tasting their superb food again on a future visit.",0.9972,0.717,0.236,0.048,0.5493347338935574

From what I heard it is owned by the same friendly people that own Lula's in Logan Square.  While the restaurant itself was warm and inviting, the staff inside was anything but.  My husband and I met up with 2 of our friends at the restaurant and were unfortunately disappointed.  It pretty much began when the waitress asked me if I wanted the ""organic vodka"" and couldn't explain what organic vodka was, when we legitimately didn't understand the idea of organic vodka. Then a ""totally alternative"" server kept hounding us with whether or not we preferred ""still"" or ""sparkling"" water... to the point where it actually broke up the flow of our conversation.  We get it, you're hip, and fancy...but we'll still take the ""still"" water please. Our server had a MAJOR attitude problem, and when the bill of over 200 dollars came, she didn't even bother to stick around to say goodnight and bring our cards back.  Then when we had a problem with the bill, we were forced to ask the hostess a question as our server was completely MIA, she was also BEYOND rude. I have to say with all the competition in this city, sometimes people don't realize if your food is just average maybe you should try to cover it up with at least having warm and friendly staff.

2011-10-21,3.0,"I have visited Nightwood for dinner 3 times now and I have to say each time I walk away with the same feeling. Last night my friend and I shared the Polenta appetizer with Parmesan and it was very good. However, I think another layer of flavor would have been nice. It said it had spicy peppers in it but I was not tasting the pepper or the spice, in fact I was reaching for the table pepper to add it in.  My main dish was the buttermilk fried scallops which were excellent. They had a very different deep fried outside crust and sat on a bed of beans and sauce. The sauce consistency was a little watered down and again lacking some flavor but overall a strong dish.  My friend had the Spaghetti alla chitarra, broccoli raab and we both felt that it was extremely salty. It was also very oily and not in a good way were it makes a nice sauce, it was in a greasy way where it hurts your stomach and tastes like your eating only oil. It's the kind of dish where you take one bight and you're like Mmmm but then after the 2nd and the 3rd you're like Hmm... Overall, Nightwood is a cool environment where you can get creative food that needs some tweaking with seasoning and execution.",0.992,0.783,0.2,0.017,0.5211342592592593

After several friends and neighbors raved, we tried this place for dinner. it had charm and ambience and all that, but snobby food snob from NY I may be, the food just wasn't that great.  We had a hard time choosing because nothing really jumped off the menu. The stand-out in the end, by far, was the fried meyer lemon and pickle appetizer. Really yummy, creative and beautiful. My husband was surprised - he thought I was ordering it to satisfy my weird pregnancy penchant for sour stuff, but he loved it too. We also had the burrata with lamb debri, which was ok but not actually delicious. The quality of the burrata was not top notch, I've had way better. The biscuits are tasty though, perfect biscuit-y texture. I ordered the duck. It had good smoky/sweet flavor, but the meat was just tough. It's often risky to order duck for that reason, but I went for it anyway. The duck itself was under-seasoned, but the veggies it came with were way over-seasoned. The lima beans were good, but they threw the chard in raw which didn't really work. Husband had the skirt steak with black beans. Again unevenly seasoned, but the steak was better cooked than the duck. We shared the apple crisp for dessert. The crisp itself was rich and better than the entrees, but the salted caramel ice cream was really really really salty. I think there was an extra sprinkling of fleur de sel on top of the whole thing, which was total overkill. I guess the main problem overall with this meal was inconsistent seasoning.  Service was friendly but spotty at times, like at one point one guy took away my clean utensils, then someone else served my food and I had no mis en place and had to ask. I had half a glass of sparkling water and the waiter filled it back up with still water without asking. Stuff like that, probably poor communication between the front and back servers. We just didn't love the food enough to want to come back, we thought maybe we should have tried their homemade pasta dishes but I make my own homemade pasta often so we rarely order it out.

Any seafood dish I've had has been excellent.  I wish they would sell me the biscuits they give you to start the meal, but if you ask politely I have gotten a few extra to take home.  The fried chicken is amazing too.  All in all this is a great place and I would highly recommend it!

I was in the hood for Second Fridays where I was able to experience some truly fantastic art exhibits finishing off the evening with a fabulous meal here.  The ambiance is so inviting yet chique at the same time. The lighting is dim and romantic but also suitable for a group.  We were a party of five this evening and were promptly seated and poured water (choice of sparkling or still). It took awhile for the waitress to get to us, but we didn't mind as we were enjoying our conversation. When she did arrive, she was incredibly knowledgeable and was patient when we played 20 questions with her on the menu (we were really just curious about a lot of the food - she didn't miss a beat with her descriptions).  The food was simply delicious. I was able to try the spicy jalepeno popper, the heirloom tomato, the spaghetti and the duck.  Everything tasted BETTER than it sounded on the menu (which is how it should be if you ask me). The stand out, knock out punch of the night was the duck by a long shot. It may have been the best duck I have ever set my lips on. Brown sugar glaze, moist meat, crisp skin - I ate myself into a coma.  I should have stopped there, but no, I needed dessert...and caffeine. So, I ordered a cappacino and the dark chocolate pudding with roasted marshmallow and graham crackers. The cappacino was nice and foamy but not quite as hot as I like (consider asking for it extra hot if you go that route). And the smores type dessert was tasty, but entirely too rich and sugary for my taste. I only made it three bites in before throwing in the towel.  Overall, this was just a fantastic evening. The only reason I did not give five stars is because the service was noticeably slow at key times throughout the meal.  I will be back here soon for a second try and see if it was an anomoly or just par for the course.",0.9954,0.825,0.161,0.014,0.5747619047619047

For entrees, we had a veal pasta with ravioli which was fantastic.  Lemony ricotta filling and succulent veal, all around great.  We also ordered the tuna spaghetti.  I wanted to try it, but the person that ordered it loved it so much, he refused to share!  We also had a whole roasted fish at the table.   Only complaint with that was there were a few pin bones, which made the eater a little nervous.  The last in our crew ordered the cheeseburger (which we didn't understand being at a place with such great food!), but she said it was one of the best she'd had in a while, so mission accomplished. We finished the night with a plate of cookies, some cinnamon and vanilla ice creams, and blueberry cake.  While the rest of the food was great, the desserts were easily the best part of the night.   And I can't go without mentioning the coffee.  I usually base my return to a restaurant based on their coffee and Nightwood doesn't miss.  It was clearly fresh, smooth, and had great balance.  I had to peek at the bar to check what they were using and of course, the bartender told me it was a blend, specially made for them!  It just means I'll have to come in for the coffee more often.   Have heard great things about brunch, so that may be my next trip in...",0.9983,0.734,0.236,0.03,0.5448621553884712

The room is beautiful and the patio looks amazing.   My date and I randomly walked in with out a reservation on a Tuesday night.  We were in the neighborhood and had heard good things about the place. The host asked if we had a reservation and acted like it was a slight imposition for her that we didn't have one.   My first cocktail was the Tamarand Rickey with rum.  I found it to be overly sweet and lacking in Tamarand flavor.   After we ordered, biscuits and honey butter were brought to the table.  The biscuits were not good- too tough and definitely made by a Yankee- you would be thrown out of the restaurant for serving those in the south.    I started my meal with the fried Myer lemons- interesting and I am glad I tried them, but I found them to be a bit greasy and heavy.I did not like the sauce they were served with- it was basically mayo smeared artistically on the plate.  For an entree I had the Wood roasted beef brisket which had its moments, but overall was dry and lacking in flavor.   My date had the wood grilled Wisconsin trout with roast potatoes and ripe melon with prosciutto ham.  The trout was large, well cooked and had a great smokey flavor.  My date found the potatoes to be undercooked and salty- I agreed, but it did not bother me that much- mostly because the fish was so good.  The Ripe melon and prosciutto was interesting, but underwhelming and I did not care for the texture or flavor of the melon.  I would consider getting this dish in the unlikely event that I find myself at Nightwood again.   I was to disappointed with my meal and drinks to order dessert, so we headed down the block to Skylark where we had a couple of great beers, played pinball, tipped well and left with a smile.",0.9897,0.8,0.159,0.04,0.5189928845101258

Dessert had to wait until next time, although MANY fantastic looking pastries were delivered to tables all around us.   It was a bit loud and the service - although good - was pretty affected.  It also seemed that horn-rimmed glasses (think Buddy Holly or Elvis Costello) are part of the mandatory uniform for both guests and waitstaff alike.

We made reservations for an early dinner at 5:30 on a Saturday night because we had tix for a show after. We didn't need the rezzies but ya never know. We were seated outside on the patio which is very cozy, loved it! Let me get the negative out of the way. Our waitress. She was aloof as aloof can be. She was sort of unwelcoming and it was hard to flag her down sometimes which I find annoying when I'm paying high prices. I don't mind paying high prices but if I do I have expectations of the service. Maybe this was just an off night for her. My hubby is not as much of a foodie as I am but he loved his spit fired chix. I tried it and it did have a fantastic smokey flavor, I have never tasted chicken quite like that.  I had the salmon and it was good but I was wishing for hubbys chicken instead. Oh and I loved the pea tendrils.. who knew I'd love pea tendrils? I know there are some comments about the portions being too small here. What we ordered, we did not find that to be true. I felt the portions were just right.  We opted out of dessert partly because I was ready to get away from our waitress. We went to Taylor street for italian ice instead. YUM! I would go back.

I had a ""bowl"" of pasta (spaghetti), well for $16 IIRC there was not enough spaghetti to fill a large teacup...friends has a half chicken dish the came out undercooked and leaking pink juice, after sending it back for more ""fire"" it was still inedible, seems to me that for what we spent, the wine was good, this was an absolute DISASTER...UGH.",0.6775,0.863,0.096,0.041,0.568452380952381
2011-07-19,4.0,"Both times I've dined at Nightwood were this past May (first with a friend and then again with an uncle visiting from out of town), and both times, we chose to dine in the back space with bar-like seating, overlooking the open kitchen.  This area felt somewhat secluded from the crowd in the main room and turned out to be a pretty cool location for dining--sometimes, it's satisfying to be able to see what goes into preparing your food.  The chefs were friendly, seemed to want our feedback, and would even chat with us briefly when they were able to do so.   Overall, the food I ordered was of good quality and solidly prepared and presented, but not quite to die for (except for what I heard about the spit-roasted duck); both times, the ambiance and service were excellent and on par with what one would expect from a hip, buzzworthy restaurant like this.  Quality, local organic Midwestern American ingredients seemed to form the basis of the menu (I learned what a ramp was here), yet to me, the fare had enough of a fresh, unique twist to it to make it interesting.   For example, my first time there, my entree was a nicely prepared wood-grilled fish (either lake bass or trout, can't remember).  But what what WAS memorable to me about it, and what I enjoyed, was that it was served whole, complete with head, Asian style.  Meanwhile my companion had the aforementioned spit-roasted duck and raved that it was among the best he's ever had.  I had just had my birthday and got some nice, complimentary cookies for dessert as well. My second time at Nightwood, I started out with a refreshing goat cheese salad and ended up ordering the ""Illinois pork belly.""  Also a unique offering from a so-called American restaurant.  It was new to me, at least.  As I was watching it being prepared, it looked an awful lot like a slab of bacon (after all, that's where bacon comes from), but at the end it had a smooth, lean taste and nice tenderness.  Who would have thought? (I hardly ever eat pork, except for bacon).  Pretty big portion, too.  And bonus to the waitress with great ears who overheard us talking about my birthday, and gave me yet another dessert plate of cookies--I felt guilty getting treats from them twice for my birthday.   Food, plus the wine, may have been overpriced, but considering the quality of what I had relative to other, similar places where I've dined, I can't say Nightwood was at all egregiously overpriced.  I'd go back there again.",0.9975,0.804,0.18,0.016,0.5000874125874126

First and foremost, the specialty cocktails.  We both ordered the Paris Wife, a fantastic combination of Mt. Gay Rum, amoro, lime, egg white and bitters. At $12 its not cheap, but it packs a punch with flavor and more.  With dinner, craft beer favorites and a few rarities are offered as well.  As far as the meal, we decided to split two appetizers and move on from there. Spicy fish broth with salmon, cilantro, avocado and mini carrots was surprisingly easy to share and appropriate for a summer night.  The bread with garlic and sea salt butter is another can't miss.  For my entree I ordered the hangar steak, cooked medium per the chef's suggestion.  Great crust with a soft inside worked well. The real stars of this meal were the fired egg and the farro. Not sure I've ever had ""farro"" before, but whatever it is, I support it 100%. My fiance had the half chicken which was seasoned well and cooked well to keep it juicy.

Probably one of the better soft shell crabs that I've had. Nothing fancy, just a good quality crab done right.  We had two appetizer sized pastas, the trofie which was delicious and the cavatelli with duck heart. I liked both. I think they really do their pastas well here.

It was good.)  -the veal (the ""soup"" had an interesting blend of spices, and the veal itself was a little bland) -the radish appetizer.....omg. WHAT WAS THAT? It was literally plain radish. -the soft shell crab appetizer (this was good, too. The sauce was a little thick and heavy) -OH. The biscuits and honey butter was AMAZING, however. Get full off those if you can! 2. The portions were TINY. Now I realize that a lot of snazzy restaurants love to leave you starving at the end of the meal....and this is no exception. I was mildly satisfied with my dish, but the guys with us (who got the steak) were not even close to full. 3. With that said, this place was WAY expensive. The steak was $26, the veal $24, the radish $6, and the crab $12. With everything that we ordered and split evenly, it was $38 a person!! (The total check was $235 O_o) To not be full...that's a lot to me. 4. THEY CHARGED US 20% TIP. We had a group of 6, which ok, most places automatically add tip. That's fine. But if you do, they  need to tell you somewhere, and I never, ever, ever, ever have been charged TWENTY PERCENT. 5. And what pissed me off more? THEY DIDN'T GIVE US OUR CHANGE. What kind of business does that?! I realize it was only like $4....but after over-charging us, and then extra-charging us tip, they keep our change? SHADY. SO SHADY.  6. Decent parking in the area.  7. Service was good.",0.8955,0.825,0.106,0.069,0.6211389961389961
2011-05-02,3.0,"Nightwood, why did you have to go and mess up my 5 star review by completely failing me with bad service? I make it a point to overweight my Yelp rating on food and underweight on service, but I had to knock Nightwood for bad service, making us wait almost 40 min after our reservation time, and a shady tactic when they messed up our order. The good....we stopped in at noon for brunch with a reservation made on OpenTable. We were told it would be a wait, and fortunately got 2 seats at the bar. We ordered a couple of drinks and started off with the butterscotch bacon donut, which was amazing.   The butterscotch syrup was a beatiful mild flavor and texture, and the doughnut was very light and fluffy, reminiscent of Krispy Kreme. The bacon was minced and loaded into the center. This was just an absolutely delightful dish. In fact, the party sitting next to us saw it (when it was mistakenly served to them) and ordered it even after having finished their brunch! My entree was the bagel sandwich. A very large dish with a wonderful light Rushing waters smoked cream cheese (the highlight).  I was shocked by how tasty the slaw was, very unique and not overly creamy. The tots were not quite what I expected, as they were more like hash browns that had been breaded and deep fried. I was served three tots on my plate and finished two of them as they seemed almost too fried and heavy for my taste. The bad...first our wait even with a reservation was 40 min. To me that is simply unacceptable. Why have a reservation when you have to wait almost an hour anyway?  We ended up just eating at the bar since we were hungry and didn't have three hours to spend for brunch. Second, our doughnut was served to the party next to us. Now, those girls should have said they hadn't ordered the doughnut, but we had to ask the bartender to get the doughnut for us. Third, and most annoying. They had served my wife the wrong order.  When we  notified our server of the issue, he politely took the order back to correct it.  When her dish arrived, they had switched out the main entrée and left the tots and toast from her old dish, which had been served 15 min ago and both were completely cold. Seriously??? Is this how you run a restaurant? Especially when we are paying $16 and entrée?  Cold toast? C'mon people. Overall the food was outstanding and I would return just for the doughnut, but the management at Nightwood needs to improve their reservation system and correct these service issues before I will be spending more hard earned coin here.",0.8311,0.838,0.08,0.083,0.5279591836734694

2011-04-29,3.0,"I came here with the famed Filly G. of yelp the other night, and our mutual friend Frank, who has had the itch to try out some Mexican in Pilsen. Considering we could not settle on a Mexican place we all agreed on (namely Phil's aversion to one specific Mexi restaurant Frank wanted to try), we decided to give Nightwood a shot. Because I don't eat most meats, I checked out the menu beforehand to make sure there were at least a couple veggie options that I would consider, and there were. However, this restaurant is not very vegetarian-friendly as most of the entrees were straight up meat on a bone with only two pasta dish entrees, and one fish (I think). In any case, one of the pasta dishes was called ""Potato Bugs"". So get this, I am such a gullible moron I actually thought this restaurant served straight up big ass black potato bugs. I was actually looking forward to hearing our server explain this as I was so perplexed, yet intrigued. When I asked if there ""really were potato bugs on the menu?"" she snickered and said ""oh, I forgot that we have an 'insect' on the menu. no, those would be the nickname for gnocci"". So yeah, I felt like an ass. She was nice about it and maybe found my naivety a tad endearing. Who knows. So, on to the food...  I ordered a licorice type pasta with some ricotta cheese and pistachio sauce concoction, which I enjoyed. And Frank's potato bugs were delish as well. I actually liked Frank's dish the best out of all of them. Phil's trout (?) I did not try; however, he claimed it was too fishy. We also were served some biscuits with honey butter, and I ordered a glass of pinot gris. This place is not cheap. My (moderate) portion of pasta cost $22! And my glass of wine $11.50 (I opted for the cheaper glass of white as the only other glass was $15). And I just felt like the food, and their limited selection, was not enough to justify anything above a 3-star rating. In fact, I was considering 2-star, but I did like my meal. I didn't love it, but I liked it. We skipped on dessert because we thought it would be fun to change it up and go elsewhere.

2011-04-27,5.0,"Ohhh boy, Nightwood. It was awesome. [end short-form review] [begin long-winded review] I went for the first time on a Saturday night with a reservation. As soon as entering, we were instantly greeted by the friendly staff and promptly seated. The ambiance is perfect for a date or meal with good friends; dark and intimate, a kind of minimalistic-rustic (??? I just made that up) decor with a good-looking crowd of 20/30/40-somethings looking forward to a good night. For food, we ordered a lot because it's one of those menus where everything looks good (and because that's just how I roll [un]fortunately). The sweetbreads, sardines, and semolina trofie to start. The chicken and trout as entrées. The cheesecake with scoops of homemade chocolate and peanut butter ice cream for dessert. A bottle of malbec during the meal and an espresso to finish it off.  Just like we expected, everything we ordered was at the least great. As an aside, I really do try to avoid ordering chicken at restaurants, but this is one of the rare places where it is completely understandable and worth it. Seriously, it's good to know that you can't go wrong at a place where you're paying a bit more than usual.  Speaking of the price, we came out to about $100/person after tax and tip. A lot, I agree. But given the amount of food we ordered plus the bottle of wine, I bet you could have a really satisfying time for probably $50-60/person. In any case, I didn't mind paying given our experience and the special occasion. The service was good; quick and attentive. What I especially liked is that there is a ""water guy"" (couldn't think of a better term) who goes around and offers tap or sparkling water, which is made in-house (I never really understood sparkling water; doesn't it just make you full? But I guess cool to have the option). And they're poured from large glass bottles, not sweaty pitchers. Just a pet peeve of mine; glass seems cleaner... [end random OCD section] The only part I didn't like about my experience at Nightwood is that it is a pain to get to it. I can't fault them for it, just an inconvenience for most people I'm guessing.

And the first thing I had to get my hands on was the Nightella doughnut, stuffed with, you guessed it, nutella. It was rich and divine. I also snagged some bites of my parents' butterscotch doughnut with bacon on top. I almost jumped over the counter to grab the jar of bacon soaking in maple syrup. It was just...so...amazing. The salty bacon really complimented the sweet butterscotch. Every bite melted in my mouth. For the rest of the meal, we enjoyed some great bacon and sausage from The Butcher and Larder. Both had a great taste and were very enjoyable. My mother ordered the bread pudding french toast and for sure I helped her out on the last few bites. It had a lemon curd sauce served and raspberry couliswith it. The light flavors all came together really well, and the entire dish was just rich and delicious. My father had the breakfast sandwich on a bagle. Again, I stole a few bites and even ate the rest for breakfast the next morning. The sauce was just the right amount of savory, nothing overpowering.

Great: cocktail and wine list.  I couldn't pass up a chance to try the house-made tamarind syrup with Buffalo Trace bourbon, so that's what I ordered.  Not as fussy as some of the other cocktails on the menu, but I typically prefer straightforward combinations, and this one hit the spot!  Simple and just sweet enough. Also great: fried meyer lemon with aioli.  Most memorable appetizer of the past few months. Good: our entrees.  Trout was fresh, perfectly prepared and lovely, but just a bit boring.  Same for the fried chicken.  Very good, but too much of one thing on the plate.

2011-04-18,5.0,"I had a really pleasurable experience at brunch yesterday. It was jam packed when we showed up and had to wait for a table to open up....and wait and wait...The manager (owner?) came up to us several times to keep us updated on wait times and told us people kept lingering despite having their bills on the table. Finally she recommended/gave us the option to grab bar seating in the back, I was reluctant at first but my hunger won out. I am glad I did, the bar at the back gives you a first hand view of the open kitchen. It was almost hypnotic watching the four chefs churn out plate after plate of beautiful food. The one downside was that I was so consumed by what was going on in the kitchen that I was not the most conversant brunch date (I blamed it on a rough Saturday night out though...). Before we even ordered the manager brought over a round of free drinks and apologized for the wait and then after we ordered one of the chefs gave us a free bacon glazed donut (yes, you read correctly...and trust me, this isn't of these kitschy ""lets put bacon on everything"" deals....it was a mind blowing (read: best ever) donut). It's the little things like this that help ease the unavoidable and often frustrating long wait times on the Chicago brunch scene.  The food was spectacular (beyond the donut), I had the Ram and Eggs. It was hearty, yet sophisticated and complex, but still had a rustic and simple feel to it. Everything was well balanced, my egg was cooked perfectly and topped with anchovies, pistachio and a touch of some type of herb/olive oil dressing. This was all draped over a bratwurst sized sausage (which I'm not sure what was in it, but it was lean, tasty and perfectly cooked) in-between a nice crusty bread roll.  I really loved the menu, it was a departure from standard brunch fare, but it wasn't different just for the sake of being ""inventive"" or ""avant-guarde."" The interesting combinations seemed to work very well (but to be honest, I didn't know what a lot of the ingredients on the menu were), while still giving you a different take on your old favorites but not stray so far that they are unrecognizable.  The food was stellar, the service was great, I really liked the impression that all the employees felt like they had a vested interest in our meal/experience. Two of the chefs came over separately and asked about our meal, not just how it was but how specific components were. Overall a great time, although quite popular and busy, management did a great job balancing this out. A lesson that should be taken note of from their fellow competitors.  Prices were also very reasonable (everything was well under $20), despite using top notched ingredients (everything seemed to be locallly sourced, but I am not 100% on this).",0.9991,0.731,0.237,0.032,0.5758713961775188

Judging from my sister's review, the menu hasn't changed much since last summer.  The duck and the wood grill trout was still on the list. Starter:  Deep Fried Mortadella and Lamb Belly. I believe the lamb belly  should never be served as an appetizer.  The rough texture of the meat and high fat content made me feel as if though my artery was going to clog with each bite.  It would have been better if it was pork belly instead.   The Deep Fried Mortadella tasted like a fried ham and cheese ball.  It was ok. Finally, here comes my steak... Wood grill round steak for one.  As always, I requested for the meat to be cooked to medium.  The steak is served already sliced, so immediately I noticed that the center was red.  Medium usually means pink, right?  Not a big deal.  I flag the waitress down and asked that it gets slightly more cooked. Steak 1.1 is served.  New steak?  No.   (I wasn't expecting one - not that much of a food snob.)  Slightly more cooked?  Yes.  Perfect medium?  No.  Since the meat was cooked after it's been sliced, the texture has changed dramatically.  It was tough, rough, and a battle to cut through even with a steak knife.  The flavor was mediocre at best,  but I ate away at the steak anyway because I just felt bad wasting food. I'm saddened.  I've waited so long to try this place.  My sister raved about it, and now I've departed with the haunting memory of that awful steak.   On a good note:  my bf had the burger which wasn't bad and the service there is pretty good.  Above all, they are very generous with the alcohol for some of their house cocktails.",-0.62,0.817,0.086,0.097,0.48309235209235235

But the service was very good- constant supply of fresh coffee, and quick, friendly service. The food I got was actually so gross I spit out a bite in my napkin, and then sent it back for the malted waffles, which were nothing special- toaster waffles (burnt on the edges) with chocolate sauce on top. Size: about 1.5 actual toaster waffles. Lame. So my original order was the venison omlette with creme fraiche. The ""omlette"" was like one millimeter thick, and just looked sad and flopped over. The craime fraiche was the exact same color as the omelette (lite yellow), and looked like a watery cheese sauce. The venison inside was kind of pulled, but also with lots of big chunks of pure gelatinous fat. The overall effect: slimy upon slimy upon slimy (and visually off-putting) was so gross I couldn't chew or swallow my bite of it. I have not spit my food out at a restaurant in a long time.

The first time we went to Nightwood was in September when the weather was still nice enough to sit outside (those were the days, huh?). The outdoor patio is small but pleasant - perhaps a little noisy so consider yourselves forewarned. The food was very well done - I particularly enjoyed the fried asparagus - but overshadowed by the amount of waiting we had to do to get some attention from our waiter. To give you an inkling of what I'm talking about, we waited 25 minutes for our cocktails and asked for them three times. We returned to Nightwood for Valentine's Day 2011. Like most restaurants, Nightwood offered a prix fixe, but also gave diners the option of selecting off a larger menu, which was greatly appreciated! I couldn't get enough of the Michigan smelts with creme fraiche - a wonderful combination. The spit-roasted half chicken was crispy and perfectly cooked. And the bread pudding with salted caramel sauce is definitely a winner (and I don't normally love bread pudding!). But, once again, we found ourselves wondering where our waitress was and feeling largely ignored. Four stars may be a bit generous for what I consider consistently lacking service, but the food at Nightwood is truly good, and deserving of the rating.

I wasn't expecting a bottomless plate of spaghetti, but I was expecting to leave satisfied. First they bring us out two tiny pieces of bread, each about the size of a ring box. Good, but definitely not enough. Then we ordered the sweetbread and it was okay. I'm not a foodie and I honestly thought sweetbread was some kind of bread that is sweet. No...it's an organ of some sort. That's my fault for not asking, but it was okay anyway. We each ordered a pasta dish and when it arrived, it was on a plate that reminded me of the amount I serve my two-year-old niece. Yes, the pasta is hand made and very good, but I left with a bad taste in my mouth anyway. A taste of being ripped off. I'm definitely willing to spend a lot on a good dinner, but in this case, it's just not worth it. If you're looking for a good food experience outside of the loop and in the Bridgeport area, go to Nana's instead.",0.9839,0.727,0.198,0.075,0.49650000000000005

I was looking forward to going to Nightwood to celebrate our husbands' birthdays.  We made our reservation for last night weeks ago and when I confirmed yesterday I thought that I made it clear we wanted to be in the front room.  We arrived to a packed restaurant.  When we were seated it was near the kitchen- with the wait staff going back and forth, and back and forth.  It was NOT where I had anticipated our celebration- it was unappealing and the back and forth was driving us crazy.  I left the table to speak with our waitress and the owner's wife overheard us talking and graciously changed our table although I would have preferred that it had been done initially when I said something instead of essentially being ignored. Our meal was delicious although with a few negative comments- they were already our of one appetizer and one main and served the skimpiest smelts appetizer.  We were told that it was because they had only received a limited amount that day and coupled it with beets. (I think there were 6 smelts on our plate and my husband had been so looking forward to them since our last visit- he had been told by our waitress then that they were always on the menu. Desserts were underwhelming. I think a first class restaurant plans well for its clientele and doesn't run out of ITEMS.

Great concept (co-created menu with their farmers) but Nightwood hasn't quite mastered the execution.  I came for dinner and was disappointed in the quality (and originality) of the goat cheese beet baguette and found the polenta to be under-seasoned with a texture that resembled morning oatmeal. Portion sizes are too large for my taste, while the vegetarian options were a little slim. The carrot soup was delicious, but lacked the complexity of the soup you would get at, say, Girl and the Goat. Too much bread, butter, oil and pasta throughout.

2011-02-20,2.0,"My GF and I visited nightwood two nights ago, and had some very high expectations, but unfortunately, none of the dishes lived up to their hypes, and it was overall very disappointing. The night started off well with the drinks at the bar; the bartenders were friendly, while the drinks weren't incredible, the draft beer was fresh and aromatic, and the mixed cocktail was tasty and refreshing. Having read many positive reviews about the smelt and sweetbread, we were not hesitant to order one of each as appetizers.  We also ordered the wood grilled whole trout and the polenta as our entrees. Deep fried smelt: This was supposedly one of the best things Chicago had to offer, and I was deeply disappointed.  Maybe, just maybe, for someone who has never had fresh seafood, this dish may be interesting, but overall, I found it to be extremely boring and uninspired.  Also, my fish was under-seasoned, and I had to repeatedly add salt from the shaker. Sweetbread: The sweetbread was slightly better than the smelt, but I did not love it either.  While the slightly spicy batter was an absolutely delight, its ratio to sweetbread ratio was way too low, perhaps it would have been a better dish had they flatter out the sweetbread for more surface area.  The sweetbread was juicy and moist, but I think it would really go well with a sauce of some kind. Whole trout: I was really looking forward to the trout, but unfortunately, it was, by far, the worst dish of the night.  Generally speaking, I love a runny egg on anything, but I found it really hard to eat raw yolk with fish, when combined, both the texture and the taste were completely off.  The fish was cooked rather nicely, and I commend the restaurant for boning the fish, but again, it was missing a sauce!  It's incredibly difficult to just eat plain grilled fish with olive oil.  I honestly had trouble finishing this dish. Polenta: This was by far my favourite dish of the night.  The ground polenta was cooked very nicely, and the mushroom really added essential flavour and textural contrast.  Compared to the fish, this dish was really comforting, and I just wanted to keep on eating it. Dessert: fig cake with goat cheese I really liked the dessert, and it was somewhat of a saving grace for this restaurant (much like my Morimoto experience actually).  The dessert was very well thoughtout, the warm fig cake went extremely well with the goat cheese topping, and it was as if I was eating cheese and crackers. Service: I feel bad for saying this, but I really did not enjoy the service.  I felt that our waitress had a ""holier-than-thou"" attitude (this was my perception, to say the least).  When I asked for recommendations, she suggested something that she has never tried simply because it ""sounded really good"".  When we inquired about the lack of apple cake on the menu (it's in fact still stated on the website) and showed disappointment, she was extremely unapologetic and stated very matter-of-factly that it was just not there. Maybe it was a particularly bad night, but I will most likely never return.",0.9566,0.747,0.142,0.111,0.5606609615874321

Everything else, great: 1) Honey butter and biscuits brought over after we ordered were unexpected in this kind of restaurant but delicious (if a wee bit salty). 2) Drinks were tasty and not too strong. I had the pink whippet, she had some sort of concord grape concoction that did not bring to mind the slightly tart and overly sweet artificial taste of most grape beverages. 3) Starter of beets, avocado in some sort of lime-cilantro marinade, and whipped goat cheese was fantastic. The three separate little piles of flavor complemented each other very well and also worked well together on the accompanying bread. 4) Pasta dishes (I got farfalle with mornay, crab and pea shoots, my dinner partner had rigatoni bolognese) were both flawless. Right amount of sauce, pasta was cooked perfectly al dente (just the right amount of chewiness) and tasted super-fresh, and the cook was not stingy on the other components (crab/ pea shoots/ meat). 5) Buttermilk panna cotta with citrusy shortbread wafer, honey citrus salad and sweet citrus syrup was the perfect, balanced end to our meal. Not too sweet, just tart enough, and the panna cotta was small but didn't overwhelm with its creaminess. 6) Waitress and bus boy were both super attentive and out water was constantly refilled.",0.9972,0.75,0.217,0.034,0.6253193960511031

I made a reservation but there were plenty of tables open around 7 pm on a week night. My fiancé and I were asked if we wanted to sit at the kitchen bar but ended up going with a normal table instead. The idea of the kitchen bar seemed like a really neat concept, it's always fun to see your food getting prepared.  With a quick look over the drink menu we both decided to go with one of the craft cocktails, they had an ok beer selection but nothing really jumped out at us. I ordered the pumpkin old fashion which was pretty great. Never thought about using a pumpkin bitter to create a seasonal cocktail. For dinner we ended up sharing a handful of small plates. Everything on the menu sounded pretty good and we both wanted to try as much as we could. A couple highlights were the Poached Farm Egg and the Butternut Squash pasta. Since it was a birthday dinner I couldn't pass up the chance to try a few things off the dessert menu. My favorite was the Lemon Curd but the fiancé loved the Chocolate Pumpernickel Bread Spoon.

2011-01-09,2.0,"When you treat your customers poorly, those customers are going to get on Yelp and tell all their friends that you like to treat your customers badly. Well, I'm telling my friends that they should definitely not spend a dime of their money supporting this establishment because they have let their popularity go to their heads. And with their giant inflated heads, they can't possibly quote an accurate wait, provide good customer service, or have the decency to make it up to you when they've royally screwed up. I have NEVER ever waited for a table for this long. I got a table at Hot Doug's faster.  Yes, it was our fault for not having reservations on a Saturday night but this was not planned. The other restaurant we were originally going to go to didn't take reservations and had a two and a half hour wait, so we decided to go to Nightwood instead--big mistake. I called ahead and put our name down. We were quoted an hour for a table for four. We ended up waiting almost TWO whole hours for a table!!! We kept checking in with the host and hostess who kept saying a table is just about to get up--except one hour went by and no one got up. There's nothing around here within walking distance of the restaurant so it's a destination spot and people like to linger at their table for hours!!!  So you would think that the manager of a well-known restaurant would: A) recognize that it's wrong to go over your quote by a whole hour (you should know by now what the Saturday night flow is at your restaurant). B) Come over and apologize and take immediate steps to remedy the situation (like for example, let us order food at the bar). C) Comp a portion of the meal. What did the manager do? NOTHING. In fact when he got word that I was irritated and annoyed, he avoided us.  So all of this would have been water under the bridge if the following didn't happen. A table finally opened up. It had two seats on it but was definitely large enough to seat four people. The hostess walks right past me and seats a couple that just walked in through the door. At this point I became IRATE!!! I went up to her and asked why we were not seated at that table and her response was that she didn't think we'd be comfortable at that table and would want to wait for another larger table. REALLY?!?!?!?!?!?!?!? Do you think it's comfortable sitting on a metal bar stool for TWO hours, holding your winter jacket in your lap, starving, watching everyone else around you eat?????? Are you kidding me?!?!?!  Twenty minutes later, we were finally seated at a drafty table by the door. Our waitress provided sub-par service. Even after all of this I was excited to try the food, but even the food was a huge let down.  Pork belly--I've had better at XOCO. Lamb shank--not even really a lamb shank, more like tiny pieces of lamb served in a small patty. You want awesome lamb shank, go to Noon O Kabab. Polenta with mushrooms--you want better polenta, go to Enoteca Roma. Burrata--should just be called bread in tomato sauce with side of cheese. Food was uninspired, lacking originality and taste. Overpriced for the tiny portions. There was nothing at all worth coming here for. The two stars I've given are for the two genuinely nice bartenders at the bar who were the only ones who cared about us. They provided excellent service, chatted with us, and made an effort to ease our pain.

Tots.  Who doesn't like tots?  Nightwood's tots rocks!  Homemade tots that are bigger than golfballs? Yum!   Not long ago we three were at the counter enjoying our bacon donut (share one, otherwise, you'll have a heart attack) and admiring the white chocolate cranberry breakfast bread pudding that the chef was plating.  We finished our donut (in three bites!) and were sipping our tasty bloodys when a huge plate of bread pudding arrived and I explained that there must be an error, we hadn't order it.  The reply?  ""Oh, it's a gift from the chef.""  Nice!  It was delicious! The chicken and waffles are the way to go for this non-egg eater.  I strayed once and spent my entire meal coveting the chicken and waffles as the made their way out of the kitchen and into the mouths of other diners.

2011-01-03,5.0,"One of the best brunch spots EVER.  Definitely the best donut of my LIFE - that deserves the 5 stars, no question. Freshly fried Boston cream pie donut at Nightwood = best breakfast treat of all time. After this sensational bite, we wanted to be gluttonous and order the bacon butterscotch donut as well, but we were too full after our yummy breakfasts to have another donut.  Next time for sure. My fiance had the fish tacos which were served deconstructed in a bowl w/all the ingredients and you make the taco yourself. He enjoyed it immensely, but I tried it and was not too impressed (however, I was NOT in the fish taco mood and I didn't like the hominy beans in it).  I wanted some lighter fare even though the bagel fried egg sandwich looked sooooo freakin good. So I went with the whipped goat cheese with prosciutto and pears on a baguette...it was so decadent and I've never had anything like that. There were GOBS of goat cheese left over so the chef that made it quickly got me another piece of the wonderful bread to sop up all the goodness (we were sitting at the kitchen counter, which was really neat to see all the chefs in action and how quickly they put out all the food!).  We also had the tots as a side, and boy were they delicious and different! Fried ball of hash browns, not a solid tot like you would expect...oh it was so wonderful. Service was a little slow but it didn't matter since we were entertained with watching the kitchen, but had we not been sitting there, it may have been a problem.  I can't wait to go back to Nightwood for another amazing brunch (and for the bacon donut!!) and for dinner as well.",0.9942,0.758,0.187,0.055,0.5224279835390947

Let me say the bacon butterscotch donut was truly delicious. It was a fresh donut with a butterscotch glaze that was topped with diced thick cut bacon. I'm not necessarily the biggest bacon fan, but this combination really worked. The confit duck omelet and the pea tendril egg scramble were good, but nothing special. However, the tater tots that come with those items were AWESOME!  these tots are nothing like those ore-ida (nothing wrong with those) and are much better. They have a thicker very crunchy outside and a very soft and fluffy inside. It's something you really have to try there. I wish they gave more than just three per plate!! Oh, I also ordered a hot chocolate. The consistency was good, but the tempearture was actually very lukewarm, which was odd to me. So, this was a slight disappointment on an otherwise great meal.

2010-12-14,5.0,"Mama may have taught me not to talk with my mouth full, but Mama never ate the spit-roasted half chicken at Nightwood. How can one raised with even the best of manners not praise the heavens and the chef for this dish while shoveling it into her grateful mouth? As a special surprise on my birthday, I was treated to dinner at Nightwood. It was the perfect place to celebrate my birthday. Though we arrived early for our reservations, we were able to snag two spots at the bar where the gentleman ordered a whiskey straight and I ordered a Whiskey Daisy, a delicious concoction of Jim Bean Rye, mulberry syrup and lemon. We were promptly seated at a table by the window where my bulky coat was whisked away for comfort's sake. After deliberating over the menu, we ordered the Slagel Farm Spit-Roasted Chicken for him and the Roast Squab, Foie Gras, Parsnip, Pear, Pea Tendrils with Black Walnuts dish for her. Yep. I like my meals ridiculously succulent and fatty, thank you. We were given a delicious plate of bread, which appeared to melt in our mouths, while we waited, and sipped on wine. The atmosphere of the place was bustling, but not overwhelming or oppressive. We were cozy and comfortable and lost in our own conversation while we waited. Now, about the squab, I did not know what I was ordering, but this is the beauty of a place like Nightwood. You can go in pretty ignorant and end up with a dish that is different but delicious. Nightwood allows you to take chances where you might not at other establishments. The squab was exactly as it should be--bursting wtih flavor, featuring fatty and greasy skin and tender red meat that was somewhat tough to get to, given that the bird is so small. Would I have ordered squab if I had known that it was a baby pigeon? Probably not. Was it delicious? Yes. So there you have it. The little foie gras mixed with the dish were MIND. BLO. WING. Mind-blowing, people. The gentleman's half chicken was, as I mentioned above, unreal. Chicken has never tasted as savory as it was. It was rich with flavor, moist and absolutely decadent. The dude kept slipping more on my plate for me, which was sweet because it was so tasty and my squab was so tiny. We literally could not stop talking about how delicious this dish was. As it was my birthday, I ordered myself the chocolate pumpernickel bread pudding. It was also scrumptious. The chocolate melted in my mouth and made me weak at the knees. I cleaned the plate! Nightwood's not in my budget for visiting regularly, but I'm sticking it in my back pocket as a great spot for a special treat.",0.9987,0.748,0.214,0.037,0.6041442599953237

We went with a party of about eight, so we got a little bit of almost everything on the menu. We did manage to do some sharing, towards the end of the night and we got some baked goat cheese to share around the table, and it was excellent. The pasta dishes are small portions, the kind of portions you expect from a super-expensive restaurant, small and made to look even smaller by the huge plate it comes on. However, the more expensive entrees are kind of large portions... much larger than you'd expect. Everything I tried was very tasty. The standout of the night were the desserts.

I decided to keep my coat on for a bit because it was so cold out and I didn't feel warm even after being seated.  We waited for a while before anyone attended to us.  Someone finally brought us water and left. Obviously, he wasn't our server.  We wondered who our server was... then a lady came over asking if we'd like to get started with something to drink. I actually asked her if she was our server... and she was. We asked to move to a warmer part of the restaurant, away from the main entrance where it was super cold due to the extremely cold weather outside. We were seated near the open kitchen in the back of the restaurant. I immediately felt warmer and I was able to take off my coat. Then we waited some more... I guess since we were moved to a different section of the restaurant, the lady server wasn't serving us any longer...  FINALLY, our new server had come to our table. He asked us if we wanted something to drink.  I told him that we wanted to have something to drink but we were also ready order. We started with the chestnut cream stuffed donut with chocolate glaze and marshmallow. It sounded better than it actually tasted.  We split the donut in half, but unfortunately, my half of the donut barely had any filling.  I was a bit disappointed by the lack of the chestnut flavor in the filling.  The chocolate glaze was over powering and didn't seem like that special.  It was warm and crispy but not worth $4. For our entrees, we ordered the spinach goat cheese quiche and the malted waffle with chicken wings.  To my surprise, our entrees came out pretty fast.  The quiche was really good and just perfect in flavor and texture but I would have liked it to be a bit warmer.  The malted waffle was really crispy and so were the chicken wings. To my surprise, the salted caramel sauce went well with the chicken wings. Overall, the food was great! We would definitely come back for the food.  Service was just ok,  since we had to constantly track down our server to get the refill on the coffee and the ginger ale.   I would have given it a 3.5 stars, if I could have.

Everything was absolutely, out-of-this-world amazing. There is no denying that. The mixture of flavors (squash, prosciutto, arugula) in the casoncelli was perfect, in my opinion, and the pork belly positively melted in your mouth (just don't think of your arteries while you eat it).  The atmosphere is great, and the wood-centric design of the place is charming and romantic. The staff is also great, from the bartenders to the hostess.

It's larger, with an open floor plan and so bright compared to it's big sister - which has it's own ambiance. All the wood details, the design, and open kitchen really liven it up. We had reservations for a birthday brunch, and had no trouble adding attendees (ended up with 4, from the original 2). We did wait a few minutes, but the bartender was making drinks and we could peak around a little bit. Always tricky deciding what to order, but we were early for a change, so breakfast was the winner. Ever since a great breakfast at a little spot (King's Cafe) in Cali - I lust after quiche with a nice simple side salad. Upon discovering a lovely ham, aged cheddar and broccoli quiche on the menu with greens - my decision was easy. Drinks were tasty (our table sampled both coffee and bar drinks), donuts were divine, and for the most part, everything was stellar and we all traded tastes. Loved the fall components of the menu - tried the sweet potato frittata, the bagel sandwich (spied at the bar) while messy, was enjoyed by our tablemate. The only small issue - our companion ordered eggs over medium, and sent them back (too runny). When they arrived again, they were more towards over hard (at that point, she went with it); she works in food service, finds that many places can't quite hit over medium.",0.9922,0.796,0.169,0.036,0.5244419642857143

I was a little worried at first because there is not a lot of meatless options as the menu isn't extensive, and I was glad it wasn't an issue.  I ordered the eggs benedict and it was excellent!  My bf had the waffles with strawberry something or other,  and he also really loved his.

First, you can't make the Bib Gourmand criterion (two courses, and wine or dessert for under $40 pre tax and tip) unless you order the cheaper $11 - $13 entrees (like pasta, or cheeseburger).  Many entrees are in the $21 - $28 range.  We found their appetizers and desserts to be excellent, and 3 out of 4 of our entrees to be average in taste and appeal - wife having garganelli pasta, daughter having a black trumpet mushroom sformato (like a souffle), and son having a blandish duck leg.  I had a wood grilled trout, and that was an exception and excellent.  It was also flawlessly deboned.  Rabbit wasn't available on this night , and too bad!   All entrees and other servings are on the smallish side for the price, but you're paying for fresh quality and taste here.  Our appetizers were a nice veal sweetbread, and clams.  Desserts were a lemon pudding cake, and a nice, very dense pot 'o creme with raspberry filling.   I also personally enjoyed a bargain and nice $5 draft pint of Old Rasputin, a California brewed Russian Imperial Stout with 9% ABV, and that was probably a star right there.   Street parking was easy and area was well lit and felt safe, as we weren't  very familiar with the midway location between Chinatown and Pilsen.  The  restaurant's dining areas are kind of broken down into three distinct areas -  the main area with 2 and 4 person tables up front and by the windows (where we were at), a long narrow strip of 4 person tables adjacent to the bar, and then a dining area by the open kitchen in the back of restaurant.  The dining room was vibrant and it felt like we were in Lincoln Park or somewhere similar.  The business is 2 years old.  Service was friendly and very attentive.   Overall, a recommended and interesting place to dine, but you have to personally find out what works best for you here.",0.9962,0.807,0.176,0.016,0.49926673567977903

They were much more basic tasting then described on the drink menu. The appetizer we had was great; creamy cheese, delicious cherry tomatoes and bread, really well balanced and tasty. My friend got gnocchi with short rib which was good, and I had a burger. The burger was good...but here is my biggest complaint-this chef clearly has firm beliefs on how his food ""should"" be cooked despite the guests' order. Before my meal was delivered, two diners next to us received their burgers, one promptly sent hers back for being too under cooked and the other left much on her plate. I over heard her later explaining she didn't know how raw it was until she took a few bites. Now I do not like my meat cooked to extremes, just a nice pink medium for me, which is how I ordered. My burger was better described as rare; very rare. Why bother asking diners how they want their food cooked if the chef will not honor it and simply cooks the food to his or her own liking? Not the best dining experience I have had recently. The flavors were good, however, i would have loved to enjoy the burger even more with it being cooked properly, as in how it was ordered.",0.9921,0.727,0.202,0.072,0.4994253663003665

Shortly after we sat down there was a parade of fashionably dressed youngsters, hitting the fancy food on the early side of a Sunday morning. Like I said, we split the bacon donut. Good lord that was evil. Evil in the best way ever, basically. After our hearts recovered from the indulgence (we split one donut between three people and it was plenty), we ordered our breakfasts. The service was great. The ""tots"" are not to be missed. I had an apple omelet with blue cheese. Oh man it was good. My husband had some spicy eggplant thing and our friend had a frittata. Frittata is just a fun word to say, admit it (and hard to spell). The baby had a waffle and some fruit but was really more interested in trying to snag our cups of coffee.

The rundown I can vouch for the smelts, sardines, and trout - they were all phenomenal. Smelts were lightly breaded and fried, and served with a creme fraiche.  The Sardines were smoked, and prepared with a delicious rosemary butter - there were veggies with this, but they didn't really add or detract from the dish.  The sardines in the sauce were good enough to stand on their own. Now the trout - I can honestly say that this is the most tasty fish entree I can recall ever having.  The fish has a smoky flavor, paired with a salad of mustard greens, beets, onions, and an almost salty dressing that is just perfect. I had a small bite of my husband's ratatouille, but not enough to really vouch for it.  He seemed really pleased.  He also had a blackberry and peach crumble that seemed to vaporize before I could have second thoughts about being too full to try some.

Turned out to be more exciting sounding, it was a pretty chilled out kitchen, which is fine.  The biscuits they gave us at first were meh....kinda dry and easy to forget. So was the sweetened up butter.  I think what really turned me off was our first course, the burrata, an Italian mozzarella which has a silken creamy center which is to be savored as sweeter than the most profound nectar. BUT, the one they gave us was already cut open and we were given a 1/4 piece of the whole......for 15 BUCKS? EWW. On the menu it was described as being served with charred peppers, but we got ONE hidden in some greens. and we got a half of some ciabatta bread or something. I seriously felt robbed.

I love experimenting in the kitchen and can appreciate the effort it takes to put out inspired quality plates. We have been to Nightwood a number of times and have loved it each and every time! Our first experience was a brunch. I was VERY excited about the bacon donuts (REALLY BACON ....ON DONUTS!!!???), as well as the Poutine with Duck confit, duck gravy and poached egg. Can life get any better? Since the brunch we have been to Nightwood more than a handful of times. Many people have issue with the size of the portions, but I think they are just right. I think in the US we have come to accept overeating and massive plates as getting your money's worth. Not true or right. Nightwood practices a quality over quantity approach to food. It is evident in each bite. I am a little one, and at other restaurants I typically can split an appetizer and finish 1/2 the entree, then feel like crap for overeating yet upset for not being able to try one of the awesome looking deserts. But at Nightwood the freshness and lightness of each of the meals is a refreshing change. At the end of each course, you are left a little depressed that there is no more to eat because it was so good, but if you choose the correct next course according to your tastes you are not upset for too long. AND THERE IS ALWAYS ROOM FOR A LITTLE DESSERT! I love feeling satisfied... not full to the point of splitting at the seams. Every dish that I have had or have tasted from other people at the table was amazing. Eat bite is a perfect bite.  Overall highly recommended!

This was my first time dining at Nightwood and I was with a large group.  I agree with others that commented about the service when sitting in a large group.  We were at a long table  in the basement level ... no problem!  However, the service seemed somewhat slow ... not horrible.   Can't wait to go back with my husband!",0.9863,0.742,0.223,0.034,0.5000240500240501

I think it might have ended up being cheaper than Lula, for two people with drinks it was only $48. More of a special occasion brunch, but worth the treat! Then I ordered the eggs benedict, and it is my new favorite eggs benedict of the city. (yes it's better than the eggs royale at feast!!!!) My boyfriend had a simple eggs and hash browns with toast and a side of soy sausage. Delicious soy sausage, and they had delicious jam. It was also one of the better deals ($6).

2010-06-29,4.0,"We decided to drive to Nightwood around 5pm on a Saturday.  During the Puerto Rican Parade.  After an hour and fifteen minutes later, we finally arrived.  While in the car, we were all grumbling that the food better be worth the headache of just getting there. The entrance is some what hidden.  The beautiful patio is to the left and then the entrance is a side door.  This was evident to the numerous people we saw walk by the entrance and go around the building while we sat at our corner window table.  But, I digress.  That is not going to be the focal point of this review.  The food.  We were not disappointed.  Our dinner party consisted of my parents, husband and myself and when we get together, we eat well.   We started out with appetizers: chicken livers, beet salad, and two walleye on a bed of greens.   My chicken livers were perfect.  I love the irony creamy taste and everyone agreed.  I normally don't like to share my meal with people.  I admit it, I'm selfish.  I like to eat MY ordered meal.  But, it was too good to not share! Dinner was as follows: whole Wisconsin trout with bacon, wood grilled cheeseburger, and two orders of duck.  The food was divine.  I ordered the trout which was a touch too salty for my taste, but the English peas and bacon added a nice balance of flavors.  Everyone enjoyed their meals as evident to the cleaned plates.   The ambiance, the service and the food made Nightwood a great experience for us all.  The open kitchen has a bar along one side so you may sit and watch the food being prepared.  I would love to sit there and watch the magic happen.  The brunch menu looks equally tasty as the dinner menu.  This is a place to have an intimate dinner or a small dinner party.  It is top notch and you won't leave disappointed.",0.9926,0.814,0.16,0.026,0.5661458333333333

Time has passed, seasons have changed, and I'm happy to report, this place continues to better itself.  I was seriously surprised at how much the service improved from my last visit. Everyone was attentive and made sure beverages were full, things were to our liking, etc. and this time there wasn't any attitude with it. The serving seemed to be much more of a communal effort this time, and because we went after a storm, there wasn't a wait and they weren't rushing people. The outdoor seating is cute and in the future I wouldn't mind sitting outside. I still don't think there is anything particularly special about the donuts, and it's difficult to comment on the menu because it changes frequently and I don't want to get any body's hopes up only to have them shattered at a later date. But the food again proved to be solid. They could cut back on the salt a bit, especially with the tots, but even the coffee had improved flavor this time. I secretly wish they had a few more staple breakfast items to build from but things are really evening out now with this place. Who knows, someday maybe I'll give this place 5 stars.

2010-06-26,4.0,"It was close to 7pm on a nearly-perfect Chicago summer Friday night. I was on my sofa and had enjoyed a nap.   It was also my friend's bday... but took me nearly 2 hours to force him to abandon a laid back evening and hurry up the street to Nightwood, arriving around 9pm. The restaurant was packed as expected but we spotted an open patio table, then rushed to the desk to ask how deep the waiting list was.  Though we saw several people standing nearby, the kind gentlemen asked if we had reservations (no) and said oh wait, let me see.. I only have a patio opening, will that do? It all felt a bit Disney-esque to me possibly because I still had cobwebs from my nap, but more so because how rare is it to saunter up to a popular spot on one of the busiest nights and get prime seating somewhere other than next to their boiler room? We sat down, the sun was setting and the breeze felt pleasantly tropical. The smells of nearby patrons' orders crossed us and we had a good feeling about what was to come. After receiving a mediocre bite-sized square, buttery pastry with a side of fresh butter, we looked forward to the hand cut pasta with basil, cauliflower and almonds.  The dish was offered with an herbed butter sauce and the noodles were tight and firm.  It paired well with the bottle of chilled '07 Methven Vineyards Pinot Gris from Oregon's Willamette Valley, which was perfectly smooth and crisp. Birthday boy ordered the very delicate and succulent Superior Whitefish with Three Sisters hominy and Cilantro and I pressed for the Confit of Gunthorp Farm duck leg with summer squash and oyster mushrooms.   I bit into the butt of the whitefish and it was quite gamey, seemingly soaked in a room-temp Durian fruit (which isn't a turnoff personally).  But Bday boy offered bits of the middle and it was a quite different, adult Tilapia treat, still with slight gamey overtones that brought out the floral notes in our Pinot Gris. Anyone familiar with birds like duck, ostrich and quail realize that it's quite easy to overcook.  We were impressed that they served a leg that was well-seasoned and tender, despite the challenge.  The accompanying summer squash and mushrooms did not upstage the main act. Here's a confession. The couple next to us ordered a few dishes and had a bowl of golden fries parked in the middle of their table.  The smell was so sensual that we flagged our very attentive server down and asked how quickly could she get a bowl of them over to us.  She chuckled and said it could come out with our entrees.  I'm a fat guy and've had many different kinds of french fries, but if one had to DIE and go to french fry heaven, THEY WOULD SERVE THESE FRIES.  The were impossibly crisp (cooked in a little duck fat??) on the outside but took on a fluffy, Yukon Gold potato richness inside.  We were joined for dessert by our neighbor and friend who's expecting any day now.  After a bit of debate, we settled on Nightwood's chocolate raspberry tart, almond toffee gelato and a cherry turnover.   Though the cherry turnover was light and tangy, the tart was surprisingly airy, crisp and offered subtle, high-end chocolate and fresh raspberry flavors.  It looked heavy but was quite the opposite. Bday boy decided to slather the gelato over the tart and took it to a new pleasurable level. After crashing their party, uninvited on possibly the busiest night of the week, one would hesitate to be most critical.   But I can honestly share, I felt the cuisine at Nightwood was better than what was served at Charlie Trotter's. And our meal last night was just less-than-half of his $450 bill AND included two bottles of the Pinot Gris. We plan to become regulars. :) --- UPDATE: So it was Easter weekend and after 8pm on a gorgeous Saturday night. Me and birthday boy were over on Taylor Street trying to get into a popular Italian Eatery by Stax Cafe and I'd learnt that he hadn't made a reservation as we walked through the door. 2.5 hour wait we were told.  We contemplated hitting up Bevi Amo across the street, Chez Joel nearby or going north to Cotes du Rhone but decided against that since we wanted to finish the night at Simone's Bar in Pilsen. Chez Joel couldn't seat us for another 1.5 hours and Nightwood said about 1 hour also.  We drove around and contemplated other places but it was packed all around.  I said screw it, let's park by Nightwood and just walk in and see how it goes. So we decided to just order a bottle and stand at the bar until something opened up.  A french Cab Franc. Was tasty. We nibbled on puffy fried lemon slices and ordered salmon rillettes apps, both mouth watering.  We finished up at a table, ordering the quite flavorful, crispy, spit-roasted India duck entree with foie gras (so buttery good!) and the spit-roasted chicken with Michigan ramps, lemon, garlic, mint. The chunky goat cheesecake with toasted pecans, rosemary honey and crunchy crust was sinful enough to send us to hell many times over. Good times. :)",0.9982,0.841,0.125,0.034,0.5050618971671604

I also took off a star for atmosphere: Not for the ambiance of the interior, or the pleasant outdoor patio, but for the customers!  This place is starting to look like Bucktown, what with all of the toddler-toting breeders at brunch and the invasions of Trixies and Chads on weekend nights.  I think that most of the clientele definitely comes from outside the neighborhood!   Oh, Pilsen, I know it's good for you to grow, but must douchiness accompany all economic development?",0.9651,0.832,0.143,0.024,0.48750000000000004
2010-06-21,3.0,"Located just past Chinatown, Nightwood is a gorgeous space. I loved the romantic lighting, multiple levels and general ambiance. Our large group was led down to the basement level, where we had two large picnic table setups for our fixed menu. I thought it was charming that they had printed personalized menus welcoming us and letting us know what we'd be eating that night.  We started off ordering drinks - I shared a bottle of wine and others got some specialty cocktails. It was about 45 minutes in from the time we walked into the restaurant to the time we received those drinks. The waitress explained that the bartender was swamped. The fact is the place was understaffed - our huge group and another large group downstairs was monitored only by one server for much of the night.  At this point, members in our party started to get cranky. We're a very understanding bunch, but we've had a lot of good meals and great service in our lives and we know how many wonderful businesses there are out there to patronize.  My friend next to me observed that as a former server, she thought it was strange that the server wouldn't introduce herself to the large group and explain how it was all going to work, and that we could go with her with questions. For the whole time we stared at the menu thinking that we had to choose one of the entrée options and found out much later that it would be family style and we'd be sharing it all. The items themselves sounded a bit underwhelming and I found myself longing to look at their regular menu, as I had heard good things about it in the past. We were offered a salad, trout, roasted chicken, polenta and vegetarian pasta , with rhubarb crisp for dessert.  By the time we received some biscuits and butter to munch on, we were ravenous. We had waited about an hour by then, I think... far too long to receive bread.  My favorite items included the salad, which was very simply dressed but featured some fluffy, buttery croutons that I thought were some of the best I'd ever had. I also enjoyed the side of beets, which came out very simply roasted, and the peas, which were buttery and lovely with some cheese on top. I found the trout much too salty and the polenta a bit boring and flavorless. The pasta I was looking forward to the most because I was so hungry and aching for carbs, and although the flavor was fine - spicy and garlicky - it was much too oily. Our hands were shiny after dishing the noodles onto our plates. I was impressed when they brought out large individual rhubarb crisps for dessert, but the top was much too hard and the filling too tangy and skimpy.  I think that some places just may not be equipped to host large parties and I think that they could have reached a little more to create more of an ambitious menu. I found the fact that they stuck to trout and polenta didn't seem like a good value for us, knowing that they were not providing this meal for a very low price. While I thought more highly of the place than many of my dining companions, I agreed with their complaints and thought that fluffy croutons and some yummy beets were not enough to make up for the inattentive service.",0.9973,0.807,0.155,0.039,0.4969397702991452

Then again I'm pregnant and most things smell funny these days! However, there were a few good things to Yelp about: The polenta was quite tasty.

But that wait is the same equivalent of forcing a bum to watch this place make handmade noodles every day & serve them, without ever offering them.  Now...jump-cut to when the food was served...and my Taratino violent tendencies left and I became a Technicolor dreamcoat of a food lover.  The way the lettuce felt on my palate was the way Costanza feels when draped in velvet.  The house made daily made noodles took me back to the adoration I had as a 9 year old for my Gram's noodles. The wood fired chicken left on the bone is exactly how I cook my chicken when I dream of being a hunter 'round a campfire.  The food is more American Country than New American, which seemed good for the crowd (mostly young and detached from family dining).

2010-06-16,1.0,"So, here's my problem with my latest experience at Nightwood: nothing about it compared to my previous outing and I left feeling extremely insulted. This is a place I'd told friend, yelper and anyone who would listen, ""you HAVE to come here. The menu options are so innovative. The flavor combinations will blow your mind!!"" Etc. Etc. Imagine my surprise to find those innovative flavor combinations add up to: lettuce with oil, salty pasta and chicken. What in the who? Back up. A group of friends and I came to Nightwood for a tasting menu. We arrived at 8:30. We made our way downstairs to be seated. We were full of smiles and hope. There was a large group of us (about 20). For the majority of the meal, we had one server. Mistake, the first. Since we were being treated to a tasting menu, there was no need to ask us what we wanted to eat, etc. It was already laid out for us. The only thing we needed to be asked was what we wanted to drink. So, we looked at the wine menu, made our choice..and waited. And waited. And, waited. About a half hour in, we got our drink orders to our server. Mind you, this entire time we've had NOTHING in front of us, not even bread. Mistake, the second. ""So, you're really excited about this place, right?"" ""DEFINITELY. Oh man. I ate here previously and it was beyond belief. You'll see."" ... Nearly an HOUR later, we get our drinks. Why? ""The bar was busy."" Yes, that was the response I received. I wrote it down. I took notes on all of this. An hour. Until this point, we have had only glass after glass of water. It's 9:30. Lunch was a looong time ago. My patience is thin. ""Can we have some bread and butter or something?"" I asked. ""Oh, something's coming out."" Mistake, the third. Something's coming out? After an hour of waiting, *something* is coming out? I should hope so. Like a man in prison of Biblical times, I ate biscuits and wine. And I was not happy about it. AT TEN PM, we received our first course. Mistake, the fourth (I am going to stop here. There's going to be a lot of these). Yes, an hour and a half after arriving, we finally start to eat something. Have you ever been so hungry that you lost your appetite? That's the point I was nearing. But, it was 10 pm, I figured I should eat someth...what is this? I waited all this time for LETTUCE? Yes, I waited an hour and a half to eat lettuce. Evidently, it was being hydroponically grown out back, hence the wait. No. Not at all. You don't make people wait an hour and a half for lettuce and expect them to be happy about it. Boeuf a la Bourguinonne? Sure. Salad in a bag? No.  Then, as if directed by Dale Earnhart Jr, every other course comes out at once at lightning fast speed and all together? Again, are you kidding? Have you heard of pace? Presentation? Why starve us only to serve everything at once? There's no room on the table for all the plates. Nothing is being explained or presented, just dropped off and left. That makes no sense. Whatever. At least I'll eat...what? What is this? Salty pasta? Fish with LEMON and PARSLEY? DRY CHICKEN??? What the h is this? THIS is innovation? THIS is culinary creativity? THIS took nearly (at this point ) TWO HOURS TO ARRIVE TO THE TABLE?? No.  If you mean to tell me that this is the BEST EFFORT of a restaurant that boasts 'whipped prairie fruit farm goat cheese on buttered croutons with arugula, and a chili, garlic and cured sardine vinaigrette' and 'Gunthrop farm duck breast with hominy, roasted garlic, snap peas, and remoulade', I will call you a liar. Because you will be lying to me. And, you will be insulting me. To appease the hunger of our group, we received a couple of more plates of pasta with cheese. Does that come with unlimited soup and salad, too? I didn't know Olive Garden had a Pilsen outpost. Oops. My mistake. OG is much cheaper...in price. My brunch experience was a revelation. From tamarind drink to orange cardamom donut to multi-layered bagel, each bite was a surprise. This food was an insult. Waiting so long for this food was an insult. Having one disinterested (or overwhelmed) server was an insult. Everything about this experience told me that Nightwood was not interested in my business or the business of my friends. It told me that rather than giving me a representative dining experience, it would give me polenta WITHOUT the oyster mushroom vinaigrette, small salad and poached egg. The food, service and lack of attention told me not to come back. And, have no doubt, I won't. I work hard. At times, I work long long hours. My time (MY time) is SO precious to me. To have that commodity taken from me needlessly and without care is entirely unacceptable and unforgivable. TFD.",-0.9338,0.829,0.076,0.095,0.4864983358934971
2010-06-15,4.0,"First, let's talk atmosphere. I'm a sucker for a rustic environs with soft candlelight and wood accents. Nightwood has that. Plus a very inviting patio. I sat in the basement which was very cozy. OK, I realize ""basement"" isn't very reflective of the vibe of the downstairs dining room. Reminds me of when I innocently said that my boyfriend was ""getting us a room"" for my birthday, which sounded very Motel 6 hourly rate, when it was actually a Hilton property. What can I say...I have a way with words. Second, let's talk menu. I immediately peruse any menu for vegetarian options (bonus if they are vegan). Nightwood has a respectable number of vegetarian options, several of them very unique. I'm sure they will leave off the sprinkle of cheese on salads and pastas if you ask them. They seemed rather accommodating.  Third, let's talk salad. Oh, how I adore a good salad. I ordered the option with candied walnuts, arugula and sheep's milk cheese. The salad would have been perfect but for the cheese, which was too strong of a flavor and the nuts/greens didn't balance out the sharpness. I would certainly order a different salad upon my return or just ask them to leave off the cheese. Dressing was tangy and delicious. Fourth, let's talk entreés. I had the pasta with vegetables. Pasta is made in house daily, according to our waitress and let me tell you, I dove right into that bowl of delicate ribbons with just the right amount of oil. I especially appreciated the asparagus, though that won't necessarily always be the in season vegetable, obviously. As someone who loves her vegetables more than her starch, I would have appreciated twice or three times the amount of vegetables to pasta, but that's just me. I'd probably order something different on the next visit. and now...let's talk *polenta* Oh my heavens! The. Best. Polenta. I have ever EVER had in my entire Italian life! I've been to Tuscany people, Nightwood's polenta is the (corn meal) bomb! They mix it with stinging nettle of all things. Now, I'm pretty experienced with vegetables but I never even heard of putting this prickly vegetation into food! I am sold! I want to *bathe* in that effing polenta. WOW. Dessert is typically my least favorite (and often skipped) part of the meal. I had a rhubarb cobbler topped with creme fraiche which was delicious, but I wasn't inspired to eat more than 1/3 of it (which my ""hips don't lie"" certainly appreciate, I'm certain).",0.9955,0.787,0.167,0.046,0.5317291455589328

A little salty but really good. Who knew peas with scrambled eggs would be good? Now YOU do! it came with their unique version of tots: a glob of shredded potatoes (like has browns) fried up as little balls. A work of art! It also came with toast that was thrown on the wood fire grill and served with a raspberry jam.  A few things I would change: since my meal was one big protein and carb fest I would have loved to see a fruit plate on the menu. I always feel better ordering such items as I had when I can get in some healthful fruit. I would also get rid of the iced tea. It was possibly the worst fresh brewed iced tea I have ever had.  The outdoor eating area is nice and cozy with a fire place in the center. Dont expect to sit and wathc the passersby because it is closed off from street view...hence the cozzyness!",0.9254,0.836,0.106,0.058,0.5695652173913043

We enjoyed the complementary bread and nice outdoor seating. For our appetizers we had the spring salad with raw ramps and raw asparagus. It was tasty, but intense. Definitely healthy, but not comfort food. We also tried the cold asparagus soup, which was simple and had a nice pickled asparagus. For entrees, we ate the two fishes of the day--whole trout and fried whitefish. The whitefish was much better than the trout, but both were fresh and flavorful. Dessert was 2 different kinds of gelatos (dark chocolate and bourbon vanilla) plus rhubarb sorbet. Very good on a hot night! Our server was attentive and courteous. We have no complaints about the restaurant and would go back for more healthy, delicious local seasonal food. We only wish it was open for lunch.",0.9897,0.704,0.248,0.048,0.6250698684032017

Our server (who was either vaguely British or feigning an accent) conspicuously ignored my hubs and me in favor of fawning over a table near us at which three older men were seated.  For the entire first hour, she blatantly ignored our polite hand gestures and other verbal attempts to get her attention. We considered just walking out. I'm not sure if she believed the other table would tip her higher or if she was just abiding by her own twisted version of a Jim Crow system, but no matter -- her offensive treatment was enough to keep us away for a very, very long time.  I'm giving 3 stars only because the food and drinks were still good. But as most people know, being treated rudely (worse, being completely ignored!) by one's server is enough to ruin any dining out experience, regardless of the quality of the food.",-0.8994,0.792,0.076,0.133,0.5439316239316239

The place looks amazing! Best design I've seen in ages. And the service is great. I love the idea of both these restaurants, but the menu and food are just not that inspired. I had pasta, and it was home-made. I know good hand-made pasta, but this is what you'd end up doing if you tried at home for the first time. It was heavy, gummy, too chewy, and sat in my gut like, well, a big pile of wheat flour. I had trouble finding something to order, because the plate combinations just didn't seem that appealing - a number of us agreed on this point (we were a large party.) Prices weren't too bad, but then, the food just ""wasn't too bad"" as well. Others had the trout - we found the nearly raw egg with fish thing verging on gross. Seasoning was erratic, some things under-salted, others over. Food seemed to tend toward heavy, rich dishes and flavors, with heavy-handed preparation and plating, and I just really wanted to find more chances throughout the meal to ""lighten up."" I get what they are going for - unpretentious slo-cal cuisine - but it needs work. I need to go back to really give it a proper chance. I love the idea of Nightwood! I want to like it.

2010-05-05,4.0,"I came here on a Tuesday night with 3 friends and I was pleasantly surprised to see it pretty packed - a good sign of things to come.  Ambiance/decor: A wonderfully located recessed bar is the center of the room. The huge windows on the facade of the restaurant really open up the space. The juxtaposition of traditional woodworking and the interesting light fixtures gives off a cool mix of rustic and nouveau. There is an outdoor seating area with a gas firepit which is probably really cool in the summer.  Drinks: An amazing wine list. My buddy and his wife picked up a 2009 Enamore - a Malbec blend from Renacer. A great choice! I of course had to peruse the beer list, which was quite extensive, and had a surprising selection of quality microbrews.   Food: The menu changes every day, and all the ingredients are from local farms. We ordered the ramps with ricotta cheese and mint, and smelts with aioli for appetizers. Oh ramp - where have you been all my life? It's as if spinach and garlic had a delicious love-child. The ricotta cheese was the highlight of the dish - perfectly paired with mint, we licked the plate clean. The smelts were kind of on the fishy side, and we were not all that impressed.  For entrees, we split the roasted half-chicken, the Wisconsin trout and the duck leg (all 3 of which are on the menu every day). We also had the vermicelli with clams. I'm so glad chicken is making it's way back to menus since it was my favorite dish. It was so tender - I'd put it somewhere between a baby's bottom and an earlobe.  It was served with soft cornbread cubes and dates which were really great when you ate everything together. The trout was delic as well - served with black beans, charred tomato and cilantro. It had a very smokey taste (which went great with our wine). I am not a huge fan of duck leg, but my 3 comrades really enjoyed it. It is served with asparagus and roasted fennel, both of which carry strong flavors and add to the boldness of the duck. The vermicelli was OK - nothing to write home to yelp about.  For dessert we had the 3 warm cookies which paired awesomely with the gelatto (mint, dark chocolate and bourbon vanilla). The bourbon vanilla was insane - I highly recommend it. All in all, a great place. Great service - the staff really understands the menu every day and make great recommendations.

The food was excellent (smelt appetizer, asparagus with goat cheese appetizer, and hand-ground, farm raised burgers), the buzz in the restaurant was comfy, the service was top notch, and the bartender gave us a great wine recommendation.  My dinner compadre and I were on a burger hunt, and we were way satisfied with this place, but I will be more adventurous upon my return--their menu was stacked with seasonal greatness!

2010-03-16,4.0,"I knew this place would be fun as soon as I saw buttons with their logo instead of cheap matchbooks at the entrance. I was also giddy from having only 4 hours of sleep, being out on a Monday night, and being in Pilsen, a neighborhood I don't go to often, but which contains some of the most fascinating history in Chicago.  Let's just say I was excited. The atmosphere of Nightwood is something I really liked. The decor is something like modern meets antique meets urban meets chic. Or something like that. I didn't like how voices travelled, which made it seem as if the large dinner party in the next room was actually right next to us, but no matter. I actually want to come back and try out their outdoor seating (or what looked like outdoor seating) because it looks very intimate and charming.  What i liked best and almost wish that we got were the bar-stool like seats that looked over the kitchen, so one could see the chefs at work and see exactly how your food is being prepared. Lovely. It's too bad I missed out, but i was happy where i was nonetheless.  I guess Nightwood is popular for making fresh, handwritten menus daily (perhaps weekly) using only what the local farms/grocers/what have you have in stock. Everything is fresh and organic, and very comforting.  My boyfriend, our friend, and I wanted to try an array of dishes, so we ordered 4 appetizers, 2 pasta dishes, and 2 entrees, all to share (in case you can't tell, we seem to eat a lot and enjoy doing so). In terms of appetizers, I wasn't fond of the deep fried smelts, but that's probably because I am not fond of fish. Moving on, I thought the fresh mozzarella with white beans and sardines was delicious; everything fit together perfectly and tasted lovely. The chicken liver pate with chips seemed like an odd combo, but in reality was amazing. The veal  served over the grilled baguette was also really tasty...and I didn't know I liked veal! But here, it seemed like I have liked it all my life, I gobbled it up with no regrets.  On to the pasta! We ordered the potato gnocchi with oyster mushrooms and sheep's milk cheese as well as the hand cut pasta with pine nuts, arugula pesto, and breadcrumbs. The gnocchi was very good in combination with the mushrooms and the vinaigrette- like sauce added a nice touch in terms of flavor. Now, i am a huge fan of gnocchi, so I was not disappointed, but the real winner was the hand cut pasta with pine nuts. The nuts added such a wonderful, crunchy and great burst of flavor to the pasta I just could not stop eating it. I could have totally ordered that as my entree and been entirely happy with it. Yum.  The entrees included were the red wine beef stew and polenta tart with a poached egg on top. The polenta had a beautiful presentation to it, and the spinach salad it came with tasted heavenly...it was very simple, but the taste left you wondering how it could be possible to put so much flavor into something that uses very little ingredients. The poached egg was perfectly done. So good. The beef stew was hearty and rich and made you feel like you were sitting in a wood cabin in front of a fireplace watching the snow fall outside, it was that comforting and good.  I didn't really care for the glazed carrots (they seemed hard and cut in big pieces that made the dish look awkward to me), but the beef....ohh the beef. I would go back just for that. By now I was sufficiently full and tired and ready for a long sleep, but we couldn't leave without dessert. I had the chocolate pudding which was dark and chocolatety and yummy and just plain good. My boyfriend and our friend got the sorbets and caramel bread pudding, respectively. I didn't try much of the bread pudding as i was too busy shoving pudding into my face, but i will say it was light and tasty and seemed to have a citrus like taste to it, but maybe that's just me. The sorbet I enjoyed most was the plum, very light and cleansing. YUM! I don't know why i had to go into so much detail about the food, as the menu will probably change in a few days time anyway. It doesn't matter. You need to know the goodness I had to know the goodness you will have. A gripe we had was that our server didn't seem to be all that engaged in what we were eating or trying to help us decide what to drink in the cocktail menu. Every time we declared how amazing something was, all he did was smile and nod and take our plates away. ah well, at least our dishes were coursed and paired together nicely, which made for a lovely, and very filling dinner!",0.9998,0.666,0.281,0.052,0.5327794486215539

It had 10 entrees and just about 90% of the items where over $20, the appetizers prices where crazy! Decor was nice the server we had was awesome we didnt feel like we where being rushed, we stayed until then end with 1 bottle of wine left to finish.

I was starved, so I went 12 year old boy on it and got the cheeseburger. MMmmmmm. And it was done properly, very adult. Mmm! My pals got the gnocchi and the pate appetizers - and they were both a good size to share. Pate and fig jam and gnocchi and chunks of bacon. Mmmmmm. Seriously, we couldn't stop yapping about how great everything was.  I went back to the bathroom to send a sext 'cos the food WAS sexy and saw my sexy reason to come back. The Chef Bar/Table in back!

This suited us fine though as the dim light complimented our slight hangovers nicely. We were also seated in a booth against the wall with real chairs as opposed to the backless benches supplying most of the room - another big plus. Watching the 80 year old grandmother try to slide and sit comfortable on a bench at the table next to us was enough for me to wonder again when people will come to their good senses and join me in a backless bench boycott. Anyhow, we all tried a different brunch special and all were rich, and delicious. I especially liked the short rib Benedict. One thing you absolutely MUST try are the butterscotch and bacon donuts. They are amazing. In fact, as good as are meals were, I would have been just as happy with a cup of coffee and a couple of those donuts! The only small (very small) complaint would be the toast that was all burnt, like black around the edges burnt but, everything else was great!

Menu changes and is handwritten daily. The chicken pate with homemade chips was delectable. The pesto dip with rustic bread mouthwatering. Spinach handmade pasta with bolognese, yes please! Wisconsin trout-done perfectly. The flavors were layered nicely and the dishes actually had complexity which is something I've found lacking lately. We had the warm cookies for dessert. They were tasty but could be skipped. The bad: Price points-seemingly somewhat random. Half chicken with cornbread $25? Rabbit with cabbage $30? It was a lovely meal so I was overall ok with the cost but found them just this side of high. The ugly: For us it was the service. Our waiter just could not read our table which I gots to tell ya, wasn't that hard. Having been industry generally when three women start off with a bottle of champagne and ask to keep the wine list they are probably going to relax AND order another bottle. Add three appetizers and them letting you know they are ""going to keep ordering""-hmm, yeah,  you probably shouldn't rush them. Plates were taken before we were asked if we were done, dishes were rushed, we had to ask a few times for our champagne to be brought back and poured (they were keeping it chilled at the bar), had to request dessert menu, etc, etc. It just unfortunately took away from an otherwise great dinner. Perhaps he was just off and it won't keep me from going again. But we all agreed we would have said something to the manager had he been available when we left. Worth it though.

I opted for the fried chicken and waffles-the chicken was crispy and juicy inside and the spices were just right.  The lemon cream complimented both the chicken and the waffles quite well; however, my compaints would be that the portion size lacked (4 small chicken wings, no drummies) and the waffles were already sweetened and a bit too sugary.  I was on a fried chicken hunt, and should have gone to Stanleys for complete Satisfaction. The bubs daringly chose the special of the day:  Sardines topped with bacon and 2 fried eggs.  For a man who used to hate sardines (changed his mind after our trip to southeast asia and hong kong as dried fish is a staple in every breakfast) he gulped his meal like a cool cat-meow....

On the day I was there, I had a mushroom soup which was ok to good. The taste was rich and creamy, yet the texture was watery for its intensity.  My entree though, proved that there is some hope in this city. It was a sandwich with porter mustard (Old Rasputin Imperial Porter I was told, which is one of my favorites), pulled pork loin, and a fried egg.  Fried egg seems cliche these days, but let me just say, in the same fashion as I said to our waiter, ""Despite your daily menu changes, serving this pork any other way would be a war crime.""  It was absolutely stellar.  The restaurant's ambiance, seats surround in the kitchen, and very cool looking outside area in the summer make it a winner.  Shitty location, but I don't mind trekking to enjoy it.",0.8747,0.819,0.122,0.059,0.4522916666666667

2010-02-03,5.0,"I've been looking forward to trying Nightwood since it opened and I heard great things about it from Scott M, who wrote the first review of Nightwood on Yelp.  I finally went last night to meet Scott and his brother for dinner. The atmosphere is fantastic, it's obvious the owner put considerable planning into the restaurant (three years, according to Scott!). The dining room chairs in particular impressed me, they seem to be Eames-inspired, covered with leather and they are very comfortable. I hoped that, as is so infrequently the case, the owner put as much effort into the food as the eye candy.  I had a Nightwood Old-Fashioned at the bar while I waited for Scott and David. The drink was mixed perfectly and speedily, with fresh ice and maraschino cherries that were obviously a cut or two above your typical bar cherries. The host (who I gathered is the owner) and the bartender were both very accommodating and friendly. My friends arrived and we sat down for dinner, and ordered a couple of appetizers, a creamy fresh mozzarella and fruit compote dish, almost like a bruschetta, and pork and fig ravioli. Both were as good as they were unusual. The ravioli was cooked perfectly. There were some tough entree choices on the menu, but I decided to order the cheeseburger. In retrospect it may have been a cop-out moment, but I don't regret it a bit. The burger was obviously made from very fresh, high quality beef, and cooked to perfection. There was definitely a smoky flavor, but it did not overwhelm any of the other flavors. The bun was a ciabatta-like roll. In short, it was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had, way better than the one I had at Bad Apple last week. And when you take away the novelty of the burgers at Kuma's, I believe the Nightwood burger blows Kuma's away. Of course, if you want a burger topped with pulled pork and bacon, you're going to have to go to Kuma's! But judged on the quality of the burger itself, I believe Nightwood has Kuma's beat. The fries were excellent as well, obviously hand-cut and crispy. Nightwood also has a nice beer list and an extensive wine selection. I had a Tripel Karmeliet and a nice Cabernet Sauvignon that complimented the burger well. Overall, I was incredibly impressed by the entire experience. I look forward to going back and being more adventurous with the menu (which changes daily, by the way).

MT: ""Yeah, but I will be gone soon and you'll still be on this boring date."" He was right.  He was also delicious.  The tangy risotto perfectly complemented the fish. Soon all that remained of my aquatic friend was a skeleton. At this point any normal person would have yelled for the check. But, I happen to be cursed with a sweet tooth.  The butterscotch tart with its light creamy filling and a caramelized pear was almost worth extending the torture.

Main course pasta dish was unforgivably salty.  Borderline inedible.  For the cost ($22!) i would expect more.  It was mostly pasta and salt.  Food cost must be in the 10% range on this item.  I had some serious belly aches after the meal, which I am attributing to the not-particularly-cooked onions in this dish.

My first taste, of my first (and as of yet only) visit to Nightwood, and it was one of those tastes that you just want to keep going and going in your mouth. I've said it before, I'm a sucker for donuts. Correction: I'm a sucker for FRESH donuts. I don't generally bother with donuts unless they're fresh, it just seems like a waste of time, taste and calories otherwise. This was not just a fresh donut, though, this was the BEST fresh donut I've had in recent memory. I will be back for the donuts alone, however, the entree I had was amazingly tasty as well; a somewhat unusual, though not that different of a take on eggs benedict. Fresh english muffins topped with spicy cabbage, perfectly poached eggs with the yolks still runny and hollandaise drizzled on top. There was also a strangely large amount of fresh frissee lettuce on top, just under the hollandaise, obscuring most of the other elements on the plate. I suppose I should have been thankful for a little fresh, uncooked green addition to my brunch, which is somewhat of a rarity, and I think it would have been a good idea perhaps, if only the amount had been a bit smaller, and the leaves themselves had been cut down into more manageably-edible sized pieces. Overall, it was still really good eggs benedict In addition to the eggs benedict part of the eggs benedict, you also get ""tots"", which are like a tater tot but 20 times better, or a round, extra crispy mini latke ball. Rejoice: now you can order tater tots as part of your breakfast without regret. One last thing I must mention which was absolutely wonderful is that on a Sunday, at around 12:30, my friend and I were able to sit down for brunch in Chicago without waiting. With such good food on offer, and a lovely seating area too, I couldn't help but wonder what was wrong with this picture, but me and my hunger happily accepted not having to wait. Another last, last thing: I had planned another trip to Nightwood for brunch on Saturday the week after my first visit, but sadly learned that they only have brunch on Sunday.

The look and feel of this place is pretty sweet. Trendy and sophisticated Nightwood is split into two floors with the downstairs being sort of dungeon-like. 2. Fresh food. The food is bought and prepared daily.  3. Staff. The staff is Friendly, nice, and helpful. Cons: 1. Food. The food just wasn't that good. The pasta dish I ordered was bland and didn't have much taste.  I was extremely hungry and only ate half of the dish. Frankly, I just got bored of eating it. When my pasta dish costs $26, I expect it to taste pretty good. The appetizers we ordered were decent but significantly over priced ($10+). Also, we also showed up a little later in the night around 9 on a Saturday (all reservation time slots beforehand were taken) and couldn't order many of the dishes including any of the soups because they ran out of ingredients.  Overall, I left this place dissatisfied. For two people our bill which included appetizers, entrees and no alcohol was ~ $100.

2009-12-04,4.0,"Finally, I made it.  Dinner at Nightwood to celebrate the dawn of December: 12/1/09. Ok, not really, just a random dinner spot... Date's review: ""The lettuce is beautiful."" (he's an expert in concise foliage appraisal). And, I concur. The lettuce is truly beautiful. Ordering a salad would be beneficial to overall meal appreciation and health. There are several to choose from...simple, yet satisfying.  My review:  Neighborhood: Love. East Pilsen is still somewhat untraveled (by the North side masses), and this cozy nook just north of Cermak (and Skylark!) on Halsted is a ""blink and you'll miss it"" sort of situation, which of course...is why I like it, and why I could get a pretty good table (corner/window) without a reservation on a random Tuesday night.  Had it not been dipping below 40 degrees, the fireplace flickering the patio seating may have been an amiable option, but alas...winter has arrived and inside warmth was necessary. Quickly situated with menus (oh, handwritten? nice touch), water (still or sparkling, both complimentary) and an above average wine/beer/cocktail list...our server was both congenial and well-versed in what the restaurant offered and what might be good to try. Indeed, ma'am! Locally focused, sustainable menu has prices a little above average, but the quality and consistency of the food is evident, and much worth it. IN addition, the service and atmosphere is worth some dime all in itself... Glasses of: Zin + Pinot Noir in the correct glasses, at the correct temperature, from the correct vineyards. (I said we were celebrating winter!) Buttermilk biscuits with honey butter. Aforementioned Salad Whitefish with root vegetables for me: Excellent.  Pasta with lamb confit for the salad spinner. I would most definitely go back...perfect for a date, or a group of friends (make a reservation). Excellent cocktail list (they were out of ginger syrup for the hot toddy), beer list is extensive and local, and of course...the wine left me feeling warm and happy, thus doing its job very well.

The six of us arrived  to find a very attractive dining room and bar with exposed brick and nicely spaced tables. Everyone appeared content in their conversation, food and drink. I felt warmly welcomed by an inviting atmosphere. But oh no, this was not to be our ambiance...we were escorted to our table in the basement cellar, a windowless dungeon with exposed brick bouncing the high spirited conversations around to an aggregated decibel level that obviated any attempt at less-than-shouting talk. I have never been in so loud avrestaurant in my life, and I've eaten in many places that test my aural tolerances.  But we are family so shouting is not entirely foreign to us. The menu was an especially toothsome read and we all found easy choices. The presentation matched the menu and compelled us to dig in. We all took our first bites and came up with a sad realization that the kitchen took a heavy hand with salt. And we are not salt-sensitive folks.

The knives they give you to cut meat are TOTALLY INADEQUATE! Here's the deal. Nightwood serves family farm-raised, organic beet-and-arugula-fed, designer-shod, psychologically, ecologically, physiologically and emotionally well-balanced meat that was sensitively slaughtered, like, this morning. This meat is expensive and flavorful, but because it is so fresh it has a weird, tough, kinda rubbery texture. It doesn't fall off the bone. You gotta saw that sh*t if you want to consume it. This is where the knives come in. They have these super fancy white enameled French knives that cost an arm and a leg at Williams and Sonoma, but despite their beauty they suck suck suck. So you're there, attacking your meat, hacking away at it like some kind of deranged serial killer, because the g-damn unserrated knives are too busy being tres cute to actually cut anything. Nightwood deserves more than one star, because the atmosphere is very nice and much of their food (I'm thinking of the trout, and all the fabulous veggie sides) is wonderful. But they need new knives and they need to figure out how to cook their chicken so that the meat falls off the bones like it's supposed to.

After about a short wait at the bar, we were seated.  Really dig the seats and this place, very cool looking and comfortable.  For the appetizers we had the Agnolotti with sardines and this cheese that was out of this world, it was like mozzarella with creme injected into the middle of it. For my entree, I was a bit disappointed.  I ordered the pork, after the waiter told me it was the last one left.  Now I really like cured pork and ham and other pork like this, but usually when I order a pork roast, it's always almost too fatty, and sure enough here it was also.  Even the center, which was surrounded by a gelatin-like layer of fat, seemed a bit fatty.  Maybe it is just be me though, since everyone else seemed to like it.  Despite not liking the texture, the flavor was very good, tasted a bit like a honey-baked ham, the sauce and the cabbage that were surrounding it were also very good, I just didn't care for the texture. For dessert had the chocolate pudding with this sort of whipped cherry flavored topping with pieces of chocolate in it.  The pudding itself was very thick and chocolately, highly recommend this if you like pudding and it's on the menu when you visit.

Now, for the goodies. I loved this place. We were here to celebrate a friend's birthday, and they emailed us the menu for the night. I don't know if they do that for everyone, or if it was a request my friend made, but it was a nice touch.

(I do want to go back so that I can enjoy the outdoor space-it looked like a nice place to hang out and have a couple of drinks.)  We started with the pate, the fried mozzarella and the gnocchi. The pate was good! Even people that were scared to eat it enjoyed it. As for the friend mozzarella, I think the general concensus was that the greens that they served with it were better than the actual cheese...though who can pass up fried cheese? The gnocchi was delicious, but I am partial to homemade pasta. It is a little denser, but it's so good!  For the entrees, we had some burgers (delish-the ciabatta bread was a little too thick but they came with really good condiments and the meat was nicely seasoned), the rigatoni with fried chicken mushroom (which are actually a particular kind of mushroom... and are not fried mushrooms, or fried chicken bits in the pasta with mushrooms), the spaghetti with an over easy egg and short ribs, and the whitefish. Everyone really enjoyed their meals....I think the rigatoni was a little dense, but that is the whole homemade pasta thing.  We were all stuffed and didn't order dessert, but then they surprised us with a plate of their warm cookies and a candle for my friend! Yay! I love when people do this!

I will definitely make a trip here for dinner.",0.9791,0.667,0.267,0.067,0.6844444444444445
2009-10-10,4.0,"Apparently this is the new place to go and I have been wanting to try it for some time now. It is a little out of the way, being all the way in Pilsen, but boy am I glad we went there!  You walk into the restaurant through this cute outdoor patio... I will have to go back when it is nice weather again (ugh, probably another 9 months!) and enjoy that lovely space. I walked in and immediately loved the decor with the exposed brick walls and the exquisite ceilings. Very cute and nicely decorated, but not in a pretentious or trendy way. (I didn't feel out of place in my Friday casual work clothes.) It is definitely more upscale than Lula but still the similar comfortable feeling.  We got there right after work and it was not that busy at all - maybe half of all the tables were full. They tried to put us at the bar at first saying all the tables were reserved. We were a bit upset as we just called about 1 hour before and they said that walking in wouldn't be a problem as they never reserve out all their tables... plus it was only 6:30 so it was still early. So we ended up getting a table which was really good b/c I don't think I would have enjoyed the dinner quite as much at the bar.  Instead of regular bread, they brought out these honey biscuits which were quite tasty! For an appetizer, we started with a butternut squash ravioli with egg yolk. It was good, a little interesting on the flavors, but still good. It reminded us of the stuff they would make on Top Chef. It was one (bigger than average size) ravioli which I thought was kind of skimpy since it was almost $10! For my entree I ordered the grilled duck. OMG! SOOOO good... the duck was tender and juicy and perfectly seasoned! I also liked how they had the skin on (not everyone would like that), since that is my favorite! The salad on the side with corn and apples was just okay but really, the duck made my night! It was delicious! My boyfriend wasn't super hungry so he just ordered the goat cheese gnocchi. That was good in flavor but nothing as impressive as the duck. He usually does not like duck but also thought my entree was excellent!  I will have to say that the menu is pretty limited. There are probably about 10 entree choices and I would only eat about 3-4 of them. And really, only the duck one stood out to me as looking really good. But I bet the menu changes pretty frequently so hopefully when I go back there will be some other dishes available. (Although I may just want to go back for the duck.) All the ingredients were really fresh and I think since it is Lula's same owners it is probably all organic. The service was good, as well. I also got a small dessert... one scoop of the blueberry-pear sorbet, which was the perfect amount to end the night with. I am not a huge dessert person and usually nothing really appeals to me. As far as the cocktail menu, nothing jumped out at me too much but I opted for an apple cider cocktail which was just okay. I pretty much enjoyed Nightwood for the Duck Entree and the atmosphere. I would recommend making the trek out there and checking it out!",0.9994,0.74,0.235,0.025,0.5924780174780176

What I enjoy about this place- and Lula too- is the attention to detail. Detail that foodies are sure to find reassuring. The seasonal menu is comprised of many local offerings, and they pair very well with the wine offerings. The preparation is exact without being fastidious or over bearing. The same with the service and the surrounding. It is enjoyable and slick without being pretentious. And like Lula they employ some tres sexy cooks. I dined here last week with two friends and we made our own sampling menu. Starting with two salads- one of which was poblano peppers and bacon, another starter of duck confit raviolis and rabbit entre. All were carefully executed and presented. The server too was more than willing to make thoughtful suggestions on the menu and wine pairings. In short I cannot wait to return!",0.9895,0.804,0.196,0.0,0.4835978835978836
2009-10-05,4.0,"Pretty good food but in my opinion, didn't live up to the hype. Based on the reviews and the lines outside we've been wanting to come here for some time.  We called and got in early on Saturday night.  Once we found the door (hint: it's on the North side and you have to walk through the patio), we were quickly seated in the ""window corner"". For appetizers we had the duck ravioli and fried green tomatoes.  Both were excellent.  As an appetizer, I got the ""vietnamese sandwich"" (pate, shredded meatballs, veggies on a french roll).  A very good sandwich, but ultimately more bar food than an entree in a fine dining restaurant.  My girlfriend got the trout and she enjoyed it, but it wasn't life-changing. We finished up with the warm apple cake and sorbet/gelato combo.  The apple cake was EXCELLENT.  The best dish of the meal.  The sorbet and gelato's were just OK.  The vanilla bean gelato just tasted like vanilla ice cream. All in all a good meal, but didn't live up to the hype.  That said, I'm not sure that the restaurant itself has made it out to be anything more than what it is.  Therefore, the 4th star.

2009-09-22,4.0,"9 pm on a Friday night. The restaurant is bustling and there's nary a seat in the house. Luckily I was able to squeeze in at the one available table on the patio because my party had 3 and not 2. Is this a first or what? I loved the whole layout of the restaurant with the dining room straddling the corner allowing for great window views onto the neighborhood, a wraparound counter overlooking the open kitchen, and the patio which though strikingly modern offered warmth with its deep woods and lighting. The cocktail menu is worth checking out for some fairly innovative options, and the wine menu was impressive as well. I had high expectations for the cuisine being a fan of Lula and for the most part the menu did not disappoint. With the focus on sustainability, the menu changes daily. By the time my group rolled around for dinner they were out of a few menu items I was hoping to try, but our friendly waitress did make some great recommendations. Ravioli with goat cheese and honey in a light pesto sauce was divine. The pasta was so fresh and just a little al dente. A gnocchi with tomatillo sauce was good but not as spectacular as the first appetizer. Still hungry for more we tried the chicken pate which was like velvet. Should I say that this liver was better than my Grandmother's? It was and was accompanied by sliced cucumbers and a garnish of dill, onion salad. Entree choices were tough. Everything sounded wonderful. What wouldn't I recommend? The burger. Our waitress said it's one of the best in the city, and if you're putting a burger on the menu at a place like this it better be good. My 2 dining companions ordered it and were underwhelmed. Apparently there was an overpowering cheese/mayonnaise on it they weren't wild about. I opted for the rabbit entree because its not something I'd make at home. The meat was tender and though I loved the originality of pairing brussel sprouts with olives and grapes, the olives were overpowering. Will I go back? Most definitely. I'm practically foaming at the mouth to sit at the kitchen at watch the goings on. I'm looking forward to seeing the changes with the menu as we move into fall and I'm sure they're bound to delight.",0.9981,0.777,0.213,0.01,0.5496805555555556
2009-09-17,3.0,"*WARNING: the content of this review makes mention of the butchering of animals, in particular- furry, fuzzy ones.  If you are squeamish and/or have a soft spot in your heart for such cute cuddly animals, you may not appreciate this review.* Now, I have learned my lesson. Don't order rabbit at any restaurant unless my wife says up front that she knows, for a fact, that they do it the right way. You see, rabbit is quite difficult to cook (when done on the bone, as a whole or a half).  For that reason, I have a hard time faulting Nightwood for their rabbit.  It wasn't that it was totally bad since parts of it in fact were quite good.  They seemed to pay particular attention to the skin of the rabbit.  So much so that the skin flap that stays on the beast itself  that is a part of the belly (but is split open in order to gut said beast) was folded over to the side during cooking to form this very nice, crisp bacon-like piece that was delicious. Did I just mention rabbit bacon? Did I just use the word ""beast"" to describe rabbit? The problem with it, like at so many other places where I have had rabbit before is that it was not cooked perfectly.  Once again, rabbit is a very challenging meat to cook, but I guess I had high expectations for Nightwood thinking that they would never put something like it on their menu without being able to master it. The meat was not cooked down enough and at some parts was quite dry.  Otherwise, the flavors were very well put together.  Coupled with a delicious sauce, roasted brussels sprouts, red grapes and olives, this dish was well composed despite the not so perfect execution of cooking the rabbit half. Bunnies are supposed to be soft (fork tender), not tough! The rest of the meal was pretty nice.  We also ordered ricotta gnocchi that was terrific- the highlight of the meal.  The chicken liver pate had this incredibly strong flavor.  It reminded me of liverwurst (usually made of pork liver).  It wasn't that it was bad, just very strong and hard to take down as an appetizer.  Just not something that I expected (the strength of the flavor that is).  The pickled onions and cucumber was a good way to cut the rich flavor- but in the end the pate itself was a bit too over powering. For dessert we ordered the cookie assortment.  These cookies were quite good, but to get four small cookies for $7, I felt a bit let down. Some other things that I really appreciate about Nightwood: - They have an extensive wine list, including quite a few nice selections by the glass. - Their menu changes daily which is usually a good sign of freshness and quality. - Their ingredients, in particular their animal proteins (meat- OK?) all came from well respected farms. - Interesting menu items that included a lot of variety. - For someone who doesn't always want to drink alcohol with his meal, offering a non-alcoholic cocktail for a very reasonable price was a welcome site (though tonight I ordered a nice syrah/granach from Washington state). I guess over all having experienced quite a few of these ""new American"" casual, yet stylish restaurants, Nightwood left some things to be desired.  I hold this concept of food in high regards and when it doesn't come out near perfect (like I have had at Blue 13, Naha, and MK to name a few) I guess I leave a bit disappointed.   That is not to say that this place should be ignored.  I love the fact that they opened up this side of town- at basically the cross roads of Chinatown, Bridgeport, and Pilsen.  The space itself is warm and inviting, and over all, the concept is a good one. Just remember this though.  If you find yourself leaving Nightwood the way I did tonight- feeling a bit underwhelmed (then again can anyone ever be ""whelmed""?)- walk due south on Halsted to Skylark and get yourself a pint of a good beer and some tater tots.  Somehow that was the perfect ""last course"" to an otherwise almost forgettable meal.",0.9977,0.775,0.16,0.065,0.5502411873840446

At this point we cracked into the wine list with a Cotes du Rhone which was cheap, subtle and pretty damn good, especially for $34 bucks. The whole mess was great, totally lovely perfectly cooked and spot on. Third course: dark chocolate tart with raspberry goo, dusted with coco powder and finished with a dollop of creme anglaise. We rocked out of there around 11PM with smiles on our faces a bill for about $175 (20% tip inclusive) paid for and that perfect feeling of satiated but, not stuffed....

We even got a taste of the rabbit tortellini in jalepeno broth, which might have been my favorite dish of the night. It was all really so yummy, and so worth it, considering just average restaurants are charging the same prices for food that is not nearly as thoughtful or well-prepared. Oh, I almost forgot--dessert was great too--we had 2 scoops of house made ice cream (a salted butterscotch gelato and a rasberry sorbet). The rasberry really captured the essence of fresh rasberries and wasn't too sweet. The salted butterscotch was great too.

Get with the program, Hemingway, this season it's all about clear, concise gushfests... especially if we're talking about my new paramour, Nightwood!!  Easily one of my new favorite restaurants in 2009 and here's why:  1. Love the location; off the beaten path in Pilsen it enlightens one to a new neighborhood with a ton of culture and fun things to see. Plus it's easy to do without a reservation (though one shouldn't to be safe) if you're feeling adventurous and up for a little road trip.  2. Great menu that revolves nightly. Never the same show twice, folks! Only the freshest, lushest and most decadent ingredients are here on display... if you can catch it, I highly recommend the pappardelle with braised rabbit and swiss chard as well as the spit-roast pork loin with creme fraiche and white anchovy. Holy Bazookas! That pork loin was enough to feed a small army and in the best of culinary style. We drooled, we tore into it, we conquered!! It was absolutely a meal for the record books.  3. Fabulous patio dining. While the weather still permits, I can't stress it enough.. it's absolutely luxurious! No haphazard street side folding chairs here. Nah.. the patio is stylish, sumptuous and the consummate setting for a romantic evening spent fawning over velvety chilled sweet corn gazpacho (with serrano chiles!) and the most fabulous 'Michigan' salad with sweet nectarines, salty mustard greens and creamy, smooth ricotta.  4. An equally matched beautiful interior. The folks of Lula Cafe has one-upped them hipselves at Nightwood. It's gorge! Especially love the open air kitchen with marble seat-and-eat bar... watch the chefs at work, or just wink at 'em as you pass by. Lots of eye candy among this staff!  5.

2009-09-01,2.0,"Utter Disappointment. Being a huge fan of Lula I was stupidly excited to try out Nightwood...only to be let down.  Let's start with the decor. The patio seating looks like a outdoor japanese business savvy cafeteria. Inside...is fully lined with wood!-No way. The place does have a gorgeous bar though. I have mixed feelings about the ambiance of this place.  I took my boyfriend here for his birthday about a month ago and we were both originally very excited as I stated earlier. We got there on a warm day and after 5 minutes he had to hand me his suit jacket because it was freezing inside. I understand that they want to keep it cool on these hot days, but really? make me cover up my adorable new dress with an over sized coat, really? This all makes me very bitter, but I digress... The beer selection is pretty good. Can never go wrong with anything by Two Brothers and Great Lakes.  Instead of bread we got TWO (as in one per person) biscuits. They were dry and lacking every element that a biscuit should have. Plus, they were the size of quarters. Yeah, sounds satisfying? I got the chicken, which is also on Lula's menu and it was great. The boyfriend got some sort of pasta dish that I can hardly remember because it didn't stand out in the slightest. Prices seemed average, but I honestly didn't feel as though I was getting my money's worth.  Service was very mediocre. I understand it's an opening of a new restaurant, but our waitress seemed really clueless and showed up at the table at all the wrong times.  Overall, I probably won't go back here.

2009-08-27,4.0,"Had dinner here tonight, and I have to say I am thoroughly impressed.  The dishes are all very seasonal and organic, so I would anticipate that the menu changes regularly.  According to our gracious dinner host who is also friends with the owners, this is owned by the same couple that owns Lula Cafe in our 'hood, Logan Square.  That being said, we had high expectations, and quite honestly those expectations were exceeded.  We started out splitting some appetizers for the table which included onion rings with some kind of tasty cream sauce, and chicken liver pate.  I also had a watermelon-tomato-mozzarella-bacon salad while my wife ordered a nectarine salad.  We also had a very satisfying heirloom tomato and mozzarella soup. For my entree, I ordered the wood-grilled whole trout (which was excellent) and also sampled the spaghetti with lobster as well as the steak.  Everything was very flavorful and well-prepared.  I didn't have a chance to review the wine list as our host selected the wines, but we had an excellent Zin from Mendocino County, a crisp Gruner Veltliner from Austria, and a delicate sparkling Rose from France.  Judging from the quality of the wines we enjoyed, I would assume that the rest of the wine list was also of equal caliber. For dessert, we split a chocolate gelato as well as a salted butterscotch gelato, and also had a sampling of a super-rich chocolate cake.  Again, the quality of the desserts was on par with the rest of our meal.   As for service, our waiter was very friendly and very attentive and seemed to have a very good grasp of the menu.  We are definitely returning, and will likely try to get a seat by the kitchen.",0.9898,0.857,0.139,0.005,0.6799386845039017
2009-08-27,1.0,"This is my 1st restaurant review. My dining experience @ Nightwood was so 'strong' that I felt that I had to write a review, and write it as soon as I returned from this dining experience. Let's start w/ the positive: The restaurant itself is quite lovely - very old school chicago (exposed brick walls, hardwood floors, tray/tin ceiling): hip but not pretentious, great light (from gorgeous fixtures and great huge windows in the front room where we were sitting), good looking bar, loved the music (80s/90s 'Pretty in Pink'), The whole environment was friendly and welcoming, really liked the crowd (all ages, but didn't see any kids - it was a school night).  Our party didn't arrive 'til nearly 40 min after our reservation time (crazy rush hour traffic); but not worries - the staff was wonderful, understanding, we had drinks in the walled terrace til everyone arrived and our table was waiting. Now for the not-so-good: the food. The appetizers were fussy and not that tasty. W/ the exception of the Rabbit Pate (yumm!). The entrees, spec. the cheeseburger, and chicken were abysmal. The chicken was undercooked/veggies burned, the cheeseburger was a soggy mess on a stale huge bun that was as hard as a rock, the fries - tasteless mush. Wine by the glass was actually a glass filled 1/4 full - for $13! And I don't get the wine list at all - very little that was actually interesting (way too trendy). Dessert was equally dissapointing - tasteless glop (the torte), a tiny scoop of ice cream. The rasberry/lemon tart was just okay. For some reason, even though Chi-town is having an unusually cool August, the air conditioner was on full frigid blow AND they had fans blowing. At every table most people ate w/ their coats on (I'm not exaggerating), my husband was kind enough to run to the car for a blanket for my legs - and I had long pants on. At the end our party of 6 spent more than $100 each. Yep $600+ not inc. the mandatory 20% tip. For the 1st time ever, I left a restaurant hungry. We had to stop at a drive thru on the way home. Nearly every review I've read @ Nightwood has been positive. I don't know what went wrong: an off night, the stars were misaligned?

NOTE:  The entrance is on the left through the patio.  The building was designed with a corner entrance, which makes sense given the location.  For some reason, they walled in the corner entrance, so folks who approach the building at the apparent entrance point have to turn around and walk back to the actual entrance.  Remarkably, I saw at least 20 people make this turn during the 1.5 hours I spent at the restaurant, so it's a fairly substantial design flaw that probably should be addressed with signage.",0.9514,0.91,0.09,0.0,0.6014285714285714

More bread was provided promptly upon our request.  The pate was creamy and fresh; nicely cut with the vinegary side things.  For dinner my friend had ribbon pasta with duck and broccoli.  The pasta was perfectly al dente and the long ribbons were very pretty on the plate.  The duck was tender and just enough to provide some heft to the dish without being too filling or overwhelming.  I had smoked trout on a bed of sweet corn with bacon (bits).  Probably the better of the two dishes.  The dish does not look super impressive -- its a whole trout with the skin on a bed corn basically -- however, incredibly delicious!   Mildly smoky, tender and juicy trout which pulled away easily from the skin with no bones.  The corn had been cut from the cob and was bright, sweet and a perfect compliment to the fish.  Bacon punctuated the smoky theme.    Oh, and the bottle of wine we wanted was out so they upgraded us to something better at no extra charge.  Nice.  We shared chocolate pudding for desert which was more like a dense cake.  Not bad but I would probably order a different desert next time.  And I hope to have many next times!",0.998,0.645,0.285,0.07,0.6491228070175439

The pasta itself couldn't have been made fresh because it was very under cooked and I wouldn't even dare call it al dente. After hearing a few good reviews from people who went, I thought it couldn't miss.  IT missed and then some.  Save your money and go down the street to Simone's or get some taters at Skylark....",0.9871,0.767,0.183,0.05,0.652480359147026
2009-08-17,2.0,"We had high hopes for this place from the reviews we read and the experience we had at Lula but sadly Nightwood didn't do much but disappoint on almost every level. We arrived on a Friday evening and asked to sit outside on the covered patio.  The tables along the north wall are a bit strange in that the booth seat, i.e. 4x4 rail road ties, sits about 2 inches higher than the chairs on the opposite side of the table.  That was a bit strange so we asked to move, hostess said no but more on her later.  Once our server arrived, she more than graciously moved us to a different spot even though it wasn't in her section.  Now we both are sitting on rail road ties, awesome, but at least we are eye to eye.  At $20+ an entrée a seat cushion would be nice. As expected they have a fairly comprehensive and reasonably priced wine menu, they also have a good variety of craft beers and cocktails.  We had a bottle of wine and Gin cocktail.  I saved my cocktail because we are working on striping the paint off some concrete pillars in our loft and I thought it might work for that. According to their website and our server the menu changes regularly and turns over about 20% or so on a daily basis.  We both really enjoy that idea, however, that creates a limited amount of options on the menu which we normally don't mind but in this case we had difficulty choosing appetizers and entrees that didn't contain the same or similar ingredients.  That was particularly an issue for the protein portion of the dishes. We ordered a variety of appetizers which all sounded interesting on the menu but for the most part fell short although full of potential.  The White Cucumber and Pickled Trout Salad was by far the best dish we tasted all night.  It was light, had excellent flavor and we really enjoyed the different take on a more traditional herring salad.  The Rock Fruit Salad which had the freshest fruit we have had in a while was totally ruined by what essentially was a ranch dressing.  The menu described a ricotta something or other but for all intensive purposes it looked and tasted like ranch, a good ranch but ranch all the same.  The Rabbit Tortellini in a Spicy Broth really shouldn't even be served and I don't know how that made it on the menu.  The rabbit had excellent flavor, however, the tortellini was tough even by the most ardent al dente standards and the broth was neither spicy nor had any flavor at all.  The first course intentions were excellent but the execution fell well short of tasty. It was around this point in the meal that every time someone came into the restaurant to ask how long the wait was the hostess would pause, blatantly stare at us and then give her answer as if we were the reason other people weren't being seated.  I've worked in restaurants plenty enough to know you have to be aware of where people are at in meal but there are tactful ways of doing that.  Doing so every two minutes and when someone has half a bottle of wine left and hasn't received their entrees is probably a bit premature. Now lets talk about those entrees.  There were some interesting choices last Friday but we ended up going with the White Cheddar Fondue Burger and the Smoked Trout BLT.  The burger was cooked just as ordered medium rare, the white cheddar was awesome but for some reason the kitchen puts yellow mustard on it and a lot of it.  Sort of a buzzkill for sure and something I will never understand, at a minimum that should be listed in the description on the menu because we would have ordered it on the side.  The BLT was an interesting concept for sure but again the execution really fell short.  The only smoked flavor I tasted was from the bacon which really needed to be cooked longer, there is nothing worse than uncrispy bacon on a BLT.  The trout was essentially a trout salad, heavy on the mayo, which I wasn't expecting at all.  It was extremely rich and tasty for a bite or two but a little over the top as a meal.  Aside from the uncrispy bacon and Mayo O.D. it was interesting.  The sunnyside up egg on top was a nice touch and countered the richness of the trout salad. For dessert we ended up with the Homemade Frozen Yogurt which was awesome and a blueberry something which was good but extremely overpriced at $10.  It tasted like Betty Crocker blueberry muffin mix, which I like, and was topped with a cheese cake style cream.  Tasty but has nothing on the desserts we have had a Lula. It is hard to say if we will ever be back but at this point I would have to say no.  If we did, I think I would definitely sit in the kitchen seats so I can see what everything looks like before I order it considering the description on the menu didn't really translate into flavorful dishes on the table as we expected.   Nightwood, might need a Cialis or something",0.999,0.821,0.147,0.032,0.48220171736476086

I had a tiny problem with the hostess because I had read on citysearch that they did not take reservations and I had also read that on their website but when we got to the place they asked if we had any...so I told them what I had read and why I didn't make any and they said they had just changed that and it had been updated on the web but since I just had seen it a couple of hours ago..I was like ok whatever, can we get a table and it was early and it was honestly fairly empty...what's the big deal, right?

2009-07-16,4.0,"Hurrah for Nightwood! I've always loved the Lula, and so I've been excited to try Nightwood, especially as it is a quick trip from downtown, making it a good option for an after-work dinner.  DH and I arrived around 7:00 on a recent week night. There was no wait for the outdoor patio, so we took advantage of that. I would warn you that some of the patio chairs have backs, and some are more of the tree-stump stool variety. We had the latter, and DH's back hurt by the end of dinner. Other than that, we were very pleased with the patio, which is covered by a roof that has clever skylights to let in some light, but not to overwhelm you with intense summer sun. (Also means that you could eat out there in a light rain too.) (The interior of the restaurant also looked very cool, but we didn't spend any time inside.) The place was really filling up by about 8:00, even on a weekday, so go early because they don't take reservations! (And, if I may be allowed to digress for a moment: why not?? If you want to service walk-ins as well, limit the number of reservations you take, but please, please permit me to make a reservation!)  The dining experience itself was top-notch. Our server - apparently Vivian Y's maligned ""faux hawk""- sporting server - was attentive in an unobtrusive way. All other aspects of service, including the wait time for food, etc., was well-executed. No complaints there. The food was a glory of simplicity and fresh ingredients. I hesitated to tell you too much because by the time you go, the menu will have changed. (I experienced great disappointment at having missed the fried asparagus described by others in prior reviews.) But I will say that the fried fresh mozzarella with bacon and apricot -- bacon works with nearly everything! -- was a particular highlight, as was DH's spaghetti with bolognese. As I said before, all the preparations were fairly simple. The flavors are straightforward -- no competition between discordant elements in your mouth -- and so you could really taste what the food was supposed to taste like. Quite refreshing! For dessert, we opted for the cookie plate. I wished that we could have eaten a whole bunch of the almond cookies, which are so much better fresh from the oven! The drinks were also quite good. I sampled one of the house cocktails, which was made with fresh juice and went down smoothly. DH is an avowed hop-head, and he approved of the beer list, particularly the prices on some microbrews that are pricier elsewhere.  Yes, it was somewhat pricier than Lula, but worth it.

I loved the perfectly al dente rigatoni with lamb meatballs, tomato, currants, pine nuts, garlic and arugula. Deep fried mozzarella with tart cherries and greens competed with fresh zucchini and golden tomatoes.  Dessert: the apricot-glazed bread pudding with amaretto gelato couldn't be beat.

2009-07-08,5.0,"Quite simply, the most satisfying meal I've ever eaten. I took the afternoon to traverse to Pilsen. I walked around, checked out a few places, and then decided, while I was here, to check out Nightwood.  I walked in, and it's just beautiful. Warm, inviting. Simple. I love it. I am seated immediately, brought water and a menu. Menus change daily, so they're nicely handwritten. Nice touch! My server comes over, and asks if I have any questions. I start my typical...what do you recommend routine. Ok...if the menu changes as often as they say (I'm sure they repeat items, but still...) he would have to be on his game. Effortless. I settled on a cheese starter that was somewhat like a combination of Brie and Mozzarella. It was served with a fennel sauce and toast points. I told him to surprise me on drink--beer, wine or cocktail. He got excited. I love it when a server loves their job, knows the food AND can pair a drink with it. Class act. He chose a beer which was amazing. Ephemere. It's a Canadian lager with an apple base (but no means a cider) and coriander. I couldn't taste the coriander until I got a bite of the fennel in the starter, and took a swig. Perfectly paired. Next, I had chicken with a white bean and bread salad. It was exquisite. The bean salad was as good with the chicken. The chicken was seasoned well, yet not over seasoned. Once again, he brought me a perfectly paired glass of white wine. A french blend...I don't remember the name. Desert was a glass of desert red (almost a port, but not quite) and a chocolate and hazelnut custard. Again, perfect. Overall, no complaints. Was it cheap? No. Have I spent that much at ""the best restaurants in the city"". Yes. Was I nearly as happy when I left said restaurants? Absolutely not. I loved it. I had high expectations, as I love Lula, and I thought there would be no way Nightwood could be different enough yet maintain the quality. It exceeded my expectations. Much better service.

2009-07-03,3.0,"Lately, I've been a bit more harsh with my Yelp reviews. So......  I am not sure if this is a case where Nightwood should be getting one more star.  My friend and I, who both live in the area, decided to come here and try it out, since it is a new restaurant in Pilsen. Pilsen, obviously has a ton of great mexican restaurants, but when something different opens up, I am especially intent on trying it.  I went there, during it's ""official"" opening week. The decor is pretty and modern. It blends in well with the art galleries that line up Halsted. As you walk in, to the left, there is an outdoor patio which seems like a perfect place for a date.  I walked in and was immediately greeted by a small cluster of pretty people. They all seemed so enthusiastic. I guess it was that first week excitement and jitters. My friend wasn't there so I sat and waited for him to arrive. In the time I waited, I had three people approach me and ask me if I wanted water (either sparkling or from a glass bottle) which I thought was kind of cool. They also brought me a wine list and it had a nice selection. The only bad part is that the prices were either really low or really high and it made no sense based on the brands.  My friend arrived, we ordered a bottle of wine. The menus are pretty - a work of art on their own. They look like someone handwrote them in that perfect penmanship you only see in commercials or movies. Our waiter told us that the menu changes every day. So that's kind of nice about it too. I ordered a field greens salad and the garlic soup, which was nice. My friend ordered the (freshly, handmade) pasta. We were full after dinner, so we didn't order dessert. We did sneek a peek at the menu and I would have ordered anything on there, it all sounded delicious. So, I would say it was a good restaurant.  I think the only reason why this place doesn't get one more star is because, I feel it is yet another restaurant on the map that will soon blend in to all the other one name restaurants in Chicago. (It has become really annoying that restaurants now feel the need to only have one word in their name. That trend is played out in my book.) I think I was also slightly disappointed with it, because I am not sure it lived up to the hype. For so long, we heard about the new ""Lula"" restaurant that was opening in Pilsen. I think if it hadn't been overhyped, my expectations wouldn't have been so high. BUT, because it is in Pilsen, I do appreciate it. If I could give it 3.5 stars, I would.  I will definitely come here again, but not before I have made the rounds on a few other places. I would bring an out of town guest here if we wanted to go somewhere with good food but wanted to stay in the area.  Best thing about it though is that it is right by the Skylark. When it comes to restaurants, I don't mind paying whatever for a great meal. Yet, given the close proximity, if I had to choose,  I would go to the Skylark over Nightwood, and feel I got equally great food and drinks at half the price.",0.9986,0.776,0.186,0.038,0.6564780638464849

2009-06-08,4.0,"Nightwood is the newest addition to this southern stretch of Halsted in Pilsen. Owned by the same people as Lula Cafe, they had been open for about a week when we stopped in for dinner.  Nightwood is named after the 1936 novel written by Djuna Dumas. It's an interesting choice as I was wondering what the link to the book would be- and as it turns out--there is no link. Just the mystery of why they named it that.  The interior is contemporary and bright. As our waiter said- they want it to be a ""beaken of light"" lighting their corner of Halsted. And the place is larger than it looks- with an outdoor patio, back seating area as well as a large room downstairs for private parties.  We were seated right away at a  perfect corner, window table (it was early) and since they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more- if you don't want to wait- I'd suggest you go early as when we were leaving the place was pretty full. Our server brought over a simple menu that changes daily- so the food that we enjoyed may not be be there if you go but I'm sure they will be replaced with equally delicious creations!  We started with a couple of the appetizers- the ravioli in butter sauce and these interesting spears of asparagus coated with smoked trout and cream cheese, lightly breaded and deep fried. While the ravioli was good-the asparagus spears were amazing! What an interesting combination of flavors!  For our entrees- I had the chicken and my friend had the pork loin. Both were extremely tasty. The chicken was a huge portion. The pork looked great- the only challenge was there was quite a bit of fat on it.  Finally dessert. I love that you can order a plate of fresh, hot from the oven cookies in 4 flavors. The toffee one was my favorite- but the peanut butter one came in a close second.  Service was good- they work in teams so different people were bringing out food out- but our server always checked in to make sure things were good.  And free street parking is still available in this area which is always nice.

Their daily menu sounds like a good idea, but if you don't like Pork (which was the key ingredient on the day we went), there was nothing else to choose from.  My vegetarian friend had the option of a salad, which they were out of, along with 5 other dishes listed on the menu.  My pasta was cold except in the middle, and I paid $9 for 3 fried asparagus.  And then $15 for 3 ravioli. Overall, I don't think I would intentionally go back.  Overpriced food, not much variety, poor infusion of daily ingredients, confused service.  At least the owners are changing the menu more than every 3 years unlike their other restaurant Lula.",0.8829,0.883,0.085,0.032,0.40730994152046784

2009-06-05,4.0,"I wish the star-rating system on yelp didn't exist, or, at least a more comphrehensive one did--because I would give this place 5 stars for service, 3 stars for food, 4 stars for ambiance, and 2 stars for the politics of the situation. That equals about a 3.5, so I'll give them the benefit of my doubt with a 4.  Remarkably, the host staff, bar staff and serving staff were all extremely friendly and approachable. At a fashionable place such as this, one could expect much less genuine kindness than was delivered. On the service alone, I would return. We started with the green garlic soup and a simple salad of mixed local lettuces. The soup was a good size, extremely creamy, a little tangy, super garlicky. MMM. The salad was, alas, just a salad.  I got the ""porcini & mozarella panino"" with olives and some other stuff. Rich and extremely buttery. I love olives so this was the right choice for me. The heavy sandwich was relieved by a side salad of mixed greens; it was quite like my appetizer, so I wish someone had told me the mains were served with salad. But whatevs. Like Lula, any bread that might find its way into your dish is going to be DELICIOUS BREAD!   The only disappointment was my dining companion's tartlet of stinging nettles and asparagus and ricotta. (SHUDDER! I hate nettles. Why must nettles, and not, say, pomegranates, be native to this clime?) But the nettles weren't the problem; it was the size of this little tart. It was about 3, optimistically 4 inches across. TINY!!!! Who do they think they are, serving us silver dollars worth of food, and calling it dinner? But i'm over it.  The crust was delicious on this little tart--fresh and buttery, flaky but not crumbly...The same goes for the strawberry tart I enjoyed for dessert. For now, there is not a fancy cocktails list, though I saw well dressed young ladies around me sipping rhubarb-colored concoctions. I had 2 glasses of wine--the latter, which was recommended to me by my charming and humble server, was a Californian pinot noir (I think it was called Laetitia). I normally am not one to rave over such light bodied wines, but wow! It was super. And super fruity.   I had previously thought that Simone's was really the straw that broke the camel's back for gentrification in Pilsen. But I spoke too soon--Nightwood added an extra load on the broken back of the previously mentioned camel. But as it is so far east, I see the future of the area morphing from ""east Pilsen"" to ""East Pilsen,"" meaning, the southernly environs of Halsted are truly becoming a different neighborhood than the more westernly, Latino areas of Pilsen. This is both good and bad, as it lets the fashion folk have their lofts and eat their nightwood too, while the western parts of the area can maintain their cultural identity.

2009-06-05,5.0,"Alright. Lets start with the cocktails: its no violet hour, but nightwood really stands apart from other restaurants for its cocktails. I had the most intriguing Manhattan I've ever had here. Really and truly. I know, a manhattan is just a manhattan, right? Nope. This one was made to exacting standards with the wonderfully bitter Punt e Mes vermouth: almost chewy and deliciously tannic...mmm. But the best part was that it was finished with a sprightly, earthy housemade cherry bitters.  And the food. Wow. Humble, tasty, vivid, and interesting. Really interesting. My burger tasted like campfire. It was as good as Kuma's. I know, sacrilege, I know. But, for a simple burger, it really kicked some ass. Now, if I could only describe the pulled pork, whoa. whoa. whoa. All in all, a fantastic value. Its not a cheap pilsen outing, but the value really is there.

While I find this interesting, everyone else should appreciate that as my group peered over the counter and looked intrigued, the cooks were even more enthusiastic about their work and their product. Love that! While not everything was perfect, each dish was executed with care and excitement. No need to tell you what we ate, because it will change. Just know that you will eat seasonally, locally, and deliciously (shoot, not a word, but totally accurate). And the servers want you to be happy, and worked hard to make sure that we were.

I love the space here.  I love the location.  I love the design.  I love the concept.   But the food?  Meh.  I get that the simple presentation and preparation are the style here but there was just no punch to anything I ate.   I have no doubt it is high quality food, but my pork was just boring, my date's trout lacked any real flavor much less punch and he disliked that the skin had not been crisped.  I like the minimalist presentation.  But I kept waiting for the one dish that would make my mouth just curl in delight.  And, surprisingly, I didn't get that pretty much the whole night, save for the bread pudding desert.

2009-06-01,3.0,"Our server Alex probably saved our experience at this restaurant.  Our waitress barely acknowledged our existence and by the time our entrees were served, we were 1 hour 15 mins into waiting.  Our waitress was busy doing something else up front including checking on her faux hawk. The restaurant is very nice - unique decor including a light fixture inside a giant birdcage above the stair case.  Be forewarned that this is a very noisy restaurant.  There is really cool bar seating at the back overlooking the kitchen which looks like it could be a very fun experience! None of the food blew me away except maybe the polenta dish served with pancetta.  The combination of flavors were unique and exciting.  The sopresatta and mozzeralla cheese was good and simple.   We shared two bottles of low priced wine, two appetizers, 4 entrees, two desserts and two scotches for the gentlemen.  For Pilsen (and I'm a Pilsen resident), I thought the place was a little overpriced.  They could withstand a 20% price reduction!   Everything else was ok but I walked out hungry and $60 poorer. I had the grilled trout served whole. While it did have a nice smokey flavor, it lacked any basic seasonings.  I did like that it was boneless yet entact.   My friend Chris ordered the pork loin and we both agreed that the texture of the pork was really strange.  It was almost rubbery and the flavors from the rub had not penetrated the meat at all leaving the dish rather unsatisfying.   Michelle had the pate and corned beef sandwich which really was quite delicious if you love pate.  Warning: you have to LOVE pate to enjoy this. I mean, love it enough to be rolling around in it because it is so strong in flavor and so rich from the fat and the buttered exterior of the sandwich!  Bonus points for being unique.  James ordered the half chicken which was probably the star of the night in terms of entrees.  The portion was very very generous and the chicken was pull-off-the-bone tender. Dessert: save room for the almond tart.  I'm a caramel lover and this was SOOOO good.  The pana cotta was good too but I was seeking something a little sweeter. Again, service - we were not impressed.  it took us a total of 2.5 hours to finish our dinner.  Luckily we weren't in a rush to go anywhere.

2009-05-31,4.0,"Had dinner there on a Saturday night. Got there around 7 and there was only a 20 minute wait.  There was no one on the patio, which makes me wonder if it is in use yet. The first thing I noticed is that this place is really beautiful, and everyone there was way way way more dressy than they are at Lula. The menu changes almost every day, so the menu they had on Time Out Chicago was already changed, but there seemed to be some regulars such as the hamburger, the chicken pate, and the half chicken.    First - they have an amazing wine selection and I am so excited to have a place down the street from me with so much wine! Too bad I am moving soon. My best friend and I got the cured trout belly and the deep fried asparagus appetizer to start.  The cured trout belly was overly salted and the pasta was undercooked.  For 11 dollars it was NOT worth it.  The deep fried asparagus was AMAZING. I mean.. I would eat that every single damn day.  Blue cheese was rolled up inside of the asparagus and then it is deep fried. The flavors were perfect together. We then got the Lamb with white cornmeal and the pork belly with roasted potatoes.  Everything was amazing.  It was all seasoned perfectly and presented beautifully.  The flavors were so delicate and soft.  My mouth was in heaven. For desert we got the Rhubarb crisp for two with a homemade ice cream, I think, either way that was fantastic. Of course, all the people who work here are part time models.  The servers wear dresses or jackets and all look like they just walked off the pages of some low end society magazine. I got over that really quick though, once the food hit my mouth.  Except for that trout belly and the undercooked pasta. This place is pretty sweet.  Oh and our Bill? 111.00.

2009-05-30,4.0,"My wife and I decided it should really be more like 3-1/2 stars, and we'll explain why. First, there is definitely a shortage of ""real"" restaurants south of Randolph street on the Halsted St. strip, so Nightwood deserves accolades just for being in the area, joining Amelia's on 46th as a ""valid"" dining destination. They also have a liquor license, which is semi-miraculous around here, and their wine selection is fairly reasonable. We got the Reader dining update e-mail which informed us Nightwood was open, though not taking reservations, or as we found, even phone calls, so we decided to take a chance and just show up. We were able to be seated right away, joining another couple of friends who just happened to be going there at the same time. The place is certainly beautiful, with a carefully and lovingly designed interior, and a nice outdoor drinks area. Indoors got pretty noisy at the height of busyness. We had the green onion and morel soup, a blended soup, very tasty, and the deep-fried asparagus with an aioli dip, satisfying the fried stuff craving. For entrees we did the trout, which came with swiss chard and a very light buerre blanc, and the half chicken, very plump, which came with white beans and a sort of bread dumpling. These items had a pleasant wood smoke taste and were exquisitely prepared, if not particularly exciting. Probably what was most noticeable was that the plates were almost entirely main dish, with their sides being minimal to almost nonexistent. This made them sort of one-note affairs, crying out for a little more garnish and balance. It would be nice to be able to add vegetable and starch sides if desired. Also, the flavors, as somebody else noted, were pretty mild and delicate, a stylistic choice, we assume. For dessert we had the almond tart with chocolate sorbet and the tangerine panna cotta. The panna cotta was supposed to have saffron in it but the tangerine certainly predominated.  Service was great, and one of the owners, Jason, came by to chat with us. Overall we had a pleasant time but feel the flavors and plate content need a little more push to propel this place into a favorite.",0.9883,0.854,0.128,0.018,0.6281118493909191
2009-05-29,4.0,"I went and ate dinner the day after Nightwood's ""soft"" public opening--that is, not advertised, etc, but word gets around--and was very pleased with the experience. So happy to have another excellent local option. Since it's so new, of course there was the usual 20-servers-for-3-diners thing going on, but that's unsurprising, and the staff handled it with grace, balancing sweetly between attentive and too-attentive, but with a dash of humor added. It did get quite a bit busier before I left, I might add: I arrived quite early, at 5:30ish, right after work--places to be and all. Of course, that was the night before they got their liquor license, but they offered a BYOB option, which was nice. No more, though, or so I hear. From what my server told me (and what I've read), Nightwood's very focused on local, fresh ingredients, and that showed in my meal: ""suckling pig and morel ravioli with spinach and green olives."" Amazingly rich, and the olives and morels packed way more taste than your usual options. Same could be said for my strawberry sorbet with macerated berries. The berries, I might add, were way more strawberry than normal strawberries, and definitely more strawberry than the sorbet--I know sorbet's supposed to be light, but in the last few bites, I could hardly tell what flavor it was supposed to be. Perrrfectly cooked, too: a good al dente, so that you know your pasta's there, you know? That said, the meal was pretty subtle. If you're not paying attention, it could be lost on you. And the portions are definitely fine dining-sized (though not terribly fine dining-priced). I was hungry again by the end of the night, though that may also be due to me eating early in the evening.  But my particular dishes aside--since they're going to rotate the menu regularly according to what's in season and fresh and available and all--it's a very, very pretty place. Low, soft-orange retro-esque chairs, medium-toned woods, hanging iron lamps, steel barstools, etc. The flowers here and there were also a great touch: I kept catching their scent and wondering if they'd perfumed the place. But no, just the lilies sitting right next to me, I finally realized. You can also eat right in front of the kitchen, which is totally open, so you can watch your meal being cooked. The patio also looks lovely, though it was too chilly on the day I went to attempt it. The one bit I found rather unsurprising but annoying (and may have only noticed due to having my leisure to see all the staff wandering about) is the makeup of the staff: was there a BMI cap during hiring or something? Every one of them that I saw was slim-to-teensy, it seemed. For that matter, there were three girls hanging out at the hostess stand, and not one of them topped 5'4"", if I were to guess. Nor did I spot any non-whites, I might add. Not that any one physical appearance is a problem, just that that particular trend struck me as irking (and potentially discriminatory, frankly). But it was just one night: there may be other folks around and I just missed them. But for such a diverse neighborhood to have such a cookie-cutter staff is a little... odd. Absolutely nothing against the current staff, though: every single one of them was lovely to me--friendly, chatting and informative, but also willing to leave me alone when I was focused on my meal. The bartender even gave me a short tour, which was super-nice of her.  So in short: love the vibe, love the decor, love the focus on fresh and local, love the food, love the current staff, but really wish they'd expand a little in that department.",0.9989,0.771,0.187,0.043,0.5017177614052614
2009-05-27,5.0,"I had the pleasure of dining at Nightwood last night, which I think was their first ""official"" open night, although they've apparently been serving meals for about a week now. My husband and I have been waiting for this place to open forever, as we're huge fans of Lula.  When we first arrived, we were greeted happily, and escorted directly to a lovely table that was about halfway between the bar and the kitchen. The space itself is gorgeous, the bar is beautiful, and they have really lovely seating along the windows, and at a counter that faces the open kitchen. Opposite the kitchen there is shelving, which holds logs, which I presume was for the wood grill they are using in the kitchen. I saw one guy stop to positively inhale the scent of one of the pieces of wood, which I found strange, but worth noting.  Anyway. The service was fantastic -- very attentive, but not annoying or overbearing at all. Very much in line with the service you'll get at Lula, in that our server was very knowledgeable and willing to share his opinions and recommendations, but wasn't suffocating in doing so, as I find to be a problem with a lot of other restaurants. They have a rotating menu, and we had a really difficult time trying to decide what to order. My husband ordered two appetizers -- the garlic soup, and the lamb meatballs with noodles. The soup portion was large, and the meatballs were a typical appetizer size, and came with three meatballs and a bed of noodles and sauce beneath. My husband said they were both very delicious. I ordered the morel and short ribs with garlic bread appetizer, which was fantastic, and for my entree I had the asparagus and potato tart with hollandaise, which came with a side salad, and honestly is one of the best things I have eaten in recent memory. My husband, who isn't really a ""tart"" kind of guy, couldn't stop raving about how good it was either. I opted out of dessert, as I was too full at this point, but my husband ordered the tangerine panna cotta,w hich looked beautiful, and which he said was delicious. It came in a ramekin with tangerine pieces on top, as well as a bit of rind.  A word to the wise -- Nightwood doesn't currently have their liquor license, although they are expecting to have it by next week. So, BYOB, my friends. There is a liquor store just next door, so you can stop in there on your way in. Or, if you're someone like me who didn't know that, the staff of the restaurant might be inclined to gift you with a courtesy beer or two during your meal.  Overall, great meal, great space, great vibe, really wonderful service. I can't wait to go back! They also have a nice outdoor space, which I can imagine will be wonderful to visit over the summer.",0.9988,0.758,0.214,0.028,0.5762709303275341
2009-05-26,4.0,"Wow. The restaurant owners were kind enough to treat area businesses and ourselves (we run South Halsted Gallery down the street and to the North) to a decadent dinner on the house prior to opening. Please don't count my review tainted as such... I feel incredibly lucky to welcome such a quality restaurant (and owner/chef with a vision) in what I might be biased on as a gem of an artistic community, for a long time now. Now on to the review... the wait staff was ridiculously attentive but not to the point of annoying. Homemade sparkling water was served (I normally drink Lake Michigan's finest) was off the charts refreshing and clean. I have to say what really shines through with every dish albeit appetizer or main course is the ingredients. I had a spinach salad with morels, potatoes, hard-cooked egg, Parmesan and aged balsamic. I cannot recall ever tasting spinach like this... that normal chalky-like texture and taste was nowhere to be found. Fresh and crunchy with no odd aftertaste. My wife had deep fried Mississippi prawns with dill butter... not off the charts great but still very tasty and perfectly cooked. For the main course, I had wood grilled trout with lentils, hamhock and pea tendrils. Wow. The trout tasted like someone just pulled it out of a lake (a clean one that is). Super fresh. A bit rare for my taste but nonetheless I have to respect the fresh quality of fish served up. My wife had handcut parsley noodles with braised short ribs and cream. It was super rich and tasted homemade to the core.  The only tweak I would make, but honestly hard to say after just one visit and likely the first time doors were open to the dining public, is the dishes are prepared almost too delicately. The food is seasoned in such a way to keep the freshness of the ingredients pure but I could see getting a bit more bold with the preparation or seasoning. Besides that, I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND and plan on recommending to anyone who comes out for Second Fridays or otherwise.",0.9977,0.742,0.223,0.035,0.5874111111111112
