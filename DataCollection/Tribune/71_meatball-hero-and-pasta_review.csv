Atif is a hands-on owner who does a fantastic job crafting the most delicious meatball dishes you can imagine - from scratch (his own creations), including vegetarian friendly items and the best Pawlenta fries I've ever tasted! The wi-fi connection is there is fast and flawless too - which makes it the perfect place to hang out at and get work done as well (for those of us who work from our laptops all day).

So cheap too. The small is about as filling as a normal sandwich from anywhere else. Will definitely come back. Polenta fries were good but to be honest they tasted pretty much like fries you'd get anywhere else.

2016-04-15,4.0,"A straightforward menu of some simple Italian comfort food. This place has only been here 9 months, according to the very sweet owner. It is small and somewhat sparse, but the quality of the food and service stands out among the minimal decor. The polenta fries are outstanding, as are the meatballs and the sauce on the Red Hero. That sauce is bright and cheery in color and flavor; tomato is the loudest note but the herbs stand out as well. I've never had a polenta fry, but I have had polenta and I have had fries. This polenta fry seems to be some magical combination of the two; the creaminess of polenta on the inside and the crispness of a well-cooked french fry on the outside are textures I will be craving again in the weeks coming. The mushroom risotto ball was also crisp on the outside, and comfortingly gooey inside- as good risotto should be. I am not sure if the sub roll is made in-house. It is a basic white baguette, a bit on the flimsy side and underwhelming compared to the robust and flavorful meatballs. It disintegrates a bit when it has been soaking in sauce internally, and it lacks real flavor but is an acceptable vehicle for delivering sumptuous meaty goodness into your awaiting maw.",0.9916,0.811,0.179,0.01,0.4401226551226552

I was pretty happy to see the promotion for $2.99 lunch. And my small Hero has a good size for me.  Thought I could eat this on the L back to loop but quickly realized no food is allowed on the Train.  Waited to get to the office. Those are still delicious.  Two decent sized meatballs per sandwich.

Chicken Meatballs with Alfredo sauce spaghetti, I love it!! the meatball is very tasty, it has a denser/smoother texture than most meatball, but excellent taste, the sauce was good too.  One thing we notice is the spaghetti, it looks kinda funky, so we asked the owner and he said they are fresh made noodle, made daily on site, for under $10 bucks, all homemade!! 3. Beef Meatballs with Bolognese sauce spaghetti, this one is our least favorite, the tasty is good, but the meatball is a little to dense, talked to the owner, he said he probably trimmed too much fat out of the beef when they grind the meat so it was a little bit too dense, they will improve it.   All in all, wonderful place, all freshly made food, reasonable price (everything under $10), taste great, décor is nothing to write home about, but I definitely will come back to grab a quick bite!",0.9946,0.774,0.208,0.018,0.5454004329004328

I ordered on Eat24 and the restaurant confirmed my order saying it should arrive in 45mins but that obviously didn't happen. At the 50min mark I called and was told the food was out for delivery and should be there soon, which I was fine with.  After another 30mins pass I call again. This time the person on the phone tells me the delivery driver attempted to deliver the food but that I never answered the phone or responded to the buzzer. Problem with that is I didn't have any missed calls from the restaurant or driver and seeing as the door buzzer rings through the phone I know the driver didn't try that either.  The restaurant then tells me it's my fault my order wasn't delivered and offered no solution to the problem. So I asked how long it would take for my food to be redelivered seeing as I paid for it already and the restaurant tells me they won't redeliver my food and I should try to get a refund from Eat24.

2015-07-08,5.0,"It's these tiny little places that come out of nowhere, open up with no fanfare, and just amaze you that really make you appreciate living in Chicago.  This place JUST opened up as of this writing and I am blown away. Before coming here I had never had a mushroom risotto 'meatball', polenta fries, or a catfish 'meatball' and to my delight, I was very impressed by them! (They didn't actually have meat in them, but I'm not sure what else to call it) It's brand new so the decor doesn't match that of more established restaurants, but what it lacked in decor it absolutely made up for in the quality of the food.  My fiancee and I got a side salad, the polenta fries (!!), the mushroom risotto balls, and the Green Hero with pasta and bolognese sauce. The Green Hero is a ball of eggplant, mushroom, bean, and oat veggie-balls. The cuisine is best described as Italian-American fusion, but it's kind of it's own thing. And EVERYTHING we tried was awesome. The polenta fries served with marinara are basically everything I've ever wanted out of a fried stick-like food and dipping sauce (I also grew up eating polenta). The mushroom risotto balls are like these nuggets of ""wow, I didn't know what to expect, but this is great!"" I was really impressed.  I went back up and ordered the other three meatballs for my fiancee and I to split and try out. They were the Beef, the catfish, and the chicken. Each one tasted great. With their own distinct textures, spices, and flavors; they each stood out and were delicious.  The only thing that I would do differently is the spaghetti was a little on the al dente side, and I'd like to see a menu option where it's a meatball sampler with 4 or 5 of the meatballs, some marinara, and a side of the polenta fries. OK, so that's two things, but I still enjoyed everything that I tried. I could also see this becoming a great byob spot (it might be BYOB, just doesn't have it listed yet) or drunk spot late at night. As of right now they close at 10pm on the week days and 11pm on Friday & Saturday. I can hope, right?  It should also be noted that the bang for your buck here is great. Big portion sizes and prices are very reasonable.",0.9975,0.81,0.174,0.016,0.641746572871573
