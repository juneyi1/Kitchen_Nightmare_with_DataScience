2010-12-01,3.0,"When will I learn that you need reservations on a Saturday night in this city?  Especially if you've got a Groupon.  The spot I wanted to go to was PACKED but Adobo was empty.  Lucky for them there are schmucks like me who forget to reserve a table.  Our server was great, very nice and attentive.  The food was pretty good.  This was my third time to the place and what I like most is the atmosphere. Each area has a different feel to it.  You can eat in the lofy open space area, at the cozy bar, or in a more intimate quartered off little room to the side. Here's what we learned by not making it into the BYOB place: you can byob here but they will charge you a $15 corking fee.  Still worth it.",0.9817,0.773,0.198,0.03,0.6254901960784314
2010-10-11,3.0,11 people for dinner at the Division location and they all seemed to enjoy although some eyebrows raised at prices. The guac is very tasty the margaritas were good as well. The Monte Albon(skirt steak) had great presentation and flavor but arrived less than piping hot. Might be because our order was large.  Ribeye steak and seafood enchiladas were raved about. Service was friendly and prompt. It was saturday night 7pm and only 50% full so not sure if the place's popularity is fading. Let me know if you 've got other mexican standouts that will take 11 on saturday night at 7pm with no wait.,0.8732,0.815,0.138,0.047,0.5237789987789987

2010-08-01,4.0,"had another date night there, outside to people watch & enjoy some guacamole (we've heard good things). Bf & I had a great conversation about what they did differently with the guacamole that other restaurants don't.  We've come to the conclusion that they use grapefruit juice instead of lime juice. Nice to know they have a gluten free menu, as i have celiacs. My tamarind-chipotle glaze chicken was really good... not a dish i'm used to seeing elsewhere. staff was very friendly and attentive.  It's nice to see people who still give a damn about what they do. Great people watching outside...  could have done without the mom club behind us hating on stroller brands.  Oh to have such problems.  lol",0.9674,0.726,0.212,0.063,0.6375
2010-07-30,3.0,"Went here with a group to catch up.  The margaritas were some of the best ever, we did have them on the rocks though.  We ordered 1 med guacamole for 5, and could only have a small spoonful each.  We had to order another and we were satisfied then.  My friends had tamales and enjoyed them while I has chicken tacos and found them enjoyable as well.  It wasn't the best ever bit I'd go back.  The service was.

2010-07-28,2.0,"Nope, nope, nope! I've been here plenty (both Division and Wells St locations), and I now vow never to go again. They still have great guacamole, but how hard can that be? I used to think the margaritas were awesome, but the last two times I've been, they have been less than mediocre. I almost feel the need to remind them that tequila is a key ingredient in a margarita, not just lemon-lime concentrate, or whatever that stuff is.  Onto the food - my bf ordered the beef tacos. He ate one of them and didn't even like it. No seasoning on the meat and, according to him, they tasted like they'd been ""heated up in the microwave""-whatever that means. When the lady asked him why he didn't finish, he told her why (nicely, but still embarrassed me), and she comped the dish. That was nice so I give her thumbs up there. I ordered the tortilla soup because I was full of guacamole. It tasted like smoky bean soup - not the worst thing I've ever eaten, but not your typical tortilla soup and not tasty enough for me to appreciate its ""uniqueness.""  Because we received the one meal for free, we decided to order a flight of tequila. My bf was talked into ordering the waitress's favorite, and not the one he wanted. I knew that was going to be a mistake right away. He's not very open to suggestions, and so I knew he wouldn't like it as much...and he didn't. The waitress also spilled the cucumber with sangrita on him when delivering the tequila, so he wasn't having a very good night with her, although he handled it pretty well.  This was and has been a big miss for me the last few times I've been there. Sorry Adobo!",0.9347,0.802,0.113,0.085,0.6409563624781017

2010-04-01,4.0,"I often try and find a decent place to find a gluten free meal and found something better than decent with Adobo.  Overall it was good. Visited the Ukrainian Village location on a Saturday night and was seated right away - no reservation.  Pulses +  A nice variety of gluten free foods on their own gluten free menu +  Food was good +  Guacamole dip (prepared table-side) and it was delicious   +  Nice clean atmosphere  +  Friendly staff, good service and my water glass was always topped off  Minuses -  Parking in the neighborhood is difficult  -  After I cleaned my plate I was still hungry (portion felt a bit small) -  I did feel a bit cramped at my table as well as it was somewhat loud",0.9862,0.684,0.282,0.034,0.6984523809523809
2009-12-17,1.0,"Their casserole tastes and looks like Hormel chili. Their tortillas are stale, like they leave the bag open all day. Their enchiladas tasted like someone got sick in a kid's diaper. And would it kill them to put tequila in the margaritas? Their guacamole is good. But they should only serve guac.",0.0516,0.692,0.164,0.145,0.6914285714285715
2009-12-08,3.0,"I'm a little torn on how to review Adobo, which used to be my favorite favorite restaurant.   Number one, they have a gluten-free menu, which is awesome, and it has a lot of really delicious choices.  Their chips (always verify first) at least now are gluten-free, but before that, Adobo provided jicama sticks so celiac patrons could still enjoy the guac. That's issue number one - their guacamole is usually sooooooo good.  But the past couple of times I've gone, they've mixed it up w/ much too much lime.  Trying to send it back and have it re-mixed was super-awkward.  The guac lady seemed to think we just didn't like it that spicy (it wasn't), and the waitress kindly suggested it was just a bad avocado, but I didn't feel like it'd be very appropriate for me to say the lady just hadn't mixed it that well.  You know?  So now I'm nervous to order their guac again, which is sad.  Better consistency is important. The other thing is, this location consistently gives me and my friends dirty glasses and silverware.  I mean, literally, every single time.  I love the food so much, and the gluten-free menu is such a wonderful thing, but dirty glasses and silverware is a turn-off at a really basic level.   Please, guys, clean up the act!  Your food is delish!  Bring up the service end!",0.9822,0.703,0.201,0.095,0.5500525210084033

2009-11-29,3.0,"Really good food. I wish there was a bit more variety on the menu, but the food is really good. The guac is supposed to be some of the best in the city. And it's great....except I can always taste garlic salt. It would be better with fresh garlic and sea salt.  The decor is beautiful, the sangria is some of the best I've had, and the margaritas are (supposedly...I didn't have one but all my friends had several) were good. I would definitely go back, but it wasn't the best food I've had. Good, not great. Same with the service.",0.9947,0.588,0.381,0.031,0.44500000000000006
2009-11-27,4.0,"Amazing! Amazing! Amazing! It is voted the best Guacamole in Chicago! Being a super guacamole fan, this place is among the top 3 Latin restaurants for me and my boyfriend. The decor is fun with traditional Mexican Hacienda and Frida Khalo and Diego Rivera style of murals. They made Guacamole in front of you with all the ingredient in a cart rolling around the restaurant. It was fresh, not too salty, but not too plain. It was perfect!  The salsa and chip ($4) was a hidden treasure. It was whole lot of chips coming with four different salsas, and they were all very distinguished. It was spicy, minty, cinnamon, and something else.  You will not get this elsewhere.  Good for couple. My boyfriend and I came here a week before we went on long-distance relationship. Now he is back, and we went back to Adobo together. Very romantic and fun place!",0.9894,0.764,0.236,0.0,0.47891156462585033
