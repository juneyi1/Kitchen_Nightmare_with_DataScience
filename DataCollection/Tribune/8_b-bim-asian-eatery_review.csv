B Bim has an identity problem.  There is a basic menu where you select rice or noodles and your meat.  The veggies are standard.  Think Chipotle-style Korean food.  So, why is this a sit down restaurant where it took 45 minutes for us to get our food?  Why not assembly line?  again, think Chipotle.  It's fast food.  They have a bar, which again, makes it seem like they don't know what they want to be.  The same young lady who took our order, was also behind the bar and may have even gone into the kitchen to help cook.  There were only two other tables, so why the long wait? I've been on a Korean food kick lately and maybe if I didn't know what it was supposed to taste like I wouldn't have been disappointed, but this isn't even remotely authentic food.  The noodles were super oily and the flavor was a little bland. So we waited a long time for bad food.  Like I said.  This place sucked.",0.5909,0.841,0.096,0.062,0.4990740740740741
2016-09-14,1.0,"I can quite honestly say this was the absolutely worst Korean food I've ever had. Korean food is generally incredibly flavorful and spicy. Yet somehow, everything here was bland and left us feeling deeply unsatisfied. The menu is quite limited.  We had the dumplings (which were fried beyond the point of recognition) and the ""Make Your Own Bowls"", one with pork and one with beef. The mushrooms were downright disgusting. The kimchi was nearly tasteless, and definitely not homemade. All told, it was incredibly disappointing.  Despite being one of two occupied tables in the restaurant, service was slow to the point of being nonexistent. It took forever for the check to get to our table even though we were clearly done.  It's really quite a shame, as the restaurant itself is quite aesthetically pleasing, and the Wicker Park location offers top notch people watching.",-0.7765,0.777,0.094,0.129,0.5740896358543417

Everything tasted good and the wings were the star of the show.  The bowls seemed a bit bland at first, but they have two sauces, one mildly spicy and one sweet, both of which added a nice flavor to everything.  Be careful with the ""mildly"" spicy sauce though.  It seems manageable at first, then the spice kicks in a bit later and has your nose running.  So use it sparingly if you're not into spicy stuff.  We mistakenly did not (actually I did not).   The Achilles heel of B Bim has to be the service.  It is very slow.  There was only one girl trying to cover the whole space.  There was a guy who helped her at times but she was very overwhelmed.  This is understandable, it's a tough business and they are obviously trying to save money.  If you go, be patient.  Service starts off swimmingly, but can become progressively slower.   The food is a winner however, and B Bim is worth a visit.",0.9688,0.867,0.109,0.024,0.5403623188405797

Setting the scene: I had a Groupon that I wanted to use before it expired so I went there today with my girlfriend.  There were 3 tables total. I let the server know before I ordered anything that I had a Groupon. She said that this was OK and that we could order a shareable, 2 bowls, and a dessert. My girlfriend also checked us in on Yelp which gave us a free Korean Pancakes.  The server let us know that they were out of Korean Pancakes. First of many bad signs. Korean pancakes is literally just flour and water with some scallions (green onions). How do you run out of that? Ok, no big deal. Moving on.. my girlfriend ordered a Beef Bowl with white rice. I ordered a pork bowl with white rice and no scallions on top. We also ordered the mandu (potstickers) and 3 lettuce wraps. The server repeated our order several times throughout us ordering which is was no big deal. *Note* She wrote down our order and confirmed with us while writing it down. 38 minutes later (from when the girlfriend checked us in on Yelp), oh surprise surprise, we got our Korean Pancakes. I guess they weren't out after all. The Korean Pancakes were severally undercooked and doughy. A while later two bowls are brought out by a different gentleman and they are chicken bowls with scallions on both. I let him know that this is not what we ordered. Roughly 48 minutes in the gentleman comes over and tells us that they messed up our order. He gave us the mandu (potstickers) and said that they were on the house. My girlfriend politely told him that this would be it and we would be leaving. I will admit, the male server was very polite and professional. The female server however, was totally incompetent. I don't understand how she even has a job. If you mess up, at least come and tell us. Don't make someone else come and tell us 48 minutes after the fact. Take some god damn responsibility and own up to your mistakes! And taking 38 minutes to even come out with Korean Pancakes is ridiculous. There were 3 tables total.  Total waste of time. Ended up eating the cost of the Groupon (GRRRR!)  I don't know how this restaurant is going to survive. My advice to management would be that their whole procedures/training needs to be reworked. 38 minutes for Korean Pancakes is a joke. The female server should be retrained or fired. She was horrible.  TLDR: Horrible server, long wait time, ended up leaving",-0.9839,0.855,0.042,0.103,0.44362373737373734

So that's probably why the place was not busy at all. We had a groupon which was a really good deal $19 for 32 value meal. We get an appetizer "" shareables"" and an entree which is a Bowl and then a choice of one dessert to share. It was okay. We liked the spicy honey chicken wings the most. Our bowls were okay. We got brown rice which was good with the dish only it was a lot of rice. The topping was small amount it was okay. There are side sauces so you can add more sauce but I didn't feel like doing it. The dessert is the frozen fish smores ice cream sandwich which was okay. To me a smores involves marshmallow , graham cracks and chocolate their take on was different. I liked it and I think I will go to H mart to grab myself more of those Fish ice-cream sandwiches. I think their food is gear towards more of an American style, because they have a Tozi's down the street with authentic Korean food, so this place B Bim Asian Eatery knows they have to be more creative and different to stand out.  However, I would suggest to add kimchee and some side ba chan to the their meals that would make the bowls more enticing to order. The ba chan can be more creative. They are creative they offer tacos and other items we didn't get to try. I probably wouldn't come back because the food is just okay for me.

As if that wasn't bad enough, the current server did not apologize, only asked if we still wanted it.  The food did not make up for the shitty service. The rice was dry and flavorless. The sauces on the table may have made it worse, and there was a pungent smell, probably from one of the toppings.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken brown rice bowl and his also had a distinct weird flavor.  The only decent part of the meal was the K-pancake, which arrived another fifteen minutes later.  We had to add more time to the street meter because we had not anticipated this agonizingly slow service.

Overall, it was very tasty.  I really enjoyed both of their sauces (a somewhat spicy chili sauce and a sweet soy).  The wings had a perfect balance of sweet and spicy, crispy skin and moist chicken.  The chicken lettuce wrap was good and I liked the mushrooms. It came as three fairly large wraps and might be easier to eat in 6 smaller ones.  The rice bowl w/ an egg was good and pretty filling.  However, I thought it was fairly skimpy on the meat and veggies (I'd order extra next time).

Even without the tortilla of their tacos they give you a great portion size and the meat is above average quality. I wouldn't exactly call it the best Korean I've ever eaten, but for the round $10 price point it's a pretty satisfying experience.  The service was really fast and friendly.

The environment was a mix of traditional Korean and urban which resonated with the simple yet fulfilling menu. We ordered two rice bowls, one with beef and one with chicken. Both bowls came with an ample amount of pickled vegetables and meat. The meats were marinated differently but were equally delicious. For $10 there was plenty of food; I couldn't even finish my bowl. A nice add on were the two sauces they had table side. One was a sweet soy type glaze and the other was a chilli lime sauce.

Although feel like you always need white rice with bibimbop. When we got the bowls they were big but an overwhelming majority of the bowl was rice. I suggest having a better rice to veggies ratio and also give patrons a little bowl of soup.  B bim also offered lettuce wraps and tacos, lettuce wraps seem unappealing to me although I did not try it. I would go back to try the tacos as I'm always intrigued by Korean tacos.
