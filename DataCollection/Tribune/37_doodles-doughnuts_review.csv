2016-09-28,2.0,"I'm so sad, I really wanted to like this place so I made a 40 minute trek before work. I ordered two doughnuts to get the full experience: a cookies and cream cake doughnut, and a chocolate cream filled yeast doughnut. So, here's my problem. The cake doughnut base was actually really good! If it had been plain, I probably would have give this place 3.5-4 stars. The cake was moist and flavorful. But it was topped with a thick layer of hard glaze and cookie chunks that completely sucked all the moisture out of it!  Then I tried their cute ""doodle"" doughnut, where you get a little tube of frosting to draw on your doughnut. A few complaints: the frosting tasted artificial and was not my style at all (and I normally love all types of frosting!). The cream filling is not a buttercream frosting but a liquidy relatively unsweet custard. Which would have actually worked well, if the frosting had been good. But as it was, the whole dish basically fell apart.",0.8409,0.853,0.094,0.054,0.5433583959899749

I got an assortment: vanilla frosted with chocolate filling (BEST, most moist, and absolutely delicious) maple bacon (A sad, dry attempt at competing with their competitors on this one. Much better elsewhere. Skip) Blueberry with fruity pebbles (no. Just no! Dry, odd flavor combo. No) Samoa - yep, like the girl scout cookie. (My second favorite and a very unique donut. Never had anything like this one) Apple fritter (bleh! I've definitely 100% have tasted better ones at the aforementioned shops. This one was way too light on the Apple taste and oddly enough not sweet enough) Regular vanilla with chocolate icing (one bite and the rest went in the garbage. Dryer than the sahara).

2016-08-29,3.0,"I dig doughnuts. I dig doughnuts more than donuts actually. Although both are the same thing grammatically, to me in my mind dough-nuts satiate that sugar rush. The latter, donut, is a contraction and in that sense think of what Dunkin' Donuts puts out. They're different. True doughnuts are what Stan's, Do-Rite, Donut Vault, Glazed and Infused, Firecakes and a few more do on the daily.  My most recent doughnut trekking brought me here. The ability to enjoy doughnuts and bacon couldn't be passed on. Pricing was about the norm (most finer doughnut purveyors are higher in comparison to chain donut shops. The difference of ""artisanal"" doughtnuts versus mass produced variety like Dunkin') and flavors of doughnuts sounded interesting but that's where the excitement ended for me. The doughnuts didn't have that texture or taste of a doughnut I'm particular to. Think of any of the above mentioned brands for examples. For instance how the doughnut held the tasty components. Did they work together or were they individual. In this case, it was individual and not working together.  I shared an assortment with my coffee group and sought their experiences. Tried the Boston creme, Pink lemonade, Cinnamon crumb and a couple others. The donut toppings were all tasty in their own ways but as a whole didn't capture my attention. Unlike any of the competitors I'd listed in the previous paragraph, these doughnuts were bready and if we were to remove the glaze or sweet cremes it'd probably be used as a component to accompany a soup or stew.  Their flavored bacons are their own story. Having them displayed on white plates made them all the more appetizing. Displayed atop the counter in this playful, whimsical environment it feels as though one could grab a strip or three and happily chomp away. So long as a hot cup of Metropolis coffee is waiting to accompany the taste bonanza. With a bacon purchase, at any time of day, one could relive that morning excitement. The strong hints of good coffee paired with that first tasty bite of good bacon. For me, it's curry-ginger every time. I've been back twice since for bacon or bacon and coffee. (Bacon strips are wrapped in paper lined aluminum foil. Keeps it warm and keeps your fingers neat.)",0.9917,0.878,0.115,0.006,0.4418859649122807

Nice ambiance to the store...we were greeted warmly as we entered...which is always a nice start. The doughnuts were creative...with many different tastes. The main problem is the price point.  With such a high price point they do not operate on quantity like a Dunkin Donuts, but more on quality and creativity. They had a nice selection of different even quirky doughnuts, but they all weren't of the freshest quality. This should be expected, since they can't have a huge selection of ever changing doughnuts in each category...they just don't sell enough to do that. The doughnuts we had were nice, but not worth $3 a piece.  The bacon offerings were nice...but also suffered from the price point problem.

Recommend, good balance of tart and sweetness. -Smores. Pass!! Overly sweet and reminds me a lot of what you can get at Mariano. One bite and I had a sugar overload shock. -Raised glazed. Pass and miss!!! Dry, not soft raised yeast like Stan's or Doughnut Vault's.  -Jelly filled. Common theme of Doodle's yeast doughnuts is dryness. Filling was berry mango. Eh. -Samoa. Toppings made it worthwhile, love the amount of coconut. Texture was a bit dense. Note for gluten free folks. Options were made of rice flour, which is a solid alternative. But they ruined them by making a donut sandwich of sorts with lots of frosting.  1 star for quality and taste. They were of grocery store quality. Plus 1 star for space.

2016-07-08,2.0,"Full disclosure--I came by on the Fourth of July, so it's very possible that a mix of things made for this visit to fall outside of the normal set of operations at Doodle's. My wife, daughter and I came by for donuts on the way to the beach for the day.  We grabbed a plain glazed and the cinnamon twist, in part because Doodle's was out of the Doodle's Doughnut.  (I asked the proprietor, ""Is it strange to be open for business and out of the item that you call your signature item at 8:45 AM?""  ""Yes, it is!"" she replied...) Neither donut was particularly interesting, but I suspect (then and now) that the doughnuts we had were day-old, or evening old...it is very rare that I go to get donuts before 9 AM and they don't taste super-fresh.  (If you are wondering about my donut street cred, please read my other Yelp reviews.) So, the glazed donut was a borderline disaster, at least in donut terms--it didn't taste fresh even though it was a yeast donut, the glaze was very bland (which might be my problem: I prefer sugary goodness in my donuts, not overly fresh ingredients and an all-natural approach), and the inside of this donut was pretty dense. The twist was a little better, but not enough to warrant finishing the donut; it, too, was a bit dense for my tastes/expectations. Love the space here, and the prices are fair given the 'hood.  Service was also great and the space was pretty quiet on the Fourth. I want to have other donut friends recommend this place to me before coming back, and I'll certainly do it on a weekend morning during a ""normal"" time of the year.  Still amused that the Doodle was out of stock, but I understand this was in part because one of the things Doodle's uses to make the signature icing on that donut didn't make a delivery the day before.",0.9878,0.807,0.142,0.052,0.5245484400656815

It's pretty new, but their pink lemonade doughnut intrigued me. Service: Walking in on a drizzling Tuesday morning, this place was empty. Shortly after we entered, another guy walked in, so we let him order before us so we could take in all the flavors. The owner was just finishing up some final touches for the morning, like filling up the water dispenser, so when we went upstairs to eat our doughnuts, she offered to bring us waters. So nice! Throughout the time we were there enjoying our doughnuts, several others walked in to grab doughnuts for there or to go. Doughnuts: Being the doughnut fanatic that I am, I had to order the pink lemonade and my standard doughnut, the chocolate old fashioned. My bf ordered the chocolate glazed. We shared and enjoyed all three. The chocolate old fashioned was ok, but not nearly one of the best I've had. It missed the mark on having a crunchy exterior and the shape was off - like the dough rose a little too much. The chocolate glazed was pretty good.

So here's the rather lengthy story: I happened to be walking down Wells and I was hungry.. I saw the donuts... I passed this place, but then turned back and decided to give it a go. The inside looked cool - you can come in with your book/laptop/friend and sit down and do whatever you need to do.

The price rattled me a bit ($3.50 per piece) [So no star for that], but they were rather large in size and I decided to give it a go (again, I was hungry). Went for my fav - Boston Cream. As the girl is packing it up for me and we're exchanging money, I see one of their employees (baker? was wearing an apron) approach the counter and ask if he could use the phone (headset was laying on the counter). A man, who I assume is the owner, said 'no'. The employee explained how he does not have any money/minutes available on his phone. Then the presumed owner said that he has seen him on the phone just a minute ago. The employee explained it was Face Time and that didn't cost him, but he needed to call someone not on FT. In the corner of my eye I saw the employee walk away while the 'owner' and another female employee giggled. I paid and walked out. At first I thought they were just joking around (I probably would), but then I noticed that the employee walked away and the headset remained put on the counter. That might have been very embarassing to the employee. The ""supreme ruler"" talking to him like this... Oh course he had the right to deny him, but the way he did it... was just plain cruel. And to laugh at the guy? I just hope he did not have anything urgent to attaned to. If the employer does not care about their employee, I do not approve of their business.

2016-03-22,4.0,"Good doughnuts, nice people.  Since I had to trek pretty far from the burbs to try a new apple fritter, I called ahead to check availability.  A woman assured me that they would have plenty later, as a new batch was just being made, but offered to set aside one nevertheless.  I gladly accepted her offer--better safe than sorry! My fritter, and plenty of others, were waiting for me.  With many apple fritter purveyors, you get one shot first thing in the morning; kudos to Doodle's for keeping these stocked past noon, as well as all of their other wares.  Doughnuts are not just for breakfast, right?  There's nothing sadder than going into a bakery after lunch and seeing trays full of nothing but crumbs and lost hope. Anyway, the fritter was really good.  It was flatter and thinner than most versions, and crispy around the edges but very moist inside.  It could stand a bump in apple and cinnamon content. Their other stuff also landed in the B+/A- range.   The boston creme was well done, with the minor quibble that my first two bites contained no custard.  The injection was very generous, but somewhat off-center.  They sell a Samoa doughnut, which is right up my alley.  It's a great concept, if not executed quite as well as the namesake cookie (or my wife's Samoa cookie bars).  The base doughnut is so substantial that it imbalances the flavor of the toppings; reduce the dough volume by 20% or so, and you have a big winner. So that's the theme, really--very good doughnuts, if not all-time greats.  A small tweak or two would put them on the same level as the existing top-shelf establishments in the city's haute doughnut (aka ""honut"") scene.",0.9956,0.779,0.199,0.022,0.5224062049062049

2016-03-20,2.0,"Disappointing! Was so excited to try as I live down the street and found a lack of variety (only 6 types of donuts) and extremely disorganized staff. They had unclear roles behind the counter leading to mistakes in our order, long lines, and clearly frazzled employees. They don't offer almond milk either which I hope they would. The decor is very cute, but if the food isn't worth it.... Decor won't cut it.",0.1432,0.734,0.127,0.14,0.6202020202020203
2016-03-19,3.0,Needs a bit more variety but the apple fritter doughnut is delicious!!! It could use just a bit more apple pieces but besides that delicious!!!! Will definitely go again.,0.8949,0.719,0.281,0.0,0.7
2016-03-18,5.0,"This place opened around the corner and down the street from me and I was super excited once they opened! A day before their grand opening, they were passing out small samples of their doughnuts and they were really good! Anyways, this is actually my second time here, but my first time eating here. The first time was on the St. Patrick's day parade (Saturday) and I was in a hurry to pick a dozen of whatever and leave. But this time, I actually took some time to eat a doughnut and drink some cappuccino with my cousin late at night. I had the vanilla cream doodle doughnut with blue (blueberry flavored) icing. First, the glaze and the icing was not overly sweet, which is awesome! The doodle doughnut was filled with vanilla CUSTARD. This is the kind of custard you find at a fine patisserie, not some cheap custard you find at Dunkin Donuts. Oh, and they make it with VANILLA BEANS!!! You can see the vanilla seeds in the custard. And they generously FILL this doughnut! The entire doughnut was very tasty and not too sweet, even with the glaze and icing added. I think I inhaled it lol! My cousin got the pink lemonade and it was delicious. Once again, the lemon custard was carefully prepared and it's not the ""cheap"" version.  The staff was really nice and highly informative. They're really enthusiastic about describing their products and you can tell they're happy the assist you! They will also not hesitate to tell you which is their favorite (most say the pink lemonade)! This place is still new, so they're rolling out new flavors slowly. I will definitely keep an eye out on new offers and flavors. Try this place out! They're open late on Fridays and Saturdays till midnight! And the doughnuts still taste fresh that late! Doughnuts are a little more on the pricey side...there are no $1 doughnuts. But if you're aiming for quality, then you get what you paid for. And you're definitely getting your money's worth here!

2016-03-15,3.0,"I added this business to Yelp and was so excited to try it on its only second day of business. My wife and I are hardcore donut lovers, and were not impressed. They were a hair below l donuts from a Whole Foods bakery. We tried 6 different donuts, which I believe was the extent of their selection at the moment. All yeast raised donuts had a little bite, which means it took a little extra effort to chew. Not bad, if that's the kind of donut you like. We agreed the old fashioned and their cream-filled, paczki-like signature donut aka Doodle were the new business' best showings. Although you could tell they didn't skimp on quality (chocolate and vanilla icing, cream filling), each donut failed to harmonize all of its otherwise good individual flavor profiles. For example, the glazed donut's nutmeg and/or cinnamon essence was overpowering for its light sugar crust. Chocolate glaze didn't complement its yeast-raised base. The excellent vanilla pastry cream and vanilla glaze taste were good, but disjointed in the Doodle. Coupled with the odd assembly line as noted by other reviewers, the whole experience was just a bit off. Every other haute and classic donut shop in Chicagoland (aside from a few awful ones like Dunkin) have better selection and tastier donuts. Don't look twice. Move on.",0.7416,0.824,0.108,0.068,0.5219958202716823
2016-03-11,5.0,Yum! Great addition to the neighborhood! We're glad you're here! I came in around 1 in the afternoon and they still had quite a few donuts. Really fun atmosphere. Can't wait to bring friends here.,0.94,0.656,0.344,0.0,0.5125000000000001
2016-03-11,4.0,Finally my inner fat kid has a good donut place near home! Seriously what took old town so long to get one!  On this visit I went with the Doodle donut. A white frosted donut with either vanilla or  chocolate filing.  The fun part is that you get a small pipe bag with frosting so you can decorate it. I'm sure kids will love this. Heck...I loved it. It's a pretty good donut just REALLY sweet. Next time I'm sure I'll try their pink lemonade donut. That's more my speed. We also tried their candied bacon. Yum. But who can complain about sugared bacon? When we were there the entire joint smelled of bacon!,0.9792,0.742,0.226,0.032,0.49430555555555566
2016-03-10,5.0,"My friend got one of the doodle doughnuts for me when he was in the area.  It's so much fun! The doughnut itself was very good - if not my favourite doughnut in Chicago thus far! The dough is very good and the icing is also really yummy! I also tried his pink lemonade doughnut and it was delicious!  Would definitely recommend. :)!
