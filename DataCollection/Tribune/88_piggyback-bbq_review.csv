2016-06-29,3.0,"Today I had a pregnancy craving for some bbq.  Working downtown is the perfect area to have a craving, because its very likely you will find the food that you want.  Today i ventured over to Piggyback BBQ.  I wasn't super impressed neither was I super disappointed. I tried the beef brisket, greens and macaroni n cheese.  The Brisket was tender and well cooked, they gave you a nice amount of meat and it was covered in smoky sweet bbq sauce.  The macaroni was cheesy with a nice bread crumb crust.  However, the greens were horrible.  I have never in my life had collard greens that were SWEET! Just gross. Why destroy greens with sugar, i just don't get it.  Overall the meal was decent and it satisfied my craving, but i probably won't give them another chance. Oh and they are pricey my food was $14!!!",0.6235,0.786,0.13,0.083,0.7088235294117647
2016-06-24,2.0,"They're alright nothing to rave about. They're good as a last option if getting bbq near the loop. You'll go here if you want to try them out but definitely not a place you want to dine-in/takeout everytime, once a month maybe? Brisket's too lean, the chicken's too dry, pulled pork lacks the smokiness. But at least they have consistency on lacking flavor on all their que. What more can I say... The sauces are also watered down in consistency. At east that's your last hope to put their ques to the next level but also fails on doing so. There's only a few to pick from so it's easy to make a choice.  I dig the Georgia Caviar of all the sides, which I think is a vinegar based southern recipe (black-eyed peas, corn, tomato, onions, bell pepper). All their sides are $1.75. -$2 extra. The brisket chili's ok too but I had better. The rice bowl is of decent serving size but I preferred when they use to serve those buttery grits instead of rice or at least they should bring it back as an option to the cilantro rice. I just saw they started serving pork cubano sandwiches, but I would imagine it's a meh, unless they use a different recipe for the bbq pork. I might try next time. Worse part is they always mix up somebody's order. Prep line is not that efficient and they tend to get out of focus of who needs to pay first. It's easy, first-in first-out. They don't have anything on their menu that needs to be prepped/customized at the back kitchen.",0.9292,0.85,0.101,0.049,0.3978174603174603

2016-05-13,1.0,Not good. Would give it zero stars if Yelp allowed that. Had the brisket sandwich. You get 8oz of brisket but it was almost all fat because they leave the crown too thick.  Very little smoke flavor.  If you are looking for good BBQ in this part of the Loop go to Blackwood instead. It is only a few blocks away and is a much better option. Or try LillyQ at the French Market at Ogilvie train station.,0.7906,0.842,0.114,0.043,0.49062500000000003
2016-05-04,1.0,"Worst lunch ever! Had 1 chicken taco and 1 pork taco with a side of greens. I will start with the ""best"" thing about this place and that is the employees. The greens were actually inedible, under cooked and tasted as if they had been pickled. I wish I had taken my server up on the offer to try them first. I took one bite and couldn't stomach another; my boss tried them and spit them out (He will eat just about anything!) I had tried 2 different kinds of the sauce - sweet and zesty,  sadly I couldn't determine which was which and they both had a chemical aftertaste so I refrained from putting them on my food. The pulled pork was dry, flavorless and overcooked. The chicken was actually decent with a nice smoky flavor. Even the tortillas were hard and dried! My boss who had the chili was amazed that they managed to cook all the flavor out of the ingredients. He said #worstchiliever and that he has had better canned chili. I am glad that I gave it a shot but will never ever return for a second chance. After spending almost $13 for 2 average sized, weak tacos and 2 small disgusting sides I will stay as far away from Piggyback as I can get!!",-0.7156,0.867,0.062,0.071,0.6462121212121212

The sauces and sandwiches are pretty good here. All sides are seperate, and I should have saved my money on the greens. I got the pulled pork sandwich with the Carolina sauce.

2016-02-10,2.0,"Came here for lunch while visiting Chicago for work.  It's new so I figured I'd give it a shot.  First thing you notice when approaching is the sign claiming ""House Smoked Brisket"" Woot!  I love Brisket!! You come in, and the ordering method is designed very similar to how a Chipotle is operated.  Plate, Bowl, Taco or Sandwich choice.  Meat Choice.  Side Choice. Pay at register.  Find a seat. I asked for the Brisket and requested a piece with lots of bark which they accommodated for me.  You get 8 ounces of meat which is plenty, and a choice of sauce.  I picked the Zesty sauce which was tangy and spicy, not bad but not great either.  I also picked Coleslaw as my side which ran an additional $1.45.  After tax, my total for brisket and coleslaw (came in a small side cup) was about $12.  A bit pricey in my opinion. OK, found a seat and ready to dig in.  First thing I noticed is that for 14 hours of smoke, the pink smoke penetration is not very deep.  I also notice how gray the meat is which suggests that it might be over done.  I take a bite, and my suspicions are confirmed.  Dry.  Man, how sad.  I believe (with my limited smoking experience) is that their heat is too high on the smoker.  This means that over 14 hours, the meat is getting all the juices drained out of it.  the only reason the meat isn't a brick is because the bark is pretty nice and keeping some juices in.  Overall, a disappointment.   If I heard reviews of this place going softer on the heat and having non-dry brisket, I'd give this place another shot, but I've had much better.",0.4955,0.838,0.086,0.076,0.5439371295371295

I think the portion size of the pulled pork that I got was generous, but the mac and cheese side was awful. The pasta was horribly overcooked and there was an unappetizing topping that made it look home made. Take a look at Blackwood's mac and cheese by comparison. I liked that they asked me how much sauce to put on, but the sauce wasn't as 'zesty' as the name would suggest.

2015-12-30,3.0,"Despite the negative reviews, I tried this place out for lunch today.  I opted for the salad with pulled chicken.  It was fine - not memorable and not bad.  Chicken was pretty good - not greasy and had a lot of flavor.  Although most of the flavor was spice.  I don't know if it was from the chicken itself, the little bit of zesty BBQ sauce they put on top per my request, or the BBQ vinaigrette dressing but my mouth was HOT after I was done.  (Disclaimer - I can handle some heat but am not known for my heat tolerance).   I think my biggest peeve with this place is the lack of explanation of anything on the menu.  The menu provided no inclination as to what would be on top of the salad.  The bowl apparently comes with rice (which I discovered solely from observation), and I have no idea if sides are included on the plate option.  When I ordered my salad I was never asked what sort of toppings I wanted.  When I opened it up, I found tomatoes, several slices of red onion, corn (which I do not eat and it's SO hard to pick off) and green pepper which I'd rather stick a fork in my eye than eat.  This would have been useful information for the gentleman preparing my salad.  It was also weird to me that when I ordered my meal, he grabbed the takeout container, bent down behind the counter and filled it with presumably a lettuce mix from a cooler, but I couldn't see so couldn't even stop him from adding the things I didn't want.  There is no description of the sauces like most BBQ joints, where you read it and are actually excited to try it. Also, if I'm being picky, the chicken is cut into strips, it is not pulled.   I guess the main thing that matters is how the food tastes, and this place was fine.  Although if you are in this area, you are much better off walking an extra block and getting Blackwood BBQ.",0.3358,0.839,0.086,0.074,0.5671146953405019
2015-12-18,1.0,"Nope. As a southerner, my BBQ standards are high, but my pork plate was unappetizing and I would not return. The chopped pork is rather dry, which Piggyback BBQ counteracts with a lot of oil. As a result, the meat tasted both dry and greasy.  The collard greens had a lot of sugar in them, so the big takeaway taste was sweet apple cider vinegar. Cornbread fine, a little dry. Mac and cheese not remarkable.  The meat didn't set well with me the rest of the day- don't think it was bad, the grease just didn't agree. The menu is ala carte, and each small side was $1.75, which seems high for the portion size.  A plate of chopped pork and 2 sides was $12, which is not the value of the food.",-0.8713,0.841,0.044,0.115,0.5728205128205128
2015-11-30,4.0,"First off, Piggyback BBQ is just around the corner and a couple of blocks down from Blackwood BBQ. They are VERY similar in atmosphere, order style, and food and side options.  (Blackwood BBQ is by far a better option, and I highly recommend everyone to try it). I have visited Piggyback BBQ twice so far.  The first time, I got a salad with pulled chicken, and a side of grits.  The second time I got the chili (made from their brisket) and a side of mac & cheese. The salad with pulled chicken was good enough the first time I visited, for me to return for a second meal (except the grits are plain - I'd prefer cheesy grits).   My second visit was more impressive.  The brisket chili is delicious.  A little spicy, but tons of thick and chunky brisket pieces, black beans, celery, etc.  I actually prefer Piggyback's chili over Blackwood BBQ's brisket chili.  Blackwood's had a lot of fat pieces - almost more than meat pieces.  I also got the mac & cheese and it was pretty tasty too.  I wasn't thrilled with the price though.  For a large chili and a small side of mac & cheese, I paid over $9.00.  And then I forgot a water bottle and paid separately for that.  It was over $2.00.  But brisket is expensive meat, so I understand the reason for the high price. The main reason I was impressed was the service!!   At first, I asked if they had any crackers for my chili.  The woman told me ""no, we don't.""  Then I asked if they had some shredded cheese to put in my chili, and she said ""we just ran out of cheese.""  No big deal - the chili looked delicious, so I didn't mind eating it plain.  But, then about 10 minutes later, one of the workers came to my table with a bowl of shredded cheddar and 2 bags of oyster crackers.  HE WENT OUT AND GOT SOME FOR ME.  Call me impressed.  Rarely does a ""fast"" food establishment go out of their way to get something for you to make your experience more satisfying.  If you've ever watched the customer service video on YouTube, about how businesses should go the extra mile (in one restaurant's case - free pickles for their customers - see here:  youtube.com/watch?v=ISJ1… ), this place definitely did their best to go the extra mile! On another note, I was hoping to eat my food in peace...but could not due to the very loud grunge/rock music playing on the speakers.  I put in my earbuds and listened to Adele's new album instead.  ;)   I will be back...especially for the chili!  But, I will most likely take it back to my office where it is quieter.",0.9941,0.865,0.12,0.016,0.5488623479694908
2015-11-20,3.0,"So, everyone, actually you're incorrect about the Chipotle style resturaunt comment. I think this location is just trying a better ""to go"" option. Hear me out: Piggyback is native to Forest Park. They have a really kick ass restaurant on Downtown Madison St. It's amazing...but it's primarily sit down, not take out. I mean, you can take your food to go, but it's not any more convenient than sitting down really.  Now this is their second location and lucky them, they got a spot connected to the train station which is awesome. But let's think about it...does everyone commuting really want to sit down? No. They want to take their food on the run back to the office or on the train. So what better way than to have a line of food ready to go? BBQ style? A good idea I must say and I was impressed when I saw it. I sat down today for lunch and yes, my experience was not the same as the Forest Park location; however, it was still good food. Limited menu since its a newer establishment, and the service was decent for being opening week or so. Overall, I would go back to give it another try.
