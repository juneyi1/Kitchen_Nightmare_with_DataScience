2016-09-07,1.0,"I was afraid this day would come. I like the food. As a reasonable facsimile of Sarkis but exponentially closer to my house, it was a great idea. Sadly, the service has made it impossible for me to continue on. I have tried dining in, taking out and delivery. I've tried early and I've tried late and all times in between. It doesn't matter. The dining in experience has varied from sluggish to infuriating. The take out when I've called ahead and the phone was actually answered was surreal. 45 minutes MINIMUM to prepare a sandwich seems a bit egregious.  The delivery though, is borderline criminal. Only order delivery if you expect to be moments away from a 2 hour paralyzing coma. Then you won't notice that your entire day was sucked from you while you waited for a sandwich. If a group of tortoises were to take quaaludes and then try running a restaurant, I would imagine it would be something like what happens at Sarks in the Park.",-0.8981,0.821,0.059,0.12,0.6589285714285713

2016-08-14,1.0,"I wish I could share my opinion and/or experience for my highly anticipated breakfast burrito, but it was never created.  This has now happened twice... shame on me.  My first visit in summer 2015 involved me and my, now, ex-girlfriend ordering breakfast in their lovely, yet deceitful terrace. One would think having such a prime location would result in a business that knows how to take an order. It would make sense if we ordered and received the wrong food. But over the course of an hour and a half and a handful of friendly reminders, our food was unfortunately forgotten about. My day, dining experience and tummy were left empty.  My relationship with Sarks in the Park has now come to an end on this summer day of 2016. My roommate and I gave this place a second chance by ordering take out (breakfast burritos again). Not only did the woman on the phone sound like the most dismal creature to walk the face of the planet, but the order was never put into action. We arrived 30 minutes later, providing plenty of time to put eggs in a tightly diaper wrapped tortilla. To no surprise, our food was not ready or even known to be in existence. We patiently waited in the dimly lit, narrow corridor they call a dining room. A man who was covered in grease and a soaking wet shirt was delivering food to tables that were occupied with immediately regretful faces. Under no circumstances should an entity present an employee to their customers in that condition. This man looked and smelled of raw sewage. It was at that moment, we thought it would be in our best interest to leave the establishment.  One star may be a little harsh because I cannot rate the food. But I have now given them two opportunities to take my money in exchange for anything, just anything.  This is an election year where every vote counts. In the spirit of democracy, I vote to board this place up and forbid these folks to ever waste a person's afternoon again.   Who's with me? #Marty2016",-0.929,0.78,0.092,0.129,0.4161945461945462

I usually order with one eye still closed, so I can go back to sleep while I'm waiting. Expect them to get your order wrong, so factor in time for them to correct it too. Order through GrubHub because the staff is incredibly incompetent. That way they can't use their usual slew of excuses when they get your order wrong or take forever to deliver.

I will never set foot in this place and I recommend that next time you are in mood for a Loretta or Disaster go get the real deal. #sarkiscafe,0.1045,0.808,0.11,0.083,0.5558080808080809

Hash browns are a personal thing, everyone has their opinion- but whatever they do to these are exactly how I like mine, and they'll add cheese to them too. Again, stick to the classics and the food here is 5 stars. However... ***** I am totally AMAZED by the service here, it is probably the most disorganized, worst operation I've ever witnessed in my life. Anywhere. I'm not exaggerating. I feel bad for the servers because EVERY TIME I GO HERE there is a total disaster going on. It's uncomfortable.***** I must repeat this, because it's totally mind-blowing. THE SERVICE IS SCARY BAD. There have been several times I vowed never going back because I waited with no warning, explanation or care or acknowledgment that the food (which feels like should come out in five minutes) was taking 1 hour and 30 minutes with nothing but ketchup bottles and hot sauces and barely water and sometime the server wandering outside to smoke for 10 minutes while the tables all just frustratingly starred at each other in amazement.  Honestly, it's gotten the point where I've just accepted this the way it's going to be and I've moved on and accepted it. I'll never stop in at noon on Saturday, if I walk in and I see a lady frantically WALKING INTO THE KITCHEN TO PERSONALLY FIGURE OUT WHAT THE PROBLEM WAS WITH WHOEVER IS/WASN'T BACK THERE AS SHE WAS SCREAMING THAT SHE WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN THE RESTAURANT AND WAS WAITING FOR TWO HOURS WITH NO FOOD. Now I've just embraced it, I'll just ask the tables how long they've been waiting and if they start swearing, I'll just turn around and go somewhere else. And that's what I suggest you do. If it feels like the crowd is restless beyond a 7, save this place for another day. But if it's at only a 6.5 then sit and order immediately and be patient. You'll never see it below 5 on the anxiety scale, ever, I'm not kidding- if you're the first person in line, you will still get majorly hosed before you leave, so 5-7 is your go zone, anything north of that...walk away.

He called em up around 11:30am, ordered and paid for it as you always do...they said when they'd arrive, they didn't, he called, they apologized and said they were again on their way in another hour, but didn't come, this went back and forth a couple more times and then they just closed! NO CALL NO SHOW. And he was charged for it! The next day, it was him who had to track them down, and they said they'd ""give him a discount the next time"". Ha, that was the extent of their apology. Bottom line there is no way around the service until they sell it someone who knows how to run a restaurant. In the meantime, I have no complaints about the food.

They send the guy back - brought us 1 bottle of vitamin water that we didn't order..wow.. Second time order..Asked for no cheese, no eggs on the sandwiches, crispy bacon on the side and the hot sauce.

Then he comes to our building doorman lets him in he goes to the wrong apartment and leaves the building.  Phone charged  at this point we have a msg that we were not at that apartment.

2014-06-02,2.0,"It was a perfect sunny early summer Sunday in Chicago so clearly the idea of being outside was a must.  They have a great recessed patio surrounded by trees for a fun atmosphere.  The food itself was decent/good among other Chicago brunch places.  I really enjoyed the cheesy hash browns!   The wait wasn't horrible at 11am, only 20 minutes.  Once we were seated we got menus and water right away and placed our orders.  Then we waited,  And waited some more.  About an hour later our waitress comes up and says food should be out soon.  Another 20 minutes goes by and our waitress tells us the kitchen got slammed with Grubhub orders so our food should be out shortly.  Yet another 20 minutes go by and once again we are told our food is coming right up.  This time it actually showed.  By this time we were thoroughly annoyed we would have eaten anything.   While we started eating 2 hours later the manager came to apologize for the wait and explained that the grubhub orders backed up the kitchen and that they made the online orders a 2 hour wait too.  The apology didn't feel very heartfelt almost more a necessity rather than honesty.  He explained that he had friends there that had been waiting for 3 hours.  Even if we were friends I wouldn't wait 3 hours even if you comped the entire meal.   I don't want to be negative with out at least providing some feedback to help improve.  If you can not take care of your in house customers don't try for external customers.  Your first priority should be the the people you are staffing and the customers filling your seats.  You have servers and staff that rely on tips and fast turns of tables so by making people want to walk out and having no turn over and a bad experience hurts your staff who I hope are already looking for new employment where they can be rewarded for their services.  You should not accept online orders during weekend rush periods but if you are going to only allow a few.  Treat online just as if it were another table in your restaurant.  If people are willing to wait for a table to sit they should wait online too. I get that issues come up but its how they are handled that make the difference on if people will return or just write the place off. Overall - try this place at your own risk.  Make sure you are not starving when you go here because who knows when your next meal will be.",0.9615,0.857,0.097,0.045,0.5096721180054513

I ordered delivery through Grubhub (who, I want to mention, has REALLY gone out of their way to try to compensate me for Sarks horrible service) at 11:40.  Estimated delivery arrival was between 12:50 and 1:00.  At 1:20 I called Sarks.  The woman assured me that (a) the food was already out for delivery and would be there momentarily, and (b) that she had added the instruction that my buzzer did not work and they would call my cell upon arrival.  At 1:40 I called Grubhub.  While I was on the phone I heard someone outside knocking on the door (I live on the FOURTH FLOOR).  I went down.  It was the ""food.""  He denied ever having been told to call me.  He then took the food warmer off that he was wearing as a backpack and took out my food that had clearly been sitting on its side.  An entire side of the bag was covered in grease and dressing.  When I mentioned that it was NOT acceptable, he shrugged and walked away. Now the food: I ordered a BYO omelet with feta, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, and chorizo.  What did I get?  A cold ""omelet""...scrambled eggs folded in half that may have originally contained the filling, but the filling was only next to the eggs...also there were no tomatoes or mushrooms. I ordered a ceasar salad with steak.  The salad description included tomatoes...no tomatoes.  Also, almost ALL of the dressing had poured out of the container due to the way it was carried and it was all over the toast that was intended to go with the ""omelet"" so that it was inedible.  Oh, and the salad came with chicken on it, not steak.  And the chicken, I'm pretty sure was sliced, pre-cooked stuff like you can buy in the cooler section of the grocery store. I also got a side of the ""Disaster sausage.""  It was still red in the middle.  I'm not 100% sure what type of meat it was, but I do know that ground meat should not be RED in the middle, especially if it's been ""on the way"" for 2 hours.  I threw it out...hoping I don't get sick from what I did eat. This would all be hilarious if it wasn't an accurate depiction of the experience.  I honestly don't think an order can be this screwed up without someone TRYING. Grubhub called on my behalf to see what the restaurant would be willing to do since the order was entirely WRONG, then cold, and poorly handled...and part of it was potentially unsafely undercooked.  They offered $15 off my next order...HOW IS THAT APPROPRIATE???  Why would I EVER order from this disaster of a restaurant?????",-0.6892,0.868,0.069,0.063,0.5876984126984127

I get home and open a box containing plain old, undercooked hash browns.  I dug around only to find that delicious grilled cheese sodden with cold, moist, and tasteless hash.  There was no extra bacon on my disgustingly soggy, potato-ridden sandwich.  I wasn't taking another 1/2 hour out of my day to correct their mistake, so they refunded me for the special hash.  How generous. Goodbye sarks, it's been annoying. Oh, and one final note: Sarks in the Park is NOT affiliated with Evanston's true and original Sarkis Cafe.  The owner is a North Shore brat who stole Sarkis' famous sandwiches and opened up his own restaurant under the guise of authorization.   From the time he opened this Lincoln Park establishment he has been attempting to pass this restaurant off as Sarkis Cafe's Chicago branch.  Wonder why Sarks' ""Bacon Sandwich"" is no longer called the ""Loretta""?  It's because the courts finally intervened.  In my opinion, the courts should have shut this place down and returned all profits to its rightful owner.   Anyone who supports Sarks in the park is supporting the theft of a North Shore brat who lacks the creativity to develop his own successful restaurant.  Here's the link to Sarkis' complaint:  ia601505.us.archive.org/… If you have a car, make the short drive up to the original Sarkis Cafe in Evanston.  In the same amount of time it takes Sarks to seat you, take your order, and serve you, you could have a less expensive, quality meal from a restaurant that exists thanks to one man's creativity and dedication to delivering delicious, cheesy breakfast goodness.",0.9808,0.778,0.146,0.076,0.6378341687552214

After waiting a little too long, our food showed up.  We ordered a side of ham for the dog (which cost $3.50).  It was easily 90% fat.  The omelet I ordered was not an omelet, but instead a pile of tomatoes and onions with egg laid on top and was missing avocado.  No one came to ask how things were and we had to go find someone with our plates of food to show them what they had brought us.  Our server never came to apologize and didn't even bring out our new food.  She never once came to see if we needed anything else. After we were finished, we sat for 5-10 minutes looking for someone to bring us a box and our check.  We finally saw a food runner and asked him to get our waitress.  A few minutes later, another guy who we hadn't seen came to see what we needed, not our waitress.  It was like she was avoiding us.  The guy brought our check out.  Of course it was wrong.  The omelet I had ordered was a BYO omelet including your choice of three ingredients plus cheese.  I didn't add anymore than that, but was charged $1.50 for avocado and $.50 for tomato twice.  I went inside to find someone to fix it and our waitress was just standing there behind the counter and didn't even acknowledge me.  Another waitress had to come see what I needed. I worked in a restaurant and understand that being a waitress is a hard job.  But when the restaurant in not busy and I can see you just standing around and purposely ignoring us, that is not acceptable.  Even if it wasn't your fault that the food was wrong, it is still your responsibility to apologize and see if we need anything once our new food has arrived.  Will not be returning.  The food is decent, but definitely not worth putting up with the worst service I've experienced in a long time.",-0.9824,0.855,0.038,0.107,0.45335858585858585

So you can't order online and you can't phone in your order. Only way you can order on the weekends is to go in there, order, and come back and pick it up. Nice. Actually it is not nice at all. That said, this is what I love about Sarks: they have amazing French toast, and their scrambled eggs are often sublime. You get so much bacon in an order it is almost obscene, and their special grilled cheese (which comes with three kinds of cheese, bacon and a fried egg) is fantastic.  Nice bonus: Charlie, one of the servers, is an absolute doll!

If you don't feel like reading the rest of this review because it's long, here's what you need to know: They claim they have ""the best breakfast in the world,"" but I have had numerous breakfasts at the golden nugget that were better than the one I had at Sarks.  Now, if you'd like to proceed to my lengthy review, go for it: I'm not basing my star rating on this, but I'm not a fan of the hipster-y vibe I got from Sarks. The music is fine, but not what I want to listen to when I want to have a nice breakfast (even if it is an afternoon breakfast). Usually I don't notice the music playing because it's at a low enough volume so patrons don't get annoyed. This time I definitely noticed the music, which got louder and louder the longer we were there. Also, the place is small. Really small. I think they had less than 10 tables in there. We didn't have to wait at all, which was nice, but I definitely understand why Sarks isn't more popular. Now, I was really looking forward to some french toast, but unlike most of the breakfast places around here, Sarks only has the high fat syrup that my body can't handle. So I was disappointed, but that's life. I'm used to having to skip things with syrup. Instead I ordered 2 eggs sunny side up. The nice thing about Sarks is that it's less expensive than your average breakfast place. They also give you a decent amount of food. With my eggs I got 2 slices of toast and a GIANT helping of hash browns (which I can't eat). It'd be more impressive if the eggs were particularly good, but they were just okay. I'm not sure what the difference is between their eggs and others, but they just weren't that good.  Our waitress was nice, which is good. Not a lot of interaction, but she was pleasant and explained about the syrup, and patient when we had to think for a while about what to order.

Whereas Orange will probably have you standing around staring longingly at the plates of the seated people luckier than you. No frushi, no fancy pancake flights, or orange flavored coffee, but you will get a decent and filling omelet with a side of potatoes and hot coffee for not a lot of money. And you'll be in and out in less than 45 minutes. Which is good if you have to run to Home Depot to buy a bunch of stuff to fix up your apartment with because you're packing for a move that day and need to leave it looking spiffy. Not that happened to me this weekend or anything. The veggie omelet ain't bad. Stuffed full of cheese, mushrooms, broccoli, spinach and tomatoes. I opt for egg whites for a healthier alternative and I can't tell the difference. HUGE portion. Might be worth splitting one with your companion if you're just looking for a small nosh. The hash browns are all right. Not too greasy, crispy on the top.  The patio in the summer time is nice, although the place isn't really that impressive otherwise.

(Plus, the waiter at the next table apologized for the ""overdone toast"" as he handed over a plate of bread burned almost beyond recognition. How hard is it to redo an order of toast, for crying out loud? Why would you send that out?) Given my first experience there, though, I surprised I went back. I went there with a friend. Firstly, while we were waiting for an outside table, a newly arrived couple was allowed to sit at a table that we had been told was a bussing station. No one acknowledged the fact that we were already there, clearly waiting for a table. The kicker, though, was when my friend ordered her dish without tomatoes. Sure enough, when it FINALLY arrived, her lunch had tomatoes in it, despite the waitress's assurance that it would be no problem to remove them. She sent it back to the kitchen and when it re-appeared the tomatoes in the food were gone -- but, for some inexplicable reason, the kitchen had added a big scoop of tomatoes to the dish as a garnish!

2009-09-07,2.0,"Just tried out Sarks in the Park for brunch, today, and I had high hopes for it, but am sad to say that we will not be going back.   There were only 2 servers taking care of everyone, so the wait time for a table, for someone to show up to take your order, and for your food to show up was longer than just about any brunch place I've tried in Chicago.  We sat outside which was generally a good ambiance, though they kept changing the volume of their music coming out of the speakers, and for some of the songs, it was obnoxiously loud.   The coffee....AWFUL.  I am not a coffee snob by any stretch of the imagination, but this was bad.  I even tried to dilute the weird metallic taste with cream and sugar, but to no avail.   The menu was ridiculously limited...you can basically get a handful of omelettes or sandwiches...which is strange considering they claim the ""world's best breakfast"".  Sadly not. When our food finally did show up, it was mediocre...not bad, but not great.   I'm not really sure what this place is going to do once fall/winter roll around, considering just about all of their seating is outdoors...but with Orange right across the street, and Frances just 2 blocks north, I have a feeling they're going to be feeling the pain.",-0.9761,0.741,0.085,0.174,0.6637742504409172

2009-08-30,3.0,"Tried this place after hearing a lot of the hype.  I went alone on a very cool Saturday morning, so nobody was sitting outside on the patio.  I imagine this place gets pretty crowded later in the day (I went around 9:30-ish) and you can tell by how efficiently the place is run.  I was greeted immediately upon walking in and took a seat at the bar in the back.  I ordered the Disaster sandwich, and my server suggested the cheesy hash browns.  The food came out literally within two minutes of ordering...that is impressive.  The food, however, was simply average.  The sandwich was tasty but it wasn't much different than something I could have made while playing around in my kitchen on a weekday morning.  The hashbrowns were good but somehow overcooked (not sure how that is even possible considering how quickly the food came out).  The best part about both the sandwich and the hashbrowns were the cheese (which I had trouble identifying but was great) and the seasonings on each (definitely a hint of cinnamon in there).   Service was super-friendly; my server checked on me every few minutes and had me out and on my way quickly.  Would come here again, but not worth traveling to if you're not directly in the area.",0.928,0.85,0.107,0.043,0.5111375661375661

Finally, this is a good summer place and I'm sure their food will be equally good in fall and winter but the place is very small and they will not be able to accomodate the crowds they now serve.",0.9816,0.776,0.204,0.02,0.5453798185941042

Very similar to waffle house hash browns if you're a fan.  I ordered the disaster sandwich with egg (over easy), but it was a bit overcooked, more like a fried egg.  The cheesy hashbrowns were definitely to die for! But like I said, you have to be in the mood for greasy, cheesy, yummy goodness.  O they also ran out of ice when we were there around 11:30am so be prepared for that if you like ice in your drinks.   I felt like I was 5 lbs heavier when I left.  Some of my friends had the french toast, which was pretty good and the mexican omelet was also favored. I think the disaster sandwich was definitely the favorite. But don't forget the egg and cheesy hashbrowns!

2009-07-30,3.0,"Really torn between 3 and 4 stars on this one, because they're *almost* there, but not quite. From the moment we descended down the stairs and one of the servers ran up to help us with the stroller, I thought, ""wow, awesome.""  The service continued to be good throughout ordering, and every employee I encountered was smiling and friendly.  So far so good, right? The food just wasn't a home run for me, though.  They did screw up my order, but I made do.  Our server did realize right away that it was wrong and asked me if I wanted it fixed, and I declined and just tried to scrape off as much as I could.  But screw up aside, it was kind of blah.  I just got a burger, and it was nothing special.  My friend got the veggie sandwich (the special name escapes me at the moment), and she was pretty happy with it.  For $5, you really can't complain I guess.  (*note - if you order a sandwich, it's just a sandwich.  No sides - side can be ordered for an extra cost.) We sat outside, which was perfect.  When I went inside to use the restroom, I noticed the space is kind of small, but they did what they could with it - they have the long benches on either side, with tables and chairs.  They also have room at the bar to sit - but less than 10 seats.  Throw in a couple flat screen tv's playing sports, and I can see where this might be a nice late night spot. Bathrooms are TINY and awkwardly set up.  But again, with the space constraints they had to work with, I guess they did what they could. Hours are pretty good - open til 9 during the week and open until 2/3am on Friday and Saturday nights.  So if you're wasted and in need of some breakfast food, Sarks is a good option. The menu is pretty small, and I'm hoping they expand it just a little bit to offer up some more options.  I feel like with a bit more tweaking this could be a great neighborhood spot.",0.9946,0.737,0.188,0.075,0.5766242155777039
2009-07-29,2.0,I was really excited to try this restaurant because all my friends went to the one near Wilmette when I was in high-school. I never went because I didn't have a car in high-school and it was hard to get there with public transportation. I enjoyed my Loretta sandwich. The hashbrowns did not really tasted cooked. My sister ordered the freshly squeezed orange juice but insists that it was bottled because there was no pulp. She usually has a good sense of taste so I am going to believe her. Service was extremely slow. I am a very patient person but this place was slow. This family next to us was about to walk out of the place. The big man at their table (I think the dad) spoke to a manager and he was given coupons to the restaurant. The manager claimed that there was a new cook and that their meal would be out within 10 minutes. I think it took longer than that. Who knows though because I was sort of in a breakfast waiting trance.  The waitresses looked really stressed and kept apologizing to us. We weren't even complaining. They brought us free beverages. This was nice. Maybe the place will pick up the pace once it has been opened for awhile. I think I will hit up some of my other favorite breakfast places before going to Sarks again.,0.9427,0.862,0.101,0.038,0.45189393939393935
2009-07-27,1.0,"My boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday morning and were excited to sit outside in beautiful weather. The wait to sit was not too long, so I thought were on to a great start. We looked through the menu and nothing looked outstanding. I considered an omelet, but then the waitress informed me that all of their items are a la carte, so I opted for two eggs, since they came with toast (no hashbrowns, however). About 15 minutes AFTER we placed our order she informed us that the wait for food would be 30 minutes. Really? That long to cook some eggs? Since we had already placed our order, we said that was fine.  A whole 40 minutes later, we decided it was not fine. We asked her how long it would be and she said five more minutes. Well, 15 minutes later, and we were still waiting. By this point, my boyfriend and I were pretty pissed and probably wouldn't have enjoyed the food, so we got up and left. I'm not sure how the food is, but I do know that breakfast should not take that long to cook.

2009-07-27,3.0,"Went to Sarks in the Park on a Sunday morning around 8 AM for breakfast and the restaurant was pretty empty. Definitely got really crowded while we were leaving, so we luckily beat the rush. The breakfast menu is relatively small, containing eggs, omelettes, french toast and pancakes. Prices range from $5 for two eggs and french bread toast to $6.50 for french toast and pancakes and $7.50 for omelettes. I was disapointed that the omelettes did not come with hash browns, as you have to order them seperately for $2.00. Overall, I though Sarks was kind of overpriced for the food you get, but the atmosphere of the restaurant was clean and modern, and the outside patio a level below Fullerton was very cool",0.8952,0.887,0.102,0.011,0.4152222222222222

When the food arrived it did not arrive at the same time. It arrived at three different times by three different people. After our partial order had arrived the waitress had to ask a member of our party to repeat his order so she could put it in again. The wait staff is disoriented and under-trained.  As for the food, it was average at best. The portions and quality did not justify the price. I wouldn't suggest this restaurant.
