2016-06-22,2.0,"I reviewed Pork Shoppe before and am revisiting after another meal there.   The brisket and beans were really very good. The brisket is flavorful, well seasoned, and tender.  The beans were tangy, savoury, and all around a win. Their cole slaw is still strange, but tastes good. It definitely has raisins in it and I think pineapple also, but the color isn't right.  Whatever it is is pinky-orange.  I think I'd actually really enjoy the cole slaw if a) I knew WTF the mystery fruit was and b) the cabbage wasn't cut so terribly.  The pieces aren't large enough to be easily stabbed with a fork, aren't small enough that a bunch can fit between between fork tines, and are large enough that they don't easily stay on the fork en route to your mouth.  Basically it's really awkward to eat.   .lww The potato salad actually tastes good, but the potatoes were underdone.  Not quite raw, but DEFINITELY more al dente than most would be used to in potato salad  We got two sections of ribs in our order.  One was delicious, the other was burned (and I enjoy char, so I don't knowsay things are burned lightly) and extremely dry. I think that this place suffers from a lack of consistency maybe?  If the owners want to reach out, I'm more than happy to provide more feedback and would be happy to revisit if they revise anything.",0.9908,0.675,0.232,0.093,0.5878874934589221

We ordered Texas brisket tacos with tangy sauce and I really liked them. I would like to try the other sauces at some point as well. We also order a side of mac n cheese, it was perfectly creamy and tasty, my only complaint would be that it was loaded with breadcrumbs. Just too many. We also got the brisket sandwich which was also really good (the bread got a little soggy in travel), so we can officially confirm that they make darn good brisket.  On the side we got baked beans and creamy cole slaw. The baked beans were sweet and delicious. The creamy cole slaw was super bland though and I won't be ordering that again.

2015-09-28,5.0,"Pork Shoppe... you had me at hello! My boyfriend and I got on a serious BBQ craze after having some smoked wings on a trip.  We  order a lot of food delivery so over a few weeks, with this barbecue addiction weighing on our souls, we ordered from about every barbecue place in Chicago, receiving disappointing order after disappointing order!  The BBQ fever could not be quenched and we almost gave up hope until one fateful day... when Porke Shoppe showed up in my Grub Hub search. I have to say that barbecue places are out of control with their pricing.  Fat Willy's, Smoke Daddy, Lilly's Q, yeah, I'm looking at you.  You'll easily spend $60 or $80 bucks on delivery for a couple of pulled pork sammies and some sides from these places and that seems like a lot for what I would consider simple food.  What gives?  However, breathe easy, because Pork Shoppe is so affordable that I seriously wonder if they are making any money! At this point we have ordered from there like 7 times (no joke, in about a month!) and every single goddamn thing I've gotten has been delicious.  The portions are not small either!  Here is my rundown: Brisket Taco for the low low price of $1.95 - awesome, you could have 3 of these for dinner and be happy. Pulled Pork, Steak or Brisket Sammies - awesome, large, the sauces are delicious (the smoky sweet is my fave) Sides:  The french fries are really good.  I bet they are amazing in house (haven't been to the location yet) because they arrive that good for delivery.  The baked beans with burnt ends are delicious.  The salad is surprisingly big and fresh for a side salad.  The corn on the cob is fresh (not frozen, not overcooked, not mushy!).  Oh and my boyfriend loves the mac & cheese. I heart you, Pork Shoppe.  And FYI, you can charge at least .50 or .75 cents more for that taco, hell, for everything.  It's really good and the prices are crazy compared to the rest of the city.",0.9929,0.757,0.179,0.064,0.6048387096774194

I've had a few things but seem to enjoy their pulled pork and pulled chicken sandwiches best. I like going at lunch time before 4pm as then for a good deal you can get the sandwich, fries and a pop.  Their fries are surprisingly way above average! I absolutely loved them! Their meats are pretty good, too. They aren't dry though I honestly wish there could be a bit more moistness to them. Of course slather on some sauce and you should be all good. Both their sweet and tangy sauces are tasty to me buds.

Unfortunately I got it mixed up with Pork Chop which I heard was good from friends so BBQ it was.  Step in right before a Bulls game and it was empty. They had a rib tip special which I've been fennin for since Honey 1 moved, so I had to check it out. I also got some steak and pork belly.  Everything was disgusting. The rib tips were flavorless and dry. The steak was unbelievably tough, I moreso expected something like the tri-tip from Lillie's Q. This tasted literally like microwaved beef chuck. Astonishingly bad. The pork belly was at least edible, but it was too salty and didn't go well with the BBQ sauce. Also, all three BBQ sauces I had were terrible.  For some reason they stuffed all of the food in those aluminum take-out containers with sauce and heated it up. That made everything taste like microwaved leftovers. Completely repulsive. The Mac and Cheese was completely flavorless. No hints of cheese at all, I seriously can't believe yelpers like this side. The cole slaw was marginally better, and I personally appreciated the bits of mango. I have never in my life had BBQ this bad. Maybe it's my fault for deviating from the BBQ classics, if I every come to this establishment again I'll stick to ribs and pulled pork.",-0.0063,0.773,0.111,0.115,0.5947845804988662

2015-05-25,5.0,"I have a feeling that BBQ and bourbon were on Julie Andrews' list of ""a few of my favorite things,"" after she put those kids to bed. They must have been getting on her nerves. Likewise for the nuns, while they were in the midst of having to ""solve a problem like Maria."" Seems like everyone would have needed some down-home relaxation. My friends and I certainly loved the down-home relaxation at the Pork Shoppe. On a Saturday night, having read the Yelp about it, I expected it to be crowded. Then again, it was Memorial Day weekend, and I'm sure that some meat hunters had made their way to Wisconsin. It's a bit of a pain to get here by public transportation, but a Divvy from the Blue Line in the summer air was a welcome chance to exercise-off at least a quarter rib.  And the ribs did shine. We had the combination baby back and St. Louis style. I still prefer the backs (nothing against the arches of S. Louie). It's nice that they arrive with the dry rub and you can add the sauces to your liking--a choice of sweet, tangy, and spicy (luckily, spicier than most places, and while not especially spicy, with a great flavor-to-""it's-too-hot-I-can't-taste-anything"" spicy).  A nice chew to them as well--no pre-boiling here. Many of the sides were fantastic as well. The man knows how to cook fries to a nice crispiness, the mac & cheese had a wonderful au gratin on top, and the cornbread was also the bomb (complete with a tasty, whipped butter). The beans were good, but nothing to write home about. I'd tell you about the cole slaw, but I would have had to kill myself (I'm not a big cabbage fan).  Now onto the bourbon. A bevy to choose from (including a Rye, Templeton); I hope a BBQ sommelier would approve of the the smooth Woodford I sipped. Don't expect any other spirits or many mixers, other than the carbonated variety; or any other alcohol that isn't carbonated (i.e., beer only, no wine). But that's fine by me. I like that the counter service saves a little cash on tips, and that one of the owners was there taking orders, serving and cleaning up as well. Very nice guy--I wish that all local businesses demonstrated such high-quality and humbleness to their crafts. Now an aside to you biker pedalers: If you've ever ridden the RAGBRAI bike ride across Iowa, the name of this place (Pork Shoppe) may remind you of the pork chop guy on the route. Pork Choooooop!!!

I would have taken a picture, but it smelled so good that I didn't waste any time taking one.  Let me tell you, the pork belly pastrami is AMAZING. Super tender and juicy thick bacon, and I didn't even put any sauce on it.  It had that awesome smokey flavor that stays on your fingers for a couple of hours.  My bf and I were supposed to split the sandwiches in half and share, but I just ended up eating the pastrami myself.  If he wants to try it, he'll just have to get his own next time!

Third, the coleslaw.  They  charge a buck and a half for a paper tray of it, and  it HAS RAISINS IN IT! Tastes like dessert  when what you want is a complimentary side that counters the spiciness of the que. But someone must like it, or it wouldn't be on the menu. Fourth, the fries. The best part of the meal.  Order well done for crispy ones. So to sum it up, I  spent over ten bucks for a pulled pork sandwich fries, coleslaw and a can of pop.

Juicy-J I guess.  (2) The bun was a wonderfully lightly crisped cloud of happiness.  The sandwich options are a good deal, since they come with sides.  I will definitely be hitting that up in that next time I come through.  I see you, sandwich. *wink* The brisket had some commendable flavors of smokiness and beefiness.  It is like a half step down from Green Street's brisket... but still  good.  It's really not a huge strike against them though, after all, they are called ""PORK Shoppe."" ::SIDES:: First and foremost, corn bread.  I am suspicious that their corn is laced with some magical drug that makes it so tasty... But regardless, just get it.  At least it can be an affordable addiction.   The other sides were just above average.  If I had to grade the baked beans and mac & cheese I'd give them both a ""Meh +""...   I imagine the sides to be what Paula Dean would give her frenemies.  You know, good enough to keep them close - but bland enough to make them know they aren't on her level.    The area is very unassuming but it makes for a relaxing/chill meal since it will not be completely packed like Smoque or Green Street.  So stretch out your dancer legs and get comfortable in the vibe of good meat offerings and a decent bourbon/ beer list.",0.9782,0.848,0.122,0.03,0.4751792114695341

I got the beef brisket with a side of chili and sweet/spicy corn bread and then on top of that, the Texas brisket taco daily deal. All of that (note: huge portions for both sides) was only $13, tax included, and 2.5 nights worth of dinner.   The super yummies: Corn bread with honey butter - literally one of the best I've had ever. A must-get! It's more sweet than spicy but you can't miss that hint of spiciness thrown in there.  The pretty good: Brisket - tender, soft, lots of brisket, and pretty flavorful by itself (although the tangy sauce really adds to it as well). Chili - on the verge of too soupy for me but there's a smokey taste to it and the chunks of beef thrown in are an added bonus.  Skippable/just don't get - I don't know if it was an off day or something (especially given how good everything was) but the biggest disappointment was the Texas brisket taco.

They said we could order but then we'd have to stand with our food until a table freed up. Then the lady at the register got yelled at by a manager because she was taking orders when there weren't tables open. So eventually we just had to wait around at the register...20 minutes later we got a table and then after another 20 we got our food.  It wasn't the wait that bothered me, but the fact that they were super disorganized and not nice about it at all was really annoying. They even messed up our order and then made it seem like a HUGE hassle to fix it and give us the right sides.

Second, and more importantly, the food has been really freaking great.  I love that they do the standards well (i.e. the aforementioned brisket), but also mix it up with things like pork belly pastrami, beef pastrami, tacos, etc.  And yes, those two pastramis are worth the price of entry alone, especially the pork belly.  Tender, rich, smokey, and peppery.  It really doesn't need anything except the buns (i.e. meat delivery devices)...although occasionally I'll put a touch of sauce on it. The sides I've had are pretty great for the most part too: good mac and cheese, very good sweet and spicy corn bread, and the chili is really spicy and pretty excellent too I only have two (slight) negatives: one, the burnt end baked beans.  They were a little watery.  Not horrible, but not great.  Also, the sauces are just ok and don't have a lot of character.  The sweet was probably my favorite, but even that was a little too sweet (although it goes excellent with the fries).  The other sauces are just meh.   That said, bad bbq'ers cover up their flaws with sauce; and the good ones let the meat speak for itself.  Pork Shoppe definitely falls into the latter.",0.9976,0.69,0.257,0.053,0.5462175324675325

2014-03-07,4.0,"Just went here last night.  Solid neighborhood place, and really happy to find something so tasty that is so near Roscoe Village!  We had the pulled pork sandwich and the 1/2 rack (plenty big) St. Louis ribs (the meatier, fattier cousin to the baby back cut).  Everyone has an opinion regarding what constitutes proper BBQ, and I am no exception.  Friendly and cozy inside.  Beer and bourbon to drink--hey, the best BBQ places I've been to don't even have a liquor license, so this is a bonus.   If this was the South (where I grew up), I would give it 3 stars--everything could have been a little more succulent/juicy, but the rubs were fantastic and there was a good smoke flavor.  Up here in Chicagoland, BBQ is a little more dry and places the emphasis on the rub over the sauce, i.e. sauce is an optional condiment here.  Sweet slaw isn't what I'm used to, but I enjoyed the raisins and pineapple twist.  Sweet and spicy cornbread is very good, but made awesome by the sweet honey butter accompaniment (you gotta put it on every bite).  Fries are the awesome salty greasy spoon style that I like.  I would recommend their tangy sauce for the pulled pork, and their sweet sauce for the ribs (although unnecessary).  Definitely going back for the beef brisket and to try out the rest of the menu.  Prices and portions were very reasonable.  They deliver, too!",0.9971,0.745,0.249,0.006,0.5405747126436782

I ordered a few things in case I didn't like something. The St. Louis style ribs, I really enjoyed. They were very delicious and cooked perfectly for my taste. I also ordered beef brisket. OMG! For you Simpson fans, you know how Homer eats a donuts? That's how I felt with the brisket, can't eat too much though it seemed very rich to me.  Where Pork shoppe failed for me was with the sides. I had mac'n cheese, which I never ever want to eat again.The potato salad was pungent with a taste I both like and dislike at the same time. The french fries were decent. I did not care for the BBQ sauces either. I had the sweet, and the tangy sauces. However, good BBQ does not need sauce and I didn't need it.

Prices were decent for the quantity and delivery was on time, although not quick by any means. From there, however, it went downhill.  Unfortunately food was very mediocre. Split a variety of meats- pulled pork, chopped brisket, baby back ribs and pastrami. All except the pastrami were incredibly dry (almost reheated dry) and extremely bland- apparently no dry rub/sauce finish used. 1/2 rack of ribs was closer to a quarter rack. Pastrami was a welcome surprise- kind of like a thick-cut bacon.  Sauces are unique- they grew on me, but I've definitely had better. Honey-jalapeno cornbread is great, mac & cheese good and the fries were good inasmuch as they were not soggy. Coleslaw is a mixture of raisins and pineapple in standard cabbage/mayo- not really a fan.

The sides here are great.  All combo meals come with the option of two sides.  I highly recommend their mac'n'cheese!  It's creamy, gooey, and doesn't taste like it was made from a box.  They offer up huge portions too!  Their cornbread is awesome.  It's served with honey butter (just like mama used to make)! With every order you can pick one of three sauces.  Sweet n Sticky sauce is very sweet and molasses based.  Tart n Tangy is probably my favorite;  It's vinegar based and tastes great with the meats.  Their Wicked Spicy sauce is just TOO spicy for me!  It would be nice if they offered more sauce options. For dessert:  Key Lime Pie.  You won't be disappointed. I order delivery here often, and it is always very QUICK and CONVENIENT (check them out on Grub Hub!).  Once they forgot to include a soda I ordered, and with the next order they gave me the soda I ordered along with two of their giant cookies!  Their customer service is really great. Summary:  Great place for BBQ without extra frills and extra attention to ambience.  Delivery is great.  I'd only suggest they offer more variety of sauces and were OPEN LATER!  :)",0.9959,0.773,0.203,0.023,0.6416666666666668
2013-07-21,4.0,"Yum! Definitely the best barbeque I've had in this area (made the mistake of trying Big Bricks last week - yeck).  We got lunch specials 1 (2 brisket tacos, fries and drink) and 4 (half rack of ribs, mac'n'cheese and drink).  Everything was great - tasty meat (flavorful and no globs of goopy fat), delicious HOMEMADE mac'n'cheese (not the atomic yellow straight-from-package stuff I've been shocked and dismayed to be presented with at other places), crispy well-seasoned fries, good sauces.  Happy that it's serve yourself sauce, so you can try them all (and have as much as you want!).  The staff were very personable and friendly too.   The prices were average, and with the lunch specials even better.  It's not dirt cheap, but it's not crazy expensive either, and the portions were filling (well, for a normal size person - my lumberjack sized partner bought three additional tacos, but at $2 each didn't break the bank).  For everything - the two specials + three extra tacos - it was about $25.  It's probably a little more at dinner since there are the specials, but still seemed pretty decent.  Also as another reviewer mentioned, there are no servers (you get your own silverware/bus your table/etc), so that probably reduces cost a little, plus you save a few bucks on tip. Very casual atmosphere, plus no TVs or blasting music, although beer and bourbon are available. I will be back!",0.9644,0.817,0.133,0.05,0.50859375
2013-07-16,4.0,"A  fine example of the casual barbecue establishment.   I appreciate the no-frills counter-service setup:  keep the prices down and let me fetch my own silverware, condiments, tap water, and whatnot.  The napkins are a big roll of brown paper towels. This statement is a long time coming:  I have finally found a barbecue spot with awesome macaroni and cheese!  Pork Shoppe's is actually creamy, not pasty and glutinous, and actually tastes like cheese.  It helps that it comes out hot. In addition, the pulled pork and the pork belly pastrami are both very tasty options.  And since the latter is unique among my barbecue history, it is probably one of the best reasons to visit.  It's like thick, delicious bacon with less smoke and salt.  I can't give my support to the baby back ribs, though; they seemed overcooked, with some charred edges and tough meat.  Their sweet variety of sauce definitely helps to rehabilitate a weak offering though.  In fact, the sweet sauce goes well with everything. Sides are clearly NOT an afterthought here!  For example, the fries are a generous serving of quality, hand-cut, skin-on variety; the cole slaw is ambitious, and although I personally don't care for the inclusion of mango and raisins, as a cole slaw connoisseur I have to appreciate any outfit that tries to do something different with this often-bland staple. Plus they sell a giant dill pickle for only 95 cents. I would love to tell you about the rib tips, but they are hard to track down.  Once I visited on a Saturday midafternoon and they were sold out already.  The last two Sundays I called ahead around noon to find out if rib tips were available, and they told me that the tips were still in the smoker and wouldn't be ready until the evening.  So I really have no advice for how to predict the availability of rib tips.  Head on in and spin the wheel; even if you are s.o.l. on rib tips there are many other tasty options.",0.9602,0.839,0.119,0.041,0.5127777777777778

I almost feel like the food has gotten better every time we have ordered. The prices are reasonable and the give you pretty large portions for the cost. They have the best rib tips I have ever had and the brisket sandwich is amazing. As far as sides go, you really can't go wrong. The mac and cheese, potato salad, and cornbread are some of our favorites though. The sweet and sassy sauce is also a personal favorite. We ordered through grubhub today, and delivery was fast, but a couple of our sides were missing. I called the restaurant, and the man on the phone was very friendly, polite and apologetic. He had a delivery driver sent out with our missing items (and they arrived very promptly), and also threw in a complimentary key lime pie. He also offered to call grub hub and have them adjust the cost of our order (they took $10 off, which wasn't necessary, but was greatly appreciated).  All in all, no complaints about Pork Shoppe.

So I was happy to say that Pork Shoppe does not fall under one of my places to never eat BBQ again list. I had the pulled pork sandwich with fries and a pickle. Also got a Stiegl to go with it. Pulled pork was perfectly tender and juicy, fries were delish, and if you're a pickle fan, consider yourself satisfied. The price was perfect for the portion, I'd even say cheap. If you go to Smoke Daddy or Fat Willy's you'll definitely end up spending more money for the same thing. Also, service was perfect. All in all, I'd say at least try it out.

2013-06-12,3.0,"Meh. I would probably give this place 2.5 stars, if Yelp allowed half star ratings.The service was pretty good, but the food was just so-so.  The place is cute and simple and I liked the atmosphere. The man who took our order was personable and friendly. The problem is, the food just wasn't great. I'm a BBQ junkie, so I was very excited to see a BBQ place close to my neighborhood that also delivered. So when I was driving by with my cousin and friend, we needed to stop in.  I debated between the brisket sandwich and the pulled pork sandwich, and asked the guy behind the counter which one he liked better. He said I had to have the pork, since they are the Pork Shoppe, after all. I wish I would have trusted my instincts and gotten the brisket instead. I also upgraded the sides to mac n cheese and burnt end beans, because fries didn't sound all that appealing to me. For the sandwich, sides, and a can of soda, the total was $14. Ouch, a bit pricier than I expected. But I wanted to sample some things, so I sucked it up.  My friend got the brisket sandwich and stuck with the fries and a huge pickle. They also have a jug of water and cups in their dining area, so you don't have to buy a drink. His bill was much more reasonable. When the food came out, everything looked good. There was a tin of mac and cheese, that I definitely couldn't finish on my own, as well as a decently sized container of beans. The buns on the sandwiches were also very good. I had a problem with the burnt end beans, which is probably my own fault, since burnt is in the name. I expected the meat to be crispy and have intense flavor, like it usually does when you grill it at home. Instead it was just burnt. Charred to a crisp and bitter, which gave the whole thing a bitter taste. I know some people who love this flavor, but I am not one of them. The other seasonings were decent, but not good enough to make up for the bitter taste. I had this same problem with my pulled pork sandwich. Dry with burnt pieces which were very bitter. I had to drown it in BBQ sauce to make it palatable. The non-burnt pieces tasted okay, but I feel like BBQ sauce should compliment already delicious meat, not drown out sub-par meat. Speaking of BBQ sauces, I was so sad when I tasted their ""Tangy"" sauce. It is supposed to be North Carolina style. I love North Carolina style BBQ sauce, and it is so hard to find. But this was just a vinegar based BBQ sauce. None of the mustard deliciousness that is typical of the North Carolina sauces. The ""Spicy"" tasted mostly like chili powder and maybe cumin? Not the Texas style I was hoping for either. It had a decent bite though. The ""Sweet"" was their best. It wasn't overly sweet and had a decent smokiness and flavor. It was pretty good, considering I don't usually care for ""Sweet"" sauces.  The mac and cheese was good. The crispy top helped save it. The crunch compliments it well, even though the mac and cheese itself isn't stellar. My friend's food, on the other hand, was much better. The beef brisket was still moist and had good flavor. The fries, were....well fries. Nothing to write home about, but they deliver what you would expect. And his pickle was giant. Overall, the place is just ok. I would stick to brisket if you're going to order, and don't bother paying for the upgraded sides. They just aren't that great. Maybe pay for the mac and cheese if you're really craving it. It will satisfy your craving but it won't blow you away. I also want to add, that I'm not sure why everything seemed so overly dry and burnt. I'm wondering if this is because we came in later in the evening? Maybe it is sitting on heat for too long and just starts drying out? Perhaps it would be better to try this place around lunch time, instead of dinner. **UPDATE** I was contacted by the owner, Mike, shortly after posting this review. He was very professional and genuinely concerned about the food quality and customer opinions. I'm bumping them to 3 stars for quick and professional response. I will give them another try at some point and post an update when I do.",0.9982,0.727,0.185,0.087,0.565355107855108
2013-06-11,1.0,"Okay, I am not a guy who reviews food joints. Enter and eat at your own risk. I am doing this because I just cannot believe these guys are open and I may save someones life. Someone needs to tell them that what they are doing is wrong on several levels. First of all, I missed North Centers Ribfest due to a prior commitment but I was determined to have BBQ this weekend and Pork Shoppe delivers, even though I told them all I had was a $100 bill so please bring change and the delivery guy had none! I ordered a slab of St. Louis and my wife had had a brisket sammy. We got a big side of beans w/burnt ends, slaw, cornbread, fries and a sampler of each of their sauces. The ribs were tender, off the bone type that visually made me think I was in for a treat. To my suprise though, they were almost flavorless. The rub was heavy on chilli powder, some brown sugar and Hadley any smoke flavor. I tried to make them palatable with the house sauces and found two of them just foul and one just barely edible. I love a nice tangy slaw with my BBQ. It should compliment the meal.. Pork Shoppe slaw was like a carrot salad or some kind of dessert salad. Almost like candy and in no way compliments any part of the meal except to wash the taste of the beans out of your mouth. I have had burnt ends from Cancun to Niagara Falls Canada, I love them and in Kansas City, a burnt end is Manna from heaven but where ever you go, a burnt end is the best part of the brisket. Pork Shoppe beans with burnt ends were missing something, mainly the burnt ends. There were some unidentifiable bits of meat but hardly a burnt end that I have ever had the pleasure of eating. The beans themselves were gritty with chili powder and their version of a spice bouquet. They would have fa ired much better in the bean department if they simply opened a can of the old school ""pork-n-beans"". The cornbread came baked in a tin about the size of a Swanson pot pie. The dark brown color of the bread made me think ""well done"" and It sure seemed like it was. Dry and gravelly with a bit of heat but still lacking in the natural sweetness of corn. My wife and I looked at their menu on line and they have a gallery of food items that they serve. Their brisket sandwiches are very photogenic, if a picture is worth a thousand words, their gallery pics say delish!  We pinned all the hope we had for this meals sucess on this last, unopened item. One thing for sure about The Pork Shoppe, they are consistent. The sammy was thrown together like it was made during a fire drill, looking nothing like the mouth watering picture and it met all  Pork Shoppe criteria for dryness and flavorless. One thing for sure is that my wife and I have explosive diarrhea and since that is the only meal we shared since thursday we are certain where it came from.         BBQ is a celebration of simplicity. Fire, smoke and meat. Simple, time tested side orders. They have been passed down for generations and it is a very fine line that separates the good from the bad. I have had both as I am sure any BBQ fan has. I found that the worst BBQ comes from over thinking what should be simple. Like using a graphing calculator to do simple addition. If Pork Shoppe does not rethink their menu, I don't see them open past October. There is great BBQ in Chicago, and the cream will always rise to the top and right now, Pork Shoppe is nothing but a boat anchor.

Location: 4 out of 5 At one of the sixers, (Cali, Elston, Belmont), the one nice thing about PS is that there is free parking in the back.  If you come at the right time, the parking lot is uncrowded, and after stuffing your face with pig, you can go to beer temple before heading home.  Public transportation is not out of the question as the blue line is not too far, and there is frequent bus service on either Belmont or California, depending on where you're coming from. Décor: 4 out of 5 Love it.  No frills place, unlike Chicago Q.  Counter service with wooden benches, tables, and chairs.  You rip the industrial paper towel rolls from a holder on the wall, and there's a little TV in the front area where you can watch whatever happens to be on.   Selection of food: 5 out of 5 Why yes, I do like brisket.  And pulled pork.  And sausages.  And pork belly pastrami.  And chicken.  And fresh cornbread with fresh jalapenos baked in.  And mac and cheese.  You see what I'm saying here.  You have the classics, like the brisket and standard pulled meats.  But you also have one offs, like the pork belly pastrami (get it....) and of course, ribs.   Quality of food: 4.5 out of 5 Quite awesome.  Again, there are probably places out there who do a brisket and pulled pork just as good as Pork Shoppe, but I found both of these to be really good, particularly the brisket.  If you mix and match with the different sauces (hot sauce is outasight!), you'll get different flavor profiles.   Listen, the pork belly pastrami is going to have a good deal of fat in it.  Go easy on it, and savor.  No sauce.  Just eat it.  The sweet and spicy cornbread was an unexpected highlight, particularly with the fresh chunks of jalapeno baked right in, and the whipped honey butter.  Quite delightful.  The mac n cheese was familiar - I'd probably get it again but it didn't knock my socks off or anything. Selection of beer: 3.5 out of 5 PS does have beers in cans ranging from PBR to Big Sky and Shiner Bock.  There's probably something there that you wouldn't mind drinking with your meal, and you can always go for the bourbon if you'd like.   Price: 3.75 out of 5 Very reasonably priced.  The fiancé and I got the brisket, pulled pork, and pork belly pastrami a la carte (1/4 pound each), the cornbread, macncheese, and 2 beers each and the damage was under 45.  I mean, it's not cheap, but compared to other bbq places, it's not a bad deal either.  As an FYI, they do take the Level Up app, and I believe that the standard discount is 5$ after 50$ spent.   Service: 4 out of 5 It's hard to judge service when it's predominantly done at the counter, but the guys that were working did come around a few times and ask how things were and if we needed anything else.   Overall: 4 out of 5 Tasty pig and cornbread, refreshing beer, clean and friendly service.  I imagine that you might have to wait during times when they get most of their business, but I went on a random Thursday evening at 7pm and had no issues at all.",0.9986,0.813,0.163,0.025,0.528234126984127

We ordered a half slab of ribs (dry) and a pulled pork sandwich.  And all kinds of sides.  The ribs were indeed as promised, pretty fcking good.   The baked beans with burnt ends...also well worth the effort. Yes, I'd recommend Pork Shoppe.  Their aim is to provide good bbq in a low key way and they deliver.",0.9802,0.74,0.231,0.028,0.5760416666666667

The guy who took my phone order and rang me up when I picked up the order was very nice, easy going, and friendly. Sorry didn't get his name but great customer service. The food was great. Better than I expected. They use REAL smoke and fire for the BBQ which is far superior to any other way of doing BBQ, or faux bq as I like to call it. Ordered several items for myself and coworkers. Had the beef brisket......great great great. Did I mention it was great? Very flavorful and tender. The ribs, both cuts, were superb. Smoky and had that great char crust which I love. The brisket tacos were soo good. A little bland but add some sauce to kick it up, or put a squeeze of lime on it and your good to go. The brisket sandwich was large & delicious. The beans, while made well, I personally prefer a more sweet brown sugar style. The pickle was great to help cut through the flavor of the BBQ. The coleslaw was fair, has raisins which will turn some people away.  The fries were well made and not soggy. The sauces come in sweet, tangy, or spicy. Liked the first two, but to each their own. Finally the mac & cheese, very very good. Made with white cheese it was rich & creamy with a nice crumb topping. Even after sitting for awhile ( I was busy with the tacos) the mac came from a microwave reheat with nary a problem.  Note to owners: Make the portion size of the mac & cheese in a larger size please !! Both my coworkers raved about their food as did I.

And in the spirit of being considerate we would offer our large table near the window up for communal sitting. I only bring this up because knowing that this place is small and a little popular there was another large table at the window and four hipster dudes sat and watched one friend eat while the other three each sucked down a beer then just played with the can. They were there before us and stayed after us. Losers. But the workers should speak up because it got packed and they didn't even ask them nicely to be considerate. Enough about that though.

2013-03-07,4.0,"I should start this review out by saying that my meal was entirely free because my roommate had opened a bank account at North Community Bank and had a $50 gift card that she had some balance remaining on. We went to Pork Shoppe the night before moving her and my other roomie from Rockwell to our new place on Stave. So we were kind of exhausted from packing and prepping and what not. It was also POURING rain.  So we drove over from Rockwell and Logan Blvd. Got to park in their convenient, if not a little narrow, parking lot and get soaked on the 30 second walk to the front door. The place is tiny, and I'm glad we either beat the rush or were some of the few brave enough to venture into the elements that night. The lady at the register was super nice and put up with my sparking personality magnificently by laughing at my jokes and what not. I got the beef brisket, and wasn't sure what sauce I wanted, so the lovely hostess said she'd give me all three and I could try them. My roommate got the pulled pork sandwich and we both got sides (I forget...except I know one of them was the cornbread with honey butter). We got a cookie, contemplated getting a drink while we waited, decided to look at the awesome country decor instead. And our food was ready in about 5-10 minutes. We took it back into the rain and back to the place on Rockwell. The brisket was good. I've been spoiled by the beef brisket at Black Dog Smoke & Ale House in Urbana, IL. Sooooo unless a brisket is basically melting on my fork it won't be as good as THAT, but it was good. Tender enough. The sauces were all different, though I think I liked the sweet the most. The roommate's pulled pork was decent based on the one bite I took. Again...ruined by pulled pork sandwiches from this small shack (Bamboo) on the north end of the big island of Hawaii...no pulled pork has really lived up to that guy... The cornbread and honey butter were awesome. The cookie was monstrous and delicious.

2013-02-21,3.0,"I ate here last night and ordered the pulled pork sandwich, burnt end baked beans, and cornbread.  I wasn't impressed.  Now to be fair, I'm very critical over my barbecue - I LOVE barbecue and consider myself on the path of becoming a pit-master.  The pork was good, nothing out of this world.  I don't know how they mix it, but i didn't get any bark whatsoever, which is where all the flavor is, so it was pretty bland.  It was tender though so I'll give'em that.   I was pretty disappointed on the amount of pork I received though - I was expecting a heap of pulled pork that I would first have to eat with a fork to lower the mountain of meat, then slap on that top bun to finish'er off.  However, that was not the case - not only was there barely any meat , but it wasn't even enough to cover the bottom bun in it's entirety... weak Pork Shoppe, very weak.  Pork shoulder goes for around $1.30/pound so I think you can afford to put another scoop on your sandwiches...  If I knew this beforehand I would've ordered the half pound or full pound instead of the sandwich which didn't list the amount of pork but it couldn't have been more than a third of a pound.  I'm a grown man here, how is that suppose to fill me up?!  Luckily for me I ordered two sides. I had the Sweet BBQ sauce (one of three they offer) and it was okay.  Definitely helped with the lack of flavor of the pork.  The burnt end beans were not worth the extra cost and I wouldn't order them again.  The ""burnt ends"" tasted more like shredded Italian beef that they threw in the pot of beans.   The cornbread was actually pretty good.  It was a jalapeno cornbread which was interesting and came with a sweet honey butter to spread on it.  Together it was delicious and I'm glad I waited until the end to eat them since both the pulled pork and beans were a disappointment. I'll probably give them another shot and see how their ribs and brisket are, but as of now there are a few other barbecue joints that I prefer when I'm feeling lazy and don't want to put in the time to make my own.",0.9891,0.77,0.156,0.075,0.597459349593496

Get your cutlery, sauces, water, wet naps, condiments, paper towels...yourself. I ordered the pulled pork (1/4 lb) sandwich, macaroni and cheese, cole slaw, baked beans with burnt ends, and a Miller Lite. My dining partner ordered the St. Louis Half Rack of Ribs, fries, baked beans with burnt ends, and a Miller Lite. The pulled pork was well seasoned and tasted fantastic. The bun was soft and buttered. The macaroni and cheese was with shells (which I prefer) and had a bread crust topping. The sauce was not as thick or cheesy as I would like. Too creamy and thin. The cole slaw was too saucy. They put raisins and pineapple in it which is inventive but it was not a thing I'd order again and my partner who likes cole slaw much more than me didn't like it. We both liked the baked beans but weren't wowed. I almost felt if they used bacon or their signature pork belly in it it would be much more savory. The St. Louis Ribs were quite meaty and generous and needed not sauce. We agreed they were tasty. He liked his fries which were fresh cut. The sauces are Sweet, Tangy, and Spicy. I liked the Sweet best (it was thicker and had a smokiness to the sweet) and he liked the Spicy best (since he wanted a kick when he decided to dip his fries and ribs, I thought it was too thin and lacked complexity).

We tried the pulled pork, St. Louis style ribs, brisket, green bean salad and baked beans.  Tremendous flavor with no need for sauce.  This was the special thing for us.  At most BBQ places we feel like we have to drown everything in sauce to give the food flavor and to add moisture.  At Pork Shoppe everything was so perfectly seasoned and moist you don't even need the sauce.  The sauces were great though, particularly the spicy one. You can tell that the owners and cooks here know what they're doing.  It's a super well-run business, clean place, excellent service.  They make running a restaurant look easy.

I was really disappointed that an inferior product could actually be served to a paying customer. The brisket was questionable also. I understand a good dry rub but if you can not taste the meat under all the rub, that is a problem. Obviously, there are other items and I might give them a try, but if the ribs and brisket are any indication, who knows.",-0.9738,0.81,0.033,0.157,0.5383333333333333

However, for lunch a friend and I checked this place out on his suggestion and it was pretty darn fantastic. I had the baby back pork ribs, mac n' cheese and a beef brisket taco - just for good measure. All of it was really good. The ribs were meaty and the perfect amount of smoky and chewy. The mac n' cheese was maybe the best I've had. The taco was good, but entirely forgettable when compared to the other eats.  My only two complaints about this place are the prices and the service. This is like the new-wave coffee of BBQ joints. Ginger beards and tattoos galore. I SUPPOSE that it is a requisite of that persona is that you also have to be an a-hole. When you order the cashier stares at you blankly and when your food arrives, the server sort of throws it at you. Not too egregious, but enough to make me think to myself, ""what the F' is your deal?"" The prices too are a bit steep. BBQ is about taking a cheap, tough and fatty cut of meat and slow cooking the jesus out of it until it is fall apart tender. So, I really don't get when places want to charge $13 for  1/2 of pulled pork. Again, it's not too far fetched, but enough to mention it.  The Pork Shoppe isn't really all that close to me.

The Mac 'n Cheese and the Baked Beans were just as underwhelming as the meat.  The Mac 'n Cheese is made with some sort of sour tasting cheese that I couldn't put my finger on-definitely not the down home, creamy, comfort food type mac 'n cheese you hope for at a BBQ joint.  The beans were just kind of blah, nothing to them but too much salt.  The corn bread was actually ok with the sweet butter served with it, but nothing to rave about. What made this experience even more laughable was a comment an employee made to my fiancee while he was waiting for his order.  My fiancee was chatting while waiting for the food and commented that he was from Kansas City so he has had his fair share of BBQ.  The guy says ""Well, remember this is Chicago"".  Hahaha...seriously?!?  Aren't you supposed to be confident in the product you put out?  Isn't that why you would open a business in the first place??  It was just wrong from start to finish and if you are looking for great BBQ in Chicago I strongly urge you to try one of the many places better than Pork Shoppe.....(Chicago Q, Lillie's Q, Smoque, Smokey Bears, Fat Willy's, Sheffield's, Smoke Daddy... heck come on over to our place and we'll make you a better BBQ dinner than they can!)",0.96,0.812,0.112,0.077,0.62663082437276

Other two are just way too strong in weird non-bbq'y spices, which I obviously can't remember now. 2. Of the sides we had (fries, pickly, corn, beans, mac and cheese, coleslaw), fries and corn win. I'm always a sucker for creamed corn, and the fries tasted super fresh. The beans were starchy, mac and cheese was a little salty, and I didn't get to try the coleslaw bc I can't eat pineapple (travesty, I know.) the pickle was delicious, but shouldn't be its own side-- who can eat an entire pickled cucumber? it should just be a thing you get no matter what, and WAY sized down. Though the little girl next to me did think the giant pickle was amusing, though, if that counts for anything. 3. The meat! it was good. my bf scarfed down the ribs and I got hardly a bite. My brisket sandwich was good, though I'd have actually preferred more meat, less bread.  4. Ambiance was ... ok. We tried sitting at the bar, but the counter didn't go out far enough, so we moved to one of  the communal tables. It was fine, though very hard to get into. It would also be an improvement if there was paper towel rolls on each table and more bottles of the sauce (a little cup of sauce isn't amenable to properly dousing a sandwich.)  Overall?

I liked the plain white globe lights and mis-matched tables and booths. We chose a table in the corner, under a wagon wheel.  The menu looked good. Small, but good. I decided on the pulled pork sandwich combo. One of the choices listed as a side was corn on the cob, which that night was actually creamed corn. This is not a point in their favor for me, but the fries I ordered instead were so good, I'm not even gonna complain. My other side was a pickle and it was huge. The pork itself was among the best I've tasted. The bun was a delicious and beautiful bakery roll. The pork comes un-sauced and you have 3 kinds to choose from to do it yourself. I beleive they were a KC style sweet sauce, Carolina tangy, or Southwestern spicy. I went with sweet and tangy and both were very tasty.  We also ordered a side of the sweet and spicy corn bread which came with honey butter. It was so sweet, it could've been dessert. And that's a good thing! All in all, we paid $23 for 2 meals, the bread and drinks. It was affordable and tasty and I will be back. Oh, extra points for having a parking lot!",0.9963,0.76,0.235,0.005,0.5209435626102293

Belly. Pastrami.  Holy Crap. It's amazing. 10 day cured. Served hot or cold. 12 hr. smoked. If they have this in stock and you can handle the calories. Get it.  It's amazing.  Second: Cheap Bourbon and beer! We are talking $5 Makers, $5 Jack, $2 PBR. Golden.  They also have $2 High Life and $2 bud/miller light Third: The staff is super friendly and very accommodating.   We were constantly asked if our meal was good and how we liked everything.  Super cool dudes.  As for more food related things....  The slaw is different and great.  The creamed corn was amazing (if you like creamed corn) The last time I was there (last night) I got the pulled pork sandwich.  I love the fact that they let you put your own sauce on.  I hate places that come slopped with sauce that you can't even taste the meat.  Here they have a station where you can put your own sauce on and they have Tangy, Sweet and Spicy sauce.  Even without the sauce, the pork had a really nice smokey flavor.  The bun was a little too big for me (compared to the size of meat) but that is just a personal preference.  In all actuality I am more of a Platter person than a sandwich person.   The actual restaurant is pretty small.  We went on a Tuesday night and there was plenty of room, but I can imagine that this place packs up on the weekends.   oh- and they have sweet lunch deals too.",0.9966,0.748,0.206,0.046,0.5657638888888888

I haven't bothered to try anything other than the pork belly pastrami and the beef brisket tacos.  While the tacos are good, it wouldn't compel me to come back.  The pastrami just might.  While flavorful simply because of the fat, the meaty portion of the belly still clings to the brine, spices, and smoke it was made with.  Having grown up in Skokie, the tongue in cheek-ness of a pork pastrami is also quite hilarious to me. After sampling both the 1/4 and the 1/2lb options, the 1/2lb option is just a bit overkill, though in my opinion is the way to go.  However, while you do get to enjoy a large mouthful of the fat, salt, and smoke in every bite, somewhere close to the end of the sandwich you realize that it's just a wee bit too much after the initial endorphin rush subsides.  It's probably best to take a slice or two and share them with whoever you're with and greedily consume the rest of the sandwich.  While you've got the top off your sandwich, examine how your pastrami was laid out.  If all the fat is on one side, you'll need to do some rearranging.   Quick tip.  There is a parking lot for this place, but the entrance to it is easy to miss.  It's immediately to the left of the front building on Belmont.  So when you see the billboard, slow down and start scanning or you'll drive right by the tiny lot.",0.9815,0.843,0.12,0.036,0.46327711640211655

Does it hold up in value though? I ordered 2 beef brisket tacos for a total of $4 and change after taxes (credit cards accepted). Was it a great deal? NOPE! I didn't think this was a great value at all. I felt they were skimpy on the brisket, and the meat was completely un/underseasoned. Sadly, the sauces were quite underwhelming, as many reviews on here have alluded to. I think if they combined all three of their sauces (sweet, tangy, and spicy) then they would have a rather decent, though probably not spectacular, sauce.

I was able to add my own concoction of spicy & sweet sauce (there's also a 'tangy' sauce) to eat with my pulled pork and it was oh so delightful The bum was warm and not too starchy and the fries were nice and hot, not stale like they've been sitting under a heat lamp. The cornbread a a mix of bits of chili and with the honey butter it was a perfect compliment.  The food tastes really fresh dn the guys working there were super friendly and the place was clean and well kept!

Yes, it was Henry the Eighth up in here... I still have enough food left for at least two more meals. The mac and cheese was good; a bit salty but creamy. The baked beans were good, with a nice kick. The cornbread was very good, and came with some nice honey butter. I wasn't sure about the sauces so asked for all three, which they seemed to happily send. The tangy and spicy ones were good, the sweet one not so much. The ribs were fine, but nothing I would dream about at night. The fries were soggy and the corn on the cob was cold.  I asked for and received a delivery, which arrived earlier than they even quoted. That was a nice and welcomed surprise.

2011-08-22,5.0,"On my recent gastro-visit to Chicago this past weekend, I was excited to go try Hot Doug's. En route, we were caught in a pretty heavy thunderstorm and ended up getting drenched... and it only got worse - a multiple hour wait in the rain to try those dogs. Though I had already done my homework and was aware of the Pork Shoppe, my pops and I were surprised to find it literally at the bus stop we got off at to get to Hot Doug's... and boy did this come in handy. The Shoppe opened at 11... and we showed up in the pouring rain, looking for a dry place to be, at 11:15. And thank goodness we did! Now, let me preface the rest of the review by saying that we had some pretty mediocre BBQ the night before at the Barn & Company - a brand new ""smoke house"" that received a positive review from Tasting Table. (Here is my review of Barn & Company and you'll see why I put smoke house in quotes -  yelp.com/biz/barn-and-co… ) The guy working the register (who I assumed was an owner and I do regret not getting his name) was friendly and helpful. They didn't even mention the fact we practically flooded the place with our dripping clothing - a clear sign we were tourists since apparently Chicagoans are smart enough to avoid being caught out like that. So, we placed some orders.  We ordered the following: Pork Belly Pastrami sammich - AMAZING. 10 out of 10. Salty, smoky, with the right balance of delicious fat and meat... add sauce and it was another level. Pulled Pork sammich - also good. Very nice balance of smokey flavor, something that was completely missing from Barn & Company's BBQ. Cole Slaw - fantastic, included fruits like pineapple and raisins.. Beans - flavorful... another thing missing from Barn & Company's BBQ. Corn on the Cob - good and exactly what I expected. Fries - spiced and fried well. Sauces: Hot, Sweet and Tangy. Beer: the last Brooklyn Lager they had in stock and a few PBRs since the Shoppe was still waiting on their delivery. Most importantly, the food came out hot... something Barn & Company simply could not manage, even in two attempts.

2011-07-27,4.0,"1/4 lb. Pork Belly Pastrami 1/4 lb. Pulled Pork Pickle Miller High Life (on a previous visit, i had the brisket) Pork Belly Pastrami.  Really?  are you kidding me?  Wow, that's some delicious stuff.  However, i have to argue with one of the other reviewers that there was ""no greasy feeling"" or something to that effect. I'm not sure what they were eating, but i have yet to have pork belly prepared ANY WAY, that doesn't leave you with the glistening, slick inner lining of your mouth from the fat (which is good).  This is heavy, rich and fatty...but equally delicious and unique -  it's worth every bite (you're going to need an extra couple hours at the gym).  My suggestion...get the 1/4 lb, and share it with three other people (then order the pulled pork or whatever else you like for yourself individually as well. The pickle saves your life with the pastrami.  helps to cut that fat with the vinegar and crisp bite of refreshing cucumber. (high life doesn't hurt either) The pickles are your rudimentary deli pickle, but are perfect for the setting...and they're only a buck.  Just give the guy another buck (and the city and state $.10) and eat the pickle. Pulled pork - they have a really great rub.  It makes this more flavorful than others right out of the gate pre-sauce.  It's doesn't hurt to dab on a couple granules of salt (although i find that i seem to like that with most people's pulled pork - just a couple little granules of the inside most parts) and some of the spicy or tangy sauces.  The spicy sauce is probably my favorite.  Smoky, Earthy, and a little thicker than the tangy.  I like hot stuff, i mean really hot stuff, so i find that this sauce has a little kick, but nothing i would really deem spicy.  Even if you're afraid of hot stuff, you should be able to give this a try without running to Devon for a lassi.  I tried the sweet the first time i was there, and i think it was OK, it's just not my thing.  Other people at the table that like sweet, thick BBQ sauce liked it a lot. As far as the place goes, it's cool.  Easy, casual.  It's clean, small, and there's a bar if you're a single wanting to sneak in a sandwich during lunch or a busy evening.  Service is great, the same guy has been there both times I've been in, and he seems really cool, laid back, but intent on making sure you enjoy your experience.  He seems very proud of what they're doing, as he should be. I get what other people are saying about the Hot Doug's and Kuma's spillovers popping over to the Pork Shoppe, but i feel that their own merits are worthy of trips that involve traveling A to B with B being PS, not PS being C in the equation of A to HD or KC then backup to C.  I'm not saying they're going to be AS busy as either of the aforementioned anytime soon, but i wouldn't count on them just sitting around, waiting for leftover customers.  Pork Shoppe is good enough to have it's own crazed fan crowd.  Just go.",0.999,0.77,0.211,0.019,0.60040873015873

Though I am not a well-traveled BBQ aficionado, I do have another point of reference for the cuisine, Smoque in Chicago, so I'll use that for a comparison. Both places are what I guess you'd call upscale BBQ shacks -- no frills counter service eateries offering dine-in and carryout. PS serves bourbon and beer, a convenience for me (though I know many prefer Smoque's BYO status). The ambiance at PS is a little nicer, the tables/chairs more attractive and the light from the front window better -- Smoque is a bit grungier. We sampled beef brisket and pork belly pastrami. The brisket is good, but not quite as succulent as the world-class brisket at Smoque. The pastrami, however, is outrageous -- my eyes were rolling around in my head and my heart was thumping at the richness and flavor. I would recommend that everyone try the pork belly pastrami at least once in their life -- it is a transcendental experience. The sides we had were surprisingly good (and superior to Smoque's): the coarse-cut coleslaw was made with pineapple, raisins and a light dressing of mayo, and the salt/pepper fries, while not as crisp as I prefer, were very tasty and not soggy. Tangy sauce was our favorite, the spicy was OK if you like things hot (we did not sample the sweet sauce). Service was cordial and helpful, and there was no wait on an early Friday evening.

Kinda like when I go out for Thai and judge a place on their Tom Kha and panang curry, or pho at a Vietnamese place...we opted for two pulled pork sammys with fries and a soda.  I think with tax it came to $18?  Chunky and flavorful, like something that would result from smoking and cooking in my house for 12 hours but don't feel like making the effort. This was delightfully homemade.   Made with high quality meat, without being blanketed with palette suffocating hot sauce to mask the overly smoked sub-par meat.  no, not here. Fries were skin on, and double fried.  crispy, salty and delightfully fatty.

2011-06-04,4.0,"A barebones establishment that focuses more effort on their BBQ than their decor, that's what I'm talking about! The brisket is tender, smoked well and can hold its own in flavor even plain. That's a rarity. But should you choose to combine it with one of The Pork Shoppe's three self-serve sauces, you are treated to an exquisite flavor pairing that make the effort of getting and pouring sauce worthwhile. The pork belly pastrami starts out mellow and savory in your mouth, but ends with a tangy salty kick at the end as you are about to swallow. Pairs nicely with the tangy sauce. The french fries provided an excellent way to sample all of the sauces and of the Sweet, Spicy, and Tangy sauces The Pork Shoppe had to offer, the Sweet one caught my attention as both a dipping sauce and a spreading sauce. The Spicy and Tangy were designed to accentuate the smokey/salty flavor of the meats you would pour them onto, but as stand-alone french fry dipping flavors they weren't as tasty as the Sweet. But baby, they were fabulous when combined with one another! I need more tacos. I'll be back Pork Shoppe.

2011-05-29,4.0,"This place is wonderful. I have a buddy in town from Holland.  So, in our adventures throughout the city, I thought I'd introduce him to some good, old fashioned American food.  What's more American than BBQ?  And, what other cuisine could take on a grand tour around the country than BBQ? So, we cam upon The Pork Shoppe.  I have biked by the place on several occasions and have always wanted to stop in.  So, on a Saturday late afternoon, we decided to cab it over here. We ordered the staples: a pound of pulled pork, a pound of brisket, two half slabs of ribs (one each of St Louis and baby back).  We also got half pound sides of baked beans and mac&cheese.  Yes, there were 5 of us. The brisket was the least favorite of them all.  It wasn't chopped or sliced, but shredded, which I think made it dry out a bit.  It was still mighty tasty.  The rub is fantastic. The ribs were good.  The baby back ribs were all right.  However, the St Louis ribs were just plain awesome.  I'm a huge dry ribs fan, but these ribs with the bbq sauce mopped on were outstanding.  The sauce was all glazey on the ribs and it was all sorts of sticky goodness. The star of the trio was the pulled pork.  I'm a huge pulled pork fan as it is, but this was just outstanding.  It was moist and perfectly smokey.  The charred ends were delectable.  Man, it makes me want more as I type. The mac & cheese was a white mac & cheese.  It was gooey and delicious. The baked beans were wonderful.  My experience with baked beans have always been about the beans being almost overcooked, which isn't a terrible thing when they're totally drenched in awesome bbq sauce.  In this case, they weren't drenched nor overcooked.  The had an almost al dente texture and were in just the right amount of sauce.  They were awesome. They also have three kinds of bbq sauce.  A sweet, a tangy, and a hot. The tangy was middle of the road.  I'm not a huge fan of sweet bbq sauce, but this stuff was really good.  The spicy sauce was outstanding. However, there is one other thing we had here that I must mention.  The pastrami.  They cure the pastrami at the restaurant.  They have two kinds: pork belly and beef.  Unfortunately, they didn't have the pork belly, which, on a Saturday afternoon on Memorial Day weekend just seems mean.  I wish I would have never seen it on the menu and didn't long for it while we waited for the beef pastrami. But then the beef pastrami arrived.  It was so good.  So, so, so damn good.  After eating all the food above, this was the perfect salty, meaty desert.  It was juicy and wonderful. So, go.  Eat here.",0.9991,0.743,0.236,0.022,0.6134149029982363

2011-05-13,4.0,"So I have this theory about the Pork Shoppe. On one fateful afternoon  some time in the recent past, the guys that run the shoppe were sitting up on Belmont. They were watching Chicago newbies flock to Hot Doug's and Kuma's Corner desperate to get in on some hometown hero food. The lines for each were piling up around corners to the point where eventually, some kids just got fed up. Kids were like, ""Shit. I'm hungry now. I can't, ya know, wait."" So these disenchanted rejects started moping back to the CTA or whatever and I assume hopefully didn't starve. Perhaps there were dead hipster kids lying face down in the gutters outside Kuma's. I don't know. The point is that the guys that run the Pork Shoppe say to themselves, ""If we put a decent restaurant here, we can soak up some people that really hate lines."" And they did.  Which brings me to the present: I went there and got some pretty awesome BBQ. Me getting my pork sandwich there came about basically for the reason mentioned above, and because everyone is like me...  Right. So. The Shoppe was empty when I got there (Saturday around 4pm in the dead of March). They were BAKING COOKIES (that were basically yellow cake with chocolate chips in them, but whatever. It cost me a dollar and it was still warm from the oven). That said, they were out of the pork belly pastrami and the beef pastrami, which I'm pretty sure are coveted like most meats that take approximately 10 days to cure and another 12 hours to smoke. I am going to go back and they are going to have these items when I do. Call ahead? And because this is a BBQ restaurant, I'm going to tell you about how I am from That Great Place In America That Really Truly Knows BBQ. Texas or something.

2011-05-01,3.0,"My beau desired BBQ and our search for delivery options via GrubHub brought us here for the first time last evening. I must say I was almost 100% impressed -- with one very glaring exception. First of all, the sides and dessert we split were all pretty grand: The mac and cheese was not overly salty (as some other reviews have said), the cole slaw was a really surprising highlight which I gobbled right up, the fries were great (even after being delivered -- which is quite an accomplishment) and the pecan-topped chocolate cake dessert was heavenly (not too rich, not too dry). My duder mostly enjoyed his pulled pork sandwich with the tangy sauce option, but I think his sandwich suffered from the same issue as my entree -- the veggie burger. I know, I know -- why order a veggie burger from a place with ""pork"" in the title? Well, with a title like ""housemade"" this guy wanted to take the plunge. I should have known something was up since it was listed under ""Salads."" The burger was dry, dry, dry; a bit overcooked and mostly flavorless. It came with no sauce or additional toppings to give it any sort of distinguishing factor: Just a meatless miscellany patty with a bun. Like what I imagine they serve on the daily in some sort of alter-universe vegan hipster prison. Just because we don't eat meat doesn't mean we don't have feelings too.

Many of us are in the service industry and Tuesday night is an ideal time to gather, eat, drink, and be merry - while the masses sit at home and enjoy another episode of ___insert popular TV show here____.  It was my turn to pick the restaurant and I wanted BAR BE FUCKING CUE.  There are many fine BBQ establishments in this city, but I wanted to try something new.  I noticed the Pork Shoppe menu had pulled chicken, which was nice because one of my friends doesn't eat pork or beef.  Sold!   We staggered in from the cold and started out with a few sides: chili, fries, and the shell-licious mac & cheese.  All were fantastic, but that mac & cheese stood out.   I had a pulled pork, which comes nude (sans sauce), allowing you to douse your meat in whichever flavor tickles your fancy (yeah, I meant for that to sound dirty).  The pork was cooked perfectly, not overly fatty, and placed atop a fresh, delicious roll. I chose the hot and sweet sauces to accompany it and slurped up every last bit. The cole slaw stood out, as well, with a slightly sweet but not too creamy consistency. Top it off with a couple cans of Shiner and a (free, with Foursquare check-in) big ol' honkin' chocolate chip cookie and you've got yourself one gluttonous meal! The staff was great - friendly and joking with our group, and there's free parking on the side of the building. Can't wait to come back.  This is definitely a destination place, not just a second-runner-up when Kuma's is too busy.",0.9976,0.776,0.224,0.0,0.5612193362193364

Absoultely everything on the tastefully limited menu is amazing. This place is last-meal-on-death- row status and if you haven't dined here yet, punish yourself for your ignorant ways and then get your ass into the Pork Shoppe!  The concept is simple: Start with some smokers, add free range, locally raised meat, 3 simple and perfect sauces, community tables, a roll of paper towel on the wall, 4-6 dollar bourbons, 2-5 dollar brews and there you have it. It's simple, well executed and in my book, the best BBQ in the city.  A tip for newcomers: Ordering happens as soon as you walk in the door, so if you need a second to look over the menu hang back in the door way and check out one of the menues they have on a barrel there, so you don't 'gum up the works'. Also, although it is a pay-at-the-counter place, they give very attentive service (dropping the food off at the table, checking on you, clearing it away etc) so make sure to tip at the counter just like you would at a tableside service restaurant.

Ordered for delivery and was quoted the typical 45 minutes. Food arrived in 30, way to make a first impression. We had a pulled chicken sandwich and the brisket tacos. Chicken was velvety and very tender. Brisket had nice flavor. Side dishes were nicely sized for two to share. (we got the beans, mac n cheese and the cornbread). The cornbread was sweet with a nice jalapeno kick and the butter they sent along was delicious and creamy. I liked the tangy sauce the best, although the wicked spicy had a nice cumin smokey flavor.

2011-02-21,5.0,"Currently my favorite ribs in the city.  For me, barbecue is about texture, smoke, and consistency, and the Pork Shoppe nails all three.  I usually go with spares over baby backs, since I like a bit of resistance and chew with the meat, plus they come with delicious rib tips that soak up so much smokey goodness.  The spares at the Pork Shoppe have a great texture without being too tough or too ""loose"" and soft. When it comes to smoke flavor, this place brings the goods.  As soon as you walk in the door, you are hit with a wall of smoke that smells like the best campfire of your life.  When I try out a new place, a very good indicator is the amount of smoke that you can smell either outside of the place or inside the place.  If you don't smell that much smoke, you should be worried.  You will not have that issue here. The rub here is also top notch, with cinnamon and sugar that forms a great crust on the rib. I have tried the pastrami here, and while I like it, I would choose ribs over the pastrami six days a week. The sides here are also not an after thought.  Excellent fries.  Addictive mac and cheese.  And if there is creamed corn offered that day, jump on it. Booze here is also reasonably priced.  Bourbons are between four and six bucks.  Beers are between two and five. The one issue this place has is the sauce.  All of the sauces here are very one note.  So if sauce is important to you, you might not like the Pork Shoppe.  For me, a good sauce is a nice to have, but the ribs at the Pork Shoppe pack so much flavor from the meat, smoke, and rub, I really don't need anything else.",0.9716,0.884,0.108,0.009,0.5619628982128981

2011-02-17,3.0,"This really is one of those times where I wish we could give half stars, because 2.5 is where this would really be at. I'm going 3 because I am more than willing to go back and try more of their wares. And onto the nuts and bolts, I've been wanting to go here since I heard it opened. I mean, c'mon , its bbq and I want to fully support more places in chicago that are busting out BBQ. I was in the area on a day off from work, so I called them and got a bunch of stuff for takeout. I ended up getting a 1/4 lb of the pulled chicken, 1/4 of teh brisket, baked beans, mac n cheese and some of the brisket tacos. I made sure to have each of their three sauces so I could get a feel for all of them. The chicken was real good. There was some good kick to it which I really enjoyed. The brisket tacos were really good, but weirdly the brisket itself was pretty meh. The brisket was helped out by the KC style sauce (which for me was their best), but it was a bit disappointing. It just needed a bit more flavor to it for my taste. That said, I utterly destroyed the mac n cheese. It really didn't stand much of a chance against me after the first bite, but the beans didn't hold up to the mac n cheese. The sauces were pretty hit and miss as well. The KC sauce was very good, but the carolina sauce was just too sweet. It was a bit much actually and the little I poured on a bit of the chicken and brisket it just didn't work. Maybe I should've had it on something else, but I'm not so sure of that. The spicy southwest sauce was almost too hot, and I'm someone who likes heat. It just killed the brisket and I didn't want to dare it on the chicken. I'll certainly want to come here again and try more, but I was just feeling like there needed to be some more from what I got. While I did get it for pick up, I really should've stayed and then bring some other stuff back for my friends. It was really relaxed inside and the smells alone were worth sitting down.",0.9865,0.785,0.154,0.061,0.53933170995671
2011-02-12,3.0,"Pork Shoppe really should bottle that delicious smokey scent they are rockin and sell it to BBQ lovers to use as potpourri around their house, I'd totally buy it!! I left feeling slightly disappointed by Pork Shoppe. Having heard the pastrami's were the way to go I couldn't wait to get my hands(and mouth) on some. After waiting for a few minutes with no one even recognizing we were at the counter I was finally greeted, with the worst news of my day, 'we are out of both of the pastrami's today'. Unacceptable, this is like taco bell being out of 'meat filler' for their tacos. I mean they open at 11am and I was there around 11:45am so maybe there was a big pastrami rush before I got there? In leiu of the unexpected pastrami shortage I choose to go with the Beef brisket sandwich and I think it was the wrong choice ($8.45). I got really excited when it came with two sides because their macaroni and cornbread came well regarded, unfortunately these are not the side options for the sandwich combo. Those would be fries, coleslaw, a pickle, and corn on the cob which that day was being substituted with creamed corn.  The meal came out in perfect BBQ style, plastic basket lined with parchment paper. The bun was quite substantial which is always good when your eating BBQ because nothing is worse than going to take a big ole bite of delicious smoked meat and having the bun collapse under the weight. Though this bun was a little too substantial and was probably twice the size of  the meat it was meant to 'guard and protect', fail. If I wanted a bun I would go to a bakery but I wanted sweet and tender BBQ so I came here, good try though! Their meat though small in portion is big in bold smokey flavor, though like the old wives tale says sometimes size matters. Once I got over the depression of the macaroni not being an included side I did enjoy the sides I received, a good amount of crispy well seasoned fries and a massive amount of coleslaw.  The coleslaw was very unique with large shreds of cabbage and fruit though not too much flavor. My friend got the brisket taco lunch special which was two brisket soft tacos fries and a drink for $5.95, I think this is probably one of the best deals they have and what I will get next time if that occasion occurs! ** Insider tip** make sure you get all your needed utensils, napkins, and sauces on your first trip to the self serve counter to avoid having to go up 10 separate times like me! Overall I liked the atmosphere of Pork Shoppe though with all the other options for great BBQ in the city I sadly won't be back.

2011-02-02,2.0,"As far as BBQ goes, it is really hard to disappoint me as I'm pretty much thrilled to eat any meat that is smoked and I could literally eat bbq sauce by the spoonful. So when I heard about a place in Avondale (the new cool restaurant mecca), I couldn't wait to give it a shot. Let me say at first glance, I really liked it here.  First off, it's across the street from Kuma's; which is genius in terms of location - how many times have you left Kuma's because the wait is too long and then tada - here's the solution. A cool bbq joint with a tasty selection of whiskeys and reasonably priced brews. The interior is nothing fancy, but that's fine because I don't expect nor do I want anything fancy at a bbq place. I'm not a huge fan of the pig artwork on the walls - call me crazy, but I just don't need to put two and two together right before enjoying my tasty pork meal. That's just a sidenote. The man working the counter was quite personable and when I couldn't decide on what to order, he was quick with suggestions. So here's the rundown...I got St. Louis style ribs, a brisket taco and the boyfriend got the chili and the brisket basket. I'm sad to report that I was most looking forward to the coleslaw that came with my ribs and to my dismay, that was left out of the to-go bag.  The ribs were fine. Nothing exceptional, but tasty. As for the sauces - fail! There are three different sauces to choose from and none of them did the trick for me. I liked the taco. The brisket was delish and it was only $2. I probably would have been happier with just a few tacos. Now the brisket basket is like going to a deli and ordering 1/4lb of brisket because that's all it is. Not exactly the deal of the century.  Of the entire meal, we both agreed that the chili was the overall winner by far. It was super unique and extremely flavorful. I wouldn't say that this place is bad by any means, but if you don't like the bbq sauce - that's pretty much a done deal in my book when it comes to a bbq joint. If you do go check it out, don't miss out on the chili - it is probably the best I've ever had.",0.982,0.796,0.134,0.07,0.5952908879738149

I was in need of some good comfort food so I suggested BBQ. We arrived about 6pm and there were already a few tables seated.  You order at the counter, grab your number and sit down. The sauces, napkins and utensils are at a table in the back. Three sauces are available: Sweet, Spicy, and Tangy. Our favorite was the spicy sauce. Had a kick but I could have used more heat. I ordered the half baby back and half St. Louis with fries and creamed corn and the hubs ordered the baby back with coleslaw and fries.  The food came and I had to wait to dig into the ribs. Too hot to the touch! The creamed corn side was delicious. Once the ribs cooled, I started with the St. Louis. Those were my favorite. Meatier ribs and overall tasty. I loved the crisp, almost burned outside with the tender, juicy meat. The meat literally fell off the bone. I wish the sauces were some how incorporated with the meat instead of as dipping sauce. It's just my preference.  I brought the majority of my meal home and got two more meals out of it. The portions are big! You can not leave here hungry. It's impossible. The people who took the orders behind the counter and brought the food to the table were very friendly.

To start, you are hit by the sweet, magical perfume that is smoked meat before you even enter the dining room.  Once in, you are greeted not by a snooty hostess, but by a bearded, burly, yet friendly man who looks like he is the one that raised and slaughtered, not just cooked the offerings.  You don't need to wait for a waitress to take your order, just glance at a menu and tell this man what you would like.  Then you find a seat and the food will be brought to you.  You are free to pick up a piece of ""the Napkin"" (you'll understand what I mean when you're there), your utensils, water and your choice of three sauces.   I have no words to describe the deliciousness of the food.  Others here have made fair attempts, but still fall short.

You can tell these ribs were smoked properly....True BBQ.  A lot of other places boil ribs, throw 'em on a grill afterwards, then drown them in sauce.  This creates a ""fall-off-the-bone"" effect with slight crisp...but in terms of FLAVOR, it doesn't compare. You don't even need sauce for the ribs at Pork Shoppe...seriously. These ribs passed ""the tear test"" as well. My only complaint about them was the temperature seemed slightly on the cool side. The beef brisket was juicy.  I can't really comment on how good they were because I haven't really consumed much bbq brisket in my life.  I can only say that it was juicy and tender.

I'm a little goofy for the slaw.   Let me say that I like cole slaw in general, but this slaw, which had a nice not overdone flavor was replete with raisins.  Not too vinegary, not too mayonaisey.

The Pork Shoppe just didn't tickle my BBQ pickle I'm sad to say. Disappointed with their odd aesthetic presentation, flavor profile of all three of their sauces and the choice to only highlight ribs and pulled meats as their proteins, pretty much determined me a non-fan of this establishment.  Ordering delivery from here meant a $20 minimum and with most Pork Shoppe items saddled around the six buck mark, that meant plenty of ordering to do! I went with pulled chicken with sweet sauce, beef brisket with tangy sauce, burnt ends baked beans, cole slaw, mac 'n cheese and a side of their spicy sauce for what I thought would be quite the balls to the wall feast. What actually showed up, however, was quite the surprise...  All of that ordering and it fit into what seemed to be one tiny brown paper lunch sack. No joke. I even questioned the driver... ""you sure this is my mega-order, dude?"", he assured me it was. I came to find that P. Shoppe's meats all show up in teensy weensy paper cartons and totally undressed. They are not sauced. Not one bit. So an order of 'pulled chicken with sweet sauce' is the visual equivalent of a cannibal's delight; an ice cream scoop's worth of stringy, heaped together, beige fleshy chicken with a separate side of red sauce to I guess dip or drown your chicken in. The lack of marrying the meat and sauce ahead of time during the cooking process just - in my opinion - does a great disservice to the meat and us, the consumer... the flavor is lacking a certain richness to it and yes, it just looks ugly. The brisket came the same way, though this time fortunately, since I positively detested its accompanying mouth-puckering tangy sauce. Much like Jeff R., I also went hunting in my fridge for a BBQ sauce more to my liking from the personal stash since Pork Shoppe's all lacked a bold, thick, semi-sweet, but mostly tangy, heartiness that I seek in a tip-top sauce.  Sides were decent, but sorta forgettable except for the yummy cole slaw... it came with a righteous crunch and a sweet little treat of raisins hidden throughout. I found it to be a most unique and lovely touch. Kudos on that!  Will I be rushing back soon though just for cole slaw (I'll pass on the ""Alive"" movie dinner special, thanks)? Uh, no way, José.

2010-12-07,5.0,"Charred Ribs, Bourbon and the Talking Heads. These are a few of my favorite things. The Pork Shoppe supplied all three.   The Pork Shoppe is a bare bones, no frills eatery. There is no ambiance, no fancy plates and menu's, just delicious carnage at a tasty price.   This delectable example of American decadence not only offers a delicious assortment of charred flesh, they have a wonderful Bourbon selection as well. My double shot of Bourbon was accompanied by a can of diet coke cost $6.00. If I had more time that night, I would have drank them out of house and home.   Onto the food. On my wonderful wife's recommendation, I went with the Rib, combo platter. This came with a half slab of St. Louis ribs and a half slab of baby back ribs. The Baby backs were good, but I wasn't a fan of the cinnamon that they used as the dry rub. The St. Louis ribs were out of this world. The dry rub was perfect. A little warning. These ribs are Texas style, which means they are not cooked with sauce on them. I usually don't like dry rub only ribs, but it worked. The St. Louis ribs were some of the best that I ever tried. The next time I visit the Pork Shoppe, it will be the St. Louis ribs all the way.   The music that's played in a restaurant usually means very little to me. I'm usually so focused on the food that I could care less. But the IPOD at this place was blasting out some of my favorite tunes. Most notably, a heaping helping of the Talking Heads. At one point during the meal, I realized that I was dining with my lovely wife, a giant glass of Bourbon and a plate full of charred pig. I almost shed a tear as I asked myself, ""Can life get any better than this""?    The bottom line on the Pork Shoppe is: This wonderful little hole in the wall offers up a fun, delicious and unpretentious meal at a affordable price. For as little as $35.00 you can get your pig and drink on. My visit was wonderful and I can't wait to go back.    .",0.9968,0.778,0.188,0.034,0.515909090909091

I found the sauces to be a little too similar for my taste (The hot isnt really all that hot, the sweet isnt really all that sweet, and the tangy was a little TOO tangy), but gosh darn it you need those sauces because what is BBQ without da sauce, right!  Andy got the 1/2 n 1/2 rib plate, which was St Louis style ribs and baby back ribs.  I loved the rub on the ST Louis, wasnt really a fan of the baby back.  I got the pulled brisket sandwich, and felt they were a bit skimpy on the portion.  The bun should never be bigger than the meat!  But for the price, it was OK.  It came with coleslaw (which was so odd with the fruit in it, but absolutely delicious) as well as a small scoop of fries, which went well with the Sweet sauce.   Service was great, the guys were very nice and were genuinely interested to know how we liked everything. Nice atmosphere too, with a sleek, urban feel to the interior.  Plus they have a HUGE delivery area, they come all the way up by us (Bryn Mawr) which is pretty awesome!",0.9968,0.71,0.264,0.025,0.5868347338935574
2010-11-29,5.0,"So I've lived off of Belmont / Sacramento for almost two years now. When you consider I came from Pilsen - where a family of 4 can eat for under $20 - and Roscoe Village - where there's a lot of variety for every meal - Avondale seemed a little lacking in food options, especially when you're a broke post-graduate and/or too impatient to wait 2+ hours. Enter Pork Shoppe. The first time I went was before seeing a movie with the bf last Sunday. We just wanted to try out the place I'd pass by every day on the Belmont bus. The prices looked reasonable and the menu looked tasty. Now we're a native Chicagoan and a Hoosier, respectively, and we don't pretend to know anything about BBQ. But from a simple ""tasty food"" standpoint, hells to the yes, this place is tasty.  We have tried so far only the sandwich combos, beef brisket, steak and pulled chicken, and they were all excellent. A caveat, however: It seems that the steak and chicken are MADE to be eaten with a sauce, as they are a little dry pre-saucing, but the sweet type makes them perfect! The beef brisket is def. sauce optional, as there's a lot of flavor in them. The best thing is that two reasonably hungry people can have a dinner out (or in) for under $20. I love me some Urban Belly/Kumas/Hot Dougs/Square/Dragonlady, but again - kind of broke, kind of impatient.  It's so awesome, we ordered takeout last night, exactly a week after our first meal there. Service is speedy, the guys who work there are friendly, and the sandwich combo (with 2 sides!) is just the right price/amount of food. And in a neighborhood where a Jackson won't get two people dinner than isn't from the snack shop at the back of Joong Boo (also delicious), and the ""quick"" options are pretty sparse, I can see this place being a frequent takeout / casual dinner for me and the boy.

From best to worst: 1. Jalapeno cornbread -- easily the best thing here, and the only thing I'd recommend to anyone back home.  They pull no punches with the heat and its got a nice kick.  Served with a smooth honey butter. 2. The ribs were cooked beautifully, if not sufficiently smokey.  They didn't have that nice pink smoke ring, and none of the smokey flavor, but they were tender, perfect texture, and delightfully moist with a great crust.  Good meat, not enough ""BBQ"". 3. Pork belly pastrami -- Great idea, I thought this was executed ok.  Belongs on a sandwich for lunch, not really for a BBQ joint.  I think its a little too subtle to be compared alongside regular BBQ fare. 4. Brisket tacos -- My understanding is that a lot of people love these, but they brisket was DRY and overcooked.  The tortilla was too big.  Not a bad idea though, just needs some work. 5. The BBQ sauces were dismal, but they concede that it is a work in progress. The proprieters are very friendly, super nice guys, have a lot of experience in the restaurant industry, and I'm sure they're going to do awesome.  I think they need to just go on a few trips to BBQ areas in the US and do some tasting, come back, get an experienced pit master, and there will be lines out the door.",0.9978,0.663,0.275,0.062,0.6062286324786326

Parking was easy, they have a small lot right next to the restaurant. The guy at the register/order taker was friendly and helpful. Since time was an issue for us, we got our order to go. I got both some pulled pork and beef brisket. My wife ordered the pulled pork lunch special. We sat at the bar for a little bit, and the food was ready in well under 10 minutes. Pretty quick for BBQ. We started to eat as soon as we got home, and it was pretty good. Of the 3 sauces they offer, I only like the sweet one. I wasn't crazy about the spicy one, not because of the heat, but the flavor just didn't work for me. But that's just a personal choice. The brisket was very tender and tasty. I'm definitely not an expert on beef brisket, as this was only the second time I've tried it. The pulled pork was just above average. Not great, but tasty. And I like that they serve the sauce on the side, some places drown the meat in some sort of sauce. I also like being able to order the meat alone (ala carte), if you are a carnivore like me. One very small, but much appreciated, detail was they include wet naps with the meals. I've been to a few that only gave me a dry paper towel to clean my hands. That's an amateur mistake for BBQ. To summarize, the prices were reasonable, service quick, food decent and convenient for us.The only thing preventing it from being a 5 star review is the quality of the pulled pork.

The pulled pork is perfectly smoked and absolutely delicious. It comes on a soft, lightly buttered bun. They have very fair combos and lunch specials, which could mean I'll be returning frequently. I would definitely rank the meat in my top 3 category for pulled pork sandwiches.  Unfortunately, I was not that big on the 3 sauces (spicy, sweet, tangy).

But if there is one thing I do know and that is that I am a lover of all things meat and the Pork Shoppe does it right.  There are two words to describe this place: Simple & Delicious. The Pork Shoppe operates with a counter service style of dining, walk in, order and someone brings your food to the butcher block tables and its get yer own fixins of sauce napkins and wet naps from the table of pork accoutrements. I always enjoy the serve myself style of dining although I have never had such a great experience of attentiveness by the floating staff to take away your discards and refill your drinks.  Really, I'm serious TOP NOTCH!

I stuck with the meat on my first trip trying, the beef brisket made to perfection and had it as a ""sammy""  ( for a $1.00 tell em ""make it a sammy"" and you can make your meat selection into a sandwich by adding a bun.) Next, I moved onto the Ribs!  I haven't seen a rack this delicious since my last trip to the strip club, in fact, I started throwing dollars at it!  I would have to say the ribs are where its at!  Not that anything I had was bad but they were slightly charred giving them a crispness yet with the slide off the bone and melt in your mouth goodness; and with you in control of the sauciness it's your choice how many paper towels and finger licks you desire! Then I dug into what looked like a pound of raw bacon well I guess that's actually what pork belly is.   It was great, although wasn't expecting it cold, my only suggestion was to warm it and weeks later they offer it warm.

The meat was great and the flavors all came together. I also enjoyed the mac 'n cheese side dish, served in a small tin, baked with bread crumbs and lots of the cheese. The disappointments were the pulled chicken and pulled pork sandwich, but more generally the sauce selection and value. The four choices of meat (chicken, pork, brisket and steak) are served ""deli style,"" meaning plain in a basket. Add $1 for a sandwich, and do your own saucing from the three available. This puts a lot of pressure on the sauces, which did not carry the day. I have my favorite BBQ sauces at home, and anyone one of them would have been preferred. I can eat almost anything with great BBQ, therefore I can see the appeal of deli style meats. But it does beg the question, what are you really getting for ~$6 of 1/4 of pulled pork?

2010-09-27,4.0,"It's a tragedy that the Pork shoppe is only averaging 3.5 stars.  Important mentions: everything on the menu is a la carte; everything, right down to a bun if you'd like to have your meat in a sandwich. At first glance, after reading through complaint reviews I too thought, WT-Heck; so many options with so many charges. But after taking some time to look over their menu and then to enjoy the meal I selected, it all became clear. If you are a BBQ lover and have done the many barbecue spots around town you'd be familiar with the standard side options which include staples like BBQ beans or Cole slaw that come standard with meals. But here's the thing; how many of you love those sides all the time? There are plenty of times I think or ask if I can substitute to which I gain an up charge or told it can't be done.  Here's where Pork shoppe's menu and order practice excel. After some looking and peeping around at others' plates, I decided to go with a  pound of pulled chicken followed by a Texas brisket taco and side of sweet and spicy cornbread. Plus a can of soda. All items I wanted to try, totaling around eleven dollars plus tax.  Pulled chicken is pulled chicken and at a  pound I too was left wondering if that amount was the pre-cook weight or what? $4.50, is expensive and the amount is minuscule. You can understand the charge for the brisket when the meat has been rubbed for 24 hours and has the flavor to prove it. Getting back to my meal, I did a mixture of two of their three sauces and was ecstatic about the outcome. Spicy sauce with their sweet and sticky sauce. Topped the chicken with different quantities of the two, the flavor was sweet but spicy so that there was a sheen of sweat building over my nostrils. I love that sensation. The brisket taco was excellente with cilantro, lettuce, onion and a dabble of spicy sauce. The meat was cooked perfectly and with every bite every component was savored. Last but not least the sweet and spicy cornbread which was baked on demand and served with some kind of honey butter maybe(?). The bread was grainy and moist paired with the butter, sweet to taste with a kick at the end. These three items eaten together was the perfect meal to satiate my afternoon hunger. Not a lot of food, but enough and by my terms. If I did them again, I'd trade my Coke for a bourbon highball.  The restaurant is small and seats less than twenty.

2010-09-27,2.0,"Well ya'll, don't be expectin' Texas bbq here.  Or Kansas City bbq. Or Mephis.  I have been quite a few places and this place really doesn't compare to the plethora of tasty joints throughout the good ole US of A.  Before I begin my critique, thought I'd tell y'all what we had:  Burnt ends bbq beans  Pulled pork sammich  Brisket basket (all meat)  Brisket taco  Cole slaw  Can of cold beer  The only adjective that keeps coming to mind here is AVERAGE. Maybe even slightly below.  Why?  -  Expensive for skimpy portions ($35 bucks for all of this?)  -  More bun than meat  -  Sauce options were less than memorable -  Raisins in my cole slaw (admission: I deplore raisins. But even if I didn't, the little roaches don't belong next to the delicate strands of cabbage) -  Forced to get up to grab more bbq sauce at communal sauce station  And the worst?  Sinewy brisket cut (strangely) into cubes. Yes, some of them were actually chewy. And some wayward gristle to boot.  What is NICE about Pork Shoppe:  -  Totally cool owners/staff - came by a few times to check on us  -  Easy parking in lot adjacent to building  -  self-service, laid-back atmosphere (uh, I guess it would be odd to call - any bbq place anything but)  Overall, this place feels wannabe. Like the owners thought to open it because they liked the neighborhood. Or they wanted to ride the swine wave sweeping the country (pork belly mania! bacon fest!  oh the glorious pig!).  Pork Shoppe ultimately doesn't not hold up to the other saucy, smokey bbq joints around Chicagoland.  In fact, I suggest you hop in yer F150 and giddy up over to Smoque, Honky Tonk, and Honey 1 before you sport over to this new joint.  Sorry Chicago Magazine.

You order it because you want to eat -- not because you want to look cute.  I was disappointed in the size of my pulled pork sandwich. The bun overpowered the meat in size and taste and that's too bad because the meat tasted pretty dang good. What made the size issue even more apparent was the price. If you're asking someone to spend $7 on a sandwich in these hard times, you better make it worth one's while. $1 for a pickle? $3 for a small side of mac & cheese? Either all the trust-fund kids have taken up shop in Avondale or the price point is totally wrong for the area. I guess time will tell. Not long after finishing my sandwich and mac bites, I was hungry. For me, this is not rib-sticking food. Again, the pork tasted fine. However, would I make the drive out here to pay the same price for a sandwich (without sides or beverage) that I'd pay for an entire meal (actually, two) from a south or west side bbq master?

What they claim to be Texas brisket does not deserve the title. Ours was tough, overly salted and tasted like it had a chemical smoke flavor, rather than an authentic one. 2. Both the pulled and the brisket were horribly greasy. There is certainly room for fat in BBQ, but not like this. My bun was immediately soaked through with oil. Which brings me to another point: the bun. 3. You shouldn't have to pay for a bun when ordering bbq. And you certainly shouldn't pay for a crappy bun. It was dry, whimpy and had no real substance. Needless to say, it was no match for the meat piled on top of it and immediately fell apart. 4. It was too expensive for what you get. I'm willing to pay top dollar for a little taste of home, but this place will never get my money again. 5. All that being said, the macaroni and cheese was really good.  Sorry, Pork Shoppe.

Easy. -The people working (felt like one or more of them may have been owners) were friendly and welcoming. The cons: -The pricing. I'm cool with paying extra to make my meal a sandwich. I'm not cool with overpricing for small portions. An extra dollar for corn on the cob shouldn't be the length of a credit card. Basically, I paid $7 for just a sandwich, a poorly made sandwich I might add, and then another dollar for a side, a very small side - and then of course paying for a drink. That comes to about $10 with tax and if I am going to pay that much for a sandwich that doesn't really thrill me, I shouldn't be leaving your establishment hungry. -The taste.

By far though, the most disappointing part of the meal was the sauce. All three sauces, to be exact. None really hit any of the right notes with me. One was way too sweet, one tasted like orange juice, and the the spicy sauce fell into that 'heat without flavor' purgatory.

They were juicy and everything but, bafflingly, no flavor. The rub was OK but not succulent - tasted like too much cocoa or espresso, oddly bitter.

Overall, I wanted more juice, and to leave looking like l needed a bath and a nap.

I love the little innovative decor and the fact that much of their menu is written in permanent marker on cardboard.  Oh, and those of you bitching about prices can suck it; yes, it costs a bit more to eat local and eat well.  Two of us spent $26 at lunch for 2 beers, 2 sandwiches, and 3 sides.  I'm pretty sure we'd spend at least that much at Kuma's and about the same amount at Hot Doug's without the beers.  So there.  yay Pork Shoppe!",0.9828,0.738,0.186,0.076,0.5796483898046397

I have had the Pulled pork and the brisket. they were both AMAZING. they have three different sauces. I loved the Sweet and Tangy! the menu is very very simple but that's how they like it. When food is simple it has to have good flavors because, there is nothing else to cover it up. what's also good is there is no sauce when you get your food, so there is never any overload of sauce. you get your own sauce on the side. there is a small table with all the sauces and water and napkins and other condiments. the ONE and ONLY thing i didn't like was the key lime pie. I'm all about sweets people! and i know my pastry. that was a bad key lime. But! Wait! when the owner saw i didn't eat my key lime, he asked me why. and when i told him he gave me four big cookies (which were awesome!) instead of the key lime. he could not have been more sweet. they actually want you to be satisfied. give it a try!

Dislikes:  The sauces are bad, and two of them basically have no flavor except spiciness.  I couldn't believe they don't have any Texas toast, but I've found that to be an unfortunate trend for BBQ joints in the area.  The macaroni lacks flavor.  I also would have liked some regular corn bread without the jalapenos.  The bun on the brisket sandwich sucks - it's too hard and it has no flavor either (coulda used butter or something).  The brisket is pricey, though I should say that the owner responded to my initial review and informed me that this was because they only use beef from local, grazing cattle.  Sadly, even the giant chocolate chip cookie that I had was not appetizing, as it was slightly burned. If you're not used to good BBQ, then this place may wow you, but being from the South, I was not impressed.  Smoque is supposed to be killer, but after visiting there twice, I feel similarly about it as well, though I'd rank it a notch above the Pork Shoppe.",-0.971,0.749,0.084,0.167,0.566076923076923

I went with a smothering of their tangy sauce, and added the wicked as I ate through it. The Tangy is just that tangy, and tasty. The wicked has a good little kick to it with a nice after burn, but is not over powering. I did not try their third, and last option of sweet.  The corn bread is traditional with a spicy kick that when smothered in butter is a damn fine amalgamation of corn bread and jalapeno bread.

2010-07-31,4.0,"Pork Shoppe is the meat! During the week, I tend to eat lightly so I can conserve for some weekend treats. I'm talking salads, grilled chicken and pork, watermelon and even cottage cheese. I know - not very exciting! But when I'm ready to splurge come weekend, I'll take savory over sweet any day. And usually, my craving is for meat! So when Colleen suggested we head to Pork Shoppe for a working lunch on a Friday (yes, Friday marks the onset of my splurgetastic weekends), I was ecstatic. I checked out the menu online before heading over. Maybe I was too excited, because I arrived 15 minutes before Johnny and Colleen. Ah, the pain of inhaling the wafting scent of BBQ! I prayed for their imminent arrival and patiently waited. The insides of Pork Shoppe are very simple: wood, communal tables and you order at the counter. I settled on my final decision (quarter pound of pulled pork plus a Texas brisket taco) and headed to the counter. Also on the order roster: side of mac 'n' cheese and the green bean salad for us to share. Our food came out only minutes later, and at first I felt a pang of disappointment as I examined my (un)heaping pile o' meat. ""Is this just a side?"", I wondered. I slathered my pork with a healthy dousing of the sweet and tangy BBQ and began feasting. The taco, with brisket, cilantro and onions atop a corn tortilla, was perfect. The brisket is hardwood smoked and you can taste it. I saved the best for last - kind of like when I was a kid and I'd eat all of my Lucky Charms but save the marshmallow bits for the end. Except that the candy in this story is pork, natch! What initially looked to be a small portion turned out to be very filling. And rich. And smoky. And delicious! I rationed out 5 bites of mac 'n' cheese for myself (what can I say - I am NOT a good sharer) and took a trip to comfort food heaven. Creamy, with what I think was gruyere. Next time I'm having a bad day, Pork Shoppe can expect for me to show up and order about a dozen of these cheesy little sides! All in all, a very favorable experience. Pork, brisket and mac 'n' cheese. Next time, I'll order some coleslaw too. Now how did I forget the coleslaw?!",0.9914,0.83,0.138,0.032,0.5357475857475859

I think you'll leave happy. - Brisket... great rub, incredibly smoky flavor, nice crisp crust on the outside and juicy on the inside - Brisket Tacos... awesome.  I love doing something similar with leftover brisket when I order too much at other BBQ places here in the city and to see someone put it on the menu and serve it right is great to see.   - Pulled pork was good, but not great.  I have to give Fat Willy's and  Smoque the edge on pulled pork... I haven't had a the pulled pork at some of the other great BBQ joints in the city, so can't compare beyond that. - Sauces were good... don't be afraid of the Wicked Spicy - it's not wicked spicy (which I liked... you don't want a ton of heat to mask the flavor of the meat) but has a good heat that compliments the pork and brisket really well. - Fries and cole slaw were great - Prices are solid... I've heard some folks complain that the prices aren't in line with the portions but I whole-heartedly disagree.  My wife and I had 2 Brisket Tacos, 1/4 lb. of Brisket, 1/4 lb. of Pulled Pork, side of Fries, side of Coleslaw, and PBR for $23.  We ate everything and were a ""good full,"" meaning as I'm writing this review I'm still full but not laid out on the couch in a BBQ coma.  I think $11.50/person for great food and a beer and you leaving feeling full is more than fair. - Good beer and bourbon selection - Intimate space, simply decorated, not pretentious - Parking lot in the alley",0.9971,0.717,0.243,0.041,0.5804540420819492

Meat was dry, which was a general consensus.  Got the corn on the cob for a buck, which turned out to be only half a cob and a little overcooked.   In the end, a little overpriced (Smoke Daddy across town has bigger portions for the same price and the meat's not so dry).  Waiting for the kinks to be worked out, but I'm coming back!",0.9947,0.711,0.265,0.024,0.6234126984126986

2010-07-26,3.0,"I approach each new BBQ establishment with the zeal of a kid in a candy store, and in my book, I would never say BBQ is ever bad (especially when the method is smoking low and slow). However, whether you are talking KC, Carolina, or Texas styles, the term ""dry"" should only apply to the rubs you use, and never as a description of the meat itself. Unfortunately, dry is what I came across at the Pork Shoppe, with 50% of the 4 meats sampled (ribs, brisket, chicken, and pork) being very dry.  First and foremost, (back) ribs are whats really most important to me, and a full rack comes in at $19 (without sides). They arrived nice and smoky, but with almost a too generous coating of Texas style dry rub (that also seemed heavy on coriander). They encouraged me to sample them neat first, but as I prefer a KC style, I went for the sweet sauce, which was good -- as was the sauce more laden with vinegar).  Not my favorite ribs, but that was more because of personal taste, and still worth a 4/5. To supplement, I ordered  a qp of sliced brisket, which I will never do again.  It had some good smoke flavor, but the dryness was a huge disappointment, and was all I could think about when eating it.  (2/5.) I also asked if they had any sample sized portions to order, but as they didn't, they were kind enough to offer me a couple bites of the pork and chicken just to taste.  I really liked the pork, which was nice and smoky (4/5), but the white meat chicken was very dry.  So, despite also being nicely smoked, if it turns to paste in my mouth, I check out (2/5). I like the simple decor with a Western tinge, and the guy behind the counter was certainly proud of the product, and looking to please his customers.  Otherwise, if you are taking to go, they don't send you home with enough BBQ sauce, so be sure to ask for extra if leaving with it.

I was gut busted when I left. Soooo full. Beef brisket is good, too. This new addition of weekend Pork Belly Pastrami sounds rather exciting, but I sadly can't vouch for it yet. I like to make sandwiches out of the meats for an extra $1. This consists of a buttery brioche bun to make it easier for you to stuff your face without the aid of silverware - Magical! The mac n' cheese used small shell noodles, what tasted like a gouda base, and baked crumbs on top. It was really good. The corn bread was also delish. It tasted like they roasted jalapenos before baking them into the sweet and fluffy bread - smokin'! The entire staff was ever so friendly. They have the silverware, water, towels in a 'help yourself' area towards the back, but a nice lady came and refilled my water several times during the meal. There were also regulars there that had clearly already made friends with the staff, and were quick to tell me how great PS is. It's always nice to see people so enthusiastic about their food. The meat came out dry - as in, not cooked in the sauce. The three sauces offered are all quite different, so I kind of understand. I just prefer when it comes out sloppy and I get to add more slop to it. Of course all three sauces were amply tested. The molasses based sauce has a bright nose to it, like orange or citrus. It was very sweet. The vinegar based sauce tasted a little like pickles? But not in a bad way? There was also a bit of mustard taste in it. Tart and good. The chili based sauce was hot (master of the obvious?). It had the perfect amount of heat for me, but was a bit much for my friend. I didn't have a favorite sauce. I really liked each of them in moderation - a little of this, a little of that. But I think the reason for that is because the sauces are so overtly what they are. The base flavors really stand out. So let's wash all that down with a beer. Only cans! I love it! I got my standby, a PBR, because I am trying hard to be a hipster. But they have Brooklyn Brewery's Lager! It's really good, if you didn't know that already. The also have bourbon. How very Southern feeling.  It's hard for me to dislike BBQ. Not to say that I was even close to disliking Pork Shoppe. They do a great job. I wouldn't say it's better than my favorite in Chicago - Smoque, but it's up there with Honey 1 and Honky Tonk, ect. I'll definitely be back. Weekly perhaps? I paid around $13 not including tip for a pulled pork sandwich, mac n cheese, and a PBR. I am assuming you'll want a side with your meal, because they're pretty darn good.

2010-07-19,3.0,"What do I love? BBQ. Therefore, I really wanted this place to be great, but found the experience to be a little underwhelming. As it's only a block from my work I was hoping to find a great BBQ joint we could just walk to. You order at their counter which is right next to the entrance-way. This was a little odd as there were quite a few of us that showed up from my work. This caused the queue to extend straight to the outside door, not allowing you to see the menu until you're right at the register. They have paper menus but they're at the counter, it might help to leave a few in the small vestibule. The wall menu itself is a bit confusing as the layout is all over the place, style over usability. Three people in my party were disappointed to find out that they could have had their meat in sandwich form but the option wasn't apparent to them.  I had ordered a 1/4 lb of brisket and their spicy cornbread. My order was apparently lost as everyone at my table was served and then everyone at the table that arrived after us too. I flagged down a server and she soon corrected and they gave me a complimentary side of beans as well. The brisket was dry and only offered a very slight smoky smell but not taste to it. I found the texture to be tough and not that appetizing. There was no smoke ring and the bark didn't really have a crunch. I tried their three sauces (sweet, spicy and a vinegar) and all were pretty good but not outstanding. My friend's chicken was also a little dry. They all agreed that their meal was OK, but not the best they've had. One guy had their brisket tacos and really enjoyed them. My side of corn bread was fantastic. There was a decent amount of heat from the chopped jalapenos. The inside was moist and the outside had a great crust. The beans were pretty good as well, they had a very earthy flavor with a good hearty finish to them.  The staff was friendly and corrected the error I mentioned above promptly. They're very warm and not pretentious at all.  The interior is kind of a contemporary/americana mash-up. They have a few longer tables and probably reaches capacity at maybe 24 people. At this time it's kind of the new so there's not a huge crowd yet. I think this place has potential and I'm hoping they get past their growing pains and really focus on the tenderness and flavor of their meat. And to be fair I need to try the ribs still. The sides are spot on and their service is just right. I'm rooting for you Pork Shoppe!",0.9959,0.742,0.183,0.075,0.5420373977873978
2010-07-18,5.0,"I am changing my first review which is below.   They have increased their sides, adjusted their pricing and improved the quality of everything!   I have been there three times in the last two weeks.  The brisket and pork belly with the sweet sauce is full of flavor and tender.  Best in town!   The creamed corn and cole slaw is great.   The slaw is like mom used to make; chunky with raisins and full of flavor.  Love this place.  Service is also great.  The counter staff visited our table to check on us.   They also have parking.  For about twenty bucks two of us are very satisfied!!!!   I am hooked.  Stopped by for the first time this weekend and was very, very pleased!! The meat was tender, the corn bread was outstanding, and the interior was spotless.We had the brisket sandwich and pulled pork sandwich, two sides (mac and cheese and cornbread), and two soft drinks.    $7.00 for a sandwich with no sides was ok; seeing that it was delicious, but $3.50 for a piece of cornbread the size of a hamburger bun was a little steep. It should have cost about $1.50. I'd love to go back weekly, but at those prices, I'll probably stop by once or twice a year.  Everyone should check it out. If the owners are reading this, please do a price adjustment on the cornbread, and I'll be back weekly!!! Yummy sauces too!",0.9887,0.803,0.175,0.022,0.5354166666666667
2010-07-17,4.0,Very very good dry rub ribs. The rub was tasty and not too salty. Which is a mistake alot of other rib joints make. Definitely give it a try.,0.5819,0.737,0.189,0.074,0.56375
2010-07-16,1.0,"BBQ without the ""smoke ring"" around the meat is just not BBQ.  The ribs were passable, but they were a little tough and just missing the depth of flavor that comes with a good 6 to 10 hours of smoke.  The brisket was even worse.  In the time that the food arrived at the table and I ate a single rib, the brisket turned into a beef jerky like texture.  They either cooked the meat at too high a heat for a too short a period of time, or used too lean a piece of meat.  I'm thinking the former for lack of the pink smoke ring that comes with all serious BBQ. I tried my best to cover up the dryness with the sauces, but it did not help. As others have stated, the sides are pretty good.  The service was great, but neither of these is enough to make up for meat that is just not made well.  There are plenty of other options in the city for BBQ so I would definitely pass on Pork Shoppe.",0.9578,0.76,0.152,0.088,0.4794047619047619
2010-07-15,5.0,"I have been to the Pork Shoppe twice and been impressed both times. The first time I had the half-rack, a beef brisket taco, corn on the cob, potato salad, and finished off the meal with the key lime pie. The second time I had the Green Bean Salad and Mac and Cheese. I am looking forward to sampling all the items on the menu.  Most importantly, the ribs are terrific. They are not the fatty, fall of the bone, gooey goodness that most people are used to from many Chicago BBQ joints. The Pork Shoppe uses a dry rub that is a perfect balance of seasonings and not too much salt. There is a nice smokiness. The sauces provided are well done - I preferred making my own blend of the Tangy and Spicy. This blend went nicely with the Beef Brisket taco - a nice flavorful distraction before diving back into the ribs.  As for the sides, what's not to like about corn on the cob? It is perfectly cooked and nicely buttered - easy to eat on a stick. The potato salad is a real standout. I am a fan of mustard potato salad and this is one of the best I have tasted. Also, the portion is HUGE - no little plastic cup, but a nice big tin.  The key lime pie was the perfect way to end the meal. It has wonderfully thick graham cracker crust and just the right amount to tang to it.  Same portion size as the potato salad - big enough for two people.  After all of this I had to roll myself out of the Pork Shoppe.  The second time was a not the glutenous feast described above. The Green Bean Salad is crisp and fresh. There are a lot of flavors in that bowl. The caramelized onions are a nice compliment to the generous helping of blue cheese and almonds. I was impressed with the size and quality of the green beans used to make the salad. This, along with the white cheddar mac and cheese, was a filling dinner.  The atmosphere is nice a low-key. The staff is helpful and friendly, but doesn't hover - after all this is a counter service operation and everything you could possibly need in one spot on the back wall. Although the menu board is a little daunting, I could tell that improvements had been made between my visits and it was no problem getting an explanation from the staff.  The other neat thing is that the meat is all locally sourced and they'll tell you exactly where it came from. There isn't anything about this place that is mass produced - nonetheless, the food is served fast and hot. From the ribs, to the potato salad, to the nice selection of bourbons, a lot of care has gone into the Pork Shoppe and it shows. I highly recommend checking out the Pork Shoppe.",0.9978,0.793,0.186,0.021,0.5672639933166251
2010-07-15,3.0,"I wasn't blown away, but I wasn't completely let down either. The best things on the menu seem to be the sides. * Corn on the cob: not bad... but how can you mess that up, really? * Spicy cornbread: Great.  It's a huge portion, and the green chiles add great flavor * Mac+Cheese: quite good, bread crumbs ontop and baked * Pickle:  well it's a giant pickle... and it tasted good. As for the meat, we got: * Pulled pork sandwich:  Kinda bland.  They should see about adding some flavor.  The bun to meat ration seems a bit too high. * Pulled chicken sandwich:  Same thing, meat kind of bland. The three sauces are okay.  I recommend mixing the tangy and the hot together :)  That might be against some sort of BBQ law though, I'm not sure, so do so at your own risk. The place itself is kind of blah.  They should work on the character of the place.  Add some ""rustic"" appeal, maybe.  Some wood.  And it'd be great if they added a soda fountain..... maybe made out of wood. ;) One thing that definitely won't disappoint is the staff.  They were quite nice and attentive (we were given the cornbread for free, just because there was an extra one).  The place is kept clean, and the big jug of ice water is a good idea if you don't happen to have a (wooden) soda fountain. This place is brand new, so I don't want to be too harsh.  They should keep on experimenting with the meat.  A lunch bbq place lives and dies on its pulled pork, they should do something to up the flavor quotient, and please serve it warm! Note:  Full disclosure: I edited this review.  I realized what I had earlier was a bit harsh.  If the management is attentive to the feedback of their customers (and I have reason to believe they will be), then this place can become a local favorite.",0.9967,0.734,0.214,0.052,0.6245701459034793
2010-07-14,5.0,"It's great to have a local BBQ spot just blocks away from home in Avondale.   Simple menu with meat by the pound and ribs by the slab. The usual suspect sides of beans, cornbread etc are extra and everything is reasonably priced for BBQ. Saw one salad. 3 great hearty sauces, sweet, tangy and hot.  Got the Texas Brisket, Mac & Cheese and the Jalapeño Cornbread. The Mac & Cheese were great and individually made with the crumbs baked on top. I'm going back just for the Mac & Cheese. The brisket was tender and seasoned well. Great flavors in the cornbread.  There are other BBQ spots around and I've had better but this place is hands down a great addition to Avondale. Definitely a good BBQ spot at good prices.",0.9833,0.748,0.231,0.021,0.479572940287226
2010-07-14,1.0,"If you think this is good BBQ, you are sadly an amateur. It's called the pork shop.....but there is hardly any pig on the menu. Dry, flavorless, and just downright ugly. The mac n cheese was the only good thing. The brisket was overcooked and flavorless. The chicken dry and bland. The sweet BBQ sauce tasted like orange marmalade. The hot sauce wasn't hot. The tangy could have comer out of a bottle. The bun was ordinary and way too big for the portion of meat. The fries were.....well, just fries like you get at any Italian beef stand. There was no taste of smoke, wood or barbecue anywhere in the vicinity. The joint is cold, and the menu goofy (looks like they are just trying too hard). The presentation is non existent. The awkward brown paper towel napkins, the sauce bar a mile away from anything.....I'm all for no frills, but not for no thrills.

2010-07-14,4.0,"The Avondale neighborhood has just added another interesting restaurant to a burgeoning festival of culinary delights... the Pork Shoppe has been open for just under a week, and they have some interesting food here. This place is clean, unpretentious, friendly, with fast service and delicious barbeque! I live in the 'hood and saw that the place opened last week, but every time I finally got ready to stop in (say, elevenish) they're closed! Finally, I dropped by while they were open and I had a delicious Green Bean salad (w/ fresh green beans, lettuce, carmelized onions, almonds and bleu cheese - $5.50) and a tasty ""Texas Brisket Taco"" ($2.00!!),  and a PBR to wash it down - total cost $10.50!   G.S. must be quite the conoisseur of barbeque - she hated the sauces?  They tasted like they ""could have come out of a bottle""?  Really?  The ""Texas Brisket Taco"" came with all three sauces, and they were so delicious I wanted to eat them with a spoon!  If they're not homemade I'll eat my hat... slathered in the Pork Shoppe's sauces, I'm sure it would be quite wonderful!  Very very tasty, all three of the sauces (Sweet & Sticky, Tart & Tangy, and Wicked Spicy). Another reviewer remarked that the food here ""wouldn't impress any cowboys down in Texas"" - as if she ever met any.  Well, this restaurant isn't trying to impress the cowboys in Texas, it's trying to serve up tasty, inexpensive BBQ for Chicago city-slickers.  And though I've been to Texas and had the barbecue there (it was good), I think that this fare here at the Pork Shoppe more than satisfies my palate - and my wallet! There is a selection of cheap beers ($2!!) and whiskeys to wash your food down in working-class style. I am looking forward to trying out their pastrami very soon - if it's half as good as what I tried tonight, I'll have a new favorite restaurant within 1 block of my office!",0.9835,0.783,0.153,0.064,0.5482482721956408
2010-07-12,3.0,"Not bad, but not amazing and certainly not the best BBQ I've had.  Husband got a 1/4 lb brisket sandwich. It was tender, but really could have used more smoke and...well, flavor. A decent effort for the Midwest, but not sure it'd impress any cowboys down in Texas. My pork belly pastrami was interesting but again could have used more of the pastrami seasoning. (I almost forgot it was supposed to be a pastrami until I happened to catch a small sliver of the crust). As a previous reviewer mentioned, I also would prefer a warm pork belly sandwich as opposed to cold, which I wasn't expecting. The mac and cheese was pretty tasty, but a rather small portion for $3.  Nice that they offer 3 different sauces, which you can self-dispense, though I thought they could all use a slight bump in flavor. The spicy was probably our favorite.  Next time I would go for 1/2 lb of meat for a sandwich or recommend that they use smaller buns b/c the bread was so thick it overwhelmed the meat portion in each bite.  Service was friendly. Was a bit disappointed that they weren't brewing their own sweet tea yet (how hard is it to have tea ready?). I'll probably wait till they're in full swing then go back and try some of the other options before cementing my opinion.  A good start, but hope they get better.",0.9635,0.749,0.159,0.092,0.5502154195011338

2010-07-09,4.0,"Stopped by today for lunch with two coworkers.  It was quite tasty.  You buy meat by either the quarter pound or half pound and they'll make it into a sandwich for $1 more. The mac and cheese side here was awesome.  Spicy Cornbread was really good too.  My coworkers got the pulled pork and brisket and enjoyed both.  We also like the spicy BBQ sauce the best of the three available sauces. French Fries were nicely crispy and flavorful but not exceptional - they are certainly on par with any of the nicer BBQ places but keep in mind that for french fry domination that they have to compete with Hot Doug's famous Duck Fat Fries a couple blocks away on California and Roscoe. I had the Pork Belly on a sandwich.  I was slightly disappointed.  The flavor was good and it was very tender.  However, it is served cold and to me, cold smoked pork belly tastes somewhat like ham -- really good ham mind you. I suggested they add a warmed option for the Pork Belly to their menu.  Pork Belly has so much fat that warming it up a little to make the fat softer really brings out a lot of flavor and a quick searing makes it delightful.  In fact, if they seared it a bit immediately before slicing and served it warm, I'd probably be going there all the time until my arteries hardened and I died from pure joy. The interior is rustic and homey with a welcome comfortable character.  I noticed the Pig on the wall was once on display at Patina (a really nice little antique and oddities shop in Andersonville) and they confirmed that the decor did come from Patina. The employees here were pleasant and attentive.  They did quite well considering it's new and there weren't any kinks with our service.  I really only had a single request which was asking for some ice with soda and they happily brought a glass of ice by in under a minute. Both my coworkers said they would go back.  It's a welcome addition to the Avondale neighborhood.  I'm giving it 4 stars for now... when they offer a warm Pork Belly sandwich, I'll make it 5 stars :-)",0.9972,0.762,0.205,0.032,0.6342696063626294
