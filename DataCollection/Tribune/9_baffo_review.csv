2016-05-05,5.0,"Ancora da Baffo. Again at Baffo. Baffo is the best Italian restaurant in Chicago. I love the menu and the Italian wine selection. The menu is extraordinary and Chef Sam De Los Santos has knowledge and passion to transform the best ingredients in unique and idyllic Italian dishes. I suggest the tasting menu. As Osteria Francescana (Massimo Bottura) has a focus on tradition and innovation, Baffo combines Italian ingredients in a simple, detail oriented manner resulting in a perfect harmony of flavor while ensuring the ingredients remain the protagonist in the Italian dishes.  It's underrated. One of Chicago's Best kept secrets.  Migliori antipasti: ""Crudo di Mare"" (freschissimo da Boston) ""Polpo con Neonata"" OTTIMO ""Carne Cruda Piemontese"" of course.. I primi preferiti: ""Ravioli al Nero con Granchio, Aneto e Uovo"" ""Tortellini ai Funghi, Noci e Saba"" ""Rigatoni alla Carbonara"" ""Risotto al Nebbiolo con Foie gras, Saba e Parmigiano""",0.9847,0.807,0.193,0.0,0.3736263736263736

2016-03-14,2.0,"Pasta first course was great, but service was terrible. We arrived around 9PM last Friday without a reservation and had an easy time getting a window table. Server was insincere, condescendingly nice, and didn't do a great job on wine recommendations. We asked for his suggestion on bottles or glasses of wine and he opened the wine book to 3 full pages of wine bottles and told us to look them all over. An aperitif of sorts was left on the table and because my friend and I were catching up while looking over the menus, one server approached the table and took it back before I had a chance to even try it. We ordered 2 starters after asking for a suggestion as well. The burrata was delicious but to me would've been better served with bread or crostini. Everything else on the plate was actually disgusting and the flavors did not go together at all. Pasta came out crunchy so I let the server know. He offered to recook the dish but that it would take 15-20 minutes. The host then came over to our table and attempted to explain that the chef normally cooked this pasta ""al-dente"" and implied that I didn't have an understanding of italian cuisine. I explained to him that I majored in Italian, lived in Florence for 6 months in addition to having taken several trips to Italy thereafter and come from an Italian family. Clearly, I know that 'al-dente' means firm to the tooth, not crunchy, like a corn tortilla shell. The pasta was that crunchy. Because it took about 20 minutes to re-make the dish, we finished around 10:50 (Baffo closes at 11pm) and we still wished to order dessert. But I had valeted my car and was aware that the valet was sourced by a separate company and would be leaving at 11pm. After mentioning this, the server said that he would take my ticket and get squared away with the valet. To me, that means that he'd collect my keys and pay the valet (so I assumed). Well, the remaining servers and host apparently did not like that it was past 11PM and did their best to make us feel uncomfortable and unwanted, one creepy one even standing a few feet behind our table, just standing there, starring right at my direction. He and our actual server would come by and exchange updates loudly and in a voice that could be overheard as to where we were with dessert (this also happened several obvious times during the entire meal and is simply tacky). Around 11:40 the host came back to tell us that the valet was still standing in the door, waiting for us to leave. We had no idea and obviously felt bad. We left without any apology for the miscommunication and without any complimentary dessert or ANYTHING for the uncooked pasta, just feeling bad for making the staff leave later than they had expected. Clearly our main server did a poor job of timing everything and a poor job of making up for the chef's oversight. Again, pasta when finally cooked correctly was delicious, but I have no desire to return here due to the staff. Moreover, nothing about the overall experience felt authentic Italian and/or does justice to Italy.",0.9342,0.804,0.105,0.09,0.45199134199134205

To start, we were given an amuse, which was very tasty and then split the octopus, which was fabulous- can't recommend it enough! For our mains, I had the risotto and he had the orecchiette. Both were full of flavor and delightful. I especially loved the black truffle on the risotto!

The wait staff was very friendly, but this review is mostly about the food. The food was amazing! I live in NY so have been to many wonderful restaurants in my time and this was on par with some of the best. Dish after dish I was impressed and thought it couldn't get better. My friend and I did the chef's menu so we tried a number of courses prepared in the ideal size to taste everything but not be overly full. I try to be adventurous but normally don't order certain things (i.e. seafood), but I had the scallops (amazing with the citrus sauce) and fried octopus (never would've guessed it was octopus). We moved on to the oxtail ragu pasta which was another delicious dish (normally don't order meat sauce but finished it up). The truffle on the risotto was a highlight. We finished with a perfectly cooked and seasoned piece of steak. Dessert was a mix of hazelnut and chocolate with a pour over of panna cotta so all my favorites to finish off an excellent meal.

2015-10-15,4.0,"I had a very nice dinner here.  This is part of the Eataly complex and is the nicest of the eateries at Eataly.  The place exudes refinement and may the quietest place within a several block area.  It's conversation friendly, even with some classic R&B tunes in the background. The alcohol program is, of course, very Italian.  The wines are done in an interesting way.  There are wines by the bottle and by the glass, but there is also a ""Coravin"" program where 3 oz or 6 oz tastings of special bottles can be had using the Coravin device.  For the uninitiated, the Coravin device enables wine to be withdrawn from a wine bottle leaving the cork intact and replacing the extracted volume of liquid with an equal volume of Argon gas.  It's cool.  The available Coravin wines are pretty pricey to try however, so I stuck with a Negroni and a crisp, fruity Friulian white wine. The food is good - here the emphasis is on top flight ingredients prepared simply.  An amuse of mini-arancini's arrived first.  We then shared the charred octopus and the eggplant stuffed squash blossoms.  The octopus was perfect and the squash blossoms were nicely crisp with a suitably earthy eggplant filling. My primi course was the squid-ink tortelloni stuffed with crab and served with a shellfish broth.  The tortelloni were like mini-sombreros with their brims filled with the broth.  Wow, delicious. My secondi was the whole roasted branzino which was partially deboned, with head and tail attached but spine removed.  It was tasty but slightly overdone and had a few too many stray bones. Dessert was the olive oil cake with roasted pear and fior di latte (mozzarella) gelato.  Nice.  The gelato was super creamy.

2015-09-18,5.0,"I cannot say enough good things about our first visit to Baffo.   We stumbled upon it accidentally while visiting Eataly in Chicago and simply could not be more impressed. Carl, our server Carl was incredibly knowledgeable about both the menu and the wine list.  He was consistently helpful without being obtrusive on our meal as well as being generous with samples of items we were curious about and even bringing us a complimentary ravioli di ricotta (more on that in a minute). and a taste of a digistif called Amoro which was very unique and intriguing. Beyond Carl, who again was wonderful, Jose our ""understudy to Carl"" (he was much more than a busboy) was also incredibly thoughtful and surprisingly knowledgeable about even the smallest things like the differences between their options for sparkling water was also a welcome surprise to our experience. And then there was Jordan who I can only assume was the restaurant manager who stopped by our table to check in our experience (and I am sure was a motivator for our free ravioli di ricotta...my thoughts on that are coming next) was very friendly and attentive to seeing that we enjoyed our experience. Our meal was delicious without question, there was no down point. The polpo (charred octopus) and carne cruda were brilliant as were the triangoli (braised beef cheek ravioli) however the star of the evening was the ravioli di ricotta which was brought to us as a complimentary taste and we couldn't be more grateful.  Now my wife and I consider ourselves to be armature ""foodies"" but we don't consider ourselves to be ""food snobs"" and we are not prone to hyperbole but after a single bite of the ravioli di ricotta (which is topped with a brown butter sage sauce) we both agreed that this was one of our favorite bites of food we have ever tasted.   Please try not to let that jade your expectations (because expectation is a huge part of human experience and we did not have any when we arrived at Baffo) however it would be dishonest if we did not give our honest feelings about our experience.

2015-02-07,3.0,"Really more like 3.5.  Good overall but, with so many great Italian options in Chicago, I'm not sure I'll return.  Nice room.  Well-cooked proteins.  Good service, albeit not at the high level they aspire.  My only major complaint is plating.  I don't think I've ever complained about plating on Yelp before, so let me explain.   Let's start with the end.  Dessert.  Coconut gelato.  Two scoops of white in a white bowl with no garnish of any kind.  This really could have used a biscotto or tuile or something for color and texture.  Even just to show that they're trying.  Very lazy presentation that ends your meal with a whimper instead of a bang.   Antipasto.  The polpo comes as long gray tentacles bereft of any char or even any suckers.  Did they clean them up in an effort to be fancy?  The unfortunate result is that they visually identify almost as fingers instead of octopus.  Not very appetizing.  They're served with beans and a delicious vinaigrette.  Excellent flavor combination . . . after you spend quite a bit of time cutting up all of the long tentacles into bite-sized pieces and stirring.  This dish would benefit from a more rustic presentation, because the fine dining plating attempt was a failure.   Plating also can affect flavor.  Carne crudo.  A generous mound of high-quality beef surrounded by 4 tiny slices of parm and 4 tiny crostini.  Very pretty.  You're meant to scoop the beef onto the toast with a piece of cheese.  Delicious!  Until you've eaten 4 bites and still have 4 more scoops of beef remaining with no more cheese and no more vessels.  Since the beef was meant to be eaten with the salty cheese, it's incredibly underseasoned when you eat it alone.   The crostini situation ties into a larger (but minor) complaint about bread.  The food is traditionally Italian, which is to say that it's meant to be eaten with bread.  Most dishes do not come with a specific bread on the side.  The octopus, for example, would have been great with a nice hunk of charred Italian-style white bread.  Instead, I ate it with their generic side offering of plain sliced wheat bread.  They dole this out one slice at a time.  Again, I think they're trying to be fancy here, but the servers weren't really on the ball in this respect, so we went long stretches with no bread.  Also, why not have more than one option, like so many other restaurants in this category?  You have an entire bakery upstairs!",0.9917,0.75,0.161,0.089,0.5082907053959684

After seeing the mozzarella be hand spun upstairs and smelling all the awesome food in the market, it made sense to eat at the restaurant. We were not disappointed.

Once arrived we were very impressed by the decor !!

The wine was wonderful, but what we found odd was that the bottle that we ordered was not left on or near our table. I believe that it was taken either back to the bar or somewhere????. Therefore for refills , it was brought back to the table, supposedly this was done so we would have more room????? Our waitress was not very friendly at first, but lighten up as the evening progressed.

My friend and I had the sea bass with broccoli, although the fish was moist, that was about it, flavor very bland and the broccoli was very very tough, the  tips tasted very bitter. I like my vegetables crispy, but Sorry, these were very hard to cut through. My husband had the Pappardelle al Ragu, which was about a 3, nothing special about this dish .

The space is simple, yet elegant.  I like the little bar tucked up into the corner and that might be the best place to sit in this restaurant.  The table we were seated at faced the wall and I felt like our server kept coming up behind me which made it hard to engage. Speaking of our server, he might have been part of the issue on our visit as he seemed almost impatient with those in our group who wanted more information on what to order and then seemed upset that this group of women were not ordering full 4 course meals but rather a couple of first courses or one plate for their entree.  He was a bit sarcastic and even dismissive of one of my friends passing her over because she was ""taking so long"", to use his words.  Bad form on his part as I really don't go out to eat to get attitude from my server. I ordered the veal loin, and I guess for $48 I was expecting so much more.  It was tasty but wasn't special enough to warrant the price. The pasta dishes that others ordered fared better but there were none of us at the table that thought this experience lived up to the hype.  And know that if you want to try the tasting menu, everyone at the table has to do the same thing  . . .not unusual but less practical when you have a larger group. Know if you go that this restaurant actually sits on the back side of Eataly facing Grand so if you wander in the front of Eataly, you will have to wend your way around to the back and down some stairs.  If you drive- there is valet parking on the Grand entrance side for about $14.

My boyfriend loved the beef cheek ravioli. I, on the other hand, did not. It was under cooked for me, hard and chewy, overly buttery, swimming in oil. The beef cheek filling was great but the cook on the pasta killed the dish for me. Skipped dessert but were served complimentary cookies with our bill.

Basically, things were pretty ""okay"" until our salads came out.  I took one look at my ""stuffed zuchini flowers"" and while most of it looked divine, right there, front and center, clear as day, was a freaking insect crawling on my food.  We should have stood up and walked out right then.  But we didn't.  Our waiter seemed just as horrified as us and immediately scooped up the plate.  A few minutes later, a woman, who referred to the bug on my food as ""the incident"" came over to apologize and make excuses.  She adamantly claimed that this has never before happened and explained that all of their produce comes from an organic, pesticide-free farm.  Um yeah, and so???  That means you are allowed to serve me bugs as an appetizer?  She then assured me that the dish would be taken off the bill.  No kidding!

Not bad. Not great. You really do expect it to be the best of the best.  Beef cheek ravioli was great. The porkchop looked amazing but was flavorless.  A colleague's pasta dish was just so so.

The good: Intimate (more upscale) little restaurant downstairs at Eataly, so it's quiet and you can actually hear yourself and your companion. The bad: Upscale=snooty waiter. And the hostess upstairs told us there were no tables, only bar seating, but when we came downstairs and asked the downstairs hostess, lo and behold we got a table because they had several empty ones! The food was awful, I enjoyed the gelato dessert we ordered, but can't say that for anything else, the salad was nothing to sneeze at, my squid ink fettuccine with lobster was terrible, the pasta was beyond al dente, it just wasn't cooked and the lobster wasn't fresh, it was chewy because it was frozen, which is surprising since they sell fresh seafood upstairs. It was also drowning in sauce, a runny gross sauce. Just gross, lost my appetite. If you're feeling adventurous and ever want to try calf's brain (yup, it's on the menu), go for it. Can't say the ambiance saved the dinner because it felt a little like a dark dungeon in the basement of a grocery store than a romantic hideaway.

2014-02-23,3.0,"Given Mario Batali's involvement and the Michelin star earned by its sister restaurant Babbo, I had high expectations for Baffo. Unfortunately, Baffo fell quite short. While not bad, the Baffo experience is a poor value and I would not return. Baffo's closest comparison in the area is Cafe Spiaggia. They share similar price points, but Cafe Spiaggia is superior.  The room is well decorated, but the atmosphere needs immediate improvement. The soundtrack was 90s wuss rock (Hootie, Spin Doctors, etc). It became a bad joke as the night went on. Also, the lights are way too bright. Candles are on the tables, but are totally unnecessary as they are overpowered by the ceiling lights. Are there no dimmer switches in Baffo? The food was generally good, but inconsistent. We had the charred octopus, which we liked until about halfway through-- which is when we became overpowered by its saltiness. The chestnut crepe was a solid appetizer and one that I would recommend. The special pasta was bucatini with scallops, which was good but not particularly ""special."" Highlight of the night was a squid ink fettucine with lobster, which I would rate among the best pasta I've ever had. Seriously, this is a must-get standout dish. We shared the ""Sicilian life guard style"" calamari, which was just OK. The gelati were great. Baffo's cocktails are pricey, but very good. In particular, the Rosemarino and La Tempesta cocktails are highly recommended. Service was generally fine, but not what I'd expect of a place of this caliber (or at least what Baffo aspires to). Our waiter was nice, but seemed hazy on the descriptions of some dishes. We barely put a dent in the calamari (too full) and one of the runners asked if we wanted it wrapped. We said ""yes"" and that was the last was saw of the calamari and the runner.  At Baffo's price point, I expect a lot more. Maybe this place will improve over time, but in the meantime, I cannot recommend this place. Also, Baffo should work to distance itself from Babbo. Babbo has achieved near-legendary status, which sets a level of expectations that Baffo is nowhere close to meeting.",0.9974,0.77,0.204,0.026,0.5667619047619047

When we got to the restaurant they made us wait around 15 minutes for a table. They were extremely apologetic and even gave us complimentary wine.  The menu is set up for each person to order an antipasti (appetizer), Primi (pasta), then Secondi (main entree dish of meat or seafood). However, it is totally unnecessary to order all three. Some of the pastas are generous in size and enough for dinner.  I had the veal carpaccio for my appetizer. It was incredible and enough to share! Others I dined with had the tonno and animelle. The tonno is not as generous of a portion. The animelle is a larger portion. We enjoyed all three dishes.  For the primi portion of our meal we had the orechiette. Which is a lamb sausage with broccoli. It was delicious and an extremely generous portion. It is enough for dinner! We also ordered the beef cheek ravioli and garganelli. Both were smaller in portion size in comparison to the orechiette. However, good to have if ordering a larger entree.  For the secondi we had the lamb chomps and NY Strip. We also had a side of farrotto. The farrotto is like a risotto with beet juice. We didn't care for it. I ordered the stuffed pasta with foie gras as my dinner. It was incredible! It was a smaller portion, but very rich. I think this dish would be better suited as a starter before dinner.  Overall our dining experience was very positive.

But tonight my husband had a focus group a block away (and free parking across the street) and it was the last night in a long time that the weather won't be awful.  Got the last scheduled res. they had, a day in advance. Hopped a cab, got there early, explored Eataly (not long enough to do major damage before hubby texted me he was in the bar. They took us 15 min. before our scheduled res., which was a plus. Free coat (and shopping-bag) check. One ""minus:"" the dim romantic lighting (hey, we're aging boomers).  But with the aid of lighted reading glasses, we deciphered the menu.  So many decisions, so little time.....so we chickened out and went for the tasting menu. At $110 pp it was pricey but a third cheaper than most others in the city. We sprung for the premium rather than std. wine pairings---definitely worth it.  Not only did we discover wines and foods we normally wouldn't have tried (a blanc de noir sparkler from Lombardy that gave vintage Champagne a run for its money, a surprisingly herbaceous Barbera d'Asti, a swoon-worthy Barolo), but a grass-fed beef tartare that was rich despite its lean-ness, just the right size portion of linguinetti with a veal demi-glace, a sirloin with braised salsify that was perfectly mid-rare and tender, and imaginative cheese pairings (including an artisanal Parm Reg. made from the milk of a D.O.C. cow breed), ending with a dark chocolate-amaretto terrine.  Only five courses....but unlike any other tasting menu in the city (and we've done Charlie Trotter's, Arun's, Trio--Achatz' first kitchen--and Graham Elliott) we brought home LEFTOVERS. Not because they weren't good--but because the portions were quite generous.   The bread and Umbiran olive oil kept coming till we cried ""Zio!"" and we didn't get the fish-eye for ordering tap water rather than Pellegrino.  And they knocked a few bucks off for the dessert because it was a belated birthday celebration. Business or smart-trendy casual was the order of the day--but dressy would not have been out of place. I wouldn't wear blue jeans, but I doubt you'd get a disapproving stare. (FWIW, I wore black skinny jeans, dressy boots, nice blouse and swing jacket; hubby wore tie but no jacket).  Soundtrack was SiriusXM's 60's channel, at a very muted background level.  Service was gracious and attentive (neither rushed nor glacial), the captain and sommeliére (yes, female) knew their stuff, and we'll definitely be back to try the a la carte offerings.  A nice touch was that they hand-wrote the wine selections down for me to take home--only the std. ones are on the website.  Go early and explore Eataly--but don't go overboard buying unless your fridge is empty.  You will NOT leave Baffo hungry unless you are extremely disciplined, verging on ascetic.",0.9897,0.864,0.104,0.032,0.495463924963925
2014-01-21,3.0,"Baffo is supposedly comparable to Babbo, Batali's Michelin-rated restaurant in New York. However, I really do not think this place would get a Michelin star. It's nice, but not exquisite. The portions are tiny and the flavors are average. I was expecting a better-than Spiaggia meal and it definitely did not meet that.  I would not go back again, but if I did I would get the Pappardelle, small but delicious, and the Pork Jowl. The combination of pork, cherries, and brussel sprouts really does the job. The foie gras and chicken live ravioli is a little too rich for my taste. The ambiance is really average. The floors really down-play the overall feel of the restaurant.  The service is also incredibly slow and not what I would expect at a nicer restaurant. They only brought 6 amuse bouches instead of 7, which was the number of people at our table. We waited about 15 minutes for the last one, no joke. The bread was limited and same with the butter (although delicious), and it took them forever to bring more. We had to tell another waiter to bring our bill because ours was no where to be found.  All in all, I would highly recommend going to Spiaggia for fine Italian food, or buy products from Eataly and make your own food at home!",0.9773,0.831,0.136,0.033,0.4906575608299746

2014-01-13,4.0,"I visited Baffo with my brother and some friends and we were all pretty satisfied by the end of the meal. I'll admit I was apprehensive, with it being a part of the tourist/suburbanite-laden ""Eataly"" and all, but they delivered. The restaurant isn't huge so it feels intimate and not overly chain-like despite the Eataly association, so I definitely give them much credit on emphasizing quality here. The staff was polite and kind and offered us a complimentary coat check and seated us quickly. It's an intimate and romantic ambiance while simultaneously offering a view out into the street ... it's all really well balanced. The quality was at a solid above average level, and it remained so throughout the meal. Our server was attentive and knowledgeable, took our orders and suggested a good portion size for us. We had the polpo alla piastra (octopus), capesante crude (scallops), ravioli di guancia (beef cheek ravioli), and the fettuccine nere (squid ink lobster fettucine). We weren't disappointed by any of the dishes at all, but the least memorable was the fettuccine, but it was good don't get me wrong. Another reason to skip is I think between 2 people you can get away with just the first 3 dishes and be alright unless you have a huge appetite. The charred octopus was really delicious and a great way to whet the appetite. It was perfectly cooked, and had some tasty seasoning, highly recommended! If you've never had octopus, I guess you could say (slight cringe) it's kind of like chicken in texture but more even from the outside in and not as tough ... live a little! Get it! Yes you! The capesante crude (scallops) are some of the best scallops I've ever had. I really loved the contrast between the small creamy scallops against tiny bits of grapefruit and chile. It sounds weird, yes, but you'll be pleasantly surprised. The dish that really had us going 'mmm' was the ravioli di guancia which is a beef cheek ravioli with black truffles and castelmagno cheese. The combination of which is super rich, tender, and delicious. I feel like this is a great dish for those adventurous and not alike and a dish you guys should be proud of. The only real snag I thought we experienced was when they brought the food out the runners didn't know what was what nor did they speak very good English. They had no clue who had what and our waiter had to help sort it out and was not apologetic about it. Also some of our table didn't order smaller plates, so once the bread ran out it was awkward timing for some people to have actual plates and others to not even have bread. I do also feel that while the food was great, the prices are just a tad higher than they should be. We wrapped up our meal at a little over 50/person (with a drink) and then took an internal staircase up to Eataly to peruse ... another nice touch, and I didn't even notice the loudness of upstairs at all throughout our meal. ------ As for all the bad reviews I see here, and this place being associated with Eataly, which is a destination of the masses of Chicago, I thought I'd mention a few things for those reading the negative ramblings: - Many are from people who signed up for Yelp just to complain about this 1 experience. They literally have 1 or 2 (probably both negative) reviews total, and these are not reviews you should take seriously as their method of critique is weighted and without perspective. - Stop complaining about truffle prices. If you don't know what they are then why did you order them? No one put a gun to your head and said ""the truffles!!!! or it's lights out"". The waiter told you there was an upcharge and you -chose- not to ask the price, for who knows what reason. Don't chalk your laziness or desire to look like you know what you're doing/cool up as the restaurant's fault when it blows up in your face. Ask questions, at every restaurant for that matter. Again, no guns involved at Baffo. - Some of these reviewers may not have known what to expect and it wasn't the experience they're used to receiving. Next time you visit a nice restaurant, read the menu, get a feel for the prices, and/or if you're unsure of how a meal might be structured (small plates) or cost give them a call. You can't blame the restaurant if you're the one who didn't do basic research.",0.999,0.751,0.191,0.058,0.606822222222222

2014-01-05,4.0,"First thing I noticed was how small, neat, and quiet this restaurant was. Also, it was very 'movie-theatre' like, romantic, with dim light settings. Complimentary coat-check, a bar at the side. I'm not sure why some reviews rate this restaurant so poorly- it is a River North restaurant, and it's new. So you can't be overly picky about how the wines are all in Italian, looking at the menu beforehand, and you have to be easy on the waiters. It takes time for a restaurant to go into it's perfection, and I feel like they opened quickly. One thing about big prices is you have to be a bit of a foodie, and come with appreciation for culture and not knowing it all.  Reservations were made on  seatme.com . There are two entrances to the restaurant, one from the outside, and one by going to the second floor in Eataly, back towards the Pizza restaurant, and taking the stairs down.  Expensive menu. Great food, very delicious, but expensive. If you're not looking to spend a great amount, and want delicious Italian food with not quite as a romantic and quiet setting, go to Piccolo Sogno Due.  In a group of 5, we all got tastings of each others foods. From Octopus, to Ravioli, to beets. Our waiter explained the menu in more detail when we asked him about it. Yes, there were some mistakes, like they took a really long time to bring out the bread, food, and our wines. They misplaced our plates of what we ordered and then switched them without apologizing. They have some learning to do, but we were lucky enough to get the reservations.  So my advice is go with a heavy wallet, and possibly just go in for a tasting of a dish or two. So go with a half full stomach. It's an experience we shared with good friends, but I also could have passed it up or waited a few months longer, for when they get a little more space and had time to perfect their service. We skipped on dessert, and went to Eataly for the Nutella and Gelato bar. Another way to save a little bit more money!",0.9963,0.811,0.178,0.012,0.48312570145903494
2014-01-04,1.0,"I could not make a reservation online, but I was in the area and walked in and asked if they had cancellations because of the bad weather. The hostess said that they had cancellations and could accommodate my party, so I said I would be back with the rest of my party in 30 minutes. They confirmed my reservation. When I came back, on time, they gave my table away to another party. Don't come here unless you like stuffy people and rude staff.",0.631,0.761,0.147,0.092,0.4533333333333333
2013-12-30,1.0,"I was really surprised, but this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had in the City of Chicago.  I was really excited about trying this place out because I love a new restaurant and I had really high hopes.  I think the biggest problem was that the waitstaff we had seemed really inexperienced.  They were very awkward with wine presentation.  It was ceremonious to the point where it got in the way of actually serving us.  For example, the waiter came over at the end of the entree meal and filled my entire wine glass and left with about a quarter of the wine bottle left even though everyone else at the table had an empty glass.  I called him back over to point out that everyone else might like more wine and he said ""it will be a few more minutes"" (the bottle of wine was within eye-shot and there was literally no reason why he wouldn't bring the wine bottle over other than the fact that the waitress hadn't asked us if we wanted dessert yet.)  This would have been easily forgiven but then we got the bill. You see, each of us ordered pasta entrees which are fairly reasonably priced around $21- $30 a plate. As the waitress was taking our orders, she asked each of us if we would like truffles on top of our dishes ( in the same manner that she would ask if we wanted Prosciutto or Parmesan,  for a supplemental cost of course).  A few of us said yes.  The food was really good, I had the pumpkin ravioli which was terrific with the shaved truffles on top.  We were all in a great mood and enjoying each others company when the bill came and there was a charge for the shaved truffles for OVER $200!   We confronted the waitress and she did point out to us that she indeed told us it was a ""supplemental cost"".  Which, in most cases- fine, fair enough.  But when it is 2 and a half times the price of the entree, YOU SHOULD PROBABLY CLARIFY.   She scurried away with the bill and promised to talk to the manager.  We gave her the benefit of the doubt and assumed that this matter would be handled properly with management.  In short- it was not.  The manager came over with a snooty attitude and ARGUED with my father in law saying that he should have known!  After much back and forth, the manager finally agreed to take 2 of the three truffle charges off of the bill.  I tried to justify it by assuming that our particular waitress must have been new or inexperienced but we saw another couple arguing with them about the same thing.  So there you go, if you want to try this place, I suggest staying away from the truffles, or at least ask exactly what ""supplemental cost"" means if you hear your waitress say that under her breath.",0.9911,0.806,0.134,0.06,0.4814187327823691

Then came the moon shaped pumpkin-stuffed pasta....absolutely wonderful. A side of beet risotto -like pasta was very tasty.  The waiter, Carl, was very knowledgeable about all the dishes.

Other dishes were unusual with good flavor. One order of lamb chops came to the table raw and was sent back. Took forever to recook and by the time they were recooked,  the rest of the table had cleared their plates. Service was decent but there is an overall pretentious atmosphere about the place. I would give it some time to grow. Also, if you valet, beware....picking up the car takes FOREVER. I am not sure where the valet parks the cars, but it's not close. I would recommend parking yourself close by...there are lots of garages.",-0.1815,0.918,0.042,0.04,0.45939184746877054
2013-12-22,5.0,Even though Baffo is part of the big Eataly establishment it clearly separates itself into a fine dining category.  The ambience was sophisticated but not pretentious.  Since they just opened the wait staff told us they were controlling the amount of reservations so it was not overly crowded but all tables were full. Our server took the time to explain the wine menu to us since it is broken down by Italian Regions.  A suggestion would be to add this to the website so people have the time to do a little research if they are not familiar with Italian wines. Since my husband and I are not big eaters but wanted to try several items we were concerned about portion sizes.  Our server was very detailed in explaining the sizing of the dishes (which are perfect proportions) and told us she could control the spacing of the items to allow time to properly digest everything.  We decided to share an appetizer (I wanted to try the octopus which was raved about) but my husband does not care for it so we shared the sardines.  Wonderful taste and very light.  We then decided to each order a pasta so we could taste each others.  My husband had the Lune di zucca which was very light and tasteful.  I had the richer pasta dish quadrelli di fegato which is stuffed with Foie Gras and chicken liver.  It was simply the most delicious pasta dish that I have ever had and my husband agreed.  We then split (the only dish they are allowed to actually split) the Calamari which was another gourmet delight.  Of course at this point we needed to stop but after looking at the dessert list and not being overly stuffed the server recommended the l'universo which she said was light.  It has a wonderful almond mousse center which is the 'light' part but it is inside a sinful and delectable chocolate (similiar to a tartufo) so I'm not sure I would consider it 'light'.  Anxious to try their gelato the next time. The entire entire experience was delightful from service to food and ambience. While the place was full it was conversation friendly.  Our server told us they were going to add more tables after a couple weeks and this concerns us.  The biggest complaint most restaurant customers have is Noise and tables on top of each other so you are listening to others conversations.  We would recommend that the management be careful not to ruin the wonderful dining experience to just make additional revenue.,0.9959,0.787,0.165,0.048,0.5714837819185644
