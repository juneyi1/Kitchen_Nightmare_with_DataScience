2015-12-20,5.0,"The name is play on Led Zeppelin's ""Dazed and Confused"" for those who are not old. Somewhat expensive but not beyond what I pay at Starbucks. What's different is where it is right off the Damon CTA stop and smack dab in the middle of one of the most interesting areas of Chicago, in my opinion. I come here to people watch as much as to get my carb fix. They have a walk-up window from the sidewalk so you don't even have to go into the place to get your donuts which is convenient (I've taken a picture of this odd idea that works quite well). The guy who opened the sliding window to serve me was really helpful in explaining some of the flavors even though it was a frigid day and I only bought one. Good sign of good people running the place. I loved the donut but I love most donuts. Stan's has a bigger selection (directly across the street) so if you are a pastry-holic you will want to go there, but this is a rockin's place that I gravitate to every time I am in the area.",0.9759,0.804,0.152,0.044,0.5326530612244899

I stopped by on a quest for an apple fritter, which incidentally eluded me yet again on my visit here on a Sunday afternoon as they were sold out of the darn things.  They have a walk-up window from the sidewalk so you don't even have to go into the place to get your donuts!  Convenient.  The cashier was really helpful in explaining some of the flavors, and they were really nice. I was able to snag a Lemon donut (it was called something else) and a Creme Brulee donut.  The lemon was basically a lemon glaze over a cake donut, so deliciously sweet and tart at the same time.  A really interesting balance.  I kind of wish the cake was a little bit lemony though, without the glaze it was just a cake donut.  Although, a really good cake donut.  The Creme Brulee I didn't get to eat since I gave it away, but the recipient did say it was an excellent donut.  I will have to go back and try for myself! This particular location is really interesting and you should be prepared to do some people-watching.  Passed through what looked like some either heavy rock or metal bands that were unloading gear (on a Sunday afternoon??) as well as some people lined up outside the place I think as part of a food tour (they had a guide and were trying the donuts).  It's a really eclectic area to say the least.",0.9942,0.818,0.174,0.008,0.46228070175438596

It goes along well with the maple taste and glaze donut is nice and fluffy.

2015-08-24,2.0,"Glazed & Infused caught my attention when I saw their pictures circulating around Instagram.  And what's not to be excited about? Red velvet? Chocolate shavings? Peanut butter? BACON? I couldn't wait to get my grubby hands on them. And with half a dozen visits under my belt, my thoughts are fleshed out enough to give an unbiased overview. Maraschino Cherry: Okay. The flavor was pretty lackluster, and the texture was a little too soggy for my liking. I didn't want to finish it.   Terry's Toffee: Good. I like the bits of toffee sprinkled on top, so it gave me a range of textures. The consistency of the doughtnut was good, as well. It complimented nicely with the smoothness of chocolate and the crunchiness of the toffee. Chocolate: Meh. I was immediately attracted to the white and dark chocolate shavings that coated this doughtnut, but overall, the presentation overshadowed the taste. If I had to do a blindfolded taste test between this and a chocolate doughnut from Dunkin' Donuts, I'd lose either way. Was it the prettiest chocolate doughtut I've ever had? Probably. Was it the best chocolate doughnut I've ever had? God no. Red Velvet: Eh. And I was really excited about this one. It was like eating a red velvet cake from the supermarket. I couldn't taste the quality or anything, really. The only good part about this was the cream cheese frosting. Raspberry Lemon Bismark: I did not enjoy this. The taste didn't intrigue me and it ended up being a disappointed mess in my car. No Bueno. Peanut Butter & Chocolate: A bad decision on my part. The peanut butter filling was so unsettling. The filling wasn't gooey or flavorful. It had the consistency of boston cream, and tasted as if someone mixed a teaspoon of peanut butter into a gallon of milk. It's as if Yoplait made a sugar-free peanut butter yogurt, and it was literally hurting my soul. Maple Bacon Long John: Best out of the whole bunch. The girl at the register was right about this recommendation. The bacon was both salty and sweet. It didn't have an absurd amount of grease, but had enough moisture not to resemble jerky. The doughnut had a nice consistency that resembled an actual doughnut, rather than a cake. The maple paired well with the bacon, which gave it much more depth than the other doughnuts. This one was the definite winner. The employees are really nice. No complaints in that department. Glazed & Infused has arguably a little more pizzazz than Stan's. Their Rosie the Riveter graffiti and cake embellishments have proved to garner buzz. Unfortunately, despite my high expectations, Glazed just didn't deliver. The Maple Bacon Long John and Terry's Toffee were the only ones I liked, which is concerning because that means I only enjoyed 2 out of 7 doughnuts. I hate to be ""THAT person"" but Stan's is across the street. I think you know where I'm going with this.",0.9729,0.763,0.141,0.096,0.5401809523809524

The first bite or two tasted okay, but disappointing. A few more bites in and the consensus was ""There's something not right about these donuts....."" They are very sweet and kind of flavorless.  We sampled : white chocolate praline,  red velvet, chocolate,  vanilla bean glazed, and apple fritter. The nuts on the praline were good and the apple fritter was decent. If I was ever forced into buying donuts from here again, it would be the apple fritter. Their server at the window was really friendly and helpful.

That's right, these guys have successfully integrated bacon onto a long john.  This thing is awesome, and it's fairly gigantic (definitely big enough for two to share if you're trying to be dignified in your indulgence).  I'm still eating it, but had to take a break to satisfy my compulsion to let the yelp universe know to go after this thing, and if I'm echoing a preexisting post then so be it!",0.9941,0.748,0.211,0.04,0.5443722943722944

It's a little hard to find - it's in Francesca's Forno, and the sign is on Damen, so it's not easily visable if you're driving down Milwaukee, you have to look for it. I bought three donuts - the Chocolate4, Peppermint Oreo, and Hot Chocolate Snowball (yes, we like chocolate around here). The donuts were okay. Not great, okay. The Peppermint Oreo was the best of the bunch for the flavor contrast - a very subtle mint in the donut and the oreos gave a little bit of crunch but weren't overpowering. But the Chocolate4 was a basic donut with chocolate frosting and chocolate curls on top. And the Hot Chocolate Snowball was just disappointing. From the photo and the description it sounded like rich chocolate cream would be just oozing out, but there was maybe a tablespoon of a chocolate custard (kind of like Boston Creme filling touched up with cocoa) surrounded by a lot of dough. These were good donuts, but good basic donuts, not worth paying $3 each for. Maybe next time I'll try one of the more unique flavors and that'll be a different experience, but for $3, I expect something more than just a so-so donut.",0.9686,0.82,0.139,0.04,0.5409188034188034

But lo-and-behold, the raspberry I sampled was AMAZING and hands down my favorite. It was gloriously fluffy, sweet and tart. A little crunch from seeds and a surprisingly thick, flavorful glaze. The chocolate I tried was trying too hard, and had too many elements on it that it made it far too sweet. It was decadent enough to be a hunk of fudge, and if that is your speed, go for it. The maple bacon was really good too, a nice balance of sweet and savory. The bacon was perfectly crispy. The creme brûlée was most disappointing. The glaze had a crisp to it, the filling was subtly sweet and creamy, like it should be....all of the expected elements were there, but for some reason it was very underwhelming. Overall though, all of the donuts far exceed your typical donut chain experience. And their coffee is great! Strong and acidic, which balances the intense sweetness of the donuts. My only other complaint is how expensive it all was, four donuts and a small coffee was almost $17. I knew what I was getting into, but I still had sticker shock.

Or when you decide to close before the time listed on the door & place a tiny sign on the door that can be missed it might be of good practice to just say sorry, we're closed rather than look at me with an irritated expression. What you guys do is great, but there's a difference between confidence & machismo. Perhaps find the line. All in all, it's pretty DOPE though",0.8555,0.833,0.103,0.064,0.5650793650793651

One Saturday I was just passing by after getting brunch and  noticed that the little donut shop was opened. I was so full from brunch and couldn't think of taking another bite of anything at that time. Instead I took a raspberry donut to-go and that was probably the brightest thing I did that day. Even though the donut was no longer fresh, I could imagine how much more amazing it would've been if I are it on the spot... Maybe I would've hurled and not eat a donut ever again but this is definitely a must try. I had the old fashioned and the red velvet that same day when my friend had it in her apartment. I would say the Raspberry is more liking because it's not too sweet and the raspberry flavor wasn't a huge flavor-over-kill. But you can't go wrong with any of their selections.

I'd been hearing rave reviews for several weeks, so I finally made my way to Glazed & Infused on a Friday night, since that's when they're open late enough for me to make it during their hours of operation. I took the Brown Line to Milwaukee and North Ave., descended the stairs, and ran across the street in time to get 2 of their last 4 donuts. Turns out that it was National Doughnut Day (How'd I miss that??), so they sold out earlier than normal. What timing, huh? Anyhoo, I got the Triple Chocolate, which was a really tasty, chocolatey cake doughnut, and the Vanilla Bean, which was a drrryyy cakey/bread-like ring, topped with a half inch of confectioner's sugar icing with specks. There was no particularly discernible vanilla flavor, however. Ok, so, only $3 wasted. Take 2: My sister was at a grocery store where G&I had set a table up from which they were selling doughnuts. Knowing me, she called to see if I were interested in some ""interesting"" doughnut varieties. I got the Maple Bacon doughnut and an apple fritter. The MB was a glazed long john with a strip of bacon lying on top. The glaze did, indeed, have a bit of maple-y flavor, and the bacon was a decent, peppery strip, but the doughnut itself may well have been a slice of Rhoad's Frozen Bread Dough, for all of the flavor it possessed (read: none). The apple fritter did not have much taste, either, and contained no more than four (4) small cubes of apple, and, maybe, an equal amount of bacon. BACON?!? In an APPLE fritter? Not a Bacon-Apple Fritter, or an Apple-Bacon Fritter, but an APPLE FRITTER. And, even after all of that, there was no oomph, no flavor, no sweet/savory goodness to speak of. Maybe it's just me, but I expect a $3 doughnut to be memorable--but in a good way, not because of the nearly foreign feeling that I just wasted calories AND money.

2013-03-30,3.0,"To be honest, I was not impressed with Glazed & Infused compared to other specialty doughnut shops in the city. I stopped by around noon on Saturday and the selection was limited.  There were only five flavors (red velvet cake, chocolate3 cake, apple fritter, chocolate glazed and crème brûlée).  The cake ones and the fritter looked heavy.  The chocolate glazed didn't look like anything special.  So, I decided to go with the crème brûlée.  The woman working at the shop told me that it is a customer favorite so I was sold. However, the doughnut was lacking in flavor.  First, I didn't see any brûlée marks on the sugared crust.  It did give the doughnut a nice crunch, but that was it.  Also, the ratio of filling to doughnut was not good.  All I could taste was the yeast.  The filling tasted very bland.  However, the doughnut tasted a lot better after I left part of it on the fridge overnight.  The crust got sticky, but the filing tasted more like crème brûlée. I decided that I can't just judge the place based on one doughnut.  So I went back the following weekend.  This time, I arrived a little bit before 11:00 and the selection was larger.  I sampled the blueberry lemon cake and the buttermilk old fashioned.  These two doughnuts tasted far better than the crème brûlée one! The blueberry lemon cake had pieces of blueberries in the cake.  Also, I absolutely loved the glaze.  It had just the right amount of tartness and sweetness.  Most importantly, I could taste all the flavors.  It was also not as dense as I had originally thought.  I definitely would eat this doughnut again. The buttermilk old fashioned tasted good as well.  I could taste the spiciness in the cake and I enjoyed the vanilla bean glaze.  These did look a little light, but I think that was just the way they prepared it or the glaze they used.  It's a good doughnut, but I much prefer buttermilk doughnuts from other places in the city. Overall, I'm glad that I tried their doughnuts again and I would stop by if I was in the area.",0.9807,0.823,0.121,0.056,0.5431623931623931

The man at the counter was very friendly and helped me pick out which four donuts I would be taking home to devour.  I ended up with two cake and two yeast donuts: bacon maple longjohn (a must!!!!), an Easter special banana pudding filled donut, chocolate on chocolate, and a good old fashioned (who doesn't love an old fashioned????). With four donuts and two coffees, my total was just over $18.  It's hard to say which donut was my favorite. Obviously, if you love bacon, and you love the salty-sweet combo, you must get the longjohn.  You will NOT be disappointed.  The banana pudding filling in the Easter special donut was REALLY tasty and not at all lacking.  The old fashioned was as to be expected, with a good balance of moisture in the cake.  Though still delicious, and despite my affection for chocolate, the chocolate cake donut was probably my least favorite. Maybe it was a just a poor victim of the Khloe Kardashian effect ( you know what I'm talking about ---perfectly fine when standing alone but when put next to something/someone more attractive fails to live up to the higher standard of acceptable beauty)...

2012-09-20,4.0,"I am addicted to doughnuts.  I follow the scene (what there is of one here in Chicago).  When I heard this was opening last year I was really excited.  I waited it out and finally this summer when they opened I was there on the 2nd day. My favorite doughnut is an original vanilla glazed yeast.  Typically if a shop can't do that right then I'm not sold.  I had very high expectations for G&I.  When it comes to yeast doughnuts, they need to up their game.   Plenty of people love them, but to me they really light, but they arent airy.  The best way to compare is they remind me of wonderbread. However, this does not deter me from G&I nor my 4 star review.  They would have 5 if they would change their yeast recipe, but I know they wont.   The yeast actually works for filled doughnuts and their fritter.  As I said before, I'm pretty basic in what I like so the fancy flavors weren't the initial attraction to this place.  The first time I went I had the vanilla bean glazed, apple fritter, and lemon cake.  I've already told you how I feel about the plain glazed.  I'm gonna review my favorites and why I keep coming back. Apple Fritter.  This has got to be the best apple fritter in the city right behind Old Fashioned Doughnuts. (which I don't get often because it's quite the treck). The apple to doughnut to glaze ratio is perfect.  It's fried perfectly brown (something a lot of places don't get right)  keeping it crisp, and their glaze seals the deal.  The only thing I'd change is I think this thing needs just a bit more salt. Lemon.  Can you say heaven?   I'm not that big of a cake doughnut person but this one really won me over.  So - lemon cake doughnut filled with lemon curd topped with lemon frosting and lemon zest.  It couldn't get any fresher tasting than that.  I could eat these all day. Chocolate x4 - This is like the lemon but with chocolate.  It's Chocolate cake filled with gnache, topped with chocolate frosting and chocolate.  It's chocolatey hence the name.   My wife says this is the best Chocolate doughnut ever. Creme Brulee - I got this last weekend and shared with my wife.  I had no expectations other than a girl from the time before raving about it because they were sold out.  I got it just to try and boy have I been missing out.  This doughnut blew my mind.  Because it's filled, the yeast doughnut is secondary to the filling.  The custard is sweet but not too sweet.  The carmelized sugar on top is hard, just like real creme brulee.  The contrast of the bitter burned sugar on top with the sweet custard in the doughnut really is just perfect.  Get this one if you go. I have had all their doughnuts except the Red Velvet (that doughnut doesn't interest me).  They are all very high in quality and taste.  I'd recommend this place to anyone and everyone.  While Doughnut Vault is still my favorite in Chicago (Dynamo my favorite in the US). Sometimes it's just not worth the hype or the wait.  I'm glad G&I is here, has multiple locations and cares more about filling orders and customer service then selling out and being trendy.  Bravo!",0.9959,0.801,0.146,0.053,0.5195620608899296

The Do-Rite old fashion is slightly better due to a better glazed, but they are quite similar so the biggest difference is the dollar variance in price which makes me cry inside. Lemon: Lemon everything is my favorite anything, but this way too strong and sour for a donut. That's saying a lot coming from me. My toothpaste is lemon flavored. Creme Brulee: The crunchy brulee and the creamy filling created an interesting textural experience. The problem is with the flavor, which was dull and boring. This may be desired by those who want a mild flavored, less sweet donut. But at $3.25 I need more umph or for it to do a load of my laundry.

But I didn't love the glazed doughnut, my favorite kind.  I think it is because glazed doughnuts fall into two types.  First there is the Heavenly kind, my favorite.  They are light and airy with a crisp sort of sugar glaze on them and when you bite in, they melt in your mouth and leave you with an attractive sugar glaze mustache.  The other kind is chewy and heavier with a gooier, fuller glaze.  Their glazed doughnuts fall into that kind which might be your favorite just not mine. However, I am not nearly as picky about cake doughnuts and I bought one just because the chocolate sprinkles looked so crunchy and good, and they were.  I am not an aficionado of cake doughnuts so this one tasted really good to me and the chocolate frosting/sprinkles had a deep dark delicious chocolate taste.

2012-06-02,5.0,"I placed my order ahead of time, which was a good thing since at 9AM on a Saturday they were already out of some flavors.  I got six different kinds, which were divided into pieces among family so all could be sampled.  Here's the play by play. Luscious lemon - A cake doughnut with lemon flavor within, a thin layer of lemon curd, then a thin layer of icing and lemon zest on top of that.  Among the three of us, the first bites drew two wows and one OMG!  The lemon is very flavorful yet not at all overpowering or sour.  The lemon curd (a sugary lemon infused spread with a custard texture for those not in the know; sold in jars at Trader Joe's and very good on its own) gives every single bite an explosive burst of lemon flavor, which is then disbursed as you chew.  Lots of food establishments have an overall good menu, but few have that single transcendent item that you'd request on Death Row.  This is such an item! Apple fritter - A very close second for favorite flavor.  A proper bit of icing, but not too much or overly crunchy.  Tender, juicy bits of cinnamon apple throughout, perfectly textured pastry.  Decadent yet not greasy.  This easily surpasses any apple fritter I've ever had, and I've had many.  The rest of the group agreed.  Another item that by itself justifies a trip.  Warning: you'll likely never want apple fritters elsewhere after this. Old fashioned - Buttermilk cake doughnut with vanilla bean glaze.  Just what it sounds like.  If you're old school and want a great doughnut, some icing, but not a lot of frills that interfere with the doughnut flavor, this is for you.  I expected it to be a bit plain compared to the other more exotic ones, but the consensus is that it's outstanding.  Definitely a good staple for any big order. PB&J - A very creative variety.  A bismarck with peanut butter glaze, a modest bit of chopped peanuts on top for crunch, and a very generous volume of raspberry jelly inside.  The jelly is smooth and completely free of seeds, which I greatly appreciate as it's the lone reason I sometimes avoid raspberry.  This one is tasty and something I think kids would love, but next to the sheer awesomeness of the lemon and apple varieties it didn't seem nearly as good. Crème brûlée - A bismarck with custard and a genuine Crème brûlée glaze on top.  This was by far the least favorite, which was stunning since two of us expected it to be the best.  The glaze was very crunchy to the point of being an unpleasant texture.  The bismarck itself and custard inside were good, but downright plain next to the others.  I wouldn't get it again.  They'd do well to abandon this in favor of a classic boston cream variety.  I know everyone makes that, but there's a good reason. Chocolate 4 - Chocolate cake doughnut with various chocolate, fudge and ganache throughout.  I thought this would be overwhelmingly chocolatey, but thankfully it wasn't.  The texture was very moist and pleasing, with none of the powdery overtone things with cocoa can have.  One of us is a true chocolate freak, but even she didn't rate this anywhere near the top three.  Good for sure, but outdone by the others. In conclusion, I've seen numerous reviews comparing this to other doughnut places they've been to.  What I have not seen is anyone willing to say they know of anything that compares to the life-changing greatness of luscious lemon or the apple fritter.  We joked that heavenly sounds could be heard as we ate those two.  So out of six varieties tried, that's two transcendent, one great, two above average, and one bad.  Once the last of them had been consumed, I beat my fist on the box and shouted ""Re-spawn dammit!""  If you love yourself, your family or your friends, you'll get them these doughnuts ASAP.  If you hate your enemies, you'll do the same, because their newfound addiction will send them to an early grave.",0.9987,0.746,0.191,0.063,0.5241269841269841

BTW, don't expect a paper receipt, supply your email and your receipt will be emailed to you.  That's what's IN :D",0.7734,0.835,0.098,0.066,0.5071180555555556
2012-05-22,4.0,"I tried Glazed and Infused Doughnuts today for the first time.  I believe they only opened up yesterday.   The girls that work there are bubbly, personable and welcoming.  Between them, it almost seemed like a forties theme as far as their outfits, which I liked!  It added to the vibe. There were probably eight to ten doughnuts on the menu and they were out of about half, which is fine because on the second day, no restaurant is going to have everything in sync yet.   The doughnuts available were great.  I recommend the apple  one, but my friend sure seemed to enjoy the lemon.   If they had all the items on the menu available I would have given them a 5.    This grab and go coffee and doughnut window is going to be a hit!",0.9623,0.825,0.164,0.011,0.5183760683760684
2012-05-22,4.0,"I've been waiting in anticipation for Glazed & Infused to open forever now... always let down by the 'opening soon' sign that hung on the window. The name alone had me hooked. Well today was finally the day, and it was definitely worth the wait! The doughnut selection is excellent, when they have them in stock. I don't understand why you offer such a great selection but only have a handful made. 2 days in a row I've been disappointed that they did not have the maple bacon long john, as was the customer behind me. Almost lowered my rating but the girls at the window were awesome and really nice.  Their doughnuts updated as I try all of them: Chocolate Glazed - The yellow cake ring was so moist and delicious. The 'mexique origine rare chocolate glaze' is just a fancy way to say chocolate covered sprinkles. Rich chocolate... this was a pretty traditional selection for the doughnut lover with the clear distinction in the moistness and denseness. Homer Simpson would approve.   Apple Fritter - This was a standout for me. Profound cinnamon and fresh chunks of apples in every bite. Finger lickin' good. Seriously, the vanilla bean glaze that covers the fritter and your fingers is sweet and delicious and will have you licking your fingers and in my case, the parchment paper as well. These are big fritters and I was on a sugar overload after this. Chocolate4 - I was highly disappointed with this as I have a crazy sweet tooth. Described as chocolate cake with chocolate fudge filling, chocolate ganache and chocolate streusel... this sounds simply divine. It feel short, way short. Felt like I was eating a DD doughnut. I did not get any chocolate fudge filling. Skip this one.  Luscious Lemon - This was the saving grace for me and a pleasant surprise. Soft and moist lemon cake filled with yuzu curd and topped with lemon glaze and candied zest. Wow! Each bite was so good... my only complaint is I barely got any filling. The lemon glaze on top was phenomenal and I wish they dipped the entire doughnut in the candied zest because they were amazing. One of my favorites so far for sure.  PB&J - Thought the jelly was ordinary but the peanut butter glaze on top had me licking my fingers and scraping the excess off the bag. Messy doughnut, I DO NOT recommend eating while driving.... Next on my rader are the Maple Bacon Long John (if they ever have these in stock?), Creme Brulee, and Red Velvet. Their doughnuts are all trans fat free... so that means they are like healthy right? Right??  This isn't your neighborhood Dunkin' Donuts. These doughnuts are handcrafted. The prices reflect this... $1.75-$3.25 per doughnut. $30+ for a dozen? Guess I won't be bringing a dozen for my coworkers, they'll get DD munchkins while I opt for Glazed & Infused.  Late night hours too. This is dangerous... I can see myself waking up after a night of partying with a dozen doughnuts crumbled in my bed.  Great addition to the neighborhood, but not so great for my diet!",0.9989,0.731,0.227,0.042,0.6270166536559978
2012-05-21,4.0,"While I stepped in I think on the first day they opened (funny how first to review was three days before today), I've been anticipating this place for a while now.  I work across the street and seemingly every day someone from my office would ask ""hey- is that donut shop open yet?"" Let me first say that the idea behind putting a donut counter inside Francesca's Forno is a great one.  A walk-up window with access to Damen just south of the infamous ""crotch"" intersection will be sure to be hopping, especially late at night when all the wankstas from the clubs and bars come pouring out, as well as the massholes who like to be seen and a part of the scene at Big Star. I wish I had half a brain to think about setting up something with as small an over head as renting a back counter at a restaurant with access to a take out window. But I are dumbs, and such is life. On to the donuts (that I tried today): -Maple and Bacon-  Good, but something about it was heavy-handed to me.  I'm not one of those people that reenacts the screems of delight from every teen age girl who caught a live performance by the Beetles back in the 60's each time I see bacon on something.  Bacon can be a nice compliment, especially to sweet things.  The bacon on this long john was actually perfectly prepared- or at least the way I like it.  Thick, meaty, fat cooked through and through, and not burnt.  With that said, the fact that it was an entire slice of bacon over a long john left the donut a bit rich for my taste.  But for the rest of you who love bacon like Jerry loves his Kids, you'll surely love this thing. -Old Fashioned (Glazed)-  Nice flavor, and the glaze was perfect, but the donut itself was a bit heavy.  I realize that old fashioned cake donuts tend to by heavier than thier yeast-based sisters and brothers, but the one I had today was... well... hard.  Like I said- the flavor was very nice, so I'm being picky here.  Still, it may make a difference as to when these types of donuts are made (considering, I'm almost positive they aren't made on site here, but at another one of their locations). -Raspberry Glazed-  The winner of the bunch, by far.  This one was the perfect amount of raspberry tartness, accompanied by sweet yeast-based dough, perfectly weighted, with a great chew and wonderful balance.  Simple and delicious. The three donuts, plus one large/medium/small coffee (they only have one size) came out to be just over $10.00.  While that isn't overly expensive, it comes out to be probably around $2.50 per donut.  These aren't overly big donuts, so if you are used to buying them on the cheap at places like DD or where ever, just be aware of the cost. The only other thing to add was that being greeted and taken care of by three lovely young women with such incredibly genuine and friendly demeanors, who clearly looked very happy to be there added to the positive experience. I'm sure they'll be seeing plenty of my soon-to-be fat self...",0.9995,0.742,0.253,0.005,0.5982935935316888
