2016-08-09,5.0,"This place is a hidden gem. It is indeed hidden, it is in the big building across from the chase bank. We got the bruschetta and it was one of the best I've ever had. For my main dish I got the vodka rigatoni and it was amazing. My dinner mate got the chicken scaloppine and it was equally as good. Most meat dishes come with a side of penne so you don't have to worry about missing a pasta experience. The chocolate mousse cake was also great and all other desserts looked good as well. Now I have to mention the service, I was blown away.  Everyone was welcoming and when we could not find the restaurant we called and they were very helpful. The waiter was nice and about five other waiters checked on us and served us. There was a waiter there that was most kind. He helped us pick our dessert and when we left we had two to-go bags and we started walking out. He then stopped us and gave us a shopping bag to put them in so it was easier to carry. The restaurant itself was very clean and pretty inside. I am visiting and I would definitely comeback in my next visit. Just a side note.... I walked in wearing my Cubs hat but had a nice dress on, as soon as I looked around I took it off. It is definitely a nice dressy place.",0.9861,0.822,0.166,0.012,0.5444

This was our first visit and Iam so happy we came. We made a reservation for 6 p.m. and were seated promptly. Our waiter immediately came to the table to take our drink orders. They had a very large wine selection with nice choices for reds and whites. I chose a California Red which was extremely well made. We then decided on an appetizer of bruchetta. As there were six of us, the waiter advised us this appetizer came as four pieces. He told us he would bring out six pieces so we didn't have to order two orders. Very nice offer. My son ordered a cup of Minestrone soup, and I must say the portion looked more like a bowl. He couldn't finish it, so I decided to try it. Delish is the perfect word. I then ordered the Penne Puttanesca. The sauce had a very strong tomato taste with a bit too much salt, but overall it was extremely flavorful. Plenty of olives, tomatoes, capers with fresh basil and white wine sauce. They also provide customers with a nice bread basket which included some tasty garlic bread squares and slices of italian bread.

2015-12-30,4.0,"I've come here twice (and will come here again) for one and only one reason: the tortellini carbonara! I ordered it without bacon since I don't eat pork, but it tasted really good. Every bite of the yummy cheese-filled tortellini was heaven. And the mushrooms were so good. And the peas. And the sauce. Just really yummy! The one thing that really satisfies me about restaurants is leaving full and NOT hungry, and fortunately, I can barely finish this dish because I get so full, even though I eat A LOT. I take my leftovers home, and it tastes just as good.  The atmosphere is really corporate-y, especially during prime lunch time. I went once for lunch with my co-worker, and then again for a business meeting. Since there a lot of firms and big companies right above Rosebud, you'll see majority of the customers are dressed in business professional attire. So, to mesh in, it's best if you dress ""up"".  Additionally, the restaurant was loud. I've noticed this is quite common at the Rosebud restaurants, since the tables are placed really close to eachother. But then again, I come during lunch time, so I can't really complain.  I also LOVE how there are different Rosebud restaurants scattered across Chicago, so if I'm ever craving the love of my life, tortellini carbonara, it warms my heart to know that I'll either be a walk, a bus ride, or door a way!",0.9962,0.79,0.21,0.0,0.4556547619047618

Today I got off of work rushed to come get m6 favorite chicken noodle soup that is served on Tuesdays only. I come so much that my order is already in the system. Majority of the staff knows me. But today in particular there were some new faces.  I came in asked for one of the servers I normally go to but he had a big party. So I made a mistake and thought that this other waiter had took my order and said yes he has taken my order before but that I would rather go in the section of my normal server. Big mistake.....  So the manager sat me down and I'm thinking that I'm in the server section that I wanted and ended up in the replacement waiters section. Who was rude,  very wired like he was high off something. He hardly let me or my guest get a word in. I told the general manager Joe Leopold about how bad the service was and instead of him apologizing he starts yelling at me about how its my fault for the bad service. He has no kind of respect for long time customers who has spent excellent money here. My mother has done a lot of business lunch and dinners here and this is the thanks that we get. To be treated like dirt especially by the general manager is unacceptable and not tolerated. Never got my food, we left and will never return again.

To steam a small lobster tail takes all of 4 minutes but I had to wait over 15 minutes to get one. By then I was done with my steak & mac-n-cheese and full.

First the good:  we had a reservation and the hostess called us to confirm, and inform us that they were pretty booked up and with the NFL draft going on make sure we're on time so they can get us to our show on time.  Good service, right?  Then there was our server - he was super nice and bubbly and attentive.  Then there were (some) of our drinks - my one friend said his jamo/ginger was made nice and strong the way he likes it.  Then there's (some) of the food - the pasta dishes we ordered were to die for - highly recommend the Tortellini Carbonara and the lobster ravioli, though I think the latter may have been a special. Now Mr Hyde comes in:  remember the ""helpful"" hostess confirming our reservation?  The place was half empty when we arrived, so not sure what she meant by fully booked.  And that server?  He was kinda quirky and kept saying ""jay-moooo"" in a weird voice anytime anyone ordered one, also didnt allow the lady at the table to order first, and forgot a round of cocktails.  Speaking of cocktails, remember the strong ones?  The 'specialty' drinks such as the Rosebudtini and vodka mule were weaker than my biceps.  And that great food!  Yeah, don't order steaks from here - the t-bones were tough as leather, and the filet was bad, too.   Some good, some bad, but for downtown dining this place didn't live up to the Rosebud name.  Darn that Mr. Hyde....",0.9495,0.83,0.118,0.052,0.6344747899159664

Rosebud has several locations in and around the city; this was my third visit to this location when I came here recently to meet some friends before a theater show. My first visit was when i was fresh out of college and I worked in the Morgan Stanley offices in the same building as an intern. The visit was my ""farewell dinner"". The second time was a business dinner with UBS.   The most common thing that I remember from my earlier visits was that the food was average but the service was excellent. On this particular occasion it was pretty much the same. The group that I was with had a large dinner buffet and a section of the restaurant reserved for us. We were served meatballs, cheese, chicken, pizzas, etc....standard bar food. The meatballs were great but the rest of the food was OK. I had a business lunch a few years ago at another Rosebud location in the city; I find it odd that that location had much better food with the same amount of great service.

2012-12-29,2.0,"First of all, trying to find the valet parking for this location is annoying as hell.  I had to call the restaurant twice just to get someone to tell me where the entrance to the valet was because why would it be in front of the restaurant?  FYI: You need to enter the valet on Dearborn, which is a one-way going south, so you'll likely end up circling the Chase Bank Building a few times before you get the hang of it.   Also, there's a Rosebud in this office building kiddie corner from the Rosebud Prime?  It seems a bit odd to me, but that's fine.  Valet is $11.99 or $20 (flat rate) for 3+ hours (which is nice if you're going to a show). They have a good ""wines by the glass"" list, with several selections under $10.  Their pours are weak, though, so you'll end up having a few glasses and not even getting close to downing a bottle.  Full bar available, so you can order to your heart's content.  No beers on tap, which sucks, and they're all pretty pricey. The menu is pretty standard Italian fare at outrageous prices.  There is no pasta dish (sans meat) under $15.  Yikes.  My mom ordered the steak and lobster special for an outrageous $45 and said the steak wasn't very tender or cooked well.  C'mon, the cut of meat should at least be good for that price.  My pasta was probably the only good thing about the meal since it had jalapeno marinara sauce.  My husband's ravioli were pretty decent but, again, super expensive. I'll likely never come back here.  It's convenient if you're seeing a show nearby, but there's other dinner options so I'd choose one of those.  Or, I'd go to a late dinner in another neighborhood after a show.  Skip Rosebud Theater District if you can.",0.9544,0.789,0.126,0.085,0.550374149659864

2012-12-11,5.0,"Rosebud is by far my favorite restaurant in Downtown Chicago. Of all the Rosebud's I have been to, this is by far my favorite location. I first had this restaurant when I started my internship in June 2011 and it was a part of my welcome lunch to the company. I remembered ordering some kind of pasta while my supervisors and the hiring manager ordered the some kind of pork chop off their lunch menu. The food as I remembered it from the first time was excellent and it kept me coming back multiple times. For dessert we all had the Sundae and I was surprised when the cup came out coated in fudge and nuts. It was by far one of the more decadent desserts I have had by that point.  Since then I've had this location in particular 4+ times. When I returned for their lunch menu again this summer, I got the steak sandwich with fries which I could barely finish but found excellent and the carrot cake for dessert which was delicious and decadent. Their lunch menu is an excellent value and very reasonable priced for downtown. I've never had to wait for seating, and they treat you extremely well. Regardless of you age or appearance. Usually it becomes an issue because I am a 19 year old into fine dining and waiters will usually treat me rudely at times because they don't think I would tip. I usually leave about a 20% tip on a $40+ meal. At Rosebud the service is fast and never intrusive (as far as this location goes) and the food is always spot on. I've made one of my favorite memories of the year here. At the time I had this meal, I was dating a guy who was about to leave the city after graduation from UChicago and we wanted to celebrate our anniversary dinner. I had mentioned that and Rosebud went out of their way to accommodate us. They gave us a nice booth in the private corner of the restaurant and made sure to give us the utmost privacy to enjoy the night which ended perfectly with a horse and carriage ride. The waiters occasionally came to check up on us and we could hear them commenting on  the sweetness of it all. He ordered clam chowder. We ordered mussels for the appetizer. And I ordered the steak. At the end of the dinner when they brought us the check, the brought us a complimentary chocolate mini cake, to help us celebrate. It was the highlight of my night.  Overall I love this location. The atmosphere is always spot on, they always have your table ready on time, the food will keep you returning, and their bread is always the greatest.",0.9984,0.788,0.195,0.017,0.6456878306878308

The soup listed assorted fish, which usually means, leftover crap that didn't get sold or will go bad soon.  Suprisingly, it was very tasty and delicious. Dinner was chicken parmesan and a Chef's special peppercorn encrusted filet over grilled asparagus and brocolli.  The parmesan was friggin huge, like ostrich breasts.

Food was good.  I had tomato bisque soup and the steak sandwich, which was excellent; flavorful and tender.  My father got linguini and clams; he said he orders it often at various restaurants and this was the most amount of clams he's ever gotten.   The only thing I didn't like food-wise were the ""fries"" that came with my sandwich.  They were shoestring style (fine) but completely crispy -- I want my fries to have some potato and give to them.  They were really chips.  Not a big deal, but where else except Yelp can you vent about something like fries that are really chips?",0.9138,0.881,0.087,0.033,0.5393825980782502

Then we got out food! Hooray!!! But mine was missing a key ingredient, the basil. He took it back to have it added. When he came back I could see they put 3 whole flakes of fresh basil on it. Not cool. I usually eat my pasta w/ a fork and a spoon. But no spoon. So I used some bread.  We ate our so-so food. It wasn't bad but nothing I haven't made at home. Then we sat.

My Caesar and my husband's chopped salads were fresh, but barely dressed. It was the main course that was the most disappointing.  I selected something I can't remember the name of, but it was described as ""squares"" of pasta with a tomato and basil sauce, and I ordered a side of Italian sausage.  The ""squares"" were about the size of a cocktail napkin; there was a pile of them (one on top of another on top of another) in about a two inch stack, and red sauce was poured over it.  The pile of pasta was limp and tasteless.  The sauce was decent, but nothing special. The sausage was a big disappointment; dry and not very flavorful.  My husband's penne with tomato vodka sauce was also disappointing.   As so often happens, the waiter checked in to see how we liked our meals as we were taking our first bites (before we had time to even give it any real attention), then he was out of sight.  But it didn't take us long to come to the conclusion that the food's flavor and interest wasn't enough to warrant the calorie load.  My dish had a small dent taken out of one side of the pasta stack, and I'd eaten half a sausage.  My husband left more than half of his.  We didn't expect to have the waiter make any adjustments (after all, we'd eaten the appetizer and salad and some of our food), but we did expect an offer of a dessert or coffee.  To be fair, when he offered the dessert menu we said we weren't interested.  But I'd like to have had some consoling words, anyway.  He did ask about the uneaten food and we explained why we were disappointed, but his attitude was kind of ""ah, you can't please everyone.""",-0.9112,0.851,0.062,0.086,0.4836607142857143

Things started out ok- our waiter was friendly, and my fiance and friend were both very excited about the lobster ravioli special.  One complaint from my fiance was that his bourbon and soda was actually a bourbon and seltzer, but aside from that everything was good so far.  After we ordered our food, our waiter came back about 5 mins later to say that they only have enough ingredients for one of the specials.  My friend kindly gave up her plate for a  spicy pasta dish instead.  We were also served our apps, the shrimp cocktail and Bruschetta.  The shrimp was good and my friend like the bruschetta, but it was a little crunchy and stale tasting for my fiance's taste.  I also would have preferred it a little chewier.    Fifteen mins later, as we munched on bread and chatted about how a theater district restaurant could be out of the special BEFORE 7:00, another employee (not sure if it was the manager?) came back to say that the kitchen made a mistake and the can (CAN?) of filling that they thought was lobster was actually cheese.  So they would not be able to serve the other special.  Annoyed, my fiance ordered cheese ravioli instead and my friend asked if we could have a discount AND a bit of hustle since we did have a play to get to. When we finally got our food, I was starving.  Luckily, my meal- the penne and sausage- was really good.  The sausage was mildly spicy and went to so well with the perfectly cooked penne and the cheese and broccoli sprinkled on top.  I would have totally given this place 4 stars if not for the mishap with the other food.  Despite being let down by the lack of special ingredients, my friend and fiance seemed to enjoy their second choices as well.

Kara only visited those restaurants on special occasions because if she went too often, she would be 300 lbs. But one day she and a few friends decided to meet at the evil restaurant, Rosebud, to celebrate their friend's new job.  The mean old restaurant tempted her taste buds with culinary delights such as bread with olive oil and parmesan cheese; stuffed mushrooms swimming in a rich, garlic sauce; and lobster ravioli topped with marinara, sauteed spinach and red peppers. She even sampled some of her friend's chicken parmesan. As she gulped down the last of her pinot grigio and pushed her plate away, she felt satisfied but guilty at the same time. Kara hung her head in shame as the Evil Rosebud cackled maniacally in the background and sent his evil servant back over to offer her an enticing dessert. Kara opened her mouth to say yes but stopped before the words came out. She slapped herself, reached into her purse and pulled out the potent willpower elixir that her skinny friend, Skinny BItch, concocted just for her.

2009-10-17,4.0,"I made a reservation for a pre-theater dinner and was glad I did as the room was packed by the time I arrived with a friend at 6.45. Nonetheless John, our waiter, was tableside within a minute of our sitting down at the back of the room. Even with a table of ten on his radar he took time to greet us warmly and tell us about the specials. The menu was  a rather large card which managed to clear the low ceiling when held upright but rendered one's dining partner invisible. Luckily it didn't take long for me to see something appetizing to eat- their chicken Vesuvio ($17) which I recalled favorably from lunches of long ago. A shrimp cocktail ($13) sounded good too.  It was either that or the bowl of minestrone for $4 but as I was going to order a glass of Pinot Grigio ($12) I thought the shrimp the better compliment. Across the table a pre-theater special of baked ziti, including a spinach salad for  $17 was currying favor. John came back to take our order and offered to answer any questions we might have. He brought with him a basket of warm crusty bread and some olive oil/parmesan.  The wine and iced tea followed within two minutes so no complaints about the service, even though the place was swamped with customers including the needy table of ten, possibly on an annual Loud Talker Society dinner, some of the words beginning with the letter F. The fresh warm crusty bread dipped  in the oil and cheese kept us entertained for the ten minutes it took for the shrimp cocktail bowl to arrive. Alas the spinach salad didn't join it so we both nibbled on the shrimp which were four in number and fresh in flavor. Each clung to the side of the bowl like survivors in a life raft and were accompanied by four lemon slices. Somewhere in the depths of the large  8 inch bowl was a bed of lettuce buried under a pond of cocktail sauce. I was expecting more a small martini glass presentation and felt bad that most of the ingredients were destined for the bins in the alley at the rear. Food costs or wastage obviously not an issue there. The spinach salad was brought forth and was again, a huge portion of greens,tomato and croutons which were so tasty they were assumed to be made in-house. Portion was extravagant in that it was included in the entree. Over-generous which is not really a fault. There was a fifteen minute hiatus between courses which we occupied in conversation, although the din in the restaurant made semaphore more appropriate. We carry small flags for this purpose so no problem there. I would say that at this time of evening-before 8pm the restaurant is not a good place for a romantic date, but after the theater crowds go it would be just fine. John, rushed off his feet, as were all the staff, did come by occasionally to update us on the progress of our entrees as he knew we had to keep an eye on the time. With 20 minutes to spare we got our main courses and tucked in with gusto. No complaints about the food, served piping hot and tasting fresh and as advertised. It's not Spiaggia, nor do the prices suggest it should be. Portions again were generous. I drank one glass of wine and wasn't encouraged to have another so ended up with a bill just shy of $70 for two. The service was worthy of a 20% tip.

2008-03-06,3.0,"pricy, yes, but if you arent paying, it can be worth it. my coworkers and i went here for a combination we-won-our-trial and coworker-birthday lunch. i really had my eye on the steak sandwich, but as they make theirs with tenderloin (even though it includes giardinara on top which would mask the already low-in-fat, low-in-flavor cut of meat) it costs over fifteen dollars and is one of the most expensive things on the menu. steak sandwich. really. so i opted for the chicken vesuvio sandwich, a very interesting combination of a vesuvio boneless breast, lettuce, tomato, onion (lettuce and onion warmed and wilting together with a slight dressing, which i really loved) served with a green pea aoli (which was faaaantastic) and super thin french fries in a giant mound. the sandwich is one of the best i've been able to eat in the loop where i work (oh, i lament the lack of sandwiches!), but at eleven dollars a pop its not one i can afford to eat even weekly, nor would i feel good about paying that much for it if it were my money. everyone else seemed quite pleased with their meals, but again, with the two sandwich options being so terribly overpriced, the entrees were also a couple of dollars more than necessary. so, for prices, i am taking it down one star. the other star goes away because the tiramisu, while acceptable, was really lacking in flavor, and as i am kind of obsessed with good tiramisu this matters deeply. plus there's something about their iced tea selection, and their hot tea presentation, that i just find deeply stupid.",0.2022,0.787,0.11,0.104,0.5756944444444444

2008-01-14,1.0,"One of the worst restaurant experiences ever.  Horrible service, horrible food. First, when we were seated, one of the four side plates that was on our table was disgusting and greasy and covered with bread crumbs - there was a dirty and used plate there!   When the waiter came to take our order, I showed him the plate, honestly expecting a complimentary drink or ar at least a profuse apology.  But he said ""Oh, don't worry about it.  I can take that in a minute.""  Don't worry about it?  He was acting like I had done something and was apologizing, or that I had asked him to do something extra for me.  Like I was incoveniencing him by noticing the used plate I was expected to eat off of. He was generally rude and stupid as hell.  It took us forever to order because each time we said something, he would cut us off and say the name of the dish he thought we were ordering - only it would be the wrong one. Every time one of us said something, he interrupted us.  I asked him a yes or no question about the dish I ordered  ""Is the ricotta dumpling a gnocchi?"" and got a five minute explanation about how it's not like your ordinary pasta, and how it's not filled with anything, and that it's based on tomatoes. He probably meant potatoes, but he was dumb.   So I asked him again ""So basically it's a cheese gnocchi, right?""   ""No, it doesn't have any cheese in it - it's not a filled pasta like a tortellini.  You can't fill it with anything."" Okay, so clearly the moron doesn't know what ricotta is or what a gnocchi is.  And instead of admitting it he decided to just say a bunch of words. ""Okay, I'll just get that.  Also, I want extra veggies in it - I'll pay extra or whatever.  Can you do that? ""Actually, the dish doesn't come with any vegetables. Just a cheese sauce."" ""But it says here it comes with beans and roasted bell peppers and baby greens. And it doesn't say anything about a cheese sauce."" ""Okay, we can do that."" The fact that he was dumb as hell would have been forgivable if he wasn't impatient and abrupt and rude. The olive oil that came with the bread was delicious.  When he was at our table serving us water, my friend joked to him about stealing the olive oil.  Not only did he not smile - he just grabbed the bottle of olive oil off our table and walked away without saying a word.  We hadn't even finished serving the oil on our plates yet.  Unbelievable. I could give more details about his awful and rude service the rest of the night, but it would take too long.  So, the food:  My dish, which supposedly had the extra vegetables for which they charged me, barely had any vegetables at all.  The ""ricotta dumplings"" were chewy and tough and dry.  Obviously not made fresh. Here's a little lesson on cooking green veggies.  When you heat up a green vegetable, it releases an enzyme which dulls the color of the vegetable.  However, if the temperature is high enough, that enzyme degrades and the veggie keeps its bright green beautiful color.  Hence the school cafeteria puke colored green beans- they look like that because they've been cooked at a low temperature for a long time.  The green beans at Rosebud are of the same gross color and mushy, disgusting consistency.  The roasted red peppers were canned.  That's right.  I once worked in a sandwich shop where we sold $5 sandwiches, and we roasted out own peppers.  Not only did Rosebud serve us canned roasted red peppers, but they didn't even rinse the storage liquid from them, so the whole dish had that canned taste in it.  I couldn't taste any sauce at all - no basil, no discernable seasoning whatsoever.  It just tasted like oil.  That's all I could taste. The fact that I spent $16 plus $2 for the supposed extra veggies on this disgusting mess was unacceptable.  I mean, I know pasta is overpriced.  A box of pasta is less than a dollar, and a pasta dish at a restaurant probably has at the most $3 worth of ingredients in it.  I accept that.  But the fact that it also tasted like shit and was cooked badly is just beyond forgivable. I also couldn't taste either the espresso or rum in the tiramisu.  I could barely even taste chocolate.  It just tasted like sugar. Such a disappointing meal.    At least my friends were able to make a joke out of the whole awful experience.  By the end of the meal we were just sitting there laughing about how much the whole meal sucked.  We probably antogonized our retarded waiter even more, but whatever.  Thank god for good company.",-0.9908,0.741,0.11,0.15,0.536343537414966

The sheer amount of food they give you is enough to induce a food coma, unless you're smart enough to save some for another meal. Not to mention its absolutely delicious.  Whenever I cant decide what I want, I get their Cobb salad, although I have never been offended by anything I've gotten. They offer a typical ""Italian American"" lunch accompanied by four varying specials every day. Usually a fish, a sandwich, an entree, and a salad. They also offer a breakfast menu, and their sammiches are pretty dang good. I also am always greeted with a smile and their cook staff seems competent as they have never messed up when I have asked for substitutions. Seriously, the place is really good. I've worked at my job for 2 years and my boss gets their Minestrone at least 3 times a week... and has for probably over a year.

We went here on a Friday night, the night of Looptopia.  We were just walking around looking for a place to eat and wound up here.  Although it looked crowded at first, we were able to get a table right away.  The first thing I noticed is how incredibly loud it was there.  It was pretty impossible to hold a conversation. The service wasn't all that great.  I'm a stickler for having my water refilled and that didn't happen as often as it should have.  They completely forgot to bring the salad that my husband ordered.  They were obviously busy so I cut them some slack but it seems a place like this is busy quite often so they should be able to address that problem so that service isn't lacking. My food, personally was just okay.  I ordered the chicken parm and found that their marinara sauce was pretty bland.  The portion was huge and there was a lot of cheese which is a good thing.  More cheese=yummy in my tummy.  Hubby ordered some pasta with broccoli and sausage.  He liked it and recreated it at home later in the weekend.  Our son had some pasta and asparagus and didn't complain. I can see how this would be a cool place for the younger, non-child bearing scene but I can't imagine it being a good date place with all the noise since a conversation is impossible.  I imagine it's a convenient place to grab a bite before a show but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here to get Italian food.  I've had better elsewhere, with better service.",0.9872,0.833,0.141,0.026,0.5600793650793652
