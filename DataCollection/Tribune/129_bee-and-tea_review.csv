2016-03-30,1.0,was walking around the neighborhood and was craving for some boba drank.. i was warned by my other friends that this was not that good since they came here  before when there was a groupon deal for it.. anyways i ordered the taronator (taro) with boba..  I usually love taro boba tea or smoothie.. but yea.. not so much the way they make it.. it tasted very artificial and was overly sweet..,0.3393,0.89,0.065,0.045,0.5708333333333334
2015-12-29,3.0,"They used to have the open faced baos which were unique and so good. They also had bowls (quinoa, rice, chicken, veg, etc...) which were a solid quick meal. Then one day, I went in, and the open faced baos were replaced with closed baos... like the ones at Wow Bao. I just don't understand that decision. I could basically just buy those from the freezer section at a grocery store. Plus, the open faced were great! They also removed the bowls from the menu. In place of those were sandwiches. Anyone I knew that got a sandwich there (including myself) thought it was nothing special and actually not that great.  So they went from having two solid, unique base menu items, to having two generic lower quality items. I'm not surprised to see this location having closed. I only kept going there for the boba teas. They remained excellent and untouched with the menu change. Anyone I knew that used to go there for food stopped after the menu change. Hopefully they reopen somewhere else in Wicker/Bucktown with the old menu.",0.9698,0.809,0.15,0.041,0.5748447204968944
2015-12-09,3.0,"I think drinks here can either be a hit or miss. I usually stick to the taro milk tea. Sometimes it's so watered down it doesn't taste like anything, or it's super sweet, and other times it's just right. The more I drink it the more I feel like it doesn't taste like the type of taro you would get in a more Asian-bubble tea place (the menu here is catered to a more American audience). It's just... A certain type of sweet I can't describe. Which I generally like. They also have a taro+white chocolate or taro+coconut option. I like the latter because the coconut flavor is subtle, whereas the white chocolate is over powering and sickeningly sweet.  The smoothies can be okay. The avocado was disappointing as it was so icy (avocado smoothies are usually creamier) and barely tasted like avocado. The coconut wasn't bad though.  I remember trying the ""Pinkerton"" once and absolutely hated it. Would not recommend. I don't think their baos are the best in Chicago but they're decent enough for a light snack with your bubble tea.  At the very least, I've never had a problem with the boba here. The honey tapioca is always super chewy, soft, and slightly sweet, just the way I like it!",0.8947,0.775,0.128,0.097,0.45477873977873967

They have sandwiches that come with chips (sea salt, BBQ, sour cream), ban baos, milk tea, acai bowls, and froyo from Forever yogurt! I've also noticed Forever yogurt has stepped up their froyo game because I used to hate it!! I remember their yogurt being all icy and sour. Now it's all natural and creamy (according to the froyo cup).  This place is very cute and tiny. Not good for groups.  My BBQ Chips were a little too flavorful (reminds me of eating takis chips) and my sandwich (tuna/crab salad sandwich) was too oniony tasting.

They get 5 pts for having nice, QQ (bouncy and not hard or lifeless) bubbles on the day I went, but this doesn't make up for the other aspects of the food. The non-fruit milk tea flavors tasted uncomfortably artificial, even worse than the worst bubble tea in Ann Arbor, so if forced to come here again, I think I'd just stick with matcha or original flavor. The buns are really bad, even worse than the frozen ones you buy at asian grocery stores. The texture is comparable to grocery store brands, but the filling is somehow much more tasteless, and we tried all of the flavors except for one. So unfortunate. The only flavor all of us thought was half-acceptable was miso beef, and the rest were just not good.

HOWEVER.  I ADORE the milk tea!  SO MUCH!  And mostly because of why everyone else is complaining.  Namely, it isn't super sugar-ladden like basically every other place I've tried.  Believe it or not, there are people that exist who don't want to drink half a cup of sugar with their iced milk tea.  Not to mention most places won't even MAKE a milk tea or similar while iced coffees seem to litter the landscape. This place hit all the right buttons for me in that you don't feel like you're drinking straight syrup.  I've had the Chai and the Queen Bee and both were great.  To the point that I absolutely want to go back!  A complete first for me for a milk tea place!  And while I was a little disappointed with the flavor of the bobba, but Bee & Tee's was wonderfully chewy and perfectly sized. I'm in it for the tea, not the bobba in the end.

We had the pork, beef, and chicken buns. At first we weren't sure which was which because previously they were labeled with stickers. It wasn't until we sat down and then asked the cashier that we understood what was in each. None of them were too exemplary and they weren't that hot when we got them.

The drink itself was very liquidy and I was expecting more of a smoothie or something thicker. So I guess the texture was just off for me, but the flavor was definitely there and they didn't add too much chocolate which I'm happy about. I felt like the price of $4 for the regular isn't cheap but I guess it's competitive with the area. I also felt like there were way too many of the tapioca balls or bobas as they call them here. My one friend asked for a smaller amount of them and she felt like she had too many. I didn't ask for a smaller amount and I also felt like they give you an overwhelming amount that kind of takes away from the actual tea/drink.

There were a few nice wooden tables as well as these funky benches here just for grabbing your food and sitting which I thought was kind of cool.

I walked over the first time because it's conveniently located based on where I live, but I have also found easy street parking here. I ordered the #1 special, which includes three bao and a bubble tea smoothie. It's actually a really great deal and I recommend that if you want to save a little money and sample everything. It made for a great-sized dinner at a pretty reasonable price. At first, I was surprised and a little disappointed that the bao were open-faced, not actual buns like I've had before. But maybe I'm just not well-informed on all the different kinds of bao you can have. My favorite bao was definitely the BBQ pulled pork. It had a really great taste; lots of flavors going on. Even if I prefer the bao that are closed like a little sac, these still tasted good.  The mango bubble tea smoothie had perfectly formed tapioca pearls, so I was really impressed by that. I've had a lot of bad bubble tea pearls in my day and Bee & Tea totally nailed it! However, I did notice that the smoothie was a little bit icy and seemed to be slightly more ice than it was mango. Maybe this was an off day for them or maybe they were running low on mango because it was toward the end of the day? I would like to be able to give this another shot at some point. I also really liked the aesthetic. It's very well put-together in its branding. The website, which I checked out before coming here, is also really cool and equally well-put-together with great graphics. Just my $0.02.

2015-04-16,3.0,"I wanted to love Bee & Tea, but I left feeling a bit unsatisfied. It's funny because the only reason this place is on my radar (apart from living in Wicker Park) is because Bee & Tea started following me on Instagram several months ago. I finally decided to give this place a whirl yesterday on a warm day. I decided to order a milk bubble tea because I'd never tried one before (I'd only ever had bubble tea with smoothies). After some deciding, I got the chai five with black milk tea, almond milk, and cinnamon. I also paid an extra fifty cents for red bean because that sounded interesting.  My drink was good, but not entirely what I was expecting. It tasted exactly like brewed black tea with milk poured in with ice and red bean. This is not necessarily a bad thing; I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting. Well. There is one thing that was pretty disappointing for me: there were no boba pearls! It's called ""bubble tea"" on the menu, so I assumed that they came with every drink. That's what distinguishes it as BUBBLE TEA and not just tea. They're really trying to milk (ha) you for your money here by charging extra for the signature ingredient that defines the product in the first place. It's sort of like ordering a menu item called ""fries and ketchup"" that doesn't actually come with ketchup unless you pay additionally.  The decor here is pretty cool with the honeycomb theme, although still simple and clean. Something I loved about it is there's a nook of board games! I would enjoy spending a rainy afternoon here enjoying a hot milk tea (with those tapioca pearls, of course) while playing board games. There was also a big group of rowdy high school kids there running around amok, taking pictures, climbing on a table (!), taking snapchat videos, etc. This was pretty disruptive and I'm mystified why one of the staff there didn't ask them nicely to settle down. I halfway wondered if one of the younger employees there might actually know these kids.",0.9937,0.771,0.172,0.057,0.5108508674787746

I got a warm taiwanese black milk tea with normal sweetness level and tapioca. The boba itself was pretty mediocre. It wasn't as sweet as I expected.

2015-01-19,2.0,"I came in here the other night because people had compared this boba place to my favorite boba place in California (Tpumps). Man, this was pathetic. A little background info, I used to work in a boba place that was part of a chain (Quickly) in California, so IMHO, I think I have a general idea of what boba should taste like, what the flavoring and tea should taste like, etc. because I used to make it on a daily basis! Yes, I can see how the customization of drinks is similar to Tpumps, but the quality of the tea, the options of flavors, and the boba itself was pathetic. The boba tasted old and chewy kind of like eating stale gummy bears. Boba should be sweet enough to have its own taste in the drink, but not overpowering and it should not be hard when chewed. I think the boba was either sitting out for way too long (a probability due to it being the evening and they most likely weren't making new boba that late) or it was cooked wrong. Another thing that rubbed me the wrong way about this place was the girl working at the counter seemed apathetic and didn't really care about my questions or what I was ordering. I ordered two drinks, one for me and one for my boyfriend who was waiting in the car, and she got confused. TWO drinks. Your one job is to take orders for drinks and I even said after the first drink, ""And for the next drink, I would like..."". She ended up mixing up the two drinks and combining them into one, if that makes any sense. I also asked her if she thought almond would go well with the Jasmine green milk tea. I know generally people like almond with black milk tea, but I didn't want that much caffeine. She didn't really know what to answer and seemed confused again. She said ""oh yeah I guess people order that but I don't really know."" Okay...thanks for your input. I ended up ordering it, and, maybe this is my mistake, but I didn't like it much. I think the almond definitely goes better with black milk tea than Jasmine, just because of the floral flavors of the Jasmine tea. She also didn't ask what size I wanted, which seemed like a stupid move on her part, because I definitely would have wanted the bigger size, meaning more money for Bee & Tea, but because she had assumed I wanted the smaller size, I didn't correct her for fear of her getting confused again. I might sound like an elitist jerk while writing this, but Bee & Tea lacks a lot of fundamentals when it comes to good customer service and offering good boba drinks. There aren't many other options when it comes to boba, so I mean I guess you gotta work with what ya got, but I wouldn't actively spend my money here.",0.1136,0.806,0.1,0.094,0.5299752331002331

2014-12-31,1.0,"I am not impressed. Was walking along North Ave and spotted this new boba place. This was when it first opened. The So Cal Asian in me could not resist since it is hard to find a good boba place in Chicago. I was puzzled by all the extra flavors you can add (up to 3!) and opted for no flavors and just a straight up black milk tea with boba. It was the worst boba tea I've ever had! Very diluted and tasted overly milky. The tapioca balls were okay -- standard no frills (and mostly definitely not the ""honey"" boba I'm used to). I got a large and at the time it was $4.50+. I actually ended up throwing most of it away (was trying to drink it for the boba but I couldn't handle the bland lackluster milky water I was drinking).  I wanted to like this place so bad. So bad that when I saw that there was a groupon for it, I jumped at another chance. I told myself that maybe I just wasn't used to their customization style. Maybe I just needed to add more fluff to my tea. Boy was I wrong. So I went back yesterday with my boyfriend. We ordered amongst the both of us -- green milk tea with boba and a black milk tea with coffee (I just can't see myself adding fruity flavoring to traditional milk tea!!) The milk tea was just as bad as I remember. Maybe worse this time since it tasted very artificially milky (like what is this milk aftertaste I have on my tongue?) The coffee made the tea not bland but not enough to save it from being gross :'(. So sad!  we also got baos: the chorizo beef, butter chicken, cold crab (new!), s'mores, pulled pork, and two more I really can't remember!  They were pretty bad. All the green onions looked poorly prepared (too much of it and cut too large). The chorizo and pulled pork was so oily it was dripping through the bao and we ate it right away too. My boyfriend asked me if I had a favorite... And I really didn't. Everything was just below average. I also had their green tea Mochi ice cream (told they were getting pulled from the menu due to them not selling well). I can CERTAINLY see why. It was almost inedible -- the Mochi was flaky and disgusting (expired?) I don't like to waste food but I just couldn't keep it down so instead I peeled away the Mochi exterior and tried my best to eat the ice cream portion (which was edible but nothing special).  Don't get my wrong. I really really wanted to like this place (so desperately that I gave it a second chance). The decor is cute and I like the fact that it attracts people to linger/ hang out. There are a few board games and free wifi. It really is a cute place and all the staff seem super friendly.  I can safely say that I will never be coming back. If you aren't sure what is good boba or good 'bao' feel free to try this place! It's very cute and you might have fun making yourself a lovely frankensteined drink but if you've had good authentic stuff don't waste your time.

The nitty: Three bases (black, green, or taro milk tea, $2.95-$4.95), three levels of sweetness, twenty-four flavors--from the familiar almond and coconut to the more esoteric peppermint and ""heat""--and fifteen toppings, including ""popping boba"" and jelly. Those with chronic bouts of decidophobia, proceed at your own risk.  The same goes for yogurt smoothies ($4.95) twelve flavors and fifteen toppings.

The cashier was moderately enthused, but her fellow workmate seemed a bit put out by the idea of making the food. Also, the design of the space is a bit wonky.

If you've ever know what good, or even moderate/mediocre boba tea tastes like, then it's best if you avoid this place to save your money and peace of mind. I ordered a flavored green tea, I think strawberry and peach or lychee, with two baos that I share with a friend. The baos were mediocre to say the best but definitely more worth it/flavorful than the tea. My tea came out SO BLAND I thought I was drinking colored water. They messed up my order and didn't give me the right add-on. The cup had a crack so I kept wiping away and couldn't figure out why it was still broken. When I brought it back they suggested to give me another cup to place under the broken one.. what? So my friend and I suggested that they just unlid the first broken cup and seal a second, new cup. This went on for a few times over, and finally after much back and forth I got my pink water in a cup ready to go. After a few more sips I figured it wasn't worth the extra calories and dumped the whole thing in a near by trashcan. Probably my most disappointed cup of tea ever. Though all food things were mediocre to tasteless here, there was a few pros. I think they had outlets for us to plug our dying phones into. Service was nice, the girl who had to fix my cup seemed a little frustrated that it was happening but still remained very nice/friendly towards me.

The Baos were mediocre, I expected better. Baos weren't moist enough, they were a bit dry on the inside and sticky on the outside. The pulled pork was tender but a bit salty. Terriyaki Chicken was on point, delicious. The Taro Milk Tea was 32oz, HUGE well worth if for $5; I don't think I've had a bigger Milk Tea before. Tapioca was chewy and on point, Milk Tea wasn't too sweet but had a different Taro taste from all other taro milk tea's I've tried; a good different taste though.  Pricing  Reasonable pricing, Baos are cheaper than most places $2/1 Bao and $5 for 3. The 32oz Milk Tea for $5 is well worth it.  The Decor  Great decor, very colorful, plenty of seating, and an abundant amount of visuals around the restaurant to keep you occupied when waiting for food and eating.

The milk tea was bland and the agar bears were generally too big for the straws. I had 20 of them sitting at the bottom of the cup after I cleared it of milk tea.

I'm fairly impressed by their willingness to change, and the rapid transition of systems. I'm a fan, and I'm excited to watch the ongoing progress and transformation of this store!* I am admittedly a bit of a boba snob, but straight up, I am not trying to sound pretentious here. My primary beef with Bee and Tea is this: the boba ordering system is designed to have purchasers create their orders on a pen and paper checklist. I tried Bee and Tea for the first time a few nights ago and was SUPER excited about bubble tea in Wicker Park. I was ready to order a black milk tea with boba. To my dismay, the ordering system was a bit chaotic. There were 10 people in front of me, scurrying to grab order forms and passing around pencils to check off their desired items. When I got to the counter, all I wanted was a classic bubble milk tea, but the cashier ran over to grab a paper order form, and went through all the boxes with me. It took an extra 5 minutes to order a Plain Jane milk tea. Now... aside from not really having the time to go through a tedious checklist to get my classic black milk tea, I have a number of issues with this system that go much deeper. 1) It creates an unnecessary paper trail. In an age when books are electronic, mail is electronic, banking is electronic, and loving Earth is in, why the heck would they think a pen and paper system makes them look good? It's archaic and outdated. Welcome to 2014. 2) It makes the bubble tea shop look as if it lacks true knowledge of the bubble tea world. In Taiwan, I barely have to utter three words and they know what I want. Or when I do have a long and complicated request, they can handle it--because they know their boba. 3) The whole free hippie mix-matching of flavors is something I'm not sure I want to support. The checklist almost encourages people to mix ""up to three flavors."" What ever happened to purist boba lovers who know what they want and stick to it? Why on Earth would I want to mix almond, guava, and caramel? It's just not right. I think this bubble tea shop has potential, and it's why I'm not giving up quite yet. They just need to train their staff so that these checklists aren't necessary. And if they are, put it in the computer. Don't waste my paper or my time.",0.9951,0.815,0.154,0.031,0.5470436507936507

In the future I think it would be wise to switch to a different kind of ice.",0.92,0.862,0.118,0.02,0.4908585858585859

I happened to drive by looking for a Starbucks to grab a quick iced tea, but saw this place in the corner of my eye and just had to check it out. I ended up ordering lunch too while I was here. Staff was very knowledgeable and gave me the rundown of what a 'bao' and 'quinoa bowl' were. My daughter loves the mango smoothie with tapioca balls and I had a milk tea. Both excellent. When I am back in the area I will return!",0.9461,0.839,0.161,0.0,0.6333333333333333
2014-07-30,4.0,"There's a new pearl milk tea (boba, tapioca, bubble tea) place in town and I am ecstatic! I stopped by today for a taste and to see how good the tea is and I'm happy to say that Bee & Tea has at least met my expectations.  As usual my test was with the almond milk tea which turned out to be a good choice. It had the nuttiness that I was looking for plus the rich flavor of black milk tea. I also got the light sugar and that was at a good level of sweetness. I would recommend trying a regular first if you like the tea a bit sweet and adjust up or down from there. The strawberry milk tea is excellent too. You get that hint of strawberry along with the authentic black tea. It's a good combination for those that like fruity milk teas.   As for the food - I had their Beef chorizo and the salt & pepper tofu baos. I don't think I'd get the salt & pepper again. It was nothing too bad but it seemed to lack substance of sorts. The beef chorizo had a few shining moments of making me think of authentic Taiwanese baos - still, there was something missing in terms of overall taste. Maybe the meat wasn't juicy enough.  I'd also recommend making a pork belly bao because I'm sure that could be a best seller.   The one real negative I have is that I'm not a fan of their hip-hop/rap music selection It's also played way too loudly and I couldn't even block it out with my own headphones that I was blasting!   Free Wifi a plus and the ladies working here are super sweet and nice.",0.9921,0.748,0.205,0.047,0.5664418073508983
2014-07-30,5.0,"Amazing beef chorizo it's spicy and it has onions cilandro and pineapple. Good in bao or rice bowl. The jobs tea drinks are even better you can pick three flavors and I like pineapple, coconut and banana.",0.9022,0.726,0.274,0.0,0.6666666666666666

2014-07-28,4.0,"I've been excited about Bee & Tea's opening since I saw the signs that a boba shop was opening in Wicker Park a few months ago.  They opened this past Thursday, July 24, 2014 and it looks like they had a steady stream of business when I dined there yesterday. I enjoyed my visit there.  The place has a decent sized dining area with a modern style theme for its furniture that goes along with the theme/style they are pushing for with their interior decorations/colors. The boba was inexpensive for 24 oz. ($3.95) and the rice bowls was very reasonable at $5.99 with a good serving size.  The boba was good (I got the coconut with black milk tea with honey boba) and the food was good (I got the chicken teriyaki). Customer service was excellent, though I wonder if they needed as many people as they did at that particular time we went (They had about 4-5 people just sitting around around 12:45 PM CST on a Sunday after we had ordered). The ordering process was unique (not too intuitive either) and I wonder how effective it'll be when the place gets really busy since I'm sure there will be at least a few questions.  Basically, when you get there, on the wall are instructions on how to order.  You fill out a piece of paper with your name, the tea you wanted (there are  5 options in which as someone who drinks a lot of boba, I had no idea which tea was the 'normal' kind), whether the flavor should be 'light,' 'normal,' or 'very sweet,' and then you choose among a bunch of flavors.  You then choose what kind of boba you want and then you have the option of getting dessert (few selections) and food (bao or bowl).  After you fill out the piece of paper, you go to the register and give them the paper and pay.  Turnaround is very quick (we ordered, sat down and within 1 minute the boba was ready). Overall, great experience and would definitely go back again!",0.9831,0.892,0.098,0.01,0.5567460317460318
2014-07-22,5.0,"Ever since Forever Yogurt announced that they would be developing a new franchise concept called Bee & Tea, we were super excited. If someone were to ask me what would be a perfect combo shop for us, I don't think they could have come up with anything more suitable than bubble tea and bao buns. We've been following the Bee & Tea van on Twitter as it's been popping up all around town, but we just hadn't yet been able to catch them to get some of that sweet honey bubble tea. Luckily, we got invited to the launch party at the soon-to-be-open Wicker Park location.  The bubble tea was as delicious as I thought it would be - I particularly liked the chai almond and the strawberry green tea. But the real star of the shop is the bao. I have only been used to the frozen fast food barely palatable buns found at other bao shops (*cough*Wow Bao*cough*), but this was an entirely different experience. Dare I say ""game changer""? The buns are served in an open-faced taco format, where the fresh ingredients are folded in for a yummy 3 or 4 bite treat. The varieties and flavors they offer seem to still be in the menu testing phase, but the Mediterranean chicken and the lemongrass tofu (I think?) were both excellent. I only wish I could have tried more, but with a little FroyoKid buzzing around, it was hard to have a hand free. Very excited to see how this location develops and to see more pop up around town!",0.9964,0.78,0.215,0.005,0.6474584555229718
2014-07-11,5.0,"We walked by and it appeared they were doing a special event in the store but the truck was outside giving out samples. I have never had bubble tea before, it was good!! We tried the traditional bobas and the mango jellies. I liked the mango a lot! It's pretty cool you pick your tea, then add flavoring, then pick the thing you want inside (like bobas or jellies) we went with black tea with strawberry and pineapple flavoring and mango jellies! Yum! Oh you get to select the level of sweetness too! Very cool! It was great! Will definitely be back:)",0.9904,0.691,0.309,0.0,0.6208134920634921
