2016-09-19,4.0,Came here for breakfast on a random weekend and I loved their breakfast sandwich with greens. Great way to start off the day with something not too filling and it was healthy too. Glad I got my vegetables for the day. Servers were super friendly. Just kept asking if we needed anything and they kept our water glasses filled. Very reasonable prices too. And they keep coffee and water outside if you are waiting to be seated. These guys really know how to take care of their customers. Plenty of free street parking available all around.,0.9805,0.757,0.243,0.0,0.6035897435897437

I'm SO FORTUNATE to have stumbled upon this little hipster restaurant. Everything on the menu looked really good and very simply done. It was classic hipster, farm to table type of dining. I adored it and loved the patio so much.  Menu:  Croque Madame for the boy  Smoked salmon for the lady (me)  Avocado toast to share He LOVED his croque. It was laced with a ton of mustard seed and he really enjoyed how savory and yet that tart mustard seed brought out so much of that salty flavor of the meat, cheese and egg.  I LOVED my smoked salmon. It was well salted and seasoned and definitely good with all of the other ingredients such as the beet and carrots and avocado.  Avocado toast was interesting and not so much worth the try, but I love avocado and you can't go wrong. It had a kind of Asian twist to it almost with the nuts and the semi sauce that came with it.

We got the croque madame and the lox BLT and both were fabulous. They make a BEAUTIFUL egg and the greens were fresh and crisp. The bread was a bit tough, but despite the inconvenience (ya'll need sharper knives!) the flavors all paired with each other perfectly. Both my roommate and parents enjoyed their food immensely.

It's just a normal back yard, but they have just perfectly outfitted it as a discreet and comfortable dining space. Service is friendly and they actually know their customers.  The food is, simply, perfectly executed. A kind of combination between comfort food (and Southern-oriented regional American cuisine) with farm-to-table, ingredient-centric cooking, with vegetables taking the center stage as often as meat.  Lightly grilled peaches with corn, green beans, mozzarella and bacon was the perfect back yard summer dish. Crab cakes, sumptuously creamy and mild and lying atop spicy jicama salad, were excellent. A chicken dinner was if anything oversized, two expertly cut portions of chicken with a deliciously tender blackened skin.

2015-07-10,5.0,Birchwood Kitchen keeps me coming back every summer visit to Chicago. Definitely a must try for brunch. Be prepared to wait though. The food here is fresh and always subtly complex with flavorful ingredients. Best way to describe it is gourmet comfort food.  This week we went for lunch. The brie prosciutto was satisfying and the pork loin was incredible. Try sitting in their fairy like garden if weather permits.,0.9524,0.764,0.236,0.0,0.5142857142857143

It might be just me because I always make low sodium pot roasts at home. My wife had their ham and Gruyere cheese sandwich. She thought hers was too salty as well. I can confirm this because I intended on stealing her food. I snatched her sandwich when she went to the bathroom.  The first bite reminded me of my first time in the ocean. I might just have a very low tolerance to salt. Other people would probably enjoy it. I don't know.,0.877,0.761,0.159,0.08,0.5164814814814815
2015-06-21,1.0,"Worst service I have ever received in my life.  Let me preface this review by saying Birchwood is usually an awesome spot, with really great food and service. Well, not this time. We just went to brunch and were seated within 15 minutes, not too bad. My fiancé ordered a chai latte and i ordered a coffee to start things off. Her chai came about 15 minutes later, and my coffee about 30 minutes after I ordered (which by the way was only because i called the waitress over to ask about it, she would have never brought it otherwise). I was then brought the quiche that I ordered, which was at least half the size of the quiche on the table next to me. When I questioned the portion, she gave me an attitude telling me that ""thats what a quiche is, its a slice of the pie."" I believe they were running low and really scrimped on the portions, but I should not be paying for a full portion then. Our waitress also never once checked on us. That coffee that took 30 minutes to receive? It was never refilled. Not even questioned. And we had waited about 15 minutes in between our plates clearing and receiving the check. Well, we again had to grab her attention, she was just walking by us completely ignoring our table. Maybe she was too busy washing off the kid's booster seat of the table down from us to handle our check. Yes, she washed off the booster seat in the back kitchen and brought it back out to give back to the parents. But asking for our money by handing us a check? Not important in the least.  All in all, hands down the worst service I have ever experienced. It is a shame because I usually enjoy this place.

What we ordered: - croque madame: this seems to be what everyone came here for so we had to try. It was flavorful and good, but the mustard seeds were a little overwhelming for me so it wasn't my favorite. The spinach vinaigrette salad that comes with it is fresh and a good pairing though. - breakfast sandwich with bacon: this was more of a burger sandwich, and the bread was soft albeit a bit greasy. Overall, full of protein and a good choice for someone with a hearty appetite. This comes with the spinach vinaigrette salad as well. - soup of the day (garlicky potato): TBH, I was excited to try their tomato soup but unfortunately that wasn't a choice that day. The garlicky potato soup was okay, but just didn't have all the flavor I was looking for in a soup.

The pictures of food looked awesome, the restaurant looked really nice and it was a short walk from where I was staying.    Upon arrival the hostess, who was very friendly, just seemed flustered and overwhelmed.  You could see they had everything outside to self serve coffee to people waiting for tables, everything but the coffee?  They'd been open for 30 minutes already.   We waited about 10 minutes and got a table in the back yard.  It was nice, I really enjoyed being outside on a nice day.  Our table was very wobbly, not a big deal, I put my folded up napkin under it.   About this time when the inconsistent service began. First, we got served out coffee, finally.  It was brought over and  we were told milk, sugar etc was on its way.  After waiting 5 minutes I had to ask for it, twice.  When the sugar/milk came we noticed no stirrers or spoons.   So, I stirred with my knife.  A few minutes later stirrers showed up, literally minutes.  My wife said someone probably heard me say ""c'mon, where are the stirrers?"".  We ordered, I got the breakfast sandwich with a side of potatoes.   We had a shared table appetizer of the avocado and toast.  It was good.  There were three of us, two of the plates came out.  Trying to be polite we waited for the third.  Again, about five minutes.  Once it arrived we began eating. I noticed my potatoes were a little under seasoned.  Eventually our waiter (who also was very nice) asked if we wanted salt, pepper, hot sauce.  I said yes, it all came out pretty quickly.  My breakfast sandwich , with bacon, was tasty.   I didn't let the hair on the bacon ruin my meal.  It happens, it's not the end of the world.    Everyone else enjoyed their meals very much.  Maybe it was an off day.  The hostess said they were on a re run of ""Check Please"" the night before and the morning was very  busy.   Would I eat there again?  Maybe, but there are a lot more really good places to try first before going back.  With great service this was 4 stars all day, but with mediocre service (with a smile), it's three.",0.9936,0.834,0.143,0.024,0.5180180180180181

Been hiding a lot in my favorite spot, been aggressive to other cats, but fortunately managed to keep my scant eliminations inside the litter box, to my partner's great appreciation. Returning appetite brought me back to my true calling: battling on the front lines of the eternal war between breakfast and lunch. (Aside: Ranks of french toast dripping with maple syrup are swept aside by a charging wedge of crispy BLT sandwiches ... my fur bristles with the memories of that day ... )  As always, unable to come to a mutually agreeable decision, my partner and I decided to see if Birchwood kitchen could perch in that tiny precious space and deliver a meal that would satisfy us both ... at 9 am. Arriving so early, we were seated immediately, although a presence of a coffee dispenser outside suggested that 11 am brunchers would not be as lucky. The menu is short, but teeming with choices: I ordered the truffled polenta, and my bruncher in arms ordered the croque vert. We also got coffee, of course, and an oatmeal butterscotch cookie to fill in the crannies. The food was excellent: the polenta with crispy pancetta was ineffably breakfasty, like grits , but lunchy due to the tasty addition of artichokes and gruyere cheese, and the mushroomy flavor permeating throughout. The croque vert came with a side of green salad and had roasted red peppers inside. An adult version of a ham and cheese sandwich with two eggs on top that gives hope that the end to bitter conflict is in sight.

A little bit later she brought us out warm Fritter Cakes (berry compote, lemon cream cheese) for us to try ....AND they were so melt in mouth delicious!

The seasonal menu certainly adds a level of uncertainty whenever they come back after a winter hiatus, but the owner and chefs know what tastes good. I think I was technically addicted to the goat cheese sandwich for about six months. The decor is beautiful and natural light is great. It used to be a good place to go and work, but as they get busy, the need to turn over tables increases and it's harder to have a relaxing lunch with a book. It's great for brunch if you can get in, but it's best for a delicious lunch with a friend or loved one. I forget that they're closed on Mondays, so I usually show up looking for a goat cheese sandwich and have to leave disappointed. The staff is great and always friendly.

2015-03-12,2.0,"It so pains me to write this review because as a Bucktown resident, I have been a long-time customer.  We went in for Sunday brunch since the baby was at grandma's house, and we could actually stand to wait for a table without our antsy toddler.  After being quoted a 25-minute wait, we were seated 45 minutes later.  Fine - it happens.  You can't help that the hipsters at the tables around us linger for 30 minutes-plus after paying their bills, despite seeing other people waiting.  However, after being seated, I had to ask for water after more than 5 minutes of waiting.  I also made the mistake of trying one of the newer items recommended by the server - Miso root vegetables on polenta.  Sounds great in theory, but what came out tasted like hospital food.  It was a very sad plate and lacked flavor.  After waiting for a table that long, I expected much, much more. Sourcing ingredients locally and make everything from scratch is great, but that does not excuse you from making food that tastes good.  Bottom line - the food has to be tasty.  Unfortunately, Birchwood has been failing on that front lately - not just with this brunch experience but also takeout orders I have had recently.  After being a patron for 4 years, I think I am done, unfortunately.  The food is just not worth the hassle and is not something I just have to have.  It's just meh.",-0.6482,0.828,0.072,0.101,0.46710526315789475

Tried two remedies for the relative lack of ham in the sandwich: pork sausage which was juicy and delicious, and bacon, which was limp and covered in grease.

I had popped in one time before and walked out because their menu at that time didn't have anything I could eat (oh the life of a vegetarian with a nut allergy). I checked the menu before heading over with two pals this past Friday and found two items that appeared to be options for me. We showed up at 9am and we didn't end up leaving for almost 70 minutes - that was rather disconcerting for me for a weekday breakfast. I would have given one star, but the atmosphere of the restaurant gets a star - a cool place.  One pal ordered the veggie scramble and the other pal ordered the breakfast sandwich. I also ordered the veggie scramble, made sure to ask about the eggs and informed the waitress that I didn't want them included. My pals received their plates and I was then told that they made mine with eggs and were remaking it...ok, cool, but kinda a bummer since I was just as starved as my pals. The one pal had ordered a side order of hash browns, which were actually small reds that were halved. Should really just be called roasted potatoes.  My scramble then showed up, which for something that states are seasonal vegetables should include more than just mushrooms, especially when you're leaving out the eggs. There was a dollop of goat cheese on it. But wait, there were little chunks of egg in the scramble too. Back the scramble went. The waitress then returned to ask if other vegetables would be ok to add, and maybe chickpeas or lentils. I was like, ""Yes, of course! As long as there as there are no nuts, that all sounds great!"" So now I'm expecting a hearty scramble, better be worth my time of having my pals stare at me while I eat, since they were already done. There was some chard added to the mushrooms and some sweet potatoes. Nothing else. And no more goat cheese. What a letdown - where were the beans?! I just wanted to get more coffee at that point and just leave so decided not to say anything else. They ended up not charging me for it, but really? Seems like in this kind of hipster area, having an option that can be easily modified to be vegan or have another protein option than the egg would make a lot of sense. If the scramble could have been made with some sort of beans and the same veggies and maybe less oil, it might be something that I would come back for.   As a person with allergies, it is always concerning to me when an establishment is unable to leave ingredients out (ie, the eggs) because that could be happening with allergens, which would be very uncool.  I'm going to stick to going to Handlebar down the street, where vegan and vegetarian food is plentiful.

I ordered the croque vert which basically is a grilled cheese sandwich with gruyere cheese and veggies topped with over easy eggs and a side of tossed greens.  If you love cheese like I do, you'll definitely be a fan of this dish.  The runniness of the eggs added a nice texture to the crunchy, grilled sandwich and the slight tang of the greens complimented the sandwich well.  I am a huge carnivore and it is so rare for me to order a meatless dish.  Let me tell you, this croque vert was so yummy I didn't even mind that it was a vegetarian dish!  I also had a soy latte and it was pretty good.  I believe they use Metropolis beans and they also offer free coffee outside for those waiting for a table.  Pretty neat if I say so myself! Our server was funny, helpful, and incredibly sweet.  We have one friend who is a picky eater and he was being a bit of a diva that day.  He didn't like any of the choices and asked if he could make up his own dish since he only liked bits and pieces of each option.  Thank goodness our server and Birchwood were so accommodating and they brought him what he wanted...which happened to be toast, their in-house smoked salmon, scrambled eggs, and a side of fruit.  Of all things, this is what you order?!  If you're going to be difficult, at least be a little more creative than that, right?? haha Anywho, I thought our server was going to kill us when we asked for separate checks at the end of our meal.  Yikes!  Next time we'll make sure to leave him behind so he doesn't cramp our style!  All in all, I had a great time.  Birchwood has great food, service, and a nice laid back atmosphere.",0.9989,0.673,0.289,0.038,0.6561151811151811

2014-10-01,3.0,"This place was buzzing on yelp with 4.5 stars and 700+ reviews so we designated our last day in Chicago to have brunch here. Luckily, they just finished renovating and reopened. Everything was just so perfectly planned out! I already knew what I wanted after seeing the pictures and reading the reviews. The shrimp and grits looked amazing. However, their menu changed! The shrimp and grits was no longer offered! :(. Such sadness. None of their specials that day seemed appealing to me either. So I went with the croque madame. My friend ordered the croque vert (veggies with corn and brussel sprouts). We wanted to get the sourdough waffles with fresh fruit, but they ran out. It looked amazing when we saw them bringing it out. We were just one order too late! Both the croque madame and vert were pretty good. Both were very cheesy, a bit more to my liking. But the sunny side eggs were cooked perfectly and the bread was toasted just right! The only thing they could have improved on was maybe add a bit more ham in the croque madame to go with all that cheese. We ordered a side of hashbrowns. Don't get it. It was way too greasy with no flavor and the portion was quite small for $2.50.  But their lemonade was delicious! It was infused with basil and lavender yummm! The lavender was just enough to give it a bit of a light floral taste. Prices were very reasonable. Just a little under $10 for each dish. We were seated out in their patio. We were very fortunate with ideal weather (sunny but not too hot and no wind)! But they have a good amount of seating indoors and out. Service was great. Our server and host were very friendly. I do recommend coming a bit earlier, which means the wait might be a bit longer. But since we came near the end of the morning rush (1 pm), foods run out such as their banana bread and their sourdough waffles. Poo. Overall, decent brunch. A-OK = 3 stars.

First of all, there was no wait. On a Saturday at noon. This has go to be pretty much unheard of at brunch places! The restaurant itself has a hipstery, casual, comfortable atmosphere and a beautiful back patio. The hostess who was standing outside gave us a table number, and told us to order at the counter. It only took about 15 minutes for the dishes to come out. I sampled a bit of everything our group ordered, and it was all so delicious (and beautifully presented as well)! My favorites were definitely the breakfast sandwich, the french toast, and the applewood bacon side. I feel weird recommending the bacon as something to order, but omgz, I don't even know what they did to it to make it so delicious. Most menu options were less than $10, which was perfect as we are all poor students.

The staff was very nice and the one waiter was attentive; the beautiful backyard patio alone is worth the trip again.

(We arrived around 11am on a Sunday and had no wait time - there were even a couple empty tables inside.) As soon as I looked at the menu I started salivating like a pavlov's dog in the middle of a christmas handbell choir. The three of us had to get four dishes to split amongst ourselves, and even that was restraining our desired gluttony. I won't go through all the dishes but rest assured, the meat and the vegetarian dishes were all damn good. So was the lemon bar which I took home with me for desert because I couldn't bear the thought of our love being unrequited.  I had lots of friendly playful banter with the guy at the counter. Love funny people with some snark to 'em. I didn't love the patronage as much (there was literally a parade of strollers leaving out the door with a very 'Gap vibe'). But no worries. The food and the service and the atmosphere all made me blind to my prejudices. And they were playing Little Dragon on the house speakers so that also calmed my ruffling feathers.  Beautiful. Tasty.

Maybe it's just one employee who needs a refresher in food handling and food safety, but it was enough to turn me off of the whole place permanently.  It's really too bad, because the food is good (what I could eat of it, knowing how it had been handled).  The vibe is young and lively, and the prices are reasonable.",0.9069,0.876,0.084,0.04,0.42629629629629634

Flavorful without feeling like I was gorging myself on butter and sugar. The arugula really set off the sweetness with a peppery flavor. The chickpea salad was pretty spicy but had a good kick to it. I had read that others really like this side, which was my motivation for choosing it, and I'm glad I did. Very filling but not leaving me feeling sick. Tried their special blueberry basil lemonade and was surprised it came out pink. Blueberry? Pink?

However, I gave it another chance yesterday and was glad my friend and I went at 5:30 PM right when dinner started, as we were able to grab a table before the crowds started rolling in (pretty busy for an early Thursday evening). Although one of the servers misheard my order at the counter and accidentally made me a blueberry basil lemonade, he still gave it to me without charging extra. We were quite hungry when we sat down, but had a feeling our taste buds weren't fooling us with the extremely decadent ricotta, peach, and honey crostini appetizer - to DIE for! The flavor kept on going with each bite until the last chew, the only thing to complain about is that they only give you four on the plate. We wanted more, but saved belly room for the turkey burger and salmon plate, both of which we decided were some of the best we've ever had. Everything we had was perfectly seasoned, cooked just right, and a mix of wonderfully complementary flavors.

Came here for a late night dinner (8.45pm - 15mins before closing) not expecting too much beyond a good quality, quick, sandwich (per Yelp reviews). However, upon the recommendation of the kind man behind the counter I ended up ordering the Seared Salmon and Lamb Sausage to go. He was then nice enough to comp a lemonade and some pickled veggies for me while I waited for our order- perhaps it was because they were closing but a really nice touch nonetheless! The salmon was incredibly good. Fresh, delicate, light, flavorful and perfectly cooked/seasoned. I also thoroughly enjoyed side salad it came with; a really well balanced and executed dish. Not a lot of feedback to give on the lamb sausage sandwich unfortunately but she seemed very happy! Came with a fresh fruit salad which closed out the meal on a sweet note.  All in all I was left very satisfied and very impressed- and all for $21.90! 5 Star Gem! Side note: Bring Your Own Beer/Wine! No corkage fee!!!",0.994,0.721,0.244,0.035,0.6642857142857144

I really wanted a great experience at this place because they have an aggregate 4.5 stars from about 700 reviews, which is very impressive. Unfortunately, a stellar star experience was not the case for me. I got the grilled gruyere and my girlfriend got the croque vert. I was super excited for these sandwiches prominently featuring gruyere cheese, BUT HOLY MOTHER OF MUSTARD, the honey mustard literally overpowered the entire sandwich in both of our entrees. Mustard was all I could taste and it overtook all the other flavors. I'm not one to complain about mustard either because I put it on everything. A couple other yelp reviewers seem to have had similar experiences. I wrote a comment in the suggestions box, so hopefully they'll get the message.

The wait was only about 15 minutes, but the downfall was they were out of the French toast that we were all looking forward to. Sad face.  So instead we opted for the waffles (bit disappointing-- my gfs referred to it as the Eggo waffle looking dish covered with chocolate sauce and bananas) but I guess it was alright, very soft and fluffy.  Also ordered the breakfast sandwich with goat cheese, bacon and eggs, with a side of red potatoes and petit salad. The sandwich was pretty good, but then again I love anything with goat cheese and eggs.  The biscuits and gravy prob was my favorite of the dishes we ordered--- opted for the pork sausage too, which complemented the rest of the dish. We got the oatmeal butterscotch cookie too (which really was a meh, nothing outstanding) and the berry cobbler--- probably the best of everything we ordered. Water is self-serve in the back, and you order and pay for food at the register.

The soup was excellent, the burger was better than most of the gastropub burger joints that seemed to have popped up.  Even the salad, while not a stretch gastronomically, was fresh, properly dressed, and well garnished that gave it a little extra pop.

2014-05-20,2.0,"I went to Birchwood Kitchen with a group and absolutely no expectations, and not only was I underwhelmed, I was distinctly disappointed. We came for a late Sunday lunch, so we were past the brunch rush, but even so, their weird and unintuitive ordering system took far too long. My dad and I were standing in the ordering line - with only about 4-5 people in front of us - for so long that we commented wonderingly about it to each other. At first I just thought the person currently at the register had a long and complicated order, or was having some other issue that was causing a delay. Nope. As we got closer, I observed that the reason for the incredibly slow line was that the dazed-looking cashier was chatting with each and every customer. Completely unnecessary and inefficient, especially given the annoying, special-snowflake ordering system.  As for the food, I'm a bit torn. My uncle-in-law's build-your-own sandwich looked amazing, and is the sole reason for the second star I'm giving this place. My iced tea was so weak and bland it was basically water. I ordered the shrimp and grits, which is one of my all-time favorite dishes, as well as being a classic brunch staple - no need to mess with success, right? Wrong. The shrimp were in a tasty pesto-hybrid sauce that I enjoyed, but the rest of the dish was disappointing - both the grilled asparagus and the grits themselves were unseasoned and bland. I chose to forego the poached egg that comes on top of the dish, and I'm glad I did - several of my party ordered the croque monsieur, and the fried eggs that topped the sandwich looked severely undercooked in every case.  Bottom line: an inefficiently-run establishment with unsatisfying food. I will not be back.",-0.544,0.779,0.102,0.119,0.5921679197994988

They assigned us a number and a table, and then we ordered at the counter (they bring the food out to you). We decided to go with their weekend specials- the shrimp and grits (10) and the baked french toast (8). I also ordered a mocha (4). They don't charge extra for soy, which is great for the lactose intolerant! You pick up your coffee at the end of the counter, where you can also pour your own water and get coffee and tea. The mocha came in a very large mug, and was probably the best mocha I have had, no exaggeration. It wasn't overly sweet, and was the perfect temperature.  The baked french toast with blueberries came out first and it was like eating bread pudding or a really moist cake. Yum! We got three large pieces with lots of fresh blueberries. The shrimp and grits was amazing and we got 6 marinated shrimp, grilled asparagus, grits with pesto and a poached egg. That dish did not last long at all since we scarfed it down so fast.

After waiting over forty minutes we were asked to wait outside. I found that odd as I didn't see anybody else asked that. After waiting outside for 20 minutes and noticing that we were the only people waiting outside while everyone else, even those that came after us, were waiting inside, we went back inside. I spoke with the host, about the wait as it was over an hour now, nearly 1 hour 15 minutes. I asked why we weren't seated and why a large table that could have accommodated us was split into two smaller tables, for two parties that arrived after us. The host began to get defensive and says to me ""do you want to argue or do you want to sit and eat."" Obviously I want to eat which I tell him, he then proceeds to tell me that he ""can't explain his job to me in thirty seconds."" I'm thinking in my head, you take names and you seat people, tell me more on the complexities of your job. Anyways we eventually were seated, the manager Lana was kind and friendly and very apologetic. The food was good. And honestly I would have probably gone again, however, I found it hard to enjoy the meal after the rude encounter with the host.

2014-04-24,2.0,"Birchwood Kitchen is another tally for the surprising disappointment I've come to expect from the Wicker Park area food scene.  It's a nice place to come by for brunch, on ambience alone, but the food is definitely sub-par. I came in for a late lunch one day, with the intention of order the duck sandwich that sounded deliciously yummy.  However, the menu had changed, and with it no longer available, I had to think on my feet.  I spied a goat cheese and lox sandwich that in retrospect, I should have been more wary of, but at the time, I thought, ""I love goat cheese, and I love lox, what could go wrong?"" FALSE.  The sandwich ended up just being really weird.  First, goat cheese and lox definitely do not go together well.  In addition, the greens were arugula, which just added a weird dimension to this flavor mash.  With something sweet in the mix, the sandwich just ended up being one big epic fail.  I also ordered a grapefruit juice, which was nice and seemed freshly squeezed, but kinda pricey. Also, the set up is very weird.  The experience is fine once you sit down, but an employee greets you at the door when you walk in to direct you to the counter, where you order from the menu, before being seated.  This is despite it being very much a self-seat cafe sort of place. With the entrance being rather small, the extra dude just makes things awkward and takes up space.  The place isn't full service, so the extra manpower at the door to ferry you the three feet to the counter is weird. If you're just looking for a simple bagel or sandwich, and want to do some reading, stop by for the phenomenal floor to ceiling windows.  Otherwise, check out one of the other cafes in the area.",0.9627,0.792,0.127,0.081,0.5652531102531104

Baked French toast tasted similar to a bread pudding without it being too mushy-had a strawberry and light cream sauce over but wasn't too sweet or overpowering.

The ordering is done at the counter but whereas some may not like that it creates a flow of traffic that ensures people get sat and people get their food in a well managed flow.  Pros of that are minimal waiters checking in on you, your foods arrive on time to your table, and quality table time.

Big disappointment!  Nothing but average food.  We also ordered a side of bacon-- they served it undercooked in a pool of bacon grease.  It was barely edible.  The bread on both croques was difficult to cut and lacked the combination of crispy/soft that you would expect from a formidable sandwich. My husband chose to get the honey mustard on the side which was smart because it overpowered the sandwich.  We were hoping our meal would be salvaged by the chocolate chip banana bread and the gooey butter cake but again we were disappointed.

2014-03-13,5.0,"Searching for a restaurant for brunch this past weekend, I stumbled upon Birchwood Kitchen during my yelp search and found that a familiar name had written a review - Kelly S. Now who is Kelly S. you ask? My first, quirky, awesome Yelp CM ever. I instantly knew I had to try this place. Birchwood Kitchen is everything that I want in a brunch place - exposed brick, free and unlimited coffee, a wonderful and friendly waitstaff, an even nicer owner (if that's possible), and delicious, scrumptious food. My friend and I ventured out to this cute establishment for Sunday brunch and loved every minute of it. Sure, you might have to wait a bit for a table on the weekends, but the wait system is super convenient/efficient. Their system takes your phone number, and texts you to let you know when you're in 'line' and when your table is ready, so you're not just hanging out watching everyone eat (what a tease). We perused over the menu and sipped our warm coffee, and then the debates began. Croque vert or the breakfast sandwich? Tuna melt maybe? OMG steak and eggs!! We decided to do a halfzies and share the steak and eggs and the Croque Vert sandwich. The food was delicious! The steak and eggs came with a side of roasted potatoes and a chipotle cream that paired perfectly, and the Croque Vert came with a side salad. I would definitely recommend both. I think what made the experience so great was the service. Judd, the owner, came over numerous times to make sure everything was to our satisfaction. The service was out of this world amazing and I would literally go back just to be friends with these nice people.  Tip: the brunch wait on a Sunday is approximately 40 minutes, so be prepared to wait a bit!",0.998,0.739,0.258,0.003,0.7275720164609054

You have to try their drinks too (they make their own lemonade, ice tea, fruit drinks, etc.).  Lastly, they have this incredible pasta salad that comes as a side with every meal...

Turns out the friend I was meeting comes here all the time, and I just didn't know that. He LOVES the place and says he's never gotten anything bad there. When we went, he ordered the chilaquiles - I was basically drooling over them, they looked so good but unfortunately I don't eat anything with pork. I ordered the Croque Verde - basically a Croque Monsieur with vegetables instead of ham - second translation - an amazing French style grilled cheese with lots of seasonal veggies. It was delish and came with a side salad.  My friend insisted we split one of their bagels as well. I couldn't be happier that we did. I was expecting the bagel quality to be superbly outrageous, which it was, but the real point of trying this is the spread. They mix cream cheese with goat cheese and honey and a touch of awesomeness, and then make it warm I think. It's like bagel crack, I couldn't get enough.  I would definitely go back to this place - friendly staff, awesome décor and delicious food. What more do you need?",0.9896,0.734,0.218,0.048,0.5703703703703703
2014-01-17,5.0,"I have been here twice and must say the awesome service here is what adds an extra touch of amazing-ness! (Yes, I talk with these words I made up and it helps me get my point across). The hostess took our names and started up a discussion with my boyfriend about the origins of his name. She loved his unique name so much she started calling us her ""best friends"". She was funny and kept coming to check up on us during the wait, encouraging us to have samples of the baked goods and coffee. This was so nice to have during the relatively long 30 minute wait since it was cold outside and 10 couples or so had to pack into the tight spaces inside. I love the food here too! I've mostly had breakfast items, which were all freshly made, and full of unique flavors and ingredients. Their menu keeps changing and I can't wait to go back to try some more.  Since I have visited with groups I was able to try quite a bit.  Baked goods: I recommend the gooey butter cake and butterscotch cookies, their coffee is delicious too and goes so well with these treats.  The banana chocolate chip bread is soft and delicious and not too sweet.  Sandwiches: The various grilled cheese sandwiches were delicious (I've tried one with curried cauliflower and gruyere and one with goat cheese), and the breakfast sandwich with cilantro pesto is so so good!  Other items: I also had broccolli cheddar soup, thai curry chicken soup and curried garbanzo beans as sides, all of which were excellent. The soups are true to their flavors without too much salt, and served nice and warm. The garbanzo bean salad is cold, but it is nicely spiced making it a light but flavor-packed side dish.  Overall, lots of vegetarian options, and a fun place to bring anyone - I even saw a group byob with champagne!

My friend and I decided to split the breakfast sandwich (vegetable frittata, cheddar, and bacon on focaccia bread accompanied with a side salad and roasted potatoes) and a tuna melt (Spanish tuna salad, gruyere, and roasted tomatoes on multigrain bread accompanied with a side salad or chips.)  Both sandwiches were delicious, probably because with each ingredient you can taste the freshness.  Even the bread was soft and fluffy. The service here was excellent.  All the employees were genuinely nice and happy.  Even though there was no wait staff, the host went around asking customers how their meal was and if they needed anything else.  Birchwood Kitchen is definitely a great neighborhood brunch spot, so stop by here if you want to enjoy fresh food with great service.",0.983,0.781,0.178,0.041,0.534567901234568

2013-12-25,3.0,"During a recent visit to Chicago we went to Birchwood, given the extreme number of reviews.  With an emphasis on farm to table I had high hopes and the food was tasty but the experience was extremely negative.  I get that you go for the food but the question is whether it was worth the hassle.  In my mind it wasn't.  Reminds me of the series of lines at a Cheesecake factory. First, when you go in you see a line at a counter.  Ok.  No big deal.  After about 10 minutes we were told we weren't eligible to wait in line in the small front room.  We need to put our name on a list for permission to wait in line to order.  While it's chilly outside, you are welcome to a cup of coffee so long as you stand outside.  No chairs of course out there and you are asked not to sit on the steps. I know I go to the gym and do the elliptical for 45 minutes but standing 45 minutes in the cold is rough and this was during the fall.  I can't imagine it in the winter.  Sorry coffee doesn't cut it. When you are given the blessing to finally wait in line you order at a counter your entire meal at once like a fast food restaurant and you'll be assigned a table.  If you want dessert, order it now because you won't get a second chance.  While waiting in line we were ""reseated"" to another part of the restaurant and I have to say it really irked me to have my coat and backpack moved without my permission.  Politeness wasn't on the menu it seemed (or did I forget to order it at one stage)? The meal is served to you but you have to pick up your own drinks.  This wasn't explained to us and we didn't realize it until close to the end.  We also ordered appetizers and entrees but the nature of the service there bring it out all at once.  Again, sorry for thinking appetizers came before the meal, I was using logic. The patrons to the left of us were waiting, expecting table service.  At one point I thought they may not have had things explained and told them to wait at the counter.  They were pretty outraged they had waited so long without sufficient explanation and once they had waited 45 minutes to get in and another 30 minutes at the table they walked out rather than wait at the counter line another 20 minutes.  I felt bad for these people and would have let them share in our appetizer but they walked out.   So after all that experience about the process I'll say the food was tasty.  Vegetarian sandwich with cashew butter was great and would have totally been worth it if I could have walked in and gotten it within a reasonable time .  My dining companion got the grilled cheese that was good, but was a bit cold probably due to the service issues.  The kitchen here and the staff are totally out of sync.  We also got one of the spectacular cookies for dessert. This is great food and I think I'd like this place more if I were a local and knew the rules and the non-busy times to go.  The wait and the rules simply weren't worth it and it's a shame as some better logistics would go a long way to make customers welcome.",0.9808,0.851,0.098,0.052,0.5477142857142857

If I come back, I'll definitely try to sit outside on their patio.  Birchwood's brunch menu is pretty small and menu items change pretty frequently. Sunny went with the breakfast sandwich with bacon which was huge and very tasty. A reason for Birchwood not receiving a 5 star review has to do with the severely underdone bacon on the sandwich, it truly didn't look cooked. Other than that, she definitely enjoyed her meal. I had a dish that isn't on the menu at the moment, but had corn cakes, over easy eggs, black beans, chorizo, avocado, pickled onions, and other delicious items. This dish was unique and flavorful, I just felt that the corn cakes were kind of dry. Besides that, all of the flavors worked together perfectly.

We waited for about 25-30 minutes, which is all I would wait for if I was coming again. The food is good, but not good enough to wait beyond 30 minutes. The restaurant was full with a good mix of young urban professionals and folks from the surrounding neighborhoods. Lots of really nice people we got to interact with while waiting for a table. We ordered the pumpkin pie french toast and croque madame. The french toast was excellent. Lots of creamy sweet potato compote with marshmallows and cashews. The croque had a fried egg on top that really worked well with all the flavors in the sandwich. There's a hit from the dijon mustard that just really makes this sandwich work. The prices were extremely reasonable. Places like the Birchwood are only going to use quality ingredients. The food is extremely fresh.

Good thing it was nice outside because you can't wait inside. I don't even think there would be room if they allowed it. We for the Goat Cheese sandwich and the Steak and Cheese with chips. My Goat Cheese sandwich was just meh. The beets soaked through and made my bread red and soggy - yuck. The goat cheese was good but it completely overpowered all other flavors of the sandwich. I never thought I would EVER say this, but they put to much cheese on it. The BF thought his sandwich was ok but not worth waiting an hour for.

2013-08-19,5.0,"Wow- an accidental stop turned into a beautiful meal. Our taxi driver misheard my directions and we ended up in front of this adorable cafe, and we couldn't resist. Counter service and a 25 minute wait were not going to stop us from tasting whatever smelled so good. We poured some of the rich, dark roasted coffee they comp and took a stroll down the street. When our table was available we ordered the day's quiche, a grilled ham and gruyere sandwich, tomato soup, chilled carrot ginger soup and a pickled veg plate. Everything was perfect. As mentioned in my photo cap, the pickled veg were hands down the best I have ever had. Onions, thin sliced beets, green beans, zucchini and bell pepper with a little dollop of stone ground mustard and some lovely cheese- plus the tastiest toast slices full of nuts and seeds. Wow. I could have stopped there but of course, I ate on. The grilled cheese was half sized but triple stacked and  what a sandwich she was. I opened it up and stuffed the remaining pickled onions inside and that turned out to be an excellent  move. They really elevated horseradish spiked mustard hidden between the bread. My boyfriend had the quiche (ha ha ha ha ha) and it was really good. I know this because I reached over my own meal to fork his. Squash, corn and ham were the mix and the crust was perfectly flaky. Seriously fresh greens are served with the entrees. The soups were great but a bit much with the weight of the sandwich. I needed to save room for lunch. Brunch is really just breakfast.

2013-07-23,5.0,"Uh, this place is the best? I love this place. I've only been for lunch, so I have yet to try some of the more savory dishes that comprise full dinners. Despite that, I've very consistently had great results at lunch and can't recommend this place enough. They do a marvelous job of creating simple side salads for their sandwiches, often adding a few extras that make things terrific - beets, anyone? The sandwiches are inventive and delicious, and it's often worth trying the special.  What keeps me coming back here isn't just that the ""hits"" are great - I could eat the pork roast sandwich over and over and over - but that there's always something else to try and it is almost always terrific. It's hard for me to comprehend what they're doing to keep the quality so high across so many dishes. I'd especially recommend the vegetarian sandwiches as they take particular care with selecting fresh vegetables bursting with flavor. As an example, whenever the cauliflower salad comes back (winter, probably) definitely check it out. It's one of the best examples of how great this place can be, and how confusing it is they are so good, because the ingredients are so simple.  The atmosphere is great. The back patio is nice during the summer/fall, and inside has a bit of hustle and bustle but not intrusively so. You order from the counter, but in the process of waiting the staff assigns you a table, so it meshes nicely between being a sit-down place and more of a deli. The wait can be intense during the weekend brunch hours, so be wary then, but during the week it's usually pretty easy to get the table, even though they're usually busy. They do just a few desserts, but they are worth trying - the gooey butter cake, when available, is a favorite.",0.9976,0.744,0.233,0.023,0.5741097308488613

I think he felt bad we waited in line for nothing so he offered us a free slice of Chocolate Chip Banana Bread. That was very nice of him and it was delicious! We also had some complimentary coffee (available for everyone) which was a pleasant surprise as well! In any case, I think they should have a sign in there telling people how the line/waiting works.

All the more reason to be impressed by the essentially flawless experience I had eating brunch (a meal which, in and of itself, I typically find superfluous and snooty) at Birchwood this morning. Here are some ways in which Birchwood Kitchen shines:  1) Efficiently manages a Saturday brunch throng with minimal wait times by streamlining the seating and ordering process 2) Offers a menu which is both eclectic and not overwhelming 3) Coffee is strong and costs $2 for a bottomless mug. 4) The food is pretty spectacular; gourmet without any fluff. Biscuits and gravy ($10), topped with sausage patties and two sunny side eggs, are rich but soft like clouds, and are accompanied perfectly by the co-op hot sauce. Breakfast sandwich ($7.50), with vegetable frittata, bacon, and cheese on focaccia, is perfectly balanced between bread and filling (which is impressive, considering the fact that it's on focaccia, which usually dominates a sandwich). By far the highlight, however, was the simple baked mozzarella appetizer ($8), with tomato quarters, herbs, and oil. Very warm and satisfying.  5) Pricing is very low, especially for the absurdly high quality of the ingredients that are used.  6) Service is very nice without being intrusive.  7) Beautiful outdoor dining situation.

I visited on a lazy Sunday for brunch, so the chill vibe was totally appreciated. After ordering at the counter, you can grab your own water and a seat near the open kitchen.  2. Your food is beyond amazing. Being a vegetarian, I obviously went for the croque verte. Sure, I was impressed by the lightly toasted bread with perfectly made sunny side up eggs, but what sealed the deal was the cheese. Yes, never would I have imagined that the gruyère cheese would bring everything together and totally make the croque!  3. Your side salad was equally amazing. How could something so simple with a tangy dressing, shaved carrots, and pickled beets make such a complementary side dish!?   Simple yet quality food enjoyed in a chillax ambience.

I got their goat cheese and pickled beets salad and the hubby got the mac and cheese. My salad was great, its a classic combo, and it was done to perfection.

I was limited to sausage, bacon and fruit (go paleo!) And their sausage was really good. My friend had the chillaquilles and said it was amazing (just looking at it made my mouth water).  I like the ability to pay up front for your food (similar to pubs in London where you order at the bar and give them your table number) but beware that if you pay by credit card you can't leave a tip so be sure to bring cash.

2013-03-24,5.0,"Awesome food, affordable prices and great atmosphere! I haven't dined at a restaurant that has the same concept as Birchwood Kitchen's so I was a bit thrown off at first.  You give your name and party size to the hostess when you first walk in.  You then wait for a table.  You are then allowed to place your order at the counter in the middle of the restaurant once you have been given a table. There is coffee in the back of the restaurant you can grab you cup to sip while you wait for a table.  Also, you can request that the hostess make you a drink if you don't want coffee.  Thankfully, my boyfriend and I must have come in at the right time (a little bit before noon on a Saturday) since we did not have to wait too long for a table. I had the Croque Madame, which was fantastic!  The sandwich comprised of thick slices of county ham, Gruyere cheese for a sweet and salty kick and some Dijon mustard to give it some acidity.  Sunny side eggs were on top of the sandwich and it was served with a small salad. I absolutely loved the sandwich.  All the ingredients worked well together.  It's definitely a knife and a fork type of sandwich.  The salad was a nice touch and I enjoyed the dressing. My boyfriend got the quiche, which had potatoes, bacon and cheese in it.  He enjoyed his quiche, but found it to be a bit cold.  Then again, he was not sure how they would really warm it up so he was OK eating it as is.  His quiche came with a side salad, which he too enjoyed. The best part of the meal (as it usually is for me) was the dessert.  I purposely made room so I could sample some of it.  I got the gooey butter cake, which was divine!  Birchwood put a spin on theirs by using almond.  There also was a fruit topping on the bottom, which I enjoyed.  It wasn't too sweet either.  I would highly recommend trying it if you go! I really enjoyed the feel to the restaurant. You can see the employees working in the kitchen and everyone we interacted with was very friendly and helpful.  It is also BYOB and I saw a table of ladies having drinks with their brunch. However, the restaurant is pretty small too so the front of it can get pretty crowded with other people waiting to eat.  I didn't get the feeling that you could really stay and chat for a while since it is uncomfortable having other people glare at you to leave your table so they can eat.   Also, when it came to tipping, we weren't sure what to do since we paid at the front.  We saw other people putting tip on the table, but unfortunately, our table was cleared so quickly that we weren't able to put one down.  We must come back and dine again so we can leave a nice tip!",0.9972,0.804,0.163,0.033,0.576788247213779

So, I'm a fan BUT  .   .   .  once again, I am mystified by the younger generation who see people waiting for an hour for a table and they continue to sit.  I think the establishment should have a policy about loitering at peak times.  Of course, good manners also help.  Yet again, staff would clear their table and they did not take the hint. I also had the misfortune to be seated next to a young lady who missed her mouth with a spoonful of chickpeas that bounced on the bench and into my purse and onto my jacket.  Now, had she been apologetic, I would have joked about it, but as I cleaned her mess she just continued to talk away.  However, unbeknownst to her, she did clean a little of it with a butt swipe as she got up to replenish her beverage. So, they had run out of the ricotta fritter cakes and 2 of the brunch entrees.  It seemed as the hostess brought over the menu the list of ""what we have run out of"" got longer with each person who entered. However, the food was quite delicious.  I had the breakfast sandwich and, if I am in the area, I would definitely go back. Here's how it works:  you enter, greeted by hostess, told how long the wait, when it is your turn, the hostess tells you your table number, you go to the cashier near the middle of the place, place your order, pay, go sit at your table, and food is brought to your table.  Even a better reason that when you are finished, you can leave.  Okay, I will get off my soapbox.",0.9725,0.867,0.107,0.026,0.37864583333333335

2013-01-09,5.0,"Nomnomnom.  I have just devoured my pot roast sandwich (red wine braised pot roast, roasted tomatoes, caramelized onions, cheddar spread, baguette) and it had surprisingly complex flavors.  The pot roast is melt-in-your-mouth perfectly cooked and the cheddar spread gave it a nice tang.  I don't particularly taste the onions, but I'm not complaining.  The baguette tasted fresh and the pot roast juices mixed in to give it a nice soft flavorful texture without getting mushy.  I also got the tomato herb soup (the special of the day). Also the perfect balance of flavors with a nice herb punch, small pieces of tomato and basil to give it some texture.  It has a hint of creaminess which intensifies the tomato rather than covering unworthy flavors.  Very satisfying.   Also noteworthy: the lovely staff!  Everyone went out of their way to be helpful and nice, and at the end one of them came out to make sure we had everything we needed for our to-go order and to visit with our dog.  It was super funny you could tell he really wanted to pet him and get in there but didn't because of ""health code reasons.""  I can appreciate that! haha.  Nice bunch, we'll be back!  Speaking of bunch, those brunch photos look pretty great.",0.9975,0.689,0.296,0.015,0.6544126984126984

We were curious about their brunch menu, but decided to stick with good ol' sandwiches. Being a vegetarian, I was LOVING their several veggie options (hot & cold sandwiches, salads and soups). I was reading an article on Chicago's top 50 sandwiches and saw the goat cheese sandwich from Birchwood listed. Skeptical of how good this could be, I went ahead and ordered it.... Good grief, how have I not been here before??? The bread is perfect, and the goat cheese/beet/arugula combo is AMAZING. I don't even like beets that much, but these are pickled beets and are awesome.  I was really sad when my sandwich ended, but luckily some of the goat cheese fell on to my huge side salad, which also included pickled onions. Delish. I was stuffed! I got the hazelnut latte with skim milk, and was blown away how sweet but not oversweet this was....still craving it, mmm. All in all, I've definitely spent double on brunch and felt unsatisfied.

2012-09-18,4.0,"I enjoy these Chicago places that do not feel like Chicago. More like a little trip out of town. The staff feel like old friends, even on a first visit. But walking into the narrow old storefront with the exposed brick walls and clean woody decor, Birchwood seemed like a restaurant in Brattleboro, VT or Boulder CO*. Even the other peeps there felt like they were from elsewhere. That couple from a Cialis commercial, the fresh-faced blond students, or the backpackers. Arriving for lunch at prime time, just after noon, there was plenty of seating. They boasted a new menu for fall., We both chose the meatloaf sandwich, with a cup of white bean and swiss chard soup. For a clear broth, the flavors were nicely complex, the greens earthy, and there was just enough spattering of a red pepper, giving the broth a little kick. The meatloaf sandwich was made with toasted sourdough bread. It was filled with softly textured and delightfully herbed fresh meatloaf, fresh tomato relish and melted cheese. Sorry mom, but it was the best meatloaf sandwich I've ever wrapped my mouth around. I took the chips with it but you can get salad, too. The menu in general has a reasonable amount of cold and hot sandwich offerings, some brunch or breakfast items, a few salads (visible in their deli case) and of course bakery dessert items. Service is that hybrid type where you order at the counter, and they deliver. Our service were very timely, helpful and warm. The prices are moderate and what one would expect for an urban bakery. Toward the end of our lunch, one of those drop dead Wicker Park couples walked in. The nice small town granola/academic atmosphere slipped away as I remembered I was back in Chicago. And stepping out to the North Ave.traffic only confirmed that fact.  Can't wait to come back and work my way through the menu.

I wanted to cram in more of their menu items than my belly could hold, for sure. The atmosphere is just homey and inviting - what you want at brunch time. He had the chorizo/egg breakfast special, I had a ham & gruyere and we shared the  sausage stuffed with bacon (OH LORDY!) And the butterscotch oatmeal cookie. It was all righteous - a great way to start the day. It was all damn good! If you can't handle a smallish/tightly packed space...I'd caution you.

They had a lot of stellar reviews, and with two out of the three of us being vegetarian this place seemed like an alright option, though to be honest I wasn't really sure what to expect. When we arrived, we were greeted immediately, and the guy at the counter was very patient while we spent forever looking over the amazing menu. Birchwood is a cute space, a nice mix between a cafe and a sit-down restaurant. The outdoor seating is also a bonus, though when we went it was a little too hot for that. Anyway, everything on the menu sounded delicious, and the fresh, local ingredients were a huge plus. When we finally made our decisions, we ordered our food and were told it would be about ten minutes. Not bad at all for brunch! My roommates both got some version of the gourmet lemonade, and it was fantastic, not to mention it came with free refills! Our food came out very quickly and was amazing. The breakfast sandwich was made with simple ingredients but was SO GOOD. I got the market salad which was also fantastic - the flavors worked together so well (or maybe I'm just addicted to goat cheese), and it was a reasonable portion, which I've found to be rare these days. Seriously, why is it so hard to find a salad that's not either MASSIVE (I'm looking at you Cheesecake Factory) or three pieces of lettuce and one crouton? But I digress.

The environment inside is cozy and cute, and the patio out back is leafy loveliness.  I had the marinated tofu sandwich the first time, which is a nice take on a bahn mi, and an *enormous* sandwich. A big crusty baguette with huge hunks of spicy vietnamese-style marinated tofu with shaved cucumber, radish, carrot, cilantro and jalapeno (if you're a spice wimp like me, beware, cause i ate a humongous hunk and then  had to take an eyes-watering-coughing-sweating break, which might be frowned on depending on your dining company).  The crunch of the bread and the softness of the tofu balance each other really nicely.  The next week, we went back and I had the croque vert, a gruyere-y vegetarian take on a croque madame.  With all the cheese and the fried egg and the dijon-- it was delicious, but a little overwhelming. It would be good to split-sy with another person.  (Also, maybe not the best impressing your dining companion choice, cause I was kinda wrangling the oozy cheese and runny egg yolk with my fingers, which is not really all that cute.)  My fella had the tuna melt both times, once on sourdough and once on multigrain.  It's piping hot and not a mayo bomb like most of the tuna melts out there. Really good. On the side we've had the asiago arugula pasta salad -- yum, and the chickpea salad -- also yum.  All the sandwiches come with a decently sized side salad that's a nicely composed and lightly dressed addition.  Also, the tall fellow who was running the ship both times we were there was efficient, helpful, and really nice.

I love Italian style sammies and this did not disappoint! Not too messy either!  Got an additional side of fruit salad. Very tasty but for $2.50, I thought I could have made this at home.

My wife and I walked in hoping to grab a cup of coffee to go. It turns out they had actually just closed. They sadly broke the news to us and I asked if we could just get coffee to go. They not only poured us coffee, but gave us some free cookies to take with us. Next, the food. The food is always fresh, tasty and a reasonable price. The brunch is exceptional, while lunch and dinner range from good to great. Note: This is a sandwich/deli type place...not an entree, app, dessert type place. I have had misses before with the sandwiches, but it is never bad and since the menu changes all the time, there is always something new to try. They even add Burgers to the menu during the weak and I have really enjoyed the onces I have tasted.  Other notables...coffee is great, baked goods are great, ambiance is cosy, chic, and charming with rotating artwork on the exposed brick wall. BYOB, so bring some wine or beer with you.  All in all just a great neighborhood staple that will hopefully be around for many, many years.",0.9957,0.747,0.217,0.036,0.602020202020202

2012-05-10,4.0,"Birchwood Kitchen is located in the Wicker Park neighborhood that is a very trendy area loaded with a large number of restaurants and clubs.  This BYOB restaurant features soups, sandwiches, salads, and brunch on the weekends.  There is also a bakery on the premises that produces an assortment of breads and pastries.  It has a small, charming dining room as well as an enclosed private and attractive outdoor patio adjacent to the rear of the restaurant building.  Its menu regularly changes, reflecting the availability of seasonal ingredients.  It is somewhat eclectic with a slant on French preparations.  Patrons order their food at a counter and the food is subsequently brought by the wait staff to the diners' tables.  On a recent Sunday my wife and I had brunch there for the first time.  We entered at about 10:15 a.m., were greeted by a very friendly and informative staff member who explained the dining procedure, and were then seated immediately.  (Soon thereafter, the place quickly filled up.)  While we were ordering at the counter, we tried a complimentary sample of a freshly baked batch of scones that was very moist and flavorful.  My wife ordered the Baked French Toast with strawberries and stuffed with a lemon flavored filling.  I ordered the Croque Madame that is a grilled sour dough sandwich filled with ham, gruyere cheese, Dijon mustard, topped with two sunny-side up eggs, and accompanied by a small green salad.  Both dishes were very fresh, well prepared, filling, and appetizing.  The French toast was extremely tasty and not too sweet.  The combination of ingredients in my sandwich worked very well.  The ham was succulent, the melted cheese was very tasty, and the mustard provided just the right amount of kick.      The Birchwood Kitchen is a very inviting small neighborhood restaurant and bakery with a  comfortable atmosphere.   The staff is friendly and shows obvious pleasure and pride in their work, resulting in food that is fresh and delicious.  I highly recommend it with a solid four and one-half star rating.",0.9929,0.841,0.152,0.007,0.47735637169847717

2012-04-25,4.0,"When liquid meets meat, heat and flavoring you get either overcooked meat or something completely divine. In the case of the Birchwood Kitchen it's the latter. I refer to the incredible and amazing pot roast sandwich. I've had some good stuff between two pieces of bread, but the combination of pot roast, cheese and the other bits and pieces that make this plate just work. Seriously, the pot roast sandwich may be one of my favorite sandwiches ever.  The young woman that helped us make our choices and informed us about how the waiting/ordering/sitting works informed us that the seasonal menu is about to change, so go get the sandwich before it vanishes from the menu until next year.  In addition to the sandwich we feasted on the mushroom gravy and biscuits. Yeah, that's good stuff, really good stuff. The gravy is rich even though it's vegetarian. The flavor of mushrooms come through and stand out as a driving force encouraging you to chop that biscuit to shreds and sop up every drop of that flavorful brown stuff.  I don't think you can go wrong with anything ont he menu including the bacon stuffed sausage which is packed with flavor and grilled till the outside crisps like a deep fried sausage. cutting into it releases a torrent of juices.

Grilled sourdough bread, warm gooey cheese, mustard, lots of veggies, and two sunny side eggs on top . I am not even a fan of runny yolks, but they were so delicious on top of that croque. It was served with a side of salad greens with shaved root veggies dressed in a delicious vinaigrette.  My sister got the croquet madame, and she really enjoyed that too. It was very similar to mine, except with ham instead of veggies. My other sister got the breakfast sandwich and it looked good as well. She got a side of chickpea salad and I sampled it. It was cold and crisp and delicious. My most favorite part of this place is the baristas. They make fantastic cappuccini. I have had a handful of great cappuccini since I studied abroad in Milan, and this one definitely makes the list. I would highly recommend it.",0.9969,0.706,0.288,0.006,0.6528472222222222

2012-03-21,4.0,"I like Birchwood. The sandwiches are tasty and the back deck is beautiful. However, being basically a sandwich place, I am not interested in having dinner there if we have to sit inside. Since the restaurant is essentially a deli and you order at the counter, the indoor seating area is as a deli would be - basic, seat yourself. But for some reason, when we go there and try to reserve an outdoor table before we order, the woman at the counter always insists we order first and then she keeps tabs on who gets seated next outside. It doesn't make sense, because when we eat inside, nobody ever tells us where to sit. Tonight we tried to get our table outside, she told us there were plenty of seats outside, so we queued behind another couple at the counter. They then decided to eat outside, and after they walked outside, another staff person came in and said there were no more outside tables. So we left, because we came there only because we wanted to sit outside. At a deli, when you order at the counter, why should the person behind the counter deny you from picking your seat in advance if you want to sit outside, when they don't do that if you eat inside?

2012-03-11,3.0,"UPDATE 10172014 Sadly I have had to downgrade Birchwood Kitchen from 5 to 3 stars. I became a regular, maybe too regular. Post chef change- It's been a long and tough road for them, and after a good dozen+ visits (attempts)  to recapture my zeal, I must confess I'm sad to say the magical fire is not present at this time. It also doesn't help that the prices have been hijacked into a very thin air atmosphere rendering breathing impossible without making the food  better when in fact it has fallen. ----- My Original review- My verbal tendency is to go into a somewhat vulgar tirade.  I'll spare you the voracious and colorful energy. Everything I've tried has been superior. TRULY, very well crafted and thoughtfully put together flavors, assemblies and combinations. I already said superior. I will mention only one offering specifically- One thing that brings me to my knees every single time is the Pot-Roast sandwich. It's simply not funny. Magnificently balanced flavors throughout the entire sandwich. For me, this sandwich alone, is a superlative achievement - quite possibly a perfect sandwich. Again.. it's simply not funny. Yes, so very many great other offerings to be had, all of which exhibit care-filled execution and fantastic flavors. I dig the super-simple service. I like the idea of seasonal offerings and essentially wiping/changing large portions of the menu quarterly... (Please don't take away the best !@%#ing  Pot-Roast (look its even capitalized) sandwich ever... please). One slight bummer is Winter time dining-in. There is but a single door with no vestibule or additional door, and during winter months when you are sitting down enjoying your hot food, the last thing you want to have happen is some dolt/moron/unconscious/stoned/oblivious(I'm the only person in the world) person, open the door... and then even HOLD the door open for their hipster bros/partner/spouse/pupa-containing-SUV-sized-stroller to stumble on in. There is no extra space for an additional door, it's understandable- and quite fine.... stupid people just make it a bummer when your food gets cold while they  hold the door open and dont see everyone giving them the GLARE to shut the #%$^ing door idiot. In the end, I only wish the very best for this place. It's great- and so are the staff-folks you have to interact with.

BUT, I would come back all the way out to Wicker Park from the suburbs to have another of their sammies... with no hesitation.

We tried lentil and Portuguese kale and sausage which were hearty and delicious -Sandwiches: tasty and the bread was fresh. I got the pork belly sandwich and the hubby got a pork tenderloin sandwich which was one of the specials. Next time we're trying the pot roast sandwich, it looked awesome when the table next to us ordered it -Sides: the salad that accompanied my husband's sandwich was fresh and not wilted, and the chips I had were crunchy, not greasy and had chopped chives added to it - even the pickled carrots on the plate as a garnish was a nice touch -Coffee: they serve metropolis coffee here -Boylan's: they serve boylan's soda here -Desserts: they have homemade desserts that are reasonably priced (which we'll definitely try next time!) -Customer Service: is great here, everyone seems to care whether or not you're enjoying your experience The only one negative about this place- it's cold.

2012-01-09,5.0,"After our first brunch at Birchwood, we proceeded to eat here for brunch approximately once a week for the entire rest of the summer and most of the fall.  It got a little ridic. So yeah... as a seasoned Birchwood-Kitchen-eater, I can tell y'all some more things! FH (previously BF) loves to get the Croque Madame.  If you've never been to Paris, that's basically a grilled gruyere and ham sandwich with a fried egg on top.  At Birchwood they take it to a new level and use a wicked spicy parisian mustard which is delicious (if not nose-burning).  The gruyere is fantastic, clearly some kind of cave-aged magic is happening.  I *also* love to get the Croque Mme, however I usually opt to sub out the green salad for the fruit salad to get a little sweetness with my brunch.  Seriously, FH orders this like 99% of the time. For me, I branch out a bit more.  I'm still not the biggest fan of the baked french toast.  The toast part is great, just moist enough but still firm and flavorful, but the custard!  Srsly.  They need to reassess the recipe or something; bake it at a lower temp?  Fewer eggs in the custard? Bake it for a shorter amount of time?  I dunno, but I really hope they read this and change their recipe slightly. Things that I like:  LOVE the belgian waffle.  But then again I'm a waffle kind of girl.  When I order the waffle, I usually order a side of sausage (ummm... bacon stuffed...) which is tasty, but is a bit tough in texture.  I also order randos from the menu which are usually tastilicious. As of last time we went, though, I instructed FH to physically prevent me from ordering another cappuccino there.  Maybe its a personal preference thing, but I find the espresso drinks to be SO bitter, its basically not palatable even with a million sugar packets.  The hot chocolate is pretty good.  That's the extent to which I've sampled the hot beverage menu.  I will try more soon, though, owing to the aforementioned Rachel ban from cappuccino.",0.9733,0.821,0.121,0.058,0.502120696763554

2012-01-03,4.0,"Had the pleasure of trying Birchwood's new year's brunch menu on Saturday and my lips still quiver from the thought of the french toast.  it's prepared in such a way that half inch rectangular stalks of bread are stacked together with a half inch rectangular stalk of egg on top (or bottom depending on how you see it). No need to add syrup or fuss about it. Just put it all in your mouth as soon as it's set down. Don't ask people at your table to try it because it will leave you less to eat---even when you're crying about how full you are, it'll be hard to let it go.  Also had some bacon stuffed sausages and I easily gave up my ""just eat the meat"" philosophy when i'm full--french toast trumps bacon at the Birchwood Kitchen.  Other pros were the friendly staff and the butterscotch cookie.  I'm not sure how I feel about the cafeteria style ordering. Upon entering, you walk up to the counter, grab a menu, order at the counter and pay, then you get assigned a table. I'm generally okay with it, but when you have a larger party of couples where one of the two orders, it can create a huge awkward standing crowd hovering over hungry people... but once you get a table, it's good eats!",0.9289,0.859,0.098,0.043,0.4966161616161616

2011-12-09,5.0,"Birchwood Kitchen snared me with casual dishes made from local, seasonally-available ingredients,*** served in an airy cafe or out on their spacious patio. The operation works like a full-service cafeteria, where diners line up at the register to place their orders before being given a table to which their meals are delivered. But the food... Sometimes, I want to eat a delicately-seasoned white bean soup, a hot ham sandwich, or a BLT with house made pickles. Birchwood Kitchen is where I go for these seemingly ""no frills"" indulgences, because for one thing, I only allow myself to eat local, sustainable meats, which the chefs there use exclusively (right, guys?). The important takeaway for less finicky eaters is that the food is delicious and simple - like something you would make at home if you had a nuanced palate, a gift for creating inventive recipes that are never fussy, and access to farm-fresh ingredients every night of the week. Sometimes, I don't want to go to a restaurant for pork shoulder braised with porcini mushrooms in chianti. Neither my wallet nor my blood pressure can afford to eat that. Moreover, that's an intense flavor combination that I wouldn't want to eat day after day. Instead, I want nutty gruyere melted over tuna and roasted tomatoes on fresh sourdough. I want house-marinated beets, shaved deli-fine, atop creamy goat cheese with rich arugula-walnut pesto on a baguette. They have a deli case filled with cold and hot sides that seem to change constantly, so there's always something new you can add to a standby sandwich. Are you getting my drift?  Oh wait, there's more.  My favorite kind of chocolate chip cookie: 4-inch diameter, half-inch thick with plenty of soft dough and crisp edges (Warning: not a chip-centric cookie. I know some people prefer more chocolate). Their lemon bars are also brilliant. Crumbly shortbread with tangy, light lemon curd that makes you forget the saccharine, grainy lumps made by less skillful bakers. Did I mention they're BYOB? Oh yes. So you can have beer with your burger, whiskey with your steak, and sake with your kale salad, if you've had your fill of local tea, coffee, soda, and house-made fruity drinks (another Yelper mentioned the lemonade).  Finally, the staff is comprised of sweet, tolerant people. They manage to stay friendly and accommodating in spite of have nowhere to hide during their shifts, as their kitchen is totally exposed to the small dining room. The restaurant can get quite busy on the weekends, so expect a little bit of a wait. If it's too busy, come back on a weeknight.  *** Pro tip: this means their selection changes with the seasons.

It's also filled with delicious aromas. *Our food came out very quickly. No wonder there was no wait!  *You get free coffee with your first foursquare check in.  I had the Breakfast Sandwich which came with salad and roasted red potatoes: delicious and satisfying. The bf had the Sausage Quiche which came with a fruit salad and a side of roasted red potatoes. From the speed with which he polished it off (too quickly for me to grab a bite!), I'd say he was more than content. We also got some Pumpkin Chocolate Chip bread and a Lemon Square to go. I've yet to try the Lemon Square, but I'm eating the bread as I write this and it's fantastic.

We figured that wasn't too bad and probably par for the course anywhere else anyway, so we grabbed some ciders from the counter and headed out to the patio area out back until our table was ready. When it was, we went back inside, ordered and paid at the counter, and then sat down. Our food came out really fast and was all delicious.

Because-as everyone knows-French is classy, just like Birchwood Kitchen! First of all, if you're dining in (or ""in"" outside, on their lovely patio) you order at the counter and they bring your food out to your table. Be sure you look at both the paper menu and the specials board before making your selection. As BK aims to prepare fresh, seasonal fare their menu tends to change, but there should always be a number of good choices on it. Lunch fare is generally SSS: soups, sandwiches and salads. Brunch has both sweet & savory selections. (SSS again!)  I went once for brunch and once for lunch, and was very pleased with both. The grilled cheese in particular sticks out in my mind. Plenty of hot, gooey, tasty (real!) cheese...mmm mmm good. It went just right with the delicious soup. The place is not big, but has a decent amount of seating. It's clean and bright and is just very pleasant in general....like the people who work there, at least in my experience. If you're looking for a good brunch (on the weekend) or lunch, you can't go wrong with Birchwood. Now dinner? That's the one meal I haven't had there, but one of these days (Tuesdays through Fridays to be more specific) I'll have to rectify that!",0.9949,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.5890667761357417

The Grilled Gruyere was fantastic.  The gooey, crusty around the edges Gruyere paired with the perfectly caramelized onions and the spicy dijon that adds a nice bite...all melted between two slices of sourdough, I absolutely loved it.   The Turkey Meatball sandwich was also super tasty.  Moist, flavorful meatballs with spicy black beans that had me reaching for a glass of water...it had a definite kick but again, I loved it.   Their salads are fresh and full of seasonal ingredients and always look amazing.  Their menu is constantly changing so I'm excited for a new season to roll around.  I'm definitely going to have to stop in for brunch on the weekends or for a burger after 5pm, no doubt they'll be just as fantastic as everything else!  Birchwood is just the perfect little neighborhood cafe.",0.9975,0.653,0.314,0.033,0.6293324954615277

The prices are still a little high, but the truth is that they're not that far from the going rate in this neighborhood.  The food is good - I had the Gruyere grilled cheese everyone raves about, and it was good but I think I'd try something more complex next time.  I also brought home an oatmeal butterscotch cooking that was addictingly delicious.",0.9754,0.852,0.134,0.014,0.49304347826086947

The staff here is so friendly and accommodating - we had a party of 6 for brunch which is a little tough as the (indoor) seating is rather limited but they made it work!  They had self-serve water and coffee (honour system - just mention it when you order) while you wait.  You put  your name down with the hostess, and when a table is ready for your group, she would signal you to proceed to order at the counter.   Food was delicious.  I had the Polanta with country sausage ragout, braised greens and poached eggs while Grape S had the French Toast with pear.  The rest of the group enjoyed their food as well. It was very chill inside and because they don't overload it with tables, at no point did the noise level get too loud.  There is an outdoor patio at the back but too bad it was drizzling earlier that day so we couldn't sit outside but the day cleared up and I saw a group sitting there by the time we left.  Location is great - easy to get to via public transportation (Milwaukee or Damen or North Ave bus, or the blue line Damen stop), and tons of FREE street parking.   Everyone loved my find (thanks to yelp), and oh, the foursquare special for free coffee didn't hurt either!",0.9954,0.739,0.225,0.035,0.48804050355774503

There al fresco seating out back, so it's particularly fun to eat here when the weather is nice. Just FYI, it's BYOB. Birchwood's forte is salads, sandwiches, soups, and interesting sides. I know it sounds simple, but they really put a creative twist on all their dishes. If you're into stuff like beets, quinoa, goat cheese, arugula--y'know, bourgie veggie food--you'll be in heaven. They use seasonal and fresh ingredients and great bread (without any factual basis, I also assume that this is the kind of place that sources their food locally as much as possible). There are many vegetarian options, but it's by no means a *vegetarian restaurant* and my meat-eating friends love this place as much as I do.  The sandwiches are slightly not-cheap at 7-10 dollars, but Birchwood is good for anything from quick lunch to casual date to place-to-take-your-out-of-town-parents.  The only drawback, really, is that the iron patio furniture is uncomfortable and will leave a fishnet imprint on your legs if you're wearing a skirt or shorts. But this certainly is not anything worthy of downgrading the rating, since I feel like outdoor seating tends to be uncomfortable basically everywhere.

My vegetarian favorites are the goat cheese and beet for warm days, and the grilled gruyere and caramelized onion on cooler ones. Vegans can go for the lemony and delicious chickpea sandwich - it tastes like summer and is great with chips on the side. The vegan and delicious vegetable sandwich with spiced cashew butter was awesome too. For breakfast, you can't do much better than the croque vert.  OH! And how could I forget the vegan burger, offered alongside otherwise meaty creations, on Tuesday-Friday nights? So delicious and filling, and it's great that vegans/vegetarians aren't excluded from some burger fun (as we often are). This is a handmade patty, no Morningstar Farms or Boca in the house. I am sorry to have moved fairly far from the neighborhood... I know I will make a point to continue eating at Birchwood Kitchen as often as I can.",0.9932,0.676,0.235,0.088,0.7142857142857142

2011-08-22,5.0,"""Stuck inside these four walls..."" So on her 29th* birthday plus one, I decided to take her to Birchwood Kitchen for lunch.  Yelp gets all of the credit for this one.  Yelpers have gotten this one right.  Cheers. I'm not much of a Bucktown/Wicker Park kind of guy because this part of town always conjures up dirty, gritty, unkempt images that tend to scare sheltered, conservative, formerly suburban boys.  That should fly well on The Yelp.  Well, Birchwood Kitchen is none of the above.   Birchwood Kitchen is basically an immaculately spotless country store turned urban sandwich shop.  You get the best of both worlds with this urban oasis.  There's lots of dark wood as well as the light wood of the actual Birch tree that miraculously has grown inside the place.   When you walk in, you'll be greeted by a friendly, unpretentious and sincere counter person who will advise you of the protocol.  You order, have a seat and then your food is squired to you in an ever so friendly manner.  I've never had more gracious, candid service anywhere.  It's remarkable and extraordinary.   As for the food, the gruyere with ham was lovely, as was her panzanella salad (I could seriously eat a plateful of those addictive pickled red onions.).  The same goes for the iced tea, which they will refill for free.  Tea and free are always for me. Everything about this place is perfect: the food, the service and the ambiance.  The company was perfect too, but you can't have her. Hey, they even spin my records.  Bravo.  As such, being... ""...Sent inside forever..."" ...wouldn't be a bad thing, as long as it was inside Birchwood Kitchen. Five magnificent and glowing stars.  Get yourself and your band on the run to this place forthwith.",0.9809,0.841,0.13,0.028,0.5542366946778712

I had the BLT Special.  Very delicious traditional BLT, with a fresh side.  The splash of citrus/acid really brightened up the sandwich and added a unique dynamic.  Only complaint was the bread - while tasty, it became a bit tough/chewy for such a bright, fresh sandwich.  Failed to compliment the rest of the sandwich.  Pickled squash provided a nice balance to the sandwich as well.  Those are the types of details that set Birchwood apart. Salad was lightly dressed and pickled onions brought it together nicely. Chocolate chip banana bread was fantastic.  So nice with my coffee.",0.9897,0.618,0.341,0.041,0.6919047619047619

2011-08-17,1.0,"Very, very disappointing. My beau and I were craving some serious gourmet deli sandwiches, what we got was not only inedible, but disgraceful to real sandwich shops everywhere. There is nothing worse than spending $23 on two sandwiches to-go for a 5-hour-drive back to Michigan and having to stop at Culver's fast food to throw them out and get a freaking burger. A waste of time and money, it took them 20 minutes to make the sandwiches and there were 4 people working and no other customers! Grilled Gruyere, FAIL. It was a nasty, oily, sweet, grease dripping, mess. Moreover it had no flavor or finesse. The caramelized onions were down right mushy. The italian salami sandwich, FAIL. I can't even go into the details of its 1.5 inch layer of hot pepper cream cheese or its lack of actual salami without purging...it literally impaired my taste buds for the remainder of the drive, gag. Only plus was that they had a super friendly staff, sadly no amount of great customer service can make their food edible:-(.",-0.9806,0.666,0.101,0.233,0.5427174603174603
2011-08-17,4.0,"I wasn't sure how I would feel about Birchwood, since I don't really like sandwiches, and thus obviously rarely eat them. But, I was pleasantly surprised, and I must hand it to the yelp community: the 4.5 stars Birchwood earned are well-deserved. First, we were a party of three and we were helped within 10 minutes of putting our name in. Keep in mind this was a beautiful Saturday afternoon at noon, so I was shocked it didn't take longer to get seated. But our ""greeter"" informed us we were sitting at the ""lovely"" table #28. The outdoor section is so cute and calm. Not overly crowded or loud, but relaxed and charming.  I was flustered in the beginning because I didn't know what to order! What with all of the sandwiches, I was pretty much screwed. No just kidding, I really wasn't. Luckily I love myself a grilled cheese. So I ordered a grilled cheese with gruyere, onions, and dijon mustard. I was thinking in my head....""dijon mustard on a grilled cheese?"" I asked my friend Kirsten (who knows my eating habits like the back of her hand) if I would like it and she said that I likely would. So, I went out on a limb and tried a grilled cheese with mustard. This might seem like a normal combo to all you foodies out there, so don't laugh. As I've said before, I don't harbor the most sophisticated of palettes. So anyway, it was so yummy! The dijon mustard sort of cut the grease, as my friend explained, and while it was an odd pairing, I really loved it. The onions were a nice touch, and the mixed green salad was perfect. Lightly dressed and refreshing. Top it all off with a bottle of perrier sparkling water, and you have yourself a very nice Saturday brunch.",0.9868,0.678,0.204,0.119,0.6678819444444444

But if you like proscuitto, do. not. hesitate. I have a sick love affair with proscuitto and this was loaded like proscuitto is free. They just ran out of the artichoke mint tapenade - but then added fresh mozz on it.

Nice warm waffles. Tasty creamy polenta with light garlic, not overwhelming.. They so clearly know what they're doing that I'm confident every dish on the menu is good. Next time we'll test that theory.  The staff is very friendly and helpful to first-time visitors (both us and the people in front of us). You stand in line to order, but have a table assigned before you place your order. Everything is well run and user friendly.

First Impression:  Great look and feel on the inside, with actual Birchwood trees in the store.  Was immediately greeted and handed a menu and given a table.  As it got more busy, they had a person greeting and directing people.  Very well organized and very friendly staff. The process:  You go up the counter and order and they will give you a table number there.  Then your food is brought out to you. My kind of style, with great service that was quick and easy The food:  God Damn...I feel as though all of our food should taste this good.  They only use the freshest ingredients which you can taste.  Most are seasonal and the food combination are original.  I had the Madame which was a great mixture of a sandwich topped with two over easy eggs.  While Paul, had the GBLT which was a combo of bacon & salmon and enjoyed it.  Both came with a salad which was different, but ironically seemed to pair our meals perfectly.  I'd do it again.  Final Assessment:  Since it's so close, this is a definite go to spot where there are plenty of options that change as the season changes.  If you have more then 4 peeps, I'd go somewhere else.  See you there one of these weekends!",0.9843,0.832,0.168,0.0,0.63125
2011-05-14,5.0,"Been here a dozen times, and I have never been disappointed in Birchwood.  I have to comment on some of the bad reviews of Birchwood: 1.  I am amazed at how easily people get confused by the ordering procedures. They do things a little differently than Applebee's, and people feel like they are in a foreign land. ""Where's my vibrating, light-up coaster?"" Please, It only takes a moment to figure it out - it's hardly an inconvenience. 2.  Someone made the accusation in a review that all good reviews of Birchwood are from employees, or friends of employees, or friends of owners, as if to say that the employees are trying to encourage business to gain financially. That's laughable. Assuming the good reviews truly are only from friends and the like, isn't having so many friends a good thing?  I don't work there, nor am I friends with anyone that works there or the owner(s), and by writing this single review I have weakened the ""employee-review"" hypothesis almost to the point of disproving it.  3.  The same reviewer (maybe not) complained about having to lean over or step to the side to see the menu behind the tall cashier. That must have been so inconvenient for someone so wickedly lazy! And a complaint about the cashier hitting on a girlfriend. I can picture this reviewer now: paranoid, jealous, and ignorant to the difference between a compliment and a romantic advance. Go back to your strip mall T.G.I.F. where you feel safe. 4. Complaints about price: If you want a feed lot in your back yard, keep going to Jimmy John's - they even have free smells there. Fresh, local ingredients, and well treated, decently paid employees make the higher than average price worth it. I doubt Birchwood's owners are flying to the Caribbean on NetJets to count all the money they're gouging from us.  The food is always great. The service is always fast and friendly. BYOB earns a few more points, but I sometimes wish for a bloody with my brunch, and dragging the fixin's along is just too troublesome.",0.9242,0.753,0.152,0.095,0.5193154761904761

Go L'Appetito.  But for the best tuna melts? I leave it up to the sandwich crafters at Birchwood. They also make insanely good tomato bisque (this coming from someone who typically hates tomatoes) and couscous.

We ended up going to Birchwood Kitchen because it is so high rated and, after waiting for half an hour, we finally got a table. I have to recognize that EVERY person working there was extremely nice, but we really didn't like the system of no waiters that they have. This means that after you wait for half an hour to get a table, you have to leave your stuff there and go make the line to order your food in the bar. Bad. The menu is very short, really short. My boyfriend had the croque madamme and I had the croque vert, and we both thought it was disappointing. The croque sandwiches are supposed to have bechamel on top, which makes the bread tender, rich and easy to cut. In this case, there was no bechamel and only melted cheese on top of a really hard bread, which made pretty much impossible to cut it with the knife. Plus the taste was just not that good.

Amazing.  What I couldn't finish, they boxed up for me.   My daughter had a kids PB&J combo, tasty potato chips, and a side of fruit. A pretty good deal, and she enjoyed it. My only suggestion would be that they get some larger paper bags with handles on them, we had to carry our little to go boxes outside and it was raining heavily.  I still ate my damp leftover salad (wilted greens and all), because it was just that awesome. Also, they can turn every sandwich combo into a salad, which is great for people like me who don't eat bread.  I can't tell you how much I hate grilled chicken ceasar salad being the only meat salad offered at restaurants.  I can't wait to try the duck salad in the future.

I had the bacon bread pudding and it was good.  The blood orange juice was amazing.  The menu was really interesting and there were a bunch of things I would have considered getting (this never happens to me). I was really happy with and impressed by the menu.

They do everything from the classics like croque madames to hot sandwhiches constructed around wine-braised pot roast and lamb meatloafs with yogurt gremolata.  The last time I was here, my girlfriend got their croque vert which is essentially a sandwhich of vegetables and eggs.  It was AMAZINGLY GOOD.  It blew me away that I would be able to enjoy such a thing, much less crave and dream about it.  I got the ham and gruyere.  You think you know ham and cheese after eating it for lunch for the past 20 years?  Come try it at BK. These guys use really fresh ingredients - even the little side salads next to their sandwhiches taste like they're made in a five-star place.  I also love how they feature local artists' work, and brick wall homey-feel in Wicker Park just makes BK an inimitable, local gem.",0.9873,0.836,0.15,0.013,0.39748677248677244

I'm giving Birchwood five stars because they gave me five pounds of coffee at a discount. Well, not really a discount. Absolutely free. I talked with Daniel, one of the co-owners, about purchasing a five pound bag of coffee for my brother in Afghanistan. My brother does IED route clearance and gets about four hours of sleep a night, so he really lives off of coffee. I thought it would be a nice treat for my brother to give him Chicago's best coffee (Metropolis). I talked to Judd, the other co-owner/manager, and just wanted to make sure Birchwood would order me the coffee. No problem, he said. On top of that I was going to be given a 10% discount. At this point I'm really happy. Yesterday I pick up my gigantic bag of coffee and pay 10% off whatever the price was. I'm just about to run to the post office today when Judd gives me a call. He tells me that the coffee arrived last night (I know, I was there! :) ). I told him I already purchased the coffee and thanked him once again. He tells me that's a problem because the coffee is free of charge. Yup, FREE. Five pounds of coffee for my lovely brother for FREE. I'm really just stunned.

The menu: BK, you had me a grilled cheese.  Times three.  Which one would I choose?  Would they judge me if I picked all three?  Was I going to have to come back in disguise later in the day?  After much debate, I went with the Grilled Mozzarella.  I have no words to describe.  I'll just say that eating that sandwich was truly magical and leave it at that.  Somehow, in my dairy-induced daze, my dining companions were able to pry it out of my hands for a taste of their own and gave it equally rave reviews.  Needless to say, I cleaned my plate, as did everyone else at my table.

The sandwich had a little bite since it had some jalapeno on it but it gave the sandwich a lot of flavor. The side was very tasty.  My grilfriend had the goat cheese sandwich with pickeled beets which she really enjoyed. The baguette was nice and fresh! For dessert I had a piece of carrot cake that was really good. It even had some pineapple in it.

I've been going to Birchwood for over a year now, and I've eaten here at least a dozen times. It's my fail-safe, local restaurant. The staff here is always incredibly friendly and attentive. The gentleman who usually takes my order at the register always wears a sincere smile, and thanks me for my business. The bussers are always on their game and regularly check on me. The only thing that could make the service better would be a back massage while I wait for my food (preferably from Kristen Bell). Foodwise, I've never purchased anything here that wasn't tasty. I'm not going to say that I've always been blown away by everything I've eaten here, because that would make me a liar. (And since I wear polyester pants, they'd surely catch on fire. Polyester is very flammable.) However, I will say that I've never been disappointed by any of the food. From the quiche to the frittata to the breakfast sandwich to the croque madame for brunch to the meatoaf sandwich for lunch to the bacon-cheddar burger for dinner, I've always left satisfied. And frequently, I'm more than just satisfied. I'm straight up food retarded. I swear that the bacon-cheddar burger here is the best burger I've ever had in my life. Kuma's seriously has nothing on it. And the breakfast pork patty is always mouth-watering. I'm not sure if the cooks are infusing their food with crack, but whatever they're doing, it works.

2010-04-28,5.0,"Perfection at Birchwood Kitchen comes in threes: 1. They make the perfect sandwich.  Really. Ordinarily I have issues with most sandwiches - bad bread, too much/little filling, too much/little condiments, or I'm just bored of the offers. At Birchwood Kitchen, I had major issues. What do I want to eat?! I choose a sandwich over salad, then cold over hot, then narrowed down to 2: duck or speck. I went with speck and it came down to the green apple slaw on the duck vs. the fig blood orange compote on the speck. If the only decisions people had to make where ones like these, life would be a much better place, no?  The sandwich was perfect. Baguette was crusty on the outside, chewy on the inside. The speck was salty, smoky and there was plenty of it. Balanced with peppery arugula and the sweet fig blood orange compote that haunts my dreams... simple, unassuming.. perfection x1. 2. They make the perfect side salad.  How many sandwiches have you had that come with lame sides? A bag of chips? An apple? Mediocre fries? Green leaves with too much balsamic dressing? Bah! The side salad that you can choose to pair with your sandwich (and you should do this, eat your greens!) is dressing with a tangy dressing and has shaved carrots, homemade pickles, and a thinly sliced pickled beet in it. You know someone in the kitchen is spending many a prep hour at the mandolin. Absolutely mind-blowing that a side salad would be so thoughtfully crafted. And yes, the best side salad I have had in my life. Perfection x2! 3. Their staff provides the perfect service. The people who work there are incredibly friendly. You are greeted when you walk in and told about the specials. Everyone has a smile of their face. The sweet girl who brought our sandwiches went to wrap up our sweet treats as we weren't eating them there. The guy at the counter? My dreamboat server, offering up a sample of their lentil soup when the white bean escarole I wanted wasn't available and fielding my questions about the bizarre bowl of green veggies in their display case. Turns out, they are pickled broccoli rabe! Dreamboat server saw my curiosity and gave me some to sample (note: not for those with weak stomachs). Perfection x3. This place is just fabulous. I eat out a lot and I haven't left in such excitement from an establishment for a while now.

2010-04-18,2.0,"Yelp, what has become of you? While I love the concept of Yelp, the site has become a site for business owners to game the reviews and the rankings. I now have to read between the lines to determine which restaurants are 2 star places masquerading as 4 and 5 star establishments. That brings us to my review of the Birchwood Kitchen. How I found the place: through Yelp having logged in this morning to look for a good Sunday brunch/sandwich place. My initial impressions about the nearly perfect reviews about Birchwood Kitchen: Possibly too good to be true. As some of the reviews point out, the place is celebrating its first year. Yet there were 153 reviews before my post? I realize that good news travels fast, but this is a fairly plain restaurant with an average menu. Still, I put my doubt aside and said, ""let's give the place the benefit of the doubt"". My review once we were there: The decor is better than how the picture on the company's pdf presents the place. But, how novel is the loft look (exposed brick and ventilation duct) nowadays? Have you just moved to the city? Are you used to being around barns? Moving beyond my mostly positive impression on the look of the interior, we did see that there is a patio with tables and chairs. The sun was pouring into the courtyard, but here's where the experience fell apart. My girlfriend and I stood in line for the cashier, while an employee with a note pad walked around the tables. The GF and I read the marker boards, perused through the to-go menu, and once we were two spots from the front of the line, the employee with the note pad asked us to wait to get a seat first, before ordering at the cashier. Digest that procedure for a moment. We moved outside to the patio, while the employee apologized, saying that the restaurant was understaffed on that particular day. I said that it was quite alright, although the setup and the operations of the place seemed thoroughly ill/unplanned. After waiting in the courtyard for a further 10 minutes, my name was called and we moved inside. There we were informed what our table number was, and we fell in line for the cashier again. Btw, whoever chose to put the 6'+ tall guy working at the register should think again. This guy is so tall that he blocks out the drink menu board. I had to look around him to read the drink list. Back to the ordering ... once we got to the front of the line, the doofus register guy proceeded to hit on my girlfriend. Perhaps I should give this place one star instead of two. Following ordering, the wait for the food took another 15 - 20 minutes. Then came the realization that this is a truly ordinary sandwich shop that impresses people who have never seen rocket salads. The ingredients are not worth the prices, and I am now certain that the 5 star reviews about this place are from employees, paid Yelpers, friends and family of the Birchwood Kitchen, and people who have left their barns for the first time to see the city, loft sandwich shops and rocket salad leaves. On top of clueless operations and management, the long waits, and ""high end"" ingredients at exorbitant prices, the bread on both of the sandwiches were too hard. My sandwich was on French bread, but the crust was hard and brittle. My girlfriend's sandwich was on regular bread, but it was toasted to the consistency of a brown rock. All in all, the entertainment that we received at the restaurant was related to how we could better use the space, and discussing where we would go to eat and drink after the Birchwood Kitchen. I will never eat here again and I'm just as open to giving this place a one star as I am to having given it two.",0.9947,0.88,0.1,0.02,0.4168782143782144

I'm not a seasoned charcuterie eater so I can't expand too much about it besides it being cheesy wonderfulness with a side of extra crispy pickle and chips.  Tomato bisque was delicious. They had soft chunks of onion and other veggie bits to texturize the soup, making it a lot fuller than most bisques. I was a fan.  My favorite dish was actually the arugula salad. WOW. Not your average salad that doesn't fill you up. First, this plate was a huge mama, with generous helpings of butternut squash and pickled beets and showered with goat cheese on top. I was pleasantly surprised how filling it was!  I had to try the butterscotch oatmeal cookie--addicting! Interior dark wood decorations, open air kitchen, nice wooden furniture and easy seating.

You order from a counter, then take a seat, and they bring you your food once it's done. We ordered the burgers (two of us had the southwest turkey burger, one in the group had the bacon burger) and when they arrived at our table, we couldn't believe our eyes. They were huge let me tell you. Usually when I eat out I save half of my food for lunch the next day but none of us could stop at half. We all devoured our entire burgers. SO DELICIOUS. My friend who recommended the place said their food is local and organic so that makes me feel even better about devouring my whole southwest burger. Embarrassingly enough, we were having such a good time that we shut the place down. When they finally turned off the music (about 45 minutes after they closed) we knew it was time to go. They were gracious about us being the last table in there and we didn't feel rushed at all (or maybe that was all the wine we consumed).

2010-04-06,5.0,"""So, can I ask you a question about your pickles?""  This is a true question that I asked upon my recent visit to Birchwood Kitchen. I'm a little late to the BK game here, I can see that.  However, better late than never, I'm sayin'.  Birchwood is the bee's knees.  Serious. Big, bountiful sandwiches served aside your choice of chips or a marvelous green salad.  Fresh ingredients, HOMEMADE pickles (we will discuss that tidbit later) and smiling faces.  Bee's knees. I enjoyed the pork belly sandwich which is very similar to a bahn mi with it's porky goodness, cilantro and jalapeno (although watch the peppers, I nearly singed my mouth off!)  P.I.C. ordered better though.  The meatloaf sandwich is outta this world good.  Double stacked with  bacon and bbq, this sandwich does. not. mess. around.  Meatloaf fans can rejoice, there is a sandwich that does it's loafiness justice. The homemade chips were fantastic, as was my side salad, perfectly dressed and plentiful. Now, back to the pickles.  These are not ordinary pickles, obviously.  I detected from the first bite that these pickles were homemade.  Therefore I asked.  ""Tell me about your pickles.""  Sure enough, homemade.  And what's more, apparently one of the guys back there is a pickle ""nut"".  He likes to pickle all sorts of things and incorporate it into dishes.  YUM.  Big fan here. High class sandwiches at totally reasonable prices.  We had lunch for two for under $20 and enjoyed every morsel immensely.  We decided dessert was mandatory for our walk home, so despite my initial inclination toward the lemon bar, we went with the oatmeal butterscotch cookie.  The HUGE oatmeal butterscotch cookie.  Perfection.  (But I'm going all lemon bar, all the way, next time.) Late to the game, sure.  But I'll be back often.  For sandwiches.  And for pickles.  (Duh.)",0.9958,0.802,0.194,0.004,0.47188131313131315

Beer Jelly! And as odd as it sounds, the jelly truly makes the sandwich. Not that it wouldn't be great without: these are top-quality ingredients, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that it looks as though each individual leaf of arugula was placed on my sandwich for the aesthetic appeal alone.  That could explain why some reviewers are not as happy about how long it takes to be served at the Birchwood...but seriously? It is truly worth it.  The meal that makes me curse with delight, however, is the f'ing spinach salad. It's warm. With duck confit and duck sausage and white beans. It's heavenly.  My brother has had a burger here, which they offer in the evenings, and says that it was one of the finest he's had, and I don't doubt it.  The only thing I was slightly less than thrilled about was the basic Green salad, and I can't put my finger on why; too many beets, perhaps? And I promise that I'm just being very picky; it was still delicious. I like that you can turn any of their sandwiches into a salad. That's neat.

So good, I practically licked the plate. Buttternut squash, bacon, maple, spinach and other things I'm forgetting under 2 friend eggs. Deliciousness.

2009-11-24,5.0,"I had a long overdue lunch date with an old friend, and Birchwood Kitchen was her suggestion. She said it was an ""organic sandwich shop,"" which left me wondering what that meant..good, it means good!  Our tete-a-tete was set for 2:00 pm on a Thursday so we were past the lunch rush, which I'm assuming this place gets. I walked in and was greeted by a very nice lady in a white paper hat, who invited me to pick any seat I wanted, and brought me a menu to peruse while I waited for my date to arrive. The smells coming from the kitchen were absolutely heavenly, and I was afraid I'd wind up ordering one of everything.  I knew I wanted a hot sandwich and maybe a cup of soup to go with it, and I was given a very generous taste of the spicy sweet potato soup (yum!) to accompany my grilled Gruyere and ham sandwich.  My date brought wine but I like to have a nonalcoholic side beverage to go with it, so I ordered the homemade lemonade. I can't rave enough about that lemonade; it was so clear it looked like lemon-flavored water, but has a wonderfully fresh taste and isn't too sweet. If they sold that stuff by the jug I'd be there every week for my fix. My friend had the lamb french dip (i think that's what it was) which looked delicious, and I'll definitely have to try next time. Her first visit was for a birthday dinner for a friend, and she said the burgers are to die for. I believe that means a dinner visit is in order.  We sat there for at least 3 hours talking, drinking, eating, and at no point did we get evil glares to hurry up and leave. Granted, we were the only patrons in the joint, but, I still appreciated the lack of ""hurry up and go."" Birchwood Kitchen offers fresh delicious food in a warm setting, all overseen by a super-friendly staff. I can't wait for my next visit.",0.9944,0.761,0.19,0.049,0.4838888888888889
2009-11-23,5.0,This place is right down the street and is exactly what is needed in the neighborhood. The food is really good.  I have only been for lunch (or sandwich take out) and the food is just delicious.  It's not cheap but not super expensive either. They are super nice - almost in a Stepford wives sort of way.  Joking of course.   They make butterscotch oatmeal cookies too.  There is nothing better in the world than butterscotch and everyone seems to have forgotten this fact. It's just a great little place.  Nothing supernatural but solid food and fresh ingredients and clearly made with care.  I do not work here.,0.9261,0.68,0.215,0.105,0.5948853615520282

I have the mushroom and my husband had the gruyere with ham (I would have preferred it sans ham, but that's just me).

2009-11-10,5.0,"I live almost next door to Birchwood. My boyfriend complains about it every time I suggest going because he thinks everything is about $2 more expensive than it should be. On one hand, it is about $2 more than I think I should be spending on a burger or a sandwich. On the other hand, it's par for course considering the yuppifying creep into wicker park. While I never WANT to pay a bit more for a great sandwich, that's what the $2 are buying you. Everything at Birchwood feels and tastes fresh and fancy. I always get the burger - but they only start serving them at 5pm. I asked the owner once, he said it had to do with how small the kitchen is. Whatever, it's worth the wait. The green salad is fresh and tasty and big enough. The soups are always fresh tasting and delicious.  Also, as other reviews have mentioned, the owner, a 40?50?something man has this odd charisma that makes interacting with him an unusually positive experience. The other staff are also unusually nice and patient. A few weeks ago my boyfriend and I went up to order and happened to get to the cashier right before a huge group of people got up to pay. Nevertheless, the cashier, without a hint of an attitude, answered boyfriend's endless questions about if x dish had y ingredient.  The atmosphere is really clean and friendly. They play good music but not too loud. I'd recommend Birchwood to anyone, so long as they weren't feeling cheap.",0.9935,0.772,0.199,0.029,0.522914207005116

2009-11-03,4.0,"Take one rainy, Friday afternoon, couple it with two old friends catching up, add in some good food and what do you have? Birchwood Kitchen. A perfect way to wile away an afternoon.  As I parked my car out front (free street parking- is that even possible anymore? But there really were no signs) and dodged the raindrops to the door- I wondered why I had not been to Birchwood Kitchen before. The space is quite nice with exposed brick walls lined with birchwood (clever, eh?) with seating along the left wall and in in the front windows and the counter that you order at to the right side.  Specials are written on large chalk boards in the front but if you are like me and can't remember what you want from the chalkboard by the time you walk over to the cash register, take one of the to-go menus- it helps.  They ask if you have picked out a table yet (all the tables have numbers on them) and after you tell them where you are seating you place your order and then sit and wait until it is brought out to you. Not a long wait might I add!  I ordered comfort food all the way around as I was tired of my feet being wet in my good shoes and my hair looking like a disaster given all the rain as of late. Split pea soup with big chunks of ham and a grilled cheese on baguette with tomatoes and bacon (there was a pork theme here for sure). My friend had the soup and their garden salad. We also ordered a couple of their ""diet colas"" some kind of pure cane sugar drinks that, while it wasn't my stand by of Diet Coke, it was good in a different sort of way.  The food was delicious (and huge, I might add) A half of sandwich had that been an option would have been plenty. And the salad so big that only half got eaten there as well. And hold on to your seat- the potato chips that they serve along side in their own little ""tower"" are worth the trip alone! Lunch for two cost around $28. They also do brunch and know that it's BYOB.  A great find- even my friend who hangs in the area often never heard of it so while I hate to give my new favorite place away- take it from me. Go sit- have a sandwich and some soup. And you'll be raving about it too!",0.9914,0.818,0.135,0.046,0.6062329645662978

I am a dedicated sandwich snob... to me there is nothing more perfect than ingredients layered between sliced bread. So, deciding amongst Birchwood's artisinal offerings is the only  conundrum I encountered here. I myself am a committed carnivore with little sympathy for the drab plight of my vegetarian (or, shudder, vegan) friends, BUT after grappling with the choice between the assorted house cured meats and cheeses I surprised myself by opting instead for two vegetarian sandwiches (trying just one was not an option)! My picks? Fresh goat cheese, pickled beets, walnut pesto, and arugula on a baguette;  and roasted mushrooms, leeks, sherry, fresh herbs, mozzarella, and piquillo peppers between grilled slices of sour dough. The sandwiches each came with house made kettle chips and I rounded the meal out with a smattering of the daily sides and lemonade. Don't like the options listed? Create your own sandwich from a lengthy list of options. The meal was as delightfully  alluring as the interior: church pews, birch logs and tile walls color-coded to the bark (a calming palette of blues, beiges and grey). Need more convincing?

Birchwood Kitchen is my new favorite restaurant in town ... which is saying a lot coming from a girl who has lived here her entire life!

Aside from the Blue sandwich, which had become an instant favorite immediately after my first trip there, their new burgers are out of this world delicious!!! In my 20s I went years without eating red meat, and had I known about the Birchwood burgers then I surely would have ended my deprivation act instantly!!! That's just how good they are! And don't even get me started on their soups and baked goods. Too good for words (I highly recommend the lemon bars and any of the cookies and scones)! And did I mention the fact that this place is BYOB and has an awesome back patio? What more can a girl ask for? While the prices are slightly higher than your typical sandwich joint (e.g., Potbelly's), in this horrible economy, when all you want is some good, fresh, homemade food to soothe your woes, Birchwood is the perfect answer. All of their food has that great seasonal, well-thought-out quality that a number of higher end restaurants in the city have achieved (e.g., Lula Cafe), but with a much lower price point. So forget Blackbird and Bristol ... Birchwood is right up this cheap foodie's alley!!!",0.9429,0.826,0.127,0.047,0.6052287916761601

It's sort of like Pastoral in that it has inspired sandwiches featuring the freshest and most high-quality ingredients.

I also love the quiches, they are light on egg and heavy on delicious roasted vegetables instead. Definitely ask about the daily specials in the front case. They always have some fresh fruit salad, a great side (like a German potato salad), and an original lemonade and/or iced tea option.  Their coffee and espresso (Metropolis beans) are also top notch, so I will occasionally just stop in for coffee. There is no pressure about ordering lunch or whatever.  The back patio is indeed lovely. And there are kitchen herbs in all the planters so in case you need a little more rosemary on your roasted potatoes... just pick some!  I have to say all the staff are exceptionally sweet, definitely not too fussy or gourmet.

So we sat in the back because it was not nice enough out to go outside. However, it's BYOB, so we popped bottles of champagne and got to work eating! I had the grilled Gruyere sandwich with ham and it was delicious. It was a nice size, and very filling. The ham was stacked high, which was good since at 2 dollars extra, it felt nice to get my dollars worth. And it was so good that I didn't mind sharing! My roommate got the mushroom sandwich, which she said was awesome, especially because of the piquillo peppers! I tried it and also thought it was delicious. One of our coworkers got the lamb and talked to the people who worked there about it. They told him that they marinate the lamb in Piece's IPA! Which is good for anyone who really likes Piece's IPA/IPA in general. I saw the sandwich but didn't try it, but you could tell that the lamb was the correct color, not too rare on the inside. One of my other friends wanted to try to the sandwich, and ended up taking more than one bite. I feel as if this is what I will be getting the next time that I am there. I also got the marinated olives, which were good but there were so many that I thought I was going to have a salt overload, or at least turn into a deer and go find a salt lick. My roommate got the pineapple jalapeno coleslaw, which was super delicious, and I don't even really like coleslaw. Another co-worker/friend got the watermelon salad, which he also enjoyed, although was disappointed by the small size. What really needs to be mentioned here is the service. It's wonderful. Even though it's table service, they still treat you as if they are going to your table and serving you. Multiple times throughout the meal, one or more of the workers would come and ask how we were enjoying our food, which showed that they actually cared if we were liking it or not.

The servers were friendly, but uncomfortable - as if I might suddenly catch them doing some restaurant no-no in the corner. I think this place would work best if it relaxed a bit and let its food speak for itself. For example, while its cute to bring me my potato chips in a white paper lunch sack, its not really necessary and ultimately just makes me question who had the poor job of cutting the tops off of all those paper lunch bags. Not to mention the doubts this raises about how carefully Birchwood has considered its commitment to sustainability. As for the food, the sandwich I had was definitely above average. And at $8.25 for a goat cheese sandwich, I think it should be. I also had a delicious glass of cucumber-cardamom lemonade, a perfect compliment to a summer lunch. The place itself is cute and tasteful, a comfortable place to sit and enjoy a meal. The back patio also seems like a great place to enjoy the warm summer weather.

2009-05-10,4.0,"We went to Birchwood today for brunch, and had a really nice experience!  The waitstaff is over-the-top friendly, but in a really genuine way.  I think the restaurant is new, and they are just excited to be up and running.  The decor is adorable...exposed brick and local photography on the walls.  And the way it's run is simple but charming.  You get a table when you walk in, and then when ready to order, you head to the counter to place it and pay.  It just so happens that we were a party of three waiting on our fourth, so we sat down to peruse the menu while we waited.  It turned out that our fourth was going to be quite a while, but no one pressured us to do anything at all except sit and enjoy the lovely atmosphere.  My other two companions got coffees while we waited, and as soon as their cups were half drunk, there was a server by to refill.  As I said, their enthusiasm was borderline over-the-top!   After perusing the menu for quite a long time, we finally decided and went up to order.  My sister and I got sucked in to the baked goods behind the counter, and ordered a piece of chocolate chip banana bread and an oatmeal butterscotch cookie as snacks before our meals arrived.  Kind of fat kid, but whatever.  Both were delicious as expected.  At our table, we had the following dishes: Goat Cheese Sandwich, Lamb Sausage Quiche and mixed greens, Breakfast Sandwich with Veggie Frittata, Bacon, and Cheese, and Polenta with Sunny Side up eggs and some other delicious garnishes.  Everything was amazing.  Personally, the quiche and the breakfast sandwich were my favorites, but the other two items were also very nice.  The sandwich had this walnut pesto that was out of control tasty, and the polenta was also fab.  Ooh, I almost forgot that somewhere in the mix were breakfast potatoes, which get a special shout-out because they were just. right.  The portions are not too big and not to small, and the prices are reasonable.  We all left full and happy, but not overstuffed.  I think all factors considered, this is a darling little spot which is sure to give Bongo a run for its money.  The fact that it's a smidge west of Damen, paired with the relative newness, is probably what keeps the crowds down thus far.  We will definitely be back to try the other delicious-sounding items on the menu!",0.9975,0.791,0.179,0.03,0.5344200937950938

The white bean soup that C.R. and I started off with was delicious. We both ended up getting their Roast Beef sandwich. The sandwich was presented beautifully and was made with a top of the line, thinly sliced roast beef that was covered with Dijon mustard. The Sandwich comes with a small bag to home made potato chips. I was quite impressed with the food and presentation.   The only thing that wasn't perfect was the price. Two soup and Sandwiches ended up being $30.00. That's a bit pricey for my book. But that would not stop me from ever going back.

YUM. I didn't dare taste the sick boyfriend's stuff, but he praised the turkey club and tomato bisque soup so highly that I was almost willing to risk infection to grab a bite.  However, I was so enamored with my mozzarella salad (involving mozzarella and some other kind of cheese--excessive, but delicious) that it didn't really matter.  I've thought about that salad fondly every day since I've been there..  house-made cheese, greens, vinaigrette, and roasted tomatoes.  Drool.   When I stopped by, I was almost tempted to ditch the sickly boyfriend and sit down for brunch by myself instead..  next time.",0.8559,0.819,0.114,0.067,0.6289402427637723

We came here for lunch and it wasn't very busy before we got there.  It got extremely busy right after us, and maybe that made them anxious because it seemed like we waited a long time for our sandwiches.  When they finally came, it seemed kind of thrown together.  Reasons: I had the special, which was pulled turkey and coleslaw.  It was supposed to be served with chips, which they forgot.  Other than that, it was really good.  The slaw had some arugula in it and the sauce had just the right kick.   My special friend had the speck and it says there was supposed to be truffle oil.  We've both had it (and used in our own cooking) enough to know that there was absolutely no truffle oil on the sandwich.  It would've probably made it a pretty near perfect creation.   The coffee and service were great and the brunch menu looks good too, so I'll probably give it another shot in a few weeks once they've ironed everything out.",0.9922,0.76,0.214,0.026,0.6143167701863355

2009-04-24,4.0,"I tried this place the other night when I was charged with bringing home dinner for my sick husband. I wandered in around 6:30 and placed my order for one cold sandwich and one hot sandwich. The guy working the counter was super friendly and nice, and not in that creepy way. He told me that my hot sandwich should take about ten minutes, asking if that was okay, and put in the order once I agreed that it wasn't a problem.  First, let me give the big thumbs up to the delicious sandwiches I ended up with that night. I had the turkey club, which was amazing. I was initially a bit bummed that the sandwich had tomato jam instead of sliced tomato, because I am nothing, if not a whore for a good tomato. But, let me tell you, the jam that was on there was, well, THE JAM. Highly recommended! My husband had the Blue, which he really liked, aside from the inclusion of onions on it, which I'd specifically asked to be omitted. Not a big deal, though, he just took them off and plowed on through the sandwich. The only issue I had was that the hot sandwich did not take ten minutes, but nearly thirty minutes. It's a new place, though, and I expect some hiccups, so it won't  keep me from going back.The guy at the counter was super apologetic about it, so whatever. Just mentioning it to make those who are looking to grab a quick sandwich aware that they should avoid ordering a hot sandwich if they're in a rush. I'd agree that the sandwiches aren't cheap, but for the quality of the ingredients, it didn't bother me. I'll be glad to have a nice alternative to Goddess and Grocer on nights I want to pick up a tasty sandwich on the way home from work. Also psyched to try their brunch sometime. Hopefully they'll work out some of the kinks with regard to the timing. I'll be back to check that out.",0.9851,0.844,0.128,0.028,0.5806869111280876
2009-04-22,5.0,"Great food. Good value. Good service. I had the mushroom sandwich, which was very balanced. I even took it home--which can be tricky with a grilled sandwich which has cheese on it. Was not greasy at all, and the flavors were very fresh. You can also create your own sandwich, but I decided to leave it to the professionals. Also, while I was waiting for my food, they brought me a cup of the tomato soup to try. It was as good as everything else I had there. I also got a side of mint chickpea salad, which was very refreshing and well seasoned. For dessert, I got a lemon bar. Their desserts are made by a pastry artist from Evanston, I believe, and it was really, really good. I'll definitely be back--whether it's on my way home to grab a cookie, or to stop for a whole meal.

2009-04-19,4.0,"I'm going to give Birchwood a solid ""B"". Pros: the food was amazing -- I had the grilled gruyere sandwich and my boyfriend had the polenta -- and beautifully presented, they had no problem substituting chips for greens, the staff was extremely friendly and kind, and the vibe of the place was very neat. Cons: it was about 20% more expensive than it should have been, their vegetarian selection was so-so, and it was odd to have the line of people waiting to order snaking directly behind my seat. When I say their vegetarian selection is ""so-so,"" I particularly mean their breakfast selection. They have polenta and a waffle and... that's it. Now, for the rest of their grilled cheese sandwiches, the sandwiches are a base price, then you add $1-3 to get some meat in it. Their breakfasts, on the other hand, just come with the meat already on them. I certainly would have ordered the breakfast sandwich, had I not felt like I would have been paying for something I wouldn't eat. Yes, I could have asked if I could get the sandwich without bacon, but to add ""oh and can you make it like $1 less?"" after ordering it sans bacon would make me feel like a total goober. Note to Birchwood: if you can make your breakfast sandwich and salad $2 less, then charge an extra $2 to add in the meat, I and my vegematarian friends will be there a whole lot more often.",0.797,0.864,0.082,0.054,0.5183630952380952

The staff was still full of enthusiasm and attentiveness. Not only is there a great deal of concern that goes into their service, but also into the final product. We now have yet another business that shares an interest in community success and the local good. It made me smile to see an empty Growler of beer, from Piece, setting on their racks. Whether or not they're BYOB, I don't know, so you might want to bring a flask or an opaque water bottle. The outdoor patio, though currently empty, looks plenty promising for summertime lunch fun.  Up next, will have have to be the brunch menu. It's short and sweet. I can't say that I've tried a breakfast salad or lamb sausage patties, but that will shortly change.
