We sat at the bar - my boyfriend had two whiskey/bourbon cocktails which he loved (their sazerac which on special and the Daydream About It which tasted like a really fancy whiskey sour). I had the Psycho Friend (tequila, zucca rhubarb and other deliciousness) and the In 10 Cities (basil infused vodka, watermelon, citrus mixers, etc) and both were some of the best cocktails I've ever had! The bartender clearly had invented/helped invent these drinks and enjoyed discussing them with us :) We had a great experience! 10/10 would go back!",0.9878,0.747,0.253,0.0,0.5522893772893773

2016-07-02,1.0,"We were seated and then utterly ignored for at least 20 minutes. In a very friendly manner, I addressed the gentleman who finally saw fit to pour us some water and he literally did not say a word. He poured, turned, and walked away. The appetizer was forgettable crap you could find at any Chilli's or TGI Fridays. My entree, the gumbo, was the most soulless, bland, bloodless excuse for cajun cuisine I have ever experienced. And no amount of salt or what passed for hot sauce there could fix it. My girlfriend's meal, the etouffee, was good, but much too small to share. She had two rum and Cokes and I had two Miller High Lifes and we were out of there for just under $80 including a bare minimum tip our server did not deserve. Eighty dollars for one decent meal and a few drinks. This place seemed emblematic of the Logan Square, too-cool-for-school zeitgeist which suggests that if you are dining in this hipster nirvana on precious tid-bits dwarfed by the plates  they arrive on, served by under-dressed young pukes of indeterminate gender you must be having a good time. When the check arrived, suddenly we were the center of attention. Multiple waitstaff bustling around our table hurriedly fetching our credit card and returning quickly for the signature.

2016-07-01,1.0,"What is wrong with you people?!!!  God, sometimes I hate Yelp and how it can lure you to the most worthless places. I feel like personally going to the house of every Yelper on here that gave this place 4+ stars and demanding my money back. I'm afraid that they probably aren't real people but monkeys being paid by the restaurant to write good reviews. If they are actual human beings, I'm afraid what our species has become. First, it took 20 minutes just to get water at this place. WATER. You know, the liquid that people need to live. And it was dropped off in the most unceremonious way as possible. The worst part was that all the servers there were dressed in some ""nouveau bum"" fashion so we couldn't tell who was a waiter vs. who was eating there vs. who was an actual homeless person. It took another 10 minutes just to put in a drink order by some poor person who was dropping off our silverware. When our waiter finally arrived, we put in both our appetizer and entree order knowing we may never have another opportunity.  Our appetizer was the Pimento Cheese and Pickles which looked like something your drunk roommate would grab out of the fridge at 3am. It made no sense. Cheese with cayenne pepper sprinkled on it laid across some random pickles, jalapenos, and over-toasted bread. My 5-yr old niece has composed more coherent dishes. Over an hour passed before we got our food. My poor boyfriend ordered the gumbo and got a bowl of bland dark sauce with a piece of fried chicken sitting at the side. It was inedible. After asking for salt and hot sauce (and waiting another 20 mins), he was barely able to choke down his meal. I ordered the Crawfish Etouffe and was lucky in the fact it wasn't a complete catastrophe. The best part came when we asked for our check. Suddenly, every waiter that worked there was performing a chorus line of Be My Guest from Beauty and the Beast. They did leg kicks, took our credit card, performed dance numbers, and were so attentive it was embarrassing. It was strange how focused they were in collecting our money versus actually trying to serve us food and life-giving water. If you want a good Cajun meal, there are so many better places.

I got the BBQ shrimp and grits and they were BY FAR the best I have ever had. The sauce was smokey and sweet at the same time and the grits were amazingly creamy and substantial in texture and flavor. My boyfriend got the crawfish roll and the chocolate chip French toast and while neither compared to the shrimp and grits, both were delectable.

They saved me one biscuit (how thoughtful) so that was a pretty good start when I finally got there. I  ordered the Flight Risk to drink, which is a bourbon based cocktail. It was really good, albeit a little small. The giant block of ice in the drink took up a ton of space so there wasn't a lot of liquid.  For entrees I ordered the red rice and beans, while some of the other guys got the chicken sandwich, shrimp poboys and the gumbo. Our food came in like 5 minutes, which blew me away. Crazy fast! Mine dish was really good. It's served in a cast iron dish and the rice and sausage sit on top of the beans. Not a huge dish for $15, but definitely well made and quite tasty. Seems like everyone's food was good judging by how fast we cleared the table. Analogue is a great place to grab some cocktails and Cajun food in Logan Square.

Despite it being overpriced, highly recommended! The fries had cajun seasoning and were pretty average for my tastes. Most of us got the Fried Chicken Sandwich and it was heaven. Buttery bread, fried chicken, tangy coleslaw and pickle. Simple and delicious!

They are good biscuits, but not life-changing. The butter and spicy jam are delicious though. $23 for crawfish étouffée: skip it. It was I'd say a 6 on the scale of 1-10, and in the world of cajun food your gumbo and étouffée pretty much represent your entire philosophy. The portion was also tiny, for being $23 at least! The po boys are a much better value, and were very good. The bread pudding here is FANTASTIC. It was what made the different between 3 and 4 stars. Apparently they also have great drinks, but we kept it calm for once. The service was very good and consistent with the prices-if only the food was! If you want great cajun, go to Heaven on Seven (if there are any still in business), and if you want seafood, go to Angry Crab.

We came in on a busy Saturday for dinner, and the service was naturally rather slow. It took our server almost ten minutes to get our drink orders, and another 10/15 for those drinks to arrive at the table. We had the rabbit boucherie, the gumbo, and the catfish deville. We honestly thought the gumbo would be the highlight, but it was a little off in taste. It had that slightly bitter flavor and overly gummy texture that an overuse of flour as a thickening agent often causes. Their house hot sauce all but made up for this though! And it's a must that you save room for the chocolate bread pudding! It's silky, salty, sweet -- and the candied pecans add a great crunch to the already amazing dessert.

Cons: I had reserved a table through Yelp's reservation service at least 24 hours before, and the restaurant had no record of it (even though I had plenty of proof in the form of e-mails and mobile notifications from Yelp). They did not care and were actually pretty snotty about seating us at one of the many empty tables (though they were sure to give us the wobbly one right by the door, and they told us we had to be gone in an hour or less). Several other tables were empty the whole time. The server was very distracted and kept forgetting stuff, though she did seem genuinely nice and not as too-cool-for-school as everyone else there.

And among 3 of us, we ordered 6 drinks, none of it which seemed to interest me. So, on to the food now, we had ordered Jambalaya and Chicken sandwich. I was disappointed in both dishes. I felt like the food was made with so much butter that the Jambalaya tasted nothing like how it is supposed to taste. I probably had 2 spoons and I moved on to the sandwich.

Our waitress took our drink orders before answering our questions about the menu. I ordered the The More You Learn (with Vida Mezcal, Sherry, Lemon, Blackberry, Angostura), which was tasty and fairly strong. My other friends ordered the Hurricane and the Shadow of a Doubt. Maybe she had ordered a drink that was a little off, but Shadow of a Doubt tasted of soap and after that first sip, my friend left the rest of the drink untouched.  For food, I got the catfish po boy with dirty rice. The sandwich was huge and tasty. The catfish was lightly breaded with cornmeal and was seasoned nicely. The dirty rice was absolutely delicious. However, portion size for the rice was tiny. I was expecting something a little more than a couple of bites for $7. My other friends had also ordered the po boy with fries and the jumbalaya. The jumbalaya was just okay (it was definitely more like a paella), and they all agreed that the fried chicken wing was the best part.  I have mixed feelings about Analogue. I feel as though their menu is largely hit-or-miss. With jumbalaya being charged at $23, it should have been amazing, but instead was just mediocre.

The menu is helpful, with fun emoticons to let you know what to expect when you order a drink. The wait staff has always been great every time I've come here, and this time was no exception. I bought the fried chicken sandwich for my dinner, as I just read it was one of the best fried chicken dishes in the city, and I have to say that I agree. The breading was great, just the right enough, not too thin and not too thick. The chicken was absolutely succulent, wonderfully juicy, and overall, a top notch experience, especially for me to rave so much over just a sandwich. That said... the food is pretty expensive for small portions (at least by American, and especially Chicago, standards). My brother got the Chicken and Dumplings, and it was also small. He said it was delicious, but I didn't sample. Overall, I do recommend this place for food if you're ok with shelling out some money.

I love spicy and this was just right. My only complaint was the portion size. In New Orleans, I had a dish twice the size of this for $12.

To me that is poor planning in the kitchen and forcing people to chose items they may not really want.  Last issue on the visit, the bar...how is it acceptable to take the toppers for the bloody mary out of containers with bare hands?  We were sitting at the bar and the bartender was touching money, his glasses wiping his hands on his clothes etc.  On the positive side bartender was very friendly. Take away: -Not much variety and limited availability menu -Cleanliness, not very sanitary More than likely not returning.  Disappointing since this is in my neighborhood.",0.6177,0.865,0.077,0.058,0.38973570289359766
2016-01-26,4.0,"Hey, Everyone! Mel here. Coming to you live from Analogue; a delightfully hip, cozy, and surprisingly romantic candle-lit Cajun kitchen and cocktail bar in Logan Square.  I have to admit, this is my very first Yelp review and I'm so excited to share my amazing experience here with you guys! Upon arrival, my guest and I nearly drove right past without noticing the dimly lit, almost hidden gem. It is directly next door to ""The Owl"" which has a much more vibrant and noticeable sign.  Once inside, we felt immediately warmed and welcomed. A brick wall takes up the back most wall which adds a modern, homey feel.  Mason jars with real flame burning candles inside sit atop the tables and the lighting is turned down low in accordance. Automatic perfect date spot.  We chose to sit at one of the high tops by the window which was just perfect. Our waitress (who was pleasant but never introduced herself by name) came right up and took our drink orders. The cocktail list is TO DIE and I had a very hard time making a decision because I wanted them all! I ended up going with the ""Green River No-Groni"" which consisted of gin, lemon, Campari, watermelon and egg whites.  I could literally drink one million of these. My guest went with a classic Louisiana Sazerac. Perfect.  Now let's cut to the food. Right off the bat we ordered a basket of seasoned fries that came with a side of spicy aioli. YUMMO! After that we ordered the Catfish Deville which is essentially catfish fish sticks and served with a BOMB tartar sauce. Finally, the Blackened Fish Dip; a generous portion of fish dip served with LA hot sauce and saltine crackers.  So, you guys, OMG as I'm sitting here writing this review my guest and I were waiting for our server to come back so we could order more drinks.  Literally unseen for like 20 mins.  JUST NOW I saw her walk out the front door with her coat, scarf, and purse on obviously leaving for the evening. Never came to tell us she was leaving never asked if we would like our bill or anything. Just disappeared and casually left. So we had to get up and order our drinks from the bartender. Ew. Whatever. It was annoying but it does not subtract from the amazing atmosphere and quality of food and drink and this laid back and humble abode. Still an amazing experience regardless and I will absolutely be back with bells on!!!",0.9797,0.823,0.124,0.052,0.5027451499118166

The fish dip appetizer was amazing even on saltines, and my girlfriends blackened catfish sandwich was great too. The dirty rice as a side was also pretty spicy and amazing.

They accidentally had given our drinks to another table and were prompt to fix the situation and were very good in handling the situation. Our waitress was very kind and attentive! The sandwiches were both delicious. The fried chicken sandwich had homemade slaw and pickles on delicious buttered bread. The blackened fish had a kick to it and was very tender and flavorful.

Surprisingly just what I wanted, without knowing I wanted it.  A bit of dark beer, shot of liquor (neither of which I typically drink alone) and a few more ingredients frothed up to something a bit sweet, a bit dark and entirely delicious!  It's a bit pricey but I think worth the cost to sample a bit of New Orleans in Chicago.",0.9921,0.763,0.223,0.014,0.6357762926728444

The head ""Doge"" chose this place and I was surprised I had never heard of it before. It wasn't too far away from my home and I have been to all the other bars on this part of Milwaukee. Don't know how I missed this place before, but never again will I pass by! This place is awesome!  Since many do not give them praise first, I got to give it up to the staff of the Analogue. First, they ""welcomed us"" with our name on their sign, They also put us in our own private back room that was brighter and allowed us to converse. We also had at least three servers which made the whole meal even more pleasant.  We preordered some appetizers and they were all delicious. The best was actually the fish dip which was tasty and well liked by this usual non fish eater! The only downside (though not big) was the Pepper Jelly with the Biscuits. It seemed too vinegar-y. Oh well, the butter was good! We also got the fried catfish fingers which was delicious for this (again) not big fish eater. We also got the pimento cheese plate which tasted as good as I thought it would. It was good, but nothing too mind shattering. Still, sometimes you just need some cheese!  My table (of 8) also ordered different drinks so we rotated and tasted through the row. Mine seemed to be a clear winner (Over my head), but I really liked End of Days and the Hurricane. Either way, all the drinks were super good! They know their stuff.  For dinner, I got the Red Beans and Rice. I wished there was a little more rice, but it was the best Red Beans and Rice I have ever had outside of New Orleans. I tried my friend's Jambalaya and it was outstanding too! There were simply too many things on the menu that I wanted to try. The BBQ shrimp looked legit as well.  We got the Chocolate Chip Bread Pudding and it was one of the best desserts I have had all year.  I am actually a bit surprised how good the food was! I have been to New Orleans and this could have easily been a place on Bourbon Street. In fact, it was better than some of the places on Bourbon Street.

I loved the neighborhood and restaurants and shops in it so much - to this day it is still my favorite Chicago neighborhood so far (prove me wrong, Pilsen!) I would come here every so often on weekends. The entrance is not very visible, which I think gives it a sort of speakeasy charm to it. From what I'm told by the waiter on my first visit, the owner was one of the many displaced NOLA residents after Katrina. He opened noticed there wasn't really any Cajun cuisine in Chicago and opened up shop. And we are so grateful he did! The biscuits and jam is a MUST. That honey butter that goes along with it is just heavenly! My favorite thing to get on the cocktail menu has to be ANY of the bitters.

After some extensive research into Chicago's Cajun food options I settled on Analogue for my boyfriend's birthday. We came in this past Friday the host graciously offered us our pick of the litter in terms of seats and we chose a cozy table for two near the front bar. The ambiance at Analogue is dark, quiet and even a little romantic, it ended up being a really great spot to celebrate a birthday.  The menu here has so many great options it was pretty difficult to narrow down what we were interested in getting so we opted to order a couple of drinks and the biscuits while we perused the menu. He went with a beer and I went with the Watermelon Hurricane. I loved my drink but wished it had been a bit bigger. The biscuits came out right away and were simply outstanding, they truly melted in your mouth! The pepper jelly accompaniment also really stood out and gave the biscuits just the right amount of heat.  We ended up settling on the Crispy Corn, Jambalaya, Catfish Sandwich, and French Fries. We asked our waiter to time everything coming out so we could properly enjoy the each dish and the kitchen did an excellent job with the timing and order of each dish. Out first was the Crispy Corn, as a corn lover I have to say this was some of the best corn on the cob I've EVER had. The flavor combination was blew me away and I don't know if I've ever had an ear that was so perfectly crisped.  Next up was the Jambalaya which is quite possibly my boyfriend's favorite food so the expectations at our table were pretty high. However, once again Analogue did not disappoint. A mountain of melt in your mouth rice and pulled chicken was topped with a perfectly fried piece of chicken. I will also say they give you quite a healthy portion and that this is a must order item if you are a Jambalaya fan.  Last but definitely not least they brought out our Catfish Sandwich and Fries. Despite this being our last course we could not help indulging in the huge batch of perfectly seasoned french fries and aioli, I literally told the waiter that they need to bottle and sell whatever they season those fries with. The catfish was another stand out item and I was happy that it was not deep fried and instead delicately seasoned and grilled and then served on a fresh, delicious bun.  The only downside to this meal for me was that the drink service at Analogue was WAY too slow for my liking. Our waiter could've gotten at least another round of drinks out of our table if he'd checked in more frequently and served us more quickly.

Don't get me wrong; the food is amazing. The seasoning and flavor were perfect. We had the house green salad: very simple. The leafs were HUGES and nicely dressed with the Dijon vin. My girlfriend fucking loved it. We also ordered the char corn dish. So much flavor, I recommend sucking the cobs for all that flavor. Then we had the sm gumbo. The only thing small was the portion cause the spice and flava was explosive. Then the catfish sandwich... Oh man it can get messy but that good kinda messy. Heavy flavor but still light in the tummy. As for drinks, go with the ""no regrets"" it truely lives up to its  name. I loved this place.

I love their cocktails, especially how they describe them on the menu in terms of tastes (little emoticons are used to denote ""smoky,"" ""refreshing,"" ""fruity,"" etc.) because they are SO spot on. The basket of biscuits is to die for - they are just perfect, as are the sweet butter and pepper jam with a little kick that accompanies them. As a vegetarian, I do feel a little limited with the menu, but the mushroom debris po boy is solid. It has both mushrooms and french fries in the sandwich, but they're covered with a gravy which makes eating it a little messy. Still tasty though! Boyfriend has tried their fried chicken sandwich and considering there was absolutely none left on this plate, I'd say he enjoyed it.

Drink wise, I was very impressed and want to go back for a few things.  I tasted two of their sweeter drinks, and two of their boozier drinks.  On the sweeter side there was the Guidance Counselor.  Think alcoholic strawberry lemonade with a touch of smokiness from the Mezcal. Very well balanced and tasty.   The Various Posistions was just off sweet and had a nice fizz from the sparkling wine. The R.I.P.  Bad Times follows the method that gets you a Manhattan-esque cocktail.  Very boozy with a very full and slightly bitter mouthfeel.  It's definitely a grown up drink.  The Tidal Wave strikes itself in the middle of all the other drinks being just off of the sweet side and hitting you with the strength of the Jamaican Rum. Oh before I forget, there is one more thing to hate here.   The music selection.  It is completely odd. It's very much like a weird cross between elevator and video game music.  I guess they were going for a futuristic vibe that just kinda fell flat for me.",0.8596,0.755,0.134,0.111,0.5300208333333333

If you can move past the purposefully minimalist décor, oddly dressed hipsters, potential beard hair in my cocktail, and odd vibes surrounding this joint, you'll find yourselves some delicious cocktails and truly authentic Cajun delights!   Came here on a Gilt City voucher. I tried a few times without a reservation, but it was always too crowded; the word is obviously out, people! As someone who isn't patient, I simply went elsewhere when it was crowded. During the week, I finally got a group reservation and got to eat/drink. The biscuit starter is quote possibly the most fresh, delicious, and original take on a simple biscuits in a basket I've ever seen. The butter was obviously home churned/seasoned, and the habanero jelly was an unexpected surprise for a spicy food fan like me. Fish dip was also fresh and tasty, although we would have preferred some hot bread instead of just saltine crackers. As for my entrée, the crawfish entoufee, I couldn't have asked for a better prepared dish like this outside of Louisiana. Outside of Antoine's in the French Quarter, I have not tasted a better entoufee! Special props to Analogue for deshelling the fish. Can usually be a messy pain in my ass!  As for the cocktails, I had a delicious tiki style cocktail, as well as a frozen hurricane. While the frozen hurricane didn't taste like one form Patty O's in Nola, it had it's own special charm and was refreshing on a hot, humid summer night.

2015-05-20,3.0,"I've been wanting to try Analogue's Tuesday $13 chicken dinner special for ages and I finally made it in last night. Maybe my quest to find that elusive, best fried chicken in Chicago led me to have too high of expectations, but I have to admit, I was disappointed in the plate overall.  The chicken was juicy, with breading that was well-seasoned and crispy, and the portion was very generous.  It did not disappoint, but those sides sure did. The plate comes with a biscuit, mashed potatoes and gravy, dirty rice, and coleslaw.  The biscuit was light and buttery, but came with no spread.  As I always say, the more butter, the better! Alas, my server was far away and I didn't want my biscuit to get cold, so I went without. The dirty rice and mashed potatoes servings were meager, a small dollop of each, and unfortunately, both arrived at the table cold. Can't get worse than cold rice and mashed potatoes!  The standout was my server's drink recommendation - a smoky, mezcal-based drink with lime juice and fancy cherry syrup. It was smoky, refreshing, and a unique twist on a ""margarita""-like flavor. The cocktail guide at the bottom of the drink menu also made me smile - for all the times you've been somewhere and felt helpless looking at a menu of all the drink ingredients you don't know and just wanted something ""refreshing"" ""smoky"" or ""bitter,"" Analogue has you covered!

It tasted more like pot roast to me, it wasn't my favorite but it wasn't awful either. The drinks were also good, but I wish they had Abita. Service wise, the bartenders were super quick even tho they were swamped and because our reservation was delayed we were comped two free drinks.

2015-02-21,4.0,"My friend wanted to get Cajun food in honor of fat Tuesday being this week and I thought it was an excellent idea. Now ill be honest, the only reason I came across this place on yelp is because the only remaining Heaven on Seven location is now only open for lunch (so sad) and I was craving some shrimp and grits with gumbo. Anywho, I found this place, had good reviews AND they take reservations. I feel like most places in Logan square don't take ressies so that was awesome.  We arrived, they were super busy and we ended up waiting 20 minutes for our table. The nice host of the restaurant offered us a round of free drinks due to the wait which was super nice. The drinks were good. I wish they had Abita though :( My friend and I ordered the biscuits (omg amazing you have to order!) to share and I got the gumbo as my main entree. Gumbo was salty but the more I ate the better it was. They had potato salad in the gumbo as the carb but I prefer rice. That gumbo would have been better if it had rice with it, in my humble opinion.  Anyway, I enjoyed my dinner and drinks. It was odd that they didn't have any grits on the menu but that's ok.

2015-02-01,4.0,"When I think of the word analogue in term of food, I think of things like seitan or soy burger.. something made from other ingredients to resemble something else. I'm not really sure why this restaurant calls themselves Analogue as their foods were pretty straightforward I thought. I pondered about that awhile.  I was so looking forward to eat here due to two reasons: a) it was my friend Tina's big bday. b) She picked the place and she usually has a very good taste. She didn't disappoint this time either. She had raved about the fried chicken sliders in her invite and I had that in mind for a couple of weeks. We apparently love her as though Chicago was buried in two feet of snow and the snow was still falling steadily at the time of the brunch, all the invitees made it there. We all braved it to Logan Square to make sure Tina had a great birthday. From the outside, it looked abandoned and dumpy. I was kinda surprised to see it in that condition. Maybe this was one of the analogue parts, as they made it seem like it was nothing. It didn't quite had the same effect as Alinea or Grace though. The inside was much better than the outside. It was small but it wasn't at all dumpy. It was rather hipsterish. We had cool people waiting on us. It was kinda oh.. I should be waiting on you instead..let's switch role. We were a little late because of the snow. The table already started with some beignets with caramel sauce and biscuits with jam and steen butter. I didn't know what was steen butter but it tasted like peanut butter but also caramel. I guess steen is some type of syrup. It was rather confusing. It reminded me of a game I played at a baby shower smelling diapers laced with smushed candy bars to resemble baby's poop. I knew it was a familiar candy bar after smelling it but smushed candy bar all smelled like peanut butter or caramel. I can't quite guess it. Was it Twix, Snickers, Reese's? Might as well be steen butter. The jam was surprising. It looked and tasted like jam but then it got spicy. It was very unexpected but good!! This could also be some evidence of the analogue theme. The beignets were pretty delicious too and was great with the caramel sauce. The color was a bit dark like it was over fried but it was just caramelization. However, it didn't make them the prettiest beignets. I had to order the sliders. It was some great spicy tenders mixed with the tastiest fresh pickle ever and sausage gravy, in between the same biscuit we sampled earlier. Scrumptious! It kicked Chic-fil-a's spicy chicken sandwich's ass, if that even possible. But it was possible especially since Chic-fil-a closed on Sunday. Half of the table had the same idea, brainwashed from the invitation and ordered the sliders. We also were able to sample some other items that the other half ordered. Clearly that half consists of more creative and open minded people. The menu was small and like I said, was pretty straightforward. Other than the sliders, there were also shrimps and grits, B.E.A.T sandwich, ham hock hash, and Arugula salad with corn meal crusted fried oysters. The fried oyster with arugula salad was awesome! I started with a bite of that actually before I devoured the sliders. It was very very delicious. The Bacon, Egg, Arugula, and Tomato sandwich looked great also. It had Nueske's bacon.. Can't beat that! The fries were pretty awesome. It was fresh, crispy, and just yummy for simple deep fried potatoes. The shrimps and grits were just okay. I had this out of this world shrimps and grits at Naha and Chef Carrie Nahabedian still has the gold medal for shrimps and grits for me. Haven't found a better one as of yet.  Oh.. Their orange juice was fresh squeezed and damn it was good for OJ. Mix that with some champagne, and I swear it was one of the best Mimosas ever. The coffee was so strong and dark. I suspected it was chicory coffee. It was fantastic! The other surprise was that the bday girl paid for everything. She said she's doing it Asian style. Yeah, in Asia, you treat when you're doing the inviting. You can't really invite people and expect them to pay for their own meal. We all definitely had the intention to treat her but she was sneaky and paid first. Thanks, Tina! Luckily, we brought her a very nice gift.  The service was fair but I must say the portion was rather small except for the sliders. If you ate all three with biscuits and all, it should fill you up. If you ordered the arugula salad and fried oyster.. You'd be hungry in an hour. It almost should be an appetizer than an entree. This Cajun/Creole trendy eatery was pretty good. It is not a typical Louisiana style and definitely is not a Popeye's. However, the fried chicken sliders did rock. Would love to comeback and try some gumbo. My friend, though she was a few hundreds dollars poorer after this brunch, was all smiles. She sure didn't look a day older than 29 and glad we all could be there to share her big day.",0.9997,0.735,0.231,0.034,0.5630976926853217

When it came to ordering the mains we were met with the same kind of lack of service.  I asked if the shrimp was good and he said he didn't know.  Okaaaay....so I took a chance and my boyfriend got the jambalaya.  The shrimp is served with the full monty.  Not peel-your-own but head on/tail on.  That's fine for me!  Some might be freaked out by the heads whereas some love them.  I'm not that adventurous.  It also comes with bread.  The gravy it was in was great and there's a grilled lemon half in the middle of it.  My only complaint was that some of the shrimp were a little mushy.  My boyfriend thought his dinner was spicy but good. The cocktails were excellent.  My boyfriend had a hot drink and one made with stout beer.  They were great.  I had the Sonic Reducer twice.  It was so very good!!  I loved the cocktail menu with the emoticons.   We had to try the banana pudding dessert.  I love that and its rare to see it on a menu.  This time our server was a little helpful and confirmed that it was the one to get.  It was served in a glass and was just the right amount.  The pudding was excellent.  You can tell that it was made from scratch, with love.  A very comforting, nostalgic dessert. We will definitely be back for the food and the cocktails.  They were great.  And now that we know a little more it won't be as awkward.  I just wish there was a little more hand holding for the first time.  If anything had been so-so then the service would have been the deal breaker for us.  I'm ok with just about anything as long as the cocktails and food are great.  In this case its their saving grace.",0.9994,0.742,0.224,0.034,0.6301477411477413
2014-12-22,3.0,"I have to laugh at the disorganization we experienced here. You just get the impression that this place, characterized by a young, hip staff complete with beards, bow ties and pearl necklaces, is in denial about the reality of running a restaurant in a trendy neighborhood, and nobody is charged with controlling the inevitable chaos of weekend dining. My first experience here was great. A couple friends out for a nice quiet dinner on a weekday. Meaty salty spicy yum cajun food and a mixologist-curated array of exotic, tasty cocktails. So I had it in mind for a Saturday night birthday dinner. I reached out via their email system for reservations, and come dinnertime everything was ready and waiting for us. Grand. We, a party of six, received 5 entrees. These entrees were half-eaten by the time we had the opportunity to inquire about the arrival of the 6th, which had been ordered in good faith. Hm, I'll check on that for you.  Hm.  Later, a second round of drinks never comes. About 20 minutes into waiting, the waitress takes a new order from our friend who hadn't been quite ready to participate in the round. We all try to wait patiently because it's clearly a full house. Strangely, her order alone comes not long afterward. Hi, sorry, so, we're waiting on a round. Hm. I'll check on that for you. Let me just make sure I got your order right. What did you all order? Heh. Still we wait. We waited so long that nobody really wanted the drinks anymore, but there was nobody to convey that to because the waitress was nowhere to be seen. Interestingly, the same person that had to order his dinner twice was again forgotten when the round finally came. He told her to just forget it, and to her credit, she offered to buy it for him, and brought it out promptly. No other restitution was offered.  All told, we were there for about an extra hour. The explanation we got was that it was busy. That doesn't really explain how you didn't notice that one of the people at your table wasn't eating, and later that the whole table was dry. The exclamation, 'You have one job!' comes to mind. In any case, we unanimously agreed that it shouldn't be shocking to a restaurant that they would be busy on a Saturday night. Calculate how busy you could possibly be based on the quantity of seating, and then hire another guy. Hire two. We'd have been gone, freeing up the table for a whole new substantial check. We would definitely have gotten another round or two at the very least. Cassshhhhhh. Frankly, incompetent servers aside, I think the problem boils down to the exotic cocktails. As anybody who's ever gone to The Whistler can attest, the more sophisticated the drink the longer it takes to make, and more sober you are by the time you get your second, if even possible. To you, Analogue, and other organizationally-tormented but otherwise cool places, I propose a logical equation: For every cocktail on your drink menu that contains egg whites, reduce your patron capacity by 20%.

But for drinks, my quick review is that if you're in the mood for a beer, go to Rocking Horse next door, and if you're in the mood for cocktails, go to the Whistler. Analogue seems outclassed in both of these areas, and suffers from having less seating than either of these other options.  Analogue is a very under the radar spot - they didn't have any outdoor signage for a long time, and now they've put up a very stylized metal ""A"" that will still tell you nothing about what's inside if you don't already know.  What is inside? A very small venue with only a few seats and a bar, with very dark decor and dim lighting. Minimalist all the way. There is usually a doorman (who I have always found to be pleasant, along with the rest of the staff), and it has often been busy when I stopped in, which is partially because it has been on various ""hot spot"" lists in its first year open, and partially because it doesn't take a lot to make a 20 person capacity place look busy.  The music is your normal indie hipster, in that upbeat rock / dance / electronic zone where you find LCD Soundsystem, Hot Chip, et al. I've found it to be slightly too loud for having a conversation with your friend/date if you're sitting at a table, but maybe I'm just becoming a grouchy old man in my 30s.  As for cocktails and drafts, I would say that I've found them uneven. I have definitely enjoyed some of the things I've had here, but sometimes it seems like the selection is just a bit too narrow. Say there are 6 cocktails on the menu: it may happen that three will be rum based, one will be a sweet gin drink, there there will be two whiskey drinks, one of which is also sweet. As somebody who prefers a bolder flavor, I'm suddenly left with one drink to choose from. Which is not to say that the cocktails are always sweet: it has just been my experience that both cocktails and beers could be better ""curated.""",0.9776,0.886,0.088,0.026,0.44824786324786314

While Analogue looks and acts kind of like a restaurant, it turns out that in substance and service, the craft cocktails are the real action here and the cajun food is more of an accompaniment.  We had three excellent cocktails, all interesting, well-balanced, and not-too-sweet, just like our waitress promised (definitely get the ""Hang Ten,"" a combination of rum, passionfruit, lime, and hibiscus that was actually more bitter than sweet -- so good we ordered it twice).   The food was merely good.  Good enough that I won't nitpick it in detail, but not so good that I can point to any item and say it was worth a trip to Logan Square.  The food service definitely didn't match the high-standards of the cocktail service.  Our entrees came while the appetizers were only 60% done, turning the table into a traffic jam and forcing us to watch our gumbo get cold as we tried to scarf down our fish dip.  And they entirely forgot one of our items, too.   All in all, a happy experience, but I can't say it meets the high standards of Chicago, and I can't say with enthusiasm that you should make a trip here.",0.9931,0.783,0.19,0.026,0.5692324786324786

We got there around 7:30 and the restaurant was relatively slow, but by the time we left, it seemed full. Starting with the cocktails, two of us had negronis that had salted watermelon and egg white in it. It was really refreshing and light, yet not too sweet. Our other friend had the Dandy in the Underworld cocktail. It was also good, but definitely strong. It was boozy, sweet, and actually a little thicker than expected as well.

It was sweet yet spicy and went really well with the buttery biscuit. The Steen's cane syrup butter was delicious as well. For dinner, I had the shrimp maque choux, which was amazing. Although the shrimp was good in this dish, the cornbread and the sweet corn were the stars. I kept drenching my cornbread in the corn sauce to eat it all together. It was pretty obvious that I loved the dish when the waitress took my plate away. My friends had the fried chicken sandwich and the turkey jambalaya.

We're glad we finally got to this little gem that has been on my wife's list for quite a while. Your first thought approaching Analogue will be ""are we sure this is the right place?"" It is. There's no sign, just the address numbers over the door. It opens up into a narrow interior with a bar and row of tables. We started with a couple baskets of biscuits for the table. They were absolutely amazing. They came out hot and fluffy with a sweetened butter and pepper jelly on the side. These biscuits rank pretty high on my all-time list. And since they aren't huge, you don't feel so guilty about having a second. I got the chicken jambalaya, which was phenomenal. There was a good amount of spice to it, but just the right amount that still allowed the flavors of the rice, vegetables and chicken to shine through. The chicken in it was mostly dark meat (a good thing) and cooked up with a nice little crust on it -- the texture of the meat was reminiscent of duck confit. My wife ordered the fried chicken sandwich and loved it. The chicken had a nice crunchy crust and it was served on simple buttered toast. I'm not a huge fan of pickles and slaw, which come on this sandwich, but I still enjoyed the bite I stole. The slaw wasn't that nasty gloppy style, and the pickles weren't overwhelming. Everything balanced nicely. Our friends dining with us also got the chicken sandwich and the pork po' boy. I didn't try the po' boy, but it looked amazing and received high marks.

I find that people not into these kinds of drinks get frustrated at wait times, but this is a different game. That being said, I have never waited an inordinate amount of time for a drink and/or food, even when busy. Servers have been friendly and the door staff always work on getting us a table asap.

They have beer but I have only tried their Purls, which I've tried once and found it interesting. I've also had the Old fashioned shot multiple times and you should definitely try it when you're there. Food: I am a pesceatarian so have not had everything, but I have had the Smoked Fish Dip, Stuffed Mirliton, Fries and Bread Pudding. All have been really good, but I prefer to order toast with the fish dip instead of using the saltines. Also, make sure you use the host sauce on the fish dip! The bread pudding was great.  Music: Anytime I have been in, the music has always been different (due to the different DJs they book), but it has been anywhere from experimental to ambient to rock and in-between. It's never intrusive but not non-existent. I really enjoy the stuff they dish out. Analogue is an unpretentious, well-engineered environment and a quality time out.

Finding the storefront was a bit tricky, as each of us walked past separately upon arrival, before noticing the entry vestibule and patrons inside (the windows are tinted and difficult to see through from the exterior). It was early so space was not at a premium, but we opted for the cocktail table seating in the ""dance space"" with a view of the April snowfall (#!$) upon Milwaukee Ave. Thanks to all who have already posted a review as it was helpful in making our menu decisions. We both started with a Trigger/Happy which was a sweeter take on a tasty bourbon cocktail, complete with a full orange wedge garnish covering the top layer. Later we moved on to the Dandy in the Underworld and even though I'm not as much of a gin fan, like the drinks at Scofflaw and the frozen Negroni at Parson's, this was a solid drink. As for the meal itself, the biscuits we started off with were exceptional. Flaky, melt in your mouth type with a fantastic peppery jelly providing a great sweet and spicy combination. I wish there were more than three biscuits in an order! We also shared the smoked fish dip which was a home run. I assume the contents of the unmarked bottle of Louisiana hot sauce are homemade? Next we shared a bowl of the gumbo and this was one of the best I've enjoyed outside of New Orleans. I particularly liked the flavorful roux, shredded chicken and andouille, and the potato salad was also an interesting, rich component. Our final shared item was the fried chicken sandwich served on toasted bread. This is a well-dressed sandwich and my half portion was more than sufficient as a final course.

As a vegetarian, there's not a ton of options, but both the mushroom / french fry po'boy and the biscuits with pepper jam are incredible. The place has a nice vibe, too.

2014-03-31,3.0,"Analogue, Analogue, I want to love you so. However I feel that three stars is really more apropos. Here's my summary of Analogue if my silly rhyme has made your head hurt and you can't read any further: Food is amazing; service is sometimes amazing & sometimes shaky but not consistent enough to make a general statement; purls are the cool thing to try but if you're looking for a non mixed drink, their beer selection is small; atmosphere leaves much to be desired; it gets insanely busy on the weekends. If you walk by Analogue, you may not know it's there due to no sign being on the outside. Apparently only if you're in the know can you find them. Every Logan Square-ist must be in the know because this is a total hot spot right now and welcomes a weekend wait. I've sat both at the bar and at tables, just in my lowly experience, I had better service at the bar. They don't have many craft brews though there are enough to get by. However if you are looking for a well priced beer, Analogue probably shouldn't be your destination spot. They are known for their craft cocktails and purls. All of their cocktails and Best In Show really is just that. It's yummy and my favorite drink I've had at Analogue. Purls are $7 each and definitely an acquired taste. Sadly, I have not acquired that taste but they're a really cool concept that you definitely should try! Now their food really is amazing. I've only had a couple of small dishes but it's left me wanting to try more... Stuffed Mirliton $7 - filled with smoked mushroom stuffing & black garlic vinagrette. I had no idea what a mirilton was prior to this but what a delicious dish! Scott, Louisiana Egg $8 - soft boiled farm egg in house boudin served with pickled peppers & creole mustard, so basically a New Orleans cajun style twist on a scotch egg, Highly recommend this dish. So many more yummy sounding things on their amped up, cajun/creole menu that I will definitely be back to try more.

But, then I tried the Double Take and holy licorice. I thought it tasted horrible but that was my fault because I didn't know what anything in it was except for the gin. I know I could've asked the bartender, but it was insanely loud in there and the bar was crowded with people on barstools who looked like they wouldn't exactly like the idea of someone leaning in to ask the bartender what half the ingredients were. Then my friend made a good point - for a bar that wanted to pride itself on serving unpretentious cocktails, the drinks were pretty complicated and definitely pricey which, IDK, seemed kind of pretentious to us.

I'm willing to give it another shot, but this review is in response to my first visit and the several cocktails I tried that night. In defense of Analogue, I went in with very high expectations because I'd read that its proprietors previously worked at the Violet Hour. Impressive resume, right? Never an ill-made cocktail classic there... Pros: -The music that night was phenomenal. I remember being impressed with the selection while grumpily waiting in line to get inside. The DJ booth was situated in a lofted area above the entrance. Cheers to you, Saturday night man.  -The environment and ambience was casual. The walls were ambitiously unadorned, the furniture and layout deliberately stripped of themes or influences. Here, you are expected to focus on your company and presumably, your cocktail. Cons: -The cocktails, the main event. Sadly, they were a complete and total train wreck. I find it odd that such a pared down, conceptually minimal bar should offer a cocktail menu with so many off-putting and overpowering flavors. They were desperately original at their own expense. -The ""Good Morning, Captain"" was utterly syrupy and sickeningly sweet. The ingredient list is as follows: ""ed hamilton jamaican gold, blackstrap molasses, tobacco, whole egg"". Interesting in theory, right? The balance was off. I felt like I was slurping down molasses. I barely detected any rum in the concoction, the tobacco was completely (and disappointingly) absent from the profile. I couldn't bring myself to finish this. -The ""Double Take"" with ""letherbee gin, punt e mes, letherbee fernet"". Surprisingly sweet and cough syrup-like as well. To me, it tasted as though the proportions were decided, or perhaps mixed, in error. Too much fernet? It was overpowering. My boyfriend ordered this, I tried it several times. We left this unfinished as well. None of our friends enjoyed this either. -Out of mild frustration, I ordered an Aviation (not on the menu) for myself that was also disappointingly sweet. Borderline candy-like. It's such a simple, fragrant cocktail, you know? Whatever. -The Service: It was extremely difficult to place an order. My favorite bar is The Whistler. I'm no stranger to the cocktail wait, but this was kind of excessive. I waited 18 minutes for a drink, after 10-15 minutes of trying to get someone's attention behind the bar. Once, my bartender simply forgot to make my drink order. He was kind enough to give them to me for free when he realized it. -I had to wait in line for about 15 minutes to get in. I hate waiting in lines. The venue wasn't even that crowded.  I hope they improve with time.",0.9878,0.773,0.147,0.08,0.544689901435664

Hello Juliet n Romeo!) Strike Anywhere: 1st drink of the night.  Very refreshing and a bit tart.  Just how i like it!  End Of The Century: Oh my cocoa!  Definitely would come back for this.  The flavors go perfectly together.  Sweet, coffee, cocoa and alcohol, what else do you want?!  Radio Flyer: My friends 1st drink. Im a fan!  The pumpkin bitters paired well with the brown sugar and bourbon.  Yummy!  Chilling Effectz: A bit on the fruity side for my taste.  This would be perfect for the girl who really doesnt drink much or all she orders is cranberry vodkas.  Not bad by any means but not my cup of tea. Double Take:  Was a bit tipsy by this point so i cant recall.  Haha.   Good Morning Captain:  The BFs first drink of the night.  Yum!  This is definitely a manly drink. The molasses and tobacco make you feel like you sneaked in a swig of your dad's drink while he stepped away from his study for a bathroom break.  The egg makes it a perfect winter drink.     Old Fashioned Shot:  This is like a deconstructed old fashioned.  You drink it like you take tequila shots when you're 18 and on spring break in Cancun.  Love this take on an old fashioned.  Brilliant idea! Basket of Biscuits:  Deliciously warm and flaky and i loved the spice on the jelly.  Had a nice little kick to it.  Can you make these in a never ending basket?  Minus the calories? Place is pretty laid back and rather intimate. I love that there's no sign or street number on the outside.  Also, the cocktails are only $10!  You typically pay btwn $12-15 for these type of drinks. Service was great as well.  The bartenders were super attentive and despite it being crowded we never felt like we waited long for our drinks.  The only negative... i don't want to share this secret with anyone!",0.9987,0.701,0.247,0.052,0.5834300451321728
2013-12-30,3.0,"A few good friends had heard through the grapevine about this new installation offered by Violet hour ownership, so a trip was planned and executed this past Friday night.  Since we all had other plans for the later evening, we descended on this spot as they opened at 6 pm.  Reservations unnecessary.  Location was non nondescript, just as you might expect. (Look for a black exterior without an address)  We four dined together on shared plates, sandwiches and each of us ordered a different cocktail.  More would have been enjoyed if our service matched the high expectations that food and libations met.  Service started out great but fell short.  Food and beverage are top notch, bring a small group and order everything.  Depending on which cocktail is chosen, a sip from each of your friends glasses will catch you a nice buzz. The good details:  If you like the perfectly concocted drinks behind Violet hour, you'll love them here as well.  Each well crafted cocktail costs $10 each.  Just as their drinks are prepared, so is the food offered.  The menu may be small as others have commented, but is perfect for their establishment.  Most every small plate or sandwich is between $5 and $11 dollars, so you won't be breaking the bank to experience awesome.  This is not the Violet Hour, it's Logan square, so dress as you like and walk in and grab a seat.  The music is loud, the selections are good and until it gets busier, you'll have a good enough time sharing it. The wonky details : The decor, the interior.  I think they suffer from an identity crisis.  Until I read another review stating it, I can't imagine it becoming ""club like"" later in the evening.  Why is there a hostess for a place so tiny? (No one checked IDs, so is it a restaurant then?) I get why it's dark but it's so dark that one needs fuel in their candle to read the menu or a smartphone to assist every time the menu needs to be read.  (Our candle burnt out, this was a detail unforeseen by our waiters nor cared for, alike other details.)  When is the best time to ask if your customer needs another drink?  Probably halfway through or definitely when they are at their last sip.  Not two sips into a drink.  Also, wouldn't it be prudent to grab another bottle of water if the table is dry of any drinks???  I could have had three more cocktails and would have, if asked.  The table discussed dessert and would have ordered, if asked but we were forgotten.  40% to capacity doesn't mean you can drop the service ball. A minor but necessary detail.  One small plate came with in house made pepper jelly and a butter.  One waiter saw that we killed the bread but decided to leave these tubs of spread behind; I mentioned this point to the table.  How awesome it was, even though he didn't ask, he left it on the table.  Less than five minutes later another waiter stops by and while grabbing empty glassware, she doesn't inquire but takes the tubs.  It's dark in there, we  didn't notice when she grabbed them.  WTF! Now to another point; Halitosis, it happens.  We know this, so pop an Altoids or chew mint leaves and breathe friendly (especially if working face-to-face).  That smell was terrible and thwarted my thoughts to order two more sandwiches.  In dollars and cents, the drop in service + halitosis lost you approximately $30 to $40 dollars (additional) per person, at our table.  But being that this establishment is CASH ONLY, I'm not sure whether everyone was carrying enough. Another reviewer mentioned it's like Whistler in their early days.  That statement is a great descriptor but beyond their food and drink, there isn't much to it that says who they are.   If you knew nothing about Violet hour one would think:  It's a crappy, nondescript bar in Logan square with minimal thought.  Like so many other bars just like it.  Looking to their choice of seating, tables, candles, etc its the plainest of bars but with a spectacular bar and food menu and yet somehow someone figured out how to get all the pretentious to visit one place. Rating this experience is hard. What to rate? The food and beverage or all details.  When we left we weren't as happy as we were after our first drink and tastes of shared plates.  It's a solid 3.5.

2013-12-29,5.0,"I went to Analogue on Thursday night and liked it so much I went again on Friday with a bunch of my friends. Both times I started there at dinnertime (about 6 p.m.) and just stayed on till like midnight. The second time our group was so big we got to sit at the big booth in the back, which made me feel special. I expected the drinks to be great because the main dudes were the head guys at Violet Hour, and sure enough the drinks were great. But the real story for me was how good the food is. Wow. Over two nights I tried most of the stuff on the menu and I was just stunned by the quality. The food hits the same pleasure zones as the tacos at Big Star... That great greedy slutty animal feeling. I think my very favorite thing was the chicken sandwich. I'm 29. In my life so far I've had at least a few hundred chicken sandwiches. I really believe the sandwich I had on Thursday night at Analogue is the best chicken sandwich I have ever eaten. The chicken sandwich, the Scott egg, the dirty rice, the fish dip... Try all of those things. They're all pretty cheap too. I'm not sure what the chef was doing before he came to Analogue, but eating dinner at Analogue right now feels like getting this dude's rookie card. The Michelin guys should pay attention because this should absolutely be a Bib Gourmand place next year. It doesn't look at all like a restaurant (inside or outside), but it definitely is. Actually, they should probably turn the lights up a little during the dinner hour to make it more like a restaurant. The drinks I had were well balanced, great tasting, creative without being too cute. The Good Morning Captain and Radio Flyer were standouts for me, but my favorite thing was the purls, where they pour like an ounce and a half of bitters in with a Pilsner beer base and make this outrageously bitter thing that is somehow still refreshing and much more than just bitter. I thought #2 was more user-friendly, but if you like anise, #1 is probably even crazier and really good. Be careful though... Objects in the purl glass are more alcoholic than they appear. The drinks are all pretty cheap too. $10 for a cocktail, $7 for a purl I think... Cheaper than any other place in Chicago with drinks of that level of quality. The sound system is impressive. Sounded great all through the space. The only meaningful thing I would have changed either night was that the music was never very good for dancing. It was too heady, at least for me. I feel like I know a reasonable amount about music, but in like eight or ten hours at Analogue over two nights there were probably twenty minutes' worth of songs that I recognized. Would have loved to hear Some Girls-era Stones or Berlin-era Bowie or Bootsy/Catfish-era James Brown. I felt like people wanted to dance but they just didn't get the right ammunition. Also, I thought it got a little too loud for talking as the night went on. They turned the volume up at about 10 p.m. If you're going to turn the music up so loud that it's hard to talk, I feel like you better play music that people really want to dance to. I'm sure they will figure it out over time. One of my friends who was there last night texted me saying they were playing a bunch of James Brown, which is great. The bartenders/servers were all really nice people too. Relaxed and very professional. Thanks guys. OK, I've written a lot, so I will stop here. Thanks so much Analogue people and please keep on doing great. I don't know if I've ever even written a Yelp review before but I was so excited about this place that I felt like I had to. Can't wait to keep going to Analogue and see what it becomes... It's already so much fun.",0.9994,0.729,0.233,0.038,0.558437728937729
2013-12-28,4.0,"This place is likely to become the new Logan hotspot. I don't think it's quite up the impossibly high standards people are likely to hold it to, but it's well on its way.  Even though the bar is championed by those of violet hour fame, I give more props to the food: a boudin-wrapped ""scotch"" egg, mushroom po'boy, and a splash of bread pudding made for an excellent meal.  Cocktails were good, but not great; but maybe that's because I was expecting too much. Overall, I'd give this place 3.5 stars, but I'm rounding up for the cool staff and a welcomed lack of pretentiousness.  For food, try the ""Scott's Egg."" For drink, go with the radio flyer.

2013-12-23,1.0,"One of those places you can't wait to leave.  Several of the drinks were unfit for human consumption, at best some were OK.  I was shocked to learn that the place has a connection with the Violet Hour, since I've never had a bad cocktail there.  Food was bland for a so called Cajun influenced place.  I ended up going to Reno afterwards just to get some decent food.",0.833,0.815,0.154,0.032,0.48333333333333334
2013-12-21,5.0,"This place is awesome.   Simple decor, great music on a killer sound system, Really impressive food (tried a lot of things....the dirty rice was my favorite, second was the smoked whitefish appetizer, my husband loves the Scottish egg, and we both liked the po boy and the fried chicken sand which...oh, and the biscuits are amazing!- and in case you are wondering I didn't eat all of that in just one visit....).  I can't drink much so I was just as impressed with the beer and wine available as everyone else was with the cocktails.  For me the most important thing about a place I go out is eating good food, drinking good fill-in-the-blank and feeling comfortable in a space that isn't stuffy.  Analogue is all of that and I really enjoyed my visits, as did my friends and hubby.   Oh, and I did read one reviewer didn't like that there were only a few cocktails on the menu, but I think he may not have realized that those are just featured drinks- you can order pretty much anything you want (my husband loves a good sidecar but also enjoyed a few of their specials)....",0.9885,0.734,0.226,0.039,0.6465608465608467
2013-12-21,5.0,What a place!  We went on opening night and had a wonderful time!  We earned the official title for most food ever ordered at the restaurant (but this was opening night). We always try the cocktails that bars makeup but our mark for a good bar is how they make an old fashioned and an aviation and they passed!! We originally went to try the cocktails bc robert was our guy from Violet hour but we were so very pleasantly surprised with the food!! We started w the gumbo- awesome!  I am from the south so you know I am a picky gal about my biscuits- but well done on the biscuits!! You must eat one w butter and one w the spicy jelly!  The chicken sandwich was awesome! Only thing is that it's so piled high w chicken that it falls out a bit. We also had the liver mousse- was great!!  The bread pudding dessert was awesssssome!  I'm  scared to write how much I like this place bc then there won't be any seats for us but they deserve it!

2013-12-15,5.0,"I went to Analogue earlier this week with my boyfriend. As another reviewer mentioned, we were expecting fantastic cocktails and drinks, which we got, but we weren't expecting the food to be so good. We had the gumbo and the Scott, LA (louisiana) egg, their take on a scotch egg. The gumbo was everything I expected in a gumbo - thick, spicy, warm, and delicious.  The Scott egg was incredibly rich, with boudin sausage that was perfectly spiced. We also tried the roast beef and ham po' boy, which was a messy but very satisfying sandwich.  Cocktails were also great, especially the Good Morning Captain, a rum cocktail which tasted like a delicious tobacco milkshake. It sounds crazy but it was our favorite. We also sampled both flavors or purls. Both were tasty but the one with the strawberry-allspice bitters was our pick. These potent little cocktails were very bitter, but had a surprisingly textured mouth-feel and were packed with flavor.  Service was solid and our waitress was patient and helpful explaining our questions. The bar was loud, somewhat dark and crowded, but it didn't take away from the dining experience. We took off before the dance floor really filled up. Next time!  Overall - Food and cocktails were both fabulous. Service was great. I can't wait to go back to Analogue and try everything else on the menu.",0.9959,0.689,0.251,0.06,0.6325

2013-12-13,5.0,"I went on opening night, and while I knew the cocktails would be stunning, the food exceeding my expectations, the music was great, and the whole package leaves me excited to come back for more. The purls are delicious (although be warned you have to enjoy bitter flavors to appreciate them). While the bitter hits your mouth first, the effervescence from the beer makes it seem refreshing, and makes for a unique and fun aperitif. And I don't think you can go wrong with any of the cocktails. Another surprise was their cheap beer option, Dixie. I was glad to find an alternate to PBR, and it went so well with the theme of the food. Oh, and the food. I had the smoked whitefish dip, and it was incredible! Smoked in their smoker in the back, the dip is about the fish, not about the creamy sauce, which is why it's so fantastic. It's served with yummy pickles and Lance saltines ... I'm already craving it again. And I had the Chaurice Dog, a delicious chorizo based creation on an airy, buttery, toasty bun. My husband had the perch, also fantastic. And the music was a fun variety, I look forward to coming back when I can stay later and dance with a Dixie in hand! Seriously, exceeds expectations!

2013-12-11,4.0,"I feel like live yelping. So, here it goes. Analogue is a new creation from the people that give you Violet Hour. But, don't expect Violet Hour here. Naw, this is what Logan Square is about. Good cocktails, at a good price, and on the louder side. I live the fact that they decided to open Ina Wednesday. A weekend opening would lead to a huge quagmire. Instead, there is a very good buzz about another quality cocktail place in logan square. To get into the actual review, this is based on the cocktails as I have/had just eaten at piccolo sogno and very satiated food-wise. I've been patiently awaiting this opening as its always nice to have yet another good watering hole in the general area. As of right now, they're handling it easily.  The cocktails are pretty pretty damn good. They're $10 per and cash only, so one has to get that knowledge out there right away. But, these are some quality drinks. There's real competition in the area with longman, scofflaw, and parsons(I don't recognize billy Sunday due to then being giant douches to me, see my review from march).  Even with the general competition, this is a class A debut. First off, the space itself is quality. You come here to chill with some killer tubes going on in the background. The bar itself holds about 15-20 and there are plenty of tables for a bunch of people. They say they can easily hold 50 people and I believe it. The bartenders are first class as well. While I would expect that, the class shows and these are clear pros who know what they're doing. The first night isn't fazing them at all. They are like a well oiled machine from the get go. My friends and I tried through all of the cocktails, and I love the range. You have a few rum, gin, and whisky/bourbon cocktails and all are killer. These are innovative and complex cocktails. I dig. Analogue, you guys killed it from the beginning. The only reason I'm not at 5* is that I know this is the opening and they will get better. I can't wait. I'm already digging down in a big way and I live that there is no real sign on outside and you have to know to come here. I hope nothing but the best as this is rocking already.",0.9231,0.86,0.101,0.039,0.5326157836872123
