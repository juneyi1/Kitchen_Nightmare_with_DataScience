2016-11-17,3.0,"Went out to Finch Kitchen for a Puzzled Pints event on a Tuesday night. There was actually a wait for a table downstairs but thankfully there were some reserved upstairs for the event. The space is pretty cool; it's like a giant farm/warehouse with views of the brewing equipment. Our waiter was really nice but service was very slow. The poor guy had way too many tables to look after. My friends and I each did a flight, which were very reasonably priced. The beer was...blah. Several of them tasted really funny. The only one I liked was the Dual Citizenship, which was their dark beer offering. I love to support our local breweries but this place is way behind Begyle/Dovetail/Empirical/etc... not to mention the bigger guys. We also ordered some food, which was OUTRAGEOUSLY expensive. $15 for a sausage on a bun and one side. $14 for a thin double patty burger and fries. $6 for sides a la carte. Where are we, the West Loop? My beer brat and german potato salad were fine, but good gracious it should have cost half that much.

I am not a huge beer fan but the ones I tried were very good.  I'm sorry that I don't have words for beer beyond like and dislike. Atmosphere-wise the place is a cool looking cavernous space with highlighted viewing of the beer making equipment.  The front facade of large windows push out of the way during nice weather to give a real open-air feel.  The only downside is that, perhaps because the interior is entirely made of hard surfaces, it is loud in there.  I mean all places this size will be loud but it seems louder than it should for the amount of people that were there when we visited. Food-wise I was a bit disappointed as that the menu is mostly a variety of sausage-like things and I would have ordered almost anything else as a first choice. For me, sausage-like things are something that seems better when grilling with friends in the backyard. But we did like what we had.  The things that come with your sausage, as described on the menu, turn out to be an amount that is more like a garnish. With all that said, I still give it 4 stars and we will return.",0.9289,0.789,0.131,0.08,0.6655827067669173

The service is top notch.  Our bartender Colin is very informed about the menu and all the different types of beers they serve. He always takes great care of us.  So if you haven't been here in a bit I strongly recommend giving finches another shot.  Would love to see more successful bars and restaurants in the neighborhood to compliment Angelo's and finches so get out and show your support.

Because the beer was not good. As an enthusiastic beer nerd, I know what to expect from a good sour, witbier, or dubbel, and I know what I like.  I found three out of four of the beers in my flight to be bland, unremarkable, and not particularly good examples of their various styles.  The only one that didn't entirely disappoint was the Bramblin' Man. The food was a mixed bag as well.  I was perfectly happy with the raclette (although it's hard to screw up melted cheese) but thought the loaded fries were over-sauced, with a mayonnaise *and* a curry aioli *and* the yolk of the fried egg.  It was all just kind of wet and off-putting, rather than decadently messy.

For food, we had the chicken wings and the loaded fries. Wings deserved credit for being the whole wing, from tip to drummette, but were sadly under-seasoned.

Then there was a giant f*cking sad trombone sound echoing throughout the Chicago craft beer community.  As much as I don't like them, your boy was still curious. I knew they were acquiring a nice space, they were debuting new beers, & I think I even heard something about a change in ownership. This was their opportunity to not suck. But sucking is just what they do. Their beers were as uninspiring as ever. I came here half in the bag (ok, lets be real. All the way in the bag) from going to other (better) breweries on my birthday, and still I could taste the sadness in Finch's beer. Even past beers I once enjoyed, they changed the recipes so they would suck. All I could hear was the Adam Sandler line in Billy Madison: ""YOU BLEWWW IT!""

There are a lot of plusses going on here but a few things that could be improved upon.  The beer. I much prefer the beer offered by Finch than Breakroom (sorry guys). I'm a fan of the taco cat sour. The saison I tried on my visit was pretty good too. I also appreciate the nice cocktail menu. The staff. I never really had issues at BR but also do not recall them being quite as friendly as they are at FK. The space was nice before so that hasn't changed much. Thankfully the beautiful bar built for BR is still in tact. But those high top table stools? Those suck. They are uncomfortable and I felt like I could take a tumble at any moment. I hope they consider changing the seating if they really want us neighborhood folk to stick around for a few brews and some grub.  Speaking of grub, the fried chicken kimchi sandwich was quite tasty. Also tried the burger and it was perfectly fine but nothing special. I preferred the burger at BR as they had add-ons that made it truly decadent. However, the fries at Finch are so much better and this makes me really happy. The sauces they serve with their fries and sammies are bomb too. Dessert is solid. The warm pretzel was OK. I was kind of perplexed by the sausage dishes. None of them sounded appetizing to me in the heat of August. I'd appreciate those offerings more if served in a bun with some chips. Save the heavier presentation for Fall & Winter.  Like I said, a lot of plusses and a few ""ehs"". Will I be back? Absolutely. A lot of positive changes here.

2016-07-18,2.0,"The Finch Kitchen is a nice place to visit, but I wouldn't want to stay here.  Its a sad story, because the beers are tasty and the bar looks great.  The Protestant seating and the so so food will likely drive you away. On the plus side, service is very friendly, and the removal of the large, long communal booths opens the room up and makes it feel more like a proper bar.  The seating which replaces it is a horror show, but more on that later. The house beers are excellent - I had the Plumage (pilsner) and the Drive Thru (Mexican lager), and they were both crisp and refreshing, perfect summer beers.  I also had a taste of the Secret Stache, stout in a can, and it was lovely - nice balance of chocolate and toffee.  As a Noble Bourbon Boozer I also tried the Old Fashioned, and it was superb, right up there with Billy Sunday, of which it was paying homage. The rest of the experience is a solid meh.  The pretzel was still good, but stay away from the pickled cocktail sausages, they manage to be at once bland and too briny.  The burger, while striving for Au Cheval status, falls short, for the bun is too doughy, making eating it a slog.  In the winter I might try one of the sausages but they are all too heavy for sticky Chicago summers, and the cooling system is not up for the challenge of making the two story space comfortable.  They should consult with the Red Lion in Lincoln Park - that place is a meat locker. The final nail in the coffin here, though, is the seating design.  The Finch Kitchen is simply the latest Chicago establishment to fall victim to deluded interior designers who insist that minimalist metal and wood chairs formerly banished to high school drafting rooms and metal shops are appropriate for extended bouts of drinking.  It simply must stop.  Instead of leather backed bar stools with sturdy construction, drinkers must balance on small wooden disks with unyielding wooden backs.   Why you would want to sit in one of those chairs for multiple rounds of bitter is beyond me.  We are not to be ruled by Puritans, are we?  The only respite is 4 or 5 comfortable booths in the back.  If you are not able to snag one of those, your evening of drinking is going to give you piles.  Perhaps you can send them the doctor bill.",0.9928,0.809,0.139,0.052,0.5317781155015198

I went opening night for Finch Kitchen so you can't reasonably expect everything to go well. First, we were happy to see our favorite Breakroom waiter was still around as he is very friendly and incredibly knowledgeable. I know all the old employees had to reapply for their job and seems only two made the cut, not sure how I feel about that to be honest.  The Beer - Was actually quite good. I tried all 8 or 9 of their taproom only brews and enjoyed all of them. I have had Finch's in the past and it was just okay, the taproom brews under new ownership is definitely much better.  The service - The waitress we had was absolutely awesome, I wish I remembered her name to give her a shout out. The manager also came around and asked what we thought and was very receptive to what we did not like.  The space - Honestly I preferred the look of Breakroom. They butchered the beautiful bar which makes me sad. The chairs are also very uncomfortable (and kind of ugly), which I guess means you'll turn tables quicker. The walls are also somewhat sparse which I didn't care for. They touted how the space would have a better flow....all they did was move a few tables around nothing big here. New cool lighting but I don't like how you can see all the wiring personally. The food - Meh. Very limited menu with no real entrees. It is just appetizers, sausages, sandwiches/burgers and some shared plates. Nothing really revolutionary or exciting. I had the chicken sandwich which was okay. My friends had the mussels and a burger which again they said were just okay. We also thought it odd that you can't add bacon to the burger, who doesn't have bacon? We also had the pretzel for an appetizer and it was somewhat hard and doesn't come with cheese which I feel is a mistake. You get mustard, which I don't care for, and a sweet rhubarb jam which was gone but not fitting for a pretzel in my opinion. Hoping they come out with a more robust and interesting menu.

2016-06-25,2.0,"I was very much looking forward to this place, in large part because of the disappointment that Breakroom turned out to be. Even so, The Finch Kitchen managed to lower the bar even more. I have been here 4 times since they opened because I was convinced it would improve... it did not. The Good: Beer! An overall improvement in selection, quality, and variety for the neighborhood. The Finch purchase of Hopothesis was a great move and having a Drafty Window on draft makes a good day even better. The Meh: The service is nothing to laud, but it isn't a detraction either. The Bad: The food is substandard and overpriced. The only ""can't miss"" item on the menu is the loaded fries, which are essentially fries, mayonnaise with curry spices, some crumbled sausage, and topped an egg. Sounds good, right? $14. Good, but not worth it. My wife got the ""The Chicago"", a hot dog and fries, for $12. This was probably the most flavorless hot dog I've every tasted. Slim's down the street on Montrose gives you 2 delicious hot dogs and fries for $5.45. Tastes better, is cheaper, and you can go to Finch for a beer after. My friend got the ""Mergueze"". A hot dog sized beef and lamb sausage cut lengthwise with roasted potatoes covered in tomato sauce. $18. This actually tasted good. But $18. That's 3x what a gourmet Hot Doug's dog would cost (RIP). Have you guys been to Links in Wicker Park?? Amazing Link sausages of all tastes and varieties for $9 a pop, better beer on tap, and great music (I know, it's in Wicker, but still). Finally, the burger. After being so disappointed my first 2 times, I decided to try the one thing I was convinced they couldn't mess up. They messed it up. They are using some kind of potato bun that is so dry it takes all of the flavor out of the meat. The burger arrived cold, dry, and the pickles had the most flavor of anything on it. How does 5 Guys get this right every time and it's so tough for Finch? FINAL VISIT. LAST CHANCE. ""Chorizo"" Sandwich. Chorizo, one of the few sausages on Earth that has so much fat and flavor without even trying that it is an instant improvement to anything. It's like Mexican bacon. But not if the meat is SO overcooked there is no longer any fat or flavor. There was even so little chorizo on the sandwich that all I could taste was that overbearingly dry potato bun. I understand that a lot of us in the neighborhood just want a cool place to hang out. I won't deny, Finch Kitchen may be the closest thing we have to that. But we have to expect more.

2016-06-19,3.0,"Stopped by for lunch to check out the food and beers. I was a little disappointed that none of the beers that Finch cans are available on draft, but that means all kinds of new beers to try! As such, I had to go with the 5 beer sampler. I think they did a nicer job with some of the lighter and stranger styles. My favorite beer of the bunch was their pilsner, which had a nice flavor and was easily drinkable at 5.2%. I also liked their gottslandrika, the Midgard, although it was the first gottslandrika I think I've ever tried so it got the benefit of lacking expectations. The food menu is small, but has enough interest on it to make decisions are little challenging. We ended up deciding to share a couple dishes to be able to sample the flavors. The star of the show was the charred beets. Great char of the beets and a nicely composed dish with the pecans, goat cheese, and onions. The tofu sausage was really really salty, it was definitely strong on the asian umami kick, but I think it went a little too far. I loved the space though and the staff were super nice and accommodating. I really want them to do well, but none of the beers struck me as something I'd want to take away in a growler.",0.9966,0.721,0.257,0.022,0.6325466200466199
2016-06-19,5.0,"This place has it all: delicious food, tasty beverages, cool atmosphere, and great service. My wife and I got a sitter for Father's Day and we had the delight of a rare afternoon without two toddlers.  We decided to sit at the bar and take in the spacious surroundings. There are soaring tall ceilings with exposed wood beams and tastefully displayed barn wood adorning the interior. The brewery sets an industrial backdrop for the bar and dining area with plush booths, sleek chairs and recycled wood tables, There are a few flat screen TVs hang on the walls and large neon yellow finch stands out from the back.  We started with a flight of Finch's exclusives: INANIMATE OBJECT: a Belgian Rye Dubbel, PLUMAGE: a Pilsner, MIDGARD: a Gottslandrika,  DRIVE THRU: a Mexican Lager,  and SHARDS OF NARSIL: a American IPA. They each had their own voice and sang with their own notes. We shared the hot pretzels: soft and fluffy, they came with a horseradish stone ground mustard and a sweet rhubarb dipping sauce. Then we ordered the homemade pork rinds that had a salt and vinegar seasoning, which perfectly accompanied the FACIST PIG: Red Ale.  We finished with chicken wings: Roasted Garlic, Lime & Thai Chile. These were sweet, sticky, fall off the bone tender and had a tremendous spicy kick. I'm from Buffalo, NY - home of the chicken wing and these folks at Finch's know what their doing and have my seal of approval! We washed down the heat from the wings with the HOPOTHESIS DRAFTY WINDOW: Farmhouse Ale.  There were lots of neighborhood folks and we struck up conversations with other parents (who didn't get a sitter) and they were delighted with the kids menu, high chairs, selection of handcrafted sausages and 64oz growlers to take home some beer.  The bartender offered samples to make sure we'd be happy with the beer we ordered and we got a growler of the MIDGARF, (7.4% ABV) to take home, my kind of doggie bag! The manager checked in to ensure we didn't need anything. The only thing I need is to get back to Finch's to refill my growler.",0.9911,0.873,0.118,0.009,0.5764484126984126
2016-06-18,3.0,"Great selection of beers, and great service, but food seemed to lack that punch.  Crispy chicken sandwich had a good cadence of flavors however since it was so thin it over cooked easily rendering it into cardboard and it came out cold not what you would expect from right out the kitchen. I think cheese would be good on the sandwich too.  Fries were so so, I found myself digging through the fries just to get to the salty cheese they put over it, perhaps melting the cheese onto the fries may help. Oooh speaking of cheese y don't they have Mac and cheese?  Fish fry lacked in flavor i.e. Salt. For the price It could have used more qty of cod and shrimp. They have a few aioli that are spot on but don't even bother asking for bbq sauce at this Barstaurant, they'll look at you like you're asking for ketchup at Jimmy's Red Hots! Nice atmosphere, I can defiantly see this place improving on their menu options. Overall price is a bit bourgeoisie which make me reluctant to try their sausages.",0.9808,0.811,0.162,0.027,0.6049319727891156

That being said, none of the beer I tried seemed like anything special. I had a chicken sandwich for dinner, and my girlfriend had a burger. Both of which we thought were good, but again nothing special. The design of the establishment was the best part. It had a friendly and open feel too it and I liked the high tables and bar placement. Our waitress was informative and enthusiastic, which was nice. The only real negative comment I have is that the chairs were very uncomfortable.

2016-06-17,4.0,"Was bummed when Breakroom Brewery closed but glad that Finch took over the space.  They did some renovations and the space looks great.  We had dinner & beer flights.  The food was pretty good, beer was great, and service was excellent.  I wish I had grabbed our server's name because she rocked.  The beer prices are also very reasonable - $5 for a 3 beer flight - and they offered a variety of sizes in all of their beers which is great when you want to try a bit of everything. Took a star off because we had an appetizer and entrees, but they all arrived at the same time which was a bummer.  Also, my fries with my burger were good but I would describe them as ""undercooked"" verging on ""raw potatoes"".  The seasoning made up for their sogginess.   We will definitely be back and are glad that this space was able to remain a brewpub!",0.9944,0.707,0.274,0.018,0.6361025641025642
2016-06-16,2.0,"Anybody who spent time at the previous restaurant and bar here (Breakroom) probably wasn't surprised when it closed.  It too was a brewpub, but the problems were many; mostly bad service and bad beer. I'm a fan of Finch beer over the years.  I was quite excited to see them move into this new location.  Unfortunately, the same problems seem to be present. The staff are forced to wear corporate looking t-shirts. Service is very slow.  The worst part though is the beer.  It tastes like the same beer Breakroom served. Ugh.  Of all the things I would hope about this place it would be that they could pour good brews.  Nope.  At least not yet.  It doesn't seem like they even have real Finch's on tap. The beers do not match the canned releases.  That's too bad.   Maybe it'll improve with time.  I'm not holding my breath from their initial approach.",-0.9516,0.672,0.126,0.203,0.42005509641873284

2016-06-14,2.0,"I've been a fan of Finch's for some time.  Toured the brewery on Elston ages ago and fell in love with the place, and I became excited when I heard it was opening this past weekend.  The Asian chicken sandwich was perfect.  Arugula, spicy Kim-chi, sesame on a nicely battered chicken breast.  Great fries too.  Different from your standard pub food. I love Skull Hammer.  Just a beautiful beer on tap.  Shards of Narsil was too.  My inner nerd also loved the Lord of the Rings references on the menu. Sincerely disappointed when we heard from our waiter that Sloth Overlord and a personal favorite for some time, Nuclear Winter aren't in the brewery's plans to make another appearance anytime soon.  I'm a huge local craft beer fan, and Nuclear Winter is (apparently now ""was"") one of my local favorites. Suggestions:  Finch's beer battered cheese curds.  I'm a regular if you guys get these.  Oh, and get Nuclear Winter back please for an old fan.  I know with the new kitchen/brewpub comes a new direction, and I love that off the bat on opening weekend, they've set the tone for doing it their way. Edit/Update***** Yeesh, they fell down fast in my most recent visit here.  Skull Hammer gone for Bramblin Man, which is an English styled IPA that the establishment boasts hints of tea, buttered toast, currant, lemongrass, and a few other things.  I dont know if I got the bottom of the keg, or if it was the finished product, but man was it a swing and miss.  None of those flavors, just a caramel malt based beer with no oomph, no carbonation, and ultimately--no flavor.   Quite forgettable.   And I don't know what the brewers'/owners' game plan is here, just to keep rotating different styles, or stay true to themselves, because there was a menu change, and it just struck me as average/almost unappetizing.  Got the melted cheese plate with the stale bread, and it was a waste of money.  Make it at home with something other than Mexican Jack cheese, olives, sausage, and more than 3 medium slices of stale bread.  Or make your own grilled cheese out of it. Also, still no cheese curds or Nuclear Winter.  :/   I'll be on the lookout for the canned beer in the area from grocery stores, because Chimera and Sloth Overlord (a few places still carry the 4 pack) are the 2 remaining beers that I'll get because I like them.  Cant say I'm in a hurry to come back to this place or to try anything new they put out.  There are far better choices in the area.",0.9559,0.849,0.102,0.05,0.4848323584172641

2016-06-12,3.0,"Early in their existence, so the stars are subject to change as they settle down and get everything in order.  Service at the bar was painfully slow. It was their second day open to the public and they were busy, so I will forgive that. They were out of soda water, which boggles the mind. Again, hopefully just growing pains.  I had the Drive Thru Mexican lager. It was on-style and refreshingly, but didn't blow my mind. I had the pork rinds (fine. Mustard stole the show.) and the pretzel (very good, again top mustard.) For my entree, I ordered the fish fry and was soundly disappointed. I'm from Wisconsin and have high standards, but this fell short on all fronts.  Menu looks interesting, though, so I'll be back and I'm hoping the early days kinks will be worked out.",0.8376,0.827,0.119,0.054,0.38730994152046777

2016-06-10,3.0,"My boyfriend and I stopped in on opening day, and I can't say it was bad.. but I can't say it was great. The beer selection was varied, but didn't include any good hoppy beers (I'm sure this will rotate and vary, so this is personal preference).  We ordered a flight to try all of the available beers, and while they were good, they didn't make us want to purchase a growler. We ended up ordering the chicken sandwich and fish sandwich, which were OK but overpriced for what they were. The chicken sandwich was flattened out to nothing, breaded and fried. The fish sandwich were two smaller, thin pieces of cod served on toasted white bread. Neither were anything to write home about, and the $15 price tag on the fish sandwich was just too much. I will say the fries that accompanied them were good, so maybe just ordering the fry appetizer, or one of the sausage selections would be the safer option. The service is the biggest issue that I can note. Every table was full, but there wasn't a wait list and it still took an hour to receive our food. I expect to have slower service in a new place, and especially on opening night but this was just a little too much. When we first got there we received our beer flight right away, but after ordering second/third rounds of drinks they would take up to 20 mins to get delivered (and in one case, forgotten completely). I will say that our server was very knowledgeable about the beers & food, it just took too long to get them. Whether this was the bartenders fault, the servers, or the kitchen.. I'm not sure. I'm hoping this is because it was the first night (even so, it shouldn't take an hour to deliver two fried sandwiches with fries), and not because the service is going to follow the same route as Breakroom Brewery that was at this location before. That being said, I will likely go back in a few weeks when the beer selection has rotated and see if everything goes a little more smoothly.",0.2827,0.892,0.051,0.056,0.5110697309226722

Taken the space from breakroom brewery and making it look better with new brews and better food. I have to say that overall I really liked. At least half of their drafts are definitely good but some are a bit off. A few of them are drink all day good like the witbier, gottslandrika (smokey goodness), and American IPA. Not sure if it's a destination place for beer but good for this area. Plus, all of the menu is stellar (of course, all Merges) including the loaded fries with the fried egg on top. Mussels are also excellent. Can't wait to try the rest of the menu and pair with the beers.   Would be 5 stars if the beer was a rock star like the food.

2016-06-09,4.0,"I have an ever so slight obsession with trying out new breweries and when I got word Finch was finally opening a taproom with an adjoining kitchen, I was all over it! Just opened today at 5pm in the old Breakroom space, it's a beautifully done new brewpub option in the area! It's huge and welcoming with bar seating, tables and some booths. Now me and you, dear Yelp reader, we're super close. We share a special bond so I feel like I can tell you a little secret....I haven't been too big on Finch's beers. I've only sampled a few but nothing has ever done it for me. I'm a Chicago beer advocate but have never been able to rally for Finch.  I got some good news, the Finch Kitchen has a good number of their beers on tap for the tasting and there are some winners in there. On opening night, they had 8 Finch beers on tap with a few guest options, as well. And in a very pleasing manner to me, they have flights. Flights are very reasonable at 5 for $8 or 3 for $5. Bombers are $5 for the bomber itself and then $15 for a fill. All of the FInch beers were decent with some standouts like the Midgard! It was my favorite with smoked hops, apparently an ancient Mordecai beer. Most of Finch's beers are lower in percentage with nothing much higher than 7% so it can make for a more sessionable evening. Their other beers currently on tap - Skull Hammer 6.5% IPA, Shards of Narsil 6.5% IPA, Liquid Swords 5.4% Pale Ale, Drive-Thru 6.5% Mexican Lager (better than expected!), Inanimate Object 6.4% Belgian Dubbel, Plumage Pilsner 5.2% Czech Pilsner, and Western Exposure 5.4% Witbier.  All of their beer names seem very Game of Thrones-esque to me. For their flights, they present you with a paper with the name of each beer, type and percentage then place your glass on top of the corresponding circle so you can easily identify your beer. A key element of beer tasting and ordering flights for me is ease of idenification so this was much appreciated.  The food was pretty bomb! They have an array of sausages and when I asked for recommendations I was pointed towards the Toulouse. It came on a bed of mashed potatoes, peas, carrots and spring onion gravy. Every element of this was just delicious. I tired the Double Bird Burger and have to say that Malt Aioli is money! It's such a good sauce we ended up using it for their tasty fries, as well. The burger was slightly overcooked though and actually they didnt ask us how we wanted it cooked.  Our server Jake was awesome! He knew every single detail about the beers and their origins. He also went into great detail on the food dishes. I love when servers know what they're doing .... And on the first day?! I'm impressed. The GM also came around to make sure all was on point. Just lovely service throughout our entire visit. I couldn't believe how smoothly everything seemed to be running on their first day of being open! There were a couple of tiny little missteps (running out of one beer 2 hours in, bringing wrong beers in the flight) but they are so minor and easily forgivable that I feel bad even mentioning them. Between 3 of us, we spent about a hundy. The sausages are kind of pricey ($17-18) but man are they good so I think they must just be worth the hefty pricetag. That's a big MAY be worth the price haha!  I really enjoyed Finch's new brewery/bar (they have a few non Finch beers)/brewpub (amazing food) location! Great service,decent beer, wonderful food and a great space made for a great evening! I would say both their beers and food are very rustic and medieval which is an interesting spin on the norm.
