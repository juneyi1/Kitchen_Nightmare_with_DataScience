2012-05-20,4.0,"The Bistro of the North!   Taking over the former Small Bar location my home away from home has a new little brother. We stopped in during their opening weekend to have lunch, beers and watch Chelsea win the European Cup.  The North location is a really cool space.  It lays out perfectly for gamewatching with the long bar, back booths and high tops.  There are also a few patio tables outside and a big loft area.  Plenty of space to choose from for craft beer drinking and plenty of options on the beer list as well.  Highlights for me on this particular day, aside from Drogba's late equalizer and PK clincher for the cup, was the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale which you don't often find outside of the Bluegrass.   The food menu is pretty much the same as the Madison location minus the pizzas.  Good pub fare to be had.  So, load up on a beer soaking giant pretzel or the Gourmet burger-bacon, egg, cheddar and peanut butter on a pretzel roll and don't forget the tots.  As I mentioned the beer list is always changing, but you will be sure to find great options.  Expect to find some rare selections, special releases and tap takeovers from the best craft brewers.  Lagunitas Little Sumpin, Founders Centennial IPA, and 3F Alpha King are all on tap now.   I obviously love what the bistro is doing and the lil bro is off to a fine start.  Cheers.",0.9923,0.822,0.173,0.005,0.4391353628450402
