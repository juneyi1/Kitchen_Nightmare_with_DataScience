2016-12-18,1.0,"Where to begin... I guess at  Part 1: The Arrival. My friend and I walked in and were ignored. Finally the waitress noticed us and informed us all the tables were reserved and that we could TRY to find space at the bar. I replied we do have a reservation. For the record we did, but that seemed to bewilder her. Her associate in a black stained sweatshirt then asked again if we had a reservation, to which we repeated, yes PLEASE we do! He told us we didn't before checking. Then he checked and gave us a thumbs up and then walked away leaving us waiting at the front door. He then came back and looked annoyed as if we were meant to follow after given no signal to follow. We follow him to the back of the restaurant and he keeps walking leaving us stranded between three tables. And when we questioned him he vaguely gestured to a table with a roll of the eyes. Things were going well.  Part 2: The menu. After being seated we were informed that of the short menu with about 10 items listed, half of them were no longer available as the waitress noted ""you can thank the people who came in yesterday!"" Who ordered your food at a restaurant? How dare they. My friend offered to run out to Marianos to buy them an avocado so he could have guacamole with his chilaquiles- but they said no, they would just frame us for murder instead. Just kidding! They would just charge us $5 for a cup of lukewarm watered down liquid marketed as ""coffee"".  Part 3: The food. My friends and I made our selections from the measly 3 options we were given. The food finally arrived. At vastly different times and a side of biscuits was missing in action. As were every refill. The food was bland. I ordered the chilaquiles, which without guacamole, looked like khakis that went through a food processor.  Part 4: Surprise... Cash Only! This was the crème de la crème of a very memorable (not in a good way!) restaurant experience. The waitress, who must have had a vendetta against us at this point, waits until she sets our overly priced check down to inform us that the credit card machine has been broken for a month ( how a business operates a month without their credit card processor shows they really have their priorities in line) and if we use the ATM machine and get the receipt we can have a free shot. Yippee. Just what I needed on a Sunday at 1 p.m. Unless that shots of cyanide so I can forget this place and leave the world behind me, I ain't buying! In conclusion, unless you want to be forever plagued by the memory of this ""rustic yet chic"" entitled, masturbatory establishment that encourages treating customers they're pieces of rat carcasses, I suggest you take your business elsewhere.",0.9527,0.835,0.098,0.067,0.5136574074074073

The wait for a table was over an hour, and they weren't seating anyone inside. We agreed to eat at the bar to avoid the wait. The service there was really quite terrible. I'm willing to let go of bad service for good food, but I couldn't even get that here.  We waited over an hour for our food, which the waiter constantly reassured us was about to be ready. He brought food out for one member of our party half an hour before the rest of us got fed, and even that food was luke-warm, like it happened to just be sitting around.  I ordered a hash that was supposed to be corn beef, beets, potatoes, and eggs. I got approximately 4 cubes of beers. Maybe 10 of potatoes, and then a few little bits of beef. There was barely anything on my plate. And it was cold. I guess they'd had our food ready, but never actually brought it out. This wasn't even worth eating.  To compensate for the incredibly long wait for food, they brought us out their bacon maple donuts. They were tasty, but it really couldn't make up for the terrible service and inedible food.",-0.8061,0.795,0.087,0.119,0.4860144927536231

I made a reservation for two and when I arrived, I was told they don't seat people until the whole party was there. From my past experience,  I knew that wasn't true but I let it go. Then a guy came in after me and also had a reservation for two people and was sat immediately! When I asked if I could be sat I was given the same response and said ""well that man was sat."" To which I got a dismissive wave and then was taken to the very back of the restaurant. I was so upset that I decided to leave when my friend arrived.

At this point, people are beginning to pile in, with no respect for maybe who might be in line next to speak with the non-existent host. FINALLY he walks in from outside, and is just casually walking and talking to someone. He was nice, but 0 interest in maybe seeing who needed a table, who had a reservation, who was 1st in line. Anyways, we get seated. Took 20 minutes for the waitress to bring our waters. Another 25 minutes to even get our drinks we ordered. Now when you come for brunch, the thing I think you're most excited about is getting your drink! Waiting that long was ridiculous. Our waitress said it was because the bartender was busy socializing with everyone sitting at the bar. Ummm... ok? We were waiting so long for just our waters and booze at that point, we were ready to walk out. But whatever, we waited it out when they finally came. The food was alright. Also, the waitress honestly for the wait should have given us the 1st round on the house. But of course she didn't. The vibe I do not like in there. I've been a few times in the past late at night and didn't even like it then. Very too cool for school vibe (yes I just wrote that). Only thing I liked was the fact it was dog friendly.

Bottomless mimosas and tasty brunch is true - likes the steak with potatoes and the red door burger.  Unfortunately that's where the positives end.  The service staff is inefficient. Took them at least 30 mins to bring food and another 15 mins to be reminded to bring cutlery. The blond haired waitress (I describe her as she forgot to introduce herself) tended to ignore us even after making eye contact. And the mimosa pitchers (watered down and stale tasting but I won't even go there) are not refilled (I felt they are almost reluctant to give out drinks).  I like the food but not memorable.

Well, we returned with about seven other friends and the service was extremely unprofessional and the attitudes of many of the employees were lackluster.  We waited over forty minutes for our food to arrive and it was brought to us one person at a time, they did not remember who ordered what and my girlfriend received the wrong dish. Our food was terrible, cold and unappetizing. I've never been so outraged by a dining establishment in my life. I had one beer and at some point my glass of water was taken and never returned. I ordered the safe and standard ""Red Door Burger."" It arrived with cold fries and it lacked the fried egg I requested. Another fellow in my group also lacked his fried egg. We were told by our server that they were looking for eggs and they would come back to let us know if they found any! They never let us know, by the way.  At least, the waitress gave us 20% off our meal and took a few entrees off the bill. Still, the price did not reflect the service we were provided nor the quality of the food. As we solemnly walked back to our vehicle, we stared through the windows of many other dining establishments that might have treated us to a much better meal. Later, one of my friends puked. It wasn't from the beer, though, it was because his bloodied burger was actually a grease sponge placed between a hamburger bun.

It is busy but not packed. After being seated it takes 15 mins to get water and have wait staff come over. They are out of 3 dishes on the 10 dish brunch menu. We order bottomless mimosas and breakfast. I order the eggs and bacon and a biscuit. My friend orders crab Benedict, sauce on the side. The mimosa carafe is brought over warm, and with plastic glasses. All the other drink ware on the table is glass. My friend asks for glasses. The waitress says no, we only have plastic. We broke all our glasses. No, you have glass. This water is in a glass. Please bring us some glasses. She says fine. The mimosa is warm so I ask for some ice. Waitress rolls her eyes. The food comes. My friend's crab benny is served cold with the sauce on it. The biscuit is cold, with butter, no jam or jelly or honey. I ask for some jelly. I am told that she isn't in charge of ordering and they ran out of jelly. We order another carafe of mimosa. And have to ask for more ice. More eye rolling.  So that is it for me.

2016-06-23,2.0,"I recently had a party at Red Door, and was disappointment in the gap between what Troy and I agreed on and what was delivered. The cost of my ""private"" party was predicated on the premise that he would close the restaurant after Sunday brunch service, and charge me what he would be likely to make if he stayed open during the hours of my event. We further agreed that he would supply 5 unique seasonal appetizers, and a drink package that included 5 choices of local craft and domestic beers, call drinks, red, white and rose wine, house made Sangria, and Moscow Mules. In a follow up conversation, I confirmed that we would want to be able to be inside and outside, and that the event would be open house style, with people coming and going throughout.  When I arrived at 3:00, the place was full, and when my guests began arriving at 3:30, some were told that nobody from my party was there yet, there was still no place for them to sit outside, the bar was not set up, and there was no staff to attend to my guests. Troy and team appeared completely ill prepared to host my group. I was uncomfortable and embarrassed. By 4:15, we'd managed to get the attention of a server, who kind of half set up the bar on the upper deck, and was intermittently behind it offering drinks to my guests, but was more often away from his post, fetching this or that from inside.  Around this time, another server emerged with a plate of avocado fries, and some guests who arrived at 3:30, and had had to stand for 45 minutes, left without eating or sitting. The rest of the food started coming fairly steadily at this point, in quantities that disappeared in seconds, having served just a fraction of the guests.  They substituted bacon wrapped artichokes for calamari without asking/notifying me, thereby limiting the choices available for non-meat eaters, of which there were quite a few. There was no Sangria, or evidence of availability of call drinks, or beer.  I do client service work, too, and if there is one thing I know, it's that managing expectations is paramount. The product and service I received on Sunday fell significantly short of my expectations. I no longer identify as a net promoter of Red Door.",-0.818,0.923,0.029,0.048,0.4065656565656566

Oh BABY it was good, hot, perfectly cooked chicken on top of a flakey, buttery biscuit and bacon maple syrup. The chicken has some spice to it, but I promise if I can handle it and enjoy every last bite, anyone can.

Usually when it comes for bottomless mimosas I go to boystown/ lake view but decided to try a different place. I have to say that first impression was that place look very small, but because of How packed it was the restaurant I figured that it was good. After seen menu we were so exited because food of menu seems good and the plate next to us too. Our very COLD waiter took ""drinks order"" which it was the bottomless package and literally took him More than 15 min for him to bring the mimosas. I had to stand up and ask manager why it was taking so long to bring the mimosas if the tables next to us they were coming pretty fast. Then after finally get the mimosas we told them To right away bring us the next one because we knew it would go right away and the guy gave us a look like whatever. Waited left and still didn't take our order, It  was about 45 min since we got to rest and nothing, no order taken and drinks coming slow. Finally guy we bad attitude took our order and finally drinks started to come more often. I must say after taking order food came very fast and it was very DELICIOUS. Is not going to be my last time here I will give them a try. I feel that it was just or waiter that was not doing his job correctly, because the others you can tell they were brining food and drinks very fast. I will give it a try for sure again because the mimosas and food were very good.",0.9866,0.87,0.115,0.015,0.5463543266769074
2016-05-30,2.0,"Since I almost never give ratings this low, let me explain.  I came here for dinner with some friends. We had a reservation for 8PM but still had to wait about fifteen minutes after arrival for our table to be ready. It was a bit perplexing because the restaurant wasn't even that full, but fifteen minutes is not that terrible. The restaurant itself is not that big, and in addition to the bar there are just a few tables indoors. However, there are lots of long picnic-table style seats outside, and that is where our party was seated. It was fine when we sat down but got colder after the sun set, especially since most of the heat lamps were not turned on.  I don't believe our waitress ever introduced her name. She took a while to get to us, and rarely came by to check on us; it was a struggle just to flag down anyone for service. Overall, she wasn't unfriendly by any means but just didn't really seem to care that much about us. One of the water people spilled water all over the table/one of my friends when pouring water. Hey, that's forgivable too, at least it was just water and we all have our clumsy moments. So the real reason for my low rating? The wait for our food was ridiculous. We waited over one hour for our food, and we didn't even order that much (one person in my party only ordered chips and guacamole). But to top it off, they ran out of a lot of dishes. Some were not available when we ordered, which we were told about, and that's understandable. But after waiting over 70 minutes for our food, the entree I had ordered was simply replaced with two other dishes. That's right, not once did anyone come by during the at least SEVENTY-MINUTE wait (the cooks must have known that they could not make my dish way before that) to ask if I would rather order something else, they just went ahead and substituted food for me. I can understand a restaurant feeling bad and giving a few dishes on the house as a courtesy, but I have NEVER encountered a restaurant that simply replaced your food with random other things. What if they replaced your dish with something you didn't eat (e.g. you are vegetarian) or were allergic to? Are you supposed to wait another 70+ minutes after placing a new order? Granted, they did not end up charging me for my original entree, but I still feel like this gross negligence deserved a little more acknowledgement by staff that they made an error, plus a sincere apology. The menu may be cute with its Illinois silhouette and red star where Chicago is located, but a fun menu doesn't make up for poor food. The food that did come was just mediocre too, certainly not worth such a long wait (but edible enough that I still give this establishment two stars instead of just one). Perhaps part of the problem is that the kitchen just cannot accommodate such a large volume of orders, since I'm sure most of the year it is too cold for outside dining. Still, this would be a problem that should be accounted for before opting to expand dining to OVER HALF of your total capacity outdoors. Sorry that I didn't take more photos of the food, we were so starving by the time our food came that we devoured most of the dishes and I forgot to take a picture of the first set that arrived. Overall, I could not believe the experience I had at Red Door. Average service, an unreasonably long wait, and substituting food without warning or eliciting our input made for one of my worst meals ever.  I usually Yelp places beforehand, and granted, my friend picked this place, not me, but the average rating is still three stars! Some other reviews have mentioned a great brunch, so perhaps they serve up a food-orgasmic brunch here, but for me, this is one of the very, very few places I say NEVER AGAIN. P.S. The check-in offer of 1 free truffled kale chips? I was already suspicious when I noticed kale chips were not even on the menu, but I still asked about it. The waitress checked on it for me and said it was not available. She didn't offer anything else in its place, but just said ""I don't know why it says that on Yelp."" I suggested they update/remove the check-in offer, but as I am writing this review about one week after dining at the Red Door, the check-in offer of kale chips is still there... P.P.S. On a lighter note, I found the restroom signs amusing. The men's restroom has picture of a rooster, and the female a cat. If you look carefully (it is a bit dark in that area), there is also a letter ""M"" on the men's room and ""W"" on the women's room, but otherwise, I guess you are just supposed to associate rooster = ""cock"" with men and felines are somehow feminine?",0.9916,0.831,0.109,0.06,0.4574445175078086

2016-04-09,1.0,"This was a terrible, really terrible experience! I bought a Gilt City deal for 59$ for a 4 course dinner with a wine pairing for each course for 2. On paper it seemed a very good deal, but in reality it was just a waste of money and time... I saw their menu before going there and I saw also what was written on the deal. It was written nowhere that we could not choose our dishes but when we arrived, our waiter immediately told us that it was a tasting menu. We were fine with that although it was not expected.  According to Gilt City description, we were going to get ""Start your chef's dinner for two with a ""snack,"" like bacon-wrapped artichokes with bleu cheese and romesco. Dishes like chicken confit poutine and wild mushroom quinoa are perfect for sharing, while pastas like spaghetti carbonara make for an indulgent third course. Round out your meal with entrees like hanger steak with grilled knob onions, and ricotta gnocchi with Brussels sprouts."" The reality was veeery different.... the only thing that we got same as what Gilt City described was the bacon rapped artichokes. It was ok, I think it would be 2/5. The bacon was so overpowering that if it was artichoke or gym shoes, it would have been the same.  Then, we got a kale salad with nuts and apples. Again, ok... maybe it was the best dish of the night and I said it all because,  let's be honest, as good as you can do kale, it is still kale... Then, we got a jambalaya. I am not a jambalaya expert, but definitely I can tell you that it was a very poorly executed jambalaya. Plus, the rice was totally undercooked... And, then, to conclude the ""amazing"" experience, they brought us dessert... you would expect that it must be a very good dessert to substitute a hunger steak but it was a little french toast... seriously??? A french toast for dinner?? And it was also a bad french toast... I never went to a restaurant before where I had a poorly executed french toast for dinner.  Besides the food being bad, they didn't respect the deal. I look at the deal and I had some expectations. The reality was way different from the expectations. I thought that when a restaurant prepares deals with Groupon or Gilt City is to enlarge their number of customers, not to shrink it! And this is definitely going in the wrong way...

2016-02-20,1.0,"Wow... I am so disappointed to have to write a bad  review for this joint. First of all, I have always wanted to love Red Door-- I had my first date with my boyfriend here and we loved it. Great drinks, awesome time, and it holds a special place in our hearts. That was just for drinks on a cold, empty Tuesday night.  We've come back to try brunch twice now. First time was okay-- the weather was great, and we enjoyed the sun and our drinks on the patio with our dog. My boyfriend's and my food was satisfactory, but his mom's eggs came out stone cold. When brought to our waiter's attention, we simply got a scoff. When our food was finally replaced some time later, her eggs were still cold. Literally no different than the previous dish. Okay. Bad days happen. We can forgive and forget.  Naturally we gave Red Door another chance; it is, after all, just down the street. We could not have been more disappointed.  Saturday brunch was pathetic. It took over 15 minutes to even get our drink order taken-- all we wanted were mimosas. After another 15 minutes we got our drink and put in our order. We waited patiently. We had our drinks refilled twice (though it took quite a while each time) and still no sign of food. The 6-top next to us got 5 of 6 entrees, and we watched the poor 6th girl wait for her food for over 10 minutes. By the time she got her omelet, her friends were all done. This did not bode well. After we had been there for over 90 minutes after ordering, my boyfriend called our waiter over to ask about our food. He said he'd check for us. After a bit he returned to say they had ""lost our ticket"" and had no answer about when/if we'd actually be getting our food. He offered to comp our drinks, but after so long we just had to leave. I've literally never walked out of a restaurant until this experience.  I'm a cook, and probably one of the hardest patrons to anger in a restaurant situation. I always give the benefit of the doubt, but this was just absolutely absurd. I've never been so disrespected WHILE receiving awful service.

However, a staff member was really accommodating and found us a table within 5 minutes.  Our server was nice as well. We got mimosas, and I got the red door burger. It was okay. For the price of it, I expected to be blown off my feet. My friend got the lamb hash, and that was pretty good- something different.

2016-02-04,2.0,"There are many factors that contributed to my bad experience here, and any one of them could be different if you choose to try this restaurant. However, my experience was not very good.  Food: 4 stars Service: 2 stars Atmosphere: 1 star $ value: 1 star We were there on a week night during restaurant week. We arrived at 830pm. The place was dark and loud. Dark is OK, and loud is even alright, but the main source of noise was a stereo that was playing extremely loud, fast, stressful punk metal. Everyone had to yell to talk to each other, and the tension and intensity of the music was very stressful and unpleasant, especially the longer it played, and the later it got on a week night, and combined with the other problems.  After our 830 arrival, we waiting for maybe 5 minutes for someone to come talk to us, then were seated at a high top near the door. The waiter asked what drinks we wanted, and then took 15 minutes to bring a can of beer for the one person who ordered a drink.  We placed our orders around 9, then the real waiting began. It was a 3-course fixed menu. We ordered all three courses at the same time. It honestly felt as though the cooks were making each tables meal and then moving to the next table, then the next, etc. there are maybe 8 or 10 tables in the place, so we could easily watch this succession of service. I remarked that ""they must have a small kitchen."" Finally, around 930, we got our first course, which we gobbled up quickly as they were small and we were hungry. Then we waited another 25 minutes to receive our entrees at around 10. Finally, we were trying to get the bill, when our desserts--which we had almost forgotten about--came out at 1030.  The fixed price for each person was $33--very steep for the food and especially the service/atmosphere. A similar appetizer, burger, and dessert would cost $20 tops at many other nice, good, quiet places in town.  The waiter apologized for the service when she brought the check, and said that the chef had sent all but one person home from the kitchen, and she had been the only person serving/bussing, and the bartender was the only person behind the bar. This sort of excuses each of them for being slow since they had to run the whole place, but the fact remains that the experience was not good and I will probably not return to this place. Also, no excuse for the extremely loud, stressful music. Or, maybe it just wasn't my scene and others really enjoyed it.",-0.662,0.835,0.081,0.084,0.5363046757164404
2016-02-01,1.0,"This is the first time I've ever felt the need to yelp because it was the first time I've ever walked out of a restaurant because the wait staff (and I'm guessing here) forgot about us. All I wanted this morning was a Bloody Mary. My girlfriend and I are new to the area, so we decided to check out Red Door. It was pretty busy, which is always a good sign, but we were sat in the back room within 5 minutes. Took a little less than 10 minutes after sitting for somebody to take a drink order. A coffee and a Bloody Mary. Awesome A little over 15 minutes passed before we finally agreed that this was ridiculous. Nobody even came back who we could tell that we had been waiting this long. Maybe our server got cut and just never passed our table over to somebody. Maybe he wasn't a server at all, and just wanted to know what we wanted to drink out of innocent curiosity. Maybe he got lost. We can't be sure. We walked out. I seriously think that server had also walked out, because I did not see him anywhere. I looked over at the bar to see if there was a Bloody Mary waiting to go out, but there wasn't. Luckily, ""toast"" was still open. No Bloody Mary, but the service was great. Long story short, I was very bummed out. It's not unheard of for a mistake to be made and a table to be forgotten. It's a letdown that this experience happened on my first trip to Red Door. Honestly, I'll probably try it again, because I live very close and the patio looks awesome. I just hope the drink can make it outside.",-0.2837,0.776,0.104,0.12,0.5419472502805837
2016-01-27,4.0,"Red door a quaint walk-up with tasty gastropub fare.  For me, it's much like the restaurant that occupied this same space before it. (Duchamp)  (RW2016 review below) Small kitchen with small plates which pack a great bite of flavor.  Finely crafted cocktails with a fanciful mixture of boozy ingredients which aim to put you in a happy place before that first plate arrives.  (This all dependant on how busy they're stocked) Their cocktails aren't quite ""Billy Sunday"" good but at $10 dollars apiece are worth the expenditure. I mean that's all that is needed for any patron to truly enjoy their meal, right?  Especially in an neighborhood where fancy cocktails could go as high as $12 or $14, just mere blocks away. Back to their plates which it's all about.  From time to time it would seem that their flavor and brilliance seem to change much alike their ""ticket times"".  On one occasion you may have your first  drink in hand and be able to nosh on your Whitefish toast. Then on a different day, you might have a second drink in hand and wonder how much longer it could take before a plate actually arrived ? I like enjoying that first drink for a time (Sazerac or an Old Fashioned).. then tasting a few plates and then having a post-meal cocktail.  If I imbibe more than one, I'm bar-hopping the hood skipping around Bucktown / WP till daylight.  But if I'm good, then it's definitely a two drink maximum. Some plates are fantastic and may cause you to order a second.  This has happened to me a few times.  Then there's other stuff which causes you to wonder.. Should I send this back? The venue hasn't (seemed to) change much from the previous proprietors. For instance I'm glad they left the austere experience felt in their Men's room. The Stucco walls seem to keep the space warm in the colder seasons, definitely a good feeling which unfortunately isn't always the case in restaurant restrooms.  Now about RW2016. The menu looked interesting so we were eager. We three dined the previous weekend. All three bought into the restaurant week menu and ordered DIFFERENT items for sharing.  Seriously look at all these threes. I didn't realize how much that could play into our dinner experience. Like bad luck I tell ya.   Whenever I read or watch a TV show detailing a grim experience of waiting 3 hours for dinner I always think ""Not me..I'd bounce the F--K out!"" Good thing they liquored us up first..  Dinner took slightly over 3 hours. In their defense, there was a bridal shower which took up about 60% of their business, the rest of the area was filled with diners wanting to partake of their RW menu.  When we were seated we were told we were the last that could eat.  Because food stocks were running low and that would be it for the night.   What was good? Smoked Whitefish toast was surprisingly yummy and the pan seared Foie gras with maple-sausage gravy was seriously killer.  I had to order a second. I may have to stop by one more time and have it again before RW ends. And the baby octopus was dry.  Second course will go quick since the star was the Slagel farms burger with bacon onion jam. (Bacon onion jam a condiment making its circles currently in NYC's food scene. A condiment which seems to meander time) And third.. well the Pot of Caramel was already gone despite putting our order in from the get go. So, we were left with ancho-chili sorbet with large berries and a plate of artisanal cheese and preserves. Both desserts were perfect enders. Unfortunately since the burger was the only winning 2nd course which we split 3 ways, we were left hungry. My buddy had a burrito at the crib and I stopped for a fish sandwich elsewhere. NO BS.  Foodies tend to (often) say that RW can suck ass.  It can be a trying time for restaurants because of how busy it gets, as well as a plethora of other reasons.  For the most part I agree. However, there are some occasions when a restaurant is running a tight game and the overall feeling of it is wonderful. This is why I'll keep hitting Restaurant week and hoping.",0.9984,0.766,0.174,0.06,0.42503012048192773
2016-01-25,5.0,"What a great restaurant week choice! My friend organized a Sunday dinner here (about 14 people)  and it was fantastic. The attention to detail and the food here were superb! The chef also came out to greet us which was also an added bonus.  I had been to the restaurant/bar on one other occasion to celebrate a friends engagement. That time though I only had drinks.  I was excited to finally get to try the food. I ordered off of the restaurant week menu. Here are the courses I got: First Course: Grilled Baby Octopus and Fingerling Potatoes - I'm not eating octopus all the time, but I totally wasn't disgusted by the texture. The presentation was beautiful and the potatoes were a great combination. As a side note the other three appetizer choices for restaurant tasting menu were fantastic as well. If I had to do it all over again the Eggplant Parmesan was my favorite. Warning though the portion sizes are big enough to be an entrée! Second Course: I went with the Lobster Papprdelle - Really good, but a little on the luke warm side. Again the flavor was great and the smoked bacon pieces made by day! Dessert: Salted Caramel Pot De Crème - This was just okay. I'm not really into creamy desserts, but this one looked the best out of the other two choices. I have to mention they treated us to Foie Gras biscuits with gravy and seriously that had to of been my favorite part of the meal! I'm still thinking about it.

2015-07-22,5.0,"Gotta update my review based on some really good experiences I've had here lately. Whether late at night, early afternoon, having a big meal or only drinking, Red Door has been there for me in the best way. One Saturday afternoon my boyfriend and I were here for a drink or two and they were giving out free shot sized samples of a new cocktail they were trying out. If the bottom of your cup had a black dot on it, you got a full sized cocktail for free! I can't remember exactly what the cocktail was, but it was great. It is kind of a shame that they don't have any beers on draft here because it sucks paying almost as much for one beer ($6-$9 generally) as you would for a 6 pack, but their bottles and cans list is long. And good. And arranged roughly by type/style of beer. So that's a real plus. Some great dishes we've had lately include the always delicious kale chips (free for checking in) and the kale salad, which has avocado, strawberries and feta and is a perfect size for a lighter meal. The bacon wrapped artichokes are good if served hot... It's just a shame you only get two because I could eat a lottttt of these. The fried green tomato BLT is my favorite dish I've had of late. Get it. It's huge. The Red Door burger will be ordered by my boyfriend every single time without hesitation; he doesn't even need a menu. The fact that the menu changes so often is both a blessing and a frustration, as its fun to try new dishes but many are so good that I want to get them again, and come here specifically hoping they will have them! The outdoor patio is also THE best place to enjoy a meal on a summer evening in Bucktown. I have really grown to love you, Red Door.",0.9971,0.73,0.226,0.044,0.5240589121023904

Decor was fun, it was extremely crowded (which I was surprised to see after some other recent reviews) and it is MUCH smaller than I thought/pictured/imagined/assumed. We were seated in an awkward booth right by the door, in which we were not able to sit two and two across from each other at the table traditionally, due to having to leave space for servers and patrons to walk through. The menu is very small, and boasts ""sharables.""  Let me tell you - these sharables are large enough to make a meal out of.  When I think sharables, I think tapas - small bites.  You order 2 per person and have enough food for all. It would've been nice if our server (who decided she didn't need to wear a bra to work that day, gross) had told us we ordered WAY TOO MUCH FOOD while we were placing the order, rather than when it was all being dropped off at the table.  I was pretty off-put by her lack of professionalism in that respect (the bra, and failing to tell us we we were over-ordering.) The main thing I ate was the Bulgogi marinated spare ribs - which I as of one week later are no longer on the menu, and I found to be way too salty.  The mussels we ordered (also no longer on the menu) were nice - they had a great green curry broth. The avocado toast was nothing to write home about, and was served on extremely burnt bread.  I'm shocked that the chef let it leave the kitchen. I don't know that I'd be back.",0.7906,0.86,0.075,0.065,0.508920634920635

The portions were also quite large. The kale chips were way too greasy and honestly I'm not sure how someone would finish a bowl. This was the only miss in terms of food.  We also got the burger and the gnocchi. The burger was juicy and cooked well. The gnocchi was on a whole different level. Each piece was pan seared to perfection and the butter sauce was everything and more. The only reason this place doesn't have more stars is the service.

I came here twice. Once last spring and once last summer. The food was delicious, and I loved it the first time. I loved it so much that I brought my French exchange student there when he stayed with us in July.  We ordered lots of small plates, that both my exchange  student, my brother, and his fiancé and I shared. The last thing we ordered were two burgers. My French friend and I split one, and my brother and his fiancé split one. I also had some of their burger because I liked it so much. To our dismay, the three of us who had a bite of one burger had to be hospitalized because of such terrible food poising.  It lasted five days and we had to be put on medicine for weeks. Luckily, because my French exchange student didn't have a bite of the second burger, he didn't get what we believe to be salmonella. Please be cautious when eating here.

We pretty much had to beg for our second and third glasses. It wasn't even busy, but there was lots of frenetic running around and acting exasperated from the bartender. Apparently having customers to wait on was getting in the way of his dishwashing.

2015-05-08,1.0,"I have gone to Red Door twice, and my first experience was fine. I remember the service taking a while, but it was also very busy. I enjoyed the food and the drinks and wanted to come back.  My last experience was probably the worst dining experience I have ever had. Despite having a reservation, I was in the establishment for 1 hour (65 mins) without being served so much as a glass of water.  Thursday night 5/7/15 at 8:25- I came in early for my 9pm reservation to grab a drink at the bar. Upon entering, the room was empty, except a line of 9-10 people waiting to be seated. Granted, most were waiting it sit in their outdoor area (which is very nice). The host was absent for almost 10 mins and everyone was wondering what was going on. He seemed overwhelmed, but was running back and forth to seat people outside. Instead of standing, I went to the bar to grab a drink. 15-20 minutes went by without being acknowledged by the bar tender. He seemed overworked and overwhelmed as well. I told the host I had a reservation once the line went down, but I asked to just sit at the bar and not wait for outdoor seating. The bar tender finally approached me after 25 mins of waiting, and I told him I wanted to use my Guilt City 4 course meal voucher. His response was ""the drinks come out with the courses."" He quickly walked away and I had no chance to respond. I waited for another 10 mins of being ignored at the bar, unsure if he put in my order or if he was coming back. I finally said something to the host- asking if there was a waiter for the tables inside, because I wanted to change seats. ""Do you not want a waiter?"" Was his response. I was baffled and said, ""No, I want to order something!"" No one apologized, or seemed to concerned with getting me and my date to service. He said he would get us set up in a minute, and walked out back. We waited, still no eye contact from the bar tender, and then just got up and sat ourselves at 9pm at table behind the bar. Another 15 mins go by, without anyone approaching the table. It is now 9:15, and we have not even been provided food menus or water. My girlfriend then went up to the host again telling him we had reservations and wanted to order the Guilt City. He said he would find our waiter and tell him. The waiter came back at 9:25 asking him to give him one minute and he will be back to help us. 9:30pm- After watching him walk in and out of the back a few times, we left.  I have never been treated so poorly at a restaurant, especially in Chicago with a plethora of choices and competition. I hope this was a one time thing, and maybe they were severely understaffed. But this says- poor service, lack of awareness, and bad management. I would not recommend this place, and I am certain I will never return.

The second time I visited you was for a birthday brunch with 30 people.  Total fail. My food wasn't complete when you served it to me and actually had to get sent back twice since each time important components to my food were missing.  I clearly was the last one eating at the party and didn't finish since everyone was done before my order was even correct.  You felt bad and comped my mean which I was truly grateful for so I decided I'd come back again. Boy oh boy, Red Door, our third encounter was just awful. We got there when it opened for brunch and had to wait for all of the reservations to be seated first.  Cool, no worries, you said the wait would be 15 minutes.  We sat at the bar.  25 minutes later you let us know it would be another 15 minutes tops until we got our table.  You were unprepared for the crowd and did not have enough staff.  Tables were still open but no one could serve them. Finally after 45 minutes of sitting at the bar we give up hope of getting a table. We decided to order.  An hour and 45 minutes after arriving our food came. WHOA. Not cool.

2014-12-14,4.0,"Dined here last night and enjoyed the experience. Only reason Red Door doesn't get 5-stars is that I agree with other reviewers in that it's slightly overpriced for what it is, and our food was starting to cool by the time it hit our table, which leads me to believe that the kitchen works more efficiently that our server. Drinks- about $10 a pop for mixed drinks. I had 3 and wasn't even buzzed, so I'm going to politely, yet strongly, disagree with anyone claiming the bartenders here have a stiff hand. Apps- Bacon wrapped artichoke was a 3.5 (bacon was a little too fatty and you could barely taste the artichoke); truffle kale was a 3 (great flavor but the pieces on the bottom were saturated in oil); olives and almonds were a 4 (not much to say about these as you can't really screw up a bowl of olives). Entrees- Butternut squash gnocchi is a 4 (delicious but the serving size was too small for the price); NY Strip steak with chimichurri was a 4 (amazing flavor and perfectly cooked, and the sweet potato chorizo hash was incredible, but not worth $26). I'll give this place a try for brunch on the patio in the spring/summer, but if nothing about that stands out, I probably won't be coming back here. For the location, price range, food, and service, there are other places that do it better.",0.9675,0.872,0.112,0.016,0.4648809523809524
2014-12-14,2.0,"This review is just based on the service and not on the food, because we actually didn't eat here. My husband and I went here on Saturday night, intending to use a Gilt City deal for food and wine pairings for two. We'd never been to Red Door before but live in the neighborhood, so we were excited to try it out. We made a reservation and were seated right away. The place was pretty full, and it was really cute inside with red candles on the tables and a Christmas tree.  Our waitress came over, and I told her about our Gilt City deal. She told me that I couldn't use the deal because it was expired. I told her that it wasn't, and hunted around on my phone to find it so I could show her the expiration date. Then she disappeared into the kitchen and then came back out and told me that the deal wasn't good on Saturdays. All of this with a completely flat affect, too. Not ""I'm sorry, but I'm afraid it isn't good on Saturday."" But just, ""You can't use that on Saturday."" I checked the fine print and saw that she was right that it wasn't good on Saturday. I was a little annoyed since I had made the reservation at 11:00 that morning and had noted that we intended to use the Gilt City deal, so it seemed as if someone from the restaurant could have let me know that it wouldn't be allowed before we came down there. But, it did say that it wasn't allowed on Saturday in the fine print and I should have read it, so I didn't push it.  Since the deal was due to expire in a few days and we knew we wouldn't be able to come back, and since we already had a table there, my husband and I asked the waitress if it would be okay to just use the amount we'd paid for the voucher toward our bill (so basically, we asked her if we could pretend that the voucher had already expired). The waitress just flat-out said no, once the voucher expires you can't use it. So I had to show her the part on the voucher that says that after it expires it can be redeemed for whatever you paid for it at the place that issued it for a period of five years. Rather than take my word (or Gilt City's word?) for it, she actually took my phone and disappeared back into the kitchen, and then came out and mumbled something about us having to come Tuesday through Friday. (Which is not the rules according to Gilt City, but whatever.) So my husband and I looked at each other and said, ""Ok...so I guess you're saying we have to come back another time...?"" The waitress just shrugged. We were done dealing with someone who clearly did not care whether we came or went, so we went! And we wound up having a great dinner at Dove's Luncheonette, another new spot we'd never tried. I should note, though, that the host was much better at his job and he did ask us why we were leaving and tell us he was sorry that it didn't work out while we were on our way out the door. Too bad he hadn't been our waiter, it might have been a very different night! I totally get that the kitchen might just not have been prepped to do the deal that we bought the voucher for and I should have read it carefully and come on the right night. But, I did mention the deal when I made the reservation, and they could have called and told me that it wasn't going to be possible. And I think that our offer to just treat the voucher as expired and redeem just the amount that we paid for it and order off the menu was perfectly fair. It wasn't a cheap voucher and I'd like to redeem the money at some point, but the idea of going back down there and trying to explain the rules about expired vouchers to this waitress all over again just makes me exhausted.",0.9702,0.879,0.072,0.048,0.5078609806269381

Can't wait to.go back and try these in full! The host who greeted us at the door and showed us to our table was very kind and a funny guy also.

The place is cute, with kind of an odd layout with a large seating area in the back adjacent to what looked like a super cute patio (too cold for today though).  The music was good, though they oddly turned it up pretty loudly as our area cleared out.  More importantly, the food: I ordered the duck confit chilaquiles & they were worth killing for.  Seriously.  Fantastic meat, crispy corn tortilla strips, a generous portion, and most importantly, a HUGE scoop of guac!  They definitely didn't skimp.  Plus, for only $11, I definitely can't complain about the portion size.  Additionally, the steak & eggs were flavorful & again great portion sizing, and our French friend gave the croque madame his stamp of approval.  Even the fruit bowl was delicious--real fruit, not a canned cocktail.   I'll definitely be back!",0.9978,0.607,0.331,0.062,0.6149553571428571

2014-10-26,3.0,"Well, this really was a step backward.  The gf and I went here to celebrate our anniversary as this is where we had our first date.  We did the beer/food pairing, and it was very disappointing.  I really wanted to like this, but they wouldn't let me.  First, the service was a step down from last time.  The first course came out and the drinks trailed by a couple minutes, so, not much of a pairing, and it was a VERY long wait between the second and third courses.  And in general the service was just very indifferent.  A big letdown from our first experience.  Second, and a BIG second, the food was unrealized potential.  The first course was basin-wrapped artichoke hearts in a romesco sauce.  The flavors were good, but the bacon was fatty and undercooked to the point that my gf had a hard time chewing it.  The second course was octopus with duck fat and potato ""slab.""  The server called it a potato pancake, but it was really just a few slices of potato layered together.  The octopus was poorly done, with the ends being burned and the thicker parts being underdone and rubbery.  The third course was pork belly and kimchi.  This was probably the best dish, but it was also the simplest.  Slab of pork belly on a bed of kimchi.  The kimchi was decent, but the pork belly seemed to have been sitting in the kitchen for a bit.  It was done just well enough to enjoy, but when a dish is that simple with really two ingredients, the ingredients should be done very well.  And the fourth course was  muy horrible.  A Sprecher's root beer float with butter pecan ice cream.  A simply awful combination.  My gf and I made the same grimace when we took our first bites.   It really is sad, because, aside from the dessert, the flavors were close and the concepts were good.  If the dishes realized their potential, this place could be a real gem.  As it is, the highlight is the exceptional beer list.  It's not the biggest, but it really does have some great choices.  We'll probably try again in 6 months and see if they've gotten it together.",0.9462,0.848,0.096,0.057,0.388042328042328

I've been to the Red Door two times now - once for brunch and once for drinks at night.  The food I had during brunch was really good - I had the steak and eggs with kimchi, along with a side of house potatoes, and I was not disappointed.  The steak was cooked really well, and the kimchi was spicy and tangy, just how I like it.  I was with a girlfriend for brunch, and we decided to do the bottomless mimosa dealie (it's not on-menu, but if you ask for it, they should still have it).  Kids - when there is a bottomless mimosa deal for $11 bucks, you know you are probably not getting the most quality of of champagne, but the Red Door's mimosas actually tasted pretty good (good balance between the bubbly and the OJ).  Queue 5 pitchers of mimosas later split between my friend and I.. and then a shot for some stupid reason.  Needless to say, I felt like DEATH the next day.  But that's not the Red Door's fault, we apparently just have no self control. The second time I came was just for drinks on a date.  We sat at the bar and drank our way through a few beers and one of their cocktails - all great tasting.  We kept meaning to get some food to snack, but never got around to ordering it until after 11 when the kitchen closed.  Ah well, next time. I'm docking two stars (well in an ideal world, it would have been a star and a half) because the service here is REALLLLLLLY slow.  Especially when I came for brunch, we sat out back on the patio (super cute btw) and I think we were well through our second pitcher of mimosas before we got our food.  Also, the staff is a little strange here - friendly enough but they have sort of a dead-in-the-eyes look when interacting with patrons. Tip: if you check in on Yelp you get a free order of their truffled Kale chips (at least right now they're offering this dealie).

2014-09-05,4.0,"I've been here three times. Once for a Yelp event, which left me with very mixed feelings on the place, once for an ill-timed dinner, and once for an actual meal.  My first visit, for a Yelp event, was to be blunt a clusterf@ck of epic proportions. I'm not sure where the wheels fell off the wagon, but it was under staffed, over booked and an all-around hot mess. That said, the food I got to try was delicious and the patio, alluring. We returned, finally, two years later and about 5 minutes too late for dinner. Annoying because we learned this after sitting down, perusing the menu and picking out our drinks and dinner. In Red Door's defense, they were quite apologetic and offered suggestions where we could find a meal in the general vicinity.  Third time's the charm; we finally were able to bask in the patio and enjoy a meal. We weren't really in a sharing mood and tackled the menu separately. We each started with a drink; the cocktail menu is small and I can't recall exactly what we each ordered (the website menus are out of date), but they were good.  He started with the heirloom tomato salad with bleu cheese; a week after our meal, he's still raving about that salad and this comes from a dyed in the wool carnivore. For his main, he enjoyed a full slab of the bulgogi short ribs; also good he reports, but he's not waxing poetic about them a week later. I started out with a dish I tasted at that Yelp event, a bowl of elote. More of a dessert-ish dish with the corn's sweetness complimented by the spice of the chili powder, it was fantastic. It's an ample portion, designed for sharing. For my main, I went with the ahi poke. A delicious balance of flavors - sweet, spicy, fresh. It reminded of the first time I had poke in Costa Rica.  The patio about triples the size of the interior and to me is the only place to be. While I quite enjoyed our food and the small, eclectic menu, the patio is what would bring me back.

2014-08-11,5.0,"Preface: I just moved to Bucktown from Lakeview, and Red Door was my first eat out place in the new hood.  That being said, one might assume that I have high expectations. I went to Red Door on Saturday morning for Brunch with my boyfriend, and two friends from out of town. Having been slightly hungover, and a little nervous because I hadn't ever eaten there and I wanted to impress my friends obviously, Red Door came through!  I got the French toast special, my boyfriend got the pork belly (I think?) bagel ma-jig, and my two friends ordered the burger and the (crab/whitefish) eggs Benedict. One of the major things I enjoyed about Red Door/the menu was that all the entrees were $11. And the portions were a great amount for the money.  If I could rate half stars, I would rate 4.5 on behalf of the atmosphere, as in the people who were eating there at our table (yes their tables are hibachi style or whatever, where other people sit with you), but that didn't really bother me in particular, it was the two annoying girls who were sitting next to us. Which let's be real, doesn't affect the taste of the food, but it should be noted that I would the consider this place to be... Rustic meets hip. Not necessarily a bad thing.

2014-07-24,1.0,"As I read over the reviews for the restaurant,  the negative reviews had one common thread. The service was awful. Also I am a middle aged foody eating in restaurants of all calibers for many many years. And before you read why i gave Red Door 1 star, let me say this is a restaurant  in Chicago, where great service and delish food can be found everywhere. Especially in this neighborhood. Red Door is not somewhere I'll ever go again.  7 pm reservations, 7pm arrival. 7/23/2014  I noticed the female server was flustered as soon as we sat down. We had a 5 year old with us also. The place was not busy. Our server came to the table and began to say something. There were 8 of us. Two mature men seated at the other end of the table, one is a bit hard of hearing. We asked her to speak up because of that reason and she did but that end of the table still didn't hear her. Again it was clear that she was going to do nothing extra like repeat what she said. I hear my son order, his meal and the meal of his son. Also the menu is NOT at all kid friendly. The server is taking orders, she stops at the 5 year old and says while looking at me ""he wants a grilled cheese and fries?"" I say, ""is that what his Dad already ordered?"" Im not sure why shes asking. Hmm? Everyone at the table clearly orders, burgers, ribs, calamari, apps, etc. Its perhaps 7:30. Finally at approx. 8:30 the grilled cheese and fries arrive. We are all perplexed, what's the hold up with dinner. By this time the restaurant is full.  We ask whats going on with the food? She says ""the burgers are thick and take long."" An hour? It is suggested they are butterflied by someone at the table. The service and server are just ridiculous. An app comes out, avocado on toasted bread with some kind of cherries, very good. And then nothing. We find out the burgers were given to another table. What? Its 9:15, I'm done, i am actively asking the table, saying this is not okay lets leave, no one really wants to offend. The server comes and says ""i know its taking long,"" i say ""something should be comped"". She looks dumbfounded. She and the guy who is just haphazardly bringing food out, bring out trays of food. We can see burgers and ribs,  yet they are walking towards the patio. Im done. I get up noticing they are shuffling back towards the kitchen with the trays, when we run into each other (at 9:45) and she says its your food! And I say that ""clearly this entire order should be comped!"" ""Well"" she says ""you'll have to speak with the chef."" No you speak to the chef. Clearly he should not be leaving the kitchen the service in the front and back house are terrible. Please don't take him away from an already inefficient area. But i say okay lets speak to the chef. 10 mins i wait, no chef. But in the mean time she has gone to our table. left me standing in a private area, and told the table the bill was comped. BUT WAIT!! An entree that was ordered was completely left off the order, so my Daughter in law was left without her meal. Yes that really happened. The chef finally came out with the bill he was clearly agitated, he said there was confusion and he was under the impression we were in a leisurely state, and there was miscommunication with his server. Under the impression? Please don't be under any impression ad please dont't assume. Just ask. I told him ""I'm sorry? What?""Your server told us our burgers were given away to another table."" The chef then said that that was ""neither here nor there."" Wait! What? I retreated and was defeated. And on second thought i am also assuming this was the chef as he never introduced himself to us. I would think that a manager, chef, owner wants to know how to keep their business alive and thriving. The way that restaurants open and close in months time is amazing in Chicago. Sadly this place could be great. But it wont be. Not with a server like ours and not with a kitchen that has a chef taking two hours to complete meals, and not with the disinterest Red Door has in its cliental.",0.7984,0.839,0.078,0.082,0.4522699652777777

So keep that in mind if you are trying to start your weekend early like I was.  My next visit was to try their brunch. We sat on the patio, which was a great oasis from the city. Communal seating at long picnic tables and the patio is dog friendly. I don't have a dog but I enjoyed playing with the little guy under our table who was with another group.  The bottomless mimosas are not on the menu but just ask and, for just $11, there is no end to your mimosa supply until you say when. I recommend having NOTHING else to do for the rest of the day if you choose this option though.  The food was wonderful. I had the bacon and eggs with roasted tomato and my friend and I split a ""side"" of pancakes, which were two huge fluffy pancakes. My friend got the steak and eggs, which come with kimchi. She loved it.  The food was so good that when another friend wanted to do brunch the next day, I went back for round two. I did not do bottomless mimosas this time. This time I ordered the brioche French toast with peaches. The best French toast I have ever had!  The wait staff is super nice and know the menu well.  Couple of down sides to keep in mind. 1. Although I loved my server, the service was on the slow side on both visits. 2. On my second visit, they were literally out of almost everything on the menu. She had to take a pen and mark up on the menu which few items they still had available. And I totally lucked out with the very last order of French toast.",0.9975,0.78,0.213,0.008,0.40236111111111117

The service was slow, and having worked in the service industry I am usually pretty forgiving, but I expect a little gesture.

I'm not sure what the hell was going on with the staff and kitchen today- and you know what? Not my problem. I'm a paying customer. If you can't serve food, DON'T serve food. If you're not able, then don't try. I have little time to hangout with friends and having bad service and making me feel lucky to be at your restaurant - I ain't got time for that. So, we finally get our food. AND GUESS WHAT??? Guess what what was on our plates with our steak and eggs??? POTATOES MIXED IN WITH THE STEAK. Heh?? It was supposed to come with kimchi. I asked the server why are their potatoes mixed in with my steak? She responded ""Oh, the chef must have run out of kimchi."" AND AND AND the steak was burnt and tasted rubbery.  Look, I know we all have off days. (I had steak and eggs here before and mine was great- my wife's were over done, but hey- at least it was half alright)  We all aren't our best all the time. But, if you can't do your job properly, seriously, please tell me that the kitchen has abruptly cold due to difficulties- I'd rather not waste my time otherwise. The whole staff was frazzled. Nice & Friendly- but in a major fritz. They did comp the steak and eggs after voicing my frustration. Which I appreciate the comp, I'm surprised they didn't comp the whole meal. Whatever was happening today I am never coming back EVER. Which is a bummer- because their outdoor space is nice, but then again- so are many other outdoor spaces in Chicago.

2014-02-09,3.0,"I came here with a friend for restaurant week.  Red Door is a neat place. When you walk in, you are in a very cool bar area with artistic lighting, and big, wooden booths.  The hostess greeted my friend and I, and led us down a long hallway, past the kitchen, past three bathrooms and a closet area, to a back room with more seating.  The back dining area has light blue painted walls, and wooden tables with white, red, and black metal chairs.  This room and the front dining area do not even look like they are in the same restaurant, and I wish they would have used the neat decor from the bar for the area in the back.  The front bar is what they have photos of on their website.  I cannot find photos of where we were seated. My friend and I each ordered a cocktail, and I thought they were good and reasonably priced.  I had the Lower Lights cocktail.  It was bitter and tart -- I loved it.  My friend had the Ballad of Boot HiIl, and he loved it as well. The Restaurant Week menu was very limited, in my opinion.  I don't eat dairy and every dish had a major dairy component.  There were not any dishes that had vegetables (I know, most of you will be happy about the no-vegetables thing), and there were a lot of dishes that came on top of purées.  None of these dishes were well-rounded, nor very creative or unique. The first course choices did not offer any light starters. My friend ordered Bulgolgi Pork Belly and I had the Beef Sirloin Tataki.  They tasted alright.  Mine was served cold on top of a sweet-potato purée and two little rice crispies bits.  It wasn't remarkable.  Friend said bulgolgi pork belly was good. For the second course, my friend had the Slagel Farm Burger, and I ordered the Pan Seared Diver Scallops.  My friend said the burger was good (though he only ate half of it and did not want to take the other half home).  The scallops were alright, slightly rubbery.  These were also on a purée (butternut squash). For dessert we each had the Nutella Panna Cotta.  This was a big serving for dessert, so that's a plus.   The service was good and I liked our waitress.  I do not want to return here to eat, but I would like to come back when the beer garden opens up in the back to share a few drinks with friends.",0.9834,0.833,0.128,0.04,0.4122359584859587

Next came my entree...my scallops came nested on a generously amount of butternut squash puree topped off with fresh watercrest.  They had a deep butter crust and were delicious!  My favorite was my nutella panna cotta that came with a snicker doodle type of cookie.  I was so full by then I was taking little bites to I could savor the rich chocolately hazel but goodness.   The server and bartender staff here are super friendly and amazing!  Our bartender was very attentive and nice to us our entire time there.  When I was debating on two different types of wine, he offered to let me have a taste of one of the wines.  And then when he saw that I was taking little bites of my dessert, he asked me if it the dessert was ok!   I assured him that the dessert was fantastic but I was just savoring every bite.  That type of service and attentiveness was much appreciated.   I really had an awesome time here and after this experience I hope to come back here soon!

The apps were probably the highlight - the bulgogi glazed pork belly and the goat cheese were both well-received at our table. The entrees were ok though portions were small particularly the scallops and truffle gnocchi. The burger seemed out of place but I appreciated being able to steal my table mate's fries. Dessert was so-so; Nutella panna cotta reminded my friends of normal chocolate pudding, and they seemed to have run out of plates as some of us were served with the square plate and others a saucer like plate.

They only offer one dessert which was a pot de creme so we passed.  Then we get the bill and she processed it without the deal so we had to send her back.  It was fine for us but by that time they seemed pretty busy.  She did a good job of replacing our plates (we had to keep our forks and knives) but the rest was the bare min.  The place is a great location, looks very nice inside, is good on paper, but I don't think we'll be back.",0.9921,0.852,0.118,0.029,0.5303819444444445

The staff is consistently slow and seemingly inexperienced. We live practically next door and have been here many times, but the most recent dining experience is what prompted me to write this review:  A few months ago my fiance and I went into the restaurant to schedule a reservation. We explained to the host that we are bringing our families there to meet for the first time, so we would like to be seated in the least noisy area of the restaurant. Everything started out fine, although the lighting was so dim no one could read their menus. A few minutes after we sat down, a bachelorette party was seated at the table next to us. Immediately they were incredibly loud and very, very drunk. Believe me, I get it, I am going to have a bachelorette party as well but I would NEVER do what they did next: As the bride recieved gifts from her bridesmaids, the party became louder and louder. She was gifted a pair of edible panties that she turned around to show a man who was on a date. After receiving a ""we are trying to eat dinner, sorry"" and a glare from his date, she turned to my soon to be mother in law. SHE HANDED MY MOTHER IN LAW HER EDIBLE PANTIES. At this point, we alerted the host and manager. They apologized and while we assumed they would move the party or ask them to keep it down, they did absolutely nothing. As we left, we reiterated that we did not have a pleasant experience. The host just sort of shrugged. I would not go back here again.

The host, however, decided to place our party of six all the way in the back for whatever reason, and it felt as if we were the only patrons in the restaurant since the front is split from the back. All the brunch menu items here were $11 a piece. I had the red door burger while others tried the steak and eggs, french toast, benedict, and meatball hash. Overall it was a pretty solid burger and the mustard that came on it was tangy and packed good flavor though the fries were pretty average. My girlfriend's steak and egg dish was cooked perfectly, and the side of kimchi it came with was a nice touch as well. I wished more of the dishes featured bacon because I had most of my friend's order which had a nice crispy and chewy texture. There are some weird things about this place: the heat seemed to have turned off midway through our meal, one of my chair legs kept falling into a hole that should've been a covered heating vent, and the food took a good 15+ minutes to come out given that we were the only party ordering food at the time.

There were couple other people waiting outside, but it was no where near the obnoxious lines you see outside other more ""trendy"" places. We had a reservation, but I don't know that we needed it. Our party of six was seated outside right away, at Red Door's adorable patio. We started with mimosas right away and they didn't stop coming. Bottomless definitely means bottomless at this place.  What stood out was that the food was actually good. At a lot of bottomless places the food is tasteless and basically just exists so that people don't get completely bombed at noon on a Sunday. Not the case at Red Door. My friends and I both order the lamb neck hash, which was amazing. The perfect balance of fresh veggies and potatoes with just enough lamb, and a perfectly fried egg on top. So good. Others ordered the steak and eggs, duck confit, and bacon and eggs. No complaints at all, and I wanted to try everything.  Our waitress was so friendly and put up with us for the multiple hours we hung out on the patio. The staff as a whole was really welcoming.

2013-09-01,2.0,"Went with a friend to brunch. We sat down right away and ordered the pork belly and the hanger steak w/ eggs, which I've had before. We waited a reasonable time after which our food was served to us.  The pork belly my friend ordered looked good but the Hanger Steak was burnt, dry and a little cold. I tried to get through it but it was impossible to eat and bland.  My friend commented that the pork belly wasn't all that great either and commented on the lack of seasoning. I finally told the waitress that my steak was dry and cold in which case she promptly took the plate back to the kitchen and had them redo it. I explained to her that I didn't need them to redo it because I didn't have much time to wait again for another meal, especially since my friend had finished his. In any case, she said that she would just have them work on it and put it in a box, if necessary. I gave in but was annoyed since I don't come to restaurants to sit in there for an hour while I wait to take my meal to go. After another fair amount of time, I just had her tell the kitchen to put it in a box.  When I got it the next time (in box of course), it looked much better. It was hot and cooked nicely. Why couldn't they do this before?!  The best part is when they brought us the bill. It still had my hanger steak on there, which I thought was extremely tacky considering they had me sit in the restaurant for over an hour to get a boxed meal to go. Any decent place would have taken it off.  While I thought about taking out my frustration on the tip, I decided to tip nicely but vowed to write this review.  Will I return in the future? Probably not. They need to seriously review their service. I used to really like this place but it has been steadily going down since last year. And it kinda smelled bad at a couple points inside. It was not appetizing. I really want to like you Red Door but you're making it impossible.

Champagne to OJ ratio was aggressive. Awesome.  Can you beat $22 for a breakfast entree and bottomless mimosas? Probs not. We went with a group of 7 and a reservation. The crowd wasn't huge, but I'd recommend a reservation with a larger party. Immediately, several carafes of mimosas were placed in front of us and these were constantly refilled throughout the meal. Unfortunately, I must have ordered wrong when it came to the food! The lamb neck hash looked phenom on paper: veggies, potato confit, chimichurri, lamb neck...what could be wrong? It was small in size and I found no potatoes, but wilted greens. Sad. I looked on longingly (getting the drunk munchies at this point) as omelets and benedicts with awesome looking breakfast potatoes were placed in front of my dining companions.

The service, again, was spotty. Our waitress was not rude, but definitely not overly friendly.

2013-07-15,1.0,"I'm sorry to say, but I went here recently with a group for brunch and, unfortunately, this was one of the most disappointing brunch experiences I've had in Chicago.  The short of it is that the service was very, very slow and generally poor and that the food was just ok.  As a result, I highly doubt we will ever return and, for one member of our party, I doubt we will ever be able to talk him into going to Sunday brunch again.   Things started out roughly - we had a reservation for 12:15 on a Sunday and, since it was a beautiful day, we were looking forward to sitting on Red Door's awesome looking patio.  One problem: our table was in the one spot on the patio that was in direct sunlight with ZERO shade and was approximately one million degrees.  Now, I can't blame Red Door for this being the first true hot, humid and sunny Chicago summer day all year, but it would be nice if you could at least have the option of finding some shade on the patio (or if they warned us before we sat down about the furnace we were about to enter).  No dice.  So that was strike one. Strike two came in the form of quite poor service.  As the sweat poured down our faces, we begged the waiter for some water.  We eventually received four glasses of water.  One problem: we had five people in our party.  Youch.  We attempted to track down more water - both in the form of an extra glass for our thirsty friend and refills for everyone else who was soaked in sweat, but it was rapidly becoming obvious that the staff was stretched very thin by the busy crowd - many of whom were taking full advantage of the bottomless Mimosas and tying down the few waiters with repeated orders for refills.  We placed our order after about 10-15 minutes and were a bit distressed to learn that 2 of the 10 or so items on the menu were not available, including what would seem like a brunch staple: French Toast.   Shortly after we placed our order, we were able to negotiate our way to a table that was in the shade and our experience suddenly improved.  But then, the waiting really began.  As we watched table after table around us be served, we continued to languish without attention from our server or, more importantly, our food being served.  After waiting over an hour - first two and then four of us received our orders.  But it took an extra five minutes or more for the fifth member of our party to be served their fairly basic order of bacon and eggs.  Our waiter did eventually apologize for the long wait for our food and offered to do whatever he could to make up for it - but didn't suggest anything in particular (like a free round of drinks or a discount on the check).  So that rung a bit hollow. The food was tasty and the portions were fairly generous - but I wouldn't say it was mind blowing.  Two things stood out here: first, I ordered a Wild Mushroom omelette in large part because it was supposed to include Cheese Curds (MMMMM, Cheese).  Thankfully for my cholesterol, but unfortunately for my enjoyment, the omelette was missing a critical ingredient: cheese of any variety, curd or otherwise.  Second, someone asked for toast - only to be told that they don't have toast.  Don't have Toast?  What kind of brunch restaurant doesn't have toast? The final strike came in the form of more waiting.  Around 2:00 - after an hour and a half of brunching  (much of the time without food) had already exhausted our patience, we tried to get the check.  It took about 20 minutes for us to locate our server and procure our check from him.  He told us that the check got messed up and switched with another table - but that ""it didn't matter because they ordered 5 entrees and so did we and they all cost the same price.""  He left our table before we could correct him and point out that one of our party ordered two sides and no entree.  Since it was only a $3 and we could only imagine how long we would have to wait for that mistake to be corrected, over two hours after we originally arrived we quickly scrapped together enough cash to cover our bill and a modest tip and beat a hasty retreat.",0.9567,0.821,0.097,0.083,0.49929274663451867

They're from rural Texas so a ""gastropub"" don't make no sense to them.

2013-04-05,2.0,"I went for the Easter brunch, which promised a three course prix fixe menu for $20. I was particularly attracted by the lobster Benedict--my boyfriend and I passed over other restaurant choices because I can never say no to lobster. We arrived and were seated after the bartender ""had to check to make sure they had enough ingredients left for the brunch,"" which I thought was strange, since they were advertising it on Facebook as being available 10 a.m. to 5 p.m., and it was only 2:45 at this point.  We were seated on the patio and our drinks orders were taken: a cocktail from the drink list for him and a Bloody Mary for me. When the Bloody Mary arrived, it was virtually undrinkable; we both tasted it and there was something in it that made it taste like gasoline or some other non-edible chemical. The server tasted it as well and immediately dumped it out, agreeing that there was something gross in it. I ordered a different drink even though she offered to replace it; I wasn't really excited about getting a Bloody Mary anymore. Neither of the next two drinks I ordered were available, although they were listed on the drink menu; both contained house-made sodas and I was told they had run out. Fine. Good to know after I had already looked at the menu and picked them out. Drink order attempt #4 (some kind of maple-bourbon-egg white cocktail) arrived quickly and was delicious.  We placed our order and I was informed that the lobster Benedict was now a ""shrimp mixed with lobster Benedict,"" which I wasn't thrilled about, but agreed to. We were eating our first course (strawberry and goat cheese salads) when the server arrived and told me that it was just straight-up shrimp Benedict now, no lobster at all. At this point I was pretty bent that nothing I wanted to order was actually available, and we should have just walked out then (I later regretted the decision not to leave at this point), but I reluctantly agreed to the shrimp.  When the Benedict arrived, it was lukewarm at best; I ended up not eating the shrimp because they just didn't taste that great (although this may have been me blaming the shrimp for not being lobster). My boyfriend got the mushroom omelet, which he said tasted good and was warm. The beignet for dessert was very good and was warmer than my eggs.  The server gave us 10% off the bill because they had run out of lobster, and I was not charged for the Bloody Mary; she did both of these things without us asking for it, which was appreciated. We had two different servers on the patio and both were friendly and gave good service.  I was really excited about this bar when it opened because it's right down the street from my house, and a dinner last summer was considerably better than this breakfast, but because of this poor experience, I won't be going back here. I could have gotten a better breakfast at Clarke's or Silver Cloud (and a great Bloody Mary at Silver Cloud that's always nontoxic) for half the price, and it was very irritating to peruse a menu and choose something, only to be told after the fact that it wasn't available.",0.9534,0.794,0.119,0.086,0.5253489068583409

2013-03-20,1.0,"I actually registered on Yelp just to write this review.... Never in my life have I ordered, and then left a restaurant because I felt the food was not fit to eat.  It all started Sunday morning when we went for brunch. After waiting a good 15min without a hostess coming to seat us, we finally took a few seats at the bar. I ordered a Coke and watched the bartender scoop the ice out of a bin that also contained champagne bottles, OJ containers, etc. The very same OJ bottles that I saw the barback take out of a grocery store bag and put straight into the ""clean ice."" Never touched that Coke! In an effort to tidy the bar, the barback wipes the bar down with a small yellow rag. The same rag that he then uses to dry the glasses that were dipped in a series of three sinks to ""clean."" This yellow rag was then used by one of the servers to wipe down a champagne bottle. There was another white rag that was used for all sorts of things - wiping the bartenders hands, wiping off tables after guests left (with windex), drying glasses, etc... I didn't think it could get much worse until a waitress went downstairs to get pitchers to make mimosas... These pitchers looked like they had been in the basement for years collecting mold and dust. She even opened the pitcher, smelled it, made a terrible face and then only rinsed it out in the bar sink! I wish I was kidding... The final straw before we got up and left was the sight of the chef that came out of the kitchen. Clearly his chef shirt and pants had not been washed in... well what looked like weeks. He almost seemed stoned as he stood there drinking water at the bar in front of us, belly hanging out of his clothes... must have been a rough St. Patty's Saturday for him. I never had the opportunity to experience the food because after what I saw at the bar I could only imagine what was going on in the kitchen. No one seemed to be in charge, people were not being seen by the waitresses... I thought it was a hidden camera TV show on The Food Network!

Walked over in about 20-25 minutes and was then told by the bar tender about 5 more minutes, they're just finishing. Okay fine, I was sitting and dreaming of the delightful meaty burger with fried egg I was about to devour, however that moment lead to me sitting for 45 minutes still waiting. WTF? I don't know what happened- dropped on the floor forced to start all over? No burger should take 45 minutes of waiting plus 20 minutes from phone call (65 minutes to create a burger?). The bartender was apologetic and offered my husband a shot of whiskey... are you kidding me? I want this burger to be free not a $2 shot of damn whiskey.  Got home and the burger was so sloppily done, egg was raw and oozing all over the fries and soaked into the bun- instant gag reflex initiated.

Got there a few minutes early... offered our seat right away, but also offered the option of having a cocktail at the bar, which we did.  The bartender, who's name is slipping from memory, was great... Very into his craft, and extremely knowlegeable on both the beer and spirits side.  Had a good discussion on Rittenhouse Rye, and higher proof ryes in general. We were never pressured to take our table, but got seated right away once we did. Our party of 4 basically did everything on the tasting menu.. App round - Korean style pork belly..nice sized portion.. really crispy on the outside, and just melted in the middle.. really well prepared piece of pork... the kimchi was a nice compliment.. maybe a little less funky than one you might find traditionally, but probably more accessable to a wider range of palates.. worked nicely w/ the dish for sure.    Fried calamari.. lots of good tentacle pieces and a nice bright spice to it.    Whipped Goat Cheese w/ toasted pumpkin seeds (just the inside part) and apple.  Served w/ pumpkin bread... this served as a great compliment to the richness and spicines of the other 2 apps... glad w ordered all 3. Mains- Asian short rib - Again well prepared... nice sweet hoisin but served w/ a bitter escarole that balanced things out quite well.  Fried skate wing -  My 1st time trying skate, so not much frame of reference, but I liked it.. .crisp, not greasy, but almost had a buttery, lake-perch quality to it.  Preserved lemon added a nice acidic touch.

The decor and style definitely went up in my book.  DuChamp had these really tiny plastic chairs that my husband was positive he was going to break every time we went in, and the set up was community style tables which we aren't a huge fan of.  So I welcomed the rustic but fancy log cabin look it had going - dimly lit with exposed brick, oversized wooden benches, hightop seating - I dig it.  It looks like something you would see in an episode of How I Met Your Mother if they all took a ski trip to Tahoe. Snacks, Veggies, Small Plates and Bigger Plates are the four menu categories, but the overall style of the menu lacks continuity.  Snacks were things like ""thai egg"" or brussel sprouts.  Since these are listed first, I assumed you would share them?  But can't imagine sharing one egg for $4?  We skipped the snacks. Under ""Veggies"", which I would rename ""sharables"", we ordered the Baked Goat Cheese with Apples, Pumpkin Seeds, and Pumpkin Toast.  Now THIS was yummy!  The toast was a nice twist as it was simliar to a crispy french toast style toast, and the goat cheese with apples, cinnamon and seeds was wonderful.  We loved it and asked for extra bread (comes with 4 pieces originally) to basically lick the bowl clean. For the main, we both got the burger.  I'm almost 7 months pregnant and have been craving burgers (and cottage cheese, so weird), and I honestly was a little hesitant to try some of the other options like Wild Boar Schnitzel Sandwich or Lamb Neck Sloppy Joe.  Pregnant tummies are sensitive.  So we ordered the burger, and I got a side salad as well as the fries.  The burger came served on an oversized very bready bun.  The bacon jam was good, but that was the best part.  The burger was pretty dry, the fries were SUPER greasy and soggy, and the salad was just straight lettuce (no extras for color, texture, etc) and missing any substantial tasting dressing.  I think they said it had dill dressing, but I couldn't find any. The service was really quick and friendly which was a plus.  And I was glad to see people in the restaurant (many times at DuChamp we would be one of two groups eating there which was always a bit awkward).  Our bill with the goat cheese, two burgers, and my friend had two glasses of Pinot Noir was $60.  Not bad.  The menu could use a little direction, the music could be turned down a bit (all wood and brick with no carpeting or tapestries to envelope the sound makes it quite loud), and I would come back again to give the patio a shot this summer.",0.9974,0.797,0.166,0.037,0.5229797979797981

2013-01-07,3.0,"So I have mixed feelings about this place. The 1st time I went it was my boyfriend and I. We sat outside and the atmosphere was great. Our server was awesome and he even recommended a new cocktail that I loved. Our experience was great! A few weeks later we had some friends in from California, so we decided to go there after dinner for a drink on the patio (the patio is a great space with good music and nice, low ighting). When we got there we were told there were no tables available outside and the bar was closed inside. We looked at each other, puzzled because it was still 30 minutes before they closed and there was only 4 of us. We asked again, are you sure we can't just get one cocktail, I thought you were still open for 30 minutes?? The host again declined. Before we left my boyfriend decided to use the washroom and saw that there were, indeed, seats available outside. This is the kind of customer service that ends up closing a place. Why would you turn customers away 30 minutes before you close? I have no idea what the deal was but we haven't gone back since and it's a bummer because we really enjoyed our first experience.",0.9503,0.837,0.121,0.042,0.4500631313131313
2013-01-06,2.0,"I would give this place 2.5 stars. I really wanted to love this place, but it just fell short. I looked at the menu online and had already decided on the scallops or the white fish. When we arrived, we checked in and were seated in the dark corner even though there were several other tables available where you could see your dining partner. We literally had to use the candle to read the menu. We got the menu and I saw that both the scallops and the white fish were not offered. The waiter said that it is an ever-changing menu. That bummed me out. Might want to change the menu online at the same time you change your printed menu.  But dinner must go on. We ordered the pork belly to share. It was really good. Not sure why the Kimchi was paired with it. Seemed out of place on the plate. The pork and sauce was quite delicious. Next, I ordered the simple salad and my man ordered the butternut squash soup with kale. The salad was definitely simple (greens, a few cucumbers, a few radish slices). But strangely enough, it was soooo salty. The soup was good, but really sweet without having a bite with the kale. Luckily, we put the salty greens in the soup to cut the sweetness. Next, I got the gnocci and he got the Wild Boar. First, the Wild Boar is a sandwich. Never expected that. We both thought it would come as a proper schnitzel with sauerkraut on the side. While it was good, there were so many flavors going on. The thick layer of kraut coupled with the strong cheese and rye bread completely took away from any sort of meat flavor. It tasted like a reuben that was heavy on the kraut and light on the meat. My man took it off the bread and ate it plain, but it was a bit dry. He commented on how salty the fries were and the wild boar. The gnocci. Got 10 gnocci for 10 bucks. Yes, I counted. I know it's a small plate, but this was definitely overpriced. And guess what? It was way over salted. The tomato broth/sauce mixed with it was wonderful! Eating that alone was really lovely, but with the gnocci all I tasted was salt.  Both my man and I commented that we wish the chef would let the flavors speak for themselves because there were some great things going on. We also thought that more is less. That wild boar as a schnitzel without the rye bread and the kraut on the side would be better so you can control the amount of kraut and actually taste the meat. All in all though, lay off the salt.  The service was fine aside from being seated in the dark corner. The wine was great.  I may come back to see the patio in the summer, but I really don't think I'll be back for food. I'd choose Fountainhead or Hopleaf over Red Door.",0.9982,0.822,0.164,0.014,0.3991425736961451

However, I'm just not wow'ed with the concept at Red Door. I was a big fan of Duchamp, but I was giving RD a big shot to win me over. Unfortunately the food feels a bit disjointed, bordering on overpriced and at the menu prices...the quality of service just does not compute.  We even considered doing our ""non-rehearsal-rehearsal dinner"" here prior to our wedding, but got a strange vibe when we inquired about their room. With no follow-up from the manager, we just decided to shelve it, opting to work with folks that were excited about our plans and our event.

I've had better burgers, but this was definitely well above average.   To complete our main course, we got the ricotta gnocchi.  Again, this dish was delicious.  The portion sizes were reasonable, which may seem a bit small as compared to ""normal"" restaurant portion sizes.   For dessert, we (strangely) passed on all the sweets and went for the cheese plate.  For a measly $4, we got several pieces of good cheese, some toasted bread, a small cup of really good honey, and some roasted hazelnuts.  Not bad at all!

Enter Red Door.  Yeah.  It's the spot inhabiting the former Duchamp space. Word to the wise: This is a GREAT date spot.  It's really dark.  It's really intimate.  They pour a strong cocktail if that's your jam.  The portions aren't so huge that you'll want to curl up and take a nap when you're done eating.  It's a perfect kind of restaurant to have on your list of locations it's acceptable to bring someone you hope to make out with at the end of the night. The menu at Red Door is small, but mighty.  They cover the bases with seafood, beef, burgers, chicken, etc., but they do it with style and pizazz.  I had a little snafu with my mussels (a bad mussel is NOT a good thing), but I liked where they were going with the dish.  The sauce was excellent and the toast rocked.  I switched to the special of seared scallops and they were a mighty fine replacement.  One thing you should definitely NOT miss is poutine.  I've traditionally been kind of skittish around poutine because I'm not a huge gravy fan (I know), but this gravy is laced with curry, giving it something sweet and spicy.  It was a spectacular appetizer and I'm not even embarrassed to admit my date and I polished off the entire bowl. Service was good, but honestly, a little overbearing at times.  Yes, I dug the fact that once our server discovered we were whiskey hounds, he made suggestions for our next round of cocktails, but we're really not there to be besties.  I'm there to talk to my dining companion, ok?  Cool.  Pricing wasn't totally offensive, either.  4 cocktails, 2 entrees and one appetizer ran us just about $100.   Go.  This is a good date spot.  Trust me.  I wouldn't steer you wrong.",0.9974,0.698,0.256,0.046,0.6468658892128278

2012-09-17,4.0,"I wrote a review a few months back, and I wanted to update. This is my favorite neighborhood bar for a long list of reasons.  1. The food is great. Favorite thing? Probably the spare ribs. Just unbelievable Kimchi, and the Poutine is great. I've tried about everything on the menu and everything ranges from pretty good to awesome. It's also a great place for bringing timid eaters to try bone marrow with out spending an arm. 2. Drinks. I appreciate they do not stock certain beers or types of alcohol to appease the average bro. All of my favorites, an extensive list of rye whiskeys, and Bourbons, a solid wine list, and very decent and long craft beer list. If you're looking for a place to serve you some quality cocktails and alcohol that you can't stock your fridge or home bar with easily, this is a great place to go. It's nothing ground breaking, but it's what I want to spend my money on when I go out for drinks.  3. Other people have commented that they service there is snooty. I've had the opposite of this experience. With in a few visits we've been recognized by the bartenders, and some of the staff. The GM is a great guy, always smiling, always a hardy handshake, and always ALWAYS trying to ensure that we are comfortable, well fed, and well taken care of. They invest in the customers that live in the area.  Though I wouldn't come in nearly as often if I didn't live in the neighborhood, it has been the staff and the general atmosphere that makes us return almost weekly. I really encourage people who have a bad experience to give the place another shot if they live in the neighborhood. I've been watching this restaurant fine tune it's identity, menu and staff all summer, and they are striving to create something of substance. This is a neighborhood bar I'd love to see stay. Map Room can be too crazy on weekends, and Charleston gets so trashy so quickly. Red Door has become a sacred middle ground.  Keep up the good hard work Red Door.

The menu truly is globally inspired as advertised, there's some interesting spins on old favorites, as well as foods that are definitely not typical. I snagged a tasty burger that was larger than expected. Tons of beers, but none on tap. They make up for this by providing a large variety, some of them being quite obscure. This is probably my favorite part of the place, the sheer volume and variety of the beers/liquors. The indoor area is aesthetically pleasing but with somewhat limited space, the huge wooden deck seems to be the place to go if the weather is remotely nice. One thing I certainly appreciated was the music choices, it was like my playlist was uploaded that evening. The volume is thankfully not too loud either.  I'm interested to see how this place will evolve.

2012-09-10,3.0,"I ate here with a group of girlfriends on a Friday night. I've visited the many restaurants that have been in this location (RIP Meritage!), and Red Door unfortunately is the worst of the group. We were seated in the back room, which just has no ambiance. It looks like someone's basement was converted to a restaurant. No windows, weird decor, very empty compared to the energetic front bar room.  It's another one of those small plates places, which I just don't dig. I can appreciate how a restaurant would choose this route: expensive small plates keep people hungry and ordering more food. We weren't that satisfied at the end of our meal, but didn't want to order more since we had 9 things between 5 people.  The food was so-so. We had: poutine (this was actually the best of all the dishes), Kate's greens (barely dressed blah salad), hanger steak (tasty, but so so small for $15!), lemongrass chicken thigh (such a weird dish to share. how can we share 2 chicken thighs??), spare ribs (again, so unsharable. should i take a bite and pass it on or something?), oysters on the half shell (meh). We had two desserts between the 5 of us: the bread pudding (really dry, like an old muffin in a ramekin), and the pistachio creme brulee (a'ight).

2012-09-05,3.0,"I feel so torn about Red Door. This place has some characteristics of a 5-star review and other characteristics of a 1-star review. What a dilemma! I'll start with the positives. I love the location. This stretch of Damen is so cute and makes it super convenient to get to and easy to find since it actually has a RED door. The indoor space is pretty small. I came here earlier this summer in the deadly heat and their A/C was NOT doing it's job. However, I returned this last week and weather permitted outdoor seating on their lovely patio. It is so beautiful out there - cute little lantern lights and lush greenery - perfect for a cool summer evening. Red Door serves small plates, which are great in a bigger group because then you can try more things. In general, their food ranged from good to mind blowingly delicious. In particular, I was impressed with all of their vegetarian dishes (quinoa salad and squash vindaloo were great!) and the spare ribs were yummy too.  Now on to the super disappointing parts. Our waiter sucked. Immediately when we arrived, I just felt like he already didn't like us. Seriously, I have no idea why?! Then, within the first 15 minutes of us sitting down, he returned to the table maybe 4 times to take our drink order. Now you may be thinking, that's nice that he was so attentive, but it was really more like an impatient and annoyed child than a respectful gracious host. We were starving so we ordered an appetizer while we waited for the last two people in our 5-person party. It was strange because that dish came out immediately, which made it even more annoying when we had to wait forever for our real order to come out. They brought our food out in two batches. The first batch didn't take too long (maybe 30 minutes), but then we waited probably 30-40 additional minutes from the time we finished eating the first dishes until they brought the second round of dishes. I wasn't even hungry anymore. And sadly, the first round of food far surpassed the second.   The final straw: I'm sure that it's perfectly common for people to have food allergies or restrictions. My sister cannot eat gluten. While I might expect the average Joe to be ignorant about what foods actually contain gluten, a waiter at a pretty nice restaurant should have a clue. And if they don't, then they should at least have the decency to admit their short comings and ask for help. We asked which dishes could be prepared gluten free. He listed a handful of dishes, one of which was the short ribs. After living with this restriction for years, my sister knows what she can and cannot eat and she knows that soy sauce contains gluten. Since the short ribs seemed to be prepared in an Asian-style, my sister was pleasantly surprised when he told her that the short ribs were fair game. We were all a little skeptical, but ordered them anyway. When they arrived, we asked again, just to be safe. He was annoyed. My sister specifically asked if there was soy sauce in the glaze and he (with a super attitude) responded, yes. Like how stupid could we be if we didn't think there was soy sauce in the Asian spare ribs?! So my sister very politely explained that soy sauce has gluten and so the spare ribs actually were NOT gluten free. He literally couldn't have cared less. No apologies. He acted as if he had forgotten altogether that he even told us she could eat them.  I'm sure I will go back to Red Door. The atmosphere and food is really very nice. That waiter however, is dumb as nails. And had truly terrible customer service skills. Bad hire, Red Door.",0.9965,0.736,0.178,0.086,0.5415760869565213

I just wish there was dessert of some sort. Needless to say I will go back! Now, my only criticism is for the lackluster greeting my friend and I received when we checked in for the event.  It was a BURST day celebration afterall and weexpected there to be great energy. The Yelp staff looked bored and couldn't be bothered to make small talk or even smile.  It was off putting to say the least.  It's no wonder Yelp events are what the are: Clusters of cliques who only mingle among themselves.  When staff themselves don't promote a welcoming air or get to know their know their guests, why would the people attending the event?  Also, there wasn't really a festive air about the social and I questioned if it was indeed a celebration.  After my experience at Prost, I realized that if I wanted to sample the cuisine I'd have to be aggressive (which sucks).  Most of the nibbles didn't even make it past the door thanks to the same tables ambushing the servers.

2012-08-21,4.0,"I'm basing my review of Red Door solely on the Yelp Elite event that was held there last night. I was really excited about Red Door when it first surfaced on Yelp, and I was disappointed to see a lot of 2-3 star reviews lately. That aside, I went to Red Door last night with an open mind. Here's my thoughts on this establishment: The Good 1) BEAUTIFUL outdoor area, perhaps one of the best outdoor patios I've seen at a bar. Very cozy and classy looking, and it sits back far from Damen so you don't hear much of the traffic. Five stars in regards to their outdoor offering. 2) Duck Tacos: Fantastic tacos. I don't think I've ever had shredded duck, but they definitely hit the nail on the head with this one. Unfortunately their menu online doesn't list this item, so I'm fuzzy on what the toppings were, but if you see it, get it! 3) Lamb Neck Sloppy Joe: I was intrigued to try this one after scouring the menu, and the slider version at the Yelp event didn't disappoint. It reminded me of a sweeter pulled pork sandwich, and the little white mushrooms added a unique texture. Very delicious. 4) Spare Ribs: Succulent and fell off the bone, I was a huge fan of these, but they were gone entirely too quickly. 5) Bacon Wrapped Chicken Livers: Bacon wrapped anything is fantastic in my book, and the chicken livers were very sweet and savory. I know a lot of people are scared off by chicken livers, but go ahead and treat yourself to these! The Bad 1) They call themselves a gastro-pub, but I'd just deem it a nice bar with a few unique food offerings. 2) Seafood anything here is a no go in my book. Everything smelled incredibly fishy, like low quality bad fish fishy. This was extremely off-putting and I'd never recommend any of their seafood items. One stomach turner was a round of watermelon topped with avocado cream and a few shreds of crab. The seafood taste permeated the watermelon and it was just a horrible mash up of flavors. My advice to you is to go for a drink or two on the patio while it's still nice out. The food was a-ok, as I think you can find much better offerings in the area for the price point, but the drinks were spot on and it looks like they have quite an impressive beer and whiskey list. I'll definitely stop back by when I'm in the area. I can't comment much on the service aspect since my only experience has been at a Yelp event, but that'll stand the trial the next time around.",0.9882,0.792,0.14,0.068,0.5970754716981131

2012-07-25,4.0,"In my mind, Red Door comes in three parts: Atmosphere/Patio, Food, Drink Atmosphere/Patio: It would be tempting to just call this category Patio, as Red Door has an absolutely killer outdoor setup. Huge patio with some very nice communal tables, as well as some more private hightops and 4-person booths. A great mix between feeling outdoors and having some shade from overhanging trees, the music is pleasant and not intrusive. It's pretty hard not to feel awesome on this patio, as it's really a nice spot. Likewise, the interior atmosphere of Red Door is nice, and with the large windows, you never feel far from the outdoors--especially when seated at the bar Food: Really fun menu. I'm not always a huge fan of small plates, but I think Red Door does a pretty good job of giving options to eat snack-oriented portions, and also combinations that can very easily create a more traditionally portioned meal. Great place to go eat a lot of different types of animals (oysters, marrow, escargot, rabbit, chicken, duck, etc, etc) as well as some fun non-meat items. Food is adventurous, and I found it to generally be good. Not incredible preparations, but very satisfying and never boring Drink: Red Door does a pretty good job here, and one that maybe I would rate more highly if there weren't so many places to get really great drinks in the WP/B area. Their mixed drink menu, although not huge, has a good mix of traditional cocktails as well as some more original creations. They have an interesting beer list, although I might like to see one or two rotating taps in addition to the bottles/cans they have. Overall, the drinks we had were very good, but I also can't rate them at the top of what's available in the area. Competition here is strong. There is also a little bit of an odd emphasis on some pretty aggressive liquors, like malort and some sort of artisan Jagermeister-like concoction that our waiter was pushing.

I have been looking forward to Red Door ever since it opened and I had a failed attempt at dinner previously.  This time, I visited for brunch and I have to say that I was disappointed. The space itself is lovely and the outdoor patio is quite nice - I'm sure it's a great dinner atmosphere.  Our server was very nice as well, so no complaints there. However, the food is missing something.  The drinks...are hit or miss.  I had the classic bloody mary and that was delicious!  Really a great drink, very tasty with a zip of spice and not too strong (I know some of you like a strong vodka taste, I, however, do not).  The shaved ice, however, hard to eat, melty, made a mess and tasted like it was missing the alcohol part (tasty for me because I think that one ordered was supposed to be gin perhaps - which I don't like). Anyway, the food was a disappointment.  I had pork belly - and while the portion on the pork itself was large, the rest of the meal was small.  I also thought that the chorizo should have been drained because the dish was greasy - like in a puddle.  The egg was slightly underdone (though, I like basically raw eggs, so that's ok).  The special was a lobster corn pancake thing.  It sounded wonderful, but the execution was lacking.  The egg here as well was underdone (but more so than mine) and the lobster was a bit fishy.  Portion size was off and the pepper that was supposedly in the dish was not able to be identified.

Finally made it back to their amazing patio and now I know why this is Wicker Park's hidden gem (although not for long once people start finding out about the patio).  ATMOSPHERE The string lights that light atop the patio are a simplistic touch. This is a great date spot. DRINKS Signature cocktails were excellent. We had the High Tea - Chinese Orange Blossom Tea infused Bourbon, Bitters, Flamed cinnamon, and Orange Zest - all came together perfectly. Tasted like you were drinking Big Red gum. Very good. After these, we moved on to beer and the beer selection is, as expected, excellent. FOOD The food this time was on point. I think we just ordered wrong last time cuz I was raving about our dishes long after we left. The Bulgogi Spare Ribs were awesome. I thought I could make this at home, but no... not like these. Big, meaty ribs with a delicious glaze and a side of home made kimchi. I loved this dish.  The Quinoa with the mushroom dish was also surprisingly excellent. We wanted a healthier dish so we opted for a veggie option. As a devout meat eater, I was really impressed with this dish. It had a slight kick to it that had me coming back. I will definitely order this again.  The lobster croquette special was delicately fried to perfection and delicious. Came with a remoulade sauce that was tasty... only 3 pieces was a disappointment because I had to split the 3rd piece with my date.  To top this off, please end with one of their boozy snowcones. We each got the blue mojito flavored one and man, this was a perfect ending. These really bring you back to childhood.

The patio, which is really the main draw for me, is absolutely great (as it was when this place was Duchamp), but the food is hit-or-miss, and the service on my visit was mostly miss. While there were some good points, overall the experience was a bit underwhelming.  Maybe my expectations were too high since any time there is a great patio like this AND you have great food, you can't really get much better. Obviously, then you probably can't get into the place...  Came here for a late dinner one Thursday night, around 10-10:30pm. I can't remember everything we had, but I remember the lamb neck sloppyjoe as being really good. I love lamb prepared in this type of slow-cooked style. Hanger steak had some great flavors also. The mussels were good but not great, and kind of a small. The serious misstep was the octopus--it was inedible. I definitely appreciate a nice char on my octopus, but this  was so burnt that it tasted like eating a rubbery piece of charcoal. It was the first dish that arrived at our table and we were STARVING at that point so we dove right in. I have to admit that we inhaled a good portion of it before we all realized how incredibly burnt it tasted, and then left the rest. When we told our waitress about this when she came to bring another dish. She didn't really acknowledge it. Even though we did eat some of it, I would think that when a table sends a dish away saying it was ""too burnt to finish eating"" and the plate has black pieces of octopus on it, that a restaurant should give some acknowledgment....maybe take it off the bill, or at least a simple apology....something. Service overall was pretty inattentive. While definitely far from a perfect meal, because I like the patio and I appreciate what the chef is trying to do with the menu and its inventive ingredients/preparations, I will probably give it another shot during warm weather.",0.9989,0.721,0.26,0.018,0.5541749723145072

Most of the other parties at that time had little children in tow, and most of the seating outside is at long picnic tables, so if you don't want to share a table with a toddler, come here after they've gone to bed. I ordered the Commodores Buzz cocktail with rum and ginger beer, which was potent and delicious, and my husband had a Canadian IPA that he'd never seen before from Bear Republic.

They kept the exact same ambiance as Duchamp, except that they painted the door red. In other words, the wooden interior, the bar area- all the same. The hostess and the service at the bar was very friendly and our cocktails were delicious but the rest...I don't need to do it again, let's put it that way. We went on Saturday night and were told there might be a 30 minute wait. Fine. We got the aforementioned delicious cocktails (I tried a Red Door, which came with an orchid in it and was mainly comprised of black cherry vodka- yum!) and ordered the mussels as an appetizer. Needless to say, we got our table before the food came out (I bet we only waited 15 minutes). The mussels were superb, served in a very interesting, light, lemony sauce. Unfortunately, the accompanying toast was slathered in a very strong, spicy mustard that did not compliment the dish at all. I scraped it off so that I could sop up more of that sauce. The other weird thing was that we had to ask for more bread and when it came, it was not very good and we only got two more slices. Mussels generally come with a sauce that begs to be sopped up with good bread. I wish they had considered that at Red Door because it's really a waste to give up that sauce. The entire menu is basically tapas-style. We also got ricotta gnocchi (which was pretty good, except for the weird inclusion of raisins. LOVED the accompanying grilled endive!) and grilled octopus. The octopus was apparently chargrilled-- I liked it, my husband didn't dig it so much. The odd thing there was that it came with cauliflower that to me was somewhat burned and dry and tasteless. We left hungry and went to Flash Taco. I would recommend Red Door for cocktails and maybe an app at the bar. The outdoor seating is nice but too big for the staff to handle and I don't really love communal dining.

We went on Saturday for an early bite, and were happy to get there when we did. The bar quickly filled up around us as our already small bar stools became, somehow, more squished. Tables were quickly sat and the space continued to oscillate from crowded to spacious for the rest of the hour.

The light spices included were perfect. Of the other dishes we tried, the ricotta gnocci was my far-and-away favorite. Light and flavorful, but incredibly filling. On the advice of the bartender, we ordered four small plates and a side, but could easily have done without one.  While everything on the menu was exceedingly affordable and the portion sizes were satisfyingly large, there was a minor downside in the cocktail offerings.

Red Door has taken over the site that was formerly Duchamp, and Meritage before that.  Interesting fact: Chef Graves used to work at Meritage.   The inside of his new restaurant has a pub-like feel to it.  The front room offers a long bar, bench seating against the walls, and high top chairs.  The spectacular outdoor patio is very spacious and is lent additional character by a large, vine-covered, old tree. Not a single item on the menu is priced above $16. Most are small plates meant to be shared.  During the course of the evening I tried eight dishes.  There was not one I didn't like, but the standouts were:   - the delicately prepared Ramp Tempura with Togarashi and Yuzu Aioli - the table favorite Poutine with Chicken Confit, Brunkow Curds, and Curry Gravy - and the Buchot Mussels (9 large ones) served in a Green Garlic Broth with Mustard Toast.   In a heartbeat I would also reorder the Ricotta Gnocchi with Grilled Escarole, the Soy Cured Salmon, the Fava Bean Pesto Toast with Burrata and Strawberries, and the Grilled Baby Octopus. The Bacon Wrapped Artichoke with Chicken Liver and Romesco sauce was good but the bacon completely overpowered the chicken liver. I can't speak for the Daily Oysters, since I am allergic to those little monsters, but my table mates did happily slurp down a whole lot of them. All the staff at the restaurant was very friendly and helpful, quick to serve our needs and answer our questions. Before I left Red Door, I had made a reservation for a return visit.  Who wants to come with me?",0.981,0.863,0.118,0.02,0.4397212728791677
2012-04-29,4.0,"This is only a review of the cocktails and beer list. Our experience on Red Door's opening night was great - my companion and I went late, so we got to meet and greet with the staff. The beer list was expansive and the host was clearly a total beer guy, in the best way. The bartender had an effortless vibe about him, saying he'd made up the cocktails in a burst of creativity the day before the soft-launch. Everyone at the bar mentioned how they liked the cocktails, but I tried a delicious beer instead (the name of which escapes me). The list was not too big and was biased toward more expensive, but insanely good beers (think $20-25 for a bomber and $10-12 for a 12oz bottle). The hospitality was excellent, and if the place can walk that line of being near Wicker Park/Bucktown, being more casual than Violet Hour, and offering a more awesome outdoor space than Longman & Eagle, they're gonna kill it.",0.9766,0.755,0.196,0.049,0.6314814814814815
2012-04-27,4.0,"I got the pleasure to be invited to the friends and family soft opening of this new establishment last night and was thoroughly impressed with what they were doing. Trying almost everything the menu had to offer aside from a few I just couldn't eat everything I did try from the bone marrow topped with escargot to the the duck confit atop french toast w/ shaved foie gras and cherry compote to the bulgogi spare ribs with kimchi or hanger steak with charred ramp butter everything was executed very well, their cocktails are pretty spot on and the poutine was a big hit in my book. Anxious to see what they do with that awesome outdoor patio with warmer weather right around the corner.  Thumbs up guys. PS. Get some desserts.",0.9642,0.83,0.155,0.014,0.4922438672438672
