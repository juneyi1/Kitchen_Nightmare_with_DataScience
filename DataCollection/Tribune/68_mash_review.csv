2016-12-07,3.0,"Mash appears to have closed down, or they are doing some sort of secret remodel. The place has been closed with brown paper covering the windows for about a week now. As for the restaurant itself, the current 3.5 star average seems to be pretty accurate - mediocre food and inconsistent service are the negatives, but the good TV situation (for sports), excellent beer list, and huge outdoor patio make up for some of those negatives. Hopefully they are either going through a re-branding (again, RIP Bad Dog) or renovation. I'd hate to see this patio sit empty when we get back to the summer months.",0.6705,0.763,0.141,0.096,0.5743055555555555
2016-10-09,1.0,"This place is really unfortunate because it has the potential to be awesome. Giant parking lot right next door so parking is never a problem. Right by Welles Park. Great patio. Decent menu options. Lots of TVs to watch the games.  I came to this place twice when it was Bad Dog and had a horrible experience both times. Service was awful hence why it shut down. Went to Mash today hoping it was much different from Bad Dog, however I was very wrong.  First, we decided to try Mash for the patio, on a beautiful, sunny October day. When we asked to sit in the sun, not in the shade, the hostess told us that area of the patio was closed. However, there were already people sitting in it and as we left there were new parties at tables in the ""closed"" section. Instead we sat inside by the window, which was extremely dirty. Leaves and dead bugs just chilling on the ledge next to the table.  The service was slow. The food came quick, but it was probably because it wasn't fresh. Waitress came back only once after we got our food to grab our empty plates and give us the bill. Our water glasses were empty for the majority of the meal until we flagged someone down for water. When they brought the water it was clearly straight out of the tap. No ice. Room temperature. Also, the restaurant wasn't busy at all so that couldn't be a factor.  The food: nothing special. It could be good, but to make good food there needs to be effort involved. My daughter's burger was weird. We couldn't even lift the bun off to put ketchup on. Half the bun stuck to the cheese when we finally got it off. My husband's lamb burger was paper thin and didn't even come with normal burger fixings like lettuce and tomato. Just the bun and meat. Brussel sprouts were cold. Clearly just thrown in the microwave. My smoked sandwich wasn't anything I would try again. Meat was warm at best and honestly not a lot of flavor.  Come for drinks during a game if you want a nice patio and slow service but there are much better places in the area for food.",0.9739,0.79,0.128,0.082,0.5869530888398814

The gravy in the poutine was a little smokier than I was expecting, but good none the less. His pulled pork was flavorful and juicy but not sloppy. We came right at the end of brunch, about 1:30pm and the waiter was very up front with us about the ticking clock on the brunch menu which I appreciated since I can lean toward being very indecisive, this gave me the push I needed to choose quickly and I wasn't disappointed.  I also ordered a drink Bc what's the point of brunch if you aren't drinking? Anyway I got the Kelly Kapowski (you're not just gonna not drink that) and it came with a fresh slice of peach (white wine, peach schnapps and some other things that I wish I paid attention) in a mason jar which is kind of too trendy but also just trendy enough.  My only qualms were the food runner and busser were so awkward and visibly uncomfortable. The waiter and hostess were great but the guy who brought our food (as well as the food to the surrounding tables) felt like he got double dared to step into the dining room.

Both were very good. Had a lot of flavor and the portions were big enough that four of us got to enjoy a taste.  I had the Reuben.  It was very good.  Typical Reuben, nothing out of the ordinary. It's a hard sandwich to mess up.   I had the regular fries and enjoyed them.   One of my friend's had the lobster roll  and another tried the mac and cheese.  Both liked their dishes.     We closed out with our server when the patio closed and moved inside to have another drink.  The place was dead inside.  We sat down at a table and no one came to get an order or check in with us.  I finally went up to the bar and stood there watching some staff walking around, ignoring me.  No one said anything.

Side of coleslaw which was delicious and great option for $3. My guest had a market burger. Grass fed beef, smoked gouda, frisee, pappadew aoili on a brioche bun. For $13 grass fed, you can't beat it! House fries with parm and parsley, great stuff. Suggestions? Serve bread with the roasted cauliflower and chickpea appetizer. We loved the garlic oil so much that it was served with that the our server brought us some French bread to soak it up with!  Offer the smoked nuts as an appetizer, they're amazing!  A small observation from someone who used to be in the restaurant and bar industry: be sure that the food runner isn't the busser. And also, please ensure that the bussers carry different towels for cleaning the tabletops and chairs. It was a little gross to see the same one used but I appreciate that the chairs were cleaned!

Mash, though, lets me have my simple pleasures -- big TVs and a casual atmosphere -- while still be able to enjoy really good food, an thoughtful beer and cocktail list, and great, neighborly service.

Seeing as this is the same ownership as Bas Dog that took a big turn downward over the past few years I was not surprised the food was bland, uninspiring, and overall bleh. Places like this (and Fork) frustrate me because they take advantage of the neighborhood and the families that have money to spend. They don't go all in and give half efforts on the food because there's not the best variety save for a few great spots (Gather, Bistro Campagne and Due Lire). Families are looking for affordable and good qualify food but are fooled by fancy sounding cooking and dishes that are not executed well and take for granted the clientele. Put ""craft"" on the menu or in the title of the restaurant and everyone thinks the place is unique, creative with high-quality food. I don't know how we spent $100 on a bill for what we got. Only redeemable food was burnt ends and those were not that great...I've had burnt ends before and these seems like they were purposefully made to be like burnt ends but really weren't naturally burnt ends. My daughter had the chicken tenders (actually it was one large tender) and I've rarely seen something so tasteless and limp and dry for $8.

They smoke their wings in house, but wasn't really a fan. I'm not sure if it was because of the smokey flavor or if there was too much breading. The side of mac and cheese was yummy, super cheesy with cavatoppi noodles. The jalepeno cheddar cornbread was alright. Nothing compared to Bandera's, but for $1 for a side of it, it's worth trying. Lastly, their market flat bread had arugula, cheddar and caramel apples. It was an interesting combo, wouldn't order it again.

2015-07-05,4.0,"I started dating a new girl recently that lives right down the block and she decided upon this place to post up on the evening of the 4th of July. We opted for one of the tables outside since it was a was a pleasant enough evening. This turned out to be a lucky break actually as we had a fantastic view of fireworks all around us. There were fireworks going off on the date too, but that is a tale I will save for my blog.  We were honestly not even planning on having any food when we first stopped in, just a couple of drinks, but we ended up being there for so long that hunger caught up with us. I started off with a dirty martini (pictured) to take some of the edge off of the nervousness of the date. It was extremely well made. You know you are dealing with a bartender that knows what they are doing when you have nice little slivers off ice floating on the top. For my second round, I would not be a proper Wisconsin transplant if I did not opt for the Old Fashioned. This is a massively popular cocktail is Wisco, and the high end bars in Milwaukee pull out all the stops to make the very best. The Old Fashioned I had at Mash could easily go toe to toe with the heavy hitters in downtown Milwaukee. Mash does theirs with top shelf Bourbon (which I prefer), while most of the Wisconsin bars stick with Brandy. It was muddled and blended very well and served with the signature single large cube with a delicious Luxardo cherry garish. I was going to switch things up for my third round, but I liked it so much I opted to stick with the Old Fashioned. If you stop in here for a cocktail, you should really give it a try.  As the evening progressed and I started to get really into my increasingly gorgeous Bulgarian date, I decided that an appetizer was probably a good idea to slow my roll a tad. The menu at this place is fairly short (only a single page) and falls into the New American or Gastropub category. We went with a nuts, veg, and olive tray. Both the olives and house roasted nuts were great, but the vegetables were too sour for my taste.  Fast forward a couple of hours and a few long PDA sessions later and I knew that I was going to have to get an entree down me if there was going to be any hope of me being able to drive home that night. I opted for a smokehouse brisket sandwich with sweet potato fries. This place smokes all their own meats in house, which you can smell almost immediately when you walk in the front door, and it was pretty damn good. It's really easy when making brisket to have it come out too dry or cut it too fatty, but that was not the case here. They also have a couple of different house made BBQ sauces which were great as well. One was more vinegar based, the other more of a tomato mustard hybrid. Both were very unique. The fries would of been fantastic if they were just a little crispier, but the flavor contrast when dipping them in the BBQ sauce was lovely.  Lastly, the service I received here is what really catapulted this place into 4 star territory. This guy knew the menu, he knew the drinks, and he knew how to be attentive without being a nuisance. As the night progressed and my chair slowly moved closer and closer towards my date, he knew how to handle it perfectly. It's always nice when a server steps in and plays freelance wingman. I left him 40%.  If things continue to work out with little miss wonderful, I am sure I will end up back in this place at some point.

2015-06-29,1.0,"I went to Mash with my husband and three kids last Saturday. I loved the Bad Dog Tavern and thought this might be another good spot (I especially like the patio in summer and fireplace in winter). Lincoln Square was full of people so I figured we'd have a long wait. We walked in and were seated right away. I should have guessed why.  While the look of the place isn't that different from Bad Dog, nothing else is the same.  The service was slow and uneven. Our kids got kids' menus and when I asked if they had crayons to write on the menu (which had the word search and other games) the girl at the front told me ""sorry, we don't have anything to write with"". That seems like a fairly simple and important thing to include with kids' menus that are meant to be written on. Service was slow. We ordered buffalo wings as an appetizer and after waiting 15 minutes I asked the waiter if they would come out before our food. He went and checked and said the order had somehow ""gotten lost"". To his credit, he did offer to bring them with our meal and comp them, which we did. They turned out to be almost the only thing that had any flavor. They weren't really buffalo wings though, more like spicy BBQ sauce.  Right away our server told us they ran out of baby backs (and it was only 8:30). That seemed odd as this is a BBQ joint with only about 15 items on the entree/sandwich menu. To run out of ribs is just poor management. Probably for the best though because they were expensive and the food we did get was some of the worst BBQ I have eaten in a long time. My pulled pork sandwich was so dry I couldn't eat it. I asked for extra barbecue sauce (which tasted like KC Masterpiece) and our waiter said ""it's so good, isn't it?""  I wanted to tell him not really, it was just that I was trying to drown the pork to make it more edible. My son got an order of chicken strips and one piece of chicken arrived. It literally tasted like rubber. The Mac and cheese side had almost no flavor. The sweet potato fries (one of my favorite Bad Dog Tavern items) tasted like plain fries. My husband had the burnt ends and he barely ate any of it because it was so bad.

The appetizer was hands down the best part of the meal. The roasted garlic was really tempered by the goat cheese and it was delicious. The mac was creamy, but in a very ""velveeta"" way. And we both decided it was made worse by the dry, flavorless pork on top and ate around that. The wings were rubbery, but the sauce was very good and the rub was ok, not great (we got half rub, half Mash bbq). The fries weren't my favorite fries, but I liked them better than my husband did.

Before our drinks, in fact, which had been ordered about 10 minutes prior to the oysters. We then got to wait AN HOUR - FOR REAL - for a bowl of mac and cheese and a veggie burger to make it to our table. When it did arrive, it was cold and disgusting. The burger had been sitting under warmers for at least 10 minutes. The mac tasted like garbage. We paid for the meal trying to hustle things along before any of our food arrived. Signed receipts and everything and we were still waiting. We were supposed to see a show and actually MISSED it because we had to wait so long. I want to be clear - not just a movie, we were scheduled to see a play and didn't get to go.  The server offered us a 2nd round of drinks on the house after, but it seemed like such an after thought. I would have preferred for the server to take the opportunity we handed him to take a percent off of our bill after having to wait so long. Because again - we literally paid and waited another 15 minutes until our food came out.  MANAGEMENT: Get your head out of your ass. Learn to expo a line.

2015-06-08,2.0,"I frequented this place a lot when it was Bad Dog and always had a great time with wonderful food and good service, so I was very excited to try out the ""new and improved"" MASH version of this restaurant- with less sports bar/ more upscale feel. Oh man, was I disappointed. We sat outside on the patio and ordered the stuffed jalapenos to share. They arrived but we didn't have any plates/utensils/napkins and the kitchen person who dropped them off left so quick we didn't get a chance to ask. But no big deal. We finally were able to flag down our waiter and he brought us some. My two friends tried the app and said it was pretty bad and not worth the money. We were also bummed because there were only three tiny halved jalapenos that came with the order, so there wasn't even enough for us each to try one.  And it honestly seemed silly to try to cut one in half because they were so small. (Plus with not having utensils for awhile...) We also all agreed that the menu was super wonky compared to what Bad Dog's had been. It just seemed like there was 1. A lot less to choose from. 2. Everything cost  more and 3. Now they feature BBQ, (yet weren't a BBQ place really, since that was only a portion of the menu.) It was all a bit weird. Bad Dog honestly had some of my favorite dishes: the awesome salads  and the elotes dip were my go to every time. I was sad to see these and so many other faves gone, but wanted to give the new menu a chance.  Two of us ordered the burnt ends which our server said were amazing and insisted on ordering. They came served on BBQ chips, which...was a little weird. And they came with no side at all. Also weird. The ends were $10 and sides were $4. We both got a side of mac-n-cheese. The ends were SO DISAPPOINTING. Now, I am someone who gets that there are folks who like the fatty part of the ends- even though I don't. So I expected that there would be some fatty parts and that was okay. But I'd say (and I'm not exaggerating) that 70% of the ends were solid pieces of fat. No meat. Just fat. Then maybe 10 % were a combo and only 20% were meat. Not cool. And the mac-n-cheese was really good, but for $4 I expected more than four bites.  My third friend got the turkey pastrami Ruben which I tried and was good but...it tasted just like regular deli turkey meat and not much like a rueben at all. So that was a wash as well. My fourth friend got the main salad which, okay, it comes with salmon, but you can't switch out protein. If you do they charge you. Which just seems crazy because there was no other just regular salad to add meat to. I'm allergic to salmon so, it was just dumb all around. Our server (the apple watch guy as he likes to be called) was super awesome and tried to get the chef to not up-charge, but was having problems doing so. The vibe is still exactly the same to me, save for some new paint and fancy wood put up in places, so it didn't really feel new and it really made me miss the original Bad Dog. I've been a fan of that TN bar for so long, and I'm sad that it's now a place I know we all won't returning to any time soon.",0.9904,0.724,0.164,0.112,0.5438864607614609

The service has been bad both times we have eaten here, forgotten drinks, not bringing BBQ sauce with a sandwich, sever taking 15 takes greet us and take drink orders, etc... The food has been hit or miss.

2015-05-22,3.0,"A solid rebranding effort that hasn't established its identity just yet.  When Bad Dog was going to rebrand rumor was that a seafood place was coming in. This is not that place. Mash is very much a rib joint with brisket, pulled pork, beans, and slaw.  We dined here on a Friday evening so the short wait time of 20 minutes was understandable. We grabbed a drink at the bar and I noticed most of the drinks mirror what Bad Dog offered. We were seated by the fireplace (which I believe is new) and I ordered the Carolina (pork shoulder sandwich with onion rings on it--vaguely reminiscent of Bad Dog's Steakhouse Burger). My husband ordered the pulled pork smoked sandwich.  For me the hallmarks of a great BBQ restaurant are great sauces and cuts of meat that are not full of fat.  I have to say I was really impressed with my sandwich. It arrived with their delicious ""belly beans"" which was  baked beans with bits of pulled pork. The meat had just a bit of fat and the Carolina sauce was tangy in a good way. My husband's sandwich had a lot of fat though. Too much. He also kept stealing bites of my beans because he wasn't wild about their fries (which are also just like Bad Dog).  Overall I had a great meal and my husband had an average one. This would be a 3.5 star review which I would round up to four except for one detail that really bothers me. You are a BBQ joint. Why in God's name are you giving me fortune cookies with my check? Even the waiter acknowledged it was just some weird thing they do. If you are going to recraft your image then commit to that idea  Here's a hint on me...moist towelettes. This is what I wanted with my check; something to clean up my sticky hands and fingers. The food definitely met my expectations and the price was reasonable so I will be back.

No problem, we grabbed a beer at the bar (which took 15 minutes to get because the many bartenders behind the bar didn't even look at us). So we wait about fifty minutes until we hear a lady say, ""Can we get some menus outside, we just sat ourselves."" Turns out people were just sitting down outside and the servers were letting it happen, thus jacking up the wait time and upsetting everyone that legitimately put their name on the list and waited. So I ask the manager how much longer and he tells me he's really sorry but its about a 45 minute wait now.....on top of the 50 minutes we already waited. Suddenly, the manager tells a young couple at the bar by us they're ready to be seated. That was the last straw for me. Why? Because this couple put their name in a solid 20 minutes after us.

Our lovely server, who I think was named Kelly, quickly came over to check on our food and we let her know something was amiss with the burger. She went to the kitchen to see what happened. Basically, they had made the lamb burger, but with the toppings that come on a different burger. Me and the bf are fairly easygoing, so this really wasn't a big deal. But nonetheless, a manager came over to check in, and our server let us know that they were firing a new burger for him.

I haven't tried the burgers or mac and cheese here (mentioned in a negative review) but that's because there's so much more interesting stuff worth trying. What I've ordered has been nothing short of excellent Highlights so far:  the brisket sandwich I got was big, juicy, tender, flavorful, and served hot.  And with two varieties of BBQ sauce, both wonderful.  Their take on poutine was even better: I ordered mine with shredded oxtail: what came out was not poutine like -- no gravy!  But a big mound of the crispiest french fries I've every had; they had been fried twice and then charred, The oxtail was SO tasty: it'll be difficult to choose anything else.  And the cheese is provided in little chunks, around the side.  Confession: I'm a great fan of gravy.  But you'll hear no complaint from me about this weird variation.  It's a sure re-order.  Finally -- and amazing -- is the roasted garlic. Any garlic lover is likely to be hooked.  Just be sure to ask for more of the toast to smear it on.   I also liked their take on my favorite drink, Long Island Ice Tea.  It's served in a mason jar and with more of a lemon accent than usual.  The waitress said they make their own lemon mix that's used in it.",0.9871,0.737,0.181,0.082,0.5882716049382716

Our oysters came out, and when we went to grab the plates that were already on our table, we discovered that the bottom plate HAD FOOD ON IT. We also weren't given two forks for our oysters, so we flagged our waitress down. She basically went, ""OMG EW"" at our plates, but took a good 5 minutes to get new ones. Now, if I were running, waiting tables, or otherwise working for a new restaurant, a faux pas like that merits a free drink, or two. I was literally so disgusted with the dirty plate that I couldn't eat my oysters until they cleared it away. It was so gross, and I honestly cannot believe that they didn't comp us something, or even have the manager come over and apologize.  No sooner had we eaten our first oyster, but our main courses came out. Hot. Not hot when we were done with the oysters. There is obviously a timing problem in the kitchen. By the time we finished, our fries were cold. Additionally, no one cleared away the gigantic oyster platter, so we were basically eating out of our laps. Our waitress kept coming by, would look at it, and walk away. I'm sorry, but if your bussers aren't doing it, THEN YOU DO IT. My tacos were great, if a little bit cold.

That said we had a horrible experience at Mash and would never go back.  We only live a few blocks from Mash and walked over to watch the Bulls game and have dinner. Our party consisted of three adults and after a 20 minute wait we were seated at a two top (literally a table for two with a chair pulled up to the side). Obviously way too small for three adults (we were surprised they even tried). Anyway no harm no foul we passed on getting crammed and that didn't sit well with the hostess.  We were told that we would have to go to the back of the waiting list if we didnt take the table for two.  I was shocked, and asked for the Manager.  She told us to stand at the door and proceeded to sit multiple parties of four at four tops. When we asked why we were being passed over we were told those tables were for parties of four, not three (I am still trying to figure out what a table for three looks like).  Ny the way still no manager came over, After being passed up twice we insisted we speak to the manager. The hostess refused to bring the manager over (they were apparently too busy to deal with a customer) and by this point we were pretty frustrated.  I scoped out who looked like the Manager, confirmed he was, and conveyed our disappointment on the service.  His first reply was I ""I have only been at this for two weeks"".  We decided to leave and spend our money at Fork.  Lincoln Square has so many good options, people don't need to deal with horrible customer service.  Choose Big Apple, Fork or Rocks. We sure won't be back.",-0.8662,0.82,0.075,0.105,0.498962962962963

My veggie gf got the house made veggie burger and practically foamed at the mouth with the nectar of deliciousness. Can't wait to come back!

2015-04-13,4.0,"We went to Mash on a Saturday in mid-April, late afternoon, maybe only a week or so after its (re)opening. There was unfortunately a 45-minute wait for outside seating, so we took a booth in the back and settled in for a nice, long, 3-hour birthday dinner.  It's clear they're still working out a few kinks, as paper menus were running short and our group of 6 had initially been seated at an odd-shaped booth made for 5 or less people, before being moved to a much more comfortable table. Also, some parts of our meal took a bit longer to arrive.  But once the beer and food began to arrive, it was absolutely delicious! We enjoyed brisket, a porkbelly melt, buffalo wings, and beer from across the country. Might be the best brisket I've ever had, though I'll admit it's a small sample size, as it can be very hit or miss when dining out. Well, this brisket is a HIT! We liked the previous incarnation of this spot, but the new one is even better, and the patio still beckons to us whenever we walk or jog by. Mash is off to a great start, and we'll definitely be back for more!",0.9799,0.833,0.152,0.015,0.4642773892773893
2015-04-12,5.0,"Earlier today my wife and I got groceries at the new Whole Foods in the West Loop. It took the place of a newer Dominicks -- but you'd never know it. As we were eating lunch in the cafe, I commented to her that it's amazing how different a space can feel based on relatively minor changes. It went from a grocery store to a grocery store, after all. But it feels so much more alive and inviting, with wood and plants everywhere. It doesn't feel like a hospital anymore. Mash took the place of Bad Dog and I seem to recall reading that it's even the same owners. While it's obviously the same place, it's very different. It, too, has introduced a good amount of wood. The staff is knowledgeable and they have an awesome beer list, with a number of brews from smaller local breweries. My first beer was from a local nanobrewery I'd never heard of, and the second was a 3 Floyds I'd never had. What more could a guy want? The food was great too. I had the chicken chorizo burger, which has bleu cheese and an apple/onion jam on top. It didn't taste like chicken or chorizo, and that is awesome. The flavors combine to make it taste like something all its own. Trust me, I'm not a poultry burger guy, and this thing was amazing. Incredibly moist and full of flavor. My wife had a relatively plain burger (meat-and-potatoes kinda lady) and she liked it as well. My expectations were pretty low, as the Bad Dog wasn't bad per se, but it was a pretty damn average sports bar. Mash definitely delivered and is a top contender to take over Bad Apple as the place on Lincoln that I annoy my wife to go to more than she would prefer. Unlike Bad Apple, Mash has a really diverse menu. Is everything else as good? We've only been once. We'll see!",0.9925,0.702,0.203,0.095,0.5740946734424996

Beer list is awesome (love that they support new, local breweries!) and all the food that I have tried has been really tasty. I like that the menu does not completely focus on seafood or bbq - but they seem to do both really well. I am REALLY looking forward to enjoying the patio as soon as it gets nicer outside.",0.9527,0.761,0.221,0.018,0.45034965034965035
2015-04-08,4.0,"The remodel looks great and the beer list is astounding. So many local options, many you've never heard of. The food is good--some of it needs some work, like the cole slaw that could use more vinegar, but the brisket and chicken are great. It's dark and rustic and really nice inside now. I'm looking forward to trying more items. And best of all? No kids menu!",0.971,0.683,0.284,0.032,0.5958333333333333
2015-04-07,5.0,"We stopped in for a late lunch 3 days after they opened.  We were never big fans of Bad Dog and were really curious to see what the revamp would be like.  Wow, were we pleasantly surprised! The updated menu, decor and cocktails are all excellent - and let's not forget the friendly and capable staff. We started with the pork wings and stuffed jalapenos.  If you like spicy (we do)...the jalapenos are delicious!  The pork wings were spiced well and tender, another win.  My wife had the Chicken Chorizo, chicken mixed with chorizo, what????  Fantastic, that's what. I had the Belly Melt: pork belly, swiss, cheddar, apple and slaw.  Full disclosure, I held back the slaw because I wanted nothing to come between me and the cheesy melted goodness and this sandwich delivered.  So many other things on the menu to try, we can't wait to go back....We think Mash is exactly what the neighborhood needed....",0.9901,0.701,0.256,0.043,0.632936507936508
2015-04-07,5.0,"My mom was visiting this past and we decided to try Mash when she arrived since it is down the street from my work. What a pleasant surprise! For having only been open two days I was really impressed. We both decided on the sandwich where you can add or your own meat for $10. I went with pulled pork and she had the brisket. Both portions were very generous and tasted great! The sweet potato fries were seasoned and cooked perfectly and my mom enjoyed her housemade cole slaw. The beer selection was also good sized and featured many craft beers. I can't remember her name unfortunatley but the waitress was very attentive and friendly, taking time to explain the menu. I'm definitely looking forward to the patio opening this summer, will be a great place to go.  As a comparison a few days later we had dinner at Chicago Q at Dearborn and Division. We happened to order the same items we did at Mash and honestly we didn't think it was as good as Mash, and the price doubled.",0.9911,0.784,0.216,0.0,0.5929398148148147
2015-04-04,2.0,"My friends and I used to love Bad Dog Tavern, the previous version of Mash. While I usually consider myself a bit of a foodie (honestly, who in Chicago isn't?), the charm of Bad Dog was that it wasn't an event to go there. It was easy and comfortable and that's why we loved it. It really seemed to echo the tone of the neighborhood and it was always full of families, dog lovers, and generally casual and lovely people. Cut to yesterday when my boyfriend and I, having the afternoon off, took the opportunity to try out the new menu at Mash. $12 cocktails and octopus tacos? I'm all for elevated food. I love elevated food! But River North prices in Lincoln Square just seems wrong. That being said, I can forgive the prices if the food is actually done well. It's like they just spun a wheel of gastropub trends and slapped them on the menu. I ordered the chicken and black bean soup. They served the smallest portion in the most comically large bowl. It was also served barely warm and it was filled with chicken skin and gristle. I felt sick for hours after eating it. My boyfriend got the pulled chicken sandwich. They brought him the pulled pork and he decided to just roll with it. For smoked meat it was extremely dry and the sauce had no flavor beyond vinegar and tomato. They asked us if we wanted any creme brulee for dessert and when we declined they gave us fortune cookies with our check. WHY! What is going on with this place! So disappointing. Simplify the menu, stop with the market boards and trendy bull and just stick to what made Bad Dog so special. And I fully realize that this review makes me sound quite crotchety. I just think they could do so much better.",0.9636,0.779,0.139,0.082,0.6367178276269185
