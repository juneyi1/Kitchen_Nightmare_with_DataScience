2017-08-24,1.0,"Unfortunately one of my favorite places is now not even in the mix of options on a night out. Please Blue Frog recognize what you have going on- the new karaoke guy is immature and only concerned about himself. He is never at the booth and when he is he is unnecessarily smarmy and douchey. A place where I'd usually bring my friends i will never again. I'm not subjecting themselves to the rude behavior of this guy. I wish I could wipe the smug grin from his face. Bring back the former keeper of the karaoke. He was friendly and professional. If he's no longer available, then find ANYBODY else. They would be better than the current guy. Also referring to the other karaoke DJ as ""A-a-Ron"" - is racist, offensive and unprofessional.",0.4939,0.74,0.144,0.116,0.47372159090909094
2017-08-07,3.0,"Our group came in on a Friday night, around 7 or 8 at night. I was surprised that they weren't super busy like many establishments on Hubbard Street, but I was fine with it because I'm not a crowded bar person.  We came here for a few drinks, no food. So this review will be simply the drinking experience along with any other general comments on the establishment.  They have a wide variety of beers on tap, which most are supposed to be from the area. Neat concept. I ordered Zombie Dust, which was listed as a beer on draft. Instead of a beer on draft, I get handed the bottle of it and a bar glass.  Here's the thing: I go to bars for draft beer. I can buy bottles and have them at home. I would have appreciated being told that the draft beer for Zombie Dust wasn't available so that I could make a different selection. However, the beer was still good. I just think I could have experienced better if it were on draft.  The menu was hard to read due to the spacing of text, font choice, and color of text. It also didn't help that it seemed very dim in the bar, so it made the process of reviewing beer choices very difficult.  My husband noted that the men's bathroom was extremely filthy. The floor was wet, and there was a circular desk fan sitting on the sink to circulate air in the already nasty bathroom. Nasty! I like the concept, but there are some things that need to be fine tuned here.",-0.3424,0.815,0.088,0.097,0.5640567765567766

First, we visited for lunch with our two very small children upon recommendation of the owner of a restaurant we went to first that was closed for the holiday.  It was totally empty when we went in which thrilled us (because, kids).  The food came out super quickly and they were ultra-accommodating of our kids.  They brought sliced avocado for our infant and a really great PBJ sandwich for the toddler (on nice sourdough bread).  I had an Italian sub that was phenomenal and my husband had some great wings (meaty, saucy, unique flavors).  It was easy, the food was great for what it was (bar food) and the service was wonderful. Later, I visited during nap time by myself for a drink at the bar.  The owners were there and were so friendly and engaging.  We discussed wine and beer and they were so knowledgeable, giving me tastes of different things.  They had a really unique and delicious selection.

2017-06-25,3.0,"Overall, we had fun! The food wasn't bad either.  A group of friends had gathered from all over so we were exploring Chicago, looking for some karaoke. We called the bar ahead of time to ask about it and they said it started at 9pm. We somewhat planned our night around it. But when we got there, they said it didn't start until 10, but then ended up started at 8:45. Oh well! It worked out I guess! The karaoke host was really great, funny and energetic. He really made the night fun.  The reason for the star deduction is just that our server was pretty confused. He was friendly though! I asked if they had ginger beer (weird request, I know). He said that they did and carded me but came back with non-alcoholic ginger soda. I was fine but my friends were pretty adamant about me drinking so they asked if we could add something to the soda. The server was just so confused. He said a few times that they had ginger ale on tap. Then later the best he could do would be well whiskey, which was Jameson for $8. I declined the whiskey but he came back with it anyway. I tried it but it sat on the table because I didn't like it. He didn't end up charging us for the whiskey though! That was nice! I mean I didn't ask for it and I didn't really drink it, but still - we probably would have paid for it to avoid more confusion.  There were another few examples of the server just being confused like one person asked about the fries and he started talking about their chips. She also asked about the portion of the fries and he started talking about how they're made from scratch and hand cut. He was smiling and friendly though despite the multiple misunderstandings.  It wasn't exactly a seemly experience but it was just fine. Especially with the karaoke host.

Yesterday December 27 around 9pm after having a couple of beers I decided to go up for karaoke I sang Rihanna's take a bow and got a standing ovation so I am high-fiving everyone in the bar just having fun and there's this Caucasian man at the bar he looked like he was in his late 30s he was speaking to my waiter (the person serving me drinks at the time) and he was one of the ones I high-fived as well and the waiter told me he's not supposed to be in here I'm unaware that this man is causing a problem, I'm just having a good time. There was a black guy with an Afro and a gap I believe but he was at the door and was checking I.d's and there was a black guy hosting the karaoke drinking a tall glass of straight vodka and then there was the white man who was my waiter and they all came to me simultaneously telling me to calm down as if I was disruptive and I couldn't understand how they expected me to behave. I was so confused they were treating me like I was drunk and telling me to sit down repeatedly I said ""I'm not sitting down I'm having a good time what are you saying?"" and the guy at the door grab me by both my forearms which to me was a physical attack and 100% uncalled for.

2016-11-16,4.0,"This was my second time here. The first time was a couple of years ago. A Friend of mine were having a beer down the street and I remembered that there was a Bar Rescue bar on Hubbard St and went to Google and this bar showed up. Had great doors, great service and great beer the first time. This visit on 11/9/16, was no different.  I have watched the Bar Rescue episode that aired in 2011 so I have a good frame of reference of Before and After.  We walked in around 3pm and the owner, who I recognized from TV, hopped right up from a meeting with some staff members in the back, and got drink and food menus and made sure we had a good place to sit and made sure that if there was anything we needed to ask her and told us that our server would be right there.  We decided to just have a couple of beers and we stepped up to the bar and my wife is more adventurous and explained to Kelly what she liked and didn't like and was givens couple of samples and decided on BuckleDown's Piney Knickers. I explained that I like ""Beer flavored Beer"" and she let me try a couple and I had Metropolitan Krankshaft.   We were both very happy with our selections. The beer was great and the price for River North was good, as well. $6 a pint for each.    The staff was very friendly and Kelly took time to explain how some of the staff had just gotten back from LA to appear on Bar Rescue Back to the Bar that will Air in January and revisits earlier rescues.  I remember being told during my first visit that the main issue, unlike many Bar Rescues, wasn't the staff, but was the owner.  Those issues all seem to have stayed fixed. The plan was to expand the local food and drink menu and they certainly have done this.  I certainly enjoy a Budweiser or Coors Light, but this is not the type of bar for them. They have regular domestics, but even I try new things here!   I believe at the end of Bar Rescue they had 6 local beers on tap but now they have over 20 and they all look great! There was a good mix of professionals and locals there during our visit. At the end of Bar Rescue, they switched the name from Jon Taffer's name of The Local to a combo of their old name and then new and got The Blue Frog's Local 22.  Truly, The Local would be just fine.  There were only a couple of things that I noticed for improvement.  5 years removed from a makeover, it can be easy to do some easy things that seem ok. For example, behind the bar hang a Chicago Bulls flag and a BlackHawks flag. They seem very out of place. You can watch sports here but it's not a sports bar.  If it was a black and white picture of old Chicago Stadium or something it would make sense but the type of flag that would hang at a dive in Wrigleyville seems out of place. I also noticed the cheap tin beer signs on the walls as well and they were nailed up right under vintage pictures of the Wrigley Building and other iconic old Chicago Buildings. It seems like they were vendor giveaways and they were just thrown up because well, why not?  They look very out of place and kind of out of place in a place is such a good mix of working class and classy.  Last thing was the paint is peeling on the walls in a few places and some of the wallpaper murals are peeling as well. It has been 5 years since Bar Rescue and these things don't affect the food or beer but eventually, if not given the proper attention, will begin to become more and more prevalent.   Overall, a great experience.  Highly recommend this for the staff, the beer, the location and the experience. I would love to come at night or on the weekend to get a different experience. I hope to be back in the city soon so I can come back!!!!",0.999,0.815,0.175,0.01,0.44930197508119585

2016-10-24,2.0,"We came to Chicago to be in town to see the Cubs advance to the World Series (and thank heavens they won!) and stopped into Blue Frog's to see if it was the bar we wanted to stay in all night to watch the game. It's definitely a dive, but they have a huge bar and a ton of TVs. Luckily, we got there early enough to grab a high top near the bar before it got absolutely packed. Our waitress was nice enough at first, but as the night dragged on we saw less and less of her. Numerous times we had to flag her down to get more drinks and once we actually went up to the bar to order more because she disappeared. Also, she started to get more and more irritated with us when we stopped her to get more drinks. You could tell she was very busy, especially with a large table she was tending, but that doesn't excuse lack of service for your other tables. They needed more staff, especially with how intense the Cubs game was going to be. Another ding on our server was when my mom ordered a raspberry Stoli shot. Waitress said they don't have that, but my mom said to her she can see the bottle at the bar. Waitress goes ""well, they told me they don't have that"" (without even checking with the bartender) rather than owning up to her mistake. Beware getting shots chilled, as they come watered down because they don't dry the shakers. I ordered a Jose Cuervo silver, which come to find out they were out of. Who runs out of Jose?! Naturally, she ran by me a list of 4 more expensive tequilas. Got one of those, not chilled, and she didn't even offer salt or a lime. Had to take that thing straight and man was it bad. Jose is better than the more expensive crap I got.  On top of a lot of drinks, we ordered two appetizers and both were terrible.  We had the smoked salmon dip and pulled pork quesadillas. Smoked salmon dip was nasty. It tasted a month old and like they poured a ton of dill into it to mask the oldness. Worst smoked salmon dip that has ever touched my lips. Pulled pork quesadillas weren't as bad, but they weren't good. Good amount of meat, but too much BBQ sauce which made it incredibly messy to eat. Salsa on the side was as old as the salmon dip.

We chose to sit at the bar. The stools are a bit odd - felt like they didn't quite match up with the height of the bar - but not a huge deal. The bartender (Brad? Brian? I feel awful that I forget because he was really great) was super attentive and started asking us what kind of beers we liked. He gave us little tasters to decide what we wanted to drink, explained the types that were on the menu, and was a great bartender. It was still early evening (around 6ish), so it wasn't very crowded.  After a couple of drinks, Brad(?) bought us shots - and by us, I mean my husband and my brother. I said I wasn't a shot kind of gal, so he brought over a shot of beer I was contemplating trying (unprompted).

Still not a bad patty though, as I thoroughly enjoyed eating it throughout. Corned beef was decently tasty, though I think I expected a strong flavor from the bacon-fennel kraut, which didn't really come through to me. Oh well, more focus on the burger itself.

The beers: good variety, $5-7. Not bad for a bar in the tourist trap that is Hubbard & Illinois. The food: My dining partner got the blackened salmon salad. To be honest, the salmon was a overcooked and over dressed, in my opinion - he, on the other hand, liked it. I got the Southside Irish burger: half burger patty, half corned beef. At first bite, deliciousness. But the more I ate it, the more I realized that the cheese just kind of tasted dehydrated and old. Meh, for $12 a burger, in River North, not bad. Would I be back?

The night was incredible, ands bartenders Bryan and MoJo took excellent care of my party--quick drinks, delicious shots, and smiles on their faces all night long.  Jose saw to it that my group was having fun and was well taken care of.  Phenomenal and fun staff--check!  Of course, you'd never have a party at a karaoke bar without doing some karaoke.  Steve was the emcee and as always, rocks it.  Something new that I haven't seen at Local before was a screen with upcoming singers (I'd imagine Steve has gotten ""when is my song up"" no less than a million times) so that was cool to see.  He's got an tremendous library of songs, from oldies to top 40--you won't be disappointed with the choices!  Fun night of karaoke--check!

2016-03-22,4.0,"So the positives are that KARAOKE is badass, in general, so any centrally located establishment that isn't a dive that has karaoke is good in my book. Drinks are good (and strong), nice beer selection, and it's a pretty big place.  The draw backs are that both times I've been for karaoke, the host (same guy) has been pretty rude and dismissive of me. I get that you can't prioritize people or change the order or whatever, he just seems to have a pretty pretentious chip on his shoulder which kinda killed my vibe both times.  Also, and I know this sounds way picky, but the sound is pretty awful.  I'm a professional singer, and I get that most people who come to karaoke aren't, but the vocals are turned WAY down (you get drowned out by the backups unless you cup and eat the mic), and there is NOOOO EQ or effects.  So I guess my best feedback would be to the karaoke host guy- soften your edges, remember your job is to encourage people to let loose and have fun, and that people want to be heard and SOUND GOOD. So throw some reverb on that output and turn up the vox in the mix and BAM- this would be a 5 star review.  Will be back, because karaoke, just wish I wasn't nervous about putting my name in every time and getting sass.",0.9792,0.757,0.171,0.072,0.49505381449825897

The waitress was friendly enough but not overly welcoming or too invested in our experience. The wait for our drinks and food was short and the food was delicious, no complaints there. We weren't given silverware and never had the chance to ask for it, we were never checked on during our meal and sat for at least 15 minutes with finished plates and empty drinks in front of us. During our meal, I believe the hostess heard me say something about being dissatisfied and that is why the waitress finally came over. I asked for more water, a side of ranch and some napkins. The napkins never came.  We ordered the Bacon & Jalapeño Mac n Cheese Bites and they were delicious, and the presentation was nice as well.

They feature local beers on tap, and you are well served letting them help you decide what you want. They know the beers, and you want the beers to get to know you.

Also, being a karaoke fanatic the show is a good time.  A diverse crowd gives energy to the night!  Only criticism here is for the KJ to make sure to be cognizant of his playlist.  On occasion he'd allow back to back singers instead of keeping a solid organized playlist. All in all, what a cool place!  The staff is friendly, upbeat, and really want to serve their guests.  I will say, however, night management needs to be careful when cutting too early.  They let the servers go, ours had us cash out, and then they got slammed.  Rather safe then sorry is a great motto!

Funny thing is, it didn't contain beef. The ground pork patty had been cooked medium well, with a great crust on the surface, yet moist in the center. Two crispy onion rings and a generous serving of bacon rounded out the cooked ingredients. The bun was perfectly grilled, and the smoked gouda added a nice creaminess. A great burger. I was also impressed with the mixed green salad I chose as a side. The greens were fresh, as were the accompanying, cucumber, onion and shredded carrots, and the blue cheese dressing, served on the side, was excellent. There is a nice selection of draft beers. I really enjoyed the smoky stout I chose. There are plenty of items on the menu other than burgers, although they're obviously a specialty. There are also plenty of TVs for sports fans, but i was pleased that the audio at lunch time when I visited ran more to Black Sabbath than sportscasts.

It was loaded with too much vinegar herbs or whatever it was but that made it not enjoyable, all the combined meats with it just didn't taste well, perhaps I should have sent it back but at that point I just wasn't in the mood to eat anything else, had two bites and that was it.

The staff knows where we like to sit each time we come: a high top located right next to a window and the karaoke area.  Generally we come at night for karaoke, typically just to watch but occasionally we jump in there. That is always a lot of fun, unless there is an ""older crowd"" and you hear a lot of Frank Sinatra. I love Frank just as much as the next guy, but singing 'My Way' at a bar is just not ideal. If you come during karaoke, be prepared-it is loud.  If you come before karaoke hours, then it's pretty low-key. We have come during the day for an afternoon beer or early dinner. I have never been disappointed with the food or the service. Food-wise, I typically get the veggie burger. Lots of flavor and the patty is homemade. My boyfriend generally gets a barbecue bacon cheeseburger (I forget the name of it). He is always super happy with it. The fries are good: thin and crispy. I generally get the tots. I am a sucker for tots. A bit of advice: if you are just wanting a snack and the appetizers are not looking appealing, order a side of tots. By 'a side' I mean they bring out a huge plate full of tots for like 3 bucks. The mac and cheese balls are good, too. I can feel my arteries clog when I eat them.   My boyfriend and I are both really into local craft beer and this place hits the spot each time. The staff is really knowledgeable about the beer selection. The beer rotates a bit, so make sure you check the screen above the bar and not just the menu.

2014-05-25,4.0,"I am a chronic bar and restaurant researcher.  I know, I know.  Realistically, Yelp should be my support group, right?  But I'm also chronically lazy (think a sloth, with sunglasses on, and a computer to constantly google things, or whatever) to write reviews.  However my recent experience (last night, actually) at Local 22 made me excited enough to share my experience.   Now, normally being a thorough researcher of good eats, admittedly, I went into this establishment blind.  My boyfriend and I had headed into the city with nothing planned which may have been a death move on a Saturday night when the 'Hawks were playing.  That being said, Local 22 looked appealing from the outside so we decided to try our luck.  Fortunately, they had a table available and we were promptly brought menus and water.  Everyone seemed friendly, but it was slightly busy (again, being a Saturday and hockey).   After taking my time on the menu, I opted for a State Street Grilled Cheese (and asked if they could add bacon...score! They did) while my boyfriend chose the Southside Irish burger.  Our server (who's name slips my mind, but he was absolutely friendly) did make mention they were having a rather busy night, so it might take a bit of time for food to come.  We had no problem with that (again, did I mention hockey?) and ordered a couple beers.  Our food though, came out surprisingly quick despite the server's warning.. and WOW.  Amazing.  Turns out though, they brought me the wrong grilled cheese.  Instead of the state street with bacon, I received the Michigan Avenue Grilled Cheese with bacon.  Did I mind? Absolutely not.  It was, hands down, the BEST grilled cheese I've ever eaten.  I'm always on the search for a perfect one, and I definitely found it at Local 22.  Didn't bother to let the server know of the error in ordering, because I was over the moon pleased with what I got instead.  The fries were fantastic also.  Thin shoestring types with just enough crunch but still a little bit of give.  Think McDonald's fries back in the day when McDonald's actually served food that was edible (mid 80s?),  But I was in love with these fries.  My boyfriend thought his burger was fantastic.  It was cooked perfectly, and it was just filling enough so that he was full.  Great value for sure.   My only two issues: 1. I dislike a place that doesn't put all it's prices on the menu.  I have no problem paying what a drink is worth, but I'd like to see what that price is.  Otherwise I feel like a bar is just trying to be shady.  We did order four total of the Rosa Hibiscus Ale by Revolution (Which was really amazing, by the way) but it was a slight annoyance that the price wasn't listed.  2. I didn't see a dessert menu (If there was one and I missed it, my bad!) but it would have been awesome to have a small bite of something sweet before leaving.  Also, they were out of the burger of the month, so we didn't get to try that.   Overall, great place!  I will definitely be back.",0.9981,0.749,0.193,0.059,0.5243812214151199

2014-05-09,3.0,"I went here with a LivingSocial deal for 2 burgers and 2 beers and overall had a pretty good experience! I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, because that seems more appropriate. When my boyfriend and I showed up, the front area wasn't too crowded but some group was having the time of their life in the back with karaoke. I wasn't crazy about how their loudness carried to the area we were - made it a bit difficult to carry on a conversation.  Our waitress was sweet and attentive; the only time she was a bit slow was noticing we needed the check. Not a big deal. I was a bit annoyed that she only mentioned they had a beer special after we had each already had a beer - we definitely would have gone with the special had we known, since the other beers are a good bit more expensive (though you'd never know it, as they don't put beer prices on the menu - HUGE pet peeve of mine) As for the food, it was great! I ordered the back of the years burger, which was a pork patty with onion rings, some kind of barbecue sauce, and cheese. The bun was toasted, which I love, and the patty was nice and juicy. I pretty much devoured the burger, and shortly after inhaled the fries (also delicious). My boyfriend ordered the 1871, which was also incredibly good. He was a bit frustrated that he asked for medium but the burger was cooked well done. He said it's not a big deal, but it's a little irritating. I'd definitely come back to try more burgers, but the place does get a little pricey. $12 for a burger just seems like a bit too much, especially when you start adding in some pricier beers.",0.9934,0.77,0.185,0.045,0.5837585034013606

For those that drink commercial swill they carry cans and bottles of the usual assortment.  The music a little loud considering it's a bar/pub and not a dance hall... 2.5 stars. I ordered the Greektown burger (see photo). Lamb absolutely needs to be medium-rare to rate because if you cook it to much lamb becomes rubber.  My burger was cooked to a perfect medium-rare. The toppings were absolutely delish.  The only thing I didn't like was the bun, which was a ciabatta bun. Lamb is tender but a ciabatta is tough and rubbery,  not the best choice of bread. Every time I bit my sandwich hunks of ground lamb fell everywhere. The Youbrioche bun served with the beef burgers would have been a better choice of bread, 4 stars.

I was hoping to explore the beer list further but after the tasty burger and fries, I was too full to drink more! My only criticism is that the beers seemed a little pricey for locally brewed stuff.

She brought them back in a timely fashion, but we never saw her again. We stopped a barback that was going by to ask for a server, which he promptly got for us. The second server was on the ball! She got our food order and had it back out to us pretty quickly. The food was good, I would eat it again. The noise level left something to be desired though. It was so loud that our group of 4 at a table could barely hear each other. Everyone in there was trying to be heard over everyone else. Can you all tone it down 5 decibels, then everyone can hear themselves think! Karaoke started, which only made it louder. There were a couple of good singers that got up there. Then one went up, an older gentleman Gary. He started his song, and was doing well, then he whipped out a harmonica and belted it out. He was the highlight of our experience there!!",0.978,0.865,0.125,0.01,0.4327485380116959
2013-07-23,5.0,"I love this place and the concept of sourcing local food (and beer) and basing their menu off of the local ethnic neighborhoods. I do preface this as a great Burger and Beer type place.  They have other options which I have not had, the burgers are good enough to keep me coming back. I have been here 3 times and every time is just as good as the first. I have tried something different each time I've gone although the Chorizo Poppers were a must each time.  They are crispy with just the right amount of spice from the pepper and chorizo and a good added texture with the black beans.  The burgers are cooked to order, perfectly done and always amazing.   I've had the Pilsen (pepper jack cheese and jalapeno aoli), the Southsider (home made sauerkraut and Irish cheddar) and most recently the Greektown (lamb burger with herbed goat cheese). I've tried the Maxwell burger as well topped with Maxwell street sausage.  House made chips are fantastic, and so are the tater-tots, but I've tried the red pepper potato salad as well, also fantastic. The beer selection is great, there are some tried and true constants, but they also have a good rotating menu so you are sure to find something you like on one of their 24 taps.  I recommend this for a great casual meal downtown, especially if you like to support the local mom and pop type economy.  The place is never super busy the times I've gone, but if you have a large group I would call ahead to ensure seating. I would also recommend this place for an after work happy hour or a great meeting place before you begin your night downtown.",0.9973,0.745,0.243,0.013,0.5436621315192744

2013-07-06,2.0,"This place is okay. It wasn't crowded so we got in right away. Went straight to the bar to try some of the many beers on tap. Our bartender was good- he seemed to know a decent amount about the beers, and let us sample 2 based on our preferences. My boyfriend and I both ordered a two brothers amber. (I wish he would have told us the name; we only know it's two brothers because of the glass). It was great! I never leave a tab open at a bar, so I closed it out; after that, our bartender never came back, even after looking at my boyfriends empty glass several times.  Unfortunately one short-haired blonde woman behind the bar drove us (and the couple next to us) out fast. The couple next to us asked for a beer recommendation and she said ""well they're all good."" He said he was looking for a beer like Stella, and instead of making a comparison to a beer they had there she just told them that they don't sell Stella, so they left. As for us, we left pretty quickly after she loudly yelled that one of the workers was having sex in the back room.  Overall, the beer was great, and most of the workers were decent. Too bad that woman ruined it for us.",0.933,0.841,0.113,0.046,0.44631336405529953
2013-07-05,3.0,"This is your classic awesome, fantastic neighborhood pub.  They serve amazing drinks.  They really do.  They specialize in local beers. Now, I'm not a huge fan of beer, but this place has even made me a beer lover out of me!  All the staff knows about their beers, so ask them for advice if you need it. Now for the food.  The burgers are amazing and this is the reason you should come here  food-wise.  They just know how to put a burger together.  They serve creative sides.  Everyone has taken to the ""sweet potato fries"" craze.  I've come to find not everyone can do them correctly.  These guys do!  They use the right temperature of oil to fry them in, and fry them for the correct time so that they're not too mushy (sweet potato fries are naturally like that, but they're sooo good!), so they're not too greasy, nor are they too burned.   Their flatbread pizzas are in the ballpark. Good idea, but they need to tweak the measurements of ingredients. The barbecue pizza has the greatest potential.  They need to use a less sugary barbecue sauce...make it less sweet and a few more onions.  The goat cheese on it is a good idea, again not original, but good idea for pub food. However the sweet sauce doesn't complement the goat cheese like it should.   The quesadillas...I want to like them more than I do.  If they would just use chunks of chicken it would make it sooo much better.  The ""pulled chicken"" makes it taste like ""chicken grissle""....not good.  I don't know if it's that or the quality of chicken.  But everything else about it is great, the chips served on the side are incredible!  Who'da thunk!",0.9976,0.747,0.232,0.021,0.6410204081632652
2013-07-04,3.0,"The hubs has been hounding me to go to the Blue Frog because he saw it on Bar Rescue, so when I saw their Groupon I figured I wasn't loosing anything to give it a try. The location is conveniently located between State and Michigan, easily accessible by the L.  It was a nice day so we ate outside.  The split sidewalk patio doesn't provide an ideal dining space, split meaning foot traffic walks right through.  It's in a busier walking area, at least 2 dozen groups walked by during our meal.  And the surrounding area does not exactly provide what I would call a great view. I had a blueberry cider, mag mile turkey burger with a salad for a $2 up-charge.  The hubs had a Matilda, classic burger with pasta salad because fries would have been a $2 up charge.  While they provided plenty of side options to accompany your burger, fries should not be additional.  Most burgers come standard with fries if it's a meal so this was off-putting, especially when the burger was minimum $12. The food was good, the location was okay.  I would describe it as a dive with decent but overpriced food.",0.779,0.928,0.062,0.01,0.49337797619047624

I did not like the burger as much as the apps and I found the pasta salad tasteless.  Service was okay.  We wanted to get out quick after karaoke started.   A funny side note, my boyfriend walked in on an older couple in the bathroom, but the lad quickly explained she was ""just helping her husband with his belt""... ya sure lady...",0.9316,0.851,0.124,0.024,0.7102430555555557
2013-05-29,2.0,"Came here with a friend to use a groupon and we were not impressed. The beer list was old, which is fine, but the waitress should have pointed out which beers were off the list before my heart settled on one of them- and she should have told me which beers were their replacements. Whatever. Got my stout, onto dinner. My friend and I were chatting quite a bit to catch up and our menus were still in front of us. Sign that we were not ready to order, yet the waitress came back every five minutes to ask. Then when we had decided, with our menus put aside, a sign that we were ready to order, we had to wait 20 minutes for her to come back and she either didn't see or ignored my attempts to flag her down. It wasn't even crowded.  I ordered the blackened salmon with green goddess dressing, whatever that is, and my friend had the grilled cheese and soup. The soup too had changed from what was on the menu but we hadn't heard about that until my disappointed friend had to go with whatever they had. I know this place ain't fancy, but if there are specials or menu changes or whatever, it is your job to let us know. Why would you want to stare at two disappointed faces which then turn slightly panicked when trying to decide what they want on the spot? My salmon came out certainly blackened, more like charcoal than charred. I ate it, because I was hungry, but the black sides encased a pretty dry fish and whatever blackening spices were on there were seriously burned off. My friend ate her food but later said it didn't sit well on her stomach.  When it was time to pay, I mentioned I had a groupon and the waitress said I was $2 off, oops- too bad they don't have dessert, so I ordered another beer. Then she brought the check with the original amount, which she made sure to mention was for ""gratuity purposes."" Overall, I've most definitely experienced better, and my friend and I agreed that we wouldn't be coming back.",0.9827,0.783,0.145,0.072,0.4789829512051734

The 1st time I tried to go , I could not find parking on the street so I gave up and left.   This time I had my motorcycle so was able to find parking easily.   I went on a Friday at about 6ish.  The place is nice and there was not a lot of people there yet which was odd to me being that the Bulls were playing.   Anyway , ordered the ""famous"" burger that Bar Rescue raved about.  Not the greatest but I would go back.   Drinks are all local but , personally , am more for the ""traditional"" drinks.   Service was awesome.  The waiter was friendly and extremely attentive.   A little pricey but overall worth it.   Overall ; I would go back as long as parking allows.",0.962,0.836,0.153,0.011,0.44563492063492066
2013-05-13,4.0,Such a great place to sit outside and enjoy a cold local beer. They always have plenty of great options on tap and most are from the vibrant Chicago craft beer scene. The waitstaff are friendly and relaxed (emphasis on relaxed because sometimes you have to flag them down) but always extremely pleasant and accommodating.

2013-04-29,2.0,"For a bar on the show 'Bar Rescue' i expect better service. Our waitress was amazing (if this review was just her then I'd give her 5 stars). But the hostess was straight up rude. I met a friend and the hostess didn't let us seat because we didn't have the entire group 6 people there, when there were plenty of empty tables. Then when we tried to add more chairs she curtly told us no because it would block the way even though the 16 people table next to us was blocking. The hostess was very curt and would walk away without trying to accommodate us in someway. This was not a busy night and there were plenty of open tables so she just had some problem with us. My suggestion is to move onto Muther hubbards or even rock bottom down the street. If the owner of this place reads this I hope you know that your Thursday night hostess is costing you business. I will never come here again and will tell my friends the same.
