The place could probably actually get shut down if someone dug deep enough. They apparently allow underage people in (after a 20 is slipped their way) & will continue to serve extremely intoxicated people instead of cutting them off.

The reason given was that, they had ticket stubs from the game. We spoke with another bouncer and a manager as well as provided proof of our game tickets.

I have not attended this bar during their peak season when they are open 7 days a week during the summer. I am sure it is a completely different experience. During the offseason, this place is probably the most affordable bar with the best food in Wrigleyville. Murphy's Bleachers is good, but this place is consistently cheaper with drinks and food. Very nice interior, lots of flat screen tv's, and a great place if you want to watch a game during the week and you live in Wrigley. Your only other options really during the off season in Wrigley are Sluggers, the Irish Oak, and Vines, all of which are sad and depressing to go to when it's not Summer.  Wait staff has been consistently friendly, and we had a really fun time at their trivia night on Thursdays (we even won a 40$ giftcard).

TORTURE.) and even if I wanted another drink, navigating my way back towards the bar wasn't going to happen. No, if I was moving anywhere, it would be towards the front door... Which is exactly what I did after about an hour and a half. Some guy who claimed he'd just turned 21 would not leave us alone. Either he doesn't pick up on social cues or the thirst is real. Either way, before he finally got the hint and departed, he kissed me on the forehead and grabbed my nose. He grabbed my NOSE. My nose? Why...why would you grab someone's nose?? This was not playful, this hurt! It hurt so much that my reflexes automatically made my fist clench and though I am more of a pacifist, the thought of decking him did briefly flash in my mind. This is MY nose and I wanted to defend its honor! By the time I got home, my nose was still in pain. That is not acceptable behavior, ladies and gents. No ""gotcha nose"" on the dancefloor, please.

This review will focus on the ""venue"" then I will add my review about the actual event, to those listed under  "" PaintNite Chicago, IL"" The Red Ivy is down the street from Wrigley's Field. My first encounter with Red Ivy came from their event planner, who is not a PaintNIte employee - just someone who manages events for Red Ivy. She seemed to do the basic expectations of her job, but didn't seem willing to go the extra mile. I called her office because there wasn't a phone number to contact the actual manager of the PaintNite function. If she had means, but didn't want to ""share"" the contact information she could have offered to get back with me, (go the mile). I called back within five minutes to inquire about parking, but she was away from her desk and didn't have time to return my call. Once we arrived, there was only street parking. The bar was laid out into two sections. One area seemed to be for small groups who wanted booths, (it seemed rather dank), but the other area was better lit, but not the best of lighting for painting, (of course, if one is drinking and painting, I guess it matters little about the lighting - you're there to have fun). The seating was adequate. The bartender was attentive, although, I don't drink - I was there to paint. And like I said above, the lighting was a little too dark  and not from above for painting - but it's not a paint studio - it's a bar! Red Ivy seems fine for it's purpose, (drinking under dim lighting), although parking could be a bear on game nights and/or on weekends.",0.8136,0.916,0.054,0.03,0.3454861111111111
2014-01-05,3.0,"Just caught a game here with my friends last night and had a good experience. Due to the weather, I am guessing that is why the bar was somewhat empty. Our waitress was very nice and plenty of TVs for our viewing pleasure. The food is a little on the pricey side, but it feels like Red Ivy is trying to be a little more posh than a place like Murphy's. When were leaving at around 10pm, the place started to fill up with young men and ladies. When the game was over, the bar started pumping out dance music and showing videos on the TVs. My guess then is, sports bar by day, dance bar by night? Vouchers are available on  restaurant.com .",0.9126,0.872,0.118,0.01,0.43397435897435904

2013-10-27,1.0,"This place deserves no business at all. It is a deep shame that businesses that operate with discreet racism such as Red Ivy continue to run in this country.  After the treatment that my friends and I got from this place, I promise to no longer be passive and tolerate such acts.  Last week my two friends and I decided to go out and celebrate the opening of an exhibition my photography was part of. We came to Wriglyville area and walked up to Red Ivy. I looked inside and commented to my friends that it looked a bit dead but my friends proceeded to show the bouncer their Id's and he refused to look. They thought he was joking and told me to show him my ID. As I went on to do so he firmly said he wasn't going to let us in and why he would do such a thing.... My friends still under the impression he was being sarcastic kept telling me to show him my ID... I looked at him and knew he was not joking. In fact as we stood there he looked passed us and let a whole group of people (who were dressed casually) in without question. I asked the bouncer what was the problem and why he was being rude to my friends and I. We did nothing wrong and all he kept repeating (like a broken record) ""why would I let you in? Why do you want to come here? Why would I do such a thing? I don't want to see your ID""  The bouncer continued to let more people in without question. I looked through the windows of Red Ivy and noticed a very clear "" Caucasian demographic"" I felt sick to my stomach because reality of why we weren't allowed in hit me.... Looking at my two friends I knew they had figured it out as well. We were women of color and someone had clearly instructed the bouncer who surprisingly is an African American man to not allow people like us in. One of my friends was overwhelmed and just wanted to leave and kept insisting that it was embarrassing and to take our business elsewhere. Now I didn't want to go in anymore but I also I didn't want to leave until I spoke to a manager but the bouncer told me ""no.""---- I then asked him to at least look me in the eyes and give me a straight answer to why he could not let us in and he failed to do so. His eyes looked everywhere except our faces. He refused to make eye contact with any of us. It hurt TREMENDOUSLY...  There were some cops on the street and so we spoke to a couple of them. There was one cop Thomas Jenkins who showed actual concern and even approached the bouncer to find out what his problem was. The bouncer created an excuse that we were being rude. The officer knew he was lying and encouraged us to contact better business bureau which we are in the process of doing so.  Now I am aware that this sort of thing happens here in Chicago and elsewhere but never have I experienced something so hurtful and blatantly racist.  I have pity for that bouncer and others such as him that work under managements which encourage modern day acts of segregation....Many like to dismiss stories and experiences such as this one but for those that do care even a little bit,  I implore you to speak out and continue to fight for humanity, peace, equality and love. peace&luv HG",0.597,0.737,0.138,0.125,0.4268035714285715

I had the misfortune of falling victim to not only a drunken idiot at this bar but also the incredibly rude and passive service by the bouncers there.  I was sitting at a table with friends, when a drunk guy tripped and fell on our table, forcing the table on top of my left foot and spilling my drink everywhere.  Mind you, my friends and I noticed this guy was the same guy that we thought got kicked out of the bar for being too drunk at an earlier point that night.  After a confrontation with the guy, the guy stubbornly agreed to buy me another drink.  The guy who fell on our table was a complete moron to both myself and my friends post-incident, but this review is not about him.  In reality though, we felt this guy should have been instantly kicked out of the bar after what he did and how he acted towards me and my friends. It wasn't until after the guy left to get me a new drink until I realized that my big toenail ripped in half and that blood was everywhere.  There were bouncers present who both witnessed the event take place AND after I noticed my foot.  At no point did the bouncers do absolutely anything about the situation UNTIL they were asked for a rag and bandaids from my friends.  Absolutely unprofessional and, frankly, unsafe.  Safety should be any bar's #1 concern; especially a bar that had a stabbing take place there several months ago! Later, when my friends and I noticed that this idiot still was not kicked out of the bar, I asked a nearby useless bouncer why he was still in the bar.  The answer I was rudely given was, ""He was kicked out before and got let back in for some reason.  He bought you another drink though, so why should he be kicked out again?""  Are you kidding me?!  Red Ivy would not lose a great amount of business if one idiot is kicked out.  Just saying. My recommendation for Red Ivy would be to get rid of the bouncers or teach them a lesson or two in professionalism and safety of its patrons.  Or else, I would not be surprised if a lawsuit or two would come its way in the near future.",0.7792,0.774,0.119,0.107,0.436013986013986

There are a few other Browns bars in town but they're all tiny places...there are way too many Cleveland fans in Chicago to fit in Vaughns.

I have a lot of friends who frequent Red Ivy because they are Purdue alum... I'm sure I'll be returning with them at some point.",0.937,0.779,0.152,0.07,0.5140674603174604

Meanwhile, I watched her as she continued to pour old ketchup into other bottles. She never checked on me or asked if I needed another beverage.  After I flagged her down, She blamed the delay on the steak having to be grilled.  She magically brought out the salad in less than five minutes and the steak was barely warmer than room temperature.

There wasn't anything special about it.  Though the price to add ingredients wasn't listed on the menu, my bill was jacked up $10.  I'm fortunate enough to have brought a  restaurant.com  gift certificate.

There is dancing yes, but there isn't really a dance floor big enough to dance on. The back room is nice if you have a private party to attend, but more often than not, I'm in the front. It's set up very strangely, but I guess they did what they could with the space. I've never eaten the food here, but honestly, I probably wouldn't want to come here during the day. The drinks are a tad overpriced, unless you are with party that comes with a drink special. The waitresses are nice as well, when I use them, but the bartenders are a little slow sometimes. I guess the way I'm describing the place isn't terrible, but there are two big reasons why I would prefer to not come here again: 1) Bathroom attendants. I have nothing against them themselves, but it is always awkward for me when I just want to use the bathroom and wash my hands really quickly. I do know how to put soap on my hands. It is also awkward if you are all out of cash and have only been using your card at the bar-you can't very well tip the bathroom attendant with your card. And then you feel awful because you can't tip. 2) There is a particular bouncer that has been rude to me two out of the three times that I have been there. I'm sure he does not remember me either time, but I definitely remember him. He checked my ID and snatched it away from me, as if I did something wrong. When I asked him why, he said it's because I was coming in the bar alone. I replied that I was meeting my boyfriend, to which he said ""I didn't see no black guys walk in here."" If it's not obvious at this point, my boyfriend is not black. I do not have an issue with this. For someone to call me out on an issue they have which has nothing to do with me because I do not know them, is just completely unacceptable. Also, so what if a girl is coming into the bar alone? Frankly, it made me uncomfortable and completely soured the evening that I was going to have there. At that point, I wanted to leave as soon as possible. I probably won't go back to this bar for this reason, but that's ok, because I know there are other patrons that will be there for Red Ivy.",0.9112,0.82,0.102,0.077,0.5025075585789872

The drinks came up right away- spicy, and peppery it was quite simply was what the ""doctor ordered"". But then we sat, and sat,and sat waiting for our food. Finally when the food came up (at least 40 minutes later)- it was clear that it had been sitting under the heat lamps as the bun was dried out, the meat was dry and the cheese had that plastic, fake look.

I had chicken wings (aka fun stuff) and the goat cheese crostini. The crostini was served with a spicy marinara with a tasty hunk of goat cheese at the bottom. Uhh...yes, please. I definitely want to go back to try some of their other Italian dishes the next time I am in the area. P.S. The crackhead behind the turntables cranks the music up louder than a nightclub!

2008-07-04,3.0,"I realized last weekend that I much prefer this bar during the day. I have been a few times at night and have never been too impressed. It's always entirely too crowded and loud for my taste. The few times I have been, I have sat at the bar (a general preference of my friends and I) and every time I am splashed with beer at least once. I know my way around a beer tap enough to know that whomever designed their bar should never design another. The taps are on top of the bar and the grill is somewhat built into the bar - with no perimeter to prevent the overflow of beer from spilling everywhere. If you're lucky enough not to take a splash to the face, make sure you don't put anything on the bar that you wouldn't want soaked in beer. I came here during the day last weekend to watch the Cubs/Sox game. It wasn't very crowded so we were able to snag a booth on the side of the elevated area and had a great view of the TV. As a matter of fact, there wasn't really a bad spot in the house to watch the game.  Our server was very attentive and even though we were drinking mixed drinks she brought us both water (without us asking) once we ordered food. We kept things simple and ordered chicken fingers and a burger to split. We got what we expected from food in a bar with the exception of the fries. I was pleasantly surprised to find that they were freshly hand cut and they tasted much like the ones my mother would hand cut. I can't say I have said anything I've ever consumed in a bar was ""just like mom used to make"" before now. During the day and the night Red Ivy is - well like day and night. It's not a bad place to go on a weekend afternoon to relax and catch a game, but relaxing is not the word I would use to describe this bar after dark.

The food was gross. I ordered a chicken breast sandwich and it came with diced chicken pieces that were clearly cooked weeks ago and reheated in the microwave. The fires were over spiced and then coated in something sweet. I did not eat them...that is so out of character. No one at my table was happy with there food. When it came time to get our bill...I had to track down the waitress. Additionally, the television was so loud it was hard to hear anyone. Oh and our table was super wobbly.  GROSS food and bad service.  ****EDIT*** I recently, because of an interesting set of circumstances, returned here for a meal. I went to dinner on Wednesday and my experience was much for enjoyable. The music was at a much more enjoyable level and I was able to have a conversation. Our waitress was much more enjoyable. Our food was better as well. This time around I ordered a burger and it was decent...pretty similar to most bar hamburgers. I would not go out of my way to try this place but it is not too bad.

Decor is nice, woody and ivy-y. LOTS of big screen TV's and a nice long bar (that's also woody).  The reason for the one star loss is this: The one time I went there that there was NOT a cubs game on the tube, they had the craptacular Wrigleyville standards playing WAY TOO LOUD. I mean, I know everyone loves Shakira when they're drunk but does it have to make my eardrums bleed? Also, the bathroom experience I had tonight was like something on candid camera. I went into the 1st stall, no TP. The second stall...no toilet SEAT. That's right, screwed it right off...gone. But that stall had a large loose roll of TP so I retreated to stall #1 with my giant roll of TP. If you go in that stall right now, my pee is still there because the toilet didn't work. The soap dispensers had been ripped clean off the wall and the holes left were filled in with wadded up napkins.

On the positive side, this place has great pizza!  I grew up on the south side with Palermo's pizza.  The sweet sauce is the best.  To our waitress's credit.  She did ask us if we were going to the concert because our pizza would take 45 minutes.
