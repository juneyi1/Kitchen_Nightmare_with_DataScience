N.B.  They say the buffalo wings are ""award-winning,"" and perhaps that is true in the literal sense, but they built my hopes up a little too much.  Don't get me wrong; they were very good wings, but I am willing to travel across the city for the right wings, and these were not them.  A couple of my friends ordered other stuff, and they were happy with it, so don't shy away from the food.  It's better than I would expect.

For those of you new in town, Fizz has reached out and grabbed hands with the bookers (MP3) of some of the most fun, roucous and crazy small label bands to come through Chicago. Very smart (or extremely stupid plan) on the part of Fizz. So why does this matter? Because Fizz might become a very different bar this year than it was a year ago.  The first floor is your standard neighborhood Chicago bar. Nice woodwork, a dozen or so tables to sit at and a menu of decent, but not amazing pub grub. Good weekday specials, if you check their site. Then the music venue stairs split off like Sub T - but with less air circulation.

I get it - it's playoff season for Chicago sports, but make a choice - music or TVs. If you were doing one, you at least would please one crowd instead of half-heartedly (or mistakenly) doing both and pleasing no one. Service was terrible. While two bartenders can manage some busy bars, the two working this Saturday night were not those kind of bartenders. They were slow, not trying to hurry/hustle. They also were not taking people at the bar in the order they've been sitting/waiting. I was thankful I had a wristband deal because their credit card/tab system looked like an absolute disorganized mess!

2012-11-03,3.0,"Located on North Lincoln Ave, half way between Melrose and Belmont, it took me a while to get to the place. Coming from the loop, your choices are basically CTA brown line to Paulina or taxi, both of which took about a 1/2 hour. Once you reach the area, however, this place is pretty hard to miss. There's a giant sign on the outside announcing the business - just look for the giant FIZZ sign. This place is best know for its beer garden, beer flights and pizza. I haven't made it to the beer garden yet, as it's always been cold out when I go to this place.  Inside it's a relatively typical bar/restaurant area. Sitting at the bar is comfortable enough experience, and the music isn't so loud that you can't hear the person next to you. The main problem is the speed of the service - I sat for nearly 10 minutes before anyone even asked if I wanted anything or being offered a menu. I know the bartenders saw me, they looked directly at me several times. I'm not sure if they are under staffed or under trained, but service time definitely needs to improve. What this place lacks in service, however, it makes up for in beer selection and fantastic food. A split a Sweet BBQ Chicken pizza with a friend, and it was *fantastic*. One of the few times I have sat and finished off my half of a pizza in one sitting. The pizzas are thin crust, easy on the cheese and heavy on the rest of the toppings. Running about $16 for a medium (14"") pizza, you're paying for toppings and not bread or cheese.  The beer selection is good as well. I did a flight of beer, which gives you 4 sample servings of up to 4 different beers (you may choose to repeat a beer in your flight if you know you really like one). The staff had us write down which beers we wanted and then presented the beers to us on a tray which had them in the order that we wrote them down in. This was a nice change since I could connect which beer was which for the future, instead of just having 4 random beers. While the food is good, the slow service makes it so I probably wont be going out of my way to get back here.

It's a bit of a trek from where I live, so I never go there out of the sake of ""convenience"" but I've enjoyed my experiences there so far. I had a groupon to use up (two beer flights and an appetizer) so my boyfriend and I came here for a Sunday Funday. We were the only patrons in the bar around 12:30 on a Sunday after they had been open for about an hour and a half. We decided to sit outside in their beautiful beer garden and look over the menu. They have a decent rotating draft beer offering of a bunch of craft beers, which was a definite plus. For the beer flight deal we were able to pick any four 4oz beers on the draft menu. I was happy to see this as many package deals include the same types of beer flight samplers, ranging from Blue Moon to Allagash White, so it was nice to mix it up a bit. The waitress had us write down which four beers we wanted, and they served the flight up as we had written them down, which was a nice touch. We enjoyed our flights and also noticed that they have a great bottle selection as well. For our appetizer, we put in an order for the Steak Quesadilla and ordered an additional side of sweet potato fries. The quesadilla was HUGE and about twice the size of most offerings from other bars. We definitely didn't need the additional side of fries, but I was definitely stuffed after my ""half"" of the quesadilla. The quesadilla itself was just okay, nothing to write home about--it had the tortilla, meat, and cheese aspects covered. The salsa and guacamole that accompanied it wasn't ""made to order"" or ""super fresh"" but it was what I expected. As for the sweet potato fries, they were crispy and delicious. They were reminiscent of the fries from Smoke Daddy, so I happily munched my way through them. All in all it was a pleasant experience on a Sunday afternoon. My only complaint is that the service was a bit slow. We were the only people there for about 30 minutes and it took awhile for the beers to come out with two bartenders and a waitress. We were in no rush so it didn't really bother me, but I just thought that was important to note. The staff was super friendly though. I'll definitely try to stop at Fizz again before the weather turns cold, it's hard to turn down a bar with decent food, a great beer offering, and a fantastic beer garden.",0.9989,0.754,0.226,0.019,0.5990740740740741

The rest of the garden is filled with trees and shrubs, and even a waterfall. There are plenty of comfy couches to sit.  The outdoor area closes at 12 on weekends, but we didn't have any trouble finding a table inside. The music was very loud inside though, it was hard to hear yourself think.  The service was outstanding, and the drinks are reasonably priced. We had a groupon, so we got two beer flights (four 4 oz beers) and a yummy spinach artichoke appetizer. We also ordered multiple drinks afterwards, I really liked their pear cider (bottles). They have a nice selection of different beers on tap.

The food is ok, but it's nasty pub food and I think you can do better at other pubs. I have been there several times for other events, but went there over the weekend with some friends to watch the games. OMG our waitress was bad. For starters I think she was annoyed that we weren't ordering much, but apparently filling our water was a huge effort for her. Also, at one point my friend ordered another beer and instead of coming back with a drink she comes with our check. Weird. I informed her we weren't leaving. We had a few other people join us who ordered food and drinks and it seemed like she started to care a bit more and made the effort. One of us wanted to leave early and asked our waitress if she could give her a separate bill, her response was 'No, just give your friends cash for what you ordered'. Um, that wasn't cool. Then we realized why she said that- if you have a party of 5 or more they automatically add 18% to your bill. So if my friend were to pay separately then she couldn't add on this tip. I was a little annoyed at that, but she's lucky as she probably wouldn't have gotten 18% from us in the first place. Fizz also does their tabs old school- by hand. Check their math. The table next to us realized that this same waitress added in 22% tip for their party of 5 or more which is just poor business practice in my book.

Fizz has singlehandedly made Monday nights my favorite night of the week.  Two reasons. 1) Almost every Monday, they open their upstairs space to swing/blues DJs from around the area and sometimes to visiting jazz bands for dance.  Starting at 9:30 and ending 3 hours later, there's few better places to spend your Monday night.  Even if you hate dancing, the music is remarkable and most of their DJs know how to read the room well enough to spin music that people will enjoy.  Watch the game downstairs while you eat the Monday Night Special (currently, one of the better $4 burgers in the area but it changes regularly), then head on upstairs.  Bring extra shirts because you WILL sweat. 2) The Monday night bartenders are top-shelf.  You want your crantinis, I'm sure the staff can make them just fine, but it's hard sometimes to find someone who can make classic drinks pop again.  On the main floor, Elizabeth made me a martini that was so dirty you'd think Prince ordered it.  I got a Manhattan so smooth I could feel all my worries drift right out the door.  And I got a hand-muddled mojito so good it created a mini-wave of mojito orders for the evening... sorry about that, E.  Upstairs, Scotty is no different -- tell him your mood and he'll make the right drink to either complement or counteract it.  For me, one good drink trumps three crappy ones and the bartenders at Fizz know how to mix them well. Also, the sweet potato fries are quite good and the tuna steak burger hits the spot, but the previous commenters are on the mark -- service on a moderately busy night tends to be slower than what's normal in the area.  It's the only reason I'm holding back a star.

Drinks They're all reasonably priced and have a pretty nice selection including bottles of Ace Pear cider and Edmund Fitzgerald porter on tap.  I went all ciders that night but I'll definitely be needing have a couple pints of the EF next time I'm in. 3. Food Their burgers all come with a beef, turkey, or veggie patty option and are decent sized and come with your choice of potato product or side salad.  One of these choices is tots which always gains a place a star in my book.  My The Works turkey burger was super tasty and juicy which is great because I've ordered a few elsewhere that were so dry that they were like eating a turkey meat wafer.

2011-02-11,1.0,"My post somehow disappeared, so I decided to re-post it.  (Sept 2010) I had a party at Fizz and had the most terrible experience! I sent this letter to management and they didn't even write me back! The management staff at Fizz needs to go back to hospitality school. I would not recommend this bar for anyone; especially for people who are looking to have a party. Dear Dan- As a frequent patron of Fizz, I can only say that the service and treatment I received last night was despicable, distasteful and left an impression that won't soon be forgotten. Not one person who attended my party will ever be back. When I arranged the party our email exchange clearly stated that Miller and Bud Lite products were included in the package, as well as two draft beers of my choice. Upon my arrival, I was informed that the only beers available for our consumption were 312 and Green Line. I approached the manager in an attempt to correct this, only to engage in an entirely foul and disrespectful verbal altercation at their prompting. The manager questioned our arrangement, necessitating that I show him our email exchange and even took my phone to go show someone else. I didn't appreciate that I had to begin my night arguing when I was under the impression that our package had been clearly set. I am confused as to why not one, but two people were unclear about your own party packages. Not to mention, I was flat out lied to about the bar being ""out"" of the Miller/Bud drafts until I insisted we were provided with bottles then instead. The cheapest beer there, yet we were not allowed to have it since it was not stated in the party package - IT WAS. Furthermore, the guests in my party were told in order to join me outside, they HAD to buy a wristband. I was under the impression that I was responsible for at least 15 people purchasing the package in order to avoid a credit card fee, but was not told EVERY PERSON had to purchase one. This also was clearly stated between us as I said ""I know I will have at least 25 people coming, but cannot guarantee everyone will want the wristband."" Never once was I told that that wasn't okay. It really put a damper on the event when my grandparents and others who were NOT DRINKING and clearly stated that, still had to pay $30 to say goodbye to me. Since I'm leaving Chicago to attend graduate school, the party was intended to be a farewell, not an expense. If, in fact, that is the policy concerning access, I should've been made aware of this earlier. It was embarrassing and costly, literally. And, with the exception of our overworked server, the reception we received from numerous bartenders was appalling. Having worked in the service industry, I am extremely sympathetic to those who have to attend to the desires of numerous clients. However, the attitudes and attention we were given was extremely lacking and several bartenders were unabashed in hiding their frustration. One slammed a drink at the bar so hard it splashed onto my mother, while another refused to even take our order after having to go through the whole Bud Light/Miller Lite fiasco again. Overall the night was beyond disappointing. I find it a blessing that I have friends and family who were willing to work with me given the circumstances, and felt it necessary to let you know you have lost an entire group of 30+ people born and raised Chicagoans who have lived in the neighborhood their entire lives but will never be your customers again.",0.9094,0.811,0.103,0.086,0.5031481481481481

The cast regularly writes new material, but clearly they'll stick with the skits that get a great reaction. After each show, the members come down the stairs to the regular part of Fizz and speak with audience members. We were lucky enough to chat with Danielle Wheeler, one of the show's beauties, about her unfortunate dating past (I could definitely sympathize). The cast members drink right along with the audience; Danielle informed us that they don't know which bottles contain alcohol until the play is underway so those liquor-faces after doing shots don't require much acting at all! I was very happy to see this play, especially since it involved drinking, and because the birthday girl bought the tickets off of Groupon! Ours were each $12.50 and regular priced tickets are $20.

The food, though, is meh.  I've said it before and I'll say it again: I love that bars are taking pub grub up a notch and giving their clients some truly great food.  However, Fizz is doling out the basics...without much flair.  For example, the Bottle Caps (fried jalapenos) are just that: Fried jalapenos with ranch.  The pizza actually kind of tastes like Jack's brand frozen pizza.  No excitement.  Nothing memorable.  I did enjoy the hummus, which had a great red pepper flavor, but it may have been a fluke. While the food was boring, the trivia was anything but.  It's handled in 6 rounds of three questions where you assign point values to each question after you hear the categories.  While my team was not victorious (erm, 9th place, to be exact) we still had fun, including a win in the very important ""Shots Round"" question series where our team scored a round of shots on the house.

Atmosphere is non pretentious and laid back, and the staff is usually really friendly. I notice there are some reviews here that ding the service, and it is understandable.

I recommend the homemade pizzas, that almost as good as any thin crust pizza joint in the city. They have a good selection of apps, with many faves like the tempura chicken tenders, quesadillas, and mini burgers. I would love to see them change up their menu a bit more, but thats probably because I'm there so often.  Tap selection is really good. They do a great job of featuring craft brews, and their selection tends to stay contemporary. Add to that a ton of bottle selections, and you'd be hard pressed not to find a beer you liked there.  Finally, Fizz does a great job of featuring daily specials, like half priced pizzas and 2 for 1 apps throughout the week. Makes going there a reasonable alternative to dining at home. They also have interesting ongoing events like tastings, trivia nights, etc that break the monotony of your standard bar vibe and help bring some diversity to the crowd.

The bartender and servers inside were hilarious and helpful.  The only downside we saw was that it looked like the only way you could get a server to talk to you outside was if you ordered food. Otherwise, you had to trek it back to the inside bar for drinks. Still, all-in-all, I had fun and will definitely go back.",0.9882,0.696,0.274,0.03,0.6147899159663865

We gave him one of the tables and then ended up moving over another table so we'd have enough room. He then came back to our table and asked us to move again -- this time we had our food at the table. I told him that he was being rude to us, and he blew it off like no big deal and still acted frustrated that we wouldn't continue to play musical tables.

Considering last night was the night before Halloween, we found out that Fizz was one of the last stop for their Halloween Pub Crawl.  In addition to that, there was also another show at said stage earlier that night, so needless to say, the place was PACKED! As far as the place, the first floor of Fizz consists of one main bar on the left side when you enter.  The place in itself was very long and narrow, with many high top tables along side the bar (which has stools) and a group of tables at the end towards the back.   Thankfully, when we got there, the first show was about to start, so that cleared a good number of tables for us to sit at.  We originally wanted to get some food prior to our late show, so we opted to sit toward the back where the tables were. First thing we noticed...the service.  Despite the fact that this place was PACKED, they were very attentive and friendly.  The server was awesome and responsive; and so was the busboy.   Foodwise, I highly recommend the artichoke and spinach fondue dip.  Be careful, the plate is sizzling when it came out but it was outstanding.  We also ordered the ""bottle caps"" as a starter (which was fried jalapeno slices) and that was good as well.   For dinner I ordered what they called ""the after school"" which consisted of a grilled cheese sandwich (which was very good) and a side of tomato soup (which was tasty).  I also ordered a side of the ""fried potato salad"", and that was not bad, except I would have ordered the sauce (I think it was thousand island) on the side.  The sauce made the fried potatoes a bit soggy...and I am not a fan of soggy potatoes. One of my friends ordered a side salad with an order of nachos, and talk about a HEALTHY portions of nachos (it's enough to feed you and a few friends...and was great).  My other friend ordered the three cheese grilled cheese with roasted peppers and bacon, and that looked awesome.

2009-09-18,5.0,"Having worked in the food/bar industry for a long period of time (all through high-school and college), there is nothing that bothers me so horrifically than that of a customer who, even when acknowledging that they too have worked in the food/bar industry, insist on not only being exceptionally demanding, but overly rude. It is a difficult job, and sometimes the service isn't as fast, or as accurate as you want, and that is obvious. Mistakes happen. Servers and bartenders get swamped... It is as simple as that. All the blame of a restaurant is placed on the staff - on the server or bartender specifically, and usually with invalid or ridiculous reasons. What's that Mary? You couldn't get the drink you wanted because it was out of stock? Restaurants and bars run out of stock. It's a fact of life. Some weeks, sales of a particular beverage or entree exceeds normal stock. Sometimes it takes awhile to check the stock, and sometimes there are numerous things going on for a server to cater to you, specifically. You are not the center of the universe. You should show courtesy and respect to your server, not rudeness, even when they make mistakes and don't live up to your standards. They are, in a simple word, serving you. As such, do not confuse them as your servant. They are not your slave, and they are not subservient to you. It is an exchange of service for compensation. If you feel they did not serve you well enough to deserve your compensation, then you have a right not to tip. It doesn't give you a right to libel every server in the establishment, nor the bartender, nor anyone else by making blanket statements like fizz has ""horrid service."" You're entitled to an opinion, it's your right as a human being, but not when it does harm to others. You do an injustice to all the employees. You hurt them. Because of your thoughtless review, a potential patron will not go to that bar and that server will not get that tip, regardless if they provide great service or not. You must be specific, and you must figure out the problem. I've only ever had exceptional service at Fizz. They've been kind and waited on me with much attention. Brought me beers and food quickly. Yet, sometimes when it's incredibly busy and they're swamped, I don't get as quick service as when it's slower. That is obvious. You cannot accurately predict how many people will come into a bar or restaurant at any given time. You can try to guess, but you can't expect them to bring in twenty servers to handle a crowd that might never come. No one would make money at all. And problems like this ALWAYS HAPPEN. It goes with the industry. If you have a problem, and you bring it up, and it is not resolved, then it is a fault of the establishment. They can only correct their mistakes, and neither are they omnipotent. There is a way to do things, politely and nobly, and then there is the way to do it which is wrong and vindictively. Bring up your qualms with the server or the bartender. Tell them is there is a mistake or if there is a problem with the service. But you must also be considerate of the situation. Great Service: Drinks come quickly along with the food.  Great Food: Not your sleazy bar food. Real entrees, great apps, large portions for cheap prices. Great Drinks: Poured just right, and if not, remade for free - isn't this common etiquette? I'd suggest going to the bartender or the waitress before you go to management with a shi**y attitude. Great Environment: Caters to a wide and diverse clientele. Sports, Out-door smoking Patio, Special Events, Parties, Dj's, Live Music, Theatre, Comedy.... Great Staff and Management: Every problem I ever had has been resolved when I approached them with respect and without trying to swindle them. Cheap Prices and great specials!: You can't beat $2 well drinks, 25 cent wings, $5 beer and a shot, Half-price pizza, and $5 beer and a burger on specific nights.

My kickball team and I (aka Porkchop Sandwiches) were looking for a beer garden to kick back, eat, and celebrate our Yelp tournament win. Fizz was chosen based on my and another Yelper's recommendation and for that Chops I'm sorry. I was the first to arrive and was able to work with someone to pull together a table for 10 in the beer garden, which was where the top notch service began and ended. I sat at said table by myself for 5 minutes without offer of a beer, water or food menu waiting for my party to arrive. When my party arrived we sat for another 5 before menus appeared.  After placing our drink orders (another 5-10 minute wait after the menus) we waited for 10 minutes for our drinks only for her to come back to our table empty handed and imform us the were out of the Dark Horse Raspberry I ordered. I placed my new order and we noted that we were ready to order our food too (we were hot and hungry!) since we were afraid she would take off for another extended period. Her response was a smug ""I know"" and another vanishing act. Five minutes later all of the drinks sans my second choice drink arrived and she was off again without a word leaving us open-mouthed in shock. Another 5 minutes and no sign of her anywhere, we were contemplating leaving, but we decided to get a manager or someone to find her first. It still took another 5-10 minutes for her to show and actually take our food order. When our food arrived, delivered by someone else, a number of the dishes were bungled, not majorly, but wrong all the same, but we were so hungry we didn't want them sent back. The guy running food was 100x more on top of things than our server. We only saw her once during our meal to remind her she forgot someone else's beer and then again about 10 minutes after most of our plates had been cleared to when we flagged her down to request our check. The patio was busy, I get it I've waited tables too, but our server didn't seem to be giving any of her tables any attention. If she had tables inside too and was super slammed it would have been nice for her to give us a heads up or at least apologize. Instead, we were convinced she was vying for the title of  ""Most indifferent server of the Year."" We all agreed the food runner deserved the automatic gratuity more than she did. At least he checked on us, got our missing items and was prompt and friendly! Sorry Fizz, your food is good, your patio rocks, but your horrid service forces me to knock you down to 2.5 stars.

Here's the deal:  I arrived late and did not stay too long. Other tidbits:  I have never seen such drunk people at a bar.  Was it the weather, was it the time?  It was about midnight and there were more incredibly drunk people there than I had ever seen.  Some guy asked me to help him beat up another guy while I was in the bathroom.  To top it off, they were out of soap! There is a beer garden, it is nice.  There is food, I had some leftover pizza that other people had ordered. It was good, legitimately.  The staff seemed a little bit ornery.  Yes.  Ornery.  Does every beer garden in the city close at midnight?  It must.  They were really filing us out of there quickly.   In the end, I might go back here if encouraged.",0.9737,0.868,0.132,0.0,0.4742424242424242

The bf and I started off with a dozen 25 cent wings, half hot and half sweet. They were some of the best wings we have had so far since moving to the city. While we couldn't have 12 of the hot or 12 of the sweet, the half and half combination is perfect. I then got a salad for my entre with a tuna steak. The tuna steak was HUGE and had great flavor. For the amount of money we paid, I was thoroughly impressed.  We returned on a Saturday night and had the wings again, minus the 25 cent special. Still delicious and worth the extra couple of bucks. I have had a couple mixed drinks there and was not too impressed. I definitely did not like the alcohol to mix drink ratio. The beer was reasonably priced which somewhat made up for the lack of alcohol in the mixed drinks. Lastly, I LOVE the Beer Garden.

Did I mention that the beer garden is Huge?! It is a great place to be on the right night because depending on your mood, you can roam from the beer garden, to the main bar, or to the loft. The bartenders RoCk as well. Aaron makes AmAzInG drinks, ...is a shot chef, and creates a purrrfect grey goose dirty martini! The ambiance is also publiscious, but each room holds a different vibe. The main bar is just the right blend of lighting, music, and old-world pub decor. LoVe It,... but don't go,because...

They have special events throughout the week including trivia in the bar and swing dancing upstairs. They have a great beer garden which they keep covered and heated in the summer and open and lively in the warmer months.  The food and bar service is great and I've always had a great time sitting at the bar and eating/drinking with friends. Fizz always has drink or appetizer specials, even on busy nights like Friday and Saturday. The food is more interesting and tasty than your usual bar fare and the servers/bartenders are great and providing menu recommendations.  Unlike most 'college' bars in the area, Fizz is lively but not annoying. The music is played at volume that allows you to chat with friends, and they often have live music/djs later in the night. They'll change any of the tvs for you upon request which I always appreciate. While I rarely sit at a table,  I have found that service to be good as well.

There are a number of seemingly good taverns at the Belmont | Ashland | Lincoln intersection. Fizz is apparently aiming for the mid-range: i.e.: not a complete dive bar, but not something hoity-toity either. I was only on the first floor. Fizz has specials every night of the week. On Mondays, the deals are the pizza buffet from 4:00 pm - 6:00 pm, and the ""burger & a pint"" for $6.00 deal all evening. The ""pint"" selections [16 oz.] are Samuel Adams Boston Lager, Blue Moon, and Miller Lite. Fizz has other good selections on draft. They include Magic Hat's #9 lager [$6.00], Harpoon I.P.A. [$6.00], & Rogue Dead Guy Ale [$6.00]. The cheeseburger was good. You get french fries with it. Those seemed to be institutional, but they were good. The venue has lots of TVs, and DirecTV dbs, but I couldn't tell if it had any premium subscriptions. It _shall_ try to find an event on a cable | satellite channel if you have a good idea on which channel it is. The venue itself looks as though it has been a tavern since the mid-1930s.  I have read through other reviews, and I respectfully offer that I had no delays or snags with the barstaff this night. This venue would get a 3 1/2 star rating if I could give it. I will not give it the fourth star because, as you might have inferred from above, I thought its prices were a little above average. But you could give here a try. Ask what are its beer specials for that evening, and drink accordingly. Transit options: This is a breeze compared with some of the other venues I have reviewed.

Fizz is a great place with some great food and tasty beverages. The servers were super sweet. I went there twice this last weekend. HOWEVER, my one main complaint is service is very SLOW. So, that said -if you are not in a hurry and are having a good time with friends, it's not that big of a deal. However, when you really want a beer on a hot day and it takes 20 minutes for someone to acknowledge you and then another 10-15 to get your drink, that's slow service.   If they can improve that aspect, they will get 5 starts in my book!",0.9858,0.748,0.237,0.015,0.44992424242424245

The service wasn't anything memorable, but that said, it wasn't as horrendous as others have written.  Perhaps I lucked out.

Yes, we got married in the loft above Fizz Bar and Grill and it was the best time of our lives.  They provided everything we needed including catering, table, dishes, linens, PA, a stage, bartenders and staff.  They worked wonderfully hard to make our wedding everything we wanted it to be.   We were able to decorate how we wanted, have our own DJ's, and bring in our desserts from outside as well. The only thing keeping me from giving them 5 stars has to do with the food.  First off, let me say it was great too, that wasn't the problem at all.   We're vegetarians, as were many of our guests, but we didn't want to restrict our meaty guests so we ordered a couple meat dishes among our buffet style appetizer faire.  I would have liked a few more creative veggie options - it was somewhat limited.  However the real issue was the order of serving, the veggies were all served first and meat last instead of being better mixed.  So our guests just thought they were appetizers.  :(    No one's fault really, it's a tough thing to manage - but by the time my husband and I made it to the table, there was no veggie food left.   So really, the problem might be all the food was too good and we should have ordered more.",0.9749,0.812,0.129,0.059,0.47889880952380953

We ordered a couple different appetizers to split, and every one of them was excellent. Our food and drinks were moderately priced, and totally worth it.  I can't remember if the music came from a playlist or a jukebox, but I do remember being pleasantly surprised with how god some of it was.

And because East Coast Neighbor suggested it and his recommendations for greasy food that's bad for you are usually pretty dead-on. Thursday night is their wing night, and they hold the distinction of serving them in a BUCKET that you get to reach your entire arm into to look for the last wing, which is probably hidden in folds of sauce-laden wax paper that will transfer to your arm and probably your armPIT and THEN if you have had enough beers, you can try to LICK all that sauce off your arm and your friends will all find this hilarious. Anyway - wings are a tad dry in terms of the meat, and a lot dry in terms of the sauce. Maybe it says something about me that I like my wings swimming in a puddle, but I can't think of what that would be - other than that I like the sauce. But then again, East Coast Neighbor got BBQ wings because he is a va-jay-jay. Our waiter...seemed...new. And nervous. And I feel for him, waiting tables is a thankless, and often shitty job. But he seemed jittery and scared the whole time. Though he did jostle his tray and drop some drinks - on my roommate and East Coast Neighbor - which may have had something to do with it. Guinness was $3. Shots of Jameson were $4. Exterior is ADORABLE. Beer garden is HUGE and perfect on a nice night - shit, it has a FOUNTAIN.

2007-06-26,4.0,"If you like Lindy Hop - this is the place in Chicago to find it on Monday nights.  Enter the bar, go left and up the stairs.  The dancers are the best of the best of swing dancers (but pretty friendly to the n00bs doing six-count/east coast swing).  Music starts around 9:30 and goes till 1.  Sometimes, Lippy will spin vinyl...look for it to be really crowded when he does.  Really this is the best swing dance spot in chicagoland. Aside from that...I can't say I've ever ordered anything fancy at Fizz.  Or food for that matter.  Once I looked at their patio (which is how most people know the place).   The bartenders are pretty friendly and it does have a good overall Chi-town vibe but really...it's about the Monday night swing.",0.9428,0.85,0.15,0.0,0.4153846153846154
2007-06-19,4.0,"Great beergarden on the side of the restaurant. It's basically tables placed in between two buildings. But nonetheless, a nice big, open space. nice for a summer night. Went here on a Sunday night cause me and friends found a daily special for $1 mini burger, $10 bucket of ribs, $5 pitcher. The mini burger was there, but no ribs or the pitcher!  They do have a fun little thing called $2 mystery beer. You order it, and they bring out whatever bottled beer to you. We all got lucky and got ""unique"" beers - Amstel, Berry Weiss, and some Scottish ale.  But the second round was coors light.. so maybe that's how they do it? They seem to have good daily deals every night.  Place was pretty empty, which I actually enjoyed.",0.9783,0.759,0.208,0.033,0.5449874686716791

2007-05-12,3.0,"This place was better than expected.  I don't know what it is about this place, but to every person that I mentioned I was going here, they all said something derogatory or made a face about this place.  I kept waiting for some horrible service issue or rude people and it just didn't happen.  I had a fun time! I found the bartenders and servers to be friendly and efficient.  Of course, I was with a large party and they fixed the service issue with the ""old wristband"" approach where you pay once and drink and eat for the rest of the night.  I certainly made the most of my $32 investment! The music was great ( that just means I recognized the tunes)  No house music here- more like the best of the 70's, 80's and 90's (sounds like a radio station tag line) which was fine by me!  We even pushed the tables aside and had a makeshift dance floor which they were cool with.  Salsa anyone?? The food was okay- had a bunch of typical bar food and snacks- wasn't expecting haute cuisine so I left happy. We went there so that we could celebrate in their very large beer garden but in true Chicago style, while the weather the day before had been in the 80's- last night it was about 47 so needless to say, we stayed indoors!!! I will need to go back on a ""real night"" as the people in there were fun- but since we all knew each other and there were about 50 of us in total- I am not sure who the ""regulars"" are. For me- the next time I go it will be to enjoy a ""cold one"" on a hot day in that big beer garden.  I'll look for you there.",0.9926,0.749,0.185,0.066,0.4867913832199548

2007-02-14,4.0,"Updated review. I moved into the immediate vicinity of Fizz in March.  Lucky coincidence. Fizz is an awesome place to start out your night out.  First, the food is absolutely amazing.  The quesadillas are a sure bet - great tasting, and the spinach & red pepper were only $6!  The spinach artichoke dip is the best I've ever had, hands down, $8.  Their pizzas are reasonably priced as well. The drinks are decently-priced (not Pulaski, not Rush) and they have a good variety.  I like their beer selection, PBR being $3 ($2.50 on Fridays) on up to the more expensive micro brews, like Rouge Dead Guy for $5.   The best thing about Fizz is the outdoor area.  Regardless of whether you smoke or not, the beergarden is huge and nice.  They also have bags set up sometimes, along with a TV, couches and darts.   The people that work here and their friends seem pretty cool.  The average clientele of this bar on the weekends borders on the ""bro"" types, so I like to get in early and then head to Delilah's, the L&L, or somewhere similar.",0.9927,0.739,0.241,0.02,0.6106280193236716

I can tell you that the Tiki night on Wednesday used to be great (I think that Eric the bartender is gone now, so it might not be as good anymore), and some of the food items are great. I love their grilled cheese, and on Monday nights you can get a great deal with a burger and a Blue Moon.

2006-07-09,3.0,"The place is laid out kind of strangely to me.  It was weird that the beer garden was literally right next door as opposed to the back.  I went here for the first time yesterday, and it felt like the police patrol were guarding the beer garden.  I was going to walk right outside because I saw my friends, but the hostess and a couple other girls made me feel like I couldn't go out there since there was a party being hosted outside.  I think she was freaking out on the account that there might have been some sort of special or something going on with the party and didn't want me to sneak in.  My friend had to wave me in practically for them to realize that I was meeting up with friends that were not part of the party going on.  I had just a beer, but the waitress was sort of defensive or something.  The crowd was slightly annoying, high pitched girlie shrills (sorry kind of hurts my ears), slightly older crowd, and lots of couples.  It has 2 floors, and I hear that they use the upstairs to teach swing dancing or something like that.  I wouldn't mind taking dancing lessons there, but not my first choice in bars to go to.",0.9545,0.79,0.137,0.072,0.4726587301587302
