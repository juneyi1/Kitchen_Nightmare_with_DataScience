2016-09-07,1.0,This place is disgusting!!! I work for a delivery company and pick up food from there and one of the main and one of the main cook in the back touches everything with his hands. He will go touch raw chicken and then wipe his hands on his apron and go and touch other food. I have witnessed this at least 10 times and so have several other drivers. People have to be getting sick and not saying anything or they're covering it up. This restaurant is absolutely disgusting in the back and I'm shocked it was not shut down sooner.,-0.9228,0.876,0.0,0.124,0.4782824582824582
2016-09-06,3.0,"This large restaurant in the heart of the West Loop in Greek-town has everything one would except on its menu. We came here for dinner. We started with an assorted appetizer that included some marinated chicken, spanakopita and another piece of meat--no one was sure as to its name. The chicken was somewhat dry and the rest mediocre. We also ordered saganaki, the fried Kasseri cheese that is doused with alcohol and flambeed at the table with a shout of OPA! It was great and lemony. I ordered the mousska as my main dish. It came to the table somewhat cold (assume it is prepared ahead of time and placed in the refrigerator). It was not a very flavorful dish on many levels, but the lack of heat and a very busy waiter sort of sunk the dish. There were many regulars, so perhaps we ordered the wrong items but doubt we will return again.",-0.7901,0.899,0.035,0.066,0.6779138321995466

2016-08-19,1.0,"This was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had. It was so bad, that it was almost amusing to see how bad it would get--  FOOD POISONING BAD.  We purchased a groupon for this establishment.  We even made a reservation.  We were seated, waiter showed up, asked if we wanted any drinks, we said give us a min.  We explored the menu, 20 min passed. Our waiter returned and we asked if there are any limitations with the groupon.  The waiter said ""oh"" quickly took away our menus and ran away. 15 min passed.  We have no drinks, no waters, no menus, we have no idea what is going on.  We asked a bus boy to check on our waiter.  The bus boy, whose name I do not know, was nicer and more accommodating and brought us water and checked on our waiter.  In about 10 min or around 8pm, 40 min after we have arrived we got the ""groupon"" menus.  It was pretty predetermined as to what we were getting, but at that time we were all hungry and didn't care much.  Appetizers- #1 famous flaming cheese (saganaki), our waiter brought it to us, fired it up and opa or actually more like oh...greasy tasteless stuff. Considering the fact that all six of us were hungry, the cheese was eatable. But nobody wanted seconds.  Overall, that was the only appetizer out of 4 that we finished.  The next appetizer was spinakopita. Lets say nobody took more then one bite.  It was absolutely disgusting.  The premade microwaved stuff you get at the local supermarket would've tasted better then what we got.  The next two appetizers, were the fish spread next to the mashed potatoes with ""intense garlic""  were presented to us on the same plate garnished with a slice of a warm cucumber (health dept. take note)  and slices of pita.  Lets say 90% of that appetizer went to the trash.  It was simply tasteless and uneatable.  Then our waiter went missing for about 20-30 more min.  When he came back, we tried to order some drinks in anticipation of the continued feasting (and to make things more bearable).  The waiter perked up and brought us our drinks within a reasonable time.  Then he took our orders for soup and salad.  The soup I had was some barley beef version and the husband had the egglemon soup, which he did not finish.  The beef soup was pretty much your standard over salted progresso for $0.89 cents per can.    Then came the salad.  The salad consisted of some very old lettuce, covered with some dressing and feta crumbs and garnished with two huge pieces of tomato.  I have to admit I did eat the tomato slices because I was hungry and luckily they were not covered in dressing.   Then we sat there for about 20 more min... Our waters were refilled by the bus boy, who I think is the only person who acknowledged the fact that we were customers and were paying for this ""experience.""  Main course. Considering the appetizers, we were being careful.  4 of us ordered gyros (how can you screw up gyros), it seemed like the safe choice when we were making it.  The other two got the flaming shrimp and the combination plate (which was the better choice,as the it was the most eatable of all).  The waiter brought out the shrimp plate and lit it on fire, then the combination plate.  Then the 4 of us got a plate with 2 pitas a small plate of tzatziki sauce and three slices of tomatoes.  Then the waiter left. We were quite confused because we thought that gyros have meat.  We sat there for good five minutes before the waiter came back and brought the meat.   The meat....or the rubber ...old tires.....was dry, old, and did not resemble the usual taste and texture of gyros.  My husband took one look and said ""this is not gyros, gyros glisten""  This was a pile of rubber with a few onions that was a least two days old.   According to my friends testimony the shrimp was old and not yummy at all, she did eat a few but left much to be desired.  The shrimp came with a side of rice in a small dish covered in some brownish liquid.  ( It did look like carefully put together puke, Im sorry it was not appetizing at all).  Nobody touched that. The person who ate the shrimp got FOOD POISONING.  The desserts - baklava and sokoladina (chocolate cake) was a little less tasty then the stuff you get a jewel.  THEN, if you think this is over, its not.  Our bill was $102 dollars after groupon.  $30 was our drinks, $22 was the tax and the rest was a mandatory tip.  Our waiter filled in our receipts with a tip amount(!!!!!).  I have never experienced that before.  I understand that I cannot blame the waiter for the food...well, but MANDATORY TIP on such horrible dinner.  Maybe it was the groupon experience, Idk, but I will never return there.  Lets tally it up  Food, mostly uneatable, disgusting not restaurant quality. and resulted in at least one case of FOOD POISONING Service, poor at best, no communication skills, and a MANDATORY TIP  Price - RIPOFF  Also they have failed a number health inspections.  See photos.  AVOID.",-0.98,0.817,0.08,0.103,0.5025777777777776
2016-08-19,1.0,"This was, by far, one of the worst experiences I have had at a restaurant.  Admittedly, my view is from having a ""Groupon"" experience. Our party was seated, and the waiter showed up, asked if we wanted any drinks. We asked for a minute to review the menu. 20+ minutes passed and there was no sign of a waiter. When the waiter finally returned, we let him know that we have a Groupon. The waiter took our menus away and ran off. 15 minutes later -- we have no drinks, no water refilled, no menus, no food. We asked the busboy to help us find our waiter. Another 10 minutes passed and we received the Groupon menus. It was pretty predetermined as to what we were getting -- their ""variety"" was all but an actual choice. We were told there's four appetizers (and you have to get all 4, you can't double up on any of the items, and reject other ones). But at that time we were all hungry and didn't care much.  Drinks were ordered. And when the waiter poured the beers for the guys, he plopped them into the glasses with too much foam/head. The appetizers were saganaki (I've had better from a microwave), spanakopita (awful, disgusting, and way too juicy), some cold potato salad (which tasted like boxed mashed potatoes with garlic), and one other appetizer that smelled too fishy.  The waiter took the orders for soup. My husband and I ordered the egglemon - it was tolerable. Nothing to write home about. Then came the salad.  The salad consisted of greens which were doused in dressing, and old feta. The tomato pieces were the best tasting part of the entire dinner. Uncooked, plain as day, 2 pieces of tomato.  25 minutes later, with water at the table, and dirty dishes piling up, the main course arrived. In our group, 4 people ordered the gyros (to quote my husband, ""You can't mess up a gyros.""), I ordered the Shrimp Flambe, and another girl ordered the combo plate (this turned out to be the best option). The Shrimp Flambe tasted like overcooked shrimp, warmed up in the microwave and doused in oil. The rice smelled like old socks. The combo plate looked delicious, but that's also relative. The 4 that ordered gyros received a plate in front of them with 2 pitas, tzatziki sauce, and 3 pieces of tomato. Nothing else was said to them, then the waiter left. 7 minutes later, gyros meat was brought, and the waiter said, ""oh it's special just for you, it doesn't have fat."" The meat looked like something I wouldn't even feed my dog. The desserts - baklava and sokoladina (chocolate cake) was a little less tasty then the stuff you get at a local grocery store. The best part was when the bill arrived. There was a tax added, which is expected, and there was the cost of our drinks, again expected. But the waiter had the audacity to tell me how much to tip him -- he decided what his service was worth.  TL:DR, Don't go here if you expect any kind of nice service, or tasty food. The food: inedible, not restaurant quality Service: the busboy was the best part of the entire restaurant.  The price: definitely NOT worth it",0.9936,0.839,0.118,0.044,0.4228084415584416

Awesome! My aunt planned a family dinner for my cousin's birthday. We had a pretty large group and took up two long tables. The restaurant was busy, but not packed so I had no idea why the tables were so close together. I couldn't back up and get out of my seat without the person behind me getting up and pushing their chair in. Our table was also in a corner with a partition, so the two people there had a hard time getting up and out as well. Also, I felt like I was in a maze trying to get to the bathroom. The table set ups were terrible.  I had no choice in the menu, as my aunt planned it, but everything we had was okay. Not enough to make me want to come back, though.The olives in the Greek salad were extremely salty and inedible. Considering the failed health inspections, I hope those were really olives...... The food came out way too fast. It was family style so the large plates took up a lot of room. For every dish we started to pass around, two or three more came out. Someone told them to slow down a bit.  The biggest fail of this restaurant was the bar service. While we had wait staff bringing the  food, we had to get drinks ourselves. Imagine being squashed into a corner, having to go through a maze of tables and harried waitstaff with drinks. I dodged several waiters who just gave me dirty looks like I was an annoyance. Well maybe if they were you know, serving the drinks I wouldn't be in their way! I'm surpised I didn't drop anything. If I wanted to get my own drinks, I'd go to a bar and not a sit down restaurant.

2015-09-23,5.0,"'Opa!' Did you know that the now commonly-performed act of shouting this Grecian exclamation whilst setting fire to cheese originated here, at The Parthenon?  Yep, in 1968 a customer suggested to then-owner Chris Liakouras that he try something 'new and exciting', and exciting it would be.  So exciting, in fact, that he set lit his hair aflame while attempting it! [photo attached] Their saganaki (flambéed appetizer) was made with a Kasseri cheese, which was milder in flavor but retained its form well.  By contrast, a Kefalograviera or Kefalotyri have a sharper, saltier taste (which Eric S prefers) but are mushier almost to the point of being spreadable.  But The Parthenon serves the original, and there's no denying that.  It is an absolute MUST ORDER on your visit here. I got what amounted to a split bottle of their house red for a reasonable price of $9, and the wine selection was ample.  The food menu is jam-packed with traditional Greek entrees like spanikopita (flaky spinach & cheese pie), athenian chicken, roasted lamb, and the obligatory gyros.  My mom and I chose the 'dinner for 2' option for $22 per person, and all things considered it was a great value.  Included in it were: *Saganaki, taramosalata (whipped fish roe spread), gyros with tzatziki (cucumber sauce), a greek salad, moussaka (layered eggplant dish), pastitsio (basically greek lasagna), dolmades (stuffed grape leaves with lemon sauce), your choice of chicken/lamb/pork, rice pilaf and roasted potatoes, as well as baklava and galaktoboureko (vanilla custard) for dessert*.  Needless to say, we were completely stuffed and took a substantial amount home. Our server Rene was outstanding.  Good-natured, funny, and he even taught me some Greek words.  Truthfully he was one of the best waiters I've had in quite some time.  The interior decor is pretty minimal in comparison to other restaurants in Greektown, but that's fine since they shine on great food and stellar service.  Although I won't likely come back for a while (gotta give Pegasus, Athena, and Santorini a shot), I will return and will certainly recommend The Parthenon to family and friends.

When we arrived, our waiter took forever to take our order and we couldn't understand what he was saying.  The worst part was the food. Someone ordered the chicken skewers and every piece of meat was raw. So naturally we sent it back. The food returned with half of the pieces cooked and the other half still pinker than a breast cancer parade.  We insisted on talking to a manager. A large, elderly man came over and asked what the problem is. We responded with showing him the cooked pieces and the raw pieces. He was shocked and said ""this is the first complaint in 47 years"". Based on the yelp reviews, that's shocking to me. In addition, he said ""do you know what a marinade is"" and ""I don't understand why some pieces are cooked and why some aren't. They were put in the microwave for the same amount of time"".  For the record, yes I know what a marinade is but it's very insulting when an owner is talking down to a customer about their mistake! I think the bigger problems are that he didn't understand that some pieces are larger and take longer to cook and that a restaurant uses microwaves to cook their food.  I guarantee that this restaurant won't be around for another 47 years if they continue to serve raw meat, disrespect their customers, and cook everything out of a microwave.",-0.9537,0.867,0.031,0.102,0.48526206303984093

We arrived there at about 5:50 and waited 15 minutes in the car for a Valet guy to park our car, just to tell us the lot was full & to go down the block and pay 8 dollars to park. Ok? Called an Uber to pick us up & drive us the 3 and half blocks because it was about -5 degrees last night. We get inside at about 6:15pm,, and the Host greets us. She tells us to go find somewhere to sit because they have to find a table for us. 20 mins go by, and we get seated. We are literally CRAMED & so is everyone else. The tables are set up as if you were speed dating. We were so close to our neighbors I could hear more of their conversation then the one I was having with my boyfriend. Our waiter comes to the table and brings us our Menus. Mine was filled with oily butter on the back, it was literally slipping out of my hands. The waiter brought our drinks, bread, and butter. I dont know about you, but I feel like when you go to a restaurant, the bread should be fresh and warm. Ours was cold...AND still partially frozen on the inside. The couple next to us said the same thing. We let it go, hey its Valentines Day, its packed, givem a break right? About 30 mins later the waiter brings our appetizers. Spaganaki, and Fried Zucchini with Skordalia. It was our first time trying Spaganaki, so we didnt know what to expect. We didnt like it. It was VERY oily. I put it on my cold bread though & it tasted alot better!  I have to say, the zucchini was TO DIE FOR. Thats the only reason I am giving the restarant 1 1/2 stars. 25 mins later the waiter comes, and asks if were ready for our entree.

The cucumber sauce was well whipped and thick which gave you the feeling that you were fine dinging.  The next plate we obtained was the famous greek cheese and an ample OPA followed - cheese was perfect on the hot plate but slightly chewy for my liking. 2 soup options... the lemon rice soup and the beef stew... i recommend the beef stew due to the lustrous flavor of the tomato broth but for a lighter option the lemon soup will due. A greek salad followed which was nothing out of the ordinary however the olives were on point!. For my main entree I tried the braised lamb... BEST COOKED LAMB i've had in a long time... meat fell off the bone and was perfectly tender and I HIGHLY RECOMMEND.

We were seated when all of us were present and did not have to wait to be seated (i.e. they had set aside a table for us). When they brought us back to the table it was not completely ready. They had not put all the place settings down and had to bring more white paper to put over the table. Okay, not a big deal but we were seated 10-15 minutes after our reservation time so I would think they'd have it all set up. We waited a bit for the waiter but it was nothing out of the ordinary. We ordered a bunch of plates of saganaki for the table and it came fairly quickly and was very good. Then we told the waiter we were ready to order but he must not have heard us and walked away. Once he came back everyone ordered. We sat for a while waiting for our food. When it did come out it came out in spurts (i.e. 2-3 people's food came and then a few minutes later 2-3 more plates came). My boyfriend and I were one of the first people to receive our food. We had ordered a chicken dish which was supposed to have vegetables on the side and a vegetarian macaroni dish. The chicken dish came out with rice pilaf instead of vegetables and both dishes were lukewarm at best. Both dishes tasted awful due to the temperature and must have been sitting in ""the window"" without being kept heated while they waited for other food to be ready. When the waiter came (he did not bring any of the food) I caught his attention and told him both dishes were cold and asked if we could have them heated up. Instead of apologizing the waiter looked at us and said, ""really? Both dishes?"" Yes, we want both dishes taken back and heated up. I then repeated what I had said, that both dishes were cold and seemed to have been sitting around for a while. When I said this he rolled his eyes at me, said okay, and walked away...without taking our food. He went to the table behind us and spoke with them for a few minutes and then came back to take our plates. He brought them back (the same food we had had) with vegetables instead of rice for the chicken dish several minutes later. The food was the appropriate temperature this time. The vegetarian macaroni dish was okay. Nothing to write home about. The chicken dish which was stuffed with feta and spinach was also okay but again, nothing I would order again or go out of my way to have.  When the bill came we were charged full price for everything. I was not the person paying the bill so I could not complain but had I been paying I would have asked to speak with a manager. I did not deserve to have a server roll his eyes at me when I asked for my food to be re-heated. I'm sorry I know what food tastes like when it has been sitting around for a while after being cooked but I grew up and worked in the restaurant industry.

2014-11-23,4.0,"One of the first restaurants we came to when we first moved to Chicago as a family, then later I came here on my first dates out of the neighborhood I grew up in.  I like the touristy decor, the food is still good American-Greek with nothing fusion, pretentious, or nouvelle.  This is where they invented Greek-American, like saganaki (when we were in Athens as a family, dad ordered saganaki and the waiter derisively called us ""Americans.""), both the cuisine and the restaurant style.  This is a dependable place to eat before downtown shows, you'll pay less than you would at the trendier places, and they will get you in and out more predictably.  There are two bars (not sure why) and they would never upcharge you for ordering Ouzo or Greek Brandy wihout ice.      I lived for a while in Greektown way back when I was working my way though a couple of degrees at the University of Illinois Chicago Circle Campus (now UIC), and I asked myself many times, is the Parthenon really any better than the dozen other Greek-American restaurants around here?  Well no, but I've got a number of fond memories here, and it hasn't changed in a lifetime.  I find value in that.",0.9237,0.893,0.093,0.014,0.36440972222222223

We order lamb sweetbread for an appetizer and that wasn't what sweetbread was to us and it was so salty which kept drinking a lot of water. I order the Lamb chops for an entree with roast potatoes and rice pilaf as a side dish. My lamb was ok but the side dishes had no flavor at all. My husband order the roast loin of lamb and it was horrible. The gravy on the lamb from what we can tell came out of a can and the lamb wasn't even tasty or had any seasoning. The service wasn't good at all. Our waiter was busy talking to a lady at another table. He didn't even offer if we wanted desserts. I would not go back to this place ever. Afterwards we said we both said we should of gone to Popeyes because we can get more for our buck there.,-0.8767,0.93,0.009,0.061,0.425

2014-11-04,1.0,"This place is awful, on so many levels, don't waste your money, go some place else. My boyfriend and I went here with the Groupon deal back in October, I was incredibly disappointed with both the service and the food.  Also the Groupon is not much of a deal anyway, they have family style ordering on the menu for similar prices.  When we arrived we informed our waiter we were using a Groupon and he was polite about it.  He promptly brought the ""house wine""  which, no doubt was watered down and came from a box.  What can you do, we thought.  It tasted like church wine, maybe.  Next we ordered our cold appetizers and hot appetizers.  Our waiter then brought out the salads.  The salads were made with iceberg lettuce.    They were also drenched in olive oil.  The soup was next, it tasted like cream of chicken soup bought in bulk with lemon juice added.  It was basically disgusting.  The waiter acted insulted that I didn't eat it.  This was comical because it was not like the soup was homemade.   After the waiter brought our appetizers, I asked if we could order and he acted insulted that I was requesting to order.  I really did not understand.  I thought it was weird we had not ordered, or been offered to.  We ordered our entrees and after that we never saw the same waiter again.  Some how we insulted him to his core... not sure how.  The entrees were completely so-so.  I ordered the chicken kebab and to me it was inedible because it was drenched in oil.  Very disappointing.  It was also dry.  My guest ordered the combination plate and everything tasted old, not fresh and pre-made.  It tasted like it had been sitting out awhile too.  In the end we got our desserts to go.  We left a tip on the table and left.  We figured that be fine since our waiter had not been paying any attention to us for most of the meal.  But naturally, he noticed and chased us down, letting us know we need to pay ""4.50"" in tax.  This I found to be absurd.  Why are we paying tax on the cost of the Groupon when 1. the restaurant does not get the full groupon amount (groupon takes a cut) 2. I did not pay the full groupon amount (promo code).  It seems to me they were trying to squeeze a little extra cash out of every groupon.  I was appalled and found this practice to be unethical.   Overall, major disappoints in food and service.  I recommend never visiting this place even with coupon/deal/ etc.  We would be better off ordering less food and real wine at a better restaurant.  We would probably pay comparable prices to this ""Groupon deal"" after tax and tip.

Drink order was wrong, and the waiter insulted my daughter by picking a napkin up from the table and saying ""is this yours?"" Simply because she didn't have it on her lap yet. All of that aside, the salad I ordered tasted like it was dressed with cheap oil and water, completely tasteless and unappealing. Then the entrees came - only two - we waited another 10 minutes for my dish. The gyros was like sliced shoe leather, completely dry, served on a pile of plain raw onions. The tzatziki sauce (which is one of my favorites) was a tasteless lump on a plate that looked like cottage cheese - not resembling a sauce in any way. The calamari was fresh (the best I can say) but VERY greasy, and the sauce it was served with,  was a reasonably good herbed marinara, but cold, should have been served warm - it was not a cocktail  sauce. My husband said he liked his vegetarian Moussaka, as he tried to save the day! My daughter's pasta was enough for a family of 4, but was scantly dressed with a redish sauce that tasted like apple pie, very strong on the cinnamon, served with parmesan cheese?  Very strange! The place has seen better days, I'm sure.  After what was a very unenjoyable family lunch, I conclude, that this restaurant at best is for the tourist passing through, with no repeat business expected.  It is NOT for the discerning local who knows the difference and has many choices, or for anyone who knows good food.

I decided to take my date here on a Friday night at around 8:30pm. I was planning on dining at a different greek restaurant just a block away, but figured since we were already next to it, to give it a try. We walked in, and no hostess. I was a bit taken back cause the staff walked right by us and did not engage us with a smile, or hello, someone will be right with you.. nothing. 5 minutes past by and the hostess finally showed up. She sat us right away, but it seemed as if she was drained and unhappy. We look around the room and notice that we were surrounded by mature couples in their 50's, 60's, 70's.. There was absolutely no energy or laughter inside the room. The restaurant was beautifully decorated, but lacked energy and sign of life.  The waiter comes by, and takes our drink order. 2 minutes later, a second waiter comes by to take our drink order. We inform him that a different waiter took our order. He looked frazzled and confused, not to mention that he was sweating and had greasy hair. Not exactly someone that I would want as my waiter serving me my food. The first waiter was no prize winner either, but nothing we could do at that point. The staff looked underpaid, unhappy, and overworked. We ordered a glass of cabernet each. I want my wine in a wine glass and unfortunately they arrived in smaller glasses. I asked the waiter to bring us regular wine glasses, and it took him forever to find 2 wine glasses for us. We ordered the greek salad for 2 to start with and when it arrived it was a dry little sad plate for 1. Normally, I love dipping my bread into the sauce, but this time.. there was no sauce to dip in. I ordered the octopus with rice and potatoes, and my date ordered the chicken. The octopus was ok, but the rice and potatoes was a dissapointment. It's normally my favorite part of the meal.

2014-08-14,2.0,"First, let me begin by saying that my food experience was good. This is the only reason why this review is getting two stars.  I have been to the Parthenon before but usually with a company meeting or when I was younger, with family so I wasn't accustomed to dealing with the service. I had always noticed the kurt nature of the staff but attributed it to cultural differences.  On Sunday, I decided to take my girlfriend to the Parthenon. I saw the Groupon they placed and it was a great deal. On the Groupon it clearly states to mention you would be presenting it at the beginning of the meal and to tell your server. When our server arrived, he seemed pleasant enough - that was until we mentioned and showed him the Groupon I had pulled up on my iPhone. He became instantly frustrated, rattled off what we were ""allowed"" to get, then grabbed the phone from my hands (without asking) to mark it as redeemed, then walked away without taking our order. I thought I was maybe being a little sensitive but my girlfriend confirmed that he was outright rude - which only got worse.  As the night went on, he never checked on our table and we had to grab him to ask for refills, to take our menus, to take our order, and each time he was visibly annoyed. Then he pleasantly greeted the table next to us and I was about to get upset until they pulled out a printed Groupon. The server audibly huffed, snatched it from the woman's hand, and walked away. The woman at the table was surprised and gave a look to her partner. I asked the woman if the server was rude and she said, ""Absolutely!""  This happened to two more tables around us with Groupons. To the point where even the floor managers were rolling their eyes when the server walked past and whispered, ""Ugh, Groupon."" It was almost like the staff wanted us and the other Groupon users to feel ashamed or guilty for coming in. But that's not even the worst part.  After we were finished with our meal, (my girlfriend didn't even get what she ordered but felt scared to even mention anything to the server so she just ate what the food runner brought to her. Ps. If your staff is making your guests feel intimidated, you're doing something wrong) we waited a full 30 minutes for someone to come to our table. I had to grab our server as he was walking past our table and ask what the protocol was since we had paid and he said, ""You'll get a check."" Confused, since we had paid, we assumed it was a formality and the check would be so we could tip. He returns with the check, sets it in front of me, tells me I have to pay taxes on the meal (which was not stated in the Groupon fine print) and details how much everything cost - as if I was a child. Then bluntly states, verbatim, ""You HAVE to tip me on the total. NOT what you paid for the Groupon.""  I was a server for six years while I was in college and I would have been fired for saying something like that to a table.  I get it, you're annoyed that people bring in Groupons but to openly and flagrantly show your disgust and to make people feel guilty is childish, low, and unacceptable. If I hadn't previously been a server, I would have stiffed him but I felt bad and gave a reluctant 15%. As I we walked past the host stand, the manager just looked at us. I said, ""Thank you,"" and he didn't even smile or say a word.   I have been coming to the Parthenon since I was a child and this will be the last time I ever walk through those doors again. The obvious and outright disdain for not only us but those around us, seemingly supported by the management was unlike anything I have ever experienced. They lost my business and everyone that will hear this story forever.  Whatever you do, just don't tell them you have a Groupon.",-0.9908,0.818,0.066,0.115,0.5807291666666667
2014-08-06,3.0,"We had a Groupon for this restaurant and almosst didn't go because of the bad reviews we saw about how the Groupon customers were being treated. I'm glad that we decided to go and see for ourselves. This was an amazing deal from Groupon at the end of the day we got a bottle of House Wine, 1 cold appetizer(6.50 and under) 1 hot appetizer (7.50 and under), 2 Main Dishes(17.45 and under) and 2 Desserts anyone on the menu except the Brandy Ice. We ended up getting the flaming cheese after we saw so many people ordering it around the restaurant which not included in our Groupon deal since we had already ordered our Hot appetizer. Being this was our first time here we didn't know what to expect but our waiter was great and we even got one waiter in training which was okay with us but we weren't able to truly experience the flaming cheese dish (Flaming Saganaki) because he didn't pour all of the Brandy on the cheese so we got a puff of flames and not a burst of flames.  The flaming cheese was the highlight of the meal for me though...I love love loved it!! We also had Hummus which was okay but my girlfriend liked it a lot and I also appreciated the fact that they gave us extra pita for the mound of Hummus we had left. Meat Pies were okay and they were very fresh it just wasn't my cup of tea but again my girlfriend enjoyed it. There was a lot that came with this Groupon deal including a bottle house of wine which was not top shelf but it was good and did what it was suppose to do. The soup was a creamy chicken and white rice soup with a lemon essence to it which was good but not the best soup I have ever had. The house salad was made with fresh lettuce, cucumber, tomatoes, olives and peppers.  It had a piece of Feta Cheese and drenched in a house dressing.  Unfortunately, I didn't like the Feta Cheese, peppers and Olive but my girlfriend did so I just transferred it to her plate. I ordered the Rotisserie-Roasted Lamb topped with a lamb sauce it was good but I think it was slightly over-cooked but I could be wrong I'm not sure what the coloring is suppose to be on a Lamb.  I only had a bite of it while at the restaurant but I took it home and ate it for lunch and it still had a good flavor if not better. The Lamb came with a half order of Roasted Potatoes and Green Beans...I was not a fan of the potatoes I can't put my finger on it but I wasn't wowed...the green beans were good but kind of greasy...I would have preferred some fresh green beans that were not overcooked. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp and Spaghetti (Tourkolimano) the shrimp was cooked perfectly and I found myself wishing I had got a shrimp dish. For Dessert I got the Chocolate Mousse Cake (Sokolatina) it was so good I wish I had a piece right now.  My girlfriend got the Greek Yogurt with Honey and Walnut (Yiaourti) I tasted a little of it and it was very good.  I am still glad I got my cake but for a healthy opinion this is great. This wasn't the best place I have ever gone too but it also wasn't the worse.  The waiter and I wish I could remember his name made the experience a very good one for us and I even have to say there was an older gentlemen there who was celebrating his birthday and the entire restaurant sang along with his waiter and his dinner guest...It was fun and awesome to see people having fun.

2014-07-11,4.0,"After moving to Los Angeles where there are very few good Greek restaurants I really began to appreciate the wonderful and authentic Greek eateries on Halsted St. in Chicago's Greektown. And of these eateries, The Parthenon is one of the most established. I have been going there since I was a kid. And little has changed since. First and foremost, this is one of the best places to get really good inexpensive lamb, including chops off the rack. Also, leg of lamb, and frankly any lamb dish here will be good and not expensive for what you get. Now to the meal.  The Parthenon offers a large menu of traditional Greek fare, including specials that are especially authentic (like tripe soup which is delicious), plus combo plates, and family meals for sharing.  But whatever you get, I recommend starting the meal with a glass of Retsina (a white wine with resin, which gives it a slightly turpentine flavor that is unique and surprisingly satisfying when matched with the food), and the Saganaki (cheese doused in brandy and then set aflame with the waiter shouting ""Opa""). Once those two things are consumed, your personal meal choices can begin.  The Greek Salad is good here, but the AgvoLemano soup (creamed lemon soup with rice or orzo) is more interesting. And don't even bother getting the Greek Salad if you are not going to have it with the anchovies (only my opinion but in Greece they looked at American tourists like they were from the moon if they didn't eat the anchovies).  Another starter that I like is the Grilled Octopus (Greece is one of the few countries that favors octopus, along with Sicily, Spain, Mexico, Peru, and japan). Of course you can also get appitizers that have nothing to do with Greece even though we all think they do, like Hummus (chick pea paste with olive oil and tahini) or Baba Ganush (eggplant dip with garlic), which are both Lebanese dishes brought to Greece by the Ottoman Turks. Then of course there are fried Calimari Rings, which everybody likes, even kids (for them I think it's the Catsup, which adults are not allowed to use of course).  As far as main courses go I am always stumped, because I really want the starchy items like Mussaka and Pastiscio (both are like baked Lasagna, but the Mussaka  is meat sauce and eggplant with beschemal cream, while the Pastiscio is meat sauce and wide hollow noodles like macaroni).  But I also always want the meat to, like leg of lamb in a stew, or chops. There are about six types of lamb dishes at the Parthenon, all different cuts, and all different preparations, and the are all good. But whatever you do DON""T GET THE GYROS (unless it is on the combination plate). Of course it is as good here as at any Greek Gyros stand in town. But think about it, you can't get lamb chops or Mussaka at a Gyros stand, so why waste the opportunity. Whatever you get... make sure to order the vegetable side dish of green beans stewed in tomatoes and served over rice. When I was in Greece, everyone ate this with almost every meal. For the real starch lover, there is also a Greek Spaghetti, which is surprisingly different and good (a nice dish for fussy kids). The sauce is burnt butter and Greek cheese. There are so many good things to eat here that honestly, I usually order a combo, because I need to taste everything. After the meal it is nice to have a Turkish Coffee (they call it Greek Coffee because they don't like the Turks, who ruled over the Greeks for 400 years), and a nice piece of Baklava.  As a side note: the owners and the waiters and all Greeks are friendly and talkative. Be prepared to have at least one conversation with one of them. It is part of the meal.",0.9986,0.828,0.162,0.01,0.44230809263596166
2014-06-29,3.0,"After reading many of the excellent reviews on the Five course Groupon  with a bottle of ""house red"", we boldly went this afternoon at 5pm. No problem with the groupon, we saw a lot of them, we did make a reservation but we did not identify ourselves as having a groupon. We had already printed our menus off and picked out what we were interested in within the price ranges. No flexibility in ordering more expensive entres and paying the difference, we asked just to see what they said. I have liked the Greek Rose Roditis in the past but this tasted more like an even cheaper white merlot in an unmarked bottle (picture a LARGE box of Wisconsin White Merlot back there with a funnel).  We are going to go get some Roditis for a taste test and I will report. I don't think that house was the Greek Rose Roditis. But it was cold and wet and part of the $46 package, and of course we drank most of it.  Update. Had some Roditis at the Greek Village in Schaumburg, MUCH better, they are decanting that stuff at the Parthenon out of boxes into unmarked bottles. Went with Flaming Saganaki for old times sake, were warned off the homemade sausage by our able server Peter and went with the Eggplant/babaganoush, good enuf. Went with Peter's recommendations on our choices and had the rotisserie lamb and the broiled octopus. Both were good, the lamb portion was ENORMOUS, we took home 2/3 of it, tender and not overseasoned and my octopus was also very tender and flavorful, and I took half of that home. The lemon soup was ok, so was the Greek salad. We went with the teramisu and Vanilla pudding wrapped in philo with honey, we thought both were good. Our bill was about $5, half the tax which Peter had told us in advance, and we tipped $19, nobody suggested any amounts but we can do the math on the hypothetical bill, and liked Peter's recommendations. So our total was $46 plus $24, $70 with LARGE leftovers.  Service was slow and it's loud in there. I don't think we'll be back without another Groupon like that one.  We would probably rather find someplace to eat that has outdoor seating and better wine and just order a couple appetizers and split a main course, might be the same $46, but we thought the Groupon package was a DEAL and today we are FANS.",0.991,0.871,0.109,0.02,0.44047619047619035

Our entrees did not taste newly made. We had chicken and lamb: the chicken was hard and filling was salty, the lamb tasted old and was very greasy.  The server wasn't very helpful in explaining the food choices and we were rushed.  Once we got the check the amount was over $100 without the Groupon. Definitely not worth $100 for the type of food and service. The only reason why we give this place 2 stars was because they had complimentary parking, which is hard to find in the city. We will NOT be coming back here at all!

The waiter follows the same routine, and appears 10 minutes later with flaming cheese. He says ""Opa!"" and promptly leaves the table.  At this point I'm really confused...do I get to order anything today, or do I look so drunk off the boones farm the waiter has made the executive decision to order for me?   He did come back to take the entree orders (I ordered the Athenian Chicken, tasted decent, but chicken was dry).  At the end of the dinner, the waiter returns and tells me and my date that he will now bring out the dessert.  At this point we have mustered up the courage to ask if he will be selecting our dessert for us, or if we get to pick?  He says we get the custard since  apparently everything else in the restaurant is sold out. At the end of the meal he brings out the check, smiles and says this is my gratuity (a nice $20 tip).  This is the most I've heard him say all night, I'm even surprised he speaks English, but we don't argue since we're confused and sugar wasted on Boones Farm.",0.7039,0.859,0.081,0.059,0.4831018518518519

As everyone has mentioned, the Groupon deal is the deal of the century; you get an obscene amount of food and will end up taking home lunch or maybe even dinner for the next day from your leftovers. Positives: - Saganaki was hot like fiyah... literally and figuratively from a taste perspective.  It was much better than the saganaki I got from Melanthios up in Lakeview - Baba Ganoush (on menu as ""egg plant spread"") could have been the best I've ever had - Salad was fresh and I liked the Greek dressing - Soup was unique and creamy... and yummy (contrary to a post or two below) - Braised lamb entree was SO FREAKING GOOD. GET THIS. Neutrals: - Gyro entree was just so-so - Galaktoboureko dessert was bland. This was probably just a matter of personal taste, though. - Wine was some sort of rose which isn't my favorite.  But hey, it's alcohol and I got a whole bottle of it so there. Negatives - Our waiter looked rushed and wasn't the most personable.  Not going to hold it against him as they were really busy but maybe they should schedule another few staff members... - Service was slow.  People next to us ended up leaving without their dessert because they got sick of waiting. - Host seemed unorganized.  We had reservations for 8.  Called at 7:30 to say we would be about half an hour late.  Were told it would be no big deal and weren't even asked for our name to change the reservation.  Showed up at 8:30 and it was packed, ended up waiting 15-20 minutes.  So what was the point of the reservation again?

The restaurant itself is huge, many rooms with a large number of staff scurrying around the restaurant at all times. We were seated at a table in a back room near the kitchen. The overall appearance of the restaurant is dingy. Carpets are stained and bits of food all over. Quite unappetizing to eat in a room so filthy and hectic. We were seated and our waiter said something very quickly, which neither my boyfriend or I could understand. He seemed confused that we weren't ready to order after having just sat down, and he left without a word. He returned a few minutes later and we put our drink order in. He brought back my boyfriend's soda a few minutes afterward, but did not bring me the glass of wine I had ordered. We ordered the flaming cheese - which pretty much cannot be messed up. It was good; unfortunately that was the only thing we ate that was edible. My boyfriend ordered a lamb entree. I ordered a Greek chicken dish, and reminded the waiter I hadn't yet gotten my wine. We never did get refills on our water glasses.  Our food took quite a while to come out. When it finally did, my boyfriend's lamb was cold, and my chicken was very dry. The waiter had also not asked what our preference was for side dish (potatoes, veggie, rice), so my chicken came with potatoes (my last choice).

Next came the salad and soup which were both pretty meh. Soup could've been warmed from a can -it was lemon rice- while the salad was decent only for the feta blocks.  My girlfriend got the gyro and damn it was delicious. It was nothing like the stuff you get from a Coney- it was meaty and well seasoned.

I actually buy roditis wine from binnys (9.99) by the way. The wine they served tasted like a watererd down version. Very dissapointed compared to the past.

2014-04-02,4.0,"We visited using a Travelzoo Deal last weekend with another couple.  It was a good deal for a lot of food - 1 shared appetizer, Greek salad, lemon rice soup, entrée and dessert.  The problem was that the entrée choice was limited to those below $15.75 so if you wanted something more expensive you had to pay the full price for it not just the difference above $15.75.   Of course we chose Saganaki for the appetizer as The Parthenon invented it.  The salad was fine but they brought the soup too soon and it cooled off while I was still working on the salad but was good none the less.   I wanted to try something different for an entrée so ordered the kotopita (chicken and vegis in phyllo dough with a cream sauce) and it was very good.   I experimented again ordering custard in plyllo dough for dessert and didn't care for it.  I should have ordered the Tiramasu or chocolate mousse cake like others at the table.  Portions are large so we all had leftovers to take home.",0.8425,0.869,0.087,0.043,0.43898412698412703
2014-03-29,5.0,"This is my favorite spot in Greektown. I find the atmosphere and food preparation far superior to Greek Islands.  The Parthenon actually invented Saganaki. This is not a traditional Greek dish, but invented right here at The Parthenon in Chicago.  What you get here is a more traditional Greek experience than you will get at Greek Islands. The food tastes like has been prepared for you, instead of taken out of the food warmers like the Islands does it.  Service can be lacking at times, but the food generally makes up for it.  Reasonably priced. Greek salads are wonderful Moussaka is terrific. Housemade Gyros are fantastic. Lamb dishes shine-if you are lucky you will be there when the lamb comes off the spit and gets paraded around the restaurant in a celebration of love for the animal and it's sacrifice. Reasonably priced wines served in traditional little glasses like they would do in Greece. If you are unfamiliar with Greek wine, you will be pleasantly surprised. Try a bottle of Naoussa Boutari for under $30.00 and the whole table will be happy.",0.9948,0.753,0.247,0.0,0.5599647266313933
2014-03-29,1.0,"We came here for the first time with a groupon. Overall, I would say the food was really good. I enjoyed the flaming saganaki, eggplant spread, greek salad, and egg lemon soup. Actually, loved the egg lemon soup! However, we had an issue with one of the entrees. I ordered the chicken rigatani and loved it! Half a chicken in an oil, lemon oregano sauce with the braised potatoes. So good! My husband ordered the roast leg of lamb...because it was a greek restaurant and they supposedly specialise in lamb....big mistake. The roast leg of lamb was actually shaved lamb (looked just like gyro meat) doused in gravy...that's it...it tasted ok, but was not worth the price and looked like cafeteria food. Also, our groupon came with a bottle of house red wine....gross...stay away from this wine....I agree with other people who posted on here when they said it was watered down....it didn't taste very good, and I am almost convinced it had no alcohol content...normally if I drink half a bottle of wine I feel something....it felt like we drank a bottle of nasty tasting juice....and don't expect ""red""...it was more like a rose juice. My biggest complaint though was that the entire time we stepped foot in their restaurant there was a really loud and obnoxious man that continually shouted things and dropped F bombs while he watched a basketball game on a huge tv. Apparently, my husband and I were seated in the bar...because I was first confused why a fancy restaurant would have giant tvs in the dining room... So much for a romantic date night....My husband and I saw the man and his table take several rounds of shots....so I can only imagine he was severely intoxicated. He repeatedly shouted ""chang chang chang"". He was very disruptive and obscene...however, no one from this establishment ever spoke with him or told him to quiet down...the entire time we ate, this man was shouting and swearing. No one apologized to us either for him ruining our dining experience. Also, this man was not a young kid...he was a grown middle aged man acting foolish....why did no one at this restaurant tell him to quiet down or cut him off??

And so are meat and cheese pies that are wrapped in phylo.  My dining companion ordered a T-bone steak as they were out of the NY strips. (As indicated by the waiter). Great, ordered the T-bone. When it arrived the steak was NOT well-done as he had indicated it to be cooked. It was hot pink on the inside a clear indication of a medium-well.  You are probably thinking that is not a big deal and it isn't but unfortunately the steak smelled as if it had been marinated in garbage, shit and blood. The steak was rotten. Completely and disgustingly rotten. The kitchen had literally taken an old steak and cooked it. The manager came over and said, 'We don't specialize in steaks, we specialize in lamb but this steak is overripe.' Who the hell cares? And what the hell is 'overripe'? You had steak on the menu. Why not say that you are out of steak, like the waiter originally did with the NY strip? I had the braised lamb. It was not much more than a fatty chunk of meat that was covered in an unflavorful red sauce that was more grease than red. The rice pilaf was also swimming in this sauce. Disgusting. For $25 an entree, I am sorry but I expect more. Totally and completely unacceptable. And the last thing the manager said to my companion was that 'They didn't do it on purpose.' What didn't you do on purpose? Serve a disgusting rotten steak to someone you thought wouldn't know the difference? Shame on you. Never again. Never again.

Normally I reserve mentions of this phrase for jovial but fond reminisces around the family dinner table, but it TOTALLY fits in relation to my experience at the Parthenon. We (co-workers and I) had a group dinner here, and the food just kept on coming. It felt like we ate everything on the menu, but that'd be exaggerating. Barely.  Service is ""family style"" in every sense of the word. You share the food. And the service was like ""family,"" too -- you're a guest in the restaurant. (Except you'll get a bill at the end.) In came plates of the saganaki. We got the show... alcohol poured over pans of cheese, then lit on fire with a woosh. It was especially good with the crusty bread that came to the table. The bread also went well with the tzatziki and the fish spread. The gyro meat was flavorful. I snagged a couple crispy pieces and was quite happy. Thoroughly enjoyed the lamb. Lamb is tough to get right (pun intended), but they do a very good job here. Chicken was tasty, but was especially good with a bit of the sauce drizzled on top of it. The Greek salad was really tasty. Lightly dressed but full of oregano. I could eat a whole platter of that for dinner and be happy. Yum to the pilaf and the potatoes as well.  They also brought out plates of pastitsio and dolmades, which I did not try... but both looked good and were popular. Along with dinner, we had bottles of red and white wine (the Tsantali Rouge and Blanc). Both Greek. Both good. Don't hesitate to try them. And of course, they go well with the food. I can't eat baklava, so I couldn't try the dessert, but it looked tasty and well made, and others seemed happy with it. The ""American"" coffee was enjoyable.

2014-01-13,1.0,"My first visit to this place in sixteen years since I was in college and my parents thought this was haute. This visit was for someone's preference in our party, and we were a party of six. Same loud environment. Terrible garish, sophmoric mural style paintings on every damn wall. Loved the family and b-list celeb photos. Hated the self indulgent magazine and newspaper food reviews mounted and modpoged. Ok. so just a so so interior. Then came the torture chairs. They were wooden and covered with vinyl. Half way through dinner service, my ass was killing me.  Service was not horrible at first...but I knew things took a turn when everyone's food came out but me and one other in my party. We both had gyros. This confused me because gyros are pre-cooked and waiting on a spit. Not a huge deal, but nine minutes of people awkwardly waiting for me to get food coulda been avoided. No, come to think of it, bullshit. This is inexcusable. A party of seven can get their food at the same damn time at a McDonalds...  Later, on my way back from the restroom, which I had to get to  by walking through a bar..., I slowed my walk so as to not bump into a lady and a waiter carrying three empty pitchers slammed into my back from behind me and almost knocked me off my feet. He screamed, ""Oooooh!"" and didn't look at me, didn't stop or slow down and certainly didn't apologize for ramming pitchers into my back. Now this was just inexcusable. No apology, I should have left there in an ambulance. IF THAT WASN'T ENOUGH...NOW THE FOOD... Four servings of their signature, flaming cheese was ok. Spanokopita was too wet with too much spinach. Feta and olive plate was the best with lots of oil to sop up with plentiful and yummy sesame bread. Entres were brought and the waiter had the poor sense to argue with our guest of honor about his side of veggies vs what he ordered, which was rice....instead of simply apologizing and getting him rice! he actually raised his voice and said, ""no no you have the vegetables"". I sat across from him. he ordered something unusual and I listed to him carefully. He specifically said ""rice pilaf"". No big deal, right? just bring a little side plate of rice...but nooooo......we have to argue about the fucking rice with the guest that I am trying to impress. Just fucking great. Our check was $240.00!!! What would have a side. I could not believe it. I was extremely embarrassed.  Greek Chicken was ok, but undercooked and too oily....and several of our party mentioned that the dish was better at Omega or Olympic star (kinda dive greek places in the burbs). Gyros were paper thin slices and cooked into meat potato chips. If this is good in your eyes, so be it. Not for me. Weirdly, they brought one plate of pita and one large plate of tzatziki sauce...so the other dude that ordered gyros was all the way at the end of the table from me. So an awkward passing of these condiments back and forth ensued. Food taste was ok. When we finally got our food. Then the service took another bad turn. A party of 16 was seated next to us and we became invisible to our elderly waiter. Dessert was totally screwed up. We got an extra of the ""carmel cream"" which turned out to be store bought flan....and then we waited twenty minutes for the plain single scoop of ice cream and another 20 for the check which we thought was correct. After the fact we found out that the other gyro guy and I actually got brought the small portion of gyro, which should have been 8.95. Instead we were charged for the large portion for $12.95. This should be a world class restaurant. Certainly the prices are pretty high. I would expect decent food and better service. I would have rather gone to Nero's Gyros.

2013-07-21,4.0,"I'll be honest...Greek Islands has always been my family's go-to restaurant in Greektown. However, when my mom and I started looking for a large room to host a get-together for my family after my wedding abroad, The Parthenon had far and away the best options as far as private room and event menus went, so we decided to give  a new place a try.  Starting with the free valet service that they offer, everything at The Parthenon was great. The room we had was large and colorful, has a dance floor and stage, a private bar, and a projector and an audio hookup so you can play movies or slideshows and play your own music. The waiters and bartender were all very nice and helpful and our food came out at the perfect pace so we didn't feel rushed. We had Saganaki (flaming cheese), Greek Salad, Taramasalata (fish roe dip), Gyros with tzatziki dip, Avgolemono (egg lemon) soup, Moussaka (beef and eggplant casserole), Dolmades (beef and rice wrapped in grape leaves), Pastichio (a greek lasagna with noodles and beef topped in a bechamel sauce), Lamb, Chicken, Rice, Potatoes, Baklava, and Galaktoboureko (custard pie). Yes, it was a serious feast! Everything was delicious and everyone was totally overwhelmed by the crazy amount of food.  After dinner we danced the night away until they told us it was time to go. The only downfall was that the room was incredibly hot, even with the A/C turned up all the way. We were definitely sweating when the dancing began. Despite that little hiccup, it was the perfect evening and my family had such an amazing time, much to the credit of the great food and service we received at The Parthenon.",0.9936,0.824,0.164,0.012,0.6412372573662894

Big portions, big families, large amounts of flowing booze, an ""OOPA!"" every couple minutes, lots of loud laughter and conversations...you get the point. So, if you're looking for a quaint little spot to have a nice, quiet, romantic dinner, then the Parthenon is not for you.  My experience was rather lackluster. However, I blame that primarily on our server. ((He brought on big attitude...imagine that...)). Why is it that when you whip out a Groupon or coupon of some sorts, servers immediately tune out? Not to mention I received a good amount of attitude and up charges when asking for accommodations due to food allergies and intolerances.  The food itself was a mixed bag. Some things were amazing and others left me wishing I was elsewhere. My biggest complaint is the abundance of olive oil used in everything. Even olive oil can make a dish fatty and greasy... Let's review what made the cut, and what didn't... The good:  - Navy bean soup. Amazing. - Flaming Saganaki - Cheezy, boozey, and delicious. - Mini Spanakopita pies - Pastitsio - Meaty, cheesey, creamy pasta. Yum. - Chicken Breast Shishkebob  - Baklava The forgettables: - The hummus ((I'm still convinced we were brought the eggplant spread)) - Dolmades - Way tooooooo much meat, not enough rice. ((Unless that's your thing)) - Gyros - Dry and flavorless... - Greek Salad - Death by salad dressing.  Overall the Parthenon left me with that ""meh"" feeling. Would I go back? Sure, I'd definitely give it another go around. Perhaps a server with a little less 'tude and more flexibility would turn a low 3-star review into a solid 4.",0.9897,0.764,0.175,0.061,0.40769632414369256
2013-05-31,4.0,"I sooooo want to give Parthenon 5 stars, but it was just shy of a perfect score due to a few minor issues here and there.  Overall it was fabulous and I would definitely come back.  Like the rest of the bazillion diners last night, we had a Travelzoo voucher for a 5- course dinner for two people.  I did not notice any less service or attention due to the voucher, but the restaurant was just very crowded, so service was slow.  Also, the room that we were in echoed, so when we were sat next to a party of 8, it got fairly loud.  Anyway, onto the food... First we shared an appetizer and we chose the Saganaki.  Who doesn't love flaming cheese???  It was flavorful, fun presentation, and just downright delcious.  'Nough said. Second came the Egglemon soup.  It was delicious.  For those people that are gluten-free, the menu indicates that this item is one of them.  Score!  The only thing I would have tweaked was maybe add a tiny bit more lemon, but this one was tasty and appealed to the masses. Third came the Greek salad.  Again, so yummy.  Normally I am not a fan of Greek salad because they are always underseasoned and too greasy or too vinegary.  This one was the right combination of everything put together. Fourth were the main entrees.  This is where they fell short.  We ordered 2 different entrees: Special Traditional Combination - I loved half of it and really hated the other half.  Here are the components broken down piece by piece: Dolmades - Great.  Flavorful, perfectly balanced.  Moussaka - Too much bechamel.  It tasted like flour and nothing but flour. Pastitsio - Again, too much bechamel.  Tasted like flour and I could not taste anything else. Roast Lamb - AMAZING.  Perfectly done.  Not gamey.  Not chewy.  Just great flavor and texture. Poatoes - Great.  A tiny bit tangy, and tiny bit roasted, perfectly fork tender.  Just really nicely done. Vegetables of Peas - Good, nothing to write home about, but fine. Chicken Breast Spanaki - This is the broiled skinless breast of chicken stuffed with spinach and feta cheese.  Poorly executed.  The chicken was extremely overcooked and dry.  Overuse of the feta on dry chicken is not a good combination.  It basically tasted like a salty piece of cardboard.  We also ordered braised potatoes to go with it, but they brought out the rice pilafi.  It took awhile for the entrees to come out, so we didn't send it back.  Rice was good, but we would have preferred the potatoes. Fifth came dessert.  We ordered the crema caramel which is like a flan.  FABULOUS.  It was light, tasty, and perfect way to wash away the disappointing entrees.  We also got ice cream which is standard.  No complaints. Beverages - be careful as some are non-refillable.  We got dinged twice for the 2 apple juices for my son.  I ordered the Greek iced coffee and it was yummy, but it was kinda tiny and no free refills. So as you can see, there are many great elements to our meal, but they need to work on the entrees and figuring that part out.  We'd come back, but we'd probably not order entrees again unless we were very specific about instructions on how to cook or prepare the items.  Everything else, they've got it covered.",0.9989,0.73,0.212,0.058,0.5127108134920636

For our appetizer, we got the spanakopita.  The filling was really good, but there definitely wasn't enough phyllo on the outside, because it was lacking flakiness. It also seemed like it had been sitting under a warmer for a couple hours, which probably contributed to the sub-par exterior.   The Greek salad was standard, but good.  They were out of the avoglemono soup (sad face), so we were given a navy bean soup in its place, which was actually really good.  At this point, I was already getting full, so had to laugh when I was presented my ginormous entree, the special combination (dolmades, pastisio, moussaka, lamb, peas and potatoes).  I did manage a couple bites of everything.  Dolmades are one of my favorite Greek foods, but these were not great.  The filling was mostly beef and would have benefited from more rice; it had been packed in very tightly, so it was like taking a bite of a dense hamburger patty.  Normally I am not the biggest fan of lamb or pastisio, but I thought both were pretty good.  As for the moussaka, it was good, but not nearly as good as the one over at Greek Islands, which is heavenly.  The boyfriend had the gyros, which he seemed to enjoy.   We got our desserts to go, both ordering the baklava.  I got a second wind at home and tried mine.  Not bad, but definitely not the best ever.  If you are hoping to get dessert in Greektown, definitely walk over to Artopolis, which has absolutely amazing  baklava and other desserts.

My stewed lamb was fork tender and richly flavored, but it seemed kind of greasy too. Desserts were letdowns...tiramisu flavors didn't really marry, and the galaktoboureko was surprisingly hard. But they win points for not making the desserts cloyingly sweet. Service was excellent if a bit slow, but it was a busy night. My biggest problem with them was the valet. Right in front of my eyes, he made a huge U-turn on Halsted st even though there were cars coming at him (my car!), slammed on the brakes and ended up grazing one of the traffic cones in front of the restaurant.

For me, it is the simple things about Greek food that I love so much, and The Parthenon does a good job of sticking with traditions (some all their own) to maintain that timeless Greek-Chicago feel. I had a difficult time deciding what to order, so luckily for around $15 there is a massive amount of food on offer through their Special Traditional Combination dinner plate.  Just about everything I was craving is offered on the plate (almost- some grilled octopus would have been a most welcome dessert). Special Traditional Combination (both traditional and special): - Dolmades (always a tasty combination of meat, rice and grape leaves- served with a tangy, lemon sauce) - Moussaka (kind of like pasta-less lasagna- eggplant and meat sauce cut from a dish that includes bechamel) - Pastitsio (another lasagna-like dish, but this time with pasta- stringy pasta, not sheets or layers of pasta) - Roast Lamb (really delicious here!) - Potatoes (another simple delight that if I knew ahead of time- I would have just ordered this along with the skordalia...  braised to perfection- outstanding!) - Vegetable (green peas and carrots, not sure if that changes or if that is standard with this dish) Everything was delicious, but as I said before, the simple things really stood out.  Roast lamb slices, braised potatoes and the delectable smear of garlic and potato known as skordalia have me dreaming of an entire meal of that next time around.

Every January we go out to celebrate my  brother.in .law's birthday.... about 12 of us came out to celebrate amongst the frozen tundra (usually there would be more of us... but the flu took them out) to celebrate ""Grecian-style"". On this specific night the place was very busy... after a beverage or two at the bar we made our way to this cozy little back room (it was just our large party and another party, about the same size). Our friend Jimmy took the helm and talked to the waiter that was assigned to our table....  The food and wine then started coming out in waves.... We started of course with their house ""the pink kind"" wine; this stuff is so smooth it's dangerous! (All night we never had an empty bottle)  Food-wise.... You can never go wrong... The ""waves"" started with your Saginaki... which was flamed up tableside, with all that came out (about six orders) it could've started a five alarm fire! That was eaten very quickly, since we ALL love it... scraping the leftover molten cheese off of the hot metal plate... spread it on some of their bread... HEAVEN! More wine... Gyros and pita came out next... And don't forget the Tzazhiki! They make it all in house. All in house... the meat itself was a little bit drier than I was used to, but that's not a bad thing. They use a blend of meats... and they don't use any preservatives or fillers... and the flavor was so there, spot on!  Even more wine... Octopus, my favorite came out... Has to be the best octopus in town... perfectly brined and grilled... always the best! This was followed by a traditional Greek salad. The wine just kept coming.... Now came the Lamb Chops, Greek Chicken, rice... green beans.... and potatoes... this part was more a tidal wave; surfs up? Don't stop a pouring.... The Lamb Chops, always grilled to perfection... the Greek Chicken, always so juicy... the rice, always love the rice; always so good (I went for 3rds!)... the green beans, a group favorite... and the potatoes, who doesn't like potatoes? And then came dessert.... all the Greek classics were offered.... and coffee too... We ended our evening back in the bar, and end all be all closed the place down. Is that a bad thing?!

But what's terrible is that when the waiter asked us if we wanted boxes, I asked him if the dish was meant to be served cold. He told me that no, it wasn't. He brought back our check and tried to play it on me, like it was my fault or that I was trying to scam him out of a cold $14 pasta dish. ""You should've said something.""  Apparently he did check in with one member of our party on the end, but he NEVER checked with me. And he should have because I needed another drink as well! We all had empty glasses. What decent restaurant lets that happen? Shoddy service and the server (short, pudgy, shaved head) should be moved to the bar/carry out orders only.

I had some coffee and ordered some appetizers to make a meal.  I got the Greek salad, chickpea soup, and taramosalata (pink fish roe dip).  The dip was good like last time, though not as strongly flavored as I recall, but I went to town on that stuff with the sesame seed bread from the basket on the table.  The chickpea soup was just silly.  It was literally broth and chickpeas.  Not a thing else.  Homemade broth, I think, but still.  There were just like, 50 chickpeas sitting in it.  What?  I expected other veggies, a partial puree, ANYTHING but chickpeas floating in broth.  If i want that for lunch, I will pour some broth into a bowl and open a can of chickpeas into it.  I'm not saying it tasted bad, but it was totally ridiculous.  Greek salad was okay - too much lettuce, not enough other goodies, but the olives and big hunk of salty gorgeous feta definitely elevated it. Bummer is that my friend who came a little late ordered a chicken salad - we all heard her - and they brought an Aegean salad out instead.  Easy mistake, she corrected him, he took it away.  And he didn't bring back the chicken salad for AGES.  The Greek empire could've risen and fallen in the time it took him to bring the right salad.  I seriously hate this at restaurants - if there's a problem with the food, take it away and bring back a replacement ASAP.  No excuses, especially when you're not busy!  That needs to take priority over whatever else the kitchen is doing.  By the time they brought it out, she had to wolf it down so we could make our 3 pm appointment in the neighborhood.  She ordered the salad around 2 pm.  The whole thing took that long.  Silly. I had nibbles of the spanakopitakia and it was rich and creamy inside, and my friend really liked her chicken salad.   I think I need to order food-food here next time, not appetizers, to judge more thoroughly.  That soup was seriously just goofy.  I think the food here is generally good, but the service could stand to be improved for sure!",0.9681,0.766,0.142,0.092,0.5293002915451894

Perhaps they have a loyal following?  It is a family type establishment-- nothing wrong with that, but be prepared for lots of kids running loose, cheap and boring dishes lacking subtle flavor, with an emphasis on portion rather than taste.  Like a greek Denny's (or other family style chain). This place was awful on so many levels- obvious that they are cheaping out on quality.  They are making shortcuts on ingredients and wine quality and it shows. The waiter was very nice, but not helpful, and incredibly inattentive.  When I asked about the different wines he always said ""it's nice "". Well, he was wrong.  The two reds we tried were of poor quality.  we had to send the first one back because it had changed into vinegar. i am not a wine snob and for me to send back anything it would have to be completely unacceptable. We started with the lemon rice soup.  Ugh.  I am certain that the broth was from a can.  It tasted like Campbell's chicken soup with rice.  You would think the management would notice that no one finished it.. I had the spinach pie.  I asked the waiter for spanikopita and that's what he suggested.  I was soooooo disappointed.  It was almost indelible it was so salty.  Yes, I know, feta can be salty.  However, they should have balanced the feta with the spinach in proper proportion.  The phyllo was good but only on the top layer.  I guess this is easier to make than real spanikopita.  Too bad they don't make it! The roast chicken was way too dry. But if u like dry chicken order it because the portion is huge. The roast lamb was tough and way over cooked.  I don't recommend it. One in the party ordered steak. Personally, I think it is kinda silly to order steak in a Greek restaurant, but anyhow... it was a meager cut, thin, over-priced and unseasoned.   Although we told the waiter at the start that we need two checks and he thanked us for telling him in advance, he forgot at the end and we had to wait a long time for him to fix this problem.  When he finally did bring up the final checks he hadn't bothered to actually seperate the items , so we had no idea who was paying for what. Our table was next to the dish station in the back.  The bus boys smashed and crashed so many dishes it was impossible to talk.  I even heard a few breaking.  It is my feeling that these guys must hate jobs and are trying to get fired.!

He was pleasant and talkative with his other customers, as well as attentive to their table. We ordered a humus appetizer and got baba ghanouj instead. I don't like baba ghanouj, and instead of addressing the issue, he just said, ""Well, that's humus,"" so we asked him to take it away. I've been eating at Mediterranean restaurants for over 20 years, so I know what humus is. He avoided even looking in our direction when possible, and we had to flag him down to get more water. The best part had to be when we caught him making faces as he walked away from the table. Apparently, the sight of two men eating at the same table is a revolting experience. This was a disaster - we were polite, quiet (as one should be in a restaurant), and aside from me being a little indecisive about what I wanted for dinner, we were hardly the picture of difficult guests.

Right at the door is the host who will seat you. They are dressed distinctly. What captured me was the roasting lamb at the window. (not to mention the huge craving for meat). I came in with my friend and we had some awesome lamb spaghetti and the hot appetizer.  Sorry, I forgot the names. The appetizer platter for one has one of each sample and kebabs. I was pretty amazed how the meat were so tender. The same goes for the lamb. It was juicy and had the taste I was craving for.  The place had soft music that fits the mood. Lighting was not bad either. It was in between romantic and well lit. The decor got me amazed as well. I thought I was sitting outdoors for a minute. They had what I would call ""clothkins"" that were neatly folded on the plate.  One thing was the servers weren't as attentive. We told them we were in a hurry, and it seemingly took quite some time for us to depart. I still had a good experience here. The serve tried to recommend some food for us as well. They were really helpful.  I guess the price is reasonable, but I wish they were negotiable. The lamb leg spaghetti price threw me off...

We prob saved like $10 overall and were unimpressed about nearly everything. My fiancé wanted to surprise me with it and take me to an ""authentic"" Greek restaurant; I almost broke up with her for choosing this place; just kidding.  We thought we had a choice for the appetizer, soup, and salad but our waiter brought us some fried cheese appetizer, which was awful, some thrown together salad, OK at best, and lemon-egg soup which was nearly inedible. Following these courses we had the octopus and lambs leg for dinner. Wow, were these terrible. The octopus was swimming in oil so I had to douse in lemon to offset the oil taste. The lamb was very overcooked and was covered in some brown sauce, which seemed to be the kind that came from a can at Dominicks - needless to say, this was not appetizing at all. For dessert we had ice cream and chocolate cake, this was the best part of the meal and would recommend to only come here for this if your tried the restaurant. One other plus for the restaurant was the Greek wine, elios; would recommend this and lots of it to make the food taste better. Also, the waiters seemed to treat us differently compared to other tables. They only came by after the meal was nearly done but were very attentive once they dropped the check and waited to get a tip. The plates we had seemed to be presented very different from other tables - ours seemed to have been sloppily thrown together and were half the size of other plates being carried around the restaurant.

2011-12-18,5.0,"As I stated in my Mr. Greek Gyro review, I am Greek. Very much so! So when I stayed in Greektown during my first visit to Chicago, I stayed in the Parthenon Hostel which also has a restaurant right next to it! When I checked in I discussed with the person who was working there about a good Greek restaurant to eat at for dinner and she told me that the Parthenon next door is good AND I get a discount for staying at the Hostel! This was perfect for a 21 year old with a budget! So, I went and had the best food experience that I had in Chicago. I've been to Greek restaurants, I've eaten Greek food. We have a nice Mediterranean restaurant here in Upstate NY called Aladdin's, but this place is what I have been looking for. When you first walk in the decor, the people, everything says traditional Greek and as I walked in I got excited because I knew that I was in for a good experience.  We sat down and checked out the menu and I was excited to read all of these delicious foods that my YiaYia and her friends would make homemade on different occasions. Spanakopita, Gyro, Saganaki, Moussaka - so many choices. My fiancee ordered the Spanakopita and I ordered the Moussaka for our entrees and we ordered Saganaki for an appetizer. If you didn't know Saganaki is a traditional cheese dish that when the waiter brings it out for you they actually start it on fire, yelling 'Opa'! According to Wikipedia, this actually started here at this restaurant. I don't know if that's true or not, but it's pretty cool nonetheless.  The entrees were delicious. The Moussaka was perfect and just like my YiaYia and her friends make! The Béchamel sauce was delicious, as was the meat and eggplant. I am unsure about whether the meat was traditional lamb or beef, but it didn't matter to me because I actually have never (knowingly) ate it with lamb and it was delicious anyway! I have yet to find a Spanakopita that I can successfully compare to my YiaYia's, but this is as close as it comes! My YiaYia's is less spinach and more cheese, when most Spanakopita that I find is the opposite. In conclusion, this is definitely my favorite place that I have eaten at in Chicago thus far and I'd be interested in finding more Greek restaurants that I can compare to this!

We didn't even get any water... nor did anyone come by us AT ALL for literally like 10 mins... we just sat there looking for someone to come to our table...

It took about 30 minutes after we've ordered our entree. It was a combination plate of different things. When it FINALLY came out... the food was cold and nothing tasted right. What I didn't understand is that by the time that we had ordered our entree the restaurant was quieting down. Our dish consisted of items that were not freshly prepared... meaning these items were made ahead in big batches... so if all they had to do was scoop small portions onto the plate ... since they were ALL pre-made... then why did it take 30mins and why was it COLD????? There was no way that we were going to eat that food.  I called our server and told him that our food was cold and it just didn't taste good.

2011-11-26,4.0,"I first ate at The Parthenon in February of 1972, and have since logged several hundred visits with my wife, my kids, my grandchildren, my extended family--some of whom are no longer with us--and my friends, students, and colleagues. No doubt there have been, and perhaps are, other Greek restaurants that offer a better, or more authentic, Greek meal. We've tried some over the years, but are content to come back to a predictable and satisfying experience at The Parthenon.  Start with the food. They make their own gyros here, and it's crisper and browner than in most places around Chicago. They started serving it before the gyros-on-pita trend had arrived, so it comes on a bed of strong white onions and stiff, garlicky tzatziki sauce. Today you can get grilled pita with it, but that was not a standard item originally. I prefer gyros at The Parthenon to other gyros in Chicago, but I can see why some find it dry. About twenty years ago, the food took a turn to the greasy side. I don't know whether the initiative came from Chef Soto or the Liakouras family, but they responded  with less grease and some half-portions, just as we started not being able to pack it away like we did when we were in our twenties.  I recommend the cheese pies (tiropitakia), smooth cheese with ethereal crust. Eggplant salad, melitzanosalata, is a garlicky wonder. The Parthenon does great things with octopus-- either the broiled or slow-cooked braised (octopodi yachni) are excellent. As a general rule, avoid the combination plate, not because  the ingredients aren't good, but because they have a tendency to mass-produce it. My wife really enjoyed the vegetarian combination the other day, and my Indian friend loved their vegetarian items when we ate there last year.  I have been eating the codfish skordalia for a long time, and it is terrific. I went through a lamb-with-artichokes phase, and it is delicious, but I can't eat like that any more. The barbecue lamb and the leg of lamb are fine, but remember that they tend to be well-done.  We have fed two generations of little kids the fine Greek bread, and their rice pudding and galactoboureko are great desserts, though these days we confine ourselves to a glass of mavrodaphne, the Greek port.          I close my review with a tribute to the people at The Parthenon. Many of the waiters have been there for decades, and we have watched some callow youths become gray-haired elders. Our favorite waiter is Adalberto, who works the slightly elevated room directly behind the ""original"" main room. His ""waiter number"" on the bill is #1: enough said. But the others are fine; they tend to do a variation on the gruff-but-professional Greek waiter, and do things like take the orders from large parties by memory. I remember a family dinner with my late father-in-law many years ago, when the waiter came out with plates of food and announced ""Okay, listen up!"" If you like this sort of experience, having Uncle Stavros bring your food, come to The Parthenon. If you want an obsequious Thad for your waiter, there are plenty of other places to go in Chicago. They also handle large groups with grace; you call and say ""Can I bring in a group of fifteen?"" and they say ""Sure!"" And they deliver on that promise.  With young, vigorous Yanna Liakouras in charge these days, I look forward to many more wonderful meals at this Chicago institution. For newbies, please go at less crazy times, try some different things, enjoy the free-flowing roditys, and relax and get in the spirit of things. One last comment: Some people have found The Parthenon less than clean. I confess that the place was a little funky thirty years ago, but they have made great strides, and I'm very impressed by the new restrooms in the north annex.  And by the way, their parking valets manage the traffic on Halsted street with aplomb; tip them well.

2011-11-20,5.0,"This is hands down my favorite place in Greek Town and quite possibly my favorite Greek restaurant period! What do I love about this place? First, they provide free valet parking. Not many places do this anymore and finding street parking in the area is almost impossible. When you walk in, everyone is extremely friendly and you are treated like royalty the minute you walk in. I have eaten here about fifteen times and I have never received poor service. They handle large groups well and it doesn't take three hours for all of the food to come out.  Now, for the food. Start out with an order of the saganaki (goat cheese). It isn't rubbery like most places and it has just the right amount of salt. Scoop some onto one of the poppy seed slices of bread at the table and you've got a winning appetizer. Get the greek salad, they'll even give you some extra amazing feta on the side. It's a huge salad and easily feeds a large group. The dressing is amazing. For the main course, get the supreme lamb chops. They are rather large and deliciously juicy. They come with a plate of rice and some lemon potatoes and both could be great meals by themselves. For dessert, the lemon custard pastry with honey is fantastic. I can never remember the Greek name of it but it's heavenly. Let me not forget the alcohol, the rodidas wine is to die for. I brought home an entire jug of it the other day for some friends. It comes from Greece and they store it in giant jugs in the basement.  Everything considered, this is a great spot in Greek Town. I haven't found a better place for lamb chops.

First of all, the server seemed bothered by the fact that he was assigned to our group.  Geez...  Cheer up, big guy!  I wanted to remind him that there are lots of people out of jobs, so he should be happy that he has one. My order was very simple:  taramosalata (fish roe dip), egg lemon soup, and the gyros plate.  The taramosalata looked good, but what I tasted was AWFUL.  One bit and I was done with it.  Blech.  The waiter did not give me any pitas so I sampled it sans bread.  Why would you serve me a dip without something to dip into it???  I'm wondering.  Next, the egg lemon soup was delicious.  It was perfect for a chilly November evening.  It made me hopeful for the main course. When my main entree finally arrived, there was only ONE pita and a plateful of overcooked meat with a bunch of chopped onions underneath.  The tzitziki sauce was OK, but served long before my plate arriving.  It was all very unpleasant.  Maybe I'm a food snob, but having wonderful experiences at other establishments in the area, I expected more.

2011-08-28,5.0,"I have been coming to the Parthenon for about 30 years - literally since I was born. I am a HUGE Greek food fanatic, and can honestly say that no other restaurant in Greek town compares. The food here is consistently awesome and the owners are friendly and wonderful. But now onto the most important part - THE FOOD! I think with any restaurant there are standout dishes. I can't say I've ever had a bad meal here, but there are certainly dishes that I always order, and are the best Greek meals I've ever had in chicago. Here are my ultimate go tos - the all time favorites! 1) Cold Combination Appetizer plate: I ALWAYS order this. This cold combination plate is the best I've had anywhere PERIOD. Included in this plate is marinated cold octopus (frickin delicious!), bean salad with dill and olives, taramosalata (fish roe spread), melitzanosalata (eggplant-garlic spread), a dolmade and a cheese puff. This cold plate alone, for one, is enough with bread to be a meal. If there are two of you, only order the cold combo plate for one - it is PLENTY of food. If you have four guests, order it for two. Another excellent appetizer is the broiled octopus - the most tender octopus I've ever had. Order it, you won't be sorry! 2) Tigania: at the Parthenon, their Tigania is slow cooked pork medallions in a wine-tomato based sauce. AH-MAZING. Not only is it my favorite dish at the Parthenon, but it's my favorite Greek dish period. The pork is soft and melts in your mouth, the sauce is soooooo flavorful, and the rice absorbs all the goodness. It's an easy dish to overlook. Don't overlook it! Order order order!!! 3)  I am not a pork chop fan. Typically I don't like them at all. BUT, the pork chops at the Parthenon are the JUICIEST pork chops I've ever had in my life. GET THEM.  4) Best Moussaka I've had. 5) Whole fish of the day prepared Greek-style. GET IT. My dad's favorite, along with the lamb chops. 6) Lamp chops - GET THEM. Huge, and like butter. 7) Lamb with artichokes is delicious. 8) My favorite avgolemono (egg-lemon soup). 9) For vegetarians, their veggie combination entree is delicious and huge. 10) The rotisserie roasted greek chicken is AMAZING. SOOOO juicy and delicious. When you bite into it you will be shocked. Another easy dish to overlook on the menu and assume is boring. DON'T overlook it!!! SOOOO good!!!!!!!! 11) All the entrees come with a side - I highly recommend going with the braised eggplant, braised okra, or the spinach rice (served on weekends). Typically they just give you rice or potatoes as a side. Ask specifically for one of the above dishes. There are waiters that have been working here for thirty years. It's an institution. Get a bottle of house Roditis wine, put some lemons in it the Greek way, sit with your cold combo plate, and enjoy! The other places in Greektown just don't compare. Don't follow the sheeple and tourists and go to other places like the Greek Islands. Over the years I have tried other places and always felt disappointed and underwhelmed. The Parthenon is a Chicago classic and probably my favorite place in Chi-town! I have never made a reservation here in my life, so I wouldn't worry about trying...I didn't even know they took them, except for large parties! The wait is usually very very quick, so no worries about this issue. Oh - and free Valet parking, of course :) Oh, and just FYI, the Parthenon invented the deeeeeelicious flaming saganaki!!!!  'Nough said.",0.9988,0.757,0.195,0.048,0.672

We pulled up. Got free valet parking. Walked in to friendly smiles. Sat down. The old waiter (who had been my fiance's server millions of times previously) was reminiscing that he knew her when she was just a little baby. He remembered exactly what she wanted to order (without asking) - Roditis and a Cold Combo Appetizer. Holy moly was it delicious! I couldn't stop eating the delicious foods in the appetizer (cold octopus, bean salad, taramosalata = the best, melitzanosalata, dolmade, and a cheese puff).  Then came the meal, Tigania (slow cooked pork medallions in a wine-tomato sauce). After the appetizer and bread I was nearing belt-busting but it was too delicious to not finish! On subsequent visits I've managed to save some to take home in a doggie-bag and, man oh man, is it delicious the next day! Also, according to wikipedia (with references) The Parthenon invented saganaki - which, of course, their's is delicious.  All in all, go to the Parthenon for great food, great service, great value, and an overall amazing experience.

I purchased a travelzoo voucher last year and finally made time to head to Greektown. I'm giving a lot of background so you readers can understand the type of quality, quantity and service we received.  I informed our server that we had a voucher (in case we needed to order off of a different menu)...which is what we expected to do.  We were able to order (get this...you sitting down?) 2 apps, 2 salads, 2 entrees, 2 desserts and 2 coffees for $49. Wow!  The apps were delicious! Saganaki was good but needed a bit more lemon. The second app was some kind of ground beef in phyllo dough. Couldn't finish the second app. Greeks salad was to die for! We would have loved the extra feta cheese and kalamata olives but it didn't make the salad any less delicious.  For the entrees we had the spinach and feta stuffed chicken breast (which was the size of a man's palm). It came with rice and potatoes AND a size of ... Rice. HUH? More rice? Ok!  My husband had the lamb chops which also came with rice, potatoes and more rice!  We couldn't take more than one bite out of our entrees so we packed them up to take home.  Dessert was this genius concoction of custard and phyllo dough (yes, I love phyllo dough as much as the Greeks do). The second dessert was a flan-type called crema caramel. Literally, only one bite of each and those too were packed to go.  Complimentary parking is always a plus.  Service was slow but good. Never got our order wrong, always made sure our cups were filled with our beverage of choice.

Course one--appetizer:  we ordered the saganaki and gyros.  The saganaki was good (standard for saganaki).  The gyros were tasteless and fatty.  Very strange.  I've never had fat strips on gyros meat, and there was virtually no seasoning on the meat.  It was dry as well. Course two--greek salad--skip itand save yourself 5 bucks.  Iceburg lettuce with a few veggies. Course three--We ordered two meals--Pork chops and the combo platter:  The pork chop was decent. Could have been better. There was nothing ""stand out"" about it.  I could have cooked it at home.  The combo platter was a disaster. It looked like banquet hall food. The ""lamb"" was actually a slice of beef (who are you trying to fool!) and the dolmades were gooey and tasteless.  The moussaka was pretty yummy though. Course four:  the baklava was yummy, the flan was blah and the vanilla custard with phyllo dough was pretty good.   Bottom line:  The server was great and the food was awful.

He kinda killed the excitement of the blazing fire for me.  FOOD: I originally wanted the Vegetarian Special Combination, but they didn't have pastitsios (booo), so I went for the Vegetarian Moussaka. I regret my choice, as it was just too intensely flavored for me. Too salty. However, my date loved it, and I loved his Sea Scallops, so he was super sweet in basically trading dishes with me =) Sighh the scallops...so plump and flavored just right. Yummy.  Oh and of course we had the Saganaki, which was heavenly.

After another ten minutes, a waiter finally came over who seemed to be inconvenienced by our presence. He also had difficultly seeing and hearing.

The lighting was like an operating room and there are no windows in the entire place -- it was a bit claustrophobic. Also there were many large parties of families and the restaurant was very loud.

As I was eating alone, a mostly-vegetarian, and not looking forward to returning to the heat, I ordered three appetizers.  Two other people could've eaten with me, without a doubt.  I had Dolmades, Bean Salad, and Melopita, which was on the ""special"" appetizer list.  The melopita was amazing: feta baked in sheets of filo, then drizzled in warm, thyme-scented honey.   I was allowed, no, encouraged, to stay and linger over my meal.  The Kurt look-alike brought me more wine, and even poured something far better than the house white I started with at no extra cost.  I sat, cooled off, read a book, and relaxed while enjoying one of the best meals I've ever had. Four days later, my husband got in to town.  After he'd driven eight hours, the last thing he really wanted to do was get on a train and head back into the city from our suburban hotel.  But we did, and he still gets a little moony-eyed when remembering that meal.  Again, we ordered appetizers.  He had some little meat pies, octopodi, spinach pies, and some little chicken tart-like things.  I had two appetizers that night, having learned my lesson.  The feta-stuffed cubanelle peppers were so delicious, I stopped at the grocery store when I got home and got two pounds of the peppers and some cheese.   The evening meal was much busier, but the servers were no less attentive.  They remembered my visit from earlier in the week and were bemused at my quick return, and one of the owners came by to chat.  When I asked about a drink I'd had in a Greek restaurant in Vienna, she took the time to sit down and chat with me about the drink and the memories of her childhood its mention recalled.   I worked in food service for long enough to know that making your customers feel like they're dining solo in a busy room is a feat few servers and cooks can manage.  The staff at The Parthenon do it in spades.  Their food is remarkably delicious, wine list phenomenal, and the service impeccable.   If you're able to get there for dinner, you should go.",0.9745,0.9,0.08,0.021,0.45778533635676494
2010-10-20,4.0,"Thirty five years ago, my father, a modest immigrant, came to Chicago and stayed in a guesthouse just west of downtown.  That evening, he went out for a meal near his guesthouse. The place he ended up was a dingy hole in the wall that actually fitted his tiny budget, but the people were warm and friendly and the food was delicious.  He did remember one thing in particular.  They had cheese (which was a novelty in itself for most Indian immigrants) and before they served it, they set it on fire. This is what he told me when he last came to visit. ""Saganaki Dad.  It's called saganaki."" ""Yes!  That must be it."" After a bit of research, it turned out that the Parthenon not only was considered to have the best saganaki in town, but was the birth of it.  And it just so happens, it's the same restaurant (with the same owners, and whose daughter is the hostess) my dad came to thirty five years ago. The Parthenon, according to my father, has gone through a remarkable makeover.  On the Saturday night we went, it was bright and bustling and quite beautiful.  Our hostess, whose father owned the restaurant, was incredibly charming and friendly.  My father, a vegetarian, had plenty of options, contrary to the popular stereotypes about Greek food.  He settled on a traditional vegetarian combo, which includes veggie mousakka, veggie pastitsio, dolmas and some sort of leafy lasagna type dish.  I got the same, but with roasted lamb (for which they didn't charge me extra).  There were probably other good choices, but we were hungry and too impatient to go through the whole menu.  We also got saganaki and mini spanakopita as apps. The saganaki, of course, was fun and delicious, and better than the saganaki I've had in other Chicago Greek restaurants.  The spanakopita was also exceptionally good, and better than most spanikopita I've had. My father was very happy with his meal.  I was almost happy - the leafy dish I ate has a floral taste that I wasn't too fond of, and I wasn't that big a fan of the roasted lamb, which seemed a little too wet and slightly spongy.  Everything else on my plate was great, though.  The mousakka in particular was amazing. The service: Our waiter put forth his best effort, but was clearly overworked and dealing with far too many tables.  It was difficult to get his attention, and he was clearly rushed and flustered.  But A+ for sincerity and effort. Our meal came out to less than $50, which is amazingly cheap for the quality and quantity of what we got, the location, and the ambiance.  A hell of a lot better and cheaper than the meal we got at mana's vegetarian food bar a couple days later.   Overall, excellent and delicious experience, and very Chicago.",0.9987,0.748,0.21,0.042,0.5187853107344633
2010-10-16,4.0,"Tried to get into Meli's for brunch with my friends from out of town @11am Saturday. Once my buzz of the wait buzzer wore off after 1 minute of our 50 minute- wait to get seated, we switched gears to have some Greek for lunch.. So we walked across the street to the spacious and inviting Parthenon. The three of us ordered the flaming cheese, a Greek salad with anchovies, the combination platter, a small gyros platter, and the meatballs platter.  The $15.95 combination platter is a great way to become acquainted with Greek food for a newbie like me. It features grape leaves, moussaka, pasticizis, and roast lamb. I've never been one to understand the allure of Greek dishes aside from gyros, but this time, the moussaka, an eggplant meat lasagna dish, had me sold! The noodle had the perfect amount of crusty chewy texture, layered with an equally perfect mixture of eggplant and meat.  (Pardon me for a digression. To explain the mechanics of me, Jaz MO, once I'm hooked on a dish, it becomes a regular life-long addiction. It might be too early to tell, but the warning signs are there. I may have officially developed a new love of moussaka.) Thus, optimistically, I will soon proclaim moussaka at the Parthenon is the standard bearer for moussaka. The gyros was savory, much more naturally textured, less sweet, and less oily than other gyros platters I've had in Chicago. My friend explained it's likely because it was closer to being authentic lamb rather than the lamb/pork mixtures ubiquitously served elsewhere. Whatever it was, I will definitely be coming back and ordering it again. Ahh the origins of a future conundrum. It's going to be a tough toss up between the meal size portion of moussaka and the gyros. Will likely need to plan to go family style in my next visit.   I am glad we got the appetizer portion of the gyros. We were stuffed and couldn't even finish what we ordered. There's a separate room for the bar, with flat screen TVs featuring sports, and at least 2 ample sized tables. If you're craving football and Greek food on Sunday for lunch, this might be the perfect place.",0.9932,0.863,0.124,0.012,0.41979809406279994

The food has always been excellent, service has been attentive, and the atmosphere is fun. Plus the free valet is a HUGE plus in Greektown. So, last night the BF and I went here after trying to go to the Golden Steer in Forest Park (closed on Sundays). I veered from my usual choices at Parthenon, and went with the rotisserie lamb. I'm typically a gyro or chicken kabob girl. The BF ordered the gyros and lamb kabobs. Of course we ordered the saganaki (they invented it here!). The saganaki came out and our waiter was less than enthused about his Opaa. We yelled ""OPRAH!"" like we normally do and it broke the silence of the restaurant.  The main courses came out and looked good. However, my lamb was very fatty and we thought the chicken kabobs were undercooked, but weren't sure. Our shared illness later confirmed that they probably were undercooked.  The service was surprisingly poor this visit. Our drinks sat unrefilled for at least 30 minutes, even though we asked for refills. The gyros were also delayed from the arrival of the rest of the food. I still give Parthenon 4 stars, since before this I've always had such great experiences.

For the benefit of the inexperienced we usually go family style to prevent them having to order by throwing a dart at a map of Greece. While not the most sophisticated place on this stretch of Halsted, I think I've always enjoyed the food. Unfortunately, last night most of the Traditional Family Dinner was terrible.  The taramosalata was off- the roe had to have been old. It smelled like a can of tuna fish left on the dashboard of a hot car. The dolmades were bland and loosely rolled, just sloppy. But worst of all was the roasted lamb. The skin was cooked hard and was inedible. The meat was sparse, fatty and riddled shards of bone. I couldn't believe it. I was embarrassed.  The service was fine but it wasn't the show of manic attention I've come to expect. Maybe the energetic waiter act has gotten as tired as the decor. I mean the fuse box was sloppily painted over rather than getting a facade. The whole place felt half assed.  Also the strange woman covered in small bells and wearing a bejeweled acrylic sweater telling fortunes and shilling for tips in the dining room was more than a little awkward.

The restaurant in Chicago however...disappointing.  Perhaps if you are a suburbanite or if you are visiting Chicago for the first time, then maybe you would enjoy this restaurant.  We were here on a Saturday, and it definitely felt like we were amongst tourists and suburbanites from afar. This is a very loud restaurant. The people were loud and disrespectful, yelling profanities for everyone to hear, and they were obnoxious. Our waiter seemed very scatter brained and disoriented at times.  I ordered the Orange Roughy, and the Beef Stamnas. We also had a Greek salad. Just a side note, a Greek salad in Chicago is not an actual Greek salad such as the kind you have in Greece.  I was hoping that this restaurant would be more authentic, and it was not.  Our food was pretty disappointing. The Orange Roughy and vegetables were bland and drowning in butter.  The Beef Stamnas looked absolutely horrifying. I was pretty grossed out as I watched my husband attempt to pick the fat off the meat. I tried to give him some of my butter with fish to make up for his disappointing cow corpse, but he didn't seem to care for my dish either. For dessert we had the Chocolate mousse cake. It wasn't too great but it was better than both of our main dishes. The cake had an after taste that reminded me of food that had sat in a freezer for too long. I have not been to all of the restaurants in Greek town yet, but so far this is my least favorite.

2010-01-08,4.0,"While in medical school, I went out with a couple of Greek friends (Greek-trained physicians finishing fellowships in the US), and was surprised when they were surprised that saganaki, the famous Greek appetizer of fried kasseri cheese, was set alight at our table to a cry of ""Hopa!"" It turns out that the practice of flaming saganaki in ouzo before dousing it in lemon juice was started at Parthenon and later adopted by other Greek restaurants in the US who recognized good presentation when they saw it.  Though I've tried many of the places in Chicago's Greektown (Roditys, up the street, probably has the best skordalia, if you want your mouth to burn pleasantly with raw garlic and are more concerned with warding off vampires than impressing your date), and find myself returning again and again to Parthenon. The service is efficient and friendly with a very homey atmosphere; the prices are quite reasonable and the portions substantial. Most of their entrees can be upgraded to a full meal with soup, salad, dessert, and coffee for about $8; when I do this, I plan on eating leftovers for at least the next day's lunch as well.  I am partial to the sweetbreads, which I've normally had roasted with a hint of lemon. They're listed as lamb sweetbreads, but they taste just as delicate as veal. On my most recent visit, with several friends, I ordered an appetizer sampler with small bits of liver, Greek meatballs, sausage, and the sweetbreads; in this case the sweetbreads were delicately breaded and fried and everything was in a rich brown sauce. It was not as light as the roasted sweetbreads, but it was delicious. I also tried the cubanelle peppers, roasted and stuffed with an intriguing blend of fresh dill and feta; everyone at the table loved them.  Most of the dishes here have been good to great. The Athenian chicken is a standard. The egg-lemon soup is light and tangy. The lamb dishes and moussaka are consistently good.

(what? you scared, you scared). . . . . . . .*ahem*. . . So, yea, um the Saganaki here is pretty damn popular. It was rushing out of the kitchen like Niagra Falls. Left and right Saganaki was being set ablaze. Often times, like 5 at a time. I felt the heat as a set of Saganaki  (make it a game and take a shot every time I write it) was being lit for a table behind us. I was feeling more along the lines of ""Op---- ah ah ah, not to close to my hair!""  Eh, but I could understand why so much Saganaki was flowing, outside of slight pyromania. I usually order Saganaki when I go to Greek restaurants despite the fact that it's usually too salty for me. Parthenon's Saganaki, however, is without the heavy salty flavor leaving only crisped cheesy goodness. Seek and ye shall find!! So, enough about the Saganaki. My dinner companion and I got the Traditional Family Style Dinner, cause I mean. . .  it's damn near buffet, right? When I saw that on their website, being the buffet queen that I am, I had to partake. You get three appetizers (saganaki is one of them), Greek Salad, 3 main course sides and a selection of meat PER PERSON (awesome), and a serving of two different desserts all for $19.95.  Unlike Maggiano's family style dinner where you need a min. of 4ppl to get it, 2ppl or more can get it here.  Run through of the meal: +Appetizers Saganaki = Excellent. See above for more details Taramosalata = I'm gonna keep it real with you and say I thought this was a type of hummus, which I'm happy I thought or else I wouldn't have eaten it. When I looked at the menu online later I was reminded it was fish roe whipped with lemon and olive oil. Well, those whipped fish babies were good. Gyros = Self-explanatory, but these were great. We killed this! +Greek Salad = The feta cheese was wonderfully fresh. The dressing was nice, but a little thin for my liking. I would have preferred sliced Kalmata olives rather than having to do it myself. +Main Course Moussaka= The eggplant was tender and the bechamel sauce was well seasoned.  Some Greek places have this taste a little too Lasagna-like, but this was right on.  Pastitso= This was Ok. I only tasted slight differences from the moussaka. Seeing as they had a number of different ingredients, that's not good. Dolmades= Now, I love dolmades. The grape leaves were gritty and the filling left a lot to be desired. I was quite disappointed with these. Our meat selections= We got the Suckling Pig and the Athenian Chicken. Both were terribly dry and lacking flavor.  +Dessert Galaktoboureko= It was my first time having this and I didn't really like it. The menu said it was vanilla custard in phyllo dough, so I was expecting something creamy. It was quite bready. The texture and I weren't seeing eye-to-eye.  Baklava= Was wayyyyyyyy too sweet for me. What I could eat was yummy, but sweet to the 3rd power.  I'm giving this place 4 stars because of the food I did like, the attentive service, and the lively atmosphere. They had like 3 Christmas trees on our dining side and lots of lights/other decorations everywhere. It was so festive and made for a great dining experience.

2009-10-22,4.0,"People are always asking us, ""What is your favorite Greek restaurant in Chicago?"" - since my husband was born and spent half his life in Athens and I myself have traveled there twice.  The Parthenon is usually our answer - the food is pretty authentic, service excellent, and the decor only slightly kitschy.  Which is why we decided to hold our rehearsal dinner there, and we were extremely pleased with the experience. We had the small banquet room toward the back of the restaurant, and immediately upon arrival the waiters were filling drink orders, bringing out bread, and making sure everyone had what they wanted.  We had chosen the Family Style dinner, which consisted of several courses.  Soon after everyone arrived and was seated, they made a big display of firing the Saganaki, which of course all our guests loved.  My husband wasn't a huge fan of their tsatsiki, but he has yet to find some in Chicago that he likes.  Next were the Greek salads and gyro plates, followed by moussaka, pastitsio, and lemon chicken with rice and potatoes.  All of the entrees were a huge hit, especially the moussaka.  Oh I think there was some spanikopita somewhere in there too.  It was an overwhelming amount and variety of food! The food here is pretty classic ""Americanized Greek"", but it's done very well, and all our guests were absolutely raving about it.   And the price was right - the Family Style dinner is $19.95 a person.  It is more food than anyone can possibly consume, even a ravenous adolescent brother or portly uncle.  Drinks can add up, but they have decent prices on wine by the bottle.   And dessert!  How can I forget dessert!  It is included in the price of the Family Style dinner - baklava and galaktabouriko, a sweet custard in phyllo.  We ordered some chocolate cake as well to appease our pickier guests. Parthenon is a terrific place to hold an event - be it a rehearsal dinner, graduation or anniversary celebration or whatnot.  You get a lot of delicious food for not a whole lot of money, and the meal itself is an entertaining experience.  Or just go for a dinner on a Saturday night - order the moussaka. Their excellent service gets a nod from me as well - and they were so kind when our party got a bit rowdy and started doing shots at the bar....a bar that doesn't seem to get a lot of ""shots"" action on a weekly basis.

The Parthenon is definitely my favorite, simply because the food is much better than at Athena or Greek Islands.  We ordered the moussaka and the spanakopita for main courses - they were both HUGE and gave us a full meal worth of leftovers. The Moussaka was pretty good, but then, moussaka is always pretty good. The really good food was the appetizers. Their flaming saganaki was great - gooey and soaked in brandy and delicious. The best thing we had all night though, were these phyllo-wrapped whipped feta things covered in honey - heavenly.  I'd probably give them another star if they'd figure out how to keep the noise level down - it's really hard to find a good date place in Greektown because all of the big restaurants are these boisterous crazy loud family places. My boyfriend and I had a really nice time, it was just a little hard to hear. Service was eh - they didn't seem to coordinate well so they came by a couple times and asked if we needed to order, when we already had, things like that. But it was a really busy Friday night, so it's understandable. Pricing is also just fine - especially if you like doggybagging leftovers. It came to about $60 for the two of us, with appetizers and house wine, but we didn't order ""full"" dinners - just moussaka and spanakopita with no sides, which was more than enough food. I would give negative a gillion stars not to the restaurant, but for the incredibly annoying, offensive drunk Cubs fans at the next table.

Turned out to be the best decision we made.  We've rediscovered Greektown!  And to add icing to the cake, we discovered that there is FREE valet parking at the Parthenon!!  We were sold!

The meal was exactly what we wanted and worked well for us as pescetarians, but we felt like oddballs because everyone was getting the flaming cheese (ooopa!).  The only disappointment was that the Greek salad was made with Iceberg, but that can be forgivable sometimes,  At least the feta was real and it was garnished with four anchovy fillets.  Other than that, we liked everything, especially the tzadziki. Our enire meal came to $44, including a glass of wine and a Greek mineral water.  We had so much food that we brought home a big bag with four take out containers of stuff we didn't finish.  All in all, it was a good experience.  Now that we know about the free valet parking, it's kind of a no-brainer: we'll definitely be back.  Oopa!",0.9621,0.875,0.09,0.036,0.47089002267573704

After that we shared the large gyro, and it was the best we've ever had. Perfect pita flatbread, tender lamb and beef, and tangy yogurt sauce. $9.75 for the dish, and it was plenty for the two of us.

Instead, I was pleasantly surprised to find that Parthenon's menu is extensive and can range from a completely reasonable under $10 gyros ""appetizer"" plate to higher priced entrees that I presume are larger.  I wasn't really hungry when I came here and just ordered from the dessert menu: Greek yogurt with walnuts and honey. It was my first experience with Greek yogurt and wow! It was nice, thick and didn't upset my stomach like some regular yogurts can. The honey and walnuts were also a great addition. I was proud of myself for choosing a ""healthier"" dessert option for my late night meal. I did have a chance to eye my friends' food. One friend purchased an appetizer that looked like lightly philo dough covered goat cheese, fried, and simmering in honey. Okay, talk about the not so healthy option, but it was good...  As for the aforementioned gyro plate appetizer, it looked like the standard size gyro that you could get anywhere else for the same price, but dressed up. My friends liked it. Overall great experience, although I wish that they could split checks. I was with a group of ~20 people and luckily we're all used to assigning someone in our group to do the math for our large restaurant bill. Otherwise, this place can accommodate large groups and looks like it would be nice for families and dates.

I'm totally obsessed with the little suction cups that fell off the pieces and were just chilling on my plate...they were so cute.   My family and I have been going to the Parthenon since I was a wee little one and it is always consistant and always delicious.  The servers are also really good with substitutions...they don't mind swapping some rice pilaf for some braised okra if you ask, or trade your broiled eggplant for some green beans.  They don't fuss or fight and never charge extra.  If you love Greek food and love Greek seafood, please find some time to head over to the Parthenon for  some authentic Greek eats with great service in an old school place.  OPA!",0.9887,0.796,0.152,0.052,0.5372549019607843

2009-02-28,2.0,"Let's start off with me saying that I'm a vegetarian so my entire experience is based upon the non-meat options. For dinner we had the Family-Style Vegetarian dinner, which at $19 a person seems like a great deal - until you eat the food that is. Now, not all of it was horrible so I'll walk you through it. For starters we walked in and were seated quickly, always nice, some members of my party didn't like the main open area and asked of somewhere quieter - we were moved to a room near the back, our table one of only two filled in the room was awkwardly behind the serving post for drinks in the area. Once seated we moved ourselves to a table nearby with a more pleasant view. Speaking of thoughts on the table it may have just been in this area but the chair was too high for the table and I couldn't cross my legs because of it (ahh, the little things.) To drink, being pregnant, I had sparking water with a lime it in - can't complain at all about that. Then starts the food - they brought out a loaf of bread to accompany the initial appetizers, cheese, etc. Really wishing it had been pita because the bread just seemed wrong - it was white with sesame seeds on it and had a flavor of it's own which took away from the other foods. The saganaki was fun and always beautiful and I can't complain about cheese! The two dips served at nearly the same time however were completely lacking - the tzatiki tasted of STRONG garlic and very little cucumber, my apologies to anyone I breathed on following the meal. I've had such better tzatiki I was really disappointed in it, we also had the melitzanosalata - eggplant spread - also garlicky to no end, and very bland otherwise. Again the spreads just didn't' go with the bread either. Up next a greek salad - the dressing was boring, very oily and lacking in flavor. Finally (we were more than ready to have it over with) they brought out the main course - all on one plate family style, which works for me. All of it was overcooked, and yet not heated up enough - guessing it was made much earlier and simply reheated at the time. I can't actually say which stands out as the worst - they were all just awful. It included: spinach-cheese pie (too much spinach, not enough other flavors, and over cooked), vegetarian moussaka (flavorless, way over cooked and yet mush), vegetarian dolmades (probably the best thing on the plate but still very lemony and a let down), vegetarian pastitsio (this was just overdone and awful) with a side of roasted potatoes and okra, both of which were flavorless mush. Finally the meal was ending (YEAH!) they served coffee which I can't imagine was greek, maybe old folgers? And two desserts- baklava and galaktoboureko - both of which were mildly redeeming, but I'd lost interest in eating by that point.  Then the BEST part - we were free to leave!! Opa!

Our server's eyes widened a bit when I explained that I didn't eat dairy, but he quickly went to the kitchen to find out which dishes would be suitable. I made a filling meal out of appetizers and sides; each is really intended to be shared, so it's a sizable portion. The hummus here actually has chicken broth in it, but several other dishes were available for a vegan. The eggplant spread was different from baba ghannouj, but mighty tasty - it was more ""green"" tasting, with parsley and no tahini. I also had grilled mixed vegetables (carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, zucchini); ask for olive oil instead of butter. Pan-fried zucchini/eggplant and cold bean salad were other vegan options. My favourite item was the skordalia (cold potato puree with TONS of garlic). You could get it as a separate item, but I ordered mine as part of the cold beet salad. I really like garlic that ""bites"", so this was perfect. The Parthenon was bustling with dinerslast night, but service was very attentive.

Our waiter hardley said anything to us and had 0 personality. My pasticho was cold and my husband said the chicken wasn't as good this time around. I doubt we will be back as we want to try the other restaraunts.  Original Review: I went here this weekend for a workshop so I got to experience two different lunches. On day one, I had the trigona (Ground beef and feta baked in crispy philo), pastitso- which was wonderful, the saganaki which was a bit chewey and the skordalia- which was way a bit of garlic overkill but ummy. I also had the house red wine which was really good. On day two I had the chicken kefte with roasted potatoes and vegetables and the egg lemon soup. The potatos were not that good but my husband loved them and the veggies were just bad. I did try my husbands dish which was really awesome- it was the Kotopita. Looking back I wish I would have ordered it. The inside of the building is quite nice and the prices are standard. Our waiter who we had on both days was so accomidating and friendly.

They must all be related because they want you to feel like you are in their home back in the old country. There are painted murals of the Greek islands on the wall to take you away. All the waiters are in their crisp whites. If this isn't a port on the island of Crete, it sure must be close.

As an opener, I had what else but the $4.50 Greek Salad with anchovies (see photo) - very fresh tasting with a big square of feta cheese and a wonderful vinaigrette. My main entree was the $12.95 Braised Lamb, a hearty portion of meat that was falling right off the bone (see photo). It came with lots of rice to sop up the juice.

Don't be surprised if you order wine and it comes in a little glass that is similar to a juice glass.   I think the flaming cheese is over rated.  And you should probably have a large appetite or more than two people if you order it for an appetizer.  It's very rich (you will begin to see a trend soon) and filling when paired with the rolls they give you. I was very impressed by how attentive the wait staff was though since I only ordered water to drink with my meal (after the wine).  They paid a lot of attention and kept it full....I drink A LOT of water... Finally the dish I ordered (the vegetarian combo since I couldn't decide) was VERY filling and RICH.  I really enjoyed the stuffed olive leaves and the potatoes that came on my plate had a sort of bitter, almost pickeled, flavor..I like it.   My husband ordered the leg of lamb.....It LOOKED really tender and probably tasted great to him but looking at it as a vegetarian was really disgusting.  I normally don't have problems watching him eat meat but something about how shiny, fatty, and tender the lamb seemed was really disgusting!   Oh, on a final note we attempted to ask our server if when they pan fry things (like scallops) they would be cooked all the way through....there was not really a great understanding between us.  He couldn't understand our question so my husband ordered the lamb.   For dessert we tried the yogurt honey and walnuts...WOW!  I understand that greek yogurt is NOT supposed to be sweet...but I am not sure if it's supposed to taste zingy...Like it was fermented.  ??? We didn't have any stomach issues that night but it just tasted REALLY odd.  We asked the server if it was supposed to be so bitter and he said, I swear..""ummm...sometimes it get that way.""  I sort of laughed thinking I wonder if it gets that way when it is old.  But he told us that if the milk curdles while cooking the yogurt it can get bitter...But I still am REALLY not sure if it was supposed to taste fermented.

Kalamata Olive Plate -- No olive oil, just olives and like a thousand of them. It was as if they opened a jar and dumped them on a plate. Pastitso Vegetarian -- sounds magnificent on the menu but in reality, totally disappointing!! There was a sketchy white cornstrach-y layer that tasted like paste near the top that ruined it completely. Pastitso - Regular style but with the sauce served on the side. My Gigia just rolled over in her grave. Macaronatha - So simple but somehow they eff-ed it up. There was a strange brown watery sauce pooled beneath the pasta. No, it was not browned butter. Roasted chicken dinner - The chicken was tasty but the dish consisted of a half of a chicken with plain white rice (no gravy) and one potato.  My mom got the combo plate and she seemed happy with it. In fact she ate it all so that combo plate gets a good grade. The rest = CRAP CRAP CRAP!! Everything was also cold. Mmm.  Cold, comforting Greek food.

My American friends however, were thrilled with the food. So if you know nothing about Greek food you might find this place acceptable, but please please don't confuse this with the real thing! The service was adequate though for a large group. It seems well prepared to handle large numbers of people in a n efficient manner.",0.9906,0.734,0.221,0.045,0.4970046082949309

2007-04-24,1.0,"I was excited to try a new Greek restaurant with such a unique menu for Greek restaurants in Chicago. My excitement quickly turned into extreme disappointment and later sickness. We started out with fish roe spread, beets, potato's, and octopus. The fish roe tastes as if its out of a can. The beets lacked substantial flavor. The octopus tasted like it was cooked in spaghettio sauce. After highly disappointing appetizers we hopped that the unique menu items would redeem the restaurant. Being a big fan of liver we ordered a plate with sweetbreads, liver, and sausage. Each of them lacked any flavor whatsoever and were uncomprehendingly bland and cooked inappropriately (liver sweetbread). We also had a lamb dish which was cooked in a bad spaghettio like sauce again. (I actually like spaghettios but this was terrible). For another main course we also had broiled sweetbreads. Like the combo dish, they were not flavored, were greasy, and the texture made me forget why I liked sweetbread. Of course like most Greek restaurants, service was horrible and you felt as if you were inconveniencing the staff by asking for something or even ordering. The ambiance was reasonable with exception for a rather bad smell that was even worse than the flaming cheese (saginaki?, I really can't spell). As if the three categories of rating were not enough, three hours after finishing the meal my typically iron stomach began to turn. For the next 40 hours I would be attempting to forget about the food and simply get out of bed. Based on the symptoms I'm pretty sure it was E Coli. All in all, I would not consider this an option for Greek food in Chicago. Any restaurant, of the 4 others I've been to in the area Greek town and other Greek restaurants, surpasses the food and service here.",0.1415,0.833,0.09,0.076,0.4812660333493668

Anyhow, off my rice horse....also recommended is the lamb served with artichokes in a thick yet light lemon gravy.  The menu says ""market price"" for this dish, so artichokes must be like lobster in the midwest!  Service is always fantastic and the surly male wait staff crack me up.

Then when we wanted to, you know, leave it took us 15 minutes to even find him so we could get our check.  I spent over 100 dollars at this place and hated every second I was in there.

I could have had dessert here and been more than perfectly happy... but we haven't even gotten to the main course yet. - Moussaka - eggplant and meat, deliciously seasoned with bechamel sauce.   Unlike anything I've ever had. -Pastitsio - macaroni with meat sauce, similar flavor to the moussaka, equally delicious. - Domades - stuffed grape leaves - I wish I had 7 stomachs so I could eat more of these at this point. - Your choice of chicken, lamb or pork.  Among the 6 of us, we tried all 3.  Chicken was ok, a little dry and a tad too charred.  Lamb was moist and flavorful.  I didn't eat the pork b/c I was becoming the pork by now, but it looked good. - Dessert - not one, but TWO - baklava, and then galaktobouriko (vanilla custard baked into layers of phyllo, syrup glaze) - both amazing, and perfectly portioned at this point - Coffee - nice and rich, perfect accompaniment to the desserts and perfect ending to a near-perfect meal All this for $18.95/person!!  Great service, and we had enough leftovers to feed another 6 people, I kid you not.
