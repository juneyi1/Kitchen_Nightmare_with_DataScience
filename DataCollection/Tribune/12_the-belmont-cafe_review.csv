Then another 25 minutes to get our orders. Water for all, ice tea for one, milkshake for another, and I can't remember the third right now.  Ice tea never came, milkshake was gritty cheap ice cream in a glass of milk, and third item was wrong too. Water was warm and not refilled.  Flagged down waiter (who I think is the just bought out owner) and he listened to our complaints and just said ok, then walked away. We had no idea if we were being charged, if replacements were coming, or what.  We had to have someone else get him back over to us as he was ignoring us after that. First time in my life I've never left a tip. I actually enjoy the decor... But it was crazy hot out with no air and everything felt awful and sticky.",-0.9403,0.827,0.039,0.134,0.45956349206349206

The third table that was occupied appeared to be a manager or owner doing paperwork sitting with what looked like a cook or kitchen worker. Several tables were dirty but the customers were gone already. The host/server sat us at the table of our choice but it was dirty so we were moved to another table. She was also the only server in the restaurant. I guess it was too hard to wipe the crumbs off the table. We asked for water and coffee, the water never arrived but the coffee came fairly quickly and wasn't very hot. We didn't have silverware at the table so we flagged down the server for a spoon to stir the coffee. A few minutes later she was walking to our table with a couple spoons but was stopped by the table with the manager/owner who was talking to her for a while about who knows what when obviously she's got something to do, like bringing me my spoon. Meanwhile, we're still waiting for the spoon to stir our now even cooler coffee. We then placed our food order at around 425pm. Simple order of steak and eggs, steak cooked medium rare and eggs over easy, and am omelette, both orders with pancakes. About 20 minutes goes by and still no food.

I went in with a date on a Saturday night after seeing improv down the street, hoping to find a place where we could have a beer but actually have a seat and hear one another. Well, they no longer serve alcohol, so plan accordingly. We stayed and had some dessert (or breakfast as dessert) instead. My date had a freshly baked chocolate chip cookie and I had an order of french toast, and the bill didn't break $10, so no complaints about that.  The ambiance left a bit to be desired - they changed it from cheerfully run down diner to oddly minimalist black and white breakfast place. It didn't really feel welcoming or comfortable. Also, on a Saturday night it was almost completely empty, which certainly makes it feel like you are making a mistake when everywhere else on the street is plenty busy.  If I were just ranking this as a breakfast place I would give it 4 stars, because the food was good and the server was attentive.

2015-11-15,1.0,"Where do I start with The Belmont Cafe? My boyfriend and I have visited the restaurant twice now. The first trip was below average. The food was greasy and the service was slow. We decided to give the place a second shot after we were turned away from the local Ann Sather's restaurant because of the extremely long line. What we quickly learned is that we should've sucked it up and endured the pain of the line across the street rather than suffer the atrocities of The Belmont Cafe that day. Our second visit began on a beautiful fall day. The restaurant was about one-fourth full at the time we arrived, with a large party seated next to us. It took about 5 minutes before a waitress first encountered us. It appeared as if there was only two waitresses in the entire restaurant. As a result, we decided to order immediately to speed up the process. We knew what we wanted since we had been there once before. I ordered what I think to be a simple breakfast: two egg over medium, toast, and a side of sausage. My boyfriend created his own skillet in which one of the ingredients was bacon. The waitress immediately informed us that they were out of bacon. HOW IS A BREAKFAST CAFE OUT OF BACON? HOW? It's a breakfast staple. Regardless, we additionally ordered some coffee and OJ and the waitress notified us that she'd put our order in ahead of the large table next to us. What a nice lady. From my recollection (as this visit was roughly a few weeks ago), it took 5-10 minutes to receive our coffee and OJ. She served the coffee without cream and sugar either. Our waitress would disappear for long stretches at a time, so it was difficult to flag her down for these missing items. Additionally, the OJ was served with ice cubes in it. I personally have never seen OJ served this way before. Regardless, it was bitter, sour, and not fresh whatsoever. As an avid OJ drinker, I was disappointed from the start.  After a brutal 20ish minute wait, our food was served. Apparently, the simple breakfast I had ordered was not so simple for The Belmont Cafe. The ""over medium"" eggs were extremely runny, the toast was not even toasted, and the sausage was rubbery. My boyfriend's create your own omelette was twice as greasy as the first time. His toast was also NOT toasted. In addition, the toast was only served with that mandarin orange jelly stuff. Where was the classic grape and strawberry?  After we decided we had had enough, we asked for the check. This was another 10 minute process as the waitress continued to disappear time after time again. Overall, this was a horrible, horrible experience and we will not be returning.",-0.9712,0.889,0.032,0.079,0.4956619769119769

2015-11-15,1.0,"I would give zero stars if I could. Had a crazy craving for blueberry pancakes and figured a diner would do the trick. My boyfriend and I ordered thru grub hub. I got a simple order of blueberry pancakes and a side of ham with a coke. The bf got ""the Hangover"" burger which boasted bacon, egg, and buffalo sauce on a pretzel bun.  We started getting mad when an hour and a half passed by and the food had not arrived. I called the restaurant and a woman with a heavy accent answered, stating ""I guess so"" when i asked her if my order had left the restaurant recently. When I asked for a time line, she say ""I don't know maybe 5 minutes I guess?"" Ooooohkay, I was definitely not expecting the best at this point.  Moments later we heard the sweet sound of the doorbell ringing. The bf returns with the bag in tow, and I instantly was put off that I payed $3 for a ""coke"" (it was actually RC, false advertising) in a 12oz to go cup, not a can like I was expecting because as I figured, the drink was flat.  Ok let's get to the food. My pancakes (which should have been simple enough) were soggy, cold, and plain with some blueberries scattered about and a ton of blueberry syrup drizzled all over them. They were NOT advertised that they would be soaked with artificial berry syrup and I would not have ordered them if I knew that. Oh and my $3 side of ham? I stared at it for 1 minute before I remembered I even ordered it, since I couldn't even tell what it was. Two tiny scraps of meat that I could see through.  Boyfriends burger: stale pretzel bun on a medium well burger. Granted there was no option to specify how he wanted his meat cooked, but I tell you this he wouldn't have asked for a hockey puck if he had the chance to. He opted for the sweet potato fries. They were soggy, cold, and extra salty. Mmm yummy! He said the only thing that saved the flavor of his flavorless burger was that it doused in hot sauce.  Would we have had the same experience if we dined in? Maybe. Maybe not. But I tell you one thing, I have ordered from many diners before and they were pretty good experiences and didn't take 90 minutes. I cannot believe I wasted $35 here.

Breakfast all day- ummmm, yes.  I got the Eggs Benedict, a personal favorite.  It came with potatoes, and choice of toast or pancakes.  I was also handed a 10% off coupon with my water, and offered a free cookie either while waiting for my meal of after. I thought that was sweet.   When I was eating the staff seemed rather active, and a waitress who wasn't my waitress even stopped by to see if I wanted some plates cleared off.  I hadn't see my server in a little bit since there were other customer she was busy attending to, so I thought that was nice.   Any who, sorry about the yuppies comment.",0.9959,0.749,0.211,0.04,0.5856797138047138

The salad my friend ordered had cucumbers that looked past their shelf life by color. My chickens fingers were fine, but it came with a side of goat cheese instead of ranch and the other sauces promised in the menu. The waitress said the cooks must have thought we wanted that in addition to the baked goat cheese? Makes no sense to me either.

On top of all of this, we were charged an extra dollar for that random side of goat cheese, which the waitress did take off when I asked her to.

Service was horrible - 10min for coffee, 30min for food Portions were too small - Their skillet failed to even fill the skillet plate they put it in The food was subpar even for standard breakfast food The brunch competition around here is stiff, and unless they can turn this place around quick I imagine they'll be gone in 6 months",-0.2815,0.809,0.09,0.101,0.365

She'd walk right by and we would have empty soda glasses that we had to stop her and ask for a refill.  Our food took over 30 minutes from the time we ordered, and the restaurant was not that busy. She never came and apologized for the delay. I had to ask someone else to check on our food. Also I ordered my steak sandwich medium and it came extremely well done. But she didn't come by and ask how the food was until we were almost done with the meal.  Either they train their servers or they are going to go under.",-0.8003,0.871,0.029,0.1,0.5471428571428572

2015-08-03,1.0,"Don't waste your time. I attempted to dine at The Belmont Cafe last night with my girlfriend around 10:30.  Their posted hours said they were open until midnight so we figured we were fine.  Upon entering there was no one to greet us, so we decided to seat ourselves (they were pretty dead, so there were plenty of places to sit).  We saw one server working who was with another table, and after a few minutes he did come over to let us know he would be right with us before heading into the back of the house. After about ten minutes passed by, the server finally came back out.  He said something to another table and then went straight to the back of the house again.  Finally he emerged again a few minutes later, only to turn right back around without ever coming by our table.  At this point we had been waiting for about 15 minutes with no service, so we decided to give up and left. It's possible this server was too slammed to get to us (there were about 3 other tables seated) or it's possible he didn't feel like dealing with another table and purposely ignored us.  Either way, the restaurant wasn't properly staffed, I won't be back, and I don't think this place will last.",-0.3773,0.893,0.05,0.057,0.3585097001763668

I understand it's frustrating when you should be cut, but don't take it out on your customers! We didn't even receive our drinks until AFTER our food came out! Which by the way, we were one of two tables and the food took pretty long to come out. I get that they just recently opened, but I will not be coming back.

It took almost exactly 40 minutes for us to receive our food on a not-packed Sunday. One item was ordered without onions and came with them. Then we had to ask twice for hot sauce. To their credit, the food and ambiance is better than Clarke's. But the prices are higher and the portions are smaller.

The food was great, the waitstaff was accommodating and attentive and the location offers a fun and comfortable atmosphere. We started off with the pretzel that could seriously feed 5 people; I could have just eaten that and been 100% satisfied, but you can't only have an appetizer with so many great options in front of you. For my meal I ordered a skillet and pancakes while my dining companion ordered the brisket sandwich - we split both meals as we tend to enjoy trying everything. Both were delicious choices, cooked well and flavorful. I am anxious to try their other meal options in the future! I would definitely recommend stopping in!",0.9873,0.706,0.256,0.038,0.595

Also be sure to check out classic skillets and omelets which are available anytime!!! I'd stop in late night since they are open until 5am on the weekends or for lunch as they are right next to the belmont stop on the train it makes for great people watching. Hot new restaurant, I'd say check it out for sure you will have a great dining experience.

2015-06-26,5.0,"The Belmont Cafe has replaced Clarkes and I say good riddance.  The new remodel has an open floor plan and a very modern feel.  Wood, leather and metal seems to be the theme here and it works well for the space.  So far, every employee I've met has been incredibly friendly and knowledgeable about the menu.  They have typical diner fare. I wasn't super hungry so I ordered the appetizer pretzel with beer cheese dipping sauce and a side of mustard. It was delicious. I'll mention that you can order a full or half, I got the half which could easily have been shared by 3 people and was delicious.  Update: So I've been back to TBC twice since my original review and have to say the food has been pretty solid. I tried the buffalo chicken wrap which had lettuce, tomato and cheddar cheese. It was fantastic. It included fries which had sea salt and pepper. Like another person said, they could've been cooked a bit more but were still really good. Today I went again and had a burger and fries. Both were great but the fries once again could've been cooked longer and this time were missing the sea salt and pepper which was a bit of a bummer. I'm sticking with 5 stars because for a place that's only been open for two days, they are doing a great job, I've worked at several restaurants and its not easy opening month let alone opening week. Keep up the good work guys!",0.976,0.795,0.155,0.051,0.5870404040404041
