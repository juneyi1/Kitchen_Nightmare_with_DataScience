Went back another night for dinner. They gave me an my girl some attitude for not only not having a reservation but apparently I wasn't in fancy enough clothes for their liking. At least thats the impression i got when the greeter and hist gave me the up-and-down. They sat us right away though, despite the lack of reservations. Sitting here right now ignoring my girl typing this review waiting for some more Buttermilk's, this time with apples and apple butter instead of blueberries.

We came for their daily oyster special ($1.50 from 5-7) and on Thursdays they are byob.  The service was nice and friendly but they pushed on the up-sell, which can be annoying sometimes but the deals they had going on were good so we didn't mind.   The oysters were fresh and they gave us plenty of lemons and mignonette which I always appreciate but unfortunately the only hot sauce they had was Sriracha  but not a big deal. We also ordered a couple orders of fries. They were good and came with some yummy fancy sauce, but these are not enough to share, at least not for my group!  The chef came out and let us know that in preparation for ribfest they had some brisket on hand, so we tried that and it was really good and came with a delicious polenta sauce, but also not enough in my opinion.  But then again my group likes to eat a lot, so that might just be us :) Overall, I had a great time and I will definitely be back!",0.9941,0.709,0.251,0.039,0.5891156462585033

2015-08-06,2.0,"Very disappointed in my experience here. I was looking forward checking out Browntrout ever since I moved in.  Upon walking in there was no host and did not know the patio was not open seating (there is no sign saying otherwise and there were plenty open tables). When I asked an employee, I was rudely told ""no. I'll be with you in a minute."" It's not what was said it was how it was said as if I was a burden to this employee. I understand rotation so I was actually not trying be a burden. (Turns out we could pick any table we wanted).  Right off the bat, not a good start. We ordered drinks, again understanding they are cocktails and take a while, but these took 15 minutes. After ordering the next round of two different cocktails took another 15 minutes again. The bar and restaurant were not busy whatsoever. Also, the second round of cocktails were not tasty at all and we had to send them back not being able to drink anymore of them.  Instead of receiving our entrees together, they came out one at a time and staff was apologetic about this. Food was pretty tasty. The trout entree was raw for my liking but that's just my opinion. Small plate trout was delicious as well as their waffle fries.  Ending on a positive, our server was very friendly and attentive. Very apologetic about what we experienced at the restaurant. Very knowledgeable of the menu and answered any questions we had.",0.9589,0.857,0.094,0.049,0.5037082917082918
2015-08-01,1.0,"I don't normally write bad reviews about restaurants, but this criticism is well deserved. Most places I give the benefit of the doubt. I'm going to list in bullets cause that's the best way I know to get my point across: - The waiter raved the cocktail mixer was a ""beast"" and that the cocktails were amazing. They were okay, little flavor though and small portions. - The mussels appetizer was inedible.  The mussels were gigantic, chewy, and not fresh.  The sauce was ok but fairly flavorless. I understand the ordering mussels is a gamble, but don't test your luck here. - The arancini was tasteless, like deep fried circus balls. Avoid. - The tagliatelle bolognese was good (++ for homemade pasta), but there was a misunderstanding and the waiter brought the small portion instead of the large. The small portion was seriously three bites, so not worth the price. - The smores sundae dessert had bergamot sprinkled over the top of the dessert.  What a weird way to ruin a dessert. My wife commented that perhaps they were trying to replicate the experience of dropping your toasted marshmallow on the ground, finding that there are grass clippings stuck to it, and then eating it anyway.  Bleh. - The waiter set our table three times: once each for the appetizer, dinner, and dessert. Totally unnecessary.  What is this...a high-class joint?  Nah.  Also, the food came out lightning fast, like we would order and the food was at our table in 2 minutes flat. That's a problem, because it means that there are pre-made dishes sitting back there...just bad. - The one good thing about our experience was that I left my sunglasses on the table and the bus boy ran us down (we were already a couple blocks away by this point) to get them to me, which was very kind and much appreciated. In summary, I am surprised this place still exists. Do not waste your money. Sorry owner guy, I know you claim this is farm-to-table and all that, but the execution is just awful. Work on that part.

Walking in we both noticed and commented about the number of children.  We were sat at a (what was) quiet two top and were promptly waited on.  As we were waiting for our drinks to come the four top filled in next to us with a family.  The mother actually asked to be moved away from us so that we would not be bothered.  We said it would be no issue. We had the salad and oysters for starters, the oysters are also a happy hour special.  I had the steak which was cooked to a perfect MR and my partner had the pasta.  Both dishes were excellent and we will certainly be back, most likely with friends who have kids. When we were leaving the mother apologized for a mini outburst  then  inquired if we knew that kids ate free.  We said no but it wasn't a big deal.  If you do have kids the eating free is a pretty cool deal.  There are several options for them and the dessert is brought out by the chef himself (who has children).  If you don't like children you should avaid this place like the plaugue between 5-7.",0.9678,0.828,0.135,0.038,0.5570346320346321

2015-05-28,3.0,"I've been here a few times now & I feel like I can finally sum up how I feel... A-Ok fits perfectly.  The great: --Sunday fried chicken dinner. This So-IL girl knows & loves a good piece of fried chicken. Though their crust still isn't close to what I grew up eating, it was pretty good... crispy, golden, but not overly greasy. --Service. Every waiter/waitress/host/etc. I've ever interacted with is super nice & always goes above & beyond in helping you with menu selections. --Specials. Great deals on wine, oysters, etc., certain nights of the week. The middle: --Desserts. I love dessert, so I can barely ever find anything to complain about when it comes to something sweet... but I think they over-sell their desserts in that nothing is ever what I expect. The apple fritters with apple butter? That is not apple butter it comes with, my friends. That is applesauce. They are delicious, yes. But what fried dough isn't? The meh: --Sunday fried chicken dinner. I wish the chicken came with something other than the bland-ish grits. I'm sure if you cover them in the gravy, that'd make them better, but I am a weird So-IL girl in that I loathe gravy. The grits just seem to be lacking seasoning. --Cost. Definitely a little expensive for what it is. I respect the whole local ingredients, etc., thing, so I know it's going to be a bit more than I normally would pay, but without a groupon or something of that sort, we can't really afford to go here very often. --We came once during the heart of winter, and the door kept getting stuck open & a freeeeeezing cold breeze hit us every time someone would walk in the door. I felt bad for the hostess that had to keep going over to close it. Overall, I'd say I *like* Browntrout... I like that it's close to our apartment & there is ample street parking.

My husband had bought the groupon, so we headed here for a small plate and salad (to share), individual entrees, and dessert. Our waiter was fantastic. He made wonderful recommendations, was nearby when needed, and came to check on us often. he explained the restaurant's MO to us right away - locally sourced food as much as possible, with many Illinois beers and in the summer, many of the veggies served being grown by the chef himself. I started with a new cocktail that had mixed up - the Spring Equinox. I'm not usually a huge rye fan, but the chamomile infusion and honey added that something extra that made this cocktail fresh and spring-y. I loved it. My favorite part of the meal was my entree - the shrimp risotto. They gave me a huge portion, and I gobbled up every last bit. The risotto was perfectly creamy without being too heavy. My husband had the hangar steak, and it was phenomenal as well. The only thing that didn't wow me at all was the dessert - the apple fritter with ice cream. It was basically just fried dough with a small amount of apple jam or something. It missed the mark, but it was excusable considering the superb meal we had until then. The groupon didn't really give us that much savings, it was maybe the cost of an appetizer, but it was well worth it. We like to try new places with groupon that we'll keep going back to at full price, and Browntrout is definitely one of those places.

Usually the groupon says when they do not allow opentable reservations, and nowhere on the groupon did it say that. I was already annoyed going into the dining experience. Upon entering the restaurant, I was pleasantly greeted and led into the back to a corner table near the bar. This table was stuffed into the corner and I was easily within arm's length of the next table. I cannot say enough about how much I loathe restaurants with this kind of community seating. If I wanted to hang out with strangers, I would eat at the bar. At a table, I would hope to enjoy a quiet night with a friend and not have to worry about the next table's conversation or them listening to mine. Because I was early, I got an earful of my neighbors' very boring chatter. Because I was early, I was also left alone for some time, and I saw my waiter noticing me but not coming over. Really? Don't you know the best way to get people to buy drinks is by catching them alone looking for something to do so they don't sit there awkwardly? 10 minutes later, the waiter finally came over and simply asked if I was waiting for someone. Not only was I waiting for someone, I was also waiting for something wet and boozy. I ordered a beer. Another ten minutes went by before my drink actually showed up. It's not a Guinness. It shouldn't take this long to pour and deliver to me. I texted my friend that ""I already hate this place."" She finally showed up and by this time I had suffered through two songs played by the live bluegrass band which had set itself up right by the bar. As thankful as I was for it drowning out our neighbors' conversation, it would also end up drowning out our own. So much for a quiet Sunday dinner. Now the food. The groupon allowed us a shared small plate, a shared salad, two entrees, and a shared dessert. Both of us decided the food was just mediocre and certainly not worth the listed prices. Our shared small plate, the poutine fries, was the best thing we ate. Our salad, the Werp Greens, was just ok. We liked the radishes, but the rest was nothing special. My entree was the trout, which was tiny. It was well-grilled and tasty, but for the size and for the non-special brussels sprouts accompaniment, it was absolutely not worth the $23 price tag. For her entree, my friend ordered the quarter chicken, to which our waiter should have offered her the half because we had up to $24 to spend per entree. But in the end, it was ok, because she said the chicken wasn't even that good- it had no seasoning to it. Nor did she like her crunchy polenta, though she enjoyed the kale. Back to the waiter- I am being picky with him because he was much more friendly and informative to our neighbors', suggesting entrees and appetizers and all- and they had the groupon as well. This is why tables shouldn't be so close together- you can compare service much more easily. Our dessert was the apple fritters and they were basically just fried balls of dough with some apple butter and icecream. Just ok. The ice cream was the highlight here. I was expecting actual apple in the fritters, not just fried balls getting soggy in applesauce. Was the bluegrass band any good? They were very enthusiastic, at least. But no banjo, which would have made them much more tolerable. And they kept coming around asking if they were too loud. Um, if you have to ask, then you already know the answer. And they had an envelope for band donations afterwards. Plus, the menu gives you the option of buying the kitchen a 6 pack. Really? Is this a drink name or are they really asking us to treat their staff? Considering the food prices, you'd think they'd have enough to go around for everyone for working there.  For such a pretentious little place in an unpretentious neighborhood, I was expecting much more. I will not be coming back- especially on a Sunday.",0.9964,0.827,0.123,0.05,0.49699934768427934
2015-01-19,3.0,"I found this place via groupon and after looking at their well-designed website and finding a really unique menu, my husband and I decided to give it a try.  We went on a Sunday night. We were immediately seated and informed that Sunday was the night they offer free range fried chicken in addition to their normal dinner menu and bluegrass music. I like that this place has something different going on a few nights each week (Tasting Menus, Live Music, etc.).  I liked the atmosphere, which while not particularly upscale, was wonderful for a casual sunday dinner. Now, about what matters most, the food. My husband went ahead and ordered the Fried Chicken where as I went for the Black Garlic Bucatini. All of this was after some delicious oysters and a mediocre wedge salad. My husband definitely picked the better entree. The Bucatini (pasta) serving was maybe 5 inches in diameter. The lobster shallot cream was a thin (like a film really) coating on the pasta and it came with maybe 4  baby shrimp. So thank goodness we were sharing. The chicken was big and delicious. I also loved the corn polenta and greens they paired with it. Lastly, for dessert we had a dark chocolate souffle that hit it out of the park. The service was great actually (contrary to many of the reviews here). I didn't find any of my waits to be extraordinary and they checked on water regularly.  The killer for me was price. While I definitely love saving money via groupons, If the price is reasonable, I'll be back to pay full price. At $120.00 (40 post-groupon, but we already paid 60 for that) for two people, I won't be back. I realize we got drinks, and a dozen oysters so I expected a higher bill, but for that much money you can find better.",0.979,0.864,0.124,0.012,0.5656730769230769

First of all, for a ""nice"" restaurant, the atmosphere is so off it just doesn't make sense. I noticed the cheap tables and chairs that you would see at a Denny's right away, and I have never noticed something like that at a restaurant. The entire decor of the place is just weird and confusing. But I thought, well if the food is great I can ignore the strange vibe...the food was just pretty good. Not at all like what was expected and certainly nothing special. The dealbreaker was our medium rare hanger steak that was served medium well with a charred black crust. And this was the servers rec due to the meat ""melting in your mouth."" Really??! We didn't have time to send it back since it took nearly an hour to come out in the first place.  The reason we will not dine here again is the terribly slow service. On a Saturday night with a packed house, there were literally two servers working the entire restaurant...two!! How insane! It took 20 mins to receive a cocktail and an additional 40 mins to receive a salad and of course they bring you no bread or anything. Just crazy bad, no matter how you look at it.

2014-05-23,2.0,"I chose this restaurant based on the reviews. We had five in our party for a special occasion. Parking was easy and the atmosphere was very nice. The waitress was pleasant and timely, seated promptly since there were only several occupied tables. We get there at 7:30 pm and the temp had dropped considerably. A couple was dining where the open window was so everyone in the restaurant had to wear their coats, if they had them. They did close the window after the couple left but that was at 8:15.  The water was room temperature and we were not offered ice at all and the bottle of water left on the table was also room temp. We ordered oysters and the poutine to start. The oysters were fresh but they came with a lemon oil only. We asked for horseradish, cocktail sauce, lemon, tabasco, or anything that might resemble traditional condiments for oysters. The waitress said they had none of these in the kitchen, really? The lemon oil, did nothing for the oysters and no one wanted them because it was like eating them plain. The poutine was very tasty, too bad though because it was less than two bites per person. I had four small pieces of frite that fit on my fork. Then my husband asked for rolls and butter.  She brought four rolls, even though there were five people, really? So we asked for more , which she brought. The rolls were very good and homemade. But, when we got the bill, oh what a surprise! Um, $ 6.00 PER plate for the rolls!! $12.00 for 8 dinner rolls! Really?! But once again, I'm glad we did because it allowed us to not stop for fast food on the way home. The main course. I had the ribeye, cooked perfectly, flavorful, BUT, EVERY SINGLE BITE had gristle, and was the size of a filet mignon, which would have been enough if it was a quality cut of meat. Iv'e just never seen a ribeye that small, maybe they harvest these from munchkin cows? I wanted to send it back but didn't want to create a negative vibe for our special occasion, so I just ate it and had to surreptitiously spit out the inedible parts. My husband got the smelt and shrimp fry,  he said it was very greasy, and it was the smallest plate of food I've ever seen. I guess that's ok, since what he did have, upset his stomach all night from the grease. One person ordered the mussels and said they were JUST OK. the other two guests had the walleye, which were both 1/3 of a whole fillet. They both said it was very good, but really, 1/3 of a fillet? We don't eat massive portions, and maintain a healthy lifestyle. We prefer quality over quantity, but this was over the top.  This review is coming from someone who eats out at fine dining restaurants frequently.  We also had Moscow mules which were very good, and very cold in the copper cups, which was refreshing change from the tepid water. We shared the rice pudding dessert that was also homemade. It was also, ok, nothing to write home about. I would not go back since there are so many restaurants that are so much better.

After reviewing the options for the pre fixe menu I decided to do ala carte from the menu.  They had 1 cider available at the time but it was $8.50 for a 22 oz bottle so I was happy to try it. Organic something or other. See pix.  I got the poutine ($9 see pic) for an appetizer. The poutine was actually really good and served inventively without being really goopy/gravied out.  For the entree I ordered a porrchetta di testa sandwich which was just ok and the fries were fries. Service initially was appropriately attentive but fell off at the end for which there is no excuse as we were one of 3 tables in entire restaurant.  I would like to go back and try different things but only with company with whom I have endless things to talk about as I did on this evening.,0.9603,0.858,0.126,0.016,0.5176470588235295
2014-03-13,2.0,"There were two highlights to this dinner: 1) Free, easy street parking on nearby side streets and 2) Catching up with my friend Daniel C. The restaurant was a disappointment although I was originally stoked about it too. I was the first patron to arrive at 6:00 PM on a Wednesday evening. I was seated at a nice, four-person table along the wall. Daniel arrived soon after me and our evening began. We both got cocktails. Mine was the Farmer's Daughter... for $10 (the ellipsis is part of the name). It was scrumptious and sweeter than the drinks I usually get. It tasted like a certain candy although I couldn't quite put my finger on which one. Next, I got the Glazed Brussels Sprouts for $8. They were delicious! The only thing that I didn't like about them was that the cubes of ""ham"" were primarily cubes of gelled fat (they are clearly seen in my picture). The more solid cubes were okay but only vaguely resembled ham in flavor only. The color was still white and off-putting. We had to ask our server David to identify the mysterious cubes and he assured us that it was ham. David sold me on the Wood Grilled Baby Octopus. It was the perfect selection for me that evening. It was a small portion and light. The flavors were delicious. The only problem was that it was served cold. I asked David if it was supposed to be cold and he said no; however, he reflected that my meal was plated first, before Daniel's, and that probably explained the temperature. He offered to heat it for me or to exchange it with something else. I didn't take him up on either offer. I ordered the Rice Pudding & Concord Grapes for $9, only mine was served with raspberries instead of grapes. It was a fine substitution and David told me about it when I ordered it. The flavors were wonderful; however, the rice was firmer than my wont. In fact, the grains were firmer than I would normally cook rice at home and rice pudding is supposed to be unabashedly mushy in consistency. I told David and he explained that the firm texture was due to the rice being brown rice. Regardless of the varietal of rice being used I prefer my rice pudding to be mushy. Daniel drew my attention to the decor of Browntrout. It was one of those things that I hadn't noticed initially. Once he brought it up I couldn't stop considering it. I even asked David about the theme because we couldn't figure out what it was. The light shades were covered with ferns and there were some large pieces of artwork and some small photographs. David answered that the chef's theme was simply ""green,"" which is strange because it wasn't all green. Some of the artwork was from a friend of his and the small photographs were from the chef's honeymoon. That explained a lot. Although the decor wasn't off-putting, there also wasn't anything special about it. It's not the sort of place where you enter and you're treated to an entire experience that begins with the ambiance. Speaking of ambiance, they changed the intensity of the lights two or three times while we were there - dimming and brightening them. The music played was Arcade Fire. Arcade Fire is okay, but not my favorite and definitely annoying if played the whole time. Lastly, there were highchairs at the long table down the middle of the restaurant. Those highchairs reminded me of being at IHOP or Denny's. Lastly, the service was only alright. David was personable enough but there were a few times when we wanted him and he wasn't there. We leaned around in our seats to spot him and try to catch his eye. I was annoyed simply because (by the time we left) we were one of three occupied tables and David wasn't timely enough. Furthermore, David didn't comp or discount anything even after I had negative comments about all three of my dishes. I wasn't looking for a free meal. I don't normally comment on my food besides saying how wonderful it is. I thought I was being gracious to David to put up with fat cubes, a cold meal, and firm rice. I guess I paid for it.",0.9879,0.848,0.102,0.05,0.5688842203548081
2014-03-09,3.0,"Went for Valentine's day dinner and really enjoyed it. My only beef with this restaurant is the excessively high corkage fee. I am happy to see they have one night now with no corkage, but they really need to waive the fee every night if you spend a certain amount or order entrees or some other system for dumping the fee.  Their wine list is pretty meh so to get me back in more frequently, need to see a little more accommodation of the BYOB folks. Many restaurants are seeing the light on this and backing off of fees. Alternatively, amp up the wine list.",0.7748,0.834,0.113,0.053,0.5590952380952381

I went on a Thursday: BYOB night, and brought a six pack of IPA from Bottles & Cans (the beer and wine store next door.) The dining room is pretty small, so imagine my surprise when we weren't greeted by our server for about ten minutes. What was she doing? I was very hungry, and Browntrout isn't the type of place to have bread or chips on the table, so I grew pretty impatient very fast. When our server finally showed up, we barely got an apology. I would have appreciated some sort of acknowledgement that waiting for that long is not acceptable and certainly not the norm at Browntrout. But, the food. Oh the food! The burger meat was short ribs! It was amazing. The fries were delicious, but the house-made ketchup just tasted like mushed up tomatoes, not great. The Brussels sprouts were amazing, and the warm kale salad was great. We finished the meal with the fallen chocolate souffle and ice cream flight.

2014-01-07,2.0,"I used to like this place but service has REALLY gone downhill. I received an email for a special dinner they were offering for New Years. I made a reservation and when we arrived, we were told we had to wait 20 minutes because other tables had arrived late. We were taken to the tiny bar area where there was nowhere to sit and waited until our table was ready. Of course the table that opened up for us was right next to the entrance so we got to freeze while eating.Once sat, we waited and waited for our waitress, and even had to ask who was waiting on us so we could wave them down for drinks.Another waitress points her out and says to expect service to be very slow that night and we should feel free to take it out of our waitress's tip.I didn't even know how to react to that? Then, it took our waitress 20 minutes to bring us our drinks. I asked if she could go over the specials for the night and she replied that there were no specials. What? No specials? Im pretty sure the specials that were offered on their website is what brought us in. I then pulled out my phone and showed her their website and asked about the prime rib and walleye for 2 that they had advertised for 30per person. She explained that she wasn't aware that there were an specials but we can still order those dishes but at the regular price listed on the menu. Irritated by her stupidity, I asked to speak with the manager. 5 minutes later the owner/chef comes out of the kitchen and explains that he had to increase the price because his supplier increased the price for him. I asked why he didn't pull this info off his website and he just blamed his ""web guy"" for the mistake. You would think that at a nice restaurant they would still honor the special since it was advertised by them, but they did not. The food itself was ok, nothing spectacular,but our appetizers were terrible. Our cheese plate was a joke, I swear they just spooned some ricotta cheese from Jewel on a plate and called it a cheese plate.

There was a manager type woman who saw our wobbly table and fixed it immediately,  we got smiles and greetings when entering and leaving,  and the food/drinks were served I'm a timely fashion.  The menu seemed small, but had a nice variety.  Seafood makes up a majority of the menu so don't think the name of the place is just to be cute. I had The Burger, consisting of two patties,  wild mushrooms,  cheese,  and a red onion jam with a side of fries.  I ordered a medium cooked burger and got rare, which I regret not sending back. Otherwise it was a good dish. The other order was Yellowfin tuna which was good but came in a small portion. It was small enough that a snack was in order for my guy when we got home which is never good.  The bloody mary was large and came with lots of celery, pickles, and bacon!  I was surprised by how many kIds were in the place (2 babies and 4 toddlers) and am not sure if that's typical, but at least that day gave it a neighborhood-joint feel.  It was a nice experience but I don't think I'll go out of the way again to visit.  If it's in your hood and you like seafood, it's worth a shot.

For me, it didn't blend well.  The really strange thing, however, was that the risotto tasted very sour.  Afterwards, I looked again at the menu and noticed that it had vinegar in it.  This seems like on odd choice of ingredients and maybe a case where the chef was a little too heavy handed with the amount added for my liking.    My husband had the fried chicken and said it was very tasty, but that the mashed potatoes and gravy were just bad in texture and taste and our friend who was dining with us agreed.  For dessert, I had a little molten chocolate cake and it was actually very tasty.   Overall, I found our experience just too all over the place.  I won't be in a rush to return, but I applaud them for their desire to use sustainable and locally farmed ingredients.",0.9651,0.797,0.151,0.053,0.4705072463768116

In fact, the flavor is the one thing that dishes at brown trout are never lacking. I imagine using homemade, local, organic and exotic/innovative ingredients are where all of the amazing flavors come from.  I had the mushroom risotto that was extremely rich without having much cream (my preference). The risotto had house pickled cranberries and carrots which really made the dish due to the balance of acid with the savory richness of the mushrooms. I also had pan seared walleye with crispy skin, broccoli and a black garlic vinaigrette (YUM). My friend and I shared our deserts- a cheese flight and a ice cream flight.

The ploppy decor of this place and the haphazard arrangement of the tables disguises, and not in a good way, the fine quality of the food and beverage.  We were extremely impressed with the food.

Service...We arrived at 6 and waited to speak with someone until 6:15.  We ordered drinks and apps.  The server was disinterested and couldn't have been less helpful.  Our drinks never came so we asked another server who returned 10 minutes later with one of them.  We flagged down out waitress who informed us that drinks should come out together. (Really?!)  After she talked about it with the bartender for 10 more minutes my drink came.  My wife was now concerned about time as we only allowed for 1:45 minutes before our movie.  We promptly ordered our entrees. The apps took an hour.  The table next to us sat 10 minutes after us and finished theirs before ours showed.  We asked why it took an hour for soup at which point she brought it out.  The soup and mushroom risotto were both bland and uninteresting.   We informed our server that we were now in a bit of a time crunch so we offered to pay our bill ahead of time to expedite things.  We paid and waited and waited and waited.  Food never showed.  At this point, I'm Irate.  I ask to speak to the manager who tells me that it's not their fault as they didn't know we were on a time crunch.  It took an hour and 45 minutes!  They then showed up with our food to go which we grabbed and ate in the car.  The pork was burned and the burger was sub Portillos. I find it odd that a restaurant that prides itself on local, sustainable fare wouldn't have their staff mention any of that.  Our waitress was one of the worst I've ever had.  I've worked in restaurants for over 20 years and am the easiest customer you could ever hope to have.  I don't need my hand held but tell me something about your restaurant.   We got nothing...no answers to our questions, no suggestions, no nothing.  We could barely get her to slow down by our table.  I read some other reviews of people that had a similar experience with the service and they too wound up eating cold take out.  If the chef can't handle 18 tables, he shouldn't be a chef.  His restaurant is simply ""unsustainable"" due to the awful service and mediocre food.  The scariest thing for the chef/owner was that our god awful waitress was actually training someone.  Good luck with that.",-0.4489,0.896,0.051,0.053,0.4686507936507936

So I'm presuming it was good because it still tasted pretty good cold... Anyway, here's what happened. On Sunday, 11/10, my wife, daughter and I, along with my visiting brother and sister-in-law, decided to give them a shot based on their Yelp reviews. We were celebrating our wedding anniversaries (8 days apart), and wanted something different than the usual North Center fare and something we had never had before. Browntrout fit the bill and, as I mentioned, they have great reviews here.  We sat about 6:15, it took 10 minutes to get our drinks (ordered a bottle of wine, and a beer), we ordered food about 6:30 and it didn't come out until 7:30. Keep in mind that the place was pretty empty when we arrived. Even when we ordered, but for some reason it took an hour for four dishes. On top of that they brought my daughters meal out first, along with the apps, around 6:45. So she was done and ready to go around 7. We tried to keep her entertained for the next 30 minutes, but it wasn't happening, and we also had to eat if our food was ever going to arrive. Finally around 7:25 my wife decided to walk our daughter home, and a few minutes later I asked them to pack up our food. It would have happened sooner, but our waiter pretty much avoided us most of the night. By the time we got the food and walked it the five minutes home, it was cool. Now, like I said, it was still pretty good, but I think we would have preferred it hot and maybe about 25-30 minutes earlier. We have a feeling they were sitting for a while given the temperature and the time it took to walk home, but it's hard to tell. What's a bigger a concern is that, after I asked them to pack up the food because it was taking too long, no one came to ask what the problem was. They took my daughters $6 kids meal off of the bill, so obviously they knew something was wrong, but why not ask or explain or something? In the end we spent $140 on cold take out, and was disappointed. Clearly based on the reviews this is not the norm.

I was uber excited for my mussels, as I had been craving mussels for weeks.  Unfortunately, almost half of the mussels were hardly opened, making it very difficult for me to eat my meal at my usual rapid fire pace.  Prying open those shells hopefully burned me a few extra calories.  Not only that though, the actual mussels in several of the shells were difficult to fork out of the shell, which I've never encountered before.  It took a lot of skillz to not lose any meat, and this got to be a little frustrating.

We ordered the shashito peppers and they were good, but they were really small and there were not very many of them, which would be OK if it wasn't $9. We also got a cheese board of 3 cheeses, which were also good, but the portion did not justify the cost. We also went for the fried chicken and once again it was good, but not worth $22!!

While a bit pricey, you get plenty of food with top notch ingredients.  We started with the summer salad with fresh blueberries and radish; the amount of dressing was perfect. We also had the bread board with fresh baked parker rolls and black sea salt butter. Carbs are my weakness so this was an easy way to please me. We then split the roasted tomato Risotto which is one of the best I've had. Perfectly cooked and balanced with fresh vegetables. We finished with the chocolate soufflé - which I always have to give props to as this is difficult to bake.

2013-05-18,5.0,"My wife and I have now to Browntrout 3-4 times over the last year or so, and have been consistently impressed with the quality and creativity of the cuisine and outstanding service. Browntrout is now one of my real favorites for special occasions. Honestly, I have pretty high standards when it comes to food, and I love this place, so it shocks me to see the few reviews here that are negative. Most of the negative reviews say ""maybe we just came on an off-night"", and I suppose that must have been the case. Our most recent excursion, which we're just back from tonight, featured (as always) plenty of great local and sustainable ingredients. You can tell, because ramps and asparagus, which are precisely in season, appeared in several menu items tonight. My wife had an outstanding asparagus salad, and I a cold asparagus soup, which included lumps of shrimp, candied pecans, and sliced bits of asparagus. The meld of flavors was phenomenal: I couldn't have possibly predicted how well the shrimp and candied pecans played against the cold soup, and made each bite slightly different from the next. It had an incredibly fresh and clean taste: this was early spring in a bowl. For the main course, I loved my lake trout with asparagus and hazelnut pieces, served over black lentils mixed with smoked trout. My wife, who has never been much impressed with risotto, surprisingly went for the risotto, which tonight featured ramps. The dish had a gorgeous artistic presentation resembling the forest floor: over the green risotto were some other greens I didn't recognize that tasted vaguely of sweet pea pods, fresh mustard seeds appeared in clumps resembling clusters of tiny forest mushrooms, and finally 3 very thin but broad slices of prosciutto topped it off. The prosciutto just melted into the risotto in the most amazing way. I haven't even mentioned the cocktails yet. Sure, lots of places have great cocktails, and you hear lots of great reviews of cocktails, blah blah blah, but these are truly extraordinary. The bartender makes many of the mixers right there on the premises. One of the negative reviews on Yelp mentions the wait for their drinks (10 minute hardly seems shocking, but whatever), but this is partly the reason: your drinks are expertly crafted and perfectly balanced to order here. Just be a little patient and you'll have some of the best cocktails you've ever had. For Browntrout's wait times in general, I wouldn't characterize Brown Trout as  exactly slow. I've never been annoyed at the length of time anything took, though it's certainly not rushed, which I think would be a worse offense. If you're tight for time, of course this may not be the best choice, but if you want to go and have an unhurried experience that allows you to truly savor the outstanding cuisine and also enjoy some conversation, the timing is perfectly suited for that. Personally, I wouldn't want them to change their timing. Regarding the ambience, they have a pleasant, upscale atmosphere, but not so formal that you can't come as you are if need be. While of course it can get loud when busy, they're not pumping irritating music to create fake energy, and as a result, you can usually talk relatively easily with your party.",0.9984,0.751,0.202,0.047,0.5913074623788905

They are super sustainable and locally sourced, so you can feel really good about the food you are eating, no post dining guilt here.  No ma'am.  I've got to be up front and say that my scope of eating here has been almost entirely focused on the fried chicken.  We tried other things, including a tomato salad that blew my mind.  But we went for the fried chicken, and I can say, without a doubt, that it is the best fried chicken in Chicago, easily the best fried chicken I've ever eaten. They cook the fried chicken sous vide before frying it.  This means the meat is unbelievably juicey and flavorful and the crust is crispy and not over oily.  They do not always have the fried chicken, and they were doing Sunday night fried chicken night with blue grass, but I don't know if they are doing that in the winter.  You have to find out when the fried chicken is available and get it because it will change your world and the way you think about chicken.  I recommend getting the dark meat as it holds up to the cooking method better. That being said, because they are locally sourced, the menu changes with the seasons, so make sure you go a couple times of year to see what the next menu brings.  They also host a small farmer's market in the summer on Tuesdays? I think?... and they have the bar open with a small portions of their most popular dishes available.  That's when I tried their Moscow Mule, which is wonderful.  Just wonderful.",0.9904,0.836,0.148,0.016,0.6156456456456454

We were a group of 4 and I think the best way to eat here is to share everything because there are so many wonderful items that you get to have a bite of them all if you do share.   The portions are split out either as smalls or bigs on the menu so it's easy to share or do have your own menu items.  In terms of the actual food, the cheese and meat platter is a pretty fun way to start off your meal and I like that you can select what you want to put on there from a list of several choices - or you can get them all.  Other standouts on the menu are anything to do with the brandade - I dream about this stuff, which may be silly, but there is something about this stuff.  And this time it was fried into crispy balls with a soft soft soft center - positively heavenly.  If you have an opportunity to try the mussels Tom Kha Thale, definitely do it.  They come in a big bowl with some delicious broth but then you get a bowl with more of the broth, mushrooms and some other fantastic veggies and then - and maybe this is what made the whole things - these killer rice cakes - put some mussels in there and mix it all up - it was the perfect cold winter night treat.  We also tried the hanger steak, which was really lovely, and the Browntrout, which was some fantastic, well, trout.  Other fantastic bits: poutine, mac and cheese, pumpkin risotto, creme bruleee, lamb sugo pappardelle - we made it through a big chunk of the menu and there were nothing that we didn't love. Very comfortable, friendly place with a warm atmosphere and great people manning the floor and the kitchen. Highly recommended all around.",0.9991,0.693,0.268,0.039,0.5931684981684983

I had a veal plate: liver and sweetbreads.  It was good but not great.  It needed something to counterbalance the richness of the meat.  My girlfriend had hanger steak with potatoes.  The steak was fine, but the potatoes completely lacked seasoning.  How do you send potatoes out of the kitchen without salt on them?   The desserts were good, especially the peanut butter parfait.

I had a Moscow mule which was excellent.  Plenty of fun cocktails to choose from, incvluding a Pimm's Cup which I almost ordered. The wine list was good with plenty of variety (mostly American) and plenty of affordable options.  We got a nice oak/buttery Chardoonay whose anme evades me. Regarding food, there were 3 of us.  2 ordered the walleye and 1 ordered the trout.  Walleye was was the winner of the night.  But both were perfectly cooked and tender.  The walleye just had better sides and more flavor. We ordered a side of mac & cheese.  So good!  Most people kill you with the crusted panko crumbs.  Browntrout does not do that.  Tiny/delicate pasta rings with a very creamy and smooth sauce.  The best way to describe it is delicate.  Not overpowering but still extremely effective. French press coffee was a great touch and the deserts were very well recieved by the table (but I forget what we had, sorry!). The service was on the slow side and was a little erratic.  The people were very nice, so this is not a deal breaker.  But the servers seemed just a little too comfortable, like they had been working at Browntrout for years and were very much compacent in their jobs ie there was no real desire to do an excellent job, they just wanted to get the job done. The ambiance seemed a little under par.  It was a bare bones place that doesn't have much to it.  They could really warm the place up with a few more nice touches and some art or fixtures.

2012-08-02,4.0,"Had a very pleasant dinner tonight with some friends at Browntrout. Browntrout is a Bib Gourmand recipient and features upscale casual dining. Sustainable and locally source foods are featured and the Charcuterie is made in house.  The food is fresh and the menu changes up every few days based on what is available and in season; their website provides a good idea of the types of dishes to expect.  Browntrout occupies a long and narrow space with the bar towards the back; the decor is modern and trendy  - the water glasses are really cool and are slanted (our server joked that you know you have had enough to drink when the water glasses appear normal). Although Browntrout has a full bar that includes some fun sounding specialty cocktails, craft beers, several wines, fresh squeezed juices and intriguing housemade sodas, on Thursdays they have BYOB with no corkage. Wine is served in Riedel style glasses. Our primary server was Kevin and he was great. I had walked to the restaurant carrying a bottle of  Durigutti Malbec and the bottle heated up quite a bit while in transit (it was in the 90s outside); as Kevin was about to uncork my wine he noticed that it was rather warm and offered to cool it down for me. For water service you have the option of still or sparkly water for no upcharge. Our assistant server also was highly attentive and kept glasses full and the table clean.  Our food was really good and a great value; Michelin was spot on with the Bib Gourmand award. Our table shared a selection of four cheeses and some salami. While the portions were a tad small for the cheeses they were adequate. The cheese board also contained pickled ramps, pickled pickles and apple butter and a basket of crostini accompanied the order. There are approximately nine different meats and cheeses (each) to choose from and there is anything from typical salami types meats to sous vide pig face or jowl for the more adventurous.  Our table also shared a small plate of Maine mussels that were served basting in a succulent sauce with some small bits of bacon to add some flavor. There is only a limited number of large plates (entrees) to choose from, but the selection was nice with a couple of nice fishes (including trout of course), goat three ways (my selection), a hanger steak, and a gnocchi based dish. Everybody was very pleased with their entree and portion sizes were about average.  Our table shared a butterscotch creme brulee for dessert that was outstanding; it was served with two mini pasty cigars and had more of a caramel than custard filling. I highly recommend ordering this if it is on the menu.  Browntrout has elements of fine dining such as the quality of the cuisine, the attentiveness of the servers, silverware is replaced each course and crumbs swept of the table. However they also seem to be trying to appeal to families; there is a children's menu, diaper changing stations in the bathroom, on Wednesdays children dine free before 7:00pm and on Tuesdays during the summer there is a ""kids cooking demo"" (that I am guessing does not involve goat meat). While this is nice for families, it does detract some from the upscale ambiance (there were multiple young children in house tonight that at times were rather noisy). There also was live music tonight (I am not how sure this is featured at Browntrout); it was an acoustics band playing Old Time music (similar to the Oh Brother Where Art Thou soundtrack). They were pretty fun, but it did make conversation a tad difficult at times.  Browntrout offers some nice specials (i.e. Prix Fixe Wednesdays, No corkage Thursdays and half price wine Sundays); they also have events such as Farmer Market dinners on Tuesdays during the summer. While I would not consider Browntrout a destination restaurant, if you live nearby or happen to be in the area it is definitely a nice option. It seems like a great choice for families wanting more of an upscale dinner than typical family friendly joints, but if you are seeking a more quiet ambiance I suggest booking a later reservation. Everybody in my party enjoyed their meal and I certainly would be up for dining here again in the future.",0.9985,0.828,0.155,0.017,0.5292485432991761

Several appetizers and entrees were good, not great. The burger was horribly gamey....which we were told, after we asked how it was prepared, that it should never be. Was it prepared incorrectly?

Came here * finally * for a Friday night dinner date.  No reservation, but luckily we were sat promptly toward the back of the restaurant.  The place smelled fantastic.  Not just of excellent cooking smells; but also a kind of clean / green freshness; a faint good-kind-of-campfire smokey smell; then of course, the aromatic wonders of the food (and cocktails - something sparkling with fresh lemon + gin; something smooth with gin + housemade floral soda.) My trout dish came with two small fillet pieces atop a mound of creamy, luscious polenta.  Around the plate was popcorn pieces and an assortment of peas - in and out of their pods.  The combo was perfect; and I can't say enough about that damn good trout.  Also tried a side of the mac & cheese - awesome, creamy, cheesy goodness.  The man ordered an assortment of goat; which he enjoyed. But I think I chose the better plate.   Food is sourced locally from farms scattered across IL and surrounding states (see the chalkboard at the back of the restaurant for reference if you want to know where things are coming from...).  Service was great and attentive.   Really enjoyed it and we'll definitely be back.   My only gripe with this place: $20 corkage fee?!?  WAY too steep.",0.9974,0.712,0.27,0.018,0.6540404040404039

I was so shocked that he would take the time to come to our table to deliver the sad news of no spinach. The food. We started with two meats (prosciutto, sausage) and a brie like cheese. The prosciutto was the best I've ever had. Sliced thin but not too thin. The chef came to serve this and when he came back to check on us, he explained how the prosciutto was a special type. I can't remember, but again, the chef was awesome to take the time. We then had our appetizer: escargots in tiny puff pastries with cured bacon. I was so happy the spinach appetizer was out. This was fantastic. We then shared some mac and cheese which my beau loved. He had the trout which was awesome. I had the mussels. While I've had better (some were a bit stringy), I'm willing to forgive because everything else was over the moon extraordinary. The music. So much fun.

2012-04-27,4.0,"I've been wanting to try Browntrout since they opened, as they're walking distance from our apartment.  We went yesterday, a Thursday, since they were participating in the Dine Out For Life event, and part of our bill got donated to an HIV/AIDS organization.  So props to Browntrout, for helping out the local community!   On Thursdays, you can BYOB for free, which we did - and I would highly recommend doing this, as they do have a corkage fee every other day.  Makes the evening more affordable.  Also if you live in North Center, they have coupons that come in the mail - you know those big stacks of random coupons you get once a week - we've gotten a few that offer 15% off your check, any day of the week, any meal.  AND on Thursday they had a live music duo, a guy playing guitar and another on stand-up bass.  They are called ""The Dogpatch Ramblers,"" and they play folky Americana goodness.  Apparently on Sunday nights they get even a little more bluegrassy, which I'd very much like to hear.  They weren't too loud at all, you can still hear your date and the music.  All the more reason to come on a Thursday! We had a reservation for 6:30 pm.  The place was about half-full at the time, but filled up over the next two hours.  I'd recommend reservations - especially given the free BYOB on Thursday, I imagine it often gets packed.  The decor is simple - some nice art on the walls, some cool-looking lamps, but it doesn't feel ""fancy.""  I love places where the food is organic and upscale but you feel like you can still wear your jeans!  The one funny thing about the decor is the ceiling.  Look up - it literally looks like a ceiling in an office building.  Business up top, party down below.  It's not even remotely important but once you notice it, it's kind of amusing. We selected the Baconfest appetizer to start - it was a bacon/escargot ragu served over some little pastries that remind me of small, creamy pot pies.  The bacon was cut into big chunks and had a delicious, smoky flavor.  It was a rustic flavor with an upscale presentation, and good for two people to share (three little pastry-pies each).  At this point, we waited about 15-20 minutes for our entree, which was a bit silly.  I didn't mind much since we'd already had our appetizer and I wasn't starving, but it would've been nice to have someone acknowledge the wait.  But we just listened to the music and chatted and drank our red wine.   My entree was the Goat Duo, and my boyfriend got the hangar steak.  Mine came with two chops of goat rack (like rack of lamb....only goat), and goat belly roulade.  Also garlic mashed potatoes, pickled vegetables, and some dark greens.  The meat was cooked very well - the question ""How do you like your goat prepared?"" was one I've never received before - medium-rare and juicy.  The meat on the chops was my favorite part.  I liked the flavor of the roulade, but the texture in some parts was a bit soft and fatty.  Mashed potatoes were great with a garlicky kick, there was plenty of goat jus to swirl everything in, and the greens added a needed touch of subtle bitterness to add bite to the other flavors.  My boyfriend's steak was also very good and well cooked; I particularly enjoyed the sunchokes and fabulous grilled asparagus on the side.  I've decided grilling is the only way I'm going to prepare asparagus from now on - it's that good. We split the peanut butter parfait for dessert - the ice cream was delicious with great peanut butter flavor, and the little candied peanuts were amazing.  The flourless chocolate cake was rich, but not too rich, but I left most of it for my boyfriend. It's not the cheapest night out, but I think everything is worth the price tag.  And if you go on Thursday, especially if you have a coupon, it becomes a real bargain!  We both felt Browntrout was a great neighborhood restaurant, we loved the live music, and the fact that the restaurant really feels like a part of the local community.  We plan to come back on a Sunday to hear the band again and try their fried chicken!",0.9992,0.799,0.186,0.016,0.5568634485757774

I have never been disappointed in what I have ordered (drink or food-wise), and the service is attentive without being overbearing.  The menu changes with the seasons, but there is always a great mix of menu items for every palate or dietary restriction. Some of my favorite have included the shaved pumpkin salad, the oysters, the po'boy, and really, any of the fish dishes. My friends have raved about the Patty Melt and the burger, and I constantly crave the fries, butterkase mac and cheese, and Brussel sprouts. In addition, the cocktails are inventive, and always tasty (and strong).  In addition to the food, Browntrout has started to have live bluegrass on Sunday (and now Thursday) nights- the band, The Dogpatch Ramblers, keeps guests' toes tapping and creates an awesome atmosphere and performance. The energy is electric, and the music draws you in.  Really- fried chicken, mac and cheese, good drinks, and bluegrass- what could be better?

First, the whole local / organic thing is really taken to heart - like, seedlings in the basement, plants on the roof in something like 12,000 lbs of soil. Chef / Owner Sean came out and talked about the menu, the ingredients, and his vision and plans for the restaurant. Excellent service. Excellent wine list which, for me, means finding some of my favorite wines (Louis LaTour, etc.) at reasonable-restaurant prices. The food - delicious. Smalls (appetizers) of truffle mushroom rissotto and the Baconfest Escargot. Bigs (entrees) of Goat Duo (my fav new ingredient) and Walleye with Polenta. Desserts of (some pile of various chocolates and cakes whose name escapes me) and a Creme Brulee (I can never really resist a creme brulee) that was paired with a sweet smoky scotch (I can REALLY never resist a dessert paired with scotch) that helped cut the intense richness of the creme.  And, oh yeah, what was that about the Wednesday night thing? Wednesday night is their Chef's tasting menu, which is not a paired down menu with only two choices for each course. It's the entire menu - literally the entire menu - one Small, one Big, and one Dessert, all for $35 / person. It's quite a haul, considering the variety and quality available from the full menu.

2012-04-04,5.0,"I went to brown trout a couple weeks ago when some friends were in town and wanted to do a nice dinner. I set it up for this place based on the recommendation of a friend of a friend. I have to say My guests and I were quite pleased. The two of them, both said the best meal of their life. I wouldn't go that far for me personally but it was definitely up there. When we got there I asked our server about their gin, and he said they only serve one kind and it is a craft local gin, so I gave it a shot and it was amazing. My new favorite. I also asked our server if they offered and sort of tasting menu, and he said they don't really do anything like that, but he would talk to the Chef and see if he wanted to do something like that. He came out with some menus from a five course dinner they had done just a few weeks ago for $60 and said that the chef would do that for us if we wanted, he would just have to change a few things because they were out of a couple ingredients. My guests and I went for the five course menu, an it was perfect, there were a couple minor issues with the food, but they were so insignificant it isn't even worth talking about. The portioning was perfect and everything was flavorful. In addition to the food the service was also excellent. Our server was very attentive without being over bearing, and you could also tell that as a workplace the people who worked there enjoyed their job and it was an atmosphere of fun, since you could buy the kitchen a six pack for $10 and our servers name on the receipt was big sexy. I ended up spending way more money that I had intended that night but that is completely my own fault and has nothing to do on the restaurants end, but it was completely worth it to discover Death's Door gin.

2012-03-29,4.0,"So, you've found that special someone, and you want to treat them to a luscious, savory entree which will wow them with your culinary acumen and skills behind the oven, and you whisper, ""let me woo you with rack of goat."" And then, you find yourself alone, the front door swinging in the breeze, wondering, ""what went so wrong, what did I say?""   I understand, ""rack of goat"" lacks the romance of ""rack of lamb"", but done right, as it is at Browntrout, it can be just as savory and fulfilling. Goat is an earthy, rich, sometimes gamy dish, which is not for the faint of heart, but, for the passionate, truly rich and satisfying.  The chefs at Browntrout have mastered this unruly animal in their goat three ways, although, between you and me, it should really be goat two ways, as I discuss below. Goat first way is two frenched chops of goat, cooked medium rare.  Quite similar in appearance to lamb chops (although they could have been frenched with a bit more aplomb), they had the similar meaty, mildly creamy taste.  For some reason, the chef garnished the chops with mint-esque microgreens, which were unnecessary.  The meat, a juicy medium rare, contained within itself all the necessary flavor. Goat the second way was ground into ravioli, and was just as delicious - smoky, savory, and juicy flavors wrapped up tightly in fresh pasta.  I was served only three and they were perfect in flavor and quantity. Goat the third way was, in my opinion, wholly unnecessary - goat belly remolade.  Goat belly, like pork belly, is a modern restaurant trend wholly inexplicable to me - all fat, no flavor.  The presentation of the remolade evokes a sweet roll awaiting some kind of unholy icing - whether melted goat marrow (oh, that actually sounds good), or Sara Lee melted creme.  As to the flavor, it is simply too fatty and gelatinous for my particular taste.  But that is my complaint with any XXX belly dish as a whole.  If you love what I've just described, you'll be in heaven.  If you feel as I do, rest assured that the goat chops and ravioli are more than enough for a main course. Not to have the goat overshadow this entire review, I began with the escargot, which were served with bacon lardons, a rich burgundy sauce, and surprisingly rich leek rolls.  It was almost unbearably rich and earthy, and I loved each and every bite.  As if the goat was not savory enough, I was nearly knocked out from the first round!  It was delicious. As to the other intangibles, Browntrout is an enjoyable experience.  Service is friendly, and, if you visit on Thursday night, there is no corkage fee for BYOB; but, if you have bad luck with your aged Chateauneuf du Pape, as I did, they can bail you out with a delicious Cabernet Franc from the Loire Valley.  As far as cocktails are concerned, try their take on a Sazerac, which is tasty, but don't order bourbon or top shelf rye straight, the pours are small and the prices are stiff.",0.9986,0.777,0.195,0.029,0.5970982142857141
2012-03-26,3.0,"first drinks - excellent! i had the sazerac inspired cocktail and this glorious burnt thyme concoction. i am not a vodka person at all but i was drawn in and i'm glad i was.  onto the food.  charcuterie was pretty good. the pâté de campagne was warm which was interesting. the rillette and chicken liver were tasty enough though nothing special.  my app was the tuna. very pretty 6 small pieces of tuna. the 2 pieces in the middle were delicious but the 2 pieces on either outside were so salty it burnt my tongue a bit.  for my entree i had the pork porterhouse. the flavor of the pork was wonderful. the top loin portion was perfectly cooked mildly pink however the loin portion was very very rare. the sauerkraut accompanying was tasty but the lentils and bread pudding were as bland as can be.  for desert i did the ice cream trio. the plate choice was a bad one as the 3 bowls of ice cream wobbled about as i tried eating. i had to move them onto the bar to put a spoon through. the whiskey one was good. the brown butter good. the marscapone was out of control! the flavor and texture were unexpected and the best part of the meal aside from the cocktails.  we had chosen to sit at the bar due to their website saying  ""Every NightJoin us for Happy Hours at our Bar! Dine at our Bar and recieve 30% off your total bill of all drinks and food"". we ended up having to ask our poor bartender (who was excellent and is also the pastry chef) who knew nothing about it and had to go ask the owner. long story short he gave the discount but i'll be keeping an eye to make sure the original charges are reversed on my card. incidentally as of today it is still offered on the website.  all in all it was okay. i work in the area and rarely go out to dinner in this part of town and if i were up here i might choose browntrout again but i certainly wouldn't make a trip for it and probably wouldn't stick around after work for dinner either.",0.9969,0.772,0.194,0.034,0.6668441938178781

I do suggest stopping by on Sunday nights for some fun acoustic blue grass and buttermilk fried chicken.  The service was fantastic at both visits. The owner duo and service staff are kind and professional. On a Friday evening visit, we sat very close to closing time. They treated with kindness and patience. We never felt rushed. The owner, Nadia, even made a point to say hello.  Browntrout also has amazing weekly features on wine and beverage and a great corkage program.

My friend and I started with a sampling tour this time. We tried... the oysters - great picks that came with something like a light ponzu sauce that made me rethink my old horseradish standard three cheeses - local picks that are probably selected when available, but all were not the usual suspects. The ricotta that was in, paired with some candied honey goodness, was wonderful. escargot - again, a unique take on an item I really like and I was wowed by the new idea beet salad - great flavors with a light dressing and chunks of blue cheese frites - a great standard, but with a side of mustard seed dip and a rich cheesy pot of yummy side of brussel sprouts - I can't live without these baby cabbages and these were great For drinks... I've been hooked on Old Fashions lately and, as this one comes over smoked ice and is garnished with tart little kumquats, I don't know how I will be satisfied with any 'ole attempt ever again. My friend got the house whiskey/ginger which was also quite tasty! It did seem like there is a lot of pride and passion for the food here. The place is unpretentious and comfortable, the service nice and well-paced, and what we tried showed off the main item with wonderfully flavorful, good-ideas.

I came for dinner with two other people on a Friday night. On the plus side, we had a reservation, but I doubt we needed it. It wasn't terribly crowded. I had the pan-seared Makinaw trout, which came with wild rice risotto, Brussels sprouts, chestnuts, brown butter cream, sage, and crispy wild rice. I thought everything about this meal was pretty tasty except for the rice, which had an odd sweet flavor that I didn't really care for. My boyfriend had the lamb shoulder and pasta dish, which he said was terrible. My other friend had the burger. He said it too was unimpressive although the fries were good. For dessert, two of us had the apple cake and the third person had the creamsicle. I thought the apple cake was really bland and had a bizarre spongy texture. The whiskey ice cream it came with was surprisingly good, however. My boyfriend said the creamsicle was only so-so. Considering that this place was only half-full, the service was extremely slow. We arrived shortly after 7 and did not get out of there until about 8:45. I never thought we would be eating for over an hour and a half. The food itself took a very long time to arrive, and the server was pretty slow in coming to our table as well. Considering that this place is not exactly cheap, I doubt I'll be back anytime soon.

The decor is modern fishing lodge, but the music was techno/house, which grew increasingly annoying as we were trying to eat. Our waitress was ok, but not the best service I've ever had -- just average. She accidentally put my dad's order in wrong, so he had to wait while they re-fired, but it came out pretty quickly, and she left the dish she brought by accident so he could nibble on that while he waited. The food was lackluster; so much so that I'm not even going to describe it for you, and none of us felt the need to even look at the dessert menu.

To start, we shared the steelhead tartar and werp farms greens.  Both tasted super fresh and the flavors were layered expertly.  The tartar was light and clean, with a hint of spicy mustard (I think.) and the salad was light, with a creamy kick from the local feta.  Both fish dishes looked amazing and our waiter gave us a double thumbs up, so we decided to share both.  I had the steelehead, accompanied by:   wild mushrooms, cauliflower, grilled romaine golden raisin, pine nuts, sardine lemon dill vinaigrette.  It was like a symphony in my mouth...and screamed Autumn/Winter!  As for my friend, he ordered the rich, buttery fish (name escaped me), with an Asian twist.  Again, the dish sang and I would have licked both plates if there were not other customers around!

The complimentary corn fritters were addictive and not greasy. 3. The steak had wonderful seasoning. Cons: 1. Our waiter was weird. Not weird in the fun corky way that I like, but weird as though he picked the wrong profession. 2. Our knives for the steak were dull as hell, but the steak wasn't tough! This is 100% our fault for not saying anything. I'm kicking myself for it.  3. The risotto small plate we ordered was CRUNCHY! In Top Chef, no one can ever get risotto right, and they did not at all! We kept wondering if it was supposed to be like that--some new technique, but decided after we ate it that risotto is risotto and it should NOT be crunchy. However, the bacon mixed within was tasty.  4. The dessert was expensive, so we went up the street to Fork for a better and more lively atmosphere.

I admire their sustainable philosophy: they have a rooftop garden where they grow produce (someone asked where the mushrooms were from, she said ""umm, upstairs?"", I think they meant originally, but it was interesting to hear), and they feature a list of their suppliers, mostly in IL, WI and MI.  We started with cocktails. They were out of basil so we couldn't get the basil fizz (bummer), so we got the watermelon/lime/cilantro drink (it's heavy on the cilantro, my friend really enjoyed it) and the ""Violet Beauregarde"" (I was intrigued by the name, but the combination of vanilla and blueberries made it taste too much like perfume). Both drinks were filled with a garden of leaves and smashed fruit. The result was too much work that ended in a mouthful of vegetation.  Stick with wine or beer (Thursdays are BYOB with no corkage).  For apps we got the mussels (good, not great) and carbonara. I highly, highly recommend the carbonara. It has huge hunks of bacon/lamb in a rich (very bad for you, but oh so good) cream sauce. It was definitely the highlight of my meal!  My friend ordered the crispy vegetable napoleon which was essentially roasted vegetables in a puff pastry. There was a nice smokey taste to the dish, it was very good. There was a delicious oregano pesto on the side, very unique. I got the rib-eye. I'll be honest, I ordered it because it came with an escargot/mushroom tart, which was really what I was after. Everything tasted good, was flavorful, but was not very memorable. The steak was a little undercooked from what I ordered, but not enough to complain. We passed on dessert.  Overall, it was good, but certainly not Bib Gourmand good.  I like to support local places, so I recommend trying it.",0.9982,0.726,0.253,0.02,0.6022742943331181

Pappardella with goat, peas & currants was awesome, as was grilled octopus. I liked burgundy snails accompanied by leek strudel and lardons -- very indulgent.

I went in for dinner with my boyfriend and his folks for their anniversary. Being cheapskates we obviously went in for Thursday BYOB--a bottle of prosecco and a nice Italian red. We had a great server (Ashley) who provided appropriate glasses for each beverage, and bubbly water, which was nice. And there was no corkage fee.  Highlights included: east-coast oysters (so good the excellent condiments--hot sauce and lime sorbet--went ignored for the most part); mushroom and truffle risotto, which was top-notch; escargot with home-made bacon (greasy and delicious!). Their quinoa-balls hit the spot too (and are fun to say)... Dessert was perhaps a meal in and of itself; orange panna cotta, ice-cream, home-made pralines, the works. Dee-lish. So, for those sticklers out there, this place made the cut on all fronts: nicely decorated; natural, muted lights (so people can't see your lips turn purple on BYO night); nice crowd of people, but not too loud. The service was top notch, and all the staff was friendly and attentive.  Everything in the joint is home-made--they churn their own butter for heaven's sake.

2011-04-03,3.0,"Went there last night with my wife and we ordered 5 of their ""smalls"" and dessert.  I'll break down the experience individually (I'm kinda a foodie geek so forgive me in advance)... Ambiance (I give it an A): Love the decor of the place... has a real good vibe to it and I think they did a great job picking out their glassware. I know it sounds strange to focus on a detail like that but the fact that they focused on a detail like that is awesome. Water service (I give it an A+) : OK... another obscure random detail but I loved this... they have their own in-house filtration system and they bottle their own water. You get your choice of sparkling or flat from this system - gratis. AWESOME!!! Great for the environment and it's great water. Bread service (I give it a B+): Bread was awesome...  Overall service (I give it a C): Started of really bad. They had no record of my reservation, gave me some song and dance about how I booked it but they recovered really, really quickly (kudos to the manager). They told us that they would check into it, asked us if we would mind waiting at the bar (figured that was the kiss of death for the evening) and before we could even order a drink they had our table ready. BRAVO. Totally saved the welcome experience. Rest of the service was OK... a little sloppy. The waitress forgot to put in our order of oysters which we placed with our first drink order, and there were several points where we didn't have utensils and, since we split a bunch of sides, would have expected that they would have split the dishes for us. Instead, they came out on one plate each and we had a stack of smaller plates brought to the table. Eh... a little bush league. Cocktails (I give it a B): They have some really great sounding cocktails on the menu and the bartender who was there definitely seemed to be on his game. Seemed really into mixology and was whipping up some interesting cocktails. That said, I ordered an Old Fashioned. Figured, ""Hey, this guy is making some crazy off the wall stuff, gotta imagine he can make a killer classic."" It was woefully imbalanced. I felt like I got a JD on the rocks with an orange slice and a cherry. Wine list was reasonably priced. Got some of their pairings which were matched reasonably well... wasn't crazy about the reds they selected. The white's rocked. Also didn't understand how they matched some of the wines to some of the dishes. Menu design (I give it a C): This is, to me, the Achilles heel of this place. We got 5 of their ""smalls"" because, quite frankly, little on their ""bigs"" menu seemed interesting to us. There were a total of 6 - 8 main course selection and I would say that 60 - 70% were red meat based. Several felt like they stepped right on top of each other from a flavor profile and just wasn't that inspired. I know they say their menu changes often but I left this place feeling like I've tried everything on there that I'd want to, and as a result, they haven't left me wanting to come back for more. Food quality (I give it a B-):  Oysters (B): Oysters themselves were really good, the way they sauce they came with was eh. Sweetbreads (A): Really nice... enjoyed this dish quite a bit. Octopus (C): It was average at best. Wasn't good, wasn't bad. Nothing memorable about it at all. Wild Mushroom Risotto (A): Killer, I would have taken 3 orders of this stuff. Best dish we had. Beet salad (C-): Same deal as with the octopus except it was even less memorable. Dessert (D-): I can't remember what it was called but it seemed to be a chocolate custard served with two peanut/peanut butter cookies on the side. Custard was good, not great. The cookies were hard as a rock and totally inedible. Ruined the dessert quite frankly.  Well there you have it... the last three, being the most important, drove my star rating. I think that on the right night, this place would be killer and I'll probably give it another shot but it's just not going to be top on my list.",0.9974,0.768,0.161,0.071,0.5125778581474784
2011-03-31,5.0,"I stumbled upon Brown Trout as a tired and lost out-of-towner who was looking for a place to get a great meal.  So you can imagine that when I walked inside its clean, classic and unpretentious atmosphere with dimly lit candles and polished wooden furnishings, I was glad to see the hostess greet me with all the pleasantness and warmth which my tired self would have liked.  I had a really great glass of Spanish sparkling rose to start that was reasonably priced.  The bread which accompanied the meal was freshly baked and served with a flavorful freshly prepared butter.  The wild mushroom risotto, which I had to start, was delicious.  The risotto was creamy and soothing, like a risotto should be, and I found the mild bite of the Italian parsley and pungency of the wild mushrooms to be well balanced.  The grilled trout was perfectly grilled and its flesh was both meaty and flavorful.  The sauce which accompanied it was delicate and its marinade had just the right amount of acidity and did not overwhelm the true flavor of the fish.  The thinly-sliced tuber cake which also accompanied the dish was buttery and had the right amount of sage seasoning to it.  Its presentation, which was almost like a pastry cake because of the way the tubers had been thinly sliced was really creative.  The pea shoots were also a nice palate cleanser for the other heartier ingredients.  And all the ingredients were great, you could really taste the freshness.    Now the restaurant's schtick is about using fresh, local, sustainable ingredients.   As someone who really feels strongly about eating organic and locally, the food here for me really represented the culmination of what you can accomplish if you do just that.  There was no gimmick of giving you the local ingredients without any attention paid to its composition, sort of like a smorgasbord of simple but fresh ingredients like so many restaurants are seemingly into these days that leave you to satisfy your real palate with heady notions of flavonoids and fatty acids, but at the same time it avoided overwhelming the palate with overly decadent flavors like one might experience at any other standard high-end restaurant.    I really got the sense that I was eating something healthful and wholesome, but still amazing and was impressed by the creation of it.  Overall, the food was great, well-balanced, had a great attention to detail that really showed, and was really satisfying.  My previously tired self left with a smile.  And, in the end, both mind and palate were satisfied.",0.997,0.762,0.203,0.036,0.5170096852300242
2011-03-27,3.0,"This place was fine.  Kind of like a lot of the establishments down Lincoln Ave. in Lincoln Square.  The ingredients and preparations were undoubtedly fresh, but things often came off as too salty or not balanced in an impressive way.  If everything was about $10 cheaper than I would consider this a real find-- instead it feels like some overpriced fine dining restaurant at a resort town on the Michigan coast.   I will say that the burger though was incredible.  I was wondering if getting it as my entree would be sort of cheap at a place like this but the waitress said that it was popular there, and I didn't want to be stuck with an overpriced steak that was so-so.  I guessed right and would definitely come back to this place for the burger.  It was just I had hoped it would be-- an unhealthy, fat-soaked hunk of meat sandwiched between two soft pieces of brioche and easy to eat.  It did not fall apart all over my hands after each bite.  It was so dark in the restaurant that I couldn't really tell what was in it, but I remember reading ""oxtail"" and ""marrow"" and figured you couldn't lose with that combo.  Probably the best burger I've had in my time in Chicago. As an appetizer we ordered the frites with fondue and some other sauces-- I was getting fries with my burger but I wanted my fiancee to be able to have a bunch of them as well.  The fries were not perfectly done, slightly undercooked and not crispy like I would have liked.  The gruyere fondue it came with was too stringy in that when you dipped it you would drag along with you a huge strand of cheese that was hard to cut off.  The chipotle ketchup was average, but the mustard aioli (or whatever it was) was the best complement.   We both got salads.  Hers was something with beets and a citrus-y dressing and was the better of the two.  I got some arugula and ""lardons"" which tasted essentially like three small tips of ham and was really disappointing.  I wanted something crunchy and fatty but this was the opposite.  What pissed me off is that each salad was about $10-11 and I'm guessing it cost about $2 to make each one of them.  I think if they were $7-8 I wouldn't have been as irritated. My fiancee's entree was the vegetarian one- some kind of quinoa ricotta cake with some fancy presentations on the plate.  It was delicious, even though we weren't really sure what we were eating.  Our server was super sweet and nice but I wish she would've taken more time to describe everything we were eating.  It was so dark that it was hard to tell.   For dessert she got the Orange Dream which was an attractively decorated plate of little orange bites here and there.  I thought it was pretty to look at and sort of a new experience for me.  I enjoyed the custardy blobs.  This was more fun to ""walk through"" than it was delicious but I enjoyed it. Overall, I'm really glad we had an Open Table coupon for this place.  We had been eyeing it for a long while and are glad to have gone though I'm not sure we'll be back.  Maybe for the burger.  Otherwise we'll just cook the rest of the stuff at home.  If you're a yuppy that thinks they know about really fine dining you will probably love it, as there were a lot of annoying account director-looking people and housewife 2.0s there enjoying time away from the kids.  They probably have no problem affording this place.  I'll stick to my $30-for-two dinners.",0.9984,0.739,0.191,0.07,0.5746524959415583

The pot pie was quite good and tasty at the beginning when the pastry was there on top.  By the end, the lamb stew was very salty and heavy, and more breading was needed to compliment.   Overall, a nice finer dining place on Lincoln, with easy street parking on a Sunday anyway.",0.99,0.814,0.186,0.0,0.6064912280701754

It's fabulous color scheme, gorgeous tapestried lighting and relaxed manner, make it both romantic and kid friendly, conducive to intimate conversations and a great cocktail. The chef/owner is extremely gifted and this coming from somebody that does not even eat, the namesake and his piece de resistance, fish! His French fries are some of the best you will ever taste, love the housemade chipotle ketchup, mustard aioli and goat cheese fondue. His mushroom truffled risotto  is heavenly. Even the bread and butter are housemade, and extemely addictive. This restaurant is superb for vegetarians, their quinoa fritters with sunchoke sauce make you forget that you are eating something healthy in the least as they melt in your mouth. Of course I continually hear that the fish, right now the Tile fish (at only $25 it's a steal!) , is the best he's ever had!  The meat, currently ribeye, lamb and pork chop, is of an exceptional quality and flavor using local, sustainable and health/conscious local farmers. Everything about this restaurant screams quality and yet without the pricetag as the chef is not in it for the greed or clout and wants to be able to share his gift with those who do not have the Mastro's, Tru & Alinea weekly expense accounts, but to me the chef is equally if not more so, gifted! His desserts are divine and inventive the milk chocolate pot de creme with peanut butter cookies,and the best whip cream, chocolate soufflé with eggnog creme anglaise (Callebaut of course), mandarin orange panna cotta deconstructred with homemade fudge and amazing sauces! The man is a food genius and still no ego! The staff is all as sweet, knowledgeable and attentive as can be, if not unusually model attractive. They have free purified water either still or sparkling that is constantly being refilled, and are like a superb host that has given every consideration! Their manager is a mensch even to my demanding Jewish high maintenance parents.;) Of course they have amazing drinks, wine, and of the non-alcohol variety think homemade gingerale! This restaurant is a labor of love and I suggest you partake of this love as fast as you can & as much as you can. If you're lucky enough you might even catch wind of the romantic tale from the chef of how this restaurant came to be and the two fruitions of it, baby in tow. Trust me your stomache, if not always your personal trainer, will thank you! And the French press coffee is amazing, with the creamer, sugar holder and silverware being pieces of art and conversation starters! Support your local food genius without killing your monetary resources/wallet!  Also FYI the one day they're closed is Tuesday. The menu is based on local, sustainable organic farmers of the highest caliber, so as such it changes seasonally based on availability and G-d is it worth it! One bight of the praline, whip cream, brown butter ice cream concoction and you'll taste that the finest organic dairys around really make the difference to creating the finest of desserts!",0.9987,0.779,0.199,0.022,0.5654889455782313
2011-03-09,3.0,"Browntrout has been on my radar for a long time, and it only made its way higher on my list with Chicago Magazine best new restaurant 2010 and the recently announced  Michelin Guide Bib Gourmand award. We decided to check it out on a Wednesday night when they offer make your own three course meals for $35. However, even after the good value and great service, I felt the food did not live up to all the awards. Everything we had was good, but nothing ever crossed into ""great"" territory. Don't get me wrong, it performed well across the board and was consistent throughout. I appreciate the sustainable food mission, the inviting decor and good drink list, however I just wasn't wooed by the food overall. We started with french fries and mushroom risotto. The fries are served with melted cheese ""fondue"", house made ketchup and mustard. It's a large portion and hard to stop eating. The ketchup was my preferred sauce. Erica did most of the work on the risotto (and liked it) since I'm not a huge mushroom fan, though I thought it lacked flavor (outside of the truffles) and missed the great risotto consistency.  Our main courses was a mix of surf and turf, Erica ordered a steak and I went with fish (I'm blanking on what kind and it changes frequently). My fish was fine, like the rest of our meal, tasty enough but nothing special. Erica's meat was better and quite good. Each dish came with roasted vegetables and a nice sauce.  Finally, we ended our meal with a chocolate mouse like dessert served with peanut butter cookies. I wasn't expecting the chocolate so chocolaty (not their fault) but the cookies and caramel were very good.  Our drinks all night were good and fun and our service was great. Even with the prix fixe option, I was a bit surprised our bill topped $110 all in. If I sounded a bit harsh at first it is more a reflection of expectations not met. I think the concept and service at Browntrout is solid and dependable, though the food is not exceptional. I'm a little confused on the value (especially with Michelin), but it does make a nice neighborhood family spot for meals out.",0.9972,0.734,0.217,0.049,0.5852683080808081
2011-03-02,4.0,"I, like Molly & Andy found that I was pleasantly surprised by Browntrout but was not wowed. It's just when you found something really great, you would find something not so good. When it's all evened out you still get four stars and a nice welcome to a much needed restaurant addition in North Center.  Browntrout might not be fine dining but it is definitely more upscale. I say this based on the decor, the menu, and the price. The decor is very elegant and charming. Dark rich colors and low lighting make a nice setting for a romantic dinner. The staff was very attentive (but then again it was a week night and only a few tables), water refill ever so often and a few check ins from the waiter. He also made great recommendations on wine and side dishes.  The ever changing menu (which is not the current menu online) was packed full of meats and fish which really was disconcerting for someone who doesn't eat those items. No chicken dish and only one vegetarian meal that didn't look to appetizing. Is what it is so we went with the following... Arugula Salad -yeah, it's a salad, dressing was nice though Werp Farm Greens -date's salad, again just a salad  Frites & Gruyere -Not bad at all, fresh cut potatoes and massive portion Small Wild Mushroom Risotto -Absolutely brilliant Wild Steelhead -I did have a very small portion and this fish (much like Salmon) was cooked and season perfectly. I mean it just fell apart and the sear was crunchy and salty... amazing.  2 glasses of wine and a JK Scumpy cider   Not a lot of food but the bill was slightly over a hundred. My one cider even though it's in a big glass was $15, that's crazy. Anyways, we are getting towards the end of meal when I notice it's getting really smokey.

2011-02-16,5.0,"I've had a great experience both times I've dined here. Nice atmosphere, food was excellent, and service was fantastic. But the real reason Browntrout made the leap from 4 to 5 stars for me, is the second time I dined here it was with my parents. They live in a small town in MN and their typical dining out options are chain restaurants or places that serve burgers and fried chicken/fish/seafood. And they rarely spend more then $30 for the two of them to eat out (with tip!). So I thought, let's try Browntrout. I knew they would find the food 'fancy' and expensive but I had planned to just pay the bill and let them enjoy the food without worrying about the price. But here's where the push to 5 stars came in. At the end of the meal, my dad grabbed the check to pay and didn't complain one bit about the over $100 tab. He & my mom both said the food was so good, they'd had dishes unlike anything they are used to, and they really enjoyed the whole experience. The fact that my dad was willing to foot the bill without a single complaint told me that this place was something special and deserved of that elusive 5th star!! I've read through a lot of the reviews that complain about spotty service but both times I've dined in I've had excellent service. The server was attentive, helpful with menu suggestions, quick with offering a drink refill when my wine glass started getting empty, and the water glasses were always full. Perhaps it has to do with timing though. Both times I've had reservations earlier then the dining rush (5 p.m and 6 p.m.) so maybe later on when it gets really busy the service slips a little. IMO though, it's been on point. The food is really the draw here though. The menu changes daily it seems and they are committed to buying organic, local and environmentally sustainable ingredients whenever possible (and I think that's reflected in the quality of the food). The first time I ate there my friend & I started with the frites with the stellar dipping sauces and a wonderful salad. Then we split the gnocchi and their fish special of the day. OMG, the gnocchi was to die for. It was one of the best gnocchi's I've ever had. It just melted on your tongue the second you put it in your mouth. I was disappointed to see it wasn't on the menu the second time I was there, but I understand the menu is forever changing, *le sigh*. The fish was also really good although after the standout gnocchi dish, it's hard to remember much about it. The second time I was there my parents & I split the frites again (seriously, the sauces are so good!), a salad and the fried smelt. None of us cared for the smelt all that much. I think it's more that we just don't like that particular fish then it wasn't cooked properly though. For entrees we split the steelhead and this quinoa dish. The fish was perfectly seared and had a great sauce with it, along with some delicious mushrooms on the side. The quinoa dish was the standout for me though. It was served like falafel and there was a great smokey cheese fondue sauce served with it. It was just a really interesting presentation and the flavors worked so well together. For dessert we split to made to order chocolate souffle which was also yummy. This is definitely one of my favorite restaurants and I will be back often to check out the changing menu. Also, it's BYOB with no corkage fee on Thursday - so take advantage. It's so worth it!!",0.9987,0.789,0.176,0.035,0.4980357142857144
2011-02-14,3.0,"Browntrout is a welcome addition to the burgeoning restaurant scene in that stretch of Lincoln Avenue. For apps, Smoked Wild Steelhead & Crispy Smelt, with Capers, Arugula, Citrus, and Sauce Gribiche.  This fish duo, it didn't seem like there is necessarily a link between the two.  But it's both delicious.  Very mild cured steelhead, kicked up with pickled red onions.  Delicious fried smelt.  Fried lemon slices are common in a fritto misto, but the orange slices were a nice surprise.  Also had the Red Wine Barley Risotto, with Braised Pinn Oak Lamb Neck, Goat Butter, Onion Jam, Parmesan, Rosemary.  Totally decadent.  The lamb was cooked down like ropa vieja, spread all over the plate, with the barley sort of embedded on the meat. For mains, Wild Steelhead, Beluga Lentils, Wild Mushrooms, Steelhead Lardon, Truffled Celery Root, Vin Blanc.  A perfect piece of seared fish.  Mushrooms are big right now for any place making seasonal focused food.  So I'm in hog heaven.  We also had the Cassoulet, which was with a lot of the Pinn Oak lamb.  Again, a totally decadent dish. To round things out, a Blaunfrankish from Circa estate in Leelanau, Michigan.  I've not had much opportunity to taste Michigan reds, although it is getting a lot of attention these days.  Glad I had a chance to sample.  It is a medium red, which worked beautifully with both the luscious steelhead, and the luscious lamb. A few quips and notes.  The small area (tiny, maybe 3x3 at most) between the outer and inner doors is an awkward, inclined, tiled space.  Could be a potential hazzard in these snowy, slippery days.  A lot of people jump to the idea that this is a seafood restaurant given the name.  Don't be disappointed by that, just have to change your expectation.    Why 3 stars?  Great neighborhood restaurant.  Unpretentious, great staff.  If I live in the area, this could be a regular haunt.",0.9915,0.815,0.148,0.037,0.564805511948369

Ambiance: I really liked the dark purple on the walls, the chalkboard, and nice modern chic chandeliers.  The look was a bit unfinished since the ceiling is still white panels which doesn't fit as well with the rest of the decor. Food:  We expected there to be a nice selection of fish on the menu, but for the mains there was only one option (steelhead).  Furthermore, when we looked at the menu we had trouble deciding what to get because nothing looked overwhelmingly mouthwatering.  My husband ended up with the chicken, while I ordered the quinoa balls (a vegetarian dish).  We found the dishes ok, but a bland in terms of flavors.  Still feeling hungry after an appetizer and two mains between us, we ordered two desserts.  The butterscotch dessert had an odd spongy substance in it that we didn't care for, and the chocolate souffle with egg nog creme was tasty but was very small (~2 in. diameter). Service:  Our server was friendly and able to explain different items on the menu which was nice.  However, we were surprised that she brought our check to the table as we took the first bite of dessert.  We were on a ""date night"" and not in a rush, nor was the restaurant busy, so I was unclear why the check was brought so early.",0.8165,0.836,0.105,0.059,0.5639964157706093

I want to take her with me every time I dine out.  The menu is principally divided between ""Small Plates"" and ""Big Plates"". As we are used to small plates being... well, small... Boyfriend and I ordered two: the frites and the snails. The frites arrived first and the dish was enormous. Seriously - more than enough fries for two people. They came with house ketchup, Gruyere fondue, and mustard aioli. All three sauces were incredible, but I was particularly drawn to the smoky flavor of the house ketchup.  We left the fries unfinished (an offense that can get your American citizenship revoked in certain states), and turned our attention to the snails. As a faux-Frenchy, I know my way around escargot, and these were quite impressive. They are served with bacon and fried leeks; flavors that could get anyone excited about eating snails. I believe Boyfriend and I were silent for several minutes as we focused solely on the amazing food before us. As I engaged in a private lovefest with my leek I was tempted to stop random servers and busboys and offer them bites - when things are that ridiculously good, you just want to share with everyone you encounter.  After these impressive appetizers, the bar was set high for the entrees.  I had the duck. It came served on a bed of corn risotto that was, quite simply, one of the best things I'd ever eaten. The plate was garnished with pickled cherries and arugula which together offset the sweetness of the corn. I offered several bites to Boyfriend and savored the rest.  Now, duck. I'm almost hesitant to mention the duck because... well, I've recently learned that I don't really like duck. This is, obviously, not Browntrout's fault. Why did I order it if I don't like it? Well... I wanted to give it the old college try before completely removing it from my culinary range. We're done now - no more duck.  We finished the night with the pumpkin mousse. It's autumn now and I'm utterly mad for all things pumpkin.

Service: There was a guy server roaming around at all the tables around us, and he was clearly awesome.  Knowledgeable, friendly, offered his opinions on what to order.  We got: perhaps the bartender?  Who basically took our order and didn't offer any fancy input.  I was disappointed.

We were stuck in traffic for 45 minutes for this?  We ended up being in and out of this place in under an hour.  I wanted an experience.  I didn't get one.  I dressed up for the evening.   The food: mediocre.  The best of the evening: snails.  They were really nice and flavorful.  However, the accompaniments were luke warm.  The duck egg salad.... don't expect an egg on a plate.  Expect small slices of hard boiled egg peek a boo-ing out of the salad.  The pomme frites: unmemorable.  Ok at best.  At least they were filling though.  I'm glad I ordered them.  So, we thought, ""Well, the entree should be awesome, right?""   I ordered the pork loin.  The server recommended medium rare.  What we received had no pink whatsoever.  My knife didn't want to cut it.  It was the toughest, chewiest piece of meat I've had in a long time.  I actually felt sorry for the animal that was killed for that meal.  His life was wasted.  I hope he was allowed to run freely in fields and eat bugs galore.

2010-09-10,4.0,"I have been sizing up Browntrout for a while to do with one of my wine groups to take advantage of their zero corkage night, but a friend beat me to it and arranged a dinner for last night.  The biggest surprise of it all is that we were all on time, thus pretty much ensuring that this was gonna be a very good night. We had a lot of pinot in front of us, so food was needed or else the CPD would be a lot more happy in a few hours (and of course we'd all be a lot less happy) With there being 8 of us, we decided to just go ahead and order 4 different appetizers but order two of each. We got the lamb risotto, mussels, snails, and papardelle. I didn't get a chance and the papardelle, but the risotto was easily the best of the appetizers that I had, but close behind were the mussels which had some real good peppers mixed in that added a ton of flavor. The snails were excellent too and had some really tasty bacon chunks in there to make the snails go down easier.  From there I moved onto the alaskan salmon. I mean, c'mon, I have a whole lot of pinot in front of me, how on earth am I not gonna have salmon, it goes together like peas and carrots. The salmon was cooked absolutely perfectly and was easy to pull apart with my fork. The service was absolutely spot on and were extremely helpful. They checked in on us a decent bit, but it never felt overdone or forced. The inside itself was a bit too modern in a sense as it didn't really feel all that warm inside just looking at it. The food also came at a slower pace which is fine by me and works for a group our size, but I could see how that could be a problem with people who aren't used to slower dinners or want to do multiple things in a night. What was nice though is that there was a decent amount of people once 8-8:30 hit as when I had gotten there around 7 it was basically our group and another couple off in a corner.  The best part about browntrout was the price for it all. It ended up being $45 per person including a generous tip. We didn't have desert which obviously would've made things slightly more expensive, but its nice to come across places like this where you can get some serious quality food at a very reasonable price",0.9979,0.785,0.192,0.023,0.5796597222222223

Well, how can you say no to that!  So I was sneaky and just told Andy ""hey, we are going out.""  ""where?""  ""no matter, just let's go."" Even though he had a slight look of terror when we first came in, the menu highlighting many entrees that were not fish quickly won him over. The waiter we had was nice, except he said right off the bat ""well, our ingredients are organic so it is a longer wait for the food to come out here.""  Which was fine, but what the heck does organic ingredients have to do with a longer wait?   Anyway. I ordered a house made ginger ale, which was fabulous and I must learn how to do this at home immediately. Take it and stuff it, Canada Dry, this stuff kicked your ass all around the block.  We then ordered the pommes frites, which came with a tiny bowl of ketchup, a horseradish mustard, and the fave, a gruyere fondue.  We were fighting over the last bits of that I can assure you. The frites were easily the best fried potatoes I have ever had in my life.  I will gladly come back and order these until they eventually kill me, haha. Then we tried the lamb risotto appetizer.  The risotto was oddly coloured, sort of a reddish brown, but delicious. Big chunks of lamb nestled amongst perfectly creamy rice.  This is something they should offer as an entree, it is that good.   My entree was the pork tenderloin.  The meat was cooked excellently, but the zucchini/brussel sprout vegetable had a sweet cherry something-or-other relish mixed with it.  I like my vegetables on the plain side, and so this unusual added sweetness was the only disappointment.

Of course she lied, well sort of.   I could feel my blood boil and the back of my neck turn red as I walked into this snooty little bistro. I hate places like this. No bar, no ballgames on the Television and the bald guy who seated us had the personality of a rattle snake. The host literally  looked like a bad guy in Mobster flick and had a demeanor to match.   Our server though, was actually pretty nice. Although I was miffed when he explained to me that their food took longer to prepare because all the ingredients were organic. My question is why? Do they use organic oven's that use organic coal that are hand picked from the mines in West Virginia by organic miners?   To my dismay, the food was actually delightful. We started with a order of hand cut fries that were accompanied by a bunch of different dipping sauces. These may have been some of the best fries I ever tasted. The burger I ordered for my entree was juicy and delicious. Not on Par with Kuma's, but pretty damn good.   The highlight of the evening was the Bourbon that was topped off with their homemade Ginger ale. They accompanied each other beautifully. Bourbon and Ginger ale was the drink of choice of one of my favorite writers, Jack Kerouac. I tipped a few to Jack while enjoying my meal.   After my night at Browntrout, I came to the following conclusions. My wife is a sneak. Don't judge a book by it's cover and I hate it when  a place proves me wrong.

Gimme an f-in break.   If I could sue for Equal Protection of the laws on behalf of cheap, new wines every where, I certainly would.  Additionally, why would I want to go to a BYO that charges more to pop the cork off your bottle than it cost me to pick it up at the store? All you haters, don't go claiming that I'm some kind of wine idiot; I'm actually a level 2 sommelier, and I know that many good wines come in cheap price tags.   Browntrout's policy simply tells me that they want to gouge their clients.  Seriously, if you are going to charge this kind of corkage fee, then foot the bill for a liquor license (expensive, I know) and do all of the front-end work on purchasing the wine that actually justifies the increased cost that other restaurants up-charge when they list bottles on their wine lists for 2.5x the purchase price.

As soon as we sat down we knew we wanted drinks.  A yummy blackberry cocktail for my friend, and a glass of Pinot for me please! As we looked through the menu there were several appetizers we wanted to try.  An internal battle started going on in my head.  Do I want the asparagus soup or do I want the strawberry beat salad?  My friend interrupted my thoughts.  ""We are 30.  We can get more than one appetizer.  We can splurge!"" Okay, I like to note that I am still 29, but I agree with the sentiment! And splurge we did!  We both got the asparagus soup (served chilled) and the salad.    I have to say, the asparagus soup is the most delicious, satisfying soup I have ever had.  It is savory and light and oh my!  The strawberry/beat salad was good but not as amazing as the soup! We both ordered the trout for our entrée.  How can you go to a place called Brown Trout and not order their signature dish?  It would be a first time disgrace!  It was perfectly prepared and super yummy! For dessert we got the strawberry shortcake and decaf coffee served in a French Press- bonus! I also have to note that they have the most amazing crusty bread.

The server was very pleasant but obviously stretched and hurried in her duties. The person working the bar assisted once in a while when she was not playing with her hair behind the bar. The main course (steelhead salmon with polenta and morels) was executed perfectly. The salmon was cooked perfectly and skin crispy; I usually don't prefer the skin on, but it was delicious. The fallen chocolate souffle and butterscotch creme brulee were hits. Food scored high, but service slow and unorganized. The host wearing a crisp suit and tie, one server a white apron over jeans--acceptable, the other server no apron and appeared just sloppy and inappropriate for what this restaurant aims to be.",0.9645,0.858,0.098,0.043,0.5248765432098765

We shared several dishes and all were fantastic. The most memorable and unique dish was the Antelope Papperdelle (so darn tasty), and the risotto was the best I've ever had. We also had a few of the small plates (beets, olives) and dessert (chocolate souffle); all yummy.  The service was great and we really enjoyed meeting one of the owners--who stopped by our table a couple of times.

2010-03-12,3.0,"I read that Browntrout has a BYOB-no corkage fee-Thursday special. This seemed as good a day as any to finally try it out. I read that Browntrout did not have the smoothest of openings, but the reviews have been pretty solid since then.  I called around 4:00 to make sure of  the BYOB option, which was confirmed, and I asked if a reservation was necessary. She took our reservation for 6:30 and mentioned the early-ish time would be good since they had some large parties coming in.  When we arrived, we were the only ones there, so I think the kitchen was safe from being overwhelmed. We chose a cocktail first, I can't remember what it was called, but it was downright chuggable. Our server explained if we did not want to go the tasting menu-route, they prefer if we order our starters and entrees at the same time, as everything is made to order. Not unheard of, but it always seems like a weird request. No biggie though. We ran a few ideas by her since we had never been there. We were thinking of a few starters (which they call 'smalls') an entree, and a few sides, that way we could get a nice array of flavors. Our other thought was one 'small' and two 'bigs,' which is what they call their entrees. She suggested option two, maybe because it was, how shall we say, more expensive? We went with it, forgoing the frites, which sounded really yummy.  The hits:   1. The duck leg that came with my duck leg and antelope sausage. Perfectly cooked and nice crispy skin. 2. The aforementioned cocktail, a frothy mix of Hendrick's, in house made  ""4-Alive,"" cherries and sage. 3. Silly to say, but the bread and olive oil were top notch.  4. The specialty of the house trout was also perfectly cooked. A nice thin crust, and the beautiful piece of fish was also juicy and flaky. 5. The mussels were plentiful and with a fragrant coconut milk broth. (Could have used a little more bread to sop it up...Hopleaf has ruined us.) The pretty good's: 1. Sauteed spinach. Buttery. Who doesn't like that? 2. The white beans that came with the duck and sausage. Maybe a little too plentiful? 3. The brussels sprouts slaw, also with the duck. Pungent! A nice bite. 4. The antelope sausage, nice and thyme-y, but nothing really WOW. 5. The hash with the trout  was some great bacon.  The not-so-great: 1. The weird salad with the duck. There was A LOT going on with that dish. Unnecessary and too contrasting. 2. Can't remember what that green sauce was with the trout. Why can't I remember it? Oh, right. 3. The restaurant is sorta too...bright? It used to be a short-lived Mexican restaurant, and it's a big space. I think a dimmer and some candles, a little mood lighting, would warm the place up. Also the techno was a little much for 6:30. When we left they had switched the music to a little folksy band, much friendlier.  4. Dare I say, the cost? Don't want to sound like a cheapo, and the portions are certainly nice sized, but it felt a little high. It's NorthCenter, not exactly restaurant row. 5. I didn't have too much of an issue with this, but my husband HATED the ""We're a totally GREEN restaurant"" spiel. It's written on the menu and the walls, so I don't know if it's totally necessary to reinforce it, but I do understand this is the hip thing for the moment.  So it's good. Not really awesome. I think I would like to sit at the pretty bar and have mussels and some nice beers. Maybe split an entree if it's cool. Oh, and when I walked to the ladies room (which is lovely) I caught a good view of the considerably large kitchen and numerous cooks.

I already knew Browntrout did this from their website but was delighted to see firsthand that they execute the food so well. For starters we had the best beet salad I've ever had. I'm picky about beets because for me they can be cloyingly sweet and unappealing when served as big hunks. These were roasted and chopped into small tender pieces and accompanied with arugula, a generous amount of toasted hazelnuts (drool), blue cheese fondue, finely chopped pita chips, and moscato vinaigrette  It was an explosion of complementary flavors and a very generous portion. I'd go back just for it. We also had the Werp Farm Greens, which was actually a salad (I had expected warm or wilted greens) and done very well, if a little heavy on the salt. It was simple and fresh. Along with the starters we also indulged in the warm bread they bring to the table with little saucers they fill with fruity olive oil...cute, and sophisticated at once. For the entree I went with the namesake, herb roasted whole trout, and loved it. The fish was tender and meaty, and accompanied by a sweet and savory butter apple sauce and lovingly chopped and roasted root vegetables (or at very least, lovingly consumed!)  Sweet, savory, delicious. My date had the catfish which was great (though I preferred the trout) which was served with escarole and blackeyed peas with house cured bacon. I'm already fantasizing  a return trip for brunch to try that bacon again... Service was warm and attentive. One of the owners came by to check in on us and ask our opinion on the catfish since was a new menu item having it's debut that night.  All in all, a great place to treat yourself or loved ones.

Eh... not really. The restaurant has a big communal table in the middle of the room, which (LUCKILY) we weren't seated at. Instead, though, we ended up by the door on a freezing February night. The server started out strong: friendly, welcoming, and seemingly knowledgable. We ordered our drinks, apps, and entrees. The server did warn us that the entrees sometimes take a bit longer than other restaurants to come out of the kitchen because they prep each order as they come in to maintain as much freshness as possible.  Then the server totally checked out. Good. Bye. No ""would you like another cocktail?"" or ""how do you like your entrees?"" - nada. He just swooped in, cleared my plate (with food still on it), and dropped the check.  The quail was salty, salty, salty. Blech! The pork and sausage plate had no real recognizable sausage. Maybe they meant sausage-essence.  We weren't miserably unhappy, but we didn't have an experience that makes us want to return ever again.  Keep trying, Browntrout.

When we were finally seated, we were promptly served water and bread by a very friendly busboy.  The dinner was delicious!  We split the mussels, the trout, and the shrimp.  I enjoyed all three.  For dessert we had the fallen souffle and the taffy apple.  If I had to do it again, I would skip the apple, but the souffle was fantastic. I was pleased with the entire dinner, and I can't wait to go back on a Monday for 1/2 price wine night!   I do agree with another reviewer about the communal table in the middle of the restaurant.  It looks like a table you would see in a college cafeteria.  Plus, I hate communal tables.  If we had been seated there, we probably would have asked to wait for a different table.   Also, if you get a chance, check out their employees of the month sign.  It is quite funny.   This review is all over the place, but just to recap:  I highly recommend!",0.9796,0.831,0.141,0.028,0.6254444444444444
2010-02-14,1.0,"We went to Brown Trout for a special occasion, and had been wanting to try it for a while. I will start by saying that I left feeling like Brown Trout is one of many organic, expensive American, overrated offerings that seem to be sprouting up around the city. I love organic ingredients, and, being pregnant, I am excited when I know where my food comes from. However, the way in which this perfect food is put together is really all that matters.  When we were given our menus and explained the concept, we were told that bread would be out shortly. About 10 or 15 minutes later our waitress came to refill our water and said that the bread was on it's way out of the oven, which was odd because there were others who came after us who were served bread before us. We couldn't wait, however, for our fresh hot bread! We got it right away after this, and it wasn't ""out of the oven."" It was cold in on the edges and slightly warm outside. We got their standard olive oil, that they rationed for us. Since the chef's ego does not seem to allow for salt and pepper on the table, the olive oil was pretty boring.  We got the frites with a gruyere dip. Sounded great in theory. The fries were coated in lemon, which drowned out the potentially good flavor of high quality fries. The sauce was OK, a bit runny.  For my main course, I got the quail. I am a game fan, and I love getting duck or quail. BTW, the best use of duck that I have encountered is at The Stained Glass in Evanston. Anyway, the quail at Brown Trout was spongy, rubbery and tasteless. The au jus was good, but the fingerling potatoes that were touted on the menu amounted to maybe three tiny potatoes cut in half. My husband was unpleased as well.  We were seated near the door and we were quite cold. We were also served by a nervous-seeming house manager/waitress, who really piled on the charm when she gave us the check.  We ended up spending $76 for two entrees, an appetizer and a nonalcoholic drink. The weekend before we had gone to the awesome Trattoria Trullo further north on Lincoln and paid $55 for two fantastic entrees, a non-alcoholic drink and dessert. We also got an amiable, unpretentious dining experience. Save your money and go to a place that uses fresh ingredients well. This is not the place.",0.9918,0.843,0.132,0.025,0.5165986394557822

On a positive note... the bread basket was PHENOMENAL and the highlight of my meal.  And I'm not one to toot my own horn, but I do know a thing or two about bread baskets... (ok fine, I'm never going take the time to review Pete Miller's, so I might as well just say it now - their bread is ahhhhmazing).  Browntrout gives you a teeny-tiny serving with a GI-normous plate of dipping oil (one oil plate per diner b/c apparently everyone should have bread with their oil...), but just ask for a refill after you scarf down all the bread and their kind servers will expedite it right away. Speaking of the service, the peeps at Browntrout are nice.  They try hard.  They care.  They know their menu.  I think they actually want to succeed and see you again.  But when you add everything up, there's just no reason to go back.  There's no atmosphere there and the food is just okay.  3 stars is pretty accurate.   Oh wait, there are two more pieces of goodness I can't forget ::  1) ask for hot sauce and they bring a teeny tiny ramekin of sriracha.  thumbs up.  2) they have kobacha squash on the menu.  unfortunately, it's on their dessert menu... hopefully one day it'll be added to the smalls or sides menu... that would be reason enough to bring me back.",0.9966,0.772,0.174,0.055,0.5365431096681097

2009-12-07,4.0,"Browntrout appears to be another one of those hip organic granolified restaurants where things are organic and/or locally grown and stuff which is a pretty neat concept.  However, having been to a few restaurants like this, I worry that a few of them get so caught up in the concept that they forget why people go out to eat - to consume something that tastes awesome.   On the flip side, ""trout"" is one of the most amusing words to say out loud, in my opinion.  Right behind ""falafel"".   Being of that opinion, I had to give myself a little mental pep talk to fairly judge this restaurant and not just give it a sponge bath of love because I like the name of it.   So I ate, drank, and looked critically, but in the end, Browntrout deserves its sponge bath of love, so let the love rain down, baby.  I really liked sitting at the bar and waiting there.  The bartender was really cool and chatted with us about our drink selections.  They also have some sort of bubble-making device that makes it so sparkling water is free.  They also gave us a little amuse of pulled pork on top of some sort of bean spread.  Cool!  At the tables, they give you bread and olive oil, and this is the only thing about Browntrout that fits that ""too much concept, no taste"" definition.  The bread kind of tastes like it's got sticks cooked into it.  It's some sort of dense whole wheat that's kind of dry.  They give you very little olive oil, and the oil is not herbed or flavored so it doesn't add anything, really. Luckily, the food-food was way better. We shared a  fish trio, my bf got the mushroom tart, and I got that crazy hamburger made of grass-fed beef and covered in fried onions and bernaise sauce.  The fish trio was awesome, especially the smoked trout (seriously, not being biased) that was served in some sort of greens filled with fresh herbs.  The cured fish in there was awesome too - they gave you little bagel chips to put it on.  The spread they had with it was a little to citrusy for my likes, but I know a lot of people dig citrus more than me.  The fried perch which made up the last third of the trio was tasty but no more so than any other offering of fried fish I'd tried.    The mushroom tart wasn't actually sampled by me because I tend to like mushrooms only when used sparingly, but the bf was raving about how good the pastry part was.   As for me, I was elbows deep in that burger.  A burger that's covered with fried onion strings and bernaise must have had a million mgs. of cholesterol, but it was totally perfect.  They cooked that sucker an absolutely gorgeous rare-medium rare with a grey outside and a uniformly pink and juicy interior.  The sauce was given to me on the side so I could choose to drown it or dab it (drown it. duh.)  It was delicious and really rich - I had to take half of it home, but it was just as good for a super-unhealthy breakfast the next day.  If you like a little moo in your beef like me, don't bother heating it up, either.  Just let it stay pink. Mmm. Finally, I have to give this place major props for their service.  I am a fan of fast and prompt most times, but sometimes on a nice Friday night dinner, you just want to enjoy a leisurely paced meal and some good conversation with no hurry.  This doesn't mean that I want to be ignored, but I do like some laid-back yet invisibly effective service when the occasion calls for it, and Browntrout did this perfectly.  My water glass was never empty, our food came at a reasonable time, but I never got that ""quick-turn-this-table-over!"" feel that I sometimes sense in the air at restaurants, especially on Friday or Saturday nights. Well played, Browntrout.   Thus ends my unbiased review / love poem to Browntrout's smooth service and yummy food as I return to saying ""trout"" out loud way more than normal conversation allows.",0.9994,0.748,0.216,0.035,0.6061956727135297

To begin, how many restaurants can you name right off the bat that grows all its own herbs in a rooftop garden and serves seafood from natural waters or sustainable farms and meats that are all grass-fed, free range animals??  Can't think of one?  Browntrout's chalkboards prove it with the names of the various farms written down. Browntrout has one of the best pre fixe menus I've ever experienced!  For only $35 you get a top-notch, delicious organic meal made of perfect portions. My pre fixe was: -Parsnip & Pear Soup with green fennel seed and truffle oil -Country Cottage Farms Chicken Breast with bacon potato hash, roasted squash puree and grape -Complimentary Tempranillo red wine -Elvis's Sweet Potato Pie with marshmallow crisp and candied sweet potato My opinion: Soup: perfectly creamy and sweet, yet still not too rich.   Chicken: moist, lightly seasoned and accompanied just right with squash. Dessert: AMAZING!  I would come back just for what was said to be Elvis's (yes, the famous musician) recipe.  Heck, on my next visit I'd be happy with an app or two and a mini sweet potato pie. Mmm Mmm Good (and wayy better than Campbell's soup)!   Keep in mind that the pre fixe menu is only offer Wednesday evening and changes weekly, so be sure to check out their website for the current deal.   A few things to keep in mind for your own visit: -BT has a central communal table perfect for your next large dinner party or celebration. -BYOB, but with a $10 corkage fee. -I'd recommend making a reservation (not available online) since around 7:30 pm the restaurant began to fill up on a Wednesday evening.  If you don't make one, you may get sat elbow to elbow with a stranger at the communal table (per a fellow reviewer's experience). -The decor is absolutely gorgeous with earthy colors of brown and green and neat lamps to light up the place. -Even the bathroom goes ""green"" with recycled toilet paper and a energy-conscious hand-dryer. I am happy to welcome Browntrout to the Ravenswood/Lincoln Square/North Center area.  Bring on the fresh seafood!!",0.9989,0.75,0.237,0.013,0.5891283524904213
2009-11-08,3.0,"Browntrout . . . . .what a mixed bag night we had during our recent visit. First good, then bad, then good again . . .more consistency all around would push this review to 4 stars for sure.  We came on a busy Friday night. but we had reservations so all was well. We were greeted warmly and told they were just setting up our table. The problem? We were shown to a table where no table should exist. In fact- once my friend had taken his chair- the serving staff could not get by and my chair was flat up against the wall so we could go no where. After the 4th person bumped into us- we returned to the hostess stand, defeated. She told us to wait at the bar and that she would find us something else. All right, then. The small bar was packed but we were able to snag a stool in the corner. Now things were looking up. I had my standard drink- but my friend went with one of their specialty drinks and it made our night. Makers Mark and homemade ginger ale (the ginger is pressed and added to liquid sugar syrup ) and was undoubtably the best drink we have had in a long while. And at that point- they had found us another table- a perfect table, out of the fray where we could have a little privacy and not be in the middle of the place.  My friend had gone on line to see what the menu offered and was so sure of what he was going to get he barely glanced at the menu. Not a good idea in a place like this as none of his choices were available on the night we were there. Funny thing, though. The waiter didn't know that. We ordered the hummus plate to start and it wasn't until about 15 minutes later AFTER we had been given plates to share the hummus on, that he came back to tell us that the chef did not make hummus that day. Back to the drawing board for a different starter.  We finally landed on the cheese plate to start and the lamb pot (like a lamb pot pie) and the salmon for our entrees. Then the wait began. It took forever for the cheese to come out, and then when it did we asked for some more bread and seemingly could not get any. We were told it was ""coming"", ""warming in the oven"", ""had been taken to the wrong table"", you name it. We were told it. And finally 30 minutes later bread did show up.  The food when it arrived was outstanding. Tasty, perfectly prepared and sized appropriately. But it took over an hour and a half to get it. That's just way too long. And it was easy to tell on the server's faces and in the dialogue happening in the food pick up area that things were not going well on this night.  The best news of the night? We had brought an amazing bottle of wine to go with our dinner- so while everything else was a little up in the air- the wine we were enjoying was out of this world. While Browntrout has a liquor license, you can bring your own wine for a $10 corkage fee. And in our case- since there was so much going wrong with our experience, they waived the corkage fee.   They were definitely trying to make things right. Slow service, great food, cramped surroundings, a mixed bag for sure. The food, when it finally comes, will almost have you forgetting all the other issues.

2009-11-02,2.0,"For my birthday this past July, I was excited to bring the party to Browntrout, which I'd been eager to try since its recent opening. As an aspiring sustainability champion I was keen on Browntrout's roof garden and farm to table goodness. Unfortunately, the day of, Browntrout called to let me know they had mixed up their books and couldn't take my group until 930pm. We had made a 7pm reservation. Apparently they had booked two groups of 10 for the same time thinking the groups were one and the same, despite the different names. Since it was a school night, I hated to push dinner so late. We skipped Browntrout and had a great time at Cafe 28 instead. Their diverse menu, cheery atmosphere and excellent service cultivated a dinner where every single person loved what they ordered, and also indulged in that ""I shouldn't, but I will"" extra drink or two. Fast forward to late October. Decided to give Browntrout a second try when Ukie Village friends wanted to meet up for dinner in our area. This time there were just 4 of us, and our reservation stuck, so we were set. Alas...we didn't realize they now charge a $10/bottle corkage fee. Kinda takes all the fun out of BYOB, but we shrugged our shoulders and moved on to the yummy looking menu. Half the table ordered the trout, the other half going with chicken (both variations). Our server made no secret of his disdain for our table when I was the only one to order something besides an entree (a salad); he was clearly miffed that we weren't ordering more and racking up a higher bill. He dismissed us from that point on, ignoring us completely the rest of the evening, only to come around with the check long after we were ready to leave. It wasn't busy for a Friday night, so I can't give him the benefit of the doubt with the absence or lag time, and as someone who waited tables all through undergrad and grad I usually DO give the benefit of the doubt. As we had only brought one bottle of wine and went through it before the entrees were out, we wanted to order another round of drinks, but as mentioned before, our server wasn't interested in serving us anymore. My salad arrived as an afterthought, once we were midway through our entrees. It was delicious, with grapes and blue cheese in perfect unison; in fact, all of the entrees were pretty satisfying despite a disconnect between the casual atmosphere and fastidiously plated entrees.  But you know how a snotty server just leaves a bad taste in your mouth? We won't be back.",0.9871,0.791,0.138,0.071,0.5289434523809523
2009-11-01,4.0,"We had theater tickets, well I wouldn't actually call a drinking play at the Cornservatory actual theater, but we needed a place to eat before our 11pm show. Liz O. stumbled on Browntrout.  We had 9pm reservations and were seated at the communal table. Upon entering I noticed the light fixtures over the table. Round with black fern like leaves. Loved them. Taking look around the rest of the place, not much more made sense. I got the idea that maybe it used to be a Chinese restaurant before? Tables and chairs were strange. The big fish carving on the wall gave me that idea too.  Big props to the wine, beer, and liquor list. Matilda is served!!!! Love that beer. The cocktail list looked great too!  BUT, onto the food!  A multigrain bread basket was brought out with olives and extra virgin olive oil. The bread and olive oil don't go well together, but the bread was tasty on it's on.  Our server was very informative, helping with our dinner selections. We all had questions. We ordered the mac and cheese as a share plate with our entrees. He did warn us about the dish ahead of time. Told us the noodles were over cooked, left out over night, then deep fried, and covered in cheese. Hmmmmm, we all decided they tasted just like stale white cheddar Cheetos with cheese sauce drizzled over. While I'm glad we tried the dish, I wouldn't order it again!  I ordered the mussels for my starter. I was really shocked at how many there were in the bowl. Three large slices of the multigrain bread stuck out at well. They brought me extra seafood forks in case I wanted to share. Silly server, I don't share. My only qualm about my mussel experience would be that my empty shell bowl was overflowing before they brought me new one.  For my entree I cant recall the name of the dish, probably because I couldn't pronounce it that night either, but it was a ramekin full of purple potatoes, mushrooms, and all kinds of earthy goodness. Alongside the dish were fried smelt!!! It was totally a dish I would eat in the dead of winter.  My lady friends ordered the risotto, the trout trio, pear and parsnip soup. Everyone liked theirs as well!  A few side notes.....I believe this chef is in a pretty recent article noting him to be pretty darn amazing. The silverware is semi-caveman-esque. I work at a restaurant and believe me, I know silverware is expensive, but this stuff is the low end of the IKEA food chain. I didn't check out the bathroom, wishing I had.

2009-10-20,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place, and things started out so well. The hostess was very warm and friendly, the restaurant was packed, and the decor, while nothing special, was nice enough.  Things started a little strange with our waiter--he wouldn't let my partner and I order the same dish. I mean, outright refused.  I realize it's somewhat tacky to order the same thing, but honestly, nothing else on the menu was grabbing either of us.  Me: ""I'd like the same"" Waiter: ""Why don't you try the whitefish? Or the chicken?"" Me: ""That's okay, no, I'll have the papardelle"" Waiter: ""Really?"" Me: ""Yes, please."" Waiter: [Long awkward pause]. ""What about the duck?"" Me: [Thinking: WTF?!] ""Fine, I'll have the whitefish."" For our appetizer, we had a tomato trio which was delicious: Fried green tomatoes with a tomato coulis, a sort of caprese, and a tomato-ricotta cheese thingy. The drinks, also, very good: a mojito and a high ball made with homemade ginger ale.  Unfortunately, it was all downhill from there. The bolgnese papparadelle (with pork, long beans, carrots) came out with a hard, dry piece of pork on top that hurt your teeth when you tried to eat it (it resembled a dog treat). The sauce also had a strange aftertaste (it didn't help that I had a very similar dish the day before at Bluprint which was out of this world). My whitefish which was supposed to be stuffed with a mousseline came out without the mousseline and was dry and tasteless--almost inedible.  Then came the worst offender: a side order of Crispy Mac N' Cheese which WAS inedible.  We still don't know what it was, but it certainly didn't seem to be pasta. My partner said ""it's like eating cheese covered styrofoam"". Frankly, I thought that was being too nice. It was like eating styrofoam that had been left out in the rain to harden, then pissed on by homeless people, and then covered in a thick cheese sauce. Yummo!  By the way, it also took  forever to get our food (food?), so if you do go, make sure to give yourself a lot of time.",0.6257,0.782,0.111,0.106,0.5895228174603175
2009-10-19,2.0,"We stopped by here after seeing their ""Now Serving Brunch"" sign on the sidewalk. We were one of two parties who were in the restaurant when we were seated.  I love the decor, full of rich browns and deep reds. The hostess, who I assume was the owner, was very friendly. However, things kind of took a header from there.  It started with a dirty table, chairs, and coffee cups. Now, it was about 11:15am when we arrived, and they opened at 11:00am. Once those things were straightened out, we were served a piping hot cup of coffee with natural sugar cubes. Very nice! Sadly, there were no spoons on the table to mix said sugar cubes into the coffee. Not very nice.  We ordered our food. I got the eggs in a blanket, and the lady got the blueberry pancakes. I ordered their homemade breakfast sausage as a side, as it was described as a mix of pork and chicken. Mmmm.  The food took quite a while to come, and the coffee was only refilled after we found the server and requested it. Once the food did come, it was REALLY good. The eggs in a blanket were perfectly nestled in toasty brioche. The pancakes were also quite good, but a word to the wise, they are definitely infused with some sort of lemon zest, which is not explained on the menu. Sadly, the pancakes ended up a bit of a failure, as they were not cooked all the way through in the middle.  That brings me to the sausage. The sausage that I still haven't tasted. I was told it would be out in a minute after I received my eggs. Ok. No problem. I was nearly done with my meal before the server came back and said the first batch of sausage was ""not up to standard"" so they tossed it and were starting over. I really wanted to eat it with my eggs, so I waited, and my food got cold. And the sausage never came. Well, it did, but our dishes had already been cleared by then. I told them not to worry about it.  Then came the bill. $4 coffee that was rarely refilled and was served in a tiny mug. Seriously? No comp for all the issues we had. If it were me, I would have comped at least the coffee for the mix-ups and mediocre service when the place was 3/4 empty.  To be fair, the owner (?) said they have only been open for five weeks, and she just turned over her brunch staff. The flavors of the food were excellent, but overall it really fell short.

Also, if I remember correctly they opened around the time of the 2009 Chicago rib fest and offered a tasty rib for the competition, but ran out due to planning.  With my usual dining pals we checked out BT on a weekend evening. Since it's been so cold lately, we were able to get a table within minutes. They recently acquired a liquor license so that was a bigger plus since we forgot to bring our own bottle. Around the table everyone got different different items. Dietzler farms burger with waffle fries, falafel platter, hummus, and Crispy Mac and cheese. Everything was forgettable, we only remembered what we didn't like. The worst was the crispy mac and cheese, strange side which is macaroni that is crispy or has a texture like that snack Pirate's booty, then doused in white cream sauce. That hit the three of us in a way which we'll all remember, it also was the downfall and quick end of our evening. I wish the burger meat was seasoned, it lacked taste and the addition of a minute amount of cheese meant nothing. My highlight was the house made ginger ale; that with slivers of lemon and a dash of vodka.. perfect. The lemon or lime is integral, otherwise its way too sweet. Nice dining location with seating for up to 70, most tables accommodate groups of four and through the center of the room is a long dinner table which can handle up to fourteen perhaps. I think the glassware is ridunkulous. See water glass, I liked watching as people tried to grip it correctly to sip. Just an awkward shape. Average entree cost was $15 plus and the lower priced weren't much fun. For a better experience, bring a few people and order a bunch of items to share and make sure to drink a bottle of wine or two.

There was a key lime sauce on the dish that mixed beautifully with the strawberries. And the shortcake was great too. Just the right amount of strawberries, shortcake, lime sauce and whipped cream.

First meal: The fish trio appetizer was a tad odd, but 2 out of 3 were pretty tasty and it was definitely unlike anything I'd ever had before.  The pea shoot, fresh pea, and fresh ricotta salad with tangerine dressing was out of this world (so-much-so that I had to order it both times)...delightfully fresh, crunchy, and quite filling.  And my entree: Amish-style chicken with truffled spaetzle?!  My god...from the first bite, I almost couldn't believe the treat my tastebuds were getting.  The chicken was crispy yet juicy, flavorful & amazingly simple--yet so wonderful, whereas even some great restaurants can royally screw up chicken by making it the most boring dish on the menu, not at all the case here!  And the little spaetzle dumplings...this meal was so fantastic that I had to pause several times mid-bite to shake my head in wonder, as it's exceedingly rare to encounter something this good--at such reasonable prices, too.  I only wish the meal could've gone on forever.  Dessert-fresh strawberry shortcake with lime zest, almond brittle, and homemade cake- was the perfect end to a perfect first meal. Second meal:  Again the pea salad, and New Zealand-style rainbow trout- also a success.  If I had one complaint this time, it's that the Gruyere Fondue Appetizer was a bit too tangy/lemony for my taste.  The hummus appetizer (really, who can screw up hummus?) wasn't bad, well-seasoned, and we had some other appetizer involving smoked fish and corn that was interesting enough. Service was a bit spotty, probably because they still have some kinks to iron out, but our waiter graciously brought us an extra appetizer (a yummy seasonal salad with cherries and arugula) to make up for the long wait between courses.  All of this can be forgiven, because the food is just not-to-be-missed.

The complimentary bread was excellent, and delicious when soaked in olive oil.   They really need a sound barrier between the kitchen and the dining area better than the existing dropcloth.  My companion and I were seated near the back of the restaurant, and the loud barking between chef and staff was a little irritating.   As for service:  entree service was SLOW.  I appreciate not being rushed when I'm having a nice meal out, but the pacing between appetizers and entrees was poor, and the place wasn't more than half full.   Even so, the server handled wine service well (Browntrout's BYOB for the moment), support staff was attentive (filling water, clearing plates, etc.), and all staff were uniformly friendly and polite. Now for the food.  Sigh.  DIsappointing. First, the good: Appetizers were tasty.  The mussels were a good choice (meaty, tasty, and lots of them).  The three-fish ""share"" plate was fine. The entrees were a letdown.  Admittedly, I bucked the server's recommendation in ordering the walleye rather than the trout, but still.  The choice of complementary ingredients was good, highlighted by morel mushrooms (which you can never, ever go wrong with) and fresh green beans (sorry--""haricot verts"").  The fish itself was blah.  It was pan seared to the right-level of done-ness--the meat was at a nice melt-in-your mouth consistency--but it just didn't have much flavor.  (Yes, I know walleye's a mild fish.  It was bland even by those standards.) My date's lamb sirloin was mixed--ordered medium rare, it was definitely served on the rare side.  (It was perfect for my taste [juicy and flavorful], but I wasn't the one ordering it.)  The celery risotto was tasty but a little salty.   Portion sizes were fine--we left feeling satisfied but not overly full.  The food wasn't BAD, but if you're paying moderately upscale prices ($23 apiece for the entrees we ordered), it was below par.   And dessert--easily the most irritating part of the meal.  The selections are limited, so I went with the recommended chocolate chip cookies.  (This seemed like an odd dessert choice for a restaurant, but the server raved about them, and nothing else sounded all that enticing.)   Let's just say when you're charging six bucks for two average-sized cookies and offering them as a dessert selection in a nice restaurant, they'd better be, at a minimum, fresh, delicious, and warm.  They were none of the above.  Room temperature, hard on the bottom, and not even especially chocolatey.  The entrees were blah, but at least reflected some effort and had some high points--the cookies, on the other hand, were an absolute ripoff.   All this being said, it's in the neighborhood, other people have obviously liked it, both on Yelp and at the surrounding tables (the guy next to us couldn't stop raving about his salad), and I'm an open-minded guy, so I might be willing to chance it again at some point when it's been open more than a week.  In my view, though, they've got a lot of things to work on in the meantime. EDIT: [[taint its Yelp profile with their ""meh"" reviews]] Hilarious.  As if a restaurant's entitled to a pristine slate of reviews to placate its diehards, regardless of the quality of food it serves.  There's an easy way to avoid ""meh"" reviews:  provide something other than a ""meh"" product.   Claire, I'm impressed by your stealthiness--you apparently managed to sit at my table, consume part of my meal, and thereby conclude that my opinion is unsupportable without my (or my date's) noticing your presence! (At least, I assume that to be the case--surely you would never impugn the credibility of someone's review without having a basis for doing so.)  Well done!  Or, perhaps, you consider it beyond the realm of possibility that a restaurant you like might serve the occasional substandard meal.  Unthinkable, I tell you!",0.9989,0.765,0.194,0.041,0.6083125

We then browsed over the relatively decent and somewhat eclectic menu (Falafel? lamb? trout? burger?) and settled with the mussels and fish trio for starters (per our waiter's recommendation, I might add).  The mussels were delicious actually - and the fish trio was rather satisfying but it wasn't anything special. I then ordered the lamb dish (again recommended by the waiter) and my date had the walleye. My lamb definitely came out a lot rarer than I would've liked but I didn't really mind. It was eh. The lamb was just really bland. My celery root risotto was good, but definitely salty - I'm not sure if that's a characteristic of celery root or a product of an overzealous cook. The small portion of fresh vegetables included with my dish were tasty. My date's walleye dish was cooked well, but the dish itself was also blah. All of our dishes just lacked that pop of awesome flavor you're seeking when dining out.  The dessert menu was also sparse. Only a few random items such as strawberry shortcake, chocolate chip cookies, and this banana trio thing? Anyway, we once again went with our waiter's recommendation of cookies and were extremely disappointed. Our cookies were rather small, hard, cold, and boring. Wouldn't you expect your dessert cookies to at least be warm?! Sigh.  I forgot to note our surroundings... Place is decorated nicely, definitely more upscale and plenty of tables for a decent dinner crowd, but we were placed near the kitchen area that is only separated by a curtain and it was noisy, uncomfortable, and obnoxious. Definitely killed the entire date atmosphere that the rest of the restaurant seemed to be experiencing. Lesson Learned: request to sit in the front section! I don't really know if I'd go again...kind of pricey for a mediocre experience.",0.9797,0.794,0.13,0.076,0.6231448773448772
2009-05-29,5.0,"Wow! We had a terrific dinner at Browntrout, so happy to find this place! They just opened and already doing great things. Our table of three ordered the Ramps/morels small plate and the waffle fries with gouda fondue. Both were great! For entrees we ordered the pasta special (wild mushroom papardelle), the tallgrass sirloin and the amish chicken breast. While all three were delicious we all found the Amish chicken breast to be the best of the three, and honestly one of the best chicken dishes we've all ever had. It was cooked to absolute perfection with a delicately crisp skin and was juicy as can be. It was served with surprisingly great truffled spaetzl and grilled zuccini. We loved the sustainable aspect of this place as well as the decor. The staff was so incredibly nice, very professional. Although if there was any evidence of the restaurant being brand new it was with our slightly eccentric and slightly forgetful waiter, however all ordered items were correct, just little things but he was very nice and very enthusiatic. We had coffe but no desserts but would def get dessert next time for sure. Right now it's BYOB which was great for us but we look forward to a wine list to compliment the food if they add that as well. All in all, just great. This will become one of the places we take friends and out-of-towners.",0.9959,0.741,0.244,0.015,0.665538870851371
