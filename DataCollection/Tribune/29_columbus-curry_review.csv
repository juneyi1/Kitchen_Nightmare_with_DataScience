Unfortunately, within a month of my ordering from here, the prices increased SIGNIFICANTLY (my dish went from $11.75 to $16.95!). This place is good, but NOT that good.

Maybe they should have considered smaller portions instead of the larger price. This doesn't seem like it will fare well for them. You can go to Cumin and get a lunch buffet for far less, and better quality food. Or just walk over to Rangoli.

I also ordered naan.  The meal was very disappointing - the bowl was mostly rice, I had hardly any daal, the curried vegetables appeared to be from a bag of frozen mixed veg (you know the kind, the mix of peas, corn, green beans, and distinctively cut diced carrots where everything has kind of a freezer burn, rubbery yet dried out texture after its cooked?) and had twiggy inedible bits of herbs that shouldn't have been left in. The chana was dry and the aloo gobi had no cauliflower pieces above a mince.  The naan was simultaneously mushy and rock hard, like it was old and had been reheated and got doughy spots from steam in the tinfoil (also, you only get ONE small piece of naan that is cut in half per $2 order! Ridiculous!) To add insult to injury the food was lukewarm when it reached me, which is especially confusing as they actually delivered it in half the quoted time.  So I guess the silver lining is that I got my nearly inedible meal really quickly!",-0.5796,0.815,0.085,0.1,0.5223868312757202

2016-03-07,5.0,"Ok.  So science recently proved that Indian food is truly the best.  My roots being from India, always heard of how good Indian food is and some claimed it is the best but isn't that true of most people saying the food from their culture is the best?  I have to agree on this one though; yes, I'll still eat my steak, burgers, fish and french fries but nothing beats Indian food in my books. I knew about this place before it opened.  Months ago I was walking down Milwaukee and they were going to open within days.  The name caught my attention. I thought it's cool.  Columbus never made it to India but he sure found Indian flavors. Been wanting to try this place for a while and today, i just happened to be alone and was their first customer. I had the 2 veggie with 2 protein options with brown rice and also took 2 samosas; BIG MISTAKE  That's way too much food.  Had 3 portions out of it. The brown rice was made PERFECTLY.  The softness surpassed what you get at most restaurants.  Truly reminded me of Japanese rice to an extent. For the proteins, I had the spicy chicken masala (no, it wasn't too spicy) and the beef keema.  For the veggies, I had the gobi and the okura.  Also picked up samosas. I was skeptical about the chicken; most Indian places end up making their chicken dry. This was too but the key here was these guys actually made the chicken pieces tiny so you didn't quite feel it that dry.   The beef was good.  Nothing fancy about the protein though.  Not bad. The okura was really good.  Truly felt home made. The killer for me were the gobi and samosas. When I used to live in Tokyo, we visited this Indian restaurant called Nair's (supposedly the oldest Indian restaurant in the Far East).  I literally have dreams about Nair's potatoes that are made in his curry flavors.  The gobi potato dish here reminded me of that.  Put together with the brown rice which already felt like Japanese rice, I AM IN HEAVEN. The samosas were good.  I suspect they are frozen though but need to have it again to know for sure.  Guys, I'm sorry if I'm wrong guys.  The flavor though was amazing.

The entrees are on a steam table and they offer combinations of items that allow the eater to choose their flavors and protein sources.

I ordered butter chicken and chana masala. The portions are a few notches past generous; they're large. Because Indian food is slow cooked, the Chipotle formula doesn't work well. The chana masala was actually really good once you got beyond the heavy handed amount of salt in the recipe. The butter chicken also had a good flavour, but the chicken was dry.

Here's what I ordered; the pakoras looked iffy, so I ordered the samosas. These were bland and not good at all.

For traditional Indian and Nepalese you must go to Cumin right up the street or make the trek up to Devon Avenue, but this is a fine alternative for a quick lunch or late-night nosh. Give it a try. For twenty dollars we got to try to the following: Samosas - $3.75 for three small triangular packets. I did not like these because instead of a chickpea flour dough they use something like eggroll wrappers, which do not hold up well to sitting around under a heat lamp after being fried. They were very tough. Skip these unless you know they are fresh. 4-Entree Selection ($8.99 + $2.00 for the beef and paneer) - enough for two people: Brown rice - It is what it is, tasted fresh when I got it.  Chicken Tikka Makhani - The first bite was tasty, but after that the chicken seemed dried out, like they use the breast meat and cooked it too long or on too high a temperature. Not a large serving either. Beef Keema Matar - For a dollar more this serving had double the amount in the Chicken Tikka, but the meat was ground fine and tasted cheap to me. Daal - too spicy for my taste and a very small serving, no more than half a cup. Shahi Paneer - Now I love Palak Paneer so I had to try this, even for another dollar, and even though this was my favorite out of everything, I still would not return for it. Small serving in a sauce that tastes remarkably like Italian vodka sauce.  Dessert: Gulab Jamun - $3.75 for three, nice texture, but much sweeter than normal. Service was friendly and helpful, but I also have a problem with all of the Styrofoam packaging. I cannot believe with all of our advanced technology we still do not have an inexpensive, bio-degradable alternative.

The good:  the value for the portion size, the hearty brown rice, and the tasty chana masala chickpea veggie selection.  The bad:  everything else.  The naan was just ok, the chicken tikka masala was bland, nearly flavorless, and surprisingly tough to chew (although my 14-month-old was VERY happy with this chicken when we fed it to her for dinner tonight...love kids), and the other veggie options we tried--daal, aloo gabi, and the bhindi masala curry--were not memorable in any way.

Definitely made me want to take my food to go! I would suggest a more alternative music selection....c'mon it's Wicker Park.",0.8996,0.754,0.189,0.057,0.595
2015-04-27,5.0,"Finally! A fast food Indian place! The service is great and polite, the place is clean and organized, the menu is easy to follow, and the food is tasty and cheap! You can try 3 or 4 different flavored dishes for under $10 and the portion size is huge. I took half home and am eating it now and the flavors hold up. When I asked the owner for a bag to carry my left overs home in, he smiled proudly and said that it was good that I plan on eating more at home and that we all should be eating more Indian food! I couldn't agree more. I'm excited to see this place grow and I hope they have a rotation of seasonal curries so I can try more dishes! Oh and don't miss out on the mango lassi which is made fresh in house!!",0.9824,0.782,0.205,0.013,0.5722222222222223

2015-04-25,4.0,"As someone else mentioned earlier - the concept is fast Indian food done a lot like Chipotle. Glad to have this addition to the neighborhood to put on the takeout rotation. Fast and affordable! You choose between basmati or brown rice as a base, and select a scoop of 3 or 4 entrees to go on top. I especially enjoyed the Shahi Paneer ($1 extra). Pass on the naan, it's cheap but taste pretty bland. There is plenty of seating. It's not the type of place that you call ahead to pickup. You just go there and order on the spot. Unfortunately, the to go boxes were not the greatest for transporting. By the time I got home, the food had leaked, so it was a bit of a mess. They could maybe tape the to go orders to ensure better transport? Happy to have this new option in the neighborhood but they are new and still working out some of the kinks!",0.8773,0.779,0.144,0.077,0.6898569023569023
2015-04-25,4.0,The curry is delicious. I regret to say that I can't remember what curry I got. I got one protein and two veggie curries and naan and split it with my wife. We were both stuffed. And they have ginger ale! Here's how they could get 5 stats from me: *The naan is lacking. It was a little dry and hard.  *Offer a less food for less money option *Have descriptions next to the curry.  Definitely coming back. So good.,0.7875,0.831,0.121,0.048,0.38750000000000007
2015-04-24,4.0,"Americanized fast-casual has now infiltrated Indian cuisine. The influence of Chipotle-style service is evident. Very glad that this place has opened close to me, as sometimes I crave Indian but don't want to go out and sit (i know there's delivery but I'm discounting that). Enter Columbus Curry. Upon first entry, it smells amazing. So amazing. It's also cheap. And fast. It's easy. Choose your rice (2 options, but choose basmati), then pick 3 or 4 entrees, which are either veggie or protein.  Rice with protein and veggies on top is pretty much my favorite meal, so of course I found it good.  The aloo gobi (seasoned potatoes and cauliflower) were awesome, and my chicken masala curry and chicken makhani were tasty. I'd skip the naan though, it was bland and disappointing. On a side note, glad that yelp fixed the unfortunate hack on this page. It was pretty terrible.  Welcome to Wicker, Columbus! Hope this business succeeds, as there are few, if any, concepts like this around.",0.9943,0.659,0.278,0.063,0.7153846153846153
2015-04-24,5.0,"Just the meal itself and a soda makes for an excellent dinner for less than $15USD. Add in nann and dessert (like gulab jamun), then you've got a very filling meal for less than $20USD. With rice as your base, you have a choice of three entree or four. I picked the four with the two protein and two veggie entree choices. Basmati rice, beef keema matar, chicken masala curry, aloo gobi and bhindi masala curry. Extra side I picked up nann and gulab jamun. Plus a soda. Not bad for less than 19 overall.  Pretty spacious for the most part and nice lighting. Good window view of which one can see folks going about along this part of Milwaukee Ave.",0.8542,0.871,0.102,0.028,0.5226190476190476
