They only had 7 brunch items on the menu, one of which was a mini cereal box (fruit loops, Frosted Flakes, etc.). They also had 6 lunch items. I had the burger which was good, but it could've been better seasoned. The mimosas are extremely weak. You can't taste any champagne in them, but the server kept our glasses full.  It was above 95 degrees outside during my visit and it was probably 80 degrees inside. I told the server it was hot, and he informed me that I was sitting right underneath the vent. So it's safe to say the air conditioning doesn't work very well.  I also agree with the Yelper that mentioned the photos are misleading. I didn't come here expecting a fine dining or romantic ambiance, but I can see how someone would expect a completely different environment based on the photos.",0.6987,0.807,0.11,0.083,0.4748015873015873

2016-07-03,4.0,"The Monarch is a really, chill cool spot. The pictures online are, at least to us, slightly deceiving. They look as if the place is more romantic and fancier, but it looks just like an average pub/bar. But that isn't to take anything away from it. It was still an overall nice experience. Our server, (can't remember the guy's name) we had mixed feelings about. He started off like he wasn't really up for working that day. He was very dry with responses and just didn't seemed enthused to be working. More on him in a bit... I bought a Groupon to surprise my wife for her birthday. It included one entree and one alcoholic drink per person. I got the Shrimp and Scallop Ceviche (very tasty) and she got the Fried Green Tomato Sandwich. Overall, their food is pretty tasty but the portions are a bit skimpy. Especially the Ceviche. My wife said her sandwich was OK but it didn't have enough batter on it. We also got the Smoke wings as an additional entree. Those were REALLY good though.. Courtesy of Yelp, they had a special where if you checked in at Monarch through the Yelp app, you could get an instant voucher for a free pretzel. The pretzel was insanely good. It was soft, hot, and sugary sweet served with cream cheese that had little yellow raisins in it. Yummy! The drinks are probably the main reason this review gets 4 stars. They have bottomless Mimosas for 11 or 12 bucks per person and they are DELIGHTFUL! Best Mimosa I've ever had and my wife loved them too. It's a pretty good deal. As for our one free drink with the Groupon, we both got the peach nectar champagne drink which was also really good!  The server got better towards the end of our visit and he started to actually smile a bit. Maybe he was a little agitated because of the afternoon rush. We had to ask for a few things that we typically would already have at the table like napkins and silverware, but we didn't have to wait long for those things to be delivered. Main things to take away from this review: Portions are generally small so don't come here to get full. We made reservations thinking that the place would be really crowded, but there were quite a few tables open but I would still make reservations to be safe. If you get there for brunch, be sure to get the bottomless Mimosas, you won't regret it! Be sure to check Groupon to see if they have one available as our bill would have been over $100 if we hadn't of used it versus $41. We may go back for dinner one day.

2016-06-01,4.0,"Can't believe I have yet to review The Monarch since being the featured recommendation on Chicago's Best! Anyway, this is a seriously underrated pub in Wicker Park doing some really great things with food! A constantly rotational menu shows me they truly care about the product they present day in and day out.  Brunch: excellent. Cheap, bottomless mimosa deal - highly recommend starting there. In terms of food, their chilaquiles stack up with any of Chicago's brunch heavyweights, yet don't get the acclaim they do. Bully! The duck confit tostada and fried green tomato sandwich are also creative and tasty. I haven't tried the sweet stuff, but they master the savory brunch.  Dinner: equally excellent. Have I mentioned that these guys have one of the most underrated menus in Wicker Park, maybe even in all of Chicago? They also serve the fried green tomato sandwich for dinner as well, but the star of the show is the pork shoulder stew. One of the best renditions of pork shoulder I've ever had, but it's only available seasonally.  Drinks: solid beer selection and they always have specials. Pretty basic, but does the trick.  I also really love that they have giant jenga on the outdoor patio. This kept us entertained for hours the other night! Also, they always seem to have some sort of deal, promotion, or special going on, be it with Groupon, the Infatuation, Tocayo beer, or Spring Rewards.  My only gripes are their odd hours and slightly uneven service. I have walked by a few times wanting to stop in, only to find that they are closed!

2016-04-20,4.0,"My first visit to Monarch was for Saturday brunch. I wasn't sure what to think as we were seated immediately upon entering.  It's rare to find a great brunch spot doesn't have a wait of some sort.  Wait or not wait, I'm thankful to share that this place did not disappoint.    For openers, they have bottomless mimosas from 10am-4pm. And these are NOT the mimosas made with ""too much frozen orange juice"".  The orange juice to champagne ratio was on par with some of the best I've had.  And even nicer, the orange juice seemed to be freshly squeezed. Needless to say, I had my fair share (ok, maybe mine and few others fair share) of these.   On to the food.  As a starter I shared the Sweet Spiced Pretzel (which happened to be a complimentary Yelp check-in offer).  The pretzel was very tasty and the Golden Raisin Cream Cheese that came with it took it over the top. I could have consumed a few more of these but decided it best to have something more nutritional.  For my entrée I went with the 3 egg omelet. If you're a fan of chorizo, this is the omelet for you as it was loaded with it. While the omelet was delicious, it did not compare to the Fried Green Tomato sandwich.  That sandwich was amazing, super flavorful and it came with some very tasty fries. It will definitely by my entrée of choice on my next visit.  They make good use of the space they have with both booth and bar seating. There is a patio out back that seems like it would be perfect for either brunch or drinks; weather permitting of course. The staff at Monarch was all that and more. Our server was really cool and did an excellent job of keeping both our water glasses and mimosa glasses filled. They never sat empty until near the end when we informed our server we were finished.  Monarch is definitely on my Chicagoland brunch list and it should be on yours.  I look forward to many return visits.",0.9971,0.791,0.2,0.009,0.5471509971509971

I immediately regretted my decision upon learning that they had run out of Bloody Mary mix at 11am! While I didn't want to let this ruin my brunch I decided to check out the menu for what I was going to eat. First off the food is overpriced and the menu is tiny - apparent in everyone ordering the same dish: the croissant sandwich. Once we started to order we were told they had run out of croissants (how do you manage to do this?) so we all had it on sourdough instead. Fast forward to receiving our food and it was cold. Not only was it cold but people received different sides for the same exact dishes. Some of us received hash browns, others fries and others breakfast potatoes. The food wasn't bad but I couldn't look past everything being cold. it tasted like it had been sitting for a while.

The bar was clean and the servers were professional. In fact, the reason I didn't feel at home in this neighborhood bar is that it was almost too nice. The gourmet take on bar food at gourmet prices was a turn off for me. Give me a basket of cheep wings and some High Life. However, this isn't that type of place, so that complaint isn't warranted. But maybe it is, because it's the high priced foods and craft-centric beer menu that turn me off. It's whats prevents me from going there for bar trivia because I'm not willing to make a large financial commitment for such an event. Also, on the topic of bar trivia, it isn't very fun here. The trivia announcer just reads from a sheet, I felt like I was taking a class or something. There wasn't even any profanity. Tell some jokes! Give credit to funny team names! Something! Bottom Line: If you appreciate how your hot wings are plated and presented to you, and don't mind paying for it, this is a good place for you. If you care about your bank account balance, then this isn't the casual spot it claims to be.

One of the best bartenders I've had in the city. She made us some really good drinks, we had some nice conversation and generally it was one of the better bars I have been to! I left with the impression that this was my favorite place in town. I spent the next couple of weeks raving about this place to my coworker and finally convinced him to come have a drink with me after work. The bartender this time was a man (Mike) who was a complete jackass. The drinks were still good, but this fellow was just the rudest bartender I have ever encountered since I came to Chicago. He was bad enough that I felt the need to apologize to my coworker for him, and we left after one drink.  My wife and I came back (at her insistence) on a Sunday and had a great meal. The food was fantastic and the bartender was a a pretty Russian girl (Diana)  who took care of us. And then Mike came back and was not only rude to us, but rude to our bartender in front of us, and to the other staff members. Personally, I don't know what this guy's deal is, but he's bad enough that I created a Yelp account specifically to bring this to the owner's attention. At no time as a customer should I hear a bartender tell another staff member to ""get the fuck out of here"",  especially when she's serving my drink. And hearing him dress the barback down and call him a ""motherfucker"" was just too much.  This is a great fucking bar! The decor is nice, The whole staff is great, except for this guy.

Menu selection is ok, but man prices are high! $6.75 for an Oberon? Wow! So my date and I go ahead and place our order. Service was good, but food came out slow. Food was ok, drinks were meh. Definitely not worth $10.50 for a watered down Cosmo. I got the burger it was pretty good. My date got the steak and said it was kinda cold. So we finish everything up and get the bill. We had a groupon stating $35 for $71. We handed the waitress the groupon and she rang us out. When we get the bill back, it states only $50 was taken off. Hold up... wait! The groupon said it was suppose to take $71 off. We flag down the waitress and show her the issue. She says she will grab the manager. The Manager and Owner comes by and says groupon made a mistake. He brings  a paper that states two entrees and two drinks (up to a $71 value) was the deal. Well, ok, that's cool, but that's not what my groupon says. Verbatim the owners words are ""I am not responsible for Groupon's verbiage, there is nothing that I can do, call groupon and get a refund"". You're the owner and there is nothing you can do? Man this place is in trouble!!!! He refused to honor the full value of the groupon and refused to listen any further of what I was saying. He blamed groupon for the confusion and did not do anything to make me as a customer feel better about the situation. He bad mouths groupon, but still has deals going on with them? That doesn't make sense. So we left, loosing out on $20, and leaving a real sour taste in my mouth. Thinking after the situation, even if the groupon was for 2 entrees and 2 drinks, we should have had $60 taken off. I was too furious to do the math at the time. With the amount of bars and restaurants in the area, or even across Chicago, I don't have time to deal with idiots like this. Never again.",0.9718,0.79,0.127,0.083,0.5385440613026821

I have never tasted such good chilaquiles, even having lived in Mexico....the cheese was perfectly creamy, the sauce picante without being overpoweringly fiery, and the sunnyside up eggs perfectly done without being greasy. Also the chicken thigh confit was a really nice touch - they were so tender I almost thought they were chunks of cheese!  Jenny had the challah french toast, which was also phenomenal - the only minuscule regret is they went a little light on the marscapone (what a pair of divas, i know).

While we had one main server, bussing and food running were provided by what I can only assume was the owner and a bar back. Again, super nice and attentive. How often do you see an owner helping out? Food was great, sharable small plates. Drinks were outstanding. Post event, we trickled in. First just a couple of us and then more and more until we were dozens. On a busy Saturday night, I didn't expect a warm welcome. Instead we were greeted with enthusiasm by the owner as boomerangs and our night continued until close. This might just be the first bar in Wicker Park that I haven't wanted to bail on due to suburban douchebaggery. No douches here. Just friendly folk, singing along, banging on the bar, letting everyone have their own good time.  While the bar was busy, the staff kept it rolling.

This last time we went, however, both my fiance an I felt like we had just had brunch at a salt-lick.

I originally wanted the fried green tomato sandwich but they told me that they were out. At 10AM... when they open at 10am... That in my opinion is inexcusable. I mean I may have forgiven them if the food that we did receive was amazing but it really was not. The patty melt wasn't a patty melt at all. Just a hamburger on two pieces of toast... The french toast was so incredibly thin! French toast should come in nice thick, fluffy slices. This was less than half an inch thick! Overall, not a very good experience.

The cardienne (sp?) and the amaretto sour style cocktails were most raved about. Would have loved to work my way through a couple more, but was too enamored with the food.  Get the Brussel sprouts now. They are excellent. Tartare is not my thing, but I appreciated my bite. The stone crab dip seemed like a crafty take on crab Rangoon and was everyone's favorite. The chips had a wonton texture and taste. So good.  I got the fried green tomato sandwich, which was okay. Not something you can get elsewhere, but I would probably order differently next time. My friend got the Hanger steak and that's my probably my next move there.  Dessert is not something I make it to very often, but oh boy that pecan pie. Are they kidding? So good.

Reviews seemed positive and the menu looked good, so I went with it. They really exceeded our expectations! When we sat down, they asked us if it was our first time there. When they heard it was, they brought us some complementary champagne! I really nice touch, and a great way to start the meal. We started with the beef tartare appetizer, which was DELICIOUS! Full of flavor without being too spicy... mmm just perfect. For our entrees, my boyfriend and I couldn't decide between the burger and the fried green tomato sandwich, so we ordered one of each and split them in half. Both were insanely delicious. The fried green tomato sandwich was a particular stand-out, with a jalapeno aioli that I'm still dreaming about. All of these dishes could have easily been heavy--while I'm not saying they were light fare, they were refined and delicious versions of themselves. And I wish we had had time to stay for dessert--the pecan pie sounded so tempting! As for the ambiance, it's a smaller bar/restaurant with a really nice, chill vibe. They played lots of great classic songs from the 80s/90s, which was super fun for the 20- and 30-something crowd. We sat by the window, which was open on this lovely September night, which added to our enjoyment. The service was outstanding. Our water/drinks were always tended to, and our server was always checking in with us in a way that was friendly but not overbearing.

Not recommended for exceedingly large groups. And of course, for the warmer months, an adorable patio!

The fried green tomato sandwich was full of flavor, with a jalapeño sauce. We also got the mussels and they were in the best white wine sauce. I honestly could've drank the sauce, it was that good. Fantastic! The service: On point! I think waiters should always know their menu and what's good on it. We received great recommendations and I think that always makes for a good experience.

I like scallops but I'm not one of those guys that always have to have them, but these were exceptional. We then shared the cornbread grits and that was pretty much the star of the  show.it  includes a slow poached egg along with braised pork shoulder and gravy on top of grits...very good. For my entree, I got the pan roasted amish chicken which came with those same cornbread grits. Really good as well...the chicken was very tender and juicy.  I came back again days later for brunch as our server said it was really good. I got the Duck Confit Chilaquiles and they were phenomenal. Very good flavor as I will eat just about anything that includes duck! Bottomless mimosas are going on here as well...FYI!

2014-08-23,3.0,"Very torn. Loved the atmosphere. Loved the brunch burger, pork sandwich, croissant omelette, wings and the pretzel. We were saying: ""Mmmmm!"" alot. Loved the atmosphere and the bathroom of bad actors collage with Elvis, John Wayne and Shatner.  Here was the problem. I wanted to try the Virginia oysters. The waiter got the kitchen staff to shuck some for me away from brunch menu. That was cool He also kept our Mimosas filled at all times. He was friendly, on the ball, and knew his product. unfortunately, the third was a bad oyster that I ate without smelling. The kitchen staff needs to smell fish, seafood, meats before they serve it, not me. I told the waiter and he took them away but when he gave us the bill, he charged me for them. He apologized and corrected the mistake but when we checked our bank account, he charged us for the original bill with oysters and the amended check. 140 dollars was our brunch tab times two. 140 dollar brunch tab without tip is enormous since they supposedly charge brunch prices. I was confused how high it was but I am not a person who EVER complains. I just don't return. Action speaks louder than words and hits in the wallet. When I called the restaurant during business hours at 10 pm on a Saturday to tell them I was double charged, an answering machine picked up twice; and they encourage reservations. Bad business, man. So now, a spontaneous fun brunch stop has turned into a bad taste in my mouth. I think 140 is astronomical for a Saturday brunch, 280 is hilarious. The duck entree is a waste of a menu space. It could have been pulled pork for all I know, It was bland and had no character like the rest of the food. The wings are best wings ever. See? Very torn. Very happy and very annoyed simultaneously. Grew up in the restaurant business so I am not like most of the amateur reviewers. I don't ever seek out fault in a restaurant experience, it has to find me. I am there for one reason and one reason only: To give a treat to all my senses. And this torn feeling and growing angst this experience has now caused in me  doesn't make good business sense at all. I think I am going to wait to see what they do when they come across the double charge.

We were playing games (bachelorette party... duh), taking shots, etc and they were joining in and having a blast!  The food was awesome - I had the chilaquiles (without the duck) and it was delish!! The fries were good and came with this aioli that everyone at the table stole b/c it was awesome! Other people at the table got the fried tomato sandwich, the breakfast sandwich, the chilaquiles with duck, french toast (YUM), and .... cereal (yes they also have boxed cereal if it's something you want). Everyone loved their food. It IS a small kitchen (you can see them cooking your meal - so it took a while and there was miscommunication with two things so some things came later. We were ok with this since we had so much food and were busy playing games/drinking anyways, but I could definitely see this being an issue for people if they were here for just brunch.

There's a small patio area in the back, it would have been awesome to sit out there, but with a large party, they couldn't fit us out there - which was fine . it ended up being so much more fun indoors anyway!

2014-07-29,1.0,"Let me start off by saying, I will never trust girls named Ashley when recommending places for brunch.  I was suppose to meet a few friends here on a Saturday morning. The place looks like a perfectly fine place to eat, but like a girl you met at the bar with crabs - looks can be deceiving. Here are a few reasons I would rather burn my money in an alley and then eat out of a dumpster:  1. The place was EMPTY when a part of our group got there and they would not let them sit down until the whole party was there. I get it, you want to seem busy and important but my friend has a baby and she does not want to stand holding her baby while she waits for me to get there. There is no harm in letting her sit down at the table and relax. 2. The orange juice is advertised as ""Fresh Squeezed"". This is false and offensive. You squeezed that shit from a Tropicana carton.  3. When asking for a side of fruit the waitress said, matter-of-factly, that she would gets us some scrambled eggs. Scrambled eggs is not fruit. Scrambled eggs is not even fruit adjacent. 4. The food took almost an hour to get to our table after ordering. I mean this is just ridiculous, this place was empty and I am 99% sure the head chef of The Monarch is a microwave.  5. Once the food did get to our table, I couldn't even eat it. I got a fried pork sandwich which was entirely made from previously frozen ingredients.  The bacon was chewy, the chicken patty was still cold in the middle, the biscuit was almost entirely dry and stale, and the fries were cold, mushy, and unsalted. I took in total three bites before coming to the realization that if I continued down this dangerous path I would be confined to my toilet whilst shitting my brains out.  All in all, don't waste your money or your time on this place. The food is absolute garbage that was once frozen.",-0.8377,0.798,0.096,0.106,0.5527329749103942

2014-07-26,1.0,"I not only disagree with anyone who reviews this spot with above two stars, but especially for brunch, I have to believe if you go back here more than once, you have never had a fresh meal and will settle for anything and pay too much for it. A small group of friends and I met here for brunch off recommendation. We met at 11, when they open on Saturdays, and since only 4 of us (including a baby) were there, we were told to wait until our entire party (2 more people) arrived to be seated. So, not only did they have a group with a baby just stand and wait, there was barely anyone in the restaurant. In fact, when the remainder of our group arrived about ten minutes later, we sat outside all by ourselves. Why make us wait? We had a reservation and no one was there!  I know that a lot of places do not accommodate  children. Absolutely used to it and will never hold it against a restaurant. Monarch provided a high chair and that was the extent of it. This isn't a complaint, more of a warning to anyone with children who plan on eating here. I ordered juice for him (NOT fresh squeezed) and they didn't have any cups with lids, or even to-go coffee cups. I then asked the waitress for a side of fruit for the babe, and her response was, ""we don't have fruit, I can get him scrambled eggs."" This was everyone's favorite part of the meal. You don't have fruit at brunch?? Nothing? Ok. Eggs it is. I guess.  After ordering, we were left waiting for a full half hour until our meals came, with no apology or explanation from our server.  She did come  back to make sure she could get refills on alcohol drinks, then we were sort of abandonded. Finally! The food! I ordered the fried pork sandwich. What did my $13 get me?? A single tiny sandwich made of previously frozen food and a side of previously frozen fries with no salt or seasoning. The pork on the sandwich was tasty, but the amount was humorously small. The bacon was chewy and the chicken patty was obviously from a frozen box. A friend in the group ordered the Duck Confit Chilaquiles which came with the same tiny amount of meat. That meal will costs $15.  Here we were, totally unsastified and frankly in disbelief that a place would have the balls to charge so much for crap. Had to wait another twenty minutes to get our waitress to tell her we needed out check. There are so many places in the city to have brunch. How could these people really sell themselves as a decent restaurant with prices undeserving of the quality? I spoke with the manager who immediately took off the cost of one of the two OJ's I had to order while waiting for a half hour to feed my kid. Then I told him my complaints about the food. I don't usually ask to speak to a manager because it's always a risk eating at a new restaurant, but again, when you charge me anything more than 10 bucks for frozen food, I have to speak up. He explained the chef had quit and walked out that morning so the kitchen was behind and also assured me NOTHING except the fries were frozen. To this I say, we all had a casual Saturday planned. If our server came out at any point and said hey, we are having issues in the kitchen and are a little behind, no one would have been upset. But we got no word for a half hour. Also, everything was in fact frozen. You can taste the difference with freshness. You can SEE the diffrence. Now, I am certainly not above frozen food, but again, don't eff with me and charge me $13 for it. I live with a chef and know the difference between fresh, crispy bacon and microwaved frozen crap.   All in all, I give this place 2 stars because the manager was understanding and apologetic. As far as the food and service, don't waste your time or money! Go to Nookies. Try Wishbone. Give your money to Meli. But do not come here! They think of their patrons as fools.  Also, their beer was $7 a glass. For a Revolution IPA and most others. That must make up for the high rent they pay for the location",-0.9108,0.873,0.056,0.072,0.4689243725309299

The fact they charge $6 for fries that are exactly the same as McDonalds fries, in a serving on par with McDs medium serve,  was disappointing. We both ordered the pork breakfast sandwich that touted pork sausage, bacon and breaded pork with an egg, lettuce and a white sauce. It became clear as we ate, that the sausage pattie and breaded pork pieces are pre-frozen. The egg was undercooked & I had to scrape clear egg-white away.  The mimosas were pleasant and the staff were friendly and helpful. It was ok, but definitely not worth the Groupon. Won't be eating here again.

The Food - I ordered the French Toast that didn't come with maple syrup... NO MAPLE SYRUP??? and when I asked for syrup the owner said he would have to ask the chef... oh okay yeah let me know if the chef will let me have syrup with my FRENCH TOAST which is as american as apple pie and Ice cream.   **side note - Im still burping up the bloody marry I consumed 6 hours ago which also happened to be the worst Ive ever had. long story short don't waste your money.

But the dear friend of mine who figured that he would use my bookmarks to take me to a new place that I'd like to try was wondering if he had made the right choice. I could see he was nervous, and sweat started pearling on his forehead as if he had just ingested hot curry. I told him to relax. Turned out, The Monarch was a mighty nice surprise for the three of us. We each ordered a drink (the Czarina Alexandra with bubbly and bison grass vodka, and it was PERFECT) and proceeded to destroy the following: - goose foie gras sprinkled with sea salt and ground pepper, served with strawberry preserves and toasted brioche: the best I've had in Chicago, hands down, and a sumptuous pairing to my cocktail. Luscious like butter, a little gamey but not too much, just perfect in every way. - PEI mussels with fresno chiles, fennel and basted in butter to finish off the sauce: nicely done, rich sauce, a little kick to cut off the fat, I finished off the plate by myself and was happy to do so. Too many places don't do mussels right. - fries with truffle mayonnaise. Not truffle oil. TRUFFLE. You could see the little specks of black in there, if you could focus your eyes long enough to do so. I mean, it was so orgasmic that I spent most of the time digging like a robot and closing my eyes. And repeat. The fries were probably not home-made, but I personally didn't care. TRUFFLE. - grilled rainbow trout served on an eggplant and roasted tomato puree, farro and sauce vierge: health option! Yay! I love farro so much. It was well prepared, well balanced, well seasoned....and under $20. - pork blade steak (my two dudes have to hoink it up) covered with charred swiss chard pesto, pickled ramp bulbs, cured lemons and parsley. Excellent cut of meat with bright, green flavors. A favorite at the table. So everything was pretty much perfect, and we were patting ourselves on the back for having been bold and fearless and venture into untraveled lands, until we asked for the dessert menu. I guess there's no pastry chef in the house.....and the only options are ice-cream bars. Like in the annoying truck that drives down your street busting in your eyes ""La Cucaracha"".  That wouldn't do. We left. Thinking about it a bit more, it's probably a good thing. If you cannot do dessert right, just don't do it. We were delighted with our meal, paid the bill and went to the dessert mecca a few blocks away. It was perfect. Also: the bathroom is a work of art.

2013-05-28,5.0,"While planning my visit to Chicago for the first time, I saw Monarch has made a bit of noises in the Chef-centric city.  It is unusual for a gastropub getting attention from Michelin world, considering there is only one pub (in England) that is rated two Michelin stars throughout the entire world.  This restaurant, grand-open with a Chef Brochu, who assisted local Graham Elliot from one star to two stars quit in September 2012.  Joined Monarch in January and five month later departed to the Michelin considered Aviary.  That's all past history. The restaurant is now under the direction from new Chef Michael DeStefano, who worked with Brochu two years prior.   Chef Destefano is a Kansis City native, has brought his own menu to the table. So, it is pretty awesome we stop by Monarch on a short 3-day visit 2 hours before the flight and get to try the new menu.  The previous popular dish drunken bread is no longer offered, but there is a lot to look forward to. For instance, the flank steak is seared to perfection, entirely pink inside, and only few millimeter of burnt mark on the outside is as juicy of meat it can get.  The steak surface is sprinkled with fried garlic plus other spices, accompanied by mache, thin-peeled asparagus, citrus dressing, grated goat cheese, and finished with a chunk of fresh strawberry.   Try beat this dish with a moo'ing cow chewing on grass with a playful mei'ing sheep kicking lemon and strawberry.  Rainbow trout comes de-boned, suspiciously cooked in fat (because it tastes so good), and decorated as a cross.  I highly recommend both dishes. Reading thru the debates whether this place is $$ vs. $$$, I am on budget with dining and I still felt this is properly rated at $$ for the fresh ingredient and culinary part.  I didn't have any cocktail drink since it was our first visit and our server gave us complimentary champagne, I can imagine the bill easily goes for $50 per person when beverage/liquor is involved, but that's just like everywhere else in town.  This is perhaps a question for owner, on defining target for customer which it can be made into specific dating/sportbar/brunch/nightlife, on different given days of the week.  In my opinion, the neighborhood location is best to be made into a group dining place where expansion and overall staffing is required, it'll be interesting to see how the gastropub will evolve over time. Finally, we ordered the Kung Pao wing for the curiosity after tasting the first two wonderful dishes.  Being Asian myself, having the whole dry pepper on top of the wings with sprinkle crushed peanut is a great invention!  We think chef further add Szechuan (Zanthoxylum) pepper which it's not overpowering and gave a great kick to the wings! The couple improvements I can think of here are decoration of the wing dish, and crispiness of the deep-fry, and this dish should file for patent!",0.9962,0.849,0.132,0.02,0.4550157828282828

I ended up paying $7.50 for an Alpha King and listening to a raspy-voiced bartender, who was acting like she was really drunk, shouting over the bar to her friends all night long. She was awful. During commercial and intermission she would put on music and dance and sing with a raspy voice. Then during the game, she would go back to shouting to her friends. I couldn't wait to get out of there. Then a bouncer who apparently works there came in and sat with the bartenders friends. He proceeded to sit there and tell stories, throughout the entire third period, about the girl he hooked up with, which isn't a problem, but to shout them across the bar is just rude and obnoxious.  The wine my girlfriend had was disgusting. I'm not a wine snob, nor do I claim to know anything about wine, other than when I am given a terrible glass. This was undrinkable. Beer prices - $7.50 for an Alpha King and $7 for a Two Hearted is way over priced. There are only a couple of other craft beers on the menu, otherwise you can order a $4 (yes, $4) PBR or other european macro-swill. The beer list sucks and the beer prices suck. Bottom line - I live very close to this place, I have been there twice now, and I will NEVER return. It is awful. Both times, the bartenders have been awful. Beer prices are way to high. The atmosphere is pretentious and the people are very strange and most of them are rude.

The waitress was friendly and when she found out it was our first visit she brought us each a free glass of champagne. I followed this up with a cocktail called the Hilts, which was a combination of whiskey, Bell's Two Hearted Ale and ""smoke."" It was definitely interesting, and it immediately brought to mind the end of a night of too much drinking, when you took that shot you shouldn't have and smoked that cigarette you thought you wanted. Needless to say, I only had one of that particular drink.  We ordered the dill pickle wings as an appetizer, and the were very tasty, but small as every review notes. We also got the bibb lettuce salad to balance out the decadence of the wings and our dinner order. I ended up having the glazed beef short rib, which was perfectly cooked and very filling.  Overall, this was a really good meal, but I'm surprised that this bar is listed as only $$ - for two entrees, two appetizers and two cocktails each the bill easily broke $100, which was a bit surprising and a bit spendy for a place where, as I mentioned, people were loudly cheering TV sports through the entire dinner.

After reviewing the cocktail list, I ordered the Queen Mum, a heavier and sweeter gin drink - perhaps because there was lots of Dubonnet (a very sweet apertif) and little gin.  Due to the size of the drink (it was thimble-sized) and aforementioned atmosphere, I felt the $11 price point was highway robbery.   One bartender in particular was really friendly and helped me feel welcome as I waited for my friend to arrive.  It did take a few minutes, however, until I was presented with a food menu and cocktail list - the bartender had to ask one of the other staff members to hand these items over to me.  The bartender who actually prepared my drink was also very sociable and responsive when I was ready to order a drink and close the tab.

2013-04-16,3.0,"I love nothing more than a good beer and burger, aside perhaps from a restaurant in Wicker Park that does not sport a huge crowd. Thus, I was thrilled to stumble upon the Monarch last week, which allows one to enjoy both of the above. While by no means perfect, the experience was a very serviceable option.  Unfortunately, the beer list is pricey (as you can tell from the outside, where they boast about a $4 PBR ""special""). There's nothing decent on tap under $6.50, but I guess not everywhere can be the Map Room. Burger ($12), served simply with cheddar cheese, tomato, onion, and special sauce, is above average for the city. The patty is somewhat crumbly and thin, and mildly overcooked, but has a nice beef flavor, the bun is soft but not so rich as to steal the show. I have no complaints. Dill pickle wings ($10) are an interesting take on a classic; they have a nice vinegary flavor, and the dill plays along nicely. They are somewhat miniscule in size, but you're given a decent number of them to make up for it.  Pricing is pretty standard, and service is somewhat mixed. There was some awkwardness when I came in; my friend was running 20 minutes behind, and the place was empty, so I asked if I could hold down a table. I was denied and told to sit at the bar, due to restaurant policy of not seating incomplete parties (which I totally understand). However, when my friend arrived, and the place was still empty, we were told that the entire back of the Monarch had ""no tables available"" (even though all were empty, including some which remained empty for the entirety of the meal), and we were offered to keep a seat at the bar or take a window seat. We opted for the bar, and I overheard the hostess tell a colleague that she ""figured that would convince"" us to sit at the bar. I don't know what this was about, but it was offputting to the point that, in retrospect, it was enough to solidify Monarch's status in three-star land. Once we were awkwardly seated, however, the bartender who became our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly.  All in all, The Monarch offers a somewhat above average take on bar food. It's well worth a try, especially if it continues to be so pleasantly accessible. Would I wait in the cold for it, as I've done for Piece, Hot Chocolate, or Big Star?

The waitress asked if we'd been there before and we said, ""no,"" so she said all new guests get a complimentary glass of champagne on the house. Fuck yes. The cocktail menu was themed, Monarchic. They had some unique options and both our drinks were delicious. We then ordered wine. The menu wasn't huge but it was diverse. Starters, a few salads (they looked big), and more game-ish type comfort food (P.S.- there is no grilled chicken on the menu, but they do have a killer looking salmon dish). I has the garlic sausage and pork belly and the BF had duck confit. with shrimp puffs. Both were very, very delicious. And then, there was the ""Ice Cream Truck""... for $2 they bring a little cooler to your table with choices of different ice cream bars you see in 7-11 like Twix and Reese's. But it was just a really fun way to top off the evening.  It's not cheap, but I wouldn't go so far as to say it's expensive. My meal was $17, but the salad I was eyeing was $12.

2013-03-30,3.0,"Here's what I would say; there are reasons that I would return to the Monarch and there are reasons I wasn't completely thrilled with my experience. First and foremost, I have to say our server was fantastic! Petite girl, red hair, about as friendly as could be. They give you a nice little story behind the ""rebirth"" of the bar that was once Uberstein and she did an excellent job making us comfortable with the new setting.  Very attentive without being overtly in-your-face. The manager, Chris, was also very professional and personal when we came in for our reservations. I would suggest making reservations, as they were very packed on Friday night. The food was good, not great. I enjoyed my appetizer more than my meal. We started with the pimento cheese and crostini which was very good; not terribly salty as I have come to expect from pimento cheese dishes. My duck confit on the other hand was VERY salty. It wasn't bad, but I was reaching for my cocktail/water pretty frequently. The shrimp puffs on the side were an interesting pairing, I was surprised to find out those were store bought but I assume they would be a pain to make in house.  I think my biggest issue with The Monarch is the TVs. The ""reinvention"" falls short because the music videos playing on the wall just didn't fit in with everything else going on. They pride themselves on being an Elvis bar (Elvis is everywhere) so if they're going to be so thematic it would only make sense that Elvis was playing on the TVs. (Yes, I know Elvis was pre-music videos). Keep the TVs at the bar and remove the ones over the dining area. I feel like that's an easy compromise. For the record, the music selection wasn't bad...just odd for the space. If you're in the mood to drink something a little of the beaten path, try the Hilts, The Cooler King. Ale, bourbon, and smoke. A nice ""kick in the rear.""",0.985,0.809,0.147,0.045,0.5909132996632995

Carbs be damned: We started with the soft pretzel with beer cheese and the fries with truffle mayonnaise. I don't normally rave, but OMG... the pretzel was hot and fresh and soft and the beer cheese... yeah. Order these. Came with two big pretzels (think a little smaller than one of those big mall pretzels) and we pretty much polished those off. And then saved the cheese for the fries, because they were amazing and the truffle mayo was polished off WAYYYY too quick. I had the salmon, which was great. I was very happy with this. It comes medium rare; I asked for medium but it was still on the med-rare side. That said - still delish, so I assume they know what they're doing there. Balanced well with the potato puree it came with. Dinner companion had the mussels, and loved the broth and the bread, but wasn't a huge fan of the mussels themselves - they were very meaty (some might consider this a plus; she did not) and the texture was off a bit for her. The folks next to us polished off their bucket (yes, bucket - it's a LOT of mussels) and were eyeing ours, so obviously some people were enjoying them quite a bit. Now, for dessert: After apps, wine and the main course, we probably shouldn't have... but they brought around this little cooler they called ""The Ice Cream Truck"" and damn if we didn't have the Reese's and Twix ice cream snacks out in seconds. Same ones you'd buy in the grocery store - nothing special, but somehow perfect. I appreciated the novelty of it, and it was a fun way to end the meal.

2013-03-16,1.0,"Signed up for Yelp just so I could write a review on the Monarch.  I arrived at the Monarch to meet my friend for dinner and drinks on Friday in which she told me she put her name down and it should only be another 10 minutes. About 30 minutes later while sitting at the bar, a very creepy man came up to us to make uncomfortable jokes and offer us shots. I thought this guy was hitting on us, but come to find out he is the manager or owner. He is that type of guy you try to avoid at all costs. He then says that it shouldn't take much longer and that he can't ask patrons to leave their table (which I totally understand).  About another half hour passes and we get a table! Our waitress greets us with 2 glasses of champagne to welcome us which I thought was nice, but just kind of weird since it's a sports bar. Food came - forgettable. The waitress then comes back to not offer us more drinks, but to ask if we want to take a look at their ""ice-cream truck"". She brings over a cooler of ice-cream snickers bars, dove bars and other various bars that they bought at Jewel. So I passed on that. 1 minute later she brings us the check. We probably would have stayed for one more drink but we just went with it and paid.  My friend and I were still enjoying our conversation until the waitress came over to ask us to move to the bar since there were people waiting on tables. How funny since the Manager earlier had told us how they would never do that and also that maybe we were at the table for 25 to 30 minutes.

2013-03-04,1.0,"After my recent experience here, I would whole-heartedly sign a petition to bring the Uberstein back. The fact that I had never once set foot in the Uberstein should tell you exactly how I feel about this place. I'm not sure whether the food or cocktails were more disappointing, but I might lean towards the cocktails because they are $11 each, and I've had better ones at the local VFW Post 7975.  I salute you, grizzled veteran, for being able to make a drink with 2 ingredients with far better results than this wretched concoction of sherry-campari-bitters-chartreuse with a drop of paint thinner masquerading as a ""modern"" twist on something that should never have been imagined, much less created, in the first place. Now, if the food were simply decent, i might have avoided the dreaded 1 star review, but they also managed to completely Munson that up too. The wings are ludicrously small; so miniscule that I wouldn't be surprised to hear about a dire shortage of cornish hens crippling the bottom line of Jewel's across the neighborhood. And not only that, I guess their idea of ""classing"" up such a staple appetizer is to completely disregard unnecessary components like crispy breading/skin and sauce. From what I can gather, the Monarch believes the best way to serve up chicken wings is to throw them in a vat of dry rub and then shake'n'bake the soul out of 'em. I'm actually surprised I wasn't offered chopsticks as my utensil of choice to consume these unrecognizable, retarded offspring of such a glorious bar tradition. The rest of the meal succeeding in living down to the vast disappointment of the opening course. The french onion soup was basically a gooified salt lick, the burger was edible yet entirely forgettable, and the mussels, oh my, the mussels...Let's just say that we all know what bad mussels taste like, so no amount of broth will ever mask the sensation that you are literally eating a bucket  full of crustaceous-flavored turds. Now, finding only 1 or 2 of these palate wreckers might offer a passing grade, but on this night, the Monarch transformed my taste buds into a veritable septic tank. Thankfully my stomach has the consitution of a locomotive, but I fear for the next poor sap who might be ""adventurous"" enough to choose this item as an ""out of the comfort zone"" pick. Instead of patting himself on the back for his cosmopolitan refinement, he'll be spending the rest of the night washing his mouth out with month old forgotten brining solution specifically made for necks'n'gizzards...because that would still taste better than forcing down lumps of mussel manure.

I don't think I've been to a place with TVs and set up like a neighborhood bar, but still offering a menu as mature and thoughtful as Monarch's.  The look and feel of the place is definitely more chill than the predecessor Uberstein.  While we were having dinner, we were serenaded by the musical stylings of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, De La Soul, Shiny Toy Guns, Rick James, Florence & the Machines and many more eclectic music videos.  Talk about variety! So on to the important stuff...  We started with the dill wings and the drunken bread.  I had never before thought ""gee dill wings sound swell"" but lots of the reviewers here recommended them - the wings are small in size (which to me is a good thing because it means they probably weren't pumped with hormones) yet plentiful.  I really enjoyed the dill sauce, in fact I really don't know why they serve the wings with ranch dressing.  I tried a little on one and it totally killed it for me - the sauce alone was good enough. And ahhhhhh... the drunken bread.  Holy mother of dragons.  If my wife wouldn't have punched me in the face I would have licked the bowl they serve it in.  Let me break it down for you.  You take some french onion soup, then you add some sausage to it, then you drown it in some booze (beer I think?  it is a great touch), then you sprinkle in some awesome-sauce and voila!  You have yourself some bomb-ass drunken bread. We shared an entree - the garlic sausage with pork belly, cabbage and candied mustard seed.  The garlic sausage was tasty but on it's own was a little lacking in some way - unfortunately I can't really put my finger on it, but combined with the cabbage it reminded me almost of Oktoberfest garlic-ified.  It was good but not stellar.  But the pork belly was fantastic - it melts like butter in your mouth!

The cocktail I had - Place de la Concorde - sounded incredible, but was too small and too sweet. Their grilled tomato soup is essentially scorching ketchup. Dill wings (small, pale and altogether unappetizing) are a bad idea. There is a reason why you don't see this type of wing offered at other restaurants. Soft Pretzel - this was ok, but nothing to rave about. My main dish was the ""Duck Confit, Cucumber, Scallion, Cilantro, Shrimp Puff, $17""   Here is what I was served:  Duck (which was so salty and sauced that I'm not convinced it was really duck) served on a piece of toast with suspect white sauce in between.  Mayo most likely. I recall a cucumber, but don't remember any scallion or cilantro. What was labeled a Shrimp Puff looked more like fried pork rinds. They were tasteless. We were seated in the back by the kitchen which is generally enjoyable, but not in this case. It was awkward hearing the chefs yell ""food runner!!"" at the wait staff.

My daughter had the fried green tomato sandwich.  The whole reason that we trekked to The Monarch on a cold, icy Sunday night was for this sandwich.
