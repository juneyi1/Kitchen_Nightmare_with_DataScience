It was tasty even without salsa, and yummy with salsa verde.  2- Sweet Potato Al Pastor with Chorizo and Cream. (I enjoyed this, but feel the potatoes were too large. If they diced them smaller, I would be more of a fan for sure. I want sweet potato and chorizo in my mouth together with each bite. If you have a huge bite of sweet potato, it just isn't as good...at all.)  3- I had a Chicken taco, and it was ok, but definitely needed some more spice for my liking.

2015-02-08,1.0,"*Edit* I was this place's biggest fan when it first opened.  It became my go-to taco spot in a neighborhood filled with taco joints. The original owner was great and passionate about the food and the customers.  Not the case now, used to get tortillas made fresh for every taco now they make them ahead of time and reheat, the quesadillas are made from package tortillas, they got rid of a lot of stuff on the menu, and it just doesn't have the same feel.  The employees couldn't care less.  Too bad to see one of my favorite spots go downhill, I feel foolish recommending this place to so many people.   I love the tacos here.  I love a good lengua taco, and this place has perfectly cooked lengua.  You're not going to get sour cream and other BS Americanized taco toppings.  Fresh tortillas made to order.  The cactus salad is also really solid.  I haven't had anything bad there.  They even carry some great apple fritters from the south side.  Check them out!  Cash only, but there is an ATM inside.",0.9439,0.817,0.144,0.039,0.5787878787878787
2015-02-07,5.0,"So freakin' good!  Delicious, fresh, quick, and authentic as the name implies. Tortillas made by hand through the day in the front window. All the employees are super friendly. The chicharron and lengua are outstanding, although everything they make is good.  If you're hungry, the quesadilla is more food for your money vs. tacos.  (They also make burritos, which are not listed on the menu.)  I live nearby, probably been ten times since they opened and can't get enough.  I am excited that they will soon finish enclosing the rear patio to provide some seating.

2015-01-30,3.0,We really had high hopes for this place before it opened and have unfortunately only been there once. I got beef tacos which I really liked and thought we comparable to the place south of here at Chicago Ave. My wife does not do spicy at all. Her chicken taco was so spicy that she couldn't eat it. I didn't believe her but then tried it and it was actually spicy. Keep it consistent across all tacos so we can add our own level of heat!!,0.452,0.926,0.054,0.02,0.605
2015-01-22,5.0,"Best taco spot in the area.  Don't waste your time across the street.  Authentaco tacos are somewhere between what the classic taco shops and the new school taco shops (Antique Taco, Big Star) are doing.  I think it works well.   The service here is really friendly, but their food is just wonderful.  You can watch them stamping out the fresh tortillas as you order.  They have a great mix of the classics (carne asada, barbacoa, tongue, etc), but they also have specials that put a twist on classics.  Last time I was in I got the pastor with sweet potatoes.  I previously has a ""farmer's market"" taco that had some greens, veggies, and bacon.  Both were great.  For the classics, the tongue taco is my favorite.   I live close by and I will visiting at least a couple times per month.",0.9885,0.774,0.226,0.0,0.456534090909091

2014-12-26,5.0,Honestly great tacos. If you like homemade tortillas and chargrilled steak this is the spot. Even if you're a vegetarian( which I try to be but this place tempted me into my old ways) you'll enjoy a great selection of vegetarian tacos. Try huitlacoche tacos( it's a type of mexican mushroom that grows in corn). It's delicious! Unlike other places who just give you beans or cheese if your a vegetarian Autentaco takes the time to sauté grilled veggies and make an actual meal for vegeratarians. Also try the Jamaica water( hibiscus ) it tastes awesome just like everything else!,0.9859,0.736,0.264,0.0,0.5194444444444445

The menu has tostadas,  quesadillas,  tacos, and elote as well as the options for sides like salsa, guacamole,  and the like. Their horchata is pretty good, not the best, but good. They also have a good selection of non meat items for the vegetarians. The four stars are because the people working there were quite nice, it appeared to be kept clean, the service was pretty quick, and the quality of the food tasted pretty good. Now that I live in the neighborhood,  I want to try some of the other taquerias,  but I wouldn't pass up Authentaco.",0.9874,0.694,0.29,0.016,0.675
2014-11-26,4.0,"Great little taqueria! The outside is cute and it has a nice, updated look overall. There are no seats inside, so this is takeout only, at least in the winter - they do have a front and back patio for summer.  Also, this is cash only, but there is an ATM inside, so no big deal. As for the important part - the food! The tortillas are handmade, and very tasty. I usually dislike handmade toritillas due to the thickness (they can be very  chewy, heavy, and thick) but these were soft and pillowy and did not detract from the flavor of the tacos. I have not tried their whole menu (yet....) but I did try 4 different taco flavors - the al pastor, chicken, rajas poblanos, and the chorizo sweet potato, which was the special of the day.  Each of the proteins on the menu are available as either tacos, quesadillas, and/or tostadas. The al pastor was the best, spicy, sweet and singed on the outside just as it should be. Everything else was good as well - you can't beat fresh, properly cooked ingredients. I am a big fan of authentic Mexican food, and this place manages to serve that while incorporating some updated, chef-driven flavors.  Mmm... can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!",0.9792,0.805,0.151,0.044,0.4563265306122449

2014-11-12,2.0,"I was really excited to try this place, the decor was great and hand made tortillas is always a plus so with enthusiasm I went, I ordered the rajas, al pastor, and carne asada tacos, and shared chips and salsa with my boyfriend. I was disappointed with the Alpastor because the meat was very sweet and with the carne asada it was under season, the rajas was the better tasting of the three. I did order an orchata, I couldn't get past a bitter after taste, I didn't figure out what they might have fused it with but it taste like when milk goes bad ( I am well aware there's no milk in an orchata) but that's the way I can describe the taste to you. The owner was so friendly and I hope they are just working out the kinks of a new restaurant, but I wouldn't come back. The tortillas are awesome but in my opinion the price point of these tacos are over priced for the taste. as always its just my opinion and if you try hope your experience is better.",0.986,0.739,0.215,0.046,0.5511580086580087
