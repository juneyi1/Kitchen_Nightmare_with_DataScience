When the food arrived it looked great and tasted great but shortly afterwards 3 of the 4 of us started not feeling too good.  Our stomachs started feeling pretty queasy. We spent the next day not feeling great at all.  I called the restaurant and they were kind enough to refund our money.

The menu has remained relatively unchanged since I was a kid - and why change it too much when you have great barbecue. I had a combo plate with baby back ribs, brisket, and pork belly. All three were savory and really fulfilled my taste for barbecue. The sides are delicious too, great slaw and potato salad.

2016-07-21,1.0,"I drove past this place and was intrigued. Being a BBQ aficionado, I was looking forward to it. My buddy and I came in tonight, Tuesday, and were happy it wasn't packed.  That being said, the menu looked good and certainly not devoid of choices. Our waitress, was friendly enough, but not super attentive, being not busy. She recommended the wings. The wings are the only reason Dino got any stars.  Big, juicy, full of flavor and nice presentation. They were even better than the wings from Barn & Company, which is hard to beat. I ordered the Pork 3-way. 15 minutes later I am told that the sausage will take another 25 minutes. So I ordered the Big Ass pork plate. Not impressed at all.  Ugly plastic dish, and two small ice cream scoop sized meats. Now, normally when you order brisket, it comes sliced. I got what looked like two servings of pulled pork. Flavor was ok, but there were off little crouton like things on top of each serving. I ordered mini wedge and collard greens. Wedge should have come with blue cheese dressing; what I got was an unattractive tannish brown dressing that tasted like Thousand Island, surely not blue cheese.  Greens were soupy and not very good. Service was weak, not awful, but out water was not filled as often I would have liked, had to ask for refills. My buddy had the ribs. Good, but not great. He's a Mac n cheese fan. Meh, that's al not great. Chucks BBQ in Burbank is the place to go for that, hands down. Lily Q and Barn & Co have really good Mac as well. I have to say that I don't expect this place to be around long, especially with what they. Ha the for what you are served. Too pricey for less that mediocre food.  We have you a shot, and you failed to meet our expectations. Good luck & I hope you can turn it around. We won't be back. Cheers Update; Ha Ha!

2016-07-20,2.0,"Admittedly,  I went on their last night before closing, so things were likley to be a bit off, but here is my take on why this place failed.  Food: Had the wings with the hottest sauce/rub option, which were hot, but bizarrely salty in a commercial 2nd rate chain restaurant way. Guess that has been found by some marketing company to increase the bar tab by some fraction in markets where there is 1-2 BBQ joints in the area, but the effect on sophisticated major market clientele is to go elsewhere, it would appear. Also had the Brisket and Pulled Pork Sliders. Meat of both was dry. 3 sauces were provided. The Habenero one I tried was average w/ only a slight kick. Location: on Weed St. was poor with no validated parking, that I know of. BBQ is not exactly what most want before a night of clubbing.  Positives: Happy hour specials were good ($4 beers, discount cocktails and $5 ap's). Service at the bar was friendly and prompt.",0.9612,0.785,0.155,0.059,0.4962962962962963

But the Dino portabello was well-cooked, topped with strips of roasted jalapeno, and served between toasty buttery buns. The coleslaw had a nice peppery kick. And the corn bread was soooo good!  There were a couple of options for BBQ sauce on the table, but the Chipotle hot sauce is where it's at. The service was fast, attentive, and friendly.

I ordered the 3-meat plate. * Chicken was fantastic.  Juicy and tender.  Loved this. * Ribs were okay, but one side seemed completely nuked, giving me a weird mouth feel when biting down.  The meat itself was tender. * The hot link sausage was disgusting.  I've had hot links at nearly every BBQ place I can and this stuff was nasty.  Huge letdown. My table also ordered the sampler plate - Hacked Jerk Rib (weird rib ends; skip this and get legit ribs), Chicken Wings (pretty good), Fried Green Tomatoes and Deviled Eggs (didn't eat the last two). The sauces on the table seemed more sweet than spicy.  I tried several and wasn't really a fan. My favorite BBQ in the city is Q BBQ (714 W Diversey).  That's a place where the meats, the sides and the sauces jump together in the same rhythm.  Dinosaur kinda stumbles around with two left feet.

It was fairly early so we basically had the place to ourselves, no reservation needed. Restaurant is large open space with plenty of varied seating arrangements with kitchen in the rear. Upon walking in there is a huge bar that dominates one of the walls. Restrooms are upstairs. We found a cozy booth and started dissecting the extensive menu. Our server was patient and informative and provided some recommendations.  I shared the deal for two which consists of a full rack of St. Louis style (dry rubbed, smoked and lightly glazed with bbq sauce) ribs, four sides and corn bread. Note: a full rack has 12 ribs. The ribs were super tender and their dry rub was exceptional, no extra sauce needed. For those folks that dislike ribs swimming in sauce these are for you. The four sides we chose were french fries (fresh cut with skins on), curried cauliflower and sweet potato, mac & cheese, and the side of the day which was cajun corn. My favorite side was surprisingly the cajun corn, which was simple and extremely flavorful. The curried cauliflower and sweet potato was decent and had a rich curry flavor. The fries were crispy and the mac & cheese was ok, nothing to brag about. The highlight of the evening were the ribs!! I would say I have a large appetite and I was more than stuffed even skipping an appetizer.  Others in the party were equally satisfied with their dishes (combo meals, smoked chicken wings, brisket, bbq fried rice, house made sauces) as well. Everyone left content and wanting more.

The pulled pork we found mushy and slightly flavorless - needed more sauce. The brisket was fine, although a little more lean than I like my brisket. My complaint with it was that it served with jalapeños on top, which I don't like, so it masked the flavor of the meat. The hot link was definitely the best.  The wings were really flavorful but were SPICY. We got wango tango and the garlic chipotle. We couldn't necessarily tell the difference between the two flavors and they weren't labeled but after 4 wings our mouths were on fire. My husband has a relatively high tolerance for spice as well and even he was coughing. The price of the wings was a little steep too - 13 for $14. I've had better wings for less without having to lose feeling in my mouth. If you love spicy food, you might enjoy the wings more than I did.

I ordered the Original BBQ platter (as opposed to the sandwich) and ended up with the Big Ass Pork Plate, which was $5.50 more and a bit more food than I wanted,  I didn't realize the error though until the check came and most of the food was already eaten. :(  The pork and fries were pretty good, but I had no idea what the pork belly cracklin was in my pork since that wasn't what I ordered, so that threw me a bit! The cole slaw was creamy and delicious.  The fried green tomatoes that we started with stole the show in my opinion.  Really tasty!  The cocktails I tried were overpriced and overly sweet.

2015-10-16,5.0,"The barbecue ribs are among the best in the country, and everything on the menu is incredible. Even my pescatarian girlfriend enjoyed it thanks to the fried green tomatoes, deviled eggs, and drunken spicy shameless shrimp! Dinosaur BBQ was started by a biker who traveled around the nation on his motorcycle and combined the best recipes from around the nation to create an all-encompassing barbecue heaven.  I've been enjoying their food since they opened in Syracuse, NY many, many years ago, and though I travel extensively for work - including many trips to Texas, St Louis, and more - I have yet to find better ribs. The barbecue beans are also without equal. One secret - mix 4 parts regular BBQ sauce with 1 part Devil's Duel habanero sauce for a spicy BBQ sauce that tastes phenomenal on Dinosaur's homemade French fries. Plus it's fun to have a dipping sauce for them! Note: Sometimes you have to ask for the Devil's Duel sauce. I can't remember if Chicago is one of the places that keeps it on the table or not, but they'll bring it out for free if you ask. Their Cajun seasoning is also unbelievable, to the point where I refuse to buy another Cajun seasoning. I no longer live near a Dinosaur BBQ location, so I order the Cajun seasoning on Amazon whenever I'm running low. It makes the bet blackened chicken in the world and can be mixed with Montreal Steak Seasoning to create a mouth-watering steak rub. Any review that suggests the meat is ""average"" was done by someone without taste buds. Dinosaur BBQ is one of the few places that can live up to my extreme hype. Every time I go I am blown away - including the Chicago location. The service and food lived up to the standards of Dinosaur BBQ, and I believe it to be the best BBQ in the USA - a title the original location actually won courtesy of NBC's today show a few years ago.",0.9878,0.829,0.137,0.033,0.4645787545787547

It was definitely too dry. Brisket on the leaner side and ""dry"" don't necessarily have to be synonymous, as barbecue fans know, so I think they could stand to revise their smoking process to make it a little more juicy. I also suspect they might add liquid smoke to the preparation, because there was a distinct artificial smoky taste that I've never tasted before, but I could very well be mistaken.  The chicken wing was fatty and the skin was loose, but the jerk sauce was alright. The collards were too sweet. The rice was pretty close to commendable. Mostly everything was mediocre, not HORRIBLE but definitely not good.  Also, I sat near a register, and two waitresses were complaining audibly about a customer's request for extra pickles?

Our waitress was knowledgeable of the menu and had several recommendations; table speed was super and our drinks always were filled.  The restaurant is loud, but not offensively.

The food is eye-candy on the menu: We ordered the pick-two combo with an assortment of ribs, pulled pork and brisket, and sides of coleslaw, macaroni and cheese, and baked beans. Here's a breakdown: - Pulled pork: Favorite; hot; excellent. - Brisket: Average; warm, but not hot. Dry. - Baked beans: Tasted canned, not good. - Mac: Enjoyable. - Cornbread: Gross, tasteless and dry. - Coleslaw: Creamy, nice.  - Ribs: Piping hot; odd chewy chunks on parts. But our biggest point to highlight was the wide temperature spread of several foods. The brisket died within a few minutes of hitting the table, and the pulled pork sooner than that.

I was happy that they let us mix in such a small quantity so we could try a couple of different sauces not many places to do that. We also ordered the Cajun deviled eggs, 3 in an order just to give them a try and I'm so glad we did the Cajun spice was not overwhelming at all and they really were not spicy to me. For our entree we got the pick 3 and went with ribs brisket and pulled pork with sides of salt potatoes and mac and cheese. This is where I was let down a bit, the brisket was  on point smoked to perfection with just a bit of a fat rim to provide just enough juiciness and topped with jalapenos for an extra kick, the pulled pork was a close second but a little but try not too much, but I did have to add a little more sauce, where they lost me was the ribs very tough and dry, almost inedible. I'm not sure if it was because it was close to the end of the night or if they always taste that way but I've had far better ribs at other spots. I like the decor, service, and overall vibe of this place and would definitely come back for the brisket and cocktails just not sure about anything else mac and cheese was good but nothing to write home about and the salt potatoes were delicious but anything is delicious when you cover it with salt and butter :-)  better luck next time D-Bbq",0.9879,0.835,0.125,0.04,0.5319444444444444
2015-07-21,2.0,"So my hubby was desperate to check this place out, so it being his birthday I thought I should oblige. We went in on Saturday at 2pm and the place was deserted. It was us and one other couple dining. There were tons of staff just hanging around and at some points kind of acting up (I guess they were bored) So the food here is average at best. It came out super quickly, but I'm not sure that's actually a good thing? (it hints at microwave cooking). Pulled Pork - Not bad, but I've had better. It was also lukewarm at best Coleslaw - Would have been nice but it was on my plate which had been heated to about  1000 degrees so began to separate and cook.....not great Mac - Meh. Lukewarm and Kraft-like Curried Sweet Potato - actually pretty nice however, it was definitely microwaved and badly to boot- some of it was pipping hot, some of it was cold  Pork Belly - Not bad. My hubby enjoyed it. Beans- not good. Tasteless yet salty.....go figure Cornbread - not great Wango Tango Sauce - love this stuff. It was also a godsend for making the mediocre food more palatable. Perhaps they need to spend less time heating the plates to the temperature of the sun and more time making sure they serve food hot....... Also the service wasn't great. Will not be visiting again. I'll stick to one of the numerous independent BBQ joints in the city that outshine this one - Smoque for instance.",0.9964,0.689,0.243,0.068,0.6555555555555556

2015-07-13,2.0,"WOW!! That is the best way to describe my ""dinner"" at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que.  I was pretty excited to try Dino as I love BBQ and it is close to my work.  I went after work with some co-workers.  We had used Open Table to ensure that we would have a reservation and when we got there, they had no idea we were coming.  That is ok, no worries, we were seated promptly by the hostess.  He was very kind and made sure we had a big enough table.   We were seated at a good table and then came our server, Melissa.  I am still in shock at how unprofessional and awkward she was.  She suggested we have the Family Dinner, however, we just wanted some appetizers and drinks and she was flabbergasted that we were not going to eat dinner as if it was offensive we were not eating a giant meal.  She asked us what drinks we wanted and carded everyone except the youngest person at our table (22 years old).  Our drinks took about 15 minutes to arrive along with some waters.  We then decided to order our appetizers which she proceeded to sit at our table with us while taking the order, yes she sat down in a seat and took our order.  We asked if we could exchange an part of the appetizer with a portabella mushroom instead of the chicken wings because we had a vegetarian in our party, in which she responded...""you are at a BBQ restaurant and you don't eat meat?"" A little rude in my eyes.  We ordered the 2 sampler platters that came with fried green tomatoes (they don't have meat in them), Chicken wings, ribs, and deviled eggs (again they don't have meat in them). She did come around 3 times to ask us for more drinks and took 5 of our 8 plates...not sure why she didn't take all of them.  We then asked for our check in which we divided in half.  While we were signing the credit card slip she stood over us and waited for it...again weird!  When we handed the slips to her, she then proceeded to stand by our table looking at the credit card slips and I am assuming her tip and looked disgusted that her tip was not more.  We stayed around for a few more minutes finishing our drinks, only to see her go to the hostess and talk about us while she pointed at us.  Again, super unprofessional.

2015-07-11,4.0,"Arrived with a pack of hungry hippos on a Sunday night with my table reservation ready for me! This sets the tone for an enjoyable meal.  Among four children and two adults, we went for the full experience with appetizer, barbecue platter, and dessert. The sausage, cheese, and cracker plate was tasty but it was about one bite per person. The crackers were regular Ritz. The highlight is the house smoked hot link and homemade pimento cheese. The cheese has a distinct taste. It's peppery and sharp which added an extra kick when paired with the link.  For the family style barbecue platter, we had mac n cheese, fries, cole slaw, one whole chicken, one full rack of pork ribs, half pound of beef brisket, half pound of pulled pork, and corn bread. That one long list of items came to a total of $75 and we had plenty of leftovers. The sides were standard with nothing to bring home about. The highlight was the ribs and brisket. The ribs are made a la St. Louis style meaning they were marinated for several hours and slow smoked over hickory wood until the meat gently falls off the bone. There are two things to take note of. On the underside, look for the crackling meat-candy skin. On the interior, look for the pink smoke ring. With all of that, you have some legitimately amazing ribs. The briskets, on the other hand, came in thick slices topped with pickled jalapeno. Each bite seeped of moist, peppery juices. These two items will be my main focuses when I revisit.  We were pretty stuffed but we couldn't possibly neglect dessert. We ordered three items and shared in pairs. While the kids had the key lime pie and chocolate icebox pie, my brother and I had the dino cheesecake. With a heavy usage of sour cream, this slice of cheesecake was dense, rich, smooth, and creamy. It was very enjoyable and I wouldn't attempt to gorge it on my own. Will I return? YES!",0.9949,0.858,0.142,0.0,0.5235311355311357

2015-07-09,4.0,"Last year at the Windy City Smokeout, among Chicago and Texas BBQ joints, Dinosaur's offerings were by far the best thing I ate all day. The boyfriend and I had been tracking their opening in Chicago and were so pumped to visit when they finally opened. We easily made a reservation for a Friday night for four. Upon arrival, we grabbed a drink at the bar while waiting for our table. Dinosaur has a large bar menu and selection of liquors. The Weed St. Sidecar was our cocktail of choice.  Dinosaur definitely has some inventive menu items. I would highly recommend starting with their wings. The Wango Tango sauce is pretty delicious and the finish on the grill adds a great taste. For dinner, we were all trying to sample as many meats and sides as possible. Went with the ribs and BBQ brisket Pick 2, which ended up being a solid decision. The ribs are fall of the bone, saucy, and tender. Definitely the star here. Brisket is by far my favorite BBQ meat, but unfortunately, I was not blown away at Dinosaur. It was definitely tasty, but not as tender or juicy as others in the city. In addition to typical sides, Dinosaur has some unique offerings. I went with the classic slaw, which is a ""must"" with BBQ in my book. For my second side, I had the BBQ fried rice which deserves a big thumbs up. Love that Dinosaur adds some quirks like this into their menu. Others I was dining with enjoyed the chicken and mac n' cheese. As a side note, we had a celiac diner with us and our waiter was very helpful. The kitchen was definitely accommodating. Overall, a welcome addition to the BBQ scene in Chicago. It definitely feels slightly commercial in there, you're not getting the ""hole in the wall"" feel. However, you're in Lincoln Park and they have a huge bar space.

Their meat has a distinct smoky flavor which you can definitely taste in each bite. My friend's favorite was the brisket. My ribs were really thick and quite tasty. They were St. Louis style with a dry rub instead of wet sauce. I ate about half of it the way it came and then tried some of the sauces on the table. Everything was pretty good so I would recommend giving the different sauces a try! I got mac n cheese and bbq fried rice as sides. The mac was pretty solid while the bbq fried rice was really good.

Regardless, the service was friendly & attentive, and the overall decor of the place was clean and neat. Seeing as we weren't planning to down every meat imaginable, we each settled for a BBQ sandwich. One brisket & one pulled pork. Now I'm no BBQ connoisseur and unfortunately haven't had the opportunity to try some proper BBQ, but found the sandwiches pretty tasty. However, one word clearly describes the flavor profile of the meat. Smoke. Both the brisket and the pork were extremely smokey. While I did find the smoke on the onset rather tasty, it ended up presenting itself as a monotonous flavor. Even slathering the meat with BBQ sauce couldn't offset the lingering smoke taste. My girlfriend found the smoke too strong and couldn't eat much of her sandwich. Aside from the smoke, both the brisket & pork were juicy and tender; albeit the pork was a bit fatty. There also is a good selection of sides that come with your sandwiches and plates. We tried the BBQ fried rice; which was nothing special; and the Mac & Cheese, which was a good accompaniment to the meat. Overall, a decent BBQ place.

The rest of the staff was all very friendly and playful, which is great but not enough for me to come back when the food does absolutely nothing.  NONE of the sides are decent. Most of them are really bland in flavor and kind of mismatched to the meaty mains. The bbq fried rice and cole slaw were both flavorless. The curry cauliflower and seer potatoes has flavor but nothing special for a curry. It also did not go well with the bbq meats. My sister said the Mac N Cheese was good but nothing special. That's a dish that ms pretty difficult to mess up. And according my stepdad the bakes beans should have been more flavorful. The ribs were definitely the best part of the meal, but certainly not outstanding. Also, the bbq sauces they serve aren't very memorable. The portions aren't exactly generous for the price.

I went with the BBQ pulled pork sandwich and the mini wedge salad on the side.  The salad is a great idea but the dressing was a bust...and, when you say ""iceberg"" lettuce and it's this cold, you really mean it!  The sandwich, however, was amazing and the pork was lathered in some of the best BBQ sauce I've had in town.  The chocolate cream pie dessert was also very good, albeit a little on the small side for the portions I was expecting. Other parts of the menu were up and down.  My dad (in town from Rochester for fathers' day) seemed to like the ribs--he had a full rack--but he's a bigger fan of the Sticky Lips BBQ ribs back in Rochester, so he's doing less ribs at Dinosaur these days up there.  I tried a moonshine-infused lemonade cocktail that was so light on booze I'm not sure I got the boozy version of it.  The cornbread on my wife's plate seemed to be left for dead and the beans were just average; the french fries were pretty good on my daughter's kid plate but the chicken tenders were also just average. I was generally happy with my food but I need to explore a second round of it to be sure this wasn't a mirage.  Also, the space here is huge and there's a full-scale party room/floor on the second level so I'm sure they do a ton of private parties up there.  Lots of beer on tap in the main bar area downstairs as well.  Very loud here so it's perfect for kids.  Prices are a little high for the amount of food you get, but those prices are on par for the neighborhood so I can't fault the ownership too much (just know, if you eat at Smoque and then drive to Dinosaur the next day for dinner, the sticker shock will be tough).",0.9967,0.791,0.187,0.022,0.5305960648148147

2015-06-17,2.0,"Definitely was not impressed. Don't get me wrong, nothing was offensive, but nothing was really good either. Perhaps some of the yelp reviews got our expectations set too high, or it could be because I am from NC and compare all BBQ to Woodlands BBQ, or it could be because Dinosaur BBQ is going through some growing pains having an outpost in Chicago.  My biggest complaint was that my dinner, the 2 meat combo with 1/4 chicken (thigh and leg) and pulled pork with beans and fries came out covered in sauce. I personally prefer my smoked meats dry and with the variety of sauces on the table, it just didn't make sense to me to bring out something sauced. Neither the pulled pork or the chicken were particularly smoky, the fries tasted old and stale (they tasted like cold fries taste but were on the warm side) and the beans were over-seasoned with I don't know what. The sweet tea didn't taste like tea at all, just sugar water. I would say my favorite part of the entire meal was the buttermilk ranch that came with our appetizer sampler platter.  Dinosaur BBQ got our money once, but probably won't get it again. There's much better BBQ in the city and I can make better fried green tomatoes and Joe can smoke better chicken.",0.9723,0.81,0.144,0.047,0.6173188405797102

2015-06-16,5.0,"Fantastic. If I could award six stars, I would. From the flavor-packed, oversized (2-hour smoked) wings to the perfectly-cooked pulled pork, Dinosaur BBQ is on a different level entirely. Chicago is known for a lot of things. Yet sadly, great barbecue is not one of them. This Syracuse, NY staple is helping change that by opening its doors earlier this year. The menu is loaded with all the southern favorites, both on the meat side as well as the sides. My favorite must-have is their sampler appetizer for two. 2 each of their signature wings, deviled eggs, fried green tomatoes and rib tips. In the BBQ dinner world, a little taste of everything is important, without spending a fortune. And Dinosaur delivers this for just $13 (or $6.50 a person when sharing). Whether you want their brisket, pork, sausage, chicken, ribs or lamb on a slider, wrap, sandwich or by itself, all options are available. Service is exceptionally incredible at this location and their draft beer list hits 20 (!!!) taps. Amen to you, Dinosaur gods. Just an absolutely delectable spot with so much going for it. Prices are on-point, all around. Get over to Weed Street soon, is my opinion. You won't know what hit you(r stomach).",0.9722,0.843,0.133,0.024,0.635

The food, however, was delicious.  I don't like ribs that are too dry or too saucy and they were perfect.  Everything was very tasty.  The restaurant is fun and our server was very nice, helpful, and friendly.  They have an interesting drink selection too.  I will be back but will probably order differently...perhaps a half slab of ribs next time!",0.9844,0.746,0.214,0.039,0.4629629629629629
2015-06-14,2.0,"So I was very disappointed in Dinosaur BBQ. Perhaps it was the fogginess of old, very positive memories, or perhaps it was the struggles of translating a great local place into a national brand.  But either way this BBQ was just meh. I've been to the original Dinosaur BBQ in Syracuse (see my previous review).  It was awesome and the ribs were tender, juicy, and filled with smokey goodness.  The ribs at the new place were tough and the smokey flavor was more......industrial.  I actually thought perhaps they had not been smoked on-site and had been reconstituted once in the restaurant.  I was told they run their own smokers 24x7 and that they are smoked on-site.  If that is the case they may need to talk with their wood supplier - the flavor was not right. Not much else to say really.  The sides were fine.  The service pleasant.  The room did not have the quirky comfort of the old place, it was definitely a more homogenized version.  As chain restaurants go, I suppose this place was ok.  As Dinosaur BBQ from Syracuse goes, this place was disappointing.",0.9567,0.797,0.144,0.059,0.5713485789572745

With any luck, like it's namesake, this place too will become extinct. Went this past Saturday afternoon mid-afternoon and the place was mostly empty. Asked to sit outside as we saw there were plenty of tables open and we were told to wait 5 minutes until they could get on ready. When we were seated our server was right on us. I didn't even have my leg swung over the picnic table bench and he was asking us what we'd like to drink. I appreciate promptness but can I sit down and look at the beer list first? He then disappeared... Draft list is nothing to write home about. They did have a good bloody mary though (homemade) so +1 for that. But on to the food. Oh how God-awful it was. Started with the ""jumbo"" chicken wings done Korean style. If these are jumbo I'd hate to see how small they regular ones are. They were wings. No more, no less. Tasty so at least there's that. But then things went downhill fast. Wife had a pulled pork sandwich which was so dry no amount of sauce was going to save it. I think the pork was actually burnt. I'm all about char but there's char and there's burnt. this was burnt. I had the combo platter with brisket and ribs. Both were nearly inedible. I know brisket is a fatty meat but there was no meat to really be found. And the ribs were filled with grissel and also very fatty. meat was very hard to come by. Both were already heavily sauced in their mediocre flavorless bbq sauce. How sad. What if I didn't want sauce? Who the hell pre-sauces bar-b-que?! The sides were also blah. They are supposed to be known for their mac and cheese yet the stuff you make in a box is better. This was dry and bland except for the paprika they put on it. Thank goodness for that or else is would have been completely flavorless. Cole slaw was decent so props for that. Then our server. Man was he a space cadet. I honestly thought he was stoned. he floated over once to see how we were doing and when we asked for things like more napkins or water, he just disappeared...  Wow. There is a lot of hype about this place and I can't understand why. Needless to say I will not be returning.

2015-06-08,2.0,"I couldn't decide between 2 or 3 stars but the ""Meh. I've experienced better."" description for 2 is really most accurate. Dino BBQ could not have been a more mediocre experience if it tried.  Triple dated here with some friends recently and while nothing was out of this world bad, nothing was out of this world good either. Perhaps the ease with which we got a Friday evening reservation for 6 should have been a sign (along with the fact that it was not packed at all while we were there).  We started with some appetizers--wings and deviled eggs. The eggs I don't even really remember so I'm guessing they were fine, but not anything special. The wings were probably one of the better parts of the entire meal. We ordered them in Korean Glaze and Wango Tango; I preferred the latter.  For our main, we decided to go with the Family Style option. They state it serves 4-6, but I think up to 8 could easily share the platter and sides (especially if you get appetizers too). We were all really excited about the chicken, ribs, 1/2lb pork, and 1/2lb brisket, especially when they arrived on a huge board, but everything just fell kind of flat. None of it was bad, but it just wasn't anything special either. The chicken also wasn't really cut into enough pieces for everyone to share and try.  The three sides we chose were: BBQ fried rice, mac and cheese, and potato salad. All were fine and sizable, but the BBQ fried rice were--hands down--the best part of this entire meal. If I ever had to go back, that is what I would order as my main. The cornbread was forgettable.  As far as service goes, our waiter was friendly BUT 1. did not write things down, which meant that he forgot my drink and then also had to come back to ask what our sides were again and 2. didn't really go into any of the favorites or sauces or anything even though we had all said it was our first time there.

2015-06-02,4.0,"I was expecting the theme from Jurassic Park to come on when we walked through the door.  Nope, just some pop music ranging from the 80's to present day...  Nothing says prehistoric era like Billy Jean. Well, make sure you come hungry to this place since they do give you hefty portions.  And if you are looking to maintain the physique of a velociraptor while eating here, then you may want to stop and rethink your body image to more of a triceratops...  Not that I'm fat-shaming a triceratops... but they are just not as fit...  sorry, the world is unfair... that's why dinosaurs are all dead.  Dead. On a more lively note, let's talk about the great food!    ::WINGS:: Very impressive, Dr. Alan Grant.  (reference circa 1993...)  The wings are a great way to introduce yourself to the array of BBQ sauces offered by Dino.  Anything from Korean BBQ, to Chipotle Garlic, to their Devil's Duel all of them have something to offer.  I appreciate the spread and the unique flavors that each sauce brings.  The sauce bottles are on your table, so just pour some onto your knife to get a quick sample.   The wings themselves are crispy and have enough meat to be labeled a respectable buffalo wing.  ::MEATS:: My Favorites: Ribs & Brisket  (actually Ribs, THEN Brisket)  It seemed that the combination plates are the way to go.  You can pick 2 or 3 meat items and get 2 sides with them.  The meats are run-of-the-mill for a typical BBQ joint: ribs, brisket, pulled pork, chicken, & hot links.   If you are a first timer, then you get the desired variety with the full extent of the generous portions.  Clever girl. (reference circa 1993...)     The RIBS were the definite star of the show.   The flavorful crispy bark on top of the meaty but soft rib has a texture profile that all ribs strive to be.  The rib slab is a healthy 5""-6"" wide and you can get a 1/2, 3/4 or full slab.   This is what I would order the next time I dine at Dino. The BRISKET is also quite tender and flavorful.  My only wish is that the brisket would have a bark/char that was as crispy as the ribs.   Both the pulled pork and hot links are average offerings, but both can be a good compliment to a meal.  The flavor on the pork is pretty plain and there isn't that explosion of flavor from the shred-able nature of the meat.  The sausage is a standard BBQ sausage.  So standard, that it is forgettable (like dinosaurs). ::SIDES:: I'm a sucker for good Mac & Cheese.  They have it. And it's good.  I also like the collard greens and baked beans.  It stirs the soul within.  The other sides I tried were just ok without much luster.   At least the portions of the sides are not skimped upon. ------------------- So, before you pass out from that ITIS -- most likely from the ribs... just remember, that dinosaurs died so that we could have delicious BBQ and a Toronto basketball team...

Maybe people have eaten at the Brooklyn one that is better, or perhaps Chicago's inferiority complex over NYC being better is having so many people go nuts, but the substance isn't there.  Inside its a bit too bbq trendy, looks like a place people coming from Joe's across the street would love to hang at.

The fries were boring, cauliflower was actually my favorite component. All the meats had a consistent smoke that is prominent, but that's basically the only flavor. The chicken was solid but forgettable. The pork was boring and not very juicy. The ribs literally have no flavor.  Despite ordering the combo and a sandwich we didn't get cornbread, something I regret.  The sauces were too unbalanced, only 1 wasn't exceedingly hot, where's the variety.  Maybe I was in on a off day, but this is pretty average (at best) BBQ with a great marketing arm.",0.9959,0.694,0.245,0.061,0.6692129629629631

I wouldn't say our visit was epic, but it was a good one.  We arrived Friday at 6, our quoted wait time was 20-25 minutes.  We were seated in 30, which for a busy Friday was pretty nice.  First impressions is this place is loud. Leaning-over-table-straining-to-hear-dining-partner-loud.  But the 80s pop mix playing over head was fun and I hear there will be live concerts here. This place is huge so I could see that happening.  The menu has the traditional BBQ tastes from different parts of the country (like brisket and ribs) and some  dishes with a little bit of Latin or Asian influences thrown in.  Having ""dinosaur"" in the name may also be why we decided to go big splitting an appetizer plate and splitting 2 large mains.  Glad we did it because there's so much on the menu that sounded good and many I wanted to try.  The Swag sampler platter for two appetizer, twice cooked lamb shoulder and the three meat sampler.  This resulted in multiple sides so we basically had a buffet on our table.  Good portion sizes also resulted in leftovers for home.  The standouts for me were the wings (wango tango sauce) the brisket, lamb and the collard greens. If I was in a mood for just wings, I'd order them as a main in a heartbeat. The sauce was hot, yet flavorful, and the wing size was decent. The brisket isn't as good as my Texas favorites, but is well-represented here. Tender and smoky, quite good. The lamb was a surprise hit. At first bite, the sweetness of the Korean glaze over powering, but seemed to mellow out. The lamb was fall apart tender and the kimchi inspired sweet and sour cabbage salad was a perfect side for it, as was the curried cauliflower.  The greens were perfectly cooked, flavorful without being over salted--I could have eaten the whole serving.  Other notable mentions, the sausage link had a nice spicy kick. The deviled eggs were super creamy and delicious. And the fried green tomatoes were perfectly crispy.  My son (THE Mr Wiggles) enjoyed his slider and fries. The Mac N Cheese not so much, and I would bet its because it's made with pimiento cheese (like mother like son, we aren't huge fans of that cheese, much to the horror of our dining partner Joanne W).

Shout out to our server Rich- he was probably the most attentive server I've ever met! He not only made excellent recommendations, he brought over beer samples when we couldn't decide, and was refilling our table with stealth.

The portions are huge and the price is pretty affordable for what they're laying down so overall it's a T-Rex of a restaurant.   They pack some pretty damn good ribs, great brisket, and an awesome spread of sides into an experience that doesn't have the long waits of other BBQ joints. It's table service as opposed to counter so you can sit and wait comfortably with a beverage rather than compete with the cattle call that you normally would.  The bar has a decent beer list and there's some salads on the menu as well so even if you're a brontosaurus you can still enjoy something while watching your carnivorous  friends feast their little hearts out.

2015-05-19,4.0,"Open the door, get on the floor, everybody walk the dinosaur... Am I the only one who was humming this tune upon hearing about Dinosaur BBQ?  It was a night like this, not even 40 days ago The place was pretty packed, tempted to get my food to go The grill was spitting fire, the room smelled kinda nice I felt my stomach growl, and barbeques a vice  And walked the dinosaur, I walked the dinosaaaaaur I could not resist. I might not have walked a dinosaur but I would have to work off some the food I consumed at Dinosaur BBQ. My cohort & I decided to embark on another dinner adventure. My cohort btw, is Aimee M and she was accompanied by her adorable son who we will call Mr. Wiggles. Again, we we're lured in by shiny Instagram pics and articles announcing the coming of this east coast chain. But unlike our last destination, Dino BBQ hit the mark.  We started with a sampler plate for two which was perfectly portioned: 2 deviled eggs, 2 fried green tomatoes, 2 wing with Wango Tango sauce and two jerk ribs. All of this was accompanied with the appropriate sauces as well. We thought all the samples were great. It wasn't the best fried green tomato I had ever had, but it satisfied the craving. The wings and ribs were good and both had a nice kick to them. Oddly enough, I think the deviled egg was my fave.  We went all out and order a couple of plates and shared. Aimee got the Korean lamb shoulder and I got a pick three combo plate with brisket, sausage & chicken. A ridiculous number of sides accompanied our meats: curried cauliflower, fried rice, greens, bbq beans & sweet & sour which we were told was reminiscent of kimchi. I thought all the meats were good but the stand out to me was the lamb shoulder. I would go back just for this. The sides were good as well - especially the cauliflower. The s&s cabbage was good but only a hint of kimchi was detectable.  I really enjoyed my meal here, though I am not a fan of the location. But this will not deter me from going back at some point. This place is HUGE and it can get quite loud so keep that in mind. If you are looking for a nice quiet place to enjoy your bbq, you should probably move along... and walk the dinosaur.

2015-05-12,3.0,"I'm a fan of the Dinosaur Bar-B-Que in Brooklyn, so I was excited to see an outpost opening here in Chicago. Good things:  I really liked the ribs, which were almost as tasty as the ones in NYC.  I like my ribs with a very thin glaze of sauce, really moist, and with a little pull to them (not actually falling off the bone), so these were perfect for me.  Ribs are a very personal thing, though, so YMMV.  I also liked the cabbage salad (not coleslaw--more like a lightweight kimchi), which balanced out the fatty goodness of the ribs. Less good things:  Brisket and pulled pork came already sauced, which isn't my preference.  Brisket was pretty good, pulled pork was just OK.  The local beers are overpriced.  This is a perennial beef of mine--why am I paying $8 for a Eugene porter in Chicago?  Not cool.  And lastly, as mentioned in other reviews, the service, while friendly and competent, was weirdly hovering.  We were there for maybe 45 minutes and our server must have visited our table, no joking, eight times.  Attentive service is one thing, but feeling constantly interrupted throughout the meal is something else.  This was more the latter than the former, unfortunately.

Fortunately, there was ample seating and we were able to get seated right away.  We started off w/ chicken wings and got half honey bbq and half wango tango, per our waitress's recommendation. I normally don't like honey bbq (I prefer salty over sweet), but the honey bbq sauce here is pretty good and not too sweet. The wango tango had a slightly spicy kick at the end; I thought the sauce overall for the wango tango was just ok. The wings themselves were smoked and grilled beautifully, as they had a subtle smokiness and a nice char from the grill. I would definitely get the wings again. For our entrees, we all got the 3 meat combo (st. louis ribs, bbq brisket, pulled pork, chicken, or sausage), which comes w/ cornbread and 2 sides . Us guys were starving, so we both got a combo to ourselves, and the girls had just eaten, so they ended up splitting a combo. We all ordered different sides (so that we could share!), and we ended up getting: -BBQ fried rice: this had a nice hint of bbq, yet still maintained the ""fried rice-ness"" to it. I don't even like fried rice (surprising, I know), but I really liked this! -Fries: standard fries, nothing special -Mac & cheese: creamy, cheesy, ooey goodness -Turkey neck collard greens: if you like collard greens, I think this is a solid dish (again, nothing special) -Curried cauliflower and sweet potatoes: not too strong on the curry, and the light taste helped sorta cleanse the palate of the bbq between each bite. We all agreed that the stars were definitely the BBQ fried rice, mac & cheese, and curried cauliflower and sweet potatoes.  For the meat portion, I got: -Brisket: break-apart-with-your-fork-tender and a nice smokiness to it -Pulled pork: this was my favorite of the 3 meats I got. The pork was super tender, soft, and delicious. It was melt-in-your-mouth wonderful and I thoroughly enjoyed it. In fact, I was deciding between either the 3 meat combo or the Big Ass Pork Plate - now I know that if I end up back at Dinosaur Bar-B-Que, I'm definitely getting the Big Ass Pork Plate! -Chicken: I thought the chicken was alright. Some parts were a little dry, but nothing to deter me from eating it The 3 meat combo plate as a whole is huge!

Dinosaur also has a pretty good beer list. Service was friendly and fast (they were quick to clear our plates/give us new plates, refill our water, ask if we wanted more beer, etc).

We tried getting the Twice Cooked Pulled Lamb Shoulder and some brussels sprout asparagus side thing, but they were out of them. I'm gonna have to pick 'n' choose what I review here... SMOKED CHICKEN WINGS Just chicken wings, but they're smoked, not fried. They also came with a ""Korean Style Glaze."" There were other options for sauce, but they were basically all the sauces you have at your table anyway. I tried the wings by themselves, and I actually lol'd because it's straight up Korean Style Glaze. That only makes sense if you're Korean and grew up with FOB parents. It's basically Gochujang, and some other sugars. My parents used to make that all the time on chicken, although it wasn't in a smoker. Gochujang is basically a Korean soybean & chili paste. Ultimately, it was a little nostalgic, but it was a just little bit too salty. I did taste a little bit of smoke through the glaze, but the glaze overpowered it in the end. I think these might be good without the glaze, but it's hard to tell. I've had this concept at Q BBQ in La Grange, and it was awesome there. RIBS & SAUCES These were cooked fantastically! Beautiful char on the outside, super tender meat on the inside, and fall off the bone. I wouldn't call them juicy, but it was not even close to dry. The technical points on the cooking were out of the park!  I guess here is where I'll talk about the sauces. The ribs have no sauces on them, I don't think. At the table, you basically have BBQ, Hot BBQ, Chipotle & Garlic, and Hot Habañero sauces. I like KC/St. Louis style sauces (i.e. Sweet Baby Rays, RJ's Bob B Que Shack - KC, Jay Bee's BBQ - Compton, etc.). Their BBQ is sort of a Memphis style - it's trades a lot of the smokiness and some of the sweetness for tang. While some people prefer Memphis style, it's not my thing. Hot BBQ traded the tang for some kick, so I liked this one probably the best. The Garlic & Chipotle one was pretty good, but it sometimes clashed against the smoky flavors of everything we were eating. I think it could do well in other applications, though. Finally the hot habañero was basically just a habañero sauce, and while I thought that would clash, like the garlic & chipotle, it actually worked pretty well and did give everything a much bigger kick. Although it was good, it also seemed sacriligious to go straight pepper sauce over a BBQ sauce.  So, the Hot BBQ was the go to sauce, but it was more of a ""Least of All Evils"" type of thing. This is where Dino BBQ suffered the most (just like Q, just like Smoque, and most of the Chicago BBQs), they have poor sauce choices. These ribs were cooked so well, they were a 7 by themselves, no sauce. A great sauce could have potentially awarded this a 9 or maybe even a 10! ...the world will never know. BRISKET These had an incredible smoky flavor, just under the level where it begins to taste like rubber. It's a fine point to balance on, but they nailed it! With the right bite (i.e. with some fat), the texture was pretty good, and the fat lent some nice buttery flavors too. The seasoning had to come from the sauce, but as I described above, the sauces weren't going to do much here. Also, while bites with a decent amount of fat were textured nicely, bites without fat were a bit dry. PULLED PORK & BBQ CHICKEN Ugh. Why can't anyone outside of Texas get pulled pork right? It's always too dry, and always useless without BBQ sauce. It was decently smoky, but a bit dry, and not enough seasoning built in to live without BBQ sauce. Chicken had the same problem.  PORK BELLY Ok, now we're talkin! A bit fatty, but that fat contributes to a lot of the buttery flavors that made this so good. The texture was so tender (thank you fat). I can't remember if there was a lot of smoke here, but there were definitely beautiful pork flavors. The seasoning was great! It skirted just under the line of ""too salty,"" but it was delicious. Definitely the best thing I had this meal. BBQ CATFISH New concept for me. Texture was actually pretty moist, unlike most catfish I've had. It also had significantly less of a slimy/dirty taste that I've found in most catfish (I probably haven't ever had good catfish), but if you concentrated a little, it was there. Probably my least favorite entree. WE SPARED NO EXPENSE NoRoom.Got everything-biggest problem was BBQ Sauce.IfULikeMemphisStyle,U'llProllyLikeThis place.

2015-05-01,4.0,"Let's start with the food.. As mentioned by others WOW... Great flavor and tasty BBQ.. Now to the not so good (and why only 3 stars) The portions weren't all that plentiful for the prices. I had the 2 part combo platter w/ ribs and the hot link. Again both were tasty but for the price $17.95 with 2 sides. There were only 3 ribs which is considered 1/4 rack and the hot link that was not much bigger than a hot dog. Now the sides were pretty good sized, had the cole slaw and baked beans. I don't consider myself cheap but if i m paying almost $20 for a meal I would expect to be pretty well filled up. I wasn't even close to that. I personally think that when they balance value/amount of food this place will be a winner. Again great taste, but no so great on prices/amount of food.. If that balances out this place will be a staple for me.. On a side note the staff I interacted with were great and seemed to know their stuff.",0.9884,0.759,0.198,0.044,0.7861111111111111

It wasn't bad but we probably wouldn't order it again. For the entree, I got the combo with ribs, brisket, and chicken. I thought all three were really yummy and the portion was really big. However, the coleslaw and fries were mediocre and the cornbread was dry and flat. Our server was really friendly and helpful. Their cheesecake was rich and creamy but not too sweet.

2015-05-01,3.0,"This place is good, but it has the potential to be better. We were seated immediatly (we had a reservation) and our service was awesome the rest of the way through the meal. We tried a variety of the food on the menu.  The seasoning, rubs, and cooking technique were spot on for good BBQ, but the quality of the food being used was a little lacking.  If they used better quality meats, or at least prepped the meat better, this place would be well worth the the steeper pricing. My husband and I agreed that the wings were the best thing we tried.  Mixed reviews on the sides.  I really liked the baked beans which has a cajun taste to them, and my husband was a fan of the mac and cheese and potato salad.  Room for improvement on the ribs (quality of them, not the seasoning).  The cormbread was also pretty standard (read: meh). Ambiance was a little loud, but we were seated by the bar when the Draft was starting, so I guess that is to be expected.",0.9948,0.753,0.247,0.0,0.518421052631579
2015-05-01,3.0,"I was looking forward to trying this chain that I'd heard about much from peeps back in the Rochester, NY area where I went to HS.  Tried it last night and am hoping they're just ironing out the kinks.  Service was great!  Props to Brandon for his attention to our table.  The food was okay, but it was SALTY.  I am a salt nut.  I am typically of the opinion that salt and butter make any food better.  Got the lamb shoulder with slaw and collard greens.  The slaw was great.  The meat was very tender, but salty as hell.  Now, it's a relatively thin slice and it had a fair amount of sauce, so maybe I just got a piece from the outside with a ton of rub or maybe the sauce added a level of salt that put it over the top.  Not sure.  I smoke meat at home, and use a heavy hand on the rub, and this was just an unnatural amount of salt.  The collard greens were likewise way too salty.  Don't get me wrong, I ate all of it.  It wasn't inedible (for me, the salt nut), but it would have been soooo much better with just a little lighter hand on the salt.",0.9909,0.768,0.204,0.027,0.508641975308642
2015-05-01,5.0,"After visiting their Brooklyn location, I was so excited to hear Chicago was getting one!  Get their wings! We started with their wings--oh my god. So. Good. I don't even like wings because their shape freaks me out, but these were amazing. They're smoked, not fried and according to my sister and stepdad worth the visit alone.  My sister and stepdad had the ribs and they are so good! Nice and meaty, just like in Brooklyn.  I had the lamb shoulder. WOAH. I didn't even know how much I loved lamb until I tried this. That review that said it was too salty is cray cray. Mine was perfectly salted and it comes on a bed of bbq fried rice-so good.  My mom had the smoked catfish and she loved it and please note she hates everything. Everything includes puppies-which says a lot because she loved Dino so much she wants to go on Mother's Day.  For dessert we devoured the ""Best cheesecake ever. Better than Cheesecake Factory""-my mom. Seriously though. I love cheesecake and this one is NY style and comes with this addictive caramel sauce. So. Good. I may or may not have licked the plate. Don't judge.  Our server was awesome. Super knowledgeable. Pointed us to the lamb shoulder and catfish, items we normally wouldn't have ordered. Everyone there was super smiley and for being the first week open, they all seem to have their shit together.

2015-05-01,2.0,"Let's get right to the point. This place is corporate are therefore suspect from the start - but I tried to keep an open mind. When we looked online, our friend clicked on the New York menu not thinking it would make a difference. Seems the ""Family Stylin' BBQ"" is $25 more in Chicago than it is in New York - go figure. The Family Stylin' BBQ platter costs $75.00 and consists of the following: One chicken (6 PCS) - VERY peppery without any other character to give it some flavor. One rack of ribs - Better but salty. They also left the thin layer of fascia (part of the pulmonary pleura!) on the back of the ribs and every single rib had a layer of fat left on the edge. Gross. One half pound of pulled pork and one half pound of beef brisket - the pulled pork was actually pretty good. The beef brisket - like the ribs - had a layer of fat with every bite. Three sides - we had mac & cheese, which is mustard flavored and dry. The wedge mini salad which was actually dry,  pre-packaged, machine cut, bagged lettuce. No flavor - basically garbage and cole slaw, which is vinegar based and almost passable as a side. The platter also comes with their ""Honey Hush Cornbread"" - which as a recognized connoisseur of corn bread, I would put in the ""pass it to the dog under the table at Thanksgiving"" category. They were flat, under-cooked and probably the poorest example of what cornbread should be I've ever seen. Overall a solid waste of my culinary time.",0.8043,0.841,0.09,0.069,0.33722943722943727
2015-04-30,4.0,"Went to Dinosaur Bar-B-Que after work about 5:30p and it wasn't too crowded. We had reservations just in case since this place is new. Location is super easy, right near the North/Clybourn Red line stop and across the street from Joes. First up we tried the creole deviled eggs. Not your typical deviled eggs, had chives and Cajun spices. I've never tried anything other than a typical deviled egg but these have a kick of spice and were really good. You can get them in 3 pieces, and these were a perfect serving size for 2 people. I had the Pork 3 way which is Smoked Crispy belly, hot link sausage and St. Louis ribs. The meat had really great spices and sauce. Was a bit disappointed in the temperature, a bit colder than room temperature. But was still good. The meal came with a honey hush cornbread. I'm a fan of sweet corn bread so wasn't a huge fan of their cornbread and I didn't taste any honey flavors. I got the BBQ beans and BBQ fried rice for sides. Beans were fine, nothing crazy different than other places. The BBQ fried rice was my favorite thing I ate. Great texture, spice and overall great taste. Paired nicely with the hot link sausage. Overall, it was a good experience. The waitress was incredible and was extremely helpful and friendly. Timing was good, we got right in for our reservations. Food came out in good timing. A bit on the fast side. I will go back again.",0.9972,0.694,0.261,0.046,0.5989291410344043
2015-04-28,5.0,"I went to school in Syracuse, home of the original Dino B, and it's been...let's just say a long time. I've been waxing poetic and nostalgic for this food for years, even to aficionados of the craft of smoking meats; bottom line--would it hold up to my memory? It absolutely did. From the first bite, not only did I feel totally vindicated in my devotion to this place and their food, but I was flooded with memories. Even if this is your first Dinosaur BBQ experience, you will soon become a convert. I did do carryout, so I cannot speak to the onsite experience as of yet, but I will update once I have to factor in service, etc. From a purely food perspective: 5 stars. I had the Pork 3-Way (which is new, yet deliciously familiar) with BBQ Beans and Turkey Neck Collard Greens. Those greens were so good they brought tears to my eyes.

2015-04-27,3.0,"I ate here with a couple of coworkers during their test run a few days before opening. They offered free meals in exchange for coming in and helping them practice for their grand opening. Of course they had us at ""free"". The service started out strong with beverages and our appetizer. We ordered the smoked chicken wings. They were pretty good, nothing to write home about. Everything went down hill after that. We ended up waiting more than an hour for our food. Our server and the manager came over to our table a couple of times to apologize for the delay. Although the meal was free, it becoming a little upsetting to watch parties who came in after us eat and leave before us. The staff brought us our food just as half of the group stood up to leave. We all ended up taking our meals to go.  Once I got my food home and tasted a bit of it I was not as annoyed by the wait. It was more tasty than I expected it to be. I got the trio plate that came with three meats, two sides and cornbread. I opted for the brisket, pulled pork and ribs. The meats were some of the best BBQ I've had in a while. It was very tender and seasoned well. I liked that the smoking of the meats added to their flavor rather than overpowering it. My sides were BBQ beans and macaroni & cheese. They were OK but not as memorable as the meat. I appreciate the fact that our server remembered me more than a week later (I work across the street from the restaurant) and explained that our food was held up by a computer glitch. That was very thoughtful of her. I'll certainly give this place another try now that they are officially open. Hopefully they have gotten the glitch situated and are running smoothly.",0.9835,0.859,0.124,0.017,0.5744937055281885

I didn't really like their corn bread muffins but not that big of a deal.  The Mac and cheese was definitely worth the try as well.

They obviously don't know good food. the coleslaw was originally flavored and compliments BBQ perfectly. Now for the real food... Ribs were phenomenal , just the perfect balance between dry rub and sauced up. And wow!  I mean WOW! The smoked and then grilled chicken wings were amazing! All meat no fat and juicy and crispy at the same time. I recommend the wango tango sauce if you're a fan of mild to spicy sauce. The honey BBQ was tangy and perfect for the sweet lovers.

2015-04-24,5.0,"I had heard about Dino Bbq being a staple on the east coast so naturally I was thrilled to have one open in Chicago.  We arrived at around 9:00pm. The place was packed! Not bad for their third day in business. Our reservation was for 9:30 so we hit up the bar to wait. We had the deviled eggs and fried green tomatoes as appetizers to start. The eggs were good! Admittedly, I'm a huge sucker for fried green tomatoes and these were just outstanding. I could have eaten a meal having nothing more than those tomatoes. We get seated promptly at 9:30 with no problems and no waiting. Super big plus for me. The server was attentive and knowledgable- I would not have guessed it was only day 3 of being open.  I am in the process of moving so my appetite was larger than normal. I decided to indulge in the three meat special. I got brisket, ribs, and pork with Mac and cheese and beans as sides. The brisket and pork were both excellent. Great flavor and texture. Their sauces really added a nice kick as well. The ribs were phenomenal. They were ""gnaw like a dog bone"" style. You really had to work for it but it was so worth it. The Mac and cheese was good and the beans were awesome.  I tried my girlfriends chicken as well and it was really good. I didn't try this but the curry cauliflower was outstanding according to other guests at my table. All in all - a great experience.

2015-04-23,5.0,"I did have this on opening night (well, shortly after it opened at 4:45pm) I had the pulled pork, Macaroni and cheese and baked beans. I also had the cheesecake. The pulled pork was very good. It was really flavorful and not dry. It came topped with sauce and you can tell the meat was spiced after it was pulled. I would definitely eat the pork again and that's the reason this review gets 5 stars. The plate came with cornbread which was a bit dry and needed some honey butter. The pork also had pickles and cracklings on top. The pickles had a little kick which was good but the cracklings didn't have much flavor and weren't crunchy. I chose the macaroni and cheese based on a previous review and unfortunately it wasn't very good. The cheese tasted almost powdered. The beans were good but there wasn't enough beans and was mostly sauce. The cheesecake was good and the crust and Caramel sauce made it delicious. Our server was very nice. There were too many people working, I would say they didn't know how busy they would be since it was their first night, however, it left a lot of people hovering which was uncomfortable.

I had the 3 meat special, with the pulled pork, hot link, and chicken. My sides were Mac and cheese and the curried cauliflower. Also sampled the wings. Mac and cheese is pretty dang good for a barbecue joint-plenty of cheese, baked well, and not creamy-just thick with cheese. Not the best I've had, but pretty good. Pass on the curried cauliflower, though it might be your bag-just didn't work for me. Everything else I had was very tasty, particularly the wings and pulled pork. Food is pretty much on par with the Dinos in Rochester and Harlem. Still some kinks to work out--service, though kind, was kind of slow for being pretty empty at 10:30 at night, and no corn muffins were offered that were supposed to come with every entree (though I didn't realize that till meal was done, or I'd have asked).
