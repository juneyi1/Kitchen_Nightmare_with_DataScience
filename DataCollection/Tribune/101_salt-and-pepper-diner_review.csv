The main reasons we go here: 1. to mix it up 2. it's close by 3. you can get a side of mini pancakes with your meal 4. They have english muffins as a toast option That being said, it's like any diner, but it doesn't seem too greasy which is nice. Just enough to comfort you, but not too much to leave you immobilized for the day. They also don't poach their eggs, sadly, so I have to get them 'sunny-side'. Oh wellll, a girl can't have it all.

2011-11-06,5.0,"Awesome.  I don't want you to discover the awesomeness of Salt & Pepper, so don't go... ha. I live a few blocks away, and go here frequently for breakfast.  I've been here once or twice for lunch, too.  You really can't beat it for eggs and hash browns - it's absolutely delicious, the service is super fast and they actually remember my husband and I (I'd say we're regulars, but we don't go every week, so I'm impressed).  It's really ridiculously cheap if you just want eggs and potatoes for breakfast, and still a good price for egg dishes with bacon.  I've had the pancakes, too, and they're solid. Basically, I adore this place for an easy brunch option.  It looks busy sometimes because it's pretty small, and because there's not much space to stand if you're waiting - you're basically right in front of the door.  I've no idea how the waitresses manage to keep track of who's next, but they seem to (and people sort of acknowledge who came in first, too), and it's a pretty fast turnover, so I don't know that I've ever waited more than like 10 minutes.  So - if there's only a few people standing, you'll get in soon! I love the atmosphere, too - they definitely consider their customers - they play old school cartoons on weekend mornings on the tvs so the kids have something to watch and the adults can have a conversation in peace.  And from the appropriate season - I was there around Halloween and they were Halloween cartoons.  Nice touch.

The place was pretty quiet for lunch time so we were a little apprehensive - but rock-star parking convinced us to try it.

Anyway - service was quick and friendly and on the money - even when this mook from another table yelled at  her while she was talking to us. She politely discouraged him and encouraged us and we go the order together. I got this sandwich which was meat and cheese and tomato and cucumber and all kinds of perfect. Got the tater tots on the side. My buddy - a little more calorie conscious than me - declined the carbs - the server substituted a bowl of soup at no extra charge.  It was a birthday lunch - so we were compelled to order desert. I got a warmed pecan roll ala mode. She put in a candle they sang (not that embarrassing TGIF crap - just good old ""Happy Birthday"") and we were able to get our business done after and relax.

U def. have to try the banana french toast it's a MUST!! :-) Oh  don't forget to try their burgers with Jalapenos and if by accident one of your non-spicy eating friends decides to taste it, umm....... don't take the fall for it. That was their doing.......lol!! Ahhh...the memories!!! Also the service is great! The girls who work there are always so pleasant!!:-)",0.9585,0.741,0.221,0.038,0.695959595959596

2006-12-22,2.0,"I'd say this place is pretty run-of-the-mill diner food.  Worst part is that they are NEVER OPEN. This place is kind of like the surrounding neighborhood: white-washed; urban, but it a really ""easy to digest"" way.  If you want real diner food, go to White Palace, Hollywood, or Huck Finn.",0.7089,0.786,0.169,0.046,0.5666666666666667

This place isn't really anywhere close to where I live but, having been invited by the finest lady friend yet, well - you know how it is :). Besides - what better way is there to shake off a hangover than to share greasy eggs & bacon with a fine lady friend and so many others doing the same?  Right?  It was great! :) Throw in some french toast, some grits, some hashbrowns, hot coffee  - yeah - this place is the BOMB!  Bacon was perfect, hashbrowns were perfect, eggs were perfect, coffee was good and bottomless, and the grits were outta sight (trust me - I lived in the south for 10 years - I know my grits).

2006-10-05,5.0,"As far as diners go - this one tops my list.  Everything is delicious and the staff is very fun.  They will make you egg whites, have a great breakfast burrito, their pancakes and waffles are amazing, and the coffee is really good.  I challenge you to find a better bowl of grits in Chicago (and if you do - let me know where!!).  I love to sit at the counter, read my book, and enjoy my favorite Chicago breakfast.   At Christmas, they have a brilliant tree with fun ornaments and lights - it reminds me of a Christmas Story. One warning - it's cash only, so don't forget to stop at the ATM on the way!",0.9929,0.641,0.343,0.017,0.716153846153846
2006-08-26,3.0,"It's a nice diner place. I mean, it serves breakfast food so nothing big or exciting about that. I got the Spinach and Feta omlette and it turned out a little too salty. My friend got the cinnamon apple pancakes and his pancakes were not fluffy at all, just flat and full of batter...I think it tasted like it was the bottom of the barrel batter. However, the atmosphere is still great and the waitstaff is quite friendly.",0.9255,0.784,0.186,0.03,0.54125

2006-08-01,3.0,"The food was pretty good, but they didn't accept credit cards, which is kinda bad for me since I never carry cash.  I liked the sandwich I got, and the portions were huge! I decided I had a little room left for a milkshake and it was great too.  My friend (the pickiest person ever, seriously loves McDonalds - YUCK), he even liked the food! I mean, maybe that means it's greasy and cheap? Haha, but either way I thought it was good and the atmosphere was cool as well.  I'm not sure if I've been to this particular Salt and Pepper but I've been to the one near Wrigley Field... so hopefully I'm even reviewing the right place.  However, it was good and cheap, and the milkshakes were spectacular! Oh yeah, and they sell beer!",0.9827,0.612,0.271,0.117,0.6353986291486292

2005-07-13,5.0,"Forget the fancy, shmancy stuff. I just want eggs and greasy hash browns for breakfast served to me by a waitress named Flo. If this sound like you, then you should definitely head over to Salt and Pepper Diner where I've been spending hungover Sundays for nearly 8 years now. All breakfast orders include hash browns and toast and are very reasonably priced and coffee will be refilled as many times as necessary. I might also recommend the homemade chocolate milk, which is awesome. Salt and Pepper has a Juke Box, although my friend used to just play Styx's ""Come Sail Away"" on repeat and it would drive me nuts. The service is quick and friendly; A perfect ""greasy spoon"" establishment.",0.9657,0.777,0.191,0.031,0.658
