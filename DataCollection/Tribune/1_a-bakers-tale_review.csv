Of course a bargain is only a bargain if the food is good, and it definitely is here. It's probably the second-best cherry pie I've had in Chicago.  Along with terrific pies, they also sell macarons (tons of flavors), s'mores, eclairs, cream puffs, cookies, muffins, and cupcakes--anything a raging sweet tooth could desire. I'm also a huge fan of their quiche, which is light and fluffy. They generally have a couple kinds available. I've tried the mushroom and arugula, goat cheese and red pepper, ham and cheddar, and they're all deeply satisfying. The portion is very generous and priced at only $2.50. It could very well be the cheapest lunch in town.  If quiche isn't your jam, many salad and sandwich options are available, and I believe they also sell at least one kind of soup daily.

Yeah, I was sold, especially because A Baker's Tale is literally right across the street from me.  I came here on a weekend and unfortunately there was none of the daily quiche that I've heard so much about, so all that means is that I clearly need to come back here to try it on a weekday! I tried a chocolate chip cookie, a chocolate tart, and then also a bunch of random pastry bites that were available for sampling. I love free samples. I don't know if the samples are only there on the weekend, but I am a big fan nonetheless. I tried some kind of s'more pie that was so good that I think I'll order that the next time I drop by. The cookie was good, but the chocolate tart totally knocked my socks off. It was so rich and creamy. I had vowed to save some to share, but before I knew it, the whole thing was gone!  The decor is also really unique with an Alice in Wonderland theme. It's really tastefully done, not cheesy at all. Even though I didn't eat here, I noticed that there are plenty of tables and outlets available. I noticed a free wifi sign, too, with a password.

Seriously, their ability to make such a buttery crumbly crust that holds together fluffy eggs and other goodies such as goat cheese mushrooms or roasted red peppers is beyond me.  I like to pair this with the blood orange lemonade that is definitely one of the most refreshing and tasty drinks around WP.

I am such a fan that I felt compelled to immediately write a review (the wifi password is ""wonderland,"" by the way--perfectly fitting in their Lewis Carroll/Alice in Wonderland theme). If you ever find yourself around Wicker Park/Ukrainian Village in search of something sweet, coffee, or the most amazing quiche I have ever tried, look no further than A Baker's Tale!  Food: I ordered a daily special quiche, which was arugula mushroom with goat cheese. The piece was HUGE and it was only $2.50. This is a total steal. I had the option of having it warmed up, which I did gladly. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this quiche, but I will try. The crust was perfectly buttery and flaky. You will find none of that plain, cardboardy stuff processed store-bought crust here. This crust was clearly homemade (the best kind). My mouth is watering again even though I finished eating already and I'm perfectly satiated.  Drink: Upon recommendation of staff, I ordered a pumpkin spice latte. She informed me that they actually use REAL PUMPKIN. I am sold. Immediately sold. My drink came in a big, cozy mug, which I enjoyed sipping on this blustery Chicago day. 10/10, would order again. Sorry, Starbucks, but I'm having none of your fake pumpkin flavoring. Starbucks doesn't have anything on A Baker's Tale! Decor: A little kitschy, but not at all tacky. I love the tasteful and creative designs here. I enjoyed eating at a table with quotes from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by Lewis Carroll. There's a breathtaking homemade tree with roses handmade from pages of the book at the front of the store. There are framed pictures on the wall depicting scenes from Alice in Wonderland. The bathroom is also very creative, hidden among a grass-wall (I don't know how else to describe it). I'm a sucker for themes and A Baker's Tale hits the nail on the head.  Service: Amazing! The staff here are really, really helpful and friendly. I feel like I've been welcomed into a family here. Everyone is so attentive and fantastic.  I see that they're offering cake-decorating classes here for $50, which is definitely something I'm going to check out. I have definitely officially found my new favorite spot in Wicker Park. I always look for cafes where I can apply to teaching jobs and get other work done. I wasn't expecting my new favorite cafe to be a bakery, but here we are.

The staff were very friendly, the quiche was tasty (and cheap), the chocolate-raspberry dessert was intense, the hot chocolate was nice (although powder based) and the coffee was not bad (and in America that is like saying it was good).

Also received hot coffee after ordering iced, but the ready-to-leave, uninterested attitude of young, sullen staff led me to just take it and go.   With so little left in the cases near closing time, perhaps also a discount price would add some cheer to the atmosphere.   These issues can 1. be easily fixed and 2. may relate only to time of day I have visited.",0.7218,0.873,0.085,0.041,0.38070175438596493
2014-08-25,2.0,"A Baker's Tale is another bakery/sandwich shop located in an already saturated market on Division St just west of Hoyne.   Their soups are generally odd tasting (cold cucumber) and their breakfast sandwiches are borderline inedible.  The Bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwich is a $4.15 uncreative, unoriginal offering.  It is literally just overly salty bacon + eggs + cheese smushed between two thin slices of bread.   Cookies and cupcakes, however, are moist and very tasty plus they sell the day old ones for $1.50 if you're lucky enough to catch them.  Moral of the story, stick to the baked goods avoid everything else.",-0.1779,0.929,0.027,0.044,0.4759259259259259

It was a beautiful day so we sat outside. First, I ordered an iced White Mocha and the Ham and Goat Cheese Quiche. After I ordered, I sat down and they brought it out to me, so nice! Then, I went back in and got a brownie and a cheesecake. It was so hard to decide! I want everything! The pies look amazing and would serve probably 3-4 people (or 2 of me because I'm a pig).

2014-07-29,5.0,"This shop stands head and shoulders above so many others of its type in Chicago.  Here's the rundown... Prices - While I would say ""cheap"", it is way cheaper than other high quality coffee and bake shops.  A slice of homemade quiche for $2.50?  Coffee drinks and baked goods also come in $.50 to $1 cheaper than almost everywhere else. Atmosphere - Friendly staff, super comfortable chairs, awesome music, nice outdoor space, fastest coffee shop Wifi I know of all make for a great place to hang out and enjoy. Food - So far, everything I have tried has been awesome.  Muffins and quiche are delicious.  Would like to try salads and sandwiches too and sure I will soon. Drinks - Good coffee, even better homemade blood orange lemonade. The place has been really uncrowded, and I hope it picks up, because this is my new favorite neighborhood joint to work on my computer and grab a bite, and I wouldn't want it to close.  Try it!

The cappuccino was yummy and the ham sandwich with pineapple spread was delicious. Highly recommend that. Prices were very reasonable and the decor was colorful and the theme was cute with the storybook wonders. The main attraction for me was their cupcakes. I had the cookie dough cupcake which is one of their biggest sellers and even better, in my opinion, was the cookies and cream cupcake. The outside seating is a big advantage for them in that area and it is great that they have that now as the summer season is here.  Go here for the sandwiches and pastries.

I have worked with some of the finest pastry chefs in the country and have eaten $20,000 wedding cakes so I know my cakes and cupcakes. The day old oreo cupcake I had wasnt too moist or too dry, it was just perfect. It had these oreo crumbs sprinkled throughout the actual cake part and this absolutely delicious buttercream with more oreo bits and an oreo cookie on top which had absorbed a lot of flavor and moistness from said buttercream and the result was pastry world nirvana. My girlfriend said her eclair was delicious and was probably the best one she has had other than the one at the Ritz Carlton Chicago where her friend was the pastry chef.  All this said, the employees are super friendly and professional and you can tell that they are very very good at what they do and take a lot of pride in it. The whole experience is awesome, with their beautifully hand drawn and colored  artwork on the chalkboards to the uptown Mad Hatter Tearoom theme not to mention their amazing display case housing some of the finest delicacies this side of France.

I had a Salted Caramel Eclair which was perfect. Flaky and moist on the outside, filled with a delicious caramel tasting cream inside. Their macaron selection was small, but very very very tasty. I had a Cookies and Cream one and it was just like the ones I had overseas. I wish that they had a bigger selection of flavored macrone, but I did come close to closing on Sunday, so maybe they were just sold out (because they were so good!)  I ordered a loose leaf tea called ""Love"" which was delicious. This is where I would like to talk about the service -- because it was flipping amazing. One of the staff, a taller guy with a cool hat, helped me behind the counter. He was incredibly friendly, VERY informative and very welcoming. He showed me this really cool tea sampler set that they have at the counter where you can actually smell and see all of the loose leaf tea. He also explained to me that everything in the bakery was made completely fresh every day and, as he put it, everything is very ""wholesome."" I like that in a place where I go to eat (even if it is full of sweets!!  ). Toward the end of my visit he followed up with me and asked me how everything was which of course was FANTASTIC. He recommended to me to try something called Vera Water on my next visit... they have a homemade Strawberry Basil syrup... Mmm. I didn't get his name but he made my visit an absolute pleasure and is one of the main reasons I will be coming back. There was also a girl behind the counter with brown hair who was very friendly and helped me with my pastries.   Back to the food. Did I mention it was delicious? Because it is. They have a turkey sandwich featuring a white cheddar cheese, apples, candied pecans and some sort of house made cranberry jelly. It may sound a little strange, but the flavors go together really well. It tastes very comforting and something like your grandma would make you for an after school snack. It was delicious.  The decor is done very well for a fairy tale themed cafe. It's not cheesy at all -- it goes very well together. Their WOW factor is a giant tree sculpted out of book pages with tea cup lights. We sat underneath it and it was simply beautiful. They have a giant ""maze"" grass wall that leads to the bathrooms that is also fun. There are chandlers in the bathroom... do I need to say anymore?  Anyway, this place is worth checking out, even worth driving for (and in the city that's a big deal).

Two of us ordered the cilantro, jalapeño, ham and cheese and the other had the roasted red pepper and goat cheese selection.  Loved the plates and flat wear, both were modern and stunning.  The crust on the quiche was flaky, buttery and baked to perfection, the inside was creamy, dreamy and delicious. A generous slice warmed up and brought to the table was $2.50.  All three of us loved our first course. It was a challenge to pick dessert. Everything looked delicious, stunning and tempting. The bakery case is a feast for the eyes.  We decided to split a small whiskey, Carmel Apple pie ($6.00), because it looked adorable, the top crust was made entirely out of tiny dough hearts!  We also had the pie warmed up twice (we talked a lot and the transition from quiche to pie took longer than expected).  The pie was sublime. The fling was delicious but I fell in love with the crust. I would have just ordered a non filled pie crust and been very happy.   The staff was warm and friendly, several groups of people came and went while we chatted and dined.  We chose to sit at a table in the front under their tree with cup and saucer fruit.  It felt like a mini-vacation.  I will definitely return and would serve their baked goods for dessert at a dinner party.",0.9956,0.77,0.23,0.0,0.6086111111111111

My usual standby for a sweet treat in the hood is Alliance, but sometimes 7 blocks is too far for a cupcake. Sometimes I need to only go 3 blocks. My odd sweet cravings aside, I was lucky enough to be able to pop into this whimsical bakery on their opening day. I opted for the honey blueberry basil cupcake, and my friend went with the breakfast cream puff. Both of us had both of our thumbs up, or they would have been had we not been using all fingers to feast on our treats. I loved the touch of basil in the cupcake's light and fresh frosting, and the cupcake was moist (yeah, I said it) with the right amount of blueberry filling. I'd eat it again. And probably one more time after that. On top of the cupcakes and cream puffs, they have several sandwiches on the menu, a daily quiche, plus a beautiful assortment of macarons (as well as macaroons, don't confuse the two) and perfect little pies. I had a difficult time choosing my poison, so I will have to return to sample more sweets and savory. The entire bakery has an Alice in Wonderland theme, but isn't cutesy. This is grown up whimsy here, with large prints of book pages for tables, and more book pages as flowers on their tree over the dining area. At $3.95 for one cupcake (on the smaller side), it's not cheap, but it is a local business that has a lovely array of baked goods for the eating, so it's probably worth it.  I will have to return for a sandwich or some quiche and most likely another one of those lovely little cupcakes that could brighten up even the longest Chicago winter.
