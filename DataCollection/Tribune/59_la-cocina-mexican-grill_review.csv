2011-01-26,4.0,"I suppose I should start off by saying that I'm not a huge Mexican food fan. It's always my better half's idea to go, so go we went! La Cocina is on Jackson Blvd and pretty conveniently located: its on my way from school to Union train station.  The interior is super fun: bright orange striped walls and nice wooden tables. They have Jarritos drinks (Yay!) and Coke in glass bottles (Double Yay!) The food is alright, but nothing to write home about. I had the cheese quesadilla, which was good, but not spectacular. My boyfriend got the flauta and a taco, which were also solid. Granted, the food was cheap and pitch perfect for the price range, but don't choose La Cocina if you're looking for somewhere with interesting and new dishes. The one thing that kinda irked me was that when my boyfriend asked for a simple customization (potatoes in his beef taco), he was shot down by the owner at the counter immediately. No apologies. No explanation. Just ""No."" Pretty annoying. In fact, the service is was took this from being an overall solid experience (which would have been 5 stars for me) to leaving something to be desired. Yeah, its great we get free chips, but just tossing them on the table and leaving without a word is *not* great service.  Another thing, there's a free water stand in the back right corner that's hidden. Didn't think it was conveniently placed for customers to see, but I suppose that's the point when you want to force people to buy drinks. Double Annoying. Overall, La Cocina is the place for solid, cheap Mexican food if you're in the area, but don't make a trip out of it. It's really not worth it.",0.9935,0.752,0.199,0.049,0.47113047770942523

2010-10-14,5.0,"This is authentic Mexican food.  The first time you go I strongly suggest anything with pork, because it's outstanding and keeps me coming back more than anything else.  It has just the right level of heat, a kick but not enough to make my eyes water.  The seasoning is tasty and there are some sauteed onions mixed in.  I've been such a regular that the guy at the register knows what I will order unless I change things up. The other meats are good as well.  The tortillas are high quality, the rice is tasty and just the right texture, and refried beans are just what you'd expect. A taco dinner is a good healthier option.  It's 3 tacos with your choice of meat, plus lettuce, tomato, and cilantro, with rice and refried beans.  Sometimes I order each taco with a different filling, and they never mind. Just yesterday I had a pork burrito and it was great.  The meat was generous and delicious, the filler ingredients like lettuce and sour cream were there but not intrusive.  They had even grilled it to make the tortilla just a bit crispy. The taco salad is very good, with lots of meat, lettuce of course, and guacamole, sour cream, shredded Mexican cheese and tomatoes on top. For dessert you have to get the choco-flan.  They don't have it every day, but it's amazing and easily worth both the price and the calories.  It's very moist, tasty and you don't find it just anywhere.  I mop up every last drop of caramel sauce at the end. Whenever I ask myself  ""What should I get for lunch today?"" and I think of La Cocina, I immediately begin to salivate.  The prices are higher than fast food but the quality more than makes up for it.  If I didn't care about my waist size I would go twice as often.",0.9917,0.838,0.144,0.018,0.4531776556776556

2008-02-12,5.0,"La Cocina rules!  It's easily the best and most authentic mexican restaurant in the Loop.  Whenever I walk by Chipotle and see the huge line of suckers, I feel bad that most of them prolly haven't had authentic mexican cuisine before.   First of all, I really love the interior decor.  Although it's pretty small inside, it's super colorful and vibrant.  All 3 or 4 of their locations look pretty much the same as well.  I also like the dance/house music that is always blaring in the background, it gives the place quite a young and hip vibe.  During lunch hour there's a huge crowd that congregates, so seating can be tough to find.  Once seated, they give you a complimentary basket of chips and have two types of salsas, mild and hot which are very flavorful on the food and chips both.  I typically order tacos here.  All the meats are tasty, in particular the steak and chicken.  It doesn't get any more authentic, w/ double layered corn tortillas, meat, lettuce and tomatoes all for only $1.35!!  Occassionally i'll mix it up and get an enchilada as well, which are very yummy and taste very light w/o the abundance of cheese you might find at some joe schmo spot.   Make your stomach happy and forget Taco Bell, Chipotle, and any other fast food mexican... this is the only real place to go in the Loop.  Everything is tasty as hell and easy on the wallet.  You will love it guaranteed!",0.9907,0.758,0.191,0.051,0.5620740740740742
