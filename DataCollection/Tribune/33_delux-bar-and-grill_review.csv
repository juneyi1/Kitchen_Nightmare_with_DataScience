But it looked like they had other good deals throughout the week. We started with habanero chicken wings--the server kinda laughed a little when we ordered them and they were nice and spicy so I see why! They came out fast and were served super hot. We also ordered wraps; I got the California (chicken, hummus, avocado, etc) and it was delicious but big enough to take home half so I get to enjoy it again. They had plenty of sports on tv throughout, and they've also got some games (think pool, pinball, darts) to keep you entertained. Seemed to be kinda low on servers but we didn't have any problems.

We also had the mozzarella sticks, and those were pretty standard. The Mexican scramble was delicious, especially if you like a little heat. Also delicious was the breakfast quesadilla. My husband ordered the buffalo chicken wrap due to one review saying it was the best. It was good, but definitely not the best. The sauce was a little watery and didn't adhere to the chicken that well. Also, the chilaquiles were not quite what I'm used to. I prefer mine drenched in a nice red or green sauce and they used salsa vs sauce. Also, another plus if you are a tot fan is that the breakfast potatoes are actually smashed tots!!

I ordered the burger special for $ 6.00 plus fries. I asked for a medium well burger and my burger was literally burned, super greasy and I did not have what i wanted on it which was; cheese, lettuce, tomato, raw onions and ketchup. How do you get this wrong? Honestly if she would have gotten my food correct and the burger less greasy; it could have been good. I took maybe two bites of it and asked for my check.

2013-12-04,1.0,"Delux, Delux, Delux... Well, I used to be a ""regular"" at Delux. For my birthday, earlier in the year, I brought my parents, wife and my son and daughter. At the end of the meal, my dad insisted on paying for the meal, our waitress, ran his card, and came back, with it already run, and my dad added the tip. About four months later, my wife and I happened to be in Delux, when that same waitress, whose name is Ashley, waited on us that night. She asked if we'd been in a few months earlier with an older man, it took me a bit, but put it together as my dad, plus everyone else in the family, so I asked if that was when she was talking about, and she said yes. Keep in mind, we went to Delux at least once a week, and would order take out at least one to two times per week, as well, typically on week nights, which apparently Ashley doesn't work, or we just never crossed paths with her. Ashley then proceeded to tell us that something was wrong with my dad's credit card, and the charge didn't go through. Number one, remember that she had already authorized it, and brought it back to the table for him to add the tip-if there was a problem with the card, she'd known it then. Number two, my dad uses his Disney credit card for every single thing to earn Disney points, and never, ever had a ""problem"" with it. So, anyways, I told her that I'd check with him to see if the charge went through, to which she protested and said that we would have to pay that night, and I could ask him later, or I could call him right then. I told her my dad isn't up that late at night, well, that didn't matter to Ashley, she added the previous bill from four months prior, to our bill from that night. She related that a manager did this, we've checked and this is ILLEGAL! Furthermore, during that night, Ashley was doing squats against the wall, with some patrons, and gave us some of the worst service, we've ever had. So, I did check with my dad, whom called his credit card company, to which they informed him, that Delux, did in fact run his card for authorization that day, but, drum roll please, they never put an actual charge through. So ASHLEY messed up and didn't put the charge through, she only authorized the card. I have zero problem with paying for the meals, where my problem lies, is, when we come in all the time, and I say I'll call my dad the next day, to check, to make sure his card didn't get charged, that's what you let us do. It'd already been four months since the bill had been improperly handled by Ashley, the business couldn't wait one more day, for regulars, to make sure there wasn't a mistake somewhere? Not to mention, again, that them adding a bill, that someone else had tried to pay, onto our bill, is ILLEGAL! Ashley, and/or the manager that was on duty that night, should know better, than to do what they did, it's a shame that Ashley's mistake on not putting the charge through, properly, resulted in this. No apology has been given to us, which is even a worse sign of how business is conducted here.

(Perhaps THAT is actually the reason for your positive reviews Matt F. not the so-so food and crappy service) What IS 100% ridiculous is that management responded to a terrible review regarding their delivery service after my review was posted, but Not my review where a waitress ILLEGALLY came after us for a tab that wasn't ours and acted like a rude bully!  They clearly follow their reviews, as they should. Yes delux, I see that your ""business and guest relationships"" are truly important to you.  I have mentioned our experience now to EVERYONE I can, and will continue to do so, because no one should be subjected to such bad business practice all for food that is mediocre on a good day... one person stated they would have called the police!  What could have been rectified by professional management has now become an epic failure in business and become far more offensive.",-0.908,0.701,0.132,0.167,0.5558181818181818

Especially after throwing away 3/4 of the food, and taking the trash out so I wouldn't have to smell it.  We just ordered the Big Bro burger and chicken fingers... Two of the most simple things. The chicken was bland and very dry, while the burger was overcooked and just did not taste good. We had fries and tots as the sides, and those were the worst part of the meal. They tasted like they were fried in extremely old oil which completely masked how a tot or fry even tastes. It was so gross. Once we realized we were simply choking down the food (since we paid for it) we threw it in the garbage where it belonged. If we were at the bar, it would have all been sent back. I never knew a burger, chicken fingers, fries and tots could taste so disgusting.  The only thing to keep in mind is that this was delivery... So maybe, just maybe the food would have been better at the bar (but I highly doubt it considering I only live 1 mile from there so it's not like there was a far distance to travel).  One positive is that the delivery was fast. I'm disappointed because I was really looking forward to finding another good spot for local takeout aside from the usual pizza and Asian fare.

2011-02-02,2.0,"The original spot we were headed to was closed so we opened up our Yelp App and found Delux Bar & Grill.  It had a smattering of good reviews so we decided to head in. The atmosphere is pretty nice.  It was lunch time and there weren't a lot of people.  The space is open and they have a variety of seating options, the bar, a large booth in the back, and a few tall tables (and also several regular tables).  There wasn't any music, but there were several TVs positioned around the room so that you could see one regardless of where you are.  I normally hate TVs in restaurants, but this is a bar and grill.  Different rules. Opening up the menu, nothing stood out as super amazing.  Kind of your standard bar & grill fare.  We all decided to go the easy route and order burgers with tots. I'd like to note that the prices are a touch high.  You can get the burger for $8 and then anything that's not mustard, ketchup, lettuce, onion, or tomato tomato is a dollar.  A dollar for cheese is a touch high.  Bacon?  OK.  A dollar for a dollop of BBQ sauce? That better be some damn good BBQ sauce. Now another plus for the place?  Tots.  Not all places serve up tator tots and so we had to get them.  Problem?  Replacing fries with tator tots is a $2 up-charge.  Now, I'm relatively new to the Chicago dining out experience, so maybe that's normal, but most places I've been, from coast to coast to Texas, Hawaii, and overseas, subbing potatoes for potatoes is free. I decided to try that dollar dollop of BBQ sauce because, I like BBQ sauce, and the menu actually called it 'Buffalo BBQ'.  I like buffalo sauce as well (which, by the way, their dollop of buffalo sauce is also a dollar).  So for a dollar, I'm thinking, this will be something different. No, just spicy BBQ sauce.  I couldn't tell that the spicy was supposed to be buffalo, just that it had a zip to it.  So, fail on that account. So, in the end, I have to say that it's a pretty standard Bar & Grill that's a bit on the pricey side with nothing special to offer.  I wouldn't warn anyone off, but I won't go again.",0.9849,0.813,0.133,0.055,0.5003373097490745

2010-10-21,5.0,"So, I've been here twice now.  When wife and I went there last night with another couple, I was eager to get back for the great food.  And, while I was ready to give Delux 5 stars first time in, I did not want to stake my reputation as a fair and impartial reviewer giving out the ultimate award without a followup visit confirming first impressions.  I checked, and it is a true 5 star, and this is my new favorite place in the City of Chicago for upscale bar food at crazy reasonable prices. As a restaurant reviewer, I pretty much believe in what I'd call the Roger Ebert theory of reviewing.  Roger, I'm sure you know, is the Pulitzer Prize winning movie critic who would always remind readers that in awarding stars, he was basing those awards against other movies of the same genre.  In other words, a 3 star horror flick was being judged against other horror flicks, not against romantic comedies or spy movies.  And, in giving out 5 stars to Delux, of course I'm not suggesting that it's the same dining experience I would expect at Rosebud Steakhouse or Mastro's or Tru.  But, as a great bar food experience, with an ambiance that's straight out of Cheers, and bar food that is sensational, this deserves all 5 of my stars. And, I would suggest that you run, do not walk, to partake of the Wednesday night spare rib special.  IF (and for some it's a big ""if""), like me, you enjoy flavorful, fall off the bone variety ribs.  These are ribs that you can leave on the plate, and remove the wonderfully flavorful meat from the bone by the simple application of a fork.  Somewhat like pulled pork, yet with all of the flavor of great spareribs, these are ribs that I would put up against anybody's fall off the bone ribs, anywhere.  And, at $18 for a full slab (the portion looks more like 2 full slabs), including potato and cornbread, they are an absolute steal.  A steal, I tell you.  Add to that Wednesday night's special $3 Stellas, and you've got a feast that would be a bargain at twice the price.  This Wednesday night magnificence just started 3 weeks ago, and the place should not only be full, there should be hungry diners lined up down the block waiting for this deal.  Best get over there this Wednesday, before my prediction becomes a reality. But, it's not just the ribs.  Because I've eaten there twice with a total of 8 other people, I have had the pleasure of tasting so many other 5 star dishes.  Their pizza (if, like me, you like a thin, cracker-like crust) is worthy of standing alongside our city's best thin crust pizza - Pizano's, Malnati's thin, and Pizzeria Via Stato to name three.  The Greek salad is huge and cold and full of terrific ingredients.  The tater tots with cheese and the fried pickles are amazing.  Even dessert!  And no, I am not kidding.  Try the fried ice cream.  I don't care if you're so stuffed you're waiting for the ambulance, you MUST try the fried ice cream.  Then you can message me with your thank yous. The geniuses behind all of this seem to be the owner, Gen, who's got a personality as big as the building her place exists in.  And Matt, a young chef who makes everything - not almost everything, but everything, from scratch.  His own pizza dough (did I mention an outstanding sausage topping?), award winning wings, his own salad dressings, soups - citizens, this is really, really good food, served in large portions at extremely reasonable prices.   There must be some negatives, you say.  Well, just one.  The parking situation is a bit hit and miss.  No valet, no nearby lot, a fair amount of nearby curbing devoted to properly permitted vehicles.  Having said that, I was able both times to park within two blocks along Milwaukee.  It doesn't matter.  It is worth doing whatever you have to do to ditch the car and start eating and drinking.  Great selection of beers, everything prepared really, really nicely.  Check it out.  Soon.",0.9974,0.792,0.162,0.047,0.5921652036235372

So go with a different side if you get a burger or sandwich! We also ordered the chips & salsa appetizer, and those were pretty much what we expected. The main gripe I had was the drink prices, which were basically $5+ for anything not Miller or Bud related. There is one beer ""on special"" for 3 bucks, so if you don't like that, be prepared to overpay for drinks.

If I didn't live around the corner, I would give it three stars.  As a corner bar and grill, this place is good.  I say ""good"" because the draft selection isn't the best for me-- I would prefer some microbrews.  They recently added Matilda to the drafts (others are Guiness, Newcastle, Blue Moon, and sometimes Stella), which helps my beer snob palette. The food here is good/decent.  I don't eat a lot of meat, so I really enjoy the black bean burger.  It's delicious.  Their onion rings are breaded with coconut and surprisingly not greasy, but still delicious.  I come for the onion rings when I want onion rings but not a heart attack.  It's stupid, I know, but if there is not grease on my fingers, I don't worry about it so much.   I have had the greek salad several times, which is very good and refreshing.  The wraps aren't bad, and my S.O. absolutely loves the patty melt.  I've had a bite (or a few), and it's beefy deliciousness.

But I'm a trooper, and since I had plans to meet Stacy Y for the Time Out Chicago Cheap Issue party at the Red Canary, I got my butt off the couch and was off to Milwaukee ave.  The party was a complete bust. The free booze was gone within 15 mins. There were 50 swag bags for a couple hundred guests. Some dude was wearing a head band.

I have never in my life had tator tots as good as these. They were crunchy on the outside (I do not care for mushy tots). They were absolute sinful perfection. It was also a large enough portion for the 2 of us to share them and have ZERO appetite afterwards. The girls at the table behind us had also gotten the bowl of tots, but they did not get the smothered tots- and they were eyeing our tots (or my man, either way, YOU CAN'T HAVE IT!) He got the biscuits and gravy for his entree and I got the BLT. My ONLY insult of my BLT was that for ME, the bacon was too crispy. Too well done. I like it a bit softer and less crunchy. It's my fault- I should have asked the waitress to make sure it was prepared that way. But it was still delish. Served on toasted (and I believe buttered) Texas Toast with a white truffle mayo... Y.U.M. OH, and they have a trivia night (but I don't remember the night of the week it's on).  Either way, I would absolutely return. This is not bikini friendly food so keep that in mind ladies.  The only other negative thing that I can say is the service wasn't good. I think the waitress was pretty much on her own. It seemed like every table was full and she seemed to have them ALL. But still, we were there a good 15 minutes and had each already had our water RE-filled before she came by. Plus I noticed 2 groups that had come in after us got to order before we did. I felt kinda rude when I did call her over to our table to take our order but I felt like we were at a point where it was do or die! Honestly though, I would return. The bacon issue was all me and the waitress was over booked (I think). The tots more than make up for any wrongdoing.",0.9216,0.818,0.107,0.074,0.5862227182539683

Now that I've made that known, I'll share my experience of Delux. I went with a group to Delux early on a Saturday evening. The location is great, so close to the Kennedy, downtown and the Blue line. Parking is relatively easy as well, since that stretch of Milwaukee is on the sleepy side until later at night. I'd like to make known that if every restaurants had service like Delux, the world would be a better place. Our waitress was friendly, fast, attentive, and put up with a group of 15 people who were in a rush to make a comedy show. I was possitively impressed. As for the food...hmm.  My friends ordered the Smothered fries, I got the fries with the the three dipping suaces (truffle mayo, chipotle ketchup, and mesquite bbq). The Smothered fries were OK, but the cheese sauce brought to mind queso sauce found at Jewel. Maybe the tater tot version of this dish would have been better. Also, the cheese cools and solidifies really fast, so don't talk too much while eating a Smothered dish.  My fries alone were delicious. I enjoyed the mayo sauce, but everyone else at the table tried it and were repulsed upon tasting it. The chipotle ketchup tasted like one of those European brands of imported ketchup you could find at Whole Foods or Tony's. It had a miniscule kick to it and my dining companions also did not like it.  As for me, I'll eat anything, so I finished my fries, sauces, and some Smothered fries entombed in hardened cheese.

2008-12-17,4.0,"My brother in law was in town and wanted a burger. I was tired with an ensuing increasingly unpleasant hangover bearing down on me... I needed something that would soothe my not so settled stomach and head. We meandered around for a few minutes when we spied this place. Not needing craziness, no loud patrons, no blaring TVs, just some food, we crossed our fingers as we crossed the thresh hold.... and we scored.  The place was fairly empty, a couple playing pool in one corner, some patrons seated at the bar and a few tables taken up. College basketball on the TVs, but thankfully not a loud ruckus that I was hoping to avoid. Looking at the lay of the land this place is fairly spacious and wide open bar with light wood paneling, a sizable lengthy bar, several tables. In fact, perhaps it was because of the emptiness, but it seemed fairly larger than what it looks like from the outside. We grabbed two seats at a table and our waitress stopped by, a diet coke for me, a beer for the brother in law.  We talked about being healthy for lunch, laughed, and started off with the nachos. Light and crispy chips covered in homemade cheese sauce, black beans, jalapenos, sour cream, tomatoes and some additional priced grilled chicken. I don't know how homemade the cheese sauce was, but really in my state of being, the whole thing was pretty tasty, as evident of our fairly cleaned off plate. I got the turkey burger while my brother in law got a regular burger. His with Merkt's cheese spread, (a favorite of my childhood), mine with provolone and cheddar, jalapenos all on a pretzel bun. Yes. A pretzel bun. Jealous? I thought so. We both opted for the fries, (plenty of side options including the very tempting tater tots), we buffaloized them, (side of buffalo sauce, side of blue cheese, pour or dip, enjoy and you're welcome). The burgers were tasty, just what we were looking for.  The place was exactly what we were looking for, chill and relaxed with a neighborhood feel to it.

The servers always have excellent, and honest recommendations and you can tell that they enjoy their jobs! My personal favorites include the De Lux Salad, it is loaded with corn, dressing and Buffalo chicken strips...Amazing!!!  The cheeseburger is exceptional, and I highly recommend it on the Pretzel bread bun...unlike any other burger you have ever had.  The Mediterranean Chicken sandwich comes with seasonings and feta cheese...also a great choice. The mini corndogs, quesadillas and various other appetizers all make for a great meal too!   The ambiance of De Lux is very chill as well, with mellow coppers and dim lighting, it's hard not to feel relaxed while enjoying a frosty beverage with a few friends.  De Lux is a great place for a low key date, helpful staff, great ambiance, good food and great drinks all help when it comes to laying down a little game with the fairer sex. With generous space and plenty of tables, it's an excellent venue for group outings as well! Don't forget about the desserts!!! They have an excellent Cookie dessert that comes with ice cream.  The cookie is soft and melts in your mouth.  They also serve fried ice cream, you can never go wrong with fried ice cream. All in all, De Lux is an excellent bar to become a regular at!  Being a family business, and by family, I mean you will meet their entire family, you will definitely feel welcomed! Try it out, you have nothing to lose! Oh...they have an awesome Juke box, especially when you're hammered and looking to rock out!  Handle it!",0.9985,0.718,0.266,0.015,0.6183328688219991

Since the onset of warm weather, we've been traveling further and further from home and I hadn't been to De Lux in awhile. Last night, with the Sopranos and all, it seemed like a good night to stick near home, and go with De Lux. I was sooo disappointed.  I don't know if they have a new chef, or what, but the chicken fingers were so different and not good at all. Fries lacked all crispness.  I am sad.  I'm grieving the old De Lux!",0.5848,0.783,0.143,0.074,0.5795815295815295

2007-02-05,3.0,"Stumbled by accident on this place the other night, after leaving an event at Avenue M which is just down the block.  Located at the corner of Milwaukee and Sangamon, this place reminded me of one of the neighborhood bars that I frequented when I used to live in Milwaukee- which for me is a good thing and a good thing for this River West neighborhood! Unpretentious, friendly with personable wait staff, I immediately felt at home at this place.  I chose to sit at the bar but there are plenty of tables.  Talked to Matt, the bartender, who was an affable guy willing to spend some time with us telling us about the range of beers, menu, and history of the place, etc.  We ordered some snack food-try the chicken quesadilla -it was so good we ordered another and the friends I was with liked the fries with 3 sauces and the mini-burgers.  The menu starts out with a large variety of foods- but as the evening goes on it gets trimmed back  to more of a ""munchie menu"" so if you want something in particular- you need to get there before 11. We were there on a Wednesday night so it wasn't excessively crowded or smoky.  Parking is limited but available on the surrounding streets.  Overall, I think it goes on my visit list when I am in the neighborhood looking for a bite to eat and some friendly conversation.",0.9571,0.876,0.098,0.026,0.5134325396825397
