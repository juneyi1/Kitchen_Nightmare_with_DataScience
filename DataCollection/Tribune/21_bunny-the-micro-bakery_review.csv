2016-04-21,5.0,"Went into Bunny a few weeks after they opened and picked up a couple donuts for my boyfriend and I. They were amazing. Earlier this week we went back and enjoyed their breakfast sandwiches and shared a biscuit. The sandwiches were fresh and super yummy. I opted for the sausage (lamb and spiced perfectly) on my sandwich and that was one of the best decisions I've ever made. The bread was light and airy and a perfect vessel for the hearty breakfast sandwich. Next time I go in, I'm definitely going to try one of their toasts and grab a bottle of cold brew.",0.9829,0.748,0.252,0.0,0.5619047619047619

There is only one kind of donut available. it is a glazed donut unlike any other donut at the local specialty donut shops. A bit doughy and had that funnel cake -fried quality but lovely- just have to eat it fresh. The owner is very attentive to providing great service. That said, the wait for food was very long and this isn't your big brunch spot- so as other yelpers say, it's for a light breakfast at a high price point for what you get relative to portion sizes.

Sorry, but they can make cupcakes out of solid gold fairy poop, and I wouldn't go 5 minutes out of my way to go there, never mind the almost-an-hour it took to travel to this supposed ""hot spot.""

2016-04-05,4.0,"The number one tip I have about Bunny is to check their website/twitter/facebook before you visit them. They have a habit of being closed during their posted hours. For example, they are closed tomorrow, 4/6 to ""celebrate"" their chef winning a best new chef award. Another time they were closed for renovations just a few weeks after they opened. They also close if they sell out of things, which is understandable. Luckily, I live close by, but I would hate to imagine someone travelling to visit this place to find it closed during posted operating hours. Okay, now that I have that out of the way, I have to say their food is amazing! My friend and I tried the breakfast sandwich and the ricotta toast. Both blew us away. Seating is limited, but seems to open up pretty quickly as we waited 3 minutes for a spot. Otherwise, you can just take it to go and find a nice bench to use while you eat.

Salmon Poke - Favorite breakfast item here! Toast layered with thin slices of cucumber, bite-sized salmon pieces, and egg yolk. Protein-packed and super delicious.

I go during the week and try to pick mid-morning as they tend to be less busy. They are very thoughtful about each ingredient and where it is sourced from and how the plate is plated. I have had the salmon poke which I loved, the tartar and then they have ""dutch-oven"" one-off plates of the day or couple of days. My favorite was lobster bisque which was divine and today I was in and they had chamomile, corn and shrimp risotto. It can get very crowded and cozy which you either are fine with or this will not be your style place. The atmosphere is more like a place on the Lower East side of New York or Williamsburg than Chicago. Oh and I really love their doughnuts. Like any place, it has a totally different vibe when there are a few people in the place versus every seat taken and a line.

This is the kind of bakery where somebody decided to take a cakey brioche, then put sugar on it and brulee it into an amazing crunchy carmamel coating, then decided THAT was still inadequate and smeared nutella on it.  And you know what?  It's amazing.  Probably the second best bakery in the city of Chicago.",0.9845,0.701,0.272,0.027,0.7033333333333335

2016-03-02,2.0,"If you're excited about this place give it a try, don't let this review stop you.  The food in all fairness is fine, if not great at times.  However this place has a very frustrating layout. (Don't get me wrong it's totally cute)  It's a tiny ""bakery"" with 6 seats, so form should follow function, with 6 seats it should focus on take away food in theory, Sadly that's not the practice. There were only 2 baked goods when I visited. Due to the line and lack of elbo room we asked the staff what was good for take away they suggested everything on the lunch menu was dine in. Which is fine. But when the whole resteraunt is 6 chairs and a line of people breathing down your neck, it's hard to enjoy anything.  Dining in is nothing but issues: If you get a glass of water, they have a cute, but incredibly inefficent water cooler that takes forever to pour water out. Using it you take up the space for people to cream up their coffee, also, it puts you in the way of the line, which was not the nicest bunch of people. (Not the restaurants fault of course)  Silverware is not given with the meals so you have to get up and retrieve some, which is hard when you are sharing a bench with strangers and sandwiched by the line of people. As a tall guy I banged my knee on the table, which sent that loud clang of dishes and silver ware thru the whole shared table, keeping people from enjoying their food. The kitchen is huge. For a place that claims to be a micro bakery, it's kitchen is larger than Baker Miller's, which is a full size bakery/restaurant. If you wish to focus on food recommended for dine in, maybe sacrifice half the space of the kitchen and fit more seating in the dining area?  Back to what's most important: Food, it's good, not all of it worth the price, sadly. We had fermented veggie gnocchi, raspberry cookies, buttered toast with jam, and a bread boule. Gnocchi was the stand out, very nice soft pillowy dumplings. Sharp veggies, and a very silky and briney broth. It really is a great dish and at $9 it's well priced. Toast for $5 is not so great, it's fine the bread was nothing exceptional. Cookie was nice, oaty with a nice patch of sour sweet fruit. Last was the flax bread boule. It's an ok bread, small for a boule, and way to small for $10. I'm not cheap, but if you are going to charge high quality prices your food you best match that quality. There was a time you could buy a boule 2-3 times that size for $6 at Cellar Door and that's one of the best breads in the city.  Suggestion? Focus on more baked goods. It's impossible to enjoy yourself dining in due to space restraints, Raise the shared table to counter height and ditch the chairs. encourage guests to eat there, but don't set it up so it encourages people to stay longer than necessary.  Your food's not bad, I just wish there was a way I could enjoy it more.",0.9976,0.767,0.179,0.054,0.6042293906810035

The brioche was fine but honestly I could've (should've) bought a whole loaf from Treasure Island that would've tasted pretty similarly. The donut was equally small. While the texture was good, it tasted like it was fried in old oil. Do not get the hype. I guess they are taking their status as ""tiniest bakery in town"" to heart by also providing tiny food. Few boules are worth paying $10 and these didn't look as if they were. It's ironic that they had a copy of Tartine's bread book on the shelf when these boules look like a pale comparison.  I suppose this place will manage to thrive because a lot of people in this city can't seem to separate hype from reality. But I found it to be quite a disappointment.

Everything you'd expect from a whimsical, passionate, Michelin starred chef's version of a bakery. In addition to the wonderful bakery items, what truly makes Bunny special is the amazing breakfast and lunch fare. Top notch ingredients that are perfectly executed and elevate standard brunch fare to a much higher level. My toad in the hole on sourdough bread topped with immensely flavorful beef tartare was truly incredible. The loaf of squid ink and blood bread was also fantastic. Highly recommend the mushroom tea; possibly the best tea I've consumed! Love the yuzu gummies and the salted caramels as a sweet finish. If you visit on a weekend, definitely recommend arriving on the early side as it will likely be crowded. Since everything is made from scratch, items do begin to run out as the morning progresses. There is also limited seating (it is a tiny space - hence the name Micro Bakery); reportedly they are hopefully making an arrangement with a nearby coffee venue to be able to utilize their seating. Also some patience is needed on weekends, again since everything is made from scratch and the kitchen is small (the product is well worth the wait and there is a friendly, happy vibe making the wait more pleasant). This is a venue featuring quality over quantity; expect to pay a few bucks more than a run-of-the-mill breakfast venue, but the quality will be readily apparent and is totally worth the cost.

Now, the French pastries need a lot of work, as their texture is totally off, having an overbaked exterior and a soggy interior. The canele had an overcamerlized crust and a soggy interior. The gougere suffered the same fate. While it had a very nice cheesy flavor, again it was soggy on the inside and overbaked on the outside.
