2016-08-20,5.0,"M Vie Chicago located at 1372 West Grand Ave. in Chicago (Behind the Brown Door) rates a 10 out of 10 for a wonderful dining experience. I recently took my wife and son to dinner there for her birthday having discovered this establishment while attending a business reception there earlier this summer. I assure you we will return to M Vie's often! From the chic bar with extensive top-shelf libations selections and a not too intrusive flat screen TV (Olympics were on so I peeked), to the dim lighting which created a warm and comforting environment, there is a perfect ambience at M Vie's that makes this a place you want to be from the moment you step in from outside the brown door. The bartender who, at the owner's direction served as or waiter also, provided the best, most attentive but non-intrusive service I think I have ever experienced, started us off with a few of their signature cocktails and wine from a list that was sufficiently ample for the discerning wine lover.  The birthday girl had a glass of the Crawford Sauvignon Blanc and the Santa Margherita  Pinot Grigio. The only disappointment of the evening was learning that they did not have the BV Cabernet Sauvignon (Napa Valley) offering available that evening though there were suitable alternative options of a Jordan Cab (Alexander Valley) and a Stag's Leap Merlot that were acceptable. Others tried a few of the signature cocktails: The Luxe - Kettle One Oranja, Luxardo bitters (Luxardo cherries upon request-get them!), Rhubarb, fresh lemon and a hint of bar sugar; Jac's Ginger - Forrester Signature, lemon, Simple Syrup, fresh Ginger and a touch of Angostura bitters; and finally, the Masters Lemonade - Whiskey (ask for Maker's Mark like my son did), fresh lemon, Simple Syrup, and a touch of sprite. Each had a distinctive flavor, were well balanced, and refreshing. The appetizers are many and varied with an assortment sufficiently diverse to provide something suitable to everyone's taste. I had the Grilled Calamari (fried is also an option) with a horseradish seafood sauce that was exquisitely prepared - not chewy or rubbery as can be the case with calamari that is not properly prepared. My son opted for a not so traditional order of Naked Chicken Wings (He got the fried ""plain"" version though baked and/or Buffalo sauce are also options). Quite tasty, marinated overnight beyond a doubt, moist on inside perfectly crisp on the outside. The Fried Green Tomatoes were the best that we have ever had anywhere--not just in Chicago, but ANYWHERE I had a cup (misnomer - this was a small bowl) of their famous Gumbo. Without a doubt, from a family with deep Louisiana roots, this gumbo was outstanding! Generous portions of jumbo shrimp, tender shredded chicken, not too spicy andouille sausage and just enough gumbo file to let you know it was cooked with love. ! I would return to M Vie just for this soup and the Fried Breen Tomato appetizer! As for our entrées, I was in a back to my roots Louisiana mood after the gumbo and appetizers, so I opted for the Shrimp & Grits. One word to describe this dish: WOW! The grits held their smoothness during dinner never becoming too firm or clumpy. The shrimp were colossal but tender and more plentiful than the standard 4 shrimp offering. Truffles, a touch of honey and hint of red pepper flake rounded this dish into shape, but it is a perfected dish due to the cheese and fresh grilled corn. You won't find this anywhere else in Chicago. Kudo's to the owners and chef--truly a wonderfully delightful dish. The birthday girl opted for the most generous portion of lamb chops I have ever seen presented in this offering. Three 5oz perfectly prepared at medium-rare succulent lamb chops seasoned only with salt, pepper and rosemary (all that was needed!), served with fresh roasted tomatoes. This may have been the star dish of the evening! Finally, our son had a tender bone-in 16oz rib eye steak served with sautéed spinach and mushrooms. Again, perfectly prepared at medium-rare. Something is offered on top of this dish (sorry, won't tell) that our waiter presented as an option that you MUST include!  If you have appetizers I caution you there may not be room for sides, but the choices are numerous, and they are all delectable. We chose four: Fresh Fried Corn (if you've never had it, try it); Grilled Asparagus; Fresh Hand Cut Fries (lightly breaded creating an interesting contrast in textures on one's pallid); and Creamy Mashed Potatoes (they also offer mashed sweet potatoes).   Sorry we did not have room for dessert. Ooops, I almost forgot. Knowing it was my wife's birthday--but we were full--our waiter brought out a large portion of their famous bread pudding (decadent, truly decadent dessert) with vanilla ice cream in a separate bowl with forks and spoons for each of us.  Without exaggeration, this was a perfect meal and exceptional dining experience. I unequivocally highly recommend M Vie Chicago for your dining pleasure.",0.9994,0.797,0.184,0.02,0.5913291139240506

I love the intimacy of the restaurant.  You kind of felt like you were in someone's home.  I had a cup of Gumbo & fried salmon entree so delish.  Try the Derby girl cocktail, so good!  I cannot wait to go back again to get the gumbo and listen to some more live music.",0.9703,0.798,0.202,0.0,0.5694444444444444

2016-06-15,1.0,"I WISH I COULD GIVE NEGATIVE STARS! Please spare yourself and do not ever in your life go to M-VIE Lounge. The gumbo tastes like soapy hot dog water. The owner doesn't know anything about customer service and they are beyond short staffed.  I attended a party at the lounge on Saturday night, in which my mother had completely rented out for her party. It's a nice small place with live music and I was just excited to celebrate with my mom and her friends. I thought we were in for an amazing night, that is until I ran into Dawn the lounge owner also known as the rudest human being I've ever in countered in my life.  Before I continue on with the review it's important to add that my mom and owner are newer friends, but I've been away for college for 4 years so I've never met her.  As stated before the place isn't that big, but on this night everything in the place seemed to be a mess. (Both cash registers were broken, there were 2 serves for a party of 50+ people, the servers were also doubling as bartender and bus boys). Everything on the menu was fairly priced, 6 bucks for beers, 12 for cocktails. I ended up ordering buffalo wings and a beer. The wings were just okay, they were served with buffalo sauce on the side because their house policy is they don't add any sauces to their food.  The party was for my mom's 50th birthday and while we were there a bunch of people were buying my mom shots and I wanted to be one of them. So I go to the owner who was now bar backing and was the only free person at the moment, I ask for 3 shots she says ""you have to order them with your server so I can make sure you pay for them"" I respond ""I've been waiting for 25 minutes for her to come to my table, I just wanna order a few shots and I'll pay for them now if that's okay"" she says ""sure"" (now at this point half of the party is getting ready to take a group shot). I take out my debit card and the owner Dawn says ""oh if you're going to pay for your food tab with a card you have to pay for these shots with cash because I get charged every time i swipe someone's card and that's not fair to me""  I say fine (even though it wasn't fine) and sit back down.  I FINALLY get my waitresses attention to order the shots and she tells the owner (the exact same three shots we spent 10 minutes arguing about) The owner pours the shots and I see my waitress add them to my tab. So I go to the owner (now my Dad is literally saying the toast for the group shot). The shots are at the end of the bar and say ""hey we're trying to get in on the group shot, our waitress gave you the order can you hand us the shot please "" the owner says ""no, the waitress has to hand them to you herself since you ordered them with her"" I turn around to locate my sever and she's on the dance floor having a good time!At this point I say keep the shots to the owner it's okay. The waitress comes over to our table TWENTY MINUTES LATER with the shots, we inform her that we canceled them. She asks why and we explain. We ask for the bill and that took another hour.  I know my story wasn't a big deal but it was the sheer fact that she did everything she could to be rude. Over all it was a terrible experience and Dawn the owner's attitude was beyond unprofessional. There are better more deserving businesses.",0.9821,0.833,0.108,0.058,0.5240310077519382

When we arrived there was already a set in progress. The hostess greater us and asked if were dinning or going to bar. Of course we wanted to taste the food, she informed us it would be a 45 minute wait. The place is small and interment so the wait time seemed ideal. We were encouraged to go to the bar until our table was ready.  The band was great, the bar was awesome. Ove recently began to enjoy bourbon and the old fashioned I had is worth going back for. However after about 45 minutes & a cocktail. I suggested we get something small to eat while we wait for our table considering I had yet to see any available tables. The bartender graciously informed that the kitchen was closed! How is that possible and I'm waiting for a table? I look over and the hostess stand is closed and the hostess is at the end of the bar, laptop in had, chilling. So here we are a few drinks in and starved.

2016-03-12,2.0,"Where to start. The live music was nice, but I will never eat here again. First of all, $9 for a glass of wine that was maybe 3-4 oz at best, is a violation of my wallet. Second, the food was very very bland and overpriced. I ordered the shrimp and grits. It had corn and a sweet flavor which did not pair well with the barbecue sauce and the shrimp. I also only had 4 shrimp in my $16 entree. The grits were very bland and had no creaminess or flavor. The shrimp was also bland. We had peach cobbler for dessert and I could immediately tell that the peaches were directly from a can. And then didn't even try to doctor it up with seasonings. It was literally canned peaches and frozen pastry dough. The crust wasn't even brown and buttery. The peaches, since they were canned, we're slimy and watery. My girlfriend had the gumbo which was equally as bland and disappointing. Service was sub par at best. Ideally I would give this place one star for the food and service and two starts for the live music. If you're going on a date and want to actually talk to your partner, forget about it, because the loud live music makes it impossible. Needless to say I'm still on the hunt for a black ownef restaurant that has amazing food and amazing service. I know it's out there somewhere.",0.9642,0.815,0.125,0.06,0.6659722222222223

2015-03-23,4.0,"I came here a couple weeks ago on Thursday night for a b-day/going away dinner.  First things first, the live music was great.  The ambiance really doesn't allow for a conversational dining experience because of the music but we all had a great jam session nonetheless.  Secondly, the food was really good.  I split the fried green tomato appetizer, had a cup of gumbo and the caprese salad.  No complaints here.  My only recommendation would be the timeliness of the waiter service. While I appreciate, they aren't rushing you out the door to turn tables,  It took a while for the drinks to come out, we ordered them right when we sat down and they came a few minutes before our food.   We weren't necessarily in a rush but this was a bit of a nuisance.  Also I had a train to catch, I asked for our bill and about 25 mins later we still were waiting.  Luckily, for technology I sent the money to another person in our party via Chase Quickpay and they paid for me, otherwise I would have missed my train.   FYI they only take 4 cards on a bill, so if you have a large party bring cash.",0.9728,0.804,0.146,0.05,0.4973985890652557

I will second the unwelcoming attitude of the hostess who inquired if I had a reservation for the open 50 seats. I did search if I needed to make one but the website stated it was only needed for parties of six or more and they aren't an Open Table participant. Additionally the valet service drew a map for me to the awesome mahogany door that really could use signage. I will actually repeat the summary that I posted on my fb page-where incidentally I did not identify the restaurant. Goes something like this... Trying to be supportive, but if you bring me croissants from the grocery store and unripe semi fried green tomatoes AND you are out of lamb chops, pork chops and only have two steaks left...are you really a restaurant or another version of my kitchen? IJS? All in all our server was awesome, attentive and very apologetic for things beyond his control.

2015-01-25,2.0,"I really wanted to provide raving reviews for MVie. Unfortunately I cannot.  I had high hopes for MVie. I recommend the owners focus on being an intimate place for specialty drinks, music ie Jazz and offer small plates and awesome desserts. The appetizers were much better than the entrees.  Quick Summary: A quite, obscure and intimate place on the near west wide that serves over priced food and drinks. Details: It's extremely easy to miss because the restaurant does not have an type of signage. It's right next door to Bella Note. There is a beautiful wooden door and an ATM machine outside; I found the ATM machine a bit peculiar because I didn't know if this meant the restaurant didn't accept credit cards. I opened the  wooden door and still no signage to indicate I was at the right place. I was meeting my dear friend for dinner and drinks. The main door opens up to a small space and a large dark curtain that you open up to a glass door. I open the glass door and was pleasantly surprised to see tables and a dimly lit room with a bar. I was warmly greeted by a hostess at a wooden podium right next to the door. Again, I found the placement of the podium oddly placed because the dining space is very small. Nevertheless, I immediately saw my girlfriend and sat down to white table cloth service.  Service:  Our waiter was friendly and attentive throughout the night and tried very hard to make sure we were having a good time. Drinks: It took a long time for the bartender to make our drinks. There were only 8 people in that night that's including the staff. So, it wasn't busy and not everyone was ordering drinks. Our drinks came out separately. You never serve drinks separately. There was another long wait before my friend's drink was served. Did they distill the alcohol to order?  I had a pomegranate margarita strong ;0) and tasty. My girlfriend seemed to enjoy her fruity martini. Was it worth the wait? No. Nothing impressive or to rave about.  Bread: Served 2 mini croissants. Cold and semi dried out mini croissants served with butter. Marianos and Costco make fresh and tasty croissants at a reasonable price.  Appetizers: We tried the fried green tomatoes and fried chili shrimp. We were served approximately 6 fried green tomatoes that were covered in shredded iceberg lettuce for a garnish. Why iceberg lettuce as a garnish?! Don't know. The green tomatoes were crispy on the outside and firm on the inside and not greasy. We were served 4 large shrimp. Crispy and hot drizzled with a sweet chili sauce on top. It reminded me of the sweet chili sauce you can buy at the grocery store. Dinner: Unfortunately we came the day (Saturday at 6:30 pm) when ""pork chops were on back order and only 2 ribeyes were left."" We regrouped and decided to order the blackened chicken and the ""special"" baked chicken. The waiter recommended the baked chicken because he personally tried it for lunch earlier that day and loved it.  My girlfriend didn't like the blackened chicken fillet and mashed sweet potatoes. It was a thin flattened chicken breast fillet with Lowry's seasoning salt on it. She ordered an arugula salad that had currants, green apple slices, and mound of blue cheese on top.  My ""special"" baked chicken with gravy on the side was shockingly dry. Did I get a portion of the same baked chicken my waiter ate earlier that day for lunch. That's the only way to dry out a baked chicken by keeping it in the oven.  For $23.00, I was served a dried out small leg and a very small thigh. If it were any smaller it could be called a Cornish hen and I'm not exaggerating in the slightest bit. I was absolutely shocked. I've never been served such a small portion of chicken in a restaurant.  Typically a dark meat never dries out during the baking process. but somehow MVies chef succeeded to dry out a little leg and thigh. There was absolutely no flavor or semblance of seasoning. Thankfully, I substituted the rice with an order or mashed potatoes but had to pay extra $6.00. That was the only highlight of the dish but the mashed potatoes were overly worked and not light. Did I was served a dollop of mash?  Lastly, my meal came with a petite salad with balsamic dressing. Here's my problem...it was a cold iceberg salad similar to what you'll find at the grocery store...the pre-made Dole salad bags. The so called balsamic salad dressing was just italian dressing that you'd purchase at the grocery store too. balsamic dressing is brown in color this was creamy white.  It appears the chef's only speciality is knowing how to fry food. :0/  Background music: Loud 90s r&b slow jams.  So disappointed. $114.00 between two people should provide good food and excellent drinks. Overall, the two stars are for the waiter's attentiveness and attempt to make us feel comfortable throughout the night; and the interior decor. The concept of an intimate dining experience is spot on but MVie really needs to get a new chef.",0.9919,0.88,0.088,0.032,0.541448755560326
2015-01-05,5.0,"Talk about an intimate dining experience!  I can picture someone taking their significant other here to propose to them.  Why?  The exterior of the restaurant is very discreet (but not in a bad way); beautifully donned in the finest wood on the outside, it is easy to miss this place since there is no sign out front besides the chalkboard sign on the ground.  I believe however that this gave the restaurant its intimate, ""get-away-from-it-all"" type of essence.  The inside of the restaurant is dimly lit with beautiful old-time, but modern, Chicago style furniture.  The restaurant is fairly small and has a walk-up bar where you can sit, drink, and dine. I can picture this place in a movie where all of the affluent, jazzy men and women convene for intimate meetings, romantic dinners, or private business discussions (oh how daringly eloquent!). I ordered the Sweet Pepper and Veggie Pasta with Chicken.  Man... the last time I remembered eating something so fresh and delicious was when I visited Dublin, Ireland where everything was grown and produced locally (not packaged and frozen).  The prices are a little on the high side here, but the quality speaks volumes on behalf of the prices.  I get nostalgic (and hungry) every time I think about it.  From what I hear, the owner really puts her foot into the quality of the food here to make sure it is top notch. Other dishes one must try here are the Shrimp and Grits, the Gumbo and for dessert, the Ms. Chris Bread Pudding.  All of these are excellent.  As far as the drinks, my husband ordered a Moscow Mule, and he was super stoked to see it be served properly in a copper mug instead of a cocktail glass (many restaurants fail at this).   5 big fat stars.",0.991,0.83,0.147,0.024,0.5611411411411412
2014-11-17,1.0,"During my first visit to MVie, I was impressed with the cozy space, and the owner who worked right alongside her staff.  I was there for a friend's birthday and had a great time, until the end of the night when I found that the bartender lost my debit card. After searching thoroughly, the owner apologized and said the bartender must have mistakenly given to someone else. She assured me that if I called my bank and asked to have any charges made to the card cancelled, she'd accept the cancellation. She also gave me her personal number and told me to call her first thing in the morning to follow up, so that she'd know that everything had worked out.  I called the next morning as requested at what I thought was a reasonable time, I think around 11, and she acted as though I was bothering her ... I told her that I was able to cancel my card. She apologized again and we ended our discussion.  As she promised, the charges were canceled and I was able to get a new card from my bank problem. I went back with a friend, because she was considering M Vie as a location for her party, but she had never been, and she wanted to see the space.  We walked in, and there was no signage, and no hostess, but we were shot dirty looks from behind the bar. When we got to the bar we realized that we'd unintentionally walked into a private event. My friend talked to the owner to hammer out some details.  She didn't remember me when I reintroduced myself, but no biggie. I reminded her that I was recently there for a private event and the bar lost my debit card .  She snapped back that someone returned the card the day after my visit, and that I could have it back if I wanted. Of course I replied no thank you, because as I told her during our previous phone conversation I'd canceled the card, so it was of no use to me.  My friend nonetheless decided to host her party there. I attended her party and walked in prepared to pay cash, just in case. I brought a friend with me, and we ordered drinks which were made well. My friend asked someone working behind the bar to borrow an ink pen. Unbeknownst to him, he was talking to the owner who told him that one of the servers would have a pen, and then walked away.  I'll let my friend decide whether she wants to  yelp about the details of her experience planning a party at M Vie. I just know that before my experiences at M Vie, I have never been to a bar or restaurant with such a lack of professionalism, and with such little regard for the customers. I love supporting small businesses, but I can't be treated rudely when I'm spending my hard earned money.

2014-05-19,1.0,"I was looking for a new place to try and my niece recommended M Vie.  What a big disappointment. First of all I was told when I called that I needed a reservation, not sure why because there was a total of 7 people in the restaurant, on a Saturday. The restaurant was very dark.The drinks were very good, the waitress was very nice, but the food was very bland.  We had to send back a couple of dishes because they were under cooked.  Will not go back.",0.2292,0.886,0.069,0.045,0.500563973063973
2014-04-03,5.0,"This place is the epitomy of ""grown N sexy"" The owner is down to Earth and professional. My fiance and I went 2 x in a week. The drinks are good, the food is delish and the prices are excellent. We had the same server both times and she suggested a great martini that I look forward to having again. The place is small so reserving a table for dinner is recommended, we did and had great ""table for 2"" for the incredible live music. This is an ideal date night spot or just a ""girlfriends"" dinner and drink night. 5 STARS FROM ME & a repeat patron",0.9732,0.792,0.208,0.0,0.6178240740740741
2014-03-30,5.0,"Stopped in tonight with two old friends to see what all the buzz is about. It strikes you from the curb as an old school speakeasy/hide away joint.  When you walk in through the curtain what is revealed is a very stylish,  warm and tasteful room with photos of jazz greats, bridges, and the Eiffel Tower. The room feels comfortable, the wait staff knows the ins  and outs of the menu and the bar casts a beautiful glow off of the tin ceiling of the bar. From appetizers to dessert the food was exceptional. We had the tilapia, the blackened chicken, the fried oysters, peach cobbler, the fried corn and more. The proprietor, Dawn Hendricks-Milhouse visits the tables welcoming you and reassures you that you made a wise choice coming to M Vie tonight. I will be back, probably one of the many live jazz nights.",0.9484,0.839,0.133,0.028,0.6269230769230769

2014-01-05,1.0,"We went, we saw, we won't go back. This place has a great layout for a bar.... maybe. A restaurant? Nah.  Service? Eh. Hipster behind the bar was too busy looking at himself in the mirror that sits behind the yellow glow of the bar. At first glance, we thought ""nice drink list."" When we asked for suggestions, favorites, etc. we had the drink menu handed back to us and told that there is a description below the name of the drink.  Yes, even my c- average in school afforded me the luxury of learning to read. That wasn't the question.... Music? Eh, there were about 10 people in the bar, so everyone pretty much had to listen to what the owner/manager/intoxicated patron(?) that was there when our group of 5 arrived.  Not sure what the 12 people that gave this 5 stars were thinking (or if they are all part owners/managers there), but I have yet to see more than 2 people walk in or out of there at any given time when I drive down Grand Ave.",0.9306,0.899,0.095,0.007,0.5038194444444444
2013-12-16,1.0,"Wow. This place is a joke. The owners, servers, etc could care less if they are open of not. It's pathetic. The bartender who was also the server(?)   is the niece of the owner and who like her aunt just doesn't care about service on any level.  If fact, we were there at 6:30pm on a Saturnday night, and she was the only one scheduled to work.  I guess it's a good thing that not a soul other than myself and wife were there. I wouldn't spend someone else's money if I would ever go back, which I won't. The service, and over priced food&drinks makes this place just a complete waste of everything.  DONT GO!!!!! ****1 star because you can't do 0 or negative.",0.9689,0.792,0.187,0.021,0.4856060606060606
2013-12-14,5.0,"Fantastic everything - food, service, live music, ambiance! I took my husband & friend, a well traveled VIP, to M Vie.  We were very impressed! If you want to get away from the touristy crowd this is the place for you.  It's sophisticated yet modern, upscale yet relaxed. The restaurant is very small, giving it an exclusive vibe.  It doesn't even have a sign, you just have to know to go behind the wooden door.  Once you're inside, it's all the way live. We went on a Tuesday night when there was the live band, playing jazz and old school R&B.  we reminisced and had such a good time we didn't want to leave.   The food was delicious. I took photos of everyone's dish and posted them here. This is also a great place to have an intimate party or reception on other nights of the week when it's less crowded. I have my birthday party here on I think Friday or Saturday and it was perfect because everyone was able to come sit and enjoy.",0.9944,0.718,0.282,0.0,0.577936507936508

We kept walking by during the summer and wondering what was hidden behind that lovely wooden facade with no signage. When we finally went inside, we discovered a great little cocktail bar. The drinks were tasty and strong, the fried green tomatoes were delicious, and the jazz was great. Be sure to have the Old Chicago cocktail...so yummy! I'll definitely be back to try their other dishes and take advantage of their half-priced bottles of wine on Fridays!",0.9884,0.655,0.326,0.019,0.5498366013071895
2013-10-11,4.0,"I had a fantastic evening at M Vie! The bar and bartender were raved about in everything I'd read so I knew I had to order a cocktail. I tried a new drink, ""October Nights""  and it was AMAZING!  I love a specially rimmed glass and mine had a gingerbread rim.  YUM! We also had the shrimp chilli appetizer which was the perfect combination of sweet and spice.  My nephew and I fought over the last couple of shrimp in that one.  I ordered the pasta with chicken for dinner and my teenaged niece and nephew had buffalo wings.  Our food was hot and freshly prepared.  We definitely enjoyed it.  We also ordered the mashed potatoes and a side of broccoli which were quickly devoured by my youngster. Finally, we ordered bread pudding and ice cream. The bread pudding was JUST the right texture for me (I do not like it soggy).   I had a pretty tough crowd with me (kids) but we all found something we really enjoyed.  Highly recommend the cocktails!!",0.9745,0.809,0.166,0.025,0.6974572795625427
2013-08-14,5.0,"I love this restaurant although I went right pass it.  It doesn't  look like a typical restaurant on the outside.  It 's front is enclosed with  beautifully carved wood and the door small on the side.  It reminds me of a private club from outside.  But when i stepped in it was a very posh small intimate dining room with a beautifully designed bar.  It's where one would want to getaway.  The food, awesome.  There menu is diverse in that it serves the big steak lovers and me the seafood person.  I also had some fried green tomatoes and some corn really good.  i had a Sangria which taste so good I wanted a second.  I couldn't finish the second one because the first on slipped up on me. It is both fine dinning and very comfortable.  Homey but very nice. The staff made me feel very comfortable. I always evaluate the bathrooms, these were very clean and decorated so you thought you were at home.  I give it a five star because it has excellent  food, intimacy and reminds me of a neat little restaurant I love years ago off of Michigan Ave.",0.9929,0.759,0.234,0.007,0.5447874149659864
2013-06-20,4.0,"M Vie is pretty beautiful on the outside and inside.  However, they are new and the décor is still 'getting there' and there is one aspect of the restaurant that I didn't love - no windows in the entire restaurant.  Once you enter, you really are closed off from the outside  world, which I guess can be good if you want privacy.  But now, the most important thing: the food!  We liked every dish we ordered - the Gumbo was AMAZING - hearty, spicy, full of shrimp and sausage.  It was so  good and so filling I almost didn't need to order anything else.  We also had the fried oysters, which I never had before and really loved too.  The salmon was good but a little bit on the dry side. Mashed potatoes and mushrooms were perfect. No room for dessert.  Great service, a beautiful bar and nice clean bathrooms made it a winner for us and we would go back, but most likely would do takeout, especially on that ridiculous Gumbo on a cold night!",0.9907,0.708,0.25,0.042,0.6606304985337242
2013-05-27,1.0,Interesting that both of the other reviews for this restaurant have never reviewed  on Yelp before now. I smell a rat! This place will not last. The waiter was actually scared to speak.  I had to have him repeat the specials three times because he was speaking to his feet.  I could not believe they had a waiter at a new place that was actually one of worst waiters I have ever come across. NO personality and stumbling over every interaction. The food was mediocre at best.  Fried Green tomatoes we average and the salmon was actually cooked well and tasty but NOT worth the $26 price tag at this type of casual restaurant with no ambiance and the owner interrupting us asking for feedback while I'm in the middle of an evening out with my husband. If you want feedback and testers offer a free opening and ask for comments.  As a Paying customer this is not my job.,0.5684,0.828,0.1,0.072,0.4039299242424242
