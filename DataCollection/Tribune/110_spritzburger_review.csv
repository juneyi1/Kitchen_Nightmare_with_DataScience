2016-03-14,5.0,"**SPRITZBURGER HAS CLOSED 3/13/16. They lost their lease** COST: $20 (Deviled Eggs, Kimchi Burger, Bottomless Sangria) I'm only submitting this review to honor SpritzBurger in the gone too soon heavens because I repeat, SpritzBurger closed yesterday. Yes! It's very unfortunate since I had such a great time the first and only time I ate here. I forgot what they called the kimchi slash pulled pork burger but it was amazing. Pulled pork was mixed into the patty and it was fantastic. Normally the burger would cost $15 plus about $5 for the deviled eggs. However, Tuesday through Thursday they'll have a $20 app + entree + UNLIMITED SANGRIA.  I'll miss you Spritz. Hopefully the owners find it in their heart to open this place elsewhere or work on a new venture! I'll follow them!",0.9352,0.771,0.156,0.073,0.6027056277056279
2016-02-15,2.0,"OK. So this is how last Sunday went. I was craving a good brunch and convinced my husband to take me to one (he didn't have an appetite big enough for a brunch). The options were between SpritzBurger and one other place, because we were really short on time. I've been here once before and didn't enjoy the food at all, but Thomas, the forgiving man that he is, suggested that we should to give them another shot. And so we did.  I had the Crabby Bennie, and he opted for a burger. His was better than mine, but not great. Our food lacked seasoning, I kept shake-shake-shaking the shaker! And there was waaaaaaaaay too much Hollandaise on my Benedict. I had only one and just the crab off the other. Thomas' fries weren't seasoned at all.  The two stars are for both our visits to the place. I don't remember what we ordered the last time, but I know we had burgers and they were a major disappointment.",0.2625,0.861,0.078,0.061,0.4107843137254902
2016-02-10,5.0,"This review is long overdue, but just moved out of the city and this is a place I'm going to miss going to.  We had some memorable meals at the original Hearty Boys restaurant, and weren't quite sure what to expect when they changed the concept, but Spritz Burger has been even more popular with us. The goal of making a ""neighborhood spot for a Wednesday night"" has been met in spades. The burgers never disappoint, but I love the Chick-Fil-Gay sandwich the most. My wife loves the grilled caesar salad. The Mac 'n Cheeto is every bit as good as you hope. Service is always great - shout out to Oliver specifically as he's our usual server and never misses a thing.  Drink menu is always creative and once my wife became pregnant, the nonalcholic options were super helpful and made her feel less left out.  The only bad experience we had was with a hostess that refused to seat us outside (oh yeah, the patio is awesome for those great Chicago summer nights) despite us having called ahead by 30 minutes.

She suggested the kale salad, without the cheese and bacon, and brought us some pickled veggies to start. Yum. They had a good selection of beers. I had the Zombie. Again, yum. And at the end of our meal she brought us complementary drinks. Obviously not the best place to eat as a vegan because of the limited menu for compassionate eaters, but I sure felt welcome and they really tried to make our meal special.

Even the fries and tater tots as sides were forgettable. On top of the that the desert was just ok. (Sensing a trend).

I also got the burger pink, and it was perfectly cooked.   My friend got the bleu cheese burger with bacon, which was my 2nd choice.

I was honestly very frustrated and annoyed by the end of our meal  I may have been able to dismiss it, if the food was good, but sadly it was very plain. I was a little disappointed that they only cook their burgers two ways: ""pink"" and ""not pink."" I prefer to order my burgers medium rare and the ""pink"" ordering really put the temp more at medium or medium well. Very disappointing. I don't know why they can't cook their burgers to order like other restaurants in the area. The burger itself was fine, the fixins were okay but nothing special.

2015-07-21,1.0,"Tried this place out last Friday after a show at the Oracle.  I was really excited to try it because I have heard that the creators have an awesome reputation in the restaurant business.  This place seemed cute enough and had an interesting menu. As we were standing outside looking at the menu, this blonde woman (who in retrospect must have some relationship with the manager), was super convincing in telling us that ""everything on the menu is amazing"" and we should ""go on in""....  She said the shrimp puffs and Chick-Fil-Gay were especially notable. We decided to try Spritz and we were so, so, so disappointed.  We ordered a spritz tamarind drink, a rhubarb mojito, fried beets, shrimp puffs, a chicken sandwich (the Chick-Fil-Gay), a side of the Mac and Cheeto and black pepper parmesan fries..... There were only 2 other tables in a mostly empty restaurant and the food took FOREVER to arrive (I had to ask 2 different servers for it)!!!! Tamarind Spritz drink: My sister liked it Rhubarb Mojito: Tasted like nothing but rum.  I didn't like it.  Fried Beets: Tasted good but were way, way too over-fried so that the breading was almost black! Shrimp Puffs:  Soggy as soggy can be (they're supposed to be fried).  They tasted like they had been sitting under a heat lamp.  Ugh. ""Buttermilk"" Chicken Sandwich (Chick-Fil-Gay) - The bun tasted stale, the chicken breast in it was tiny, flavorless and dry, the breading on the chicken breast was over-fried and black; the ""greens"" on it were scare and mush....  It was repulsive.  We pushed it aside. Mac and Cheeto - the Cheetos on top were STALE!!!  Nothing is worse than a STALE CHEETO! OMG!  The mac and cheese under the stale Cheetos was bland.  We pushed it aside. The upgraded fries:  Were like weird cafeteria, spongy fries and didn't seem like they came from real potatoes.  Off to the side. When we told our server about the sandwich and sides, he got the manager.  The manager came by and took them off the bill and said something like ""When you guys come back I'll give you some deserts or something...""  Wah???  Wouldn't you rather give us the deserts on the house NOW?  So we actually come back???    I could tell the manager was NOT happy with us.   If I had a business, I would want to know if a customer wasn't happy and would appreciate a customer that tries to remedy the problem in person (instead of posting a yelp review)...  Since our unsatisfactory experience was a super inconvenience for him (he really made us feel this way), I decided to post this review.

2015-07-03,4.0,"I actually give this place four and a half stars. The ambience was great. Classily relaxed. Service is attentive, thorough and friendly. The food was good, but a bit much with some selections. Coco Chanel said ""Before you leave the house, look in the mirror and remove one accessory."" She also said ""Less is always more."" When trying to be classy, you have to stop yourself just short of being gaudy. But when ""two chefs collide,"" a bit extra is left in the mix. I had the shrimp puffs to start. They were excellent on their own, full of flavor, a great mix of texture, but came with two different sauces; an avocado lime and a sweet and sour. They were unnecessary, but I'd have to choose the sweet and sour even though it wasn't the one listed on the menu. I tried their spritz flight. Good flavors of nonalcoholic house made sodas. The berry seemed to complement the shrimp puffs best, though the lemon zest made it have a tad bitter aftertaste.  I saved the rest of the mandarin for the Merguez burger. Good thing. It was able to cut through the saltiness. When you have an excellently seasoned lamb patty and phenomenal tzatziki sauce you don't also need sundried tomato. I took half home because it was good, but just too much salt at once. Their fries were tasty, perfectly seasoned. But again, they give a house ketchup to go with it. It was closer to marinara sauce in consistency to me, but still tasty. I finished with the tamarind drink. By its consistency I thought I'd like it least but it was the most ""soda"" of the trio. At the end of the meal it was a sweet, simple treat. Long story short, their items are super good; so good in fact that they can stand to be toned down and spread out, not combined in such quantity.",0.9979,0.741,0.232,0.028,0.4812543133195307

Our server was a friendly and lovely guy who asked our cocktail orders right away (after we asked for the special Game of Thrones menu - do it!) and then disappeared for so long that my woeful staring at the cocktails waiting to be brought over to our table prompted the bartender to escape her post and bring them to us. This happened twice during our meal - I'm guessing our server was waiting on the kitchen/to run food, but maybe that's where runners would come in handy? That was the only major blip on my radar, though! Our food was fantastic. We were brought a jar of pickled delicacies from the kitchen to start with. I love it when restaurants do this - even if it's just a little somethin' somethin' on the house, it's a great gesture!  We ordered poutine to start, and I do have to say it didn't live up to my expectations. The cheese curds (or should I say, curd, because there was barely any cheese) were melted on one side of the fries and the gravy was at the bottom of the dish. When I think of poutine, I think of plump pieces of white cheese atop fries with the whole fattening plate of fat smothered in gravy. While the taste was there with the sage-gravy, it just was so-so. I had chick-fil-gay and it was tender, crispy and juicy. SO good. Tots were fried to perfection.

2015-01-19,4.0,"After fits and starts and a couple odd concepts (tv-dinner-themed 70s kitch diner anyone?), the team behind SpritzBurger nailed it. The burgers are inventive, oh so tasty and reasonably priced. The Gale Gand buns take the burgers to the next level - carb heaven. And from an ambience standpoint, the cute little bar and one of the better patios in Lakeview are both wins. (And thank God for no TVs -- my big pet peeve anywhere that's not a sports or video bar). Brunch isn't fussy but it's a step above your boring eggs benny / chilaquiles / breakfast burrito mix that seems to dominate Chicago's brunch menus.

Once my dad arrived we were able to order some pickles and the fried beets.  The pickles were delicious!!  I get what they're going for with the beets but as a beet lover I think they do just fine w/o the breading.  But fried things with cheese are never wrong.   There's a lot to choose from - we had a hard time deciding which sandwich to try.  I got the chick-fil-gay with the bacon greens on the side and the cheesy truffle fries.  My boyfriend got his beef burger with the tots and they were great!  My stepmom opted for the mac 'n cheese which was also heavenly.  I tried a little without the brisket on it.  I ended up taking 1/2 of my sandwich home b/c I knew we were going to want some of Gale's desserts.  They all enjoyed Gale's root beer while I had some brown liquor cocktails.  They were made perfectly.  I had the barrel aged Manhattan, and a CH boulevardier.  My favorite was the dessert cocktail called the Chat Noir.   We tried the chocolate cake, lemon meringue, and apple tart.  I loved the ice creams that came with them.  The cake was dense and yummy but I wanted more out of it.  Maybe frosting?   We loved the service, the food & drink, and the prices!  We'll be back for sure.",0.9971,0.773,0.223,0.005,0.6652004741290456

We were greeted with a chipmunk painting on the wall, cool bulb fixtures, a fresh interior, high quality napkins and complimentary pickled carrots and celery at the table (which were good and I don't even like pickles normally).  They had familiar burgers (in pink and not pink, meaning medium and well done), non beef burgers, and specials.  I opted for a fried beet appetizer with a goat cheese dip - um, yum! The texture on this was great, panko and light, crispy and the goat cheese dip was creamy and delicious! I think they were trying to wreck my look on my February beach trip. But seriously, they hit this one out of the park. I went for the special of the day which was tilapia and rosemary steamed in foil and arrived -- in foil. This was a little weird at first but I understand why they did this, to keep the butter and aromas in the fish, which can ordinarily be a little flavorless. Back to beach prep, tilapia is pretty damn good for you. I also subbed in the house vegetable for the day, a swiss chard with garlic. The portion was a little small of that for the $4, but it was very tasty. My friend got a burger with mushrooms and bacon and cheese on a pretzel roll and it was B+ above average for this combo, which I've seen elsewhere. His tots were the star though, arriving in a cool paper satchel spilling out onto his plate. I liked that they used barber shop design paper straws in my drink.  I'll be back. They kept their ""chick-fil-gay' sandwich made famous in the fundraising for gay marriage in Illinois as a protest to chick-fil-A and the menu offers a lot of room to try new things.

2014-09-12,4.0,"Great spot to grab an upscale burger in a relaxed setting. SB was bustling on a Thursday night. Given its location, SB caters to lots of families and same-sex couples, and consequently, you'll see lots of t-shirts on babies that say ""I heart my two daddies."" This place has my triad of needs: burgers, cocktails, and desserts. I'm usually a fan of anywhere that can do two of these three things well, but SB manages to do all of these expertly, and deliciously. With so many choices on the cocktail menu, it was tough to choose between the Peach Collins and the Well-Timed. Since I don't get to try a peach shrub-based drink very often, I went for that. Luckily my boo ordered the other drink I wanted (gin, blackberry syrup, lemon, thyme and soda) so I was able to taste that too. I'm generally a fan of shrubs (which use vinegar as an ingredient) as I love the tartness, but this drink bordered on a little too much. You will definitely taste the vinegar. The Well-Timed was a beautiful purple shade and tasted as good as it looked. We started with deviled eggs, which had a little heat from sriracha. These were good, if a little too chilled (as they obviously had been refrigerated for several hours). I opted for a fairly simple burger (there are a ton of options, including non-beef ones) with just cheddar, lettuce and tomato, and to that, onion rings on the side. Burgers are cooked either ""pink' or ""not pink,"" and I obviously chose pink. It's evident they use high-quality beef here. It was a delicious and satisfying burger. The onion rings were definitely homemade and also quite good. My boo got one of the specials, which was a meatloaf sandwich, and he devoured it, along with a side of tater tots. I didn't try the sandwich, but the tater tots were so good, I think I ate more than he did. Since one of the owners of SB is renowned pastry chef, Gale Gand, one would be remiss in not ordering dessert. Actually, one would be remiss in not ordering several desserts, especially with so many options--rice krispie treats with caramel and fudge dipping sauces, lemon meringue pie, butterscotch pudding, blueberry ginger hand pie... The perfect solution? Get the tasting trio. It's half sizes of any three desserts. We got the rice krispie treats, the pudding, and the lemon meringue pie. I think the pie was my favorite. The lemon part was slightly frozen, and the crust appeared to be shortbread. The meringue part was nicely bruleed. So good! The manager (who I knew in a former life) nicely comped us an after-dinner cordial of elderberry juice and prosecco. The service was great. The food, drinks, and dessert were delicious.

I guess this review can really only be about the chilaquiles since it's all I've eaten there. With that said, my first experience at SpritzBurger was OK, but the chilaquiles were a bit cold, though the flavor was good. But, when you're expecting a hot meal and it's served luke warm, you end up feeling disappointed. Putting my faith that it was just a one time thing (I have off days too), I went back, and ordered chilaquiles again with a side of their spicy potatoes and learned this is just how they are ... disappointing. First, they were NOT generous with the carnitas on the dish, maybe enough for two fork-fulls AND the carnitas were cold. After that, I was basically left with a sea of luke-warm tortilla chips swimming in salsa verde and two eggs over easy, which were the ONLY warm things on the plate. So alas, it's heaping serving of disappointment, not chilaquiles.  The side of spicy potatoes were equally disappointing; luke warm and soggy, not hot and crispy. And I'm no chef, but I do a pretty good job of achieving hot and crispy chopped potatoes in a skillet at home, so I'm not sure what's happening in the kitchen.

The service was excellent from the moment we walked into the restaurant, until the moment we left. Our waitress was very personable and offered great recommendations. We started with the Poutine which was OK, but nothing special. I've had better elsewhere. The burger was a special that isn't normally on the menu: The Collision Burger. This burger was oh so good. The burger consisted of: Short Rib, avocado,  chimichurri sauce and red onions on a Onion Focaccia bun (if memory serves me correctly). I found the burger to be juicy and extremely flavorful. With the burger you can either get fries or tater tots...of course I selected the tots! For dessert we shared the tasting trio which was a half size portion of 3 desserts of your choosing. We selected (1) Rice Krispie Treats which came with salted caramel dip & chocolate fudge dip, (2) Butterscotch Pudding with salt & pepper peanuts and (3) Blueberry Ginger Hand Pie with lemon glaze and Pistachio Ice Cream. I liked the Butterscotch Pudding the most. This is definitely a must try! I wasn't a big fan of the Blueberry Pie or the Pistachio Ice Cream that came with it. The pie was forgetful and the only thing about the ice cream that had any resemblance to Pistachio was the color.

2014-05-11,4.0,"This is the third time my boyfriend and I have been to Spritz; we continue to be big fans of the concept and food. This morning we tried their brunch for the first time.  When you walk in, the restaurant's ambience is a sophisticated quirky; a wink of subtle kitsch to make a classy space warm and inviting. The aesthetic reinforces the overall concept: fun and elevated classic American fare. The patio was more of the same: an cute, inviting space for a beautiful Spring Sunday.  The wait staff is responsive and friendly, knowledgable about the food and attentive. The menu for both brunch and dinner are appropriately focused yet with enough variety suitable for a larger group with varying palettes.  For brunch, we ordered the ricotta doughnuts as a starter. They were delicious: perfectly warm with just a hint of lemon. Consistently, we find that the pastry items on the menu--for both meals--are simply phenomenal. (For dinner, make sure not to miss dessert!) For the main course this time around, I chose the voodoo eggs, which is a take on eggs in a basket: griddled challah with over-easy egg in the center, served with stewed chipotle tomatoes on top. It was delicious, but very spicy: certainly not for the faint of tongue. I found it delightfully piquant, though I did wish for something to offset the spice.  My boyfriend's omelette du jour was feta and spinach, served with their house potatoes and an absolutely fabulous buttermilk biscuit with apricot butter. Again, as we have found previously, the baked goods shine.  All in all, we find that Spritz is a great neighborhood spot, good for both a burger on a Wednesday night and a lovely Sunday morning brunch.

We got there around 6pm and it was not busy just yet and several tables were open. However because they were all four tops and we were a table of 2, we either had to wait 45 minutes or eat at the teeny, tiny bar. So us fatties went to eat at the bar. This was terribly uncomfortable as the chairs were uncomfortable and there was no space for us to back up without screwing with the aisle. Then as it started to get busy people started crowding around the bar. This was frustrating. My suggestion to the restaurant is to have two tops you can make into a four top instead of a bunch of four tops that we two groups can't sit at.  The food was good though. We had the buffalo shrimp (which I could have eaten a pound of), the lamb burger, and the Amish B&B. My boyfriend loved his burger (the Amish) and I liked my lamb burger.

2014-04-21,2.0,"Someone once said that a best seller is a book that sells well because it sells well. SpritzBurger seems to get five star reviews because they get five star reviews.    A buddy and I (not S.) split two meals. One visit was enough to prove the food here to be overwhelmingly underwhelming- trendy, gimmicky and over priced.   Management/ownership and our waitress were very kind, warm and attentive.   The food? Their Buffalo Shrimp appetizer was tangy, tart, biting and quite enjoyable with good, cold beer.  The Poutine's gravy was so heavy with sage and salt as to be nearly inedible- all sage all the time.    The Spritzburger take on mac and cheese is to sprinkle fried Cheetos atop theirs. From a bag. Like from the filling station convenience store. What! No faux apple pie made from Ritz crackers on the dessert menu? Are we in a double-wide or a Chicago restaurant? Inquiring minds need to know. Please let me be clear, I have and will again eat a full bag of Cheetos or their cousin Cheezits in one sitting (to the consternation of S and glee of my tailor) They're a marvelous American food-like product. I question the wisdom of adding artificial preservatives, colours and even more salt to purportedly high quality ingredients in a restaurant setting. This idea and its resulting flavourfest is abhorrent. Adding them to your Kraft Macaroni and Cheese at home is probably a good idea.  They sloppily categorize meat temperature as Pink or Not Pink rather than offering all the usual variations on Rare, Medium and Well Done. Are their cooks incapable of such standard subtleties? Apparently so. Ordered Pink our burgers both came Brown, slimy, and cold. When a restaurant can not handle the dish that is in their name, their ostensible reason for being, they've lost me. They comped the Patty Melt when my dining companion complained. His chosen Pub Crawl burger was sweet with too much chutney thoroughly overwhelming the meat and cheddar flavours. The Truffle Fries were oily and floppy and also cold.  Please Google the recent Chicago Reader review for extremely well worded accuracy,   Need I say more?

It's name is Spritz and it is way closer to my apartment.  I went here Thursday night with a foodie friend from Phoenix. My friend ordered a soda and I tried two of the cocktails throughout the night. They were delicious, but I'm pretty sure there wasn't any alcohol in them. I don't know if I would pay the price for those drinks again. Having them spritzed table side along with the cute little straws is a fun experience, though.  The service here is also phenomenal. From the hostess to the servers to the staff that came around to refill our water glasses, everything was amazing. Our waiter noticed our table was wobbly and, without any prompting, came over with a wedge to put under one of the legs for us. Further, he was very passionate about the food and gave great recommendations.  For appetizers, we ordered the fried beets and goat cheese as well as the bar snacks. This is the first time I like beets, but my friend thought they weren't as flavorful as most she's had. Still, the combination with the goat cheese had us finishing every bite. The bar snacks, chili lime pepitas and fried chickpeas, were also delicious, albeit a little hard to eat. Every table started off with a little jar of house pickled vegetables too. This was a fun way to start the meal and I really enjoyed all of them. The vegetables were lightly pickled and were both crisp and flavorful.  The burgers, though, are what sent us to heaven. These were spectacular. I got the Amish burger with the blue cheese and everything about that burger was just...right. I was getting flavors I didn't expect to get and the meat was cooked perfectly (you get two options, pink in the middle or no pink). I got a side of tater tots and they were also great (but we were struggling with the sides because we had eaten so much before and those BURGERS-dayum, dayum, dayum!). My friend ordered the lamb burger and it was so good that she just couldn't share. She also made the VERY smart choice to upgrade her side of fries to be Parmesan with black pepper. Let me tell you, black pepper is truly an underrated seasoning because these fries are bomb.  We had no room for dessert, but got a couple of cookies to go. Those were amazing even the next day. I wish I lived on top of this place, it has everything. Also, it is comparatively cheap (3 drinks, 2 apps, 2 entrees, upgraded side--$60). The burgers are all bigger than at DMK and while more expensive, all come with the side of fries or tots you'd have to order separately at DMK. Otherwise, these are pretty different burger places. Do you like cocktails and desserts? Spritz. Do you like beer and milkshakes? DMK.  I am in burger heaven in this city.",0.999,0.751,0.218,0.031,0.5855974339669991

2014-04-03,4.0,"Upon returning back to my homestead after a night of ingesting copious amounts of libations, my significant other and I chose to embark on a consumption of Cheddar-flavored puffed corn spheres. Shortly thereafter, the lady so eloquently advocated: ""WHY DOESN'T ANYBODY PUT CHEETOS ON MAC-AND-CHEESE?!"" Tried to make it sound as classy as possible. Some of the best ideas happen when you're drunk, don't they? Luckily for us, one of the girl's friends had just eaten at SpritzBurger, where she raved about the Burgers (duh), the Spritz (double duh) and the Mac-N-Cheeto.... WHAT?! Instantaneously, both me and the GF's ears perked up like two dogs who had just heard the word ""squirrel."" Mac-N-Cheese is one of the GF's favorite food, and Cheetos are one of the GF's favorite (drunk) foods, so it was music to our ears to hear that such an entity existed! So yesterday, on our date night, we decided it was as good of time as any to try out SB.  We were seated right away by the window and within minutes, our server James came over to talk to us about drinks -- and everything else that we cared to talk about. The guy was just AWESOME, super friendly, and yes, actually talked to us in a normal person voice! I got a Gale's Root Beer to drink (I mean c'mon, it's a SCHOOL night!), which was delicious and unlike any Root Beer I've ever had -- definitely could taste the vanilla, but I also could taste a slight cinnamon flavor. Next came our food orders. She ordered the Pub Crawl Burger, I got a WTF Burger. Her side was onion rings, my side was truffle fries, and our combined side (don't judge) was .... DRUMROLL ... Mac-N-Cheeto! Start with the Burgers. You order them Pink or No Pink, but both ways, they are juicy and have a nice texture. Maybe not as much flavor as I would have liked from just the patty, but still good nonetheless. Both of the burgers with their respective trimmings were great, and don't worry -- the WTF burger isn't THAT hot (though don't expect it to be mild either -- you definitely need a little heat tolerance for it). The truffle fries and onion rings were good as well, but nothing extraordinary  that I've never had before. Then came the moment of truth. Would this conjured-up-drunken-conncotion of Macaroni noodles, cheese sauce and Cheetos be anywhere good as it seemed in our heads? No. It was better. People, you need to start putting Cheetos on top of your Mac-N-Cheese! It was awesome -- the crunchy, artificially cheese powder taste of the Cheeto paired exquisitely with the smooth, delicate Mac-N-Cheese. It was absolutely divine... once again, trying to class it up. Actually, who cares! From here on out, I'm putting Cheetos on all Cheese-based items. Philly Cheeto-steak? Yes. Ham and Cheeto Sandwich? Don't mind if I do! Cheeto Fondue?

While waiting for the rest of our group to arrive, we had drinks at the bar. The Tang mimosa was very playful, and I was impressed with the michelada on the menu.  The portions for brunch varies with each dish, so you should probably check with your server on what's more filling in case you're starving. Luckily, this didn't apply to me since we ordered a lot. The smallest were Ina's pancakes, which were absolutely amazing. I was sad I never got to check out Ina's original spot before she closed shop, so I'm glad there's a part of it going on here. Portions were small for this one, but the flavor is rich and texture's perfect, so I wouldn't really want more than the two they offer. The biggest order in our group was their Madron burger. Holy crap, that was very filling and filled with all of your favorite guilty pleasures. The atmosphere was really lively and I really liked the new decor they have. Service was perfect -- never got the name of our server but he was the perfect amount of attentive. That being said, overall I'm really into the new vibe Hearty Boys have carved out with Gale Gand, and it's a welcome addition to my list of go-to neighborhood restaurants. I'll definitely be returning to check out their dinner service and desserts! Lastly, I took home a jar of Gale's salted caramel sauce to pair with some gelato. I haven't tried it on ice cream quite yet, but a finger dip of it is sooo good. May it never cease being available at the restaurant.",0.9949,0.765,0.196,0.04,0.6274025974025973

Now on to the food.....! Ok...I really really REALLY dug these burgers!  I was prepared for it to be just another place that serves some meat with some fancy cheese to hike up the price...NOT SO!  These burgers are FANTASTIC.  I have no idea what makes them awesome, I just know it's not just fancy cheese. (I'm not a chef, just a burger eater) You can't have a burger without fries, and this place doesn't disappoint there either.  Make sure to take advantage of the house-made ketchup!",0.9052,0.83,0.122,0.048,0.5067019400352734

2014-03-05,3.0,"I'm baffled by the rave reviews, I though SpritzBurger was just ok.  The food was so-so, the cocktails and dessert are what were most memorable. For food, the fried beets with citrus goat cheese were nice, but the crispy chicken livers were fried within an inch of their life and quite mealy.  I opted for the poutine burger, because how could you not?!  Unfortunately, this was way to sweet to be enjoyable.  I'm not sure how cheese curds and sage gravy translate into sweet, but it just wasn't for me.  My friend had the Amish B&B and said it was good, but not the best he's had.  If you're on the fence about bleu cheese, this is not for you, he said it's pretty powerful stuff.  The onion rings were delicious and the fact that they offer tots made me happy. The real standouts were the desserts!  We got the trio of butterscotch pudding (yum!), the rice krispie treats on a stick (the salted caramel dip was amazing!) and the lemon meringue ""pie"" (it's actually lemon ice cream on a cookie and topped with meringue).   Cocktails were also enjoyable.  They ""spritz"" them table-side, which was fun and they come with a cheerful straw.  I enjoyed my Gin Blossom and the Pineapple Tom Collins.  Both were quite sweet, but reminded me summer must be coming eventually.  My friend enjoyed his New York Sour. Service was friendly but pretty slow as the place was slammed.  Halfway through our meal we heard they had run out of the beets as well as buns (!).  I think they need some time to get a groove but overall it's fine.",0.9977,0.715,0.255,0.03,0.6588919498010406

2014-02-26,3.0,"I have been watching and waiting for Spritzburger to open. I am a huge fan of the Hearty Boys and an even bigger fan of Gale Gand - so this was a win win in my eyes before they even opened. We went opening night. I have to say the service was a litter spotty, but it was opening night and not sure the waitstaff had the menu items down pat or were ready to make suggestions... so I wont hold it against them the food was awesome. the fried beets were very good and the burgers, well what can you say, they were perfection. Loved the bun to meat ratio, all the toppings, house made sauces. would definitely go back again and again for the burgers- there are NO good burger places in the neighborhood that have this type of ambiance and quality. the desserts were another story. I LOVE Gale, Truly do. Been a fan of hers since TRIO, Brassiere T, TRU and have a bunch of her cookbooks, but honestly the desserts do her no justice. If I didn't know she was behind them I would have never guessed they were made/ developed by someone of her caliber. We had 3 desserts (told you I was a fan) and everyone was mehhh. The black and white cookie felt way too heavy and big for the little rootbeer float. the chocolate ""ho ho"" type dessert tasted like a cakey cookie and too dry. It was really sad to be so underwhelmed by a chef whose always been the bright spot of a dinning experience. I hope this was just an ""opening night jitters"" type of thing and not what we can expect going forward... C'mon Gail, I know you haven't cooked in a restaurant in awhile but don't lose your edge when it comes to being a culinary wizard with dessert!!!!",0.997,0.735,0.227,0.038,0.5381196581196581

2014-02-17,4.0,"Yay, Spritz Burger is awesome!  I went with my husband on their 2nd night open, and we tried a ton of stuff on the menu.  We started with their house made pickles, which were pretty tasty.  Then we tried the fried beets appetizer, and it was really delicious.  I am big fan of beets, but my husband isn't, but we both loved it.  The beet taste wasn't overpowering, but it was still present enough to satisfy me.  The goat cheese dip was especially tasty.  Considering the name of the place, we had to try some Fizzy cocktails.  Our waiter, James, offered to pick for us (I love doing this btw).  He brought us the New York Sour and the Gin Blossom.   I liked both drinks, but especially the New York Sour, which was really tasty.  A little sweet, a little sour.  Yum.   For the mains, I ordered the Patty Melt on rye for my main burger, and my husband had the Pub Crawl.  I've never had a patty melt ever, and I just loved this burger!  It was so yummy.  The caramelized balsamic onions were amazing.    My husband ate half of my sandwich because I was stuffed and wanted room for dessert.  He also ate his entire sandwich and loved it.  He said he would definitely order it again.  I had the skinny fries, and he had the tots with truffle oil.  I thought the truffle oil was a little overwhelming but the tots themselves were great.  My fries were just okay - a little underdone, not crispy and not ""skinny"".  I think when I read skinny on the menu I thought shoestring, or close to shoestring, but these were like regular cut fries.   Finally we got to dessert, which I was really the most excited about.  We had a flight of butterscotch pudding, a root beer float and lemon meringue.  The lemon part of the meringue was good, but I didn't care for the cookie or the meringue.  The root beer float was amazing and the butterscotch pudding was so good, I completely finished it without assistance.  I am really looking forward to going back again soon and trying more desserts. The service was really good, and everything we tried we really enjoyed.  I am so glad that Hearty was able to quickly transform their place into the new Spritz Burger.  The vibe is similar to the old place, but lighter and more whimsical.  It's modern and airy, but still kind of cozy.   The prices are definitely more affordable - even with an appetizer, two cocktails, two entrees and a dessert flight we were under $80 including tip.   We already have plans with friends to return in the next two weeks.  The menu has so many interesting things on it and I can't wait to try them all!",0.9989,0.772,0.217,0.011,0.5300088800088799
2014-02-15,5.0,"I LOVE SPRITZ BURGER! I came in with my sister for opening night. I was immediately greeted by the hostess who took my coat for me and sat us at a cozy table along the back wall. First off, this place is BEAUTIFUL. I couldn't help but notice how gorgeous the bar is. My server came over and told us a bit about what Spritz Burger had to offer, and explained that all of the burgers they have are 100% grass fed beef.  I decided on the Gin Blossom (which was my favorite!) and my sister had the Old Tom Pineapple collins. The Gin Blossom was refreshing and light. What is cool about Spritz Burger is that all of the drinks are spritzed table side! Both of those drinks we had were VERY tasty and pretty. Oh and the homemade pickles! They remind of the pickles my grandpa used to make when I was a kid, and I haven't tasted any nearly as close to his as these. Way to go Spritz Burger! We decided to get a bunch of food and split it. For appetizers, we got the Poutine and Fried Beets with orange goat cheese dip. Both were AMAZING! I highly recommend the Fried Beets. We almost asked for more goat cheese dip because it was SO SO good. I caught my sister lick the dip off her finger! The burgers. Boy oh boy. I got the Pub Crawl which had cheddar, major grey chutney, roasted tomato, and mustard.. SO good. She had the WTF burger which had pepper jack, jalapeno jam, chipotle lime aioli (YUM), tortilla strips, and came on focaccia. If you like spicy, definitely try the WTF. I don't usually like sweet with meat, but the Pub Crawl was delicious and I have been dreaming about it since. I can't wait to try the other burgers they have! After dinner, we decided to try the Salted Caramel Egg Cream drink. YUM! The vanilla salt was such a nice touch to this drink. It was unlike anything I've ever had. Onto Gale Gand's desserts. If you are ever in Chicago, you should be ashamed to leave before trying one of her desserts. They are INCREDIBLE. We tried the dessert trio which had Lemon Meringue with ""blackberry paint"", Rice Krispies, and Butterscotch Pudding. I couldn't tell you which was my favorite because they were all so delicious. Even if you are full after dinner, I strongly suggest getting a dessert even if you plan to just take it home with you.  I only have positive things to say about Spritz Burger. The coolest part about it was that the owner and chef Dan, as well as Gale came out and said hello to every table in the dining room. I am SO happy this collaboration happened, and I won't be satisfied until I try everything on the menu.",0.9972,0.783,0.169,0.048,0.6814646464646464
2014-02-15,5.0,"Fantastic! We went here for dinner tonight with high hopes, and I am happy to say it exceeded my expectations. Burgers here are a bit pricier than usual, but when the quality of ingredients is that great with flavor combinations I can't get elsewhere, I don't mind shelling out a couple extra dollars.  The decor and cocktails are whimsical and sweet while still maintaining a level of sophistication which I enjoyed. I have lived around the corner for two years but never went into Hearty Boys for no particular reason other than it never drew me in. After walking by only once, I knew I wanted to go into Spritz. It's comfortable and approachable while offering a much-needed option for a quality meal out on the block (Subway and IHOP need not apply).  I enjoyed the WTF (Wow, that's fiery) burger with house cut fries. The burger was epic, and I would order it again in a heartbeat. The fries were a bit limp, though, so I'll probably opt for tots next time. My boyfriend got the Amish B&B burger, and he thoroughly enjoyed it. They offer house-made pickled vegetables to munch on while you wait in an adorable little mason jar, and they serve the burgers with house-made ketchup which was delicious. Between that and the red striped straws in the cocktails, you can see that these owners really get that the little things can make or break an experience. I wish this place the best of luck, though I don't think they'll need it. I know I'll definitely be back!",0.9938,0.741,0.207,0.052,0.5606547619047618
