2015-11-03,3.0,This place honesty has the best bar trivia in the area. It's not easy but it's not impossible. I think it also helps that the crowd is primarily post college grads but not older than 30 so we the competition is right up my alley.  Now they have some good food deals but their drink deals are deceiving. They take normal Chicago prices and put deal in front of it so you think it's a deal yet you're still paying 4 dollars for a corona just because it's taco Tuesday.  I also have had really bad service where we got yelled at by the server because we went to the bar for our drink after being seated for 10+ minutes without anyone acknowledging us. I do think that was a one off situation and I don't expect that when I go back but regardless I have a bit of a sour taste in my mouth and it's not from my coronas lime.  But if it's Tuesday and you need a reason to get out of the house Justin's trivia is the place to do it.,-0.1637,0.89,0.056,0.054,0.5017316017316018

Our food finally came out several minutes later, followed quickly by Tim, the assistant chef, who explained that there had been some sort of mixup with our ticket and the food should have been ready a long time ago.  We weren't too upset, but Tim apologized profusely and bought us a pitcher of beer.  We were already completely impressed at how he went above and beyond to make things right for us, but then Nick, the chef, ALSO came out to apologize and did a round of Fireball shots with us. We've eaten in enough places to know that there can be snafus in the kitchen anywhere you go, so what sets a place apart is how they react to them.  The way the staff at Justin's went all-out to make up for a mistake that didn't even really bother us that much has ensured that we will be back over and over again!",0.9739,0.889,0.1,0.011,0.3784556878306877
2014-05-10,2.0,"I have been in and out of Justin's since 2009 and have always enjoyed the experience and the food, but today was a disappointment. Menu changes can be a shock, and I took it in stride with my girlfriend, but if I had not had a steak dinner the night prior, I would have been very bummed to see the steak wrap missing- or any of them, like the blackened chicken. It was such a beautiful day today that I was open to trying a new food option- it was perfect out in the beer garden, and it was NOT BUSY at 11:40am; maybe a 2-3 tables had people before we walked out there. I ordered the cajun-rubbed chicken sandwich and my girlfriend had the chicken caprese sandwich.  Although the INITIAL service was prompt, with drinks, we waited more than 40-45 minutes for our meal. We had VERY promptly placed our orders as we had always enjoyed meals here and were excited to get out an about along Southport.  Yet we were 5 minutes away from flagging someone down and leaving. I have no clue what changed- are there fewer cooks? Are they slow? Was it their first day on the job? We did not show up for lunch at 1:45 while the place was exploding over capacity; it was 11:40am. The food wait was unacceptable. My meal, the cajun chicken, was actually pretty decent. It was quality and tasty. My girlfriend thought her caprese had poor tomato quality and bland mozzarella and meat; flat. Yet overall, neither was worth the 40+ minute wait: on a slower morning. We will not go back again for food for a long time. Our experience today, Saturday the 10th, drove us to seek if any had similar issues here on Yelp. Not only were we disheartened tonight to see it is so, owners need to stop making excuses, as if it's staffing issues, or fixating on the past-positive reviews; let alone responding with borderline-snark.

We weren't sure exactly how sure many would be in our party so we wanted somewhere that we could easily add tables.   I walk in the door with my 2 kids and the manager rudely states , ""You can't stay.  It's a new policy.  No kids on the patio for lunch.""  I thought he was kidding.  I said I was recently here with my kids on the patio.  Again , he curtly says, ""Sorry - you can't stay.  New policy.""  I couldn't believe it.  I told him some of my friends are already on the patio so I have to get them so we can leave.  I go out there to explain and none of my friends could believe it either.  They thought I was joking.  They had already ordered drinks and appetizers so they were discussing paying so we could all go somewhere else.  As I'm talking to my friends, I look over my shoulder and the manager is standing about a foot away from me watching that I leave.  I looked at him and said, ""Don't worry...I'm leaving.  You don't have to stand there and watch me.""  Here's the scary part.  He tells me that THE OWNER HAS A VIDEO MONITORING SYSTEM AND HE JUST CALLED TO SAY HE COULD SEE KIDS ON THE PATIO AND WE HAD TO LEAVE ASAP. I asked if the owner was on site and he said no.  So you're telling me he's watching the patio from home?? He says yes.  WHAT???  The manager could not have been any less customer-focused in his handling of the situation.  He is clearly is in the wrong job. We picked up and took our business down the street to another restaurant that could not have been more accommodating.  We ended up having 20 people and I'm so glad Justin's didn't get our money. I've never been treated like that and in a neighborhood filled with tons of options and families everywhere you look - take your business somewhere that will appreciate it even if you don't have kids.",0.9139,0.801,0.107,0.092,0.5656126482213439

2013-05-02,1.0,"Headed to Justin's this week to take advantage of the gorgeous weather and the communal discount for working on Southport.  Spoiler alert: Justins doesn't honor the Southport discount that virtually every other independently owned business on the street does, but that isn't the only problem. As someone who works in the service industry, I tend to be pretty understanding.  If a place is packed and the staff looks busy I can understand iffy service.  Justins was definitely busy while we were there--the whole beer garden was full so we opted for a table near the front door.  While other tables near the bar seemed to have a server, the bartender was serving us.  After a lengthy wait, he greeted us at our table and quickly returned with a round of drinks, although he forgot one.  We were planning to order food, but it didn't look like he had plans of returning anytime soon, so we approached him at the bar to put a food order in and grab another round of drinks.  Still, not a huge problem.  Fast forward to 45 minutes later and we still haven't received our appetizer.   At that point, a table in the beer garden had opened up so we moved outside to snag it.  And I will say the beer garden is AWESOME.  Plenty of seating, a great vibe, and the full bar with TVs out there made it really enjoyable with the great weather this week.  Unfortunately, our enjoyment ended there.  Our waitress approached us promptly and we explained we had a table inside but were willing to close out with the bartender or have our tab transferred outside, whichever was easier.  She asked what the name for the tab was and we told her we hadn't been asked to start a tab.  After a bit of huffing and puffing, she asked one of us to come inside to talk to the bartender.  He was willing to transfer the tab, but our food didn't arrive for another 45 minutes.  We ordered entrees as well as another round and received them quickly. While eating, I witnessed our server have several temper tantrums both toward the other server and people who were crowding the server station at the bar.  When we were ready for the bill, we mentioned that we worked on Southport.  When she said she didn't know anything about a discount, we asked if she could ask someone.  She approached a larger man at the outdoor bar who just shook his head and said ""No, absolutely not.""  At this point we had spent about 4 hours and $100 at the bar--not exactly how I would treat others in the industry.   Bottom line: We won't be back.  After telling friends about our bad experience, I learned (too late) that this is typical for Justins.  Poor service and poor attitudes?

They are now renting out the upstairs for parties, and it's spectacular.  There are two separate party rooms, the main room with the bar and the other with a pool table and extra tables and chairs.  Both rooms have HD TVs.  They also have a closet for coats, private bathrooms, AND a iPod connect for people to play their own playlists for their party.   Seriously, we could not have picked a more perfect venue for our surprise party.  Both Todd and George, the managers, were incredibly helpful and accommodating in planning.  We were allowed to pick out 5 beers to put on tap, as well as allowed to decorate and bring in our own cake/candles.  We were also allowed to control the various TVs--perfect for the March Madness tournament.  Best part - The total cost of renting out the entire top floor from 7-12PM was $75 for the bartender, $50 for security at the door.  THAT'S IT. The only tiny downside to the upstairs is its a cash bar only, as opposed to downstairs that allows credit cards.  This, however, was not even a big deal in comparison to all the benefits the place had to offer, especially since there is an ATM inside the bar.

2013-02-11,1.0,"Reserved the upstairs room for a joint birthday party with Karl at Justins Bar for Saturday 2/9/13.  The deal was $40 for 9-12 premium open bar.  There was an $800 guaranteed minimum (20 wristbands) we were responsible for covering.  We put down a $200 deposit to reserve the room as well This minimum is often customary for these drink deals, so I saw no problem with that.   Fast forward to day of party when we were made aware that NO GUESTS would be allowed upstairs without paying the $40 drink deal.  What that meant is any guest who wanted to stop by for a drink who be forced to pay $40 to hang out upstairs in our reserved room.  I explained to Karl that this was not made clear to us and I had never heard such a rule at any prior drink deal I had ever done.  I reiterated that we were perfectly content paying the $800 minimum, so it was very clear that money was apparently not the issue. I let Karl know that we had a pregnant friend as well as a friend who abstains from drinking, and that it isnt fair to them that they be charged $40 to celebrate with us.  He would not budge. This conversation spanned over 3 phone calls and nearly 30 minutes.  The only level of ""compromise"" the bar planned to offer was a discounted deal I could offer to people at 11:00.  There was no mention of any of this in the contract we signed and the fact that Karl stated he told us of this when booking the party is ludicrous.  I cant imagine anyone agreeing to a party where your friends/family have no choice but to buy into a $40 drink deal.   I would never in a million years have agreed to that.  These drink packages are often provided as a bonus to guests, not a punishment. We ended up cancelling the party 3 hours before our guests were set to arrive.  This hard nosed manager was so hellbent on sticking to his guns, that he passed up a GUARANTEED $800 bar tab and at least another few hundred dollars in cash bar sales.  I could not believe and still cannot believe it came to that. The party shifted to Tin Lizzie, where they not only accomodated what turned out to be close to 40 guests, but offered a discounted drink package from 9-12 at no cost.  The manager Matt was awesome.  I will certainly do all in my power to promote more business there way. After all is said and done, I still remain upset about what happened.  Needless to say I would never offer my business to this place again.  I look forward to Justin himself lending his two cents on this situation.  I cant imagine as the owner of this bar, he would be happy to hear of this situation.",0.9795,0.822,0.112,0.066,0.5613460317460317

There might have been 2 or 3 other people in the entire place, which is probably normal, seeing as it was about 4 PM on a Sunday. It filled up as the evening went on. First of all, I need to comment on how subtle and funny the menu is....  ""Real, authentic Mexican food from authentic Mexicans. So authentic you might want to think twice before you drink the water.""  And while you're at it, check out the description for the ""House Salad."" I got a kick out of both of those.  I ordered the fajitas and my counterpart ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. Fajitas were fantastic, especially considering the fact that I assumed that this is a run-of-the-mill bar in the Lakeview area. I was unbelievably impressed with my food! The Philly Cheesesteak was made like real Philly's are supposed to be made...cheesy sauce throughout the meat, rather than melted on top. I've had one other Philly Cheesesteak that was as good as this one, and it was made by the chef at Sullivan's Steakhouse in Naperville. (He was from Philly, so I trust him on the traditional making of PCS.) Get the sweet potato fries. And DO NOT order the PCS for take-out...it gets soggy, as one would expect. Quality of the sandwich was a little lower as well, but that could be because that's the nature of take-out anyway. I will say, however, that I was extremely shocked/disappointed with the way that ""Justin S."" has responded to past Yelp reviews. Any owner or manager or employee with the audacity to hide behind the internet and respond to poor reviews (some of them really weren't even that bad...) the way that he did puts a terrible taste in my mouth. The reason I Yelp, as I'm sure many other reviewers do, is to provide feedback about a restaurant first for the consumer's purposes (what to order, what to look out for) and also for the owner's purposes. We are trying to give feedback on what consumers want and have experienced...take that opportunity and use what past reviewers have said to IMPROVE your service, rather than take the opportunity to lose customers.

As many other reviewers have mentioned, the outdoor beer garden is a fantastic place to spend a summer afternoon or evening.  During my original visit the food was good; bar food, but above average nonetheless. Unfortunately, the service my group received was terrible. Our waitress was more concerned about watching the Cubs game on Justin's TVs with her friends (who appeared to be visiting her at work) and fellow bartenders. We ordered a pitcher of beer in the middle of our meal, and didn't receive it until we were all through with eating. When my friend made a remark to the server that we went through the second half of our meal without drinks, the waitress made a snide remark under her breath, walked away, and rejoined her friends at the bar. My second visit; however, was the real gem. Hosting a friend from out of town, we were looking to grab a quick bite to eat on a Sunday night, and decided to stay in the neighborhood. We walked in, where a bouncer asked for our IDs and told us to sit wherever we liked. My friend and I sat at a high-top table, and waited for ten minutes without being greeted by a server. Here's the kicker: we were the only table in the entire bar. The server sat at the bar, wrapping silverware and talking to the bartender, refusing to acknowledge our presence. The bouncer noticed, stopped by our table, apologized for our service and told us he would have a server over right away.  After continuing to wait five more minutes, my friend and I decided to instead sit at the bar. We each ordered a drink, and subsequently asked THREE times for menus before the bartender finally brought them over. Eventually we ordered, myself a grilled cheese and my friend a salad. Easy enough. While my friend's salad looked good, my grilled cheese was completely burnt on one side. From the service we had already received, I did not ask for a new sandwich as I'm sure the bartender would have continued to act as though we were just another inconvenience.

2012-03-25,4.0,"For a sports bar, Justin's constantly surprises me. I always expect the food to land somewhere between mediocre to passable, but everything I've ordered ends up being better that what I thought.  I was first exposed to Justin's while home for the summer from college, so it was one of the first places I went near Wrigley as a 21-year-old. Nearly five years later I moved nearby and made it a point to go there for 25 cent wings on Thursdays (before they canceled the deal) especially when the beer garden is open (though fair warning, they allow smoking back there ... or halleiluyah I suppose  if that's you...). Justin's flat-out makes the best wings I've had in the Wrigleyville area. Plenty of meat on the bones, plus they're not shy on sauce, which has a perfect medium/hot kick. They offer at least one quality beer on special every month, so you're not forced to drink the domestic lagers if you're drinking more than one or two. On the menu I've had and enjoyed the grilled cheese, the philly (looks gross but it's delicious) and a buddy got their $1 tacos (a daily special) one time, which I figured would be crap ($1 tacos?) but looked (and apparently tasted) good.  The atmosphere inside is more of a dive. It's a good place as any to watch a game as there's plenty of seating, but it's not as classy of a hangout as other bars in the area. The crowd gets Clark-street thick on weekend nights so this isn't an escape from that scene. Most servers I had were friendly, and even one time when I took my dad there after a Cubs game and he left his sweatshirt, they gladly held it for him the entire weekend. I was honestly expecting it to disappear. So maybe I have really low expectations of Justin's, or maybe it's just that decent of a place. I wouldn't make a habit of hanging out there all the time, but when I want low-key bar food or to get my wing on, it hits the spot.",0.9885,0.794,0.147,0.059,0.49847729789590256

The chicken quesadilla was above average with alot of cheese and chicken stuffed inside.  Toasted nicely and the servings of guacamole, sour cream, and salsa were good although they could have been a little larger (we ran out of guac and sour cream before the end).  The buffalo shrimp were very good.  They were not too heavily breaded which is always a problem when frying small things like shrimp.  The sauce was good and the shrimp had just the right amount of sauce on them.  Free side of ranch was nice too as was the portion size.  I neglected to mention that Wednesday is also half price appetizers so, minus the beers (because we probably drank more than the average person), the appetizers came out to be probably around $8 together.

The inside smells like stale beer and is dark and dank, but walk just a little further and you will be rewarded handsomely with a luscious outdoor patio lined with plastic furniture and a full bar waiting to quench your thirst.  Ended up there on a Friday night with a few friends from out of town and the patio wasn't crowded at all. It took us awhile to get a table, but we stood patiently with beer in hand under the light of the randomly placed lamp posts.  The waitresses were attentive and as soon as I finished a drink, another one magically appeared to replace it. That could be due to my generous friends, but I'll give the waitress some credit too.  Beware of a post-game Cubs crowd. If you're not as sloppy as they are, you might find their behavior a little annoying - i.e. the drunk girl at the table next to us who kept asking what we thought of the pin-ups in the firemen's calendar she randomly had on hand.

Reports state the following: that it was relatively uncrowded on a Friday night, that they have diverse sports on multiple TVs even late into the evening, and they have decent beer prices ($4.75 for a Guinness) - including bucket specials.  And the atmosphere has been described by witnesses as ""laid back."" This network sent an undercover reporter (we can't divulge his identity) into this northside bar to verify and he discovered that this place makes a ""mean"" veggie burger, ""gourmet style.""  The smells, he said, drove some other people around him to comment that they would even like to try the meatless entree.  However, our intrepid correspondant was sadly disappointed with the tater tots. He was also taken aback with the wait times at the bar to purchase drinks.  However, the bartender steered him away from purchasing a potentially rancid combination of a fake black and tan, and he seemed appreciative about that.

We got there relatively early (before 9) so the room of tables on the far side of the bar was empty and perfect for us.  Immediately, a woman came over to take our drink orders and left a pitcher of water for us too. She was very nice, checking back on us regularly to make sure that we were ok.

2009-06-25,2.0,"Here's the deal, I wanted to like this place - I really did.  We met 2 couples for dinner there tonight, and i wanted to write this while everything was fresh in my mind. They have a HUGE outdoor area, which is great for warm summer nights.  We were late, but shortly after walking in we ordered 2 diet cokes and a few minutes later, dinner. The food was pretty decent.  My steak sandwich was flavorful and the tater tots that came with it was good.  The 'horseradish' sauce was mostly sauce - I didn't taste any horseradish at all.  So be it.  The sandwich was better than expected.  The waitress never checked to see if everything was okay and we had to ask her for silverware.  Busboy's delivered our food and cleared our table.  The waitress offered to bring us refills on our beverages (2 iced teas, 3 diet cokes, 1 water) but otherwise, was cold, disinterested, and oftentimes absent.  We never got thanked either.  Not once. Then we got the bill.  Before I discuss why this place sucks, let me set the stage.  The outdoor seating area was mostly people sitting at tables, with a few people standing by the bar.  It wasn't busy by any stretch, but it was reasonably busy.  We were there about an hour and a half enjoying dinner, then decided to leave so we asked for our check.  Our waitress dropped it off, then disappeared for the next 10 minutes.   It turns out, they charge for soda and iced tea refills.  Not a buck, but a fresh $2 charge for every soda you get.  This wasn't listed on the menu, the waitress didn't mention it, and it wasn't expected.  I haven't eaten at a restaurant that did this.  Ever.  In my 10 years in the restaurant business, this never happened, ever.  Amongst restaurant and bar people, this practice is unheard of.  Why?  Because restaurant people know that each glass of soda costs the restaurant less than a dime.   So we complained to the waitress, who snapped up our check, said ""Fine!"" and returned 10 minutes later with a check that had the proper charges. So needing some change, I headed into the bar.  I asked the bartender if their policy was to charge for soda refills, and he said ""If you have been just sitting there drinking pop for a few hours, we'll charge you a buck or so for each refill, but not all the time - only when we're busy and someone is just drinking pop.""  I responded with a ""Great idea, rape the customers who don't get hammered while eating dinner.  That's sure to drive dinner business."" Charging customers $2 for a diet pepsi, then $2 a refill sort of makes sense if your place is packed (they weren't) and the person is taking up room and not spending any money.  But we were having dinner and my fiance and I had 2 diet cokes each.  40 cents in costs for $4 in revenue is a pretty solid margin for the restaurant, do you REALLY need to cheap out and hit me for another $4?  Really? This classic rookie error is a business killer, and we won't be back.  Their prices aren't good enough, their food isn't good enough, and their staff isn't good enough to justify frequenting a place that wants to send the wrong message to their customers - ""drink alcohol or f*ck off"" isn't the right message to be sending.when you serve food.  Period. Rude staff, stupid, classless, greedy policies, and mediocre, mostly absent service can't be overlooked for average bar fare and outdoor seating. My business is going down the street.  I hope they enjoyed the money they got from me, because they won't get anymore.  I wish they were better, but ripping off customers means losing them.  If you don't care about being treated well, don't mind lazy staff, and don't care much about having any sort of positive experience, this is a great place.  If you want to be treated well, enjoy a local restaurant experience, and have a nice time, consider other options.",0.9889,0.785,0.134,0.081,0.4746465692117866

I had been racking my brain for weeks trying to think of a bar that could handle a big group of people for Last Friday 07 - a place that was spacious, easy to get a drink, and low maintenance (somewhat divey) for my diverse group of buds. Justin's was the perfect choice - arrived with a small group around 9p and had the entire back room and our own server. Pitchers of Bass for $10 hit the spot and sampled tried their nacho and quesadilla apps. Nachos were unique in that you get about 12 or so individual chips with toppings so you don't have to dig around a big mess. Each new person that showed up was pleasantly surprised that we were on Southport yet had found an extremely spacious place to hang that was comfortable, a great jukebox (my buds kept control of it all night with Floyd, James, Radiohead, etc), older crowd, good service and a nice menu. If you need an oasis from the more clubby/loungey/youngster bars on Southport, this is my recommendation.",0.9732,0.841,0.137,0.022,0.5561818181818182

Food- Good bar food at nice prices.  The steak sandwich is a highlight.  At $7.50 you get a solid skirt steak grilled to order with fries or, my preference, tator tots and coleslaw.  The meat is tender, and seasoned with a little Chinese 5spice and comes with a creamy horseradish spread. Justin's is not trendy, which might disappoint some Southport fans, but this is a bar showing Chicago's true colors reminiscent of a day when we were more ""real"".",0.9595,0.833,0.15,0.017,0.4969211822660099
