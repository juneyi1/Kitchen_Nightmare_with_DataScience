Our waitress would visit our table every 20 minutes. After being seated, it took 20 minutes to receive our drinks. It then took an additional 20 minutes to come back after dropping off drinks to have her take our order. After taking our order, it took well over 45 minutes to receive a very simple dish (The Classic). I understand restaurants get busy, but rather than communicate with us and acknowledge that there was a severe delay due to lack of staff, she clearly avoided our table. The food was fine. It was very basic and portion size was very small. I wouldn't personally come here again after this experience.",-0.7406,0.843,0.061,0.096,0.3779166666666666

2016-02-21,5.0,"Came in for dinner this past Saturday evening and our expectations were not only met- but pleasantly exceeded. The steak was beyond memorable, I'm talking melt in your mouth, makes you crave it for days after good. Drinks were also on point, and consistent- nothing compliments an amazing steak like a top notch Martini. Combine that with a cozy and inviting interior- romantic if you will. It made me and the boo feel like we weren't just watching Mad Men on Netflix, but instead doing it up ourselves- Don Draper style. Alas I can't afford to dine like this every night- but the entire experience, drinks and all was still affordable enough that it makes for the perfect weekend retreat. My only fear now is that this place will blow up and it'll be impossible to get a table in 6 months. I'll definitely be back. Cheers.",0.9847,0.68,0.244,0.076,0.7134259259259259
2016-02-21,2.0,"My experience was pretty mixed, but the restaurant followed up with me right away after this review which I truly appreciated, and I definitely plan to give it another try.  Turns out it was all around a bad night and my visit may have just been a fluke during a series of unfortunate events. So here it is:  The drinks and sides were good, but the entrees and service were spotty. I made a reservation for my boyfriend's birthday and ordered birthday dessert in advance when I confirmed my reservation. After receiving a phone call, and text, and email to confirm my reservation, I felt like this was going to be an amazing  experience. When we arrived, we were happy  with the ambiance; however, it wasn't crowded yet at all and we definitely could have skipped the reservation with all the follow up messages.  I ordered the Amish chicken, and my boyfriend ordered the ribs. My chicken was pretty dry, even the dark meat. The ribs were fine but the sauce wasn't great. The fries and sweet potatoes that we ordered were everything, as were the drinks. The hot toddy was served in a proper tea cup on a saucer.  The service was not amazing. Once we were seated we waited about 5 minutes for water and about 10 before our server greeted us. She did check on us during the meal, which was nice. When we were done with done with our meal, the waitress offered us dessert menus, after mentioning that they were out of ice cream, so clearly no one told her that it was my boyfriend's birthday. They only had 4 dessert options 2 of which  kinda required ice cream and  it was only 8:00.... At that point, My only option was to ruin the surprise for my boyfriend with wack dessert options , and we just decided to get dessert elsewhere. I wonder why they tried to confirm our reservation so many times if the details didn't really matter to them... The prices weren't bad if the food had been good. I spent $100 before tip for two entrees, two sides, and a drink for each of us.

2016-02-11,4.0,"Recently visited this establishment for dinner in my old neighborhood. Heard great things about it so we had to give it a try. Made reservations online with no problem. It was a Friday night, so the parking around there was limited but not bad. We were seated as soon as we confirmed our reservation. FYI.... if you want a more intimate setting for 2-4 people, ask for the high tables towards the back, or the booths in the front. They seemed more far apart than the seating across from the bar. The place itself is very modern, yet intimate. Love the décor lighting.  To start off, we ordered an appetizer, I believe we ordered calamari. Very good! Their selection of craft beers was very good. Our server knew her beers, and suggested the right one just by telling her what I was in the mood for. My wife had her dirty martini. She said it was right on point. For our main entrees, she ordered the skirt steak and I went with the Hanger steak. For sides we went with the lobster mac & cheese and the glazed sweet potatoes. I have to say, both our steaks were cooked to perfection, the way we ordered them. If you're a steak lover, this one is a must have! The sides were delicious as well. We went light on dessert and had a rare cognac! All in all, we will definitely go back and try different things on the menu.

Not to mention we had a late reservation and we saw they were closing. They were very accommodating and never rushed us.

My partner and I arrived for on Saturday a little before our reservation time and were seated promptly. Since it was restaurant week, they were offering a fixed menu which we were both very excited to try. The starter was a grass-fed steak tartare with garlic toast. The bread and beef had great flavor and was just the right size. For the first course, you had the choice between an orange and fennel salad, or fried calamari. We both got the fried calamari which had a spicy orange chili glaze, accompanied by red peppers and green onions. IT WAS INCREDIBLE. Just the right amount of spice made this a delectable dish. For the second or main course, we both enjoyed an 8 oz steak Bavette which we decided to pair with sweet potatoes. The steak was cooked and seasoned perfectly, while the potatoes were sweet and spicy with just enough firmness.  For dessert we each had the toffee pudding. Though it was just the right size to end the meal, neither of us could finish because we were so full.  I should also mention that he had a wine pairing with each course, while I had the penicillin..amazing. I would love to go back and try pretty much everything, since this experience was so great.

Not a huge fan of raw meat so I can't give an honest opinion of the steak tartare. Can with a runny egg on top and although I couldn't eat it, husband said it was good. The fennel & orange salad was pretty boring- not much to it besides the greens and some orange slices. Salmon was great. Very simple, raw on the inside so if you don't like your salmon like hat make sure you tell them! Husband had the Bavette steak which was outstanding.

2016-01-29,4.0,"Dined at Unite for this first time the other day. A friend and I decided split most of the Restaurant Week menu and we really enjoyed it.  Individual steak tartare--didn't love the yolk to meat ratio but overall good. Nice portion of crusty bread. And love the bonus course for $33 Fried calamari with orange chili glaze--realllllly good! loved the spice and the fact that it wasn't overly fried or greasy. Would definitely order as an appetizer again.  Fennel and orange salad--my friend really liked the light flavor.  Bavette steak--no sides, just the meat, but a very decent portion. Not blow-your-mind in terms of flavor, but a great deal with the RW menu.  Veggie burger--a random choice as neither of us is veg, but it was VERY good. the patty was great and not boring like most veg burgers tend to be, the aioli was fantastic (and actually made the steak more interesting too....) Sticky toffee pudding--so moist and delicious. I'm not even a big desserts person but this was a good one. For those who might not be familiar...this is not an actual pudding, it's a piece of sponge cake. This is a British dessert, where they refer to all dessert as ""pudding."" (I only say all of this because I saw another reviewer mention the lack of actually pudding.) Chocolate chip cookie-big cookie, nice and soft, even spread of chocolate. Still warm! Owner came by to chat with us; that was a nice touch. It was half price bottle of wine night, which was a great deal, BUT my friend arrived early and they did not inform her of this so she ordered a glass of wine while waiting for me. Kind of a bummer that we had to do bottle + glass. ALSO they have a takeaway license (which I didn't even realize was a thing) so if you don't finish your bottle, they put it in a sealed bag and you can take it home. Unfortunately, my bag was not sealed completely and some of the wine spilled out in my purse. Luckily, most of the contents survived, but the lining of my purse was soaked :( Just a heads up to be more careful than I was, I guess, just in case your bag ends up not sealed all the way either.

It started off with the bar, and Matt creating the most delicious cocktails. After a few the rest of my friends showed up and we made our way to the table. We ordered the calamari (tangy with spice- perfect for five to split with other appetizers), artichoke hearts (the paste left the perfect subtle zest in your mouth- again split between five), and steak tartar (with the egg on top and salt to sprinkle- IT WAS AMAZING.) Again, let me reiterate, all did not disappoint! I am telling you, my friend's are the biggest foodies and couldn't have raved about the appetizers more. We split a few bottles of wine and all ordered the hanger steak medium rare/some did rare. First and foremost this steak was beautifully crafted. The chef cooked exactly to each request. (Finally a place that isn't afraid to cook rare because of the quality of the beef) We also ordered the potatoes for our side, and shared a bowl of the mushroom risotto- FANTASTIC! Highly recommend to add this order to split six ways as an additive. I cannot rave about the steak more- no one even talked during dinner because of the savory flavors. At the end we topped it off with a walnut cake- again the caramel sauce was divine. We stayed and drank for ours after, and there was never a rush from the staff to leave- in fact we stayed from open-close. The staff was nice and extremely helpful. This is absolutely at the top of my forever list and cannot wait to try the rest of the menu-inclusive of their bottomless mimosas for brunch!

2015-09-29,5.0,"This was our second visit to Unite and our experience was just as enchanting as the first. We sat on the patio and brought a bottle of wine and had the most relaxing and romantic date night.  The waitstaff is extremely friendly and knowledgeable about the menu and the General Manager, Trevor is an asset to the restaurant. He is new there and is very welcoming. As you can tell with my previous reviews, I treasure this part of my dining experience.  The menu is vast and there are a ton of options for whatever you are in the mood for. The ingredients are extremely fresh which result in very high quality dishes. Speaking of. We ordered the Chef's Flatbread with seasonal ingredients. I mean who doesn't like to play a little russian roulette with their flatbread now and again? It arrived with the perfect amount of spinach and goat cheese and olive oil. Simple and delicious. The crust was thin and it was the perfect amount for two people to share. Winner.  Then we tried the flash fried calamari. Try saying that fast five times. Either way, get it because it comes with an orange glaze that will make you want to tilt your head back and drink it. The dish was hot and crispy and not oily which is a huge deal for me, given that I am such a calamari critic.  Next came the house parmesan gnocchi made with mixed herb and pistachio pesto and it was absolutely divine. It was not a heavy dish at all, like with most gnocchi dishes and the fresh pesto was seasoned to perfection. We loved this dish and would definitely have this again.  We decided to skip dessert as we were really full. It was probably a good idea because if we did order dessert, we would have probably opted for a steak. Yes everything was THAT good.  Side note: We did order the ribeye previously and it would make a grown man cry.  Essentially, this restaurant is a gem and we will be going back there for sure. Decent prices for the quality of the menu and service and the corkage fee was not bad either.   I will admit, I was torn about posting this review as we would like to keep this place a secret but we all know the world does not work like that.

The white fish was very flavorful, seasoned nicely and a generous portion; burgers were very good; pork chops were a hit as well (2 bone-in chops). The sides were delicious! Cauliflower had a delicious Romesco olive oil that was positively addictive! Brussel sprouts had a type of pesto sauce on it....almost as good as cauliflower but I think the sprouts needed a tad more cooking (too hard to chew). I was surprised that yelp only gave it two $.

2015-09-04,2.0,"TL;DR  Mediocre food and service at a very high price. Would NOT recommend.  Came to this place with reasonable expectations. Saw very positive reviews, only $$ so it seemed to be a decently priced place. Was starving for some steak at a reasonable price, so this restaurant really stood out. Upon arrival, I already began to feel a little skeptical. Their cheapest steak was $26, which was a bit expensive for my liking, especially because it was only 8oz of steak. However, I was too hungry to find another place to eat, so I decided to stay. Ordered a Unite burger, a half rack of ribs, that $26 steak, and a dinner salad. First came the burger ($15 + $2 for bacon) which was probably the least expensive dish my family and I ordered. It included some fries, a small salad and of course, the burger. It was very plain, pretty much like a regular burger except that it was a little bigger than your average joe. Next up was the salad ($5). Pretty big disappointment, because the leaves were rotten and was quite small. More like a side rather than an actual dish. Next up was the steak. To be honest, it didn't taste all that bad. Quite flavorful, tasted alright. But I still was quite disappointed with it, for a few reasons. The steak was very small. I mean like, not-worth-26-bucks small. Could be just me, but I don't remember 8oz of steak being such a minute size. Also, there were no sides along with the steak, except for this one slice of onion. A side costs $5 to $10, so there's that. Way too overpriced for such little food. The ribs ($15) were also overpriced and ""meatless."" Also it was a bit overcooked, so it didn't taste very good. Also no sides, so not much for the price. If you're willing to spend a lot of money on steak, this is an okay place to go. But if you're like me and you're on a budget, still looking for good steak at a low price, I would find a different place. But don't make the same mistake I did coming to this over priced restaurant.",-0.8101,0.85,0.068,0.082,0.5136888830124124

This restaurant felt warm and neighborhood-y, with outstanding food and cocktails. I have celiac disease, and our waiter easily led us through the entire menu pointing out the ample gluten-free options; he was very well informed and my dietary restriction was no big deal. We ordered the steak tartare, Brussels sprouts, and sautéed mushrooms to share among the three of us, along with some cocktails. Each dish was fresh, flavorful, and well-balanced, and so were the cocktails. For dessert, the gluten-eaters enjoyed strawberry shortcake and I had some extra berries with cream (home-made and very tasty, though quite sweet) since the regular gf option was unavailable.

Both of our steaks were seasoned really well and cooked to perfection. I had the hanger steak and my husband had the ribeye - you could tell they were good as neither of us offered to share a taste. I would have to say the only hiccup in our meal was the wild mushroom risotto. The risotto left much to be desired as it was under seasoned and very oily. However, I'm sure if we would have gone with another side dish then we would have been happier.  I would like to caution - this place isn't cheap - our bill was over $100 for the 2 of us with food and drinks. They should really consider making it a $$$ instead of the current $$.

2015-06-09,4.0,"Dropped by Unite last Thursday for dinner to give this a second run; I came away more impressed with my overall experience, with one major point of hesitation. First, the food was mostly excellent.  This time around, we tried a flatbread that featured sausage, a couple of different cheeses, and a pistachio-based sauce that my wife said was very good (I avoid almost all nut-based items, so I skipped this one).  She also got the farro side dish, which was a lot of food for the serving size...we both thought that the farro was a little plain but we can't argue with the portion size.  We tried a couple of glasses of the rose on the wine menu as well as the Humboldt Park cocktail; all of the drink selections (like our first visit) were good and refreshing on an incredible 80-degree evening. We also had another round of the wings, and that's the reason to try out Unite if you have not been before...those are as good as any in the surrounding area, for sure. I got the veggie burger with the arugula salad, and this might take the place of the veggie burger I've had at Bite as my new favorite.  I can't claim to be an incredible source on veggie burgers since I get them much less than the flesh-and-blood variety, but the flavor in the one at Unite kept me (a hardcore carnivore) very happy throughout.  The arugula salad on the side was dressed lightly and just right...usually, I pass on the salad with burgers but this was perfect. Our server was working double duty between the bar and the patio outside, and this showed a bit as he had to run back and forth often to make drinks.  But he was significantly more knowledgeable of the menu than our server was during our first visit, a nice change.  And the same manager that was there for our first visit was there again, and he was a wealth of information on the Unite menu and other suggestions for things to do in the neighborhood. My main knock at Unite is still the prices; from the alcohol to some of the appetizers/sides, things are just a little higher than the restaurants nearby.  And some of the bourbon prices, in particular, are very high (Woodford Reserve for $15?)...a visit to Five Star reveals prices that are sometimes two-thirds of the drinks at Unite. Otherwise, I still think Unite is a very solid place to grab food, sit outside, and enjoy a variety of meat and non-meat dishes.  And everyone I have met at the restaurant has been very friendly, from the host stand to the owner, so I know it's a very accommodating group.  Give it a shot if you haven't already!",0.9954,0.874,0.119,0.007,0.5031719681284897

My first experience there we did not make reservations, so we ate and drank cocktails at the bar. Since then I make sure to have reservations, because they can get busy.  My absolute favorites are the Hanger Steak and the Bone-In Berkshire Pork Chops! I've tried all three steaks they have and the hanger steak is the clear winner. The pork chops are some of the best I have ever had. Most places including myself cannot cook pork chops well. Most of the time they are overcooked or dry. The pork chops at Unite are spot on, full of flavor, and delicious.  My favorite side is the Baked Cauliflower. AH-Mazing! I also enjoy the roasted fingerling potatoes and hand cut fries.  So far, the only app I have tried is the lamb meatballs and they are great.  Each time I visit Unite, the staff is very welcoming and attentive. Every time I visit Unite the manager comes by to make sure my meal and experience is to my satisfaction. Even the valet guy is super sweet. The best thing about Unite is the price you pay for the quality of food you get. It can't be beat.",0.995,0.757,0.229,0.014,0.6217777777777779
2015-04-13,3.0,"I was so looking forward to going here but I ended up pretty underwhelmed.  We had a group of five that was seated at two tables combined. After we were seated, a larger group came in and our waiter asked if we could move tables to a smaller table so they could have the bigger table. This is 100% not an issue we obliged. He offered us free cinnamon rolls for moving which was very nice of him. The cinnamon rolls were meh though. Kind of bland.  But they were free. I just wouldn't ever pay for them. The restaurant is set up nicely and I really loved that they took reservations for brunch because it seems like whenever I want to go to brunch in this city, I'm quoted an hour wait.  Things I liked: my boyfriend's fried french toast. He loved it too. I got the quiche of the day which was delicious. My friend's lobster benedict was amazing but not $20 amazing. I guess that's just what happens when you order lobster anything.  I also liked the arugula salad that came with my quiche. it was all thinly coated in a super delicious vinaigrette. Things I didn't like: the thick cut bacon is nowhere near thick cut. Maybe I expected too much. Au Cheval's bacon is easily a centimeter thick. The thick cut bacon at Unite Urban Grill was just ..thicker bacon. Like I could buy it from the grocery store and there's a decent chance a few slices of bacon are about as thick as what they served us. So then it was just overpriced bacon.  In general, I thought most of the meal was a bit over priced. The mimosas were $9. They were really strong which is nice but they weren't bottomless so at that point $9 is kind of steep for one small mimosa. The bloody mary's with their never ending garnishes were approximately the same price so they seemed like more bang for your buck. I realize bottomless mimosas would  never be as cheap as $9 but one should also not be $9.  The food also took a bit longer than expected but our server and a manager were apologetic and they was indeed a rush about when we came in.  It was a tasty meal but I probably wouldn't come back.",0.9982,0.753,0.218,0.03,0.621376811594203

Although the restaurant was packed when we got there, we didn't feel overwhelming and the ambience was amazing; it felt like we were at a friend's house.  Our intentions for the night were to try a little bit of everything and that's exactly what we did. We decided to try the lamb meatballs and that was an excellent choice. The meatballs were so moist, juicy and packed with favor, the sprinkled feta and the tomato sauce were the perfect pairing for this appetizer.  We decided to order a couple of drinks as well. I ordered the Noble Square, which had a great refreshing fruitiness to it and my husband ordered the Bucktown, which had a nice hint of citrus and the smokiness of bourbon without the harsh burn.  Next we ordered dinner, which consisted of a whole lobster, Prime rib, Ribeye, Cauliflower and Mushrooms. The lobster and the prime rib were specials for NYE and were done to perfection.  The lobster was grilled, brushed with a lemon and herbs and just the right texture and the butter was out of this world!! The 16oz Prime Rib was extremely tender and flavorful, the au jus was best I ever had. Usually au jus is extremely salty, but this au jus was incredible. Now, where else can you go in the city and get a 14oz Ribeye for 30 bucks, that's of great quality? I have tried Ribeyes at every steakhouse in the city and I can say, hands down this absolutely was the best steak I have ever tasted!! To add to the deliciousness of the night, we paired our steaks and lobster with mushrooms and baked cauliflower. The mushrooms had so many flavorful notes and were sautéed to perfection and the baked cauliflower paired with cheddar and Parmesan cheese was melt in your mouth good.

Decor is super cute with a mix of romantic and modern with dim lighting and couches at the entrance. We each had a glass of wine, shared the brussel sprouts and cauliflower, I had the salmon and she the full rack of ribs. I love my veggies and if I could prepare cauliflower like that every day, I would be in heaven. It tasted literally like mac and cheese! How the hell did they do that? The salmon was a smaller portion than anticipated but its quality was out of this world. I didn't have to chew, it melted on my tongue. I have never had salmon like that, even in the fanciest of restos. She loved her ribs like none other. Don't think I've ever seen my friend that happy over a meal in the 10+ years I've known her.

I could go on forever!  You have to go to Unite Urban Grill for brunch also, I might be back this Sunday!

2014-10-20,5.0,"Sometimes in life, you have to give things a second chance to fall in love. As you may know by reading my review #1 for Unite Urban, my first visit to Unite was not very pleasant. Joe, the owner, subsequently contacted me and tried to make things right. First of all, kudos to any business owner who cares that much about their patrons that they even reach out to unsatisfied Yelpers.  I walked in to Unite on a Saturday night to find a much different scene than I saw the first time. A very dim, romantic, hip, classy restaurant with beautiful decor. On visit #1, it was still day light out and I could not enjoy it nor appreciate it as much. The restaurant is small but still welcoming; this spot is perfect for a date night.  The nice, pleasant hostess sat us immediately upon check in (I had made a reso through Joe). BTW, they e-mail you the reservation information so you don't forget. Nice touch there, Unite.  Quinn, our awesome (uber nice) server, promptly came to the table and greeted himself while I was waiting for my dining partner and fellow Yelp Elite, Angie K to arrive. He told me that they had just released a new cocktail - ""Andersonville."" This was a sparkling beverage made with gin, prosecco, and I believe peach liquor (if I remember correctly). Though delicious as can be, I would recommend this for brunch not for dinner. I later opted to switch to the Pinot Noir that Quinn recommended and boy was he right. Their pinot paired perfectly with all things consumed that night.  Now on to the most important part of all things dining: the FOOD.  When I was waiting for Angie K to arrive, I was being the typical ""food spy."" Definition: one that sits at a table in a restaurant observing what others are eating in order to determine what looks good and later copies that persons meal to the T.  What caught my attention: the RIBS. I thought, ""hmm, I am not on a date; I am with a friend. Thank God!"" I could order those ribs and eat them like crazy Fred Flinstone without being judged.  I ordered a full rack - yup, hungry girl status! Angie K ordered the salmon as she is a pescatarian (a few fish options on the menu, hooray!); as for sides we ordered the cauliflower mac and cheese and the brussel sprouts. We also had the spinach/cheese flatbread as an app.  Listen here people, there was not one bad tasting thing on our table that night. Every SINGLE item was delicious.  The flat bread was amazing. Their spinach was something I've never seen before - so green and leafy; it almost looked like kale and tasted phenomenal.  Angie K said her salmon ""melted in her mouth"" and that she was able to cut into it like butter. It looked great, though I did not try it.  The ribs were THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. Seriously, I ranted and raved about these ribs to anyone I called/came in contact with the next day.  The brussel sprouts were so amazingly soft and perfectly seasoned (with parmesan cheese and herbs, I believe).  The cauliflower mac and cheese was my least favorite, though Angie's favorite! lol, different tongues, different strokes, I suppose. It was like, ""would you like some cauliflower with your cheese, madam?""  The cheese was a bit overpowering; still delicious but definitely too much of it.  As for dessert, we had the peanut butter mousse bar? It tasted like a butterfinger in the form of a cake. Though angelic in nature (lol), I'd choose another dessert next time as it was very rich. That cookie sandwich someone else mentioned on Yelp is a must next time.   Towards the end of our meal, both Joe (aforementioned owner) and Jason (manager) came up to introduce themselves to us. Both are very nice gentlemen and Jason is definitely not bad to look at either (eye candy alert!) Side note: the bathrooms were modern and very clean.  Overall, one of the best dining experiences I've had in Chicago thus far. This is why second chances are so important. I found out that they have a travelzoo special and bought that thing with the quickness the following day! I will 100% be returning. Thanks Unite.",0.9994,0.752,0.214,0.034,0.5391915989992914

2014-10-06,2.0,"Tried, but missed the mark Any restaurant (management) that cares about its customers will try to make things right, including comping your food. For the part of both diners and the restaurant, showing respect for your fellow humans goes a long way to helping the situation. Last night, Unite Urban Grille tried but missed the mark.  I have recommended this spot to others in the past. Now, I have nothing good to recommend. I do not like sweet and sour dining experiences.  --Did the manager work to get my wife's food right? YES, absolutely.  --Did the manager tell us ""certainly you will not have to pay for that?"" YES (the problem).  --Did the manager offer her an appetizer or something while her food was re-fired? CERTAINLY.  So...what was the problem?  When the check arrived, the manager kept his word and comp'd the messed up steak. However, the manager turned around and charged for the re-fired steak. ""Something is wrong here,"" I thought.  Although we spoke to him about his original play on words and he apologized for any misunderstanding, I was no longer interested in the last minute offer of free desert. Suddenly, I lost my appetite for their food.  Look, I understand that some larger restaurants may be able to financially absorb staff errors by comping the food. I get it. After all, it is much easier to comp an appetizer or a drink than a meal. Then again, I'm not a novice on the restaurant circuit. I let the manager know what my expectations were. When the error is with the meal, then an adjustment is customary with THAT meal. Even TGI Fridays comp's staff errors.  To his credit, the manager approached us while exiting to apologize for the error. He welcomed us again by sliding me a ""1 free appetizer"" coupon, ""with the purchase of any entree"" in small print. I'll pass (it on to somebody else).  Somehow a contingent complementary item reminds me of the sour patch kids candy slogan, ""Sour. Sweet. Gone.""  And, I don't like sour patch candy.",0.9496,0.699,0.167,0.134,0.44043513957307057

The presentation was lovely and the garnish high quality, with a lovely cheese and sausage to soothe the kick of the cocktail.  For dinner, I split both the watermelon salad and the French Dip sandwich, YUM! The watermelon salad with feta, arugula, and heirloom tomatoes was amazing, certainly a generous enough portion to constitute an entire meal. The balsamic drizzle and onions gave the perfect bite to a juicy meal.  The French dip was delicious; crusty bread that softened perfectly into the well seasoned au jus. The sandwich itself was a balance of smooth creamy cheese, and a nicely spiced mustard alongside the tender, uber-thin roast beef. Alongside a generous heaping of fresh fries, Unite Urban Grill really outdid itself tonight.  Honestly, as great as the food was, what impressed me most was the attentiveness to customer service, both from the staff and the owner himself. As I mentioned earlier, I was invited back in response to my previous review, showing a true dedication to give the best restaurant experience possible and personal interest in their patrons. I really appreciated the effort made to contact me about the update and that level of care and dedication is certainly apparent in the quality of food and service I received today.  All in all, fantastic, flavorful foods, delicious drinks, and a great staff. Unite Urban Grill has really hit the top of my list.",0.9981,0.693,0.289,0.017,0.5496843853820599
2014-07-23,4.0,"FINALLY!!! When I ordered my steak rare, it actually was delivered to my table.....(wait for it, wait for it) RARE!!! Thank the red meat stars!  I don't know why it's so hard even in great Midwestern steak houses to get a steak the right temperature.  But Unite did it. Bless their grill master's beating heart.  The rest of the food there was nice, the crunchy salad was nice but nothing that I couldn't make in 3 shakes of a spoon at home.  My hubby's burger was nice looking. I didn't get in between him and the bun otherwise I could tell you what it tasted like.  The couple at the table next to ours said their food was good but by far my steak looked the best.  Maybe it was my moaning while eating that made their own food seem less thrilling.  I will say, the manager/owner came around and was super nice about checking on us. Kudos for that warm gesture - I dig it.   However, our server returned after taking our wine order with a sample of another wine claiming that our bottle had to be pulled from storage and would take a few minutes, but wowwie, lookie here, we have another bottle of Hahn that is handy, would we like this one instead...it was his favorite!  Nice job on the attempted up-sell my man.  I've worked in restaurants, I get it. Get that check as high as you can so your tip will be better. Fully understand.  But come on?  Our bottle was a nice $40 Malbec, he came back with an $80 Hahn that sucked.  I'm not going for your suggestion because a) I didn't ask for your advice; b) I'm not doubling my wine spending tonight based on a sample and c) way to not be subtle about the up-sell.  I'm happy to be up-sold on lots of things like a side salad, dessert, an app, heck a bigger hunk of that awesome steak but approaching us to double the cost of our wine based on your unsolicited advice.  Thank you but no.  Kind of a stretch. Don't get me wrong...I will be back to get my rare steak.  I'll just have to continue to be firm about my wine selection and as always thank the manager/owner for his awesome restaurant!",0.9979,0.766,0.207,0.027,0.630017857142857
2014-07-20,2.0,"It was hard determining how many stars to give this place, because I had such an odd experience here. My girlfriends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday night. The atmosphere is modern and stylish: I liked the decor, but not the fact that the place was ridiculously loud almost the entire night. The bathrooms were super clean, which is always a big plus. Service was above average and the food was fairly priced, considering the fact that we were eating in West Town and received a decent amount of food for our money. Now on to the actual dining and drinking experience. First, the drinks. Unite Urban Grill offers a variety of innovative specialty cocktails. I am a pretty adventurous drinker, and I happily downed a few Logan Squares, and sampled my friend's West Town and Pilsen. At one point during the evening, I attempted to order a French martini, and they couldn't make it for me because they were out of pineapple juice, which seems like a very odd thing for a bar to run out of, but oh well. Overall, the cocktails were very good. On to the food itself. The appetizers were hands-down the best part of the meal. Our group shared the Spinach Flatbread and the Lamb Meatballs, which were both divine. For entrees, one friend ordered the Lake Superior Whitefish, which she was very happy with. My other two friends each ordered the Vegetable Gratin, which I sampled and thought was good, but nothing more than that. The flavor was a bit bland and the eggplant was a little on the tough side.  I ordered the French Dip Sandwich, which was by far the worst entree at our table. The roast beef was this very odd shade of pale elephant gray and just did not taste too great. My sandwich came with a ton of fries, which were excessively coated in salt, to the point that I could only eat a few of them. It was not good. To compensate, I sampled some of the vegetable appetizers we ordered for the table, including the asparagus and the brussel sprouts, both which were very good. For dessert, we all shared a piece of the lemon cake, which again I thought was just okay. Nothing special. So why does this average dining experience deserve only a two-star rating? Well, after I went home, I was up all night, sick as a dog. It was not pleasant. Could it have been due to something I ate that night? Maybe, but I had no way of knowing for sure...until I talked with one of my friends the next day, who told me that she also was sick to her stomach the same night after our dinner. Two very upset stomachs at the same time on the same night, right after sharing a lot of the same food does not sit well with me, my friends. For that reason, along with the mediocre dining experience in general, I will not be returning to Unite Urban Grill.",0.9972,0.74,0.188,0.072,0.5272850035536601
2014-07-20,4.0,"Yum!  My fiance and I went here for here for his birthday dinner date. He was seeking a place that was still in the two price-sign range for entrees but fancy enough for a special occasion.  He also always wants great steak for his birthday.  I have to say, this place fulfilled all of these requirements perfectly. The meat dishes we got were really the stars here.  He got the NY Strip Steak medium rare and I got the Hanger Steak also medium rare. Both cuts were juicy and bursting with flavor. The seasoning/marinade on both was delicious and they were cooked perfectly. The service was also fantastic. Our waiter was knowledgeable, helpful, and friendly. And the manager checked up on us after our meal and made us feel extra cared for.  Only not five stars because our side of asparagus was good but not amazing and our side of mushrooms was weird to us...maybe too many earthy-tones...I'm not sure what it was.  In general, I'm really happy with our dinner here and will be planning to come back and try additional dishes (especially other meat dishes!).",0.9945,0.711,0.24,0.049,0.6765355417529332

2014-06-21,3.0,"Although Unite is my rebound boyfriend due to Flo's popularity and negligence of my existence, he is so sweet and nice that makes me feels bad for dumping him for the next guy.  What makes Unite a great rebound? 1) He is a gentleman who makes sure that your glass is filled with water 24/7. 2) Despite the fact that he does not have soy milk, he tries his best to provide you a substitute - skim milk.  3) He is soft-spoken, clean and fashionable. Why do I hesitate in going on another date with Unite? 1) The food is decent but not memorable. For my granola, I like the fact that the yogurt is not too sweet. However, the dried fruits overpowered the yogurt and the rest of the ingredients. 2) The selection of tea and coffee is limited. My favorite chai tea is not available. However, it is great to have early grey as an option. 3) Unite has many competitors, such as Bongo Room and Feast, in the area. In order to stand out, Unite has to serve a unique dish.

The rest of the space is laid out nicely with a great vibe. The steaks are fantastic and the sides are equally delicious.  On top of that, the service is top notch and very personal. On two occasions, the owner has made it a point to come out and ask how the meal had gone and to talk about our night. Additionally, the servers are all personable and too off the experience.

2014-05-03,5.0,"Whoa.  Atmosphere, food, AND presentation. Atmosphere: I will preface this by saying that if you are looking for a quiet, traditional steakhouse restaurant atmosphere, this is not for you.  This is not what I was looking for, so I was very content. They have an open entrance and the music is a little louder to cover the noise from the street.  The atmosphere is more progressive (read: hipster-friendly).  They have outdoor seating, couch seating in the lounge, bar seating, and traditional seating (if you want the higher tables in the back, make a reservation.  The rest is first come, first serve).  Decor and lights are creative and provide a nice ambience. Food/presentation: My wife ordered the beef filet and I ordered the goat cheese ravioli (I feel secure in my masculinity, plus I knew I would be getting her leftover steak).  We hadn't eaten in a while, so the wait felt longer than it actually was.  Not only was the food great (steak was not as moist as I prefer, but my wife is pregnant, so she needed it cooked a little extra.  In spite of this, it still tasted great), but it looked amazing.  Perhaps we were so hungry we would say this no matter what they brought out, but they do a great job of making the food taste and look like it came out of a 5-star kitchen. Overall, we had a great experience and would definitely be back if we lived closer to Chicago (we're from Rockford).  For now, I will recommend it to my childless friends who have time to make the drive and live vicariously through them.",0.9857,0.832,0.142,0.026,0.5185185185185185

There are couches and seating areas when you immediate walk in, along with a bar and dining tables further in. Very well done. First was for Brunch on Easter. Fortunately is was not an inflated price Easter brunch, but the normal brunch with regular prices. I had the omelet, which was good. The side of bacon, while generous in size, I could not finish and it was very greasy, even for bacon. The bloody mary was not spicy and was fine. I also went last night. We had a salad, which was good and sliders, which were also good. My friend got ravioli, which was also very good. I ordered the NY strip, which came cooked to order, which is not always the case. My problems with the steak ($33) was that is was very fatty. Not marbled, but fatty, which left very little meat. In sum, very good but I would not get the NY strip again.

2014-04-16,4.0,"A great addition to the neighborhood. I really enjoy this upscale, yet reasonably priced restaurant. I went with my girlfriend on a Tuesday night, so it was pretty easy to get seated without the weekend crowd. The owner, Dan, was playing host and offered to check our coats on our way to being seated. I found Dan to be very friendly. He took the time to make sure we were satisfied at the end of the meal and we did a little Q&A about larger groups, happy hours, etc. His recommendation was for larger groups (we inquired about 10-12) we'd need to make reservation a week or more in advance. Drinks: They have a comprehensive drink menu. The manhattan and sazerac were made very well, more on the mixology side, but not over the top. i.e. you get the luxardo cherries and not everything is served over ice. Food: The menu is ala carte, so you'll be looking at $12 to $35 for main course plus $5-$7 for sides. I had the ribs for $19 (I think) and asparagus for $7. Both were cooked to perfection. My girlfriend had the French Dip, which comes with fries. That was under $15. It is a large serving, so we took most of the French Dip home with us. Overall, I think the menu is well-balanced with plenty of options for starters, salads, variety of entrees and sides. Layout: There is a lounge area in the front, separated into squares able to seat 5-6. Total seating in the lounge area would be about 30-40. The middle of the restaurant houses a long narrow bar, seating 10-15, as well as several 2-4 person tables able to seat another 20+ opposite the bar. In the back, there are 2-3 high tables, each able to seat 10-12. I think they have about 4, new, clean single unisex restrooms.",0.9788,0.889,0.105,0.006,0.475498837582171

2014-03-30,5.0,"Excellent addition to the scene. We had our eye on Unite since the fall when we noticed it opened but kept forgetting to insert it into the rotation. Tonight we finally got our act together, and we were very happy. The restaurant is beautifully conceived and the execution of the design is highly professional. The effect is stylish without being fussy or pretentious. Unite is that rare combination: a great place for both an informal hang with friends, or a first date with someone whom you are particularly interested in. The design cues are vaguely retro (think Madmen) but in no way overwrought. The environment feels fresh and modern. Subdued hues, with just the right amount of lighting. Music played mercifully discreetly: you won't find the numbing decibel levels that are a hallmark of many restaurants these days and that repel many, including this yelper. In fact, it is easily possible to have a discreet and intimate conversation at Unite. That conversation will be punctuated by well placed help from the excellent staff, and delicious food that is served with genuine care and pride. The flatbread was a tasty appetizer and the short rib sliders were sensational. Our server told us that the lamb meatballs were a perennial favorite and given how juicy and delicious they were it is easy to see why. The roasted chicken was served slathered with a mildly sweet barbecue sauce...really tasty. Pork chops were juicy and cooked to perfection. Baby carrots were delicious in mild indian spices creating a perfect foil for the grilled flavors in the meat. The brussel sprouts, cooked in a delicate pesto were truly some of the best I have ever had. I can't comment on the cocktails as we didn't partake but given the overall quality of the experience I would lay odds that the bar is on point.

Our servers name was Aaron, a great guy with a very natural personality for serving. He gave us a great description of the idea behind the restaurant, and any of the items on the menu.       We didn't order an appetizer, but we did have two fantastic dinner dishes with a side.  (I did  start with the house salad which was made with all fresh ingredients, croutons included, and was delicious!) My husband had the 'half Amish chicken' glazed in BBQ sauce. It was done to perfection and he ate everything but the bones. I ordered the 'Irish organic salmon' medium well, and was beyond happy with my choice.  We shared an order of e 'roasted fingerlings potatoes'  cooked with bacon, cartelized onion and parsley. AMAZING.      After our delectable dinner we had to try dessert. We each order a coffee with Frangelico, and two plates off the dessert menu.  'Sticky toffee pudding' and 'peanut butter mousse cake' were the winners. Good god, they were frickin delicious. We would definitely go back for just the dessert even!       All in all, a fantastic experience. I would give Unite 10 stars if I could! To top it off, right before we ate dessert, one of the owners (Jeff I think?) stopped by our table to make sure everything was up to par.  A very nice, down to earth guy, he made us feel like he really cared about our experience there.        We will definitely go back, and will hopefully bring a few more people so they can have a great experience as well!",0.9986,0.693,0.3,0.007,0.5633386243386245

The ambiance is fantastic as well. The restaurant is well decorated, comfortable and offers a wide array of seating styles. The bar is cozy - I will definitely come back to hang out at the bar just for drinks. Appetizers/ Snacks: 1. Lamb meat balls (5): these were simply delicious - the sauce worked, the size was ideal, and paired well with the toast 2. Spinach flatbread (3.5): I found this dish a little dry and missing some flavor. Having said that, it went perfectly with the lamb meat balls, particularly the sauce of the dish. 3. Sliders (4): The meat was well prepared, but I was hoping for more sauce. My friends loved these, though. Mains: 1. 8 oz Hanger Steak (4.5): The steak is delicious, almost a 5. 2.

Burger - I did not have a taste, but my friends really liked it. Sides: 1. Mushrooms (5) - amazing 2. Faro with cauliflower (4) - great concept but was over-peppered slightly Dessert: 1. Molten Chocolate Cake (3): my friends are experts in this dessert and were disappointed - not much ""melting"" of the filling 2. Cookie Plate (3.5): thank you for offering this to us on the house - the lemon bar was fantastic, but the cookies were not memorable, but i believe the selection varies.

Brussels sprouts (1/5): definitely missing seasoning. Salt...bacon...something. I love Brussels sprouts and I hated these.  Half Chicken (2/5): boring. The bbq sauce was way too sweet. Chicken was cooked well enough. The menu is pretty boring. The food was boring. The atmosphere was boring.

His burger was very well done and they don't ask how you'd like it prepared. It was so well done that the sides of the meat were crunchy.

2013-12-28,5.0,"The Order (party of 5):  Cheese plate, Olives, Lamb Meatballs, Brussels Sprouts, Mushrooms, fingerling potatoes, Rack of ribs, Hangar Steak (x2) and Organic Salmon (x2), and several mixed drinks and a couple of beers. I did not list the ""fancy"" names of each item there, go to the menu for details (e.g., Brussels sprouts were crusted with pistachios). Me Being Critical:  If you are in a hurry, you should tell them. Our dinner was 2.5 hours, and leisurely. I bet they could have moved faster if we'd asked, but just be warned that you should tell them if you don't want to linger long over drinks before food arrives.  Don't be shy about asking for extra plates - the plates themselves are a tad small, and we ended up asking for several extra throughout the meal (e.g., the ribs were overflowing off of the plate!). If you are a dessert person and like to know if you are going to order that when you are planning your other food, you have to ask for a dessert menu at the start (on a separate menu). Food:  The cheeses were excellent - sheep, goat, and cow - excellent textures, clearly this chef knows how to choose cheese (we are San Francisco cheese snobs). The olives were excellent - very generous portion, too! I dare say for that quality of olive, it was cheaper in this restaurant than at Whole Foods!  The steaks were wonderfully seasoned say the steak eaters (I was a salmon eater). Everything was fantastic. When we said ""rare"" on the salmon - behold - it WAS rare! Same for the steaks!  The waiter told us that the rib recipe had been a work in progress - my co-diner (ahem, brother) really enjoyed them. Of note - they are Chicago style, meaning not fall off of the bone, you have to work at it a little bit. The sauce was very tasty, not too much heat.  The lamb meatballs were outstanding. The table over from us (who we ended up talking to because they ordered such wildly different food from us, and we were curious) said the sliders were their favorite appetizer (which we did not get, so can't personally speak to).  Bar & Staff:  Says my co-diner, ""they really know how to make a cocktail the way that you want it."" The Manhattans were great - they use brandy-soaked cherries, and when my co-diner said ""very, very sweet"" the bartender took that to heart. My beer-aficionado co-diner was impressed with the ""off-menu"" beer offerings (the waiter tells you about these) and enjoyed two rarities. Another co-diner says, ""fun and friendly staff - they really know the menu.""  The owner came over to ask us about our meal, as did his lovely wife. They seem very enthusiastic about what they are doing, and from the look of it, a lot of their friends frequent the place (we saw them greet at least 10 people with hugs while dining).  Atmosphere:  The restaurant was very beautiful. I especially loved that the bar has hooks underneath for purses! Granted we were at a table and I saw others do this, it was more of a ""if I were at the bar, I'd do that."" I personally liked that the music wasn't too loud - I could hear everyone speaking at our table (for 5) but not the next - the tables were appropriately spaced.  My husband (co-diner) liked that his steak was served on a cutting board. He thought that was ""classy"" (I don't know about his choice of word there, but they were cute cutting boards). In sum, we loved the restaurant. The prices were quite fair for the quality and quantity of food that you receive.

I will give the review in this 4 part simple way. -Decor:  Great layout and design, Love the lounge area in the front of the restaurant, This area could have been used for more tables and more revenue. Using this space as a waiting area and lounge shows the customer dedication from the owner and they get a big  A++ for that. -Food: I had the Rib-eye steak and it was one word ""Delicious"" I can't wait to try the pork chop on my next visit. The price of the meal was reasonable $70 for two. I really think the area needs a nice restaurant like this. Every main course item is ala carte as the lady said in one of the early reviews. I think this is just an amateur restaurant owner mistake. Really great restaurants pair things together because the flavors compliment each other. -Service: The service was amazing, Everyone was great. The thing I liked the most is that all the waiters seemed to be watching each other tables to make sure the customers where happy. In a lot of places the waiters are only worried about the tables they are getting a tip from. -Suggestions: 1. Add sides to your selections (With a substitute option) 2. Don't sell fish with bones in it (Everyone knows that the cheap part of the cut) 3. Make Bottled Water an option on your drink list. (Filtering your water doesn't remove the fluoride) 4.

2013-11-23,2.0,"So the space is very nice, with a cool loungey type area when you first walk in, a huge inviting long bar with bench seating along the opposite wall, and then more tables beyond.  Service was also very good.  The food disappointed.   Appetizer was shortrib sliders which were the highlight of the evening - 3 very delicious, decent size sliders on yummy buns with some type of slaw.  If what followed was as good as the appetizer I'd give this place 5 stars. Sadly it wasn't. Dinner was ribs, burger and a side of brussel sprouts.  Except for the burger which comes with fries, every main course item is ala carte - so with the ribs you get sauce.  With the chicken you get sauce.  With the steak you get - oh you get the idea.  So it ends up being quite pricey.  But the real problem is the ribs were not that good - 2 large slabs, but my husband missed the smokey flavor usually found with good BBQ and I found them very fatty (even for ribs).  The burger was very mediocre, not memborable.  The 'carmelized brussel sprouts' had no carmelization at all and were overcooked.  The flavor was ok, but who cares when the sprouts are mushy? For one app, two mains, one side and one bottle of wine our bill was 100 bucks not including tip.",0.9465,0.823,0.131,0.047,0.6113871635610766

Ribs - Not as good as my husbands but they're really good for not being at a BBQ joint. Hen of the Woods side - OMG.  If you love mushrooms, you'll love this.   Salmon Crudo - Ahhmazing and absolutely fresh tasting. I think everything here is a bit on the $$ side, but I kept ordering and kept enjoying so I guess I wasn't that annoyed by the prices. I think this place will do just fine.  A word on the bathrooms - Awweesome cause you have your own little room!  BUT - I wish they'd get better soap.  It smells like I just walked out of the doctor's office and it leaves my hands incredibly dry. Other than that, I'll be back (unfortunately for my pocket book) Oh - and the bar stools are so comfortable.",0.9946,0.704,0.289,0.007,0.5968487394957984
2013-11-16,2.0,"We had high hopes for this new restaurant and assumed we'd have no problem getting seated given that we visited during its first week being open.  Unfortunately, when we arrived we were told only lounge seating was available and we later learned all of the tables were reserved for friends of the owner to dine at the restaurant.   The menu looked great but dish after dish came out leaving much to be desired.  My boyfriend ordered his steak cooked rare and it came out well-done, as were the brussel sprouts...no amount of delicious pesto could hide the burnt taste.  The salmon crudo was lacking in citrus and the citrus seemed to be replaced with what looked and tasted like tons of olive oil...the dish was pretty but that's about all it had going for it.  The cheese plate contained three slivers of boring hard white cheeses and bread that cut the roof of my mouth.   I'm hoping that maybe they just need some more time to get on their feet and iron out the kinks but I'm not sure we'll give it another try...",0.9233,0.802,0.121,0.077,0.6115796857463525
2013-11-14,5.0,"Rock solid. For an opening week, it could not have been smoother. We highly enjoyed the burger and salmon entrees, but for my money, the brussels sprouts were the best I've had. Wine recommendations were spot on, and the cocktails were also Well prepped. Joe Krouse was sincerely interested in our opinions. So here they are.  We got a great new addition to the restaurant lineup in WesTown. I'll be back. More than once. Thanks, Joe and Megan!!",0.9852,0.695,0.305,0.0,0.3893939393939394
2013-11-13,5.0,"Great Space, Great Place!  Very warm, yet upbeat atmosphere, perfect for a cold night in Chicago.  I had the Hanger Steak - which was done perfectly, and tried the pork chop, which was very moist and flavorful.  The sides where not secondary to the meal - Brussel Sprouts, Fingerling Potatoes & (yes Trevor P) the Carrots.  Who gets excited about Carrots you ask - well - at least two people.  I was talking about the carrots all night...and since.  For dessert the Sticky Toffee Pudding was very difficult to stop eating - so I didnt, dirty looks aside, it was awesome. It was a great night at Unite Urban Grill and I am looking forward to my next night there.",0.983,0.71,0.251,0.039,0.6612500000000001
