2016-09-25,1.0,"Let me start this review by saying I am a ex bartender and dive bar enthusiasts.  I would give this place less than 1 star if I could! I have been to Carol's on multiple occasions. But the last time we where in the bartenders were charging my friends double the posted price for pitchers of domestic beer. It said they were 8.00 on a sign hanging in the bar. But We where charged 16.00. Needless to say we paid and left immediately after finishing our pitcher. This bar has all the intangibles to be a great neighborhood dive bar, but the way they treat newcomers is awful! Over charging for drinks, very rude service, and horrible bar conditions make this place one to avoid!   Oh wait you don't have to worry about accidently stumbling I to this shit hole, they are closed now indefinitely, for unknown reasons.

I've been to a few honky-tonks and a good amount of dive bars, and based on one sorry Saturday night, I couldn't classify Carol's as anything other than a dump. It was 1 a.m. and the crowd was already sloppy and trashy, and not in the fun way that some people can manage. This, along with the surly bartenders, surly live band (which was actually decent but missing personality), and lack of anything worth drinking more than once said to me that this is the kind of place where no one gives any fucks about anything.  Having been excited at the prospect of an endearingly rowdy Chicago honky-tonk, I am sorely disappointed.

Upon entering we were greeted and asked what we'd like to order. For starters we asked for a beer, a shot of Jim Beam, and a Cranberry Mojito. We got everything minus the Cranberry Mojito; the bartender actually asked us what the was! Shocked. I thought that was odd, I ended up skipping the explanation and ordered a Vodka Cranberry.  For the 3 drinks the tab came out to $8.00... I didn't know what to make of that. A part of me couldn't help but question what I was drinking and the other part I told myself to stop thinking and keep drinking. The bar itself is very divey and the customers they draw in come from all walks of life! Expect to see young college students, young & old neighborhood locals, etc.. If there isn't a live band playing, have no fear, the background music is all over the place! Last night we heard some old school will smith, some 90's rap, and a couple country songs! Everyone seemed to enjoy the music. Some were dancing, most mingling, and most enjoying alcohol fueled conversations while enjoying the complimentary popcorn!

Authentic, working class, unintentionally weird, and retro. The furniture is mismatched and scarred and past it's prime. Some of the patrons are as well. But, there's a glitter and optimism in the grit. A spark or energy on certain nights. And that's what makes it a fun place that most anyone would enjoy. Of course there's pool, darts, and a jukebox. Sunday and Wednesday are open mic. Thursday nights is karaoke and that was a hoot. Friday and Saturday is live honky tonk country music, which juxtaposed with the atmosphere has it's own campy appeal. They are open until 5 am on weekends btw.  Prices and specials are nothing to write home about ($10-12 pitchers of draft domestics?) and don't expect an expertly crafted cocktail from a mixologist. That's like when my friend Jimmy and I went to McDonald's and he ordered his burger rare. Don't be that guy. Be happy if you get a G&T or Cape Codder.

The two stars here go for Diamondback, the old couple, and the memories. I love to hear Third Rate Romance and Goodbye Earl on my birthday and Diamondback has always delivered. I love learning line dances from the precious ""house"" couple. I love getting a birthday bear on my birthday from the nice older man at the bar.  However, tonight, the group I was with had some coins for discounted beers which are given out by the bartenders. The waitress yelled at them that they should have told her about said coins before ordering (how were we supposed to know that?) and that she has to pay for the beer to give to her customers and would have to ""beg the bar for her money back."" What? I don't even know what that means.  I had opened a tab earlier in the night and the bartender was nice enough, so we just started getting drinks from him. Problem solved. Rightttttt?  The waitress came back by and offered to close out my tab (I think it was pretty clear she was done with us) only to discover that the bartenders had given my card to someone else. I understand mistakes happen and several of the cards look the same--but I only saw the bartenders look for my card twice, no apology was offered, they barely looked up or stopped what they were doing, I paid full price in cash for my tab, and I had to immediately end my night to call my bank and cancel my accounts (totally the way every girl wants to spend her birthday).

Let's start with the door guy:  Big, heavily tattooed, rude, mean and reeking of cigarettes. I imagine some past history working with the mob. Don't fuck with him unless you want to find your sorry ass stuffed face first into the back dumpster. The decor: Like Dresden after the blast--with Christmas lights..I believe that instead of using paint for the walls, they just set fire to the place and had the weekend crowd just puke and pee on the walls to extinguish it. Moving on to the staff: They all really hate you and wish you would just slide your drunken ass off the duct taped bar stool to the linoleum floor shellacked in vomit and drop dead. Just order pitchers of whatever kind of beer they decide to bring you so they don't go postal on you. The customers: During the week, its a Hell's Angel convention mixed with what appears to be transients, retirement aged alcoholics and ex-cons. You're not going to make a friend here. During the weekends, it becomes a novelty slumming destination for local barflies and clubbers needing some excitement in their lives. ( I was kidnapped unwillingly) They won't make you a strawberry daiquiri at this place, order the Jack Daniels as a substitute. The music: Who cares! you'll be so shit-faced  drunk you would be dancing if they played death metal! There is a live band right out of the Boar's Nest from The Dukes of Hazzard playing all the whatever and what have you country music. Bonus for the ladies! There's an old 70 something guy hanging out at the dance floor ready to dance with your drunk-ass girlfriends and you and will not be shy to ask you right up. Now  I have heard the legend of the bathrooms at Carol's for years but did not think they could actually be worse. They are. Mother of God and all that is holy, do not use the bathrooms!! Gas station restrooms and truck stops blush in embarrassment for being too clean when compared to the pride and joy of Carol's.

""Like walking in the rain and snow, when there's nowhere to go.""   Carol's is, quite frankly, in the middle of nowhere.  And I think they like it that way.  It's like going to another state to stumble upon this ramshackle old place.  And usually when I've found myself there, it's about the time where I'm in another state - Drunkanus - as well.  They're a 5:00 a.m. bar on Saturdays.  5:00 a.m.  That's no longer late, it's early.  Where else would one go?  Breakfast?   ""And you're feeling like a part of you is dying.""   As I mentioned, country music and me don't get along so this line is fitting.  But, shockingly, on the weekends country music isn't all they play between live band sets.  I found myself drunkenly singing along with (my main homeboy) Billy Joel's ""Piano Man.""  They even played Blink-182 if drunken memory serves.  The band also didn't stick to strictly country.  They played rock hits that bordered on country like the Allman Brothers' ""Ramblin' Man"" and Jimmy Buffett's ""Margaritaville.""  A table of douchebags nearby really liked both.  Sadly, I kind of think that audience has taken over this bar.  I was almost disappointed.  I came expected for my ears to bleed with country, not bad fratrock.   ""And you're looking for the answer in her eyes.  You think you're gonna break up, then she says she wants to make up.""   They have plenty of things of things for both situations.  Cheap pitchers of crappy beer abound to drown your sorrow - served by a saucy (vaguely attractive in a 3:00 a.m. way) waitstaff.  And to express your ""joy"" they have a hopping dance floor.  Slow dancing, square dancing, honkeytonk dancing.  I didn't see any line dancing, but I've heard it exists there.  And if you ever get the chance to go with Nishan P., he's quite a dancer (just saying ladies).  I, however, am not.  I'm too busy getting dizzy from the alcohol and the country music.   Anyway, 10cc goes on to talk about love and feelings and blah, blah, blah.  Stuff that has nothing to do with Carol's.  It's not a horrible time.  But, I'll tell you what (said in a mock Texas accent).  I'd have to be dragged (or drugged) to go there again.  Maybe even with the promise of things done for love afterwards.",0.9905,0.776,0.146,0.078,0.5335585585585586

2010-05-05,2.0,"It hurts me to give Carol's only two stars. Once upon a time, this would have been a 5 star bar, however, time and perspective has changed this. When I first started frequenting carol's pub, it still had a reputation for being downright scary (apparently they used to have chicken wire over the stage at one point). We used to drop in on thursdays and do karaoke, check out Diamondback on weekends, and then hog the jukebox on Monday nights for .75 old styles in a frosty mug, playing tanya tucker and conway twitty till we couldn't see straight. Soon, the karaoke word got out and it stopped being ""its only make believe"" and started being ""baby got back."" Don't get me wrong, sir mix a little is pretty normal karaoke-fodder, but something just says ""no"" to that in a hillbilly bar. Its like putting soy sauce on a rainbow cone, or ketchup on a vienna beef hot dog. Then, the weekends started getting a little more difficult to navigate. You'd roll in about 1:30 or 2 and all of a sudden you couldn't move, and the people are all wearing these weird blue baseball caps with a red letter C on them, and pants of this odd, sandy color, like Hitler... I still thought Diamondback was a pretty good band...  Then-- I moved to Austin, Texas. Three years since my last visit to Carol's, I went back. They had recently instituted the $5 cover charge before I had moved, so that wasn't a big whup, and the crowd was not much worse as a crowd than I remember. However, my perspective had changed. The dance floor was like the last hour of a wedding for uncoordinated alcoholics  with open bar... I didn't see any dancing, just a few seizures and my god, dancing to country music requires a partner at the very least. Personal space is non-existent, and I am sad to say, I have either been spoiled by the quality of music here in Austin, or Diamondback is SO damn bored of playing the same 4 songs that the crowd knows that they have just resorted to looking and sounding like a wound-down music box.

Outrageous prices for drinks, smells like puke, cramped, and finding the women's bathroom was a quest. The men's bathroom is marked on the wall. Ladies is to the right if you're wondering but it's only marked on the door. Other girls asked me where the bathroom was too. Thank God it had 2 or 3 stalls. I don't remember exactly but that's WAY better than one. Especially for the amount of people backed in there and the line. We stayed maybe 30 minutes but that was all it was pretty much amusing for. Not that I was very amused from minute 4 haha. It was a waste of 5 dollars (cover :() I would not likely go back. Not my kin d of place.

With that being said, Carol's is the tragic dive bar that has become ironically hip with the local twenty/thirty somethings.  How hip, you might ask?  Lets just say that I personally witnessed two members of the hit alterno-rock band Spoon enjoying a beverage after one of their sold-out shows.  However, neither one was the lead singer/songwriter, Britt What's his Face, so maybe he caught on to Carol's ever-diminishing hipster status before it was too late. I also want to note that I have never been to this bar on a weekday, nor I have been any earlier than 12:00 a.m., so my opinion is somewhat limited to this particular time slot/demographic, namely the ""already wasted, last-ditch effort to find a nice lookin' lady/gentlemen for the evening"" crowd. What made Carol's great has started to deteriorate.  Gone are the days of cheap beer and have since been replaced with $5 covers and $5 domestic bottles, hardly the modus operandi of the hipster late night bar.  Think about it: you walk into Carol's, drop $5 for the cover, drop $5 for a bottle of Bud, and leave a $1 tip.  You've now just dropped $11 for a beer in a ""dive"" bar.  You probably could have bought a cute little SATC-worshipping, Jetta-driving, Wicker Park ""consultant"" a neon colored martini with that $11, which I would argue is a far better investment. And what does the $5 cover entail?  Well, the sultry sounds of Carol's highly competent yet rarely spectacular house band, regaling the crowd with standard country classics such as Johnny Cash's ""Ring of Fire,"" Dwight Yokam's ""Guitars and Cadillacs,"" as well as the Randy Travis hit, ""I'm Gonna Love You Forever,"" among others.  With such popular favorites, it's only a matter of time until the inebriated twenty/thirty somethings begin gyrating on the decent-sized dance floor, which being a white male with a limited rhythmic capacity, leaves yours truly somewhat on the outside looking in. Despite my somewhat negative outlook on the future of Carol's, two things will keep me going back. One is that I have a unwavering belief that once something loses its hipster status, there is an inevitable backlash.  Once the backlash occurs, the crowds begin diminishing as well, which would hopefully lead to lower cover charges/drink prices. Oh, and I also tend to do alright with the ladies at this bar, which tends to negate the $5 cover charge.",0.9733,0.829,0.109,0.062,0.48610188261351045

The $5 cover turned out to be WELL worth it as the band (who upon first glance didn't look like the hippest cowboy cover tune band in the city) rolled out one great friggin' song after another. Seriously... I know very little country but they played all of the classics.  I was absolutely shocked because of how far north this place is, how many people crammed in there throughout the night. We arrived at close to 1am and we were able to snag some bar stools, but the people were shoulder-to-shoulder and back-to-back. I tried so hard not to have to use the restroom but that didn't work out for me. The walk from one side of the bar to the other was RIDICULOUS. Think trying to shove your way to the stage at a summer music festival. The restroom like was seriously retarded but yay for Carol's - they had TP a'plentiful!  The crowd was unlike any crowd I've ever encountered at a bar in Chicago - SUCH a mix. You had your elderly dudes on the dance-floor, your d-bags sporting the long-sleeve, button-down shirts untucked, your hoochies wearing a tunic as a dress... but then you had your HOT hipsters, a couple of guys in varying color Peter Pan hats (or as I called them ""Ellie the Elf""), my friend Andy in his cowboy hat, a dude playing pool with a karate belt tied around his head, a crazy server who drank the Ocean Spray Cranberry Juice in-between pouring it in some well drinks and some bomb-ass people who tried to clear a path so I could get through the crowd without dying... Basically a whole lot of people from obviously varying 'hoods, just looking to have a good time and listen to some great music.  I will definitely go back, but this time I'll take public transportation. You can't afford to drink after paying for taxi's and the cover! Shoot...",0.989,0.812,0.143,0.045,0.5875

After walking in the door I made a straight B-Line for the bathroom, because I had to pee. When I locked the door behind me and turned around, I couldn't stop laughing at the giant sticky fly trap hanging from the bathroom ceiling right next to where I was squatting. There's nothing like looking at dead flies and gnats while you're unloading your bladder, huh? To make it even better, someone who was in there right before me left the toilet paper on the sink instead of on the back of the toilet. Of course, I didn't notice this until AFTER I had peed all over the place. I'm not the drip and dry kind of gal, so my only option was to scurry across the bathroom with my pants down to grab the TP. And that's what I did - I scurried. I wiped my cho-cha and had to mock wash my hands with the bar soap that was sitting there. The live band is hysterical, if you go on a non-karaoke night. They play much older country than you or I would truly appreciate, unless you're too busy balancing your dentures on top of your PBR can...And if you watch the lead female singer of the band tapping her toe with her crazy hair while she's fake playing her guitar? It makes it even more enjoyable. Be careful of the dance-lesson man, though. He's a professional line dancer and gets incredibly angry if you ask him to teach you to line dance during a two-stepping song.

2008-01-03,1.0,"Carol's Pub gained popularity a few years back after the Tribune wrote it up as a great dive bar.  And a dive it truly is. Toothless customers, a bouncer who looks like a cross between a Hell's Angel and John Popper and who sells lingerie on the side and bartenders who I haven't trusted since the time four years ago when my girlfriend ordered an Absolute and soda and the thin, Irish bartender kept saying to her, ""You like that drink?  You're gonna like that drink.""  An hour later she was passed out at home after only having that one drink.  Luckily, we only live around the corner. This place is really low end.  But, the Lincoln Parkers keep coming as evidenced by the relentless line of northbound cabs dropping off and the southbound cabs picking up. So, what's the draw?  Well, the place has obviously gained a reputation as one of those places that's such a dive it makes it fun to go drink at.  Fun, that is, if your a post-college frat boy or sorority girl  from the suburbs or from out-of-state who feels like slumming. And, it's the karaoke.  Yeah, the place has karaoke and there's nothing like watching drunk Young Republicans make complete fools of themselves.  That alone is worth the cover charge and the stamp on the back of your hand which will take three days to wash off. They also serve food, but take a look around and pay close attention to who might be preparing your food.  If you eat here, you deserve whatever ailment befalls you. Though I live so close I could stumble home completely blind drunk from this place, I rarely go there.  Ordering bottled beer solves the shady bartender issue, the bouncer has never hassled me and I really don't care how many teeth people have, fewer makes it more difficult to bite me in a bar brawl.  What really keeps me away is the Thursday through Saturday night crowd.  Not the number of people, but rather the type of people.  Carol's has a 4 o'clock license (open until 5 on Saturday) and by the time last call rolls around most of the patrons have forgotten they've graduated and moved into the real world and have regressed to their glory days on campus.  If that's what I wanted I'd drink in Chicago's Mecca for post-collegiate hijinks - Wrigleyville. My advice is to stay away.  This is not where the cool crowd drinks, it's where the wannabes in khaki pants and oxford shirts go and think they look good because everyone looks like them.",0.9496,0.827,0.115,0.059,0.4607456140350876

Another time I was at Carol's, I went there with some friends, and ended up grabbing a seat at the bar, while they were getting a table.  I sat next to a lovely gentleman named Duane, I think.  I'm not really clear on that.  But what I am clear on is that Duane loved fat chicks.  Loved them.  That's what he said to me anyway.  ""Drex, I gotta tell you man, I loves me a fatty.  In fact, I want to take one home tonight.""  Now, mind you, Duane was drunk.  Really drunk.  How drunk is that, you ask?  Well, apart from the bluntness of the man, he kept falling out of his seat while looking for women, all the while explaining to me his fondness for larger females.  At any rate, his heart was in the right place, so we set about trying to find our Duane a lovely lady to meet.  And meet her he did -- or at least, that's the last I heard from him.  I saw some lady, said, ""I like her -- I think I'd like to talk to her!"", and naturally i encouraged him, and well, off into the sunset he went. There are other stories.  There are always other stories.  The point of the matter is that it's those kinds of stories that are Carol's stock-in-trade.  I don't know how, and I don't know why.  Maybe it's the troughs in the bathroom, maybe it's the ""hot sandwiches"" which you can't help but think ""why the hell would I eat a sandwich at this place?"", maybe it's the ridiculously awesome people who frequent the place.  But there's something about Carol's that's just a boozy little piece of magic on any night of the week.",0.8918,0.864,0.082,0.054,0.6023166023166023

I started a rumor among my friends that she told me one night she is also a CCD teacher.  Not sure if it's true [after a few High Lifes, reality and fantasy can blur a bit], but it's easy to imagine.  Reconcile that with the bedazzled musical note patched onto her short corduroy skirt.  You know she's broken a few hearts at Carol's over the years. Squint through the smoke, and she looks a little like Sarah Jessica Parker's C&W aunt from Tennessee.   The bass player Extrapolate Matt Dillon's character from What About Mary out another 10 - 15 years.  Could be this guy.   The drummer Glad they took down the plexiglass partition they had him behind for a while, even if it means the rest of the band now wears ear plugs and/or hides off to the side of the stage.  The experience just wasn't the same with him blocked off back there.   Also, I dare anyone to eat the $3.00 'Fish' sandwich you can find on the menu.  Let me know how that works out for you.

Sadly, the band plays for tips and drunk people don't seem to care that they do the same Johnny Cash song five times a night and have no problem breaking out the twangy pop without monetary incentive.  As far as the actual bar goes - the crowd kills on Friday and Saturdays. It's fairly quiet until midnight, and gets busier and busier until 1:45 when the place is wall to wall. The great thing about the 2am crowd is that it's pretty diverse.  Beer's expensive for a 'dive.' I recommend going with the pitchers, they're pretty costly at $12, but it beats paying $4/bottle of Bud Light! There's some talk of it becoming too yuppie and straying from it's roots, which I can understand. This was the best kept secret on Clark Street for years. But take heart - the regulars come early and will NEVER abandon Carol's. The main battle with the band is convincing them to relearn some Merle Haggard and Hank Williams.  There are two regular guys over the age of 50 that WILL make you dance with them, so give in early. They're good dancers. Even if you can't dance, they'll make you look like you can.

There is nothing wrong with Carol's itself --- it is just if we go there, it means we are out til 5am and there is always some sort of drama when you have been drink for that long!  I have never gone to Carol's before 1am and I would say around 2am on weekends is when it really starts to pick up.  There is always the house honky-tonk band playing the same songs.  Normally, I am not at all a fan of country, but for some reason, at this place I can't help but get into ""Ring of Fire,"" ""Stand by Your Man"" and all the other classic hits they play.  You will know the words to almost every song.   Carol's Pub hosts one of the most eclectic crowds I have ever seen in Chicago.  Black, while, gay, straight --- you are simply a cowboy at Carol's.  See that old man in the corner?  He WILL ask you to dance and for some reason, at Carol's, it is OK.   Go to Carol's and enjoy feeling like you have stepped into some crazy alternate universe for the night. On your way home stop at the burrito joint across the street to soak up some of the liquor.  Just make sure you have nothing scheduled on your calendar for the next day!",0.9467,0.842,0.112,0.046,0.4180650037792895

2005-12-30,4.0,"This place is a good time.  Especially on Mondays--that's when they serve you pitchers of Bud [I know, I know] for just four dollars.  And I'm not talking about those punk-assed promotional style pitchers.  I'm talking about those Large Marge, Old School, Pizza Hut-style pitchers.  For four bucks.  Now granted, it's a country bar.  But I lived in Texas for eight years so I don't really mind the music that much.  And they also have live bands three or four nights out of the week (who doesn't like live music?).  And best of all, there's Karaoke-night.   If you live in the neighborhood, this place rocks (I live down the street).  And they even have sammiches (though the bartenders hate firing up the grill).  As far as a good time goes, my suggestion is to not go on the weekends--just way too crowded.  Pick a weeknight and grab a half-dozen friends instead.  Oh yeah, and be sure to at least fake like you're having a good time when you're there, because they will boot your ass out if you don't.  No really, my friend Miles got asked to leave for looking bored and annoyed.",0.7224,0.765,0.129,0.106,0.5730158730158731
2005-11-29,4.0,"Carol's = the best place to hear Moondance at 3 a.m., the best place to witness friends making out on the dance floor, the place that makes you crave foamy Bud Lite like you were stranded in the Mohave Desert for 10 days with a broken canteen, the best place to ""hover"" over the toilet seat (for the ladies), the place where hipster culture and neighborhood locals cohabitate like red and blue M&Ms... The band is always rockin', and rumor has it if you write a request on some money and place it on their tip tree up front, they'll play your song.  Sadly, I've only seen them come through on a request one time.  Come Friday night if you want to get a table and down about 12 pitchers.  Come Saturday night if you don't care about sitting down (because you won't find an empty seat in the house), you want to cut a rug and get sloshed like you're at a barn party.  You'll probably end up with more beer on your shoes than you get in your belly.",0.9631,0.785,0.162,0.053,0.3314814814814815
2005-10-28,1.0,Okay. I was here LAST NIGHT for Thursday Karaoke.

This place is by far one of my favorite places to knock down a few PBRs with friends; whether it's for Karaoke night on Thursdays or taking a turn around the dance floor to live music on Friday or Saturday nights, it never disappoints. No need for heels or heavy makeup for this joint - just come as you are. But make sure to check your ego at the door and expect dirty floors, loud country music, cheap beer, and friendly folks.
