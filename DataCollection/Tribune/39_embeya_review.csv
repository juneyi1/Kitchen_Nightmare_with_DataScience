2016-07-05,5.0,"Came for restaurant week. It was the best place so far (we've been to a few other Michelin places too). It is family style, so you get to try all the dishes rather than select. Everything was great, such a variety. Very interesting combinations making experiential flavors. Go for the 4-course offering. The grilled bacon was great. The braised lamb on the main course was interesting mix between the curry and lamb. The dessert - the chocolate brownie with pickled beets (sounded weird) but such a great combo. We didn't do the wine pairing, but picked along the way for the same value, but picked things we liked  Jason was our server. Very knowledgeable about the food, very good in offering advice, and made it a great experience overall. Highly recommend trying this place out for RW. !",0.9899,0.761,0.239,0.0,0.5401666666666667

We liked it so much that  we returned for dinner today to taste the other choices of the menu and I am sorry to say that experience was not good at all.  The food we had (Soft shall crab, Green curry beef, Squid and Scallops) were on the expansive side of the menu but less flavorful, less interesting and was kind of ""Comfort food"" with God knows what flavor. The drinks (cocktails) were very expansive and wasn't worth it. This is a description from their menu of the Punch Drunk for $15: ""citrus peels, palm sugar, brown sugar, coriander, cinnamon, cloves, black peppercorns, pineapple, cognac, white rum, aged rum, bourbon, absinthe, coconut milk, cow's milk, fresh lemon juice"". And when we received it it looked and tasted as a glass of a cheep white wine (without any hints of flavors of the described ingredients) with the chunk of the coconut swimming inside . Very disappointing.  The ambiance was very uncomfortable because their AC was not working and it was very hot in the room.  The service was trying their best under circumstances but was understaffed, very slow and less attentive (though I can't blame them, they were working really hard).  The value for the mediocre food and all the rest components of the dining was REALLY BAD. Now I understand why this restaurant has such contradictory reviews.

At the entrees, the satay chicken was surprisingly good since the description made it sound rather pedestrian and the Kobe steak was very good but the peas it was served with were even better.

He certainly didn't push drinks or try to resupply us often. In fact many of use were seated at the bar beforehand and trying to order drinks when they told us we would be seated soon and to just wait. Well we were seated, but no one came by to take our drinks order for a half hour at least. Our reservation was for 7:30pm. You'd think we'd be able to finish our meal by the close at 11pm.

The grilled market fish with seasonal vegetables is prepared to perfection and offers great value at $32. So does the green papaya salad with freshly grilled thai beef jerky (which is easily my favorite thing on the menu) for $12. Each time, I have been greeted with a warm welcome back, offered the same table and the owners personally tend to our table, often times delivering the food and offering to grab taxi's for us as we are departing.

2016-02-21,2.0,"Meh.  That's how I feel about this place.....and the staff seems to have the same attitude. We arrived a few minutes before our 7:30pm reservation and were told our table would be ready in 10 minutes. Hostess (who I later learned was the owner), pointed at the bar and said there were some empty seats. We walk over and see people have their coats piled on there and they glare at us. We were fine standing anyway but it was annoying to see people hogging seats they weren't even sitting in. We ended up standing around for almost a half our past our reservation time and the night went downhill from there. Our waiter came right away, mumbled some things about the menu and took our drink order. It was loud so we were straining to hear him. Fifteen minutes come by and someone (we think he was a manager) took our appetizer order. Fifteen more minutes go by and the appetizers come out. Our drinks are nowhere to be found. Even our water glasses were empty. We noticed our waiter glance our way with a ""uh oh!"" look on his face, then run over to the bar. I think he forgot to put our drink order in! He did come over to apologize for the wait and took our dinner order.  The cuttlefish pad thai was tasty and had a nice kick, but the salmon tartare was our favorite. It would have been better if we had drinks to go with the dishes. We have our second round of drinks and wait for dinner. No one ever came to clear our dirty dishes or ask if we needed anything else. Dinner finally came but at that point, we weren't excited for the food anymore because the whole experience had been crappy.  We had the duck two ways and while I'm not usually a big duck fan, I loved it. You know what else I would have loved? Not struggling to cut the thick duck breast with a BUTTER KNIFE. I would have asked for a steak knife but as usual, our waiter was MIA. The walleye was good, but I didn't expect it to be fried. I could get fried fish at a bar or fish fry. The menu didn't state how I was cooked and I assumed it would be broiled or something. We would have liked to have asked the waiter more questions about the menu but he was rushed when took our orders. I also wish he would have explained the menu more and suggested how much food to order because we were still hungry. We would have ordered two more appetizers or another tiny entrée to share.  We would have stuck around for dessert and another drink, but we were disappointed and over this place. The owner asked how our experience was and my fiancé was honest. He told her the service was sub par. She apologized and told us they were short staffed because two employees are pregnant blah blah blah. It was weird of her to give us so much personal info about them. Her whole demeanor showed she just didn't care. She gave us her card and said she would like us to come back for a better experience. She may as well have given us a Pokémon card cause a business card means nothing. This restaurant is beautiful but service is awful. At that price point, attentiveness is important. The food was good but there are so many awesome restaurants in the area. This is one to skip over! This was the worst birthday dinner experience I've had.",0.978,0.789,0.12,0.091,0.5565826330532213

About 15 minutes later, my phone vibrates and it's the restaurant calling to confirm whether I'd be able to make the reservation.  I mentioned we were already seated in the dining room.  No drinks have arrived, including water.  Finally water comes and shortly thereafter a glass of prosecco and a whiskey cocktail. At the hour mark, the first course arrives...a few bites each of a very tasty tuna tartare and carpaccio.  The plates are cleared and a front desk person joins to help expedite.  She brings us the 3rd course without the 2nd course.  She apologizes and takes it back, and then promptly brings us the 4th dessert course, which having only had the appetizer we send back.  That's the last time we see her even though we asked her where the second round of drinks were. The second round of drinks finally come and at the 2 hour mark we get the 2nd courses of octopus and crispy bass.   Now things start to get even more messy...literally.  The heretofore absent waitress reappears with a tray of drinks - ours included.  Things hit a snag, or perhaps a crack in the floor, when all the drinks except my whiskey cocktail shower the tables behind us.  She takes it and returns to the bar while another server cleans up the mess off two tables and the slate floor.  Miraculously drinks reappear in 2 minutes vs the 20 minute average, so I hoped for the best mine wasn't full of glass.  Having had no beverage for 30 minutes, I took my chances.  Meanwhile, half the servers are behind us cleaning up the mess and apologizing profusely...except our server.  She's like a ninja dropping off checks and running from tables. Thank god, an amazing young lady who said she was a bartender usually stepped in to salvage the rest of the courses.  She apologized for the service, got us a round of drinks quickly and the next two courses came out in the next 20 minutes.   With tip, the 3 hour evening of chaos was $295 with one round of drinks comped.  The food was amazing, truly.  The service, at least this night with the exception of our bartender savior, was a complete and colossal mess reminiscent of an SNL skit or hidden camera show.  The only positive aspect to the evening is that we were able to remain dry while most of the sticky alcohol soaked couples around us weren't so lucky.",0.973,0.873,0.088,0.04,0.39158090337335627
2016-02-15,2.0,"One of the worst restaurant experiences I have ever had, so bad I was inspired to start yelp reviewing restaurants. TERRIBLE service, terrible drinks, excellent food. Came here Saturday 2/13 for the Valentines Day special, which was a 4 course meal with 8 dishes for $75/person.  After being seated it took 15 minutes to get water. All the tables around us had empty water glasses too. The water guy apologized and said they were short on bus boys, he was very nice. We gave him $5 and he made an obvious effort to refill our glasses for the rest of the night.  The menus were set for valentines day so no decisions needed to be made and our waitress grabbed them without speaking to us, we had to flag her down to let her know we needed one of the dishes modified bc of a food allergy (she forgot about the modification.)  Drinks came maybe 20 minutes later. I ordered a lemon drop, that turned out to be just vodka with warm lemon juice, it was terrible.  When the food finally did come it was amazing, but the courses were spaced out way too long. The entire meal took probably 2 1/2 hours.  Our waitress was rude and unresponsive.Walking by the bathroom I saw her idling around the bar, possibly waiting for drinks- she should have been consoling her tables, everyone in her section was obviously disappointed. She was unapologetic about the obviously poor service up until the check came. She comped our drinks for the night which great, but just throwing an ""I'm sorry"" in here or there throughout the meal would have been easy and made it a much more pleasant dining experience.  The couple next to us had a total of 3 drinks spilled on them, on 2 separate occasions. They also had a different food allergy that was ignored by the same waitress. They had the manager at the table giving out his personal cell phone number by the end of the night.

We choose the 3 courses for $33, option. Our experience falls between the the other RW reviews. My rating is based on the teeny portion sizes and some missteps in the dishes themselves. First the food was good to excellent, with one exception. The plates were meant to share, but were very small as you can see by my pictures. I don't know what I expected flavor-wise, but I expected the flavors to be clearer and brighter. I do hope to go back for a regular dinner soon to get a better idea. Service a bit akimbo, although our main waiter was one that our friends knew so I imagine we got the better end of the deal. The two starters were Cuttlefish Pad Thai and Crab and Green Papaya Salad. They were both excellent, but only the Pad Thai was really shareable. No pictures because I just dug in. The Pad Thai in particular was a surprising delight. The salad did suffer from its small size.  The ""mains"" that followed were not as good, which made me want more of the starters. The Chicken Thigh with Miso Mashed Potatoes was tasty, but not exceptional and the Lamb Yellow Curry (and its weirdly chewy ""naan"") suffered from more fat than meat. The curry was lovely though. The desserts were Roasted Banana with Kaffir-lime caramel and sesame brittle and Cacao nib brownie with hazelnut meringue and smoked chocolate ice cream.

You have the option of choosing between the three course or four course meal, and you get to try everything on the restaurant week menu. Everything was decidedly Thai themed, but with a refreshing twist.

Also split our check between many credit cards without complaint.

The cuttlefish dish is deceptive because the cuttlefish noodles look like ordinary noodles, but nope, it's just cuttlefish in noodle form. - Cuttlefish Noodle Pad Thai - Crab and Green Papaya Salad Main Course - since I'm allergic to curry and do not like lamb, I can't comment on that dish except that my friend liked it. I really enjoyed the fried chicken thigh dish, and the chicken was moist and savory. - Braised lamb - Fried Chicken Thigh Dessert - they were sooooo goooood.

First of all, there is no single dish in the menu (except for the papaya salad) that was worthwhile. The noodles were dried, the Chinese bacon wasn't pairing the trout which barely had flavor, chicken was not flavorous, lamb was just fat and no meat. Even the dessert was just OK. Further, the manu is ""family style"", but they are just single person dishes that had to be involuntarily shared. But not only the food disappointed us, but also the service. It looks like the waiters were in a rush, hitting the table so hard when leaving the plates.  This has been our disappointing experience. I don't know what has happened, but we left the restaurant very sadly and wishing not to go back. PD: I am not the kind of person who writes bad reviews.

However, not only portions are tiny, the time between serving the courses took 30 mins. The course itself would suffice ONE adult person, not an adult men and a woman. We came here around 6:40pm and it took an hour and 40 mins to finish the course. Also after second course (we were still hungry and was eagerly waiting for the main) the waiter mistakenly brought out dessert. Had to wait total 30 mins to receive the main course. For the price it is not worth it. I would expect better service for $95 per person course. We went to potbelly afterwards. Edit: if waiting for 30-40mins(mind you, this is not counting the time we are eating. After we were done with the dishes we waited additional 30 mins for another course to come out) between the course meal is relaxing (especially when the portions are tiny) you are wrong. Also the main dish (the meat) came out cold. The reply also did not address the poor service. The waiter brought dessert when we were waiting for the main course.

Loved the rock shrimp and jerkey specifically. Pork shoulder too fatty but OK. specialty cocktails were well made and not too sweet. The issue is most portions are small for what you pay, particularly the appetizers. Probably better to split an entree as an app as those were bigger and more appropriate to the price.  I would give higher stars, but I was sorely disappointed with service. It was 12 minutes from sitting down until first addressed, and I had to flag a busser to ask about a server. This is completely unacceptable -- keep in mind the two minute rule.  The service didn't improve from there. My drink was empty and the server walked by 12 times. I counted. It was Friday and I was thirsty. Oblivious to the table. I can't stand that. I might as well sit at home, spend 1/10 the money on some take out, and be able to get my own beer from the fridge.  I am noticing a serious lack of service quality in many of these ostensibly ""high end"" places -- maybe just a Chicago thing?

I had the tendron & lime cocktail which was very citrusy and I couldn't taste the young coconut water. I shared the grilled beef jerky appetizer with the bf. This was very delicious. Not so much of a jerky, though. It was very tender slices of beef in a sweet, tangy and spicy sauce. This was my favorite dish. I had the smoked scallops for my entree. This was a mistake. It was a few pieces of scallops hiding in a handful of salad. This dish was ridiculously small. I don't recommend getting this unless it's just as an appetizer. The bf had the hangar steak, which he enjoyed. It was a large portion and was cooked nicely. Some other people at my table ordered the gigantic ribeye for two. This was the thickest steak I've ever seen. They slice and plate it at the side of the table. Unfortunately, both orders were undercooked. The couples ended up eating around the rare parts. I would stick to the hangar steak. None of us were interested in the dessert options.  The bill was a bit of a mess. They ended up accidentally charging one couple's credit card like 90% of the bill. Good thing the couple caught that mistake as they were leaving. I also threw in an extra 20 dollar bill to cover whatever small amount we were short after splitting the bill. They charged all our credit cards and took the cash without returning with the change. I would have left the change anyway on top of the 20% tip we already left, but wth?

The Bib Salad, while delicious, was just a green salad. I really appreciated the menu - clear and easy to read and understand.  It stresses me out when the menu is multiple pages as all the different choices can be overwhelming.  Embeya has a nice selection of lemonades and ice teas.  We tried two with the winner being the Jasmine Peach Lemonade!   We ordered 4 entrees to split between the 5 of us.  The Smoked Scallop was cooked perfectly although on the bite I had (yes, bite.  There was only 1 and 1/2 scallops in this dish) was crunchy with sand.  This dish is topped with crunchy walnuts which everyone loved. We also tried the Seafood Stew, Udon Noodles and Lamb Meatballs.  The clear favorite seemed to be the Lamb  The Stew and Noodles were nice but just nice.  There was nothing special about these dishes.

You can't get any better than this.  I originally made a 6:30 pm reservation for a party of 14 at Bin36.  I recently discovered Bin36 had moved from Dearborn Street to its new location on Jefferson, which also happens to be next door to Embeya.  As I walked toward Bin36, something about the exterior of Embeya caught my attention, but I didn't stop or go inside.  When I checked into Bin36's hostess station, I didn't care for the new location.  I couldn't quite put my finger on it, but the vibe was off-putting and the restaurant seemed very different  than their previous location.  I shared my views with the hostess, but asked to hold my table while I ran an errand.  I immediately when to check out Embeya.  From the moment I walked in the door,  I was greeted at the hostess desk by Komal, a very friendly and welcoming lady. (Update: I just learned today, she and her husband are the co-owners, which takes my experience with this establishment up another notch).  I took a look at the menu and asked very specific questions about the cocktail, wine and dinner offerings.  She was very courteous, patient and addressed each of my questions.  It was 6:15 pm and Embeya was able to accommodate our group for a 6:30 pm reservation.  I cancelled Bin36 and sent an email to my group letting them knew we changed restaurant locations.  I was nervous about changing restaurants so abruptly because there were European guests in my party with very particular tastes.  Yet, I went with my gut and stuck to the new plan.   While I waited for my group to arrive, I ordered the 'Tendron & Lime' cocktail. made with fresh coconut milk, lime and vodka...very refreshing.  When my group arrived, we were promptly seated by our server, ""Will"", who was amazing the entire evening.  We decided to order from the tasting menu.  We were served a Seafood Hot Pot w/Mussels, Pork Belly, Beef Jerky, Lamb Tenderloin, Seared Tuna, Charred Baby Carrots, Fried Walleye (the HIT of the evening!), followed by a chocolate cake-like dessert with Mocha Ice Cream ball, embellished with a cookie-like crumble with a hint of cayenne - it was delicious.  We also had a dessert which tasted like a really lightened version of cheesecake which was creamy, lightly sweet with a hit of basil, which was very unexpected.  I wish I could provide a detailed description of the food and flavors, but I wouldn't be able to do it justice.  I say, just try it for yourself and you decide.  It is quite a remarkable experience.  On another note, the ambience and vibe was exactly what I was looking for. As far as my group, everyone raved about the menu and I was extremely happy I chose Embeya.  Nevertheless, it was a wonderful dining  experience.",0.9966,0.822,0.146,0.032,0.5684090909090909

It's definitely a good place to go if you're looking for a relax night out.,0.9766,0.76,0.221,0.019,0.4906060606060606

I've had papaya salad all over the world and LOVE it. (I have Laotian, Thai & Hmong friends that make it as well) Embeya's version was by-far, my favorite version -PERIOD. The crispy chicken and the duck were both very flavorful & succulent. It was a good thing we had the papaya salad to offset/complement the flavors.

My personal favorites: the seared tuna, poached halibut, smoked scallops, and the feature this weekend of crispy walleye with ginger eggplant was fantastic!  The desserts are also fun and creative.

I had dinner here in April 2014, and was blown away by the choices, taste, and presentation. It was by far one of the best Asian Fusion restaurants in Chicago. Not only were the menu choices less appealing, but ingredients, spices, and seasoning used were plain off.  We ordered: Squid app - decent, nothing special Chicken entree - seasoning was strange, didn't mix well, and taste was bland. Chicken had plenty of tendon in it. Also, seasoning didn't soak into the chicken. presentation for this and squid was nice. Udon entree - sad and way over-priced. It was just a few skimpy pieces of veggies, hard tofu squares, and udon. I could've made this dish for $1, adding some salt and pepper.  I think it's safe to say, i won't be returning unless the old chef comes back, or hire a new one.  Warning: the menu on their website is the OLD menu. Many dishes have been replaced in the new one i saw last night.",-0.1921,0.845,0.066,0.089,0.5115129123749813

Both were great, though my favorite by far was the seared tuna. The sear on it was perfect and the quality of tuna was great. The papaya salad was refreshing with a nice little bit of heat on the finish.  We then moved to a mid plate of the soft shell crab. My wife is from Maryland and picky with crab. She loved it and was very impressed.  For entrees, she got the ribeye and I got the duck. The duck was paired with a nice pea puree. The duck was cooked perfectly and paired well with the peas. Her steak looked amazing and she was very happy with it. The cocktail list and wine list were very nice and showed a nice selection. The wine list offered many eclectic and special wines. Our service was perfect. The gentleman who waited on us did a great job and made us feel very welcome. He was very attentive and there seemed to be little wait for everything we ordered.

2015-05-21,1.0,Honest review: i saw this on check please thats why i came. The ambiance is really beautiful really romantic wish there were more chandeliers. Service was alright not the best service not the worst. She would be gone for a while and i saw her at the bar i dont like seeing staff chatting with coworkers or doing nothing at the bar should be tryna make the customers feel more welcomed. Food was good not great like the only standouts were the pork belly and the ganache dessert. Because of that im rating 1 star cause i wouldnt come back wasnt worth the expensive price. I dont mind paying alot just it has to be amaizing.All in all just two dished blew me away pork belly and ganache i dont give restaurants a second chance it should be perfect every time  Papaya salad: this was the only dish with alot of food. Its like spaghetti. this dish is really good theres a lot of texture everything is really crunchy. This dish is spicy so if u do not like heat dont order its not overwhelming its perfect. This dish was really acidic wish there was something sweet added to make it not that sour maybe candied walnuts like in the scallop dish. Only problem was there was way to much mint like it wouldnt be a problem if it was just a little bit but there was alot of it kinda ruined the dish would order again though Soft shell crab: this was my least favorite part of the meal. The crab is fresh so no weird funky taste to it. Its not supper greasy really crunchy. But the sauce did nothing for me u can taste the ginger but there was no wow factor wish it had a different sauce.  Crispy pork belly: this was the best dish of the night. The pork belly was supper crispy supper tender didnt need a knife perfect seasoning was sublime supper rich. When i saw the strawberries i was like wtf but it was the perfect combination i love sweet and salty. The puree was also really delicious  really enhanced the pork belly wasnt overpowering i would have ordered it twice i would just come back here for this dish. Smoked scallop: the texture of the scallops were perfect amaizing sear on the outside perfectly cooked so u didnt need a knife to cut it. I loved the salad it was amazing really fresh and crunchy the walnuts were the best part of the dish! Wish there were more walnuts the sauce was good not great no wow factor  Roasted lobster: i didnt like the dish there was a good amount of lobster but it was overcooked so it was chewy it had a good taste to it. I like the leaks i think they tasted really good. I didnt like the sauce i dont think it added anything to the dish at all. For the price it should have been the best part of the meal it wasnt Yuzu semifreddo: this was like a strawberry short cake. The cake was really good perfect texture not dry at all wish there was more only like a lit bit i liked the addition of the strawberries added some tartness and sweetness. The ice cream was really interesting i didnt really like it idk if it was the yuzu but i just didnt like it  Ganache: this was the best part of the meal it was a home run a must order. Its like a gourmet  smore. Theres marshmallows on top and there toasted perfectly not to burned. Then there more fluff on the bottom. The cracker crumbs were really delicious i just wish they were sprinkled on top not on the plate i dont like when crumbs and powders are on the side.  They said it was dark chocolate which i hate but i loved it it was so rich best dessert i ever had. The ice cream was to die for not over turned so good wish there was more of it theres only a little bit.,0.9977,0.647,0.216,0.136,0.6154761904761903

These friends have great taste, so we weren't worried, but I certainly didn't expect my socks to be blown off like they were. Food, service and atmosphere were all off the charts. I can't remember everything we ate because we dropped some serious cash here, but we had a ton of food. Pork belly is always a pleaser and this was no exception. I' not a fish eater, but we got a gigantic whole fried sole and it was delicious, the surprise of the night was the eggplant. In a meal full of meat, I was shocked that my favorite dish was the eggplant. I asked how they prepared it and I'm told it's grilled, then baked, then tossed in a red pepper and secret somethingorother marinade.

This was my second time at Embeya, and while I personally did not enjoy my experience this time as much as my first, objectively, this was a very well-done menu.  Green papaya salad: I started with the green papaya salad, which I thoroughly enjoyed when I first came during Restaurant Week. The first few bites were every bit as good as the first time I had it; however, as I had more, I found the vinegar a bit overwhelming.  Fried squid: This was my favorite item of the night. The batter was extremely light and done very well. Combined with the yogurt sauce and diced pears, this was absolutely on point in balancing the different flavors.  Duck: While I thought the dish was very interesting, I wasn't a fan of the curry sauce that it came with. The duck itself with the hoisin sauce was very tender and flavorful, and I ended up eating that by itself.  We also got the greek yogurt panna cotta on the house. The matcha crackers were a nice crunch to the otherwise smooth texture of the panna cotta, and I liked the burst of sweetness from the grapes as well as the refreshing flavors the ice cream brought. Overall, the spring menu presented a very cool flavor profile; most of the items on the menu were infused with mint in some way. While I personally am not a fan of mint infused foods, I really liked complexity of each dish and am quite excited to see what else Embeya has in store.",0.9819,0.837,0.137,0.026,0.5036666666666668

2015-04-11,4.0,"A large party, we came here for a friend's birthday the Friday before it was revealed that Chef Thai Dang had been fired.  If he prepared our food the night our party was there, I'd say it was a mistake.  From start to finish, the food was quite good.  Our reservation for a party of 10 @ 9PM was seated promptly at the King's table and drink orders were taken.  Several rounds were ordered of the following cocktails:  Tendril and Lime, Winter Thyme, and Oxford Comma.  Our party found the drinks strong and, judging by our bill, difficult to have just one!  Wine was ordered too, and their list is quite extensive, but I can't readily recall what was ordered. Food items ran the gamut, as some of our party are vegans or otherwise vegetarian-oriented.  Standouts:  marinated mango:  sour, yet alternatively sweet and spicy in that good Thai way.  The short rib and garlic chicken were also successes; both were tender and juicy, with meat that fell easily from the bone.  The sauces that accompanied both dishes was quite good too.  We ordered all of the sides:  Brussels sprouts, broccoli, and wild mushrooms, and found the former two to be the most tasty and delicious of the three.  In fact, they were so delicious we ordered several rounds of broccoli and Brussels sprouts.  They were great!  Also ordered were the smoked bay scallop, cuttlefish, and mussels, which were proclaimed as delicious by those in our party that ordered.  I'm not a seafood guy, so I'll move on. In all, Embeya was a good time.  Some have commented on the service, proclaim it slow, and unfortunately I'm unable to comment on it.  We had a late reservation and enjoyed ourselves so much that we stayed until they turned the lights up and began to vacuum other parts of the dining area.  If we were ever wondering where our server was, it was usually when a cocktail glass was empty.  That said, the food was delicious.",0.9971,0.771,0.201,0.029,0.5148109243697478

2015-03-23,1.0,"0/5 WORST HOSPITALITY IN THE CITY. #tryhards #thirsty So, I'm not an avid Yelper, so for what it's worth, I'm so upset with my experience at Embeya that I'm feeling compelled to write a review. I will also preface this review with letting you know that I've been in the service industry in high end dining for 10 years.  1. The maitre d there is rude and arrogant and for no reason. This place is a joke. I booked a reservation on Open Table and was unaware of the fine print which charges you $25 per head if you don't cancel within 24 hours and your credit card is already on file.  I had a party of 6, which means they were going to charge me $150 to cancel. The maitre d (her name started with an S) made it very clear that they were going implement the $150 fee no matter what and that my only option was to push out my reservation and that if I tried to cancel the postponed reservation that they would still get their money. She even said that many guests feel screwed over by them but come and end up having a good time anyways. Right...because so many people like being forced to eat somewhere. I get that this ""policy"" is in place, but after a very heated and uncomfortable conversation on the phone, I felt like I was being EXTORTED so that they could make a quick buck.  I certainly didn't feel welcome, which is a great way to feel as a guest (I mean hostage) at a restaurant.  I can understand a policy like this being enforced for a large group, private party room, a place where it takes weeks to get a rezo, or if it were a ticketed experience (i.e. NEXT, The Aviary, Alinea). I also know that at some point you should cut your losses, which they didn't. 2. There's a reason it was so easy to book here to begin with, and why they don't care about hospitality and just dollars in the till. They absolutely needed my $150 to keep their expensive lighting on. We showed for our reservation, in lieu of the awful customer experience we'd had so far. And it makes perfect sense as to why they were FIGHTING me for my money. At 9pm on a Saturday night, in the best culinary zip code in the city...yeah it was a GHOST TOWN. The bar looked like it had about 40 seats, not a single person sitting there. Huge dining area, looked about 10% of the tables were sat. Apparently everyone in town already knew what I didn't know, and it's that this place is over-rated.  Let's also highlight that the maitre d and hostess were RUDE to my party when we got there and they sat us close enough to the hostess stand where we could see them looking over our table, repeatedly, and whispering to one another. And these people work in this business? She then pulled our server aside and whispered something to him (in front of us) and then he came over and was pretty cold.  3. We ordered a round of drinks and left. One of my friends got this elaborate cocktail that they seemed pretty proud of, it was o.k. Based on the comments from seasoned reviewers here, the food was just the same. Which is a shame, because it's a beautiful restaurant, in a great location. Lipstick on a pig... My advice. Get new staff to run the front of the house. These people clearly don't understand the meaning of hospitality. We would've gladly made a reservation for a different night (on our own, not by force), as many of us were excited to try it and are constantly on the restaurant ""scene"" in Chicago. Now, none of us will ever come back because of the garbage experience we had. In addition, if you're going to be arrogant, have the product and the thriving business to back it up. If your product is mediocre and your service sucks, you're going to fail...which clearly, they're doing a fine job of already because clearly no one wants to go here. They drove out $800 in future business (that's what we spent at dinner at Japoinais that evening) because we would've gladly come back had we not had the experience we did. Japonais was amazing, go there instead. In fact, there are 7,000 restaurants in Chicago, go anywhere else instead. You'll have a better time.",0.9962,0.76,0.155,0.084,0.5669475881261596
2015-03-23,2.0,"I came here thinking this place would be comparable to Sunda, another Asian fusion restaurant not too far away, but it was a disappointment.  Reason why I'm giving 2 stars:  1) Friendly but poor service. Our orders came out at different timings. Some appetizers were missed and some were duplicated. When we got our bill, there were unsurprisingly a number of mistakes causing us to be overcharged. Fortunately, we had seen this coming and had the problem fixed.   2) Hit or miss dishes in terms of taste. I don't have a light palate but even for me, a number of the orders were far too salty. The noodles entree for example had tremendous potential, but I had to mix it up with rice to tame the flavors. Same story with the mushroom side.  The restaurant also needs to rethink its portioning. Some dishes were generously portioned (e.g. green papaya salad) while others were the equivalent of 2-3 mouthfuls (e.g. the quail).  The ambiance is a redeeming quality. However, at the prices I'm paying, I'd expect much more on all fronts.",-0.7964,0.824,0.072,0.104,0.5495098039215688

As for the overall food - it was better than expected. Albeit we went all out and ordered the majority of the menu, along with some of the fanciest wines (in which the manager tried to actually downsell is, which was interesting), I was actually impressed. What foods were good: - Noodles with Scallops - Prawns with heads  - Mushrooms - Broccoli - Brussel Sprouts - Ice cream sundae (although it was super small) What was not good: - Lobster - not much taste to it - Sticky rice - really no taste (but then again it's just sticky) - Fried rice - a little garlic-y, but very dry - Mussels - decent, but not the best with coconut  Overall, I'd rate this place a 4.2. To really enjoy the meal, you have to order an appetizer with a main entree and some really good wine. The waiter was friendly - at some times he was extremely slow while the restaurant was slow, but no biggie. The door lady really helped out hailing a taxi on our way out. The manager was friendly letting us know that perhaps we should downgrade our wine (perhaps he was trying to just get us to buy both bottles)?

2015-03-10,3.0,"Came here for restaurant week with a party of 4 and went with the 3 course because I am not a huge fan of duck and prawns, which is included in the optional course for 11$ more. Everything came family style, but portions are pretty small so you might need to order from the regular menu as well. First course--the cuttlefish and papaya was amazing. The cuttlefish was prepared perfectly with just the right amount of flavor.  Main course--the braised spare rib was just okay IMO. I definitely had better and honestly was not too fond of this entree. The seafood stew reminded me of the coconut curry dishes you get at a Thai restaurant. This was really good and probably the best entree here, but again the portions were pretty small for 4 people. Taste exactly the same as my favorite Thai restaurant, except there you get a lot more for a good price. The caulifower with roasted mushrooms was good as well. They served everything with a side order of sticky rice, which was nothing special. Again, the portion of rice was so little that we were still hungry. We decided to order an extra noodle dish with scallops from the menu and it was very flavorful for the most part. However, it was just a bit too salty for my liking. Lastly, the dessert was a nice compliment to end the dinner.  Overall, this place was good and I probably would come back in the future to try more stuff from their regular menu. My experience with restaurant week here was okay for the most part. The service was okay and we felt we were waiting for a long time for some of our food to come.",0.9978,0.723,0.251,0.026,0.48766639864200845
2015-03-07,5.0,"I haven't taken the time to write a review in some time, but our experience at Embeya deserves the effort.  My wife and I are super picky about food and restaurants, and everything about our experience at Embeya simply blew our collective minds.  The service was impeccable.  The waiter consistently steered us to less expensive wine options that he felt were better suited to the cuisine.  Rather than a Burgundy as we intended, suggested an outstanding Willamette pinot from Cristom that had the perfect balance of earth and fruit.  He also wisely steered us to the chef's tasting menu which seemed to entail the chef sending out a bunch of dishes that he likes, most of which I did not recall seeing on the menu (and perhaps they should be because the dishes were amazing!). Some of the highlights of our meal were the sliced octopus served in some sort of foam, the fried sweetbreads, the roasted quail, the Brussels sprouts, the short rib, and the pork chop.  Even the vegetable sides were amazing including the broccoli and the mushrooms.  I simply cannot express enough that every single part of the evening exceeded our expectations.  The flavors of the food simply blew our collective minds and I highly, highly recommend this restaurant.  I am disappointed that it took us this long to visit this establishment and I wish that it received more credit that I believe it currently receives as one of the best restaurants in the city.

The music playing was the right volume and soothing.  Not loud where we could not have a conversation.   We ordered the green papaya salad, the octopus, and the carmelized duck.  The papaya salad is a must.  Delicious.  Refreshing and a little spicy, I loved it, the portion was also quite large.  I also liked the octopus, it was different than any other octopus I've had because of the emulsion it was served in but also the spice from the jalapeños.  The caramelized duck was a big miss for me.  I was quite bland, the taro and the duck.  We picked at it and left the rest.  I had the Duke of Earl to drink and my friend had the Tendron and Lime which I also tried.  I liked both but I personally prefer a stronger drink.  These were refreshing but not much alcohol.  All in all I really enjoyed it and would go back to try more dishes.",0.9839,0.823,0.168,0.009,0.5889047619047619

Reservations were made by my boyfriend for my birthday which happens to fall on Valentine's Day. We both were all gussied up and ready to enjoy some delicious Thai fusion food. However, much to our chagrin we were met with a pre-planned chef's menu. We were not warned about this, otherwise we wouldn't have gone.  The waiter explained that no substitutes could be made and the a la carte menu was not an option. As you can imagine, I was irritated. The couple next to me had the similar complaints.  I will say this, the ribs and the prawns were divine. I have no doubts that the chef is phenomenal however, someone from the restaurant should've informed their clientele that they were going to be forced to eat food they otherwise might not have ordered.

2015-02-16,4.0,"Food =5 Service = 3  Overall = 3.5 really We came here for our 1st ever Valentine's day dinner. The fact they served elevated south east Asian food was the draw as I am a huge fan that frequented many New York City Thai, Malaysian, Singapore, Vietnamese, and Filipino spots.  As a 1st timer at Embeya, we were a bit confused by the service experience. We had just seated for 5 min, and the 1st courses arrived already. We hadn't ordered drinks yet. No one explained how dinner was set up. We were not sure if the menu was setup for use to choose between options or if they give you everything. We figured there was a mistake, as the waiter came by and picked up both 1st courses from our table without saying anything. No, we didn't touch the food but we contemplated if we were supposed to. We put in our drink orders. After some time, the 2nd course of food arrived! Um... we didn't really get our 1st course yet. We told this to the person who served the food, who was confused and promptly took it back. Another 1 minute passes by and another person brings out another set of 2nd courses again to us. Now I am annoyed. the couple sitting next to us observed the whole thing and they started joking to us that ""man they just want to feed you."" I almost thought they were going to serve us dessert next and scurry us out.  Finally after some time, our 1st courses arrive. I had to confirm with the waiter that we were getting everything on the menu.  Papaya salad - beef jerky was unique take on this salad for me. I have had many Thai and Vietnamese versions before. this was okay, I wanted it to be more spicy. Smoked scallops - taste wise, this was great. the flavors were certainly elevated and pomelo had a nice sweet/savory bite to it. 1 gripe was that there was a lack of consistency in the amount of food. remembering how the 1st courses mistakenly came out earlier....the portion looked decent there. however, when we finally got our 1st courses, there were only 2 small pieces of scallops in the whole dish. The bf also looked at other tables. we felt our portion was off. maybe the server brought it to us too soon while the plate was being assembled because even the papaya salad was presented differently in other tables. We could have said something to the wait staff but maybe we both didn't want to kill the mood or feel rude. Or maybe we didn't want to disrupt the order of food again by sending it back. Nevertheless, I was a bit concerned about how the rest of the meal would go. the rest of the meal was fine: 2nd courses: the king crab was delicious and I am big fan of head-on prawns.   3rd course: the short rib was fall-of-the-bone phenomenal. The rib-eye was a bit too burnt for me but tasty in other parts. I wasn't sure if the waiter was supposed to ask about allergies or how well we wanted the steak. Thankfully I don't have major allergies. The garlic fried rice was a nice addition and not overpowering. 4th course: the ice cream set was a clear winner over the peanut butter chocolate mousse which was too rich for me. I was slightly put off with the waiter dropping of the check in the middle of dessert.    The night ended okay. Besides the off-putting impersonal service, food was pretty good with high quality ingredients.",0.9946,0.833,0.121,0.046,0.4886188605633051

2015-02-12,4.0,"I came here with two friends for Chicago Restaurant Week and for the most part, Embeya impressed. The atmosphere was sophisticated and the decor was so beautiful (great date lighting - not too dark, not too bright). The service was friendly, but not perfect. And the food was admittedly really great fusion. We had the green papaya salad and the cuttlefish for apps (everything was served family-style) and both were really fun to eat, with lots of interesting flavors and textures. I feel like the beef jerky got lost a bit in the salad though, but the cuttlefish was really delicious. We opted for the flash-fried prawns and duck salad next - both were great, but the first time our prawns came out, they were very undercooked (like the inside part was still clear). The waitress got us a new serving of prawns, but she didn't seem convinced that they were undercooked, which was a little disappointing. The duck salad was delicious though with a delightful mix of textures and flavors and once the prawns came back thoroughly cooked, they were great as well. I especially loved the sauce. We had cauliflower, spare ribs (braised with shallots) and seafood stew for our entrees and to be honest, I feel like this was the most underwhelming course. The cauliflower was good but I felt like I could've just tossed it together in my kitchen given some wild mushrooms. The seafood stew tasted a lot like a curry dish and there weren't really any other flavors present. The braised ribs were probably my favorite, as the meat fell right off the bone. The sticky rice I also felt was super impractical to have because we almost knocked the dish over a few times trying to get rice out. Dessert was amazing - ice cream was perfectly creamy and I loved the jackfruit accompaniment. The mousse was so good as well - not too sweet, but perfectly chocolate-y as well. Overall, I'd say it was worth a visit, but there were definitely hiccups in the dishes and the service. We had to wait 20-30 minutes for our main course, which made our dinner last over 2 hours. But it's all good - Embeya does serve up some really delicious fusion.",0.9991,0.669,0.295,0.036,0.5823253543841779

The fried taro was so good - and I'm normally not the biggest fan of taro.  Coconut/taro ice cream (dessert): This ice cream was so creamy and smooth, with the most amazing, delicate, creamy flavors.  Unfortunately, our prawns came out severely undercooked. I was really disappointed by the service when it came to our complaints about the food; I definitely felt as though the waitress was humoring us rather than taking our concerns seriously (that's what happens, I guess, when you're the youngest person in the restaurant).

2015-02-07,4.0,"Much thanks for Restaurant Week... otherwise I would never really stumble into fancy places like Embeya. Not because it's pricy or anything, I'm just more into sloppy soul food plates that are filling more than artsy, yet tasty pairings. But once or so a year, I clean up the beard, sport the wing tips, and put on some smell good to engage in some ""grown up"" activities. My quota was filled here this year.  A grade school friend of mine featured Embeya on a Chicago favorite dining show called Check Please (Lulu R.) so that aided in me coming here. Inside is very sophisticated and modern. Depending on where you sit you can see in the kitchen and from where I sat my eyes always caught the display over the bar.  Beautiful crafted partitions box out the space but it's still very open and lively.  My visit lead me to a four course meal. There was cuttlefish, green papaya, head-on prawns, caramelized duck, braised spare ribs, seafood stew, cauliflower, sticky rice, peanut mousse, and an ice cream sundae. Honestly everything was good but if I had to recommend just one get the seafood stew. It has mussels, clams, lobster, and sea bass in a creamy sauce that was everything to me in that moment. The biggest disappointment came to the table in the form of spare ribs. There was just no flavor whatsoever. I don't really know how to begin to review fancy foods but I understand the dishes and can appreciate them. You can taste the idea and technique moreso than just your everyday plate of food.  I'm a big guy/eater so it's safe and honest to say I still left hungry. Much thanks to the leftover omelette and hash browns in my fridge that greeted me when I got home. Be prepared to pay, 6 of us with a conservative 2 drinks, ran a ballpark $500 and that's restaurant week deal.  Do get yourself a seasonal cocktail. If they have the Snapdragon it's recommended. It has tequila which I prefer and there is chile in it for a lingering spicy punch that is somewhat playful.  Embeya isn't food for the masses and I'm thankful I can afford outings like this while many can't even if I did come during restaurant week. There is also a Simple Sunday discount to look into. The food is thoughtful and elegant...but it's my omelette that I always come back home to.

The seafood stew has shrimp, clams, mussels in a creamy white sauce made with coconut, lime, and scallions. I repeat-Damn Good Stew!            My dessert was a massive fail.

It remained that way. Hmm, should have walked out of it at that moment... Ordered 3 appetizers and one main to share between me and my husband. Nothing memorable. Lamb shank was okay. Tiny portions! Had to order another main. Noodles -- way too salty and left me extremely thirsty for the rest of the night. Husband got two cocktails -- not too bad.   Bill amounted to $177, ouch!!! I never complain about dinner bill but this one I have to. Simply outrageus for what they gave us. The food quality wouldn't even justify a bill of $77.  Walked past it yesterday evening around 7pm (after an extremely pleasant meal at the girl and the goat) and this place was entirely empty. Grinned at the sight.

Ordered the garlic chicken, lamb shank, pork chop, and noodles with scallops. The garlic chicken was best by far-- crispy chicken skin with juicy meat, topped with fried scallions. Yum yum. The lamb shank was flavorless. The noodles were too salry. The pork chop was just mediocre... My friends liked it though.  Finished with the cream puff-- meh. That's all I have to say. Oh wait, no, when they brought out the cream puffs, they borrowed my friend's fork to cut into it, then walked off with his fork, and didn't bring a replacement. I thought it was pretty funny but he was irked. I would be too.  Oh, and this is more of an Asian fusion restaurant than Vietnamese fusion...

Don't be fooled, the papaya is sliced really thin so it's essentially a noodles dish. The sauce was tangy and sweet, really complements the papaya. My friend also ordered the eggplant confit with coconut cream. The coconut cream was actually a foam mousse, and was light, while the eggplant was cooked thoroughly and flavored well. My friend and I also shared the Seared Tofu Entree.  The portions are fairly large, unlike what our waiter implied.

I really don't get the green papaya salad, it lacked flavor and the stiff texture was somewhat off putting. I've had much better versions in California. Octopus was very delicious. Sea bass was bland. Noodles tasted pretty decent, but I wasn't crazy about the strange texture. They are sticky and slippery at the same time. Fried rice was surprisingly good, although it didn't come out until we basically finished eating.

2014-10-15,4.0,"A surprisingly strong ""foodie"" weekend for me in Chi Town. Had a craving for some Asian fusion style restaurant and I am pretty skeptical generally speaking for this front in the mid west. After a bit of searching this spot popped up in my yelp search and seeing the positive reviews I decided to book a reservation on opentable. This joint is amidst a bunch of other fancy restaurants in the vicinity including Blackbird, etc. The interior is well done and the definition of a classy affair. The service was impeccable and they immediately seated us. The menu is simple and they are trying to bring flavors of Asian cuisine. I would hope that they change up their menu often which im not sure. After perusing the menu we decided to order the cocktails including the Tendron and Lime along with one other cocktail. They were both delicious so props to them on this front. I just wish they would have more variety than what they just listed. After perusing the menu list, we decided to order the Papaya Salad, Mussels, Garlic Chicken, and Lobster. Now... I think the definition of what is family style and ""large"" vs not plates was a bit skewed on the waiters suggestion. It was a ton of food but they said it was common that most ppl individually order a small plate and a large plate?  Maybe I just suck at eating? Anyway. The Papaya salad was delish and refreshing to eat. Bold use of fish sauce but great execution. The Mussels were delicious and you MUST order with sticky rice. How else can you eat up all the delicious curry? The lobster was good also and they did a great job of making the lobster easy to eat. Good flavoring on it. The Chicken was interesting and it took me a while to figure out that it was just really ""classic"" simple and was well executed. You could see that the meat was tender and that the simple taste of it was hard to execute.  A great joint and somewhere I will come back to especially if new items come up on the menu.",0.9955,0.811,0.167,0.022,0.5796017667968889

2014-10-05,2.0,"Came here with a large group for a friend's birthday and ordered from the Prix Fixe menu. Overall, the experience was subpar at best. Food was mostly forgettable. The only dish I really enjoyed was the Mussels, however, the family style portions were so inadequate that I was able to eat only a few bites. Other dishes included spring rolls, some kind of papaya noodle, chicken, scallops, and rabbit--none were necessarily bad, just flavor profiles were lacking and portions were disappointing. We were, however, provided several large bowls of sticky rice which allowed me to satisfy my growling stomach in between courses. The dessert was probably the highlight of the evening. The cream puff was actually delicious! Service started out great but quickly fell flat. I began the evening with a glass of wine at the bar before the rest of the party arrived. Once we sat, our host was very accommodating to my pseudo-vegetarian request, which I was incredibly grateful for. But as the night went on it was difficult to miss the clear annoyance represented by the staff. Halfway through the meal, I ordered another glass of the same wine I had been enjoying. The server, in a very insulting manner, informed me that they were out of the wine I had requested and I couldn't have been drinking it. I was almost speechless to his response but managed to explain that I ordered from the bartender. He eventually brought back a glass of wine and replied ""this is what the bartender gave you"", it was as if he was intentionally trying to make me feel stupid. I understand large parties aren't always ideal, but the rude and pretentious attitude was unnecessary. The value was probably the biggest disappointment of the evening. The family style portions were just too small for everyone to share and, even if there was enough to go around, the flavors were mediocre and unimpressive. Once I received my check I was surprised to see the wine they had served me was significantly more money than the wine I had ordered, and I was shocked to see an added gratuity of 22%! I expect that 18% - 20% is customary, but there was no way the service was worth 22%! Bottom line, I left Embeya unsatisfied and the price is not worth it.

Green Papaya Salad: Great dish!  Perfectly balanced. Confit Eggplant w sweetbreads:  I liked this a fair bit but my wife felt that the amount of coconut foam was overwhelming for the dish. Heirloom Tomato Salad: What can I say, who doesn't love heirloom tomatoes?  I don't see it on their website so perhaps it was a daily addition. Noodles w Scallops:  These were stir fried udon and were very mushy.  Would have preferred if the noodles were cooked less.  The scallops were done well though. Octupus:  Cooked great and very balanced. Rabbit Leg: This was described as a cumin curry.  The cumin was very faint and we would have preferred if it was a bit stronger.  The dish was good - it just didn't resonate well with me.  It just wasn't... ""asian"" enough for me. Fried Rice: This was amazing and a great simple side.  I would have eaten more of this if I could. Overall, the meal started great but the two entrees were a bit disappointing.  I would give 3.5* if I could, but feel that rounding up to 4* means that I would probably go again, and I have to be honest that I wouldn't.

You cannot not love it Next in line were the Garlic Chicken and Rabbit Leg, yummmmm. One consistent theme across all three dishes was the broth that made every bite worthwhile. The chef had clearly given it a thought. About the service: We had wanted some leftovers to be packed and due to some confusion, our server thought the leftovers were thrown. to compensate, he immediately offered dessert on the house. That's called service. Even on our way out, the hostess came forward to ask about our experience. None of the restaurants we have been to have ever done given this kind of service.

I was traveling with family, and we had a reservation after finding the restaurant highly recommended on Eater, which never does me wrong. When we arrived the restaurant was almost completely empty. We learned that a large group traveling from NYC had reserved almost the entire restaurant then backed out at the last minute. This meant we had the A team just about all to ourselves. Our waiter was extremely professional without being overly formal, and he helped with solid recommendations. I ordered the quail appetizer. This was delicious and a total explosion of flavor. The dish added lime juice to dehydrated lime powder with spices. It was intense but delicious. The highlight of the meal however was the turbot. It was cooked as a whole fish and was cut and served next to our table. The fish was cooked to the perfect temperature. It was sweet and tender with a crispy skin.  Although I'm not an avid white wine drinker, our waiter told us that they have the most extensive riesling selection in the country. I can't confirm this, but given the length of this list it certainly seems plausible. We had a dry riesling from Alsace that perfectly complimented our food. Yet another good recommendation. To make the meal even more memorable, as we were nearing the end of our entrees Rev. Al Sharpton sat two tables down from us.

2014-06-22,4.0,"I agree that Asian Fusion here is not just some watered down version of Asian and Western flavors that fail to showcase either side. I mean really, kudos to an upscale Western restaurant that's not afraid to feature fish sauce! I think they really do highlight and mesh two worlds together in a way that does both justice here. Papaya salad: SO refreshing and crunchy with a bit of heat. A great summer dish or one to balance out some heavier stuff.  Sweet breads: If you hate sweat breads, this would be the dish to change your mind. I love random animal parts for their unique flavor, and I was surprised (almost disappointed) that the sweatbreads tasted like chicken, but creamier! Great dish. The garnishes (black garlic, roasted cauliflower, a fish sauced based dressing), fresh Southeast Asian herbs made for a very balanced summery bite. Mussels: Really flavorful broth. Very Asian and coconutty but at the same time also with a lot more depth. Kind of a heavier dish, especially if you pair it with a starch side. Unlike most mussel apps at restaurants, this doesn't come with bread. Five star service. Everyone I talked to there were so friendly and knowledgeable, and not at all pretentious! When I first walked in here the elegant decor gave me some fears... Cocktails also great. From talking to the bartender it seems like they make as much stuff in-house as possible (this applies to the food too I think). And they're super standardized (measured by shot glass every time) so you know they're consistent!  Unfortunately, Embeya is not cheap. And when I'm paying $15-20 for a tiny few bites, I expect the most fundamentals to be right, yet all of my dishes were on the salty side. Not too unpleasantly so, but it did leave me debating whether I'd rave and recommend this restaurant so... 4 stars.

The Tenrdron & Lime cocktail was fine, but nothing better than any other craft cocktail you can get in the city these days. We started with the spring rolls which were, again, fine but nothing amazing. Entrees were the lobster and pork chop with a side of fried rice to share. Again, all of the food was ""nice"", but nothing to get excited about and certainly nothing that makes you say ""OH MY GOD"" after a bite. Most everything honestly felt like passable food from a decent hotel restaurant. Service was the worst I've had in almost a year and we dine out about 3x a week. Server was non-existent and the back waiters filled our water twice before they cleared our plates after we were obviously finished with our entrees. We didn't say anything about the meal when we walked out (always a bad sign) and when we got into the elevator coming home we looked at each other and said ""Well, we tried something new I guess.""",0.127,0.79,0.115,0.094,0.5937987012987013

Without reservation, I too can now say that Embeya ranks among the best meals I've ever had, period.  Don't let the misleading decor - which suggests a subpar ""international"" cuisine you'd find at a W Hotel in every city everywhere - fool you. Embeya is on point in every way. I was so excited to try this place that I wasn't even sheepish about dining alone, which normally I never do at restaurants this nice. As soon as I sat down at the bar, the lovely bartender Frances took excellent care of me. She was courteous, engaging, and incredibly friendly. I felt almost spoiled to be in her care, like she was my personal companion for the evening - get your mind out of the gutter, folks :-p I started with Frances' trademark Whiskey Citron cocktail. You could tell that she cared about the quality of her drinks. Without asking, she used Templeton Rye, which is a higher grade booze than most restaurants cocktails would give you. With a dash of orange bitters, the drink was delicious and refreshing. Next was the spicy green papaya salad, which I can't recommend highly enough. Who knew that papaya julienned doesn't even taste remotely like a fruit? Topped with a spicy vinaigrette dressing and shavings of beef jerky, I have to say this is one of the most inventive salads I've ever tasted. Roasted quail wings with chili lime sauce were next, with juicy morsels pairing perfectly with the spicy glaze. Finally, the udon rice noodles with diver scallops was the standout of the evening. Imagine scallops the size of your fist (harvested by scuba divers no less!) atop a bed of the most flavorful noodles ever made.

2014-06-06,4.0,"Last night my friend and I had the pleasure of dining at Embeya.  I read all the great reviews and couldn't wait to try it, and it did not disappoint in any way. Our reservation was for an early dinner on a Thurs. evening. It was early (5:30) so the restaurant was pretty quiet and there was no need for a reservation, but I would still suggest getting one in case it's busy. First the staff. NOTHING but excellent. From the host to our server, everyone was pleasant, helpful and accommodating.  For drinks I ordered the TENDRON & LIME, it was delicious! Summery and tropical. I could sip on one under an umbrella on the beach all day long. My friend ordered a Riesling, they have several varieties, she had our server suggest one that was slightly sweet, it was very nice.  For starters we ordered the Green Papaya Salad and the Spring Rolls.  As others have stated these are both fantastic. The salad is nicely sized to share, and was one of the best things I have ever had. Cool, light, crisp and so flavorful. The spring roll order comes with two small rolls cut in half, we split them, but next time, I am getting my own order. They were so meaty and flavorful. For our main course we ordered the Noodles with scallops and swiss chard, and the Halibut.  The Noodles were good, but a bit salty for my taste, but  I still happily ate it.  While everything we had was delicious, I will have dreams about the Halibut.  My friend and I could not get enough. The sauce was worthy of licking the plate (but don't it's a nice restaurant), and the fish...WHAT did they do to that fish? It was like velvet with a lightly crisp top. My friend and I agreed, THE BEST FISH we have ever had.  This isn't a cheap night out, but wow, what a delicious treat! Thank you Embeya, it was a pleasure.",0.9992,0.67,0.32,0.01,0.6047008547008549

2014-05-31,5.0,"Embeya could certainly be mistaken for a spa, sans the tables/chairs. The open space is inviting, with a sultry, calm vibe throughout. It was very relaxing, with minimal noise.  The drink I had was a mixture of tequila and some exotic sweet fruit. Can't remember the name of it, but it was #Bomb! We ordered from all: hot, cold, and main dishes. The green papaya salad was surprisingly hearty; summer rolls were good and compact; the beef carpaccio was flavorful and wet; the octopus, especially because of the delicious eggplant, was my favorite;  and the rabbit leg was a generously delicious portion of meat, that fell right off the bone. Dessert- the Flying blend (Intelligentsia coffee served French press); tofu almond custard (not a hit). The dessert was lacking anything stellar, or even semi-appetizing. The service was very good, but not the best. We never had to look around for anything to be refilled/replaced, but one server frequently asked whether we were finished eating... inquired for each dish! That was the only nuisance of our evening.  The crowd is cramped with business people, so business-casual attire is the norm here. Great atmosphere to sit on a romantic date, with a group of friends, or for larger business meetings.

For appetizers, we had the spring rolls (Vietnamese style), pickled vegetables and octopus. All were very delicious, but I think my favorite were the refreshing pickled vegetables.  For dinner, I selected the Halibut. The flavor was amazing with the green curry sauce, but it didn't hit the spot. I would have preferred a little larger portion size. Another person ordered the special, a fried sole fish, and she got enough to feed the a few people. Seems a little inconsistent to me.  For dessert, we tried the pineapple ice cream (very refreshing), the tofu custard (a little too watery for me) and the cream puff (nothing special). Where was the chocolate?!

But good flavors. - Noodles with scallops: liked the thick noodles and goopy sauce, scallops were fresh as well but could have been seared harder. - Fried Rice: this is a side and not what you'd typically expect. It is a simple ginger scallion mixed with really small grain Vietnamese rice. I loved it. - Roasted pineapple and coconut ice cream dessert: simple and delicious. - Matcha cream puff: needed more cream. Four people was good number to dine here to have a taste of everything.

This place is great for big groups, small groups, girls night out or a date! The food is divine. Everything I tried and tasted on the Restaurant Week menu was splendid.  Three reasons why it is not a 5-star review. First, I agree with other reviews about the waitstaff. Our waiter was extremely friendly, but was not very present. There was a good 20 minutes between the time we got sat and when we ordered our drinks. At least he was friendly, unlike the host who made us all check our coats despite the fact that we were seated next to the door on a particularly cold winter night. Third, the cocktail I had was so-so.  Overall, I would absolutely recommend this place, especially for a date or girls night out!",0.9792,0.824,0.176,0.0,0.4820175438596491

The escargot was also rich and buttery. The handmade noodles with scallops were also incredible. The only thing that surprised us about Embeya was the crazy amount of Rieslings on the menu.

2014-02-07,3.0,"Come for the food, stay for the ambiance. The third stop on my magical Chicago Restaurant Week tour took me to Embeya. I've literally walked by this place hundreds of times without a single thought as to what was inside and how the food was (much less the fact that it was a restaurant!). Anyhow, my group was seated in an area near the bar; we were immediately hypnotized by the room's decor. Light fixtures that liked like pricky orbs, wood paneling and curtains that separated dining areas, and mirrored paneling behind the bar.  The only downside of this experience was the actual food itself. The restaurant week menu was served family style, which meant that we all got a taste of everything. Started with plates of green papaya culantro with crispy shallots & vietnamese beef jerky, and also Kampach puffed rice with kumquat and chili oil. The main course was Thit Heo Kuo, which was braised pork belly, coconuts & shallots, Peking Duck Style Garlic Chicken with confit scallion, and caramelized brussel sprouts and sticky rice. Finally we got a vanilla cream puff for dessert.  The entire menu was just ok; no dish really stood out to me. There were some, such as the Thit Heo Kuo, that I didn't know what to think about.

The wait staff was attentive and helpful.  The food was timely and pretty good overall. I experienced the vegetarian tasting menu for Chicago Restaurant week.  A lot of food.  The Green Papaya salad was excellent as well as the friend rice and udon noodles.  The only complaint about the food I have is in regards to the brussel sprouts.  I am a HUGE fan and have had them many different ways.  These particular bussel srouts were way over cooked.  They were mushy.  I enjoyed the little fried crisp they had on the outside, but wish they were only cooked through to al dente and then they would have been spot on.  For dessert I really enjoyed the pineapple coconut ice cream (my boyfriend said it tasted like onions, but I think he cray) and then a green tea puff pastry which was also very good!!!

Needless to say, I would definitely recommend Embeya to anyone--would definitely be great for a larger group. It had a fun atmosphere without forcing ""trendy"" down your throat.

Aesthetics-wise, the dining room is spectacular: beautiful lighting fixtures that resemble floating tan orbs, dark, warm colors throughout, and Intricate wooden screens separating the entrance from the seating areas. You expect a great dining experience, and Embeya delivers!  Although we waited a bit longer than we wanted, despite the 830pm reservation, we killed time at the bar sampling their excellent wine selection. When we were finally sat, we chose the $33 menu. At first, I thought we had to choose one of several dishes, but instead we were given everything on the menu! The first course, consisting of papaya salad and octopus in a coconut milk sauce, was delicious. And I'm pretty picky when it comes to papaya salad! The octopus paired well with the papaya salad.  After wrapping up first course, a small bowl of fried shrimp rolls and lettuce leaves was placed on the table. Thinking it was second course, the waiter explained that he served this to us to make up for the long wait, which I thought was a nice gesture on their part. And it was delicious! Second course felt like a small buffet; I was not expecting that much food for what we paid. We were served some grilled Brussels sprouts, braised pork belly, garlic chicken, and fried rice! I really enjoyed this restaurant's take on food I usually eat on the weekends with my family on Argyle St, and they pulled it off without ruining the simplicity of these dishes. Last, we had green tea cream puffs and coconut ice cream. Both excellent and a nice ending to a memorable meal. The only thing stopping me from giving 5 stars was the long wait past our reservation time and having the complimentary shrimp rolls added to our bill (which was promptly removed from our bill when we pointed it out). Otherwise, well done! I will definitely come back again.",0.9959,0.805,0.182,0.013,0.5271929824561403
2014-02-05,1.0,"What a awful experience!!!  I was embarrassed for them at the level of unprofessionalism and rudeness from the host and waitstaff.  To begin, my friend and I went to grab a drink from the bar while waiting for our table. As we were ordering our drinks, the host came to tell us our table was ready. By the time we paid for our (poorly made) drinks, we were told that our table was given away!!!!!!!......they said ""as busy as we are tonight, we cannot wait around for you all night"".  I could not believe it! I've never had that happen and could not believe it was actually true!  We had to wait an additional 20 minutes for another table.    Next, our grouchy, unexcitable waitress was replaced with a new waiter. We were informed that out last waitress had to go home because she was pregnant and got sick. Lovely, just what I want to hear as I'm about to eat. Following that, every person who delivered food to the table was unhappy or unpleasant, with the exception if one waiter.  It may have been the bad service to put a bad taste in my mouth but it  was the food too!   Finally, when we were about to leave, they couldn't find our coats. It could be because, the coat closet (I mean clothing racks set up in the hallway by bathrooms), was so unorganized and had no system.  NEVER would I go back or recommend this poor excuse for a ""trendy"" restaurant to anyone.  DON'T BOTHER!!!!",-0.9225,0.843,0.052,0.105,0.554508559622196
2014-02-04,4.0,"Have you ever walked into a place and felt instantly sexy? Yes? Was that because you walked into Embeya?  Yeah, me too. We made 8:30 reservations because this is Chicago Restaurant Week, we always make reservations. The restaurant was bustling and lively.  We were greeted and a gentleman took our coats and a young lady lead us to our table. Moments later, our server came up to us and explain the restaurant week menu, regular menu, and drinks. I must say, from the moment we got there to the moment we left, we received nothing less than excellent service.  With an open kitchen design,  you can see the chefs working on the food you are eating.  I love open kitchens, its like watching an episode of Hell's Kitchen but without chef Gordon Ramsay screaming at the staff. Embeya's kitchen is like a well oiled machine.  We ordered the full four course restaurant week menu.  We ordered our drinks as we waited for our food to be prepared - Moscow Mules was the poison of choice. The bar had all sorts of good looking drinks from the bar. I always tell people that its all in the details. These small details made our night perfect. From the friendly hello to at the door all the way down to the well crafted drinks. Our food came quickly. I am a huge fan of Green Papaya Salad. That is what honestly drove me to come to Embeya. We ordered it spicy, because I love spicy with the green papaya salads. It was so fresh and and beautifully made with some fish sauce, lime, beef Jerky, and a right amount of spice. Then came the Kampachi. The Kamapachi had such delicate flavors so hard to explain but I will try.   The Kampachi had Eggplant and almost ceviche-like cooked octopus. It was so tender. The octopus was thinly sliced with a coconut milk and thinly sliced radish. The flavors worked so well together. I wish there was more of it! Then they brought the grilled quail topped with cebollitas with a chili salt and a side of limes. The thing is to squeeze the fresh lime into the dipping bowl if the Chili salt and dip the grilled quail and cebollitas in there. We totally devoured that. The quail was grilled to perfection. I am a huge fan of sauces and this really is a great dipping sauce for the quail any other sauce would have taken over the taste of the quail itself. These two just worked in perfect harmony with each other.  Then came the clams. When I first read the menu online, it said mussels. I am pretty sure what we got were clams. Whatever though, delicious nevertheless. It tasted almost like a coconut curry sauce and the dish was flavored with lemongrass. Easily my favorite dish.  The Braised Pork Belly with shaved coconut was alright, not my favorite. I felt like that dish need a bit more flavor, maybe an acid of some sort. I mean we ate it though, so it wasnt bad at all. We ate the Peking Duck style garlic chicken. I didn't know you could possibly get chicken to be so juicy with a great crisp at the same time. The chicken was so succulent. I can tell that someone in that kitchen spent a great deal of time to make sure the chicken wasn't over cooked. That is a huge job because chicken can go dry fast. The Caramelized brussel sprouts were executed perfectly. They cooked out most of the bitterness and got an impressive sear on them. It came with a sauce that I can't quite break down. Almost like a vinaigrette, fish, and soy sauce. Embeya changed the brussel sprout game! Dessert was Creme Puffs accompanied by coconut ice cream on top of roasted pineapple. these soft and billowy cream puffs with a vanilla custard with some ice cream made this meal rise to perfection level.  The waiter was super helpful and cheerful. He made my first Embeya experience wonderful. Street parking was readily available.

We were seated in the middle section of the restaurant close to the entrance and were served by a middle-aged man with glasses. He was probably one of the worst servers we've had over the past several years.  First of all, he completely rushed us - not only was our second course served before our first was even finished, but he gave us our check after only one bite of our dessert - why such a rush?!  We felt like he wanted us to just eat and get the heck out of his restaurant.   More importantly, for whatever reason, he showed complete favoritism for other tables over ours. His questions (i.e. how is your food?)  felt completely forced as he would start leaving even before we answered.  Meanwhile, he would chat for 5 minutes with the table next to us, with his butt hanging over our expensive meal as we dined.

2014-02-03,4.0,"I live in the West Loop, and have heard many good things about it.. So I was most excited to see that they were participating in Restaurant Week.  Upon arriving, I was impressed with the size, and decor of the restaurant. Pretty light fixtures and paintings, neutral music that was not loud or overwhelming, and spacious comfortable seating so you can enjoy your dinner without seated too close, or on top of the table next to you. Our party chose the 4 course fixed menu, and it was delicious, and memorable. The First course was Green Papaya Salad, and the Octopus Confit. The papaya was my favorite- It consisted of culantro, crispy shallots, and mini thin strips of Vietnamese beef jersey. The flavor was light and refreshing, and we enjoyed the crispy/crunchy texture a lot. I am not a big fan of octopus or eggplant, but our party enjoyed the portion, and flavors of the dish. The second course was grilled quail and clams/mussels. Both fantastic. The quail was perfect.. Was served with limes, and a chili salt glaze which tasted great with the meat. I only wish there was more of it; I would have eaten that dish all to myself! I don't eat mussels very often, but these were delicious. The sauce reminded me of Tom Kha Gai soup; which is one of my favorites, and the texture was perfect; not too firm, or too soft.   Main course was Thit Heo Kho (pork belly), garlic chicken, caramelized brussels sprouts, and sticky rice. All were very tasty, and had great flavor. The chicken was very tender, and moist, which is hard to perfect, in my opinion. Brussels sprouts were awesome! Even people who dislike them would enjoy it- they had great flavor.  The service was great and prompt, and the staff was very friendly and approachable; eager to please.

My date and I decided on the three-course Restaurant Week menu.  They serve family style, something I really love.  Each course on the Chicago Restaurant Week menu is two different dishes for the table to share.  Just a heads up: the Restaurant Week menu we had was not the one posted on their website! Appetizers: 1. GREEN PAPAYA SALAD, culantro, crispy shallots, and Vietnamese beef jerky. The green papaya was prepared like an angel hair pasta.  It was a cold, wet, crunchy texture, and not very flavorful.  The beef jerky was good (of course), but there were only a few little twig-like stems in the entire dish.  I really liked the concept of this dish, especially that it was served like a healthy ""pasta alternative"", but it had no flavor.  Very bland. 2. OCTOPUS CONFIT, grilled eggplant, peanut, and basil.  This dish was also served cold.  It was flavorful and tasty, and a good, light starter. Entrées: 1. GARLIC CHICKEN CONFIT, and braised scallion.  This dish was plain, but good.  The chicken was flavorful and tender. 2.  BRAISED PORK BELLY, quail eggs, black garlic, and coconut shavings.  This was my favorite entrée. It's an interesting combination, and it all tasted great together. SIDES:  Sticky rice and brussel sprouts.  I really liked these brussel sprouts:  crunchy and seasoned well! Dessert: Vanilla and matcha CREAM PUFF with ROASTED COCONUT ICE CREAM.  I'm not supposed to eat dairy, but I had a taste of the cream puff and the ice cream, and both were yummy!  My date thought the same.  Our wonderful waiter brought out a TOFU ALMOND CUSTARD with ginger and blackberries so that I could have a dairy-free dessert.  It was fantastic.  If you are on a dairy-free diet, order the tofu almond custard! Overall, it was a good experience.  The staff here are all very friendly and accommodating.  I didn't love everything that I tried, but I'm really happy I was able to try dishes that I never had before.  I hope to return!",0.9989,0.742,0.245,0.012,0.638917748917749

They were almost yelling, ""Soy sauce doesn't have gluten, right?"" Which, by the way, most do. They clearly knew nothing about the allergy. One chef asked if I could have one of the sauces and the other replied, ""I don't know but she ain't getting it!!"" while laughing loudly. So unprofessional. The food was terrible and plain. My advice to you: There is MUCH better food in the city than rice noodles wrapped in rice paper that costs $10.  Advice to management: I don't care if your chefs know nothing about gluten, but either get rid of your gluten free menu or educate them.

2014-01-23,1.0,"I went to Embeya with a group of 6 women. The evening started out well and the drinks were superb. The space is vast and the atmosphere meant to be lively, although on a Thursday evening in the west loop it was almost empty. The food was innovative and the chef came over to visit our table to thank us for coming.  It was quite pricey for Asian, considering all of the great options we have in Chicago. I don't think the price point is realistic for the long term success of the restaurant. Although there were maybe only 6 tables of people in the whole place, they sat everyone up near the door. The table with their backs to us was exceptionally rude and made a scene repeatedly regarding the noise level from our table. As I stated, we were a group of 6 professional women, and were not any louder than any ordinary lively atmosphere restaurant or bar. There is a large echo given the layout. In addition, our conversation was not offensive or crude. They refused to be reseated to a quieter area and the management did nothing to help. It came to a head when one of the men threatened my friend, getting up in her face and calling her a ""c"" word. I have never witnessed anything like it. Again, the management did nothing, acting as though we brought this on ourselves. At one point, there was even talk of calling the police. I still am shaking thinking of this horrible altercation. After the other diners left, the manager sent over some free deserts and the full bill. After my friend's life had been threatened by a clearly deranged other diner! I'm sorry, but a few scoops of sticky rice and mango is not going to make up for this atrocious experience. Hopefully no one else has an experience like ours. But if you go, be advised that it will be expensive and you may be one of the only tables in there so don't get too lively.

2014-01-16,3.0,"My girlfriends and I were excited to try Embeya, as we had all read the high praise and positive reviews from guests and critics alike. Unfortunately, the entire experience fell flat for us due to a couple of reasons:  The space is quite large and exposed. Decor is modern but it doesn't feel warm or inviting. It's definitely not a space in which I would spend an extended period of time. It was also quite drafty and cold due to the revolving door (understandable that the weather is out of their control, but since this is winter in Chicago I would suggest getting a temporary awning/ entrance during the winter like most other restaurants). I would not recommend dining here if you're looking for a private meal or date. The service was also lackluster. There was no one at the host stand when we arrived and it took about 5 minutes for anyone to greet our party. Our server was kind enough, but it appeared as though she was serving the entire dining floor; she was quite busy due to this and didn't visit our table often.  The food was nothing to complain about, but certainly nothing I would recommend either. For dinner, we ordered the papaya salad, escargot, mussels and kampachi. The mussels were the best out of the bunch. Everything else tasted fairly standard and as though it could be replicated elsewhere. We ordered the tofu custard and roasted pineapple for dessert. These were the most enjoyable dishes of the evening, but the pineapple is the only thing I would order again.

This got us really excited for our main course, however,the food was a major disappointment.  The garlic chicken was AWFUL. My cafeteria's roasted chicken has more flavor than this. It was dry and just had NO flavor. Presentation was nice, but it was almost inedible. Hubby got the seared tofu dish, which resembled a Thai curry. We are thai fanatics...but this was just average.

The food was bright with flavors that were unexpected and pleasantly surprising.  I was with a big group and we tasted 90% of the menu.  It seems like you really can't go wrong, but a few of the highlights were the octopus and quail appetizers, the whole fish of the day and the chicken.  I know chicken?  It was the most tender, juiciest chicken that I have ever had  (I believe it was prepared sous-vide, that is the only way I could imagine such a texture being successfully accomplished).   I don't have a huge sweet-tooth, but a few members of my party were disappointed by  the dessert menu, particularly the lack of a chocolate option on.  Other than that I found some of the appetizers to be on the smaller side, while the entrees seemed to conversely be on the larger side.  The imbalance, is a minor gripe as we ended up having plenty of food, but a few tweaks to portion size (more to the appetizers, than entrees) would go a long way.",0.7728,0.857,0.086,0.058,0.5512254901960784

The octopus with confit eggplant and coconut cream set the tone for a great experience to follow. The coconut cream is more like a foam, making it light enough to enjoy along with the eggplant and octopus. The escargot in green curry and grilled eggplant is a modern take on the regular escargot and is a must-try. The man had the duck and I had the cobia fish for our main course and both dishes were spectacular. The desserts deserve special mention, because they have an exotic fruit bowl which has all my favorite fruits in one bowl. We requested the durian to be added so the bowl can be wholesome. Longan, rambutan, and the dragon fruit were fresh and delicious. The durian made our breath stink while we enjoyed the creamy texture and deliciousness of a ripe pod. There is a reason why durian is banned on the subway in Bangkok - the smell is atrocious. But it is one delicious fruit! The cocktails are well crafted. The Tendron and Lime - vodka, fresh coconut water, and citrus served with a caramelized coconut skewer is simply divine. The husband ordered a Revivalist - bourbon, felernum, and lemon, which he loved.  Service is one of the best I've experienced in Chicago.

I honestly can't even narrow down the dishes to just one favorite to recommend because everything tasted so good...!

All in all, it was a pleasant experience.  A tad long wait, but compensated for nicely.  Nice flavors, inventive dishes, and reasonable value.",0.9993,0.708,0.26,0.033,0.5616629464285715
2013-10-17,1.0,"Check out the response that the ""Director"" wrote to my FIRST one star review - can you believe this guy? Man you are clueless and let me tell you why since you have COMPLETELY missed it.  First of all, learn how to add and subtract. I mean really? If it's not ""unusual"" for your star server Josh to receive a whopping 45% tip (Um for a $362 meal I think that is outrageous but who am I?) then why did you mess with his tip? If it CLEARLY indicates 1 6 0 as you stated in your poor response, then why did you charge us $482 instead of $522? Get a calculator and do the math. The tip is not $100. The tip is not $160. The tip is for $40 (which was a mistake). Regardless, guess what? The charge goes by the total amount written, not what you decide is appropriate as this part is the responsibility of the cardholder, not YOU. Don't try to twist a simple mistake on our part into a ""misunderstanding"" on your part. There is no misunderstanding as there is no $100 or $160 tip written on the charge slip. We always tip 20% unless the service sucks. There was a mistake here on our part but your lack of professionalism in your response is unbelievable.  Sometimes the customer is wrong, I believe that. In this case, not only did you or your staff take it upon yourselves to change our total and invent a $100 tip but you argued it and tried to tell me it CLEARLY says 1 6 0 which it DOES NOT. Get some glasses. You haven't done anything but create an additional update for a one star review because of your audacious response. GET A CLUE. And you know what, ""naturally delight"" this! Who says that?? Are you serious?? I've read your other responses to reviews and they are ridiculous - sometimes you just have to admit a mistake was made and leave it alone, especially as the ""Director"". RIDICULOUS. All in CAPS in case you missed that too. For those of you reading this take a look at her other responses. If you take the time to write a review outlining what you didn't like, that I think it valid by the way - is it a good idea for the ""Director"" to respond disagreeing with you, pushing her points and suggesting you read articles about how great your restaurant is?? And the lady with a horrible lunch experience and the other one with no meat on her quail. Your responses are AWFUL!!!!!  Hello Angela, Thank you so much for writing about your experience at Embeya. We are truly sorry for this misunderstanding as the bill clearly indicates 1 6 0 for the tip, and ""total"" line is scribbled off and not legible at all. Although this sounds like it is unusual, a 45% tip is not unusual for our star server Josh, who has created many a memorable experience for our guests on their visits. Please rest assured that this was strictly a misunderstanding, not in-line with our professionalism or style, and we express our sincerest apologies for any inconvenience you may have experienced. Naturally, we would be delighted to rectify the bill, and credit back what ever you think is appropriate. Please contact me directly either at 312 434 6564 or by email at  attila@embeya.com .

Our entrees were excellent but the standout in my opinion was the roast duck leg.  This was as good a duck as I've had in a long time - crispy skin, tender meat and a beautiful aromatic sauce.  The pork ribs were delicious as was the fish-of the-day, sole crusted in rice flour.  Desserts were just ok, but very exciting and unusual was the availability of fresh durian.  Wow ... durian is like a car accident ... you had to look, didn't you? I have to rave about the cocktail and wine program.  Their take on the Manhattan, called ""The Revivalist"" is delicious - Buffalo Trace bourbon, something called falernum (a sweet Caribbean syrup similar to orgeat syrup) and lemon.  It's not as heavy as a Manhattan and it seems like you can drink this all night ...

Simple Sundays is a tasting menu for 2 at $29.  Chef missed the meaning of tasting menu as you don't experience the journey of flavors and theme, but just food given to you in batches. In each course, all dishes are served at one time (not staggered), so you get an overwhelming effect of 'eat now.'   Mega portion of the cheap ingredients, less on the quality/expensive ingredient to one bite. First: Green Papaya salad -- you get the entire shredded papaya.  Great dish accompaniment.  It had a damp clothing after taste the next day. Spring Roll -- nice tight wrapping.  Excellent crisp.  You only get 1, split in 2.  Drowned by leafy veggies and sauce. Main: Ribs -- 2 dinosaur bones.  Good marination and taste.  Juicy. Garlic Chicken -- a big thigh.  Not much taste, just oily.  Cooked well. Sugar Snap Peas -- soggy snap peas with super salty mushroom. Dessert: Exotic Fruit Bowl -- a small cup, not a bowl (misleading).  Bravo Chef for choosing the typical traditional fruit selections from southeast Asia.  I dare you to know how to eat them! Tendron & Lime ($12) -- overpriced.  Booze is watered down by coconut water.   Wine List -- Can you count the number of brands for Riesling?  Looks like a wine store got rid of their inventory at Embeya.

The only reason I've given them 4 stars instead of 5 is because of the steep prices- some of the appetizers and sides are a little pricey for the portions. Favorite dishes include: market fish (usually a whole fish...gotten this every time because it's so great!), papaya salad, squash blossoms, ribs (3 HUGE ribs. Share these!), green beans, sticky rice. I always glance at other people's food and everything really looks great. I don't think you could go wrong with anything on the menu! Also, cocktails are AWESOME. When the weather is nice I highly recommend the patio. Although it's in the West Loop, which is an industrial looking area, they do a great job making the patio into a sweet little haven.

I didn't like how the menu was so small, I was very limited to what I could get. I like the ambiance a lot and it was very quiet inside so I enjoyed it. The outside seating was really cute, however it was a bit chilly so we sat inside. Parking was really easy to find as well.

Here's why I like it: 1- Super  friendly and attentive hosts and staff.  During the first visit, the host was in a great mood, seated us quickly, and we had a great exchange.   The bar staff was also engaging and fun- we talked about several of the specialty spirits (Ransom gin is here!) and gave us great recos on the apps. And it was also lovely that after we finally decided on a few plates, he sent another for us to enjoy.  You gotta love that! 2- the tuna.  I just wish there was more on that plate... Ordered during both visits, it melts in your mouth along with the crunchiness of the cucumber and the slightly sweet and light spice of the sauce.  Just writing this review may be a prompt for another visit this week.  I also enjoyed the banana blossom salad and the rolls.  And a lovely Sancerre. 3- the patio.  A spot where drinks al fresco won't be a big hassle.  Good meet up spot.

My husband actually received the same lemonade as me (hibiscus) even though that isn't the one he ordered. Ok, no big deal.  We both started with the soup of the day that was the highlight of the meal. I don't remember what it was called but it had meatballs, mushrooms, and corn, among other things. Really tasty. After that we waited. And waited. And waited for our entrees to come out. We joked that they were out hunting our meals as we waited.  I ordered the quail and my husband got the rabbit. I love quail. This unfortunately did not live up to any I've had before. It was bone dry. There was no sauce, no apparent seasoning. My husbands rabbit on the other hand was succulent and delicious. If I had ordered his dish, I would have been more pleased with this place.  The service we received was the reason I will likely never step foot in here again. We ordered soup and entrees.  And yet we were there for an hour and 20 minutes. We waited for 25 minutes to pay our check. Literally sitting there with the credit card in the bill holder standing upright on our table, even tried to flag down every single person that walked by but we were vehemently ignored. This was a lunch during the workday. If you want to draw and keep a lunch crowd you have to get people in and out of there in less than an hour. We were so irritated when we left that we both swore this place off. On top of that, our bill for 2 lemonades, 2 soups and 2 entrees was $68.

That the best I can say about the place. The food itself was not remarkable; we had the mussels, which were slightly fishy, the quail, the chicken dish and the rabbit, which seems to be overrated. The main problem was the actual food service took entirely too long, it seemed like 15 min to 30 min between drinks, small plates and large plates, with at least three sets of people coming to the table to clear it of various things. Probably the best part of the meal was dessert, which was roasted pineapple and the cream puff.

For main entrees we got the lobster, rib eye, noodles with scallops, coconut broth mussels, with a side of asparagus and beans.  The rib eye was my least favorite,it was extremely dry and over done, and I thought was sliced too thin, then scallop noodles were delicious! It was the best thing on the menu and if I were to ever go back it would be for those! The mussels were very good, and the coconut broth they cooked them in was delicious over rice which is what the server recommended.   Our waiter was super nice made good suggestions.   The ambiance was really nice and trendy their outdoor patio was really cute as well, parking was extremely easy to find.   Overall just an OK experience!",0.9964,0.705,0.287,0.009,0.6737777777777776
2013-08-11,5.0,"Wow. Was originally planning to try the rabbit, as I hadn't had rabbit in a while. But I saw the lunch tasting menu (appetizer, entree, rice, dessert) and opted for that instead. The shrimp rolls were crispy and fantastic, and were complemented perfectly with the sauce served on the side and the lettuce in which you wrap it. The addition of a couple of fresh mint leaves in each lettuce wrap provided an excellent dimension that my tongue tingle. The seafood stew was out of this world. Mussels, clams, shrimp, and fish. Eat them alone, eat them with the rice, drink the wonderful seafood broth with coconut milk like a soup, do whatever you want; it will be delicious any way you try it. Finally, for dessert, I had the custard. Its name was either ""soy"" or ""tofu"" custard. Either way, it was delicious, and while it was sweet enough to be a dessert, it still had a savoury taste that created a really good and interesting contrast. Had blueberries on top, as well as (I believe) a bit mixed into the custard. I don't like to give 5 stars on the first trip, to be honest, but this place just blew me away. Also, for $21, that meal was a real good value (that's the price for the tasting menu, no drinks). They do not give you ""tasting"" sizes just because you are having the tasting menu. Because if those were tasting sizes of the shrimp rolls, seafood stew, and tofu custard, I would be afraid to see how big the ""real"" portions are.",0.9806,0.833,0.152,0.016,0.7083333333333335

The food is typical of a trendy place though; extremely small portions, but nice presentation. I ordered the stuff quail and it was meh. The dish should have been called giant bean ball wrapped in some skin that resembles a quail. There was almost no meat in the quail. The only saving point was that it came with rice, so I had to eat a whole bunch of rice to even consider to be full. My coworkers got the rice noodle salad, which was topped with an amazing looking steak. But again, the dish looked extremely small. My other coworker got the lamb and he said it was pretty tasty. BATHROOM REVIEW: This place had Individual bathroom rooms. Each door had a sign in the doorknob that says ""Vacant"" or ""Occupied"", much like how an airplane bathroom has the sign on its doorknob. Also further resembling an airplane bathroom was the size; it was somewhat small; I had to open the door like it was an airplane bathroom and gingerly stepped in. Inside you'll see a toilet and a small sink. When you are done with the bathroom, you need to back up almost completely against the toilet, open the door as wide as you can, and then step out. Other than the size, the bathroom itself was really clean and tidy. Sit or squat? Sit... but not too long or you might cramp up",0.9735,0.88,0.099,0.022,0.5424242424242425

While I think the quality of the food is good, I do not think its quality justifies the price. We had their version of papaya salad, where the beef jerky adds to taste but takes out a lot from freshness and does not sit well with the acidic flavors. Our main entrees were the chicken (prepared like peking duck), and the soft shell crab with rhubarb. They were both good and well prepared, but I am hesitant to say that they were worth their price. I also tried their rabbit, which is their only dish I would truly recommend, and their roasted pineapple and vanilla and green tea cream puff - which were both interesting desserts, and a bit disappointing. Long story short, if you are a fan of fusion food and can afford it, this place is probably worth your visit, but does not deserve exceedingly high expectations.",0.9677,0.768,0.175,0.058,0.4773015873015873

2013-07-15,1.0,"Crap crap crap! This place was absolutely crap!! If I could give a 0 star rating, I would give it to this restaurant. I eat out often (many times a week), and this restaurant has nothing to offer besides a pretty/sophisticated place to sit. My mother was in town, and I wanted to show her some of the fantastic food that Chicago has to offer, so I decided to try this place because of its 4 star rating on Yelp. However, we were completely disappointed and dissatisfied. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Service  0/5  I have only had two other times where the service made me feel so horribly upset. We arrived at the restaurant around 8pm, and a server sat us down within 10 minutes. However, it all went downhill from there.  Whoever was pouring the water came only once every 30-45 minutes... Furthermore, our waiter didn't take our appetizer order until 20 minutes after we were ready to order (I tried to flag him down, but he was always walking around and never looked in my direction).  I had a question about the main entrees, so I didn't order my entree just yet. That was a BIG MISTAKE. The appetizers didn't arrive until around 8:50, but the worst part was that the waiter never came around to take my entree order. I finally flagged down the manager (who had to ignore me for a few minutes to talk to another guest). He took my entree order of garlic chicken. Five whole minutes later, our waiter came back and told us that garlic chicken was sold out. He then took another 15 minutes before he returned to take our new order. The main course came out relatively quickly compared to the appetizers. However, my mom and I did not have plates because they took our plates after we finished our appetizers. The server said he would come back right away with new plates, but he never did. In the meanwhile, the restaurant's manager, was just walking around cleaning up tables that were right and left of our table. I had to try really hard to flag him down before he finally came over to give us our plates. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Mussels 2/5 The coconut sauce was good, but it tasted like generic coconut sauce that I can find at a Thai take out restaurant... I have had FRESH mussels, and I am a huge fan of FRESH shellfish in general (I absolutely love fresh oysters), which is why these mussels were a HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT BECAUSE THEY WERE NOT FRESH. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Soft Shell Crab 3.5/5 The soft shell crab was my favorite dish of the night. However, I've had better. If you want a truly delicious soft shell crab that's cooked to perfection, try Nori Sushi. Their soft crab is MUCH more delicious AND it's $10 cheaper, so why in the world would you want to eat at Embeya? -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Roast Bass 3.5/5 The bass was good, but again, NOTHING SPECIAL. If you want a good bass, go to Sapori Trattoria. It might be an Italian style, but the bass is more tender, and the sauce at Sapori Trattoria is better. ""Oh, but Embeya is Asian Fusion."" No no no! I've had better Asian Fusion at Koi in Evanston. -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Steamed Rice 1/5 Why would anyone rate the rice you say? Well, I'm Asian, so rice is important to me. Also, you can really judge a restaurant by the smaller details... A great restaurant will go the extra length to make sure that everything is up to par.  Anyhow, about the rice... It was rough and bland. Good rice is soft and has a subtle rice fragrance. The rice at Koi in Evanston is better. Heck, even the white rice at Chipotle is softer! --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   Overall, Embeya was a huge let down, and I have no idea where all these good reviews came from...",0.9978,0.768,0.167,0.065,0.5120913569189433

I asked for a mojito-type drink and the bartender made me a drink that tasted like a lime popsicle. It was awesome. One thing that really struck me while reading the menu was the lack of non-carnivorous options. Everything was meat or fish based. Typically restaurants will have at least one item sans meat.  I had the tofu appetizer which was small but tasty, and some of the side vegetable dishes. Still, nice restaurants should invest a little energy into coming up with a versatile menu. That being said, nothing I tried was particularly noteworthy.

And the grilled octopus was spot on for flavor and texture, served with green mango, green garlic, and cilantro - an exceptional appetizer, to say the least. Moving on to entrees, we enjoyed the garlic chicken confit scallion. Sliced into little tenderloin pieces, which were tender and juicy, it was an easy one to share and the portion size was plentiful.

2013-07-09,5.0,"Embeya had been on my list of places to try for the past few months, and I finally made it here on Sunday for dinner.  We came around 7:30pm, and we were surprised that the restaurant was nearly empty seeing as though it's been getting a little buzz here in Chicago.  There were probably only 3 other parties seated.  This was actually kind of a breath of fresh air since every restaurant I go to in Chicago seems to either have LOOOONG lines/waits or requires reservations.  The restaurant space is beautiful though not over the top.  We saw on the website that Embeya had a Sunday $29/person tasting menu of appetizer/entree/dessert.  We had assumed that you pick one of two options under each category, however when our really nice waiter explained the menu to us, we were surprised that it was actually a family style tasting menu featuring all 7 courses was to be served.  It also happened to have all the dishes we would have wanted to try anyways.  We knew this was the way to go, and you can't beat $29/person for what would be 7 awesome courses.  We ended up opting for $50/person which included wine pairings. Appetizers were the Green Papaya Salad and Baby Octopus (charred with green papaya). These were paired with an excellent glass of sake, which went great with the apps.  The portions were perfect for 2 people.  Flavors were incredible.  The sweetness in the green papaya salad was just right.  The charred taste in the baby octopus was strong yet not overpowering.  This was a great start to the meal.  Entrees were the Ribs (with tamarind, toasted garlic, hoisin) and Crispy Noodles (with sweet peppers, basil, head-on prawns).  I was surprised that the crispy noodles were served in a soupy broth (without being noodle soup).  The prawns that came with it were sweet and so tender, just perfectly cooked.  While the ribs were nothing phenomenal or different, they were cooked well.  The entrees were served with steamed rice.  The entrees also came with a side of asparagus with Chinese bacon and roasted cashes.  It was a bit skimpy on the bacon, however the asparagus was still perfectly cooked in a savory thin sauce.  Entrees were paired with an excellent French red wine. Desserts were the green tea matcha puff and the bowl of exotic fruits.  The fruits included jackfruit, rambutan, lychee, and longan.  Being Filipino, these fruits were nothing new to me, and I did not mind one bit peeling my fruits at the dinner table.  :) Embeya is a GREAT affordable place to go for their Simple Sunday dinners.  Otherwise, dinner at Embeya is not cheap, however Chef Thai Dang is doing something right here, and I can truly appreciate what he's doing with ""upscale Vietnamese food.""  It's hard to come by excellent upscale Asian food in Chicago, so this is a great place to have here, and I suspect this restaurant will do really well.",0.9978,0.824,0.163,0.013,0.6241787624140566

At which point I had to ask if he was our waiter as he wasn't dressed any nicer than the bussers. He finally took our drink order but still failed to introduce himself so I have no idea who he was.  The cocktails were wonderful. I had the tendron & lime which was extremely refreshing and the Revivalist, which was strong but very excellent especially if you're a bourbon fan.

The bamboo dish was different with black rice and egg on the inside of the rice.  Other plates we tried were the mussels, crispy noodles, ribs, and ribeye.

We were obviously looking for small dishes during our visit, but I wouldn't recommend coupling the ""hot"" and ""cold"" dishes to create a full meal, as the portions are smaller than you might expect, and the cost adds up quickly. As for drinks, I ordered the Revivalist (very bourbon-heavy) and the Sato Zuke, both of which were excellent.  The ambience was very cool, the waiting staff was very friendly and efficient, and the outdoor dining area was wonderful. The small dishes are a little pricey for the portion size you receive, but it's overall a solid place for a dinner date or a group outing!

2013-06-17,2.0,"Lunch review: The spring rolls were fried, and pretty much tasteless. They came with dipping sauce and lettuce to wrap them in, very strange... I expect fresh, not fried, for a place like this. My fish stew was decent, but my friend's chicken was just average. The rice pudding dessert had no flavor, and was in dire need of some zing. For the price, I would not recommend this place for lunch. Perhaps it's b/c lunch is new, but l was disappointed, as I was visiting Chicago and expected a more stellar experience.

Whatever is on the menu is delicious though, particularly the Fried Tofu, Baby Octopus and Ribs. Another gripe: portions are fairly small so you should consider ordering family-style and have a chance to try everything. The service started out superb, but as the place filled up with the late Saturday dining crowd, help became harder to get. It took us easily 15 minutes to get our waiter's attention and get the check.

The banana blossom dish was super flavorful and we really enjoyed the variety of textures in this dish. The tofu appetizer was a miss for me, only because I hated the fiddleheads n the tofu itself,  which was prepared in-house could've been marinated to have some flavor infused into them.

They reach for some interesting flavor combinations yet never actually get to that point they are reaching for. Our waiter was super nice and helpful in our ordering. It was a bit uncomfortable that he tried to push certain dishes (particularly the $52 fish) and more food than we wanted to order on us. We also had the ribs brought out to us instead of what we ordered, but we ended up keeping them and not correcting our waiter as they looked good.

MUSSELS coconut, lime leaf   $18 - the coconut sauce was really good! I can't eat mussels but loved the sauce on this a ton! STICKY RICE $4 - Yep this costs extra. My favorite thing of the night was dipping the sticky rice in the coconut sauce that came with the mussels. Mmmmm, YUM, delicious! RIBS tamarind, toasted garlic, hoisin   $18 - Enjoyed this dish but can't say I loved it. We had 4 people and our waiter suggested getting 3-4 dishes per person.

I'm fluent in Vietnamese and Em Be is our word so I wanted to correct her as it sounded so awkward to my ear but thought I'd save her the embarrassment. You don't pronounce the Y ;-) EVERR. Like *Hai Yen. The Y is also silent and not pronounced. Bitches. I know that with different languages, there's different alphabets and different rules so I don't expect the general public to know but if you work there.....     Which Bravo to Pasteur and Le Colonial staff for pronouncing Vietnamese words correctly. Well trained. **But of course Hai Yen knows how to pronounce its own name as it's operated by Vietnamese, I was just using it as a local example.  If you're going to do it, do it right otherwise don't bother. I'm looking at you too Baumx & Brix, among others. Seems to be a pattern in this city. Is it cuz it's the midwest?

There's definitely some potential in this swanky River North/West Loop restaurant. My husband and I got there about 15 min before we were supposed to meet our friends and enjoyed a few drinks at the bar. He chose something from their impressive menu, while I went with a dry riesling which came highly recommended by a few people sitting at the bar. While not the best riesling I've had, it was good enough to later order a 2nd glass once we sat at our table.  The food was just OK. It's probably the type of place that you want to share, but our party of 6 picky eaters was having trouble making decisions so we opted to just order our own. We did, however, share some apps. The mussels and shrimp dumplings, which you wrap in lettuce, were my personal favorites. I ordered the garlic chicken for my entree since it was highly recommended by my fellow yelpers. Perhaps it was an off night, but it didn't taste any better than mass produced wedding chicken. My hubby got the monkfish, which was better than the chicken, but nothing to go back for. We also got a side of fried rice, which may have been the best thing we ate at embeya. I would have actually never even known it was fried if it didn't say so on the menu. The service was very slow and we didn't finish our meal til 10:30pm (for an 8:15pm reservation). In all fairness they did bring us an extra fried rice to make up for the slow service, but still kind of annoying...especially when you're paying the nanny by the hour. It still ended up being a fun evening thanks to the company, but I'd opt to meet my friends elsewhere next time. Then again they are still pretty new so perhaps they'll live up to their potential.",0.9733,0.816,0.129,0.055,0.48820346320346303

2013-03-12,3.0,"Embeya is a tough review, because our experience there is partly our fault and partly the restaurant's fault.  We went with another couple last Friday night.  The space itself is nice and open and modern and trendy, in line with what we usually see in a new fancy restaurant in downtown Chicago.  Our hostess was quite possibly the most friendly hostess I've ever had in my life.  She happily took our coats and bags (the two boys had come straight from work), genuinely welcomed us to the restaurant and seemed really excited that it was Friday and she wanted us to enjoy our Friday evening out.  I'm used to a less interested, slightly more snooty greeting at a place like this, so it was a pleasant surprise. The cocktail menu was interesting enough, but we opted for a bottle of wine for the table. The menu is designed for sharing and is best appreciated by sharing.  We foiled ourselves a little bit, as our other couple preferred going single entrees for each of them, and my fiance and I ended up ordering 2 small plates and 1 entree to share.  I recommend going with a group and sharing across the table, to be able to really explore their offerings. That said, the items we did try were good but not amazing.  Our friends ordered the garlic chicken and the monkfish entrees.  I didn't try the garlic chicken but it was described as mediocre and really really garlicky.  I'm sure garlic chicken was probably not one of their marquee items, and one of those dishes you put on the menu to have a basic entree available to people.  But it still should be made well.  It could have been cooked better and the flavors could have been better balanced. My fiance and I went with the shrimp dumplings, the cured salmon, and the monkfish.  The dumplings were very tasty and served lettuce wrap style.  Nothing mind-blowing, but really how much opportunity is there to blow someone's mind with shrimp dumplings?  The cured salmon was also very tasty, but I would have preferred larger chunks.  The salmon was cubed very tiny which made it difficult to pick up with chopsticks and you weren't able to experience the full flavor of the salmon with such small bites.   The monkfish accompaniments were excellent.  The curry it was served with was perfection (and drinkable) and I appreciated the spaghetti squash and sweet potato as a nice change (though my fiance thought the spaghetti squash was a bit weird and would have preferred standard noodles).  The problem with the monkfish was that it was overcooked.  Monkfish is one of my favorite fish but it is supposed to be cooked just enough that each piece is full of flavor and melts in your mouth.  In this case, the monkfish was chewy and almost rubbery and we had to cut each piece with a knife, rather than just a fork.  For me, this was the big disappointment of the night. Our server was nice enough, but seemed annoyed with us at times.  Again, this was partly our fault.  We took a bit long in deciding on cocktails or wine and then again on our food choices.  On the other hand, if we asked for just a minute to decide, our server would literally come back 20 seconds later and seemed annoyed that we still weren't ready.  ""A minute to decide"" means at least a full minute, dude.  He also seemed annoyed that we didn't go the full sharing/tasting route with our ordering.  I understand that we were going against the way the menu was designed, and I was against this as well, but we're still the customer and we still get to choose how we want to order.  So it would't hurt to hide your annoyance a bit.  However, whatever our server lacked in pleasant disposition, the hostess more than made up for. I would give Embeya another try someday and go back to sample a better variety of the menu.  But I thought the execution of the few items we had could have been better.  Chicago has a lot of other options out there for $60-70/per person that I'd rather try before going back.",0.9966,0.772,0.155,0.073,0.5212672947967063

This weekend my parents were visiting from Montana and had a friend recommend that we check out Embeya.  His recommendation was spot on.  Not only did Attila (the director) personally recommend wines and check up on us throughout the meal...the food was to die for.  The Shrimp Dumplings were an instant favorite along with pretty much every other single dish from Prawns to Noodles w/ Baby Scallops to Monk Fish (""poor man's lobster""). I am not a fan of brussels sprouts, but when I tasted them at Embeya they melted in my mouth and thoroughly enjoyed them...I will no longer avoid brussel sprouts like the plague, haha.  The califlower was also one of my favorites and if you are getting a desert you have to try the Cream Puff Top -- DY-NO-MITE!          My family is Catholic and since it was a Friday during Lent, we had opted to go with the strictly seafood options -- Salmon, Prawns, Shrimp Dumplings, Noodles, Monk Fish, etc.  My father who would have just have rather ordered the Ribs or Lamb Shank joined us in going the no meat route and said that ""this was the best Lenten meal I've ever had in my life""....coming from a guy who does not give compliments easily and never gets too excited over skipping out on red meat.  Nice work to all the staff at Embeya!!  Thanks Attila and Komal for making our dining experience one to remember!",0.9804,0.773,0.155,0.072,0.542609126984127

2013-02-17,4.0,"Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of Asian fusion. It's typically too difficult for a restaurant to fancify this kind of food to a level where the influence is still recognizable, but merits spending 2-3 times what one would spend in an ethnic neighborhood. I find that Asian cuisines tend to be at their best when served in environments that make you question how recently the health inspector has paid a visit. There are exceptions to every rule, however, one of which is Embeya - this is the rare gussied-up Asian joint that hits the mark.  The theme here is upscale Vietnamese-influenced food. Summer rolls ($9) are filled with sumptuous pork belly and are served with a spicy peanut dipping sauce that merits eating on its own off of chopsticks. Tongue ($12) is served with a melange of picked vegetables, candied orange, and watercress - a delicate amalgamation of flavors that play surprisingly well with one another. Ribs ($18) are served in hefty portions, and are glazed in a piquant tamarind sauce which manages to be just sweet enough. They're somewhat difficult to eat, but tasty. Side vegetables are simply prepared with interesting twists - brussels sprouts ($6) are roasted to a pleasant crisp and served with fish sauce, and cauliflower ($6) is served with red chili and topped with a lava-y one hour poached egg. For dessert, grilled pineapple ($7) is served with chili salt and coconut ice cream - a perfect, if somewhat lilliputian cap to an excellent meal.  Pricing is high but not exorbitant for the caliber of food. Service is somewhat awkward - our waiter forgot to bring the whiskey list when I asked, which added 10 minutes or so of waiting, and then gave me a hairy eyeball when I asked for the check while ordering dessert. Cocktails are alright but somewhat watery and not worth $12. Had these last two factors been on par with the food, Embeya may well have earned a five star rating from me. As it stands, Embeya offers an excellent dining experience; unlike most other Asian fusion restaurants, I didn't spend my meal here thinking about how I'd rather be dining on Canal or Argyle for a fraction of the cost. I'd highly recommend it!",0.9952,0.823,0.153,0.025,0.5260612244897959

I usually prefer smaller, quieter restaurants but I loved what they did with the space here.  Perfect, chic, neutral decor.  It felt open and light, bursting with energy but in a way that's appropriate for dinner.  It was loud but we didn't have to yell to hear each other.  Again, all around pleasant.

I think the most disappointing things, was the waiter was never around to tell us about the food.  The ""exotic fruit"" was super exotic and delicious but we had no clue what we were eating...and to find anyone to answer any question it was pretty much impossible.

The service...although our server was super nice...I felt a little neglected in the corner table that we were at.  My friend would have probably had at least two more drinks if we would have had our server come over more and check.  It was almost like we were flagging him down.  To his defense, we were chatting it up, but its his job to see if we need anything.

2013-01-27,4.0,"Embeya is a sexy city dining experience, Asian chic, with a touch of whimsy. Progressive and contemporary, the food is served tapas-style (small portions to be share at the table). The clientele is a mix of urban sophisticates and suburban executives, with a sprinkle of poseur hipsters and Jersey Shore wannabes. Our party of six was given the option of ordering our choices from a variety of amazing dishes to share, or the ""Sample Tray,"" which is a selection of dishes offered at Embeya, chosen at the whim of the servers. I do not eat gluten, and our server, John, assured us that they could make most dishes gluten-free. We were lazy and chose to try Embeya's ""Sample Tray,"" gluten-free.   We ordered our drinks to start. I had the Sato Zuke, a delightful, delicious ginger/gin beverage with an amazing kick. The wine selection was expansive and one of our friends, a wine connoisseur, was very impressed. (I was very impressed by the sommelier, but for my own reasons).   The hot and cold appetizers started to arrive at our table -- delicious, delectable bites of wonderful --two-to-three dishes at a time. So many came so quickly that I soon lost track of everything I tried, but I do remember specific dishes such as the fried oysters (to DIE for), juicy, flavorful prawns; baby octopus with grapefruit; firm, fresh, cured salmon (yum yum yum) and my favorite, lettuce wrapped balls of exquisite oral orgasms (I don't remember what they were; shrimp dumplings, I think. I sort of blacked out while eating them and fantasizing about the sommelier).    Stuffed on appetizers, we were alarmed to learn that a lot more food was coming in the form of entrees.  We all ordered more drinks (two each that evening) as the servers expertly cleared our dishes and filled our water glasses.   After my second drink arrived, things started happening very quickly. Food came flying at us from all directions, assisted by numerous servers. At one point our table was surrounded by efficient, friendly people bringing us the most amazing platters of artistically created masterpieces: lamb shank (I didn't get to try it - too full); ribs tamarind (expertly seasoned and prepared, according to my date); melt-in-my-mouth monkfish, with rice noodles and creamy, tasty curry sauce; quail, with an amazingly simple yet magical sauce; chicken that tasted like cage-free heaven; sticky and fried rice, and a variety of vegetables. Whew! I was in a food coma but quickly snapped out of it when the check was put before us. With tip, the total was $120 per person.  We soon realized was that ""sample"" doesn't mean smaller bites of everything; the quantity of food and the price we ultimately paid seemed to suggest that ""sample"" means full-size plates of everything on the menu. The sticker shock didn't take away from the amazing experience of the food, or the beautiful ambience, or the professional friendly efficiency of our servers.

Asian fusion.  Very, VERY good, well-thought out Asian fusion.  Chef Thai just killed this menu.  Thai style mussels.  Need I say more?? (Oh yeah, and the prices are VERY reasonable for what you get.  This meal would be MUCH more and WAY douchier in River North.  just sayin...) 2.  The decor is classy but very welcoming.  I LOVE that they left the loft ceiling, it just adds something to the ambiance in the dining room.  The kitchen is open and some guests were walking up and talking to the kitchen staff and they were very warm and friendly. 3.  The drink menu and bar staff are on point!  Danielle, the drink coordinator was fantastic and nailed the flavors.  I got one made of beets (I'm a sucker for beets, what can I say??) and it was delicious.  They were polite and didn't fuss when we wanted to make small changes to the drinks (no gin in this house, sowwy) which can be a problem when you mess with someone's specialty drinks sometimes.  David, the bartender was attentive and welcoming and didn't hover.  The SAs were also on their game which can make or break a dining experience. 4.  The neighborhood.  We used to live over here and we just love the vibe in this area.  It's close to everything but it lacks a certain hustle and bustle and it leaves out all pretentiousness.  Important note: it takes a special kind of place to pop up a few doors down from my favorite place, Sepia, and not offend me with it's inferiority.  I'm not gonna lie, I'm usually defensive as hell and ready to hate on anyone willing to challenge Sepia's Fulton River District reign.  However, I must say: Well done, team.  Well done. 5.  The music.  I'm VERY picky about when it is and isn't appropriate to use good alt rock in a dining establishment.  This is one of those places that it is fancy enough to come here for a special evening out, but they add small touches to make it work.  FOR EXAMPLE: they do striped shirts rather than white ones, they left the ceiling lofty, etc.  Those small things take the fancy edge off and make it all, just, fit.

Went to Embeya last night for a friend's belated birthday celebration, per usual I am early so I am greeted very warmly by the hostess and then settle in at the bar. At the suggestion of the bartender I ordered the Sato Zuke. I loved it. Please note at this point my drink was served with a lime, which was delicious. The other seven ladies show up and we sit down. From the beginning our server seemed to hate us. I roll with a somewhat high maintenance group of women but I swear we didn't do anything overly annoying  to deserve the genuine disgust with which our server treated us. I mean it. I generally have decent self-esteem but right from the start I got the impression from his angry glare that he HATED us.  From that moment we arrived, cocktails took 15-20 minutes to show up and our server never cleared a dish. We had to ask the food runners to take completely empty plates and glasses off of our table to make space. We couldn't even ask our server to do this because he was never at our table long to get the words out. Twice he asked if we wanted more drinks and then actually walked away before anyone could answer. And we weren't taking a long time to respond, he just asked and immediately walked off. It was weird.  I am a relaxed person when it comes to service, I used to be a waitress and I understand that dealing with big groups of distracted girls can suck.  I know it's a hard job. I cut people quite a bit of slack, but this was actually uncomfortable. Eventually the Sato Zukes started showing up with lemons, which everyone agreed was gross and ruined the drink. Did they really run out of limes or was this a plot by our angry server to ruin our fun? We may never know.  Also, it was Thursday night and the restaurant was not even close to full at 7:00 and it never filled completely up while we were there. So unless they were understaffed I can't understand our server's big hurry and the long wait for drinks ordered.  So. The food.  We had a ton of food. Mussels, Cauliflower, and Cream Puff were HUGE hits at my table. Noodles, Ribs, Fried Oysters, Summer rolls, & Garlic Chicken were just okay.  At the end of our meal, someone who I assume was the manager (or perhaps just a concerned citizen) came by and asked us how it was. We told him fairly candidly that the service was lacking. I could tell he felt really awful about this. He brought us a free round of drinks and was extremely apologetic. Kudos to Embeya for checking in on us, I doubt we would have said anything unless asked. The sweet hostess also worked her tail off getting our valeted cars to the door quickly and without issue in the pouring rain so we had a very nice exit with lots of love from the staff.  Overall, the space was beautiful and food good.  I am going to assume that the service issue was a weird one off thing with our server. Maybe he was having a bad night or maybe someone in my group kicked him in the balls when I wasn't looking? Who knows.  Regardless, I give the rest of the staff a lot of credit for trying to make up for it and would go back.",-0.906,0.78,0.101,0.118,0.5777049062049062
2013-01-10,4.0,"Had a fabulous dinner last night at Embeya, am close to tipping this to the 5-star :) I really loved the food, had fantastic service and I love the decor. I went with my monthly dinner club and it was a group of 6. MUST TRY: Green Papaya Salad - a must try, not your average papaya salad and the texture and favors were great Mussels - So rare to get a good lemongrass flavor. Our server also recod' the rice with the mussels to sop up the broth! Oxtail w. curry - Yum and the curry is delish Sakura - I know they change their menu but if this is on their when you go you HAVE to get it. Well cooked, delicious, very authentic Cauliflower - with a poached egg - YES Fried Rice - Something that looks so simple (no meat/veg) has really complex and delicious savory flavor Pineapple/coconut ice cream dessert - YES. The diff textures of the grilled pineapple, cool creamy coconut and crunchy peanuts was so good Cream Puff - Not your average cream puff, this is something to remember. JUST OK: Shimp dumplings and oysters were ok, not special, a little forgettable RIBS - WEre talked up a lot but just OK to me. They were definitely tasty but nothing made them stand out to other ribs I've had.  So, notice the must try list far outweighting the just ok list :) Also the cocktails were delicious. The vodka/coconut cocktail I had was so light and refreshing! Plus I got a chance to meet the owners, Attila was working the hostess stand and was such a gracious host. Gave us tons of insight on the decor, I also asked about the very sexy stemware! Hope to see this place to continue to do well and can't wait to go back!",0.9979,0.729,0.259,0.013,0.6484788359788359

As we pulled on Sepia's dramatic wooden doors, however, we came to find that we were locked out (despite the fact that several diners were sitting warmly inside, waiting to order). We turned to walk back when I noticed a new restaurant I had never heard of before. Inside Embeya, people looked warm, happy, and well-fed, so we decided to give it a try. It was the best dining risk I have taken thus far in Chicago! Excellent customer service, knowledgeable staff, and extremely reasonable price points, considering the quality of the menu. We skipped wine that night, but tried the squash starter, split the tofu and quail entrees (best quail I have ever had), and finished with the ever-adventurous Durian fruit. I will continue to recommend this place to friends and family, as I know it will impress even the pickiest of diners.",0.9766,0.829,0.162,0.009,0.5596590909090909

2013-01-04,3.0,"Embeya - Executive chef Thai Dang's childhood nickname which means ""little one"" in Vietnamese took this ""little"" corner space and approached it with a wide range of modern-day Asian décor. The chic space designed by 555 International (they also dressed up Girl and the goat, GT Fish, Balena) and they did a marvelous job. The four breathtaking soft, ivories, air floating chandlers lined the waiting area's ceiling.  The entire space was sealed with off white hardwood floor which created a great canvas to showcase the furniture and the use of calm and warm colors of green, wood, and gray. The bar's counter is white marble, open kitchen, light pencil wood color chairs lined in leather, and a stunning installation of floating glasslike leaves as a chandler piece in the private dining space.  I was with a group of four including myself and we went there on a Friday night at 9:00 pm. The staff's mannerism was very accommodating and pleasant. The receptionist immediately asked if we prefer coat check before walking us to our table.  Now let's get down to food business. First is first: COCKTAILS.  Death of Reposado - aged tequila, Thai chili, pomelo, and shiso foam Tendron & Lim - vodka, young coconut water, citrus, caramelized coconut skewer  Jackfruit cultivar - cacha, all spice, jackfruit cordial, lemon  To tell you the truth of all the three drinks I enjoyed Deathof Reposado the best. Maybe it's because I'm on this ""chili"" in my crafted cocktail kick. The Tendron & Lim was too light for me to drink during the winter; I preferred a spicy and hardy drink during this time of the year. Although, my gf enjoyed it!  Small plates: Cuttlefish, Forbidden Rice,  Large plates:  Thit Heo Kho (quail egg, coconut, roasted shallots), Ribs, noodles On the side: Steamed rice, butternut squash, and Brussels sprouts  Sad to say I was not extremely expressed with the food. As much as I loved the atmosphere and the space I couldn't fall in love with the entrees.  The flavors were strong and savory but small plates of home cooked Asian recipes just didn't do it for me.

2012-12-26,3.0,"I was really psyched when Embeya opened, given my love of Southeast Asian cuisine and the pedigree of the chef.  We just went for dinner on sunday night, when they have a special menu - simple sunday.  I think this may have been a mistake.  Embeya was ok, but fell short of its promise. Let's start with the good.  The room is terrific - wide open spaces, not too loud, and very comfortable.  Lot's of interesting reclaimed architectural touches throughout the room.  Service was terrific, and when there was one momentary service lapse (a drink got held up at the bar for a few minutes) they comped us the drink without being asked by us.  Top notch!  You really see the character of a place when things go wrong, not when they go right.  Embeya is a class act. Perhaps the highlight for me was a truly fantastic cocktail called ""Death of Reposado.""  I kid you not, this is an amazing concoction that I am still thinking about.  It's kind of a margarita reimagined for Asia.  Tequila, Shiso, Pomelo, Egg whites, and Chilis.  Love it - the chilis and the peppery tequila are a great combination. The food was a bit of a mixed bag.  Let's run down the menu: 1) Green Papaya Salad - kind of a soggy, muddled mess.  The flavors were not crisp and I had a hard time finding anything to distinguish this salad.  Normally this dish should sing with a multitude of flavors.   2) Shrimp Dumpling.  Very nice, and with a nice snap which is due to (I believe) the chef adding some nuts to the filling.  This may have been my favorite dish, 3) Noodles - stir fried udon with Shrimp.  Again, the flavors were very muddled and the dish over sauced and soggy.  Flavorwise nothing to distinguish this one. 4) Barbequed Ribs - Nice and tender with a nice crust.  This dish was fine, but again, nothing interesting going on and very typical flavors.  No bad, but not interesting. 5) Brussels Spouts.  With Nuoc Cham.   This one was terrific.  Great flavors, very tender sprouts and a unique preperation.  The sweetness of the sauce blended well with the sharpness of the sprouts.  Good show. I'll try Embeya again because the highlights - cocktails, service, and a few of the dishes - give me hope that on a regular night the kitchen can turn out more of the highlights we experienced and avoid the muddled sameness of some of the Sunday night dishes.",0.9982,0.704,0.235,0.06,0.5882745032745034

The menu is rather limited, but I must admit that all of the items we ordered were quite tasty. I should also follow that, though, by letting you know that for the size of the dishes the prices are quite steep.  We ordered the green papaya salad, grilled quail, and scallops. Everything was presented very beautifully with defined grill marks on the quail and the scallops on flaming fire. The papaya salad was average but the quail was really delicate yet strong in flavor. The scallops had a nice taste but the texture was a bit too under-cooked for my liking. My favorite dish of the night wasn't even a main dish we had ordered but it was the japjae glass noodles topped with uni that accompanied the scallops. It was absolutely to die for. I've never experienced that combination before, but they were so flattering together.  We each had a glass of wine, a personalized cocktail that a bartender let us name (the 'Hudson' - we wanted to keep the theme of celebrities and it reminded us of Kate Hudson), and whiskey shot  with kimchi as a chaser. I had asked if they had pickle juice to chase since I have been hearing all about it, but they said no and pulled out kimchi juice. It was great.  The only complaint that I have about Embeya is that one of the bartenders was a bit pushy. Although he was friendly, it felt as if he was constantly trying to convince you to buy more for a possibly larger tip.

Came here with a girlfriend from the rec on Tasting Table.  She was a little late and I was a little early, so I spent the time checking out the menu, the space, and the kitchen.  Front of house was super friendly and professional; David took my coat (I'm still getting used to this coat business, oh Chicago.  Oh it's cold here.  Oh my.) and the hostess took me to a table so I could peek at the open kitchen.  Love the decor and details.  It was pretty empty when I came in (around 6 on a Wednesday night) but filled up to half-full or so by the time we left. Started with one of the cocktails, like a Moscow Mule but with way more ginger.  Quite tasty and refreshing, loved the lime.  It took my drink a while to come over, but there wasn't anything going on over at the bar that I could see.  Maybe it just takes a long time to make?  My friend ended up getting the same thing and it also took hers a long time. Anyway, FOOD: loved the mussels, tons of spicy lemongrass and creamy coconut broth.  Friend said they were the best mussels she'd ever had.  I also really enjoyed them.  Wish there was bread to sop up the delicious sauce; we were uncivilized and just drank it!  Yum!   Also enjoyed the green papaya, which was thinly shredded with a delicate and sour dressing, some basil leaves (could've used more, I think), some beef jerky bits, and those tasty fried onions.  Pretty big portion, as were the mussels!  A good start! I loved the fried rice, with bits of char and oil and just I don't know why it was so yummy it is just yummy and you should try it.  It's not how you normally think of fried rice with tons of stuff in it, just rice with some flavor magically put in it.   Garlic chicken... sort of disappointed.  Very garlicky, and I liked the little medallions mixing white and dark meat, but it was just a bit too dry.  Least strong part of our meal. We were way too full by the end, so two apps and an entree seems like a good size for two.  All the food is family style, which is important to remember, except for maybe the scallop, which is $12 for one scallop which is on fire!  We did not have it, but saw some people get it.  I was happy dishing out $12 for my cocktail, did not need to do that for a single scallop, no matter how good that scallop is. With tax, ended up being $50, and I totally think we got our money's worth.  Love love how beautiful the place is. Starstruckness: as we were leaving, got into conversation with David, who was managing the front with/under Attila (the owner?).  And then he took us back and introduced us to Thai!  Aaaaaaah!  That's never happened to me before!  It was so cool!  I'm such a fangirl!  Didn't even know what to say, so just started talking about Vietnam and how I liked the food.   Overall, my impression is 'fancy Vietnamese' rather than 'midscale pan-asian', but whatever floats your boat!  Tasty and beautiful!",0.9993,0.747,0.229,0.024,0.579835164835165

The bartender took quite a while to serve us, we waited a good 5-7 minutes. However, there were not that many people there, so I didn't see a reason as to why it took such a while.

They seem to have a tea approach to serving, which worked well and felt friendly and was more efficient. It's family style, which was nice because it allowed us to try more. The papaya salad, as others have said, was very good, and was probably my favorite dish. It reminded me of papaya salad I had at a farmers market in Hawaii. The shrimp dumplings were crispy on the outside, but soft almost to runniness on the inside, and I didn't love that. My friend, however, liked that consistency. The short rib appetizer was fine, but nothing special or memorable. The garlic chicken is nicely plated, and the chicken medallions are interesting, but I found the dish lacking in flavor, and my friend and I agreed it could have used a sauce. We got the friend rice, which was nice, more interesting than plain white rice, but not a strong, soy-flavored fried rice. We shared the fruit bowl for dessert, which was nice and light after a filling dinner. They have an open kitchen, which is a nice touch.

That someone was Danielle, and our night couldn't have turned out better!  OUR DINNER  We started the night sharing ""cold"" Green Papaya (which a very exotic salad dish with outstanding flavors) and ""hot"" Sea Snails (stuffed with pork) both small plates were very well done! From presentation to taste absolutely flawless! But then our hearts were stolen by their version of the Pork Belly, which comes with creamy quail eggs and out of this world sauce, that you can mix with your choice of rice and ...oh so yummy! We called Pork Belly ""Gangman Style""!  The list of the after dinner drinks (and wine) was also very extensive and then we learned about exotic deserts and fruit Danielle presented us with a bowl of longan (the amazing fruit we never saw prior to last night) their pineapple desert that consisted of marinated fruit, house-made ice-cream, toasted nuts and a touch of chili peppers provided a real explosion of flavors. With this said, we were impressed with their wine list and a VERY interesting menu.  ATMOSPHERE  Danielle Pizzutillo, is the star of the house. She somehow manages to attend to everyone at the bar with each of us feeling that she is there just for us. She mixes the most exotic cocktails based on your preferences and her wine expertise is practically unbeatable! However, based on the comments from other waiters and happy guests, their entire staff consists of wine experts and food enthusiasts.   Aside from great service and knowledgeable & yet approachable staff, this place is absolutely gorgeous. This trendy contemporary space has great lighting and comfortable furnishings. From their luxuries restrooms to unique light fixtures - everything is top notch! $10 valet is very convenient  We can't wait to return! Love this place!",0.9986,0.739,0.244,0.017,0.6363038277511963
2012-10-30,4.0,Normally avoid restaurants with food I regard as complicated.  I prefer ingredients that I have tried before to avoid any problems.  Went to a business dinner on a Monday night and the restaurant was not too busy.  They were advised to bring us a selection of the chef's choices and I found all but the sweetbreads (which I chose to avoid) very satisfying.

2012-10-25,3.0,"How many swanky new places in river west/fulton market can arrive at once? And when they arrive is there any self restraint to not check them out? Not at all. The most recent addition is Embeya, described as progressive Asian cuisine. The first impression when you walk in is amazing. The space is beautiful with delicate and detailed ornamentation all around. Great bar space, smooth and sexy all around. Dining room feels smaller than it is I'm sure. One thing I didn't love was the use of all windows around two sides of the building. You end up starting at street lamp lights, billboards, and anything else that could distract you from the meal and people you're with. I also remember the noise level being quite loud until the place emptied out a bit.  I really like the approach and design of the menu. (One downer is that they ran out of the chicken dish that everyone has been raving about). It's divided into three simple sections: cold, hot, large plates. There's also sides, rice and vegetables. We dove right in and starting ordering things that looked good. We started with the recommended green papaya salad, with spaghetti like shaved papaya, shallots and beef jerky. Really like the sauce with that, a nice and interesting dish. There was also special rice (?) with radish and pear and seared scallop (it only came with one, cut into three pieces which was a major annoyance that we weren't prepared for - and it's expensive). The glass noodles with the scallop were also delicious. That was our favorite of the three even though we each had one very small bite - and loved the presentation with a flaming mound served under the shell. The rice dish was just ok and the shaved vegetable was nice and refreshing in a sweet Asian sauce.  The main dishes and sides we ordered were sort of hit or miss and slightly more disappointing than the starters. We tried the beef short ribs, big noodles, fish (don't remember which), with a side of bamboo. I really enjoyed the spicy noodle with shrimp. Highly recommended. The fish was totally blah and the bamboo interesting with a nice sauce. The short ribs were not so much. Very fatty pieces of meat and disappointing texture/flavor/etc. Avoid. The dessert of sticky rice and mango was fantastic and possibly the tastiest thing of the evening.  All around the experience was good and fun but there are a lot of ups and downs. Really like the space but don't love the sound level and street view. The menu had some nice items and some just meh items too. Service was good but the bill was pretty high for what we experienced (and only one scallop!). All around it's a cool spot and worth checking out. I'd probably go back to check out the chicken and also realize that it has been open a few weeks and has a lot of potential (and shut those blinds).",0.9913,0.817,0.138,0.045,0.5996488071812749

We were making bets on the over/under of this place lasting over a year.   The competition is fierce in the West Loop.   It is in the same price range as Avec, Sepia, Province, and the Publican.   All of those spots are vastly superior.   I am shocked by so many positive reviews.   Perhaps it was an off night, or people were enchanted by the beautiful space.    Anyways, I wouldn't recommend it but if you really are curious to try it, I would hurry, because this place wouldn't hold up in the West Loop where the bar is consistently rising in the fine dining space.",0.9136,0.848,0.097,0.055,0.5417069310617698

Lots of people talking and having a great time, but not so loud you can't carry a conversation. Food is served family style, where you can share with your group. I would HIGHLY recommend: - Green Papaya: I am not a huge citrus fan but this was a very different presentation. The papaya is shaved very thin like noodles, and the sauce is the perfect level of spicy. Mix in some beef jerky, bam! This dish rocked so much, we ordered two of them. - Mussels: dollar for dollar this was the best buy of the night. They bring out a giant bowl of mussels, and the sauce was outstanding. My only request is that they include some breads so that we could have soaked up the delicious sauce once all the mussels were gone. - Garlic chicken: very nice and straightforward dish, but still delicious. - Kona Kanapachi: seared sashimi grade tuna, served in a fun checkerboard style. The tuna was tasty, but it's worth ordering just for the presentation. On the not so great side, I think you can skip the salmon (pretty plain) and ribs (too chewy). Also, the desserts weren't great. My only other complaint, and the reason I didn't give 5 stars, was that the service was spotty. We had trouble tracking down our waiter multiple times and they don't keep your wine at your table. Hence, we got parched which wasn't cool. I assume that service will improve once the restaurant gets a few months of operations under their belt.

Highlights of the night included sea snails (ask the server about the story behind how the chef came up with the concept), scallops, and young bamboo.  I enjoyed the cocktails as well, which overall were on the lighter side (a nice complement to any dish).  I had the Purple Prunus, which I enjoyed.  I'd like to try some of the other ""Asian infused"" drinks next time I go.",0.9827,0.797,0.191,0.012,0.5402631578947369

It is quickly becoming the place to dine, people watch and just have fun over cocktails with a few friends.  I pretty much tried everything on the menu and have to say that it is hard to pick favorites.  Mussels in coconut broth are so delicate and flavorful that I must rate them as my #1 favorite.  If you order them, make sure you ask for sticky rice which you can then dip into the broth to finish it.  Every drop of it is enticing and hard to leave in a pot, in which mussels are served.  Papaya salad is a must have along with the garlic chicken. Have some exotic fruit to round up the meal and you will be coming back for more of Embeya's textures and flavors!

2012-10-13,3.0,"Beautiful interior design in a large, expansive space, but sadly this beauty was only skin deep. To be perfectly honest, many of the criticisms in prior reviews are apt.  It took about 30-40 minutes to seat us after our reservation.  We got cocktails at the bar while waiting, which were excellent, novel, and refreshing, but very unsubstantial for the cost. Three pieces of ice, three sips, $12. When we were finally seated, the service was glacially slow, and we were warned that several menu items were unavailable to order.  Our server was unhelpful and actually taken aback when I said I was a vegetarian -- shouldn't this be a common situation in fine dining?   I ordered a few non-meat sides and some rice. First, heirloom radish served on a bed of underseasoned wheatberry -- with oversalted cashews. Gorgeous presentation, but lacking substance. Next, maitake mushrooms, which were perfectly seared and textured, but whose taste was overpowered by salt, and then overseasoned with soy. The japanese eggplant dish was good, with a smoky hibachi taste. The fried rice was a good accompaniment with a delicate texture, but really was overpoweringly aromatic -- unfortunately the pungent taste lingered in my mouth even after dessert.   My omnivore friend ordered a scallop dish which was brought out on an elegant flaming bed, and served with tasty sweet potato noodles (think japchae-style). Next, the pork belly entree which was quite rich and fatty, but served with ultra *chalky* overcooked hard-boiled quail eggs.  The entire experience lasted 3 hours -- not because we were savoring our food -- but because it took so long for the waitstaff to interact with us at every step. When we politely mentioned we had been waiting for our rice, the busser announced that she could only carry 3 dishes -- and then we waited about 30 minutes to receive our rice. We were excited by the chef's Ria/L2O pedigree, but unfortunately Embeya does not meet the bar.  I really wanted to like this place, and hope to return when they have their act together -- I hope these initial problems are just growing pains.",0.9967,0.745,0.201,0.053,0.5716318234610916
2012-10-12,3.0,"I've heard a lot of raves on Embeya before I made my way there.  Now I'm beginning to wonder... The décor is nice.  It's not as transformative as say, GT F&O, or Girl and the Goat, but nice touches throughout.  Service is friendly and well-oiled for a place this new.  One particular server smiles warmly and shakes everyone's hand if you happen to be in his path. Enough has been said and written about the green papaya salad.  I will just chime in and say that it is definitely a knock out.  Sea snails are fun and interesting.  I do think though that the snails itself is lost among all the other things in the dish.  Young bamboo and maitake is like a forest floor, but tasty.  Thit Heo Kho, a pork belly stew, transported me back to my childhood.  Mother used to make the Chinese version that is always a treat for me.  The coconut notes were new to me, and made me see this dish in a new light. So now, the head scratcher.  When our waiter was going through his routine, we were told the only dish they were out of was the chicken.  Fine, that wasn't a must try for me anyway.  So well into our meal, a party was seated close to our table.  Some time later, a plate of chicken came out and landed at their table.  What was that? Why 3 stars?  From the look and feel of the place, and the clientele, Embeya could be any pan-Asian party restaurant Chicago has seen a few of (Sunda, and many before it).  At Embeya, the food is definitely a lot more serious and interesting.  I won't say it's the best, but a good addition to the scene.  Not really sure what is up with the Chicken story.  At the end of the night, Attila was sending port to all tables.  I suppose that made it better.",0.9974,0.769,0.218,0.013,0.5199272133095661

The cuisine is pretty spot on classic vietnamese... no matter how much it's trying to elevate the cuisine, the basic flavors are all very classic vietnamese.  The ingredients are fresh and are high quality.  All servings are meant to share.

What I liked: - Papaya salad:  the papaya was cut very delicately lending to a great medium to hold on to that delicious sauce - Short rib wraps:  had tasted this at the green city market and taste of the nation this year, so knew this would be a hit.   Desserts were really great:  mango sticky rice and silken tofu flan Service was good overall, attentive but not intrusive.

From the moment you walk in, you see Attila Gyulai, one half of Embeya, making his rounds through the restaurant, welcoming tables and ensuring their dining experiences are on par. If you have ever had the opportunity to stay at the Elysian (now the Waldorf-Astoria), you can understand the attention to detail that has been translated here. The decor is clean and chic. The extensive use of wooden elements accentuates the modern, Bali-esque design of the restaurant.  It has already been mentioned many times, but the cocktails are fantastic. A spear of pickled jackfruit or a strip of homemade fruit roll-up, every drink is unique, but still very much balanced. (My husband says his sazerac is phenomenal but I'll take him at his word and stick to my jackfruit cultivar.) The small and large shared plates are, of course, the highlights of the night. We had the Green Papaya Salad, the boat Scallop (which also came with a side of really fresh uni), the Short Rib lettuce wraps, the Garlic Chicken, and the Thit Heo Kho (not for the conservative pioneer of cuisines, as it is a very traditional dish). After the meal, we finally understood the difference between ""Progressive Asian Cuisine"" and the ever-popular ""Asian fusion"" - Embeya rightfully labels itself as the former.  Every one of the dishes we selected did not pretend to be anything other than authentic. Authentic and spot-on delicious.

When I hear ""family style"" I think of large plates with portions for everyone.  When I hear sharing plates, I think of much smaller portions where you get one or two bites per plate.  This is definitely the latter.  Don't expect big bowls of anything for family style, not even the noodles.

Here, traditional Southeast Asian ingredients are used and transformed into its own interpretation without compromising the authenticity of the cuisine. Firstly, when our server came to our table, he greeted us personally by last name. Well, actually he greeted my husband first by saying, ""Mr P..?"" We made our reservation on OpenTable so that gave it away but this personal touch definitely made a difference. From what I read on food websites, the director of Embeya used to work at the Elysian Hotel and the executive chef used to be with L20, Ria so they must have carried forward some of the hospitality traits to Embeya. Our server took the time to explain the menu and described in detail the preparation and execution of some of the highlights. He didn't rush through explaining the menu unlike other places where the server might just be regurgitating what they had memorized. The jackfruit cocktail was wonderful-- definitely something that I will order again. It came with a piece of fresh jackfruit, something that I used to eat all the time while living in Southeast Asia as it's one of the very popular street fruits. I've hardly seen jackfruit in Chicago (except the canned ones in Chinatown but those are not the real deal) so Embeya is definitely opening up the vast world of Southeast Asian to Chicago. We were told that the green papaya salad is especially dear to the chef's heart as he grew up in Vietnam. The interpretation of this dish was meant to appear like a noodle salad. Unripened papaya is shredded until they look like fine long noodles and then tossed. We enjoyed the green papaya very much and the different flavors balanced each other out. The banana blossom was definitely interesting but given that it has a slight bitter taste to it, it's definitely something that I am only able to enjoy in small portions. The sea snails were so beautiful! It wasn't just eating plain snails like you would for escargots. Instead, it was ground and mixed with pork. After you pick the meat out from the shell, don't forget the bit of ""au jus"" left in the shell. The stuffed squid was very tender as well. Loved, loved the sticky rice and reminds us of just like those we've had in Southeast Asia. Ah.... for dessert we had the fruit platter: fresh jackfruit, lychee, and longan. Again, Embeya does a great job in showcasing the essence of Southeast Asia. These are popular street foods there... and we just cracked open the lychee and longan skin, popped the fruit into our mouths, spitted out the seed, and then enjoyed them while pretending we were in Southeast Asia except that we were really sitting inside the beautiful space of Embeya.",0.9988,0.792,0.201,0.007,0.5037825696316262
2012-09-19,5.0,"Subtle and delicious.  Embeya is a wonderful addition to the east end of restaurant row on Randolph. My wife and I went their for our second anniversary and were delighted by the high ceilings, beautiful finishes and incredible food. This place definitely steps up Chicago's game a bit as it is owned and run by a veteran of the Four Seasons and Elysian Hotel. The menu is helmed by a chef that understands how to bring out powerful and rich flavors in simple dishes. The care and quality is undeniable. It is also shockingly affordable. We shall return, often.",0.9781,0.748,0.237,0.015,0.6431428571428572
2012-09-19,5.0,"Easily one of the top 10 restaurants in Chicago. On a whim, my husband and I decided to celebrate our 2nd anniversary at Embeya after we ran into the owner Attila Gyulai - of Four Seasons and Elysian fame - earlier the same day. The Asian inspired menu is a fantastic fusion of both gourmet and comfort foods. Our six course meal was served family style.  Every dish was a unique presentation of beautiful, authentic flavors, prepared in a new and different way.  It's been a long while since I've been so impressed with Asian food outside of Asia. Cocktails were equally impressive.  Embeya's mixologist uses fresh and uncommon ingredients such as rye soaked plums, smoked heirloom tomatoes, and shiso leaf foam to create really delicate and delicious cocktails.  And the space!  It's beautiful!  Sky high ceilings; simple, elegant base with really special, ornate details and finishes - it is is lavish without being over the top.  A big dinner, dessert and four cocktails later I was sure our bill would be a bit pricey. Surprisingly, it was very reasonable.   So excited to have Embeya in our neighborhood. We are fast becoming regulars, I'm sure!",0.9959,0.71,0.29,0.0,0.6141902103744211
2012-09-17,5.0,"Since Embeya opened last week, I've been back 3 times.  I love the food, atmosphere, and the service.  I keep coming back and bringing new friends.  Everything from the decor to the staff makes me feel so comfortable that I never want to leave.  And the food is certainly amazing!!!!  I love the mussels, sea snails, thit heo kho, and the scallops.  To think of it, i love everything on the menu.  To top this off, the drinks were amazing especially the jack fruit drink...yum yum.  I would definitely recommend this place to everyone.  It's a great place for friends or family to come in and dine.",0.9915,0.66,0.331,0.009,0.547943722943723
2012-09-15,4.0,"My boyfriend and I live a few blocks away and we were excited to try this new restaurant.  We eat out a lot love trying new places.   The highlights for me were the thit heo kho (pork belly with hard boiled quail eggs), the scallop, and also the vodka and coconut water cocktail.  I had two cocktails and probably could have had like 3 or 4 more, they were so good!  I have been craving another one for the past few days.   For the entrees we had the pork ribs and the ribeye, and they were both very good.  The service was excellent and we really enjoyed the ambiance.  I will definitely go back to try other items on the menu.",0.9765,0.773,0.202,0.025,0.4816098484848485
2012-09-12,5.0,"Managed to snag a table opening night at this incredible spot!  They seated us in full view of the open kitchen where we were able to see all the action that went into creating our Incredible food.  We started with the vegetable tempura that's served with chicken liver and were blown away.  The green payapa salad was fresh and bright.  Here the sides are strong enough to take center stage.  We tried the young bamboo, Japanese eggplant, and Chinese long bean and were fighting for the last morsels of all three.  As a devoted carnivore dining with a vegetarian friend, I have to say this is one of the only spots in town that I really felt I didn't miss anything!  That being said, I already have reservations for next week to try everything else.  Embeya certainly takes Asian cuisine to new heights of sophistication and I'm very much looking forward to my next visit.",0.9501,0.854,0.131,0.015,0.41580669330669323
2012-09-12,4.0,"Delicious dining experience that came to a great surprise! I live in the area and have been watching this mystery restaurant construct all summer.  Never in my crazy imagination did I think that I could call opening day and make a reservation for the second day they were open for dinner at 7pm but I got a table.  Draw back was there was no menu to tease my taste buds with at work before going in....forgive me for relying on memory on what I ate! To start this space is very open and welcoming.  I was surprised to see that it was pretty empty but think it will grow to popularity in due time. I had the shrimp dumplings, scallops, Chinese long beans and noodle and shrimp dish.  Ending with the green tea cream puff.  The shrimp dumpling laying on a leaf of lettuce was my favorite starter. Full of great Asian flavors.  The scallop had a great kick and bite topped with a jalapeno and a magical presentation with a electric blue flame.  The long beans were light and spicy perfectly crisp with every bite.  The noodles and shrimp pretty good with plenty of seafood and noodles done just right.  Finally the green tea cream puff sounded a bit scary but the flavors of vanilla bean shines through and is delectable!  The only criticism to the dessert was that the puff was not so puffy but more of a tough outer shell.  I was scared I would have made it fly across the table if I cut into it with the sad spoon I was given to eat it with.  Either way I didn't leave a crumb on the plate it was a unique and different variety to the usual options. I will definitely be back around the corner to this spot to taste test the cocktails they have to offer.",0.9885,0.731,0.179,0.09,0.5990178571428572
2012-09-11,4.0,"Delicious. Exquisite presentations. Embeya opened tonight to a relatively muted night in the West Loop, but I'm glad it's finally here. My friend and I devoured the scallop with peanut noodles and uni, which was one of the more inventive, memorable dishes I've had in a while. We liked the kona kampachi and the cote de beouf with pommes and watercress, and really enjoyed our complimentary desserts, though by that point in the night, we were way too full to finish them.  The mixologist here, Danielle, was described to us as an architect and I think she really built an amazing drink menu. My vodka and young coconut water drink was a light, refreshing accompaniment to the meal, and I also loved the ""Our Thai"", with rum, grenadine, orgeat and pineapple. With cocktails like these on the menu, Chicagoans will forget the cold outside come wintertime. Finally, service was perfectly attentive - I tried to keep in mind that this was opening night, but had absolutely nothing of fault to note. Even the owner, Attila, came to check on us at the end of the meal and discuss Chef Dang's philosophy. Thanks for a lovely evening, Embeya. You've kicked off to a great start.",0.9965,0.737,0.253,0.01,0.7153846153846153
2012-09-11,5.0,"I was invited here for family and friends night, and it turned out to be one of the most fantastic dining experiences of my life. I sampled quite a few dishes: the pork belly spring rolls, the kona kanpachi, and green papaya...all very light and refreshing. The mussels: easily and by far the best mussels I've ever had. The thit heo kho: pork belly, and hard boiled quail egg yolks was probably my favorite dish of the evening. The stir fry noodles with shrimp were good. The bone marrow stuffed squid was amazing. The ribs were probably my second favorite dish. From the cocktail menu I had the Our Thai, absolutely delicious, a definite must try.",0.9852,0.746,0.244,0.01,0.6697058823529412
