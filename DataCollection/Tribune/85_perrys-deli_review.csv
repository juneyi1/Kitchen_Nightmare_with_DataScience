2012-12-21,1.0,"I worked downtown for over 12 years and ate here all the time. The food was always warm, fresh and the service was offbeat by a pleasureable experience. Well, I had a sandwich today for the first time in 5 years since I left, and it was horrible. I should have known something was wrong when the pictures, sign, and general ambiance of the 'original' Perry's that I remember were all gone that something was up. The Perry's Fav meat was cold although pulled from a look-alike warming tray and the day old side of cole-slaw was a true dead giveaway. I hope Perry is enjoying his scuba diving somewhere warm and that motorcyle of his because his once 'original' deli is dea and gone! Do not waste your money or your time!  My last visit, sadly",0.8134,0.736,0.173,0.091,0.5447368421052632
2009-12-04,5.0,"Huge, delicious sandwiches, good sides, friendly staff. Did I mention the huge sandwiches? I almost couldn't finish my ""Mad Moscow"" (which I highly recommend), but I conjured up all my lumberjack-pirate-manly-strengths, and pushed through. The place is immaculately clean, so huge props for that. It is a little pricey, but considering that any sandwich on the menu could easily by split by two normal, nonlumberjack people, (or three Frenchmen), I would say it is worth it. They charge a small ($0.35) service fee for using credit there, but that really shouldn't be a deal breaker. Punchline: Certainly worth a pilgrimage if you are in the mood for some awesome deli eats and have a burly appetite.",0.9872,0.708,0.292,0.0,0.6366666666666667
2009-12-02,5.0,Great sandwich.....The absolute biggest thing I have ever seen made behind a counter.....Triple decker with crisp cold lettuce and tom with warm lean meat.....nothing is better.,0.836,0.702,0.298,0.0,0.6952380952380952
2009-08-28,3.0,"Went there for lunch and wanted to compare this location to the original location on Franklin. The one in University Village is a lot smaller, the menu is the same between both sites. I had the Mad Moscow, which has pastrami and corn beef. Compared to Manny's, the size of the sandwich is close, but the price is cheaper. One of the feature's I like from the Franklin location is they have a cell-phone buzzer (basically a buzzer sounding when someone in the eating area is using a cell phone) and here there is none.",0.4215,0.925,0.053,0.023,0.59375
2009-08-11,3.0,"Someone had told me about how great this deli place (downtown location) is and that the portions are huge which was a selling point for me.  I remembered the blue Perry's Deli sign when I passed it 2 days ago walking along Maxwell St.  In fact I passed it a number of times but did not think much of it.  Now it got me interested so I went in there yesterday.     I had the Caveat Emptor and shared it with a co-worker.  It was layered with slices of corned beef, roast beef, turkey, swiss cheese, lettuce and tomatoes.  It came to about the height of the Pepsi can.  Like everyone has mentioned, it's big.  Unfortunately, It tasted like the cold cut meats you get at the grocery store.  The turkey and roast beef tasted bland, corned beef is ok.  Nothing to brag about but the size of this thing.  I think Jason's Deli is much tastier.   2 stars for taste, 5 stars for portions",0.9267,0.84,0.126,0.034,0.5530303030303031
2009-05-28,5.0,"Today I asked them to make a custom sandwich with rare roast beef, russian dressing with coleslaw on top.  Maybe it's because this is the 2nd time going here, but I am starting to crave the russian dressing and the sweet coleslaw more and more.   Can't wait to go back next time for lunch. Only wish they were open for dinner when I get back home from work.",0.8381,0.872,0.128,0.0,0.3321428571428572
2009-05-22,4.0,"Loved it!  Great sandwich.  I had the K.O. Club.  It may have been a little pricey, but it was my lunch and then dinner.  If you can't tell from the pictures, these are massive sandwiches.  They certainly don't skimp on the meat.  Pretty fast and friendly service.  I plan on making my way thru the menu in the coming months.",0.9516,0.754,0.246,0.0,0.7151785714285713
2009-03-23,4.0,"I'm typically not one to be a big fan of delis, but Perry's does not screw around and has rekindled my love of corned beef. They have a number of inventive sandwich creations, and stack 'em to the ceiling.  I got a ""Smoky Burnstein"" and it easily would feed two.  I had to take the other half home with me.  I don't see coming back all that often due to not being real close to here, but worth the stop if you are in the area around lunch time.",0.9371,0.773,0.198,0.029,0.39545454545454545
2009-02-08,4.0,"Huge! Be ready to eat, or at least have left overs.  The Russian dressing is defiantly something special.  It's only a matter of time before this place is over run with students discovering what a deal these sandwiches really are.",0.784,0.793,0.207,0.0,0.4464285714285714
2009-02-08,5.0,"They give you a lot of food, so be ready to eat.  Also have a lot of choices to eat, but it is a good idea to share. It just opened this week so the lines are not long, but give it time and it will be busy like the one downtown.",0.8954,0.792,0.208,0.0,0.45
2009-02-05,5.0,"Whoa Mama!!!   see why i'm excited on youtube:  youtube.com/watch?v=CSXy… For some reason, whenever I reminisce about my first dining experience at Perry's at their downtown location on Franklin St, Ella Fitzgerald's song ""cheek to cheek"" comes to mind, when their chorus hits, ""Heaven...I'm in Heaven..."" My head was above the clouds in heaven once again when I ate here not 5 minutes ago!!  I was pleasantly greeted by Boris and Jim, the partners to this new venue, partners in the expansion of the original Perry's on Franklin Street. The restaurant is brand spanking new with purple hues matching their business logo and floors so clean you can eat off of them.  Their coleslaw is out of this world - but if you happen to drop some on the ground - no worries, like I said, you can eat off these floors! Boris convinced me to have their famous ""Perry's Favorite"" - a giant WARM corned beef sandwich nestled in rye bread, smothered with their secret russian dressing and topped of with a scoop of coleslaw the size of your fist.  He put 1/2 of it on a styrofoam plate for my dine-in experience and wrapped up the other half and brown bagged it.  They've been in business for 27 years so they are well aware that MOST women need to wrap the rest up.  They know their business! My usual preference for deli sandwiches is pastrami, but Boris was right, their corned beef is SPOT ON - thinly sliced and WARM which are my two most important texture criterias in addition to flavor of course.  This sandwich beats the corned beef at Manny's ANY DAY! No worries, in the time being, you're allowed to use your cell phone here - in fact, I witnessed Boris using his too!  The installation of the obnoxious and notorious horn in pending at this time.  Be forewarned!",0.838,0.813,0.111,0.076,0.5765196608946609
