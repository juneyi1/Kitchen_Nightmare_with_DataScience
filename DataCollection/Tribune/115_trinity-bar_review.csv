2016-03-22,5.0,Great venue! Wonderful location and new interior. Beautiful job on the renovation. Ryan Holden is a great host! Attended a birthday celebration on Saturday evening and the entire staff were very accommodating to all of us as well as the other patrons. Made us all feel special! New exciting food items and ideas that are most welcomed in the neighborhood! Looking forward to going back again soon.,0.9811,0.673,0.327,0.0,0.583116883116883
2016-02-21,5.0,Went to Trinity bar for the first time on Friday. Staff was really nice! They have a decent beer selection. Bar was really clean. They have happy hour/free appetizer bar until 8. The owner told us that he purchased the bar last year and reopened back in October. Will definitely be back!,0.9197,0.782,0.218,0.0,0.4708333333333334
2016-02-20,5.0,"Had a great time at Trinity! Came in with a group of friends and caught the end of Friday happy hour, which is until 7:30 or 8! Super cheap drinks, friendly and fast service, free appitizer bar. Win! Great vibe and good seating for large parties. They even have a hidden speakeasy in the basement. Super cool place.",0.9917,0.507,0.493,0.0,0.6318027210884354

2016-01-02,5.0,"New ownership, new management, new menu, new vibe. No more trivia, no more beer-pong, no more college ""bro bar"" vibe. Don't be fooled parents: the place is kid friendly if need be, with plenty of seating in back away from the main bar up front. Assuming you're not a 12 year old trying to get her parents to take her here, go for a Guinness (or anything else on tap), the roast chicken (burgers and fish n' chips are winners, too), and finish off the meal with the funnel cake. You heard me, funnel cake; warm and crispy, without any of the sogginess or grease you get from whatever street fair or carnival you were at last. The place keeps a pretty mellow vibe, having removed about twelve TVs, the juke box, and aforementioned beer-pong table. Just a bunch of friendly people eating from the kitchen and drinking from the bar.",0.9027,0.826,0.13,0.044,0.46489898989898987
2015-11-25,5.0,Headed here with my fiancé and had a great time.  The burger was amazing and I was able to wash it down with Zombie Dust.  Yes they have Zombie Dust on tap here everyday!  Will definitely be back soon!,0.9311,0.704,0.296,0.0,0.5273148148148148
2015-11-25,5.0,"This fantastic hidden jewel of a restaurant is disguised as a neighborhood Irish Pub. The inside is warmed with fireplaces, candles and wood.  It's as cozy and friendly as any bar in Dublin; however, the real strength is the kitchen.  The short, reasonably pricied menu is executed with a skilled and even hand.  Its hard for me to stop ordering the roasted half chicken.  I've had it five times.  It is the juiciest, most well seasoned chicken ever.  (And its deboned it to make my life even easier.)  On Tuesdays  the bar fills up with burger lovers who are getting in on a ""$10 Beer and Burger Promotion""  As tempting as that seems, I stlll order the chicken.  My bar mates make soft groaning sounds as they devour the juicy burgers that are served with housemade pickles. When they come up for air and a pull of beer, they dunk the crispy fries/chips in house made ketchup.  Maybe next week I'll skip the chicken, or maybe not.",0.9577,0.837,0.132,0.032,0.5153508771929824
2015-11-23,5.0,"This place is good in every way. Décor, service, menu, music, and drink selection. We landed on it after leaving my work to share a little date. They were having a roasted-chicken-half-price-wine combo special. Need I say more? The cava I chose at half off was the best I've tasted yet (and now, of course, I'm on a cava ""kick,"" but as my budget won't allow a full price bottle of theirs, I'm slowly weaning myself off this kick). The roasted chicken was deliciously succulent. And our server, Devin, couldn't have been sweeter! A classy Irish bar we hope to visit often.",0.9505,0.799,0.182,0.018,0.5365079365079365
2015-10-16,5.0,The new owners and new management have done a great job. The new Trinity bar is clean and so much nicer. They have a great cocktail list that has some awesome concoctions defintly worth trying. The atmosphere helps make the experience so much better. This is a great place to relax and enjoy great food and great drinks. I can't wait to come back. Well done guys. You truly did a great job here.,0.9947,0.498,0.502,0.0,0.5539772727272727
