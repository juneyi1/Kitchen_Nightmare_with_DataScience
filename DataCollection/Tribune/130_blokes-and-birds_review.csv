2015-05-23,2.0,"Went here for dinner to try it out since we passed by it so often. First impressions were great, seemed like a cool place inside, seated right away at a cool table. Drinks were out in no time, and the old fashioned I got was really great - that's the only reason this is a 2 star instead of a 1. To be fair, we should've been warned by the kitschy cliche mustaches that adorned everything... Waitress took a long time to come and take our food orders, and mine came out wrong even though she had read it back correctly. Supposed to be a medium-cooked plain cheeseburger, came out well done and coated in some kind of gross mayo. I asked the person who brought it out for some ketchup to hide the taste since I couldn't scrape it off entirely, and he promised to get it right away - that was the last we ever saw of him. I waited for a while, as my girlfriend finished a third of her meal, and finally managed to wave down another server - for being only half full, it seemed like no one was really paying attention. The hostess was on her phone the entire time actually - how unprofessional is that! You come into the restaurant and she's leaning at the stand and visibly scrolling on Facebook or whatever, while I'm ten feet away and waving for service. Wow. I finally flagged someone down and demanded just one little bowl of ketchup already so I could eat, and our waitress brought it back, noticed the plate where I had scraped everything off because she got my order wrong, didn't seem to care, and walked away immediately. Ok... After all that, biting into it and finding out it was thoroughly well done wasn't so bad because I was pretty resigned to having a bad experience here anyway. The waitress never even seemed to care. Didn't even apologize or offer to correct it. Wouldn't have been a big deal if it was just, like, a tomato that I could pick off, but this gross mayo sauce was so soaked into the whole burger and bun that I couldn't even finish it. I left with a disgusting taste in my mouth and I'm never coming back. There are plenty of other options just steps away - don't waste your time with this lackluster place.",0.2904,0.835,0.088,0.077,0.47568150448585234

The food was reasonably priced and delicious.

I was excited to have a fun night of goofy singing and drinks. There were many people who were lined up to sing so it seemed that it would be a fun night... then things went downhill from there. Very quickly, it became apparent that the DJ had his favorites or ""regulars"" many of the same people sang over and over and many people who signed up did not get put on the song list. When the DJ was addressed and asked why some people did not get their turns, he just said they were on the list but had to wait.  You could tell that there were many professional singers there, which could be fun but some of them actually got on stage and took the microphone from people who did not sing as well as they did. Overall, I would recommend this place for food and drinks but not for Karaoke.

The food was fine - a little greasy, burgers were a little overcooked, a friend who ordered gnocchi hardly even touched it. It was the service that really ruined the entire experience - and from the moment I walked in, no less. I walked in and the hostess had her back to me and was chatting up another patron. I stood and waited patiently until the gentleman she was talking to motioned to her that I was there. She turned around, glared at me, asked my name, and then huffed because ""how could I not see that my friends were sitting in the back corner?!"" Our waitress came by and asked us for our drink orders which we got promptly. Then she didn't come back for our food orders. And once we did finally place our food orders, it took an hour (A FULL HOUR), to get our food. Now, we had show tickets at 9pm just around the corner. One would think that you needn't a full 2 hours to eat a burger, but apparently you do. It took multiple attempts (asking the busboy and other waiters) to get our check. When she finally brought it, she essentially threw it at us and ran away (we were all sitting there, credit cards in hand at the ready). So my friend took the bill up to the bar to get it paid. When she noticed, she got upset asking us why we didn't mention we had a time limit. I suppose we didn't realize that it needed to be stated that dinner should be complete in less than 2 hours. The ambiance is great - it's a near replica of Hutch down the block. Too bad the service and food quality isn't on par. Seems like a no-brainer that Hutch had no reservations available and this place was wide open. I won't be going back.

It pains me to rate the restaurant with one star, but our server was so non-chalent and slow, that it ruined my whole experience at this place. I will not be going back. It actually ruined my day as well. We came in with a large group of ten, and while every place in Wrigleyville/Boy's Town was too busy on Saturday morning to take an impromptu big party, Blokes & Birds was empty. I had a fonder memory of eating here before, and decided to pay no attention to the tumble weeds blowing through the place. We decided to start the meal with a shot. We ordered 10 shots of Jameson, and our server invited himself to have one as well. I take that as a positive start to the experience. He's fun, this is going to be a fun time. After that he was nowhere to be found. Well, he was, he was busy socializing with the bartenders, and cooks, and not worrying about actually getting any of our orders. We sat waiting for him to take our drink orders. Once he got those from us, my friends who took part in the bottomless mimosas deal, received maybe two more refills and really just found themselves sitting in front of empty glasses. So the deal wasn't a good one when you're only getting like, two drinks out of it. We wanted water, we wanted to order our food, we wanted refills. This guy was just terrible. And again, the restaurant was empty on this particular Saturday morning. I eventually couldn't take it anymore, and I had to get up and say something to him. I wasn't nice about it. But he was so goddamn casual, he made it easy to take a stern tone with him. He had forgotten to put our food orders in, and then when he did, he failed to actually order some, so the meals were staggered. It was crap. It was such a crap experience, he lost his playful attitude, and instead apologized to the table for the poor service we experienced from him. My boyfriend, and I, and the whole table are in the food service industry. And after we closed out the bill, I snuck a look at the tip my overly giving boyfriend left, and it was like 25%. There's nothing I can do about that, but let me just say, if I had been the one closing out the bill, it would have been less than 15%. There was no excuse for his bad performance. None. I ended up mentioning to my boyfriend that he over-tipped, which lead to an argument, which messed with our day. This incompetent server had an effect on the rest of my Saturday. I won't ever go back again, for fear of having him again, or seeing him, and feeling the urge to tell him how I felt about this past experience.",-0.9683,0.761,0.101,0.138,0.40969903112760264

Some items on the menu were not available. My fish and chips were delivered without peas. They came with an odd assortment of sauces, but not malt vinegar.

It was a Friday night and to be safe, I made reservations, but apparently.. none were needed.. this place was not even close to packed. That should have been a giveaway. BUT, we were like... must just be too early. Here's the run down: Food - okay. I've experienced better with better service. The Scotch Egg was good, but they could have given you what kind of sausage it was. One of my friends couldn't even try it because we weren't sure if it was beef or pork. The Chicken Tikka was BLAND. DO NOT GET THIS. When I order indian food... I expect a nice blend of spices and flavor. This did not suffice. The Chelsea Fish and Chips was not really an entree. They gave such a tiny portion (one piece of fish) it should have been considered an appetizer. The best thing was the Pork-Rib Sandwich, but meat covered in bbq sauce? How can you go wrong? Also, the menu said that the Pork-Rib came with an ""asian"" bbq sauce.. it didn't taste like asian.. it tasted like your normal run of the mill bbq sauce.  Drinks - I liked the British Cup... that was it. Oh, they also give you zucchini water.. it's a hit or miss with some people.  Service - AWFUL. I know our waiter tried to be super nice but he came off really weird. I felt like he was sneaking up on me and I never saw him coming. The guy who served our food was TERRIBLE. So here's the thing... when you serve someone their food.. you try NOT to let it slide off the plate into their lap and have them catch the food as it's falling. If that happens.. you also try to APOLOGIZE. Nope.. No apologies.. just a look like, ""yea you're SUPPOSE to catch your food"". Ridiculous. I never wanted to leave more in my life.

We went with a group of 12 to Blokes & Birds before the Billy Joel concert at Wrigley.  We had a reservation.  When we showed up, there were just two menus on the table. After sharing menus, we ordered our drinks and appetizers.  Some people had to reiterate their drink orders, since our server seemed to have forgotten them. When the apps showed up, they didn't bring silverware or plates, so we initially made due with the few place-settings that were on the table to begin with. Our entrees took nearly an hour to arrive.  And when they did, we still had a severe shortage of napkins and silverware.  I had to walk over to the place where all that was stacked and ask an employee to hook us up. Many entrees came out prepared incorrectly.  My fries were overcooked and flavorless. I've been to Blokes & Birds several times and I generally enjoy it.  But on a night when you know you're going to get slammed and when a 12-top submits a credit card number to hold a reservation, maybe consider things like having enough silverware, plates and menus for each customer to have one.  That seems like what they teach you on day one of Restaurant School.

You're off to a real good start, Blokes and Birds. On Sunday they serve brunch until 3, which is when most people decide is the most sensible time of day to actually roll out of bed for their weekly supply of biscuits and gravy. Luckily, I was on a little vaca in Chicago, so my better half made sure we got there by 2 :) The open-air style of seating is something that the Twin Cities could definitely take a few tips on from Chicago. The restaurant itself is all dark wood and the lighting is sparse, but with all the doors all open, the darkness felt cool, and more like a refuge from the scorching sun outside. I also enjoyed the fresh cucumber water they served in place of regular tap water, and the table settings were simple, and not fussy. Pair that with the soft reggae music from above, and the breezes from outside, I really felt relaxed and at ease inside the space. Errywhere I go for brunch, I look for eggs benny or biscuits and gravy. Meet their first cousin: spicy sausage gravy on top of thick biscuits, with a fried egg and dill sprigs, topped with 2 more large sausage links. My oh my, what a heavenly, meaty sensation. This was a brunch special, so I am not sure if you would find it on the regular menu. The only thing I didn't get, was that it was advertised as reflecting English-pub culture.

I have had their brunch more recently and loved their awesome biscuits and gravy (with a fried egg on top and homemade sausage and gravy) and eggs benedict (my iteration was crabcake with a delicious hollandaise sauce that would taste amazing on anything).

Anyways, Jade came and hung with our table for a good portion of the night and even had us try a few desserts for free. Wow!

The decor is sleek and masculine, and there was a guitar player who serenaded us throughout the meal, which was really nice. The bad: Our server was new (she told us it was her first day), so things definitely took longer than they should've. She was very sweet and gave us a few drinks for free to make up for it, but food definitely took awhile to come out (30+ minutes). The grits were pretty bland on their own. Also, splitting the check took forever (it was split evenly, not person-by-person), even after our server got a manager involved. She forgot things like coffee and refills, but, to be expected with a new server I guess. The good: I ordered the duck confit hash and it was fabulous. There was plenty of duck (though the duck was sliiiiightly dry), the truffled hollandaise was phenomenally tasty, and the sunny-side up eggs were perfectly runny. Everyone else at the table gave rave reviews for the french toast and the prosciutto benedict (though I do think the truffle hollandaise overwhelmed the benedict a bit). Our waitress recommended the St. Germain cocktail and it was perfectly refreshing with a fun presentation to boot.

What I mean by left is left to sit for 15 minutes before our server even came over to take our drink order.  And then left to sit for another 15 minutes before he came to finally take our food order.  He was very attentive with the other tables around us, but he kind of seemed to be ignoring our table.  I got tired of waiting, and my boyfriend had to do an airport pickup after dinner, so I finally just told him we were ready to take our order as he hurried past our table.  We wanted to order everything together, but he just took our appetizer order and then told us he'd be back.  His rationale was that we ordered a baked cheese that would take a long time.  I wish we had ordered it within ten minutes of sitting down, but it was too late for that.  We braced ourselves to see if he actually would return, but he did within a few minutes to take our food order. We started off with the baked brie, which actually comes baked in an apple.  It wasn't anything substantial or flavorful, and I would probably skip it.  When our appetizer was brought, I asked about the Yelp offer, which was for a nip of the house infusion.  The house infusion is an infused bourbon which they change monthly.  The one had an almost minty flavor.  And he brought a nap, small taste, over for everyone at our table.  At that point, our service had improved greatly, but I was still a little annoyed about having to sit for so long without ordering.   I had the fish and chips as my entree.  It came with four sauces for dipping which was nice.  One of them was the pea puree and another a malt vinegar aioli that was really tasty.  The fish was very flavorful and the chips tasted really fresh and delicious.  Everyone else said their food was really good, which redeemed the experience.",0.9677,0.898,0.074,0.029,0.43516519010705057

The layout was a little strange, it appeared a slight waste of usable floor space for a Sunday visit, however I have not seen the Friday or Saturday night crowds so maybe they are sacraficing table space for standing floor space.  Either way there is not a lot of sitting room for what is quite a roomy space for a City Pub.

We were seated for about a minute when the waiter came by our table, never really stopping, and asked for our drink orders. He was literally mid stride and didn't actually stop to address our table. I asked for iced tea, they didn't have it...whatever not his fault, I stuck with water. Again he walked away and a few minutes later when we were ready to put in our appetizer order, he still didn't stop. Every time he took our order it was as though it were an after thought. As if he was too busy to stop and really address us. When we put in the order for our entree it was the same drill, he was mid stride and basically walking away before I could complete my order. I literally had to stop him before he left so I could order a side of Brussels sprouts. My fiance wanted a side of the bacon aioli because he was curious as to what that tasted like, but again, the waiter was long gone before he had the chance. Aside from the terrible service, the food was so so. I had the Amish chicken with a side of Brussels sprouts. The chicken was moist, and the sauce was good.

Then, we waited for a menu. We waited for water. We ordered the first round of mimosas that were part of the groupon. They took nearly 25 minutes to bring out. They were like a garden threw up in our glass. I had to use my teeth to strain leaves out of the mimosa I was drinking. Really? The subsequent rounds took forever to bring out. They were 95% juice. No champagne sign whatsoever. Our friend ordered a beer flight that took nearly 40 minutes to come out. Groupon doesn't mean ""screw frequent brunch goers."" Finally we were able to order our food. I had picked out a salad. You'd think they'd have salad available at lunch, right? Wrong. Dinner only. Not stated anywhere on the menu. Nothing irritates me like being forced into 1/3 of the menu. Literally they were out of large categories of things. I finally decided to have a salmon hash. The eggs were stiff, the dish had about 500% of my daily salt in it. Not good AT ALL. The salmon quality was good. That was the only redeeming value to the dish.  If you want awful service and slow service go hear. We won't be back.  What the others said about the space was true.

2013-06-02,3.0,"I went to Blokes & Birds for brunch with a Groupon. I was relatively impressed with the very masculine environment without being overwhelmingly macho. There is wood EVERYWHERE and the poles are wrapped in a snakeskin plether. We were seated close enough to our reservation without a problem. I HIGHLY recommend making a reservation if you plan to head here before 1:30pm.  Our food was quite good. My wife has the Smoked Salmon Hash and I had the Blokes Breakfast. The black pudding was amazing, and the truffled hollandaise they stick over their perfectly poached eggs was well balanced. While both were good, they were not overwhelmingly large - just the right amount of food. We had Mimosas which were heavily watered down, but still pleasing. Our waiter was AMAZING and if I were working at another restaurant, I would try every trick to lure him away.  The cocktail menu is quite well stocked with favorites and originals. They have a wide selection of wine and beer and can make almost anything you request. That said, prices were a little bit high considering other brunch places, but keeping in par with Wrigleyville gouging. My dislikes are entirely limited to the noise. This place is LOUD. Very loud. There's a drop ceiling to hides the industrial ceiling, but they did not install any kind of noise reduction. I guess this place is also a music lounge at night, so I get why, but you lose all elements of intimacy and have to speak quite loudly to talk over everyone else. Overall I don't think I would go out of my way to head down to this place. I would have liked to see much more food on my plate for the prices considering the high priced food items on each plate were not in abundance. In my opinion, the food is really no better than any other brunch place and far inferior to some of the better local gems I've eaten at around Chicago.

2013-05-13,4.0,"After reading the mixed reviews for Blokes & Birds I was a wee bit skeptical when we decided to finally stop in for dinner and some drinks. I made a reservation on Open Table for 7pm on a Saturday, and I was surprised to see how busy it was upon arrival. A live musician was setting up when we were seated, and the hostess placed us right next to him. I was hoping that he would be 1) decent to listen to and 2) not insanely loud as to intrude on the conversation of dinner once he started playing. All that aside, once we were seated and given menus we had to wait about 10 minutes or so for our waitress to greet us, which was a bit long. We quickly put in our first order of drinks, trying some of their signature cocktails. I tried the UK Sazerac which was an interesting combination of Aberlour Scotch, Pimm's, rosemary, and clove reduction. It was a tad bit sweet for my liking, but it was still a delicious and refreshing drink to start off the evening with. My fiance went with the Colonial which was a nice mixture Bourbon, Cynet, Noilly Pratt, sweet vermouth, and orange bitters. This drink was perfectly mixed and had a slight bitter taste at the end which I liked better than the syrupy sweetness of my drink. As we were finishing up our cocktails, our waitress came back so we put in an order for two beers from their nice selection as well as two appetizers. The appetizers we chose were delicious, my favorite being the Posh on Becks which was their take on bacon wrapped dates. We only received three dates for this appetizer, but that's not terrible considering the price tag of $6. We also ordered the Cheesy Peavey which was an apple that was baked and stuffed with cheese and served with puff pastry-esque crackers. I feel that the idea of this dish was better than it tasted, as it was a little flavorless for my liking. For our main entrees, we both chose the fish and chips. Being fiercely loyal to Owen & Engine's fish and chips, I was skeptical again about ordering this dish. Although, when they arrived, I was more than happy with my choice. The fish was lightly battered and served with a side of pea puree and tartar sauce, both of which were delicious with the fish. The fish was quite flavorful on its own, and didn't have the ""fishy"" flavor that many cheap fish and chip entrees serve up. As for the chips, they were perfectly seasoned with herbs and sea salt, and were a great accompaniment to the fish. As for the service, it was a bit slow, but it was a busy Saturday night. The hostess and the bus boys were friendly and attentive, so no complaints there. As for the live music, it was loud, but not obnoxiously so.  Blokes & Birds is a nice refreshment for the Wrigleyville area, the crowd was decent and it made me feel like I wasn't in the midst of Lakeview on a weekend night.

We didn't order any food, but just had a couple of drinks and found the bartender to be very pleasant. He gave us nice, attentive service without being pushy. I was surprised that he didn't know how to make a Gordon's Cup, but he did offer to try making one if I'd tell him what was in it. I decided to stick with beer. He offered to give me tasters of some drafts (which wouldn't have been as necessary if the menu had some descriptions, just sayin') and I had a couple of nice brown ales. I especially appreciated that he accommodated my request to let me smell the bitters without looking at me like I was a nut.

It took awhile for someone to come to our table of 2 after we were seated. Once the server showed up he brought us drinks. I had a gin/tonic and my friend had a beer from the tap. Her beer was room temperature (basically not drinkable) and once we told the server he decided to tell us that some of the taps have been acting up throughout the day. I felt he should have informed us of this when he heard her order a beer from the tap.  We wanted to order and there were about 4 items on the menu that they did not have anymore for the night. Once we started ordering and he saw the first thing was gone, he should have been proactive with letting us know what they were all sold out of. In short it took us awhile to order due to us rambling through the menu hoping they had something that looked interesting. I tried the brussel sprouts and they were pretty good. He made up for his non diligence by referring her to a decent canned craft beer. He was a nice guy and all, but he needs some tips on being in the service industry.

But if you want to enjoy that food in a less hectic environment and you have your heart set on going on a Saturday night- go around 7.   . . . for by the time 9pm rolls around, this place is hopping, the noise level is way up and it moves from restaurant to bar. Knowing this- we made reservations for 7 on a recent Saturday and got a table right up front for our group.  Our server, Natalia, was terrific- her knowledge of the menu was second to none and there was nothing that we asked her that she didn't have the answer for.   The name of this place alone will tell you that this is ""English food"" with a bit of a twist.   And know that the portion sizes are quite large so order accordingly. Up first- we tried the foie gras, the cheesy peavy, and the green chili along with a couple of salads.  For this cheese lovin' girl the Cheesy peavy was a winner (think brie cheese and toast) I thought the place was a bar- but the entrees said restaurant.  My pork tenderloin rivaled some of the best I have had, and the whitefish special of the day was also a clear winner.  And the two at our table that got one of their burgers were also pleased. And for dessert?  Try the sticky pudding.  Made me think I was over the pond in the UK! There are really two bars in this place.  The main floor bar has live music (usually a guitar playing soloist) but downstairs there is a karaoke bar that really gets going as the night goes on.

We were just minding our own business! I stood up to protest, ""we cannot leave yet, we haven't paid our bill!"" The bouncer replied, ""shut the **** up, you *****!""

I've always liked their food and drinks.  I've never had issues with either.  I will say that their menu in the beginning was bigger and had some great things to try.  When I went there last, it was smaller, but I still enjoyed the food very much.  Service has gone from excellent to ok.  Although I've noticed that when they're busy, it's tough to get a drink.  On the otherhand, their cocktails have always been excellent. What I am disappointed in is that I went to brunch there a few weeks ago and saw some things that leads me to believe this place may be slowly losing it's edge.  I guess this review is sort of a plea for B&B to get their act together and get back to the beginning when they had amazing service and a bit of a better menu.

My sister didn't like her drink which was one of their specialties, she asked to have it tweeked but it didn't help. During our meal the waiter asked if we wanted another drink, so I said yes. Again another 20 minutes and no drink, so we finally just asked for the check. I know he had a lot of tables and I'm not sure if that's a norm or because they were short staffed but we overall felt neglected.  However, I did really enjoy my meal. I got the chicken Tikka Masala and so did my friend because it looked really appealing. Definitely was a good choice by us both. I really enjoyed having the live music, the musician was very talented and played good songs.

Seasonal cocktails that are not chocolate, apple and pure sugar are even better. I've said it before, I'll say it again. Sugar is for children and dessert, not alcohol.  B&B provides a warm, intimate watering hole for small, coquettish groups of smarties with supple seating and flickering candlelight. After dinner cocktails, perfect. Dinner with the family, not so much. Like a Lion's fan, I can't stop going, and hoping for something better in the way of food.

Feels like a rant worthy morning, so lets do that.  I feel like the creator of this place was once told about GB, a few words and phrases, and maybe a brief overview of the food, then 10 years later he recounted what he could and tried to base a restaurant upon it.   Words and phrases are strewn about the menu with no regard for meaning or context, and it ends up making the customer feel like a jackass when ordering.   Cocktails: Seriously, why do restaurants feel the need to name their cocktails this way?  You know what I wanted? Something with bourbon.  You know what I had to order of their cocktail menu? ""Mind the Bollocks"".  Now, I realize that this is probably in reference to the Sex Pistols (edgy...), although when it comes to it, drinks are like, one word phrases. So I have to order a ""bollocks.""  Barkeep, please give me a ""testicles"" on the rock.  That being said, it wasn't very good.  Too sweet. Their entire cocktail menu appeared uninspired, and named like something from a themed restaurant like a Hard Rock Cafe. Food:  The menu was nice and short, although I might argue TOO short. The curry, albeit tasty (and also stupidly named,) would be unrecognizable as a curry to any Brit.  It felt that they had filled out the menu with standard bar food but put ""English"" or ""the Queen's"" or something in front of it.  Buckingham Baked Mac N' Cheese? Marleybone Mozz & Toms? Posh on Beck? Come off it. Atmosphere:  It was relatively quiet and empty at a good dining hour on a Thursday evening.  TV's were everywhere, bathing the otherwise darkness in flicking, closed-captioned Sportscenter (take that as you will).  It was decorated in a modern fashion,  and was clean.  A nice place to have a conversation UNTIL they bring in the guy with the acoustic guitar.  I saw him setting up and thought 'that may be nicer in the evening,' until he started playing.  Apparently he'd taken his cue from Spinal Tap, as the volume was cranked up to 11.  This drove us out of there as fast as the slow waiter could bring us our check.  With three tables active in the place, you'd think it would come quicker. Negative.

My husband got the shepherd's pie, and ordered a side of chips with curry sauce. The vegetarian curry was really more like a soup with a faint curry flavor, and the basmati rice that came with it was almost non-existent. Sadly, there wasn't much flavor to the curry, which is kind of the only thing you can count on in a curry. The same can be said for the shepherd's pie: there wasn't much going on - lamb, some mashed potatoes, some cheese sprinkled on top, but no sauce/gravy involved, nor any veggies to be found.

The food, while not bad, did not meet its lofty goals. We started off with a Scotch egg--a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage and deep-fried--but the yolk was a tad overcooked and the sausage slightly lacking in flavor. For the main dish, I had the sausage platter, house-made sausages (very ambitious!) with ginger apple chutney, caramelized onion, and super spicy mustard accompaniments. The English banger was mild, and I think a little bland, but the blood sausage was quite tasty once I got over the softer bite that blood sausage typically has. This dish also comes with mashed potatoes topped with a fried egg, tasty but not particularly adventurous. Aaron had the burger and reached a similar verdict: not bad but not great. The ambiance is nice--dimly lit, dark wood panelling and upscale furnishings, quiet enough to have a good conversation. I would certainly go back for drinks--the atmosphere is nice, and the creative execution on drinks fun.

Granted, when home alone, I make things like mac & cheese and popcorn for dinner, so maybe that's not saying a lot. However, the chicken was super juicy, potatoes were killer, and as a girl that strongly dislikes capers, I even liked the caper aioli that came with it.

I got the braised short rib sandwich, and it was awesome.  I was told it didn't come with a side, so I got the brussel sprouts, too.  They were good but too big for a side, and I felt like most of the sides were too expensive.  Also the sandwich did come with somewhat of a ""side."" In a tiny ramekin was 1 cauliflower floret, a slice of carrot, and a slice of celery.  What? Random, but they were actually kind of good.

It seems like this was an attempt to add a touch of sophistication to a strip that is not normally associated with sophistication.  Let's start with the good: The drink menu has an extensive selection of beer and cocktails. We settled on a few beers and were quite satisfied. As for the food, when it came out, we were not so satisfied. Among the dishes ordered were shepherd's pie, the sausage platter, and the pork tenderloin. I could see the look of disappointment in my friend's face as she bit into the tenderloin. She went ""Is this supposed to be lukewarm? I mean it tastes good, but it seems like it was just microwaved."" The sausage platter on the other hand was very good. You could tell that the sausages were home made (or if they weren't, at least a premium brand). The accompanying sauces and mash potatoes rounded out the dish and one in particular had a nice kick to it that went well with the meats. As for the shepherd's pie, one came out steaming hot, and one came out lukewarm. Not just on the outside, but the inside. Even when everyone at the table sampled the two pies, we all agreed that there was something lacking in the lukewarm one, and not just temperature. But the other one was just fine, albeit steaming hot. Overall the service was good, but the ambiance is overdone for an area that typically has much lower standards. There was a crowd, but plenty of open tables for people that came in. For awhile, the bar had more people than the tables, and plenty of floor space for the presumed weekend crowd. In the end, we left miffed, neither satisfied or dissatisfied. Part of that was the beer. And if this is all that is required to be satisfied, you can do so elsewhere for less cost. Pros: The drink menu, especially the beer list. Attentive service. Darkened ambiance, and for those of you who just need to know what the score of the game is, a few strategically placed TVs. Cons: Food was inconsistent, prices seemed high. To Sum It Up: Try it once and decide if it's worth it to come back.",0.9913,0.856,0.122,0.022,0.5134401709401709

The bartender was attentive, friendly, suggestive, and just a great guy to have  behind the bar. We came in quiet and reserved but left jolly and looking for trouble. Jk, we're not trouble-makers.  An extensive and elaborate liquor menu listing everything they have, mainly focusing on whiskey. Impressive selection on draft beer as well. I forgot my phone in the back restroom, never to be seen again but a wonderful soul turned it to the Host and I was able to retrieve it.  oh.my .gosh. AMAZING for him to return it and AMAZING for the Host to not keep it himself. This made me believe in Human-Kind just a bit more.",0.9928,0.74,0.217,0.042,0.6368589743589743

Any other bar in Logan Square, Andersonville, Wicker Park, even Lincoln Park proper would serve these beers at normal price. And when I asked for a shot of Jameson, and all I got was an 1/8th of a shot glass full, the bartender measured it with a mixed drinks shot glass. In no bar is that proper pouring.

I love this place because it is a nice break from the Wrigleyville scene.  Great ambiance, great beer list.  A small group of us went for dinner on a Saturday night, and unfortunately, it seems that this kitchen is biting off more than it can chew.  We had some great food, but the ""bad"" dishes were monumentally bad.   We ordered a round of apps - the dates, the deviled beef, the mac and cheese, and the mussels.  3 out of 4 were great, the mac and cheese was nothing special.   We ordered our entrees to share - pork tenderloin,  salmon, fish and chips, and chicken tikka masala. We were in no rush, just enjoying drinks and conversation - the waitress came by after a bit to say that the kitchen was ""dotting the i's and crossing the t's"" on our entrees.  Great.  10 minutes later she came by to say that she had made a mistake, and that our order was not yet ready.  Fine, no problem.  It seemed that the kichen was having an issue, but that happens.   Then the food came - the pork tenderloin dish was completely cold, and the root vegetables with the salmon had not been cooked through.  The tikka masala was lukewarm.  I've never been anywhere (pub or not) where food this bad left the kitchen.  The fish and chips were great (and hot) so it's obvious that the kitchen didn't time their orders correctly.  We sent the salmon and pork back, and they sent them back out to us after apologies from the waitress. We ate everything and it was fine, but nothing to write home about - they took the salmon off of the bill after we gave feedback that the root vegetables still weren't cooked.  The kitchen had the waitress come to the table and tell us that since they were turnips and parsnips we should expect a different texture, as if we couldn't tell what we were eating and whether it was appropriately cooked. An unnecessary insult on top of an already bad experience. Moral of the story - stick to burgers and fish and chips, and you'll have a great evening out.",0.9596,0.738,0.144,0.118,0.5956241956241957

2011-10-25,4.0,"Blokes & Birds is often lumped in with the Wrigleyville bars.  I'm not sure why.  Geographically, it's on the far fringe of that scene; operationally, they aim for something else entirely. I've been here for a range of occasions: From casual date night to ""let's avoid the amateurs on New Year's Eve"" to ""let's camp out at the bar and get proper shit-faced.""  It works for all three. The beer menu is expansive and well-selected.  It leans most heavily on US microbrews and Belgian and UK (surprise!) offerings, and there's nothing too novel in that, but they typically have a number of labels that you only see rarely.  On my last visit, I stuck to their whiskey-based cocktails (Tempest, Colonial and Old Chum); all were well-conceived and well-mixed. The food is traditional pub fare with some flourishes.  I seek Scotch eggs like Jay Cutler seeks mediocrity, and B&B makes a fine one.  I can also vouch for the BLT (With deviled ham and a fried egg?  Well played, sir.) and the curry sandwich, and my better half swears by the house burger.  I've had the rumbledthumps just once and found them too heavy on the kale for my liking. It's a welcoming, open environment, with plenty of windows and wood.  However, this preponderance of wood also means it can get loud at times. I'm of the opinion that the music makes or breaks a pub.  While B&B generally sticks to the English standbys, the sequencing could use some work.  On my last visit, they got me from Coldplay to Pink Floyd to the Clash to Cyndi Lauper (???) in under six moves.  Depending on your attitude toward such things, you will find this either charming or maddening as hell.  The staff has repeatedly proven themselves knowledgeable and, as importantly, adept and engaging conversationalists.  One server regaled us with a story of attempting to caulk her bathtub while drunk; on another visit, a bartender & I discussed the merits of Tricky's first album and agreed that it is unassailable.

Our waiter was nice, but the service overall was lacking.  I asked what the risotto special was and he said that it didn't exist and that they just never printed new menus.  Weird. It wasn't that busy and there weren't that many people ordering food at that point in the night-- and the food took forever to arrive.  It took close to 45 minutes and when it finally did, the mac and cheese that we were planning to share amongst the group was nowhere to be found.  The waiter didn't acknowledge that when the food was served and then he didn't again when he came to check in on us, which is when we reminded him about it.  He came by three more times to say it would ""be right out,"" but the rest of our meals were long gone before it finally showed up.  I'm not sure if he forgot to put the order in or if the kitchen screwed things up or what, but there seemed to be an error in communication somewhere.  The beer and wine selections are great and the food was very good though. I will give the waiter props as we had purchased a YouSwoop certificate to use at B&B and then forgot to bring it along.  He did allow me to show it to him on my phone and then write down the certificate number instead of presenting it.   After the wait and weird service experience, we sort of knew we wouldn't be rushing back again to use it so that was at least a silver lining.",0.8199,0.908,0.056,0.036,0.6013013067179734

2011-09-07,4.0,"Wot's all that, then? Sorry. Had to say it. I also need to say that I'm a fan. A big one. The only reason this place doesn't get 5 big ones from me is because I don't know for sure that it's as good as it gets. But, I'm interested in seeing if it does. First off, a grown-up, has-nothing-to-do-with-the-Cubs establishment on Clark (in Wrigleyville) that isn't packed to the gills with a crowd that juuust might make me the teensiest bit stabby. Unbelievable! But just because it's not packed with Bud Light's finest doesn't mean that it's not packed. The word's out and has been out for a while. Arrive with a game plan and/or at grandma time or prepare to wait and stalk some tables. It'll all be worth it if you follow my rules to eating and drinking. Or, drinking and eating. Drinking: Liquor before beer, you're in the clear. Start with some craft cocktails. Since even the butchest Brit can make one's 'dar go off (the accent + the non-ironic use of the word 'darling' is very confusing), go for a 'girlie' drink and do it with gusto. I suggest a B-Cup (*rimshot* and, yes). Pimms, blueberry, acai, vodka, St. Germain, etc. it has all the elements of that fruit-filled cocktail you've always wanted to drink in public but never had the nerve to do. Here, you can do it and say you're just tapping into your inner Brit (how dapper, polished and refined). See? See?? I was also a fan of the Breakfast at Tiffanys but I think it's off the menu. What? If you're going to do it, go.all.out. With the craft cocktail out of your system, head over to beer-land and stay there. The servers are pretty well suited to advise you on what pairs with your food, so trust their opinion. I tend to go with Belgians and English beers. I have yet to have a bad one. Eating: now that you're getting sauced (you randy scouse git), get some food in your belly (said with a Scottish accent). Eat these things. I repeat: eat these things and you're guaranteed to have a positive experience: 1.) Green Chile & Pork Chili. It may not be on the regular menu but it's been there each time I've been. It's phenomenal. It's also very spicy. Use the bread on the table as a sopping agent and eat it as a wet plate dish. This way, you won't have a belly full of hot, spicy broth... which can not and will not lead to good things after.; 2.) Scotch Egg. It all comes down to the sweet mustard, as the thought of egg-encrusted pork is still a little baffling. Tastes good, though; 3.) Kedgeree. It's a Scottish dish but get it any way. Smoked salmon, curry, rice = incredible. Thinking about it, the mix of smoked fish and curry makes sense within the context of Scotland but, admittedly, the idea through me for a loop.; 4.) Bubble & Squeak. Fight the temptation to believe that the names are all made up and just go with it. Browned potatoes with cabbage and other crunchy bits inside. You're not done. It's time for dessert. What? Eat. It's cold in England. People eat, wear sweaters and deal with pleasant plumpness. Except for Kate Moss. The selections vary but if either of these goodies are up for grabs, grab 'em both: trifle with berries, custard, sponge cake, cream, and (I think) some sort of booze sauce. Yes. Oh, yes. Aaaand, the Earl Grey Creme Brulee. If I need to say any more about this, we can't be friends. Can' t.be .friends. So there you have it. A sure-fire way to enjoy yourself at Blokes and Birds. Granted, you'll have a food baby to resemble the Octo-Mom but what do you care? Summer's over. It's time to enjoy yourself and eat rich food.

Food: Great food, very unique. Everything I've had has always been great. Love the Tikka masala. It's a twist of the traditional Indian version, theirs is a more dry version with the basmati rice already mixed in. This is not like an Indian rest. that is more buttery. There is not an orange sauce, but it's very moist, flavorful, and has a slight kick. I must say, one of the best I've had. All the food is freshly made and very good.  Dessert: If they have it in season, best blueberry pie I've ever fantastic. Should be on the menu all the time, but to our chagrin, it wasn't on the last time we were there.  Atmosphere: more sophisticated. large open space. enough tables for those that want to sit. Large bar area.

We immediately were impressed with the decor of this place, they did an awesome job renovating. Very tasteful and welcoming decor with an understated elegance.  The menu is a nice change from the typical Wrigleyville bar scene with traditional English fare. One recommendation is that they put explanations on some of the menu items that are not common American foods. Great beer list to boot. I tried a tangerine wheat beer I had never had before that was outstanding. Another plus is they keep the music down, so you can actually easily engage in conversation unlike so many of the other nearby bars.  Food wise the prices are reasonable and above average quality for pub food. My wife and I split several dishes: The mac & cheese, a burger, chips, and a cheese plate. The mac & cheese was some of the best we have had. The fries were above average as was the burger (nice presentation on the burger too). The only disappointment was the cheese plate; it was priced higher than an entree but came with four very small cubes of super market quality cheese. This item needs a big overhaul, but two thumbs up for the rest of the food and for the beers we consumed.

I was excited to book a surprise party for my boyfriend when I first visited Blokes and Birds because of its laid-back atmosphere and variety of beers. I was given the card of a manager named Daily Webb to contact to set up a event. It was late May so I figured that booking an event for late September shouldn't be a problem. I called Daily in June and described to him what I wanted, an estimate of how many people were coming and my information. He said he would write it down and get back to me as soon as possible. I called him a week later after waiting urgently for a call and he said that he was about to ""step into a meeting"" but insured me that my date for September was in his calendar. He also urged me that he would call me as soon as he was out of the meeting- and to his credit, he actually did- I was at work and he left a message saying that if I had any questions for me to call him anytime ""at my convenience."" So I did. Quite a few times with no response. When he decided to pick up, he said that the phone I was calling was his personal phone and that he was at home and I should call him at 1 the next day. I called him again and left a message and again, no response. Finally, in late July I left a final message just explaining to him my two simple yes or no questions about wristbands and a down payment and pleaded him to leave me a message with the answers. That was almost three weeks ago. Frustrated, I called him one final time this afternoon and he remarkably had the time to leave his busy schedule for a paying customer! I told him that I needed to cancel my event because I had been trying to get a couple questions answered in the time span of two months and I was disappointed I hadn't heard from him. He immediately blamed me for not leaving my phone number on one of my FIVE messages I left him (which he had because he took all my information when I booked the date) and then began to tell me that he has been out of town for the last couple weeks-- I don't know who takes a two month long vacation, but I sure want in on that!!  I told him that I would prefer to look elsewhere and before I could say anything else he hung up!

No, It's not a genre. It's what the music will make you do after about twenty minutes. Just a horrendous music selection.  Their food is decent but not solid. I will say I sampled a few dishes and they ranged from amazing (wedge salad, chili) to downright terrible (the burger, vegetable curry). Our waitress raved about the burger only to bring out a very gray, very overcooked, very salty blop of beef on a bun that tasted like it was a bit stale.  The chicken tikka masala I had was good and I would probably order it again. Although made with curry, it was really well balanced with other flavors. This is what I meant by ""not solid"". The chef can blow your mind with some very interesting flavors then blow your colon with a passable but not edible burger.  The good news: Great drink specials. On Wednesday nights the House offers a wee nip and a pint for $5. They feature a well crafted whiskey nip and a pint of local beer. Really quite tasty! The service we had was also very good. Our waitress might have overstated the quality of some of the food, but she does get paid by these people, it's her job. She was always on top of everything.  The bar also features cucumber water. Some people love it. Some people hate it. I find it refreshing and definitely have ""love it"" checked next to the box.  Overall it's good.

My favorites are the fish and chips, the rockit and romaine salad, and the pulled pork sandwich (which I don't think they have anymore, so sad).  The atmosphere is also top-notch.

I waited for a drink showing my $$. The bartender kept walking by me back and forth but never stopped. I have no idea what he was doing. I think he may have been new and was being trained. At that point I expect the trainer to acknowledge my presence or instruct the trainee to do so. What was I thinking??? The trainer, that is if he was in fact the trainer, finally came up to me after about 10 minutes. Not friendly but there..Made the drinks with a minimal exchange of words.

I was happy to see such an extensive list of bottle and draft beers and whiskey choices they had to offer. That list alone would get me to visit this place again.  The menu had the typical British dishes but without the bland and simple tastes. If you like mussels then you have to try their mussels in vindaloo sauce. The sauce alone is worth it.  The bloke burger was large and you'll want to order the fries with curry dipping sauce to go with it.  The braised short rib sandwich was very tasty and more like a sub then a sandwich. Mixed feelings about the shepherd pie being too potato heavy and the lobster pot pie lacking more veggies. Both were still tasty and worth a try though.

My friend and I tried two of their specialty cocktails and while the ingredients were fun, they were both a bit strong.  The alcohol flavor over-powered the drink.  Other than that, I literally can't say one negative thing.  The service was great - pleasant host, on-top-of-it server who was constantly available without hovering, and bussers keeping up with clearing the table.  The food... wow!  The sausage-stuffed bacon-wrapped dates, the deviled beef and the venison wereour table's top 3.  Followed only slightly by the caprese salad and the prawns.  Even the bread impressed.

2011-05-23,5.0,"A caveat: this review pertains to pretty much every aspect of Blokes & Birds *except* their regular food menu, which I have yet to engage. Or, to begin again: my first and only experience so far at B&B occurred as a result of an eight-course Stone-beer-and-paired-fromage event they hosted in their elegantly cavernous basement space on 2 May 2011. Which is not to say I had no prior knowledge of the establishment: I had read of it, but summarily dismissed it as yet-another iteration of the ampersand-styled restaurants sprouting abundantly these days, except with the blotch of being located in a neighborhood of which I'm not particularly fond. But, this pairing menu popped up, and I had interested family who would be in the city for only one night, on that night, so I wound up just off the Belmont red-line. The space upstairs is understated, sleekly paneled with light-hued wood throughout, and appears well-organized, if fairly unimpressive. We were swiftly directed downstairs, into the much more impressive space below, where the pairing was to be orchestrated. Like a cellar, this downstairs extension is dim and bricked; it features nice, long wooden tables, an additional corner bar, and a handsomely tan-upholstered billiards table; in all, it constituted an obviously superior venue for the operation Stone and B&B had prepared. The representative from Stone, relaxed and eager, was the first to greet us after we were seated; he was courteous, and informative when prompted. His comments each round on the selected beers were not entirely unhelpful, but seemed quite basic, even reductive, and rote; he did, however, endeavor to be very available for questions. Demure, though not quite laconic, the master fromager attended to us next with introductions. She was even more knowledgeable, though likewise needed some prompting -- except when she returned with each cheese service to elaborate upon the specimen, at which point her passion for and comprehension of all the intricacies of cheese flashed outwardly. Unaffiliated with Stone, I assume, credit goes to the management of B&B for her encyclopedic presence. I *know* the management deserves credit for the response to an exigent crisis that emerged relating to the planned beer to be provided by Stone.  As explained to us by their representative: due to some licensing issues, the highly anticipated final two courses originally announced - the 2011 Imperial Russian Stout and the 2011 blended with Belgian yeast and star anise - were both unavailable, forcing B&B to improvise.  In the stead of these two ales, the restaurant provided pairing patrons with: (i) a now-rare 2008 vintage of the Imperial Russian, which it was agreed successfully ameliorated the loss of the 2011 premiere; and (ii) a shot of their house-spiced bourbon, which paired very poorly with the final cheese and was, moreover, a poor substitute for an eighth beer. However: when the owner-operator visited us at the end of the pairing to inquire regarding our experience, one of my companions mentioned these slight disappointments with the final alcoholic offering. Quickly, without hesitation, this owner-operator popped behind the bar, grabbed another bottle of the 2008, and shared it with us, apologizing again for something that was nonetheless out of his control. My family departed and our party halved; my remaining companion and I deliberated, but decided to persist for one more drink. Situating ourselves at the bar, I noticed and ordered one of my favorite beers, the Cuvee de Jacobins Rouge, and she ordered a cocktail off their crafted menu. Near the end of their keg, there was a flaw in my pour, so the bartender gave it gratis. A short time later, the owner-operator arose from the basement, made rounds, and eventually commented on our having stayed. After thanking him again for the additional stout, we spoke a little about his food-serving bar, and bars in general in Chicago. Among other things, he spoke concisely and cogently about what he was doing with his establishment, where, and why. As closing-time approached, he passed out free shots of their house-spiced bourbon to all the remaining patrons -- another welcome touch. All of which is a somewhat protracted justification for awarding five stars to a restaurant whose regular menu I haven't sampled, whose draught selection failed to especially impress, and whose cocktail offerings looked (and, in one case, tasted) sound but not extraordinary. The prices appeared, across the board, to be exceptionally reasonable -- a goal explicitly stated by the owner-operator in the course of our conversation, and naturally much appreciated, not to mention an additional appeal.   Perhaps a future standard meal at B&B will merit four, or even fewer, stars, and I hope to eventually ascertain if these five are entirely warranted. But with such attentive and outstanding service in my one experience there, at the moment I'm left with no other choice.",0.9979,0.828,0.134,0.038,0.5654237891737891

The place is very trendy and well done - it beats the typical sports bars that line Clark street near Wrigley Field.  The staff was friendly and helpful - although they were introducing a new menu and it seemed like the first items we ordered that night were not available.  Bummer - but it did work out for us. First of all - the beer list here seriously rocks!  It's a fantastic selection - including Tripel Karmeliet on tap!  They offer samples of their tap beer so you don't have to sink a couple of bucks on a beer that you may not like.  I can't wait to go back and try more selections. Now to the food.  It's pretty good - I was pleasantly surprised with a big tip of my cap to their curry sauce which is fantastic - especially with fries.  For our meal we ordered several appetizers - shrimp/prawns in the curry sauce, bacon wrapped dates, mussels, and bacon wrapped scallops.  All of which were tasty - with good usage of spices and curry sauce.  Our friends ate the venison and a pub burger - both were happy with their meals with a thumbs up for the venison.

2011-05-05,5.0,"Wrigleyville has a very nice little gem here at Blokes & Birds. I was sooo excited to hear about a chef's tasting evening organized by The Local Tourist. For only $25 per person, you got an evening of booze and food that would impress even the most staunchly British expat. We started off with local brew Two Brother Cain and Ebel, a fantastic ale. In fact, I was very impressed with all of the beers and cocktails served last night. We didn't get entire pints of each beer but it was enough to give us enough libation for each course. The first food to come out? Bacon wrapped dates stuffed with their house sausage. Holy mother of God...color me impressed. The bacon was crispy in the right places and fatty in the other places. Not soggy or too greasy. The dates weren't too sweet to overpower the savory bacon and sausage. We had two each. I could have eaten the entire serving platter. Then came a cocktail. The 'Choke Hold: Jefferson's reserve bourbon, cynar (artichoke liqueur!!!), pama liqueur, and benedictine. It was strong, sweet, and powerful. Very yummy and a nice way to showcase the bourbon. Moving on. Next we had a light green and herbs salad served with a Pims vinaigrette. What an awesome way to use Pims!!! My last memory of Pims was sipping it mixed with lemonade and cucumber/strawberry slices sitting on the Hill at Wimbledon two summers ago. Ahh a delightful summer treat. Fruity and refreshing. On a salad? Even better, perhaps. Our next beer and cocktail selections were the Metropolitan Krankshaft Kkolsch and Mind the Bollocks: Evan Williams Bourbon, Navan liqueur, Peter Heering Cherry Heering, Perfect Puree Sour Cherry Puree, lime juice, demarera syrup, and egg white. This cocktail was pretty dang tasty. The cherry puree was dark and rich and brought out the intensity of the bourbon.  But then the food kept on coming! Next was a British classic: fish and chips. But this was seriously unlike any fish and chips I'd ever had in a dreary (yet charming) London pub. B&B kicked it up a notch! The breading on the hallibut was so light and almost sweet! It reminded the people at our table of a fried dough kind of taste, which was definitely a good thing. It was served with malt vinegar aioli and thick-cut tartar sauce. The chips were also good, tossed with a bit of curry powder which brought out some spicy! I believe the final beer that was served was one of the Stone Brewery's ales, perhaps Levitation? I was a bit ""forgetful"" by the time. In fact, I was so forgetful that I didn't feed the meter and walked out of the restaurant to find a ticket on my car! Eh...it was worth it for all this amazingness. The last cocktail was by far my favorite. It tasted like blueberry pie. Called The B-Cup, it had fresh blueberries, Pimms No. 1 Cup, Aperol, Tito's Vodka, Absolut Blueberry, St. Germain, Simple Syrup, and lemon juice. To. Die. For. And then we got another course: pork tenderloin. Now, I love bacon and many pork products. But I've never been a pork steak kind of person. Until now. The meat was moist, cooked well, tender, and full of flavor. The meat came from Compart Farms and was served with rumbledthumps, mashed potatoes mixed with bits of kale. The potatoes were placed over an orange balsamic reduction sauce and the meat was paired with a mango chutney. Seriously, it was perfect. I'm now a pork believer!!! As if all of this wasn't enough, we were able to enjoy some tasty cheeses as the final course. There was a sheep's milk bleu cheese, very light and creemy; a light cheddar, not sharp at all, almost like manchego; and another kind which I'm forgetting right now. There were slices of membrillo and dates to accompany the cheese. Gahhhhhhhh I am having fantasies of another meal of this caliber! I urge you all to run to B&B to try even one of these dishes! The rest have to be wonderful as well. Excellent beer, wine, and cocktail selection. Can't wait to go back!",0.9983,0.798,0.158,0.045,0.5750654761904761

My friends made a reservation for about 15 of us for a late Tuesday dinner.  Since I am in grad-school-early-to-bed mode, I ate beforehand, so I only planned on coming for a couple beers and some chatter.  The restaurant has two floors; the area upstairs has a bar and is better suited for dining, while the basement has a separate bar, some small tables around the perimeter, and a pool table.  What I like about this place is that the tables are spaced generously and the space is open so you don't feel too crowded in (at least when we were there).  They have a pretty diverse beer list (which included my old trusty Great Lake Dortmunder Gold) covering all price points, taste preferences, and alcohol percentages.   I can't speak on behalf of the food because we were here WAYYYYY past my during-the-week curfew and I ate beforehand, but the salmon dish looked absolutely delicious.  They flavor their water pitchers with cucumber, too.  Delicious!  What I can speak upon is their hospitality and accommodation.  Our waiter was an absolutely joy - he seemed to love birthday parties as much as we all did and went the extra mile to make sure everyone was having a good time (everything from chatting with us to an abundance of group shots).  We even had a toast to the birthday girl after everyone finished eating.  By the time I had left it seemed that he was a part of our group (I am still not sure if he met them out after I left)!  All of the service was timely and everyone was happy with the venue. Clark St. in Wrigleyville is funny.  So many places come and so many places go, all with their own unique appeal.  You've got your raging Cubs bars, your comedy clubs, your reggae bars (which are a blast, btw), and now a gastropub.  Welcome to the strip and stay classy, Blokes & Birds!",0.9981,0.78,0.202,0.018,0.5784126984126983

2011-03-25,4.0,"Though I live in the loop, I spend a LOT of time in the Wrigleyville area, especially in the summer, and yeah, I love the loud, beer-soaked wings joints and the places with loud party music and an overflow of scantily-clad dunk girls and the pseudo-muscleheaded douchebags who love them, clogging up Clark street, just call me sentimental.  Blokes and Birds though, is a different place with a different vibe and I say? Vive le difference!  The beer selection is bloody massive, but not oppressively so, the whiskey menu is stout but standard (by the way, Southern Comfort isn't really whiskey, it belongs on the cordial list, fellas) and you don't really see a rye whiskey list, even at three it trumps anything close.  The food is inventive without being stuffy and make no mistake, despite this being an English Public House, the food takes its' influences from around the world. I had the seasonal stew of tomatillos, jalapenos and chicken and it was fantastic! Although those special soups and stews can be pricey, mine was $10, had I payed attention, I would have avoided it.  The fish and chips (I had cod) were good but stopped short of great. The chips were better than the fish but my SO had the rocket salad and it was fantastic.  The server, Jon I believe, was helpful, attentive and brought around a shot of spiced Evan Williams, which was dreadfully easy to drink, and had we stayed for drinks, I'd have needed a cab.  The ambiance is friendly and nice. The decor clean, simple and elegant. The communal tables are interesting, the downside being if you happen to have long legs (and I do), certain tables defeat your ability to stretch, which sucks.  The only other quirk about the place is the entry, one door works, the other doesn't. People were walking into the wrong door all night. Put a permanent sign on the non-working door please? It makes people feel bad before they even get in and psychology matters, trust me.  Overall, if you're in the neighborhood, go here.

But if you are too lazy to go to those places, you will find something to drink here that is better than 90% of the bars out there.  More importantly the other places mentioned above either don't serve food or serve food that I'm not crazy about. Blokes serves sorta high end comfort food. I like that.  Basically this is a safe place to meet out with your friends since they have food that everyone can relate to, beer for those that don't do mixed drinks and decent mixed drinks. That is why I'm a fan of this place.  Oh and one last thing, vodka is the training wheels of liquor.

2011-02-25,4.0,"I have been hearing about Blokes & Birds since before they opened.  I finally got a chance to go over and try it out.  I am glad that I did. The food is delicious.  The cocktails are even better.  I asked the bartender, Chris to make me a cocktail that was not on the menu.  He came up with several different cocktails for me and my friends.  Each of which was unique and all were amazing.  The cocktails he made were well thought out and imaginative.  My favorite was a lemon cocktail that tasted like liquid lemon meringue pie, so amazingly delicious.  Give it a name and put it on the cocktail menu ASAP. He also sampled out some of his homemade sweet tea vodka and it was the best sweet tea vodka I have ever drank.  It was a nice balanced vodka with beautiful spice notes.  If Chris is working when you come in have him make you one of his specialty cocktails.  It may take a little more time then ordering a Tanquery and tonic but it is worth it. Did I mentions the amazing list of beers they feature as well? Impressive!!! Considering the time and effort that goes into making these hand crafted cocktail you are getting a bargain at $8 or $9 a drink. Most of the other places that I go to have cocktails charge $12-$14. It is a great deal.  I am surprised that they haven't raised the prices for the cocktails. As for the rest of the staff, they were all very nice.  Whoever made the music list should be complimented on their great taste in music.  It just made the night even better. B&B has a great vibe.  It's the kind upscale bar that wrigleyville needs.  My only other comment about B&B is that they should do more to advertise and market themselves.  I follow them on Twitter and am a FB fan.  They need to talk themselves up more.  Like I said this place is great and everyone should know that.

While dining with Jeremy is a treat on its own, it was made even better with some delicious Fish and Chips. Admittedly, we didn't sample a lot off the menu- I had the special of the mahi fish and chips (super good) and Jeremy had the Bloke's Burger, which he described as ""My kind of burger- big and wet,"" which was meant as a compliment for those of you wondering. Also, they have a deal on Wednesday where you get a shot of whiskey and a beer for $5, which worked for me. Overall, our experience was pretty positive.

We were given a huge table downstairs for our group, even though the birthday girl spaced and didn't bother calling in a reservation. Our server Charlie was on point all evening. A round of peach-infused bourbon shots was given to the table. Dan personally checked in on us throughout the night and didn't seem too upset that my drunk ass kept calling him Dave. The bar itself is very sleek, yet still comfortable. The beer list is excellent. Also important to note is that they play really good music.

2011-02-20,4.0,"I joined yelp just to review this place. And though there have been several I've thought worth reviewing, and though I've used yelp 100+ times over the years, B&B deserves my time.  A note to the owners: 1. Thanks for opening a day to night establishment in the neighborhood. Wrigleyville needed a fun place for the sophisticated palette (I'm talking taste in food, drink, and ambiance). 2. The slightly higher prices (or competitive pricing compared to some of your worthy neighborhood competitors like Deleece and Mia Francesca) are well worth it (except for on the lackluster martinis in my experience). The pork tenderloin: the best in Chicago. Perfectly done. Perfect to taste. With a mango chutney on a bed of deliciously put together mashed potatoes. I pray to God you're consistent on this one. I don't know how I'll ever order anything else now. The truffle forest mushrooms app is a nice change from truffle everything else on the food scene. But your truffle mac 'n cheese is the best I've had yet - ever. While the Scotch eggs are novel, I'll probably try other, tastier apps instead. 3.  The complimentary cinnamon, etc., infused bourbon is OK, but what makes it great is that a) it's yours and b) you are gracious enough to give a drinking, eating, paying customer (and probably some who aren't) a sample. It's such a signature move and a neighborly thing to do. Kind of like what Cesars does down the street with their house tequila shots except for yours is actually the ""good stuff"".  4. It's that pride and integrity that is evident...from the food and specialty drink (see #2 and #3) to the soundtrack to our dinner (Depeche Mode, The Cure etc.) to the CC movies playing (e.g., Monty Python & The Holy Grail) to the personal ""hello, is everything OK"". I figured after the first week of greeting customers by pouring our water and sitting down with us for a drink after our meals, you'd be done with working on the ground floor. I am happy to see that you're still involved at the ""all in"" level. 5. I've brought several out of town and locals to B&B and they have all been pleased. From foodies to clubbers (which this is not) to low-key bar goers in their 20s and 30s we've enjoyed your scene on each occasion.

The semi-communal table is sort of problematic if someone is sitting in the space that ends up awkwardly backed up to you. But it was pretty. The menu looked great, so we were pretty stoked for our food... But I was sooo disappointed in dinner! :( :( :(  I started with the oxtail soup, and I like salty/savory flavors but WOW pretty salty. My friend chose a risotto, which looked great, but turned out to be loads of cute button mushrooms hiding the fact there was very little risotto. My amish fried chicken dish, which our nice server did say was still new, amounted to tasty chicken straight up buried in what amounted to basically mustard. I think the description mentioned a spicy sauce and some kind of chutney, but it really was chicken seriously drenched in mustard. Also, I wish I had been advised to order a side, because it literally was just the mustard-chicken. (I just noticed neither of our choices are on the website menu.. maybe we should've stuck to the less new choices?) I went to Owen & Engine with the bf not long ago, another English gastropub, and was maybe expecting B & B to compare, but my O & E experience start to finish was far better. Way more expensive, but the service was more knowledgable, and the food was really really great. B & B will get one more try since Yelpers seem to really like it. Although my mom would probably say, ""Oh B&B, I'm not angry, just really disappointed in you.""",0.9976,0.683,0.239,0.078,0.7015548340548338

Also, B&B is one of the few establishments to feature hand-pulled cask beer earning extra points in my book. The menu is an elevated take on traditional, hearty English pub fare in an ever crowding genre of gastropubs sprouting up with ampersands across the city.  The sheppard's pie I ordered includes 14hr stout braised lamb which when encased in mashed potato was comforting on a cold winter night.

There was a lot of tables and a communal table in the center. It wasn't too busy when we arrived but it fill up around 9PM on a Tuesday. Anyway, I started with a drink. I was in the mood to try a craft cocktail since it was a specialty instead of a martini or something I normally get. I went with the B-Cup which features blueberries, pimms no.1 cup, aperol, Tito's vodka, absolut blueberry, st. germain, syrup, and lemon juice. I was sold on the blueberries and Tito's vodka. Cool drink. Didn't blow me away, but I enjoyed two of them and felt pretty good afterward. I have to say that I wasn't too impressed with the entrees. All meat! Blah. So we decided to go with a more ""tapas"" like approach and order a bunch of different sides. So damn glad we did. First side was the baked mac n' cheese. Wow. Explosion of flavor and crunchy on top. Awesome. The chips were spectacular. How can you go to an English inspired pub and not get chips? Next we got the Rumbledthumps. What the heck is that? Whipped potatoes and kale. WOW. I didn't even know restaurants in Chicago incorporated kale into dishes. Finally, we had the curried cauliflower with caramel apples. Again, extremely tasty. A solid four stars. Fun atmosphere.

I really liked the rest of the interior though, real dark wood paneling and a dark reclaimed wood bar.  The lady had a braised shortrib sandwich with havarti cheese and some sort of curry on ciabatta bread. It was good when hot, but the cheese congealed and was just ok after a while. I had the shepherds pie with braised shortrib. This was the first time I've ever had shepherds pie, but it seemed a little bland. I expected it to be like pot pie with mashed potatoes instead of a pie crust... nope. The rest of the menu included standard English pub fare that was spiced up a little bit. I will say that the lack of sides included with the entrees is a little weak. Especially since the only ""normal"" one is fries (big enough to share). There was also some weird cauliflower / apple / caramel side that sounded interesting but intimidating for $10. I don't want to spend that on a side that might suck.

Most English or Irish pub food is pretty boring, and doesn't go very far beyond bangers and mash. I was really happy with the creativity of the food here. We went here yesterday during the whole crazy NU-UIUC mayhem and stepped into very chill, non-crazy Blokes and Birds. It's not a huge space, but they did a good job with the layout of the tables. You can sit down and eat at a +-shaped table, which can accommodate up to four 2-4 person groups, which is really much better than a whole bunch of tiny tables meant for 2 people each that really take up space when the bar is full. It's got a really nice mellow pub-like feel, but also classy (not dive-y). The food was great, and the beer selection was huge. We had the: baked mac and cheese - good flavor, a little runny (i like my cheese sauce nice and thick, but bf liked that it wasn't thick) bubble and squeak, which is made of whipped potatoes and some vegetables and fried into a croquette-like thing (not exactly, but sort of) curried cauliflower with caramel apples - very creative, and nice pairing of the curry with caramel lobster-stuffed deviled eggs with tobikko caviar - good, but tiny! basically a huge amount of money for 2 fancy eggs creme brulee - not bad, but nothing special i had the b-cup cocktail which was tasty, and bf had 2 pints of the Abbey Ale, which I also liked. Our server was really great too. It really seemed like she cared that we had a good time, and she came by at regular intervals to check up on us.  Overall, I really like Blokes and Birds. Considering how close it is to my apartment, I might just give up Rockit for awhile until they vamp up their menu (where food choices have severely declined.. truffle fries just don't make the cut for dinner) and patronize Blokes and Birds instead.

But there were accompaniments on the plate (three tiny slices of date and a squiggle of balsamic syrup) that weren't explained to us. Plus they had these weird chocolate discs sliding around on the plate as well. I still don't know why those were there. We got four tiny pieces of toasted (one blackened) bread. And they brought our food out before we had finished the cheese. I hate that. A lot. That being said, their craft cocktails are deeeelicious. I had a Churchill Downs and a Cobbles & Stone. Both great. And the burger I had with cheddar and onions and vinegar aoli- good lordy it was awesome. Really up there with one of the best burgers I've ever had. It was cooked perfectly to my specifications too, which is always nice. So I'd say if you're craving a burger or some sausages and a great cocktail this is a pretty reliable choice. Too bad it's in douchebagville- AHEM. I mean Wrigleyville. Anyway, I'd go back, but not before I try the other ampersands.",0.991,0.77,0.172,0.058,0.6036165845648604
2010-11-19,2.0,"I really wanted to like this place, I did. The pro's: friendly staff, interesting / comfy decor. The con's: the food, the beverages. We went in last week Saturday evening around 7PM for dinner. The place was sorta empty, which set my spidey senses tingling....no matter though, we persevered and after much machination about where to sit, actually did. At one of communal tables in the middle of the main room. We ordered mussels and deviled eggs to start. Then the fish & chips and pork for our main courses. The eggs were not good and by not good, I mean earth-shatteringly-bad. And we told our server, politely that this was the case. He graciously removed them from our ticket. Very cool of him. The fish & chips were a solid ""meh"" as neither stood out in any way - either positively or negatively. The pork was better but, still nothing fantastic. They were out of half the wines that night. The ""specialty"" cocktails were not that special, nor flavorful....I had the B Cup and [inappropriate yet flattering, comment about women with b-cup breasts, redacted], thats all I have to say about that. I'm truly hopeful that this place works out the kinks with its menu and really starts to bring it, as it would be a shame to have yet another mediocre establishment along this stretch of Clark.",0.799,0.816,0.113,0.071,0.42290584415584415
2010-11-19,1.0,"So, I decided i would go to this place twice before I would review it. There are two reasons for this: 1.) My first visit was on opening weekend, and to be harsh on a place on opening weekend is pretty brutal. I know this because I spent several years in the service industry and going hard on a place before it has time to work out it's kinks is just unfair. 2.) I wanted to make absolutely certain my opinions where justified.  I have to say, my first visit to Blokes & Birds was definitely the worst. I was, initially, really happy when i walked in and was greeted with smiles and welcoming attitudes. My happiness was then expounded when i saw the kid that used to wait on my girlfriend and I, over at Longman & Eagle a few months back, now working here (so that's where you went, you sly devil). We had a few quick words, he suggested a beer to me, wished me a nice meal and then went about his duties. Then, we waited.... and waited.... and waited some more. I would say, for about 5 minutes for our server to even say ""hi"" to us. This was just the beginning of a night filled with problems. All of our food arrived at the same time, which isn't really a big deal, except, the only person that even said anything, or seemed to notice or care for that matter, was my aforementioned friend, who i guess is the food runner at this place. Like, really? No server sentiment, or anything? But, whatever, I let it go. My girlfriend is enjoying her herb salad and I'm really diggin' on the beer I was suggested. The owner came over and made nice for a few minutes, which was really cool and i started to ease back into it.... then i ate the food. SADNESS WASHES OVER ME! This was, hands down, the WORST piece of pork I have ever eaten. It was dry, the accompaniments to the dish where really boring and bland and my girlfriends mussels where just absolutely foul. But, I'll even give that one the benefit of the doubt and blame us. We took the risk of ordering Vindaloos Mussels. So finally, we finish our food and after a few cocktails my lady friend decides on some dessert. We went with the butterscotch creme brulee and cheese plate. Now, one would assume that we played it safe and the rest of this meal should go along just fine, right? Well, my friends, sadly, no. The creme brulee was the consistency of cottage cheese and i mean, honestly, who the **** puts cheddar cheese on a cheese plate? ( I actually did some research, and apparently ""Chef"" Cannon, used to work at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse) - so i guess that answers that.  Anyways, i thought basing a review on that one experience alone would be unfair, so i decided to go back this week (Tuesday) for another try and, if anything, to see my Longman friend and get a new beer. But alas, my beer friend was not there and I was met with the same disappointing fare. This time i got the shepherds pie and romaine salad. The carrots and peas in the pie where few and far between and they where cold. The salad was WAY overdressed and i felt like i was fifteen again, trying to hide the taste of an ingredient I hate, except the kitchen did it for me.  I gotta say, though...  the beer menu, cocktail list and the bar staff here are awesome.... and the awesome food runner with the cool science tattoo from Longman & Eagle. The owner is pretty cool, from what I gather, and the atmosphere and overall vibe are all in place. I just wish the food and floor service matched the good qualities of this place. This place has the potential to be a real beacon of hope in a neighborhood filled with douchebag clientele and sports bars. If they re-vamp the menu and maybe take some time on the steps of service, this place will be amazing.  I will definitely be back for a beer after work, or a start-of-the-night whiskey. But, as far as I'm concerned, if you want some good pub food, go to Owen & Engine or Longman & Eagle, or any of the other ampersand spots in town.",0.993,0.778,0.143,0.079,0.5784424846924846
2010-11-18,2.0,Just returned from England so we were looking forward to this. Very good ales but virtually no wine.  Friendly but inexperienced service. Fish and chips - nice light batter but lacked flavor and fries became soft very quickly as they were wrapped in paper and served upright in a glass.  The presentation ruined them.  Friends enjoyed the mash with spinach and the sea greens were very good.,0.9519,0.656,0.264,0.08,0.6733333333333333
2010-11-14,4.0,"I was excited when I found out this place was going to open. I lived in England for 6 years and just reading the name on the door while it was under construction made me eager to try it out once it opened. The decor is very minimalistic and dark which I like, but I don't think it works in this place since it's themed after something besides prohibition era speakeasy. I expected more art on the wall or some accents (non-verbal).  The food was very well prepared and presented. Everyone (4 people) at my table ordered something different and all of the plates looked great. I had a chicken thigh sandwich and it was very good but a little difficult to physically handle since the bread fell apart half way through it and the avocado slices kept sliding out. My GF order the sheppards pie that was made with lamb instead of minced beef. I didn't know how the pie would turn out. Regretfully I never had Sheppards pie during my time in England. It was great but I think it still would've been better with the beef. The cheese on the pie was strong and might have been stilton instead of the traditional cheddar but it works with the unique combination that they have. The prices for the food aren't too high.  The beer...OMG so many choices. I am not used to so many beers being available but you can't complain about the selection. Large amount of English brews as well as Belgian brews. They also had Abbot Ale which is from the Green King brewery right by where I used to live in England. Some of the beer is priced very high but this is expected since most of them are not common in this area.   I'm pretty sure this place will attract a better crowd that the rest of Wrigleyville but I still see a bit more potential in this location. I will be going back to try more beer and the rest of the menu items.",0.9937,0.831,0.151,0.018,0.5492007936507937

2010-11-09,2.0,"Let's face it: A restaurant should never be centered around English food, especially when it's just trying to cash in on the whole ""we're not a sports bar but we're in Wrigleyville"" theme. The Highs: 1. Friendly service, just a little new and un-informed 2. Extensive beer list -- but why do the beers after the letter ""S"" have to be on the back of the drink menu? Poor beers.  Revised formatting could serve this beer list well. 3. Cross table: I hate sitting across from my boyfriend at a table so sitting cornered off from him was much more cozy 4. Break from the norm: the atmosphere is pretty cool and is a nice respite from Cubs memorabilia 5. Ladies room is on the main floor, men's room is downstairs.  Kind of a nice touch especially when you're in heels! (Note from my boyfriend reading this: I was NOT in heels on this particular night) The Lows: 1. The food: Over-priced, under-whelming, under-portioned.  The cheese plate is $15 and I'm pretty sure it was picked up from Jewel earlier that day.  Lobster risotto: Well-prepared, just not that good.  Everything else was basically English themed, and as we've learned from Jim Gaffigan: English food is gross. 2. Wine List: Horrible.  Insulting!  With a beer and cocktail list as extensive as theirs, how can they justify this?   3. Music: All English musicians.  I get it, the theme, blah blah, but....the mix was a little off. 4. Only 1 viewable television....playing Monty Python.  I love MP just as much as the next person, but on a silent loop in a bar?

2010-11-08,5.0,"In the midst of Lakeview, practically the heart of Wrigleyville, nestles a unique and chic English gastropub.  It's refreshing to find a place that allows you to step outside the realm of ""sports bar"" scene.  A much needed haven in the neighborhood. I love food and alcohol, and per my bf probably a bit too much on the latter.  So opening night we found our way to my new winter retreat, Blokes and Birds.  I walked in greeted with the warmth of smiles and a nice toasty fireplace.  Beautifully decorated with dark, rich colored wood and a very appetizing drink and food menu.  However, we'll get to the menu later.  The light in the room was lowered to the perfect dim, which allowed for the candles on the tables to create the most fitting ambiance. +1 star.  The Kicks (Drinks):  The selection of beers, spirits, and cocktails offered is very impressive.  My sister ordered the Breakfast at Tiffany's, which B&B was very generous with the alcohol.  I ordered myself a pint of beer, which I cannot remember the name of.  However, we all had a couple of shots of the house custom made Makers, prepared in a marinade of spice and fruits.  It was absolutely delicious.  The spice and fruit creates a hint of flavor and does not take away from the taste of the whisky.  I have never tried anything like this, so +1 star for introducing me to something new and tasty! The Licks (Food):  We tried almost everything on the menu.  Not disappointed at all.   -  I love french fries.  I think you'll see it mentioned in my profile somewhere.  The fries here - yum!   -  Mussels with vindaloo sauce is a must try.  The sauce is not overpowering, making it perfect for bread dipping. -  Foie burger is so juicy and delicious.  Packed with flavors and the truffle fries is a nice compliment. -  Fish and chips came with more fries!  No complaints here. =)  Fish was not overcooked nor too oily.  The filet broke off the perfect crunch and did not sog up after being left on our table.  We found ourselves nibbling on all the dishes as the evening progressed.  My bf's fave and has become a fave of mine as well. -  The sides were all good.  They all had very unique names and since I'm not English I can't remember it for the life of me. If I had to recommend one dish it would definitely be the Foie Burger cooked to medium.  So savory... Oh and the fish and chips, and the mussels, but definitely the burger.  I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.  +1 star for the food. The Journey (Service):  Our server was friendly - not overly attentive which gave us our time to chat without constant interruption of how our evening was going.  He was back to refresh our drink and was available when we needed him.  +1 star The Pinch (Our Tab):  Every great evening must come to an end.  Some with a punch and some with a pinch.  For three people dining, we were all surprised at how reasonable our bill came out to be.  The beautiful thing about it is that all tax is included in the price of the food.  No separate row for ""Tax 10.25% - Alcohol 11%"" ordeal.  What you see on the menu is what you pay.  +1 star.

2010-11-07,2.0,"Food: - Generally, portions run small and you feel like you didn't get value for your money. - Bangers and mash did not have mustard and were not entree sized (requires at least a starter or a side in addition).   - Fries were great, wish they or something else with carbs and salt came when the beer came so we could munch while we drank - Mac and Cheese was decently good (but required more seasoning), but not worth $10  - Mussels were good, but not amazing and again, small portion sized. - Burger was juicy and flavorful but very messy to eat, no accompanying sides - Fish and chips were delicious Timing:   - 1 hour and 45 minute wait for a table.   - 10 minutes until the waitress could check on us - 28 minutes from order placed to food on the table (which is actually pretty good) - We didn't eat until 10:30 pm Pros:   - Extensive beer selection, plenty of beers you would want to try including ones that are fairly rare (the girls particularly enjoyed original sin hard cider and timmermans lambic) - There are beers on draught (14 types), austria (1), belgium (8), england (6), germany (1), scottland (1) and us (28) - Waiters were very sweet, apologetic and helpful. - Nice music selection which added to the loud and bustling atmosphere - Management obviously cares and was vigilant on the details (wiping down tables, greeting guests) - Glasses with water vs glasses with cider repeatedly got confused by our waitress.  - Some inventory issues:  ran out of 2 brothers beer and did not have all the beers on the menu in stock. Cons:  - Ridiculous wait time - While the design concept was neat (exposed brick, different wood grains, etc), the practicality needs work.  Bar lounge tables were too low and not wide enough to hold both alcohol, water, and food so people ended up either hunched over the table or eating on their lap.  Poor use of space, more tables and seating is definitely needed and can be put in.  Stools needed for waiting area. - Poor lighting, you should be able to see what you're eating and read the menu Overall: Food and atmosphere were not enough to compensate for the absurd wait time and the disconnect between value and price.  I wish birds and blokes the best and I hope they can learn how to turn over tables more quickly and figure out the design issues so patrons don't feel the need to have to eat either hunched over a coffee table or with they're dinner in their lap.

2010-11-06,2.0,"Blokes and Birds has good potential, but is off to a bad start with me, largely because of a night of poor service with our server, Charlie.  We arrived and ordered beers.  Charlie told me my first choice was out of stock, and then told me my second choice was out of stock, and then disappeared for several minutes and brought my my first choice, despite telling me it was out of stock.  He brought my fiancee a glass of wine shortly thereafter, but did not bring my friend her beer until I had almost finished my first beer approximately 20 minutes later, even though she ordered at the same time the rest of us did. Later, I ordered a Bell's Amber.  Charlie disappeared for quite awhile and came back and told me the bar didn't stock the beer I had requested.  I pointed to the beer menu, which stated ""Bell's Amber,"" and Charlie got flustered, apologized, and said he thought I had asked for an Alexander.  I think we all know there isn't a beer called Alexander, and if you don't know that, you shouldn't be working in a beer bar. A bit later, my fiancee ordered another glass of wine.  Charlie asked if she wanted a glass of water instead and brought her water.  She was not drunk or overserved, and she was insulted that he treated her that way.  Overall, he made the experience very unpleasant. This isn't to say that Blokes and Birds doesn't have potential.  Their beer list was impressive (if they end up having what they list in stock).  Moreover, the owner or manager (a gentleman in a sportcoat and scarf with a shaved head) did a great job of picking up Charlie's slack across the bar and trying to help.  I will try Blokes and Birds again and hope to have a better experience, but they have some obstacles to overcome.",-0.4901,0.823,0.084,0.093,0.4228095238095238

2010-11-05,2.0,"Let me begin by saying B&B started off as a 5 star restaurant.  The space itself is wonderful.  Unlike so many of the Wrigleyville / Lincoln Park restaurant / bars, we weren't assaulted by the smell of beer, the glare of a dozen flat screens showing a variety of sports or deafening music.  Instead, a clean, warm, beautifully furnished modern room large sensibly put together.  There is interesting music playing and two TV's displaying Monty Python movies. The menu reads quite well...we decided to try the ""poached beef"" and the ""lobster bisque"" followed by ""fish and chips"" and ""chicken tikka marsala"". The poached beef didn't quite live up to its billing as spicy and unique.  It is a wonderfully tender piece of beef, however, it is void of much flavor.  The vindaloo sauce is average at best and the pickled side is far too small.  The appearance of the plate is odd....a massive lump of brown meat and unappetizing at best. The Lobster Bisque was hot and rich, however, the presence of previsouly frozen prawns was an odd and unncessary addition....it isn't the best but certainly isn't the worst.   The Fish and Chips had one of the nicer picces of Atlantic Cod anywhere in the city ... however, it was fried in a batter that was slightly sweet and almost tasted like a donut.  If you are going to claim the F&C is inspiring by English ""chippies"", serve us real chips, not some generic french fry that is eerily similar to those found at just about all decent bars in the area.   Chips are such an inexpensive item to serve, but can easily make or break a dish if they don't hit the spot. The chicken was incredibly tender, however, a little too subtle on the flavor and served with a mushy piece of cauliflower and dollop of rice.  Not a special dish, but also not a terrible dish. I have to say, the kitchen is very good a churning out fork tender meat....now they should work on imparting some flavor upon their creations. Our side of bubble and squeak was overly creamy for our tastes and nothing like the B&S we grew up eating. Overall, the restaurant is in its teething stage, however, we both agreed that the atmosphere and serving staff are more than capable of pulling off a ""gastro-pub"" feel, but they are fighting a loosing battle as the kitchen is still figuring out what they should be doing.",0.9955,0.815,0.163,0.022,0.5890922619047619

You will not regret it. *The Foie burger - shmear some garlic aioli on it. It's like heaven, extremely juicy burger with truffle fries - you can't go wrong with this combination. *The lobster bisque was one of the best I've had. I've usually come across a lot of places that tend to over-season it, so it's usually way too salty for me, but it was great here. *The pork tenderloins were some of the most tender cuts of pork I've ever had.
