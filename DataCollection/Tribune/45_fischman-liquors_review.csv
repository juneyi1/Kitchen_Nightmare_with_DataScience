2016-06-19,5.0,"Never reviewed this place? I'm very shocked, that will change now. Just an amazing beer selection, and their bar never fails to amaze me with all the beer selection it has on tap. They do have some whiskey selection, spirits, and some cocktails for non-beer drinkers, as well. BYO food, and I love the events they do on certain nights, such as Tap This and Tap That on Tuesdays and Thursday nights to highlight rare beers of a certain brewer(s). It's even better, that they invite certain food trucks to park outside and serve food, as well. There's also a connected to go package store in the north half of the space, where almost always I find some craft beer or more, to satisfy my fancy. They do also sell spirits, liqueurs, and wine in that store, and it always looks like to me there's a decent selection of those things, even if say there isn't quite the amount you'd see at a Binny's store. Small dart area in a corner back right part of the bar, so if you're going or leaving towards their bathrooms and have to walk through there, keep that in mind so you're aren't in the way of those using their dart board. I'm very saddened like others, to hear the news that they will be closing after Sunday, July 17th. Luckily when I visited last night, I did hear from an employee that they think they're in talks to move into a new space a few blocks south on Milwaukee, so fingers crossed that they will be able to move to that space! This is the best craft beer bar on the northwest side, without any doubt.",0.9847,0.815,0.149,0.036,0.4755366161616163

It's a liquor store/bar, but it's nice that the spaces are totally separated, so you don't feel like you're actually sitting in a store.  I don't really understand the corkage fee if you're drinking something you bought at the attached store (which isn't done at other, similar spots).   If you stick to what's on tap, there are a ton of good options.  They have very unique beers/ciders and you can get flights and smaller taste sizes if you want to try a few or don't want an entire beer. The staff was pretty friendly and prices were really reasonable. The liquor store next door had a really interesting selection of beers/wines/etc and some rare finds.

The entire room is the bar. It's a huge beautiful wood oval bar with a few scattered tables around it. Attached on one side of the room is the liquor store.  This is not a Budweiser bar. I mean, you could come here and order a Bud, but you'd be missing out on all the amazing craft beers they have. Every time we come here, we always get to try something new.  Each and every single bartender we've had has always been really friendly, knowledgeable, and attentive. You never sit at the bar with an empty glass. We often ask for suggestions, and they always get it right. Sometimes we stay long enough where we get hungry. They have no problem if you bring in outside food to nom and they even have frozen pizzas they'll cook up for you if you ask.  They always play the games on TV and the UFC fights. We come here often to watch those but Thursdays are the nights to be here. It's their ""Tap this"" night where they have a bunch of specialty beers and food trucks are parked outside.

The bar on the south part of the establishment has bar stool seating around the bar which is centered in the middle. Televisions line the outer walls of the bar so you can watch whatever sporting event across the bar. Locals and regulars seemed to hold this place down. It was pretty busy on a Friday night. Drinks are affordable and shots are cheap too. We ordered a few ""specialty"" shots that the bartenders didn't know but they got the hang of it pretty quickly.

Flash forward to now and I'm looking for some local brews (particularly Pipeworks) a family member suggested I bring for some chefs.

It's the next morning and I take a look at the bill.  They sure have expensive ice $3 up charge if you get $4 whiskey on the rocks.  Now I will admit I didn't notice last night but I did have 5 whiskeys and was being a social butterfly. But come on, MAN!  The menu does state some whiskeys are 1 or 2 oz pours.  Which is kinda peculiar.  But I didn't see anything saying $3 for ice. It's not even the artisanal hand made stuff in a perfect sphere or cube! I don't think it was flown in from Antarctica or the North Pole it's just ice! If you look outside right now there is tons.  Anyhow I feel a bit cheated I thought ohh they have decent prices but after the on the rocks charge this place could be in any of the trendy neighborhoods.  Also, an FYI the menu on the website does break it down a bit but it's not the same menu that's at the bar. The whole menu I guess is just shot prices and misleading.  I just want a shot poured into a glass sprinkled with some frozen water. Hey man it's a bar we shouldn't have to read fine print! Did the owner used to work for a bank or credit card company? Now onto the service. The bartender was a nice guy,  I asked him which whiskey I should have next and he kinda looked blankly at me.  I then asked about a certain one and he said we sell a lot of that in the store. The place is attached to a liquor store.  For $7 jack daniels on the rocks I would expect the bartender to know something about whiskey.  Dissapointing....    In the end I guess they don't want to serve spirits, just drink beer.  Hopefully they don't charge more if it's cold.",0.9826,0.848,0.127,0.025,0.48856764928193497

2014-05-09,4.0,"This place is going to be trouble. Let me set the scene. I just moved in to my new apartment in Jefferson Park, which is walking distance from this lovely establishment, and needed some beers for backyard drinking. My friend and I stopped in to the liquor store and picked up several 6 packs ranging from fancy Japanese cider to tecate (because that's how we roll motherf*@ker) to enjoy while sitting out of doors.  The liqour store opens right in to the bar, and it turns out she knows one of the bartenders next door. He informs us that we are early. ""Early for what?"" we ask. Oh, as it happens they are having a Cinco de Mayo celebration. After some internal debate we decided to take a pass on that and headed back to my place with drinks in hand.  Fast forward several hours (and drinks) later and we decide to go back to Fischman's to enjoy the sights. We stumble and swerve down these fine city streets and manage to arrive uninjured. We find some seats at the giant bar and get settled in for some more imbibing. Turns out these bartenders really know their stuff. They even take classes about it and stuff. All I know is I slurred a general idea of what I like and was brought a very tasty libation. I'm not even sure what it was to be honest, but I know I had a few.  They had a DJ who was kind enough to play my request for some britpop (Romeo Void - Never say Never) which sparked a whole conversation and more music requests, and basically a really fine evening of tasty alcohol and amusing conversation.  All in all I can seem myself back at this bar very soon. Only next time, I'm going to call it a night when this place closes.

I mean:  loud MMA on the 20 xillion big flat screen TVs 90% dudes.. watching MMA, with their mouths hanging open Crappy, cheap uncomfortable bar stools that slide around on the ceramic tiled (? why?) floor Not enough overhang on bar - so you can't really ""belly up to the bar"" More room behind the bar than IN the bar Weird overall look - like someone's basement, only less professional I'd come back for the great beer list - but sitting there and hanging out ?  Ugh - just wasn't comfortable or interesting or fun. Will re-visit, but at this time, can't really recommend, was hoping for something more of an authentic Chicago dive bar experience - comfy stools at least.",0.1544,0.757,0.117,0.125,0.5201822916666665

2013-03-13,1.0,"They cleaned up the place, but the management sucks. It used to be a shot and a beer joint, and the prices were quite reasonable. Now they yuppified the place and they raised the prices sky high. I've been there on numerous occasions, and they have never bought me a drink on the house. I think the place is under new management, and the young guy that manages the joint is a jerk. There are many places to drink in the city that appreciate your business. This place isn't one of them. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this joint. You'll thank me for it.         Can you believe it? After I posted this review, I received the following e-mail, I'm guessing it came from the jerk that manages the place: ""Nice review!! We don't have to give you a ""free"" drink!! Just a FYI it's illegal to give out ""free Drinks""!!!"" Can you believe his response? It's now against the law for the house to buy you a drink. That's a new one on me. I guess all the other bars in the city are breaking the law then. Hey everybody, make sure the next time you're in a bar, and the bartender buys you a drink, you call the police and turn him/her in. Unbelievable! Even more reason to stay away from this place. And by the way, if you're such a law-abiding citizen, how come the city shut down your expansion plan next door? Could it be you're not so law-abiding after all, just greedy? Sorry pal, you're just a poor excuse for a businessman. I knew it was going to be just a matter of time before they closed. The owner was a greedy jerk and got what he deserved. I hope you enjoy waiting in the unemployment line.",0.7922,0.782,0.12,0.099,0.49045648795648794

You may not be surprised by the working class crowd and the abundance of television machines found in Fischman's, but when you gaze upon the beer list you may wonder when Hopleaf moved west and became Fischman's Last Chance Saloon.  They have an excellent selection including St Bernardus on tap (a rare find indeed) and many other draughts that are not typical of the neighborhood or nearly anywhere.   I'm still not clear on the policy, either because it's confusing or I'm simple, but beer can be purchased at the adjoining liquor store and brought here to pound down.  There is a $5 cork fee that comes with the scheme (used in the American way, not the British one) and this will somehow save you $1 dollar.  I will not attempt to do this as it will most assuredly get me yelled at.",0.8915,0.882,0.073,0.045,0.39463423050379587

I can't think of too many female bartenders who could survive it, but she does it with a big smile and a sense of humor. She's really vocal about her love for this place. It's contagious.

Yes, yes, the beer inventory is great and the staff is helpful and it is clean and the prices are totally reasonable, but beyond that this place is really making an effort to get in the mix with the community and just do some fun stuff to try to breathe some much-needed liveliness into Jefferson Park.  The events I have been to have been really solid, other people/neighbors in attendance with whom I have chatted have been really friendly and pleasant and overall this place just has some really good mojo. I hope it doesn't get too crowded or crazy popular so it will still be nice to go here, but I do want to see them succeed so they can just keep doing what they are doing! Keep it up Fischman's!
