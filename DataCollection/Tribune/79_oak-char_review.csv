2016-08-17,4.0,"Came here for my birthday dinner with a group of about 8-10 people including myself. I was really pleased with their ability to accommodate larger parties. They have a good wine selection and drink menu.  I think my only complaint is the service is on the slower end. So if you're in a hurry, I'd probably choose a different place. It could also have just been our server that wasn't super attentive. I know we had a large table but it shouldn't take as long as it did for bottles of wine to arrive and to finally take our food order.  The food was really good. Very diverse menu. Almost random.  I started with the kale salad which I thought was kind of boring. Either give me less kale or more toppings because it kind of tasted like a plate full of grass.  The tartare was amazing though! And my friends dishes were really good. The crispy chicken sandwich (hot/spicy) and steak were done perfectly. Also my friend had the risotto which was perfect!  I enjoyed dining here and wasn't disappointed but it wasn't quite 5 stars.",0.9933,0.729,0.238,0.033,0.685626102292769

2016-07-09,4.0,"Fab! I have been here several times and really enjoy Oak + Char. I like the ingenious spot it is stashed in a loft building on a side street near the brown line. Only the hippest hipsters can find it. I like the seminal, cloud-like decorations and the low lighting. And I like how easy it is to easily snag a seat at the bar on a Friday night. If you're lucky.  What I don't like are as follows:  The service is pretty crappy, both at the bar and at tables. Order everything you want whenever your server deigns to acknowledge you, because they may not be coming back for a while. (Or at least until after they've had their smoke break.) Deal with it, geez.  I also find their cocktail menu weak, including the fact that they are ALWAYS out of their ""signature"" frozen drink. Lame. Finally, I am unimpressed by their ""innovative"" twists on informal favorites that should be left alone. Like wings (""M.S.G Wings"") and hushpuppies (octopus hushpuppies to be exact.) Bitch-session complete. Overall I mostly love (to hate) Oak + Char.",0.9686,0.733,0.19,0.077,0.5738636363636364
2016-06-26,2.0,"We've walked by this place several times, so decided to stop in for an early, casual Saturday dinner after a busy day. They accommodated a last-minute reservation for 5, which was great. We went on a hot summer's day (e.g. 90 degrees), and noticed right away that we were still sweating at our table - they tried to ""adjust the AC,"" but told us the whole building was connected and the best they could do was bring extra ice to the table to add to our water. Waitress was quick and could easily describe the food, so we ordered fries (we were starving!), several salads with smoked chicken added, the fire-roasted chicken entree, and a cheeseburger. While the fries and cheeseburger got rave reviews, all of the chicken tasted extremely salty (my 3yr old only ate the chicken because he thought it was sausage!). We survived the salad, but when we told the waitress that the roasted chicken was nearly inedible, she told us that ""Each person has a different palate and you're just tasting the peruvian spices that we use after brining the meat..."" We felt a little humbled and tried again, but felt (still) hot and not hungry enough to persevere. A manager came over and asked what happened; when we explained the salt issue to her, she stated that ""You're probably not used to this taste,"" but that it didn't matter and rightfully took the dish and deducted it from our check.  Overall, not the worst experience I've had an in a restaurant, but far from somewhere I'd be willing to go again until they reinvest their spice/salt budget in air conditioning!",0.9712,0.91,0.08,0.01,0.6095238095238095

I'll probably come back here for their deals, the burger is amazing. I had the De Koven which was really good but I don't think it was too strong. Next time I'll probably stick with one of their drafts. It was just me and another friend and we split a burger, and two sets of wings and fries. The aioli sauce with the fries was really good, fries were meh. The MSG wings were much better than the Bacon Sambal wings, but I typically don't like wings from fancier places. The burger was downright amazing - it was $8 for only the burger during HH but you should definitely get it. They didn't top it off with much, just caramelized onions, bacon, cheddar cheese and pickles. Those are my favorite things on a burger so A+ here. We had outdoor seating as well.

Short ribs were surprising - in a good way; a lot of fun veges there. As was the Trout Crudo - but because it was so small! But also because of surprising citrus flavors.  They take their cocktails very seriously. (Observed them being made at the bar) Would have really liked a more expansive menu to try out more cocktails! Service is attentive and top notch. Good clearing of plates, and placing new silverware across dishes.  It's a good spot for ordering lots of small plates. Just note that the food takes awhile, so be patient, and order a variety.

I wish we had just ordered a bucket of them! Both of us opted for the OC Burger, which was $8 instead of $14. That's my kind of deal! Burger was really good. I think there were a few too many sauteed onions though, as that kind of dominated the burger and left that taste in my mouth for a couple hours...

Service was excellent.  I believe the place is BYOB, but I'm not sure if that's always the case.  They waive the corkage fees on Sundays and Mondays, so that's sweet.  They do have booze available if you haven't brought your own. I gotta knock a star off because of the prices.  The food was good, but the prices are about 25-50% higher than they should be. * MSG Chicken Wings (maple+sherry+gochujang), cilantro yogurt - $8 Decent, pretty meaty wings.  You only get about 6 for your $8 investment.  The sauce is quite sweet.  Kinda tastes like a knockoff of what you'd get at Crisp.  Mmmm, Crisp. * Whipped Burrata, hummus + chickpea salad, house-made roti - $8 You get a super-tiny jar with a couple of leaves and chickpeas and like 3 ounces of burrata at the bottom.  It comes with a few slices of roti bread.  I enjoyed this, but it's not much food. * Fire Roasted Chicken, heirloom peruvian potatoes, chimichurri, chicken jus - $26 This was probably my favorite dish.  It's a half-chicken and the meat was wonderfully tender.  It just fell right off the leg bone, which is great.  The peruvian potatoes weren't very good and I needed to douse them with salt and sauce to bring them up to par.  Although the chicken was good, $26 is pretty steep for what it is. * Korean Braised Beef Short Rib, charred carrots + turnips, broccoli rabe, shitake mushroom - $23 Man, you get a minuscule amount of short rib.  Yes, it was very tender, but it's an incredibly small portion.  Pretty good, but not nearly as good as the chicken. Would I go back?  Maybe.  Most of the dishes do have a blackened char to the outside of them (hence the name).  The BYOB aspect, especially minus the corkage on Sunday and Monday saves this from being a total money-suck, but the prices are quite out of whack compared to the portions.",0.9976,0.78,0.21,0.011,0.6361535622000738

2016-02-01,4.0,"This place saved my birthday dinner after a broken grill left us disappointed and wandering River North. Got a last minute reservation on Opentable after much Yelping and deliberation. Sadly they were preparing to roll out a new menu the next day and were out of two of our top choices (pickles and lamb belly). Still, this place deserves a full dish-by-dish breakdown: Octopus fritters: this place gets an A+ on their fried stuff. Not greasy, perfect crisp. Octopus was hardly noticeable, but man that kimchi aioli was good. Burrata with green harissa: nice take on burrata. House-made naan was amazing. Fjord trout crudo: meh, an odd pairing of things sprinkled over a plain white sauce. Shoulda got pig tails. They are really good at frying things here. Burger: two thin patties, which they don't mention. The beef fat onion rings are actually ON the burger, not the side. It came with boring chips. Keep the burger the same, give us more onion rings, skip the chips: perfect. Would not hate on more pickles, either. EDIT: HOW COULD I FORGET THIS! They offer three different types of hot toddy for two. rum, whiskey, and gin (I think). We had the whiskey and then the rum based one. Yes, two. If you like hot drinks, do it. It's $20 and the equivalent of at least three drinks. The other cocktails were not my fav. Worst Intentions was way too sweet. Thought the gin would even out the maple but nope.

Crowdedness is contingent on time of day, so I understand that can vary. But there's no excuse for mediocre food.  Nothing clicked on the menu. I had the benedict and it included a fried oyster, which just seemed like a distraction and was so out of left-field that I could see how a lot of patrons wouldn't get it or enjoy it. To top it off, the eggs were under poached. You can't under poach eggs benedict, that's culinary school stuff 101.  I could tell me other tablemates were equally underwhelmed with their dishes, which was disappointing for me as birthday boy as I heard great things about this place and it ended up being a dud.

2015-12-07,2.0,"I returned to Oak + Char on a recent Friday night. It's been almost a year since my last visit, so I had a high hopes for a better experience. Unfortunately most things have not changed.  A couple of major turnoffs: --Our server tried to rush us through the meal. We arrived at 6pm and it was not busy. He gave a long-winded explanation of nearly everything on the menu, which wasn't necessary; in fact it was overwhelming. We struggled to decide on a bottle of wine and he continually recommended bottles which were $75 or $105. [It's worth noting that the bottle selection is good, but prices seem to fall into one of four categories: $45, $75, $105 or above. Not much in between]. He appeared to be displeased when we chose a bottle that was $45. There were several attractive options on the menu-- so much so that we couldn't decide which courses we wanted. Initially we chose two dishes and said we would decide on the rest the next time around. He remarked, ""We get extremely busy so I'd encourage you to put in five dishes now."" First of all, I shouldn't be rushed to pick a dish when I'm a tapas restaurant. Secondly, the number of dishes we want for the entire night shouldn't be assumed. We went against his recommendation and only put in for two courses. In contrast to what he said, the dishes came out quite promptly. Kudos to the kitchen.  --The food is really hit or miss. Skip the buratta. It's covered in a spicey pesto and completely overwhelmed. The dish is more like a dip instead of typical buratta. The chicken wings, as others have said, are great. Must-get. Although the texture was good, the gnocci was flavorless. Skip it. The chocolate cake was fabulous. Overall the food was inconsistent.  Sadly this is very similar to what I experienced a year ago. Oak + Char is very pretty-- the ambiance is nice. I'd skip the food and go for a nice glass of wine or cocktail.",0.9898,0.822,0.142,0.036,0.5183749999999999

2015-11-03,1.0,"It is amazing what a difference a year makes.  My initial review of this place was true and solid of my experience; however, a recent visit with some friends prompted me to update my review.  A friend of mine wanted to go take advantage of their Happy Hour (he himself always raves about this place and has been there close to a dozen times).  Everything we had that night: MSG Wings, Duck Meatballs, Lamb Belly, and their burger special.  Everything was either overly salty or lacked taste and flavor.  One of my friends commented that she felt that the Duck Meatballs actually tasted as if they were straight out of the freezer.  I absolutely did not like them at all and completely agreed that it didn't taste fresh.  Their wings were not only overly salty, but were overcooked.  Their burger was dry and didn't taste like a juicy burger should for such an establishment.  Out of everything, the lamb was probably the best, but the presentation was sorely lacking as it looked like they just plopped everything on the plate and it absolutely didn't look appetizing at all.  If you could overlook this aspect, the lamb was decently tender and in flavor.  While the waitstaff and (I believe) the manager came by to apologize and then explain to us that they were short-staffed, two things occurred after that which prompted me to write this review.  The first was that one of my friends had apparently told the waitress that I had recently celebrated my birthday.  It was a complete surprise to me and unknown to me at the time until the waitress brought over a plate of their donuts with a candle lit over to me.  This was a pleasant surprise until we saw that the restaurant ended up charging us for the donuts once the bill came.  While it is never expected that a restaurant do anything explicitly for its patrons should they be celebrating a birthday, it has been my experience that if they do, they do not charge their patrons for the item that they bring out!  This, coupled with the fact that they only discounted about $36 off our entire bill (there were six of us that night that not only ordered the above-mentioned food, but ordered a number of drinks as well) made me feel compelled to update my review.  While we didn't expect them to comp our entire bill, the fact that they charged us for any of the food was a bit of a surprise considering the feedback we gave them in addition to the admission on their part that they had a reason for the low quality of their food for that evening.   Needless to say, my friend who raved about Oak + Char was highly disappointed, along with the rest of us who all shared similar sentiments regarding the quality of their food and the way in which our evening ended with them.",0.9898,0.843,0.122,0.036,0.5834733893557423

Overall, it's not worth it. The price point for some of the dishes didn't make sense. I understand it's small plate vs. large plate concept but I feel like some of these dishes should just be called what they are an appetizer or a main. The squash blossoms were ok but mostly ricotta and not squash. The Pork belly was all fat and about the size of index card. I understand pork belly is supposed to be fatty but not ALL fat. The Local Burrata was nice and I felt like that was the only dish worth ordering again. We also ordered the short ribs which were Ok but not anything to sing praises about.  The service was lackluster. We were brought out two dishes before I was able to get a place setting and I ended up having to ask someone who was not my server.

When: last Wednesday Where: Oak + Char Why: half price double cheeseburgers and discounted cocktails and wings during happy hours of 4:30-6:30!  Why not?! It was a pleasant hump night, so we dined on the outdoor patio.  If you eat inside, you'll notice the unique interior, with the billowy white cloths overhead and chairs that look like those massages ones where you face downwards. The $8 ($4 off) cocktails are worth it!  So is the $6 ($2 off) order of MSG wings... no, not that MSG, as we all thought.  It's maple, sherry, and gochujang (chili). I definitely got the sweet flavor of the maple and loved the crispy texture of the wings, but they weren't as hot as expected.  While the basil gnocchi was bright and flavorful, it was literally 5 pieces of gnocchi for $16, even though it does come with a little rabbit and goat cheese. Double cheeseburger here is claimed to be #4 in the city, our waitress shared with us (not sure who the critics were).  I think we all agreed we've had better burgers, and more than just 3 better burgers at that.  I liked the juiciness of the patties, but there was an overly sweet element to the sauce that when coupled with the pickles inside the burger, made me feel like I was eating caramel apple wedges.  Burger is also advertised as coming with beef fat onion rings, and it took a little while to figure out that the onion ring (singular) was inside the burger (it was really overshadowed by the c+d* sauce). Friendly, attentive service.  Glad to have tried this place out. *Fun story on the c+d sauce (I happened to ask what it is).  Oak + char makes a housemade A1 sauce for the burger and used to have it printed like that on the menu... until one day, someone from Kraft saw it and sent a cease and desist letter.  Sooo, the kitchen continues to make the sauce, but it appears as c+d sauce for cease and desist.",0.9945,0.832,0.157,0.012,0.533531746031746

For an app we got burrata, which was probably the most lackluster cheese I've had in my life, aside from string cheese. It came with a lot of tomatoes, which weren't ripe enough, and two small pieces of burrata on two slices of toast. Forgettable at best. As our entree we ordered smoked chicken, which came with a very delicious sauce. My biggest complain about the food is the saltiness, which was overpowering every dish. Their cocktails are on the sweeter side, so if you like dry drinks, you're better off ordering off the menu. The service: 5/5. The service was fast and attentive. No complains there. Overall: 4/5.

When the waiter asked, I kindly mentioned it and he just shrugged.  The wings and ham hoc soup had good flavor but loads of salt. Similar but better wings can be found at Mott St or Parachute.  The Cuban and homemade chips were well executed.  The shot rib was well cooked but could only eat a 1/4 before surrendering to salt. The barley on the other hand was bland which I needed, but served over oil which made it heavy. The dish was missing balance.

Not to mention the light fixtures looked like someone threw some bedsheets on them.  I could see that getting a love/hate response. As far as their menu, most of their items are meant to be shared.  I find that to be a cool trend at a lot of places around the city lately.  We unintentionally started with the wontons as a food runner dropped it off at our plate since they made extra.  The chili honey on the plate made them interesting but not sure if I'd get them again.  I also tried the salt baked beets.  I feel like I'm a sucker for beets, if they're on the menu they are going to be on my plate.  In this case they were some of the better ones I've had.  They came with hazelnuts and these little rye bread crisps.  It reminded me of picking the rye crisps out of the bags of Gardettos.  If you're looking to get some vegetables that you wouldn't normally get I'd recommend them. We got the burger and crab legs as our mains.  My burger was solid all round, cooked well and had this sauce that I couldn't quite put my finger on but it was almost like a thousand island.  I also snuck some of those onion rings into the burger because why not?  The crab legs though were the star, I really wish I had ordered a full plate to myself.  I imagined you would get a tiny portion but for getting king crab in River North it was well worth it.  They even split them in half for you so getting the meat out was a breeze.  Not to mention the crispy rice and coconut sauce.  It was definitely the winner of the night.   Overall I thought Oak +Char is definitely worth a visit.  It's not going to blow you away but everything from the food to the service to the ambaince made for a great night out.",0.9947,0.82,0.157,0.023,0.4530140110785272

2015-06-11,2.0,"Oak + Char came highly recommended by a close friend. Maybe it was an off-night, but I would have to say, aside from the cocktails and company, I was disappointed. The main issue was the inconsistency of the temperature's dishes. In a place commanding a rather high price point, this seems unacceptable to me. Additionally, it's advertised as a 'tapas style' place where dishes come out when ready, which seems to contradict the issue with temperature. If it was hot and ready, why was there a lag in coming to my table? If Little Caesar's can do it, surely Oak + Char can too. We started with the Charred Burrata which was delicious. Unfortunately the Ravioli Doppio was lukewarm at best, which detracted from what likely would have been a tasty dish. The Ramps a la Planxa was also disappointing, albeit hot. It was essentially a large bowl of potatoes for 11 bucks. Our main course, the Wood Grilled Pork Collar, which was tender and full of flavor, was ruined by it's cool temperature and the smoked clams and farro that accompanied it were actually cold. Whether an issue with the chef or the runners, to have food temperature cloud what potentially could have been an enjoyable eating experience, is unacceptable. No way I'm giving this place another shot, but from reading the other reviews, sounds like an off night.",0.6648,0.737,0.141,0.121,0.6603968253968254

We also saw that they have a cute patio seating area, and a cool private room which would be great for groups.  We started with the MSG wings which were delicious. The sauce was amazing, and the wings were topped with green onion and cilantro which added a great note of freshness. That was quickly followed by the beef tartare served with homemade salt and pepper potato chips. The addition of the potato chips was fun and made the dish interesting.  We also tried the charred burrata with green harissa  and homemade naan. This was so good, the warm burrata was gooey and cheesy  and the harissa added a peppery note that was not too spicy.  Some other favorites were the ravioli doppio, and the fish tail carbonara. Both pasta dishes were very tasty and very well prepared. I especially recommend the ravioli.  For our last dish we ordered off the ""large"" plate menu and we selected the fjord trout served with creamed nettles and sunflower seed risotto. The trout itself was amazing. Our waiter informed us that the fish was sushi grade and the chef recommended that it be cooked medium rare. We accepted the suggestion and the fish was cooked perfectly. The skin was so crispy and just the right amount of salty. My only possible complaint (and it's so small) was with the creamed nettles just weren't very good and were also a little cold. Other minor issue was that although this was labeled as a large plate, it was not actually much larger than the small plates but it was twice as expensive.  We ended the dinner with the chocolate pot de crème with pistachio cookies, which was a great little dessert especially when you dipped the cookies in the chocolate.  Overall a great dining experience and not too expensive. We got all of that plus two cocktails (which were great) and one beer for around $150 (before tip).

Our server was impossible to understand and the 10 substitutions (due to out of stock ingredients) was confusing. Food menu was small & easy to choose from. We started with the fennel salad which was bland & octopus which was very tasty but over salted. For our main course we tried the infamous Korean style short ribs. Yes they melted in your mouth but again super salted almost to the point that one bite left a sting on my tongue. The trout dish was no different. I'm a smoker so, if it tastes too salty .... It must be overboard. Gosh, I wish this was as good as the reviews but I simply cannot agree.",0.9237,0.819,0.131,0.05,0.4763784461152882

Service was very good. Personable, friendly. They have a pretty good drink menu and had a few notable whisky options.  Food was good and tasty. Portion sizes were good. We had a meat dish w a bone marrow - both food and savory. Though while this bone marrow was definitely larger, the one I had at Longman and Eagles was more memorable. Oak and Char is closer though.  Parking is metered streets mostly at $4/hour with lots nearby. Parking north of Chicago Ave and west of Orleans is mostly free, but that'll be at least 3+ block walk away. I liked this place.

Need tartare was a little bland but like the salt & pepper chips that came with it. Frankly I think the beef tartare at Sienna Tavern is better.   Ramp & potato salad didn't have many ramps in it and the ones that were there were the size of green onions.  My biggest complaint was on the service. Manly because it was SUPER slow. Took 10 minutes for server to come over and say hi.  Another 10 minutes before he was back to take drink order. Almost 20 minutes before we got drinks.  If you don't have all night to kill on dinner you might consider somewhere else.,0.8837,0.782,0.144,0.074,0.4923076923076924

Menu: changes very often, depending on season, availability and customer feedback.

Similarly, I'd 4ever thought I could love getting the tandoori octopus with eggplant however it's now offered with in-season rancho gordo beans.  Today, I was in for lunch (L&D menus differ) and I had ""The Cuban"" which was tasty however I did encounter more fat in the prosciutto cotto than I'd have liked as it wasn't edible. Overall, I'd have loved more pork in the sandwich as well. The sandwich was good but unlikely I'd order it again. They did a wonderful salad instead of chips which pleased me so I could enjoy an order of the beef fat onion rings.  Lunch, coffee & cocktails or dinner - I've enjoyed all three. Good for a group or a nice bite on your own...I especially enjoy lunch and then lingering with a coffee and free wi-fi. Five stars for service and atmosphere and 3.5-4 for the food.

We loved the presentation, service (both attentive and helpful in terms of guidance), and the ambiance was very appropriate for larger groups (a social scene). Nearly every item ordered was a hit with our group. Appetizers: Beef fat onion rings (delicious, salty, crunchy), MSG Wings (a must have, the right amount of sweet and savory). Main: smoke-roasted chicken (the smokiness is incredible and the egg is a true flavor enhancer), Korean braised beef short rib (texture is perfect), and the best item of the night: 32oz bone in ribeye with bone marrow (this was a true treat and the presentation was amazing - on a chef's board with a cow pourer for the sauce perigueux).

Onto the food...there were some hits and some misses.  They had a special pastrami dish that was underwhelming.  The burrata was actually very good.  It is burrata but over some green salsa (not spicy but tasty) that you mix together and the burrata sort of melts into the salsa.  Excellent idea.  We also tried the wings, which were decent.  The ramps were disappointing.  They aren't like whole ramps that you're used to getting charred, which is what I was hoping for.  In fact, most of the dish consisted of bland potatoes with small pieces of ramps.  The beef tartare was okay but nothing special.  I was instructed to get the tandoori octopus and that was very good.  We tried the pork collar as well, which was okay.  Overall the food to me was average other than the burrata and the octopus.  I'll definitely try again and hope that some of the creative dishes are as tasty as they are creative.",0.9948,0.776,0.182,0.042,0.5643900226757369

The staff at the host stand was very welcoming and accommodating finding us a spot at the bar. However, once at the bar the service was not as attentive. The restaurant has a romantic and whimsical feel and manages to have a decent amount of comfortable seating for what seems like a somewhat smaller space. The restaurant was filled with a lot of laughter and conversation. I wouldn't call it loud or disruptive, just lively! My friend and I each had a glass of wine before ordering two small plates. I had a glass of the Bodegas Ercavio tempranillo which I really enjoyed. Lisa had two glasses of the Freakshow Cabernet Sauvignon (good, but nothing special).  While at the bar we ordered two small plates; the ravioli doppio and saffron roman gnocchi. The gnocchi was good; the flavors were earthy and clean. The ravioli was probably my favorite. They were light and the truffle fondue was amazing. You know the moment you're splitting food with someone and there is one bite left and you always offer the last bite to the other person? Not here, that last bite of ravioli was mine! The reason for the three stars really came down to portions vs. price; $16 for each small plate which were on the smaller than small side and my annoyance for being charged $2 for frozen water. I ordered a glass of bourbon (Basil Hayden $12, a personal favorite). I am someone who feels a splash of water or a rock nicely opens the flavor. However, here you need to pay an extra $2 to enjoy the flavor of your bourbon. Even though it was only $2 for a large piece of frozen water it was disheartening.

2015-03-01,5.0,"I really like this place. I'm vegetarian and I chose here for two reasons, 1, they had food I could actually eat that wasn't just salad and 2, the romantic lighting. It's actually really dark, that's why I chose it ;). I didn't think it appropriate to take pictures because a flash would've looked light lightening in the night sky in this place.  Ok so the food, I had the:  --charred burrata, eggplant muhammara, naan Lol the only thing here I understood was eggplant so I didn't actually know what I was getting, I just knew it was vegetarian *with cheese*. It was like an eggplant and cheese dip/spread and pita bread. The spread was really good, I was surprised. I'd give it a 9 easily. Not to jump around, but I was asking the waiter about the items and he stressed that the majority of the items were small snack like items and there's only 6 actual entrees *none of which are vegetarian*. So snack.. I'm thinking it's like a little small bite of food. I WAS STUFFED from eating just the eggplant, like seriously ""oh my Yoda we just got here and I can't eat anything else"" stuffed and I hadn't eaten anything really all day. I had two PIECES of pineapple at school that morning and a small cup of coffee. So, you can easily be satisfied from the ""small snack"" items. As a matter of fact, lets say they give you 8 pieces of the pita *I didn't  count* I could only eat like 4, I gave 2 to my fiancé and took the other 2 home because it was so good I didn't want to waste it. I planned on trying two things, so the second item I ordered was the:  --crispy broccoli, white anchovy *made with cauliflower for me*, parsnip aioli, calabrian chili  This was good too, except vinegar seemed to collect in the middle of the plate and I hate strong vinegar-y tastes so I avoided that middle section like the plague. I honestly could only eat like two pieces of this, one piece of broccoli and one piece of cauliflower *subbed for the anchovy*. I was so stuffed, but I just wanted to try it *being a food lightweight is so lame*. Given that I was stuffed, and it still tasted good, it had to have been really good lol.  My fiancé had the: --msg chicken wings (maple+sherry+gochujang chili) I asked him what would he rate it, and he gave it a 6 out of 10 so I'm not sure it's as delicious as what everyone claims. I mean really, with chicken wings, the money is in the sauce.. I had the waiter bring me a side of the sauce because I wanted to see what it tasted like given I've never had Korean gochujang and I heard it was really spicy. The sauce wasn't spicy at all :( it was sweet. It kind of had a sweet oaky flavor..with like a low sodium soy sauce taste. I give the sauce a 6 too and the sauce makes the wings... so I trust his rating.  He also had the: --apple pomegranate salad, pumpernickel, aged cheddar, walnuts Now this WAS actually small lol. I tried a bite of his, it was good. Flavors were well rounded. It was the perfect little salad. I'd give this salad a 10.  We both could only just barely eat our food so there were two more items we have to go back and try.  The drinks. In my opinion, it is uncouth to get sloppy drunk at a restaurant like this... but I had no idea... We both had the: --Alicia - Sipsmith Sloe Gin, Grapefruit, Lemon, Simple, Bitters, Soda  and --Mandy - Laird's Bonded Applejack, House-Made Grenadine, Lime That second drink was my fault. The Alicia didn't seem to have any alcohol in it and I was like ""man what is this?! I need something stronger!"" Completely ignoring that drunkard look in my fiancé's eyes... He only ordered the second drink because he didn't want me to one up him. By the time we finished the Mandy...good lord... I don't think I've ever been that drunk in my life. No, I'm sure I've never been that drunk in my life. I couldn't even walk. I don't think of myself as someone that has like a low tolerance or anything so I was really surprised. Overall, we had a nice time. I really like this place and we'll be coming back soon for the ravioli and the smoked chicken. I'd like to add, the couple next to us had this really cool fish thing! It looked so awesome I wanted to sneak and take a picture of it. It looked like if you grabbed a fish out of the ocean and deep fried it on the spot. It was the fjord trout. I don't know how it tasted, but it looked super cool. They ate it really fast, not to be nosy, but they had like 6 other plates before that so given that they ate it in less than 10 minutes I'm guessing it was tasty.",0.999,0.751,0.184,0.065,0.55718075619761

Ah, we got the Burrata.  One of my favorites to get at restaurants and this one did not disappoint!  It came in a little jar with some sort of jelly, so good!

For food it was somewhat slim pickin's for me.  The only fish option that night was trout.  I usually don't go for lake fish so I didn't try it.   So to share we had the burrata which was lovely.  It has a nice smokey flavor and the puffy warm bread is very nice with it.  My friends got the wings which I don't eat.  They cleaned their plates so I assume they were a hit.The #1 hit of the night was the broccoli.  It was like a very light tempura with this lovely mayo like sauce and fried anchovies.  We could have ordered three more rounds of that!  Since I was missing a few dishes I got the apple pomegranate salad which was great.  Very well balanced and not too much of anything.  The cold smoked oysters were great.  I wasn't expecting them to be in a Mason jar.  I've never not slurped them so it was weird putting it on a cracker.  The butter with lemon was an excellent touch. We also shared the ravioli which was delicious as well.  Everything is very nicely balanced.  My friends got the pork collar and they licked that plate clean.   Dessert was disappointing for me.  I should have fought harder for the cheese plate.  As it was I didn't have anything but my friends got two of the dishes.  The doughnuts and the pot de creme.   I would come back only because what I did have was well made.  I would avoid this place because there's not a lot that I'd eat.  Midwest food doesn't have to be so dang meaty!  IMO there is no need to put meat on a doughnut.  This Iowan prefers to cover things in either cheese or chocolate :-)",0.9991,0.697,0.261,0.042,0.621947895100069

The atmosphere of the restaurant was trendy and similar to what you find in river north. We started with the shishito peppers, which were bland but the sauce that accompanied it was delicious. The charred burrata wasn't impressive and the homemade naan was too thick and hard. But the chicken wings were amazing! I would definitely come back for the wings alone. Then we shared the ravioli, which were really flavorful, and the crispy broccoli, which was glorified veggie tempura. Finally we shared the half smoked chicken. The chicken was salty but the skin was crispy. My husband loved it. The side of potatoes flavors were a little overwhelming but overall good.  The hostess mentioned my birthday when we arrived. As most restaurants present a complementary dessert, nothing was offered. I do think when customers choose to celebrate a special occasion, it's the restaurants job to make the customer feel special.

It came with chips, and I think it took away the beef flavor instead of complementing it. That said, this was the last dish we had and we were pretty stuffed, so it might not do it justice.

2015-01-15,1.0,"I visited Oak + Char last month for dinner and drinks with some friends. I ultimately selected Oak + Char, because we wanted to go somewhere new and a little different, and because either their website or another Yelp review indicated that they were knowledgeable and accommodating with allergies.  They were NOT knowledgeable about allergies, and only somewhat accommodating. I have Celiac Disease, commonly known as a gluten allergy. If I have even trace amounts of gluten (which usually occurs when non-gluten items are cooked in the same fryer or other cooker as items that contain gluten, such as breaded foods), I will get violently ill. My friends and I were extremely clear regarding my condition from the moment we were seated, and the server acted very accommodating at first stating that they had plenty of options available and they would take special care to ensure that I did not have any items with gluten. I asked him to point me to menu items that do NOT contain gluten, and he said since most can be modified that I should just let him know what I wanted. After we all discussed what small and large plates we wanted to share, which took a while, our server returned. Despite what he previously stated, we learned that nearly all of our selections contained gluten. More importantly, he was very confused as to gluten was and whether the items did in fact have gluten. After finally putting in our orders for several small and large plates to share, he returned some time later and stated that he was not sure if one of the items had gluten. We asked to speak with a chef, and instead a manager came to speak with us. The manager was very knowledgeable about gluten and had a clear understanding of what items to stay away from. Unfortunately, most of the plates we ordered did in fact contain gluten- apparently Oak + Char uses soy sauce in a ridiculous number of their dishes. Soy sauce contains gluten, and the server did not alert us that most of the dishes we ordered had soy sauce as an ingredient. Thankfully, I had not eaten anything yet and so did not get sick. While the the manager was attentive and helpful, our table was extremely disappointed that (1) our server never apologized until he brought the bill and was forced to face us; and (2) the manager comped $17 worth of food on a $200+ bill. Had we had a competent server, we would have left and had dinner elsewhere because there were so few options for me. Instead, we were stuck with a huge bill and I ate very little.   The food I did eat was fine, it did not wow me. But the service was slow from beginning to end, and extremely disappointing.

I like the atmosphere despite the strange light fixture covers, and the service has been pretty good on each occasion along with good food & drink.  I hope they stick around, this is a nice new resident in the old Graham Elliott space.",0.9785,0.637,0.28,0.083,0.5964891774891774
2015-01-04,5.0,"As someone who keeps up with the restaurant scene in Chicago, I was kind of curious to see what it was like. I had heard it was ""Modern Midwestern"" and not being a huge fan of most American food, I still came here having read many strong reviews. The decor is pretty nice - dark and nice with some cool re purposed things in here. Our server (I forgot her name) was really good. Fun, knowledgeable and passionate. I'd say throughout the experience we had strong service. Now onto the food. It was described as modern midwestern, but with a global flare to it. I can go with that. A lot of the plates here are the more small to medium sized shareable family style/tapas type. We had the shishitos, Burrata, MSG Chicken Wings, tandoori octopus, beef tartare, ravioli, 32 oz bone in ribeye, and some cider donuts. Everything was good here - not a bad spot at all. I think we all agree that the octopus was the weakest dish, but it was still pretty good. The burrata was awesome (though the naan could use a little work) as was the ribeye. I really liked the sauce on the chicken wings and how they were cooked. The beef tartare was really good and it made a believer out of someone who was always afraid to try it. Ravioli? Very good. We really loved the rib eye as it was very good and the bone marrow was delicious (as bone marrow usually is). The cider donuts were really good too - the sauce that had foie gras in it definitely made it (no it doesn't taste like foie). Rich and maple syrup taken to another level for sure. Although I can usually eat a lot, I came out of the meal very content. Not too full and not too hungry - just right. I didn't have anything to drink besides water, but there seemed to be a sizable wine list and the cocktails looked good. Someone in my group described her cocktail as strong and good. To me, I didn't feel like I was eating exactly midwestern fare. There are some things on there like the ribeye that you could attribute to people in the midwest eating, but it definitely has another lean to it. Or maybe I don't know what true Midwestern eating is. Regardless, I have to say I was surprised. I went in thinking it would be a good meal, but it still exceeded my expectations. Strong restaurant and I'll be back for sure in the future.",0.999,0.719,0.26,0.021,0.6245349484823169
2015-01-04,4.0,"Went here on a Saturday night. We ordered 3 snack plates, and two small plates as well as two cocktails. The bartender made me a great cocktail off menu. We ordered the spring rolls, burrat and the MSG Chicken wings. The wings were honestly some of the best that i have ever had -- sweet but great flavor. They were so good that we ordered a second order. Our server, Leah, was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu. We also had the crispy broccoli which was extremely on point. Only reason this place wasn't 5 stars is b/c other than the wings, nothing was knock-your-socks-off good, but overall it was a very solid meal for a new restaurant.",0.987,0.749,0.251,0.0,0.5799732620320855

But apparently I wasn't paying attention when my husband and I took our in-laws to Oak + Char. We thought they'd been open a few weeks, turns out we actually were there on the first night! And they absolutely blew us away. The most unique thing about Oak + Char is their big big big plates - either a prime rib or a whole foie gras to share. We were apparently the first people to ever order the whole foie gras, and let me tell you it was amazing! If we could have licked the board it was on, we would have. In addition to that, some of the highlights of the meal were the ravioli and the apple cider they served on a cold fall evening. Recently, we joined them again for a seven course meal with wine pairings on New Year's Eve and were once again blown away by Chef Joe Heppe's talent. The food was tasty, but also thoughtful and told a beautiful story. The pairings were excellent, and really innovative to pair not just wine, but spirits and beer in some cases as well. Tyler Mendoza and his father, the owners, are the sweetest people. They made us feel incredibly welcome and like they're a great part of the neighborhood!

We ordered the msg chicken, buratta, octopus, beef tartare, and ravioli.  The octopus and ravioli were decent, but the beef tartare was the worst I've ever had.  It was so terribly oversalted, we couldn't finish the dish.  Overall, a pass for me.",-0.6899,0.768,0.1,0.132,0.6325555555555556
2014-12-27,3.0,"I dined here the other night with a friend. I think the ambiance and service were both great. The waitress explained the menu in detail, was attentive and tried to assist to the best of her ability with the below: The reason I give 3 stars is because everything we ordered (while all good flavor alone) came drenched in a bed of sauce that wasn't necessarily described that way (or at all) on the menu. The broccoli was great-but was soaked in a bed of white aioli. The wings were great-but drenched in some sort of white yogurt sauce so I could only eat one that wasn't full of the sauce. The burger (after being reassured there were no added sauces & asked for pickles on the side) came out with some sort of butter all over the top bun and some sort of horseradish aioli mixture all over the bottom bun as well as pickles inside the burger. The waitress had told us our burger was taking longer because she already had intercepted it and asked them to correct it...the 2nd time it came out the same. It was getting late and my group was getting irritated so I just asked for a new bun. As someone who enjoys eating food without a ton of added/unnecessary sauces, it would be helpful if these were listed with each item in detail or put in a cup on the side so they don't infringe on what someone believes to be ordering.",0.9726,0.867,0.113,0.02,0.4769696969696969

The service was outstanding. Jared, our server, described the dishes in great detail making sure there were no surprises. The rest of the serving team were super attentive (our water glasses were never less than 2/3rds full). Everyone loved their food. The acorn squash salad and apple walnut salad were wonderfully composed with delicate flavors. The BBQ chicken wings had a sweet tangy coating and an impressive lime yogurt dip. We devoured the thick slices of pork shank, absolutely outstanding. The closest comparison would be to imagine the best thick bacon you have ever had. Jared told us the duck served rare would taste like a filet and he was right. I have never had duck prepared in this way. The thick tender pink slices of duck approached the texture of sashimi. Finally, the baked chicken was tender and juicy with savory potatoes.

This was delicious as most burrata's are - though it didn't necessarily need it I wish it had been served with little toasts. But maybe because it was technically a salad it didn't qualify for toasts.  I had the apple upland cress salad. This was great and didn't feel toooo unhealthy :) minus the cheese and the grains. My friend had the roasted acorn squash salad. Which was good, a bit heartier than mine with the squash/goat cheese combo. My third friend had the fancy grilled cheese.

2014-12-11,5.0,"My wife and I came here on my birthday this past weekend.  Not being from Chicago, we had read that this restaurant was opening in the former Graham Elliot space, and was focused on ""Midwestern"" cuisine.  Growing up and living in the Midwest, I knew that we needed to check out Oak + Char during our vacation.  While we arrived off of the L a little early, our table was still ready for us when we walked in.   The first things I noticed when we arrived were the oak leaf door pulls, which I found to be unique, but appropriate, given the name of the restaurant, as well as the lighting inside.  The lights looked like massive bed sheets hanging from the ceiling.  I'm not really sure how to explain it, but I really enjoyed it.  It's nice to see a place do something different with their interior lighting.   We were seated at a two-top by the bar.  I'm not sure how many two-tops are in the main dining area, but our seats seemed a little more like open bar seating, versus having an actual reservation.  I didn't mind the seating at all, just making an observation. Our server did a very nice job and was very knowledgeable about the menu.  We started off the evening with cocktails from the bar, as we knew the bartender used to be at Longman and Eagle, so we knew they would be good.  I had the Dolly with Rye, Campari, Maple, Lemon, Egg White, Cucumber, and Salt.  It was a great take on a whiskey sour.  I thought it was well-balanced, and not too sweet.  My wife had the Jordo with Jim Beam Black, Averna, Tawny Port, and Becherovka.  I had a sip of hers and really enjoyed it as well. Now, on to the food.  Having dined at Girl and the Goat the previous night, I was excited to see that Oak + Char also did small plates, meant for sharing.  Wanting to get a good sample of the menu, we decided to go with four different options: burrata, pork trotter spring rolls, ravioli doppio, and beef tartare.  Our waitress was kind to ask if we wanted the meal coursed out, to which we agreed.  before I get in to each of the dishes, I just want to say the the pace of the meal was outstanding.  I don't feel like we ever waited too long between each course, but we also never felt like we were rushed.  With cocktails, four main courses and dessert, we were there for right about two hours.  I also enjoyed that we also had the option (should we wanted that) for our food to arrive all at once.  I would not suggest that, as everything we had was meant to be savored and enjoyed, so if you are in a rush, head someplace else for the night. Now, let's be honest, I've never met a burrata that I haven't liked.  I mean, seriously, who doesn't love burrata?  I would have to say that the eggplant sauce it came with really matched nicely here, even though I'm not typically a fan of eggplant.  The two of us had no issue finishing off both the burrata itself as well as the sauce.  The spring rolls were delicious as well.  They were crispy on the outside, and cooked to perfection on the inside.  They were the perfect little bites to start the meal.  It's important to note that you should not expect full-sized spring rolls.  The are four bite-sized spring rolls.  It's also important to note that both this and the burrata were under the ""snack"" portion of the menu, which was separate from the ""small plates"" that the rest of our food came from.  We knew what we were getting ourselves in to, but I just wanted to make it clear for anyone reading this. Course number three brings us to the ravioli doppio.  I really enjoyed this a ton!  Each of the five raviolis had two little ""chambers"", which I had never seen before.  One side had a maitaki mushroom filling, and the other side had a celery root filling.  The way this ravioli was set up, you could eat it a couple of different ways.  You could either split the ravioling length wise, which would yield you one ravioli of each filling, or you could split it width-wise, meaning you would be trying both sides of the ravioli in one bite.  I did this both ways, for comparison's sake, and I really enjoyed each one.  The fillings played nicely together and it all really worked well! Course number four was the beef tartare, which I had never experienced before.  I'm not sure what I was expecting, but I honestly never knew that raw beef could taste so delicious!  The uni aioli also was especially delicious.   Finally, we decided to opt for dessert, which was an outstanding choice, if I do say so myself.  We went for the cider doughnuts with this delicious maple foie sauce.  Trust me here folks, it was worth every last bite! I'm so glad we decided to check out Oak + Char!  The place was packed the whole time, so make sure you get a reservation before going!  I can't wait to see how they do and am wishing them nothing but success!",0.9994,0.779,0.189,0.031,0.606649687118437
2014-12-10,5.0,"I read about this recently opened restaurant on Eater Chicago, and decided it would be a great spot to try out for my husband's birthday dinner on a weekend visit to Chicago. I'm very happy we did, because it turned out to be one of the highlights of a weekend filled with plenty of other food and drink. We were greeted in the entryway by two very friendly hosts who took our coats and took us to our table, even though we were a bit early for our reservation. Although reactions seem to be mixed, I myself really enjoyed the decor and in particular the pillowy lighting. In a world where Edison bulbs abound, it was nice to see something different.  Oak + Char recently got their liquor license and there is no shortage of options in any category, but we decided to go with the Jordo (Jim Beam Black, Averna, Tawny Port, Becherovka) and Dolly (Rittenhouse Rye, Campari, Maple, Lemon, Egg White, Cucumber, Salt) cocktails. Both were complex, nicely balanced cocktails that we enjoyed throughout our meal.  The menu is set up in several sections - snacks, small plates, large plates, and chef's boards. After reading other reviews where parties seemed to order several plates to share across the categories, we decided to do the same, ordering 4 dishes total. Our waitress asked if she could course them out for us, which we really enjoyed as it elongated the meal and allowed us to taste them in the order that made most sense. From the snacks, we ordered the burrata and the pork spring rolls, both of which were very nice small plates to start the meal. It's hard to mess up burrata, but we really enjoyed the eggplant sauce it was paired with, and also liked the crispy texture of the spring rolls and the tahini sauce they were paired with.  From the small plates, we ordered the ravioli doppio, which had a celery root puree filling on one side and a maitake mushroom filling on the other side. Impressive technique, a unique approach to ravioli, and both sides were delicious! We also ordered the beef tartare from the small plates - having never had tartare before, we were a little hesitant, but this actually ended up being my favorite dish. The dish was extremely fresh and I loved the flavor from the accompanying uni aioli, mustard seed, pine nuts, and pickled pears. I felt that the 4 dishes between the two of us were filling but not overwhelming. Next time we go, I'd love to order a chef's board, as we saw a few come out that looked wonderful. For dessert, I highly recommend the cider doughnuts with the maple foie syrup. Again, was a little hesitant going in, but we loved the sweet-savory combo that this dessert delivered. Very happy we were able to try this new spot during our visit, and hoping it succeeds so that we can head back there again next time!",0.9984,0.791,0.182,0.027,0.5272663830422452

I was surprised with how tasty and well-priced the lunch menu was.  The cauliflower bisque was one of the best soups I had ever tasted...the golden raisin toast that adds a lot to flavor and gives it a lot of substance.  The sandwiches are filling and are simple but extremely flavorful and come with the most amazing side of house chips - these chips have a smoky BBQ seasoning that was very different than the typical side of french fries or regular potato house chips that other restaurants serve at lunch. Overall I highly recommend Oak+Char for anyone looking for a quick drink or a quiet, neighborhood experience with top quality food which is not trying to be overly trendy but just good and satisfying.",0.9922,0.823,0.177,0.0,0.584769536019536

We (two top) placed the entirety of the order, minus dessert within 15 minutes of being seated. The server promised to course it out, okay, coursing is generally a good thing. 2 hours and 15 minutes for 4 dishes. 25 - 30 minutes between each course. Not one mention about the kitchen being slow or an apology for the delay. Is this standard? Between each course we kept wondering, 'is the kitchen ok?' 'why does nobody around us have food either?' Now on to the positives, the food: octopus and pork collar were executed perfectly. Excellent pairings too.  Wasn't the biggest fan of the squash as it was served cold.

We both literally spit it out in a napkin, and politely asked our waiter to return it to the chef and tell him it was inedible.  We ordered another delicious entree of trout, though. He came back with the bill after about another 30 minute wait, and the pork belly was still on there.  He said, we'll buy you the first round of drinks instead...so they saved $7?  Really?  Sorry, I grew up in the restaurant business and know how to handle simple complaints like this.  You don't throw the customer a drink.  You simply remove the item from the menu, apologize and have your customer feeling good about the experience.  ESPECIALLY when they ordered another entree in which they were very pleased.  Great wine though, but I'd get rid of the waiter for sure and even the management if it was his or her call on how to deal with a bad dish.  Good luck, I hope you survive.  It's a charming place for sure.",0.9781,0.793,0.16,0.047,0.6394902440554614

2014-11-30,3.0,"Was it our server?  The night we were here?  What we ordered?  Not sure but based on the reviews on Yelp I thought we were in for a real treat at this newest addition to River North. But what we got was a hodge podge of experiences some good (most of the food) and some not so good (like the spotty service and being told they were out of things) So let's start with the positives.  The space is lovely.  We all commented on how interesting it was with the billowy light fixtures contrasting with the rough hewn wood that is all through this place.  We opted to sit at the high tops that were a little closer to the bar as we were looking for a little energy that even on a Friday night this place seemed to be lacking. Given we had a sizeable group, we had a chance to try a range of the food.  The winners seemed to be the apple pomegranate salad, the crispy broccoli, the pecorino arancini, and the grilled octopus.  The losers were the double cheeseburger (tasted like a white castle burger stewed in onions with a cheese whiz type sauce) and the acorn squash (felt like it should have been warm).   Now I understand that this place is meant for shareable plates, but the plates came out so randomly for our group that we didn't know what was what.  We ordered two orders of the salad and the octopus and one order came up at a time.  So some of the table was eating and the others were not   Maybe this concept only works if you are sharing food?  And our table wanted their own due to some dietary restrictions.  And because they use food runners instead of the server bringing the food, it just got tossed on the table.   And another pet peeve of mine is that if an order comes with 4 things and there are 5 people at the table, throw in a 5th!  We ordered the cider donuts to share at the end, asked how many were in the order, were told 4-5 and then 4 came out.  Sheesh!  Seems to be that they are suffering from some of what I call ""new restaurant blues"". Another symptom of that is when we went to order the wine.  The bottle of wine, that the server recommended, they were out of.  As was our second choice.  So we ended up going with wines by the glass.  Know if you go that route that wines by the glass are served in stemless glassware.  If you want a decent glass you need to order the bottle.  When one in our group asked for a stemmed glass (we saw them at the next table), we were told there were ""none clean right now"".  And we ended up sending back one glass of wine as it was about a 3 oz pour.  They immediately rectified it but it was just one more hiccup in our evening. All in all, we walked away a little puzzled as to what this place was trying to be.  We loved the space.  Most of the food, had it come up more systematically was pretty good.  But there was just something off on the night we were there. Maybe I'll give it another go in a few months to see if they have worked the kinks out.  And that's more generous than the group I brought who basically shook their heads surprised that I had suggested this place to begin with.",0.9966,0.852,0.125,0.023,0.5055477709425079

2014-11-22,5.0,My wife and I came here to treat our good friends to a celebratory dinner for their recent engagement. The wifey discovered the new restaurant on a food blog.  We started off with the pork trotter spring rolls and ravioli doppio which were both absolutely delicious. The spring rolls were perfectly crispy and the ravioli was al dente. This was followed by msg wings which was bomb bomb and reminded me of Bon Bon chicken in nyc. So yummy. This was followed by cold smoked oysters which my preggo wife appreciated since she cannot have raw oysters until the baby arrives. Beef tartare was great and uniquely served with chips. The only miss of the night was the octopus that felt burnt and may have been cooked from frozen. The highlight of the meal was the goat strozzapreti which was out of this world fresh. We ended the meal with the lamb sweetbreads which we pleasantly discovered came with black pudding that we have missed from when we lived in London. The beer and drinks menu was great. The restaurant when we arrived was not overly crowded and the beginning of our meal we almost felt like the service was too attentive but that happens at restaurants with great service that are not yet full for the evening. When we left the restaurant was much busier.,0.9753,0.828,0.143,0.029,0.6483849483849484
2014-11-22,5.0,"We invited our friends here to celebrate their engagement and the four of us left this restaurant raving about the restaurant. The ambience was great and I loved the decor of this place with its exposed brick and puffy fabric light fixtures.  The service was very attentive and we especially like how they kept a jug of water on the table. Our server described the cuisine as Midwestern dishes with a global twist that supports local farmers.  Between the four of us, we shared the following: - Pork Trotter spring rolls- delicious and crispy - MSG wings- perfectly cooked. Crispy, sweet and savory - Tandoori octopus- the only dish that we felt wasn't as good as the other. We couldn't figure out if the octopus was overcooked or not that fresh - Beef Tartare- I couldn't eat this but the table enjoyed it. Love the potato crisps it came with though and they used it to scoop the tartare - Cold smoked oysters- yum! I loved the consistency and flavors of the oysters as well as the cracker and creamy butter - Goat strozzapreti- the pasta was cooked to perfection. Very al dente and the sauce was good.  - Ravioli Doppio- probably one of the best ravioli I've ever had. One of our friends said that if we had to order another dish, he'd order this one again. -Lamb Sweetbreads- excellent and we all loved that it came with blood sausage. Beautiful presentation and great flavors So the two appetizers and six small dishes were the perfect quantity for the four of us. We each enjoyed two drinks each (hooray for their liquor license!).",0.998,0.704,0.273,0.023,0.6475000000000001

2014-11-15,4.0,"I came here on a Friday night with my date and we enjoyed our experience. The restaurant just opened about two weeks ago, and they're still working on their liquor license, so it was BYOB. Service and ambiance each deserve 5 stars, food maybe 3-4 stars. For starters we had the buratta, chicken wings, spring rolls. All of them were really tasty! The chicken wings were very sweet, though had great flavor. The buratta was served with eggplant puree and naan, which was a unique preparation that I have not seen before. We also ordered the octopus and the cheeseburger, which were good, but nothing special. The dessert menu looked really good, but we were too full. The service was spectacular! Our waiter was funny and attentive, and the hostess was also cheerful. The interior of the restaurant is beautiful with dark wood cloud-like lighting fixtures. I'm excited to come back once the bar is up and running, as we hear the mixologist is formerly from Longman + Eagle which has great drinks.
