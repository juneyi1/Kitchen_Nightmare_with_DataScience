Went once with friends before and then I suggested my date this place who was visiting me from out of town who likes Middle Eastern food like me.... Loved their lunch buffet.. Great choices of soups, salads, veggie and meat options... Their chicken, kabobs and falafels were so flavorful and their big huge pita kind of bread they brought to the table is very tasty with which you can make your own pita wraps.. Their chicken biryani, spicy veggie rice and dill rice were nice as well with right amount of flavor... I was too full to try their desserts and skipped them but I was told they were good as well... Service was amazing and I was pleasantly surprised to be greeted and welcomed by my name when I walked in as my date who entered the restaurant few mins before me had asked the guy to direct me to his table. My date loved the food as well... They also have free parking validated for 2hrs which I didn't know the first time I visited with friends.. This place is less than 2miles from where I live so I know I will be frequently visiting from now on... Can't wait to take my family next time...",0.9923,0.77,0.213,0.018,0.5895238095238096

I'm not confused, but what is confusing is why you guys have that policy. Either way, we are paying for the food that is being eaten, how it is being served should not be limited to one or the other especially on the weekend when you have the buffet special ALL DAY!

I ordered the chicken Kabob, ground lamb and dill rice.  The chicken Kabobs are very tender and seasoned very good.  The ground lamb was excellent and formed into a sausage.  My wife ordered the same as me except she ordered the lamb Kabobs instead of the ground lamb.  The Kabobs were very good, but we both preferred the ground lamb.   It's been quite a few years since we ate at Reza's.  The food is always very good, but there are so many more options for Mediteranean food today.  Reza's always produces high quality food, but I feel there are more Mediteranean restaurants today that produce and equal or better quality food and aren't as pricey.  Reza's is still produces a great meal & has 2 other locations.  One at Presidential towers west of the loop & one in Oakbrook right down the street from my office just off of Butterfield Road.",0.9722,0.918,0.082,0.0,0.515787771898883

The stuffed green pepper (for added price) was stuffed with mushrooms and a bland tomato sauce, no cheese or other ingredient. The eggplant steak was reheated, fried tiny eggplant slices and croutons in the same, cold tomato sauce. The tabouleh was ok. The bread they brought was good. The service was awful. Our waiter took our order, brought it and left before we could say anything. We really never saw him again. After more than 10-15 minutes of looking for him to resurface, I asked a waitress for hot sauce to try and save the meal - she looked at me like I was rude to interrupt her as she waited on her table, and ignored my request. I finally asked a bus boy for some hot sauce and the owner or manager saw me and actually brought it. Then after another 10 minutes, I had to ask a bus boy to refill our water glasses, which had been empty most of the meal.

It seems to be an attempt to appear more crowded to passersby but it makes for an unappetizing experience...the room is too brightly lit, is noisy due to large refrigerators in room, and serves as their staff break room.

Obviously, I adored the food (and I'm looking forward to my leftovers tomorrow), and I felt super comfortable in the restaurant intself.  It's a large and open space with and artistic, but classy appeal.  Everything was ideal with the exception of the service.  When my partner, Brian G. and I aren't yelping, we're counselors and so we have agreed that the service would be diagnosed as Bipolar I, Severe with Mixed Features.  It was that bad.   When finding out that we were going to split the food and opted out of buying alcohol, she became quite the snippy one.  She just about snatched the menu out my hands before we were done ordering.  There were also plenty of times that we'd be talking to her or asking questions and she'd simply start walking away...is that what they learn in customer service school nowadays?  But then, there were times throughout the meal that she'd be more responsive and aggreeable.  However, what is consistent was her lack of attentiveness and promptness.  It's a shame that the service was so poor as Reza's could have been a five star review otherwise.   If I were to ignore this blotch by the service, I'd say that Reza's is a shining star there in Andersonville.",0.9968,0.796,0.148,0.056,0.5502857142857142

The buffet is $17.99 per person, which doesn't seem bad in comparison to the a la carte entree prices on the menu, but we opted to order right from the menu for several reasons: The appetizers/entrees we were most interested in were not available in the buffet, and we were also turned off by the signs proclaiming a $9.95/lb charge for any food left on the plate. I totally understand combating food waste whether you run a business or not, but I was certainly not going to pay twice for food I would have been settling for in the first place.   We ordered the quail appetizer, which was seasoned and cooked well, falafel, which were good but not my favorite, and the steak and lamb kabob combo, which came with bread, a small salad with cheese, tomato lentil soup - yum!, and a side - we had grilled potatoes. Everything came out quickly and tasted great, though some of the meat was a little chewier/fattier than I usually prefer.

Here are some reasons: I have been there three times and service was awful every single time and was hoping for improvement, alas they don't care about their customers.  Last night, the server sat us down in the little porch they have, and it took him 20 minutes to come take our drinks order. It was a slow day and there were lots of servers there, and we were assigned the sloppiest server I have ever seen! The martini he brought for us barely had alcohol in it! I would blame whoever made that drink,  him or the bar tender! Then he brought us the entrees. We wanted white rice and he got us dill rice! the table was very small and he didn't make any efforts to open some room for our entrees after we were done with our appetizers, so we had to put some plates on the table next to us. The worst part of this experience is I left my credit card inside the checkbook. When I called  them back this morning they denied that the credit card was left there as they couldn't find it. However, the server got some coffee with my credit card this morning. I always wanted to not believe those who talk low of this restaurant, but now I'm 100% convinced that they were right!  If you want good food, good service, good ambiance, and also better prices, there is Kabobi, Noon o Kabab, and Masouleh.

Food: Consistently good... the lentil soup is amazing, falafel is good, dill rice could be consumed until no more existed, and they have a non-dairy almond milk rice pudding that's pretty good. The service rates zero stars. Others have commented on this: I went with a friend for lunch today and there was a strong push from the scowling, un-welcoming waitress to order the buffet, even though I pointed out that the veggie combo from the menu would be cheaper-- she said ""Well it's only $3 cheaper."" My friend arrived a few minutes later and asked to see a menu-- she again pushed the buffet, and then said ""If one of you orders from the menu, you both have to; and if one of you orders the buffet you both have to."" What?? If I wasn't craving their food (and hadn't already ordered a drink) I would have left.  As others have mentioned (but I didn't believe), the buffet does have a rudely-worded and accusatory sign that says something like ""In order to keep prices low, eat what you take. Food left on your plate un-eaten will be charged at $9.95 a pound."" So they're actually going to weigh your un-eaten food and charge you for it, I guess. After aggressively pushing the buffet on us and refusing to allow one to order from the menu if the other ordered from the buffet, the unhappy waitress disappeared for twenty minute stretches. We saw her twice during the entire experience; both times to deliver bad news: Once to admonish us over looking at the menu, and the second to present the bill. The only good thing: The tip wasn't already built in, allowing the option to select an appropriate amount. I really hope Reza's considers some customer service enhancements to compliment their food.

First off the food is good, not great (hummus from a bucket?), the servers are always a pleasure to deal with.  However, they have raised the price on the buffet twice in the last year or so. In fact, they do not even post the price on the sign outside like they used to. When they raised it to $13.95, it was not a problem because the price included a soft drink or tea. Now they don't include the drink but don't bother to tell you either so that essentially raises the price to about $18.00 with a ""suggestion"" for an 18% tip. So essentually I paid over $20 for the same lunch that only cost me about $14 with tip about a year ago.

I worked at two different locations; and I have to say that both establishments have this issue. The location in Edgewater had roaches. The cooks work long hours for low pay and have no proper ventilation in the basement where they cook their rice. There would be flies during the hot summer days and the basement would easily reach higher then 100 degrees plus. I felt awful for the cooks who work long hours and got treated by Reza himself as slaves. The man is an asshole, he sold cocaine when he first came to this country and worked his way up driving a cab but his humble beginnings weren't so kosher. I don't appreciate owners who treat their workers like scum just to get rich. Unfortunately, this is true for most places the sad reality is - appalling. The food is hit or miss but their prices are up there. I believe that good food should come with owners that care about their employees and customers not just see customers as a dollar sign. Reza is a business man he owns the Cheetah gym and various real estate his interest is not in the food or customer satisfaction.

Once seated, our server notified us that they have buffet open for $24.99 each. Not interested, we asked for menus, to which he responded that the buffet is available. We asked further why others are having meals delivered to their tables and he responded with attitude that those are special orders and we can look at food in the buffet if we want. After a while of hesitation and confusion, we decided to go with the buffet - server brought us waters and drinks we ordered and left forever. Food in the buffet was decent, but not worth $25 even with the selection they had available. Warning signs of a $10/lb charge for served, but uneaten food were abundant. As more people kept coming in, all got the option of buffet style or menu. Finally, when it was time to pay, I asked for the manager to give me more details as to why we were forced to have the buffet. He responded that during rush hour (which is not defined by specific time) they only offer buffet to their customers as their servers are busy with those customers already seated (read: servers do not have time to serve you, and so you are stuck with a $25 buffet and no service). He further couldn't explain why others seated at the same time as us were being offered menus - supposedly a decision of the owner in the kitchen.

One of the things I learned here is that Arabic Arak is NOT the same thing or even related to South Asian Arrack.  That may not be very important to you, but if you come here with a Sri Lankan you might want to point this out to him. Since those days there's been a proliferation of Middle Eastern restaurants all over town, and it says something that this place is still here, with the same basic menu, in the same location, and it's still pretty crowded weekend evenings.  Trendier more expensive places have come and gone, some right next door.  I returned recently to meet with some old friends, who also encountered Persian food for the first time here.  The consensus this time was that although it's all still good, it's not as exciting as it once was as we've had better elsewhere.  But I'm willing to bet that this place will still be around long after the other places, even those with better food, have shuttered.  I think it's because Reza's became a stalwart local food institution somewhere along the line.  Service is good, the very solid menu remains the same , I do recommend the salmon kebabs, and parking is virtually impossible.",0.9878,0.798,0.165,0.037,0.4204489795918368

We came in around 12:00pm and to my surprise the place wasn't as packed, considering how lively Andersonville was during Thanksgiving.  We came in and were immediately seated! Our waitress was very attentive, our glasses were always full and our table was never a mess. The food was definitely on point, as expected! It was my first time here for the holiday and everything was nothing short of perfect! They had a great selection of their typical buffet options in addition to the American Thanksgiving options. I was hoping for falafel but it wasn't out there, ah well. I was the only vegetarian at the table and I was very happy with what they were serving, so many options and not enough room! Everyone at the table had nothing but great reviews over their plates, we had a great time and definitely enjoyed the at home atmosphere. The place wasn't overly crowded, even as the restaurant filled up, there was an order to their buffet and everything was nicely presented. There was a ton of staff around and I'm very thankful for their great service, especially for Thanksgiving! Everyone enjoyed the buffet, averaging between 2-3 plates!

I've never gone to Reza's for anything other than the weekday/weekend brunches, but I'd say they are awesome enough that I don't really care about the rest of the menu. It is a little expensive at around $18-22 for a buffet, but they definitely bring out good quality. I should add: they have a highchair on wheels they can bring out for kids, which is a nice plus. All of the staff love children and kept my little banana highly entertained throughout our meals. I suppose that's a unique plus for us. So, they have this giant buffet. On weekends you can get some champagne with your brunch.   What you get however, is pure deliciousness. Whether you're a vegetarian or not, there are plenty of excellent options here ranging from the fried potatoes/hummus/falafel to excellent and tasty lamb. Oh, and don't skip the desserts, either. All the buffet items are good quality and all Reza's cares about is that you don't order more than you can eat.

On the other hand, the shrimp and scallops were excellent, the huge pan of bread was a masterpiece, and the lentil soup is amazing (although a very stingy portion size....)

I chose the marinated chicken on the bone with dill rice for my dinner.  My husband and I also split an order of tabouleh that was very delish.  I have to give props to my friend and neighbor, though, who makes his special by adding fresh mint to his and that really kicks it off but this was good nevertheless.  My husband chose the combination beef and boneless chicken and he said both were moist and tender, which is the same, 'ole dependable way it always is.

2015-08-11,1.0,"Visited Reza's at Oak Brook on Friday July 31, 2015 at 8:40PM. I have twins who are 2 years old and a four year old daughter. I dropped one of the twins and my 4 year old at the door (no valet available on that night) with my wife and went to park the car. Came back and saw my wife seated in a table but she didn't seem very happy.  I asked her what happened and she told me that, while she was struggling to come through the door with two kids, no one opened the door for her,  nor they greeted her upon entering. They totally ignored her although the manger was standing right in from of the door. When taken her to the table, she suggested a different table then the one she was offered, but responded with a look and sound of frustration by the manager. She requested two high chairs to the manager but that request was ignored.  After I came back from parking the car, she still was not provided with the high chairs. I called a waiter and requested the high chairs again and the water brought two high chairs for us. It seems like the manage totally ignored/forgot the request. At that point I called the manager and expressed our concern that my wife felt she was totally ignored and mistreated upon her arrival. The manager told me that he didn't ignore her and her allegations are baseless. NO APOLOGY from the manager rather complete denial of that fact. When we insisted and said this is not the proper way you do deal with the customer, he raised his voice and said he sees no reason to apologize since he didn't do any wrong. He shouted to one of the waiters and told him to take care of us.  By this time, we lost our appetite and realized that it is not a place for us to have a comfortable dinner. There are tons of other places where I can get both service and food. So I humbly request him to provide me his name so that I can inform higher authority about the incidence and write a detail yelp review. He denied to give me his full name and said his name is ""Din"". After pressing him a bit he told me his name is ""Noor Al Din"". I laughed at his response. Noor Al Din means the light of the religion.  I am surprised and ashamed to get that kind of service and treatment who calls himself Noor Al Din. Anyway, I hope that is his Reza's version of name, not his real name..  In summary, the customer service has went down the drain. And I can see that form other reviews on the Yelp as well. Food alone will not cut it anymore. If they don't provide customer service then we will not go there anymore. We don't live in a barbaric place where someone can trough a plate full of kabob and will throw our money at them. People just don't go to the restaurant for food - they look for the total experience. I think that is what missing form Reza's.",-0.9299,0.843,0.068,0.089,0.485683421516755

As someone who has eaten A LOT of kabob in her life, I know kubideh is never dark pink on the inside. When my mom complained, she had to talk to two servers and they acted as if she should eat it anyway. One server tried to convince me I did not know what medium-well was. Then, we talked to the manager, who was very useless. He did not apologize. He did not say he would talk to the chef. He did nothing.  This experience was absolutely horrible.

Has bar area. Went back downstairs to the main floor private space. Floor to ceiling windows brought Chicago sunshine to light up the space. There is a side entrance on Berwyn Ave. White table cloth.

Booster seats available. Washroom accessible downstairs, with very visible signs. The room was  set to seat 100. Tried to play children party game but had to modify due to space. Best to have sit down games. Staff and owner? very accommodating. Explained buffet setting. Asked if there were plenty of seats. Helped bring in more tables to set up gift and dessert table. Were permitted to bring sweets. There was always a staff member present to assist. Always checking with hosts and guests. Allowed to decorate at 11am. Guests were trickling in due to cramped street parking. Best to tell guests to plan for traffic and parking. Best to wear comfy shows. The private room connected to main dining room has a small slope. So be careful walking in heels or if you need walking assistance. Our guests had no complaints with the layout.

Today my husband and I went to lunch at Reza's. We didn't get the buffet option but instead ordered different meals. We shared some of our meals and both entrees had many of the same ingredients. The food itself was good, if a bit bland. The service was definitely iffy but we were relaxed and not in a rush so it wasn't a big deal. Until... About an hour after, my husband and I began to feel like death. He and I didn't realize that we were both ill until we spoke after dragging ourselves through work. It was immediately clear that after eating at Reza's and parting ways, we'd developed identical symptoms of food poisoning. It's likely there was some sort of cross-contamination at play and I certainly hope that it didn't transfer to the buffet and make other people feel so horrid. I have leftovers in my fridge that are most definitely being tossed out. I can only hope that there will be an internal review of kitchen protocols and standards to ensure that the food is safe to be served.

2014-07-04,4.0,"This is Reza's original location... and when it first opened there was nothing like it in Chicago. Luckily Reza's still offers much of its original charm and purpose. And the menu is almost identical to the one it opened with. Reza's offers essentially traditional Persian fare. It is housed in a massive industrial designed warehouse restaurant with high ceilings, visible piping, and echoing sounds. The waitstaff is polite and helpful, although when ever they mess up an order they will blame the customer (it is a middle eastern thing I think... not to lose face). Reza's is reasonably priced and the portions are big enough to split. The first thing that comes out is a free Iranian condiment plate, with onions, radish, feta cheese, parsley, and olives. After you order you usually get a delicious lentil soup, followed by your extra appetizers or straight to your dinner. I have been to many Persian places since my first introduction to the cuisine at Reza's, and Reza's does not offer all of the common authentic items that I can get elsewhere. But there is an array of dips al la Lebanese feasts, like Hummus and Baba Ganush. So let's go right to the main courses, which are for the most part, some type of kabob served on dill Bastmati rice, accompanied by a side skewer of grilled vegetables.  As far as the kabobs go, there are a lot to choose from: steak, filet, ground spiced beef, chicken, lamb, quail, and seafood. You can also get a combo. There are a few stews too, and daily specials. If you are there on a night when they have stewed lamb shank, get it, it is very good. And I always go home with leftovers of what ever I have ordered. Tea is a good beverage to drink here  but they also offer beer and wine.  For desert they have more tradition Greek and Armenian pastries, like bakalava.  Reza's used to be open very late, but I am not sure that is the case anymore. On weekdays they have a very reasonable buffet lunch.",0.7433,0.906,0.06,0.034,0.4936567460317461

2014-07-02,4.0,"Oh Reza's how I missed you! I missed you so much that you made my list of ""must eat here"" while I was back in my old stomping grounds in Chicago.  I have been dreaming about your dill rice for eight years...literally.  Upon walking in, it was just as I remembered!  Lively and packed full as it should be.  Just a short wait for a table and then the nomming commenced.  I chose the Lentil soup (as per usual) and ordered some hummus because... of course I did.  Excellent depth of flavor in both of my choices thus far.  Reza's serves up some of the richest and smoothest hummus with warm, soft pita perfection!  They still serve the small plate of feta cheese, radishes and greens but the only thing I ate was the feta which of course, was very good.  For my entree I ordered (don't ask me for the real name which starts with a J and I forgot what it's really called...whups) a chicken kabob on the bone along with the long lusted after dill rice and grilled veg.  After ordering, my server uttered those three words that I remembered so well: ""the big one?""  Yes!  I want the big one and I'm going to eat the entire thing too!  Every time I ordered it previously the wait staff would ask that exact question; love it!  The chicken was cooked through and smoky and juicy and totally delicious.  The dill rice was everything I had been dreaming of and the two in combination were absolute heaven in my mouth.  There is so much flavor and heart and soul in this food and you can really taste it.  Beautiful presentation as well which only makes the dining experience that much better.   The only little complaint I had on this fine evening was the service.  When I was being tended to it was fine but there were no drink refills offered and a long wait for the check at the end (at least 20 minutes).  I remembered some words of wisdom to the effect of ""you don't want to start ignoring your customer at the end of the meal.""  I was ready for something sweet after my lovely meal but lost interest while waiting for the server to return.  Thanks again though Reza's for a great feast filled with yummy flavor and good memories!",0.9981,0.745,0.22,0.035,0.5309057971014491

The restaurant is 'Persian' but in reality it's an Americanized catch-all of 'Middle Eastern cuisine.' The decor is ostentatious, and the wait staff is hit-or-miss.  Overall the food is average. It ends up being mostly kabobs, some salads, soups, and 4 authentic dishes.  Kabob dinners are marked up, IMO. $15-20 for a meat of your selection + side + and a soup. Considering the price different is about $3 dollars more to get the Fillet Mignon over the chicken, I'd recommend the steak. And I've always opted for the Dill Rice over White Rice.  Never understood why Reza's is so popular, they do have a buffet -- if you like buffets. But it seems to have established itself as a constant in the neighborhood, and even though I definitely think the neighborhood could do better, I suppose it could be worse.

Very spacious, clean and the overall feel is very homey and has great character. The service is good, nothing to complain about but by no means super impressive. We came here for the lunch buffet(arrived around 3pm), which apparently lasts until around 9PM at dinner time.  The buffet is $19.99 per person, honestly, I would be expecting a lot more for this price tag. There were 2 types of soup, neither were good( barley and tomato lentil), 3 types of rice, plain, dill rice or spicy vegetable, they were average. 2 types of salad, ceasar or Iranian salad, the ceasar salad was quite good but it was probably because it was heavily drenched in dressing, the salad had nothing but lettuce. There were also some chicken, lamb and beef kabob. Only 1 type of fried desert. The falafel were pretty good, moist and good flavors. The best was the cucumber yogurt sauce. Honestly the buffet was not worth $20. I would pay half of the price if I were to come back as a regular. The items were pretty standard and taste was not superb, I go to school in a small town and we have an Indian buffet in town that costs around $12 with food that is much more grand and delicious. Maybe it's the Chicago price tag, but it's still nothing to rave about. Overall, I'd come back for the ambiance but the food is just a OK. P.S.: $9 per lb of any food you cannot finish will be charged, forreal? Never been to a buffet place this direct.

The service was ok, the waitress had trouble remembering our order - e.g, she brought me the lentil soup instead of the chicken. It wasn't atrocious, just it could have been better.  The lamb shank is definitely a steal for only $15, and the portions are a really nice size, I was able to take about half of it home.

Our order arrived much earlier than expected (a plus), and we live close by the restaurant. Our meat was so overlooked that no one would eat it. An appetizer was missing and everything was ice cold, which is perplexing since it was delivered quickly. Grub Hub tried to rectify, unsuccessfully, and reza's refuses to rectify this situation.

2013-10-29,4.0,"Whenever I visit my Aunt, a retired university professor, we usually stop here for dinner. Over the years, we have eaten here about a dozen times or more. We started off with the Dolmeh (which are grape leaves stuffed with rice, tomato, onion, herbs & spices in tomato saffron sauce). We ordered the kabab tabei which was moist, succulent, tender and incredibly delectable. Central to the Persian dishes are numerous rice dishes, some containing almonds, pistachios, dill, glazed carrots or orange peels, and raisins; others with vegetables and spices; occasionally with meat. However, at Reza's there are only two or three kinds of rice. We ordered Dill rice which fell flat in the taste category. Other dishes to try here are:  Stews (which are fairly good), dumplings, kebabs (several different kinds and all are excellent), and stuffed vegetables accompanied by different sauces. Many of the dishes are vegetarian, and the mixing of sweet and savory, such as grains stewed with fruit and spices produces some unique delectable dishes. The result is a feast of outstanding, unique flavors and textures as well as a visual delight. One dish that we tried before, but did not see on the menu this time around, was Fesenjan. I am sure they would fix it for us upon request. Fesenjan is a Persian chicken stew with a sauce made of toasted walnuts and pomegranate molasses. It may sound a bit strange, but trust me, this dish is the perfect amalgamation. The toasted walnuts are rich and warm, while the pomegranate molasses is sharp and berry toned. The juxtaposition of the crunchy walnuts, with the tart sweetness of the pomegranate, and saltiness of the chicken make for an unbelievable explosion of delicate flavors. The end result is spectacular and plate-licking good!  SERVICE is attentive, but not overly smothering. Most of the servers are nearly mute and barely crack a smile. Maybe it's a cultural thing. They do speak English, but others barely get by. I found another excellent Persian restaurant located in the Albany Park neighborhood with fabulicious lunch specials (Noon-O-Kabab), which has excellent Persian food.",0.9953,0.827,0.16,0.013,0.577020202020202

I always get the potatoes, which are served as little planks with some sort of cheese roasted on them. Lovely. One thing I haven't tried is the buffet, but I've heard it's good.  Complaints? Well, if you come by yourself, they usually stick you in the back. And though the servers are always pleasant, they can be a little inattentive. And the flavored iced tea isn't terribly good.

2013-07-23,4.0,"With urban flair, this Middle Eastern restaurant with full bar is nestled in the friendly gayborhood of Chicago, Andersonville. I was here recently for a buffet style large group dinner in an entire wing of the diner rented out for my nephew's baptism luncheon. I must say the lunch buffet was amazing. I have heard that it is roughly $12/pp, and at that price point it's a great deal in this part of Chicago. Now, I am from metro-Detroit where our Mediterranean restaurants outnumber McDonalds locations by a large margin. The food here was definitely up to par. I have had better hummus at many restaurants (for some reason Chicagoland MidEast diners are 0/3 for me so far on hummus quality), however the rest of the food more than made up for it. Lamb kabobs were excellent. The braised lamb shank was so tender and flavorful - many good bone and marrow pieces and enough fatty pieces to really hit the spot. I also saw a Nihari Beef, which was unique and a more South Asian (Indo-Pak) style. So it is nice to see the chefs here explore outside of their comfort zones. The chicken options were all about average, and the whole sauteed mushrooms were delicious. I actually was very impressed by this place. I normally don't have soup on hot summer days, but after hearing raving remarks on the chicken dill barley soup with leeks, I gave it a try and must concur. Grab a few lemon wedges from the bar and sprinkle generously on the soup (and almost any dish here you'd like). Granted we were here for a private function, but I would definitely recommend this place to anyone. In my honest opinion the lunch buffet at this function here was good enough to be had at a wedding reception. Hint hint to anyone considering Mideast food at their special day.

And unfortunately, that was most of what was vegetarian on the lunch buffet. There was also their amazing dill rice, and a nondescript ""spicy rice"" that reminded me more of Spanish rice, plus some grilled vegetables that also didn't a distinctive Persian flavor  or much of any taste at all. I would have been better off skipping the $12.95 lunch buffet and getting the vegetarian combo instead - the dolmas, vegetarian shami (pomegranate sauce, mmmm), and Kashkeh Bodmejan (eggplant with garlic & mint) are all more authentic Persian dishes.

We had a party of 20 or 21 people and made the critical mistake of not asking for separate checks at the very beginning, but that doesn't make up for the headache that everyone had to deal with after the check came: We were split into two tables, so I asked if they could at least split the check between the two tables instead of the one we received. The server said it was fine, so we waited and waited, knowing it was going to take a little while for them to figure out which table got what. They ended up coming back to us with three checks instead: one for each table for the food, and one long check for the drinks. Again, I can understand, since we didn't tell them initially we wanted separate checks that they couldn't remember who had what, but this would have been an important detail to point out... now the checks were even more of a mess: anyone who needed to pay with a card (and had drinks) had get it run once for the food, once for the drinks, and everyone had to calculate twice for separate tax and tip on top of that.  One single person asked if she could get her check separated out so she could use her gym discount from Cheetah. I'm also a member, and had asked earlier if I could use my discount on the bill, but was told no because it was one giant bill and mine wasn't separated out--something I thought they couldn't do because they'd already told us it was one bill already. (The friend still ended up having to swipe twice because her drink was also one the giant drinks bill.) Anyway, the cherry on top of this entire ordeal was when the waiter started mouthing back at us. After we finally figured out everything and clearly wrote how much every card should be charged with, the server came back to us asking for clarification on the drinks bill. My friend (who had asked for the separate check)  asked if this was how Reza normally handles large parties, and the server started getting defensive, saying most parties ask for separate checks from the beginning, otherwise they assume one person handles the entire bill. I asked why we couldn't have avoided everything by having everyone reiterate what they ordered, since clearly they could have still separated out the bill like they did for my friend. All he kept going back to was how the other large party next to us had no problems with their bill because one person took care of it. I kid you not, I was the one who ended up saying ""look, it doesn't really matter, it's over and done with"" twice to him before he stopped arguing back. Really, the only question I had was why we couldn't have separated the bill out after the fact to avoid all this pain and confusion.  Again, I understand we made a critical mistake at the beginning by not letting them know we wanted separate checks; however, I can't begin to express the amount of frustration everyone felt over how the Reza staff handled the situation (Seriously! I, THE CUSTOMER, had to calm the wait staff down by asking him to just drop it!). The time it took for the bill ended up taking just as long (if not a little more) as the meal itself. It not only stressed the entire party out, but also impeded everyone's after-dinner plans. Honestly, it wasn't so much the bill (even if we had one bill per table, it would have been ok), it was how unprofessional the staff was and the amount of information they withheld.",0.874,0.827,0.093,0.08,0.47591793950284506

A handsome young fellow asked me out to dinner and suggested Reza's (as I had mentioned I love Persian food). We hemmed and hawed over the menu for a bit and I eventually settled on the lam kebab with grilled veggies and seasoned couscous. Thank god for this man's inability to hold a conversation because it gave me the ability to zone out and enjoy how lovely this restaurant is.  Charming atmosphere (really beautiful on a great day when they open the front doors up onto the sidewalk, it makes the dark wood paneling glow), great music, and an excellent location. While the guy texted and tweeted his way through half of the meal--regardless of how engaging and funny I was--I begged and pleaded the gods of saffron to bring me my meal. Be praised, it couldn't have come fast enough.  Now I had a real reason to ignore the chump, which wasn't hard. These lamb chunks (and they were, just great heaping chunks of meat) were cooked to tender, juicy perfection. Seasoned expertly and served on a giant plate with solid slices of grilled tomatoes and sweet, white onions, this meal could not have been better Add to it the beautiful, fluffy couscous, attentive--yet not overbearing--service, and you have one happy man.

We tried their lunch buffet and even though they had an awful lot of variety, my first gripe was that the food was just not hot- warm to room temperature at best. I don't want to judge Persian food just based on my experience at Reza's- will be most likely giving other Persian restaurants in Chicago a try. The kebabs were bland to say the least and I have had much better hummus and falafel elsewhere. I am not Persian but Middle Eastern by heritage- so I think I have a good idea of what good Middle Eastern food is. Albeit there are some differences, I think I know flavor when I taste it. The service was ok although I didn't like the fact that all the servers were just hovering around the buffet with one of them keeping an eye on the customers (or maybe just me?) but I definitely found that uncomfortable.

I have yet to find another Persian restaurant that serves dill rice, much to my disappointment. In the past, I have ordered their hummus as an appetizer, and it has always been smooth and creamy and made with fresh ingredients. The flatbread they served this evening, which reminded me of a gigantic slab of Indian naan bread, was soft and delicious, and the crispiness of some edges where it was charred only enhanced the overall taste. Lastly, their lentil soup, which was served as an appetizer, was still the same, delicious (tomato-based?) soup, but I still maintain my one criticism and wish it was filled with more lentils, like other Middle Eastern lentil soups I enjoy. More lentil action, please! Given the thinness of the broth, I don't believe the lentils are pureed to mix with the soup, as other restaurants do.

2012-03-07,1.0,"Of all the great restaurants we could patronize in Andersonville, we picked this one cause my friend had a taste for Mediterranean. I wish I would have talked her out of it. Not only is their menu inside nothing like what is posted on the outside, and the food is mediocre at best, the waitstaff is poorly trained and unattentive and the person that I'll generously call for this review, ""manager"" could probably single handedly get this restaurant closed in a matter of days.  I asked our waiter about AND described a Greek salad that was listed on the outside menu but couldn't find on the menu we were given. I just asked him to let me know if they could make or I'd pick something else. I also specified that we would like water, which he laughed ""of course"". What transpired next was nothing short of a restaurant nightmare. He left and didn't come back with water or my friend's drink for a while. The ""manager"" came by to say they can make a Greek Salad, which again I referred him to the sign outside calling it a Mediterranean Salad. He said he understood. Still waiting on water mind you. 15 minutes later (table next to us had their food and came in after us), I left to find our waiter, our water and my friend's wine. Another 15 minutes later and a plate of radish slices and 3 pieces of feta, we asked about my friend's wine and the waiter looked perplexed said ""you want wine?"" (she'd ordered chardonnary but they were out and then she said just give me pinot grigio, he said ""ok"")  Our appetizer came and he asked me if the ""manager"" had come by and I said I think we're set. Now I have not been to this restaurant before , I know what have I been under a rock? But what they served as a Greek Salad was astonishing to me, A plate with Feta cheese slices (2) in the middle surrounded with perfect little separate piles of craisins, walnuts, olives and tomatoes. No greens, no dressing, no salad? I told the waiter this isn't what I asked for or described or what you have listed on the menu outside. I asked him to send over the ""manager"". We waited, and waited and saw that the ""manager"" was adding up receipts because I guess my refusal of their version of ""Mediterranean Salad"" wasn't important enough to him. No ""I'm sorry, would you like to order something else"" or ""I'm sorry we/you/we misunderstood"" but instead again I'm having to go find the ""manager"". His answer was ""THis is our Mediteranean Salad, this is how we've made it since we opened..."" That was it, no more said. He went back to adding, I drank water and watched my friend eat her entree. When we left his answer to us when we said this is probably one of the worst service experiences we've ever had was ""menus are subject to change, we've been here 30 years and some customers are just difficult"" My answer to this ""manager"" is don't worry, you wont' be open another year at this rate.",-0.8808,0.87,0.055,0.075,0.3849404761904762

Everyone else that got seated received bread right away it took them 15-20mins to bring us that or even water ( mind you we had a 2yr old with us)  so our  waitress finally comes over but had a horrible rush rush attitude and left the table before we barely finished ordering.  For an appetizer we got the chicken kabobs- they were ok but only saved because of the lemon they put on it.  For entré we both got the filet minon with salmón and the other with scallops. The steak was horrible, over cooked and dry and Not seasoned at all, the salmon was the only delicious thing on those plates. The scallops were horrible completely over cooked rubbery and fishy tasting. When we told the waitress she said I took too many bites of it for them to do anything ( how else was I supposed to know if it was good if I didn't take a bite of everything???)  Then the manager/owner not sure which comes over and says that the food is fine and that he can only take a little off and completely denied any wrong with the food. The ppl nxt to our table however also complained and did not eat their food nor did the ppl behind us here were at least 4 other complaints that night alone on our side. The manger then says that's how they cook their food there... I said over cooked and no seasoning and he told me yes. Now that was the end for me!

I haven't experienced any issues with the waitstaff, which is the primary reason for my repeated patronage. Whether Sunday brunch or a dinner buffet, I've always received attentive, respectful and efficient service. Moreover, they understand the beauty of not hounding me every five minutes, which is a welcomed experience.  Their food is consistently well-prepared. Again, is it going to blow your mind? No. But you likely won't be disappointed. The dishes are standard Mediterranean/Persian, with few surprises. The cocktail list tries to be inventive, but I've noticed that the more exotic drinks are usually the weakest. They do, however, have generous pours on their wines...just don't expect fifteen choices. Their variety fits the menu, however. The buffet is an excellent introduction to this type of cuisine, or a good fit if you want to sample several items. Common sense dictates, however, that some dishes are best served to order. While I love having filet mignon skewers as a buffet option, if their ambient temperature renders them to sandpaper consistency it somewhat defeats the purpose.  Be forewarned that if you are a vegetarian, you will be somewhat limited in your options. Recently, my dining vegan dining companion returned from the buffet with a half-plate of mashed potatoes. I didn't have the heart to tell him that they may have been prepared with powdered milk.  For the area, there's a very laidback and almost soothing atmosphere to the dining experience.

There were probably 5 other people in the entire restaurant, and we had to wait to be seated, because it took a few minutes for the staff to even notice us. When they finally did, homegirl acted like the popular cheerleader who had been forced to be lab partners with the school nerds (me and the boyfriend). Whatever, maybe she's having a bad day. I know waiters and waitresses have a tough job. I'm normally a good tipper, and very sympathetic when it comes to foodservice staff dealing with large crowds. I even try and give them the benefit of the doubt when they aren't all smiles and super chatty. So I wasn't going to let this ruin our meal. Initially, we were drawn to the lunch buffet sign that was outside, but when we asked about it, our waitress very bluntly told us it was OVER. No mention of the buffet's hours, or when the dinner buffet started. Ok, that's fine, we'll find something off the menu. I decide on the lamb koubideh and ask for the ""small size,"" which the menu says is a half portion of the full entree.  ""Just to let you know, it's like a kid's menu,"" she says. ""Oh. Well how big is it?"" I ask. ""Very small. Like, for kids,"" she replies.  ""I think I'll be fine."" I say. Alright, who killed this chick's dog this morning?

Even though there is not much to be thankful for, we thank her, and she still refuses to make eye contact or smile.

We ordered a vegetarian lunch combo with baba ganoush, mushroom stuffed pepper, and roasted eggplant steak. We also ordered the Chicken Fessenjan stew for some protein, as I cannot get through the day without protein.  I would say the best thing we ordered was the stuffed pepper, but I also felt like this is a dish my mother could make at home. Everything was ""fine"" but not great. I really didn't like the sauce for the chicken very much- it was a pomegranate sauce... sounded interesting at the time, but it left a literally bitter taste in my mouth.  We decided to get the Persian white rice to go with the meal, and it was just super super oily.

He rebuilt his life from scratch in the US and started this successful restaurant in the Midwest. On a recent dining experience in Chicago at Reza, I saw the owner doing the bookkeeping.  I love the fessunjan pomegranate walnut chicken, the cranberry saffron rice, the dill rice, and the lamb shanks. I also like the ghorma sabbzi, I've heard it takes foreever to make, better to just buy it and enjoy.   Persian restaurants in the Midwest are a premium.

2011-02-23,2.0,"I'm going giving this place two stars because the food (although overpriced) was at least eatable. The experience we had with the manager, however, leaves me wanting to leave only one star.  First off, the menu items are well cooked and typical Middle Eastern fare. They aren't anything special enough to write home about, but the cooks do a great job at leaving their meats juicy and their rice well seasoned. We walked in about around 9:30 PM on a weeknight. There were four of us. One person in my group had already eaten and decided to get an appetizer. We asked the waiter if we could do the Family Style dinner combination for the other 3 of us. He said sure and we chose our items. The food came out and there was a ton of it. Way more than the three of us could ever eat. Props for that. At some point during our meal, another one of our friends stopped in and pulled up a chair. He had a few pieces of meat, literally 4 at the most. He wasn't there to eat.  All was fine until the waiter comes up to us and tells us that the manager saw my friend eating and is going to charge him for eating a meal. WHAT? We ask at waiter what the reasoning is and he tells us that the manager is making him do this because the Family Style combinations are unlimited. Sound odd? YES, BECAUSE NO WHERE ON THE MENU (I just went and doubled checked) DOES IT SAY THAT THE FAMILY STYLE DINNER COMBINATIONS ARE UNLIMITED. I completely understand how a manager could walk by and see our friend eating and not know how much he ate. Understandable. However, we didn't even finish our first plates. We never even got to the point of having seconds! We boxed it up and took our leftovers home.  Dear Reza's, make it clear to your customers what the policies are ON THE MENU. I could tell how embarrassed the waiter was for having to tell us this. I felt like he's had to do this at his manager's request before. At the very least, hire managers who at least have the guts to talk to their customers. Bottom Line: While I hear their lunch buffet is great, Reza's needs to update their managers and their menu before I (or anyone I know) return.",0.9901,0.849,0.116,0.035,0.4502215608465608

After moving back to Chicago, I suggested that my roommate and I grab lunch at Reza's as she loves Middle Eastern food and she just moved from New York (she's also a vegetarian - remember this). After looking over the menu, she decided on a few appetizers a la carte and I ordered the scallop/filet kabob plate.

After walking around the poor excuse for a buffet, and listening to our server say things like ""this is vegetarian...I think"" my roommate decided to try it, mostly because the server went through so much trouble to sell it, and we just wanted to EAT already. After my roommate picked a few items we sat down and she ate while I waited for my meal. Before my food even came she was asking me to try the hummus because it ""tasted really weird"". I picked through her plate to find that the hummus had SALMON in iit. We're not talking one piece either, it was clearly mixed in even causing the hummus to take on a sort of pinkish color.

This restaurant has undergone a few changes lately that I'd like to comment on. The last time I had dinner there, they had removed a few tables from the main dining room and placed a buffet station. You can either order from the kitchen or from the buffet. If you order an entrée, you have access to the salad bar which includes their delicious vegetable soup and hummus.  The entrée to get is Chengeh. Hands down. Get half dill and half white rice to see which you like better. The lamb kabob is another fine choice but I am never disappointed by the chengeh.  Now why only 3 stars? The service is pretty inconsistent. The waiters have a high turnover so it's very unlikely you'll see the same one twice. As a result you always have a new person unfamiliar with the menu and the restaurant in general. I've had great service at times and absolutely rude service at others.  The only drink I've tried was their mojito (don't ask me why I ordered this at middle eastern restaurant). Needless to say it was horrible. I say don't try your luck with the drinks. Go there when you want to have good food. I used to think of it as a good date place as well but I feel it has taken a turn for the worse with this new buffet set up.

I hadn't been there in about 3 years and was very excited to go back yesterday. It was awful from the start. There was hardly anyone in the place, and we had a reservation for 7 people. The host seemed annoyed, I think even rolled his eyes as he sat my fiance and I, the first 2 to arrive for our group.  I don't remember them not having air conditioning, but they didn't have it and it was over 80 degrees all day yesterday. No one came by to offer us a drink for over 15 minutes. I guess they were waiting until the other members of our party showed. The service was terrible the whole way through. I asked for a glass for the one bottle of wine we ordered. After 15 minutes, another member of my party got it from a busboy. It took over 2 hours from when everyone got there until we left, and this was without appetizers or dessert. And we were one of the only tables in the place! The food was not nearly as good as I remember. Both my fiance and I received different items on our plate than what we ordered. (We both ordered dill rice, I got couscous with fruit and he got white rice.) My couscous was hard and dry, as though it had either been severely overcooked or severely undercooked. The highlight of the evening came when I was eating my stuffed pepper, which truly was good, and something sharp stabbed me in the gums. I spit it out to find an inch and a half long metal shard. When we informed the staff, their response was. Oh. Well, do you want another dinner. No apology, no credit on our $200 bill, no dessert or drink for everyone, just another dinner that is now sitting untouched in my refrigerator.

I've been passing Reza's for years now. Quickly barreling down Clark and blowing by the large, neon red Reza's sign on the corner of Clark and Berwyn, I finally stopped by last night. I went with a friend for dinner at 8PM yesterday and was surprised how easy it was to sit outside on the patio. Reza's outdoor patio has to be some of the best seating in the city. It's secluded yet still allows a nice view of the busy street for some ideal people watching. This was a big win on behalf of the restaurant. We started with a glass of wine and started with hummus for our appetizer. I was excited to her about the buffet option they had for dinner. Awesome! But not really as we were told it was $24.99 for the buffet. I really couldn't justify that for hummus and falafel. So we ended up starting with a bunch of appetizers and ate tapas style.  I wasn't too excited over the hummus which was annoying. There wasn't a lot of flavor to the hummus and the bread was cold. It was still could but I wasn't really into it. I will say that the falafel was awesome! I didn't see many other options for me to go ahead with as there was a lot of lamb on the menu. I enjoyed the night at Reza's but I thought it was fairly overpriced on almost all the options. I'm going to settle with 3 stars because sitting outside was really the highlight of the evening.

Both entrees came with the salad bar.  Okay, so I didn't actually see the salad bar. I was wearing shoes that were apparently only meant for sitting. They are (re: were) fabulous though. I will miss them. I'm considering purchasing a wheel chair so that I can still wear them. But I digress. He said that there was a bounty to be had from there. He swears by the lentil soup, but it was too hot out for me to even think about soup. Hummus was super creamy and delish. Pita was fine, but I wish it had been warm. Falafels were crunchy outside and soft inside. Perfect. My shrimp dish was fine. A touch over done and a bit bland for me. My big gripe was the portion. The gave me a boatload of rice and like 8 shrimp. I obviously didn't order the right dish. When my piece got his grub, it was massive! Two nice sized file ts and an entire plate of rice. I ate quite a bit of his rice. Seriously, the dill rice here is super tasty. The steak was done perfectly. What? You know I snuck a few bites.

2010-06-11,1.0,"This place keeps getting worse for me. The service is often inattentive and misinformed. On several different occasions, I have been told entirely different things about what is included in the ""mini-buffet"" and what is not, only to have the manager correct the waitress. The menu is confusing and often incorrect. Not to mention the prices - Middle Eastern food (especially vegetarian) is relatively inexpensive to prepare. Whatever they're charging, it's to cover something other than the cost of food... maybe to cover the wages of all the inexperienced staff running around? I suspect that they are often brought in as friends of the family, and thus not judged on the strength of their experience and skills.  I have sat down never to be brought any table settings, regardless if I was ordering the buffet or not. If I order an entree, I should not have to go to the buffet to get a fork, knife and napkin.  I've also had bad experiences with getting the waitstaff to split the check, even when we have prearranged things. I had a party of 20 there one evening - two tables of 10, two checks. It shouldn't be that hard. I think we waited about half an hour to get the check back, after witnessing two waitresses going over our bill, scratching their heads and arguing right in front of us. Last Sunday I went for the mini-buffet, which I was told by the waitress couldn't be ordered that day. The menu says, ""No mini-buffet on Saturdays."" After having the manager correct her, I went up to enjoy some delicious falafel, only to find that it wasn't included on the mini-buffet that day. Why? I have no idea. No explanation.

2010-05-19,1.0,"The portions are big. The positive part of the review is over. This was the worst service I've ever experienced in a restaurant.  The worst.   I dined last night with a meet-up club.  I went with a friend of mine.  The two of us started by ordering a carafe of sangria.  It was almost as good as watered-down kool-aid -- almost.  For $16.95. Then we looked at the menu.  The cheapest meals were around $15, but it seemed like the average price was closer to $25 to $27.  I went for a $14.95 lamb dish with couscous.  Three appetizers came with this entree.....first came the soup.   The soup tasted great.  The problem was that there was only one spoon between the two of us.  I tried to get the waitress' attention.  She appeared to see me but ignore me, but I figured I just must have been imagining things. I walked across the room to talk to her and ask for another spoon.  She rolled her eyes, but she said she would bring me another spoon.  Ten minutes later, with our soup now cold, we still were short a spoon.  I look over my should, and she's standing behind the bar, folding napkins.  My set of flatware is sitting on the bar next to her.  I walk up there and pick it up myself -- she didn't even acknowledge me. Then came the pita, hummus and cucumber salad.  These were actually average.  I guess I have two positive things to say, and not just one.   Next came my meal.  The plate was huge, and there was a lot of food.  My lamb tasted like hamburger.  It was like a dry Burger King Whopper patty.  Everyone around me complained about their food, too.  Everyone except the guy with the salmon.   Apparently the only thing that anyone could agree was good was the dill rice. When the waitress said she'd only split our bill five ways (there were about 30 in our party, and almost all of us were virtual strangers), that was all I could take.  I'm not really sure how she expected us to split 30 bills 5 ways.  I knew I wasn't letting anyone charge their meal on my card. I went to talk to her.  I was polite. I know that honey is always sweeter than vinegar.  She told me that it wasn't possible to bill each of us separately.  I told her that I knew it was.  (I have friends who are servers, and they've all told me that it's just as easy to make 20 checks as it is 1 check.  Servers who refuse to do this for you, or who say it isn't possible, are just being lazy.)  This was the same waitress that wouldn't bring me my spoon.  She continued to give me an attitude.   The manager overheard us, and came up to me.  I explained the situation to him.  He initially bucked at the idea, but after about 3 minutes, he agreed to split the bill for all of us. I went back to my table, and I saw my waitress and our other server b******g to the manager for the next 5 minutes.  Right out in front of us -- they didn't even have the respect to do it behind-doors.   The bus boy was nice when he picked up my plate.

From this, we took home at least two meals worth of food. Wha??? I can't imagine what the $30/per person combos are like--it can't be worth it unless you can eat your weight in Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food. Oh, the combos also included the salad bar (we got one serving, which we didn't finish). The service was mostly pleasant, but when the waiters brought out the food, there wasn't even enough room on the table and they just stood there and waited for us to rearrange everything to make it fit. Kind of awkward.... Overall the atmosphere and food at this Andersonville mainstay is decent, but something about the unnecessarily large servings really turns me off.

We did the 5 course package #1 ($24.00 a person, which turned out to be a good deal).  3 apps of Baba Ghanouj, Falafel and Baked Herbed Feta.  This all came with a large portion of Persian Salad (cucumber, tomato, onion, parsley, lemon juice) and a warm tomato olive oil dish.  The Feta was by far our favorite, but how hard is it to enjoy warm feta cheese with herbs on top?  sooo...  the falafel was well prepared and not dry, which can often be the case, and the underlaying sauce was nice and light.  The salad was good and was a nice clean acidic compliment to the other apps, however it needed salt.  The Baba Ghanouj was good, but not anything special (far better down the street at Taste of Lebanon).  Overall...  a good start to the meal and plenty of it.  The pita bread was not homemade (Again, far better at Taste of Lebanon), nor was it memorable. The main courses we ordered were quite good and served with a heaping portion of dill rice, white jasmine rice and a bit of saffron rice.  Filet Mignon Kabobs were very flavorful, a bit overcooked from the med-rare we ordered, but nothing to complain about.  The Chicken Fessanjan was good, not great...  had a pomegranate, almond sauce that was a bit overbearing for the simple chicken, well maybe it was the amount of sauce...  the chicken could have gone for a swim.  The highlight of the entire meal was the Lamb Shank...  braised in a tomato based broth that was filled with wonderful flavors and spices...  we were actually dipping all of our other food into the lamb's braising liquid.  The lamb was extremely tender and juicy and was the only main course dish we finished at the restaurant...  the rest we took home. For dessert we had a wonderfully rich walnut baklava which was a perfect end to the food marathon.  I only wished I had ordered a cold glass of milk to wash that sucker down...  very rich and sweet.

Which brings me to staying in the city to enjoy this lovely fall weather.  And then I got hungry.  So I decided to venture into Andersonville to get some grub, and lo and behold...I saw a sign for Lunch Buffet at Reza's... Again, I am not usually a huge fan of buffets (read my review for the Jolly Inn); however, I was STARVING and it was yet another sign from above (regardless of religion!).   So I strolled into Reza's...and surprisingly for a Monday 1 pm-ish timeframe, it was actually somewhat busy.  After being seated, I proceeded to see what $9.95 would buy me at this buffet. For starters, I tried the hummus and pita bread.  Creamy, smooth and extremely good.  I also had a falafel and it was crispy and delicious!  And to top it off, I tried the chicken barley soup - which was tasty and very warming for these chilly fall days in the windy city. Onto entrees.  They had three different kind of rice dishes:  a vegetarian, a dill rice and a simple white rice.  I tried them all (the curse of being Chinese!).  They were all good, but the dill rice was exceptionally good! And for meat to accompany my rice, I tried the Chicken kababs (both regular and spicy), along with all three different types of koubidehs (chicken, beef and lamb).  WOW...it was all outstanding.  And yes, I went back for seconds. As far as desserts is concerned...I usually skip at buffets because I am too full.  Not this time.  They had these sweetly soaked doughnut like pastries.  WOW...and they went soo well with my coffee.

If you are a vegetarian, you will find plenty to choose from on their menu. But if you're looking for authentic Persian dishes, try elsewhere. Their soup has gotten more and more watered down over the years and their meat does not sit well in my stomach, probably because it's pumped full of preservatives.

There was an unlimited soup and salad bar that came with the deal. Sounds exciting, right? Think again. I only filled up once because it was that bad. Server was nice.

The grilled potatoes were okay, except my friend got one that was not cooked and completely raw. Both the mushrooms and the potatoes were greasy and in a lot of oil.

After she basically forces me to order something else (which, in all honesty, was delicious) her shift must have ended because we see her leaving the restaurant with her coat on and saying good-bye to everyone but us. I totally understand a server leaving after her shift, but at least tell us. We then waited about 25 minutes before anyone else came to the table and even then the new server didn't acknowledge us. As if our server had a spontaneous sex-change. The new server was worse than the first - no water refills, no communication, nothing.

On the upside, they set aside a large space for my friend's birthday which gave us plenty of room to spread out. The service was friendly and non-intrusive and we never felt rushed to order or to leave after we were finished with our meal. Even though we were part of a large group, they were gracious about splitting the check for three of us without it being a hassle. Also, our waitress took time to explain the family style options vs. individual entrees so kudos to her.  Now, the food. Personally, I felt the pricing was a bit high for what it was. The menu is enormous and a little daunting though it is pretty well laid out and self-explanatory. A friend and I decided to split a few appetizers instead of ordering individual dinners which worked pretty well. I wasn't a huge fan of the food itself though. The grilled mushrooms were tasty, but the grilled potatoes seemed a bit soggy whereas I was hoping for some crunch to them. The hummus wasn't anything special, tasted ok, but not any better than the pre-packaged kind. It might have been served well if fresh pitas were brought with, but that didn't happen.

It took us forever to decide what we wanted to eat because the menu is HUGE and everything looks good! We had initially wanted to order a sampler but didn't think two of us could eat that much food (soup, salad, 3 appetizers, entree, and dessert), so we instead ordered hummus and pita for an appetizer and then chose out own entrees.  The hummus was less garlicky than I am used to but was delicious; the garbanzo flavor really came out. The pita was warm and fresh.  I ordered the Fessenjan -- chicken in a sweet-sour pomegranate walnut sauce, which came with a pile of saffron currant rice. I thought the sauce on the chicken might be like a glaze, but it looked more like a thin tomato sauce, a little chunky, with a really sparky flavor; very different -- I'm glad I tried it. There was a ton of chicken and rice too, enough for three meals for me. The entrees also came with soup, a choice of lentil or chicken barley. I had the latter, but only ate a bit because I didn't want to be overfull, but it was very tasty.  My friend had the shrimp and dill rice; she gave me one -- a tiny bit tough, so perhaps cooked a bit too long, but a nice, subtly garlicky flavor.  Our server, Wade, did an excellent job and was wonderfully attentive.  There were many other things on Reza's menu that I'd like to try (the mushrooms basted in garlic butter on the appetizer list, the quail, the Shirin Polo (saffron, almond, orange peel and pistachio rice), so I'll clearly have to make another visit.

2008-10-01,3.0,"ok, i am going to go out on a limb here and say i am probably the most qualified person to write a review for this place.   i have been going to this location since it opened, back in the early 80s. while all the cool kids had their birthday parties at mcdonalds, i was having mine at reza's. lamb koubideh, anyone?   at some point i stopped asking (back then, the all iranian, male waitstaff) for hot dogs, and started enjoying the authentic persian cuisine.  come on, who doesn't love a kabob. but obviously things have changed. reza's is no longer a hole in the wall, one location, diamond in the rough. now they have several locations (even in a holiday inn in oakbrook--yikes); they cater to a much larger group, reeling you in with their mediterranean and vegetarian cuisines; and their prices have literally skyrocketed while the portions have slimmed down.  back then you could walk in, sit down at the table, order enough entrees for a family of four, and get by without spending more than 30 bucks, tip included. today, you are lucky if you get two meals for that. the soup they give you as soon as you sit down--that used to come in a much larger bowl. the feta cheese and radish combo--that used to be COMPLIMENTARY, and the flat bread--well that used to be an endless basket of hot pita bread. if you are like me and enjoy meat any chance the opportunity arrises, you are going to order from the steak/kabob/chicken part of the menu. the sultani (half steak kabob, and half ground beef kabob) is a must.  the koubideh, chengeh, and the shishleek are all good options depending on your beef preference.  it probably has to be mentioned, that one of the main ingredients in preparing persian food is the onion. so get ready to taste whatever you eat tonight, tomorrow morning.  the vegetarian platters are also a must. it also seems the biggest bang for your buck. you get the dolmeh, the tabouli, baba ghannouj,  and about 6 other options. remember, a true iranian does not order the garden salad for an appetizer. you're going to see us with some kind of eggplant item smothered in a yogurt or tahini sauce.  and now, for dessert. the bamieh is the only iranian pastry on the menu. it looks a little bit like a hot dog and a little bit like an eclair and it tastes like a syrup-y, damp, flaky donut. i still don't know what to make of the bamieh except that it's 1.75 and that's probably still too much for it.  i suppose you could order the chocolate cake. it might help dispel that onion taste that has now taken root in your taste buds. up to you. so, to conclude. reza's--less like a diamond in the rough and more like a chain restaurant. you can still order excellent food, but the prices are outrageous for the portions, so maybe stop next door to andies for a little cheaper version of basically the same thing.",0.9951,0.827,0.136,0.037,0.47133569739952713

Our server was ok, his English was a little choppy so there were a few hiccups ordering our food (adding chicken to a salad, etc.). I think because we confused him a bit he brought lentil soup to the whole table rather than figuring out how many people actually wanted it (fortunately, he didn't charge us for the extras). I'm not a big fan of lentil soup, but aside from it being a bit too tart, it was pretty good. There was so much food I took a lot home, next time I'm splitting a sampler or getting an appetizer portion. Side note, my meal wasn't served on a plate, but a tray the kind you would use at a party that's about the diameter of a medium pizza - way, way too much food for one person. I ordered veggie sampler #3, holy moly that's a lot of food - hummus, tabbouleh, cous cous, falafel, baba ghanouj and eggplant steak. To boot, it came with the aforementioned soup and a side - I chose sauteed veggies. The veggies weren't what I'd expected, it was more like a primavera sauce with cous cous on top. Considering I already had cous cous in my sampler it was the last thing I needed. I didn't care for the eggplant steak either, I expected a solid slice of eggplant with marinara over it, but other than the skin of the eggplant it seemed like I was eating forkfuls of marinara, bleh. I skipped the falafel all together, there was too much other stuff on my plate I had yet to make a dent in.  I only had 2 real negatives: (1) The bathrooms, my friend is 8 1/2 months pregnant and therefore has to pee every 10 minutes. She said the bathrooms were gross and dreaded having to make a return trip. (2) More pita! We got one basket with one pita for each of us with our hummus appetizer.

2008-05-12,3.0,The food was amazing! Actually I loved this neighbourhood as a kid because my mom would always take me to Swedish Bakery down the street but today I discovered this place through a friend. Huge portions you definitely get your money's worth.  Friendly and prompt waitstaff and we didn't have to worry about refilled water glasses because our server brought us a pitcher.

The place is huge and can easily seat large parties. I sat down and already had a yummy sangria waiting for me. The menu is rather large, and a bit overwhelming...but I don't think you can go wrong with any choice.  We started with baba ganish (however you spell the thing), hummus and tazhiki. My fave was the tazhiki. It was refreshing and full of flavor. Don't worry, I ate so much of the appetizers, I barely had room for the main course. Good thing I had some serious meat coming my way. I took about two bites of my entree and was finished. It was sad because my filet was juicy and cooked to perfection. They sauce that smothered my steak complimented it so well, and the sea bass was also delicious!  Unfortunately, I had no room for desert. Doggie bags! Just finished the leftovers today, and let me say...it was about as superb as the first go-around.  I was very impressed with my meal. Unfortunately, we did have some issues with the service. Our waitress was a bit slow at times and neglected to check up on us at all after we got our food. It was a busy evening, but it seems like this place always has busy evenings.

So, really, this meal didn't stand a chance. With overarchingly impossible high standards to live up to, it was doomed from the start. In a word, my experience was: tomato. Yup, tomato. Everything I ate was bathed in a curiously sweet, stunningly bland tomato sauce - from the rice, stuffed peppers, even some kind of falafel-type dumplings on the platter. As for the hummus and kashko bademjan, they almost made me wish they were covered in sauce, it might have been an improvement. Sorry guys, this wasn't for me.

The menu was lengthy and indecipherable in places (think: trashy Mexican restaurant with dried salsa on some of the menu pages). They had no by-the-glass wine list to speak of, despite having a separate wine list -- I ordered Merlot of unknown vintage; it was drinkable. Not fantastic, but drinkable. The tomato lentil soup was Campbell's tomato soup with lentils and about sixteen tablespoons of dried basil and oregano stirred in: weak and overdone. The kabobs, though moist, were not 'on the stick', as any American wants it, and the oddly-shaped mound of couscous was dry and unpalatable. There were no other kabob-style vegetables in either of our dishes, but there was a good-tasting sauce made almost entirely of mushroom stems. Highlights: Delicious, fresh-from-the-oven afghan-style bread. Staring at cute guys walking along Clark St. Given its location, I thought I was going to a fresh take on middle eastern cuisine, and ended up eating at something much more low brow.

I think the addition of the buffet is a nice touch, but they need to diversify the items on it a bit more. I'm not sure if the decision to include American food items like Caesar salad and mashed potatoes and gravy is a savvy way of not alienating wary newcomer palates, or a weaksauce concession to the masses.

Mommy Factor:  This is literally the only place that my mom will consistently go to.....take that for what its worth.

2006-11-14,3.0,"I used to very much dislike Reza's.  Primarily because even though I'd been here soo many times, I'd always thought the food wasn't very tasteful and there wasn't anything about their dishes that screamed ""must have again"" .  The kabobs I'd always thought were dry and pointless.  That was a year ago. I'd gone today with some friends and the food was excellent, though as with most nice sit down middle eastern places, food is so damn expensive.  I think they've raised their prices yet again.  I was surprised to see that the menu has grown wider.  The lamb kabobs were fantastic, juicy and tasty.  The dill rice is always a pleaser.  The Filet mignon kabobs, just order a few skewers on the side, very good.  Hummus was too bland.   They have a better hot sauce now, almost felt like it was a little too salsa tasting, but it does have zing and is the right hot. Shawarma sandwich was pretty yum, I don't think they offered that previously, though they can add a bit more meat.  Its a great place in the warmer seasons, but as it gets colder, seating in the front areas is hard to deal with at times.  They've got alot of vents shooting warm air forward. It doesn't help enough.  I like to have warmth and feel comfortable while I eat. At night, you can really feel the chills coming in through the glass. Its pretty good food and worth checking it out.",0.9923,0.762,0.201,0.037,0.5781255835667601

2006-09-04,3.0,"I like Reza's more than I used to. It started out as a reasonably sized restaurant, but slowly ate up all the real estate around it as it grew and grew. I first came here during that expansion, and they obviously weren't prepared for their growth. Now that it's stabilized, the food and service is less erratic. The service generally isn't very good. If it's slow, the servers are all talking with one another. If it's busy, they're running around like crazy. They are all pretty knowledgeable though, so if you have questions, you'll probably get the right answers. In general, stay away from the beef. The ground beef skewers are fine, but any other beef I've ever had here has been overcooked and chewy. The lamb and poultry are generally better options. The lamb shank really is wonderful. They seem to only serve vegetarian dishes as part of various combo plates, which is odd to me, especially for a Persian restaurant. Perhaps they're concerned about American palates. Beware the dreaded dill rice. For years, this is what kept me away from Reza's. An entree would be huge, but that was because it was served on a bed of sickly green, bone dry, nearly tasteless dill rice. They've gotten the dill rice problem under control, but I'm still not a fan. If you can substitute cous cous, by all means do so. Reza's is probably worth more than a 3. I'd give Reza's a 3+ and Andies a 4-, but in this system, they're both 3s.",0.7901,0.815,0.105,0.08,0.5358866995073892

You can't charge that kind of money for a self service buffet that includes (admittedly not bad tasting) but very standard food. Reza's needs to get over itself and lower the prices. I feel like they have high prices to maintain a high class image, but come on.... I have no problem paying $100 for a meal if it blows my mind, but I do have a problem with a $20 meal that should cost $10.

The food is good, not the best, but enjoyable enough.  I think it lacks a bit of seasoning.  A few in my party asked for hot sauce and were pleasantly surprised at how spicy it was, they are used to restaurants having tame sauces.  The portions are huge, I believe most dishes are accompanied by a plateful of rice. The staff is accommodating, but there are times where they tend to just hover in groups together.
